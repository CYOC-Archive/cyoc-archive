<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ever since he started puberty, Andre has been treated differently by people. That was because Andre had CAH, which caused his body to produce much higher amounts of testosterone for his age. It caused him to develop faster than other boys, but not grow any taller. In fact, the hormone imbalance actually stunted his growth and may make him sterile later in life. His conversion into an anole Animalian wasn&#39;t just for Horizon Labs to study how the virus affected his hormone condition, but to give him a better life than he could have as a human.<br />
<br />
But people still treated him differently as a lizard, though for different reasons. The virus had reacted rather well with his hormones, giving him a big, muscular body. It certainly got a lot of attention from the ladies, too much attention, actually. Andre was constantly being stalked by girls who wanted to see more of his physique. They were particularly interested in his dick, which was over twelve inches long. There have been a few instances where girls surprised him in the locker room. The annoying part was that with so much healthy hormones in him, it was really easy for Andre to pop a boner. As such, he had gotten rather jaded with women as they didn&#39;t seem to be interested in anything more than his body. Though the gender-flipped irony was not lost on him.<br />
<br />
Melissa was a different story. True, she did have her own fantasies about Andre, but she was more interested in a personal relationship. A particularly good reason for this was the way her last relationship had gone. It was a fast-paced, passionate romance which featured motorcycle racing rather heavily. But then the accident happened which lost Melissa her lower legs. She lost her boyfriend soon after that, as she couldn&#39;t ride with him anymore. As such, Melissa was more interested in a boyfriend who was more reliant and cared for her beyond shared hobbies.<br />
<br />
So Andre and Melissa had started out a bit shakily, each one a bit doubtful about the other. But over time, they got pretty close. It helped that the Elder Scroll games that Melissa played were really fun and Andre soon got into them. But more than that, Andre and Melissa felt more drawn together because of who they were. It also pained Andre to see a girl with such a bright personality be missing half of her legs. Though when they agreed to convert Melissa, she had a particular fantasy for how they would do that.<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
Miss Vivian’s roleplay costumes had a rather impressive selection for couples to engage in fantasy scenarios. Melissa got a mage costume, which mainly consisted of a cloak. She didn’t bother anything more than extensive than that. In fact, she wasn’t even wearing any underwear beneath her cloak. The most extensive part of her costume were the bandages that were bound around the ends of her truncated legs. Andre got the more extensive costume, being dressed as an Argonian sellsword.<br />
<br />
Andre had read over the script that Melissa had written and figured his role easy enough. He was an Argonian warrior that had been hired by Melissa’s wizard character to act as her bodyguard. But over time, they had become closer and would have been lovers if it wasn’t for the social stigma against lizardfolk. But when they had explored a dwarven ruin, the wizard had gotten badly injured by a trap that chopped her legs off. Her Argonian partner had done what he could to save her, but the trap’s blades were also laced with a terrible disease that was quickly killing her.<br />
<br />
“There isn’t much time left,” said Melissa in a weak voice, “None of my Cure Disease potions are having any effect. There is no time to go to a shrine for a blessing.”<br />
<br />
“Mistress, I cannot let you go like this,” said Andre, making his voice raspier for the role, “There must be something we can do.”<br />
<br />
“There may be…one way,” said Melissa. She lifted a flask of red liquid, which was really pomegranate juice. “I’ve been working on this potion. It can give someone the traits of another race. If you add some of your blood to this, it may give me an Argonian’s resistance to diseases and give me enough strength to make it to a shrine.”<br />
<br />
“I will gladly give my blood to you, mistress,” said Andre, taking the flask from her. He opened the flask and used his claw to cut open his palm to drip blood into the potion. Or at least that’s what he mimed to do. As much as he and Melissa wanted to be together, they both agreed drinking blood was a little too much. Rather Andre had been de-vaccinated and had added his saliva to the pomegranate juice. Granted, saliva wasn’t much of a step up from blood for drinking, but it would do the job. Andre handed the flask back and said, “I would give more if it would help you.”<br />
<br />
Melissa raised up the flask and said, “This should be more than enough, I hope. There’s only one way to be sure.” She put the flask to her lips and drank heavily. She couldn’t taste Andre’s spit in there, which was probably for the best. She drank the whole flask before setting it down and said, “And now we shall see.”<br />
<br />
For a while, nothing seemed to happen. Melissa wondered if it wasn’t quite enough to get her infected. But soon the changes began. Her fingernails darkened before they started growing longer and sharper. Her skin prickled as scales started appearing on them. They were brown right now, but Melissa knew that anoles like she was becoming had the ability to change between green and brown colors. She felt some discomfort as her face was pushing out into a lizard’s muzzle. At least her hair wasn’t falling out.<br />
<br />
The greatest discomfort was growing new bones. The feeling of her coccyx extending out of her back before growing longer with more vertebrate was a sensation hard to describe. The feeling of her legs bulging as new flesh and bones were being rebuilt was even greater. The bandages around the stumps of her legs quickly tore and unraveled as her kneecaps fully grew back before her thighs started growing out from them. When her feet regrew, they were not like they were before, but lizard feet much like Andre’s.<br />
<br />
When the changes ended, Melissa was now an anthro lizard like Andre. She unfastened the clasps of her cloak, exposing the naked body underneath. Her abs were a bit more defined and her breasts had definitely gone up a few sizes. Melissa looked at her new body and spoke in a raspy voice, “It seems that potion worked better than I expected.”<br />
<br />
“But now the humans will reject you forever,” said Andre.<br />
<br />
“That is not so bad. I think I’ll love being an Argonian. Because now we can be together forever,” said Melissa, spreading her restored legs to reveal the slit between, which was getting glossy with moisture.<br />
<br />
“I’ve waited so long for you to say that,” said Andre, “I’ve yearned for your love for so long.” He was definitely getting aroused by the display. Now only was his dick getting hard, but his dewlap was extended in full courtship display.<br />
<br />
“You always had my love,” said Melissa, “But now you may have my body.”<br />
<br />
Andre wasted little time with taking his costume off. Melissa was rather impressed by his reptilian rod, but he was virile all over. She was eager to feel that inside of her. Andre approached the bed she lay on and positioned himself over her. “Er…I’m a bit new at this,” said Andre.<br />
<br />
“Actually, so am I,” said Melissa, “But I think we can figure it out on our own. Just push into me and we’ll get started.”<br />
<br />
Andre nodded before carefully lowering down onto her. Melissa gave a hiss as his head went past her lower lips and deep into her. There was pain, but it soon faded to pleasure. Once Andre was sure he wasn’t going to slip out, he started thrusting into her. Melissa moaned, feeling a tingle all over her body. But then she looked up at Andre and asked, “Uh, Andre, are you getting bigger?”<br />
<br />
Andre blinked before noticing his hands were getting larger and his considerable muscles were growing even bigger. He looked down at Melissa and noticed something else. “You’re getting bigger too,” he said, his voice sound a little deeper.<br />
<br />
Melissa looked to see her breasts were actually growing bigger. That tingle wasn’t just the pleasure of sex. It was her body getting bigger and muscles getting stronger. “We’re double-dosing,” she said, her voice sounding slightly different, “I forgot you were younger than me.”<br />
<br />
“I don’t think it matters now,” said Andre as his voice was getting deeper, “I haven’t felt like a normal boy for a long time. Even after I first converted, I didn’t feel much like a kid. Now I can be an adult for real.”<br />
<br />
Melissa put a hand against Andre’s broadening chest. “No, <i>we’ll</i> be adults for real,” she said. Andre leaned down to kiss his mate, thrusting even faster into her. Before long, they had hit their climax, but were far from satisfied.<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
The end results of their changes were very impressive. They had put on quite a bit of muscle mass with their second dose. They looked a lot like Anton and Marlysa, which wasn’t quite a surprise as anoles were relatives of iguanas. Melissa didn’t expect to get this ripped when she converted, but she wasn’t going to complain. This actually gave the opportunity to do something she had wanted to do for a while.<br />
<br />
“You don’t have to do this,” said Andre, holding the camera to record this.<br />
<br />
Melissa was holding her motorbike helmet between her hands. She was wearing a sports bra and low-riding pants to show off her new muscles. “Well, this thing’s not going to fit on my head anyways,” said Melissa, “And I’d like to show that I’m moving past my old identity, particularly my ex.”<br />
<br />
“I mean you don’t have to do this with your bare hands,” said Andre, “You could just use a sledgehammer.”<br />
<br />
“I want to show off my new strength,” said Melissa, “And I should be more than strong enough to crush this thing.”<br />
<br />
“If you insist,” said Andre before he started recording.<br />
<br />
Melissa squeezed her hands together. Her helmet buckled a little before it started to give in. Melissa pushed more pressure on it before it fully crumpled. Now nobody would be able to wear this helmet. “That was more satisfying than I thought,” she said.<br />
<br />
Andre wasn’t sure if Melissa had to put a lot of effort into crushing the helmet or if she was drawing it out to show off. “Too bad you can’t go for bike rides now,” he said.<br />
<br />
“You mean I can’t go for bike rides <i>yet</i>,” said Melissa, “I’m pretty sure there’s going to be a motorcycle company who will be interested in getting me as a spokesmodel and building a new bike that I can ride.” She looked at her Amazonian body and said, “I did get bigger than I expected.”<br />
<br />
“I like bigger,” said Andre.<br />
<br />
Melissa smiled at him and said, “I do too.”</p>
