<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Laura&#39;s challenging of Nathan&#39;s acting ability worked. Nathan decided that if he thought of himself as still male and concentrated on the fact that he was just playing a role, albeit with the greatest costume job ever imaginable, he could go out and face Nina. He resolved to be polite and say hello to Nina and thank her for the clothes she had bought over. He would pretend to be the 16 year old girl he appeared to be.<br />
<br />
Nathan followed Laura back out to the lounge. His legs turned to jelly as he caught sight of Nina. &#39;Hi you must be Nina. I&#39;m Libby&#39; he said the lines he had been rehearsing in his mind. It just didn&#39;t seem right how high pitched his voice now was.<br />
<br />
Nina looked up and saw the cute blonde teenager &#39;Hi there Libby. Laura told me you had lost your luggage and asked me to bring some clothes over for you. As you can see. My wardrobe needed a good clean out so I have bought plenty for you to choose from&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Why thanks Nina, There&#39;s no need though&#39; Nathan had just glimpsed the pile of bright coloured garments on the table.<br />
<br />
&#39;Nonsense&#39; said Laura. &#39;Her luggage has gone missing and Libby only has the clothes she is currently wearing. I forgot to ask you what size feet you have Libby. Nina has bought over some shoes. You should see if they fit you&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;They are a few pairs that are a size too small for me. I&#39;ve tried wearing them but end up with blisters. You are welcome to them. If they don&#39;t fit you they will go to charity&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Here try these on&#39; said Laura. Nathan turned to see Laura holding a pair of pink high heels. &#39;Take a seat and I&#39;ll do up the straps&#39; <br />
<br />
Nathan&#39;s instinct was to say &quot;No way!&quot; but the acting challenge Laura had set him kicked in. He took a seat on a stool and watched as Laura, who as a student had worked in a shoe store put the pumps on his now dainty feminine feet. The shoes had long straps that wound around Nathans ankles.  <br />
<br />
&#39;They are a perfect fit!&#39; exclaimed Laura. &#39;Now you have a pair of Roman heels&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;I don&#39;t know if I could walk in them&#39; said Nathan. &#39;I&#39;ve never worn heels that high&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;You&#39;re kidding aren&#39;t you?&#39; said an astonished looking Nina &#39;Didn&#39;t you ever dress up in your mum&#39;s clothes. Those heels aren&#39;t high. There are two pairs in that box that make that pair look flat&#39;<br />
<br />
Laura explained to Nina &#39;Libby&#39;s parents were rather conservative. They frowned on her dressing up. She&#39;s a bit of a tom boy&#39; She then turned to Nathan &#39;Why don&#39;t you practice walking in them. Just remember land on the heel first&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Well maybe the clothes I bought over for Libby won&#39;t be suitable. There is nothing in that pile that would suit a Tomboy. Mind you, you don&#39;t look like a typical Tomboy. You have such a pretty face and your hairstyle is very feminine&#39; Nina went on to explain how she had bought over clothes that reminded her of her ex &#39;He liked me to dress very girly. I just want to get rid of everything that reminds me of him&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;I&#39;m sure Libby is very grateful for everything you have bought over&#39; replied Laura on Nathan&#39;s behalf. &#39;Do you have a dress that would go with those heels? Libby has been wearing those leggings for over a day and I&#39;m sure she would like to put on something a little more appealing&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Well I last wore those shoes with this dress&#39; said Nina picking up a white dress. See the colour of the flowers on the bodice matches the shoes&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Try it on Libby&#39; said Laura &#39;By the time you have changed I&#39;ll have dinner ready&#39; Laura turned to Nina. &#39;You said you bought over some bra&#39;s and panties. Libby will need them&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Sure. In this bag. They should fit. I&#39;d say we are about the same size. Don&#39;t worry Libby they are unworn. My ex kept gifting me lingerie. They are a bit risque but they are clean&#39;<br />
<br />
Nathan found the bag of underwear and the white dress handed to him simultaneously. He/she accepted them silently. Determined to prove to Laura that he was a good actor he turned and still quite wobbly in the heels walked back to his room. Laura was right. If he was going to survive for 12 weeks as a teenage girl then he needed to get used to wearing female clothes and interacting with people as a girl. &quot;You can do this&quot; he told himself.<br />
<br />
Back in the room he emptied the contents of the bag. Out tumbled assorted pastel coloured lingerie. There were bras and panties amongst other items. If Nathan wasn&#39;t mistaken that red thing was a corset and it seemed to have a matching suspender belt. Nathan felt himself blushing. He found a lacy white bra and pantie set that still had its label attached. It seemed to be about the plainest of the the lingerie. It would have to do.<br />
<br />
Once more Nathan undressed. Luckily the legging were stretchy and he was able to take them off without removing the shoes. He knew he would have been incapable of doing up the straps properly.<br />
<br />
He was able to put the panties on with the shoes still on as well. They had a little bow over the crotch. The lack of a bulge and the snug fit reminded Nathan that his body was now 100% female.<br />
<br />
He took off the top and once more his boobs were released. They were large but not in the least droopy. He struggled initially to put the bra on but then remembered watching a former girlfriend dress. He reversed the bra, did up the clip then twisted the item back around the right way.He then put his arms through the arm holes and which lifted the cups over his breasts. Immediately he felt the relief of having the weight of the breasts supported. He filled out the bra very nicely. He was now the same size as Nina.<br />
<br />
He now put on the dress. It had a zip up the side. It was made of a satin like material and had a pink floral pattern on the bodice and around the hem. It was a short dress and only came to midway down his thighs. It accentuated his skinny waist and broad hips. Looking in the mirror it was getting harder to think of himself as a &quot;He&quot;</p>
