<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The first changes were subtle as the women left their mid 20s and entered their early 20s. Their skin began to glow with youth as they slowly began to relive their college years in reverse. &quot;I can&#39;t believe we&#39;re graduating from college in two weeks,&quot; a now 22 year old Mary Elise stated as she absent-mindedly pushed the strap of her sundress onto her shoulder. Her auburn hair began to take a more reddish tone. &quot;Forget that,&quot; Mika said as she slipped from 22 to 21. &quot;I haven&#39;t spent the last 18 years going to school just to go to college right away!  I want to see the world!.&quot; Mika brushed her ebony bangs out of her eyes and adjusted her flowing purple sundress.. For some reason it seemed to fit poorly around her hips and chest. She wondered if the exercise she had started was beginning to work. &quot;What about you Claudia?&quot;<br />
<br />
Katie glanced over at a now 20 year old Claudia. Her clothes were  beginning to  she was beginning to swallow her up, the sleeves of her blouse slid just past her wrists. Her body continued to youthen and Katie could she that she was a slender teenage beauty, probably a cheerleader in high school. &quot;School was fun but I&#39;ve got bigger plans,&quot; she said. &quot;I didn&#39;t tell you guys but I was approached by a modeling agency. They want me to participate in a couple of their shoots. My folks already checked into it and its legit.&quot; &quot;That&#39;s awesome,&quot; 19 year old Tricia stated adjusting her now overly large dress. Tricia&#39;s body was beginning to slim out considerably her d cups had shrunk to c cups and her hips and rear began to flatten. Although curvy for a teenager she was no where near the curvaceous beauty of a few minutes before. &#39;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; 18 year old Samantha questioned. &quot; I mean we&#39;re about to finish high school. We&#39;ve got our whole lives ahead of us.&quot; Samantha adjusted her dress, which a moment before covered only up to her thighs and now was starting to brush he knees.  She kicked her sandals back onto her feet as they seemed to slip of her foot. &quot;Huh,&quot; she thought. &quot;I really must not of been paying attention when I got dressed. These look like moms.&quot; The 17 year old shrugged and continued to talk with her friends.<br />
<br />
Katie watched changes that occurred as the women left their 17th year and became 16. The mature faces of their twenties was replaced with youthful teenage faces. Katie noticed the the women were now getting shorter as they aged backwards. Katie marveled as the grew shorter millimeter by millimeter in short bursts. &quot;Hey Katie,&quot; Mika exclaimed. &quot;It&#39;s great your Mom is out of town and we could come here to drink.  We can&#39;t go out to bars or anything else.&quot; Katie was shocked by the youthful tone in her 16 soon to be 15 year old friend.  &quot;I think theirs a party that the seniors are holding later on in the woods. Whose up for keg beer and cute guys?&quot; The other girls gave embarrassed and giddy laughter. &quot;Come on Mika,&quot; 15 year old Claudia exclaimed. &quot;None of us are old enough to drive.Besides were only freshmen the seniors don&#39;t want to be with us.&quot; &quot;Yeah well that&#39;s because the quarterback wants to date you,&quot; 15 year old Samantha gasped. &quot;Admit it!  You want to kiss him under the bleachers!&quot; The girls squealed with delight and began talking quickly about maybe finally kissing a high school boy.<br />
<br />
Katie marveled at what was happening as she watched the girls re-enter their 14th year, leaving high school behind and entering junior high. Most of the girls bodies had regressed to a point where hips were barely flared and breasts had been reduced to a and small b cups. Only Tricia maintained a sizable bust size but that to was quickly disappearing. The sound of something falling to the floor. Glancing down Katie noticed that Mikas shoes had fallen to the floor leaving her barefoot. 13 year old Mika was the shortest and youngest looking of the group a fact Claudia kept reminding her of much to her chagrin. Her toes were now the only thing touching the floor, which upset her slightly. She tried to slip her tiny feet back into her cavernous shoes to no avail. Sighing she tucked her thin legs under her now cavernous sundress. Katie looked at the others there shoes were barely hanging onto their shrinking feet. There feet also were beginning to slowly lift off the floor.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey you okay Katie,&quot; 12 year old Mary Elise asked. &quot;You look a little pale.&quot; Katie glanced at red haired girl in front of her. A spattering of freckles now covered her nose and cheeks. The sundress she wore hung on her like a sack and she continually had to push her hat up as it slid over her head. Katie smiled not just at her comical appearance but her kind words. Mary Elise at any age seemed to be a kind and gentle soul. &quot;I&#39;m fine thanks,&quot; Katie said. Mary Elise smiled pushing the useless straps back on her diminutive shoulders.&quot;That&#39;s good.  It was nice of our parents to let us sleep over at your house!  You&#39;re the best babysitter ever,&quot; Mary Elise started before glancing towards the floor. Her beach sandals had fallen off her feet, which dangled slightly of the floor. Scooting up in her chair Mary Elise placed her bare feet on the floor choosing not to put on her overly large shoes.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t believe we&#39;re going to be in junior high next year,&quot; 11 year old Samantha exclaimed while trying to push the straps of her swimsuit up. &quot;Do you think the teachers will be nice?&quot; &quot;Who cares,&quot; 11 year old Claudia exclaimed. &quot;I can&#39;t wait to go to the junior high dances.&quot; Katie smiled watching Claudia. The robe the 11 year old wore hung down past her knees with the sleeves going several inches past her hands. Although not much taller than Mika Katie thought she looked like a girl you would see in those child beauty pageants. Even at this young age it was apparent the little blond girl was boy crazy. <br />
<br />
As the girls left there 11th year and stopped at their 10th Katie looked at disbelief what lay in front of her. Mary Elise was a skinny girl with straight red hair and a cute face spattered with freckles. Claudia with her long blonde hair angelic face and firecracker attitude. Tricia with shoulder length black and flawless milk chocolate. she was also the tallest of the group. Samantha with brown hair almost falling to her waist with a beautiful childish face that belied her renewed innocence. Mika with shoulder length black hair and a cute childish face. She always wanted to prove she belonged to make up for her small size. Finally Katie looked at her former mom, former big sister Kellie. Kellie was much smaller than all the other girls.  She stood on tiptoe in her oversized dress, peering into the room like any little sister wanting to join the other girls.  The others seemed purposely aware of her but ignoring her at the same time.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Come on girls!  Let&#39;s do our nails.   Miss Katie, where&#39;s your nail polish?&quot;  <br />
<br />
Katie blinked and looked at them.  She was now the eldest, the only adult, and now the others saw her as a babysitter for themselves and her little sister.  Katie smiled.  She&#39;d taken a group of adults and made them normal little girls at a sleepover.  The question was to join them at their age...or stay as she was.</p>
