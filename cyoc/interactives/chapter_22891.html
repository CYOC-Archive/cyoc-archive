<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><p>"Jack, look outside and see if anyone is around," Trevor said.</p>

<p>Jack nodded. She ran over to the door leading into the change room, cracked it open and peered out. She didn’t see anyone. After closing the door, Jack looked down at her body.</p>

<p><i>It would be a shame to leave this place without seeing what I look like under these clothes.</i></p>

<p>She walked back over to the donkey and Trevor. Grabbing a lock of her hair, she twirled it around her right hand. “I’ve been thinking,” she said.</p>

<p>“What?” Trevor asked.</p>

<p>The donkey brayed. <i>Man, that thing is huge. Is it just me or does it smell kinda bad?</i> Jack couldn’t help but wonder what was going on inside the donkey’s mind. If she and Trevor escaped the island and they didn’t change back, they’d just have to go through life as females. She didn’t like the idea of getting boyfriends or having to deal with having a certain time of the month. However, she found it amusing that all she had to do was stand naked in front of a mirror in order to see a naked woman.</p>

<p>“If we’re going to get out of here, shoulden't we at least see what these bodies can do before we lose them?” Jack asked.</p>

<p>The donkey brayed and Trevor looked at Jack with wide eyes. “You’re joking right?”</p>

<p>Jack looked in the direction of showers that she noticed were in the room and thought of the other showers. “There’s something I need to do.”</p>

<p>“Jack, where are you…”</p>

<p>Jack had run out of the room before Trevor could say more. Doing her best to hold down giggling and watching her chest jiggle as she ran across the beach, Jack made a beeline for the shower that she and Trevor had been around before. She found the entrance to it and walked right on in.</p>

<p>She felt a little guilty for what she was about to do but the prospect of seeing all those naked women was too much for her to resist.</p>

<p>Feeling the mist from the showers, Jack smiled. She was really getting away with this! She felt a strange sensation between her legs that excited her.</p>

<p>“Is there room for one more? It’s warm out there and I’m all sweaty, I could use a shower,” Jack said.</p>

<p>“Sure, no problem,” a voice said.</p>

<p>Jack stripped all of her clothing and threw it to the ground. She walked by a mirror as she approached the entrance to the shower stalls and gasped. She turned and looked at her reflection.</p>

<p><i>I’m freaking hot!</i></p>

<p>Normally, this would be the ultimate humiliation; Jack however knew that this place was about having fun where one could ignore negativity. She shortly forgot about that kid that was turned into a donkey when she heard a voice.</p>

<p>“You coming or not?”</p>

<p>Jack turned and walked into the stalls. Through the steam in the area, she saw eight gorgeous naked women.<i> To hell with that kid, this is too hot to pass up!</i></p>

<p>“Isn’t this place great!” the woman closest to Jack said. She had long red hair and an incredibly body. Jack tried not to stare and found herself shaking as she forced herself to look at the other’s eyes.</p>

<p>“Yeah; there’s so much to do!” Jack said.</p>

<p>She turned and walked over to an empty showerhead where a bottle of body wash awaited her. Jack turned the shower on all while sneaking looks at the other women there.</p>

<p>Pouring some of the wash onto her body, she started massaging it into her skin. She gasped as she massaged it into onto her breasts.<i> Oh man, if being female feels this good, I don’t want to change back.</i> Doing her best to not moan in enjoyment, Jack washed the rest of her body.</p>

<p>She closed her eyes as she reached where her manhood used to be. She opened her right eye and risked a look back. Two of the women were talking, water glistened off their bodies and soap dripped down their skin. Their long hair stuck to their skin. If only Trevor knew what she was missing.</p>

<p>Jack’s mind swam with lust from the scene and she felt what was left of her inhibitions slipping away as she slipped her right index and middle fingers into her body. As she moaned in ecstasy, she felt a tingle just above her rear end. She ignored it and kept probing until she heard a scream.</p>

<p><i>Oh crap, what was I doing?</i></p>

<p>She withdrew her fingers and turned to see two of the women pointing in her direction.</p>

<p>“Sorry, I didn’t mean to….”</p>

<p>“She has a tail!” someone screamed.</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” Jack asked.</p>

<p>She turned around, wondering if one of the other women was turning into a donkey like that boy had. Her ears started to tingle as the sound from the other showers increased. Another woman screamed.</p>

<p>“Hey come on, that hurts!” Jack said as she held her … ears.</p>

<p><i>Hey, what’s going on?</i> Instead of finding human ears at the sides of her head, she found long hairy ears. That could only mean. <i>Oh shit, what have I done?</i></p>

<p>Her skin started tingling as she felt around her rear end only to find her tail. She grasped it and brought it around to her front. Sure enough, a long grey furred tail had sprouted from her body.</p>

<p>Jack turned around hoping someone would help her. Unfortunately, the sight of the other naked women was still exciting her, which only seemed to hasten the changes to her body. One by one, the other women ran from the shower as grey fur grew all over Jack’s body.</p>

<p><i>Okay, I just have to stay calm, I just have to focus and it’ll all go away.</i></p>

<p>Unfortunately, it didn’t work. Within a minute, a pelt of grey fur had covered Jack’s body. She ran around the showers, nearly slipping as she called for help.</p>

<p>“Come on, this isn’t supposed to happen to me. I just wanted to have a little fun. Hello?” she cried out.</p>

<p>Now her face, hands, and even feet started tingling. These changes were not going to stop. Jack knew she was going to end up just like that kid, only, <i>female</i>. Suddenly, what seemed like a game was anything but. Unlike a game, there was no strategy guide. She couldn’t save and then reload if something went wrong. She couldn’t ask a friend that had played that level for help. She couldn’t turn the game off and move on once it was time to stop. No, this for her was reality.</p>

<p>She tried to run out of the showers as her fingernails began to grow over her fingers. She felt dizzy as her feet started to elongate and arch up as her toenails enveloped her toes. Finally, she slipped and fell over; she broke her fall with hands that were more or less hooves. They clomped on the ceramic floor.</p>

<p><i>No, no no! I’m too smart for this to happen to me!</i></p>

<p>Jack felt a flash as her body changed mercilessly. Every decision she’d ever made in life had in a sense, led up to this moment. She felt her belly gain mass as her breasts vanished into her chest. Every hope and desire bred from how others reacted to her and what she saw and did throughout her life had branched out into this point. The bones in her head and face cracked as they grew into the muzzle of a donkey.</p>

<p>“Come on, someone help me,” she said. Her voice was deeper and she found it harder to speak, as though English were becoming a second language to her. She had to think about each word as she spoke it.</p>

<p>Her tail beat back and forth. She started smelling like a wet animal as the showers dampened her fur.</p>

<p>“This … isn’t … funny!” Now the words were growing almost impossible to say.</p>

<p>Her face was growing longer by the second. She managed to stand on what were now four legs; four donkey legs complete with hooves. She felt the weight of her large donkey belly and did her best to hold back tears.</p>

<p>She walked out of the showers and over to the mirror. Where before, it had reflected a beautiful body, it now reflected that of a donkey. She felt and saw the final changed to her head and face.</p>

<p><i>No, no, no!</i></p>

<p>She tried to call for help but only brayed. She did her best to think of the words but they just wouldn’t come to her. In fact, everything around her seemed to lose meaning. Showers, stalls, mirrors, they were now just objects without names.</p>

<p>As Jack realised her mind was becoming that of the beast whose body she now occupied, she brayed out. Everything in her life had lead to this moment. Everything went fuzzy as more primal desires and thoughts sprang to life from deep within her.</p>

<p>Hope of escape was still there. Jack knew she had to get out of there. The desire however was more of a panic now. She had to find that other donkey and her friend!</p></p>
