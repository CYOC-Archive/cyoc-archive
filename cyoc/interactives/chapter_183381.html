<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff and Matt showered together in silence at first. Occasionally Jeff would fondle parts of his dad’s body, and without knowing why, Matt was compelled to allow him. Jeff even insisted on washing Matt’s lower body by himself. Not because Matt had poor hygiene or anything, just as another way of lathering him up and playing with his parts. Matt wanted to protest when Jeff started fingering him while washing his asshole, but he couldn’t. Jeff felt like a kid in a candy shop while Matt felt confused but aroused. Matt even popped a boner from being fingered, even though he had just blown a load in Jeff. The prostate stimulation from his young husband was undeniably good.<br />
<br />
After their shower, Jeff went to chill at a friend’s house for the day. Matt spent all day looking for whatever cursed object or alien ray that must’ve caused these reality changes that seemingly only he could detect. He was about to give up when Jeff was 10 minutes from arriving home from his friend’s house, when all of the sudden he noticed the computer that Jeff had in the master bedroom. He discovered a program that had logged changes which seemed to be the culprit of these strange occurrences. Did this mean that Jeff had intentionally created these changes? The thought of his son doing all of this just to treat him as a play toy sickened him.<br />
<br />
Matt tried to think of a way to get back at Jeff. He thought about transforming him an adult woman. The reason this particular transformation seemed unappealing to Matt was because his sexuality was still set for gay and attracted to Jeff’s body. In fact, any scenario in which Matt would lose access to touching Jeff’s body seemed really unappealing. Finally as Jeff got home, Matt knew what he wanted to do with this chronivac program that he had discovered.<br />
<br />
“Hey lover, I’m home,” said Jeff as he walked into the master bedroom.<br />
<br />
“Not your lover for long!” Exclaimed Matt, hitting the submit button on the chronivac.<br />
<br />
Instantly the two men were looking from the opposite perspective. Matt had switched their bodies! Now he could fondle this Jeff body he was in, guilt free, and not be forced to be used by his horny son.<br />
<br />
“Oh this body is fuckin’ hot,” said Matt, molesting his new body all over, “Now you can’t make me do anything, because I’m attracted to the body I’m in, instead of yours! I read all the chronivac history, it’s sick that you’d use me like a cheap sex toy. So now I’m gonna treat this body how you were treating that one, son. Or I guess I should say dad now haha.”<br />
<br />
“Is this supposed to be a punishment?” Asked Jeff, “You’re forgetting that I’m attracted to the body you put me in as well. I never even thought about switching our consciousnesses, this is kinky,” said Jeff, stripping his new hairy, slightly fat body.<br />
<br />
Jeff had his new body down to just the tighty whities his dad was wearing under his pants. He was looking in the mirror, playing with his nipples and rubbing his asshole through the briefs, making pouty sexy looks in his dad’s lush of a body.<br />
<br />
Matt was too preoccupied with his own pleasure. He had realized his mistake, that Jeff wasn’t being punished by this package at all, but yet he didn’t care. He was all caught up in checking out his new teen hood in the mirror, especially his pink hole with only light hair.<br />
<br />
Jeff typed something up quickly on the computer. “There. Now you can’t use the chronivac again unless you know the password,” he said, excited that he could keep his dad’s body for as long as he wanted.<br />
<br />
“Well then, have fun in this sexless ‘marriage’,” said Matt, still playing with his hole.<br />
<br />
“You know, just because you have the literal ability to turn down my sexual advances again, doesn’t mean you have the physical strength to do that,” said Jeff, darkly.<br />
<br />
“You wouldn’t!” Said Matt, who had realized his mistake. By putting Jeff into his former body, he had given him a huge size advantage. There was no way that Matt’s current little teenage arms were going to be able to stop Jeff’s big brutish body.<br />
<br />
Jeff grabbed his former wrists, forcing Matt onto the bed. Matt was terrified, but the multiple stacked taboos made the experience so erotic. He actually wanted Jeff to fuck him with his former dick, by force. Whether he wanted to or not, Jeff grabbed a bottle of lube within arm’s reach, and started pouring some onto Matt’s pink hole. He put two fingers in at once, to acclimate his dad’s new boy pussy to some pressure. They slid in with ease.<br />
<br />
Jeff grabbed his former ankles and pulled his dad’s now light body to the edge of the bed. He penetrated his former hole with his cock this time. <br />
<br />
Matt’s face had gone from anger to ecstasy. He was looking in the mirror, watching his new body get raped, and the scene was erotic as fuck to him. He came himself about forty five minutes in, without even touching his new dick.<br />
<br />
Jeff turned up the pace and came in Matt just after Matt had come. “Looks like it won’t be a sexless marriage afterwards, ‘son’”, said Jeff, kissing his dad’s teenage lips.</p>
