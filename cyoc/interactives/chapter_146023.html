<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Things were relatively quiet for Herman and Jason as they settled into a new life and routine in Animalia. For the moment, it was mostly to keep going through with their acclimation classes and working through along with some of the other things they&#39;d found developing after their conversions. They were grateful to have their Herpes cured through Project Phoenix, which Horizon told them was also a further development in the sort of wonder drug that the Animalia Virus was becoming. Of course, there was the fact that it also came with the price of giving up one&#39;s humanity, and both Herman and Jason knew from past experience that there would always be people that would never accept something because of their own biases. <br />
<br />
And some conflict over that was also there between Herman and Jason, even after changing their surnames to Oceanroar and Clearwake. The pair had been in a long and stable homosexual relationship for years, and even in California, there were those that had issues with same sex couples. One person who knew them personally even sent a note that they&#39;d gotten what they deserved after they contracted Herpes. But they&#39;d managed to carry on and did find some friends who were more understanding, and it was with their help and encouragement that had made coming to Lyre/Animalia, if only for their conversion. Their choices in species differed, but they had agreed to remain a same sex couple, which meant that they wouldn&#39;t violate Animalia&#39;s Edicts with regard to breeding.<br />
<br />
However, they also soon found that the influx of animal instincts that were often more designed to breed and create their next generation were there with them. It had made both of them feel a bit more interested in women in ways that they&#39;d never felt before. At times it was embarrassing for the two men, because they had committed themselves to each other. Thankfully, groups like Homosexuals Anonymous had been there to help them with that, and ultimately helped them get through that and stay true to who they were.<br />
<br />
&quot;What smells so good?&quot; said Jason as he came into the kitchen to find Herman at the stove. The scent of something delicious had drifted all through their present apartment that they had been awarded with attending their acclimation classes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Salmon,&quot; Herman answered with a smile, &quot;does that get your taste buds watering?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It does,&quot; Jason replied as he approached Herman and nuzzled the side of Herman&#39;s head and neck with his chin. <br />
<br />
Herman could feel the rough skin of his partner, but despite the Great White&#39;s reputation as a vicious killer, Jason was still quite gentle and that made many of their tactile interactions quite pleasant. And as Jason looked over Herman&#39;s shoulder toward the salmon fillets that Herman was cooking, Herman thought back with some fondness at their double dosing...<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
It took a day or two for them to get the full results from Lyre/Animalia&#39;s hospital with regard to whether or not there was any Herpes in their system. The call and report that the virus was completely gone was excellent news, and Jason and Herman were soon on their way back to Horizon with every intent on having the vaccine for the Animalia Virus counteracted. It would mean a visit to the changing room again, as US law had it that every Animalian had to be vaccinated outside of the controlled areas at Horizon, but the pair had been comfortable with that.<br />
<br />
&quot;This will be great!&quot; Jason said with some eagerness as the Horizon Labs building came into view, &quot;We&#39;ll get to be together in every possible way... and I can&#39;t wait!&quot;<br />
<br />
Herman watched as Jason twirled in front of him, and he could easily notice the bulge in his pants where Jason&#39;s claspers were clearly growing erect and pressing against the pants he was wearing in anticipation of what would happen after vaccine for the Animalia Virus was counteracted. Herman was eager for it too, though a part of him was a bit embarrassed by the fact that Jason was so willing to take the risk. He knew that Animalians tended to be more sexually open than Humans and more tolerant when it came to same sex couples in many ways, even if homosexuality was more a concept from converted humans than with uplifted animals, he had noticed that Animalians did at least try to keep their sexual liaisons private. They weren&#39;t openly advertising it. And judging by the size of the bulge that Jason&#39;s claspers were making, it would be difficult to hide what was intended, even from normal Humans.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m interested too... but don&#39;t you think you could wait till we actually get there before putting a bulge in your pants?&quot; Herman said slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;d be no fun,&quot; Jason answered, giving Herman a clear indication that the debate would get them nowhere. Especially as he also knew that he was looking forward to it as well.<br />
<br />
From there they made their way to the Horizon Labs building and reported in on what they wanted. The process was a fairly routine one and somewhat repetitive from the paperwork that related to their initial conversion. They had to present paperwork that they&#39;d gotten via email that confirmed what the doctors had told them about their tests from the Hospital and that they were there for their second dose. And since they weren&#39;t elderly and already in their prime, the method for their second dose of the Animalia Virus was listed as through sex. Which the secretary seemed to recognize when she could also see the bulge in Jason&#39;s pants.<br />
<br />
They were eventually lead into one of the transformation rooms, where one of Horizon&#39;s technician&#39;s then administered the shots that removed the vaccine in their system. It was only after the technician left the room that Jason and Herman looked to each other.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... here we are,&quot; Jason said slowly came toward Herman, &quot;ready to give each other their second dose.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Herman answered as they hugged and then managed something of a kiss.<br />
<br />
It was passionate, and Herman was eager for it. In fact he was just as eager for the passion that had been building since their initial transformations. Though there was some caution, as Jason&#39;s triangular teeth were razor sharp and Herman wanted to be careful as not to slice his own tongue on them. As their tongues wrestled with each other, there was also something that Herman also noticed. Jason seemed to maneuver his tongue so that Herman&#39;s tongue wasn&#39;t in any position to be cut by Jason&#39;s teeth. That made Herman happy and the two kissed ever more passionately as they made their way toward the bed with each other&#39;s hands moving to begin undoing the other&#39;s clothing.<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
And that first time together as Animalians had been wonderful. There had been some concern, as Jason&#39;s claspers was not one shaft as Herman&#39;s penis was, and Herman had had some concern that mating between them would be difficult and perhaps painful because of some of the anatomical differences between Mammals and Fish, particularly with regard to Cetaceans and Sharks specifically. However, things had worked out well enough, and Herman was greatly pleased that Jason was gentle in more ways than one. To Herman&#39;s surprise, Jason also felt greatly pleased that Herman remained calm and passionate, and not turning aggressive, which some scientists had reported on with regard to Orca actively preying on Great Whites when the two species lived in the same area.<br />
<br />
&quot;How long until they&#39;re ready?&quot; Jason asked as he looked to see the salmon fillets cooking in the pan that Herman had them in.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not too long,&quot; Herman answered, listening to his partner and bond-mate sniff at the cooking salmon, &quot;so... if you want to help, you can get the plates and then we can have breakfast.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Couldn&#39;t we do something else?&quot; Jason asked teasingly.<br />
<br />
&quot;If we do that... your breakfast will be burnt,&quot; Herman reminded him, &quot;and besides, we have some acclimation classes today, not to mention that I have some research to do to see if anyone would want me to put on a show...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re thinking on joining the Meat Market?&quot; Jason teased.<br />
<br />
&quot;No... nothing sexual,&quot; Herman answered, &quot;You&#39;re the only man that I&#39;d dance that way for... and while some women have looked better now... YOU are still the one that I love. It&#39;d be more aerobic and styled... like ballet and gymnastics combined with water.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Synchronized swimming,&quot; Jason grumbled as he moved to one of the counters to collect some of the plastic plates they had for the apartment.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey... don&#39;t knock it until you try it,&quot; Herman answered, &quot;besides I met someone at the Coliseum&#39;s pools who teaches some of that sort of stuff. Shows that many Animalians like it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And how many Humans will?&quot; Jason reminded him, &quot;remember that we&#39;re still paying rent on an apartment in LA and technically speaking, we still have jobs there that we&#39;re presently on leave from. Which means at some point we will need to return to LA...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Which is why I have some calls to make, see if my &quot;Sea World&quot; idea with an Animalian would work,&quot; Herman answered, &quot;which means we&#39;ll have a lot to do.&quot;</p>
