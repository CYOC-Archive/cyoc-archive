<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">To say that Jess felt weird was an understatment.  Not ten seconds ago, she was a normal 18-year-old girl, albeit with a copy of her conciousness in her vagina.  And now, thanks to the Chronivac, she had changed herself into a male dalmation taur, and duplicated her conciousness between the taur and the taur&#39;s sheath.  Judging by the strange feeling of her body, the lack of arms and legs, and the overall nothingness that seems to surround her, it&#39;s a safe bet that she wound up as the body part, this time.  It&#39;s so surreal.  Is this what it was like for the conciousness she sent into her vagina?<br />
<br />
There was definitely a lot to take in, but knowing she only had a few minutes before her conciousness would rejoin with the dalmation taur&#39;s, she did what she could.  She could feel that her back was attached to the dalmation taur&#39;s belly.  Her mouth felt like it went through where whole body, and she could feel it was full of something.  That something was a dog&#39;s penis.  As a human, she most definitely wouldn&#39;t put a dog&#39;s penis in her mouth!  But she&#39;s a sheath, now.  She is the home for this penis.  She couldn&#39;t take it out of her mouth even if she wanted to.<br />
<br />
Whoa!  Trying to prove her wrong, there!  Jess felt motion as the penis started forcing itself out the opening of her mouth.  It reminded her of sticking out her tongue, except this organ was a lot more stiff, and she felt no senstation from it.  It was almost like a foreign object.  Also, it definitely wasn&#39;t her tongue, because her sense of taste was lined around the inside of the mouth.  She could taste the penis within her.  And she could smell it outside her mouth.  So, the Chronivac randomly chose to give her both of those senses.  She wasn&#39;t sure she liked it.  There was this weird musk to the penis, both the smell and taste.  It definitely wasn&#39;t enjoyable, but it also wasn&#39;t awful.<br />
<br />
Still, she was kinda glad she wouldn&#39;t have to stay this way, for long.  As she felt the penis sink back into her mouth, she knew that she was likely moments away from joining with the dalmation taur&#39;s mind.<br />
<br />
Oh boy, wait&#39;ll her penis finds out that he was inside her for a bit, tomorrow!  And the dalmation taur!  He doesn&#39;t know she&#39;s his sheath, nor does he know he used to be both human and a female!  Gonna be fun mental trip when all their minds are joined back together.<br />
<br />
....Maybe she had underestimated how long five minutes actually was.  Those five minutes definitely feel long, when you&#39;ve found yourself in such a strange situation.  A part of her wished she had kept her sight, so she could watch the time.  But being under the belly of a dalmation taur, she probably wouldn&#39;t have been able to keep an eye on the time, anyway.<br />
<br />
....<br />
<br />
Jess was beginning to worry.  Her body began to lightly sway beneath the belly, the weight of the penis within her adding to the force of the motion.  With no sense of the world outside her body, she could only assume the taur was walking somewhere.  But, why was she still the taur&#39;s sheath?  The timer should have ran out, by now.  Did something happen?<br />
<br />
...Maybe her mom got home.  Yeah, that&#39;s probably it.  Her mom got home and the taur had to turn off the Chronivac for a bit.  But... what happens when the Chronivac is turned off?  Does it automatically resume after it&#39;s turned back on?  Yeah, probably.  She knows the Chronivac has failsafes in it.  That&#39;s probably one of them.  So all she has to do is wait for the dog taur to turn the Chronivac back on, and she&#39;ll be out of here.<br />
<br />
Jess wondered what her family must look like.  If reality changed to fit the dalmation taur, does that mean her family are dalmation taurs, too?  Is the whole world comprised of dalmation taurs instead of humans?<br />
<br />
There&#39;s the penis sticking out of her mouth, again.  She kinda wondered what was up with that.  The dog taur doesn&#39;t know he used to be female, so there shouldn&#39;t be a fascination with it.<br />
<br />
.....<br />
<br />
As the day went on, Jess began to accept that she might be stuck this way for a bit.  She began to regret leaving the dalmation taur unaware of her presence.  She had no idea why she was still a sheath, but without the dalmation taur&#39;s awareness, he had no knowledge to rush to get her out.<br />
<br />
And, the penis within her has no knowledge of her presence, either.  She didn&#39;t decide to become a sheath until after she had sent a copy of her conciousness into her vagina.  When those two minds join, they still won&#39;t know she&#39;s there.  Her only hope is that when the Chronivac is turned back on, the timer will resume and she&#39;ll find herself mentally combined with the taur.  But, what if it doesn&#39;t?  Well, the Chronivac will still know she&#39;s here.  It&#39;ll detect her.  Next time the taur uses it, he&#39;ll see her as an option and realize she needs to be pulled out.<br />
<br />
No telling how long before that&#39;ll happen, though.  Perhaps, not until tomorrow, when the penis is due to merge conciousness back to the taur.  For now, guess she&#39;d better start getting used to the tastes and smells of her current life.</p>
