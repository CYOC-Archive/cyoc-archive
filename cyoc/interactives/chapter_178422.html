<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jake and Brandon had stripped out of what clothes they were wearing by the time they reached the hot tub, sliding into the steamy water. Brandon was worried though, was he really ready for this. God, he needed to fuck something, more than he had every felt the urge to do so in his life, and something about Jake got his juices flowing. And for once he knew what that really meant as he could almost feel himself dripping between his legs.<br />
<br />
Once they were in the water, Jake was on top of him. Where the Jake he had been with yesterday seemed happy to be a bit more submissive and suck him off, this Jake was almost aggressive in his needs. He pulled Brandon onto his lap, fingers once more teasing that newly formed slit between his legs. Brandon held on to Jake&#39;s muscular shoulders, quivering at the feeling. He started to roll his hips, riding those thick fingers inside him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ready?&quot; Jake asked, though the expression on his face was hungry. Brandon nodded, he found himself lifted a little in the water, then felt the fat head of Jake&#39;s cock between his legs. It was sliding inside of him. He worried it was going to be too big for him, Jake was almost comically huge. It was tight, and he felt himself stretched over it, and while it hurt a little it felt like it fit, like it was meant to fit.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh fuck..&quot; Jake murmured, holding on to Brandon&#39;s hips as he thrust into him, pulling back a little and plowing in again. Brandon aided by rocking his own hips with the thrusting. Feeling that cock sliding in and out, filling him again and again, the cock sliding against his own oversized clit, sending jolts of pleasure through him. Jake&#39;s mouth found one of Brandon&#39;s large nipples, sucking and teasing it which just sent Brandon even closer to the edge. He felt fire rush through him as he experienced his first orgasm through his new equipment, gasping and panting. Though Jake didn&#39;t stop.<br />
<br />
He moved one hand and Brandon found fingers prying at his other hole. His eyes going wide as he felt those thick digits slip inside. He let out a moan, his ability for speech seemingly taken away as he felt both of his holes filled. It wasn&#39;t until he felt a second orgasm ripping through him that Jake finally came, Brandon could feel that huge cock twitching and pulsing inside of him, filling his belly with cum.<br />
<br />
Brandon fell against Jake&#39;s muscular chest, letting the other man go soft inside of him but not yet pulling free. The two simply lingered like that for a few moments, their mouths finding each other for a little post-coital kissing. &quot;I might just have to keep you around.&quot; Brandon murmured with a smile.<br />
<br />
Jake laughed. &quot;You&#39;d have to try hard to keep me away. Fuck if that wasn&#39;t the best sex I&#39;ve ever had.&quot; Jake probably didn&#39;t have a lick on the experiences Brandon had when it came to sex, but he found himself agreeing. Maybe it wasn&#39;t such a bad trade off after all.<br />
<br />
-------------------------------------<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes.&quot; Walter Jannes said into the phone as Brandon and Jake listened in on the other side. &quot;Your muscle growth is partially genetic. You overproduce the hormone responsible for growing muscle and burning fat. Just make sure you get plenty of calories and you should be fine. Just keep from exposing anyone for at least 72 hours, then you should be in the clear. I&#39;ll see if I can&#39;t work something to mitigate the effects, but I wouldn&#39;t hold your breath.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jannes hung up the phone and rubbed at his eyes. His glasses were giving him a headache. Or it could be looking through all his data and research again. Something here just wasn&#39;t adding up right. He looked up at a knock on his office door. It was open as Jannes had thought himself the only one in the building, but a young man was standing in the doorway trying to get his attention.<br />
<br />
&quot;I brought you lunch, Walt.&quot; The doctor smiled at his husband. Though he still had trouble after three years reconciling this young man as the man he first fell in love with. He had married a slightly portly Italian man a few years older than him, not this gym rat of a ginger who was young enough to be his son. Joel wore jeans that hugged his ass and a tank top that showed off his fit arms, the skin pale and freckled. His red hair was swept back today instead of styled. Joel took a lot more care with his appearance now than he had before. He had more of a sexual appetite than he did before, and Walter had trouble keeping up. He missed his old husband, but the pancreatic cancer had forced his hand, and the serum had done its job. He sauntered over and took a seat near Walter, setting down a insulated lunch bag on the table next to him. &quot;You&#39;ve been busy this weekend.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Its just these latest two. Both ended up with rare genetic conditions. There&#39;s something to it I just can&#39;t place my finger on it. Maybe the latest version of the serum awakens dormant genes.&quot; He rubbed his eyes under his glasses again. Maybe he needed to adjust his prescription. &quot;Why did you stay with me?&quot; Walter asked, looking at his husband. &quot;You could have your pick of men now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This again?&quot; Joel chided, taking a pair of sandwiches and some drinks out of the lunch bag. &quot;I love you, you&#39;re my husband and you saved my life. What sort of asshole would I be if I just threw out thirty years of us being together to get a little hot, young ass?&quot; He gave a little laugh. &quot;Though dying your hair is a nice touch, I like the gray myself, but it does make you look younger.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dye?&quot; Walter asked, shocked. He looked around for a reflective surface and picked up a metal tray, flipping it to get a look at himself. Jannes&#39; hair had years ago gone completely gray, but the hair on his head was now a deep, rich auburn. &quot;I didn&#39;t.&quot; Then another thought came to him and he took off his glasses. His eyes focused on his own reflection the image clearer than it was with the lenses. &quot;Shit. I think I got exposed.&quot; He set down the tray.<br />
<br />
He had thought of injecting himself eventually, joining his husband back in youth, but the results were too unpredictable. Instead, he ended up stupidly exposing himself at Brandon&#39;s house some how. &quot;I knew I should have worn a protective suit. Fuck..&quot; Walter ran his hands through his hair, a nervous habit. It even felt thicker.<br />
<br />
&quot;Walter. Walt. Walt!&quot; He felt two hands grip his face, strong arms forcing him to turn to look at Joel. &quot;Calm down, we will get through this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But the variables. We&#39;ve discussed...&quot; A finger pressed against Walt&#39;s lips. It probably looked silly, someone thirty years his junior seeming to order him around, but Joel had always been the strong thoughtful one in their relationship. <br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ll figure it out. First. I&#39;m taking you home.&quot; Walter motioned to his work station. He had more data to go over, now tests to run on himself, but Joel just quirked a brow.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine.&quot; Walter began to switch off his lab equipment, but he did grab a few files to bring home with him while Joel packed lunch back up. Together the walked to the car, but Jannes kept looking at himself in every reflective surface they passed. He knew the second hand exposure would be slower, but he was worried. It wasn&#39;t every day you had a new you forced on you. Especially since he knew more of what could happen than anyone.</p>
