<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Antonio crashed into an alleyway wall, the rain hammering down from high above, his back pressed firm against the wall as he looked down at a watch around his wrist, a gift from Emma after lady Rosewood had announced their partnership to all the girls and staff at the brothel.<br />
Flipping the face of the watch over it showed a small map of the city&#39;s middle level, and a red moving dot blinking as it moved along the marked train tracks, looking like it was around two blocks from his current location, in a panic Antonio checked his satchel, sighing in relief as he glimpsed the glinting of precious jem&#39;s and jewelry in the bottom, clasping the bag shut Antoni ducked down once again as a pair of red spotlights peered down the alleyway.<br />
<br />
Every muscle in Antonio&#39;s body froze solid as the beams swept the alleyway, the fear building in his chest like a lump of ice, it&#39;s frosty fingers dragging along his neck and arms, the hairs on his body standing up on end, until he couldn&#39;t take it any more and ran, a loud train horn like sound reverberating between the buildings, looking back Antonio came face to face with this city&#39;s law enforcement.<br />
<br />
A ten foot tall automaton began it&#39;s pursuit, it&#39;s mechanical limbs crashing to the ground with every step, a long black cloak over its shoulders and a black porcelain face, a large old fashioned police hat atop its head, and a pair of glowing red spotlight eyes.<br />
It carried a large batten in its hand as it charged him, it&#39;s gears and cogs clicking and screeching with each movement the machine made, like the screams of the dead echoing as it persued it&#39;s prey, Antonio looked all around as he rapidly approached a dead end, the wall slowly moving along however, another building on rails, over the past few months Antonio had learnt that many businesses buildings were on rails.<br />
<br />
Antonio stopped at the wall, looking around rapidly for anything he could use, he only saw a handful of objects scattered among the trash and other useless items, a pipe, a spring, a few gears, that paired with the iron, gears and piano keys in his inventory, yeah he could definitely work with this, hastily picking up the materials he needed, his eyes darting between his task and the approaching machine he stood up with his lifeline and closed his eyes<br />
<br />
[SKILL] Tinkerer [ACTIVE]<br />
<br />
all of the components in his hands began to levitate into the air, twisting, coiling, bending, slotting together, welding and snapping, untill finally in a flash of white light Antonio now held a peculiar looking walking cane in his hands, it had a handle on it similar to that of a door handle, a large gear underneath with a steam engine wheel styled piston attached, going into the iron cane, without a second thought, as if he knew exactly what this strange cane did, he pulled up on the handle and watched as a secondary handle popped out at the midpoint of the cane, and a small cross hairs in a gear sprung out from the base of the walking cane, in an instant he knew exactly what to do, pulling back on a bolt handle he opened the chamber and sprinkled some iron shavings into it, before sealing it up and taking aim at the mechanical law enforcement and pulled the trigger.<br />
________________________________________________<br />
<br />
What felt like hours later Antonio burst through the doors of the brothel, just as the train whistles blew, the building rocking forward as it began it&#39;s movement once again, the harsh sound of scraping metal and dripping water against the wooden floor behind his heavy footsteps, behind him Antonio was dragging what was left of the law enforcement machine, as well as a trail of water, figuring he could practice with his tinkerer skill more with some better materials, everyone in the bar and brothel looked at Antonio in shock, Hector briskly leaping over the bar and shutting the front doors, turning off the sign outside that indicated they were open<br />
<br />
&quot;Ay ay ay, you bring whole police department here with stunt like this&quot; he said in a frustrated toan before handing Antonio a Towel from his belt, which he gladly took, wiping the oil and gritt from his face before chuckling and handing the barkeeper his bar towel back<br />
&quot;Good to see you too big guy, could have used your help out there tonight&quot; he chuckled, Hector simply gave a small chuckle, shaking his head as he walked back over to the bar, serving some of the girls a drink before sliding one over to Antonio as he sat down.<br />
<br />
&quot;Awwwww you do care&quot; Antonio said, pouting out his lip and batting his eyes, making the girls at the bar giggle amongst themselves, Hector simply grunted and resumed his work, ignoring Antonios light hearted banter<br />
&quot;Well I know someone who cares&quot; came a familiar voice, looking over to the nearby seats and couches Antonio now stared into Madam Rosewoods emerald green eyes &quot;because a certain someone has been carrying his kids around for the past five months&quot; she chuckled, leaning back in her chair to show off her current form.<br />
<br />
Her midriff had swollen beyond any normal pregnancy, her mocha brown skin of her belly kept smooth, shiny and stretch mark free by the constant attention of Antonio, herself and her maids, she now wore a more comfortable maternity outfit, satin and orange, with darker swirls and spirals embroidered into the fabric, containing her massive milk weighted breasts, with a dark heather overcoat over her shoulders and under her breasts, crisscrossed in leather bindings across the back, she had long orange sleeves, ruffled and puffed out, with ruffles, before fanning out at the wrists, hanging loose on her forearms, her belly was out for the world to see, a simple ruffled trim around her baby ladened swell, the same leather overcoat creating a form fitting yet flexible corset like frame.<br />
She wore a knee high skirt, the same material as the rest of her outfit, three layers making up the skirt each fanning outwards and cutting off below her knees.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes I&#39;m aware of your discomfort dear, and If I remember a few of the girls here have been in your position before&quot; he chuckled as he knelt by her side, landing an affectionate kiss on her warm cheek, over the course of his time in this world Antonio and Victoria had grown quite close to eachother, their partnership slowly growing into somewhat of a relationship, Antonio reached down and stroked over the taught surface of her belly, smiling as he felt the flutter of movement against his palm, Victoria&#39;s hand came to rest atop his, clutching his hand in a gentle squeeze<br />
&quot;So tell me darling, how was your business trip&quot; she said with a smirk, Antonio reached down and held up his bag, opening it to let Madam Rosewood gleam at the treasures inside.<br />
<br />
&quot;As you can see my business trip reaped many rewards tonight, I can safely say we will make a VERY health profit this month&quot; he chuckled as he rested his head against Victoria&#39;s belly &quot;I think we can start looking for baby items soon, maybe even start remodeling the top floor maybe?, it&#39;s pretty worn down up there at this point anyway&quot;<br />
<br />
Victoria hummed as she pondered his words until a voice rang out from up the stairs, there stood at the top was Victoria&#39;s head maid, the same one who had brought him clothes on his first day in this world &quot;well then I think I better come clean about something my lady, I will be needing some baby items for myself as well......I&#39;m pregnant&quot; she said in a timid voice as she released her corset, her entire top half exposed, her areolas large and dark, her skin almost glowing, and the unmistakable curve of a small pregnancy bump which the maid cupped in a protective yet loving embrace.<br />
<br />
All eyes were on Antonio now, including Victoria&#39;s, the hold on his hand getting slightly tighter,<br />
&quot;Well then.....I think we better go to the other room and talk&quot;<br />
