<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"> God then turned to Enoch and Sandalphon. &quot;Now, what can you two tell me about Chaos?&quot; <br />
“Not unitll you explain Sandalphon and the others as to why you had me tucked away for the year I was here,” Enoch smirking.<br />
There was a definitive murmur among the court as Jehovah looked at Enoch coldly.<br />
“Clear the room,” Jehovah ordering everyone; “Sandalphon you stay.”<br />
“The angel looked at Jehovah questioningly as everyone else left; Leaving the throne room empty save for Enoch, Sandalphon and Jehovah himself.<br />
“You ask quite a bit,” Jehovah looking at Enoch; all pretense of being a fatherly figure gone as he gets up from his throne.<br />
“I’m not my father,” Enoch responding; “I can play poker just as good as you.”<br />
“I apologise,” Sandalphon interrupting; “what is this about?”<br />
<br />
Jehovah sighs as he tells Sandalphon the time that he found Enoch wounded from encountering a chaos entity on earth. Taking him to heaven; he allowed the demon wolf-taur to look up and research everything he could on the chaos wards throughout the cosmos.<br />
“I’ve been fixing the wards on earth since,” Enoch adding; “The one on Mount Fuji was the last one. It’s were I ran into Tarfeil. Although I suspect that was your doing,” Enoch looking at Jehovah.<br />
“No,” Jehovah shaking his head; “you meeting with Tarfiel was pure chance. She was sent to Japan for another task. One I’m not at liberty to speak of just yet. As for letting Tarfeil and Azure free, I can’t do that. But  I think its best I show you something,” Jehovah opening a portal; “follow me.”<br />
<br />
On the other side of the portal was room Enoch recognized. It was large complete with a desk that still had his notes and several books still bookmarked. A small kitchen to prepare meals and a large bed. It was the occupants on the large bed that stunned him.<br />
“Mom! Dad,” Enoch bounding to the demons resting on the bed looking confused as to why they were there.<br />
“Enoch,” Lilith looking stunned; she recognized her son’s voice but the wol-ftaur in front of her did not look like Enoch. Enoch was supposed to have red skin like his father and a black wolf body from the human waist down. This Wolf-Taur had tanned skin, a white wolf body below the humanoid waist and a pair of wings along the wolf torso. He was also wearing a black t-shirt with a logo of a short fat cross that has an “R” for the left arm. He was still wearing the same black shades<br />
<br />
“It’s me mother,” Enoch embracing her as he bounds towards her and his father; “but why are you here?”<br />
“I’d like to know that as well,” Lucifer groaning as he is still suffering from a headache.<br />
“I brought you here,” Jehovah speaking; “I couldn’t let Nergal kill you. So in your place in the dungeons below your palace are duplicates. The same as we use when bringing humans to become Demon or angel so loved one on earth don’t get suspicious when they go missing.”<br />
“But I felt someone close to me dying,” Enoch looking at Jehovah; “two deaths just as we were talking in your throne room.”<br />
“Wait,” Lucifer interrupting; “we are in heaven?”<br />
“Same room I was in for a year,” Enoch answering his father; “I told you when we went to the heart of hell to deal with that last ward.”<br />
“And then we saw Adrammelech performing some ritual before retreating through a portal,” Lucifer remembering the conversation; “and my old sword? Where is Light Bringer?”<br />
“I can’t explain it with words as well as I can,” Enoch resting on his haunches; “so give me moment to see if I can try and show you.”<br />
“In the meantime,” Jehovah looking at Sandalphon; “can I get your side of the story?”<br />
<br />
Sandalphon nodded as she told her story of her and Metatron meeting up with Enoch and his party in the second circle of hell; coming across the newly formed angel as well as a condemned human soul who was once an Iron Knight. She then followed up with how they overheard the parties conversation just as they arrived and found out that there was at least a hundred demons possessed by chaos.<br />
“I think I’m ready,” Enoch removing his glasses; both Lucifer and Lilith were stunned to see their son’s eyes were solid blue. Both could sense the energies crackling within as he used a form of magic no one has ever witnessed.<br />
Enoch laid out a projection of what he witnessed and experienced during his battle with chaos. Striking down the Adrammelech shade and then hesitating when he saw a mutilated Loki approaching with his soulless looking eyes. Then the miracle; a blinding flash of light exploding from Enoch; expelling the chaos from those possessed as well as the repairing of the mutilated bodies of both the demons and the two angels Tarfeil and Azure.<br />
“Afterwards,” Enoch dispelling the magical projection; “I became what I am now. I and Light-bringer are now one and the same. Then me an Metatron along with Father Brown went to the cave where everyone was abducted to and encounter Heka and Qesem.”<br />
And are those two dead,” Lucifer growling with rage.<br />
“No,” Enoch shaking his head; “they escaped; they set traps to delay our arrival and then killed the rest of the Iron Knights they were using to create the chaos thralls.”<br />
<br />
“It was around that time,” Jehovah adding that decree 13666 was causing the civil unrest in hell.”<br />
“Nergal Deathfire,” Lucifer glaring; “I’ll cut off his wings and chuck him into the lake of fire.”<br />
“After he and the rabble that he conned into helping him captured you,” Jehovah nodding; “I managed to sneak in and rescue you both without anyone knowing. Which was difficult because you both were being kept under constant guard.”<br />
“Thank you I guess,” Lucifer looking at his old friend; “but we must return to help restore order.”<br />
“Yes,” Lilith looking pissed; “Nergal and his wife Laz must pay for what they did.”<br />
“Nergal thinks you are dead,” Jehovah looking at the first human to become a demon; “he had you killed just after torturing and killing Astaorth.” Lucifer stumbled at the new of his sister’s death; needing to sit down, Jehovah places a hand of comfort to his adoptive brother.<br />
‘That’s who I felt die,” Enoch looking sad; “but he second death? Mom’s body double?”<br />
“Exactly,” Jehovah nodding; “I made sure your body double would react the same way a demon recats when dying. Nergal still thinks he has Lucifer imprisoned. I believe he is planning to have you publicly executed tommorow.”<br />
“So hell is lost,” Lucifer looking morose; “Chaos will get its foot hold.”<br />
“Not if we act fast,” Jehovah getting up; “there is still resistance.”<br />
“Lamashtu,” Enoch looking up; “is she?”<br />
“Alive and well,” Jehovah nodding; “acting as the official leader of the resistance. She is in the eighth circle if my sources are correct.”<br />
“Lammy,” Enoch chuckling; “she is finally being an inspiration instead of a joke.”<br />
“Now will you talk to the council,” Jehovah asking.<br />
“Mom and dad need to go back to hell,” Enoch looking at god; “to help Lamashtu.”<br />
“Let Jehovah finish playing his hand son,” Lucifer chiming in; “we may disagree with a lot of things, but he has never been treacherous to family or friends. And he has always won playing poker.”<br />
“Thank you for those kind words,” Jehovah smiling; “Sandalphon, Enoch we need to head back to the throne room; the entire Heavenly council is eager to meet with both you Enoch and Gaia.”<br />
“And my parents,” Enoch asking as Jehovah opens a portal: “they just stay here and be forgotten about?”<br />
“They are more than welcome to leave,” Jehovah smiling, turning his head to look at Lucifer; “Free will and all.”</p>
