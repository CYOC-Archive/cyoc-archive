<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">For the next week Dan continued his new morning routine. He would wake, pull the covers off his naked body and look down to his balls to see what the change would be. Unsurprisingly, the pills he had to keep taking had increased the size of his testicles again. At this point, they were now the size of two Swiss balls taking up the entire bottom half of his side of the bed. He had to sleep on his back with his legs resting on top of them. It was a surprisingly comfortable position once he got use to it.<br />
Dan sat up and lifted his large testes from the bed to a small four wheeled platform at the side of the bed. Andrew made it when Dan&#39;s parts were getting too large for him to walk normally. Now he can walk around and his sack would drag two feet behind him no problem. Looking in the mirror straight on, he looked just like a nicely toned young guy except were his average-sized ball sack should be was a stretched flap of skin pulled between his legs, and a massive mound of scrotum shaped flesh behind him, up to the height of his buttocks. Because of this, he had given up wearing clothes or leaving the house for the past week. Not that he has needed to, he was still unemployed and the trial’s first payment was sent to his bank account.<br />
<br />
He made his way into the kitchen, balls slightly too big for the door frame squeeze through after him. Dan was happy to see Andrew made bacon and french toast before he left for work. Pulling his balls in front of the tv, he slowly sat down on them like a bean bag and watched tv as he ate. A few days into the trial, Dan had discovered his balls didn&#39;t hurt from pressure anymore unlike the way testicles usually do. Which was great, especially as they grew, since he had to push and pull them around a lot, and often bump them into things. So now he used them as his own personal bean bag chair wherever. Andrew enjoyed them too. Once they were big enough, both would cuddle up against them, to watch their shows. Even their sex life improved, often having a fuck multiple times a day with Dan&#39;s added libido. Just one rule, not to cum inside his bf. As much as Andrew loved the feeling of Dan&#39;s massive load filling up his insides, his belly would often expand to notable sizes. This was fun the first few times, because he just took the day off work and enjoyed his large watermelon sized belly digesting each load of Dan&#39;s cum throughout the day. However he couldn&#39;t keep taking days off work any more, so no more cumming internally until at least the weekend. After a day of following that rule, his belly wasn&#39;t showing through his work clothes as much and he went back to work.<br />
<br />
Dan was glad Andrew was making the most of the situation now. They had a bit of an argument about how Dan should stop with these pills, but once Andrew read the fine print (something Dan had yet to do despite signing the contract) he changed his mind:<br />
&quot;Ok you were right. Obviously I should stop taking the pills, I can&#39;t have my balls keep growing this way!&quot; Dan had said once they reached the size of medicine balls each.<br />
&quot;Wait, I don&#39;t know if that is wise at this point, see here it states &#39;any responsibly to reverse any unwanted effects caused by the trial with be voided if subject fails to complete the trail. However, trails may be authorized to end prematurely during the scheduled monthly reviews at the doctor&#39;s discretion.&#39; Jesus Dan, did you not read any of this? There is a lot in here that seems very dodgy.&quot;<br />
&quot;No,&quot; Dan had said sheepishly. &quot;I just thought it was all typical agreement lawyer-talk stuff like computer updates. I just knew I was going to be paid a lot for it.&quot;<br />
&quot;Well it means you have to take these pills until your first review, and hope that they stay small enough to fit inside, and more importantly, is reversible.&quot; Andrew had explained.<br />
So now they just let them grow, adapting each time to the new daily size, and having fun kinky sex throughout. Hoping that soon it can be reversed and Dan can get his normal life back.<br />
<br />
At the end of the day Andrew came back to find twelve buckets full of cum.<br />
&quot;Hun, I thought we agreed to use the bath for all your extra wanks?&quot; He called out as he started to undress from his work clothes. The increase in size had also increased how much semen Dan produced, and how often he felt the need to ejaculate. Eating and masterbating is mostly all Dan could really do throughout the day.<br />
&quot;We did, and I have been, but today I filled the bath by mid day and I&#39;ve filled it faster than it can drain.&quot; Dan called back before coming into the kitchen, balls in tow.<br />
&quot;Wow you outdid yourself, but I can see you&#39;re still horny.&quot; Andrew winked and pointed to Dan&#39;s 7inch cock as it started rising up into a hard pulsing boner.<br />
The boys embraced, kissing passionately as they stripped Andrew of his remaining clothes. Dan sat up on his swollen nuts and pulled his lover up with him. Andrew wrapped his legs over Dan&#39;s hips, arms on his shoulders for balance, and sat down slowly on Dan&#39;s cock. He moaned as the cock entered his ass. They bounced up and down on Dan&#39;s giant sack, Dan licking Andrew&#39;s nipple, letting his cock slide deeper and deeper inside his boyfriend. Dan was getting close now, his hornyness getting the better of him.<br />
&quot;Oh god, I&#39;m going to cum!&quot;<br />
&quot;Just a little bit longer.&quot; Andrew begged giving himself a handjob as Dan&#39;s cock&#39;s tip massaged his prostate.<br />
&quot;I&#39;m trying! Oh god, oh god. hun time to jump off!&quot;<br />
&quot;Nearly ther....&quot; Before Andrew could finish Dan began to orgasm. Cum ejaculated in mass out of the massive balls into Andrews tiny rectum. The force causing Andrew to cum himself. Not wanting his belly to expand more than manageable, Andy threw himself off Dan, letting the geyser of cum escape up into the air, raining down on both of them. Dan groaned in ecstasy as gallons of cum escapes from his balls.<br />
When Dan finished pumping the last gallon of cum out, he looked around to see his seed covering everything like gooey snow.<br />
&quot;Jeez, at least we had the foresight to do this in the kitchen, easier to wipe up.&quot; He laughed.<br />
&quot;Hrmm yeah, but that should be a job for the one that made the mess.&quot; Andrew poked his tongue out and got up. He was barely visible, under the white goo that had enveloped him, but his new round belly could be spotted poking out. &quot;I need a shower.&quot;</p>
