<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The female demon with fire for hair and four wings made of fire stared out upon the capital of the 3rd circle of hell; Gula. Gula is Latin for Gluttony. Ammit thought the name was rather on the nose. Despite what was detailed in Dante’s Inferno; the 3rd circle wasn’t just where the gluttonous came.  The 3rd circle was also home to artisans and craftsmen’s; Masonries and engineers. Tradesmen’s that help build and maintain the great works that dot the hellscape. Now Nergal’s scummy lackey is ruling Gula; the worm like demon tried to command the garrison’s to carry out emergency decree, but found that most were the human born demon that was to die, was the garrison itself; they had to fight their way out of Gula. But what stunned them was the fact that the few of Nergal’s secret police force was present; was too busy attacking innocent women and children to fight them.<br />
<br />
So they killed as many as they could as they fled; this got the attention of Nergal’s lackey as he watched from the palace balcony as his entire defense force just up and abandoned him. Trying to contact Nergal was proving difficult with a communication portal; Nergal wasn’t taking any petitioners. So the lackey could not inform him that the human slave across all the circles, have been set free by Ammit Morningstar; nor inform him that Gula was completely defenseless.<br />
<br />
So Ammit turns back to stare at the three Garrisons that found her wandering the nearby forest; she only escaped via a secret bolthole that only she knew. Now she dons a simple breast plate armor and carries a small sword as she lead a dozen of her troops in through the same secret passage. Ammit was determined to take back what was so cruelly stolen. The rest slowly filter through the passage; waiting twenty minutes between each group to head down the passage.<br />
<br />
***************<br />
<br />
It took a couple of hours for Ammit’s surprise attack within the Gula Pit to prepare. Several hundreds of soldiers waiting behind hidden doors within the palace waiting for the signal to strike. Ammit watched as the worm like demon crawled out from her bed. Ammit made a mental note to have that mattress and set of sheets burned as she watched the worm crawl to a bucket to throw up in. She saw enough as she silently moved the door disguised as a mirror. Entering through the chamber she quickly creeps up on the demon as it was still heaving up its guts and plunges her blade into it.<br />
<br />
Ammit watched as the demon shuddered before dissolving into ash; her sword’s tip biting into the floor. Pulling up the blade and sheathing it Ammit makes the silent nod to a nearby guradsmen. He salutes and bashes a gong that could be heard throughout to palace. The sound of battle could be heard as Ammit’s guards swarm the palace and proceed to kill the demons that wear wearing Nergal’s sigil.<br />
“Someone get me some wine,” Ammit ordering as she walks to her throne; pushing a dying demon off the dais as she sits down. “And find out where everyone ran off to. Human prisoners, and my family members.”<br />
<br />
**************************<br />
<br />
Lamashtu smiled as she watched Baal and Alecto come back from Tehom; her smile grew wider as they brought Abyzou Morningstar through the portal. Lamashtu’s smile soon evaporated as the snaked headed demon stormed towards her and slapped her hard on the face.<br />
“This is your entire fault,” Abyzou screaming; “because of you we have a civil war and Alabasandria and our children were nearly killed! My Wife,” Abyzou screaming; “my human born wife!”<br />
“Ab,” Lamashtu trying to interrupt but was silenced with another slap to the face.<br />
“I knew you had a problem with human borns,” Abyzou hissing; “but to turn them into slaves with a stroke of a pen?  It’s a good thing we are sisters,” Abyzou readying a hand to strike; “or else I would kill you here and now.”<br />
“Ab,” Lamashtu once again trying to interrupt.<br />
“Save it,” Abyzou walking away; “it’s a good thing Alecto already filled me in on what you have been doing. Or else I wouldn’t have come here. Out of my way,” Abyzou pushing past Baal; “I’m heading back to Tohem.” Abyzou opening up a portal, “Alabasandria and our children need me.”<br />
“I’ll keep you posted,” Alecto stopping her sister for a brief moment; “despite what you might think Abyzou, this is personal growth for Lamashtu.”<br />
<br />
********************************************<br />
<br />
“Abyzou clearly despises me,” Lamashtu sighing; the sting of her sisters words hurting her more than the slaps to her face. “I guess I had it coming though,” the donkey eared demon looking at Nocticula; the second oldest daughter to Lucifer and Lilith and the archduchess of the eighth circle of hell.<br />
“You think,” the ink black demon with tiny dots that sparkle with each movement; “you always had nasty words for her and her wife who was living in Egypt. Infact you had issues with every human born that your brothers and sister chose,” Nocticula pointing at Lamashtu; “this is a poison pill of your own making.”<br />
“And what of your,” Lammashtu looking at her older sister; “or is you coming back from Dionysus’s place unable to walk right a little on the nose.”<br />
<br />
<br />
Nocticula smiled as she recalled earlier in the morning. Waking up in bed with the randy satyr angel spooning her; she was a little stunned to see another demon also in bed with them. It was the same demon she saw giving Dionysus a blow job the evening before.<br />
‘So he bedded you as well,’ Nocticula shuddering as she felt Dionysus’s phallic rod brush past her folds. She was distantly aware of a few wild romps with both him and her. Engaging in a sixty-nine position with the demon while Dionysus mounted the female demon who was on top. Both Lamashtu’s former sex slave and herself, was a recipient of such a bizarre and erotic act of love making. Tasting both sweet honey from each other and Dionysus&#39;s salty seed during orgasmic release.<br />
<br />
“Careful dear sister,” Nocticula eyeing Lamashtu; “I’ve known that randy goat boy for a lot longer than you have had a chip on your shoulder.”<br />
“I know,” Lamashtu smirking; “I read some of his old poetry about you. Ick,” Lamashtu pantomiming two fingers down her throat. “Has he always had a crush on you?”<br />
“Ever since Enoch introduced us,” Nocticula shaking her head; “don’t ask about that by the way. That is an even more complicated story. But Dionyus calls me ‘His starry night’.”<br />
<br />
“That is utterly sappy drivel,” Alecto speaking up as she approached her two sisters, the snakes for hair demon joins the two at the table; pouring herself a glass of wine. “I just got word from Ammit,” Alecto smiling as she sips her wine; “she just took back Gula and deposed Nergal’s lackey.”<br />
“What,” Lammashtu looking shocked; “how?”<br />
“Does it matter,” Nocticula smiling as she nibbles on some cheese; “that is four circles we now control. Nergal will soon feel that noose tightening as we take hell back.”<br />
“This changes everything,” Lamashtu getting up; “I need to inform Louis-Gaston. His assault on Gula is about to begin soon.”<br />
&quot;We&#39;ll save a lot of troops,&quot; Alecto sampling the cheese as Lamashtu runs off; &quot;less wounded for father brown to patch up.&quot;</p>
