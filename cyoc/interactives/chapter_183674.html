<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ann let out a sigh of relief as Jackie sprinted out of her office. As much as she loved having Jackie with her day to day, she hated her being there when her regression flared up.<br />
<br />
While her episodes had decreased exponentially and she knew how to keep it under control, it didn&#39;t mean she had a complete control over it. Today was one of those days as Ann found herself feeling  ery stresses out.<br />
<br />
McIntyre had paid her a visit earlier in the day. Ann would be receiving a promotion, much to her delight. The promotion would essentially make her second only to McIntyre. Ann would no longer have to travel as much, meaning she could spend more time with family. It also meant she would have to name a successor. While she wanted that to be Stephanie, other board members wanted someone else. The idea of not giving Stephanie that promotion was what started Ann&#39;s regression episode.<br />
<br />
Couple that with a meeting with potential clients about research the company and Ann&#39;s stress level was through the roof. Taking a quick peak at her appearance, Ann winced. She looked about 30 now.<br />
<br />
&quot;Megan can you come in?&quot;<br />
<br />
Megan, Ann&#39;s personal secretary and friend now entered. The young woman giving her a warm smile as she brushed her sandy brown hair back. &quot;Yes Ann what can I do for you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hold my calls and please don&#39;t let anyone in besides Jackie,&quot; Ann stated. &quot;I&#39;m....not feeling so great.&quot; Megan nodded, carefully looking at Ann. Megan knew about Ann&#39;s condition and judging by her appearance she could see she was in the middle if an episode. Ann looked close to her age now and was quite pale. &quot;No problem Ann I&#39;ll make sure you&#39;re not disturbed,&quot; Megan said.  As she turned to leave she paused, blushing in embarrassment she now cast a look at her boss.<br />
<br />
&quot;Um do you want me to get the booster seat?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; Ann frowned. Megan apologized, saying she would be just outside as she quickly left. Ann now sighed as she sat in her chair to get some work done.<br />
<br />
Although she knew Megan was trying to be helpful, it did little to calm her nerves. Couple that with the fact she could clearly determine how old she was and Ann felt she was fighting a losing battle. Already Ann could tell she was 29, the number seeming to be front and center in her mind. What was worse was she could tell she was approaching 28 rather quickly. &quot;Just focus Ann,&quot; she thought. &quot;Dont think about this and just get your work done.&quot;<br />
<br />
Focusing was becoming an issue, Ann&#39;s reverse aging was front and center. The now young executive could tell her bodybwas youthening, her skirt seeming a little loose while her breasts seemed a bit perkier. Ann was rather quickly traveling backwards through her 20s, regaining her youthful energy as she went.<br />
<br />
By the time Ann hit 21 she was practically overflowing with energy. Grunting in frustration Ann stood, pacing anxiously. As she now approached a mirror she winced. &quot;Damn it I look barely old enough to drink,&quot; she grumbled.<br />
<br />
Gazing at her appearance Ann beheld a college age girl. Ann&#39;s face was soft, straddling the line between teen and adult. Taking a moment to think she realized her 21st birthday was rapidly approaching in the opposite direction. Looking at her outfit she could see it wasn&#39;t quite as fitting as before. Ann&#39;s stomach had flattened, her hips a little narrower while her breasts appeared much perkier than what she was used to. If she didn&#39;t want that booster seat she need to stop this.<br />
<br />
&quot;Focus Ann focus,&quot; she whispered. &quot;You can stop this. Just breathe, breathe and concentrate.&quot;<br />
<br />
It was hard though for Ann to concentrate. Ann&#39;s voice sounded more youthful, her clothing seeming to become more ill fitting by the moment. Even her annoyed grunts and sighed sounded more childish. Once more her age seemed to be front and center, only 19 and quickly speeding for 18.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay Ann,&quot; she thought. &quot;Your young, getting younger and brewing with energy. Fogure this out quick and get it under control or your going to end up jumping on the furniture.&quot; Ann winced at that idea, remembering the time she had been reduced to 5. It had been one if her worse attacks as she not only ended up a kindergarten but had her mentality affected as well. The girl had run around her office, giggling and coloring on the walls before coming to her senses. Needless to say she was still embarrassed about that one.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately that memory wasn&#39;t helping her current predicament. Ann&#39;s emotions were running wild now, like an actual teenager. Embarassment was clouding her judgment as she raced backwards in age. Passing 18 the now 17 year old was feeling awkward dressed in an ill fitting business suit. Wobbling in her heels Ann scowled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Damn shoes,&quot; she grumbled, kicking them away. Looking down at her nylon covered feet didn&#39;t improve her mood. Ann&#39;s legs looked skinnier, the material sagging on her legs. The fact the carpet fibers tickled her feet didn&#39;t help either as she paced.<br />
<br />
Ann glanced in her mirror, biting her lip. 16, she was 16 again, younger than her teenage girlfriend. A girlfriend who would find herself babysitting if she didn&#39;t get it together.<br />
<br />
Looking at her self she balled her fist in anger as she gazed at the teenage girl who looked like she was wearing her mothers business suit. She had one final trick up her sleeve.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your a teenager Ann,&quot; she whispered. &quot;A teenager, a teenager, a teenager.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ann kept repeating this Montrail over and over. She had done this in the past, stating an age range to galt her regression. While she usually preferred doing this when she was older, she options were limited. Hopefully she could halt this before she ended up back in daycare.<br />
<br />
Furrowing her brow, Ann now kept repeating herself, trying to stop her regression before she got any younger. She knew she looked ridiculous looking like a teenage girl in a ill fitting suit, but it beat the alternative. As she now stared at her reflection she could only hope for the best.</p>
