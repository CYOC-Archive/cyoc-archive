<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">*Ding Dong*<br />
<br />
The note for tonight had arrived, and the contestants gathered around as they read the note. This time the object they had to retrieve was a belt, but the only clue the note gave was one word, mailbox. This posed a problem for the would be millionaires as the box itself was on a post at the end of the houses long driveway. It wasn&#39;t going to be easy to get. Luckily for the group the sun was still up, and if they acted fast they might be able to get down to the mailbox before the sun set.<br />
<br />
Henry was the first to lay out his plan. They would all grab shovels from the gardening shed just incase, and then they would make their way down the driveway as a group. That way if anything did try and get them they could fight back as a group.<br />
<br />
Jamie wasn&#39;t thrilled with the plan, but time was of the essence so she backed Henry up on his plan. She didn&#39;t know when her transformation would occur and she didn&#39;t want it to be inside if she could help it. Jamie could feel her tongue growing little by little, and her teeth felt sharper by the minute. Not to mention the energy, she could literally feel coursing through her body. It felt good, but she had to try and hold it together a little longer.<br />
<br />
The sun crept dangerously close to the horizon as the five companions made their way down the driveway. They could see camera men on either side of the way, surely a bad omen. If they had been smarter or perhaps paying closer attention the remaining four contestants might have noticed most of the cameras were pointing at the  busty blonde. Shovel&#39;s in hand the group closed in on their prize, the mailbox.<br />
<br />
Aaron bolted running for the mailbox, which was still 20 yards ahead. &quot;What are you doing?!&quot; Henry hissed, upset that Aaron had disregarded the plan when they were so close to their goal.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve got it!&quot; Aaron yelled back at Henry. &quot;I can&#39;t take it anymore. I&#39;ll grab it then we can all run back to the house!&quot; Everyone was staring at him as he made it to the mailbox. Everyone that is, except Jamie.<br />
<br />
It was time. She couldn&#39;t fight it anymore. The sudden outburst had been too much and she lost her concentration. &quot;Ngh... Gah!&quot; Jamie groaned with an unnatural guttural tone as she fell to the ground. &quot;Aaagh! I... ...I...  c-can&#39;t hold it, b-back... any longer.&quot; A loud crack sounded from Jamie&#39;s back; her bones shifted and popped. &quot;I&#39;m... I&#39;m... g-g-going to...!&quot; Fur poured out from her skin as her arms contorted out to her sides. Jamie fell to her knees in pain and agony. Her hands looked like they were being pulled apart by unseen forces. Her small hands and fingers lengthened, slight pads grew in under her palms, and her finger tips puffed up to match. Her already long nails pushed out even further; they looked sharp and savage on her previously lady-like hand.<br />
<br />
Everyone had frozen when Jamie first cried out. The group stared in disbelief as the blonde beauty slowly transformed before their very eyes. Jamie&#39;s legs were the next victim of her lycanthropic transformation. She was already on the ground when a new wave of pops and crunches resounded through the air. Jamie&#39;s legs lengthened and bulked up. Her tight jeans ripped and fell off her body to reveal thick blonde fur overtaking her light skin. Muscle exploded from her thighs and calves, while her feet got longer and adopted a digitigrade stance. Much like Jamie&#39;s hands, her toenails grew into claws and she dug them firmly into the ground as she tried to stand up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jamie!&quot; Kelly called out. &quot;It&#39;ll be ok! We&#39;ll get you back to the house and fix you.&quot; She was too shocked to think straight.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck that! RUN!&quot; Aaron shouted before closing the distance to the mailbox, grabbing the belt, and taking off back for the house. The rest of the contestants began arguing about what they should do, but Jamie payed then no mind.<br />
<br />
A think lock of blonde hair fell into Jamie&#39;s face as she looked down at her changing body. She stood on thick, muscular legs, both ending in sturdy paws that would enable her to gain traction on almost any surface. Hanging from her sides were two powerful, yet still feminine arms, equipped with sharp claws that could tear her prey apart within seconds. Her bust accentuating top still adorned her torso but Jamie could feel something happening to it. Raising her hands up to check, she could feel her boobs growing. Directly below them Jamie could feel something else, another pair! She felt even lower and found even more! Jamie had grown three new sets of breasts, each one a little smaller than than the one above it. Her shirt was beginning to be unbearable and Jamie ripped it and her bra off like they were wrapping paper on a birthday present.<br />
<br />
By this point Aaron was long gone, and Kelly and Henry were almost back to the house. Sara stood transfixed however. &#39;How is this possible?&#39; She thought to herself. &#39;Werewolves aren&#39;t real.&#39; Her whole life, Sara had been abused and picked on. Unable to rely on others, she had become closed off and self-reliant. Sara was a beautiful woman and she knew what it was like to be in compromising situations, at bars, at parties, even just walking home. She had taken martial arts classes inorder to defend herself. Sara always told herself there was nothing more she could do to protect herself. Until today.<br />
<br />
Jamie didn&#39;t notice the 21 year old standing infront of her. She did notice blonde fur fill in every square inch of skin below her neck. It was thick but still couldn&#39;t manage to hide any of her  eight puffy, erect teats. Jamie teased them playfully as the pain wracking her body began to give way to pleasure. Suddenly, a tail shot out from her backside; it wagged happily from side to side as the same blonde fur quickly covered it. Jamie could feel the end coming. All the stress and pain from everywhere else built up at the base of her throat. She turned her head up towards the night sky, and she knew she was almost complete. Jamie inhaled deeply, even as her nose and face began to push forward. Her ears tapered into points, and she released an ear-splitting howl. It started sharply, but surely. With every moment it grew louder, and Jamie could feel all that pressure and all of her stress being forcefully pushed out of her system into the night sky. As she continued, her muzzle finished forming, her tongue finished growing, and her ears moved to their appropriate place on her head. Jamie finally finished her howl and relaxed. Deep amber eyes pierced the darkness as she opened them, taking in her surroundings.<br />
<br />
&quot;That was amazing!&quot; Jamie said in a deep husky timber. &quot;Now, where is Nate? I believe he said something about hunting?&quot;</p>
