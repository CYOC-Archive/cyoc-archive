<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Amanda dashed into the changing room.  Fifteen seconds into going into the room, I heard Amanda groan slightly.  I assumed she had taken the bikini off and she had changed back into a human woman.  &quot;Joe, what's going on?  Why am I in here?&quot;<br />
<br />
I shouted back, &quot;I'll explain after you come out.  Don't wear the bikini?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why not?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll tell you when you come back out,&quot; I replied.  She didn't seem satisfied with the answer, but she got redressed in her one-piece.  Of course, she shed years again as she didn't have much else to wear.  The youthful 16 year old stepped out of the room and walked up to me.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, what's the big deal about the bikini?&quot; she asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;It turned you into a mermaid, Amanda.  Completely into a mermaid.&quot;<br />
<br />
Amanda nodded.  &quot;That's what was supposed to do, right?  All I remember was trying to breath underwater.  What happened after that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, the bikini did what was supposed to do.  You became a mermaid, a driven one, if you catch my drift,&quot; I hinted to her.<br />
<br />
Amanda gave me a thoughtful, one-squinted eye look.  &quot;You mean, it made me,&quot; she paused as her face reddened.  I nodded in agreement.  Her face became bright red.  &quot;Did I, ahhh, try to...&quot; she stumbled for the right words.<br />
<br />
&quot;You tried to kiss me and turn me into a merman.  The ring saved me.  I had to get you into the changing room on the promise I'd let you kiss me.  Once you took the bikini off, you were no longer a mermaid.  You never did anything wrong, I promise you,&quot; I told her.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, after I breathed water, I became a mermaid in the truest sense.  Wow, I don't recall anything.  I just gave a try at breathing water while you were changing.  Then I remember being unclothed in the room.  I was a little lost then,&quot; she recollected.<br />
<br />
&quot;I had to wish myself to the surface after you removed my respirator.  And I had to remove you from the water a few times, as well.  You were a bit upset with me.  When I realized you wanted to make more merfolk, I realized you weren't quite Amanda.  I need to realize that my wishes need to be tempered, like the one that makes you physically 16, not mentally 16,&quot; I told her.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, I was a mermaid for 20 minutes.  Thank you for not taking advantage of it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Amanda, I knew it wasn't quite you.  Sorry to do that to you...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It isn't quite your fault.  Besides, I liked having the tail.&quot;  After a pause, &quot;So, I was aggressive?&quot; she said with a blush.<br />
<br />
I was caught off guard.  &quot;Yes, you were.  It just didn't seem like you.  I wasn't quite sure what was going on.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm not aggressive, that's true.  I'm just curious what I was like,&quot; she inquired.<br />
<br />
&quot;All I could understand was your physical overtures.  I could not understand you.  You made clicking sounds, nothing vocal until you were out of the water,&quot; I described.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I must have been speaking mermaid,&quot; she giggled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whatever it was, it was different.  Say, how late is it?&quot;<br />
<br />
We both looked out the window to see that the sky was dark.  Amanda looked to the wall in her living room.  The giant clock read 10:30.  &quot;Oh, it's getting late.  I have to be at the library at 7 for work.  Do you think we could be normal?&quot; she asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Normal?  You're a 16 year old girl,&quot; I joked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Perhaps on the outside.  But on the inside, I'm a woman,&quot; she purred, being seductive.<br />
<br />
I blushed.  &quot;I know you are.  And it's easy to reverse that,&quot; I said in reply.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let me do that, if you don't mind.  I like my enchanted bathing suit,&quot; she requested.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, what about your bikini?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What about it?&quot; Amanda asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's a little dangerous.  Should I remove the enchantment?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Can you modify it, so that I don't turn into mentally into a mermaid?&quot; she asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can do that.  I wish Amanda's bikini gave the wearer all the abilities of a mermaid, but did not change them mentally into a mermaid.  Rather, they gain the knowledge of a mermaid, remember the things they did while a mermaid, and could control how they behave,&quot; I stated.<br />
<br />
The bikini didn't change at all.  &quot;I assume that took care of that,&quot; I declared.<br />
<br />
&quot;Great, could we be big again?&quot; she asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure.  I wish Amanda and I were normal size and standing in her kitchen.&quot;  We both felt a wave of excitement in ourselves as we were translocated and returned to normal size.  We both materialized in Amanda's kitchen.  She was quite attractive in her swimsuit.<br />
<br />
&quot;Joe, I do need to get some sleep, if I can tonight.  But, don't get me wrong, I don't want you to go either.  I really trust you and you can stay here, if you want,&quot; she offered.<br />
<br />
&quot;I,&quot; I stuttered, &quot;think I should leave, too.  I sorta don't want to, but it would be best if I left though.  It keeps temptation to a minimum, although this ring makes things too easy to do,&quot; I admitted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Joe, you wouldn't pop in on me, would you?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;No, I won't do that.  You could never trust me if I did.  And, I don't want to hurt our friendship.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Joe, do you trust me?&quot; she asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I have to.  You could tell people...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No you don't.  You can easily wish I didn't know about it.  You could easily turn me into something and make me simply disappear,&quot; she interrupted me.<br />
<br />
Amanda was making things more philosophical and caught me off guard.  I coughed, &quot;Amanda, I could do that, but I don't want to.  It wouldn't be right.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It wouldn't be right, but it would be easy to do, nonetheless.  I'd never know it, only you would have that on your conscious, and you probably can wish that away to.  I'm the one who gets the consequences,&quot; she reasoned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Amanda, I do not want to hurt you,&quot; I pleaded.  &quot;What do you want from me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, to see how much you trust me.  I'm tempted to ask to wear your ring, but have another idea in mind.&quot;</p>
