<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">For each new applicant, the Company would give the man - for only men were allowed to apply - a simple test. <br />
Though a simple test, it was also a rather odd test. The test was always done in a plain room with wood panel <br />
walls, a white carpet and empty of all furniture except for a white chair and white curtains on one wall. It <br />
was used to gauge their attitude, to make sure they were right for the job. It didn't take long, and involved <br />
watching a series of images and choosing three. The first two were easy, images of cars and houses, appealing <br />
to the ambitious nature of most applicants. It was the third set that was the important one. It involved three <br />
images, all of women. The first was a simple brunette women, small, with a nice smile. She was dressed in <br />
business attire and wore glasses. The second focused on a woman in blue, naked except for a loose, sky blue <br />
skirt. She had huge breasts and her sandy blonde hair fell well passed her shoulders. A faint smile played <br />
across her lips. A teasing smile that lured men in. And the third was of an asian girl, not long out of <br />
school, who appeared to be at a university, judging by the pile of books under her arm.<br />
<br />
Successful applicants NEVER picked the second.<br />
<br />
Hank opened his eyes and found he was still in the wood panel room. But something was definitely wrong. The <br />
first thing he noticed was his hair. It was long and blonde, luscious and silky soft, falling down to his <br />
shoulder blades. He also had never had a fringe before.<br />
<br />
He frowned, but was distracted by a heavy weight on his chest. His shifted in his seat to get a better look, <br />
but before he could look down was struck by a jiggly sensation. When his eyes finally ventured down he saw a <br />
pair of huge tits. They were firm but soft,when he put a hand to them they felt warm and his nipples <br />
stiffened. A gasp escaped from lips shiny from lip gloss, soft and feminine with a hint of hidden passion.<br />
<br />
With a venturing hand passed the soft blue skirt, Hank gasped again as he confirmed what the rest of his <br />
senses already told him - he was a woman. Panic threatened to rise, his heart rate climbing and his breathing <br />
becoming loud.<br />
<br />
Shaking his head, he felt his hair flop around his head while his boobs jiggled again. He tried to block out <br />
of his mind. &quot;Come on Hank, keep it together.&quot; But Hank was suddenly struck again by the sense of wrongness. <br />
&quot;No.&quot; He said, frowning. &quot;That's not right. Hank isn't my name...&quot;<br />
<br />
Leaning back sideways in the chair, a sense of relaxation overcame Kelly as she remembered her name. She hung <br />
her smooth, hairless legs over the other arm of the chair while she brought both of her hands up to feel her <br />
generous boobs. Her white teeth showed in a smile as she felt the huge mounds of warmth beneath her fingers. <br />
She wasn't an expert, but from what she remembered from the bra's of her past girlfriends, she knew that she <br />
had to be at least an E cup.<br />
<br />
Kelly giggled, thinking it sounded strange to say that she had girlfriends. No, that must be a mistake too, <br />
just like Hank. What a silly name. She turned slightly so that her toes were touching the floor and tilted her <br />
head so that it rested on her hand while her hair cascaded down. Using her free right arm, she scooped up her <br />
boobs. Her body was tingling all over with new sensations. She wanted to move and stretch and try out new <br />
positions. Gathering up her skirts, she knelt on the chair, her right hand gently tracing along her shoulder <br />
while her left reached up to rub the back of her head. It felt good.<br />
<br />
Even though Kelly knew her name, and knew that she was a woman, she also knew that hadn't always been the <br />
case. But she was struggling to think straight with all these new feelings. She turned to the side again, <br />
resting her heels on her cushiony bum and her hands on the arm of the chair, letting her boobs hang free with <br />
her hair. She remembered coming for an interview and doing some silly test. She remembered seeing a picture of <br />
herself, so she chose it. But had it really been her?<br />
<br />
Standing delicately on her toes (she actually found it easier to stand that way than on flat feet), she slowly <br />
untied the sash of her skirt and slowly, teasingly lifted it up, her fingers brushing electricity along her <br />
body. When the fabric brushed against her nipple she shuddered with pleasure, she began to let her hands roam <br />
more, adopting different poses and trying new looks. Her favourite was when she stood with one foot on the <br />
chair and the other on the floor, both still on her tip toes, while the blue skirt was held loosely across her <br />
mid-drift.<br />
<br />
The hot young woman tried to concentrate on this sense of wrongness, but her body was on fire. Once again, she <br />
hopped up on the chair, facing forward on her knees while she gently cradled a boob in each hand. A faint, <br />
teasing smile still remained on her lips, as though she were doing this for some unseen watcher. She lent <br />
forward on her hands so that her generous breasts were squashed together between her arms. A slight moan <br />
escaped her lips as her attention was drawn to other female parts of her body.<br />
<br />
Her curiousity piqued, Kelly squatted sideways on the chair. She no longer cared about the fringe hovering on <br />
the edge of her vision or her soft, luscious hair resting on her shoulders or the top of her boobs. She no <br />
longer cared about the weight of her boobs either. In fact, she was finding both of those aspects rather <br />
comfortable. Both the long hair and the big boobs were making her feel very feminine, which comforted her and <br />
soothed the sense of wrongness. Her curiousity burning like the fire of her desire, he fingers gently brushed <br />
against her womanhood.<br />
<br />
The spell was broken.<br />
<br />
All of Hank's memories came rushing back to Kelly, quickly filling her head to bursting point. No longer was <br />
she simply to hot young woman contesting with her body and a sense of wrongness. But also she wasn't once <br />
again wholly Hank. His memories again filled her head and once again her large chest and long hair felt alien <br />
to her. But Kelly knew she was no longer Hank. Could no longer be Hank. Conscious thought had returned to her, <br />
and with it a sense of reality. She wasn't happy about this change tricked upon her, but at the same time it <br />
wasn't the end of the world. For better or worse she was a woman. For the time being a least.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm a woman.&quot; Saying the words aloud seemed to solidify it. &quot;A BIG woman.&quot; She mused, feeling her chest <br />
again. Suddenly self conscious, she realised for the first time the curtains on the wall. Pulling them aside <br />
she found a small hallway ending in a door. On the floor in front of the door was a pile of clothes. Holding <br />
up the bra and its cavernous cups, she sighed. &quot;I'm a woman.&quot; She reminded herself as she slipped into the bra <br />
with surprising - almost expert - ease. Sliding the white panties up her legs, she had to admit the way the <br />
fit her new figure so snug felt good. Next came the dress. Tight, it showed off her figure -  which secretly <br />
made her a little happy - but kept most of her ample chest as a mere suggestion. Running her hands up and down <br />
her sides and around her ass brought a small smile to her lips. Glancing down, she saw the final piece of <br />
attire. A pair of blue, 4&quot; heels to match her dress. At first this annoyed her, but then a small giggle <br />
escaped her when she became aware of the ridiculous way she was standing on her toes. When she slipped her <br />
feet inside the heels and clasped them on she sighed at the comfort, it was as if her legs had been made for <br />
wearing heels.<br />
<br />
As she emerged from the door she found herself at the other end of a long hallway, a blue carpet leading to a <br />
desk where a man was sitting. As she made her way down the hall, she walked with all the experience and <br />
practice of an expert. Anyone who had seen her would had thought she had been walking in heels her whole life.  <br />
As she came up to the desk the man behind it looked up and threw her a grin. &quot;Who are you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Kelly felt a fluttering feeling in her stomach for a moment as all manner of answers ran through her head. <br />
Hank was immediately ruled out, then strange things started finding their way between her ears. &quot;I'm yours. <br />
I'll be anything you want me to be. I'm a naughty girl. I'm your horny little slut.&quot; That last one stuck with <br />
her for a bit as she thought back to how it had felt to hold her boobs and wondered what a man's hand would be <br />
like. In fact why did it have to be his hand?<br />
<br />
With a mental shake of her head, Kelly cleared her mind. Then the answer came to her. &quot;I'm the woman in blue.&quot;</p>
