<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Day Two<br />
The next morning patrick found himself to be a girl, Grandma came in the room and she told her that she got her. As a punishment Patricia would be that for the rest of the day, with Jackey and not go on the boat. Uncle Doug owned a house boat, and the family took it out on the lake. Sherin adked Kat if she could be a dolphin, Kat casted as spell on her. her skin turned gray, her legs transformed into a fin, her arms became fins as well, and other details, as sherine as swimming in the water as a dolphin. Kat went up to the third floor where she found James trying to get a tan. Kat asked him if he wanted to get into the water. James said no, Kat then transformed his swim trunks into a female bathing suit. James mad ran at Kat as she went down the slide James followed her down to the lake. James then realised that he was tricked into getting into the water, James was going back up, and kat told him if he goes back up she will change his swim suit into a bikini and him into a hot chick, James decided to stay in the water. Doug hooked up the tubes and got out his speedboat, and told two kids to get on the float. Kat told him that a boy and a girl should be on it whoever falls of of it gets turned into the gender of the winner until everyone is the same gender and we will be in that form for tomarrow. James said that it was six to four, Kat turned sherin back into a human and she told James that he already has the attire for this, James hair grew down and his dick became a vagina as his nipples expanded to make A cup boobs. Kat told Doug that they are doing this. First match was Josie vs Luke, All the family members were cheering them on from the house boat, it was very bumpy but five minutes later a wave hit as Luke flew off, Luke’s head came out lf the water and everything was changed and his hair grew down, Lucy then got on the boat. Second match was Dan vs Kat, The ride was fine for both lf them but then A sharp turn occured and Kat fell off turning her into a boy, Keaden was then brought back to the ship, Third match was Lisa vs Tim, lisa one and Tina got on the ship, Fourth Match was Jasmine vs Tyler, Tyler became taylor, fifth match was Sherin vs Larry, sherin was turned back into craig. The ratio of boys to girls were 4 to six. The sixth match was Craig vs Lucy, craig won, the seventh match was Keaden vs Josie, Josie became john again, The eighth match was Dan vs Taylor, Taylor became tyler again, the ninth match was Larry vs jasmine, larry won, the tenth match was Dan vs lisa, dan won, and the ratio was now 9:1, the last match was Keaden vs Tina, Keaden won, when they got home Patricia was turned back into patrick, <br />
Day three<br />
The boys did many out door activities, They started camp fires which they cooked on them, Went fishing and they slept in a tent. Grandma tokd them that tomarrow they would do battle of the sexes, and that was their first challenge.<br />
Day 4<br />
Grandma changed them all back, she turned patrick into a gender neutral as his penis went in but a vagina did not form, both teams were ready, two of the boys had to sit out, Grandma told them that they were fighting for whether patrick becomes a boy or a girl, It was a rely race, What ever team high fives patrick will determine his gender, but members must high five him, girls high five his left hand boys his right. They ran, and ran and it was close but the girls won, the flap of skin where patricks crouch opened up and it bloomed into a vagina, thus making patrick a girl. Grandma told the boys that they are going to be in the other house. the girls will stay in the one that grandma is staying in. Later their next challenge was to get one of their teammates baxk to shore by swimming 400 yards and bring them back to shore. The swimmer who fails becomes the opposite gender, But here is a twist you will swim as genderswapped versions of your selves, Tyler was picked for the boys and Kat was picked for the girls, Kat had an advantage because she was a lifegaurd, She easily one the race as she became a girl again as taylor stayed a girl. Grandma told them that the challenges will start up on day six.<br />
Day five<br />
the boys went fishing while the girls went to the mall. This was Josie’s first time ever going to the mall, and she loved it, she bought some dresses and some training bras since it would soon happen. The girls then got spa and when they came home it was dark, so they went to bed.</p>
