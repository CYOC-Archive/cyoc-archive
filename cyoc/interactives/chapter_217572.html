<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Like the announcement of the school&#39;s liberal policy regarding genitals, no one was interested in the procedure, at least that&#39;s what it seemed until just over two weeks after the announcement.<br />
<br />
On the day in question Alice Herring, who was a member of the school swim team, when she arrived for practice, the bulge in her bathing suit caught the attention of all her teammates. No one expected her to have the procedure to get a penis, and she said she didn&#39;t expect to either, but after the school announcement she was curious. After practice that day, in the locker room, her swim buddies asked her several questions about the procedure and its results.<br />
<br />
The news that Alice had the procedure and now had a 9 inch dick quickly spread around the school and either gained interest or took what she wanted without fear of being judged. In the days that followed, the number of girls who had dicks at school increased and, before you noticed, they were already commonplace at school.  One thing that became normal with the girls who underwent the procedure was that they stopped wearing skirts, they always wore pants and made sure that the bulges of their members were clearly visible. They liked it when people stared and didn&#39;t even hide it when they had an erection.<br />
<br />
The boys didn&#39;t like it at first, especially those who had girlfriends who had the procedure, but over time even they accepted it.  They had their arguments, some saying that even though they had a dick they were still girls, so it wouldn&#39;t be gay at all, and there were also those who started to give preference to girls who had a dick.<br />
<br />
But you didn&#39;t care about that.  You didn&#39;t have the procedure, but you weren&#39;t against it either, you just felt that there was nothing to motivate you to do it. You even got along with your friend Amelie even after the scare she gave you one day just to show you she had the procedure. Standing on the crowded bus on the way to school, someone arrives rubbing their hard cock in your ass and when you turn around to pick up the pervert, you bump into her, who smiled and asked you what you think of her new tool. And later that same day you accompanied her to the bathroom and watched if anyone approached her to jerk off, because her erection wouldn&#39;t go away. Today she is used to having a dick and knows how to treat it better, and even though the erections were not as frequent as before, she had also loosened up like the others and wore pants so tight that the bulge in it was prominent even with her dick soft.<br />
<br />
Three months after the new policy was applied, it was estimated that nearly half of the girls in the school had a dick between their legs. At this time more changes were made at the school to adapt to the new policy, an example being that the toilets are no longer divided into male and female, but between those with vaginas and those with penises.<br />
<br />
On your lunch break the other day, you walked Amelie into the penis-bearing bathroom, just like you used to keep up with each other and didn&#39;t stop even after she switched her genitals. You got in there shortly after Owen Duncan, one of the school&#39;s playboys. He stopped in front of a urinal and Amelie chose the urinal immediately to his left. Your friend pulled down her pants, grabbed her dick and started pissing while Owen did the same.<br />
<br />
Owen was a very outgoing guy and liked to talk to others, even if they barely know each other personally, he also had a reputation for being a chatterbox, because sometimes he started talking and it seemed like he was going to go on and on, and he had no filter, talking about everything, even very private things. So he looked at Amelie&#39;s dick while she was pissing and said &quot;Your dick is pretty big too, isn&#39;t it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You think?  There are girls at school with dicks bigger than mine.&quot; Amelie said<br />
<br />
&quot;I know that, but that&#39;s not what I was saying.  It&#39;s just that the girls at school who went through the switch all ended up with bigger dicks than the guys.  I wish mine were in the same size range as yours, but they are 5 inches.  Yours should be an 8 inch if I&#39;m not wrong.&quot; Owen said<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s eight and a half inches to be exact, and I understand what you mean, which is why I ordered this size at the time of the procedure.&quot; Amelie said<br />
<br />
&quot;I didn&#39;t expect having a dick to be so popular with girls when they announced the genitals policy.  Among guys, very few decided to trade their dicks for a vagina.&quot; Owen said, finishing unloading and tucking his pants back in place.<br />
<br />
&quot;I also didn&#39;t intend to do the procedure at first, but seeing what the other girls were doing I got curious and wanted to give it a try.&quot; said Amelie, also tucking her cock back in her pants after shaking.<br />
<br />
&quot;You and several others.  I don&#39;t know if you know, but my family lives on a farm and for studying I live in a house where I share the rent with three housemates. I was lucky that all three of my housemates are very pretty girls who also go to this school.  Turns out all three had the procedure done and now have dicks. I know you guys like to leave the bulge in your pants very visible and I don&#39;t see a problem with that, but at home they came off completely.  At first they were only in lingerie and nothing else, but they loosened up to the point where they didn&#39;t bother masturbating in front of others when they got horny, and sometimes I caught them having sex in the living room and even in the kitchen. I don&#39;t think that&#39;s a bad thing, as I&#39;m not left out and I&#39;ve been having sex with them quite often, and so it&#39;s started to feel more natural for girls to have dick. The only problem is that I seem to have had some bad luck.  You know Erika from room 2-B?  After so long I&#39;ve wanted to have a moment with a girl who has a vagina and she does, so last Thursday I asked her out on Friday night. She accepted and we met the next day as promised and we had a wonderful time and she opened up to me enough for us to spend the night in a motel room. When the crunch time came I was surprised to see her revealing a 10 inch cock from under her skirt. I told her of my hopes of fucking her pussy and she apologized saying she had the procedure done that afternoon and only had her dick for a few hours. As I didn&#39;t want to let her down we had sex for the first time, with me teaching her tricks to jerk off while I sucked her dick and brought her to her first orgasm.  Then I fucked her ass and, well, ended up letting her fuck mine.&quot; Owen said<br />
<br />
&quot;It is a shame.  But don&#39;t give up, I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll get a girl who still has a pussy.&quot; Amelie said<br />
<br />
&quot;I hope so.  By the way, you&#39;re always together with Claire (you) and as far as I know she doesn&#39;t have a dick.  You must have fucked her a few times already, right?&quot; Owen said and you blushed when you heard it<br />
<br />
&quot;Not really, we haven&#39;t reached that level of intimacy.&quot; Amelie said<br />
<br />
Owen opened his mouth to say something else, but you interrupted the conversation and made up an excuse to pull Amelie away, embarrassed at the turn the conversation had taken.<br />
<br />
&quot;Owen is not a bad guy, but he has to learn to put limits on what he says.&quot; You said when you were on the street after getting off the bus on your way home<br />
<br />
&quot;I agree, but he is not so wrong.  I really want to fuck you someday and I&#39;ll admit I&#39;ve done a lot of jerking off imagining having sex with you.&quot; Amelie said<br />
<br />
You blushed with embarrassment and said &quot;I... the chance of that happening is not zero, but I don&#39;t know when.  I&#39;m just not ready yet.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just knowing I have a chance makes me excited.&quot; Amelie said and the bulge in her pants grew, making it clear that she had gone hard. &quot;Too excited.  I&#39;ll have to take care of it as soon as I get home.&quot; and said goodbye to you before they parted at a corner, each going to their own house.<br />
<br />
Later that night, you couldn&#39;t stop thinking about the conversation between Amelie and Owen and what she said on the way home. After so much thinking you have made a decision.  You decided that....</p>
