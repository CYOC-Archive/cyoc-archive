<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;...and lastly, you will be given a choice.  The nurse can administer a light sedative with a post hypnotic suggestion that you won't clearly remember any details of what happened during your encounter with Miss Smith.  That will be the end of this as far as you're concerned. Those of you opting for that may exit to the outer room and wait for her to call you into her office.  The rest of you may stay seated.  You have two minutes to decide, and yes, your parents have already authorized the use of this procedure.<br />
<br />
Claire watched the girls look at eachother.  This was the last batch, the ones directly affected by Jennifer Smith's curse.  Two stood, then several more.  When the two minutes were up, only one girl remained in the room with her.<br />
<br />
&quot;So what's the other choice, Principal Lyon?  I slip in the shower and break my neck?&quot;  Miranda “Mandy” Sanchez was smart, independent, and the frustration of every authority figure she came into contact with.<br />
<br />
Claire sighed and looked at the stubborn girl.  She'd been giving the Speech to groups of frightened students for close to three hours.  First the ones who'd only heard rumors, then the ones who started the rumors, then the witnesses to encounter in the bathroom and the locker room orgy, and finally now the participants.  Each version was a bit closer to the truth, all were intended to impress on the listener the importance of never talking about the Curse again.<br />
<br />
&quot;We're not going to kill you Miranda.  We strive to contain the damage caused by the town curse, but the authorities do not condone murder.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Death penalty.&quot; Miranda said looking pleased with herself.<br />
<br />
&quot;Convenient as that might be, you're a minor.  Even the best frame-up would only get you life in prison.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You say that like you've tested it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, /we/ haven't.&quot;  Clair watched comprehension dawn in the girl's eyes. &quot;But the civil authorities aren't the only ones who make sure the Curse remains a legend to most citizens.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So, what now? What are my options?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Once the Nurse is done with your classmates, your parents will get a suggestion of their own.  There'll be some paperwork, then they'll go home.  Your option is whether to be sedated, or come along quietly.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?!&quot;  Miranda stood up so fast her chair toppled over.  &quot;You can't do this, I have rights! I'll tell everything I know!  I'll--ow!&quot;  Miranda clutched at the dart in the side of her neck.  To the side of the room there was a blurring, and a small tidy looking man stepped out of a shadow.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mr Lyon,&quot; he said nodding at the principal, &quot;well done, I expected more bodies for transport.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just two Mr Shade, I'm catching a ride with you to the sanitarium.&quot;<br />
<br />
He cocked his head to the side and studied her a moment. &quot;A personal interest in one of the girls perhaps?&quot; His eyes flashed reddish in the light.<br />
<br />
&quot;Something to discuss with the oversight committee.&quot; The petite man flinched at the last words. &quot;Don't worry, I'll report you performed your duties adequately.&quot; A strand of spidery script glowed golden across the little man's forehead, and Claire caught the faintest whiff of scorched flesh and brimstone.  &quot;Temper temper, Mr Shade.&quot;<br />
<br />
He turned and stalked over to the unconscious teen. &quot;No free rides, I'm afraid.&quot;  The lights flickered, and Claire stood alone in the room.<br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
&quot;You can step out of there and get dressed Miss Lyon.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So formal?  Thanks Gena.  How'd I look?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Like any other healthy 26 year old supermodel slash pornstar it's been my privilege to examine.&quot;<br />
<br />
Claire rolled her eyes as she fastened her bra, careful not to put pressure on the sterile pads covering her abrasions. <br />
<br />
&quot;All frivolity aside, you're all woman now physically.  Your bloodwork may tell us a bit more, but if you decided to bear children I'd give you the go ahead.&quot;  Dr Gena Padjurni finished recording her notes and set down her tablet.  &quot;Do you mind my asking who she was?&quot;<br />
<br />
Clair blushed as she finished buttoning her blouse.  &quot;One of my students.  The teacher who found her misdiagnosed a gyno-centric sexual contact compulsion.  It caught me before I quite knew what I was doing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh the poor dear!  Was she...pretty?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She made the boy's locker room top ten as a freshmen, been #1 every year since.  I, I doubt many boys would look at her twice now.&quot;  Clair realized she was crying.  She was ashamed of having stolen Jennifer's beauty.  It would fade, she hoped it would fade like it had the other times, but in a way wasn't that worse? to have squandered the gift she'd stolen?<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm prescribing something to help you sleep and 48 hours of bedrest.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Gena, I have to report to the oversight committee.”<br />
<br />
“It'll have to wait until your bloodwork comes back.  Besides, someone cleared the halls from intake to third floor Danvers mansion of any 'women or predominantly female beings' about 20 minutes ago, so I'd guess your student is meeting with them now.”<br />
<br />
&quot;That's quick work.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gena shrugged &quot;If her curse is that inclusive they'll want her to strike a Bargain, if only to make housing her easier.&quot;<br />
<br />
Claire shivered and folded her arms across her chest, surprising herself again as she noticed how large her breasts had become.<br />
<br />
&quot;Gena? have them check my hormone levels, I think the final transformation might have unlocked another part of my curse.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Claire? are you alright?&quot;  Dr Padjurni walked over to look at her patient.<br />
<br />
&quot;No! No, stay back, I...&quot; Claire felt her fingers stroking the sides of her breasts.  She moaned as she dropped any semblance of discretion and began openly fondling herself.<br />
<br />
&quot;I am thinking something has indeed changed regarding your curse.&quot; Gena said watching her friend fondle herself.  &quot;Tell me, do you have any desire to touch me?&quot;<br />
<br />
Claire looked at her doctor in astonishment as she slipped her smock over her head and stood topless in front of her.  Gena apparently didn't bother with bras, and her dark nipples were tight and crinkled.<br />
<br />
&quot;G-Gena, I, I can't--&quot; Claire stopped trying to talk as Gena's mouth covered hers, her tongue slipping easily into Clair's mouth as they kissed. She let go of her breasts and took Gena's slender body in her arms.  Gena's deft fingers were removing her clothes as she slid Gena's pants and panties off. She lifted her doctor bodily off the floor and set her on an examining table, then crouched to spread her legs, but Gena's small brown hands stopped her, turning her face up to look at her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come come, if anyone is to play doctor here, surely it should be me?&quot;  Gena laughed gently, then slid back and turned to recline on the table, beckoning to the horny principal.  &quot;Come Claire, join me!&quot;<br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
Claire drowsed, her head pillowed on her doctor's breasts.  They'd made love, touched and explored for what seemed like hours. Gena had draped a lab coat over them as their bodies cooled off.<br />
<br />
&quot;I have been thinking about the wording of your curse.&quot; Claire listened to Gena's musical voice echo in her chest.  &quot;Since you did not drain any of my beauty, meager though it might be, we must conclude you are now a 'real fucking woman yourself', with an emphasis on the fucking I believe.&quot;<br />
<br />
Claire snuggled closer and wrapped her legs tighter around her lover's thigh. &quot;Yer not a meager beauty, yer plen'y beautiful.  Don' forget that.&quot; She stuck her tongue out and gave Gena's inviting nipple a lick, then leaned forward to suck on it and tease it with her tongue some more.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my goodness Claire! Surely you're not ready to go again so soon?&quot; Gena asked, running her hands down and squeezing her seducer's plump, inviting ass.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mmmm,&quot; Claire let Gena's breast slip from her mouth and buried her nose in the other woman's cleavage, breathing deeply of her spicy scent and the mingled sweat of their lovemaking. &quot;Well, I do have a five year dry spell to make up for,&quot; She murmured and began planting small kisses as she worked her way lower on her lover's body.</p>
