<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Annette and Giana were playing pool and smoking cigars with her new friends Carole and Marcella. &quot;Where do you suppose all the gals went to, Giana?&quot;, asked Annette.<br />
<br />
&quot;They&#39;re around here, somewhere&#39;s. What do you care? You&#39;re havin&#39; a good time, ain&#39;t ya?&quot; said Giana,&quot;This is life, huh, Anny?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah! It sure is!&quot;, Annete puffed on her cigar.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, slats, your shot, cough, cough!&quot;. Giana said to Carole with a loud cough.  Her eyes swelled up, and she felt dizzy. She and Annetta had meet Marcella and Carola, a couple from Park Slop, Brookln.  They were immersed in a game of pool when Giana decided to take a bong break.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow!&quot;  said Annetta.  &quot;That was some hit!&quot;<br />
<br />
Giana continued to cough, and pour a glass of water.  She drank it down, but another cough forced her to push it out. &quot;Damn.  Maybe you better sit down,&quot; said Annetta as she helped her friend onto the couch.<br />
 <br />
&quot;What&#39;s wrong with your friend?&quot; asked Marcella.  &quot;Is she too fucked up to play?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah!&quot; Carola joined in.  &quot;If you forfeit, we win!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She&#39;s fine,&quot; said Annetta as she turned to Giana, &quot;You&#39;re alright, right girl?  Just took a big hit?&quot;<br />
<br />
Giana shook her head, yes.  Her coughs puttering out. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well maybe if she slowed down a bit …&quot; said Marcella.<br />
<br />
Giana finally stopped coughing completely.  She wanted to tell Marcella to piss off.  She stood up, but soon realized she couldn&#39;t seem to speak.  She kept opening her mouth, but nothing came out. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ha!&quot; laughed Carola.  &quot;You coughed so hard that you&#39;ve lost your voice!&quot; <br />
<br />
Even Annetta couldn&#39;t help but laugh at this point.  Before Giana realized, everyone was laughing at her.  She could sort of feel her voice coming back.  As she started to talk, she again burst into loud coughing.  The three continued to laugh. <br />
<br />
&quot;Looks like you found your voice again!&quot; called Marcella. <br />
<br />
Suddenly, Giana&#39;s coughing skid into a lous bray.  Marcella, Carola, and Annetta stopped laughing. &quot;Giana?&quot; asked Annetta. &quot;Heeeeeee hawwwww!!!!&quot;&quot; Giana replied. <br />
<br />
&quot;Giana! What&#39;s going on?&quot; asked Carola.  &quot;Do you need some water?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;HEEHAW! HEEHAW! HEEHAW! HEEHAW! HEEHAW!&quot; Shocked, Giana grabbed her mouth.<br />
<br />
&quot;Get her another glass of water!&quot; ordered Annetta as she approached her friend.  Marcella ran over to the bar and grabbed a glass of water.  She went to give it to Giana, when suddenly her ears stood up on the sides of her head.  She dropped the bottle; she, Carola, and Annetta gasped.  Giana could feel the stretch of her ears and new weight on her head.  She grabbed them.  Sure enough, they were long and brown hairy.  She held them to the sides of her head, and soon felt a sensation in her palms.<br />
<br />
&quot;Those ears!&quot; said Annetta. &quot;That bray!&quot; said Marcella. &quot;Giana!  What&#39;s happening to you?!&quot; screamed Carola.<br />
<br />
What was happening was simple.  Marcella, Carola, Annetta, Giana all the others girls had all been doble-crossed.  Pleasure Island had a dark secret.  Sure, anyone can party all day and night and not care about rules, but to think that that doesn&#39;t come with a price is equally silly.  In this case, the Coachwoman discovered long ago that she could make a fortune by giving imprudent young girls a place where they could behave so recklessly that they made asses out of themselves.  She could then sell these asses for a hefty profit.  In time, everyone on the island would turn into donkeys. Giana was merely the first …<br />
<br />
Giana looked at herself in the large mirror behind the bar.  Terrified at the site of her donkey ears, she inadvertently brayed and then quickly covered her mouth.  Tears swelled up in her eyes, as her eyeliner streamed down her cheeks.  A sharp pull on her derriere pulled her up on her tippy-toes.  She stepped up and down as some force suspended her rear and arched her back.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s happening?!&quot; She thought, but brayed loudly instead.<br />
<br />
Marcella, Annetta, and Carola couldn&#39;t believe the site.  As Giana bent over to relieve some of the pressure in her butt, a long and brown tail burst out her backside, with a red tassel at the end, similar to her hair colour!<br />
<br />
&quot;I know what that is!&quot; screamed Marcella.  &quot;A donkey tail!&quot;<br />
<br />
Annetta began to cry.  &quot;Giana! I think you&#39;re turning into a donkey!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;HEEHAW! HEEHAW! HEEHAW! HEEHAW! HEEHAW! HEEHAW! HEEHAW!&quot; she brayed as she pulled her tail before her teary eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m getting the fuck out of here!&quot; yelled Carola. <br />
<br />
&quot;We can&#39;t leave her here like this!&quot; said Annetta.  &quot;What will happen to her?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If you really want to wait and find out, that&#39;s your choice!  We&#39;re out!&quot; <br />
<br />
Marcella and Carola ran out the door, slamming it behind them.<br />
<br />
Annetta turned back to Giana, who was scrunching her face in her hands. Giana started to grow a cute snout in her face.  &quot;HEEHAW! HEEHAW! HEEHAW! HEEEEEEEEEEE HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAWWW! she belted when she turned back to the mirror and saw a jennet snout in the reflection! <br />
<br />
Just then, the door swung open.  It was Marcella and Carola!  Carola had a pair of long gray donkey ears and a donkey tail!  Marcella shut the door just as tightly as they had opened it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Marcella! Carola!&quot;, shouted Annetta.<br />
<br />
&quot;HEEHAW! HEEHAW! HEEHAW! HEEHAW! HEEHAW!&quot;  Carola quickly covered her mouth. <br />
<br />
&quot;Carola!&quot; cried Annetta.  &quot;You&#39;re a donkey too! What the fuck is happening?!&quot;<br />
<br />
Marcella panted, but eventually caught her breath.  &quot;We ran towards the front gates, but they were locked!  We saw that lady! That Coachwoman that took us all here!  She … she was talking with these … these Ogres!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Get to the point,&quot; cried Annetta.  &quot;What&#39;s going on?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s all over for us!  We&#39;re fucked!  We will be donkeys!&quot;, Marcella shouted.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?!&quot;, Annette asked.<br />
<br />
Then, thin brown hairs started overtaking Giana&#39; body, making it look evermore asinine.  Lighter-shaded hairs grew around her eyes. Soon there was nothing left of Giana&#39;s face at all; her head was completely one of a donkey!  She brayed louder to bemoan her terrible condition.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just look at Giana!&quot; screamed Marcella.  &quot;We&#39;re turning into donkeys!  That Coachwoman brought us here for the sole purpose of turning us into jackasses!  Carola started the same way!  She lost her voice, then grew ears, and just now that tail!&quot;<br />
<br />
Giana began to grab bottles off the bar and smashed the mirror with them, trying to destroy her reflection.  As she grabbed one last bottle, her hand spasmed, and she dropped it.  She fell to her knees, braying loudly, going back and forth squeezing her hands, which swelled up more and more with each passing second.  Her hands cloved, and she had what looked like two chubby fingers on both her hands.  She couldn&#39;t take the feeling and started to shake them.  She wanted to grab onto something, but her ahsdn felt like they were being squished in a vice every time she tried to open them.  Her four chubby fingernails began to spew a black glue-like substance over her hands, fusing the four large fingers into two solid hooves!  Her feet burst out the back of her sneakers, emitting the same black goop!<br />
<br />
&quot;GianaAAAAAAWWW!!!&quot; screamed Annetta.<br />
<br />
&quot;Annetta!&quot; cried Marcella.<br />
<br />
&quot;HEEHAW! HEEHAW! HEEHAW! HEEHAW! HEEHAW! HEEHAW! HEEHAW! HEEHAW! HEEHAW!&quot; Annetta replied.<br />
<br />
Carola started to bray uncontrollably too.  Her nose pulling itself away from her face.<br />
<br />
Giana staggered over to Annetta.  She could still remain upright, but it was tough.  Her tail was moving back and forth uncontrollably, telling the story of her torment that her mouth could no longer say.  She tried to grab Annetta&#39;s pink dress but only pawed at her.  Annetta&#39;s ears suddenly sprung up on the sides of her head, they were covered with brown fur.<br />
<br />
&quot;HEE HAW!&quot; brayed Marcella from behind her. The donkey Giana looked over at Marcella, and lost her balance.  She fell down to the floor and started to bray frenziedly!  Giana kicked with her hind legs the coffee table, the pool table, the chairs and any object that was placed in front of her.<br />
<br />
Then, a brown donkey tail sprouted from Annetta&#39;s pink dress, it had a blonde-haired tassel at the end. Annetta tried to rip it out of her rear with her hands, but each pull hurted her butt.<br />
<br />
The door kicked open and a gang of ogres stormed in. Giana could only bray and cry as they pulled her, Annetta, Carola, and Marcella out of the house, threw them and all the other girls in the cages on the backs of the pickup trucks.</p>
