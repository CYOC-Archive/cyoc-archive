<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Nick stared at Jeff&#39;s computer. He wondered why Rebecca and Jeff&#39;s names were next to each other. It was almost as if this Chronivac program believed that they were the same person, which was definitely not true. There would be no way in the world that Jeff was Rebecca. And there would be zero chance that his dad would be so attracted to Rebecca if she was really Jeff.<br />
<br />
Nick shook his head of such thoughts. He needed a boyfriend. Just as Jeff&#39;s computer made a small chime sound, he heard his dad call up to him, &quot;Nick, you home? Come downstairs and watch the game with us! We ordered pizza!&quot; While the idea of being in the same room as Rebecca and his dad did not appeal to Nick, the lure of pizza did.<br />
<br />
&quot;Coming!&quot; he called out. He walked away from Jeff&#39;s computer and downstairs. Thankfully, Rebecca and Nick&#39;s dad had separated. The football game was still going, and a box of pizza was resting on the coffee table. He sat down on the couch next to his dad. He stared at the TV as the game continued. It was his dad&#39;s favorite team against their rival. Nick enjoyed football as much as his dad but didn&#39;t like this particular team. The rival was actually Nick&#39;s favorite team, but he would never admit it to his dad. He reached for a slice of pizza. His dad held out an arm.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not without a plate,&quot; he said. &quot;Get one from the kitchen.&quot; Nick grunted in exasperation and walked into the kitchen. He grabbed a plate and filled a cup with water. He glanced up into the living room. He frowned in confusion. Were Rebecca&#39;s shoulders always that wide? And did his dad always have a thick head of hair? He stared at the two for a few minutes, trying to decipher what he was looking at.<br />
<br />
His confusion turned to alarm as Rebecca&#39;s cheerleading uniform top somehow changed. It turned into a football jersey that represented Nick&#39;s favorite team. As it changed, her breasts began to shrink into her chest. Her torso continued to widen. Rebecca&#39;s hair darkened as it grew shorter and shorter. Pretty soon, Rebecca had a crew cut with dark brown hair. Her make-up seemed to dissolve into thin air. Her lipstick vanished as her lips grew thinner. The mascara faded from existence while her eyelashes became less pronounced. Her jawline lost its roundness and grew firm and cut. An Adam&#39;s apple began pushing out against her throat. She coughed, producing a voice that definitely did not sound feminine.<br />
<br />
Nick&#39;s dad&#39;s team suddenly fumbled the ball, and Nick&#39;s team got it back. Rebecca clapped while Nick&#39;s dad pumped his fist in the air with joy. Nick now saw changes in his dad. The lines in his face were disappearing. The gray in his hair receded as the rest of his hair changed to a thick dark brown color. He had never had that color of hair. The rotund stomach that stuck out slightly was shrinking. His dad&#39;s chest was growing thicker in contrast. His legs also grew thicker while his jeans warped into red gym shorts. His worn blue t-shirt seemed to shrink as it began to accentuate his dad&#39;s growing muscles. He looked like he was in his early 30s as opposed to his late 40s.<br />
<br />
&quot;You find that plate, Nick?&quot; Rebecca called out in a deep voice that seemed to ignite a fire in Nick&#39;s dick. &quot;You&#39;re missing the game.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, yeah,&quot; Nick quickly said. He walked back into the living room. Interestingly, Rebecca and Nick&#39;s dad had moved to either end of the couch, leaving the only seat being in between the two of them. Nick swallowed nervously and sat down on the couch.<br />
<br />
He couldn&#39;t take his eyes off of Rebecca. From the waist up, she definitely looked like a man in his 20s. Her (his?) arms swelled with muscle as a light dusting of hair grew on them. Nick glanced down and saw Rebecca&#39;s waist narrow. Her cheerleading skirt warped into a pair of blue gym shorts. Her legs lengthened and thickened more rapidly than his dad&#39;s legs were.<br />
<br />
Speaking of his dad, Nick looked over and noticed that his dad&#39;s worn shirt had warped into an athletic, tank-top. Nick was able to easily see how defined his dad&#39;s arm muscles were. His pecs pushed out against the tank-top impressively. Nick could feel his dick starting to swell as he stared at those muscles. His breath caught when his dad looked at him. The face didn&#39;t look at all like his dad but was incredibly handsome and attractive. His dad looked like he was in his 20s now. Nick felt his heart flutter a little as he stared into those deep blue eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Like something you see?&quot; Nick&#39;s dad asked him with a smirk in a deep voice. Nick bit his lip, unsure of how to answer. &quot;Come here, handsome.&quot; To Nick&#39;s surprise and shock, Nick&#39;s dad put an arm around him and pulled him in close. Their lips were pressed firmly against each other. To add to Nick&#39;s surprise, he found himself kissing back. His hands began to caress his dad&#39;s large pecs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey now, don&#39;t steal all the fun,&quot; Nick&#39;s dad&#39;s voice said. But his dad didn&#39;t say it. Another arm wrapped around Nick and pulled him away from his dad, turning him around. Nick gasped, for breath and out of surprise. Rebecca looked exactly like Nick&#39;s dad. He gave Nick the same smirk and kissed him deeply. Rebecca seemed more excitable than Nick&#39;s dad because he stuck his tongue in Nick&#39;s mouth. Nick moaned. His dad began to sensuously kiss the back of his neck. Nick&#39;s thoughts were erratic. This had to be a dream of some sort. Nothing in the world could feel as good as this. Some other, different thoughts entered his mind. He wasn&#39;t really sure what to make of them. Rebecca removed his mouth from Nick&#39;s and moved down his neck. Nick continued to moan, including their names.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t stop, Jason,&quot; he moaned. Where had that name come from? And who was he referring to?<br />
<br />
&quot;And what should I do?&quot; his dad hissed into Nick&#39;s ear suddenly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, god, Jared!&quot; Nick moaned louder in response. A wave of pleasure raced down in his spine. Jared? But his dad&#39;s name was John. What is going on?</p>
