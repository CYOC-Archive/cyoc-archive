<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After what seemed like an eternity of endless pumping, Katy regained her senses. She looked around, embarrased..but also grateful Clara hadn't gotten back yet. She moved to put the dildo back in it's box. Why had she wanted to use it so badly? She didn't feel anything for it now. She went to the box. Her eyes caught on the collar. She had a strange urge to put it on. &quot;Oh, not again.&quot; she thought to herself. Still, her longing to put it on won out, and she out the dildo back in the box, and fastened the collar around her neck. <br />
<br />
Clara, who had opened the door a crack without Katy noticing, was watching her take out the collar. When Katy fastened it around her neck, Clara burst in. She quickly turned Katy around to face her, and looked into her eyes. They both felt a little tingle, and it was over. Katy was about to stammer an excuse, until Clara said, be quiet. No matter how hard she tried, Katy couldn't utter a word. <br />
Clara laughed. &quot;Well now, I think I can explain myself without any interruption. You see, that collar and the dildo I found in a strange store in the mall. It was in a beatifully carved box, and I asked how much it was. The owner laughed, and said that if I were to buy the box, I'd have to take what was inside of it too. I asked what its contents were. Then, the owner leaned in forward and told me all about it. I laughed, not believing his story, until he took the box and opened it in front of me. I saw those items like you did, and like you, I wanted to try out that dildo. <br />
<br />
The owner stopped me, saying that the dildo was merely the instrument to inject the magical particles connected to the collar. The collar, when worn by the person who used the instrument, reacts with the magic particles already in your body. It also has a bit of the essence of the last person who touched it, which would be me. Don't ask me the specifics on how all of this works, but here's the basics. I have control over you. I can even change your body! The only limitations are that I can only change oyur body in ways relating to the instrument which delivered the magic particles into you. I can stretch that rule a bit, but not much.&quot;<br />
<br />
Clara grinned. &quot;I want to test this some more..&quot; Katy started to get up, to run away. Clara amusedly let her reach the door before saying, &quot;Stop.&quot; Katy stopped dead in her tracks. &quot;Now close the door..&quot; Katy closed the door. &quot;Walk to me.&quot; said Clara, and watched Katy go to her. &quot;Alright, you can move on your own now, but remember, any escape is futile.&quot; &quot;Bitch. I thought we were friends.&quot; spat out Katy. Clara laughed. &quot;Well..I think you're the bitch now.&quot; she said. &quot;Oh..I have an idea..&quot;  Clara stood there for a second, grinning. &quot;So are you going to get on with it or not?&quot; Katy snapped. &quot;Oh, go fuck yourself, I'm trying to think!&quot; said Clara, annoyed. Katy walked off to the bathroom without a word. As an afterthought, Clara changed Katy's mind so that she would not think of going for help. Clara sat down on her bed to gather her thoughts on how she could use her new slave. She lay back. Just to rest her eyes. The day had been hectic and tiring.<br />
<br />
Clara awoke to the sound of a woman moaning. Clara glanced at a clock. She'd napped for about 40 minutes. She got up. Who was moaning? It sounded like the person was in pain..no, not pain..pleasure. For some reason this made her feel a little excited. She got up and followed the sounds to the bathroom. She opened the door. There, on the floor, was the nude frame of Katy, fingering herself. Her pussy looked red and inflamed, as she kept at it. Clara then remembered what she had said to Katy. &quot;Go fuck yourself.&quot; Katy must have been at it since she said that. Katy, unable to stop, tried to keep her moans down as she endlessly pleasured herself. Clara stood there for a minute, trying to figure out the feelings she was getting. She felt something damp in her panties. She was wet! But she wasn't a lesbian! She had a boyfriend and everything! <br />
<br />
&quot;But wait.&quot; She thought to herself. She remembered when her best friend, Allison and her went swimming once. She had caught herself sneaking a few peeks at her friend's beautiful ass and slim frame, her breasts tightly constrained by the bikini she wore. But she had banished those thoughts. And that was only once. Still, she couldn't deny the feelings she had right now. Clara bit her lip. She could stop Katy from doing this and think about the original things she was going to make her do..or, she could watch her some more, maybe..play around with her a bit. She did have control over Katy's body. But doing that would be admitting to herself that she got aroused over women.<br />
<br />
Clara opened her mouth to speak...</p>
