<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">To awaken there in a stall, in some barn, being then naked and feeling the prickly straw bedding covering th barn floor where he laid, Carl still limp and weak has then time to think.<br />
<br />
Still in a state of disbelief to what the technician had said to him, Carl thinks the man and where they since had put him, was all but some weird hoax.<br />
<br />
Stirring some there as he lay on the dry straw bedding, Carl looks at his hand then hands, seeing they look darker of color than he remembered. He looks at his forearms, they too are darker still, his skin there blacker yet. Feeling as if well resting and like had slept for the entire night, Carl tried to rise up to a sitting position.<br />
<br />
This became a struggle, his arm though not limp anymore, failed to work for him as they had for so many years. He finally got himself to a sitting position but it felt rather tentative, as his rump seemed definitely more muscular, the butt as sold of toned muscle made sitting there requiring his constant need to prop him upright by using his arms and hands.<br />
<br />
The common sounds from within a barn, that of animals moving about in other stalls such as where Carl found himself placed. The occasional whinny or snorting noises made by horses in the barn seemed to Carl as if he should respond and do the same. Feeling ever so stiff, he tried stretching first this arm and then the other, doing his back which hurt after that merciless jab of the technician with a syringe wriggling up and into his spinal nerve.<br />
<br />
An aching head began as still his vision had no color, only a complex pattern of gray tone, so similar to his watching black and white old movies on television.<br />
<br />
Pulsing is the ache in his head, Carl feeling the ache more to the front of his head, he raises a hand there to touch, massage, and try to rub away the pain. Touching his head brings the immediate notation that up there he has only very short hair on his head, that there with the strange exception he sports a Mohawk haircut, the hair sticking up in a long hedge feels very coarse, almost like a stiff brush.<br />
<br />
Arms feeling limp, Carl must urge his arm to lift and reach, he using his one hand to touch and follow the Mohawk hairline as it was, cresting the top of his head, and trailing back along his neck, he finds it truly an oddity that the stripe of hair stretches stiffly to the center of his shoulder-blades on his back. This seems so odd that when retracing his stretched touch of his head, he is astonished to discover there his ears, they standing tall, furry inside and out, are then as pointed ears like those on a horse or pony.<br />
<br />
Real concern comes into his thoughts then, as Carl wonders seriously then if what the technician said, was in harsh fact the truth.<br />
<br />
Fearing his situation, Carl feels the onslaught of that morning first urge to vacate his bladder of the built-up load of urine from sleeping soundly all the night through. He feels than his penis begin to rise to the occasion, as looking down what he sees next makes him want to scream and stand up on his feet.<br />
<br />
Horror struck, Carl eyes down the front of his body, seeing again that blacker than common skin color, and setting above his groin is then there a sheath, and emerging from it is coming out not his penis, but that equal to his having a cock looking just like they do on a horse. Sensations and the urgent need to release a hearty flow from out his strained bladder, Carl using the stall wall lifts himself upright, to soon standing there by that plank wall, he sees his horse cock hanging flaccidly limp but getting stiffer.<br />
<br />
Excitement and the rush flow of adrenaline does the trick, this brings the huge and very long cock member to a full state of an erection. So different is his cock then, the length as long and longer than is his forearms, it sports not his circumcision done at birth, but the head of his member is perfectly flat, the glands below being puffed up into a tapered back ringing, the cock-head reminds Carl of a toilet plunger as in shape, coloration, and bulk weight.<br />
<br />
Then the rush, urine streaks down and along the tub inside his cock. it shooting forth in a harsh stream of horrid stench, its color of urine seems to vary from bright light glint to that of somewhat darker his urine as it blasts out the open end of his long cock. <br />
<br />
Sensations seem to be running wild as he stood there, his need to pee finished quickly, but the erect state of his then horse cock remained stiff and seemingly, getting stiffer yet. Carl watched as then his cock continued its rising to stand poised in a 45 degree upward angle away from his groin and sheath. The raunchy extra horny feeling of want to try or then to enjoy bestial lust and mate as would then a horse with a mare, began to build like a shaky wall of ideals and wants in his thoughts.<br />
<br />
Touching the elongated cock with his left hand, the horniness urged Carl to want and then try stroking along its great length. He discovered soon the the soft and especially tender sensation of the black cock skin. As he stroked the cock a sensation began to work into a fevered desire to unload a load, he looking around for just some willing mare for him to try his luck at equine fornication.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, no, this is all wrong, I am a man not an animal!&quot; Carl said aloud, his statement even to him then seemed as a vain love-lost hope quickly fading as with continued stroking of his cock then erupted his ejaculation of semen. Roaring out the end of his huge cock, the semen looked quite different, creamier as if his sperm count were in the billions. The stream of his semen shot the distance out of him with such force, it flew six feet away, splattering on and sticking well to the door of his barn stall.<br />
<br />
Moaning as he tried to calm his nervous passions, the voice of a man spoke, it another technician, dressed in a white laboratory jacket and having a number of ink pens jammed in a chest-high pocket.<br />
<br />
&quot;Excellent, ejaculation is an important step in the positive direction of effectively depleting the testicles of remaining human semen, and allowing thereafter the production of wholly equine semen. As from the stream and glob of it stuck here on the stall door, I believe your tenure here as a Haflinger stallion and stud, you might well see some added years of public service added to you duty roster. This will by then be not such a foreboding a thought as now, for and after you become a stallion, the rites to mating as a horse with mares tends to debase all concerns about wanting anything other than to stand behind a horny mare and give her what ails you both, that the need to mate.<br />
<br />
Your last few days of chemically induced deep sleep has aided well in the rush to reformat your skeletal structure, as soft tissue parts of your body have reconsolidated nicely to being equine shaped.<br />
<br />
Just to see you face and the way you can still show some expression of your mental concerns, you flare your nostrils rightly, and the eyes, how they do strain to show the whites in and around your eyes.  As in a short few days from today you will sport then a tail, this and your new cock will be as much as you need to show what you think and of what satisfies your wants.<br />
<br />
a week from today I suspect is when the changes that happen continue rightly, the order will come for you to try and mount, hump, and impregnate your first mare. You might like the others who get to that point, still thinking then as if you are a human and by mating with a animal your self-esteem shall suggest what you do is a sin, but being by a few more weeks of final changes, what will mate then shall be you as in your full form of a stallion wanting, lusting to be a farm stud.&quot; So said the technician, he seemed proud of the accomplishment, that of making a human person become as a brute animal.<br />
<br />
Saddened to learn what he had a hope was some perverted hoax put upon his person, Carl sheds a tear, knowing down deep in his chest, he shall never see his mother, father, friends, or have the thrills of a young man.</p>
