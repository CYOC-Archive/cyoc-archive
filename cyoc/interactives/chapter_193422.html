<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Amelia followed the advice given to her and stayed at home for most of the week, only going out to buy grocery when she began running out.<br />
<br />
Over the week her worries didn&#39;t really stop. Due to her now confirmed active virus, she began her own research to find out what would happen to her now. She found out about the three categorized symptoms and found out how usually a single penis will grow every week until the virus becomes inactive again. The second and third symptom group worried her the most. After all there was the possibility that she wouldn&#39;t be able to hide her affliction at all. What would everyone think of her? She wouldn&#39;t be able to go out at all.<br />
<br />
Nevertheless, she decided to go to the party on the weekend anyway. She really started to miss the comfort of being around Mike. He was also worried about her, so they texted each other, but Amelia didn&#39;t admit that Dicksprout had started within her. She just couldn&#39;t tell him - Instead she told him that she caught a cold, and that she would try to get healthy by Saturday.<br />
<br />
However, every time she started chatting with Mike, she experienced the same thing: Her left breast had been swelling up slightly since Monday. It kinda became fuller and rounder and it slowly started to press against her bra, so she decided not to wear them anymore unless she went out. She was worried about this oddity. Hopefully it was only something cause by hormonal imbalance, but then again she felt nothing was wrong anywhere else on her body, so could it really be anything else?<br />
<br />
Everytime she stopped chatting with Mike, she realized that she felt very hot and she could feel her chest heaving as she breathed heavily. It always ended up with her masturbating to get rid of those thoughts. She also started caressing her left breast more and more with every single time, this was the only way for her to stop the ache. On Friday however, it was extremely bad. After another round of late night texting with Mike, she felt hot and bothered again, this time she only massaged her left breast and she felt extremely light-headed. After some time she came by only fondling her breast, and worst of all a white fluid started flowing out of her breast. No way right? Lactation? She was definitely not pregnant or anything like that, so this was extremely anxiety inducing.<br />
<br />
She decided that it must just been a odd side effect of the Virus, so she showered, all while still feeling her left breast weighing down on her chest. looking in the mirror it was clear that by now her left breast had grown fuller and rounder than her right breast. She tried to shake the thoughts out of her head. After all there was nothing that could be done, so she went to sleep, looking forward to seeing Mike again tomorrow.<br />
<br />
--- The Next Day ---<br />
<br />
This day, Amelia texted with Mike again. Today, she finally felt like smiling again. All her worries started being drowned out by the thought of seeing Mike at the party that evening. So she passed most of the day with nothing out of the ordinary occurring.<br />
<br />
After she arrived at the party, Mike greeted her cheerfully. Most of the guests had already arrived and started drinking. It was very crowded, but Amelia could just make it through there with some alcohol. She didn&#39;t really become all that more open, but she managed to hold some conversations. All the while, her left breast felt like it needed more attention with every passing second. Since it had swollen so much, she couldn&#39;t wear any of her bras anymore. So she instead went with a sweater that would obscure her nipples silhouette.<br />
<br />
After Mike was done with all the organizing, he came to talk to Amelia. They chatted and it felt like hours passed in minutes. Mike said that he was very happy to see that Amelia was healthy again and that she felt somewhat comfortable there. After some time, Amelia felt slightly dizzy again and felt extremely hot. Must have been the alcohol, right?<br />
<br />
&quot;Woah, are you really alright?&quot;<br />
<br />
Mike caught Amelia as she tipped over, now with her head leaning against his chest. She swayed back to escape that situation, but Mike caught her again as she nearly fell again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Actually... I don&#39;t feel that well right now...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, if you don&#39;t mind I&#39;ll take you to my room.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah...&quot;<br />
<br />
Mike let her lean against his shoulder as he lead her to his room upstairs. The sounds of the party were now not so loud anymore. Mike helped Amelia sit down on his bed. All that movement made him realize that he also felt pretty tipsy.<br />
<br />
&quot;You should take it easy if you just were sick you know.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah - Oh I feel so hot...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm?&quot;<br />
<br />
Mike reached up to Amelias forehead. She was clearly burning up!<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you sure it was just a cold!?&quot;<br />
<br />
Mike helped Amelia take off the sweater. By now he could see how Amelias left breast was clearly a bit larger than the other one.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whats wrong with your chest? Are you alright?&quot;<br />
<br />
Amelia snapped out of her trance.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, you can&#39;t see!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nothing but don&#39;t look!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Listen- if there is anything wrong, please let me know. You... are very important to me! Please tell me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, but promise that you won&#39;t hate me, okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I could never hate you. I promise.&quot;<br />
<br />
Amelia, still very drunk, took off her shirt as well as she started explaining-<br />
<br />
&quot;Last Monday I was confirmed to have active Dicksprout. Since then my left breast started swelling until it reached this size.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mike, despite his drunk state, felt extremely embarrassed. The girl he loved was just casually showing her breasts to him! Wait, what&#39;s that.<br />
<br />
Mike and soon enough Amelia saw that her nipple had started widening at the base. Amelia started to feel it stretching to an unnaturally big size. It was now around an inch wide!<br />
<br />
Just as they were both left puzzled, something pushed out of the hole. I was clearly the glans of a penis. As it slid out, with a slight wet glimmering it got half-erect. It was roughly 5 inches long now. A fluid which looked like milk was slowly coming out of the hole. In the last week a full-fledged dick had been growing in her breast.<br />
<br />
Amelia felt tears approach.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mike, I-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s alright. I&#39;ll take care of this.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mike came closer and carefully lifted Amelias left breast. And took the penis with the other, touching the glans. Amelia recoiled in pleasure, the touch sending shivers down her spine and sensations that she never felt before. All anxiety and fear of the situation vanished as pleasure took over her mind.<br />
<br />
Mike started to slowly stroke her nipple-dick and overcame all his negative thoughts. This is the girl he loved. He had to accept her, no matter what happened to her!<br />
<br />
Mike came closer again, and took the nipple-dick into his mouth, now full-on sucking the penis. Amelia looked down at him. Perhaps this was all just a blessing in disguise. Amelia felt Mike licking the dick all around. She felt the most pleasure when his tongue came in contact with the bottomside of her glans.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m- cumming!&quot;<br />
<br />
Mike felt his mouth being filled with milk from her breast. Clearly this dick didn&#39;t shoot sperm but instead used what was available most close by. The milk tasted slightly sweet to him. He swallowed it all. He lifted up to meet Amelias eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mike, I&#39;m so glad to know you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mike went in for the kiss and soon enough they both fell asleep, hugging each other on the bed.</p>
