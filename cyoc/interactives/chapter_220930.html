<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Nami followed a dark line of magic from the Grand Library; she followed it to a nearby lake, seeing it lead into the water. She scowled as she couldn’t proceed any further.<br />
‘Wait,’ Nami thought; ‘I’m an angel that looks like the sea. I wonder’, her thought trails off as she places one foot into the water; then the second. The water felt soothing to her; she felt home. Continuing to walk in the lake as she absently shucked off her robe, Nami soon had her head underwater; she then kicked off of the muddy bottom and started to swim to the centre of the lake, she kept the line of dark energy in sight as she traveled deeper into the lake. Then she spotted it; a sitar in the muddy silt. The source of the dark energy. Nami was about to destroy it when she remembered Enoch’s words; ‘Map out exactly were the strands of energy that are powering the chaos bubble. Locate the source which should be a sitar, but don’t destroy it just yet.’<br />
<br />
‘Done and done,’ Nami smiling; ‘her sharp shark like teeth showing as she effortlessly swims back to the shore.<br />
“Funny,” Nami looks at herself as she gets out of the water; “I wasn’t starving for oxygen.”<br />
“Because it looks like you got gills,” Enoch landing short by; folding up his wings as he walks towards her. Enoch watches as three horizontal slits that rest below the blue angel’s rib cage slowly close up as Nami’s lungs begin to work in metabolizing air. “I guess looking like the ocean means you can breathe it as well,” Enoch watching Nami look on amazed as she sees her gills for the first time.<br />
<br />
“There is one of those heavy instruments at the bottom of the lake,” Nami looking pleased with herself; “I followed the energy line down there.”<br />
“You should put your robe back on,” Enoch smirking; “this isn’t hell, clothing is a bit of a requirement.”<br />
If it were possible, Nami would have gone red in the face with embarrassment as she quickly dashes to her discarded robe and hastily puts it on. Covering a majority of her dark blue skin; covering her womanly assets, while allowing her ocean wave like wings to remain unhindered. She pulls back her seaweed like hair and is amazed at how dry it is; despite just being in the water and that it looks like it was just plucked from the sea itself.<br />
“Downside to having gills I guess,” Nami rolling her eyes; “perhaps I should visit a tailor to get something more form fitting then this.”<br />
“A two piece bikini or a one piece swimsuit would do,” Enoch responding; “assuming of course it doesn’t cause a scene. But don’t take what I say as gospel,” the wolftaur adding; “I’ve only been an angel for less than twenty four hours now.”<br />
“What were you before,” Nami responding; “If its not too much. Human?”<br />
“Demon,” Enoch smiling; “I’m the eldest son of Lucifer, the devil himself.”<br />
<br />
*******************************<br />
<br />
Earlier; Enoch was soaring through the skies enjoying the freedom of being among the clouds. ‘Becoming an angel did have its perks,’ Enoch though as he flapped his dove like wings. Wings that were situated on his tauric wolf half. Enoch soon realized that he was the only tauric angel to possess wings; it made him unique and already several angels that he few past, quickly took notice. But he didn&#39;t take to the skies just to have an aimless flight; he was following a line of chaos magic to its source. He was heading to the top of what looks like a large apartment complex for angels. Every balcony acted as a launch pad for winged angels as they took off and landed; smiling as he knew they too would soon be seeing more of him.<br />
<br />
Enoch lands on the roof; all four of his paws touching the gravel on tar mixture. Enoch winced in pain as the surface was extremely hot on the pads of his paws.<br />
“Shit that burns,” Enoch dashing to a shady spots thanks to what he is assuming is a mechanical penthouse. “And it looks like my quarry rests in this room;” Enoch making a mental note as he observes the energy coming from an intake louver.”<br />
<br />
*******************************<br />
<br />
Hank Cromwell, former Iron Knight; now and angel with blue wings and sapphire like eyes was walking through a district in heaven that looked like the French Quarter of New Orleans; bars and various restaurants at every corner in all the rambling streets. The road paved in cobblestone, Cromwell thought he was walking through an old part of the city; he wasn’t fully wrong. This was an old part of heaven, the buildings heavily renovated over the centuries; either due to time or the odd demon incursion prior to peace treaty with hell. But Cromwell spotted his intended purpose, a clothing shop; he needed a new robe or clothing as he is no longer an inquisitor. Forswearing the inquisition after witnessing Reverend Church torture to the point of death, the green angel named Tarfeil. Feeling alone after witnessing the inquisition arrest Azure; and angel with the hind legs of a zebra, her torso and arms covered in cheetah fur and the wings of a blue jay.<br />
<br />
An hour later Cromwell left the shop feeling better with the new wardrobe he has acquired. Blue shoes, a pair of white pants, with blue trim; along with a cream colored short sleeve shirt with openings in the back to allow his wings to move freely; wings that he has yet to try as Cromwell is still a new angel by about two days. He already noted a few locations in which he saw the chaos energies congregate as he explored the city; he even saw Tarfeil and Inari the kitsune angel fly above, he was confident that they too saw the locations of the same chaos energies so began to meet up with the party.<br />
<br />
*******************************<br />
<br />
An hour later.<br />
“Here is where we found a large concentration of chaos magic,” Inari pointing to a map of the heavenly city that Enoch managed to procure; methods that no one was interested in knowing, they were glad to be able to mark the location down.<br />
“I saw one here,” Cromwell pointing to the area near the tailor he visited; there was also one in a kitchen. The cook was less than pleased to see me walking into his domain.”<br />
“Dressed like that,” Enoch looking at Cromwell and noting his new attire; “I can imagine.”<br />
“I was still wearing my inquisitor robe,” Cromwell responding; “I believe it was the one thing that kept the chef from going crazy.”<br />
“Not many angels have much love for the inquisitors,” Tarfeil glaring at the Inquisitorial headquarters; “some think they were given too much power and they have run around unchecked for too long.”<br />
“I spotted a sitar at the bottom of the lake,” Nami eager to speak up; “I think I have gills.”<br />
“It’s true,” Enoch nodding as he circles the spot Nami mentioned; “saw them and more. But it wasn’t on purpose,” Enoch looking at Tarfeil who didn’t looked pleased to hear Enoch seeing her lover naked. “And there is one up here,” Enoch pointing to the apartment building.”<br />
“That is where I live,” Tarfeil sighing; “sorry, where we will be living, Nami.”<br />
<br />
“That looks like all of them,” Enoch taking off his shade; “now we wreck them.”<br />
“How,” Cromwell looking at Enoch; watching the wolftaur as he waves a hand and watches as all the sitars they spotted and noted come falling out of several portals in on large heap.<br />
“Like this,” Enoch summoning his energy blade and using to slash each instrument; destroying them instantly.<br />
“Oh look,” Nami looking at the sky; “the bubble is falling.”<br />
“But what is that thing,” Cromwell seeing a cloud of black smoke floating before it proceeds to race to their location.<br />
“Get behind me,” Enoch readying his blade again; “that is a chaos shade.”<br />
<br />
The formless mass of smoke rushed the party as both Tarfeil and Inari flew away. Cromwell and Nami both run behind Enoch; Nami rushing to lake while Cromwell just heads towards a shop. Enoch just snarls as he readies to strike the approaching shade; pouncing as he unfurls his wings to fly to the creature. He makes a swift slash with his blade; feeling resistance as it bites into the shade, he hears is moan and howl as it starts to fade and dissolve. Enoch flaps his wings as he watches the remaining portion of the chaos bubble finally collapse and fade away.<br />
“Now,” Enoch willing his energy blade away; “let’s see you put that bubble back up.”<br />
<br />
********************<br />
<br />
Semyaza nearly collapsed in pain as he felt the chaos shade die; he used to much energy to cast it as he created the chaos field that allowed him to keep the library closed while he pillaged its private vaults for juicy secrets regarding chaos. Confident that he has everything he needs, Semyaza beats a hasty retreat from the library; using portal magic to take him back to his private quarters within the inquisitorial headquarters. Stepping through and placing his pilfered texts on the table; Semyaza quickly sits down as he pours himself a glass of wine.<br />
“You are thorough Enoch; I’ll give you that,” Semyaza sipping his wine. “But I now have what I need, so I’ll let you have this little victory;” Semyaza sips his wine again as he opens one of the books he acquired and begins to plumb its secrets.</p>
