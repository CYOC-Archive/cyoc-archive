<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ben woke up in the middle of the night on the couch, the TV still playing some late-night reruns. He rubbed his eyes and noticed Noah on the other side of the couch, snoring softly and wearing only his boxers. Ben knew that Noah was a heavy sleeper, and talking to him wouldn&#39;t wake him up. <br />
<br />
Ben could not get the thoughts out of his mind about the other night with Noah and his friends after the Halloween party.<br />
<br />
What happened with Noah’s biceps was just wild. And even crazier, he seemed to be the only one that remembered it.<br />
He needed to find out if he was losing his mind.<br />
<br />
Ben knew exactly what he wanted to try to change this time.<br />
<br />
He needed to get Noah to talk to him about his dick. “Guess I could just bring it up.. But what if he doesn’t bite.”<br />
<br />
“Oh!” Ben knows. Time to get creative.<br />
<br />
Ben says, &quot;Hey man, you won&#39;t believe what I heard from one of my buddies on the soccer team.&quot;<br />
<br />
Noah groggily replies, &quot;What&#39;s up?&quot;<br />
<br />
Ben continues, &quot;So you know how my friend Danny is on the soccer team? Well, he said he heard some guys talking in the locker room about ... ahem... your package.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;About a what?&quot; Noah questions.<br />
<br />
&quot;About your monster cock, man.&quot;<br />
<br />
Noah mumbles and rubs his eyes, &quot;What the...what are you talking about?&quot;<br />
<br />
Ben leans in, &quot;Come on man, you know what I&#39;m talking about.”<br />
“All the guys are talking about how someone is packing a serious size down there. It&#39;s all anyone&#39;s talking about in the locker room.&quot;<br />
<br />
Noah looks a little bewildered, eyes still closed, &quot;I have no idea what you&#39;re talking about, Ben.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ben grins, &quot;Oh come on, don&#39;t act dumb. You&#39;re the only one who fits the description. We all know you&#39;re hung like a horse.&quot;<br />
<br />
Noah’s silent.<br />
<br />
Ben adds, &quot;Danny specifically mentioned you in there.&quot;<br />
<br />
Noah skeptically asks, &quot;..Me&quot;<br />
<br />
Ben grins, &quot;Word on the street is that you&#39;re packing some serious heat, bro.&quot;<br />
<br />
Noah chuckles, &quot;Come on man, that&#39;s ….just a rumor..&quot;<br />
<br />
Ben insists, &quot;Nah bro, it&#39;s more than a rumor. Danny said ALL the guys on the team are talking about your monster cock.&quot;<br />
<br />
Noah laughs, &quot;Monster cock? That&#39;s …ridiculous.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ben keeps pushing, &quot;No, seriously man. They&#39;re talking about how big you are and how they&#39;re all envious.&quot;<br />
<br />
Noah shrugs, &quot;Well, I mean, if they&#39;re saying it then it must be true, right?&quot; and he laughs.<br />
Ben says, &quot;hell yeah, you know it!&quot;      Noah mumbled, &quot;..What? No way, that&#39;s not true.&quot;<br />
<br />
But Ben wasn&#39;t about to give up that easily. &quot;Come on Noah, everyone&#39;s talking about it. You know it’s true, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
Noah grumbled.   Then silent.  Then groaned, turning into a slow, low chuckle.<br />
&quot;....haha, yeah... Yeah man...   it.. it is true dude.. haha...&quot;<br />
<br />
Relieved, Ben exclaims, &quot;I knew it!&quot;<br />
&quot;So uh... how big we talking, The locker room legend?&quot; Ben puts it back on Noah.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm... I mean, yeah it&#39;s.. big, dude,&quot; Noah calmly replies.<br />
<br />
Ben needs him to say it, &quot;Come on, I&#39;m dying to know! What kind of numbers are we talking here?&quot;<br />
<br />
“Hmmmm hmm-hmm..” Noah’s humming..<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello?&quot; Ben asks,<br />
<br />
Noah hums softly, a tune that Ben can&#39;t quite make out.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s up man? What are you humming?&quot; Ben asks, trying to figure it out.<br />
<br />
Noah just hums again, ignoring the question. Hmmm mm-mm.<br />
<br />
&quot;Noah?&quot; Ben asks again, a little more insistent.<br />
<br />
Noah continues to hum, a big grin spreading across his face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on dude, you&#39;re killing me here,&quot; Ben says, sounding frustrated.<br />
<br />
Finally, Noah stops humming and says with a pleased grin, &quot;Five dollar footloooong.&quot;<br />
<br />
Noah grins a shit-eating grin, &quot;I have a footlong, okay? It&#39;s big, man.&quot;<br />
<br />
“Holy shit, dude, a footlo - “ Ben stopped.<br />
<br />
As soon as the words left Noah&#39;s mouth, Ben’s eyes were drawn to Noah’s boxers.<br />
<br />
The previously modest bulge was growing in his boxers. Noah&#39;s penis was expanding, growing larger with each passing second. Ben was in awe as he watched the growth.<br />
<br />
<br />
5 inches.. as Noah&#39;s cock grew, reaching 6 inches in length, the head started to travel closer to Noah&#39;s side, the shaft extending further out from his crotch with each passing moment. It was like watching a magician perform a trick, a never-ending expansion of manhood. The thick sausage reached for the edge, pulling the waistband of Noah&#39;s boxers down his adonis line. The cloth was beginning to struggle to contain the thickness of the shaft as it grew...<br />
<br />
..7... 8 inches in, Ben couldn&#39;t believe his eyes. The size was overwhelming, filling his vision completely. Noah&#39;s cock was now pushing the waistband of his boxers so far down and away from his body that his pubic hair was visible, the thickness of the shaft was truly impressive. It was like a thick sausage, a fucking bratwurst, being forced out of its casing. The shaft was so big that it was starting to bend over Noah&#39;s hip, curving as it was unable to continue straight to the side having begun to run out of room.<br />
<br />
..9... 10 inches, Ben was in awe. He&#39;d never seen anything like this before. The size was obscene, the thickness, the girth, the length, all of it was massive. The waistband of Noah&#39;s boxers was now stretched so far from his body that it looked like it was about to snap, the gap between waistband and his groin was growing larger by the second. The shaft was now bending at an angle, and Ben couldn&#39;t help but imagine what it would feel like to wrap his hand around it, however much he could fit in his hand.<br />
<br />
11.... the growth was slowing but still inching closer to the side of Noah&#39;s leg as it wrapped around....<br />
 12 inches, and SNAP something released inside the beast as it instantaneously the roll of flesh widened a full extra inch in each girthy direction.<br />
The growth, it had finally stopped. <br />
<br />
Noah&#39;s cock was now a monster, a behemoth of manhood. The baseball bat and Pringles comparison didn&#39;t even come close to describing its girth, it was now like a foam roller, fat, thick and imposing. The waistband of Noah&#39;s boxers was now so stretched out that it was hovering above his hips, the gap between waistband and pubes was a chasm, exposing a large amount of pink cockflesh. The shaft itself was wrapped around to the side, pointing down to the couch.<br />
<br />
Ben was speechless, unable to take his eyes off the impressive sight in front of him. He felt a rush of excitement and fear, his mind struggling to process the sheer size of Noah&#39;s cock.<br />
The realization that the growth was caused by nothing more than suggestion is both amazing and unbelievable to him. <br />
<br />
The sight of the 12-inch long and 6 inches WIDE manhood is still hard to process and Ben is left in awe by the sheer size of it all.<br />
<br />
But then, he realized something. Something was wrong.<br />
<br />
He looked at the bulge, up to Noah’s face, then back again.<br />
<br />
He leaned over and whispered, &quot;Wait, Noah, do you have a boner?&quot;<br />
<br />
Noah mumbled, &quot;No, why?&quot;</p>
