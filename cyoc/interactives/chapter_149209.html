<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Brad wiped his brow as he put another box down. He&#39;d kept it hidden from everyone, but now the moment was finally here.  He&#39;d fooled everyone, the coaches, his fellow students, and especially Jen. Brad hated Glendale, the tiny unnoticed high school in the middle of nowhere, and he longed to head to one of the big city schools. Contrary to his reputation as a brainless jock, he&#39;d accumulated the credits to graduate early and move to the city. Finally, I&#39;m somewhere scouts will notice me, and I&#39;ll get picked up early by a top-flight college team, Brad thought. His father had approved of their son&#39;s ambition, and had financially supported the move on the condition that he &quot;not use the time to chase city girls&quot;. <i>And now, I don&#39;t need to.</i> Brad smiled to himself as he looked at his memento from his time at Glendale..<br />
<br />
He had originally planned on ghosting Jen long before the time came, as she didn&#39;t really put out that much and he didn&#39;t like her general snootiness. But then she had told him about her &quot;procedure&quot;, and Brad knew it was too good of an opportunity to pass up. Now he didn&#39;t need to waste time on chasing girls here, because now Jen would put out whenever he got horny. It was perfect, Brad thought as he reflected on all the time he had to wait on Jen hand & foot to get her to give it up; He got to keep her sex, and dump the rest of her. Taking a break for now, he decided to call her, for old times&#39; sake. Putting her on speakerphone, he placed the phone on the ground between his calves where he was sitting on the ground. Jen couldn&#39;t see it, but Brad had changed her entry in his phonebook to &quot;Bitch&quot;, and that showed underneath her profile picture as she answered.<br />
<br />
<i>&quot;Hello, Brad?&quot;</i><br />
<br />
&quot;Hi Jen.&quot; <br />
<br />
<i>&quot;Brad where are you?! And where&#39;s my...&quot;</i><br />
<br />
&quot;Your cunt? Oh it&#39;s here with me. I liked it so much I decided to take it with me.&quot;<br />
<br />
<i>&quot;YOU WHAT!? BRAD BRING BACK MY VAGINA, NOW!&quot;</i> Brad&#39;s phone was having trouble catching the full audio range as the speakers maxed out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thought about it, but nah.&quot; Brad picked her up and spread her lips open with his hands.<br />
<br />
<i>&quot;What do you mean &#39;no&#39;!? Stop that!&quot;</i> Jen cried out as Brad lackadaisically looked straight into Jennifer&#39;s tube, moving her lips back and forth a bit.<br />
<br />
&quot;I mean, I&#39;m not returning your cunt. I&#39;m already hundreds of miles away, and I&#39;m getting a little horny at this whole situation...&quot; Brad lowered Jen&#39;s puss down to his head, teasing her spread-apart entrance with his tip as he moved it in tiny circles.<br />
<br />
<i>&quot;Stop calling it that! That&#39;s my private place!&quot;</i><br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, it&#39;s private because I own it now.&quot; Her pussy began to lubricate autonomic-ally despite her fearful tone. He began to press his head into the tight hole, back and forth slowly.<br />
<br />
<i>&quot;Brad, no! Please! I don&#39;t want to!&quot;</i> His head began to get wet from the lube that Jen&#39;s pussy provided. He began to go deeper with each press, as he penetrated up to his foreskin.<br />
<br />
<i>&quot;Brad, you can&#39;t do this!&quot;</i> He was halfway in now, still moving his penis in and out steadily.<br />
<br />
&quot;Or what? You&#39;ll tell people? And they&#39;re supposed to believe you when you tell them your pussy got stolen? How about when you explain how I got my hands on it in the first place? Even if they did believe you, no one knows where I moved to.&quot;<br />
<br />
<i>&quot;Brad, I&#39;m asking you not to-&quot;</i> Brad penetrated Jen fully in one large thrust as she gave a cross between a yell and a moan.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m just going to fuck you while you talk&quot; Brad was turned on by the combination of Jennifer&#39;s seductive profile picture and renaming on his phone, along with her pleading voice and the tight folds gripping him.<br />
<br />
<i>&quot;Brad...I trusted you, I gave you a part of myself...don&#39;t you remember what we had?&quot;</i> Brad could hear her sobs on the other end of the line. At the same time, he knew they could both hear the <i>schlick schlick schlick-</i> of her pussy bobbing up and down on his rod.<br />
<br />
&quot;I remember having to serve you continuously, managing your moods, obeying your rules while you bitched at me and everyone else in the school. So when you gave me your gift, I already knew I had to keep it. So I played along and humored you. That last night, I was drinking a little I admit. I decided to let everyone else have a chance at your cunt, since they were never going to see it again. Sorry I couldn&#39;t give you the same chance!&quot; Brad laughed at the last part as he continued sliding in and out of Jen with his hand.<br />
<br />
<i>&quot;I can&#39;t believe you Brad, you&#39;re terrible! What am I supposed to do now...?&quot;</i><br />
<br />
&quot;Beats me, all I know is there&#39;s new rules for your snatch; When I get horny, it gets fucked, anytime I want. Simple right? Anyway, this is goodbye actually. Make sure to take your birth control pills, don&#39;t want my sex toy getting pregos.&quot;<br />
<br />
<i>&quot;Goodbye...? What do you mean?&quot;</i><br />
<br />
&quot;I mean this is the last time we&#39;ll talk. I&#39;m making a fresh start in a new city, and I&#39;m cutting all ties. So this is goodbye. I just wanted to thank you for your gift, I&#39;ll treasure it forever. I&#39;m afraid we&#39;ll probably never meet again, but I&#39;ll cum by often.&quot;<br />
<br />
<i>&quot;Brad WAIT! GIMME BACK MY PUSS-&quot;</i><br />
<br />
The line clicked as Brad hung up. Quickly blocking Jen&#39;s number, he enjoyed the peace and quiet, punctuated only by the <i>schlick schlick schlick-</i> of Jen&#39;s pussy.<br />
<br />
<br />
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Two days later, Jen sat in her bedroom with her head in her hands as she stared at her homework. Normally she would breeze through this, but how could she focus now? Trapped in her circumstances, all she could do was continue staring down onto the page as she felt her captive petals part for Brad&#39;s cock again. She had thought she could trust him, but now she realized the true extent of the curse Kyle had wrought. It had altered her mind to be far too trusting with herself, and now her vagina was Brad&#39;s souvenir. Permanently.<br />
<br />
Putting her head down on the desk, she used her arms to cover her grunts as her pussy once again began to service it&#39;s owner.</p>
