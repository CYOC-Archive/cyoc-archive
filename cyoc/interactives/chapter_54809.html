<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">AN: I formally apologize for all these short posts lately. I'll try to make it up when I am <br />
able.<br />
<br />
++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;So, can some of us get out of here? I'm feeling much better.&quot; Called out Ashley, if Anne <br />
really was pregnant then she didn't want her working.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not a chance.&quot; Fran said instantly, Joy and Ingrid's awake heads nodded at once, &quot;You lot <br />
are not going anywhere for a long while until bones heal and tendons heal. So Tad, if any <br />
of these lot try to be a hero and escape, I know there are some things I can barrow out of <br />
the closet in Zack's closet to tie them down.&quot;<br />
<br />
Zack, June, Hope, and Grace all blushed.<br />
<br />
Isabelle had to ask, &quot;What's in Gamma-Zack's closet?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I always knew they were kinky...&quot; Nicole commented simply.<br />
<br />
Michelle meanwhile was going to make sure herself anyone trying to let themselves out of <br />
the medical wing early had a strange string of bad luck when trying to get out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, I promise.&quot; Tad said, &quot;You're the doctor...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Actually,&quot; Fran started but stopped herself, &quot;Alright, good boy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This sure isn't like the movies where everyone heals up in two to three days after having <br />
all their bones broken...&quot; Millie said not looking up from her book. Her half-sisters had let <br />
her be for the time being after being too tired to hang out with her. <br />
<br />
&quot;Welcome to reality kiddo.&quot; Zack said to the young orange/white wolf lass. <br />
<br />
Wolf Megan and Lioness Megan were playing cards resigned that magic wasn't about to <br />
make them all healthy again with the wiggle of a nose. <br />
<br />
++++++++<br />
<br />
1681 December 18th<br />
<br />
The little white boy cub didn't like this game anymore. The nice ladies had given him what <br />
they called a 'magic wishing rock' and said all he had to do was say 'I wish my parents <br />
were like me' and they be with him forever and ever and always be his friends and not <br />
shout at him for misbehaving and he wouldn't have to see disease take any more siblings. <br />
<br />
At first it had been fun, his new brother and sister never got tired of playing with him, the <br />
first few days had been fun, very fun. But then food began to run low, and the young cub <br />
realized his brother and sister were no better at hunting than he was... <br />
<br />
He had finally tried to use the wishing rock to make everything alright again, but nothing <br />
had happened and nothing had worked.  Finally the three had wandered out looking for <br />
food, had gotten lost, and now were crying. The little male white leoman cub cried most of <br />
all, for he now realized the heavy weight his parents had always carried for his sake, and <br />
now they were gone, he had wished them away, and his new brother and sister had only <br />
him to be looked after, and he couldn't help them. <br />
<br />
That was when the oddly dressed humans found them. <br />
<br />
++++++++<br />
<br />
1681 December 19th <br />
<br />
&quot;Where is Marie?&quot; Father Gabriel asked. <br />
<br />
The felman Inquisitor, and the Plague Doctor/Priest's contact between himself and the <br />
council when he was not able to meet with them himself said simply, &quot;She's being taught a <br />
lesson in being an impulsive child who kills heathens who were supposed to be taken alive <br />
for interrogation.  Don't worry Father, this is barely even undercover.  A small circle of <br />
child molesters need to be caught and arrested. But only the fear of catching the plague <br />
will have them let anyone in. The wretches shouldn't give you any trouble.&quot;<br />
<br />
Father Gabriel sighed later as he put on his raven's mask and slipped on his black hat and <br />
dark coat taking his cane. <br />
<br />
The holy man considered many things to write as he felt his defective heart flutter. 'There's <br />
nothing left that I haven't already tried to teach her.'<br />
<br />
Finally he wrote down, <br />
<br />
'Marie, God's universe is one based on truth, remember that if nothing else.' <br />
<br />
He remembered telling her that every time he went on a mission when she was small. But <br />
she wasn't so small now. <br />
<br />
&quot;Has it really been only eleven years?&quot; He said to himself. &quot;I'm sorry I won't be there in the <br />
flesh when you turn eighteen Marie... I'd share one last christmas with you if I could. ... But <br />
not everything in life is fair. Vatican, take care of her.&quot;  <br />
<br />
The Plague Doctor who had haunted the streets of Europe for decades now walked out of <br />
his church for the final time, knowing he would only walk into it one more time. <br />
<br />
++++++++<br />
<br />
Gillie woke up, hoping it had all been a dream, only to find she was still a naked lion <br />
woman, and now was in a bed more in scale to her new size and in a bedroom also scaled <br />
to her size. <br />
<br />
She had dreamed of being a mundane lion cub being cased by little boys in party masks <br />
wielding wiffle bats. <br />
<br />
&quot;I don't see why some Lupman chose to leave the estate on account of it  being too <br />
crowded,&quot; The giant white lioness commented, &quot;There's room for twice the current number <br />
here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't look at me Marilyn.&quot; Said the copper lion man with a brass mane, &quot;I just stopped <br />
being a tea pot for over sixty years...&quot;<br />
<br />
 &quot;I know dear, and I am happy to have you back, and please, it's Mother Glen now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's going to take time to get used to that you know...&quot;<br />
<br />
She licked him, &quot;I can wait dear...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uuuuuugh,&quot; Gillie groaned. <br />
<br />
&quot;Gillie dear! You're awake!&quot; Gillian II hugged her. &quot;I'm sorry that you got so overwhelmed.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gillie however was looking at the giant white female lion in the bedroom. &quot;Are you...&quot; She <br />
knew she was going to sound insane but she had to ask now, &quot;Are you my grandmother?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry for not telling you before dear...&quot;<br />
<br />
Gillie was shocked silent. She hadn't KNOWN her grandmother in this timeline? And she <br />
had been alive and well-?! The Hell?! <br />
<br />
She forgot all about asking sublime questions to figure out if the game had stolen three-<br />
forth of her cultural heritage from her or not and instead asked, &quot;WHY? Why didn't you tell <br />
me?! You think I liked never knowing one of my grandmothers?&quot;<br />
<br />

<br />
Judas knew he was no preacher, he also knew most of what he said went over the vast <br />
majority of other cat's heads. And he knew his elder brother and younger brother both <br />
thought he was a heretic and a traitor for teaching about 'the human's god who lives in a <br />
book' over Bast who the humans called Bastet. <br />
<br />
But still, cats were nothing if not curious, and a tiny handful still came, and he told them <br />
what he would. And some would listen, some would not.<br />
<br />
Of course, the fact Judas wasn't neutered like the vast majority of males in Glendale likely <br />
had something else to do with the majority of his attendees being female....</p>
