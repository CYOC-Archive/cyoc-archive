<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Since her father didn't want to spend any time playing with her as an adult, she figured that maybe he could play with her if he was closer to her age.  She clicked on his character and chose the age option.  After debating over the perfect age, she decided that it would be best if he was the same age she was.  She didn't want him to be older than she was, trying to boss her around.  She wasn't sure what some of the other options meant, like aware, so she just left them at their default settings.  Finally, she clicked 'apply'.  She watched as his character on the screen started to get smaller.  The default setting for time was 1 minute, so it didn't take long for her 39 year old father to reach 6 again.  Hailey giggled with joy as she thought that this was a really fun game.  <br />
<br />
Meanwhile, in the kitchen, Dan had just walked in on Jake and Harry raiding his fridge.  &quot;What do you two think you're doing?  You know that your mother is going to be calling you for dinner any minute!  And what makes you think you have the right to just go through my refrigerator and take whatever you want?!&quot;, Dan scolded.  &quot;We don't need to listen to you, Dan&quot;, Jake scoffed.  &quot;Mrs. Thompson said we could get whatever we wanted, and she's the one in charge!&quot;  <br />
<br />
This really pissed Dan off.  What gave them the right to call him 'Dan', anyway!  Just as he was about to tell them to get out of his house his throat felt funny.  &quot;You two had better...&quot;, he trailed off.  Had his voice just cracked?  It sounded higher, too!  He was trying to figure out what just happened when he looked at the boys.  Their eyes were wide, as if they had just seen a ghost.  Funny, he didn't have to look as far down to see them now.  Just as he was thinking this, his cargo shorts dropped to the ground and he looked down to see what happened.  <br />
<br />
Catching a glimpse of his scrawny, hairless legs put the same look of shock on his face!  He had played football, hockey and lacrosse - his legs were always nice and toned and covered in a nice layer of black hair.  He started to feel his once form-fitting boxerbriefs slip and he reached for them quickly, sparing himself some embarassment.  He looked over at the boys and noticed that he was now just a hair shorter than Jake.  This can't be happening, he thought!  He felt aroud with his hands and discovered that his once proud package was now diminished in size, as well!  &quot;What the...&quot;, he exclaimed, now in a high-pitch voice.  He looked at his arms, also scrawny and hairless and was completely stunned.  &quot;Tiffany!!&quot;, he shouted at the top of his lungs.  Before she even entered the room she started with, &quot;What is it, Harry?  And why did you call me Tif...&quot;  The vision before her stopped her in her tracks.  <br />
<br />
&quot;What is this?  Is this some kind of joke?  Who are you?!&quot;, she demanded.  &quot;It's me, Dan&quot;, he squeaked.  The boys just stared at the now 6-year-old Dan.  &quot;No, it can't be!&quot;, Tiffany exclaimed.  The boys, still getting over the shock, confirmed that it was Dan and that he had just...gotten younger!  Dan's polo shirt fell down over one shoulder, giving them all a glimpse of the little boy underneath.  Tiffany just stood there, trying to get her thoughts together.  Her husband just barely came up over her waist now.  What was she going to do??  <br />
<br />
&quot;Dan, go upstairs to our bedroom while I try to figure out what to do&quot;, she ordered.  &quot;But Tiffany,&quot; Dan started to protest, but she shouted &quot;Now!&quot; at him, and he obediently padded out of the room, his socks falling off as he walked.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Jake, go over and ask your mother if she has any of Harry's old clothes, something too small for him to wear anymore&quot;, she asked.  It only took a few minutes and the boys were back with some briefs and an outfit.  She hadn't asked why they needed the clothes, and they didn't offer up any explanation, as they weren't sure, themselves.  Tiffany took the clothes and headed upstairs with them.  When she opened the bedroom door, she found Dan with tears in his eyes, sitting back on the bed looking under the massive covers of his boxerbriefs at his little boy cock.  He had always been a real ladies man, and took great pride in the size and abilities of his cock, and now it was not much more than a stub!  This was the biggest let-down of all!<br />
<br />
Tiffany walked over to him and presented him with the clothes from Jake &amp; Harry's mother.  He looked at them in disbelief and informed her that he wasn't going to wear little kid clothes.  &quot;But you are a little kid now, babe!&quot;, she retorted.  &quot;Well, I may look like a little kid, but I'm really a man and you know it!&quot;, he replied.  It sounded funny coming from this little body, but she knew it must have been really hard on him.  Hell, it was hard enough on her trying to get this far!  Finally, she convinced him to stand up on the bed.  He dropped his boxerbriefs and stepped out of them, when all of a sudden he heard laughted.  They both looked up to see Jake and Harry standing in the doorway pointing and laughing at &quot;little Dan&quot;.  Jake even went so far as to exclaim that he was more of a man now, for sure!  That really got to Dan, and he threw the TV remote at them as Tiffany ran over to slam the door on them, telling them to go home.<br />
<br />
Dan stepped into the Spiderman briefs and Tiffany helped him get on the shorts and t-shirt that were now the only clothes that fit him.  Not understanding what had caused this, or if there was a reversal, Tiffany thought in the back of her mind that she would have to take him clothes shopping to get some things that really fit him.  She was also a little happy, herself, as Dan had always wanted a little boy, but all they had were girls.  Now, there was a little boy in the house, but it was Dan.  Until they could figure out a better plan, they would tell people that Dan was really &quot;Danny&quot;, a nephew from out of town.<br />
<br />
Hailey, still unaware of the changes, headed up the stairs to see what was for dinner.  When she walked into her parents bedroom, she was as shocked as anyone else that her father was now 6-years-old, even though she had been the one to cause the change.  She figured it out right away, and planned on keeping it a secret, so that she could enjoy her new playmate.<br />
<br />
They managed to get through dinner all right, but Abby was full of questions, just as any 4-year-old would be.  Since they didn't know any answers, she became frustrated with them and got sent to her room early.  Hailey went to bed next, and finally Dan and Tiffany headed up to their room for the night.  Normally, Tiffany would have downed a bottle of wine by now, but under these circumstances, she thought she needed to keep her wits about her!  Dan didn't have any bed clothes, so he went to sleep in the nude, next to his wife, just as he had done almost every night before.  Nightmares plagued him during the night...memories of his childhood, playing sports, watching cartoons, riding his dirt-bike...  He wasn't supposed to be doing these things anymore!  He tossed and turned, wondering what tomorrow would bring.  Perhaps a cure?</p>
