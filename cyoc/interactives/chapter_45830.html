<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Chateau bull 2009? Sounds delectable. Might not sustain us for--&quot; John began, but then Brian kissed him and he forgot about the banter. It was a little awkward at first -- Brian's bull-like muzzle and tongue were so much bigger than his own mouth, and the tusks that jutted from John's lower jaw had a habit of getting in the way. The minotaur's lips were large and very flexible, though, and they were soon nuzzling and nipping at one another. He ran his hands up and down Brian's back, squeezing, scratching gently with his claws. Brian's hoof-like hands roamed over the sides of his head, playing with his ears. As they grew more passionate, the minotaur spread his jaw wider and simply clamped it over the lower part of the John's face, forcing his tongue into the orc's mouth. They wrestled; Brian was the clear victor.<br />
<br />
As they parted for breath, Brian giving John's face a final large lick.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck me, that thing is big,&quot; John panted. &quot;It doesn't look it when it's, y'know, in your mouth.&quot;<br />
<br />
Brian grinned at him. &quot;Babe, consider it a warm-up. That was not the biggest thing coming your way tonight.&quot;<br />
<br />
He groaned. &quot;Is it too late to pretend to have a headache?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Aw, c'mon, you'll enjoy the challenge. Plus, didn't you tell me that there's no such thing as too big?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I said there _is_ such a thing as too big. But you took mine anyway when it was too big for you, so I guess turnaround is fair play. All right, let's have a look at this monster of yours.&quot;<br />
<br />
Brian rolled off him, allowing both of their cocks to spring free, then clicked on the bedside lamp. John stared. This was the first time he'd got a good look at Brian's new cock when it was hard, he realized. It was big, but not quite as intimidating as he'd expected -- only a couple of inches longer than his own equipment, and maybe a bit thicker. I'm bigger than I'm used to too, he thought. Very gently, he ran his fingers along it, from the base near Brian's furry balls up to the tip. The shape was odd -- it had something like a flat top, not the usual mushroom head. Then again his own penis was dark green; he couldn't really object to an unusual shape.<br />
<br />
He leaned in, licked his lips, and kissed the tip. This provoked a pleased-sounding gasp from Brian, so he started running his tongue over it and sucking at the edge. He felt thick lips play with his ear, nibbling at the point. He opened his jaw wide, baring his tusks, and slid it down over the top of the bullcock. It fits! he thought. Not by much, but it fits! He closed his lips over it as best he could and moved down, drool and precum running down his tongue. Before long it bumped into the roof of his mouth. He held there for a moment and then slowly pulled off, finishing with a satisfied lick across the tip. He was about to go down again when he felt a hefty hand on his shoulder.<br />
<br />
&quot;Woah, slow down there, babe. You do that again and I'm going to burst.&quot;<br />
<br />
He raised an eyebrow. &quot;And that's not a good thing?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, sure, but you need some attention too,&quot; replied Brian, moving his hand down to John's cock.<br />
<br />
&quot;OK, I'm sold,&quot; he said quickly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Glad we're in agreement,&quot; said Brian, and kissed him on the cheek. &quot;Now scoot back so I don't brain you again.&quot;<br />
<br />
He did as he was told, not quite understanding but willing to play along. Brian shuffled back and forth a bit, tilted John's cock forwards and backwards a couple of times, then got up onto his knees and frowned.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is going to be trickier than I thought. We're both too damned big.&quot;<br />
<br />
John propped himself up on one elbow, his erection bobbing between them. &quot;You're cute when you're perplexed, you know that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;OK, I think I got it. You lie on your side and then bend forward at the waist, all right? No, further. OK.&quot;<br />
<br />
Brian lay down opposite him and did the same thing, then started edging closer. After a moment, John got it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sixty-nine, huh?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;More like ninety-nine, or maybe P nine, but yeah. See, we're too big to do it the regular way and up close the angle is -- guh, uh -- is wrong -- oh! -- too steep--&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uck upf ang fuck!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Whuh? Oh yeah.&quot;<br />
<br />
As he moved his tongue over Brian's bull-cock, John felt warm, thick lips slide over his own erection. The feeling was amazing. They went down, and down, and down. Out of the corner of his eye he could see Brian's enormous bull head, still edging forwards. Hooray for a boyfriend with a long snout, he thought faintly. And a flexible neck. And tongue.<br />
<br />
He tried to focus on his own technique, but it was impossible with this level of distraction. His penis was very long, and very sensitive, and nearly all of it was being stimulated at once -- not to mention that he had a whole day's worth of seed backed up in his balls, which for an orc was apparently an ungodly amount. Raw passion took over and he started moving faster, pushing against Brian's thick cock as it went towards his throat then pulling up vigorously, lapping with his tongue to lubricate it. He swallowed a mouthful of saliva and precum then plunged down again, wrapping a hand around the base of Brian's cock to get a firmer grip. This was going to be over too soon, he knew, but what the hell. They had time to work on it.<br />
<br />
He felt Brian's hoof-hand grip his thigh tightly, and then the cock in his mouth started moving forwards, surprising him. Hey, stop that, he thought helplessly. I can barely take it as it is. But Brian's hips kept thrusting anyway -- slowly, thank goodness -- and he could do nothing except try to hang on as the cock thumped into the roof of his mouth. He whimpered, but Brian seemed to take that as encouragement and sped up. His own hips were bucking in time, he realized abruptly. His hand slipped from Brian's cock to one of his horns and he used it to thrust harder, actually getting his cock in all the way to the hilt, the minotaur's tongue flexing and curling as it went. Brian moaned, and John found he was moaning too. He thrust again and again, Brian's cock moving in and out of his own mouth in time, building up the rhythm, their two bodies undulating in unison -- and then he felt the hand on his thigh clamp down hard. Brian went rigid and cum began pumping into his throat. John took one more stroke and then he too hit his orgasm.<br />
<br />
He tried to swallow but had to pull off; his mouth was blocked and the stuff was going to start coming out of his nose if he didn't. He played his tongue over the bull-cock as it continued to spurt a few more times, then nuzzled it as it finished and began to soften. Brian's snout was still firmly clamped over his own dick, taking everything he could give. He put both hands on the horns and pulled again, his toes curling, blasting out as hard as he could again and again and again and again. Finally he was spent and let go, rubbing the back of Brian's head as he pulled out.</p>
