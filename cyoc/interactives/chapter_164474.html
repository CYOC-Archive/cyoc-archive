<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Andy had always had a bit of an interest in the medieval, from attending the odd Renn Faire, to even collecting a few sufficiently budget items from those faires. He enjoyed participating in the more physical end of the Renn Faire experience, usually having a blast on the floor with other guys dressed up as knights, and that plus the moderate to high levels of exercise he enjoyed kept his body toned and muscular, but not overly bulky. He was muscular, but not so brawny that it was immediately obvious.<br />
<br />
Part of the issue though was that Lucy was more keen on spending her time at &quot;less old fashioned&quot; places, and always had one thing on her mind even when Andy managed to get some time to himself. Complain complain complain. Even when he was by himself, she&#39;d send him text after text asking when he was coming home so she could have someone to go to dinner with at her favorite chic places.<br />
<br />
After filling in his name and information into the card, he decided to send it back and see what happened.<br />
<br />
He figured that he could probably enjoy his time on such a tour, so long as he remembered to turn his phone off and or just not be taking calls or texts for the duration of his time there. And even if the whole thing was some kind of predominately gay affair, he didn&#39;t really have problems with LGBT people. So he figured as long as everyone behaved themselves and didn&#39;t act like Ian from High School constantly trying to look at Andy&#39;s ass, everything would be fine.<br />
<br />
As he completed sending in the card, he wondered what sort of experience this would be. Probably a lot better than living currently with his increasingly shrewish girlfriend. Well, maybe there&#39;d even be some babes there on the staff that weren&#39;t gonna be controlling of him and let him have some fun.<br />
<br />
Maybe he could even find someone hot who wasn&#39;t a hot mess like Lucy.<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
Not even a day later, Andy got a message on his phone saying that his application to join the resort had been accepted. And what was more, they said that it would be a &quot;transformative experience&quot;. He was always up for something interesting, and this outing definitely had character.  Apparently he was going to &quot;experience the knight life&quot; (funny, never heard that one), and &quot;experience the thrills of the fantastical and the ancient world.&quot;<br />
<br />
Meaning most likely this would be a vacation resort with some weird Lord of the Rings pretensions most likely, he told himself.<br />
<br />
And apparently he would need to head to the docks and catch a boat heading out to the resort, alongside a variety of other associated guests. Andy was already eagerly anticipating this, and he guessed he would need to make sure he was in top form going forward. He wrote the date down in his calendar and went out to go workout again at the gym.<br />
<br />
....<br />
<br />
The day came, and Andy drove out there himself, considering he was a thirty year old guy in decent to good shape, going to his first real resort experience. The ship - noted to be the SS Fantasia - was distinctly classy, incredibly large, and it looked like there were a large number of other people heading in toward it. Quite a long line! The people were a wide variety, but indeed it seemed there were a lot of well built, handsome guys in the crowd.<br />
<br />
From what he heard from the information sent to his email, Andy could see he was gonna be on this ship about three days as they went out to the resort location, somewhere most likely in the tropics or something. Pretty exciting idea, and it would be easily far away from Lucy and her demands that he tell her where he was and what he was doing.<br />
<br />
As Andy took his place in the line after parking his car nearby, he found himself wondering what sort of amenities would be given on the cruise portion heading to the resort. It looked fancy, and probably financed by some bored billionaire who needed somewhere to put a few years worth of money. He crossed his arms as he started the lengthy wait to get in...<br />
<br />
&quot;So,&quot; one guy in front of him said as the wait went on, &quot;Seems like everyone got a different &quot;experience&quot; or &quot;class&quot;...what&#39;d you get?&quot;<br />
<br />
Andy responded, looking at the guy, &quot;Oh, I apparently got the Knight Life experience.&quot; This guy in front of him was astonishingly well built, probably bodybuilder level, and looked like he probably shaved everything but the hair on his head going by the slightly long blond hair on the top and the smooth look otherwise. He barely even seemed to fit his shirt and shorts.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, well, I got the Young Prince experience. Weird...&quot; The guy said, and then nodded, &quot;Well, anyway, figure I should introduce myself. I&#39;m Holland Royce.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Andrew Branton, just call me Andy. Everyone does.&quot;<br />
<br />
After a minute, Andy looked up at the SS Fantasia, which seemed to be slowly getting closer as the line was getting shorter, both men moving forward, &quot;You figure that there&#39;ll be any hot women onboard? I mean, admittedly, hot women and great food are my goal when I&#39;m heading on a cruise and resort vacation.&quot;<br />
<br />
Holland grinned a little bit himself, and said, &quot;Yeah man, hopefully. I&#39;ve had my share of a lot of hot women and hot guys too, but I&#39;m still looking forward to my vacay experience.&quot;<br />
<br />
Andy didn&#39;t comment on the open and comfortable way Holland showed he was bisexual, and given how friendly Holland was being, he figured this would be a good first friend to have on the trip. Plus, admittedly, Andy could want to get into as good a shape as Holland was in. &quot;You know, if you have time between all the guys and gals on there, could you uh, help me get in shape like you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure thing. Always up to help someone get where they need to be fitness wise.&quot;<br />
<br />
Before long though, they were able to get onboard the cruise ship, and both marveled at the sights and sounds. It was fantastical and intricate, multiple places for the guests to have fun and make merry, places to eat and a whole deck devoted to a pool and set of tanning beds. People were running about and enjoying themselves already.<br />
<br />
Andy and Holland looked at one another and decided to...</p>
