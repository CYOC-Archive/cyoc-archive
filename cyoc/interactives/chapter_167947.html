<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dr. Megan carried you out on her arm to the lobby. You were expecting your parents and also your brother, but only he was there. Your parents were no where to be seen.  You would be lying if you said you were not a little bit disappointed. But at least he was here. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey sis&quot; he said, with a sympathetic smile on his face. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey&quot; you respond &quot;where&#39;s Mom and Dad?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Left. They couldn&#39;t stand the fact that you became a harpy for the hospital, and were throwing a big fit about extortion, abusing the system, etc... So they were kicked out.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Wtf! Why are they idiots sometimes. I intentionally didn&#39;t select anything, and they blame the hospital for making me a harpy? Seriously, they can be assholes sometimes.&quot; You said. While it wasn&#39;t ideal, at least they didn&#39;t just abandon you like you thought. Though seeing them again may be difficult to happen at the moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;Anyways, what about you?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Harpy through and through I guess. From wings to eggs. Honestly it isn&#39;t as bad as I imagined it would be. And with a bit of practice, I could even learn to fly!&quot; You reported excitedly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah? Cool. Um, so I heard that you have been adopted by the hospital to be their residential pet? Is that true? Also, uh... do you have a new name or something?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Melody! And yep, I am now this hospital&#39;s pet! I have full access to the entire campus, and can go out if as long as I have someone escort me. See this ring, it is a sign that I am a member of the hospital.&quot; You were eager to explain your new life to your brother. He was the only other person you knew that was here at the moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, let me get a good look at ya.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Ok&quot; you said. Dr. Megan set you down on the back of your Brother&#39;s chair having you wrap your feet around its back rest. Surprisingly, it was fairly comfortable. Now about eye level with your brother since you still were crouched, you unfurled your wings, exposing your chest.<br />
<br />
&quot;Damn sis, those are even bigger than mine ever were before I stopped developing.&quot; He said lifting up one of your boobs to feel their weight. You didn&#39;t mind too much, but being groped like that without even being asked made you really understand that to everyone else, you were basically just an animal now. Sure you were considered human, but since you officially took the pet role, some of your human rights were revoked. Apparently the requirement of getting permission to touch you was one of them, as Dr. Megan stood behind you, also grabbing one of your free tits. <br />
<br />
&quot;Anyways, I got to get going. Since Mom and Dad were forced out, I need to take the bus home. See you around sis.&quot; With that, your brother turned to leave. <br />
<br />
You were sad to see him go. And found yourself hopping off of the chair flapping your wings. For a first real attempt, it was actually a good try at flying. You managed to propeller yourself enough to land on his backpack. Once you secured yourself, you leaned down and gently rubbed your head against his neck. You couldn&#39;t hug him with wings, so this felt like the next best thing to you. You finished your rubbing by kissing his neck and cheek a few times. Satisfied that you had properly said goodbye, you took off and glided back over to Dr. Megan, who caught you landing on her arm. Flying was quickly becomming rather easy for you, maybe you were a natural at it?<br />
<br />
&quot;Geez Sis, I thought you would start to eat me&quot; your Brother joked, rubbing his wet neck. <br />
<br />
You do admit that you did spit a bit on him a little. Not that you meant bad, but you wanred to be sure he could smell you aince you wouldn&#39;t be around as much. &quot;Huh, why did I think that&quot;, you wondered. Maybe becomming a harpy changed parts your mind slightly in order to cope? Your brother obviously didn&#39;t have that good of a nose to determine your sent like that. But you felt you had to do it. Odd.<br />
<br />
Dr. Megan leaned over and whispered into your ear &quot;Now now, don&#39;t go starting trouble for him with the ladies. If you mark him like that, girls with a good sense of smell will obviously begin to avoid him.&quot;<br />
<br />
This made you blush. You do not have a thing for your brother, and had no intention of doing something like that. But realized what you did easily could be interpreted like that.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on, lets go see your new room. As it happens, we are roommate from now on, you know. Yes, I cant wait to show you the wonders of womenhood later tonight. Hope you don&#39;t mind being on top, since I doubt you could easily be under me now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Now you were very red. You hadn&#39;t thought of it, but Dr. Megan was seriously hot. And her exposed boob made her even sexier. Plus she aparently is a bi-lesbian, just like you!!</p>
