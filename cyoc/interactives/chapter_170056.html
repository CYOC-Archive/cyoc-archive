<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“...hang on a second folks, I think our young lovebirds might just be eager to finish their display right now!” <br />
<br />
Jenkins couldn’t quite explain why he felt the need to slump to the ground, ass and tail up in the air. Something about laying down beside this friendly female penguin made him feel warm and giddy inside. The tingling sensations had grown stronger and stronger, to the point that he was utterly fixated with Jen as she looked down at him.<br />
<br />
However, Jenkins was confused when he felt the female hop up onto his back. She then slowly shuffled backwards on top of him, making him feel slightly uncomfortable. Jen continued to edge backwards until she was standing essentially on top of his ass.<br />
<br />
Jenkins felt strange as he sensed that something wasn’t right. Why was Jen acting so weirdly all of a sudden?<br />
<br />
Jenkins soon answered his own question as he felt his tail rising purely out of instinct. Then he squawked out in shock when Jen suddenly squatted and pressed her body against his. There was an odd feeling between his legs as he felt contact on his new avian cloaca for the first time. And as he felt Jen pressing her lower body against him, he soon felt a similar ring of flesh amongst her feathers as their sexes brushed against each other.<br />
<br />
“As you can see,” the zookeeper continued, “the female lays down, after which the male mounts her. Then the couple make their sex organs connect in what’s called a ‘cloacal kiss,’ which will then allow the male to deliver his sperm to the female. And as you can see, Jen is a model example of a receptive female penguin. It won’t be long before she accepts Max as her new mate and then, hopefully in the near future, lays her first egg.”<br />
<br />
Despite being overwhelmed by everything that was happening, Jenkins was somewhat knocked back to his senses after hearing the zookeeper’s words. He felt like he had a pit in his stomach as he realised that he had made a big mistake. <br />
<br />
He wasn’t being referred to as Max at all. Instead his actions mirrored those of JEN!<br />
<br />
Dr Jenkins started to panic as he realised the extent of his current predicament. He was Jen, a female penguin. ‘He’ was in fact now a ‘SHE!’ <br />
<br />
This realisation hit the former doctor like a tonne of bricks but unfortunately this did nothing to deter the male on her back. Max was determined to impregnate the female beneath him, and so he forced his cloaca downwards, hunting eagerly for his mate’s elusive sex.<br />
<br />
Jen squawked out in surprise whenever their two sexes brushed each other. Even the brief flashes of contact made her aware that he, and she, were already incredibly aroused. Her cloaca now throbbed in need as it begged to touch that of her mate. She now felt hot and wet as a few drops of fluid started to dribble out of the pulsing organ.<br />
<br />
After searching for Jen’s snatch for a short while, Max eventually managed to line himself up correctly. He quickly capitalised by pressing down forcefully, allowing his organ to smother hers in a sensual ‘kiss,’ exactly as the announcer had described.<br />
<br />
Now that he was in position, Max began to stimulate the female by passionately grinding against her. This soon left Jen shaking and chirping in need as the friction on her sensitive virgin cloaca felt unbelievably good. She could also feel her mate’s arousal mixing with her own as their sexes rubbed together, causing her need to skyrocket as she eagerly awaited her mate’s load.<br />
<br />
As it happened, Jen wouldn’t have to wait much longer to get what she wanted.<br />
<br />
Max screeched out loudly as he pressed down hard against her, making sure that his cloaca completely smothered her own. Then Jen let out her own squawk of delight as she felt her mate’s hot semen starting to spray inside her.<br />
<br />
Max ejaculated for a few seconds before he finally hopped off his mate’s back, having utterly spent his modest load. However, more than enough cum had been emptied inside Jen for her to have been fertilised. Her cloaca and the channel leading to her egg chamber had been fully coated in viscous penguin cum. She could feel some of the excess oozing out of her sex as she shakily returned to her feet. Only now did Jen start to appreciate the implications of what she had just done: she was stuck like this forever!<br />
 <br />
“And there we have it, give it up for Max and Jen!” The crowd cheered and clapped in response to the keeper’s words, having clearly enjoyed the show. “That’s all for today folks, take care and have a good evening!”<br />
<br />
With that, the visitors slowly drifted away as the Zoo prepared to close within the next hour. Meanwhile, Jen stood motionless in her new enclosure, still mortified by her ordeal. This was it, this was her life now. Stuck as a dumb penguin, and a female at that!<br />
<br />
However, Jen then heard a familiar chirping from nearby. She turned to see Max flapping his flippers and wagging his tail excitedly. It soon became obvious what he wanted as he turned, flashing her his cloaca as he bent over. <br />
<br />
Jen hesitated for a second before despair began to settle into her mind. She had already been doomed so why fight it now? If she was stuck in this body she might as well enjoy herself where possible. And besides, Max wasn’t all that bad…<br />
<br />
Max chirped again in excitement as Jen slowly waddled towards him, leaving a faint trail of cum as she did so. Once she was beside him the couple tenderly started to preen each other like they had before, although this time it was an even more intimate and sensual display of affection. <br />
<br />
After a few minutes of this courtship both penguins had been worked back up into a state of wild primal lust. Max then stepped back and sang for his mate to present herself, eager to give her as much of his virile semen as he could. Jen dutifully obeyed her mate as she seductively slumped to the floor and raised her tail, flashing him her cloaca and signalling her readiness. Max quickly accepted Jen’s invitation with open arms as he hopped back on top of her and began probing again with his own throbbing organ.<br />
<br />
Soon the enclosure was filled with more lustful squawks as Jen started to settle into her new life, having fully embraced the fact that she would be a penguin forever...</p>
