<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Rick woke up in the morning later than he had planned but that was ok, he still had plenty of time to try and see a Sasquatch for himself. First though he would have to find where the picture was taken. After he had cleaned up for the day and put on some fresh clothes there was a knock on the door. Figuring it was the housekeeper he opened the door only to be confronted with two police officers, one male and the other female, and a professional looking woman wearing a white blouse and black skirt. Before Releasing cake could say anything the female officer said, &quot;I&#39;m Officer Goldman and this is Officer Floyd and our town chancellor Samantha Twist. We need to ask you a few questions and Mrs. Twist has some information she needs to tell you. May we come in?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh sure,&quot; Rick said taking a step back to let them in. He couldn&#39;t help but wonder just what this was about. &quot;I&#39;d offer something to drink but since I just got in last night I&#39;m afraid that I don&#39;t have anything to offer except water.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That alright we don&#39;t need anything,&quot; Officer Goldman said. Taking out a notebook she said, &quot;Now I assume that you&#39;re wondering why we&#39;re here. We just want to ask a couple of questions and then Mrs. Twist will tell you information that you need to know.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rick nodded as he said, &quot;Alright ask your questions.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Have you ever heard the name Karen Charlston or Marcus Gamboni?&quot; Officer Goldman asked watching him carefully.<br />
<br />
Rick looked confused as he said, &quot;I haven&#39;t heard those names. Should I have?&quot;<br />
<br />
Officer Floyd smiled before saying, &quot;There&#39;s no reason why you should have heard of Karen Charlston but you maybe you have heard the name Gamboni before. Their a pretty major crime family.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rick shrugged before replying with, &quot;Well I don&#39;t know the names of any crime families since I&#39;ve never been interested in them. Why did you ask me that question.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The Charlstons just moved here to get away from Marcus Gamboni who seems to think that Karen Charlston is his,&quot; Officer Goldman said. &quot;We take protecting the residents of this town seriously and since you happened to arrive after them we need to be careful.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s understandable,&quot; Rick said nodding.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now we were told that you&#39;re here to try and see a Sasquatch and that you have a picture of one,&quot; Officer Floyd said. &quot;May we see it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course,&quot; Rick said brining up the picture on his phone. Maybe they have some idea of whether or not it&#39;s a hoax.<br />
<br />
After a few moments they nodded and Officer Goldman said, &quot;Well thank you for answering our questions. Now we need to go but Mrs. Twist will stay and tell you a little bit about our town.&quot;<br />
<br />
The officers nodded and left the room. After they left Mrs. Twist turned to Rick and said, &quot;As the officers said I have something to tell you about Moon Lake. We normally don&#39;t do this for those that are just passing through or are staying for so short of time but we believe that you need to hear this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So what is it?&quot; Rick asked wondering what kind of secret this town had. Maybe they actually know the Sasquatch exists.<br />
<br />
&quot;Most of the residents here are werebeasts,&quot; Mrs. Twist said with a straight face. Well her face wasn&#39;t quite straight as it was shifting and pushing out into a muzzle while fur grew on it. Her ears grew pointed and traveled up to the top of her head while the fur traveled down her neck and arms. As the fur reached her hands her fingernails grew into cat claws. Looking down Rick could see the fur travel down her legs as she kicked off her shoes before her feet lengthened and she was standing on her toes while they morphed into paws. Finally a tail poked through the back of her skirt.<br />
<br />
Rick smiled and then said, &quot;I knew weres were real. There&#39;s just too many stories about them for there not to be some basis in fact.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mrs. Twist nodded saying, &quot;You&#39;re taking this better than most of the other people I&#39;ve told. The only ones that accepted right away it like you seem to be doing are Nate Anderson and Karen Charlston. But now that you know our secret you have to become a werebeast yourself.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why is that?&quot; Rick asked a bit puzzled. &quot;I&#39;m not going to tell anyone that weres are real. At best they wouldn&#39;t believe me and at worst I&#39;d be in a psychiatric hospital.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I see that you&#39;ve already figured it out,&quot; Mrs. Twist said with a smile on her cat face. &quot;While it may be true that you won&#39;t tell the town laws clearly state that at least one member of a family must become a were or the individual who finds out about werebeasts if there is no family unless they are attending college or live outside the town and working within it and have signed a non disclosure agreement. Now you&#39;ll be able to pick which were you want to become though we&#39;ll give you some time to decide.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rick thought back to his dream and asked, &quot;Are there werecheetahs?&quot;<br />
<br />
Mrs. Twist nodded and said, &quot;There are but you won&#39;t be able to become one.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why is that?&quot; Rick asked a bit perplexed.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s because werecheetahs like werecats are entirely female,&quot; Mrs. Twist said handing Rick a little book. &quot;This will explain more about werebeasts and what types there are and how to become one. Now like I said you&#39;ll have the chance to decide on what type of were you become. You won&#39;t be able to leave Moon Lake until you do but we won&#39;t force the change on you unless you try to leave. So far we haven&#39;t had to force anyone to change and they&#39;ve been able to pick what were they became except for two who were changed into were-foxes by a rogue were-fox. Now I&#39;ll leave you to read that and I would suggest going out and meeting some of the other werebeasts. Though be careful how you ask people since there are normals who have either signed the forms and don&#39;t really believe werebeasts are real or those that are just passing through.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why did you tell me about the town if you normally don&#39;t do so for people passing through?&quot; Rick asked a little perplexed.<br />
<br />
Mrs. Twist stopped with her hand on the doorknob. Turning her head as she reverted back to looking human she said, &quot;Because you came to see a Sasquatch which is a weregorilla and you might have been able to see one which would have made this necessary anyway so we decided not to wait until that time.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rick nodded and Mrs. Twist left leaving him alone. He decided that he might as well read through the guide that she had left. As he read through it he was fascinated with all the different species of werebeasts and the three ways for a normal to become one. Having sex with one seemed the most pleasurable and fastest way while being scratched was the slowest. The guide did say that one can not change their sex by becoming a werebeast though considering when it was originally written that may not be true. After all back in that time the thought that someone would actually want to change their sex was probably a foreign idea to them. Still after all this time one would think that a male would have tried becoming a werebeast that was strictly female. Of course the guide also said that the different groups tended to be a bit picky about who they turned so one that the werebeast species was all female probably wouldn&#39;t entertain the idea of a male joining them or an all male species having a female join them. Once he was done reading the guide he had to consider what he would do now. He could go meet some of the werebeasts around town and ask them how it felt to be one or maybe he could go to the woods and try to spot the weregorilla in the picture. One thing he knew was that the decision of what werebeast to become wasn&#39;t something to be taken lightly as the guide had said that once a normal became a werebeast they were that werebeast for the rest of their lives.</p>
