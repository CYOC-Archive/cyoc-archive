<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The idea of being carried around and cared for by women did sound nice, but Max wasn’t into them treating him like a possession. He needed to have a say in how things played out. Not to mention he still wasn’t super comfortable with the idea of sexing his family. Not yet, maybe some day. But for now, he needed to regain control. He went over to the machine and input… WHAT IF WOMEN WERE NATURALLY MORE SUBMISSIVE TOWARD ME AND WERE MORE LIKELY TO DO WHAT I SAID? The signifying flash let Max know it worked and he turned to his mother who was still getting ready for work. While it wasn’t ideal, he needed to test his change. After all, he didn’t want women graveling at his feet, he just needed to make sure he had authority if things got out if hand. But then another thought hit him, the machine changes the past. How different were things now? He didn’t like being blindsided by these changes. He needed to be aware of the repercussions. <br />
<br />
WHAT IF I WOKE UP THIS MORNING WITH THE ABILITY TO SUMMON ANY KNOWLEDGE I WANTED? He wanted to make sure to change as little as possible with that one, that’s why he put “this morning” as to not change the past. Thinking to himself, ‘What has my family life like growing up?’ Max asked. It was obvious after he thought about it. His mother and sisters were very caring and affectionate towards him, resulting in your father having to be the voice of reason and discipline. But Max didn’t hate him for it. He was his father, it was his responsibility to raise him right. In the end, his life really wasn’t that different except Max got along much better with his sisters. “Good,” Max said aloud.<br />
<br />
“What’s good?” His mother asked as she put in her earrings. <br />
<br />
“Just lost in thought,” Max responded. ‘How much power do I have over women?’ He asked himself. The answer was clear. Any woman, even a complete stranger, would act respectfully toward him, but still within their normal character. They would do just about anything he told them to, within reason. Combined with his other ability, women would now fall for him even faster. “That’ll do,” Max determined. ‘Now, for some fun,’ He thought looking at the machine. WHAT IF THE AVERAGE HEIGHT OF WOMEN WAS 8 FEET TALL? The flash filled his eyes before a shadow covered the machine. He looked at his mother who previously had been shorter than him now loomed taller as she slipped on a blazer. ‘How tall is she?’ Max wondered. 8ft 6in obviously. ‘How different is my life now?’ All in all, not too much different. History here and there had been changed as women over the past century had skyrocketed in height. That combined with their increased muscle mass resulted in a slight change in gender roles, but nothing that affected Max very much. After all, women naturally yielded to him. <br />
<br />
Max couldn’t help but stare at his mother’s ass, her increased frame had allowed her to carry her larger butt better. Her hips no longer appeared to be so disproportionate. In the mirror he could see her breasts were the same L cups they had been previously, which disappointed him honestly. He had hoped for woman to grow all over, but he had only mentioned height in the change. Well, that was easily rectified. <br />
<br />
WHAT IF THE AVERAGE SIZE OF WOMENS BREASTS INCREASED TO M CUPS? That was more like it. Or, so he thought. When he looked back at his mother, her breasts hadn’t grown. That is, at first. For some reason, the change wasn’t instant. Britney’s boobs began surge in size, which also caused her ass and hips to swell in accordance with his other change. Also as he had instructed before, her muscles grew to allow her easy maneuverability. Max loved the cascading changes. He was really starting to see his mother as a potential sexual partner, but things weren’t quite right. She should have stopped growing by now. If things were consistent with his first change, she should have only gained four cup sizes. But Max was sure she had already exceeded that. ‘What’s happening?’ He wondered. Then, it was obvious. His first change stated “what if the size of women’s breasts increased to the point than an a cup was the equivalent size of a h cup?” That resulted in his mother having K cups by previous standards, but technically she was still considered a D cup. So when he input “what if the average size of women’s breasts increased to m cups?” His mother was growing in accordance to the new measurements. That meant she was becoming what was previously know as a V cup. The reason the change hadn’t been instant, was the What_If machine was processing multiple changes at once causing it to lag. But Max was still the only one who noticed. Looking at his mother, Max admitted. She was bigger then he intended, but… it wasn’t unappealing. Britney’s chest stuck out over a foot in front of her. This meant her ass stuck out 2 feet behind her and her hips stretched out farther that her shoulders. Her muscles kept up with the growth, making Britney body builder levels of muscular. Max swallowed the lump in his throat. One more change, then he’d stop for now. WHAT IF WOMEN ALL OVER THE WORLD THOUGHT IT FASHIONABLE TO WEAR TIGHT, WELL FITTING CLOTHS? The pencil skirt his mother was wearing suddenly sucked itself tightly to her ass, allowing Max to easily see every curve and crease on her skin. And first he thought she wasn’t wearing underwear, then he realized that her ass was so large her panties were simply trapped between the bulging cheeks. Her blazer mostly hid the muscles on her back, but her arms were obvious. In the mirror, Max saw her cleavage proudly displayed. Each boob fit nearly to bursting, but were securely in placed in her bra. Her abs were also prominently displayed, but the buttons on her shirt showed no sigh of strain. It was tailored for this exact look. <br />
<br />
Max’d been checking Britney out for so long he hadn’t noticed his mother’s eyes looking at him in the mirror. She did her best not to smile. Taking even breaths, she avoided looking at Max’s crotch. She was still his mother after all. But, she did love how his stare made her feel. Especially since her husband… The two of them had somehow managed to lock eyes in the mirror. Both of their faces flushed red but both kept composure. <br />
<br />
“The bus will be here soon. Go get some breakfast, then get to school,” she instructed, to which Max obeyed. Britney bit her lip as the door closed. What was she going to do with that boy?</p>
