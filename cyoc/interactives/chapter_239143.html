<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">First, Tracey decides to wait until Vicky is conceived. A few minutes later, as Ann and Bryan had fallen asleep, exhausted from their several rounds of lovemaking, Vicky’s name appeared on the laptop’s screen. Tracey was glad that happened, she didn’t wanted Vicky to disappear, but she wasn&#39;t opposed to trying a new experiment with the game. Tracey then clicked on Vicky&#39;s name and hesitated a moment before moving to the gender tab and switching Vicky from female to male. Instantly Vicky&#39;s name updates to Victor, and once that is set, Tracey ages Victor up using the laptop. Back in the bedroom, Ann&#39;s belly slowly begins to swell and grow until it dissipates and a newborn Victor appears on top of her stomach like Sarah had on top of Janet&#39;s earlier. <br />
<br />
Tracey then tiptoed into the bedroom, and picked Victor up, the pudgy blonde baby boy sleeping soundly as Tracey took him out of the room swiftly and quietly before setting him down in the nursery that one of the other rooms in the house had transformed into not long after Victor had appeared.<br />
<br />
After she had managed to put Victor down for his nap, Tracey then returned to her laptop to see Ann and Bryan, having woken up and were beginning yet another round. Curious as to what other changes she could make, Tracey then opened their profiles and pulled up their &quot;hormonal index&quot; menus and placed them side by side on the screen. Curious, Tracey decided to tweak their hormones a little bit to see what would happen.<br />
<br />
Currently, Bryan&#39;s testosterone was spiking--not as high as it had earlier according to the immediate past history, and Ann&#39;s progesterone levels were on the rise while her estrogen levels were dropping--and observing what was happening in the room, it seemed that Bryan was trying to convince Ann for another round, while Ann seemed to be going along half-heartedly. Tracey decided what if she boosted Ann&#39;s estrogen levels a bit.<br />
<br />
As Tracey grabbed Ann&#39;s estrogen bar and started to slide it up higher a few notches--not tremendously fast, unseen to her but Ann&#39;s ovaries responded by each releasing an egg. Tracey watched as Ann suddenly seemed more in favor of Bryan&#39;s advances, and Bryan&#39;s testosterone levels seemed to be responding in kind and spiking back to where they had when Bryan and Ann were ready to conceive Victor. Bryan was soon inside of Ann, and the two were thrusting rather rhythmically until both of their hormonal spikes peaked and they cried out in orgasm, or at least they peaked for Bryan as he let forth his load. Ann seemed to settle into a cycle after her orgasm where the estrogen would rise and then fall in increasingly shrinking waves of pleasure. Soon, both Bryan and Ann were knocked out cold from their renewed sexual escapades, and Tracey received notification of a new conception.<br />
<br />
Tracey toggled over to Ann&#39;s main profile and found listed under her were now three names, two girls, and a boy: Donna, Stephanie, & Eric. <br />
<br />
&#39;&#39;Looks like I made more babies for these two&#39;&#39; thought Tracey.<br />
<br />
Tracey then engaged the game again. Ann&#39;s belly soon swells to become nine months pregnant with triplets, and then with a flash, all three newborns appear around Ann. Eric is laying on top of her stomach, Lily and Stephanie on either side of Ann. Tracey then gets a rather wicked notion and selects Bryan and Ann&#39;s profiles and sets their ages both to newborn and enters the room to pick up Eric and placed him next to his sisters and stepped back to watch the transformation take place.<br />
<br />
Bryan begins to lose his musclature first, followed by his five o&#39;clock shadow smoothing over and some of his angular features in his face rounding as he leaves his twenties. There&#39;s not many changes, perhaps he loses an inch of height, but overall as he returns to being a High School senior he still appears to be an athletic boy with copper red hair that&#39;s perhaps a bit shaggy in appearance. Ann meanwhile loses any sign of having born children as stretch marks smooth away, her stomach flattens, her breasts shrink and readjust to a slightly higher position as they loose the milk within them. She loses a bit of weight and grows slimmer as she leaves her twenties and returns to high school not much different than she had appeared as a young adult.<br />
<br />
The next few moments proved rather transformative for both of them. Bryan dramatically began to lose muscle mass and body hair faster than he had before, leaving him an increasingly smooth, skinny, and lanky beanpole with increasingly outsized hands and feet that made him look awkward as he looked more freshman than high school senior. Ann&#39;s hips grew less voluptuous and curvy, and her breasts shrank accordingly--she was quickly losing her feminine curves and lost an inch or two of height as well. Her face was also growing thinner.<br />
<br />
And then Bryan and Ann experienced a shrink spurt, first him, making his outsized hands and feet look positively clownish in dimensions until they too shrank to appear more proportional. As they did, Bryan&#39;s dick, which had shrunk in proportion with his body truly crossed the line of puberty as his testicles were pulled back up against his body and his penis shrank from a dick to a boy&#39;s nub as the few hairs he had sported above it shrank back into his skin leaving him as smooth as a prepubescent boy could be. Ann then experienced a shrink spurt a little after Bryan as she joined him on the other side of puberty, her pubic mound losing its hair, and her figure becoming as straight as a board as her hips lost all curviness, and her breasts devolved to buds and then tiny puffs, and finally the nipples almost resembled Bryan&#39;s. Both of their faces were now completely childish looking.<br />
<br />
They then continued to shrink through childhood more regularly as they began reaquiring baby fat and chubbiness as they went from preteens to children, children to tykes, tykes to tots, and tots to toddlers. Soon, two toddlers were replaced with two additional newborns on the bed.<br />
<br />
At that point, Tracey picked up the strawberry blonde infant Stephanie and took her over to the nursery where Victor slept, while at the same time bringing Bryan along with her. She set Stephanie in the crib with Victor before deciding to head back to her laptop and selected the two infants in the nursery to grow to 22 years old and for reality to alter as it did. She suspended the transformation while she similarly set up the same transformation for Donna and Eric in the master bedroom. With both transformations suspended, Tracey quickly swooped back into the bedroom, grabbed baby Ann and then returned to her laptop to initiate both transformations at once.<br />
<br />
With the press of the Enter button, Tracey watched the infant newborns in each room grow into children, the nursery shifting into a children&#39;s bedroom as it did, with the crib into a child&#39;s bed that both were sleeping on. Then from children into teenagers, Tracey watched as Victor grew from a cute blonde little boy into what appeared to be a blonde teenage Adonis sleeping on a full-sized guest bed.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think Victor looks better now than he did as Vicky,&quot; thought Tracey randomly as she watched him mature and fully grow into a hot twenty-two year old stud that made Tracey&#39;s groin ache with longing at the sight of him.<br />
<br />
She quickly made sure both couples were kept asleep and then sneaked back in to each room, leaving Bryan on top of Stephanie&#39;s belly and Ann on Donna&#39;s, before returning back to her laptop and having both Bryan and Ann grow younger, popping into their former daughters, now mothers respectively, whose bellies stretched out to be nine months along with their respective babies.<br />
<br />
Tracey watched as both couples woke up and interacted, she had set for Bryan and Ann to slowly grow younger to conception so she could get an idea of who each couple were in this altered universe.<br />
<br />
&quot;Vick... could I get a bit of help here?&quot; asked Stephanie, and Victor roused himself and quickly scooted over to help Stephanie to sit up, he then sliding behind her and massaging her shoulders and back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oohh, that feels good.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It should, knowing that I know what to do with my hands,&quot; suggested Victor as he leaned in and cupped Stephanie&#39;s enlarged breasts, gently rubbing the top of her exposed areolas, causing Stephanie to shiver all the while her nine month belly shrank to eight months.<br />
<br />
&quot;Being a chiropractor and a masseuse are two entirely different fields of study,&quot; countered Stephanie.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, and you&#39;re lucky to have married a man who&#39;s licensed in both,&quot; whispered Victor.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not complaining in the least,&quot; said Stephanie as she rounded from the third trimester to the second.<br />
<br />
The brunette Donna and raven-haired Eric meanwhile were in the midst of Eric massaging his wife&#39;s foot which were slightly swollen from the pregnancy with Ann, but even that swelling was going down and the massage was turning somewhat erotic as Eric slowly and gently stroking his hands up Donna&#39;s legs as the surpassed the half-way point in the pregnancy and Donna&#39;s belly was shrinking rapidly now.<br />
<br />
&quot;Careful where you put that hand, we don&#39;t want to start something that&#39;ll hurt the baby,&quot; cautioned Donna.<br />
<br />
&quot;Never, but that doesn&#39;t mean we have to deprive ourselves of all... pleasure,&quot; suggested Eric with a devilish grin as he gently stroked her labia, causing Donna to shiver as she left her second trimester and her belly shrank to almost an impossible to notice swelling.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know, it&#39;s still early enough to have one last bit of fun,&quot; suggested Donna with an equally devilish glint in her eyes that matched Eric&#39;s, and the two leaned in to make out. Not long thereafter did Victor and Stephanie join in themselves. Soon both Victor and Eric were positioning their erections into their wives eager vaginas and then thrusting as the last few months of development ebbed away until they both were going hot and heavy with their respective partners and Tracey figured that Bryan and Ann were drawing near to being unconceived, which her expectations were met as first Eric and Donna and then Victor and Stephanie let out their orgasmic cries and their names disappeared from under their mothers&#39; names. Tracey, like before, waited until both couples had recovered and were &quot;trying again&quot; and had reconceived both Bryan and Ann before doing anything further with the game. She loved the idea of conceiving and unconceiving, but she didn&#39;t want to really mess around with destroying the chance of someone&#39;s existence truly--just altering it a bit.</p>
