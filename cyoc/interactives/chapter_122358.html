<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The 4 guys began to walk to the monstrous lineman, almost like they were in a trance. Coach just smiled and walked to the equipment room, the 4 now under bull and his beastly boys control! &quot;Coach done said you 4 gonna be like us, so we gotta share our foods and trains you!&quot; All 4 nodded like in a dream, and followed them as they waddled off the field to a new building that appeared. A neon sign was above it saying &quot;Lineman&#39;s buffet, eat till you pop!&quot; All the guys walked in except for bulls new brother, who had to be pushed through, his wide chest and ass to big for the door. A old women with a crooked nose said &quot;oh dear! My poor boys, you all looks so hungry! My fattening food will help you be big boys again!&quot; Bull bent down, almost worshiping her, along with the other two beastly lineman, and said &quot;my gaining mistress, the coach sent these 4 to be like us! Can you help?&quot; The old women cackled as she brought out a large cart full of delicious smelling food. <br />
<br />
The bigger lineman began shoveling down with there hands, swallowing whole chickens, pies by the dozens, and a score of whole watermelons And cantaloupe! The other 4 smelling all the good things, began to eat, and found they to were pigging out like crazy! The ball carrier in particular, gulped down the food, saying with a full mouth &quot;this is so good! It all tastes so juicy and plump!&quot; The old lady chuckled as the others gulped and slurped, making messes of there shirts and jerseys. &quot;Oh my dears! You were hungry! Here comes seconds! Bull you and your brother help these poor things eat there second helpings! And if they have room, stuff them with thirds!&quot; Bull just nodded as he slurped up his food, picking the bones clean and spitting them out. The next tray came, and bull along with his two buddies walked over to the others, who were holding there bellies. All 4 began to make a loud pop noise, as there belly buttons became outies, and there guts began to sag slightly! &quot;Were so full! We can&#39;t eat anymore bull!&quot; The one pleaded. Bull smiled and his buddies began to force feed them, the 4 gulping down the food, holding there stomachs painfully, until second course was over. &quot;Now you boys come back after they give you practice and we&#39;ll get you 3 helpings next time!&quot; The old lady said as all of them waddled out, bull pushing his brother through the door again, the frame creaking more under the pressure till it snapped off.<br />
<br />
Bull and his brother, along with his friend began to train them, there minds obedient like coach wanted, and after a hour of practice, the night sky came out, and the old lady summoned them in again with a smile! After the three course meal, all the guys waddled out again, bulls brother just able to squeeze through again. The 4 snapped out of it like nothing happened as bull told them to go home and sleep. All 4 waddled home with heavy full bellies, and stronger bodies. <br />
<br />
The next morning they all woke up, a huge hunger taking over! The ball carrier went to the scale and was stunned to see he now weighed 480lbs! &quot;Holy crap! Yesterday I was only 140lbs! What happened!?&quot; Just as he was about to call his mom in horror, an urge came over, and he put on some big sweat pants bull gave when they ripped, and waddled back to the field with his equipment. When he got there, his other friends were there standing dumbly, bull and his buddies slowly waddling up to them. &quot;Let&#39;s eats some more food! Iz starved!&quot; Bull shouted and all of them waddled back to the building with the women smiling and waving. <br />
<br />
After 3 more 4 course meals, and several hours of practice and weight training, 3 of them were big and strong, with protruding guts that made powerlifter a look skinny! One had hips and ass bigger then bulls brother, and huffed as he waddled onto the field with the others. Coach came out, yelling for them to come over, and all 6 waddled slowly, there fat and heavy frames swaying around as they did. He counted and only saw 6, &quot;where&#39;s the other one!? I wanted 7 lineman here!&quot; Bull said &quot;but coach it was only 6?&quot; Coach scratched his head and nodded saying &quot;your right bull! Let&#39;s play!&quot; <br />
<br />
Meanwhile the former ball carrier, now lineman, was sitting at the building eating more then anyone could imaging! &quot;More please! I need more food!&quot; He said as he gulped and sloshed and slurped. The old women cackled, watching as his lineman form grew larger and wider, all the while he ate more and more! &quot;I love pie! I love beef roast! Ooooh! 200 cookies!&quot; The player just kept eating, his frame so large now his mobility was completely restricted at this point. He must have weighed 2,000lbs, a blubbering mass that resembled the shape of a water balloon. &quot;Please help! I wanna eat more!&quot; He pleaded as the women came over with a spoon<br />
<br />
Soon his skin stretched out so much, it became translucent, taking on the see through skin of a giant balloon. &quot;My goodness! Almost full! Just one more bite and you&#39;ll be all done!&quot; She played with him, his form a now clear mass, filled with air, now just a clear giant pear shaped balloon with what was left of a head. He opened his mouth, whimpering as she pushed it in. He gulped and swallowed, and his skin stretched its final inch, groaning as his head dissapered into his body, along with what had resembled Fat hands and feet. She touched him<br />
Slightly, and there was a loud bang that shook the building, and with a cackle she said &quot;I love that part! That coach should send me more future balloons!&quot; And walked away turning on the buffet sign</p>
