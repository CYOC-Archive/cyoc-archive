<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Rowan, panicking, ran straight for the Ointment Store as fast as he could. He didn't know it, but he was moving at incredible speeds. Speeds that would put Olympic runners to shame. That's because his muscles were configuring to move a big steed, not a human. He was a blur to those on the street, not giving anyone the chance to notice his inhuman looks, which kept changing faster and faster as he ran. He was now entirely covered in a velvety coat of dark-sandy colored hair, his hair now resembling a mane, was darker in color. By the time he reached the store, his hands were already becoming hooves, while his head was already that of a horse's.<br />
<br />
&quot;YOU! THIS! FIX!&quot; Rowan yelled, unable to find words. Yet again, he disturbed the man while he was trying to do something, this time, eating a cake. Well, now he'd have to eat it off the floor.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, you.&quot; The shop keep said, staring at Rowan. A smile crossed his face, as the ointment worked faster than he imagined. &quot;Looks like you had a bad reaction, come to the back of the store. I can fix this. By the way, what is your name?&quot;<br />
<br />
Rowan answered as he quickly followed the owner &quot;Rowan! He-&quot;, but was greeted with a collar as apposed to a remedy. His neck was now as thick as it would be, so the collar wasn't going anywhere; Rowan was chained down. He looked down as he seen his stomach turn in, his spine elongating and becoming mostly horizontal to accommodate his new body as a steed, causing his clothes to rip and tear until they were bits of nothing. He now had a tail as well, bark-brown in color, matching his mane. He made a rather beautiful horse, with his big eyes of green and his fur of sandy-brown. Since he was strong and manly as a human, he was rather powerful and masculine as a horse, he could easily outrun the horses down at the track where he used to bet. Ironic, isn't it? Too bad he can't bet on himself. Or at all, for that matter.<br />
<br />
&quot;No! NOOOO! HELP! SOME! HEEEEELP&quot; Rowan cried, gasping for air. He tried to yell for help again, but all that came out was a giant neigh, as his vocal chords were transformed as well. The deed was done, no part of Rowan was no longer human, except his brain, of course. He struggled, he neighed some more, he tried to bite the owner, but nothing worked. He slumped to the floor, tears rolling down his new &quot;face&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;A dashing human makes a dashing horse. . . Oh lighten up, that was a joke, get it, dashing? Horses dash! But don't worry, you dry those little tears now. I'll help you find a nice home. No need to thank me, the payment someone would give for something like you would be more than enough. See, your luck is turned around, Rowan. A pretty little horse like you will find a nice home. Gone are the days you have to worry about paying bills, finding jobs, or doing anything a human does, since you're not human. . . Ro-o-o-owan.&quot; The shop keep said with a smile, though he was just trying to rub it in Rowan's face, putting a horse-like-emphasis on Rowan's name just to get at him even more. &quot;I like the name. I think I'll call you Rowan, Rowan the steed. Now to see who'll pay the most for you. . . I'll be back later. Water and food is over there.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rowan didn't even look at the store owner, he just cried and cried, each word causing Rowan to shiver in fear. He could now hear the Owner making phone calls to many people, but within 5 minutes, the Owner seemed to make up his mind. Within another 10 uneventful minutes, Rowan heard the door open. Instead of worrying about his own woes, he thought about the poor and misfortunate person who would be tricked next. He got up and caused a ruckus, making every sound he possibly could with his new set of vocal chords. Despite being a horse, he was still the same, compassionate, kind,  um, stupid and gullible.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh that's him?&quot; A faint voice whispered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, that's him. He really is quite fetching, I'm sure you'll be happy.&quot; The shop keeper replied. &quot;Here he is. His name is Rowan&quot;<br />
<br />
Rowan now stared at the newcomer, the person that would be taking him away and treating him like, well, a horse. His future owner circled Rowan, inspecting every inch of him in the most critical of ways.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's a deal,&quot; said Rowan's new owner, handing over a check to the shop keeper. &quot;You'll be coming with me, Rowan.&quot;</p>
