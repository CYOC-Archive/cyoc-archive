<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Pete decided to become a snake as a first experience. He always liked to see on Nat Geo Wild, especially pythons.<br />
<br />
&quot;I want to be an African python&quot; he murmured to himself, still incredulous on the voices that came to him. Pete closed his eyes as a way to better focus himself. He opened and nothing had happened, He gave a smile to himself, how could he be 26 and believe he could transform himself into any animal or insect? How naïve and childish could he be?<br />
<br />
&quot;I have besser sings to do&quot; he cried out loud as if he&#39;d wake up form that stupid hypnotic state. He immediately noticed something wasn&#39;t right about what had just happened. The situation was becoming too weird and Pete stood up from the couch and look normal at the TV where he saw his reflexion. Again...something was off. He was different. It hit him - his mustache was gone. He took his hands to his mouth to feel not only he didn&#39;t have a mustache but also his skin was rather dry and his lips were forming a rough texture. He took a good look at his hands when he retrieved them and notice the brown dots forming in his skin. <br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;sss happening?&quot; he whispered and felt a sniveling snake tongue vibrating between his scaly lips. He gave a cry and ran upstairs to his bathroom. Pete couldn&#39;t believe his eyes. He was indeed transforming into an Africa Python as the voices had promised him. Was that a dream? Either way, he was going to enjoy it. He took off his shirt and took a better look at his body. He first noticed his skin was becoming imbued in that cream-colored hue tone. He passed his hand along int and fell the scales being formed. His hairline was actively receding and he was becoming more bald. He raised his armpits and passe his hand again through his chest - his body hair was gone. Pete smiled at the situation and his skull made the funniest face he&#39;d ever seen. He was torn between amazed and actually scared by his own looks.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thiss iss awssssome!&quot; he exclaimed, with a raspy dragging voice. His tongue once more quivered in front of him. Pete got closer to the mirror and opened his mouth to take a better look at it. His teeth were also being replaced by reptilian fangs in a rather painful process than was now after he acknowledged it becoming even more uncomfortable. His attention was quickly driven to his eyes whose irises became bright yellow right there. It was like someone had injected the color within them. He gave a step back and watched his body again. His muscles were gone and his body was becoming skinnier. His scales were also much denser and he noticed that his back had already turned into a python skin. He took off his pants and his briefs to witness the smooth path it had been formed down there. Somehow...ironically Pete was proud of his ausent manhood.<br />
<br />
&quot;I am going to be trapped in here&quot; he quickly thought, talking to the mirror. He turned off the lights and ran naked downstairs - unbeknownst to him his backbone was already expanding to a tail. He went tot he living room and opened the glass door he had to his garden. He wasn&#39;t sure how he was going to turn back if just one thought would be enough if the voices decided or any other scenario...either way he left the door opened just for the occasion. His glasses fell on the floor when he was peeking to the other houses, expecting no noisy neighbor would be alert. His ears had received...but his sight didn&#39;t need them anymore. When he was sure no one was looking, he ran across the grass to the tree on the other side. He climbed it quickly...feeling for the first time his new skin in contact with Nature. That as a freeing sensation - Pete wasn&#39;t any longer the 26 years old guy that had to pay taxes and get his ass to work. He was an African python now. He installed himself on a branch with a tail that was as long as his legs already and waited. The transformed kept going on: his fingers and feet become nothing but a reminiscent of a limb as if he was an amputee. That was by far the worst feeling until that moment. The transformation took an incredible jump from that moment on, with each deep breathing triggering it more.<br />
<br />
His skull pushed out, his members finally were integrated and with the bat of an eye, he became a fully functional African Python. His first instinct was to &quot;dive&quot; downwards to the floor, and his sinuous body followed his movement through the branches. When he had the slight impression he&#39;d fall he launched his head up, rather dramatically. His body responded and followed his movement...it fell like normally raising his head from the pillow on a Sunday morning...a familiar sensation.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is going to be cool!&quot; he thought.</p>
