<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Author&#39;s note: This story is a sequel to an old but great story that was originally on Writing.com. It vanished with it&#39;s author, so you can&#39;t find the whole story everywhere. There is a revival story on that same website that&#39;s trying to get it back but only pieces every couple months. This is a story that will follow the same device with a slightly different scenario.<br />
<br />
Info: Please read or at least skim this, as I&#39;d like to keep the device&#39;s ability consistent<br />
<br />
The Role Swapper: A small, handheld device that can swap a person&#39;s life role. This means they are in that person&#39;s life, but their body stays the same. Clothing will resize and hair will grow or vanish but their body will not change. The only time a body might change is with an inanimate object, as how that sort of change works is up to you.<br />
<br />
It will alter reality so that the swapped will always have had that role and only those holding the device will remember who or what has been changed. Everyone will think it&#39;s for example, perfectly normal if a dude is in a woman&#39;s life. Sometimes the device will short circuit and other times it may do more then was asked of it but it&#39;s mostly good.<br />
<br />
Example change: A white woman has the device, and swaps with a black man. The woman will now be wearing his clothes, resized to fit her, she will have any tattoos or piercings, and all of her hair will be like his, but in her color. It might be styled in dreads but be her hair&#39;s texture and blond hue. The guy will have the woman&#39;s clothes, hairstyle, and life, but since he wasn&#39;t holding the device, he also will believe he has always been that woman. Completely regardless of race and gender, everyone would treat him like that white woman.<br />
<br />
But, perhaps the swapper has another hidden feature somewhere on it? Who knows?<br />
<br />
And that&#39;s it really. Good luck, have fun.<br />
<br />
________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________<br />
<br />
Kyle was done with everything. His life sucked. He was screwing up in the love department, screwing up in his school priorities, and now he just lost his measly job cooking freaking hot dogs. &quot;How do you even lose something so stupidly easy?!&quot; Kyle yelled to himself. He was sadly walking down the street to his hall on campus. He knew one of his shitty roommates might&#39;ve been there but he didn&#39;t care, he just wanted to rest.<br />
<br />
On the way, as he walked in shame, a light appeared above him. Suddenly it grew in size and a man popped out of it. He was looked confused as he started to say something.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, you&#39;re not the Roy of this-&quot; WHAM.<br />
<br />
Kyle had instinctively punched the guy in the face. It was a reflex! He didn&#39;t mean to, but in his defense most probably would have done that. The man was dressed in some strange future looking outfit and was holding a shiny object in his hand. Kyle eyed the device and turned around to see no one was nearby. He would feel bad about this but he did not need to go to court for assault and that thing looked like it could be worth money.<br />
<br />
Kyle quickly grabbed the device and booked it back to his dorm. He walked in with the object hidden in his coat. Sitting on the couch was his annoying suite mate Alex Che. Alex was a lazy bastard who never cleaned up after himself. He was watching tv on the couch and barely acknowledged Kyle&#39;s presence as he just kept on watching his Korean soap operas. <br />
<br />
Kyle was gonna just go into his room to hide the device when he noticed a tie on the door. His roommate Ty was in there, along with his stupid girlfriend Brook. He could here some muffled giggles as he sighed and sat on the kitchen counter. He sat there sadly and looked at it. Upon further inspection, it wasn&#39;t much of anything. It was a small, remote sized grey oval with a few tiny buttons and one big button on it. The big button drew his attention as it said swap.<br />
<br />
Kyle pointed it at Alex and hit swap but nothing happened. He realized there were two lights next to the swap button and only one was lit. He pointed the device at the tv Alex was watching and, suddenly, right before Kyle&#39;s eyes, things changed.<br />
<br />
On the tv was a soap opera Korean man in a suit yelling about something. To the man&#39;s right, was Alex?! It was Alex on the show, except he looked weird. His hair was past his shoulders and he looked like he had makeup on. He was wearing a big dress that hugged his chest and he was crying on the show, also speaking in Korean.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alex...&quot; Kyle mustered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah?&quot; He heard a feminine voice say.<br />
<br />
Kyle turned and saw a 20 something Korean woman sitting on their couch. She had her hair as short as Alex&#39;s was, had no makeup, and was  wearing nothing but a sweatshirt and boxers. There was no bulge in her pants and her breasts were making her, or Alex&#39;s, sweatshirt look weird. She was just, there.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dude. What&#39;s up, I want to get back to my show.&quot; The woman said in Alex&#39;s obnoxious tone. <br />
<br />
Kyle looked on screen and Alex was paused as he was kissing the actor?! He looked back and told &quot;Alex&quot; it was nothing. She just grunted and went back to watching her show. She belched and scratched her crotch as Kyle just looked on in shock. He looked down and saw &quot;Alex&#39;s&quot; ID. It was all the same info, but the picture was of this woman.<br />
<br />
Kyle looked at the print on top of the device and read the words &quot;Role Swapper.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Holy shit.&quot; Kyle thought. &quot;This thing can switch people&#39;s lives. Their life roles. Alex is an actor somewhere being treated as a woman. While this girl thinks she&#39;s some college aged dude. Oh, I can use this.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kyle smirked as he thought of the possibilities. He could improve his life by taking over others temporarily, or mess around with his stupid roommates, or even just ditch his life altogether and just find someone else to be. But first, he needed to test it.</p>
<hr/><h3>
Who does Kyle test on?</h3>
