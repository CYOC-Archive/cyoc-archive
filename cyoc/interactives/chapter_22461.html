<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I was just finishing with the popcorn when my sister came into the kitchen.  She had changed and put on one of those spaghetti strap tank top shirts as well as a pair of boxers.  This was her comfort wear I guess.  But it sure did show off her full boobs.  Now, I'm not &quot;into&quot; my sister in any perverted way, but when anyone with a body like her's walks into a room, you would still look.  <br />
<br />
Anyway, she came up and grabbed the bowl of popcorn off the table.  <br />
<br />
&quot;I'm going to play the movie&quot;, she said.<br />
<br />
When she said it, she pretty much sprayed the word play.  I got a face full of spit, some in my eye as well.  I was used to this and didn't pay it much mind.  However, as I followed her out of the kitchen, I felt a wave of fatigue pass through my body.  I plopped on the couch and began to watch the opening credits of the movie, passing the bowl of popcorn between my sister and me.  <br />
<br />
About halfway through the movie, I got up and headed to my room.<br />
<br />
&quot;You feeling ok?&quot; my sister asked as I headed down the hall.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, just feeling really tired.  Must have been a pretty exhausting day.&quot;<br />
<br />
I got underneath my blankets after getting ready for bed, and passed out just as my head touched the pillow.<br />
***<br />
<br />
Hours later I woke up with a start.  I sat up straight in my bed breathing heavily.  As I calmed down from what must have been a bad dream, I began to take a look at myself and surroundings.  The clock said I had been in bed for 3 hours.  I felt warm and had broken out in a sweat.  I had felt a little nauseous and slightly dizzy.  I decided to head out and see if my sister was still up.<br />
<br />
I got up slowly and delicately.  I made my way out into the hallway.  Looking down its length, I saw the living room was dark and the t.v. was off.  She had already gone to bed.  I proceeded to the bathroom halfway down the hall to grab some Tylenol.  <br />
<br />
I flipped on the light and was blinded by the brightness.  Shielding my eyes, I opened the medicine cabinet and took out two pills.  I grabbed the cup by the sink and filled it with water.  Soon, I had those two painkillers traveling down to my stomach to hopefully ease my pain.  <br />
<br />
As I closed the cabinet, I caught a look of myself in the mirror.  I was pale and sweaty.  I looked very sick.  I felt my hands start to shake when I thought I noticed something different.  My eyes... no, it couldn't be.  But wait, yes, they were green.  For as long as I can remember, my eyes had always been brown, day in and day out.  However, there was no mistaking it that tonight, my eyes were indeed green in color.  I was concentrating so hard on my eyes that I almost missed something else.  Looking up, I noticed my hair looked shaggier than usual.  That was something I would need to take care of when I felt better.  But, as I continued to look at it, it seemed to get even shaggier.  Before long, there was no mistaking that my hair was visibly growing.  <br />
<br />
By this time, I was very freaked out.  Yet it seemed all I could do was continue to watch as my hair slowly covered up my ears and approached my neckline.  I had no idea what was going on.  I start to run my shaky hands through my growing locks of brown hair.  It was now long enough I could pull it in front of my face and look at it.  I was focusing on my hair when just beyond it, the mirror seemed to slide up the wall.  As I looked around the room, it seemed everything was slowly getting taller.  Looking down, I saw the ground was getting closer.  I let out a yelp.  My voice cracked as I did so, which reminded me of my years going through puberty.  Looking back at the mirror, I saw that it was no longer moving.  I took this to mean I had stopped shrinking.  I was able to gauge that I had lost about 7 inches from height of 6'2&quot;.  This made me about 5'6&quot;.  Taking a look at my hair again, I saw it had stopped growing at a length just passed my shoulders.  <br />
<br />
I looked at my eyes again, when I thought I saw my face change.  My cheekbones became more defined.  My skin seemed smoother, and my lips looked fuller.   Looking down at the rest of me, I saw the muscle I had worked so hard to build, was slowly deteriorating.  My hands, arms and legs became slender.  My waist was shrinking.  However, my hips seemed to be doing the opposite.  I could feel my shorts get tighter around the waistband.  Looking back, I saw my ass fill out.  I was definitely becoming very girlish in my figure.  However, it became official as I felt my manhood shrink away, and a warmth grow in my crotch.  Reaching down, I felt smoothness and folds of skin.  I was now female.  I screamed, but stopped short as I heard the cry of a girl escape my mouth.  I covered my mouth with my hands hoping to stop the sound from ever leaving again.  <br />
<br />
Thats when I felt tingling on my chest.  Pulling up my shirt, I looked down and saw that my nipples were a lot larger than normal.  The area around them was darker and larger as well.  However, I could barely believe it when I saw them being pushed out away from my chest forming two, distinguishable bumps.  These bumps grew bigger.  I could feel the weight increasing on my chest as they continued to swell.  I slid my hands over them and jumped as I felt and electric surge when my nipples were brushed.  I cupped my boobs, for thats what they were, and could feel them pressing against my hands as they continued to gain mass.  The weight was getting heavier when suddenly, the growth stopped.  I dropped my boobs and felt them tug at my chest.  They bounced and swayed slightly before coming to a rest.  Looking back at the mirror I saw a face a recognized all too well.  I let out a high pitched, feminine scream as I saw the face of my sister looking back at me in the mirror.</p>
