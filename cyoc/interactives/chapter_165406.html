<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Once the excitement of the swaps died down everyone was being shown to their rooms. All the rooms were sorted by family name, but luggage and other belongings were still  in every respective person&#39;s cars. <br />
<br />
This meant that both Dylan and Kenny were stuck in their sparse clothing for nearly half an hour before they were all dismissed from their tables. <br />
<br />
&quot;Uh... cousin Dylan... which car is your clothes in?&quot; Kenny asked. Dylan looked up to see the awkward uncertainty displayed on his own face. He could sympathize with the feeling. &quot;I&#39;ll show you, Kenny it&#39;s this one right over-&quot; Dylan hesitated. As he stepped outside amidst the crowd of people he found it hard to see over anyone&#39;s heads. &quot;Um... it&#39;s the dark blue truck. My bag should be in the backseat. Let me just find my dad, he should have the key,&quot; Dylan said looking around. <br />
<br />
&quot;Looking for me sport?&quot; came an unfamiliar voice from behind Dylan as he was scooped up over someone&#39;s head. He recognized his dad in his cousin&#39;s boyfriend&#39;s body. &quot;Drew! I mean dad! What are you doing?&quot; Dylan angrily squirmed, though it came out more like a wine with his younger voice. &quot;Ah come on Dylan. I feel so energized in this guy Drew&#39;s body and I haven&#39;t been able to pick you up like this since you were Kenny&#39;s age.&quot; <br />
<br />
Dylan gave another huff and said, &quot;Fine. Whatever. Can you unlock the car for Kenny so we can get my back from the truck?&quot; His father just laughed and said, &quot;Of course! Hey Kenny! How are you liking your body for the week? It&#39;s so strange having to look up to you now. Same for your dad. He&#39;s definitely enjoying his body. &quot; He gestured over to Uncle Frank who was showing off his new body, lifting two large suitcases in either hand. <br />
<br />
Kenny just looked down and uneasily positioned himself into a slouch. Despite that, he still stood head and shoulder&#39;s above Dylan&#39;s father. &quot;I&#39;m fine. Your body is really big cousin Dylan.&quot; A small blush could be seen on his face as they walked over to the truck. <br />
<br />
&quot;Uh... thanks, now let me just... Actually my bag is pretty heavy, do you mind carrying it Kenny?&quot;  Dylan asked. Kenny looked startled but slowly nodded. He opened the car door and climbed inside with ease. He emerged carrying a large duffel bag with all of Dylan&#39;s things. &quot;Your bag isn&#39;t heavy at all, wow...&quot; Kenny said in awe as he lifted the bag. He unintentionally flexed his arms as he did so, much to Dylan&#39;s frustration. <br />
<br />
Dylan&#39;s dad seemed unaware of this discomfort and began to walk off. &quot;Well it&#39;s about time to head to our rooms now. Kenny, you can just follow your dad to your new place and Dylan I&#39;ve already brought our new bags into our room.&quot;<br />
 <br />
&quot;Alright, bye.&quot; Kenny said as he awkwardly walked to meet his dad.  <br />
<br />
Once the two made their way to their room Dylan saw two bags on two beds. One was a backpack with a university logo on it, the other was a colorful Aquaman themed luggage. &quot;Well I guess this one&#39;s mine,&quot; Dylan pointed to the colorful bag. &quot;Now would you mind putting me down?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh sorry son, I forgot you were there!&quot; His father set him down on the bed. Dylan realized his feet dangled off the bed easily, just another reminder of his predicament.  Shaking it off he quickly opened the luggage got dressed in a black batman t-shirt and some beige shorts. At the bottom of the suitcase was a set of comics.<br />
<br />
Instinctively Dylan reached for his pocket for his cellphone and then remembered he&#39;d left it in his pants pre change.  &quot;Uh... dad. i left my phone in my pocket before I changed. Where do they put the clothes from bathroom after we&#39;ve swapped?&quot;<br />
<br />
His dad scratched his head. &quot;Oh! I think they deliver it to the rooms of the bodies. Kenny and Frank probably have it. Their room is labeled Noah for their last name. Should be at the start of the hall.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks dad I&#39;ll be right back.&quot; Dylan jumped off the bed with a light thump. He looked back at the luggage and then grabbed some of the comics. &quot;He&#39;ll probably want these back,&quot; Dylan though as he walked down the hall. <br />
<br />
It was such a strange sensation to see all his family from this perspective. Everyone towered over him. But of course they would. Kenny couldn&#39;t be taller than 4 feet. A huge departure from his 6&#39;5 frame, not to mention about 150 lbs lighter. As he walked down the hall, he recognize his Uncle Bill  who was about 35. He was a lean bearded man with a bit of a beer bellied frame, but Dylan had to remind himself it wasn&#39;t Bill. It was actually his cousin Andrew. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Dylan!&quot; He said enthusiastically. It was a little odd seeing  &quot;I heard you had a great season this last year. Sorry I couldn&#39;t make any of your games. We have to catch up sometime and uh. Are you doing some reading?&quot; Andrew was gesturing to the comics, which made Dylan immediately get red faced. <br />
<br />
&quot;No! I mean, these are Kenny&#39;s I was gonna give them back to him since he left it in his luggage. He&#39;s also got my phone.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, that makes sense. Well, I know it&#39;s getting late so I&#39;ll let you get to it. Just text me if you want to talk afterwards!&quot;<br />
<br />
Dylan just nodded as he walked off. The sounds of Andrew talking to his boyfriend drew from inside echoed down the hall. <br />
He immediately realize how self conscious all of this was making him. Sure he was a bit cocky in his daily life. What sort of varsity football playing senior wouldn&#39;t be. But his dad was right. This experience really would provide some humility whether he wanted to or not. <br />
<br />
Once Dylan  reached the door, he heard some groans, like someone was pushing something or lifting something heavy. He didn&#39;t know what to make of this so he just knocked.  Heavy footsteps approached and Dylan was immediately facing his own chest. <br />
<br />
&quot;Where- oh hey Dylan! What are you doing here?&quot; Kenny asked, he was panting and his arms seemed pumped like he&#39;d just finished a workout. <br />
<br />
&quot;I... I was. Um. Here&quot; He holds up the comics. &quot;I also think they brought my cellphone here, do you have it?&quot;<br />
<br />
Kenny looks at the comics and says, &quot;Oh! I forgot about these, thanks Dylan.&quot; He steps aside and he could see a small table between the two beds inside. On the one end was his Uncle Frank, who was shirtless and still in the body of Oscar his cousin Rose&#39;s buff Mexican boyfriend. <br />
<br />
&quot;Dylan my boy! Enjoying my son&#39;s body? He&#39;s sure enjoying yours. He just beat me at an arm wrestle! No wonder you&#39;ve got that full ride for college.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah! You wouldn&#39;t believe it. Dad&#39;s body is really big, but so is mine and so when he said we should try doing an arm wrestle thingy I won!&quot; Kenny beamed with pride, and whether or not it was intentional, gave a cocky smirk. <br />
<br />
The rant was cut short as a series of buzzing could be heard. &quot;Oh, I guess I didn&#39;t realize your phone had been buzzing. Here you go,&quot; Kenny said handing Dylan his phone. Once again Dylan was shocked at hos big it looked in his hands. The next thing that shocked him was all of his text messages from his boyfriend.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh shit,&quot; he said, forgetting where he was. Kenny gasped and Frank just shook his head. &quot;Hey Dylan. I&#39;d appreciate if you didn&#39;t swear around my kid, especially when you&#39;re using his body.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry,&quot; Dylan said, already taking a step back. I&#39;ve just got a lot of missed messages. Have a good night.&quot; With that he ran off.<br />
<br />
He unlocked his phone and began scrolling down the long list of messages.<br />
&quot;Did you get  to the cabin ok?&quot;<br />
&quot;How&#39;s dinner? Mine is lame, wish I could&#39;ve come.&quot;<br />
&quot;Come on Dylan, don&#39;t ignore me.&quot;<br />
&quot;Hey I&#39;m sure you&#39;re busy with family, so I&#39;ll text back later.&quot;<br />
&quot;WHY ARE THERE IMAGES OF YOU IN YOUR JOCKSTRAP?&quot;<br />
&quot;Dude call me back, this is so weird.&quot;<br />
<br />
These were just a few and he had no idea what to do. Blake was his longtime boyfriend. They were a bit of a stereotype. Dylan being the hot shot football player. Blake being co captain of the cheer team. He could be a bit clingy, especially when Dylan leaves on a family trip that he had to make a dozen excuses for him not to attend. Now he was in an awkward position where he couldn&#39;t really explain what had happened.<br />
<br />
He just slunked back to his room, climbed on to the bed, and stared at the ceiling. It was going to be a long week.</p>
