<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Your vision remains largely uncoordinated, not used to the slanted perspective of your newly placed eyes. Still reeling than the fact that your girlfriend failed to find your lack of a face anything but normal. Your facial holes failed to respond correctly to your emotional state. What used to be your nose, is now a copy of your girlfriends tight and sweet pussy, and your mouth now her tight pink butthole. Not to mention one of your hands is now a replica of what you assumed was her right foot. You&#39;re a bit of a mess, both mentally and physically as well as figuratively. <br />
<br />
You need to fix this, for your own sake at least. with your only useful hand you search through the drawer again, hoping to find something that would restore your face to some semblance of normalcy. You can hear your girlfriend rummaging around your kitchen fixing some snacks for both of you. You dont want to find out how eating would work for you in this newly configured reality where your mouth is now a feminine anus. <br />
<br />
Your rummaging has mussed up any neatly folded clothes and garments and whatever method of organization you had previously, and your slanted line of sight is causing you to have difficulty discerning your items from your partners. Your girlfriend was a bit of a tomboy so it&#39;s hard to tell which of the clothes were yours and hers by touch alone. She only owned a few pairs of noticeably feminine attire, knowing full well to stay away from them. You could hear your girlfriend calling you from the kitchen and hurried your searching.<br />
<br />
Opening the bottom drawer you searched for anything else, you distinctly remembered putting a couple of your old halloween costume odds and ends in the last drawer. Maybe there was something like a mask to put over your face to restore you to some semblance of normalcy.<br />
<br />
Bending down made you a bit dizzy your perspective being way off with your eyes being the way they were, and your lack of breathing managed to bring you some small anxiety even though you seemed physically fine. The act of &quot;not&quot; breathing felt wrong, not to mention the other feelings your new parts generated. With his only hand he felt something familiar, his facial anus tightening in triumph. <br />
<br />
He remembered he put in last years Halloween costume, when he and his girlfriend went to their friends costume party. He had gone had gone as a luchadore, a masked mexican wrestler. The mask he bought was made out of a stretchy latex fabric but was also a bit too tight on the top of the head and loose near the mouth. He remembered the feel of the mask since he wore it nearly the entire day to stretch it out.  He could hear his girlfriends footsteps down the hall and hastily pulled out the latex fabric and using the toes of his right &quot;hand&quot; and fumbling with his normal hand he found the bottom of the mask and pulled it over his head. <br />
<br />
Immediately his world went dark once again and he felt disorientated and as if his entire head had swollen up like a balloon. He couldn&#39;t see again and wondered if he had somehow put the mask on backwards since his head felt wrong and slightly top heavy.  He heard his girlfriend approaching faster and struggled to find the glasses from earlier. <br />
<br />
He found them on top of the dresser and quickly put them up to where he imagined to be his eye level, even if his eyes would be on the back of his head it would be better than being blind. Hoping that whatever magic would work through the fabric as well. However when he pressed the glasses to where he thought his ears, nose and eyes would be he encountered an obstacle. A rather familiar and well rounded obstacle that he remembered intimately. He remembered loving to slap and fondle and grope his girlfriends beautifully firm ass cheeks. While she was no slouch in the breast department his girlfriends most defining aspect was her delicious and well toned ass. Like two firm bouncy globes of flesh that looked amazing in practically anything she wore. <br />
<br />
&quot;Matt...what&#39;s wrong, I&#39;ve been calling you for ages...We were gonna watch horror movies together&quot; Your girlfriend pleaded, she sauntered through the door. You were still in the dark, fearing that you had screwed up royally again. You stood there with your hands groping your new face. A wide expanse of a wonderfully built womanly backside now attached atop your shoulders. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh...I see, that seems fun....and those are mine you butt head....what made you think you could wear my she hulk shorts on your face anyway&quot; She giggled. You mentally berated yourself. Of course, She had gone as she hulk to your masked wrestler and of course her costume was made out of similar material. You were cut short from your reminiscing by pair of dainty hands groping your new facial backside. They reached up slipped the garment from your face with ease. A flood of light cascaded into your view and saw into your girlfriends smiling face.  She dangled the garment away from your &quot;face&quot; while laughing seeing that you had somehow managed to fit your entire head into where the crotch of the zipper meets the waist, the fabric was torn and nearly shredded. You turned around to face the mirror on your nightstand dresser, causing and intense jiggling sensation to go throughout your &quot;face&quot; and  was shocked at what you saw. <br />
<br />
Looking back at you above your male shoulders was the perfect female backside, large luscious butt cheeks with a slight tan and flawless hairless smooth skin. And in between those tight cheeks where your eyes situated above a copy of your girlfriends tight pink sphincter. Below the anus that had taken up residence of your nose, was a raised mound containing the familiar sight of your girlfriends pussy, upside down. with her clitoris perched where the tip of your chin would be. The effect looked as if you were staring her ass directly from behind. A glorious sight if it weren&#39;t attached to his shoulders instead. <br />
<br />
&quot;Matt, come on, quit playing around. Lets get some beer and snacks and watch some bad horror movies&quot; Your girlfriend insisted. Dragging you away with one arm and leading you down the hall. You reeled in shock disbelief, falling limply in step behind your girlfriend. Your &quot;cheeks&quot; wobbling slightly with every step. She would glance back every now and then and show nothing but a playful smile and nothing about the ass on his shoulders. <br />
<br />
Matt didnt even remember sitting down on the living room couch, so shocked as he was and his girlfriend sliding next to him and cuddling into his side. She had a bowl and two bottles of beer with her while she snuggled closer to his lap. She looked him deeply in his eyes with a smirk, a wry smile tugging at her lips. Holding up the bowl in her hands showing popcorn and candy.<br />
<br />
&quot;I got your favorite movie time snack honey!&quot;  She held up two bars of butterfingers in her hand and a large bottle of beer. &quot;Come on...lets get good and sloshed baby!&quot; She said before nearly shoving a bottle of beer into his hands and deftly shoving the butterfinger quickly between his upside down pussy lips. Surprised, shocked, scared and an assortmant of alien sensations assaulted his brain as he struggled to accept what had just happened. <br />
<br />
The pussy that replaced his mouth could still taste, and he had retained some amount of motor control over it somehow. Lacking a tongue or teeth however it&#39;s muscle control was far more advanced than what he assumed a normal vagina would have. His girlfrined smiled as she wolfed down some popcorn and Matt &quot;chewed&quot; on his candy bar. The taste of the chocolate combined with the foreign stimulation of having a newly formed pussy being penatrated concentrated directly on his face set his &quot;mouth&quot; into overdrive. The candy bar had hit the back of what he assumed would be his throat. The bar had reached a point where it had left the cleft of his pussy lips but was now tightly surrounded by the inner walls of his facial cunt. However it had reached it&#39;s apex, stopping midpoint in his throat and not going any further. The sensation was surreal, it felt like something was stuck within his throat like he was choking on something. However he had no difficulty breathing...since he still wasnt even breathing to begin with. It was an wholly unwelcome sensation however and he was afraid to reach within his &quot;mouth&quot; to pull the bar out since it had no where else to go.<br />
<br />
&quot;Matt really? do you always gotta do this...I swear it&#39;s like you&#39;re a big baby....fine if you want to be hand fed...of course I&#39;ll do it for you&quot; She giggled and got up on her knees on the couch. Leaning over you, she smiled and reached forward towards your chin and began to fiddle with the clit that protruded from it. Immediately you could feel your mouth watering in an entirely new way. A heat began to build inside your throat and you could feel waves of newly discovered pleasure crawling directly into your brain. You were surprised at how fast she had managed to get you going, but maybe she knew more about your new parts since they were direct copies of her own. fluids dribbled down your neck and onto your chest. <br />
<br />
You threw your head back and would have moaned loudly had you still been capable of doing so and braced yourself as you felt yourself reaching a peak. The candy bar inside your mouth began to melt as your heated insides drooled lubricant all over it, increasing the flavor of the chocolate and coating the entire insides of your new pussy mouth. Your girlfriend bent above you and give you a big kiss right on your new nether lips, making sure to lick up at your &quot;saliva&quot; with gusto...trailing down your enflamed pussy mound as it throbbed on the precipice of climax, with a slow lick she trailed down to your chin and gave a gently yet firm tug at your clitoris.<br />
<br />
The resounding climax had literally blown your mind, You trembled on the couch as waves of pleasure washed over you and the sensation of the half melted candy bar began a slow agonizingly pleasurable journey down your throat, it&#39;s passage causing shock-waves with every inch it squirmed down your gullet. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ready for the next one sweety!&quot; Your girlfiend bellowed cheerfully waving the second candy bar in hand suggestively.</p>
