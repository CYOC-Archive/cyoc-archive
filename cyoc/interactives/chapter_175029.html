<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Hope you enjoy </div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jennifer knelt their for a moment taking in her situation, the taste of cum in the back of her throat, blotches of spill over cum soaking through her white top the horrific gazes cast upon her. Realising that her plan had backfired she didn’t know what else to do as tears swelled in her eyes. Rushing to the bathroom across the hallway and pushing past the crowd which had been whispering behind her back she ran into the nearest stall sobbing. <br />
<br />
rummaging through her memories Jennifer’s mind felt muddled and disjointed, she could just about tell the real ones from the fake ones but it was getting harder, she knew for certain that she hadn’t slept with all the football team but to say she was certain she slept with a couple. Maybe 3 at most? Or had she? <br />
<br />
Deciding it did not matter for now Jennifer wiped her face and left the stall, hearing soft voices Jennifer could make out the sounds of a couple of cheerleaders she knew, Sarah and Jessica.  Unsure what her relationship was to them now she tried to go un noticed but as soon as the bathrooms door creaked loudly she was instantly detected. <br />
<br />
rearing her head, the two cheerleaders turned, and Sarah left one snapped out <br />
“Oh Look who it is, the town whore, rubbing a quick one out before class are we you disgusting slut?  Putting extra empathises on the whore and slut which burned Jennifer a bit. Already her reputation was in tatters it seemed. <br />
<br />
“I just want to be left alone okay! “Jennifer barked back, while heading for the exit deciding that it would be best to just leave. <br />
<br />
“ Yeah well you should of considered that before you slept with my boyfriend, he may be a dumb enough to fall for your classless act now you skank but eventually you’ll be nothing but a drugged up ugly looking whore like the rest of them” <br />
<br />
Catching herself for a moment Jennifer winced at that, this girl used to be her friend, someone she had known since childhood and to hear that just broke any confidence she had left. Turning to her friend with tears streaming down her face she opened her mouth only to turn and run out the door. <br />
Deciding that school was becoming too much of a problem she ran out of the building the hall monitor shouting after her as she breezed by him and the guard. <br />
<br />
Racing off the school grounds she just kept running. Why did the curse have to be so cruel, did I really deserve all this she thought? After a half mile her pace started slowing down, occasionally turning her head around to make sure no one was after her she lowered her pace to a brisk walk. Taking note of the fact that her skirt had ridden up considerably and that she was lucky their hadn’t been any passers-by which would of  had a sparkling view of her behind.  <br />
<br />
Deciding to just head home, Jennifer gritted her teeth and let out a sigh realising it would be quite a walk back without any cash. The long walk did have its benefits though, it gave Jennifer time to think. If she could moderate the amount, she “sells” herself maybe she can find a balance to keep her family afloat, Hoping that if she could have only 1 client a week or a month then she could stomach that. It wouldn’t be ideal, but she could work privately, get educated online, buy a cat if she wanted company. <br />
Reassuring herself, she picked up the pace a little, feeling a bit more optimistic. Turning a few  <br />
corners Jennifer gasped for a second as she noticed she was on the same street as her dreams. She could see a few scantily clad women loitering around and smoking outside a shop with broken windows. She guessed that was the local hangout for prostitutes during the day?  Deciding to steer clear of it she maneuvered to the other side of the road, catching the occasional stare at her by the women across the street.  Feeling a little self-conscious over her current wardrobe she hurried up the pace when she noticed a car slowing down beside her.  The window slowly rolling down to reveal a burly looking man with balding grey hair. <br />
<br />
“Hey luv, what’s a gorgeous babe like you doing eer? “ The man said with a smile revealing a few missing teeth. <br />
<br />
“I.. I.. I’m just trying to get home she stammered out  “ Unsure how to  answer, being caught of guard. Its not like she could say the truth. <br />
<br />
“Oh well is it that waay “ he said pointing forward, sluring his words.  <br />
<br />
“Uh yeah more or less, its near bexly, past the roundabout on 32nd street. “<br />
<br />
“eeh, that one, Yah I can take ye thar get in. “ He gestured, opening the side door. <br />
<br />
Jennifer felt stuck, her feet had been aching for a while now and she wasn’t even half way, yet she knew this man spelled trouble. Deciding to take a chance she carefully got in, making sure to be careful with her mini skirt. The car smelled quite bad she noticed too , seeing junk food cartons and cans littering the back. The man looked almost homeless with minor holes in his clothing. <br />
<br />
Revving up the car the man pulled away from the curb and drove for a few blocks, Jennifer sighed a breath of relief until she felt the car slow down and turn into an alleyway.  Feeling nervous Jennifer turned to the man<br />
<br />
“What are you doing? Why are we stopping?” she said nervously. <br />
<br />
“Well I thought tis all that you pay me for ma gentalmenly servace “ he said the lack of teeth very evident with his speech, unbuckling his belt he pulled out his cock. <br />
<br />
Being reminded of the time with jake and some of the implanted memories, Jennifer sighed, If she didn’t charge him anything maybe she could avoid the worst of it she thought. Her brain fluttering at  seeing his member spring free, the man motioned at her. A tense moment filled the air for a moment as they stared at each other before Jennifer looked away and down at his cock. Its veiny throbbing head , it had to be 8 inches. <br />
<br />
Taking a deep breath Jennifer lowered her head down after pulling her hair into a ponytail. Opening her mouth she took it in, closing her eyes and just focusing on getting it over with as soon as possible, Jennifer just let her jaw muscles move naturally. Her tongue licking the shaft and the tip at just the right moments and in just the right way. <br />
<br />
The man was ecstatic, his face scrunched up in overwhelming pleasure as he had never received a blowjob like this before. Waves building up in him came crashing down as he unloaded his seed. <br />
Jennifer was caught a little surprised by the.. volume of cum that got shot down her throat, she pulled back a little trying to not to leak any out of her mouth but it was just too much as he pulled her head off and it continued to spray in her face and all down her top. <br />
<br />
“I always luv it when a bird lets me cum on their face and tits” he said with a laugh as he put away his cock. Jennifer again sat their stunned, she had no tissues, and this was everywhere. <br />
<br />
starting the car again the man pulled the car out of the alley way, the shaking of the car was causing the rivets of cum semen rolled down the exposed skin of her breasts, some of the semen on her face was falling onto her already soaked top, the upper half nearly fully soaked at this point. It had  coated hair that was stuck to her colourless cheeks. Feeling anger well up inside her, Jennifer turned around facing away from the man, replaying the event in her mind repeatedly like before with kyle.  Each time the frustrating was mounting. Like a growing inferno in  a dry Forrest. Furrowing her brow Jennifer just shouted<br />
<br />
“ YOU COULD HAVE SAID YOU WAS GOING TO CUM ON THE FACE YOU FUCK”  turning to face the man once more with hatred in her eyes. <br />
<br />
The man turned his head. <br />
“ I don’t take kindly to being spoken to like that “ He said calmy, turning his head he reached for the glove compartment and forced it open and pulled out an old looking rag.<br />
<br />
“Here wipe ya self of with that”  he said tossing it at her. <br />
<br />
Jennifer quickly analysed the Rag and realised it must have been his cum rag or something because it was crusty and a dirty. Using the dry cleaner bits Jen quicky got to work and dried her face a little. Staying silent the whole time. She wanted nothing more than to tear this guys head off but she didn’t want to risk being thrown out of the car…<br />
<br />
enough time passed that the sun was beginning to set as the car slowed down once more in  a rough looking neighbourhood, unused buildings and graffiti everywhere, it was a step up from being homeless.. but barely. <br />
<br />
“ Here we are” he said, pulling out a cigarette<br />
<br />
“Oh were are my mannors, want one? Of course you do, make ya feel bettar “ he said, forcefully handing one to her<br />
<br />
Lighting up his own he exhaled smoke in her direction smiling at her as he lit hers too. <br />
<br />
“Consider it payment I guess ha” <br />
Taking a light drag Jen pulled back as she coughed. Something felt off, As soon as he said that Jen felt a ripple spread throughout her, realising having accepted his payment must of triggered the curse.<br />
<br />
Memories of having always been a smoker filled her mind as the burning sensation in the back of her throat dulled and the warm feeling of nicotine entered her addicted brain.  Instinctively taking another toke she opened the door and graceful swept her legs aside and stood up, feeling a hard pinch through her leather skirt as she got up. <br />
“ Thought I’d get a quick pinch before leaving ya, please let me know if you find yourself needing a lift again “ he said pulling the door closed. <br />
<br />
“Uh.. yeah.. uhm.. thanks.. “ Was all Jennifer could muster holding back the joy of being outside and not contained in that tin box with that smelly man any longer.<br />
Waiting until the car had turned the corner and was out of sight, Jennifer crossed over a few streets and continued walking home. Haven given him slightly off address so he would know where she lived but close enough to get to in a few minutes. <br />
<br />
Looking up at the red stricken sky with the underbelly of the clouds being lit up by the setting sun in the distance Jennifer took in a final deep breath. Unsure what her parents would think of her now she decided to just push on through as she approached the wooden porch door. Unlocking the double bolt and crossing the threshold she called out to her parents. <br />
<br />
“H..Hello Mum? Dad? “  she cried, as she walked inside inspecting the living room, it was quite a bit more furnished than when they moved in the other day, maybe the aspect of her family getting better off was true she thought. <br />
<br />
Kicking off her sneakers, Jennifer went to head upstairs when she heard a loud slam of an upstairs door opening followed by footsteps. Readying herself for either her mum or dad to appear. <br />
<br />
“Jennifer is that you? “ her mother called out before turning to face her daughter, quickly raising a hand to her mouth in shock at the state of her daughter. Covered in dry semen and wearing scantily clad clothing, she reeked of sex. <br />
<br />
“I got a call from the school office saying you ran out of school after getting into a fight, WHAT the hell happened!?” she yelled as her soft demeaning tone changed to charged anger towards her daughter. <br />
<br />
“I.. I “Jennifer was lost for words, not sure where to begin, clenching her fists she looked down at the floor and then back to her mothers daunting gaze. <br />
<br />
“I ran out of school because everyone kept calling me a whore and a slut and I.. I just couldn’t take it mom, I then walked home and someone offered me a ride... he demanded I blow him and I just did… “ She said as she broke down into tears in front of her mother, falling to her knees. <br />
<br />
Her mother’s expression buckled slightly, her frown lessening before taking a breath. “my lord, I didn’t want to believe it. The rumours that you have been sleeping around instead of going to school, cousin Tereasa told me. She mentioned how she saw you last week prancing around after men and getting into strangers cars. “Changing her tone, Jennifer began to worry as her mother’s expression and eyes lit up in anger once again. <br />
<br />
“But you know the rules, we are a religious family, we do not condone prostitution or adultery, some of these men were married I bet! No.. you’ve gone too far, skipping school, sleeping around, lying to me… Please just … Pack your bags… “ she yelled, as tears welled up in her eyes too, in her mind she was just trying to do what she thought was best, and maybe if her daughter experienced destitution she’d realise her ways. <br />
<br />
“ But MUM ITS not that simple. I was Cur….. “ she said, before collapsing in pain as a shooting sensation was felt around her midsection. Getting up after a moment<br />
<br />
“I meant to say I was Cur…” once more she failed to finish her sentence as she fell to the ground. Why now she thought, why can’t she tell her mom about the curse. WHY!!! She screamed to herself. <br />
<br />
“Please don’t make this harder than it has to be “ Her mother said, pulling a suitcase down from the shelf of a cupboard. <br />
<br />
“You can use this, pack your clothing, I’ll go get you some money, you can go to a hotel for a couple of days… and figure out the rest on your own.  She said in between sobs. <br />
Jennifer was aghast, never had she thought she would end up in this situation. Feeling a sense of hopelessness and despair she could hear her mother rummaging in her closet for clothes to take away.  Still kneeling their Jennifer reluctantly got up to her feet and timidly walked into her room, maybe she could at least change she thought. <br />
<br />
Her mother had almost emptied her wardrobe, but she noticed the articles of clothing packed were mainly miniskirts, halter tops, crop tops, some mini dresses and an assortment of clubbing like clothing but what really caught her eye was the white crop top and leather skirt that she saw in her dreams and appeared in her closet. Moving that thought aside she wondered what happened to her jeans and vests as she rummaged in the closet. <br />
<br />
“You know, I should of seen it, you only wear those provocative trashy clothes “ her mother said with a sneer. <br />
“What do you mean? I always like to lounge in jeans and a hoodie?” Jenner retorted, checking her memories, had the curse messed with her dress sense too? <br />
<br />
“ Yeah maybe when you were 12 or 13 but ever since you hit puberty it was a constant battle to get you into anything that wasn’t skin tight or hid too much skin. I mean for god sake Jennifer look at what you’re wearing now” her mother replied, still a little shaken but obviously wanting to hurry this along. <br />
<br />
She wasn’t wrong, Jennifer could remember vague memories now of spending most of her early puperty days basting in the glow of attention and she had no problem wearing scandalous skirts with baring midriffs, pushing the boundaries of how much skin she could show without getting in trouble at home or at school.  Shaking her head slightly Jennifer knew she could do nothing about it now and just hurried up packing her stuff, deciding she can always buy new clothes. Picking up a grey top that read “xs” she sighed, as she swapped it for her pre-existing top, she could feel it came down to just below her breasts. It was a little tighter around her chest too as her nipples could be seen extruding from her teardrop breasts. <br />
<br />
After receiving some money from her mom she struggled to carry her suitcase downstairs, a pained expression on her face as she descended in silence. Her mother retiring to the bedroom yelling. <br />
<br />
“Don’t forget to shut the door. Goodbye” She yelled, not even giving Jennifer the courtesy of a real goodbye. <br />
<br />
Going to put her shoes on, Jennifer took a double take, realising her sneakers had been replaced with a pair of 5-inch heels, with the clasp recently unlocked and ready to be slipped on.  Confused for a moment, Jennifer quickly double checked before relenting figuring that it was expected at this point that the curse was changing reality to fit her reputation so apparently, she only owned heels.<br />
<br />
. Awkwardly slipping on the heels, they felt natural, she had no issue walking in them, as if she had years of experience.  Going to the door Jen readied herself, mentally looking back one last time. The house had changed a bit, painted walls that had been peeling looked recently painted, furniture was a little better looking than when she left this morning, and the place did feel a little more modern. Seems the part about her family getting better off was right she thought before leaving. <br />
<br />
Stepping outside the sun had recently set behind the horizon and the red afterglow filled the sky, with little daylight remaining Jennifer realised how vulnerable she was right now and decided her best bet was too.</p>
