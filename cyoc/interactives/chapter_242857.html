<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was hard for her to accept the bat was someone named Diana. But, knowing what little she knew about the Chronivac, and what she&#39;d hoped it could do for her, Jennifer considered she wouldn&#39;t have been surprised if they were who they claimed. Curious, she headed for the upstairs bathroom. There, she stripped off her clothes, tossed them in the hamper, and doing her best to ignore her cock and balls, she pulled on a pair of panties, made sure everything was tucked back, then put on the pyjama bottoms and top.<br />
<br />
Dressed, she didn&#39;t head downstairs right away. Wondering what she ought to tell her mother, she stood in the hall and worked her hair out of the shirt. Knowing she couldn&#39;t tell her mom there was large talking bat in her room who claimed to at one time be a human girl named Diana, Jennifer settled for something simple as she headed downstairs.<br />
<br />
Her mother in the living room, Jennifer stopped in the doorway as Mrs Grace asked her, &quot;Ready for the movie?&quot;<br />
<br />
Aware it was still too early for her to go to bed, yet, not caring, Jennifer adopted a looked of being tired. As she did this, she said, &quot;If it&#39;s all right, I think I&#39;ll just go to bed.&quot;<br />
<br />
Concerned, Mrs Grace replied, &quot;Are you sure, sweety?&quot; to which Jennifer affirmed she was, and after kissing and hugging her mother goodnight, promising they&#39;d do something together tomorrow, she muttered, &quot;I&#39;m going to get a drink of water,&quot; before leaving the room and heading for the kitchen.<br />
<br />
There, not sure what Diana would like to eat, Jennifer collected a couple bananas, some apples, a pear, and after some consideration, an orange. Heading back upstairs to her room, she didn&#39;t know what to do with the food, and so put it all on the floor after she&#39;d entered. From where she lay on the bed, Diana could smell the various things her friend had brought with her, and squeaking out, &quot;Fruit!&quot; she hopped and scrabbled off the bed and towards the various things.<br />
<br />
As the bat began to work on one of the bananas, eating it peel and all, Jennifer sat down on her bed. Still curious about her guest, and not the least bit frightened, she wondered how much she ought to tell them. Watching as they finished the banana and set to work on the pear, Jennifer slid off the bed. Sitting on the floor cross-legged, not caring if anything could be seen, though she would&#39;ve been surprised how nothing could, she asked, &quot;So, you say your name is Diana, you were at the sleep over, and you knew all of us before you used the Chronivac to become what you are?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yup,&quot; Diana answered after she&#39;d swallowed a mouthful of fruit, and setting it aside, she turned her attention to her host. Thinking it over, she wondered how to convince this girl she was who she said she was, Diana sighed and started with, &quot;For reasons I cannot understand, the Chronivac didn&#39;t include you in the awareness of my existence. Maybe you were too far away. Maybe there was other factors I didn&#39;t count on,&quot; and moving on from this, Diana explained what she knew of Jennifer, how they&#39;d become friends a couple days ago, and how it was Diana who&#39;d introduced Jennifer to everyone else, and finished with her concerns about Jennifer&#39;s sudden departure.<br />
<br />
&quot;Which brought me to this, very confusing, point,&quot; she ended before going back to working on the pear she&#39;d been eating.<br />
<br />
There were gaps in her memory, and in Diana&#39;s story, Jennifer couldn&#39;t explain. Up until a couple days ago, she hadn&#39;t had any friends since moving. But then she&#39;d been invited to a sleep over. Who invited her, Jennifer suddenly couldn&#39;t say, and for some reason wanted to say it was Felicity, even though she was sure she&#39;d never met the other girl until today. Trying to sort everything out, watching as Diana finished the pear and started on the apple, Jennifer wanted to trust her, but found she couldn&#39;t be sure. Thinking of ways to test her, she thought there was only one sure way to. Clearing her throat, waiting until she had the bat&#39;s attention, she whispered, &quot;There&#39;s, things, about me, I never tell anyone. I keep to myself.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sensing the girl was about to let her in on something important, Diana set aside her meal. Listening as Jennifer explained, &quot;I am not who everyone thinks I am. Yet, at the same time, I am,&#39; then sighed, &quot;It&#39;s all so confusing,&quot; Diana inched forward and consoled her with, &quot;I&#39;m sure, whatever it is, it&#39;s fine.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, it&#39;s not,&quot; Jennifer hissed and looking at Diana, she stated, &quot;Do you want to know why Ginny asked me to leave? To never talk with Lucy, or any of the others, every again. Threatened my mom with the authorities?&quot; and before Diana could reply, she rushed out how she&#39;d been born a boy, was called Daniel, and, at age six, came out as Jennifer, then began to live as her, slowly transitioning to becoming a girl, and finishing by standing and stating, &quot;And if you don&#39;t believe me,&quot; she hooked her thumbs inside the waistband of her pyjama bottoms and underwear and pushing down far enough for her to spread her legs and reveal what she had tucked back.<br />
<br />
Of all the things Diana expected, the realisation Jennifer was a boy wasn&#39;t one of them. Conflicted, her first gut reaction was to go with how Ginny had reacted, how Diana was sure her parents would behave. But then she checked herself as she considered her own experiences, how other might perceive what Jennifer did as lying, and in the end, decided she didn&#39;t care. Jennifer, to Diana&#39;s way of seeing it, was a girl, no matter who&#39;d she&#39;d been born as, what she had between her legs. Returning to the fruit, Diana devoured another banana as Jennifer tucked her penis and testicles back, pulled up her panties, arranged them so you could hardly tell anything was there which wasn&#39;t meant to be, then did the same with her pyjama bottoms.<br />
<br />
After Diana was done eating, and Jennifer was redressed, they each looked at each other. Searching for something to say, it was Diana who offered, &quot;If there was some way I could do it, if I could use the Chronivac to make you fully female, who this be something you&#39;d want?&quot;<br />
<br />
Reality having altered so much she was unable to recall any longer it was her choice to become who she now was, Jennifer grinned at the suggestion. It was, at the moment, all she hoped, dreamed, and longed for. Wanting to hug Diana, but unsure how, she told her, &quot;Thank you,&quot; before asking, &quot;But, how.&quot;<br />
<br />
Diana thinking about it, offered after some time, &quot;What about the remote thing? The one hooked up to the computer. Maybe we could use it to make you a girl fully?&quot;<br />
<br />
She couldn&#39;t remember if there had been anything connected to the computer, besides the usual mouse and keyboard. Hoping Diana was right, Jennifer replied, &quot;Maybe?&quot; then, &quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; before asking, &quot;But, what about you. You&#39;re going to transform back to who you say were before coming to see me.&quot;<br />
<br />
With as much as a grin as she could manage, Diana chirped out, &quot;As much fun as it is being a bat, I have no intention of staying this way. I&#39;ll probably head back soon and either figure out a way to undo what I did, or see if I can get the others to help me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You aren&#39;t going to tell them about my secret, are you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I figure this is a choice for you to decide who you tell, and who you don&#39;t.&quot;<br />
<br />
This settling the matter, Diana and Jennifer lapsed into silence. Jennifer, hoping Diana could do as she said she would, almost felt a part of her holding back, as if this was all too good to be true. Diana, looking up at the other girl, wanted nothing but for her to be happy. Thinking using the Chronivac was the best option, she figured the first thing she ought to do was make herself human again. Turning toward the window, she sighed, &quot;I suppose I should be getting back,&quot; and glancing at Jennifer, she said, &quot;No matter what happens, I&#39;m still your friend. And no one is going to tell me otherwise.&quot;<br />
<br />
Happy to hear this, Jennifer wanted to again hug the bat. Petting her instead, she then watched as Diana spread her wings and flapped across the room, then climbed up to the open window. The two looking at each other, Jennifer smiled and said, &quot;See you later.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She really is a pretty girl. It&#39;s sad others cannot see, or accept, this,&quot; Diana thought as she saw this, and twitching a wing in an attempt to wave goodbye, she squeaked out, &quot;See you,&quot; before edging out the window. Climbing up the side of the house, she breathed in the night air and pushing off, she took a moment to just flit about before starting back to Lucy&#39;s wondering what the other would say when she explained what she&#39;d done.</p>
