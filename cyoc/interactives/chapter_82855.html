<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">John was snuggling on their sofa with minotaur Brian, who was now clean and smelled like Irish Spring. He shivered as Brian gently ran his furry hand over John's now massive package. It was an odd sight: a minotaur, furry legs hanging off the end of the sofa, with a naked human, previously an orc, laying in front of him. Brian kissed the back of John's neck again, his large member poking at John's back door. John snuggled in tighter with Brian, listening to his stomach gurgle. Cheese apparently didn't agree with large mythical beasts. The lovers laid there, enjoying a quiet moment, watching Wheel of Fortune.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't buy a vowel, you dumbass! You know the answer!&quot; Brian shouted at the TV.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't think he can hear you,&quot; John said.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's so obvious. It's 'DUMPSTER GIRLS'.&quot; Brian said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Funny, I thought it was 'COMPUTER VIRUS'.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, you're terrible at this game.&quot; Brian said with his deep, rough voice. His sexy voice, along with the stroking of John's genitals, caused John to start to get hard again. Flipping over on top of Brian, John surged forward towards Brian and kissed him, forcing his tongue into his long snout. He thrusted his body, rubbing his growing cock through Brian's rough fur. John moaned as Brian began to penetrate his ass with his thick hoof-fingers. However, Brian's ministrations soon slowed and stopped.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey babe,&quot; he began, &quot;do you think we can try to, um, get me...changed back?&quot; he asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Um, yeah.&quot; John said, slightly disappointed. He was drowning in the pure sex of Brian's minotaur body, but he knew that they both couldn't stay as orcs and minotaurs forever. They had jobs to go to, after all.<br />
<br />
Brian sensed John's disappointment and chuckled. &quot;I know,&quot; he said, kissing him again. &quot;But we should probably know if I can do the same thing as you. How did you change back, anyway?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I was--uh, I, um, had an...orgasm.&quot; Brian stared at John. &quot;I was...I was sucking my cock, alright?&quot; John said, annoyed. &quot;That's not the point. As soon as I came, I concentrated on changing back to human. And I did.&quot;<br />
<br />
Brian nodded and motioned for John to slide off the couch. Brian grunted as he tried to get his penis into his mouth by tucking his legs into his abdomen. John watched with amusement at the sight. Despite Brian's long snout and fully erect cock, he was just too big to get any satisfaction. John snickered. &quot;Shut up!&quot; Brian commanded. He gave it his full effort for about three more minutes, then ceased his effort, exhausted. &quot;That's harder than it looks,&quot; Brian panted. His cock was beginning to soften.<br />
<br />
&quot;You poor thing,&quot; John said, laying down close to him again. &quot;I can probably help you with that.&quot; Brian gasped at John rubbed his lips against his cock, which had once again stiffened. It smelled musty, but it had a manly scent to it. John straddled Brian and slowly pushed Brian's dick head into his mouth. <br />
<br />
Brian smiled (somehow). &quot;Do you swallow?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mmph,&quot; was all John could manage. The object in John's mouth was too big for him to communicate, and he couldn't get it any deeper without gagging. Brian did his part by moaning, but John could tell he wasn't getting his peak satisfaction. Well, John thought. I just have to get bigger.<br />
<br />
Brian, staring at the ceiling, realized after about a minute that he could fit more of his penis into John's mouth, and that the mass on his chest was getting heavier. He looked at John and gasped. &quot;You're changing!&quot; he exclaimed. <br />
<br />
The green-skinned figure glanced back, Brian's cock in between the growing tusks in his mouth. &quot;Don' stop.&quot; he muttered. His muscles ached as they expanded. His chest pushed out, and his arms and legs grew much heavier. The hair on the top of John's head pulled back into his scalp, but more hair sprouted on the rest of his body.<br />
<br />
Heart pounding, Brian pushed more of his cock into John's mouth, and groped his expanding muscles. Now mostly orc, John was able to wrap his tongue around half of Brian's package, causing Brian to groan in ecstasy. Brian felt the critical moment approaching, and pulled out, wanting to savor the sensation a bit more before coming.<br />
<br />
John panted. &quot;What's wrong, babe? Can't handle this?&quot; he said, sitting up on the sofa arm, looming over the sweaty minoatur. John grinned and flexed his green biceps. Brian put on a mischievous grin and quickly got off the sofa. John yelped as the sudden weight shift caused the sofa to topple over, pinning the green beast underneath it. &quot;Dick!&quot; John shouted as he crawled out from under the overturned loveseat.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Brian said, gesturing at his crotch. &quot;I need to put it somewhere. Let's go.&quot;<br />
<br />
John leapt forward and playfully tackled Brian, their hairy bodies rolling around on the carpet. &quot;You wouldn't like me when I'm angry,&quot; John growled.<br />
<br />
Brian laughed. &quot;You're not the fucking Hulk!&quot;<br />
<br />
John laughed back. &quot;After you're done, it's my turn. Your opinion on that might change.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ooh, I can't wait. Close your eyes and open up. I need to make a deposit in the orc bank.&quot; John did so. His love for Brian was overflowing. He was glad to be able to share this transformation spell with his love, especially if the sex was going to be like this.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm,&quot; John heard. &quot;An orc and a minotaur. Two grand additions, perhaps.&quot;<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
...Wait, what?<br />
<br />
John opened his eyes. Somehow, he was in a different room! It was cold, dark, and damp. As an orc, John could see fine in the dark. He looked up at Brian, with a menacing expression on his snout.<br />
<br />
&quot;Brian, what--&quot; John tried to sit up, but his arms and legs were restrained. They were shackled to the wall! He appeared to be locked up in a dungeon of some sort. &quot;What's going on?!&quot; <br />
<br />
Brian smacked John hard across the face. He cried out, both from pain and a broken heart. &quot;Be quiet, slave!&quot; Brian bellowed. Slave? What was happening?!<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll tell you,&quot; the same voice as before said. <br />
<br />
John's head snapped to face the source. His red eyes glowed with anger. &quot;You!&quot; he snarled. It was the satyr, positively glowering<br />
<br />
&quot;He's mine now.&quot; The satyr said, walking over to Brian and stroking his rump. &quot;Welcome to my realm. I've decided that he's going to look after all of my slaves.&quot; His smirk grew wider as he gestured towards Brian, towering over the now terrified John. &quot;Isn't that right?&quot;<br />
<br />
Brian's face took on a similar expression as the satyr's. &quot;Yes, master.&quot;</p>
