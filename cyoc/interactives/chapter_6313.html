<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jason climbed up the slope to where the Rangers truck was. He could smell the rutting trio from down by the creak, even over the smell of the burned Jeep. He smiled to himself as he climbed; the strength in his new legs was amazing! He climbed the steep slope like it was a small ramp!<br />
<br />
It seemed only polite for Jason to wait some way from the trio as they finished screwing, he wouldn’t want anyone to interrupt him and HIS mate; why! He rip them to pieces with his tusks if they did! He caught himself as the anger rose and took several deep breaths- wow the need to protect HIS mate was strong, overwhelming. Jason tried to engage the sensation rationally but couldn’t somehow, every time he thought about her he could feel the Boer instinct rise. He caught himself clenching and unclenching his huge fists a few times. ‘Relax’ he commanded himself. <br />
<br />
A deep roar sound interrupted his thoughts, it seemed the trio had finished. In the fading light Jason could make out that the top male was massive, a huge mature Stag- the sort a hunter would love to have on his wall. He grunted- like any hunter could take him or HIS mate now! He calmed himself again and walked over as the large male pulled himself out of the younger male he was coupled with. The older buck stood up and flexed every very large muscle in his changed body<br />
“Oh wow!” he said in a deep voice. “If this is a dream, no one wake me”<br />
“This is no dream, I can assure you” Jason said. Doug/Kern immediately moved to cover his two herd mates, he head slightly bowed, antlers pointed out, his pointed ears twisting about for the source of the sound. Herne also jumped up standing over Cameron protectively. <br />
“What?” Doug/Kern said.  Jason moved into a patch of light so they could see what he was.<br />
“I said this is no dream. No red or green pill, this is real”<br />
“You’re a Boer!” Herne exclaimed. <br />
“Yup” Jason said cheerfully and smiled, displaying his tusks. <br />
“How can this be real? I’ve just banged my head. It’s a Vision Quest” Doug/Kern cried.<br />
“On the floor by your hooves, you’ll find your uniform, unless I am wrong you’ll also find a card with the number for the Lab complex several miles from here. That Lab does R&amp;D work and you were given the card in case of forest fires heading their way, or I suspect in case your saw anything ‘unusual’. Am I wrong?”<br />
“But, but, how can a dream know this?” Doug/Kern spluttered.<br />
“Because as I said, it’s not a dream. Look at that beautiful Doe, or your Stag mate there do they look like dreams. Feel your own body, that is no dream my friend” Doug/Kern ran a furred hand over his huge chest, down over his bulging belly, and heft his huge cock. He pinched himself. Turning to Herne he pulled the Stag man close and kissed him, Herne running his hand over Kerns back in return. Jason saw both their cock begin to grow hard. The female on the floor reached up and grabbed their growing members. She pulled herself into knelling position and was about to take both of them into her muzzle when Jason coughed, loudly<br />
“Ahem. Maybe later?” he suggested “We have to sort out the truck, Jeep, and their others fro you to meet”<br />
“Others?” Herne asked.<br />
“Oh, yes many others” Jason confirmed “including another Stag” <br />
“Where is there another for my Herd?” Doug/Kern said straighten up, suddenly very tall and commanding. Jason bristled slightly….if he went near HIS mate…….<br />
“Down by the stream” he said and stuck out his hand “Jason” Doug/Kern pumped it enthusiastically.<br />
“I believe you” he said in almost a whisper “by God, I don’t know why or how, but I belie it. It’s a dream come true” He half looked back at the Doe “oh yes a dream” he whispered to himself. He locked eyes with Jason.<br />
“Doug Rictor, Ranger. However you can call me Kern. This is Herne and Cameron” he said gesturing to his companions. <br />
“Well met” Jason said. They said hello back. <br />
“Shall we go down to the stream?” Jason said. Kern picked up his ripped, useless Human clothing.<br />
“Lead on” he said dumping the pile in the back of the truck. <br />
<br />
Jason led the three back down the slope, again his sure footedness surprised him but the trio behind him were faster, their long deer legs taking them down quick. Before he could say anything or move to stop him Kern had crossed the space to the other brown furred Stag and stood, arms crossed before him<br />
“I am Kern” he said in a strong voice. The other male didn’t say a word, simply lowered his ten pointed antlers and nodded, giving Kern dominance. Kern looked confused for a moment and then swept the surprised Stag up in an embrace, literally lifting him off his hooves<br />
“AND I FEEL SO DAMM ALIVE!!” he shouted to the forest. He put the Stag down.<br />
“What your name lad?” he said more quietly. <br />
“Er…..we had been just discussing names” he said in a light voice. <br />
“We?” Kern said and only then noticed the others.<br />
<br />
Jason had returned next to the side of HIS sow, he muzzled her neck and then whispered to her<br />
”I don’t know what to call you” he said lovingly. She looked at him like he was mad and then her eye lit up<br />
“May” she said “I like that…er...month”<br />
“May it is then. I’m Jason”. She mouthed the word and then kissed him. Jason felt a deep satisfaction in that kiss, like everything was going to be alright. He was safe here in HIS sow’s arms. <br />
<br />
Kern looked round the clearing at all the animorphs. Any lingering doubts about this being a dream faded completely. There was a squirrel, two racoons, a she Bear, Jason and a sow. The squirrel and racoons were discussing something and since Jason and his lady were necking Kern walked over to them<br />
“Hello” he said. The squirrel jumped back a little but the racoons looked up at him<br />
“Hullo” the male said in a slightly squeaky voice. Kern grinned at the black and white furred man <br />
“Pretty wild all this heh?” <br />
“I guess” he answered. <br />
“Until this afternoon we were normal racoons, so it’s all a bit new” the female said. <br />
“I’m Kern” the Stag said. The male racoon looked at his mate.<br />
“Er…..we don’t have names yet.” He said<br />
“Though I think he should be Rocky, cos it sounds good” she said<br />
“Only if you’ll be Rachael” he answered. They looked at each other for a moment <br />
“OK” they said together. <br />
“Well nice to meet you Rocky and Rachael. Can I introduce to the each of my Herd?” <br />
“I’m Sid” the squirrel said suddenly stepping out from behind Rocky suddenly bold.<br />
“Nice to meet you” Kern rumbled. The squirrel man nodded his head up and down vigorsly pleased the big stag man had talked to him. <br />
<br />
Kern introduced the rest of his herd. The other buck had picked the name Rick. Jason joined the grouping<br />
“Where did the Wolves go?” he asked Rocky<br />
“They said they needed to run and then they went real sudden”<br />
“Hum, werid. Hope they didn’t go far, we need to round up as many animorphs as possible and get far away from here”.<br />
“I smell Bear” the she-bear said. All the animorphs looked up and snifted. The males moved to cover their mated females without thinking about it. The she-Bear went off a little ways snuffling and smelling the air. Since she’d been able to think she’d not smelt a male Bear and now she can she felt herself getting horny. <br />
After about five minuets of searching she found the trail and began following it back up wind away from the others. The trail was coming towards their territory, and she could smell two Bears. She marked a tree to let the males know they were entering anothers territory and that she was ready for them too. She marked a few more trees then returned to the others. <br />
“They are coming” she said. Jason ordered them into a loose defensive force. If it was real bears, they would have to deal with them, push them into the stream or see if they could make them animorphs some other way. If it was animorphs, well he’d see.</p>
