To clarify, yes Irie has a horsecock and Andrew doesn&#39;t know Alexia has a mare pussy due to Irie&#39;s inferring with his perception.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">3 months have passed since the Witch revived. Andrew has successfully impregnated both Hailey and Katie, and thanks to some help from the Witch, they should be able to give birth at anytime now, as long as the witch permits them to that is. Without her permission to birth their offspring, they would be forced to remain pregnant forever, not that either of them were complaining about it. They enjoied their huge stomachs and how its buldge pushed their hind legs apart slightly. Even sex with their stud Andrew still was great, as the witch ensured that nothing could being harm to their baby&#39;s durring sex. However until the witch had a need for a 4 horse drawn carriage, she had no intentions of allowing them to give birth.<br />
<br />
Andrea was now just a faint voice which sometimes made Andrew question things momentarily, but was too easy to just ignore. Even Andrea was becoming corrupted from all of the sex she was having. For example, she no longer could remember how it felt to not have a horse dick between her legs. The one complaint Andrew ever had was that 1 of the mares on the farm was not his. He could smell 3 mares, but never could find the third, just Hailey and Katie. He would look for hours, but to no avail. Even his own mother smelled like a mare he hadn&#39;t claimed, so there had to be one somewhere, but he just never could find her. <br />
<br />
Durring the last 3 months, Alecia has gotten use to her new life. Even the part about her laying around a dozen eggs twice a day, every day had now become a positive experience for her. She would become excited whenever she was close to laying her next clutch. Because of the frequency though, she also had developed a preference for being completely naked at all times. It was just easier to live naked. She could slip right into the nest, put on the milk pumps, and simply let out her eggs. No undressing required. And since she never needed to go anywhere, being naked was not an issue.<br />
<br />
Plus, Irie seemed to enjoy watching her naked body, as she would often catch her staring out of the corner of her eyes from time to time. Of all the victims, Alecia was the only one who would likely never be able to be saved. The constant sex with the witch, as well as all of the mental rewrites have completely erased any semblance of her former self from existance. Even her guild ID now read Alecia, and it wasn&#39;t just an issusion either. <br />
<br />
Vivian could remember everything. She had almost no mental alterations, besides a few to make living as a toddler easier for everyone, such as an urge to drink breast milk from Alecia. The other change was that she couldn&#39;t act as if Alecia wasn&#39;t her Mother, even if she knew otherwise. <br />
<br />
While she wouldn&#39;t admit to it, Irie actually held a small grudge towards Vivian, since she was the one who actually killed her. She would often mock her when they were alone, and Vovian would puke on her or mess her diaper intentionally while Irie was holding her. Irie was having fun messing with her though, so she just played along as if Vivian was just a nornal toddler, which just made Vivian annoyed even more. <br />
<br />
One time she showed Vivian Alecia&#39;s ID card, which shocked Vivian immensely. Alec had truely become Alecia in body and mind, as now a woman was shown on the card, whith the name Alecia instead of Alec. Even her nationality had become &quot;The Immortal Witch Irie&#39;s Wife&quot;. She guessed that since witches create their own territory with Magic, that being a member of their family would technically make it also where they directed their national loyalty towards. But because of this, a red border now framed the ID card, which indicated having loyalty towards a hostile faction, at least in the guilds eyes. Basically as long as the border was shown, she would be considered a target for subjugation by the guild and any town, village, or city she entered.<br />
<br />
Neka was Neka. She had not changed really at all. Still a kitten, and still was violent towards anything she didn&#39;t see as family, although now she was especially clingy towards Vivian seeing her now as her twin sister. She would often just follow her around and kept her company at night by cuddling up with her in her crib, after escaping from her own. <br />
<br />
***********<br />
<br />
It was getting colder outside. And after a week of begging, Alecia finally convinced Irie to get her a feathered coat from the nearby town so she could stay warm when out of the house. She didn&#39;t own a single article of clothing. And while she didn&#39;t care about being naked, even if she was in public (although that was not going to happen very often), being cold was a different matter. That being said, Irie had apparently interpreted her request as a different meaning. <br />
<br />
When Alecia woke up this morning, she was surprised that she wasn&#39;t cold in the slightest like she usually was. Shenlooked down and found out why, as now most of her body from the neck down to her thighs was covered in feathers. Only her breasts, hands, and pussy were left bare. Large plumes of long feathers stuck out of her forearms, which if she curled up into the fetal position, would be able to cover her legs and other exposed parts. They kind of resembled wings, but she couldn&#39;t fly with them. They simply were meant for warmth. Her feet had become bird-like talons too, so that walking on the cold ground was not quite as uncomfortable, while sticking to the &quot;bird theme&quot; Irie had established for her. She had gotten quite a laugh out of it, and decided to just roll with it as if it was what she had wanted from the beginning. When she showed her daughters, Vivian cried instantly while Neka pounced onto her boob, licking and sucking out her milk like usual. Vivian was crying simply because she was startled by her mother&#39;s appearance and nothing else. However she calmed down once she was picked up and offered a nipple to suck on.<br />
<br />
When she showed herself to the barn to feed the horses, both Hailey and Katie were frightened, but Andrew recognized her instantly. She still smelled like that elusive mare afterall. After calming the girls down, they both cautiously trotted over to her and started to drink from her nipples like usual. Did they need to drink her milk? Not really. But Alecia produced such an excess that Irie didn&#39;t mind her &quot;sharing with the animals&quot; as she put it. Hailey and Katie both had been properly trained by now to not wait for her to tell them to start and just begin drinking whenever she was nearby. As the girls drank, Alecia grabbbed a nearby pair of sheers and trimmed their bangs for them. Every week or so she would cut a bit of their hair in order to not have it block their vision. Today was no different besides her feathered body actually kept her quite warm in the colder air as long as she kept her hands over her breasts. <br />
<br />
While Alecia was feeding the horsegirls, Irie entered the barn with a sour look. &quot;Alecia, we have some shitty guests comming. Go inside and grab the grey potion on the table but do not drink it. Then  put the girls inside Vivian&#39;s crib. After that, come meet me by the gate with the potion. I will clean up here.&quot; <br />
<br />
Alecia didn&#39;t say a word and just left to do the tasks. 5 minutes later she met Irie by the gate, potion in hand. &quot;I don&#39;t plan to fight, but mearly either run away, or mess with their memories so that are existance is masked. We are not yet ready to go against a subjugation order. These guys are likely scouts though, or perhaps doing a simple quest that just happened to be around this area. I want you to find out. That potion will turn your feathers into a light weight, but extremely strong metal, while also providing you warmth. I am going to regress your arms and feet though, so that you can wear clothes and not be an obvious concern. The moment you discover their intentions, signal me to either to kill them or to hide our existence. Either way, I will not let them harm you so no worries. Just DO NOT show them your ID card under any circumstance.&quot; Instructed Irie, but after a moment, she added another option. &quot;Alternatively, we could simply scrap the home and barn, and teleport to somewhere else. We will lose a lot of our resources, and where we end up may not ve much better, but then we won&#39;t need to risk anything, and if it turns out to be nothing, we can go and salvage our abandoned items. Neither will be an easy option, but it is up to you. Do you want to investigate or relocate?&quot;</p>
