<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Brian gazed at the costume that was now laid out on the bed he shared with Bethany. He and his girlfriend had decided to wait until Hallowe&#39;en before trying on their costumes and, secretly, Brian had hoped Bethany would forget as she got ready for the 31st with decorating, buying candy for the occasional trick-or-treater and figuring out where the best parties in town would be.<br />
<br />
Now, staring at the costume, a note that had been folded up in the brown paper with the costume clutched in his hand, he understand that it wasn&#39;t to be and that he was going to get dressed as a match to Bethany&#39;s costume. Glancing down at the note, which explained that, for best results, the wearer should put on the mask first, the torso section next and lastly the leg section, tucking back any penis and testicle if the wearer was male and the costume was female.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is crazy,&quot; he muttered and turning away, he listened as Bethany moved about in the bathroom, finishing the shower she insisted on taking before getting dressed in her costume.<br />
<br />
If not for the fact that it was important to Bethany, and that he’d agree, Brian thought the right choice would be to forget about the costume. But there was the clinch. He had agreed. Twice. Once after losing a bet and then in Second Skin, which, to his way of looking at, left with an obligation. Thinking, “It’s just for one evening, he turned back to face the bed and huffing, disliking the idea of wearing either of the things, he stared at the bodysuit and began shucking off his clothes.<br />
<br />
Naked, muttering, “This is crazy,” he reached for the mask. Holding up before his face, he studied the bushy auburn hair that was more red than brown, the creamy white skin, the two red fox ears poking up through the hair at the top of the head, the small pouty lips and the eyes that looked light steel grey.<br />
<br />
The inside of the mask was a medium red and, like the outside, had a warmth to it that Brian couldn’t figure out where it originated from or how and why it felt so. Pulling the mask on over his head, everything going dark for a brief moment, Brian found himself looking out through the masks eyes after a second or two, but discovered that mask, despite how small it looked, was baggy and hung down past his collarbone. Thinking that it made it look unrealistic and like elephant skin, he reached for the torso section, which was also red on the inside and, unlike the mask, had a glow to it that reminded him of the films he’d been forced to watch in his high school classes, showing the inside of the human body.<br />
<br />
Unsure about this, staring at the body portion of the bodysuit, he shivered, but not because he was standing naked in his and Bethany’s bedroom. Muttering, “Might as well get this over with,” thinking the torso section would be as baggy as the head section, he began shrugging it on.<br />
<br />
The arm and hand portion giving him the most difficulty, Brian in the end resorted to putting his hands and arms in first. Adjusting them so that nothing was twisted, he set to work pulling the torso section on over the mask. Settling it in place over his own torso, he was amazed when it pulled the headpiece tight, causing it to form-fit to his own head. Finding he could move the jaw, he opened and closed his mouth a couple times, stuck out his tongue and made what he thought were seductive kissing motions as he blinking his eyes and wrinkled his nostrils.<br />
<br />
Amazed how much it now fit, he glanced down and wasn’t the least bit surprised by what he saw. The mask may have been pulled tight, but now the torso section was baggy, with only the arms, hands and shoulders showing any hint of conforming to anything resembling form fitting. The breasts, he noted, were two barely-there lumps, whilst the edge of the torso section hung down a little ways past his hips. Thinking it to would be pulled tight once he pulled on the leg section, Brian reached for the last part of the bodysuit and immediately discovering that he would have to sit down to get most it on, he grimaced in agitation and sat down on the edge of the bed.<br />
<br />
Like the other portions of the bodysuit, the leg section was also red inside, had a warmth to it and, like the torso section, had a slight glow it that not only reminded him of the biology class movies, but also made him think of what it was like when he shut his eyes and looked up at the sun. Rolling down each leg, he inserted his feet one at a time, adjusted them and then began rolling up the legs, stopping ever so often to adjust. When the bottom piece of the bodysuit was about three quarters of the way on Brian stood and after an awkward moment, managed to tuck his penis and testicles between his legs, get them to stay and fumbling a bit more, shrugged the leg section up and on, all the way up past where his waistline was normally, stopping where a girl would have her waist.<br />
<br />
His genitals pinching for a moment, Brian worried that he would have to take off the lower section and re-adjust. But then his penis and testicles pressed into something soft and squishy and the pinched feeling completely disappeared. Looking down, discovering that the leg section didn’t have the same baggy look as the other two section, Brian marvelled, and found himself disturbed, at how much the costumed actually made him look like a girl. There was a few flaws he could instantly see and squatting down, expecting his penis and testicles to poke out through the area between his legs, he mentally noted that the costume didn’t have the well-developed curves, pronounced hips, butt and thighs and the normal size breasts of any girl he’d ever seen.<br />
<br />
“In fact, if I had to guess, I’d say the costume makes me look like a girl,” and cupping his petite-looking hands over the barely-there-breast, he instantly withdrew his hands.<br />
<br />
Alarmed by not only that he could actually feel his hands touching the breasts, that touching them not only sent a slight shiver through him, but also that they were really sensitive, yet also a tad sore, mostly around the nipple and areola, but also that the erect nipple, the subtle imperfections and the way they sat felt so realistic, Brian ran a hand through the shoulder-length bushy hair, which also felt real. Staring downward, accidentally nudging the fox ears, which he could not only feel with his hand, but through the flesh of the ear, he mumbled, “What the hey?” before heading over to the full-body mirror Bethany kept in the corner and peering into it, he stared at his reflection.<br />
<br />
	After a couple minutes of trying to wrap his mind around how much the bodysuit hugged his body and actually made him look like a girl, he squatted down a couple more times, stood up straight, turned sideways and lifted his leg. Holding the appendage up, he peered at the whitish-barely-pink female slit, disturbed by how realistic it looked. About to touch it, he instead put his leg down. An idea coming to him, as he thought something about his reflection, besides the obvious, looked off and heading for the closet, he began fishing about.<br />
<br />
Seconds later, he was back in front of the mirror, holding a scale his girlfriend kept in the bedroom and a roll of a measuring tape for sewing. Setting the scale on the floor next to him, Brian unrolled the tape. Holding it up to the top of his head, he let it drop and after bit of fumbling about, managed to get the other pinned under his heal. Dropping the end he was holding, he squatted down and picked up the bit on the floor and mentally calculating, he thought, “That can’t be right,” and trying again, this time pinning one end under his heel and stretching the other end up to the top of his head, he re-read the numbers, still found them upsetting and was mildly perturbed by what he was reading, which he thought must be in accurate.<br />
<br />
When he stepped on the scale, after tossing the measure tape on the bed, he was even more perplexed and disturbed by what he was seeing. Checking his weight a couple more times, his feelings of unease growing, Brian eventually moved back in front of the mirror. Staring at his reflection, disturbed by what he was seeing, he wondered aloud, “How is possible for a twenty-six-year-old man, who normally stands five foot eleven and weights a hundred and fifty eight pounds to drop to a height of four foot five and a weight of sixty one pounds?” Finding himself at a loss as to how to answer such a conundrum, he turned toward the bed and putting on the rest of the outfit, bothered by how the clothes felt and looked, plus having a slight issue with the bra, which fastened in the front between the cups, and the tail, which pinched into his tailbone the moment he button up the shorts, he tried to work out the problem he was having with the costume.</p>
