<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The global pandemic with the Corona Virus was something that had panicked much of the world, and even Animalia to some degree, particularly given the fact that many of Animalia&#39;s colonies were only economically viable because they served as major tourist attractions. Animalia, itself, wasn&#39;t as hampered by this as some other places, but even there restrictions and social distancing were taking effect, particularly as there was no confirmation as to whether or not Animalians could contract the disease. There were some suggestions that they might be more resistant to it, particularly while the Animalia Virus was active, but with many of the laws the US and many other countries had put in place to make sure the Animalia Virus was kept under control, there were some concerns that would reduce what resistance Animalians had.<br />
<br />
That was starting to have some effect on things done in Animalia. Things like the Meat Market had reworked their whole shifts and tolerances. Before the place was often crowded and had large numbers of guests and in staff in close proximity. Now, many of the tables had been put in storage to help mandate a smaller audience size and that contact between dancers and guests was now strictly forbidden and even the staff rotation was lowered so as to assure that no one among the staff would be violating those codes. And the Meat Market wasn&#39;t the only place that was seeing those sorts of restrictions. They were also beginning to show up at places like the Claw Coliseum as well, and some of these were becoming more stringent, just to make sure that Humans who came in for exercise classes didn&#39;t get sick or spread the sickness if they already had it.<br />
<br />
&quot;But Ling and I always jog together,&quot; Mr. Hyun said slowly, largely in reference to a wider jogging path that made of the terraces in the main stands. The area had some heavy rubber like cushioning that padded the way for Animalians with padded feet so that it would be like hitting a hard rock for them and that Animalians like himself and Ling wouldn&#39;t have a surface where they could lose traction rather than on tiled floor. Normally this area was only closed off to joggers if there was some other large event going on at the time and joggers would be blocking the view of those in the stands, but at present none of that was going on.<br />
<br />
&quot;And you still can,&quot; the man manning the desk answered, &quot;just not right now. At present those checked in to jog  would have the jogging terrace that would fit both for physical health and the &quot;social distancing&quot; requirements being mandated by the state, just to stay open. Particularly with all this stuff going on... and that Horizon&#39;s conversion operation will still have people coming into the state from other areas. In this... many of the services we offer are swamped and our staff is limited... between disinfecting making sure no one is in tightly packed crowds... there is a lot to do, and much of this will have the potential to tighten... particularly if the numbers in Nevada go up...&quot;<br />
<br />
Mr. Hyun sighed and nodded at that. He&#39;d focused on a lot of that news of late, particularly as there wasn&#39;t that much else to check on. The one plus side was that the scare in China and it&#39;s spread into Korea had eased some of the concerns that he might have had with being recalled, as from what little he&#39;d gotten from his government, it seemed like they were more concerned with things there than with their schemes for Ling and the Animalia Virus. Not to mention that with the American government then putting in place a massive travel ban on the Far East. In theory that would have made sense in December and January before the disease came to America, but Mr. Hyun chose not to dwell on his critiques of the American government. For after the Corona Virus pandemic ended, he might well need the US government to protect him and Ling should the idea of some kind of specialized &quot;embassy&quot; for Animalia and both Korean republics fail.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are they that bad?&quot; Mr. Hyun wondered, his thoughts worrying about Ling.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not as bad as New York, Florida, or Louisiana,&quot; the man answered, &quot;but then... we&#39;re pretty remote and Animalia/Lyre&#39;s real &quot;tourist&quot; season wouldn&#39;t start until June, so most people from our state wouldn&#39;t be moving our way yet to see what Animalia does for the summer for a few months... if things are normal... and California and Oregon are both under state wide &quot;stay at home&quot; orders, meaning anyone else close enough to visit Lyre/Animalia outside of the tourist season can&#39;t come. So I don&#39;t think there are any cases in Lyre/Animalia... yet. But the state has nearly 1,300 cases and just over 30 deaths. And so long as people are allowed to come in to convert to being Animalians... there is the potential for it still to come. And some other places might have it worse that we could.&quot;*<br />
<br />
&quot;I... I do not know what to say,&quot; Mr. Hyun answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just stay safe and stay clean,&quot; the man at the counter replied, &quot;and yours and Ling&#39;s turn to jog will come shortly...&quot;<br />
<br />
Mr. Hyun nodded and turned back to the waiting area with a sigh. He didn&#39;t like the wait, but he supposed there wasn&#39;t much they could do but wait. She had gone to sit in the waiting area while Mr. Hyun had gone to talk with the man at the desk as to why they couldn&#39;t get their jogging in, which was something that both could do... as neither had any interest in some of the other things some Animalians got into. Besides, jogging was healthy and was more than enough. However, as he turned to the that entry area, which presently had fewer chairs than it normally did, Mr. Hyun found something that was not to his liking.<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
Ling had been a bit saddened by the wait as well, as she enjoyed jogging with Hyun. It was something that got his mind off of following the news or think on ways to protect her from what the North Korean government would pull on her, and now him, in the future should things go bad. Ling knew the general danger, and she did honestly love Hyun for his caring attention to her, but she preferred to see him happy and at least looking like the weight of the world wasn&#39;t on his shoulders. For so far the North Korean government hadn&#39;t recalled him and the ideas for an embassy for North Korea on Heiya Island or on the border between North and South Korea for Animalians was supposedly being considered. With that she hoped to remain optimistic.<br />
<br />
So, she sat down and tentatively looked to one of the billboards that was on a nearby wall and saw the list of scheduled events. Many of the UFC-A events seemed to be unchanged, as the UFC as a whole had not seemed to have cancelled events, though Ling also noted that there were also postings that the bouts would be without fans, which she didn&#39;t think would be profitable for any kind of professional sports, and that all combatants in these bouts would have to get a negative test result before any event would be held. It was just another sign on how much the present pandemic was affecting things on a global scale. She knew Americans loved sports, and now they were having to go without them.<br />
<br />
Her attention was then pulled away when she heard a soft cough come from the other side of her. It wasn&#39;t a sickly cough, but more to get her attention. She originally thought it was Mr. Hyun and she prepared to get up, but as she turned to the sound, she found that while the one who&#39;d made the noise was another Korean Water Deer buck, he was not Mr. Hyun. This buck flashed her a smile and flipped his blond hair away from his eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey there, good looking, come here often?&quot; the buck asked her and flashed a bright smile, showing how well he&#39;d polished his teeth and his tusks. The practically glowed with the light reflected off of them, they were that clean, though Ling could also tell that this was a pretty clear pick up line by this buck.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Ling said slowly, and actually trying to fake that she was still struggling with her English, hoping that would alert this buck that the doe he was flirting with was already taken, assuming this guy had seen the Animalia Ambassadoria episodes that not only introduced Ling but also presented Mr. Hyun as becoming her bond-mate. &quot;You are new... yes? I have not seen many humans become Water Deer. Most Deer Animalians that were Human seem to prefer the Moose and Elk... the larger and more powerful species.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They&#39;re a dime a dozen,&quot; the buck waved that off, &quot;besides, I&#39;m sure I&#39;d kill at Halloween Parties... I vant to suck your blood... ah... ah.. ah.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ling nodded at that and figured that the tusks on the upper jaw might be a reason that some Humans might want to become Water Deer, though she didn&#39;t need the attempted German/Romanian accent to pretend to be Dracula. Water Deer may have gained the nickname &quot;Vampire Deer,&quot; but they didn&#39;t drink blood in any way. Like all other deer, they were strict vegetarians. In this, that nickname was starting to grow old.<br />
<br />
&quot;But I was here to register and get buff... and since one of the gyms is presently empty...&quot; the buck continued as crouched down so that his eyes were level with hers. Ling fold also feel the buck&#39;s hand touch her sweat pants at her thigh and almost moved toward her inner thigh. &quot;I figured a beautiful lady like yourself might like to come along.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, thank you,&quot; Ling managed politely, &quot;I am fine.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on...&quot; the guy insisted when a growling bark followed by a couple of steady clicking sound.<br />
<br />
That got Ling to perk her ears up. For while she grew up alone on a farm in North Korea before her uplifting and thus wasn&#39;t fully aware on things that the Korean Water Deer naturally in the wild, but something in the back of her mind told her that was a male&#39;s challenge during the rut, which shouldn&#39;t be until November/December when she would come into season. She looked up to see that Mr. Hyun had returned and had his focus on the buck.<br />
<br />
&quot;She said no,&quot; Mr. Hyun said to the buck, not really caring that a Human had converted to being a Water Deer. All he saw was that Ling was uncomfortable and this buck was the cause. As such, he would defend his bond mate firmly.<br />
<br />
The buck turned and stood up, and was a few inches taller than Mr. Hyun, not counting his ears, but Mr. Hyun still didn&#39;t back down. He again gave a growling bark while gnashing his molars together and making the clicking sound that Ling had noticed. He didn&#39;t quite know how he knew how to do that, but Mr. Hyun felt it appropriate.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come now, little guy,&quot; the buck answered, &quot;she was seated here alone. I call that fair game. What could she see in you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Mr. Hyun was about to answer when he noticed a largely gray shape move up behind Ling. It was only when he spoke in a very deep tone, deeper than either the buck or Mr. Hyun that either noticed just who it was.<br />
<br />
&quot;It could be Ms. Ling has had interests on an emotional level with Mr. Hyun that go before his conversion... maybe even before her uplifting,&quot; the voice spoke, &quot;but still... there will be no fighting here...&quot;<br />
<br />
The two turned to see the Styracosaurus Dinotopian, Brett Horne, standing there in his own sweats and with a long white towel around his neck. And while Styracosaurus wasn&#39;t the largest Ceratopsian dinosaur, it was still larger than a Water Deer, and as such Brett towered over all of them, with his horns making him look even more impressive. He looked to the buck first.<br />
<br />
&quot;She said no, leave it be,&quot; Brett said to him, &quot;she is Hyun&#39;s bond-mate.&quot; He then turned to Hyun, &quot;and while I understand wanting to protect a loved one... we don&#39;t need a fight in the lobby. If the two of you really need to settle things with fisticuffs... I can arrange a private UFC-A match for the both of you, with medical staff ready to deal with any injury and within the accepted rules of combat sports. And that would be better than bashing each other&#39;s heads in and ending up in jail for disorderly conduct.&quot;<br />
<br />
That got them both to step down and the other buck backed off, though as he departed for the gym at the Claw Coliseum he gave one parting look to Mr. Hyun, &quot;see you around little man... might take you up on the match. Bet I&#39;d win easy.&quot;<br />
