<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Being that this was a resort reigned over and ruled by the Greek Gods, there was one guiding rule that most Gods, Demigods and even Monsters knew to adhere to - the rule of Xenia, hospitality, of being welcoming to guests. Being that Derrick had been rather &quot;haughty&quot;, Zeus from his place on high watching had been willing to let things play out for a time to try and not only amuse himself, but humble Derrick. But now as it went on and Derrick languished, Zeus was quickly realizing what this was. A challenge, to his realm of &quot;Xenia&quot;.<br />
<br />
Hera spoke to him, whispering in her quiet tone, &quot;I believe this boy has been punished long and hard enough. Sexual torment, especially for a young, virile boy like him who has been nothing but faithful to his girlfriend until circumstances aligned...I do not care for it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Zeus decided thus with his wife&#39;s council in mind that he was going to give Derrick some measure of a reprieve. Hopefully Derrick had learnt his lesson well enough not to overconfidently charge ahead when it came to beings like Medusa. He was after all only mortal, and the Gods were...well, Gods.<br />
<br />
Preparing a maelstrom burst of his godly power from his outstretched hand, Zeus decided to restore Derrick&#39;s ability to move, to breath, to live...within certain lines. A new idea, a new plan for amusement came to the mind of the great lord of the Gods. And it brought a cruel smirk to his face.<br />
<br />
-----------<br />
<br />
Derrick was just about to go mad, set adrift in the sensations of being so big, so strong, so full of masculine power and virile energy...yet so very unable to move. He wanted to take hold of his enormously aroused organ, to let his hands feel his body, to do anything to pursue pleasure in the heat of the moment. But he couldn&#39;t. He couldn&#39;t so much as touch his chest and feel the heat of his muscles. Even Medusa before long left to seek other toys for her own desires.<br />
<br />
The former teen wanted to cry, to beg for some form of reprieve...<br />
<br />
Had he been overconfident? He was just a teenager, seeing a beautiful woman at a vacation, how else was he supposed to act? Was he supposed to take it for granted that supernatural serpent women existed that could turn him to stone at a glance? Derrick just wanted to enjoy his vacation. Was that so wrong---<br />
<br />
Derrick&#39;s internal lament was cut short when he felt a sudden outburst of sheer energy cascade through him all at once. He almost felt the world seem to give way for a moment around it, his body shifting somehow, and he could detect something had intervened. Maybe some sort of greater deity - capable of more than what Medusa was capable of.<br />
<br />
He got that answer when he heard a voice echo loudly in his head, [&quot;I am Zeus, King of the Gods, callow boy. I deigned not to stand back while a violation of Sacred Xenia took place. You will be...somewhat restored.&quot;]<br />
<br />
Derrick felt the energy withdraw from him as suddenly as it arrived, and he breathed outloud as the overwhelming force receded. He felt relief in its passing, but also gratitude immeasurable for the fact Zeus had went forward with helping him. It did not take long for Derrick to realize what it meant when he heard his own breath upon the air.<br />
<br />
A heavy creaking noise issued forth as Derrick moved from what had been a fixed position, gasping and breathing. His voice was deeper and more gravely, &quot;What...what the hell happened to me?&quot; He had been anticipating on feeling himself able to move that the stone covering him would be gone.<br />
<br />
But as Derrick moved from his position and examined himself, still thrumming with arousal and barely able to halt himself, he realized something;<br />
<br />
His body had not changed at all from what it had become, basically. Stepping on the ground resulted in a loud booming noise, and in some places the sound of stone scraping on stone if he dragged his feet. He raised his hand and saw the stone flesh moving, his fingers wiggling with life as he examined himself. He tried to flex and he felt his body was alive with force, with masculine power, and sheer energy. Derrick felt like he could run a marathon in a single evening at the front of the group.<br />
<br />
But he also still felt cold, still felt like everything was carved on to him.<br />
<br />
Derrick was still made of stone, nothing about that had changed. What had changed was the fact that he was now able to move and regained his bodily functions. He could feel himself move, he could hear himself speak, and a cursory touch at his groin made the stone man grin and shake with arousal. He could still feel the thrill of sexual arousal. &quot;F-Fuck...now what do I do?&quot;</p>
