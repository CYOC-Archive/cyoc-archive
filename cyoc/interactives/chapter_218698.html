<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Before we go running off to Hell and leaving Earth behind can I see a photo of Penny?” inquired Remeila as everyone looked at her slightly confused as to why she was asking about Penny, even her husband was slightly confused but he had trouble keeping up with all her sisters. To be fair she had trouble with that as well and while she could keep track of his siblings there were only 19 of them, she wasn’t even totally sure how many sons and daughters her dad had currently. <br />
<br />
However Penemue had been hard to forget, she had gotten a stern talking down by their father for messing with the human world in the past. The thing was it wasn’t like some of her more rebellious siblings who played pranks on humans from time to time or even her who married a demon prince, he talking down to came from when she miracle away large parts of the Library of Alexandria when it was burning in 48bc. It stood out because it was so different than the normal talking down to that happened whenever one of his children did something he didn’t approve of. If Remeila remembered correctly their father had a slight grin while doing so and didn’t say a word when she did the same thing when the Mongols burned the great library in Baghdad a couple of centuries later. It had been an the shock of all her siblings when Penemue had announced she was going to Earth to find love, everything thought she would spend the rest of time in the libraries of heaven. <br />
<br />
“Who are you? Why?” inquired Rebecca <br />
<br />
“She is family as well, she is married to my nephew here.” Answered Astaroth as Rebecca messed with her phone and was about to pull up an image when the phone rang.<br />
<br />
“Hello?” inquired Rebecca as she answered the phone.<br />
<br />
“Mrs. Church where are you?” inquired a female voice. <br />
<br />
“I am at my daughter’s place, how is Josh?” inquired Rebecca. <br />
<br />
“He is good, we are coming to you. He is filing a report with some officers right now, should be over in a few minutes.” Said the voice as Remeila held out her hand.<br />
<br />
“Let me talk to her.” said Remeila <br />
<br />
“Penny, someone wants to talk to you.” Said Rebecca concerned as she handed the phone off to Remeila.<br />
<br />
“Hello.” Said Penny’s voice.<br />
<br />
“Hello, Penemue it’s Remeila.” Introduced Remeila, she knew from the voice she had been right.<br />
<br />
“Remeila! what the heck are you doing with Mrs. Church?” inquired Penny’s voice back, that was all the confirmation Remeila needed to know that this was her younger sister and that her day just got more complicated.<br />
<br />
“Her daughter is going to be my sister-in-law in a few days.” explained Remeila into the phone. “Charon, Archduchess Astaroth, Princess Maisma, Mrs. Church and her daughter, Rachel all here. Thanatos will be here in a little bit to do the final set up for the fake deaths.” <br />
<br />
“Why is Astaroth there? What is Archduchess of the Sixth Circle doing there?” inquired Penny clearly confused. <br />
<br />
“You’re the Archduchess of the Sixth Circle?” inquired Rebecca amazed.<br />
<br />
“Archduchess of the Sixth Circle, Lady of Sloth and Vanity, Grand Treasurer of Hell and Dame Grand Pentagram of the Order of the Fly.” Said Astaroth with a shrug of her shoulders. “I am Lucifer’s little and only sister afterall.&quot;<br />
<br />
“That I didn’t know.” Stated Rebecca<br />
<br />
“She dated Mrs. Church before she got married and now, she is going with her daughter as well.” stated Remeila as she rubbed her temples, that as a sign for her husband to come up and rubbed her shoulders to help her relax.<br />
<br />
“This is a mess.” stated Penny. <br />
<br />
“You are not kidding, how sure are you on Josh?” inquired Remeila her voice serious. <br />
<br />
“After today, I am sure about him.” confirmed Penny before pausing for a moment. “How sure he is on me, is another question. He doesn&#39;t know my true form and that is always the riskiest moment according to the books at least.”<br />
<br />
“Well, we will find out. Get over here, I’ll call dad.” said Remeila <br />
<br />
“Remeila, I should add Mr. Church hit me as well.” stated Penny as Remeilia’s human eyes flashed their natural lilac color. <br />
“He what?” her voice so cold, that it sent a chill down the spines of everyone there including the full blooded demons.<br />
<br />
“A slap across the face, Josh got in front of him and took a three more blows meant for me I am sure. That is why I am sure about him.” confirmed Penny pausing for a moment to wipe away the sniffers. “He is coming over, we will be there in 15 minutes.”<br />
<br />
Rachel knew that from the hospital it was at least a 20 to 30 minute drive, however that was with a normal human driving. With an angel or a devil for that matter making sure to adjust the traffic lights to make sure they are all green, 15 minutes was possible.<br />
<br />
“Alright see you soon.” Said Remeilia as she hung up the phone. <br />
<br />
“What a fucking mess.” Said Remeilia, to hear an Angel curse was a clear sign at how screwy everything had become. “You all take care of Mrs. Church, I need to call my father.”<br />
<br />
“I actually feel sorry for Mr. Church now.” stated Charon as everyone looked at him as Remeilia walked away heading toward the bedroom.<br />
<br />
 “He assaulted the women the Devil’s only sister loves, the mother of his soon to be daughter in law and now he hit one of the daughters of God one of his favorites too. He is screwed both from above and below.”<br />
<br />
“Daughter of God?” inquired Rebecca confused. “Penny is a daughter of God? She is an Angel?”<br />
<br />
“So it would seam.” confirmed Astaroth “Demons and Angels both come to Earth looking for love. Done so with ease since the peace between Heaven and Hell was made. Thanks to these two that is.&quot;<br />
<br />
“Charon my older brother, is the son of the Devil and Remeilia is one of the daughters of God, they got married and now rule purgatory together.” explained Maisy before looking at her brother. “You better call Dad as well. He will want to know about this as well.”<br />
<br />
As Charon nodded his head and headed toward the bedroom as well to call their father in a more private setting.<br />
<br />
“Really? The son of the Devil and the daughter of God?” inquired Rebecca<br />
<br />
“Come on, lets get you sat down on the couch, I think we still have some wine.” Offered Maisy<br />
<br />
“Wine would be most welcomed.” confirmed Rebecca as they headed toward the wrap around couch which they had gotten used when they got the apartment together a couple of years ago. <br />
<br />
“Here, let me heal those wounds.” Stated Astaroth as she placed her hand, now a glow with red energy on Rebecca’s stomach, the marks began to fade almost as once. <br />
<br />
“Thanks.” Said Rebecca as she held onto Astaroth’s other hand with a smile on her face, a smile that had been missing for a very long time.<br />
<br />
 Exactly 15 minutes later there was a knock at the door as Rachel opened it to find her fraternal twin brother standing in the doorway. He was taller than Rachel, in her human form at least with a strong jawline and a kind face. His short brown hair cut the same style he used to wear in high school when he was forced to play football by their father still graced his head. He had been too lazy to stylize it and frankly Rachel wouldn’t have been surprised if her brother didn’t actually know how. His frame was lean but well built from his time as captain of their high school swim team and his time playing baseball.<br />
<br />
Their father had never approved of the swim team, finding to unmanly, that had been a major fight between the two which had almost came to blows. Only when members of the church began to congratulate him for how well Josh was doing on the swim team did he “approved” his son being on the swim team.<br />
<br />
The glasses something which normally gave him a sort of sexy nerd vibe, where cracked rested on his nose wrapped in multiple braces, as one of his eyes was clearly black and blue and would likely swell shut I the next day or two. One of his arms held onto his side, a clear sign of pain there as well. <br />
<br />
“Congratulations little sister.” said Josh, Rachel could still see that his teeth was stained red with his own blood. She didn&#39;t even care that he called her &quot;little&quot; sister even though they had been born only minutes after him.<br />
<br />
“Come here, you lovable idiot.” said Rachel with tears pulled him into a deep loving embraced that she didn’t want to break from. “Come on, mom is inside with a few others.”<br />
<br />
“Hello, Rachel.” greeted Penny as Rachel turned and looked at Penny or rather the human version of the Angel Penemue. She had been helping Josh walk by giving him support but had step away when the two siblings embraced. <br />
<br />
Rachel had only meet Penny two or three times, being disowened by their father made meeting up with her brother hard considering he was going to seminary school with a few of dad’s hardcore friend’s kids who would have reported back to him. Rachel always believed that the choice to become a preacher like their father had been forced upon her brother, but she hadn’t wanted to push it.<br />
<br />
Penny was short for a women, at least in her human form with long light brown hair which fell in curls around her shoulders. She had a small frame and small breasts which she kept well hidden behind a very modest pink blouse which now was stained with blood. She wore a pair of jeans with simple modest shoes, her skin was so pale from her times inside that even a small blush stood out a lot.  A golden cross necklace, a simple old fashion wristwatch and a pair of hopped ear rings where her only adornment aside from her thin wire glasses. Her thin glasses, gave her a sexy librarian look something that went very well with her brother look. It was almost as if they were made for each other. <br />
<br />
Their father hadn’t fully approved of Penny, at least not at first. Her main fault in the eyes of their father was that she wasn’t the daughter of another preacher, that was something he wanted for both of his kids. He also didn’t approve of Penny getting an education behind high school, he hadn’t approved of Rachel going to college either, but Penny had been accepted once he learned how she could read the bible in Greek and Hebrew and was studying an “acceptable” subject for women in education and library studies.<br />
<br />
“Penny, are you ok?” inquired Rachel as she hugged her as well. <br />
<br />
“Been better.” admitted Penny, as Rachel noticed the black and blue mark on Penny’s cheek right. “Congratulations by the way.”<br />
<br />
“Thanks. I guess we are weaving a very complex weave between all of us.” Stated Rachel<br />
<br />
“Yes, this is going to be a mess.” confirmed Penny “Can we come in?”<br />
<br />
“Of course.” said Rachel as she let them in and closed the door. “This is going to be one hell of a conversation.”</p>
