<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Warm light shown in from the window above the bed as the first being started to stir. Shelly/Badge opened their hazelnut colored eyes and laid there in her lovers embrace. Her keen ears could pick up the creek of the house as it warmed in the late autumn sunlight. Her right ear twitched as she picked up the miniscule scratching and titter. She then realized that this must have been a mouse under the floorboards. Instinctually Shelly/ Badge’s interest was peeked, however she still remained there. Nestling her fur against her lovers bare chest. Scents of their passionate love making still remained in the air for her adept sense of smell. She was amazed how sharp and clear everything had become. Part of here was amazed how vivid all of the colors were. And how miniscule dust particles shown up as blunt in the sun as a rabbit on snow. She was content, however as time wore on she started to think the past day’s events over. “What am I now?” “Obviously I not human, or canine, nor male or female.” That thought struck her not as strongly as it may of for other people. She took it as her scientific self, of intelligent canine puzzling out the answers or solutions. “Did I create a new Species?” That thought struck home. She laid there still not moving deep in her thoughts. “Was I the first one to successfully travel from one place to another unscathed?” She paused for a second then remarked. “Well maybe not unscathed, but I was successful.” Then she started to realize that it was only one voice and thought in her head that she was hearing. “I must of completely merged with this person. I mean canine, err…” It was true that she thought as one singular being, however she still retained all of the memories, and instincts from both sides. It was as if she had been both beings at the same time. “This is Incredible!” she shouted this time audibly. Quickly realizing that she had woken her lover she was quick to apologize as she had done on countless occasions when a revelation in her sleep woke her. “Sorry Rico.” “I didn’t mean to wake you honey”. Rico stretched and opened his eyes. He then yelped.  Quickly regaining his composure as the memories from last night washed upon him. “Sorry.” Rico apologized. This is going to take some getting used to. “Shelly let out a quick bark of laughter then covered her mouth embarrassed. This only resulted in Rico smiling as he commented. “Yep you still are cute, but that’s going to take some getting used to. Shelly/ Badge grinned showing all of the sharp teeth. Quickly Shelly suppressed the grin. “Here, let me make us breakfast.” He said getting up. He sidled over to the dresser and threw on some boxers, gym shorts, and a t-shirt that had a motorcyle on it. Come on babe he said reaching his hand down to Shelly. She reached out and gripped his callused hand with her tough paw like hands. He gently pulled her up onto her feet and turned heading for the door. “There is an old pair of gym shorts and boxers that you can take. Feel free to customize them how you see fit.” He commented as he headed for the kitchen. Shelly grabbed the boxers and gym shorts. She hadn’t ever used boxers before but after a bit of modifications with some scissors that she found they fit acceptably. She did the same with the gym shorts. She then retrieved one of her old work t-shirts that was normally too big for her, but fit without showing her new sheath. She then paused in horror. “How am I going to relieve myself?” But it was as if something down deep in herself was telling her on what to do. She walked over to the bathroom and proceeded to relieve herself. Wow this is much easier, no wonder why men are always thinking about their dicks. She remarked as she washed her hands. As Shelly continued to tidy her new self-up. Rico used the tasks of making breakfast, to process what his and his girlfriend new reality would be. He cracked the eggs into a frying pan and thought. “How can we live comfortably from now on?” “What will the reaction and acceptance of the people be?” The gears started turning as he tried to find a solution to their new predicament. Eventually, now noticing that the bacon was burning. He focused his mind on making breakfast. Shelly walked into the kitchen and the aromas of the food instantly started to make her mouth water. She then thought back on all of the times before that this had happened and he had been expected to ignore it and eat the foul smelling pellets that were placed in the bowl in the next room. Almost out of Habit she caught herself heading for the living room where the dog bowls were located. Instead she sat down at the kitchen table and stared at the glass of orange juice, that Rico had placed there for her. Again she paused, however yet again she felt like the response was natural. Still yet she did not respond to that instinct. Thinking of it to be embarrassing. She looked up and seen Rico still toiling with the items on the stove. She then tentatively lapped a couple swallows of the juice down her throat. The citrus flavor on her tongue was sharper then she remembered. However she still found it to be fresh, and tasted good. She sat there in her thoughts yet again remarking how sharp all of here senses were. Even the sizzling bacon sounded abnormally loud yet it sounded about normal. Deep in her thoughts, it wasn’t until she heard the sound of a plate being set in front of her that she stirred. Looking down she saw the perfectly over easy eggs, crispy bacon, and sourdough toast. All laid out in front of her. She looked up and saw that Rico had just sit down next to her. He gently grabbed her hand and looked her in the eyes and said. “I just want to let you know that I still love you, and I am with you until the end.” Shelly was not prepared for this and tears started to leak from her eyes as she reached over and hugged Rico. Holding him close. “There, there” Rico said in a comforting voice. Stroking here fur on the back of her head and neck. That seemed to sooth Shelly as she whimpered out an “I love you Rico.”</p>
