<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Aw, how flattering!&quot; said Sally with a giggle upon hearing that Jeff wanted to be a golden retriever like she had been.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, you know, if we&#39;re gonna basically swap, we might as well make it thorough,&quot; said Jeff.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, thorough would mean swapping genders, which admittedly we might have to try. But if my old breeds good enough for you, it&#39;s good enough for me!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t make it sound so nostalgic. You know as well as I do that we&#39;re swapping back right when the family pulls in the driveway, which could be hours from now but could also be any minute. I&#39;ll barely have time to break in that golden coat of yours.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Right, of course, swapping back as soon as they get home. That&#39;s the deal, right? Now, let me go ahead and enter the settings...&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff had to admit there was still something spooky about watching his former pet using his computer. It was even freakier to realize he was letting her use his own new software and accessories to change his species. She didn&#39;t even have her nudity left to remind a casual observer that she had ever been a pet. On some level, it was really starting to sink in that he was effectively being replaced. In a way, though, so was she.<br />
<br />
&quot;Um, Jeff? You might wanna get out of those clothes of yours. Technically, they&#39;re my clothes now, and I don&#39;t think I want a fully dressed dog, even if it is just for a few minutes.&quot;<br />
<br />
Her request took Jeff off guard. Sure, he&#39;d been naked in front of Sally before, during a quick change of clothes once in a while without thinking, but that wasn&#39;t when she was human. Of course, he wasn&#39;t going to be human much longer. If he was going to be the pet, for potentially the rest of the evening, he would have to be okay with being the one who didn&#39;t wear clothes in the relationship. Besides, Sally&#39;s reality change to his wardrobe meant that all the clothes in the room really were hers: Jeff&#39;s shirt was now a blouse, and his pants were women&#39;s pants, which felt uncomfortable on his male form. So he stripped.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, Sally how long is this gonna take?&quot; he asked, awkwardly baring it all in front of a woman whom nature had never intended to even be a woman. Before she could answer, he felt a sudden pain in his balls which suddenly went away. Looking down, he was shocked to find that his briefly cramped testicles no longer even existed and his penis had shrunk back to how it had looked before puberty. &quot;Hey, what&#39;s the big idea?&quot; he said in a higher pitched voice before covering his mouth his mouth, shocked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sh, it&#39;s okay, boy. It&#39;s perfectly normal that if you&#39;re going to be the family pet, you&#39;re going to have been fixed. The &#39;vac can bring it all back later, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
It was when she called him &quot;boy&quot; the first time that Jeff noticed she hadn&#39;t been calling him &quot;master&quot; for a while. He hoped she wasn&#39;t getting too in to this. He wanted to say something, but his tongue felt funny. Finally, he took his hands out of the way to open it, and a pink, vase-shaped curtain of flesh unfurled from between his lips.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh cool! You&#39;re panting,&quot; Sally commented. &quot;I bet it&#39;s a relief! I don&#39;t know why you always keep it like a sauna in here.&quot;<br />
<br />
The feel of his much larger tongue curling, flopping, and scattering drool everywhere came as a shock to the young man, and so did the urge to heave mouthfuls of air in and out. Sally was right, though, panting was a relief. In fact, the satisfaction almost made him flash her a wide grin with his open mouth, but the emotion unexpectedly took a detour down his spine to trigger an unfamiliar muscle spasm over his butt. His tailbone was moving! He craned his neck around, trying to see what had to be the start of his dog tail, but it was too short and too far down for him to get a good look. Sally giggle, though, watching him wag and seemingly chase his little nub.<br />
<br />
Jeff decided, admittedly against his better judgment, that this was all good thing after all. He&#39;d always been curious about what an animal feels, and even though he might never be able to look at Sally the same way again after this, his curiosity was starting to be satisfied. He also knew that the Chronivac worked as was thrilled by the power he had now, even if he was temporarily at the mercy of his pet. Watching his claws grow out was like a horror movie, but running his hands through the lush golden body hair he was sprouting made him smile--er, wag his slightly longer tail stub. Rubbing his own belly, he was surprised to find a variety of new nipples, albeit tiny underdeveloped ones as a neutered male. He eventually rubbed a place on his belly which tickled a little and made his leg kick out to the side, almost making him fall!<br />
<br />
&quot;Careful, boy, you&#39;ll be on four legs soon enough, but for now it might be tough to keep your balance.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hearing Sally&#39;s voice again made Jeff&#39;s ears twitch. Reaching up to feel them, he found his ears much longer, with lots of fluffy golden fuzz on the outside. He imagined he looked like a fuzzy elephant when he experimentally twitched them at will. As they got even wider, they lengthened, softened, and eventually buckled under their own weight, coming to a strangely cozy rest beside his cheeks. He played with them for a few minutes, fingering the sensitive loose skin of his cute, floppy dog ears. Before long, though, he found an even more pleasurable area just between his ears on the back of his head. He closed his eyes for a moment, scratching gently, moaning and wagging his tail. When he opened his eyes again, he realized that his stub felt bendier, his hips were feeling more recoil from wagging it, and he could see the movement of a gold-colored blur from the corner of his eye. Twisting around a bit, he saw that it was way more than just a stub now! His tail looked just like Sally&#39;s old one, and it was flailing around about as frantically as hers did whenever it was time to go for a walk. Watching it carefully and tuning himself into its rhythm, Jeff lunged at it with his hands, missing a couple of times before finally catching it. Still feeling the urge to wag it but unwilling to free it from within his grasp, very cautiously lay down on his bed to relax and properly examine his new appendage and maybe bask a little in his own satisfaction at having caught it. He held his bushy tail gingerly from in between his legs, marveling at how it felt to do so.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ya like that, boy?&quot; said Sally with a grin, watching her master eagerly achieve every puppy&#39;s most essential goal in life. &quot;If you want to play with it a while longer, we can always adjust reality and spend an extra week or two in these bodies with nobody knowing.&quot; Jeff snapped his head around to glare at her and growled. Sally put her hands up defensively, &quot;Just kidding, a deal&#39;s a deal. We&#39;ll figure out what else to do after we change back.&quot;<br />
<br />
I&#39;ll figure out what else to do! thought Jeff. I don&#39;t know why she thinks she&#39;s entitled to this Chronivac forever. I love her to the death, but she&#39;s got to understand she&#39;s really just my pet, and she won&#39;t be using my stuff without permission!<br />
<br />
The sensation of rough, patchy skin at against the long fur of his tail made Jeff let go of it and study at his hands more carefully in their own right. His pads were forming! Not only that, but it was getting a lot harder to move his fingers separately. Jeff doubted he could catch his tail with his hands a second time if he tried it: he would have to use his mouth like a dog does. Speaking of which, his mouth was much farther in front of his face than it used to be, and his nose had gone with it. His darkening nose moistened at the tip of his snout, and Jeff began to sniff the air. All the smells in the room were getting stronger! There was hair, fur, wood, plastic, skin oils, rodents, insulation, clothing, carpet, snack crumbs, and--and dog urine?! Had Sally peed in here without him knowing? Bad girl! Jeff had an unmistakable compulsion to find Sally&#39;s urine and put some of his own nearby, but he resisted. He didn&#39;t want to be a bad dog!<br />
<br />
Jeff was surprised that he didn&#39;t lose as much of his color vision as he expected. He&#39;d always believed that dogs saw in black and white, but apparently he was wrong. All the colors in his room seemed off somehow, and everything around him was a tad blurrier, but he could still see that his ceiling was blue and his computer casing was red--or does it look green now, or yellow? Jeff realized he couldn&#39;t tell every color apart, he wasn&#39;t entirely colorblind. It wouldn&#39;t matter too much, because it was going to be hard to focus on sights with the sensitivity of his doggy nose. It was still twitching rapidly at the end of his snout, desperately tempting him him to take a closer whiff of that urine. The Chronivac dinged, and Sally walked over and gave Jeff&#39;s furry head a rub, carefully putting a new leather collar around the neck of her new doggy.</p>
