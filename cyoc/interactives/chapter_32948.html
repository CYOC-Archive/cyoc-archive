<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Once Rick and his new mother were in the living room his new father said &quot;Stan is coming for dinner.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's wonderful!&quot; his mother said. &quot;Hannah can meet her uncle. Is he brining Sherry with him?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No he isn't&quot; his father said.<br />
<br />
&quot;That's too bad&quot; his mother said. &quot;When will Stan arrive?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He should be orbing in anytime now&quot; his father said.<br />
<br />
Before Rick could ask what his father had said some tiny blue-white balls appeared and coalesced into a figure. This figure was made of the same light as the balls and it was floating a little bit off the floor. It settled down to the floor and the light faded reveling a man. The whole process only took a second to complete.<br />
<br />
Jenny ran up and hugged this man saying &quot;Hi Uncle Stan!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello Jenny&quot; Stan said. &quot;Hello Tom, Pattie.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello Stan&quot; Rick's father and mother said.<br />
<br />
&quot;And here is my new niece&quot; Stan said. &quot;Hello Hannah.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rick was still a bit stunned by Stan orbing in and didn't say anything.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hannah sweetie, say something&quot; his mother said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, hi&quot; Rick said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Forgive her Stan&quot; his mother said. &quot;She hasn't seen someone orb before.<br />
<br />
&quot;I have seen it&quot; Rick said. &quot;It was a special effect on the TV show 'Charmed'. It was also called orbing on the show.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well then why didn't you say something?&quot; his father asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Two reasons&quot; Rick said. &quot;Seeing someone orb in real life is a lot different than seeing a special effect on TV. The second reason is I don't know him and I had always been a little shy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I can understand that&quot; his mother said. &quot;I should introduce you then. This is your Uncle Stan, he's my brother.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Now what happened to make you my niece?&quot; Stan asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;It was the Medallion of Zulo Stan&quot; Rick's father said.<br />
<br />
&quot;That can't be&quot; Stan said. &quot;The medallions don't alter reality.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It was the one that was changed&quot; Rick's mother said.<br />
<br />
&quot;But that's not possible&quot; Stan said. &quot;It was the rantings of an old woman.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's true&quot; Rick's mother said. &quot;Hannah described the medallion.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Where is it now?&quot; Stan asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;We think that the brotherhood has it&quot; Rick's father said.<br />
<br />
&quot;So you can't get it back&quot; Stan said. &quot;That's too bad, we could have proved it's existence.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There's nothing we can do now&quot; Rick's mother said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well if you still had it you'd be able to change her back&quot; Stan said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't want to change back&quot; Rick said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Most people would want to change back&quot; Stan said. &quot;It's unusual when someone doesn't want to change back.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I'm sorry I'm so unusual&quot; Rick said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't talk like that Hannah&quot; his mother said sternly.<br />
<br />
&quot;How old were you before Hannah?&quot; Stan asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thirty-four&quot; Rick said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dropped thirty years then&quot; Stan said. &quot;Well that explains the attitude.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm going to go fix dinner&quot; Rick's mother said. &quot;Why don't you teach Hannah how to shield herself Tom.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good idea&quot; Rick's father said. &quot;Do you want to help Stan?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure thing&quot; Stan said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok Hannah&quot; his father said. &quot;Now what you need to do is picture a light around you. It can be any shape or color you want. The easiest shape to do is an oval. Try to relax while focusing on the shield.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rick focused on a blue crystal like structure surrounding him and to his surprise he saw it surround him. Then he saw Stan create a ball of energy in his hand and throw it at him. The ball hit the shield and continued to hit him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ow!&quot; he shouted as an electrical jolt ran through his body. &quot;Why did you do that Uncle Stan?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You called me uncle&quot; his uncle said. &quot;I'm sorry but we had to test your shield and it looked stronger than that. I'll go easier next time.&quot;<br />
<br />
They spent the next fifteen minutes practicing Rick's shield. A few of his uncle's energy balls made it through and each one sent a jolt through his body when they did. He did improve his shield though.<br />
<br />
After they were done Rick's mother came in and said &quot;Dinner's ready.&quot;<br />
<br />
They had steak, rolls, baked potatoes, green beans, and salad.<br />
<br />
Rick's mother gave him a little bit of salad, some green beans, a quarter of a baked potato, a small roll, and some steak. She started to cut up his steak then stopped.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sorry&quot; she said. &quot;I forgot that you can do this yourself.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's ok&quot; Rick said, &quot;besides you should continue like you would. If we go out and I'm using a sharp knife, people will wonder what kind of parents you are.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok I'll continue&quot; his mother said.<br />
<br />
&quot;At least she can still reason&quot; his uncle said. &quot;I never asked what gender you were.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I was male&quot; Rick said.<br />
<br />
&quot;It must be strange being a four year old girl&quot; his uncle said.<br />
<br />
&quot;It is a bit strange&quot; Rick said.<br />
<br />
The rest of the dinner passed with small talk. After dinner Stan said good bye and orbed out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok girls&quot; Rick's mother said, &quot;time for your bath and bed.&quot;<br />
<br />
In the bathroom Jenny helped Rick take off his dress.<br />
<br />
Rick was surprised that Jenny took off her dress too. &quot;Are you getting in too Jenny?&quot; he asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course I am&quot; Jenny replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why?&quot; Rick asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;We've always taken a bath together&quot; Jenny said. Then seeing the confused look on Rick's face she said, &quot;Oh I forgot that you don't have memories of being Hannah. You see since we're sisters and go to bed at the same time, Mom figured that it would be best that we take a bath at the same time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok I see&quot; Rick said.<br />
<br />
After their bath they went to their rooms to go to sleep.<br />
<br />
Rick's mother came in to help him get ready for bed. After getting Rick into his night gown she asked &quot;What story would you like tonight?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What do I have?&quot; Rick asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;That's right, you don't know what you have&quot; his mother said. &quot;I'll pick one for you then. How about 'Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs'?&quot; she asked pulling down a book.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sounds good to me&quot; Rick said.<br />
<br />
As his mother was reading the story to him, Rick began to nod off. By the time she finished he was fast asleep.<br />
<br />
Sometime during the night Rick wet himself.</p>
