<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>EDIT: Did some cleaning up. I was half-asleep when I posted it and got sloppy</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Troy blinked away the bright light as he came back to the real world.<br />
<br />
He shook his head feeling a strange sense of vertigo and stayed in the chair until his head stopped spinning. It was so odd going there and coming back again. Not bad, per se, but very disconcerting. He was sure he’d just get used to it. The VR was super realistic, too, he swore everything was so detailed and he couldn’t even see the HUD overlay that he should have while in it. <br />
<br />
As the world came back into focus, he moved his arm and paused. His body felt lighter, more flexible. The hulking muscles he had before he sat down had deflated into something more defined and manageable. <br />
<br />
He looked up at Mark as the DM fiddled with the time setting on the game so it would be morning when the players woke up. The Rhox looked down at the table and watched their characters performing their declared actions almost robotically. His character didn’t have rings around his horns anymore and Drake no longer wears a bracelet.<br />
<br />
“Hey Troy!” Dustin exclaimed,and Troy felt a paw slap his back. Dustin wagged his tail.“Welcome back to the land of the living!”<br />
<br />
Troy broke off his attention from the game board and turned to joke around with his friend and paused.<br />
<br />
Dustin’s fur coat had spots on it and was scruffier, tail shorter. Even his muscles had grown, back beginning to hunch. He was looking less like a wolf-dog and more like…a gnoll. He cocked his head, and Troy realized he was staring.<br />
<br />
“What’s wrong Troy? You look like you’ve seen a ghost.”<br />
<br />
“No! It’s, uh, just adjusting to the lag between the game and the real world, that’s all.” Troy babbled. Dustin’s fur had a faint salty smell, as though he’d spent time near an ocean, and his clothes stunk of the bar they’d just come from. His clothes had shifted from a t-shirt and jeans to desert robes over a loose tunic and trousers.<br />
<br />
Troy’s mouth went dry. He took a swig from the canteen he wore at his side. And paused mid-chug. Why was he carrying a canteen?<br />
<br />
“Are you sure that’s all? You’re looking a bit pale.”<br />
<br />
Troy pulled his gaze away, but not before he saw the half-gnoll gesture to a snack on the table, open his mouth, and the snack appeared on his tongue. He stared as the half-gnoll continued to teleport his snacks into his mouth. Could Dustin always do that? Troy knew Dustin had declared his subclass immediately at the start of the game. Did he choose it because he had those skills in real life?<br />
<br />
Troy took another swig from his canteen. He took a deep breath through his nose and blew it out his mouth, centering his mind and calming himself, as his master had taught him. When his heart-rate normalized, he began to think. If Dustin had changed this much, what about the others?<br />
<br />
He looked in Drake’s direction and sighed in relief. At least he was still human, though he may have been a bit shorter than Troy remembered, and was cuddling a strange mechanical device in his hands. He seemed excited, yet mildly disappointed, looking around at the other players at the table. It was like he’d expected the changes. Drake dug into the bulkier bag at his side and produced a specialized tool, adjusting his little clockwork companion.<br />
<br />
Jeremiah looked taller, muscles bulging, giving him a much brawnier look, his Great Dane features had started receding, making him look a bit like a were-dog. He laid back in his chair and heard it creak under his new weight. The chair shifted, growing larger, big metal struts extending from the frame, reinforcing it. He reached out with a longer arm and grabbed a huge handful of popcorn from a bowl near Greg and gulped it down in one bite.<br />
<br />
“Come on, man! I know you half-giants need to eat a lot more, but make sure we have enough for everyone!” Greg said, his voice deepening and quavering, as though he’d suddenly aged.<br />
<br />
Troy turned his attention to Greg.  <br />
<br />
Greg was shorter and now sported a gut instead of bulging muscles. He looked older, skin rough and weathered, little wrinkles appearing on the corners of his eyes. A small pair of glasses appear on his nose and  his hair grew subdued and grayed, gaining a more salt-and-pepper look. His chinstrap beard filled out his face, giving him a fluffy moustache, and then grew longer, reaching down to the gentle rise of his new belly. The orc lost himself in studying the campaign notes he’d neglected to read before they started playing. He adjusted himself as his clothes became more flowing, embroidery inscribing itself on his tunic and trousers, linen becoming fine silk. <br />
<br />
With a gesture, a ghostly hand appeared and carried some popcorn from the bowl over to him. He snacked on it casually, as though having a magic hand deliver him food was the most natural thing in the world. His hairline receded into a widow’s peak. <br />
<br />
“Guys, guys, let’s not fight! It isn’t a big deal, I can get more snacks from the front counter.” Lancer said, his voice commanding. “There’s enough popcorn for everyone, really.”<br />
<br />
Troy turned to Lancer and blinked.<br />
<br />
Lancer’s brown mane was streaked with gold, the fur on his body had lightened to almost the same white fur coat his character had. Lancer’s mien appeared more regal, his presence more commanding.  <br />
<br />
“I don’t know about you guys, but I think I’m ready to choose my subclass.” Drew smirked. “If you’ve finished bitching, that is.”<br />
<br />
Drew was thinner, though the otter-man was still chubby. The knife he was tossing in the air was new. His knife skills seemed on par with the game world’s as he caught it between his fingers with ease. He seemed more alert than the others, looking at the others and then Drake. Troy could tell the otter had caught on that something was off, that reality had changed. Drew seemed to realize he was holding a knife he hadn’t owned before and pulled at his looser clothing with a worried expression on his face.<br />
<br />
“Actually, Drew, I was just about to ask. Level 3 is coming up.” Mark said, brushing his long red hair behind his pointed elven ears. <br />
<br />
Troy realized Mark had changed, though not as blatantly as the others. His thin elven form seemed more muscular, sure, but it was the confidence in his tone that had changed. He had a commanding presence that rivaled Lancer’s, now..<br />
<br />
Drew flicked his finger and a screen popped up in the middle of the table that showed each of their character sheets. Every detail of their characters, from their alignment to their heights, age, and weights were displayed there along with their equipment. a screen as each one of their character sheet are out in the open. Every detail of their character from alignment to height, age and weight is there with their equipment. In his, Drew’s and Drake’s equipment list, there were three ‘???’ marks. Those must be the Books, registered to the game. At least it kept those items a mystery and he wouldn’t have to worry about his secret being leaked. <br />
<br />
“Any thoughts on what subclasses you guys wanna pick?” Mark asked.<br />
<br />
The table went quiet in thought. This would have the biggest effect on their character’s play styles. Drew grinned as he flipped through his available subclasses. Drake smiled as well, having already planned on which direction he would go. Everyone locked in their looks and adjusted the holographic representations of their characters.<br />
<br />
None of them were making their characters ugly, to Troy’s relief. He’d hate to have to explain why that was a bad idea. Greg had made himself a little fatter, more portly, adding a cool-looking pipe and a few non-magical signet rings to his character.  Jeremiah wanted to get even bigger, but Drew had stopped him, told him that it would heavily affect prices for his weapons and clothes. He settled on 8 feet tall, the shortest he could go so that he wouldn’t have to pay triple for everything. <br />
<br />
Drew himself had made his character rakishly handsome, giving him sculpted abs and well-defined muscles. His clothes were light and loose. By the time he finished, his character looked like a rather dashing (if a bit flamboyant) pirate.<br />
<br />
Drake adjusted the designs of his steel defender and made his armor seem more like it was scavenged from robot parts. His backstory now involved him finding a crashed space ship out in the desert and getting beamed in the brain by an AI, which was why he was so intelligent.<br />
<br />
Troy reduced his character’s size and deflated some of his overly-bulky muscles. Hopefully making him more twink-like would attract Lancer’s waning affection. Unfortunately, Rhox just didn’t look good as skinny monks.<br />
<br />
Lancer idly tweaked his character’s  face, subtly making it thicker and more masculine. The rest of him was already perfect. He glanced over at Troy’s character and frowned.<br />
<br />
Troy wondered for a moment on why Lancer was focused on Troy’s character and not his own. Lancer sighed and turned away from Troy’s sheet and submitted his own without a thought. Of course he wouldn’t change his character because his background was his own. Lancer was roleplaying as himself.<br />
<br />
Lancer’s muzzle wrinkled in a strange way and he crossed his arms, tufted tail flicking agitatedly behind him.<br />
<br />
Troy knew what that meant. <br />
<br />
Lancer was bothered with Troy’s chosen species. A Rhox was a far cry from the soft, cute humans he liked. Even if they were damn good as monks. He’d actually wanted to play as a human, originally, but Troy had talked him to stay Leonin because of how strong they were as paladins. He was much more happy when Troy was a boring old human.<br />
<br />
“Actually.” Troy licked his lips, “I was thinking going Kensai with the Gunner Feat, if you’ll allow it.”<br />
<br />
Mark blinked then laughed. “Yeah! Gun-fu bro, that sounds awesome!”<br />
<br />
“And…I also wanted to know if I could change my race. Go Variant Human.” Troy added.<br />
<br />
“Right,” Mark nodded and bit his lip. “For the free feat. Normally, I wouldn’t allow it…”<br />
<br />
Troy sighed. He’d wanted to change it so Lancer would be happy, at least. His ears lowered and his muzzle frowned. Mark watched Troy’s reaction and bit his lip, looking around the table.<br />
<br />
“But you know what?” Mark said quickly, “This is your first game and I want you to have fun. So sure.”<br />
<br />
“Thanks man.” Troy smiled. “You don’t know how much I appreciate it.”<br />
<br />
“Right, I’ll adjust your stats and stuff.” Mark brought up his HUD, his long fingers flickering rapidly through the air. Troy watched his miniature as it rotated in the air above the able, Rhox features receding, slowly transforming into a ruggedly handsome human with a dark tan that made it clear that he spent a lot of time under the sun. “Done. But no more changes. It’s going to be a pain if everyone wants to change their race. So is there anything else you want to change?”<br />
<br />
“Um, obviously my description and backstory are going to change slightly. Maybe an Kansas Smith-style explorer and adventurer who hunts down artifacts for people.”<br />
<br />
“Right.” Mark’s fingers flickered. “Archaeologist and rugged good looks. You’re a guy who works with temples to return their artifacts. Handgun and whip proficiency?”<br />
<br />
“Nah, bayonets. I’m going dual-wielding.”<br />
<br />
“Gotcha. Wanna make yours and Lancer’s backstories…a couple?” Mark asked.<br />
<br />
“Yes,” Troy said, relieved.<br />
<br />
He’d almost forgotten to suggest that.<br />
<br />
Mark resumed typing. “That’ll be done soon.”<br />
<br />
That was one crisis averted. But now he had to deal with Lancer. Or Hasta, as he would likely know himself as the longer they kept playing.<br />
<br />
“That’s Troy done. Jeremiah, what subclass are you going for?”<br />
<br />
“Totem Barbarian.”Jeremeiah flexed his muscles and grinned. “As if there’s a better choice!”<br />
<br />
“Alright, Greg?”<br />
<br />
“Chronurgy.” Greg said, pushing his glasses up his nose.<br />
<br />
“Okay. Dustin?”<br />
<br />
“Horizon Walker.” Dustin said, teleporting popcorn into his mouth between bites.<br />
<br />
“Great. Drew?”<br />
<br />
“Uh, I actually want to change one of my backstories to corsair. That can replace criminal. And I want to sew better, so a background that does that.”<br />
<br />
“Okay, I suppose that’s fair, since I gave Troy the option to change his character. Subclass?”<br />
<br />
“Swashbuckler.” Drew grinned and held his knife out like a sword and thrust it in the air like it was a saber.<br />
<br />
“Cool, just don’t play with your knife like that at the table.” Mark said, backing away from the overly-enthusiastic otter. <br />
<br />
“Fine” Drew pouted but sheathed his knife and sat back down in his custom seat. he sit down on his custom seat. The otter fidgeted in his seat, staring at his clothes in agitation. He was clearly eager to leave.<br />
<br />
“And Drake?”<br />
<br />
“Armorer.” Drake smiled, not looking up from his steel defender as he played with it.<br />
<br />
“Sweet. Lance?”<br />
<br />
“Order of the Crown.” Lancer said, seemingly more alert. He turned to Troy and smiled. “Icarian’s boyfriend.”<br />
<br />
“And that is.” Mark’s finger slowed and stopped as it finished making changes to the characters, updating them. “It. Going to take a while before it finishes updating. So go ahead and take your bathroom breaks. We resume in half an hour. Okay?”<br />
<br />
Everyone nodded.<br />
<br />
Mark stood up and stretched.<br />
<br />
Everyone else did the same. As soon as everyone get up, Drew left in a hurry. A few seconds later, Troy heard a door slam somewhere in the store. He glanced at Mark.<br />
<br />
“Bathroom. It’s at the end of the rooms.” Mark explained.<br />
<br />
“Ah.”<br />
<br />
Troy saw a message from Mark on his HUD. He tapped it and opened the notification. <br />
<br />
WHAT DID YOU CHANGE HIM INTO THIS TIME? HE SEEMS RESTLESS.<br />
<br />
Troy looked over at Mark and shrugged.<br />
<br />
I DIDN’T DO ANYTHING TO HIM, THE GAME IS CHANGING US<br />
<br />
Mark cocked a brow.<br />
<br />
IN WHAT WAY?<br />
<br />
Tory sighed.<br />
<br />
DUSTIN IS TURNING INTO A GNOLL<br />
<br />
Mark frowned.<br />
<br />
HE’S NOT A GNOLL NORMALLY?<br />
<br />
Troy shook his head.<br />
<br />
NO. THAT’S WHY I CHOSE HUMAN<br />
<br />
Mark looked confused.<br />
<br />
WAIT, SO YOU WERE A HUMAN ORIGINALLY AND THE GAME CHANGED YOU?<br />
<br />
Troy frowned.<br />
<br />
NO. LOOK MAN, I’LL NEED TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT THAT LATER, CAUSE, UH, I MAY HAVE BROKE REALITY A BIT. YOU CAN’T CHANGE YOURSELF, REMEMBER?<br />
<br />
Mark nodded.<br />
<br />
WELL, YOU CAN BUT…<br />
<br />
Troy smirked.<br />
<br />
-BUT EVERYONE WILL KNOW.<br />
<br />
…<br />
<br />
…<br />
<br />
Mark’s eyes widened.<br />
<br />
OH. OH SHIT, TROY! YEAH, HIT ME UP AFTER THE GAME AND TELL ME ALL ABOUT IT<br />
<br />
Drake stood and stretched, his spine popping. <br />
<br />
Troy looked over at him. Now that he saw him standing, Troy knew without a doubt Drake had shrunk by at least 6 inches. Drake looked down at himself and frowned, not seeing any changes. Except for his baggier clothes and height he was still the same. The look of disappointment was clear on his face. Drake placed his steel guardian on top of his head and made to leave.<br />
<br />
“Drake?” Troy called.<br />
<br />
“Yes?” Drake paused and turned to Troy. “What’s up, man?”<br />
<br />
“Why…” Troy licked his lips, trying to think of a way to ask him how his table was changing everyone. “You know what, never mind. I’ll…ask you later.”<br />
<br />
“See you later then, I guess.” Drake smiled and left.<br />
<br />
Troy got up, stretching, and followed him. If he was going to transform him, now was as good a time as any.<br />
<br />
As Tory walked through the store, he noticed it had altered to fit their game station. The door he dust left had a Do Not Disturb sign hanging on it. There were many games that had updated to work with his HUD. There were tons of Myths milling about the store now with datajacks glittering against their temples. <br />
<br />
A new feature was a stairway that went upstairs. He could smell something cooking. The store had grown taller as well. A dragon the size of a horse walked in and bought an anime figure, leaving with it clutched in his greedy claws. A human and an anthro were playing a card game. With Troy’s HUD active, he could see the card animate in VR. It made the whole game much more lively.<br />
<br />
As much as he wanted to see more, he wanted to find Drake. It took him a few minutes, but he finally found the human as Drake wandered around the aisles, looking at the geek paraphernalia with an odd smile on his face. He appeared to be a big fan of the comic superhero Metal Man. Every once in a while, he would pull something off the shelf and inspect it before putting it back. Troy stalked him from row to row. He would watch him whisper something as the store content increased with more items from many different media than even he himself would buy if he was into that stuff.<br />
<br />
Troy waited for the opportune moment, checking to make sure no one was looking at him. They were in the very back of the store. Most of the players were more focused on the card games or the rest of the shop.<br />
<br />
When Drake bent over to look at a cool-looking board-game that cost nearly two hundred dollars, Troy struck.<br />
<br />
“Lesser Shift.” Troy pointed at the crouching man and whispered.<br />
<br />
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=<br />
<br />
Drake was crouched down, checking out a boardgame that was very overpriced, when it suddenly started growing heavier.  He struggled to hold it up before he finally had to drop it and stared. The skin of his arms had developed a bumpy, reddened complexion. Drake was mixed parts of surprise, joy, and shocked.<br />
<br />
He went to stand but he barely managed to stand, the world rising around him. Drake squeaked with joy as the inches continued to fall from his frame. His clothes started to look like blankets on him. Drake’s smile fell as his pants dropped around his feet, showing off his five inch dick. <br />
<br />
He thought he heard someone chuckling and quickly picked up his pants and start running towards the bathrroom with his now-oversized clothes, red with growing scales and embarrassment. No one seemed to notice or care about the increasingly nude kobold.<br />
<br />
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br />
<br />
Drew finished his business in the bathroom and moved to the sink, pulling the stool over so he could reach it.<br />
<br />
He was weirded out by how off he’d acted with Troy today. Drew had found himself irresistibly horny around him and the whole nuzzling and cuddling thing he’d done after propositioning the huge rhino made him cringe. It felt like he had become an entirely different person. Try as he might, he couldn’t deny he <I>liked</I> that. If there was anyone in the world he hated most, it was himself.<br />
<br />
“Modify.” He said, thinking about the whole incident.<br />
<br />
And none of the cringe dialogue ever occurred.  At least to him. He’d need to modify Troy’s memory and maybe Mark’s, too. He doesn’t want them to tell the others about what he did. It was all just way too gay for him. The worst part of it was, he kind of wished that Troy <I>had</I> plowed him. But he also felt that forcing Troy to cheat on his boyfriend was wrong.<br />
<br />
The otter diligently washed his hands and caught a glimpse of himself in the mirror. Something looked different about him. He couldn’t put his finger on<br />
<br />
Was his hair a little longer on the top? Almost like a faux hawk…a blue and pink colored one. That was silly, he was sure it had always been like that. Aww, wait, that’s right! He’d styled it that way before he came here. He made sure his hairstyle is in place and did a finger gun pose in the mirror.<br />
<br />
But why had he styled it like that? And why did he just pose like that? It looked gay.<br />
<br />
,i>And what was wrong with that?</I> A high, soft voice whispered in the back of his head. <I>Its not like its bad with such a cute guy like you.</I><br />
<br />
His face was still cute, although there was a mischievous, almost playful shift in his features. A sort of masculinity that made him look rather rakish. His eyes had changed to the aquamarine blue of the ocean. There was also the refreshing scent of sea salt on his body.<br />
<br />
His shirt grew tighter, squeezing the air out of his lungs. It felt like it was for someone a few sizes smaller in the chest department.<br />
<br />
Drew placed his hands on the counter as he experienced what he could only describe as a hot flash. The shirt grew less and less constricting as his body fat melted away. He moaned as the muscles on his now-thin body flexed, pecs growing, gently lifting his shirt as they grew more defined. The little otter’s abs tightened and thickened, leaving a cobblestone path to his cock.<br />
<br />
“Wha-what’s happening?” Drew asked.<br />
<br />
Not that he was too upset about it. He looked downright sexy now. Like an athletic twink.<br />
<br />
Drew paused.<br />
<br />
What the hell was a twink?<br />
<br />
<i>That’s what you are.</I> The high voice spoke again. <I>A gay twink.</I><br />
<br />
“N-no, I’m not! I’m not gay!” Todd snarled back, panting.<br />
<br />
There was a sudden weight in his paw and he found himself gripping a designer cologne-one of the magical ones that enhanced attractiveness. He suddenly remembered asking Drake to make some for him whenever he got the chance. As he panted, he realized he could smell the cologne in the air around him. It was a spicy citrus scent that was oddly alluring, like ocean water and florals. Masculine yet feminine, just like him.<br />
<br />
Drew shook his head, trying to shake the strange thoughts that were filling his mind.<br />
<br />
Getting rid of the thoughts proved difficult, because it turned out he was not immune to the magically enhanced cologne. A single whiff of the magically enhanced had his cock grow so stiff in his pants that it ached. When it was at full mast, a pressure bore down upon. His dick started to dwindle and shrink, thinning, going from almost a foot long to a petite four inches.<br />
<br />
“No!” Drew gasped, reaching for his cock, trying to keep it the big, meaty member it had been. Literally the only thing he’d liked about his transformation was dwindling in his hands. “Please, not my cock!”<br />
<br />
<i>Cute gay boys don’t need big cocks.</I> The strange voice in his head whispered. <I>You’re a bottom, after all.</I><br />
<br />
“I-” Drew blinked, mind filling with strange memories of lusting after boys and not girls. “I’m gay?”<br />
<br />
<i>Yes.</I><br />
<br />
“I’m not-!” His balls were suddenly squeezed tight. “Oh!”<br />
<br />
Drew felt nauseous as his testicles began to shrink, going from the size of goose eggs to grapes. He moaned as excess cum oozed from the tip of his petite dick, causing a very obvious wet stain spread across the front of his pants. His genitals had shifted from over-sized to perfectly proportionate for his little body. His ass, which was flat now without any fat, swelled and stretched the seat of his pants, rounding into a perfect bubble as more muscles inflated it.<br />
<br />
The otter stared at the perfect otter twink in the mirror. A grin spread across his face. Who wouldn’t want to have a go with a sexy guy when he had a cute tush like his?<br />
<br />
“I’m gay!” Drew declared, voice higher and softer, flexing his abs and giving his bubbly booty a shake. <I>Yes, a cute twinky bottom.</I> The voice said. Drew realized the voice in his head had been his all along.<br />
<br />
It felt like a weight had lifted off his chest. Drew brushed his hair from out of his eyes as the cumstain down the front of his pants disappeared, evaporating in an instant. At the same time, Drew’s Book disappeared from the counter and reappeared as a pretty earring that dangled from his right ear. His clothes were loose, the top two button of his shirt undone so he could show off his chest.<br />
<br />
The little gay otter flicked the earring, smiled at his cute muzzle, and hopped off the stool, hoping he could find someone to give him a quick fuck before the game restarted.<br />
<br />
He opened the door and found a cute little kobold looking up at him. The kobold held hugely oversized clothes in its tiny little arms. It looked up at the otter and its scales grew redder as it tried to hide it’s erection with its pants.<br />
<br />
Drew grinned. Perfect.<br />
<br />
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br />
<br />
Drake had wondered why the changes had started now. Did the others change so quickly because they were already their race? He wanted to dwell more on the mystery but he was growing increasingly nude.<br />
<br />
The store around him was changing, adjusting to fit creatures of many sizes. His red skin grew more scaly and he began to lose muscle mass. Fear and excitement threatened to overwhelm him as he watch his nose slowly push out into a small red muzzle. His nose flattened and darkened, becoming black and wet like a dog. Halfway to the bathroom, his legs shifted and twisted, sending him into a shelf as his body became digitigrade.<br />
<br />
When he got to the door, he discovered that the door knobs had changed. There were 3, each set at a different height. <br />
<br />
The kobold yelped as his spine extruded a small tail, tiny spikes racing up its length and running up Tory’s back. Drake felt the muscles swell and wagged it, making his pants fall down. He stood almost nude, wondering if that was exactly as intended. His cock was nestle din a reptilian slit. <br />
<br />
His body fat moved around, going to his ass and hips. Drake’s eyes itched as they became glowing and yellow. A nictitating membrane covered hem. He reached for a knob.<br />
<br />
Drew was surprised when he reached out to turn the knob and  the door opened. He really didn’t want anyone looking at him right now. When the door opened, he looked up and saw Drew, who stood a foot and half taller than he did.<br />
<br />
“Hey there.” Drew said, voice high and soft, a smirk playing at the edge of his lips.<br />
<br />
“Uh, Drew?” Drake asked, staring at the thinner and decidedly gayer looking otter. “What happened to you?” <br />
<br />
The otter had gone from a chubster to a twink in the five minutes since he’d entered the bathroom. He was thin and muscular, shirt form fitting, pecs gently pressing the shirt. The fur on his head had grown out into a stylish, curled mane, bleached white and streaked. with pink and blue. There was a pretty earring dangling from his right ear.<br />
<br />
A strange, alluring scent flowed from the rakish looking twink. The tiny kobold’s dick slid from his slit and sprang erect almost instantly. The otter smiled down at him. Drake thought he was incredibly cute and found the scent intoxicating.<br />
<br />
“You look like you could use some help, babe.” The otters leaned against the arch of the door.<br />
<br />
“Babe?” The kobold yipped. “Uh, I don’t know you.”<br />
<br />
“You don’t know your boyfriend?” Drew gave him a roguish grin and raised a brow.<br />
<br />
“No. We couldn’t be together anyways, because you’re way…too…big?” Drake trailed off, staring at Drew’s crotch.<br />
<br />
Where once the little otter’s shorts had bulged obscenely with his immense package, there was now only a gentle swell.<br />
<br />
“Big?” Drew chuckled. “Matter of perspective, I guess?”<br />
<br />
Drake wondered if this was some strange reality shift. He’d experienced one himself when he turned his friend into a robotic servant completely on accident and no one ever believed he’d existed in the first place. He couldn’t let the otter continue to suffer under the delusion of a falsely imposed reality.<br />
<br />
“Someone turned me into a kobold!” Drake blurted.<br />
<br />
“And that’s why you aren’t wearing any clothes? Not because you wanted to, um, you know. But because they fell off when you shrunk?” Drew asked, confused.<br />
<br />
Drake nodded shyly.<br />
<br />
Drew blinked. “Ah. Then I’m very confused and disappointed…um. Shit!”<br />
<br />
“You believe me?” Drake said, disbelieving.<br />
<br />
“Yes. Someone turned me into an otter…At least I think they did…” Drew paused and shook his head. “Was I always gay?”<br />
<br />
“No.” Drake said firmly. “Though you are very hot and I would totally date you. But you weren’t gay. And you did walk into the room and complain about someone turning you into an otter. Is that a cologne? Because it is so good just smelling it makes my dick hard.”<br />
<br />
“Okeanos, I had it custom ordered. But I guess that’s part of the reality shift?”<br />
<br />
The kobold nodded.<br />
<br />
“Sorry if it’s got you all hot and bothered. Want me to leave?” The otter actually looked apologetic.<br />
<br />
“Actually, I was going to try and get a look at myself.” The little kobold said shyly. “But, uh…”<br />
<br />
“You’re too short to reach the counter, huh?”<br />
<br />
Drake nodded.<br />
<br />
“Come on, I’ll lift you up.” Drew smiled.<br />
<br />
The tiny kobold blushed but held out his hands.<br />
<br />
Drew’ gently lifted him up with ease, making Drake feel vulnerable. Yet, strangely enticing as well. He gazed up at the smiling otter, smelled his cologne and minty breath. He wished he could stay in the otter’s arms all day. <br />
<br />
The otter hopped easily up onto the stool. <br />
<br />
As Drake stared at himself in the mirror, held aloft by the sexy otter, his heart fluttered.<br />
<br />
“I wish I could remember all my dates with you.” Drake said miserably.<br />
<br />
“Oh, I don’t think that will be an issue.” Drew smiled happily. “You’re a lovesick Fool, after all. I’ll tell you all about my False memories.”<br />
<br />
Drake felt new memories form in his mind of all the dates he’d gone on with Drew. He’d almost been run over by a car that couldn’t sse him and Drew had scooped him up in his arms like he was doing now. Their first date was going to the seaside and eating freshly caught streamed clams. More dinner dates. Drake loved going out with Drew, showing his handsome otter to all his friends.<br />
<br />
He licked his lips, suddenly noticing that Drew’s cock was hard and throbbing.<br />
<br />
“Uh, Drew, can I…” Drake pointed at the otter’s quivering erection.<br />
<br />
“Sure babe.” Drew smirked, pulling down his pants. His dick sprung out and swelled to full mast. <br />
<br />
Drake leaned forward, his face already at the perfect size to suck cock.<br />
<br />
Drew smiled and watched as Drake’s forked tongue tentatively flicked out and started licking the tip of his dick. Drake’s eyes widened, clearly enjoying the taste of precum. The little kobold’s hand began to rub and pump the little pink love stick, trying to coax more of that delicious pre into his eager jaws.<br />
<br />
The otter thought the pace was fine, but Drake was clearly ill-experienced and not used to gay sex at all. <br />
<br />
“You have False memories of being an amazing cock sucker, right babe?” Drew grinned, watching the kobold’s yellow eyes widen for a second, processing the false memories of all the best blowjobs Drew had ever given, and then the kobold leaned forward and engulfed Drew’s turgid cock. “I Suggest you take your time and really enjoy it.”<br />
<br />
Drake was having the time of his life. His maw was practically built to take Drew’s cock, the perfect size and shape. His tongue played along the otter’s pink shaft, savoring its musky scent, the delectable stream of precum. Inwardly, he knew that the more they both gave in to the changes, the harder it would be to change back.<br />
<br />
He wanted to warn Drew to be careful with what he said. The second he tried to back off from the lovely cock, Drew grabbed his horns and pulled him close, right up to the otter-man’s musky pubic fur. The kobold’s little black dog nose snuffled and nuzzled the otter’s groin as he bobbed.<br />
<br />
Drake wanted to bat the hands away but his mouth and tongue betrayed him, eagerly sucking and lapping. His long, flexible tongue had wrapped itself around the shaft and was tugging with every suck of his maw. His small claws were gently rolling and squeezing Drew little balls.<br />
<br />
Drew moaned, spreading his legs, letting his boyfriend go to town. He leaned back and just let the lovely pleasure wash over him. <br />
<br />
“Isn’t it nice to help please your boyfriend like the good little Kobold you are?” Drew moaned, lost in the sensations and casting spells on a whim, now. “I Suggest that you love helping me relieve some pent up stress!” <br />
<br />
Drake’s eyes glazed over as he continued to bob on his boyfriend’s musky cock.<br />
<br />
His mind was so muddled he barely even registered that he no longer thought of the otter as a stranger, but as a man he’d been dating for the last year. But the more the otter layered on his Suggestions, the less the little kobold cared. Eventually, he just gave up and allowed the otter to do whatever he wanted.<br />
<br />
“I’m-I’m gonna cum!” The otter announced.<br />
<br />
“Mmmph,” The kobold murmured.<br />
<br />
“I…I suggest you swallow it all, like a good boyfriend!” Drew groaned and came.<br />
<br />
The otter’s seed gushed in spurts into the kobold’s eagerly sucking maw. He swallowed the warm, lovely semen diligently, as a good boyfriend should. <br />
<br />
Drew watched with glee as his new boyfriend’s tongue swirled around the outside of his maw, lapping up the cum that had spilled. <br />
<br />
When he’d first started talking to the cute little kobold, he’d originally intended to just fuck around with him a little. Now, however, watching his new boyfriend lovingly lap the last drips of cum off Drake’s dick made his heart feel fluttery. He decided to give the little guy a reward. Something like a blowjob in return or-<br />
<br />
“Hey babe, you still horny?” Drake found himself saying. “Maybe we can get a quick fuck in before the game.”<br />
<br />
Drake was still reeling from the repeated Suggestions. He licked his lips clean and wondered if he should do it. They’d already changed a bit, into a couple.<br />
<br />
<i>Do it.</I> A voice in his head insisted.<br />
<br />
Drake looked up at Drew and nodded. <br />
<br />
The otter picked him up and jumped down from the counter to the carpet below. It was perfectly clean. Brownies who worked for the store did all of that for a thimbleful of milk and honey.<br />
<br />
Drew was wondering why he’d set the kobold on the floor when he felt a sudden aching need deep inside him. That was when he realized his asshole felt empty. Drew needed to fill it.<br />
<br />
“Ready babe?” Drew said.<br />
<br />
He stepped over his boyfriend and squatted, using his hands to spread his cheeks. He slowly, carefully sat down. He wasn’t sure why he was doing this. His body was moving on autopilot. Drew felt the kobold’s stiff cock brush his hole.<br />
<br />
Drake wanted to say they should take it slow, but the sight of Drew’s ass made his jaw drop. He just lay there, thick dick throbbing in the air, watching the cute otter lower himself onto Drew’s dick. Drew bucked his cock up into the otter’s entrance.<br />
<br />
Drew gasped lewdly as the kobold’s cock slipped inside him.<br />
<br />
Around them, reality began to remodel the bathroom. The sink and toilet both lowered themselves to better accommodate them. <br />
<br />
New memories filled the two lover’s minds as they bucked in sync with each other. The game shop became more of a personal shop for both Drake and Drew. They sold clothing and high-tech gaming gear. They persuaded many of the guys to move here. It made it easier to play their games when they all got off work and it saved them money.<br />
<br />
As it was one of the few places with the new, highly-advanced table, many people came to the shop to play and hope to buy one, but the price range was enormous. <br />
<br />
They continued thrusting, their bodies completely adjusting, as though they’d been fucking for the last year. Small golden rings appeared on their fingers. They were due to be married in a month. Drew’s dick was smaller than most otters, but for a smaller creature like Drake, it was a perfect in his mouth. Drake’s own dick was huge for his size, 18 thick inches. <br />
<br />
Both of them orgasmed at the same time. They panted as the public bathroom they were in transformed. It was a private room now. Drew slowly raised himself off of Drake’s thick cock with a loud pop.<br />
<br />
They lay on the floor and basked in the afterglow. Drake cuddled with his perfect fiance. Drew held him in his arms and lay his head on the kobold’s.<br />
<br />
“Honey, do you have a Book?” Drake kissed his fiancé&#39;s cheek and held him close.<br />
<br />
“Yes, but why do you care?” Drew asked, stroking his lover’s scaly head.<br />
<br />
“...I guess I don’t.” Drake decided. “I don’t see a reason to fight with you. I’m happy and you’re happy.”<br />
<br />
“I’m asking in case you were on the run from other Book users.” Drew said, afraid the kobold would target Troy.<br />
<br />
“No. I’m not interested in revenge!” Drake laughed. “I’d rather thank him for giving me such a cute body and a hot boyfriend.”<br />
<br />
An alert came across both their HUDS. It was a message from Mark. <br />
<br />
HEY THERE LOVEBIRDS. IF YOU’RE DONE IN THERE, IT’S TIME TO START THE SESSION.<br />
<br />
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br />
<br />
“We’re back!” A soft, high voice announced.<br />
<br />
Troy looked up and his jaw dropped.<br />
<br />
Drew walked in wearing flamboyant seafaring garb. A waft of expensive cologne following in his wake. Whatever the mix was, it made Troy’s pants tighten. In the otter’s arms was a cute little kobold. <br />
<br />
Mark started sneezing.<br />
<br />
“What’d I tell you about using that cologne while I’m running a session, Drew?” Mark took out a tissue and blew his nose. His eyes were red and watery. “You know Elves are allergic!”<br />
<br />
“I’m sorry, it was a gift from Drake.” The otter twisted his head and rocked his body in a cute little gestured that had his bubble butt swaying. “I can’t say no to a wonderful gift like that.”<br />
<br />
“Prestidigitation.” Greg intoned and snapped his fingers.<br />
<br />
The smell cleared in an instant. As the perfume smell fade from everyone’s noses, Mark breathed a sigh of relief.<br />
<br />
“Thanks Greg.” Mark said. “Also, Drake, please give him cologne <I>after</I> the campaign. I’d rather not be distracted in case something happen.”<br />
<br />
“Yes, Mark.” Drake said happily. as he slid his tail right into his new adjustable chair. He smile as he shake his ass as he adjust the chair so he can be in eye level in the group.)<br />
<br />
“Your character are ready for the new day. The adjustments I made based on your input have been completed. Your character’s skills should be updated as well.” Mark said. “If you find anything out of place, let me know and I’ll troubleshoot. We are software testing, after all.”<br />
<br />
“Alright, let’s get this show on the road!” Jeremiah cheered.<br />
<br />
“Campaign resuming in 3…2…1….” Mark said.<br />
<br />
Troy settled back in the chair as the world around him went white.</p>
