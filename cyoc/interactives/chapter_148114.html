<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Hailing a cab in Boston was surprisingly easy. The airport had several cabs at the ready, which was extremely convenient for John, who wanted to get away from the airport ASAP before someone figured out he stole their luggage and was wearing their clothes. The adrenaline was still pumping through him after the whole ordeal. Stealing someone else&#39;s things and wearing their clothes was something that John normally wouldn&#39;t have considered in a million years, but he&#39;d had enough of being cold and wet and miserable. Thankfully, the cab seemed none the wiser that John was out of his element as he allowed John to enter his cab.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey big guy!&quot; exclaimed the cab driver as John crawled into the back behind the driver, putting his luggage in the seat beside him. &quot;Where to today?&quot;<br />
<br />
John laughed inside at being called a big guy. Maybe the gym clothes were making him give off a different vibe than usual, as he certainly wasn&#39;t the type to head to the gym often, or ever. He answered the question with half of an explanation of what happened: &quot;Well, I&#39;m here for a trip, but my hotel booking at The Cortez fell through, but I think I&#39;m going to head there anyway and try and talk to the staff.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, I know where that is. It&#39;s easy being an airport driver, people often go to the same locations. It&#39;s odd though that The Cortez would screw up a booking though. They&#39;re usually fantastic for customer service.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Could&#39;ve fooled me.&quot; replied John, bitterly. &quot;I just got here and this has already been a really rough trip.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry to hear that, pal.&quot; replied the driver, pulling out from the airport loop. &quot;It&#39;s just a bad setback though, what brings you here for the rest of the trip?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s a vacation.&quot; replied John, cryptically. He wasn&#39;t in a mood for talking. &quot;I don&#39;t have a ton planned, but I have to figure out a place to stay, first.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure that the hotel will be able to accommodate you once you&#39;re there. They have a great reputation. Excellent services, too. Where are you from?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m visiting from the other coast, from Seattle. This is my first time in the area, actually.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Right, but where you like, from?&quot; asked the cab driver, again, putting emphasis on the last word.<br />
<br />
John, confused, answered with &quot;Seattle.&quot; again. The tone in his voice got the cap driver to drop the subject.<br />
<br />
&quot;Right,&quot; continued the driver. &quot;My bad. I think you&#39;ll love Boston though, You&#39;ll really enjoy the hotel too if all goes through. They have a really nice gym! You look like you train a lo-&quot; <br />
<br />
His sentence was cut short by the cab coming to a lurching stop. The driver put his hand on the horn, honking at a car who cut them off, and he shouted &quot;Fucker!&quot; at him. John lurched forward in his seat, not too dramatically but enough for it to be uncomfortable. He regained his composure, but felt tight in the seat as the space available to him felt reduced.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, buddy.&quot; said John, realizing he didn&#39;t know the cab driver&#39;s name. &quot;Sorry, but could you pull your seat up forward a bit? My legs are cramped back here.&quot; It hadn&#39;t occurred to John before while he was sitting before the lurch, but his huge thighs and quads were taking up practically all the leg room and were pushed against the back of the cab drivers seat.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, sorry big guy!&quot; said the cab driver, pulling his seat forward. &quot;And my name is Paul. Yours?&quot;<br />
<br />
John stretched his legs and smiled, &quot;Thanks Paul. I&#39;m John.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, John. We&#39;re almost at the venue, but I really hope that your trip goes according to plan. Sorry about the lurch there, drivers in this city can be insane sometimes. Not me though, of course.&quot; he said, giving a hearty chuckle.<br />
<br />
&quot;You just reacted, you did what you had to. I&#39;m happy to not be in a crash right after getting here. Maybe my luck is turning around after all.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s the spirit!&quot; exclaimed Paul, as he pulled over in front of a hotel. &quot;We&#39;re here. And you know what, I&#39;m going to give you the ride on the house. Seems like you&#39;ve been through more than enough already.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, you don&#39;t have to do tha-&quot; started John, but he was interrupted quickly.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, I don&#39;t have to, but I want to. You&#39;ve been good company, and it sounds like you could use this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you, Paul. This means so much to me&quot; said John, stepping out of the car with his luggage as Paul rolled down the window and John approached it.<br />
<br />
Paul was writing something down on paper on his lap. He pulled a piece of paper out and handed it to John. &quot;Here, this is my phone number. Let me know how things work out at the hotel. If things don&#39;t work out I can see what I can do for you. You seem like an honest guy.&quot;<br />
<br />
The irony was not lost on John, but he didn&#39;t say anything. &quot;Oh, certainly. I&#39;ll be in contact shortly after this whole ordeal. Thank you so much Paul.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s the least I can do.&quot; said the cab driver, and after a brief pause he continued. &quot;You know, if you want any... company while you&#39;re here, you just have to text me. I&#39;d like to get to know you a bit better, if you know what I mean.&quot;<br />
<br />
John grinned and winked at Paul. &quot;You&#39;re quite the generous man, and I think I&#39;d like to explore that a bit more, if you catch my drift.&quot;<br />
<br />
Paul smiled back, &quot;Good. I have to get back to work, but I can&#39;t wait to hear from you again big guy.&quot; he said, as John started to walk away. Paul honked his cab as he pulled away from the curb, John turning around and waving.<br />
<br />
John sat down on a bench outside the hotel lobby for a moment to collect his thoughts. He had a brief moment of clarity, the cab driver was just flirting with him! And he totally flirted back! John felt uncomfortable, he was a straight man! He shouldn&#39;t be leading on other men like this, it&#39;s not right. Especially not men as kind and sexy as the cab driver, with his heavy build and thick, full mustache. John&#39;s erection was tenting in his jockstrap. He realized that he was in public and quickly tried to quell the thoughts, no matter how exciting the prospect of spending intimate time with the cab driver was. He grabbed his luggage and headed inside the lobby, ready to figure out what the hell happened to his booking.</p>
