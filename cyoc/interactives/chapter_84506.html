<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kel, now Kelly, softly closed the door behind her, just now starting to fully believe what had just happened. Changing her clothes had been one thing, but feeling whatever magical forces his mom had unleashed rearrange his flesh and blood, what had made him who he was, had been something else entirely. After listening to Anna and her mom tell her how pretty she now was (being too dazed to understand everything), she had excused herself to her room, mumbling something about having to do homework, girl or not. Smiling, Anna and Kelly&#39;s mother had turned their attention to the spellbook while Kelly slowly climbed the stairs she had climbed a thousand times as a boy, now ascending the steps as if for the first time.<br />
<br />
She crossed the room and sat down on her bed, smoothing her skirt under herself. She looked down at herself again, taking in how the uniform hugged her new curves, how her pigtails fell over her breasts, and she realized she was just as attractive as, if not more attractive than, all of the other girls that went to school with him. The truth finally sank in that this is who she would be, at least for now. She knew that if the book could transform her, it could just as easily turn her back. For the first time since before she had received the mysterious spellbook in the mail, she smiled. <br />
<br />
ShShe slowly stood up again and, like she had done as a boy, started tossing her long hair around, bouncing up and down on the spot as she did so. She noticed, as her pigtails flew wildly through the air around her, that this was a different experience than it had been-more parts of her bounced along, for one. As she tossed her hair around, her gaze fell onto her mirror, and the sight of a pretty schoolgirl bouncing up and down and tossing her pigtails around with a huge smile on her face made her burst out laughing. <br />
<br />
Still laughing, she approached the mirror. &quot;Oh, hi!&quot; she said, her voice still sounding a little strange to her. &quot;Didn&#39;t see you there! My name&#39;s Kelly. Who are you?&quot; Blushing as she realized she was talking to a mirror, she addressed the dresser next to it but kept walking toward the mirror. &quot;I couldn&#39;t help but notice you&#39;re a bid D&D fan. I think Edition 3.5 was the best, and then they really dumbed it down for 4.0. What do you think?&quot; As she asked the question, she looked forward again, and almost ran into the mirror. Catching herself, her face ended up only a few inches away from the mirror, looking directly into her own eyes.<br />
<br />
When he&#39;d been a boy, Kel hadn&#39;t been much to look at, all knees and elbows and zits. But he had always liked his eyes-he preferred to describe them as &quot;a deep sea blue-green, with a sparkle of intelligence,&quot; not that he had ever said this out loud to anyone. But now they looked back at him, and the face around them was simply stunning. The zits were gone, as were the bags he&#39;d always had under his eyes, and what remained was perfection.<br />
<br />
He&#39;d never been this close to such a pretty girl before, and he bit his lip in nervousness. The girl in the mirror did the same. Suddenly, the proximity to such a pretty girl caught up to her and she felt something at the same time very familiar and completely new: she was getting aroused. But where before he had felt his member stirring to attention, she now felt a sort of ache, a feeling of blood rushing between her legs, of very different parts getting engorged. She took a step back from the mirror and, before she knew what she was doing, started taking off first her glasses, then her vest, then her shoes and socks. When she took her skirt off, she was confronted with the true flatness of her groin, which only intensified her arousal. Before she knew it, the tights and blouse had come off as well, and she stood in front of her mirror in only her underwear.<br />
<br />
Now, as she entered unknown territory, she slowed down. The panties and bra were made of simple white cotton, but they hid what he had seen many times before on TV or on the Internet, but never in person. Slowly, carefully, she reached up to the clasp on her back and opened it on her first try (he had done his research well, to be prepared for just such an occasion). The bra fell away, and her breasts were revealed in all their glory. She cautiously cupped one in each hand, marvelling at how soft they were. Her fingers brushed  against her nipples, electrifying them in a way they most certainly hadn&#39;t when she&#39;d been male. Curious, she pinched them, and rolled her head back while a pleasurable moan escaped her lips. Smiling again, her eyes traveled downward, to where a small wet spot had appeared on the front of her panties. Hooking her thumbs into the waistband, she pulled off the panties and saw, for the first time, the essence of her new femininity. <br />
<br />
Taking one last look at the mirror and smiling once more at the nude, pretty schoolgirl, she blew the mirror a kiss and laid down on her bed. Then, her left hand caressing her breasts, she started stroking her vagina, slowly at first. Her slim fingers slid easily through the wet folds, and pleasure coursed through her body in waves. She brushed against her clitoris, and suddenly knew why it was called the joy buzzer. Joy was the best word to describe what she felt, as she rubbed and caressed and explored. She started to rub faster, then tentatively put first a knuckle, then her whole middle finger into herself, and this was so new and different and wonderful that Kelly was convinced, for a moment, that she had to be dreaming, that none of this could actually be happening. When she found her G-spot, she was more sure that this was a dream than she had ever been of anything else. She moaned, and squirmed, her hips bucking involuntarily against her hand, and the pleasure built and built until, finally, there was release. Her back arched and her vagina clamped around her finger, then released, then clamped again, and with each clamp her every nerve seemed to cry aloud in pleasure. She squirmed and thrashed and screamed until, at last, the pleasure slowly ebbed away and she was left panting and sweating, her hair dishevelled and her blankets tossed around her like dead trees after a storm. She smiled her biggest smile yet and lay there, for some time, basking in the afterglow of her first (and hopefully not last, if that was any indication) female orgasm. <br />
<br />
Then someone knocked on the door.</p>
