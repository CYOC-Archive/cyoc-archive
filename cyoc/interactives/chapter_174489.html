<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The real time AI project you have been working on had ended in failure on the last step. There is just no way to program a computer to see everything and comprehend what it sees in full, to recognize different inflections in voice commands, etc. Basically, to make it think like a human. <br />
<br />
You woke up once again surrounded by darkness. However unlike last time, there was no blinding light above you, instead, a dim, pale white and blue light was instead comming out from beneath you. Looking down, you see a projector lense, and your new androgynous hologram body. Suddenly daylight appeared as a garage door is opened on oneside of the room and a younger looking woman walks in. You immediately recognize her as Mr. Rickman&#39;s daughter, Kiria. <br />
<br />
The 21 year old woman would best be described as being the stereotypical poster girl for a bimbo. She had it all, long, platinum blond hair, pink everything, bubbly personality, only wore slutty outfits, dumb as a brick, and had an obsession with saying the word &quot;like&quot;. You had heard rumors that she was incapable of even driving simply due to her pure stupidity alone. <br />
<br />
She was alone, and closed the garage door behind her, and turned on the lights. Her outfit was slutty as usual. Boody shorts that barely even covered half of her perfect ass, and were so stretched by her hips that she coukdnt even zipper them up or button them properly, not like they had any chance of falling down though. Her pink thong was nearly on full display though, with its high, black waistbands being left fully visible around her hips. <br />
<br />
For a top, a pink bra underneath an open pink jacket with white trim that only was just long enough to cover her breasts if she were to zipped it up, or maybe she just couldn&#39;t zip it at all just due to the size of her breasts. G-cups, according to her own admission was their most current size. However they just kept slowly getting larger and larger each year, and they were entirely natural to boot. You remember how they usually were given a lot of envious glares from many of the women from the corporation too. You only had seen them once several years ago when you first started as the director. Back then they were still double Ds, and you thought that size looked good on her. Now you realized that likely any size would fit.<br />
<br />
Her arms and legs were smooth and completely void of all hair and blemishes. Her feet were currently in a pair of light pink, platform, high heeled sandles. Each of which had an ankle strap formed from a neatly tied bow using a satin ribbon. Her eyes were hidden behind sunglasses, and a large pink purse was hanging off her left shoulder. Lastly you noticed that some of her hair had been tied with a pink bow near the back of her head, forming a short ponytail over the rest of her hair.<br />
<br />
As she made her way over to you, you quickly took stock of your current situation. You were a hologram AI, which would now be owned by this dumb bimbo. Your suprisingly small projector was currently unmounted and just lying down on a table. However it clearly was able to be placed onto just about any surface, or inserted into any device manufacturered by the corporation. Kiria walked up to you, grabbed your projector and got into the luxury car that was next to your table. <br />
<br />
To your surprise, inside the car had no driver&#39;s seat, or even a steering wheel for that matter. Just a large screen monitor where the front windshield should have been. The interior was more or less gutted and remade into almost what looked to be a small living room, with even a pair of comfortable reclining chairs where the back seat was supposed to be. The windows were pitch black as well. And even a small bar was along the right side. This clearly was a corporate car, meant for  only the top of the top VIPs no less. <br />
<br />
Without a word, Kiria inserts your projector into the custom port seemingly designed specifically for it. The very next moment you were overwhelmed by an influx of information about the entire vehicle. Everything to driving it, to how to maintain it, even a gps. What surprised you was the many defensive measures it had, including a forward and backwards hidden mounted turrets.<br />
<br />
Kiria took a seat in the right chair and let out a long sigh. &quot;Fuck! I hate all if this corporate bullshit. Stop by here, visit there, greet this person, praise that group, do not go to that club, don&#39;t dress quite so slutty, but also still dress in a less conservative manor. Fuck I hate this. Just let me wear a plain tshirt and leggings for once. I mean these shorts don&#39;t even look like they fit me properly. God, who could have imagined that even just pretending to be a dumb bimbo would be so fucking annoying!&quot; shouted Kiria to herself. After a second, she calmed down a bit and turned to face you. &quot;Hey, 21st and main. Its a place called Sasha&#39;s. Just park in the back alright.&quot; <br />
<br />
Somehow, you knew exactly what to do and began driving the car. Kiria then looks a bit uncomfortable. &quot;What is it? Why are you staring at me?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry...&quot; you say as you turn to look away. <br />
<br />
&quot;Name&quot; orders Kiria.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tom&quot; you automatically reply.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tom is it. Well you sure fucked up big time. Daddy was pretty pissed at you, but personally, I kind of enjoyed watching him squirm with frustration. Oh, and before you ask. No, I am not really some braindead bimbo slut. But my dad, and just about everyone else has no idea of this, dont say a word to anyone about my real personality and intelligence. Truth of the matter, is that I actually am a savant in both bio and mechanical engineering. I also am likely the best person you know in terms of both fitness and deception. You can thank Mom for that though. She isn&#39;t a simple housewife like the news shows. Instead she is the leader of a private intelligence agency.&quot;<br />
<br />
You couldn&#39;t even say a word due to the completely absurd truth you were being shown.<br />
<br />
&quot;I bet you would never have guessed that the world&#39;s  most famous blonde bimbo was actually a super genious in 2 different fields of engineering and has the computing skills of a professional hacker. As proof, I built this entire car from scratch, all by my self. And, I personally programmed your core.&quot; Boasted Kiria.<br />
<br />
Again you didn&#39;t say a word.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, fine then. I still got 1 sure fire way to prove it. Suddenly her skin shimmered and after a moment Mr. Lorovof was in her place. &quot;Well? Do you believe me now?&quot; Kiria said proudly as she returned to her usual bimbo looks.<br />
<br />
&quot;You, you did this to me?&quot; You managed to say in disbelief. &quot;Saved you life actually, to an extent at least. Daddy wanted to just shot you dead in some allyway for all the shit you pulled. Anyways, now you&#39;re mine forever. You will only answer to me and me alone. Not even my Daddy can order you around anymore. Now then, I dislike your current appearance, and honestly, I never liked looking at you that much either. Not that it is necessarily your fault, but with me being an absolutely unquestionable closet lesbian, men don&#39;t do shit for me. So Tom, please swap over to my custom preset: Felicia.&quot;<br />
<br />
With just a few blinks from your projector, suddenly you were now in the projected body of a woman your voice also had a filter applied to it to make it sound like a clear, smooth woman&#39;s voice. &quot;Alright, no then, re-identify yourself.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Model# HSAI-01.<br />
Designation: Felicia.<br />
Display Model: Felicia (custom preset)<br />
Key information: First successful model of the Human Sentience Artificial Intelligence (HSAI) program. <br />
Software Version: Tom v1.0.0.188. <br />
Exclusive Master/Mistress: Kiria Rickman.&quot; You answer automatically in your new voice. After you finish, you can speak freely again and ask Kiria &quot;Why am I a woman now?&quot;<br />
<br />
With a grin, Kiria says &quot;because I don&#39;t want another man around durring our time together. And so I created the Felicia preset. This is also why you look like you could be my girlfriend. Which we may explore later using a special doll I made. Now then, come over here and sit besides me Felicia. We have much to discuss still.&quot;</p>
