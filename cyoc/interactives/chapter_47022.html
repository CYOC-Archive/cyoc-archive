<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Jeremy? Come on man...this is ridiculous. Can you please come down here so we can go, please?&quot; said Mike, from the bottom of the stairs. When he heard no response, he dropped his pillow case of candy on an old chair and walked up the stairs after his friend.<br />
<br />
Mike found himself facing the same doors as Jeremy did, the bat, the wolf, the ghost and the one that looked like Frankenstein's monster.<br />
<br />
&quot;Which one did he go in?&quot; whispered Mike to himself. He tried the door marked with a bat, but found it to be locked. Mike tried the door to the left of it, the one with the wolf on it. This one was unlocked. Without thinking, Mike walked into the room.<br />
<br />
Right away, he knew something was wrong. Instead of the bedroom he expected, he found himself in the middle of clearing, with trees all around. Disoriented, he turned around, expecting to see the door he walked through, only to find trees and dense forest behind him.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the hell is going on?&quot; he thought to himself.<br />
<br />
Mike stumbled out further into the clearing, looking all around him, taking in his new surroundings. He noticed high up in the sky was the full moon, giving the valley a dim, pale light. <br />
<br />
He started to feel itchy all over and started scratching. Mike caught sight of one of his hands and was shocked to see litte hairs starting to grow over it. He inspected closer and found his palms were becoming rough, almost like paw pads. <br />
<br />
Mike felt a sudden jolt of pain, followed by several more. He fell to the ground, helpless as he felt his body twist and contort, the changes coming over him in a big way.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh god! What's happening to me?!&quot; he cried out as he watched his fingernails grow out into claws. He could feel his teeth grow sharper and bigger as they tore through his gums. <br />
<br />
His clothing started to rip and tear as his body continued to change, his chest barreling out and his legs reforming, becoming digigrade. His shoes ripped apart as his feet became large hind paws. Mike pawed at the tattered remains of his clothes, pulling them off, exposing his new, dense brown fur. He almost fainted as he caught sight of his transforming body. He ran clawed hand through his fur. It began to dawn on him what was happening...he was becoming a werewolf. <br />
<br />
Mike let out a cry of angish as his tail grew out over his buttocks and his face pushed out into a snout. His ears grew to points and moved to the top of his head. <br />
<br />
He laid in the cool, damp grass for a few minutes to allow his brain to process what had happened. He had walked though that door, been transported to this clearing that he was unsure of where he was, and then somehow transformed into a werewolf. He ran his hand through his thick fur over his chest again. For some reason, he found this to be rather soothing and actually enjoyed it. <br />
<br />
Suddenly, a gunshot rang out and Mike was jolted back to reality. He looked over across the clearing to see several hunters, baring torches and shotguns.<br />
<br />
&quot;There's the beast!&quot; cried out one of them, before firing his shotgun in Mike's direction.<br />
<br />
Instinct took over and Mike was on his new digigrade feet in a flash, dashing into the woods with the hunters in hot pursuit. Mike ran with incredible speed, taking long strides, leaping over falling trees. He had to admit, part of him was enjoying his new found strength and agility.<br />
<br />
Another shot rang out and Mike felt the slug tear into his flesh. He cried out and collapsed to the forest floor. It took a moment for the hunters to catch up with him. There were five of them total as they circled him. Mike looked down, seeing wet, matted fur where his wound was. He held his hand over the wound, trying to stop the bleeding, but it was no use. He held out his bloody, clawed hand to his assailant, whimpering for help and mercy, but knew it was useless. Slowly, his world went dark as the hunters raised their shotguns.<br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
Mike awoke with a start on the floor in an empty room back in the deserted house. He looked around in both panic and relief. He was human again and where he should be. However, he couldn't help but notice all his clothes were ripped and tattered. This did not concern him nearly as much as the fact that he was indeed back to his old self, not dead and not shot. <br />
<br />
He jumped to his feet and quickly exited the room after double checking and verifying that he was indeed not shot. He ran right into Jeremy, who was running from the room with the bat on it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dude! What the hell happened to you!&quot; exclaimed Mike, happy to see his old friend. <br />
<br />
&quot;I went into the room with the bat on it and got turned into a vampire!&quot; exclaimed Jeremy. He noticed Mike's disheveled appearance and tattered clothes. &quot;What about you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I went in the room with a wolf on the door and got turned into a werewolf!&quot; he exclaimed. <br />
<br />
&quot;I think we should get the hell out of here!&quot; exclaimed Jeremy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Me too!&quot; replied Mike.<br />
<br />
The two friends raced down the stairs, grabbed their pillowcases of candy and ran from the house.</p>
