<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Stephanie stepped out. She looked pretty much the same, she closed the door behind her,<br />
“So they wanted me to at least reintroduce them,” she started, everyone went silent and looked at her, “I’ve taken it upon myself to give them all punishments. I haven’t given myself any punishments, just keeping the ones I had before,”<br />
“Stephanie…” you started, “you’ve changed so much, I’m sure Skylar would agree that you’ve done your time,”<br />
“I also agree. I’m a different person than I was, sure. But I’m not better. I dislike my changes, it makes me uncomfortable. But I deserve it,” she said with a look of truth. She really meant what she was saying.<br />
<br />
“So who’s first?” Emily asked,<br />
Stephanie took a deep breath, “come on out, Cara,” she said, she made brief eye contact with Tonya. Tonya couldn’t help but be a little nervous, “I took it upon myself to give her a bit of what she wanted, and a bit of what she didn’t.” She finished.<br />
Cara stepped out. What was immediately apparent was her change in height and age. She looked to be in her mid-twenties, around the same age as her sister. She was just a little shorter than Stephanie, who was around average height. Her hair was a lot shorter, but still a deep reddish ginger.<br />
However her primary difference, was that she appeared to be around seven months pregnant. She had a large pregnant belly, especially on her frame. Her hips were wider, her breasts was significantly bigger.<br />
Tonya audibly gasped, “holy shit,” she said out loud,<br />
“Don’t judge so hard…” Cara said awkwardly, “I-I get that this is a fair punishment, don’t tell keep reminding me. Stephanie explained it,” she said, “it’s only for like three months I guess,”<br />
“And she won’t have to go through labour unless she wants to,”<br />
“I don’t want to!” Cara snapped, then began to groan. Suddenly, belly grew slightly, straining against her blue sweater, “s-sorry…” she said,<br />
“As is probably pretty obvious, Cara’s belly grows if she snaps at anyone. If she crosses over the line, her body will change along with it. If she completely loses it, she’ll be stuck this way. Permanently,” she said. Everyone looked a little shocked. Away from Cara’s view, Stephanie looked at the rest of the group and winked. It seemed like she was lying… or at least mostly.<br />
“I won’t snap. I won’t be rude. I’ll be kinder to people, and I need to sort out my ego or something,”<br />
<br />
“Okay, Bella?” Stephanie called out, once again opening the door.<br />
Out walked someone completely new. A tall, dark skinned young man wearing a tank top and cargo shorts, as well as some trainers. He looked as if he could easily be Bella’s brother. His arms were covered in dark hair, as was his chest, legs, back, everywhere. It was clear he had a large tattoo over his chest. And he had a pretty thick stubbly beard. His hair was tied back, retaining just the tiniest amount of femininity.<br />
“H-hi…” he said, in a very deep, masculine voice. Everyone looked on in complete shock. It was pretty obvious that this was Bella,<br />
“Don’t start calling her a he or anything, because she’s still a woman,” Stephanie said, “if it’s not obvious, this was Bella. She’s going to be living in this masculine body for the foreseeable future. She doesn’t have a time-limit. She has to treat everyone she meets with respect, kindness, and not be bitchy to them. And as a reward, her body will slowly regress back to her old body,<br />
“A-and, I’m o-okay with this,” she said,<br />
“You’re okay with having a cock then?” Emily asked, a big smirk covered her face, loving all of this. Bella scowled at her, ready to say something she would regret. But even this move made her body shift slightly. Her muscles tightened, her hair shrank by just a few centimetres. Only someone looking extremely close would notice, but Bella felt all of it. And she calmed herself,<br />
“I am okay with dealing with this body. I need to treat others with respect, and stop thinking how I’m acting is okay,” she finished. Her deep voice clearly not comfortable for her, but isn’t complaining. Deep down she knows she deserved a punishment.<br />
<br />
“Give me just a moment,” Stephanie said with a smile, slipping back through the doors, closing them behind her.<br />
<br />
Everyone looked at Cara and Bella, both changed on distinctly different ways,<br />
“My god…” Tonya said, “what’s mom gonna think?”<br />
“She’s not gonna think anything. She’s going to understand it all,” Cara said, “I asked Stephanie to… just make it not a problem. But she’s still mad at me and what I’ve done, just won’t be mad that I’m pregnant,”<br />
“I mean. Good job, I guess. But damn,” Tonya said, “I was pregnant a few hours ago, but still this is a little crazy, seeing my little sister knocked up like this,”<br />
“Yeah…” Cara said, “it’s not a real baby,”<br />
“I assumed that, I mean who would be the father?”<br />
“Let’s not go there…” Cara said, embarrassed, “I never thought I’d say it but I miss my old body,”<br />
“Speak for yourself,” Bella said, looking down at her chest hair, cringing immediately,<br />
“Hey, you deserve it more than her! She’s just an accomplice,” Emily said to Bella. But Bella didn’t snap, she took a deep breath,<br />
“I know. It is my fault, and Cara wouldn’t be this kind of person if it wasn’t for how I treated other people,” she said.<br />
<br />
“Okay, she’s ready!” Stephanie said. She made her way out of the door, holding hands with someone. By her side was a young girl. The same young girl… it was Skylar,<br />
“S-Skylar…” you hesitated, <br />
“I know…” she said in her prepubescent voice. She looked up at her mother, “I deserve at least some kind of punishment,”<br />
“But you didn’t do anything wrong!” You said,<br />
“Not right now, I guess that’s right. But for what I’ve done, I haven’t had a punishment. And these two have,” she said, pointing at Cara and Bella, “it’ll only last three weeks. I’m going to grow up rapidly, mostly a year every four-to-five days until I’m back to nineteen,<br />
“Shit…” you said, “s-so…”<br />
“I’m going to spend most of my time at home, if that’s okay?”<br />
“Of course it is!” You said, “you can do whatever you want, as long as you think it’s fair,”<br />
“You should ask my mom,” Skylar said, smirking. You look up at her mother,<br />
“I think it’s fair,” Stephanie said, “and it was her idea,”<br />
<br />
—<br />
<br />
The entire group talked for around fifteen minutes before people started leaving. Tonya and David left first, they brought Cara into their car. She had to walk slowly due to not being used to her new weight displacement. They waved goodbye, and made their way home.<br />
<br />
Bella hesitantly asked for a lift home from Stephanie, and Stephanie had to remind her that she arrived her by magic. So they called Stephanies husband to pick them up. Upon his arrival, he was a little shocked to see his wife back to her normal size, and his daughter barely older than his other daughter. They all said goodbye.<br />
You felt a little awkward giving your girlfriend a kiss to say goodbye, so instead she opted for an awkward high-five. She chuckled.<br />
You agreed to not see each other for a few weeks, or at least until she was physically fifteen.<br />
“Oh!” Stephanie said, quickly hopping out of the car, she rushed around, “forgot about this,” she said. She handed you the ring. You smiled, almost having forgotten it,<br />
“Thank you. Good luck raising Skylar all over again,” you remarked. She chuckled back.<br />
<br />
As they drove off, you were left with Emily. Your old best friend. You both smiled at each other, then suddenly started laughing,<br />
“What a crazy ass world you live in,” Emily said,<br />
“I know,” you agreed, “but look at what it’s done,” you started. You and Emily began walking back home, just like old times.<br />
<br />
—<br />
<br />
“Skylar and you… you’re really special aren’t you,” Emily asked out of the blue, completely separate from the conversation you were having previous,<br />
“What do you mean?”<br />
“I mean like, you’re inseparable. You’re both just… good for each other,” she said, “you make her better person, she seems genuine. You seem happier, you seem like you’re just at peace or something,”<br />
“Hm.” You reply. You hadn’t really considered it. You knew you wanted to spend every moment of your life with Skylar. She made her truly happy. Nothing came between you, even in a situation like before. The only thing that could break you apart was some magical force… but even then, you didn’t believe it. You really felt authentic around her, and you could feel her too. She felt exactly the same, “I suppose you’re right. I know I’m happy around her, but she does also feel like another half of me,”<br />
“Wow…” Emily said, looking ahead, letting out a deep breath, “who would’ve thought that Yu Stardan would’ve found love at eighteen…”<br />
“Hey!” You said, punching her in the arm, then quietly adding, “I’m nineteen, by the way,”<br />
“I know, dumbass!” Emily said, punching you right back. You both laughed, remembering how it used to feel. Being friends, being comfortable. Emily was special kind of friend. It didn’t matter where you were, you always knew she’d have your back, forever. You smiled at her, stopping her on her way. You wrapped your arms around her and hugged her. You stayed standing, smiling uncontrollably. You felt overwhelmingly happy right now.<br />
<br />
And before long, you and Emily had walked for over an hour, guiding yourselves through miscellaneous back-roads and sidewalks, until eventually you found yourselves at your doorstep. You hadn’t been home in a while, mostly staying at Skylar’s house considering it was a lot bigger. You looked at your front door, reaching out your pocket and pulling out your keys,<br />
“You wanna come in for a drink or something?” You asked Emily,<br />
“No, I’m all good,” she smiled, “I’ll see you soon. Me, you and Niko need to go bowling or something soon!”<br />
“Sure thing!” You said. You looked her in the eyes, but before you could hug her, she hugged you,<br />
“I love you, man,” she said, “like so much,”<br />
“Me too,” you replied.<br />
The two of your hugged for a while before eventually you had to part ways. You smiled as Emily walked off, until she went right out of sight.<br />
You let out a sigh. What a day, and what a life. You had a lot to think about… and for the first time, you had some time to mess around with this ring a little on your own!<br />
<br />

The End (of Yu & Skylar’s Second Story)!<br />
Dearest Reader, I hope you’ve enjoyed this second instalment of Yu and Skylar’s Romantic Wishing Love-Story. I have deeply fallen for these characters, and as I continue to write I picture them clearer and clearer in my mind. Their story ends, and happily-ever-after they will live, but as for the moment, we are far from that ending. There will be a continuation of this story. Perhaps the continuation will not take quite as long.<br />
However, Skylar and Yu are anything but the only characters in this story, and between this gap, a number of events will take place. I’d hope you look forward to reading them. They will hopefully be found below.<br />
I apologise for disorganised the previous final chapter was, but here is where I will try and leave the following chapters.<br />
I hope you enjoyed this story, and I hope you look forward to more!<br />
<br />
Yours,<br />
Rose <br />
