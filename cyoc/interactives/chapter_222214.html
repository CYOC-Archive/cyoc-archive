<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Antonio crept through the thick brush, his smoke like form gliding over the forest floor, silent like a Spector, and untraceable as the wind, until he found what he had been looking for, there in a clearing was three cloud bison, massive truck sized creatures with eyes made of lightning, their fur and hide a deep blue like grey, crackling with energy, and horns that curved down below their chin, scraping the ground and digging up roots of the nearby trees, gorging themselves in the bounty of the forest. But this wasn&#39;t the first time he had encountered these creatures, after all, spending several months in this new world had given him some experience with how to approach certain situations as well as harvest some new skills<br />
SKILL: Thread of iron ACTIVE<br />
FORM: net<br />
Once his skill had woven the glistening net he pay it on the floor at his feet, then in a flash it vanished, a trail of pettles following close behind, he grinned &quot;always one for theatrics&quot; he chuckled to himself, looking back at the bison blissfully unaware of what was to come, Antonio knew he could take them down with ease, but he had come to find this was so much more.... ENTERTAINING.<br />
a familiar yipping then caught his attention, and with a low growl rumbled his chest as he emerged from his hiding place, stepping out into the daylight, taking his solid form, and drinking in the terror of his prey. All three bison turned to face the threat to their lives, slamming their horns in the ground and sending arcs of electricity through the air, a pathetic threat display, Antonio grinned as he continued to stalk towards them, until finally the largest one charged him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Finally, some good action&quot; he chuckled as the beast bulldozed in his direction, widening his stance, the big cat rose onto his back legs and wrapped his massive paws around the bisons neck as it collided with his body, not a second after impact the forest went silent at the sound of a sickening crunch, and the cloud bison fell dead to the ground, then from the cloud of dust Antonio emerged and smiled when he saw the other two bison laying dead, with a net draped over the top of them, and several nightmare wolves holding the net in place, and atop the pile of corpses a familiar Kitsune fox stood, her hands and face colored in blood and electrical soot.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well then my lord, another successful hunt, the pack will feed well tonight&quot; Kiki called, bowing her head as he approached, the kitsune then yipped and barked to the wolves and they began gathering the bison in the net, then began dragging their bounty back to the den.<br />
&quot; you know I can do this myself Kiki, I don&#39;t want the pack thinking their master is weak&quot; he said with a snort, looking over as his pack disappeared into the treeline.<br />
The fix woman grinned mischievously and disappeared into a cloud of petals, re-apearing on his back, hugging into his fur, Antonio let out a low purr as he felt her soft ass on his back, and her large tits on his shoulders &quot; I am aware of your strength master, but the pack will die of boredom if they don&#39;t get out to do something every now and then, plus I get you all to myself&quot; she said as she began to nuzzle into his neck.<br />
<br />
Over the past several months since his arrival, Antonio had completely changed the way of life for the nightmare wolves, their former alpha female was now his most trusted right hand and trusted adviser, the other two females had spread the word to nearby packs and rogue wolves of their masters power and skills, so naturally they seemed to join him now the pack was fifteen strong, and as for Luna, she was now the alpha female, as per her request she had been shaped to be perfect for carrying and birthing Antonio&#39;s cubs, the small wolf kitsune had desperately needed his help after finding out their mating had been a success, her stomach growing at an alarming rate, after a long assessment from Kiki they all learned that apparently Midnight cat litters grew incredibly large, almost the size of newborn horses, and many in number, so after a few alterations to ease her condition Luna grew into ger role if Alpha female, keeping the den in order while Antonio was away.<br />
<br />
&quot;I must say master, I do miss being the alpha female sometimes, however the way things are now are much better that how my previous mate ran the pack&quot; said Kiki as she now stroked over Antonio&#39;s massive cock, he now lay on his back, his neck propped up against the roots of a tree, panting and grinning as Kiki stroked and licked over his shaft before getting up and straddling herself over his neck, leaning her hips forward and using her fingers to part her glistening folds &quot;you see how hot and wet my pussy is my lord?, It wants to swallow your rod and be filled with your seed, I want to feel your cubs stretch my womb and force themselves into the world!&quot; She cried as Antonio lapped at her pussy, his sandpaper like tongue not missing a single inch of her juicy folds before using his large head to shove Kiki back, making her land directly in his erect rod, her fall giving her no choice but to take it all in at once, grinning as she let out a moan of surprise &quot;oh....FUCK ME, NOW MASTER!&quot; she cried as she began bouncing herself on his dick.<br />
___________________________________________________<br />
With the sun setting in the distance and the howl of the winds in the distance Antonio arrived back at the wolf den, a sleeping Kiko on his back, bundled in her tails, he let out a low chuckle, nodding to two nightmare wolves that stood gard at the dens entrance as they partied the moss curtains to allow their master inside.<br />
