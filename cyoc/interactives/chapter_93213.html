<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Cole found himself transforming into a giant chicken, and so he began to run. To his relief, he found that the farther he ran away from the farm, the smaller he became. Unfortunately he was still transforming into a chicken. Distance didn&#39;t help with that.<br />
<br />
He fled for what seemed nearly an hour. Finding himself very far away, and surrounded by a thick forest of trees, Cole stopped for a break. It was getting dark. He still must have been seven feet tall or so.<br />
<br />
Cole panted heavily. His feather-covered chest heaved in and out as he sat on the ground awkwardly. With some fiddling, Cole squatted down on his yellow chicken legs to take stock of himself. His naked but feathery rear end felt strange against the moss of the forest floor.<br />
<br />
Cole stretched out his arms and fingers, turning them slowly in the forest twilight. Looking closely, he could see that his skin was completely white; the color of an eggshell. Through his skin, like little hairs, puffy white feathers poked out and covered him nearly completely. They came in between his fingers and tips, palms and backs of his hands. Bony wrists stuck out. Fingernails were present. Cole&#39;s chest, neck, underarms, sides, and what he could see of his back were covered as well. His now-pointed butt also had feathers. He still had nipples, somehow. They were a blue-grey.<br />
<br />
Disgusted, Cole stretched out his long, mostly-human legs. He still had a male&#39;s penis and testicles, covered in feathers, naturally. Even though he could lay eggs. Cole tried not to think about it. After his crotch, the feathers ceased and his skin took a yellow-orange gradient, which continued down his long, thin legs to the bottoms of his feet. His knees still bent properly. For now! His long toes had become talons, or at least looked like talons. He was missing four toes; each foot carried only three. Pointed toenails capped the ends of his newly elongated feet. Orange ankles stuck out, covered in dirt. A pointed fleshy bit extended from each heel, to help him, as a chicken, dig into the dirt.<br />
<br />
Cole ran his hand over his head and face. His hair was gone, replaced by more white feathers. They must have continued up his neck, covering his chin, cheeks and nose. Did he still have a nose? His fingers found it. It was petite, but present. Ears? They were very small. Barely had ears anymore... He stretched out his lips in front of his face and saw that they were yellow. They felt soft, still. He was thankful he still had his teeth and tongue. However, when he puckered his lips, they felt hard and elongated out in front of his face to form a beak. Startled, Cole relaxed his mouth. He was relieved to find his lips went soft again.<br />
<br />
Cole couldn&#39;t see that his eyes had become a inky pools of black. Shiny, large bird&#39;s eyes. He would have become unnerved at the sight of them.<br />
<br />
Cole stood up, hungry. Unsure of what to do, where he was, or where to go, he sought the shelter of a nearby cave for the night. After a few minutes he managed to find an empty one. &quot;How fortunate.&quot; he thought sarcastically.<br />
<br />
The chicken-boy dragged himself into the cave. It was about eight feet in height. Just enough for him to stand up in his enlarged state! Owls hooted and bugs flitted around as night descended in the forest. &quot;Oo-whoo!&quot; sounded in the distance. Cole found himself responding unconsciously as a low series of clucks escaped his throat. He belted out a &quot;Buck-Kaw!&quot; Freaked out by this, Cole distracted himself by thinking of what he would like to eat. Unfortunately, his chicken eyes spotted some bugs crawling around on the wall of the rock. Without thinking, Cole pursed his lips into a beak and deftly scooped up the bugs into his mouth, swallowing them.<br />
<br />
Finally safe, reality crashed in on Cole as he realized what he had become. &quot;I&#39;m... not human anymore! I&#39;m a chicken... I&#39;ll have to live in a cave in the woods for the rest of my life!&quot; Wild thoughts flew through his mind. Will I ever be able to wear clothes again? Will I have to lay eggs? Will anyone ever find me?<br />
<br />
These thoughts filled his mind as Cole settled in for the first difficult night of his new life.</p>
