<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Everywhere Carrie looked, the transformations were happening. The sounds of the transformations assaulted her ears, from the stretching and swelling of muscle and flesh, to the ripping of their clothes. Their groans that slowly changed from human to animal, to louder cries of pleasure from some. Her head was swimming as she watched the cashier&#39;s body warp, seeing glimpses of heated, sweaty skin as she changed and her clothing ripped, and even caught a flash of a vulva being engulfed in a freshly grown coat of white fur as it dripped with musk. Instincts had told her to run, but she was hesistant – this was only the cartoon world. If people were being slaughtered here regularly, it would have made the news. Plus, she still had to pay her tab, and her sense of duty held her there as much as anything else.<br />
<br />
“Oh man,” Carrie said. She couldn&#39;t take her eyes off the werewolves. Her nipples were rock hard, and she was wetter than a rain forest. Before this trip, she would have called John&#39;s kink weird. She liked the effect it had on him when she managed to initiate a bit of werewolf roleplay before, but this wasn&#39;t her thing. Or rather, it wasn&#39;t until now.<br />
<br />
Because now, all she could think about was fucking one and getting turned. God, she had to find John. She didn&#39;t want to do this without him. The cashier turned back, and thankfully had the ability to speak. “Twenty One Dollars and Fifteen Cents, ma&#39;am.” The voice was deeper and rougher, but still held a mildly feminine quality. The girl&#39;s fur-covered breasts were prominent, and she&#39;d gained a few inches in height and quite a lot in rippling muscle. Carrie drank in her new form, licking her lips, zoning out for a moment. “Ma&#39;am?”<br />
<br />
“Oh!” Carrie said, snapping back to reality. “I&#39;m sorry. Here you go.”  <br />
<br />
“Thank you, and have a grrrrr-eat night!” The werewolf cashier said, clearly overdoing the growling catchphrase.<br />
<br />
Carrie walked out of the building and onto the street. By and large, most of the people she saw were fully transformed werewolves, hulking bipedal creatures who still wore the remnants of their clothes, though some were fully naked, albeit covered in fur.  A few who looked like they came out of earlier cartoons had more of the Lon Chaney Wolfman or Teen Wolf movie features. They strolled about their night, seemingly just going about their business.  The few humans that were out and about seemed to be like Carrie, awestruck by the wealth of werewolves all around them.<br />
<br />
Carrie pulled out her cellphone and dialed John, who thankfully answered on the first ring.<br />
<br />
“Carrie? Where the hell are you?” He sounded worried.<br />
<br />
“Hey babe,” she said, “I&#39;m in the lycanthrope district.” <br />
<br />
There was a long pause. Carrie could hear him gasp a little. “..Oh..?”<br />
<br />
She smiled to herself. Yup, he was still trying to pretend that werewolves weren&#39;t his thing, and failing miserably. “I wish you were here with me right now, John, because there&#39;s werewolves all over the place. I got a couple of drinks at a bar here and the moon rose..you should have seen it. It was HOT.” Her voice was sultry, full of sexual hunger.<br />
<br />
“I wish I had too,” John said.<br />
<br />
“So where are you?” Carrie asked.<br />
<br />
“Back at the hotel. I actually ran into a toon I created..a werewolf girl, and hung out with her awhile.”<br />
<br />
“Did you fuck her?” Carrie asked. The question casually slipped out, but was devoid of any anger or any emotion at all, really.<br />
<br />
“What? No!” John said. “How could you even ask?”<br />
<br />
Carrie smiled. John was sweet. John was loyal. “Because I couldn&#39;t blame you if you did, John..god, the transformations..I&#39;m SO. FUCKING. WET.”<br />
<br />
“Really?” John said, and his voice had a new confidence as well. She could hear the smile in his voice.<br />
<br />
“Mmmhmm..” Carrie said, acutely aware of how her arousal wasn&#39;t going away at all. Her pussy was throbbing with a deep need for release. “I&#39;m going to catch a cab, John. And when I get there, you better fuck me hard, because I&#39;ve never been so wet in my life. You can have any and all of my holes. Just fuck me.”<br />
<br />
“Get here soon,” John replied, and she could hear the eagerness in his voice. “Love you.”<br />
<br />
“Love you too,” she said and hung up the phone.<br />
<br />
The sky darkened, suddenly. Carrie looked up and saw that the moon had gone behind a large cloud bank, and just like in the vast majority of cartoons, all the werewolves on the street shrank back down in a matter of ten to twenty seconds, reverting to their human forms. Carrie found herself getting impossibly wetter, because she knew that soon, the clouds would clear and the people would all transform again.<br />
<br />
Part of her wanted to wait and watch again, but she knew how she was when she got this horny. Carrie had always had an elevated sex drive, and being around the werewolves seemed to have somehow kicked it up one more notch. She knew that it would be next to impossible to keep her hands off of herself, or potentially one of them, because, against all of her expectations, what she wanted more than anything was to fuck, be fucked, and to be turned into a werewolf.<br />
<br />
Biting her lip, she hailed a cab as it drove by slowly.</p>
