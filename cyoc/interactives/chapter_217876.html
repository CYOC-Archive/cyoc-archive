<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Reality had finally made sense. All the research, all the talk, all the contemplation had all come to this point. He remembered endless nights spent on Internet forums wondering if anyone felt the same. Posts asking questions like “Can a cisgender man get SRS without transitioning?”, with varying responses. He remembered making the first call to the doctors the day he turned 18, and the pre-op consultations. That was when things got complicated. But it was really no surprise, considering the confusion they were dealing with. And then… the long wait while they planned.<br />
<br />
Then the waiting was over. Then there was surgery. Recovery. Here he was, a lifetime of memories that never were came rushing back. He tried to remember his life before the magic stone, his other life, but it was seeming more and more distant by the moment. It was only a matter of time before his mind caught up to his new reality.<br />
<br />
Jeff panicked — the old Jeff. Why would he ever do this to himself, trade his awesome dick for this swollen ugly thing between his legs??! Well maybe it’s wasn’t that awesome, maybe it was more like average, but certainly still better than this mangled excuse for a cunt between his thighs. <br />
<br />
He remembered slyly looking over at the other guys in the locker room showers, careful not to draw attention or risk being the “gay one”, and comparing his pecker to his male classmates. He may not have been the most developed down there, but his man meat certainly held its own. <br />
<br />
Now what? At least he’ll be heading off to college soon, maybe he can catch a break there, he thought. He knew bottom surgery was pretty damn permanent. <br />
<br />
Something about the mental image of locker room showers was sticking with him, the old Jeff had only ever been into girls, but for some reason his mind kept drifting to his buddy Rhett. Well, Rhett and him hadn’t been that close lately. <br />
<br />
Their small town never really had that much to do. Agriculture dominated the industry, and Jeff’s parents moved out there when his Dad got a remote job working in IT. They thought it would do their kids good to spend some more time out in the wild. Jeff was fifteen when he was uprooted from the city and dragged out to the middle of nowhere Idaho. <br />
<br />
Rhett Walker was the first person he met at his new high school, by some luck he and Jeff were sat next to each other for English, math and science, so they saw each other all day long for three of the five weekdays. <br />
<br />
Rhett was a big boy, even back then. His family owned a farm not too far out of town and the hard work combined with his teenage hormones and diet of 4000 calories daily packed pounds and pounds of muscle onto his 6 foot frame. Jeff wasn’t weak but when you take into account that Rhett was held back a two years to help his parents with the farm full time and he practically dwarfed Jeff, and everyone else, in stature. <br />
<br />
20-year-old brute Rhett was captain of the football team, and a talented linebacker. Contrasting his intimidating appearance was his personality. Rhett was one of the nicest people you would ever meet, and would go out of the way to make Jeff smile, even if he wasn’t the brightest. He actually convinced Jeff to join the team, said he’d make a good wide receiver.<br />
<br />
The king of jocks, Rhett wanted to be friends with Jeff the new kid, lucky him. Around Junior year the rumors started though. In small towns word spreads fast, and the word was that Rhett was gay and fucking some guy off Grindr from the next town over. Small town America is a different world, people weren’t supportive, to say the least. Rhett’s parents are in denial, but the whole school started treating him differently. Any guy caught alone with him was rumored to be gay. And as much as Jeff felt bad for abandoning his friend, he just couldn’t be associated with him, he saw the social disaster that was Rhett Walker, so they slowly drifted apart.<br />
<br />
That was the old Jeff, though, and the old Jeff’s memories. The new Jeff was feeling a different, equally confusing set of emotions. Physically he may have been dilating his neovagina in his room, but mentally he was in the showers looking aadmiring the football captain’s massive naked body. Rhett’s short brown hair, blue eyes, thick masculine hands and feet and confident grin all added to his beefy 230 pounds of muscle. His cannon arms and tree trunk legs looked like they could move mountains, and when he flexed, god was he sexy. The one area Jeff beat Rhett in physically was down there, between Rhett’s thunder thighs was a tiny nub of a penis, it honestly looked more like a clit soft and even more so on his massive frame. Ironically, Jeff was bested in that regard now. Somehow the thought turned him on even more.<br />
<br />
He didn’t consciously realize but he had started fucking his new pussy with his dilator. Part of him wanted to be disgusted by the thoughts he was having, and by the horror wound in his crotch, but it didn’t seem quite right somehow. He had always wanted Rhett, and he was always jealous of how little cock Rhett actually had. The old Jeff was gone. The new Jeff Davies was gay and falling for Rhett Walker.</p>
