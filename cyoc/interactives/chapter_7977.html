<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Don't stop me Professor, I want to go back! Back to where I was happy, back to where life had a simple meaning!&quot; said Frank as he picked up the Medallion and fondled it in his sweating hands.<br />
<br />
&quot;Frank, think of those who are dear to you, your parents, some girl, consider them!&quot; argued Myron not knowing what might happen.<br />
<br />
Frank took a tight hold on the Medallion. Looking around he got up and walked out the Professor's living room to the flower garden outside. Then standing wide eyed and filled with both fear and desire he asked the Professor, &quot;I want to go back where thing made sense, a life of simple ways and simple needs, please send me back!&quot; As he then closed his eyes and began his last human wish.<br />
<br />
&quot;Medallion, Medallion, like Jenny Madox grant me to be as she longer and loved! I... ah.. choke..cough! It's happening, Professor it's really happening, let me go back to where......................&quot; said Frank as the color of his skin darkened first deep tan and then jet black.<br />
<br />
Myron closed the door to the living room and stood to one side as things began to happen.<br />
<br />
The Medallion glowing of power drawn from the depths of God know's where as Frank placed it tenderly down on the patio table. As his chest began to expand he started to unbutton his shirt and then stopped with a smile. &quot;Huh!&quot; was the only sound made as he realized the riping off of his clothes was little bother. <br />
<br />
The beginning pains hit with violent force and dropped Frank to his knees. Myron stepped froward seeing Frank lift his arms up as if begging for something. Yet as he stepped close the blackened skin sprouted dark hairs as finger gnarled together forming a solid hoof.<br />
A smirk came over his lips as even with the agonizing pains going on his wish was soon to be fulfilled.<br />
 <br />
Myron stood with his arms folded and watched intently as bit by part of Frank changed. He whences as Frank's head groaned and boes shifted to be more of animal proportions. Frank's ears grew pointed and covered in dark brown fur. As the young man blinked with each shock of pain his eyes also darkened and grew large plus round.<br />
<br />
Frank leaned forward supporting his growing mass with the fore hoofs and his strengthening new legs. As his neck gained length he began to shake his head violently from side to side. As the change moved down his body the belt buckle popped loose and his designer slacks started to tare.<br />
<br />
Turning his head up to look at Myron an almost satisfied human grin spread the thick black lips. As then the lips spread open to show the bright white teeth below and Frank tired to speak. A low pitched and gravely sound came from his changed throat as he tried to strain out a sound.<br />
<br />
Those straining pants just then ripped free and falling to the ground offered both Frank and Myron a good view of the growing hind quarters.<br />
As Frank craned his heavy head around to see, Myron leaned forward for a good look too.<br />
<br />
A large and rounded rump came into view as Frank mumbled out a satisfied sound. In seconds the swishing tail began to flick about as Frank found something to play and enjoy. In fact Frank was still very nervous over his choice to be an animal again. He knew that with his one wish he was to remain in permanent status as an animal from then on and it thrilled as it worried him.<br />
<br />
A shudder and wiggle of leg and hind foot on each leg announced the end of his change. Now he was much like Jenny, a different color perhaps but very much a young equine. <br />
<br />
Tail flicking with glee Frank walked in circles about the flower garden seemly trying out his four beastly legs and the feel of those hoofs on the ground. As he pranced about the agility and strength of animal form pleased him as Myron also noticed by the going actions.<br />
<br />
At last Myron had to say something or bust. &quot;Frank can you understand me?&quot; he asked the prancing beast.<br />
<br />
Frank stopped and looking to Myron opened his mouth wide and as he shook his head a definite, yes he spoke his first true bestial sound.<br />
<br />
&quot;Heehaw, Heeeee, Haw, Heehaw, Heehaw, Heehaw, Heehaw!&quot; Frank paniced as the rolling sound of his new voice was well remembered from the trip to Brazil, he was a Mule.<br />
<br />
&quot;Heehaw, Heehaw, HeeeeeeHaw!&quot; Frank tried to show and did show his surprise at being a Mule.<br />
<br />
&quot;What's wrong?&quot; asked Myron as he then stopped to think that Frank was trying to tell but could now only make pure equine sounds.<br />
<br />
&quot;You didn't expect to be a Mule did you Frank?&quot; asked Myron.<br />
<br />
The Mule slowly shook it's heavy head back and forth as if to say, NO!<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm surprised that the wish you made went so far and then too you have lost your humanity to a lower form you really didn't want to become. Frank, I am sorry you are now stuck as a Mule rather than a stallion like Jenny but was it your intent to change your sex too?&quot; asked Myron as he knelt down to inspect Frank's changed groin.<br />
<br />
A frantic &quot;Heehaw, Heehaw, Heehaw, HeeeeeHaw!&quot; flowed out of Frank's Mule mouth as he craned his neck and head low to see the mule's cock he did not have. There tucked away up in his groin were two tiny teats on a small pouch that if a sterile female Mule he'd never really need.<br />
<br />
As tears began to flow down his dark furry cheek the new jenny Mule now walked in slow and sorrowful circles.<br />
<br />
Myron went inside and called a good friend with a farm to come and remove a Mule that wandered into his flower garden. Then he returned to the garden to find Frank already enjoying the garden and great outdoors by eating his Roses, flowers, thorns and all.<br />
<br />
As the garden vanished down the gullet of the Mule, Myron watched as Frank without any resistance was loaded into a horse trailer for his ride to the farm. &quot;I'll have someone contact you about the Mule later in the week!&quot; said Myron as he needed to make plans for Frank's full wish to be completed.<br />
<br />
After a wild time that morning Myron sat down and called his long time friend in Brazil. He told his friend on an animal who he had was the smartest Mule he'd ever seen and that it would otherwise be sold to a meat packer if he didn't save the creature. A lie true enough but his friend agreed and the shipping orders were made. Later that week Frank would be as he asked to be allowed to return to where things were simple and life was as he wanted it most, a pack Mule in Brazil?</p>
