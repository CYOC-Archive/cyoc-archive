<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;óchi, óchi, óchi...&quot; Or something similar was what Mike uttered next as he tried to get his clothes back on. They were so damn tight and having them on just felt so incredibly unnatural. Mike had never felt this way before in his life. He couldn&#39;t speak his English even half as well as normally, and he felt things toward his male friends he&#39;d never felt toward any guy ever. It was like...he was aware of the fact he hadn&#39;t always been this way, but at the same time, it felt so incredibly natural. It took all his willpower not to shuck his shirt and pants and walk around in just his boxers.<br />
<br />
He ran a hand through his hair and remembered then how curly and distinct his hair was from how it usually was. Damn but it was so soft, but it had a definite feel like he just worked up a sweat. The former jock looked around and felt oddly like he was being watched inside this room. If only he had his Gladiu---fuck! &quot;Mike...c-cuh...come on m-man, get your head...out of being in the clouds.&quot;<br />
<br />
It was like something was out of sight but still had its eyes on him, and it was such an uncanny feeling he did admit having a sword on hand would&#39;ve made him feel at least a little safer. If just for having some method of defending himself if something popped out.<br />
<br />
Leaving the room, Mike at long last felt cool air on him, which made him breathe and utter a few quick Greek phrases under his breath. He shook his head and continued looking around. What did his friends say they were here to do again? Mike knew he wanted to do pankration, run, and throw a discus around, but that...probably wasn&#39;t it.<br />
<br />
Mike found himself looking through some odd bedrooms, all of which looked torn through as if someone was searching for something. His thoughts were on his friends and what might be happening to them. He knew it was odd, but they were close to him. So he hoped they were all in good condition. His perspective on the fiery Aaron had changed a bit. Whereas before he saw Aaron as way too competitive and petty, now he saw the nerdy swimmer as having passion and fiery drive.<br />
<br />
Exactly what Mike liked in a guy. Well, that and a nice dic---<br />
<br />
Mike bit his lip and slapped his head, trying to get his head out of those thought patterns. &quot;I ahh...am a straight man. A toh---totally straight man.&quot; He tried to keep telling himself that over and over in hopes it would stick. His new Greek perception though kept returning him to just how normal it was for him to think like this. And then he started to hear perhaps the justifications from his new conscience.<br />
<br />
You can still fuck girls, Mike, some part of himself told him, just you&#39;re gonna feel like having some guys in your bed every now and then.<br />
<br />
Mike looked down as he pressed himself up against the building wall.<br />
<br />
Of course, he was horny again. How damn virile was this Ancient Greek athlete? Mike could swear he was so horny and so hot at that that the sweat was making his clothes even more tight on him. He ducked inside of a room - for all that he was hot, horny, and ready to go, for some reason the Greek side of him was pounding it in to him that such a large erection was subject to jeering. Best to be flaccid and as if withstanding cold temperatures in non-erotic company.<br />
<br />
Once he was inside the room though Mike&#39;s attention was thoroughly on his cock.<br />
<br />
He tore off his shirt, even hearing a seam rip, and soon after his pants joined his shirt on the floor. He was a statuesque bastion of ancient Greek masculinity sticking out of a pair of shoes - quite an odd if erotic sight. He didn&#39;t waste any time, pulling out his manhood and beginning with a few strokes from head to base, making Mike shiver with arousal. He hoped he came so fucking hard he didn&#39;t need to do so again tonight.<br />
<br />
But knowing his luck, he&#39;d be at this like five more times.<br />
<br />
Mike groaned and humped into his hand as he felt the first quakes of pleasure, his ass was inviting him to do things with it, but he was adamant for now in just partaking in pleasure to do with his manhood. The Greek stud knew that such an indulgence would only drive him further into the mentality of a Greek athlete in the ancient Olympics. What he didn&#39;t know was if he wanted that or not, in the heat of the moment.<br />
<br />
Mike&#39;s free hand was continuously moving toward his ass, and he consistently kept it back to his side or feeling up his muscles. He gasped as he felt it clasp a nipple and squeeze, the dangling nerves sending spikes of pleasure through his body. His dick went if possible even more erect, dribbling precum across the floor as Mike exulted in the feeling with a troubled if immensely pleased gasp.<br />
<br />
The former jock was wrestling with his mentality, trying to find some meaningful truce or allowance for indulgence, even as he continued thrusting away into the air, alternatively imagining sex with men, women, and sometimes multiples of both - men mostly when his Greek fledgling mentality was winning out mentally.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nuth...Nothing b-bad about doin&#39; butt stuff.&quot; He told himself even as he started to lose the fight.<br />
<br />
It was when he heard a noise at the opposite end of the hallway and imagined Aaron or Dean or Todd seeing him like this, seeing him so hot, so pumped, so full of strength and Greek virility that he lost the fight entirely. He kept rubbing and gripping his cock tight even as his fingers tested and pushed into his ass, feeling it stretch and he started to feel them inch closer...closer...white hot notes of pleasure ringing through his body. Damn, why had he ever been so afraid as to not go full on forward with doing stuff with his ass? Would it even be that bad to have a guy back there?<br />
<br />
It&#39;d be...kinda good...<br />
<br />
Mike didn&#39;t realize he thought that as his orgasm rocked his body and he crudely shot rope after rope of cum all in several lines in the room, his breath unexpectedly shallow toward the end. He hadn&#39;t even realized he&#39;d been almost screaming from how good that felt, and screaming in Greek no less. The former jock breathed and looked down at his clothes...<br />
<br />
...Much as it didn&#39;t feel good to him, he pulled them back on. He hoped he could leave this place before it got too late tonight. So he could get home - all so he could just strip naked and enjoy himself in private company. Maybe do some more exercise before bed. Mike was heading out of the room when he heard a surprised voice say;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mike? Is that...Is THAT you?&quot;</p>
