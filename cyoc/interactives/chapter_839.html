<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Adam had regained his composure and was desperalty trying to get out of his now over sized baseball pants his fear had turned to anger by the time he got the
<br>
 pants off, poor Adams shirt tail now draged the ground as he approched the even shorter Mario. Stan on the other hand had wondered over to a mirror and was
<br>
 just stairing at how thin he had become, all those years in the gym and athletics seemed like a waist of time now. 
<br>

<br>
 Mario tryed to back away from Adam and triped as his feet reached the circumfernce of the belted waist line of his pants, he was now sitting on his ass with his
<br>
 shirt as his only cover, Adam looked over and up to where Stan was standing, he looked like a skinny giant now to Adam who was now just under three foot high.
<br>
 Mario tryed to yell at the two but neither was really listening to him, he hung his head down and shook it and sighed. &quot;LOOK YOU TWO!&quot; Mario yelled as he
<br>
 looked over to the guys, Adam now only came up to Stans waist line and he was looking way up to look Stan in the face. They both looked so different now,
<br>
 Adam was so short and poor Stan was so skinny, Mario couldnt help but giggle about it, he figured all they had to do was get to Mr Knowles class and he would
<br>
 fix thing for them. 
<br>

<br>
 Mario took off his pants as well and now his shirt dragged the ground as well, &quot;COME ON GUYS! WE GOTTA GO!&quot; Mario said as he approched the two, they
<br>
 both had tears running down their faces and Marios heart sank abit, he didnt think they had to be that concerned, he'd seen this shit in his class, and Mr Knowles
<br>
 was one of the best sorcerers in the feild, surly he would khave a cure for them when they got to the class. 
<br>

<br>
 Adam was pissed but he knew if he wanted to be tall again he would have to follow Mario back to the class, it took some convincing and another two inches of
<br>
 height drop to get Stan to start to follow Mario, but finally the three were on their way back to Marios magic class. 
<br>

<br>
 The three walked down the long crowded hall to the snickers of their fellow students, Stan had to hold up his now enormus baseball pants and Mario and Adam
<br>
 were picking up their shirts like girls with long dresses do when they walked, Adam was now furiuos at Mario, he had been humiliated in front of the whole
<br>
 baseball team and now the whole college elumnie as well. 
<br>

<br>
 By the time the three had made it to the class room poor Stan had also began to shrink down in height, he was now four and a half feet tall and the crotch of his
<br>
 baseball suit hung down between his knees as he quite litterally waddled in the pants now, with every step he took he could feel the heel of his baseball shoes
<br>
 leiveing his the back of his foot. 
<br>

<br>
 Mr Knowles had a look of shock on his face as the three came into the room, he quickly ran over and locked the door to the room, he then called the office and
<br>
 canceled his next few classes, he told them he had a spill that needed cleaned up and he was wearing the right suit to clean it up. Do to the nature of the class the
<br>
 request was accepted of coarse and all was safe for at leist a while. 
<br>

<br>
 Adam was now under two foot tall and mario was fast approching the foot high mark, poor Stan was now three and a half feet tall and still just as skinny as a rail,
<br>
 Adams body was still just as musculare as it always was, he was just increadibly short now. &quot;Well Mario! NOW DO YOU SEE WHY WE DON&quot;T TAKE
<br>
 SPELLS OUT OF THIS ROOM!&quot; Mr Knowles yelled! He was furious at Mario now. 
<br>

<br>
 Stan was just sobbing away in a corner of the room and Adam who now was head to head with Stan who was sitting while Adam was standing up, Adams shirt
<br>
 had spread out from him radiating in folds around him as he stood ther, the short sleeves that had just covered his bicepts when he was taller now almost covered
<br>
 his whole arm. The opening for the collar of his shirt now touched the tips of his shoulders and threatened to slide down his arms, poor Adam could now crawl out
<br>
 of the collar if he wanted to. 
<br>

<br>
 Stans collar had slipped down his skinny shoulders and it rested all buched up agaist his the top of his twig thin bent forarms, he was resting his head in his bone
<br>
 thin hands as he sat there and just cryed. Mario shirt was goon now it to had slipped down off of him and he was running around naked in the room now. All of this
<br>
 was just to much for poor Stan, he did'nt know things like this even happened in real life, let alone being an active paticipent to it occurance. 
<br>

<br>
 Mr Knowles came over to Stan and tryed to cosole him, he said he find the antidote soon and if he was lucky he could restore their heights at leist, he did tell him
<br>
 he wasent sure about his muscles though, no one had ever come up with a spell that did this before. Not real assuring to Stan no doubt but he did stop crying. 
<br>

<br>
 Mr Knowles and the now foot high Mario worked as hard as they could for the cure to the spores, but try as they might the best they could come up with would
<br>
 be only partsialy, effective at best, Mr Knowles gave Stan the the first batch of the antidote, and soon he started to get taller, but no real gain to his muscles
<br>
 folowed the change, he was still very skinny and totally muscleless, he did get back to a height of 5'6&quot; inches but then it stoped, he was now a foot shorter and only
<br>
 weighed 90Lbs, still to skinny fot a guy even that short. 
<br>

<br>
 The same thing was given to both Mario and Adam, but they too only got taller, and what was worse was the fact that Adams fine build got smaller as he got taller,
<br>
 he to was begining to get rail thin as well now, but Mario did keep his modest build as he leveled off at 5'2&quot; and Adam reached 5'4&quot; inch mark but he now was just
<br>
 as thin as Stan was, he weighed 80Lbs now.Adam was pissed. Mario on the other hand now weighed 130Lbs and looked quite nice for his present size. He
<br>
 secretly loved the idea that he now out muscled and out weighed the two former studs. &quot;FIX THIS SHIT RIGHT NOW MARIO!&quot; Adam yelled as he realized
<br>
 that he was now the weaker of the two roomates, 
<br>

<br>
 Mr Knowles suggested that the three go back to Adams and Marios drome room and he would try to prefect the antidote to regain some of the guys lost muscles
<br>
 and weight, he told them that they probably wouldnt get to much taller even if they did get back some of their former size though, the spores had probably done
<br>
 permenant danage in that area, he told them. 
<br>

<br>
 All of that just made Stan that much more depressed, now he would have to spend the rest of his life looking up to the other people and not the other way around.
<br>
 Adam faced the same fate as he did only he wasent even 5'6&quot; and if the propheser was right he never would be again! Mario though he was now shorter had
<br>
 grown to like the way his body now looked, it was tight muscular and vascular looking, and he was used to being shorter anyway. The three all left for the dorm
<br>
 room and Mr Knowles told them he would bring them clothes to better fit their present size and go to work on a cure of somesort as soon as possable. Stan and
<br>
 Adam wanted to kick Marios ass, but they now couldnt even if they got to gether to do it. Mario loved that part of all of this, two cute skinny guys who were now
<br>
 under his total control!</p>
