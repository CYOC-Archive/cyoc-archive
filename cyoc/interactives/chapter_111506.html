<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jennifer thought was in tears, each time she did a push up she could feel herself growing. It wasn&#39;t fast, but it was still quite noticeable.<br />
<br />
Once Jenifer was done doing all of her push ups, she stood up and walked towards the bathroom mirror. She didn&#39;t want to see herself it such a state, so as she entered she covered her eyes. Slowly she moved her had from her eyes and looked directly into the mirror.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ohh.. my lord!&quot; Jennifer said. She now looked as if she was 2 times her original weight, fat was hanging off of her skirt. Jennifer also felt heavier, slower in fact. The whole idea of having to eat more to lose weight just seemed extreme, but what could she do know. She would be stuck gaining weight for just walking around normally!<br />
<br />
&quot;Why does this have to happen to me!&quot; Jennifer moaned. That was exactly when it hit her, she had to get to school! The fact that she only now remembered meant that her bus would have come and gone by now. Fear overwhelmed Jennifer, she was now going to have to get to school some other way than driving. How in the world was she going to get to school.<br />
<br />
The idea of simply not going passed through her mind, but it faded. Jennifer was determined to get to school no matter what happens. She rushed towards the door and put on her shoes, the best thing she could do for a mode of transport was a bike laying down in the front yard. She knew the consequences but had to take them, at this point there was nothing to lose.<br />
<br />
She hopped onto her bike and began to peddle. Not even a few seconds in and she began to feel herself gain mass, the faster she peddled the more that she gained. Even keeping a slow pace felt awkward. As Jennifer gained she began to feel tired, she started to slow down tremendously. At this point, Jennifer felt as if she would pass out on the bike, but nothing would stop her from getting to school.<br />
<br />
Minutes pasted, Jennifer continued to peddle. The more she did the more tired she would get, second by second. She was completely unaware of how she looked, the only thing she could focus on was getting to school. To her, nothing seemed different, but from the outside she was a blob, gaining weight quickly.<br />
<br />
Eventually she would make it to school, tired and exhausted but still willing to get to class. Luckily none of the bells went off so she could get to class and begin her day as normal. The only problem is that she was now almost in the shape of a ball, if she wished to see her legs or feet she was now going to have to use a mirror.<br />
<br />
Jennifer ran through the halls, running didn&#39;t seemed to have as much of an effect on her as biking, but was still noticeable from the outside. Jennifer ran towards her first block and took her seat in the middle of the class. As she began to sit down in her seat she realized that she was now so big that it had become a struggle for her to simply sit down in her seat. Jennifer now had to squeeze just to simply sit down, who even knows how hard it was going to be to get any work done.<br />
<br />
The good thing is that she was no longer gaining any weight, it seemed that sitting down didn&#39;t have any form of effect.<br />
<br />
As the class began, Jennifer started to relax. This was the only time in the day other than her other classes she would get to relax. She took this time to look at herself, even though it was incredibly hard. Simply looking down had become a task in and of itself. Jen looked around the class at her other peers, they didn&#39;t seem to care even though there was a balloon sitting in their class.<br />
<br />
The day would continue, she would go from her first class to her second class at a slow walking pace, just to make sure that she didn&#39;t cause any more damage to her body. An hour would pass as she finished her next class as normal, now was lunch and Jen was incredibly exited. Finally she would be able to lose some form of weight.<br />
<br />
Jennifer walked into the cafeteria and grabbed the biggest meal that she could, at this point she would try anything to keep herself in the best possible shape. She sat down at the nearest table and began to scarf everything down, she was basically a vacuum cleaner. Slowly she started to lose weight, very slowly.<br />
<br />
After Jennifer finished eating she looked down at herself. To her, it seemed like nothing had changed, but in reality she would only actually lose a few pounds. It was so minuscule that she couldn&#39;t even feel it.<br />
<br />
Learning that it was so small freaked out Jennifer, she couldn&#39;t eat that much food. She knew that at some point she was bound to have to eat like a pig in order to keep herself small. She walked back to the cafeteria line and ordered another plate of the biggest meal and again scarfed it down. It seemed at this point that she would have to do this on her own time, she couldn&#39;t indulge herself now.<br />
<br />
The bell started to ring, kids began to empty the cafeteria. Jennifer followed and headed to her next class. Up until now she had completely forgotten that her next class was on the top floor of the school. Jennifer went into a unnoticeable panic, she knew that she was going to have to clime a massive flight of stairs, something that she had done time and time again. This time she knew the consequences of going up the stairs.<br />
<br />
She planned her way up, she was going to go slow to see if she would be able to stop herself from gaining any weight. For the first while it worked. Only after a few steps she began to feel herself gaining.<br />
<br />
&quot;Screw this!&quot; Jennifer said. Jen began to walk up the stairs normally. At this point, there is no reason to try and stop what was going to inevitably happen to her. Step by step, stair by stair Jen gained weight. It felt like an eternity. By the time she made it to the top of the stairs, Jennifer could feel the amount that she gained and was not at all proud of herself for the choice that she had made.<br />
<br />
Jen then suddenly remembered, Kyle was the entire reason she was in this predicament. Maybe he could be the one that gets her out of it as well. Jen headed to her class and began to think, what could she do to get back at Kyle?<br />
<br />
Sitting on him seemed like a bad idea, and she couldn&#39;t hit him. What was she going to do! Jennifer thought and thought, for almost an entire hour, then it hit her! Jennifer could use the transform or dare on Kyle, just to simply get back at him!<br />
<br />
The first step of the plan was to find Kyle, but she hadn&#39;t seen him all day. Her best guess was that he purposefully didn&#39;t come today just to mess with me, she was now going to have to live with being a ball for a full day. How great.<br />
<br />
Jennifer finished her class and headed to the next one, her last class of the day went by just as normally as it would. The last task of the day was to get home, in her head it seemed simple enough; get out of the school, get on the bus, get home and eat as much food as she could. Only one problem, she would have to go for more or less a run or a walk depending if she wanted to make it there or not.<br />
<br />
The moment the bell rang Jennifer was out of her seat and running as fast as she could for her bus, even though her running speed was almost a walking speed. Jennifer was incredibly lucky, she had made it to her bus and got on. She no longer had to rush herself to get home. For that entire run, she had gained around 50 pounds, and was almost in the shape of a ball.<br />
<br />
Her bus eventually stopped. Jennifer walked off and began on her way home. Once Jennifer was home she headed towards her kitchen. Her desire for food was at astronomical levels, the moment she got her fridge open she devoured all of the food in it leaving nothing behind. The good thing is that she could feel herself losing weight, even though it was incredibly small.<br />
<br />
Jennifer pulled herself back from the fridge and looked into the white abyss that she left behind. Jennifer didn&#39;t mind the fact that she no longer felt incredibly fat, even though she still looked the part.  The only thing on Jennifer&#39;s mind was the sweet revenge that she would give to Kyle when she finds him!</p>
