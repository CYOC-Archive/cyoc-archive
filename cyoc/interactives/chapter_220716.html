<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;you know these things are so cute I almost hate selling them,&quot; Penelope said as she looked back at the rabbits. &quot;yeah I know but if we kept them then we&#39;d have overrun the farm. besides the kids love them&quot; Marcus said as they drove to the city. They had just passed the edge of the farm when the ground shook. &quot;come on, keep it toge-&quot; Marcus was interrupted when the ground gave way.  <br />
<br />
soon they crashed into a flooded ditch. Penelope&#39;s side was undamaged so she opened the door. this led to the water rising to their ankles. the water was slowly rising. she then realized that Marcus had passed out.  <br />
<br />
it was a miracle that was all. She suddenly felt like someone was tickling her feet. looking down she saw the most reflective water ever. under its surface, her shoes and socks melted into ink. her feet elongated as a toon outline appeared on them.  <br />
<br />
the same happened to the passed-out Marcus. his feet were slightly smaller. both of their toes melting together and reforming into paws. the water was now halfway up their calves. Penelope gasped as she saw the water eat away at her coworker&#39;s pants.  <br />
<br />
Eventually, she managed to unbuckle his seat belt. She struggled to get the 250-pound man out of the truck. The worst part was the fact she was distracted by the water. it had risen to her knees when she noticed something. her legs were now longer and purple.  <br />
<br />
She then saw purple fur grow from her skin. She lost her grip on Marcus when he suddenly changed height too. the poor man fell into the rising pool. Penelope tried to grab him. All she managed to grab was his hat.  <br />
<br />
Once it was exposed to air it melted into ink as well. She realized that could be happening to her. looking at her hands she screamed. instead of four fingers she now had 3. Both hands were covered in white gloves.  <br />
<br />
She immediately ran for dry land. it was now covering her knees. thankfully she managed to arrive on solid ground. she sighed in relief only to gasp moments later. just below her skirt was a foreign... something.  <br />
<br />
her once dainty yet muscular legs were changed. they were longer and covered in lean muscle. the most noticeable change was her feet. imagine clown shoes covered in fur. the only good thing was her ankles were raised to she could walk slightly normal.  <br />
<br />
She fell back and tried to escape the insanity. about 3 feet later she realized what this was, the toon outbreak. She remembered a story on the news about toon water. looking back at the ditch she saw toon lines surrounding the edge of the water. she then watched as the entire truck slowly melted into the water.  <br />
<br />
&quot;I just realized my phone is in the glove box,&quot; she said as she watched the water consume the vehicle. she then felt the same tickling sensation reaper on her legs. &quot;of course, there are no half-toons. If I&#39;m gonna change I&#39;m gonna do it on my terms&quot;. she then imagined a changing room behind her back.  <br />
<br />
her toon hands then caught something. she then slammed it down in front of her. She was shocked she was able to do it. she glanced at her hands in awe, she also saw more purple fur covering her. She then entered the changing room and stripped down. She soon saw a completely different pile of clothes on the ground.  <br />
<br />
before she could inspect she felt something different. looking at the 3 roomed mirror she investigated. She noticed her feet were a shade or two lighter. however, what really grabbed her attention was her pussy. her thighs had changed to become more masculine.  <br />
<br />
this was further evidenced by her pussy changing. She watched as two giant balls fell into a light purple sack. said sack was soon covered in thick fur. her clit that expanded to a 3-foot cock. &quot;why&#39;d I have to get a gender change&quot; she said before being overcome with pleasure.  <br />
<br />
She instinctively grabbed his cock and jacked off. his body was changing rapidly.  purple fur spread up his arms. more muscles grew to match his legs. above his now firm butt, a cotton tail appeared.  <br />
<br />
light purple fur grew on his front. his female form was shifting to a male one. his breasts shrank into firm pecs. he smiled with his cartoon mouth as his two front teeth grew into a single buck tooth. his face pushed out into a small muzzle.  <br />
<br />
his nose shrank into a pink triangle at its front. more light purple fur ran over his Addams apple and muzzle. his blond hair turned a deep purple and shrank to his neck. it then became messy and his bangs grew out. Because of toon logic, it missed his eyes barely.  <br />
<br />
the biggest change was his ears. they shrank into his head the popped out from the top of his head. his big ears were pink on the inside and tipped with light purple. he soon cumed onto his mirrors. &quot;wow forgot how much the old carrot stick could make. You guys ok?&quot; he asked his mirror versions.  <br />
<br />
each of them gave a thumbs up. in the next shot, Oliver Big-Ears was dressed in his usual outfit. gray pants with a white shirt. he also wore a black biker jacket. he then heard a splash. looking in the pond he saw his wife gasping for air.  <br />
<br />
it was ironic considering they were cartoons and her own body. she was a giant anthro truck rabbit toon. basically think about transforming vehicles and add a rabbit to it. &quot;take a deeper dive than you meant&quot; he joked to her. &quot;hey this pool is deceptively big&quot; she said as she grabbed a tree to get out.  <br />
<br />
now that Tass was out she was 15 feet tall. that was about double Oliver&#39;s current height of 7&#39;6. &quot;well hope your interiors dry cause we gotta get to Fetchly farms&quot; he said to her. &quot;don&#39;t worry Olly we can still help out the Fetchlys. Hop on in&quot; she said as she changed into her truck version.  <br />
<br />
it was practically identical to the truck that had melted. this cartoon version had a more rabbit-like appearance to it. the drove beneath the bright cartoon sign. <br />
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------meanwhile----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
Chief Burnie was standing by the scientist. &quot;how&#39;d this happen?&quot; he said while gesturing to the cartoon shelf. the floor was now slowly becoming toon. &quot;my best guess sir is this stuff dissolved due to air. with it being a vacuum-tight seal no air.&quot; they watched as a man in a hazmat suit opened one of the jars.  <br />
<br />
the contents began dissolving immediately. the other containers seemed to suddenly begin shaking. before chief Burnie could warn the hazmat person the jars exploded. he had been fortunate to avoid the splatter, the scientist and hazmat person weren&#39;t so lucky. the scientist and the hazmat person&#39;s bodies begin to change. &quot;here we go again&quot;.</p>
