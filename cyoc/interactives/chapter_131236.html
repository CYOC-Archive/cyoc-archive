<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">-Jonathon-<br />
<br />
Jonathan found himself on top of the stairs to the basement of the mansion. He looked down and could only see darkness at the bottom. Jonathon whimpered a little. It looked too dark, like something could be easily concealed within there. But he wanted to get away from the group, just to get some alone time. So, he took the first step, and then the next. Slowly descending into the Basement.<br />
He was surrounded by darkness, He blindly reached for a light switch, but had no prevail. So, Jonathan got out the second-best thing, his iPhone with the double blazing lights. <br />
<br />
Strangely enough, the lights barely illuminated the room. It was strange, he had just gotten them fixed last week. Still at least he could see now. Jonathan continued forward exploring this strange and bizarre place. There were shelves of empty canisters, labelled with weird names. There were virus and antibodies which Jonathan had never seen before. It looked like some infirmary. <br />
<br />
So, he was shocked to find that the basement had another set of stairs, Strange this building goes even deeper. Jonathan threw his cares aside just for the joy of mystery. He walked down the second flight of stairs. The room’s walls and carpets seemed to be changed. They were metal, with no organic material seen before. Jonathan found this unnerving. What had he discovered.<br />
<br />
He was startled when his foot hit something like a chain on the ground. He looked down and examined the noise. To his horror he saw the origin, it was a broken shackle, with speckles of blood lined on it and the floor. Jonathan screamed and tried to make for the exit, but he felt something strong push into his shoulder. His vision blurred, and he fell to the ground and passed out.<br />
 <br />
-Mike and Sei-<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Mike and Sei had been preparing for a satisfying night out. They were getting changed and had already ordered the tables for this nice restaurant nearby. They didn’t want to stay in the mansion for long, they were only here because Erick invited them. <br />
“I’m looking forward to getting out of here” said Ryan, taking off his shirt. Sei walked up to him from behind and massaged his muscles “Me too Babe…” Mike comforted Sei and they both left the room.<br />
<br />
They both had made it to the landing before they heard it, a scream from upstairs, It was a girl’s scream which sounded strangely familiar to Sei. Sei startled looked around “What was that”. Mike dropped his bag and ran upstairs looking for the epicentre of the noise. Sei followed slowly behind. But lost Mike round one of the corners. He was gone. Sei was on her own. The mansion seemed a lot darker now. Sei looked around scared and called out for Mike. Her voice seemed like a whisper even though she put a lot of emphasis into it. Sei was confused and tried shouting his name, again it was barely audible.<br />
<br />
Sei was panicking now and made for one of the corridors. But she ended back up in the landing, Strange…she didn’t want to backtrack on herself. She looked around, the candles previously illuminated on the chandelier were stone cold. With only a few whispers of smoke floating off. <br />
<br />
Sei, walked down the landing and was startled again by a sudden piano clang. She spinned around and saw the piano. It was silent stagnant like some silent predator. Camouflaged in the dark. Sei walked slowly up to it, edging her way to the fear. The piano was inanimate it wasn’t alive, Sei must be going crazy. She put her hand slowly down on the piano, she made a brief contact with it before she felt the pain.<br />
<br />
She screamed in agony, her hand was burning, She tried to lift it away from the piano but she couldn’t, it seemed stuck to the active site. She screamed again, but then realized. That echoey catalyst which fuelled this fear, how she lost Mie. It was her scream. Mike had been sent to her pain, the pain she was feeling now.<br />
<br />
Her hand, wasn’t only being burned, but it was being absorbed by the Piano, and all this time the Piano was still silent making no movements. She put her other hand against the piano trying to push her other one off, but that was stupid mistake. Now both her hands were being absorbed by the piano she was pinned. She lifted her legs up trying to push them off. But it was agonizing she couldn’t get free. So she stopped sobbing trying to think about something else. Perhaps her relationship with Mike. She and Him felt so in love with each other. Their plans, their life together. It was all so happy.<br />
<br />
Her hands were entirely absorbed now, pushing her arms in. She remembered the time, they went to the beach and Mike brought her favourite type of ice-cream even though he didn’t know, he guessed it. Her arms were absorbed. The time they sang for Jonathan’s birthday, Mike was so drunk but didn’t miss a note. Her chest was absorbed. The re-straunt. Their p-plans. Her legs were absorbed. They were going to the mansion for a getaway. Her lower body was absorbed. But their friends came. Her neck was absorbed. They would never be alone. Her head was absorbed. They would never get a chance to live happy lives. Sei was gone…her body completely absorbed, the piano clanged a victorious sound…and then went silent. That was the first.<br />
<br />
-Ryan-<br />
<br />
Ryan had dozed off to sleep. It was his getaway from the world. He had drove a long way here, so allowed himself to meditate. Ryan had always liked the peaceful life. The calm. The Serenity. It was why he decided to work out. Why he decided to take meditating lessons. To allow perfection and complete balance.<br />
<br />
But Ryan’s meditation was interrupted by a violent shaking, He fell off the bed. And hit the ground hard. “Oof” he said calmly. He was about to get up to investigate the sudden quake. But then he heard it. A low breathing, this grunting outside his room, the shaking had stopped. But whatever it was caused by was now outside the room. The voice was deep and rough. Ryan peeked out from the other side of the bed. It must off be some sort of monster.<br />
<br />
The shaking started again, and the monster moved away from the door. Ryan stood up shaken by what he just saw. He calmed himself down with some exercised breathing and decided to find Jonathan, to see if he was okay. Ryan opened the door slowly. The monster was gone. Good. <br />
<br />
Ryan walked carefully up the stairs. He had taken liking to the cellar. It was opposite the basement and even Erick acknowledged how flawed the house was. <br />
<br />
He then heard something else, A scream of one of his friends. Sei. Ryan bolted towards the sound but came across someone else. Mike. “R-Ryan?” He said slowly. “M-mike did you hear that…It sounded like Sei”.<br />
<br />
Mike looked at his confused “What are you talking about Sie’s with me right here” he looked around but Sei wasn’t there. Mike started to panic “W-where did she go?” he said.<br />
<br />
Ryan looked at his friend with concern “Don’t worry I’ll find her, Erick gave me a map. It’s still in my room”. Mike looked and him with happiness and accepted his offer “Okay…I’m going to find Erick…this mansion is weird…why would he invite us here”.<br />
<br />
Ryan didn’t know…but was now concerned with his brother’s safety. He headed down the stairs back to his room and prepare to find Sei.<br />
<br />
-Erick-<br />
<br />
Erick was sending messages to his friend Maisy, He was finding his group date a big poor. He was hoping to get some decent Banta with Ryan but that seemed to fail, make fun of his little brother Jonathan but that seemed to fail, and judge Sie’s and Mikes relationship goals. Basically, this entire trip was a disaster to Erick. He had planned it carefully and with accuracy but that all seemed to fail.<br />
<br />
Erick decided enough was enough. He brought this big house for the weekend he wasn’t just going to waste it. So he left his room, and headed for the landing to try and group some of the people up to have some enjoyment. Even Jonathan who Erick didn’t like that much. Just some conversation to fill his chat boner. <br />
<br />
His phone rang, And Erick immediately picked it up without seeing who it was. “Well I hope it’s one of you loners…because I am incredibly bored right now…”. His voice was cut off by a loud screaming. Erick dropped the phone before the person could answer. Erick looked scared into the darkness. He only realised it now, but this house was insanely dark at night. <br />
<br />
“Umm…hello…” he said jokily. This was probably some big prank by Ryan. He enjoyed these little things as well as meditating which Erick found kind of weird. Erick picked up his phone, the call was ended but Erick didn’t recognise the number. He called the number anyway to see who his prank caller was.<br />
<br />
The phone ringed…and ringed…and ringed. Until suddenly it cut…there was a lot of breathing and Erick could hear the fear it was a girl. “Mike!” the voice said. Erick immediately recognised it as Sie’s voice. “Sei it’s me not…Ryan”. Erick was walking now…back to the landing.<br />
<br />
The phone was silent…but Erick still kept listening “Hello Sie? Are you still with us?” Erick joked. He walked down the landing. Suddenly the voice shouted “MIKE!!” Erick was startled, but then he saw something a lot more eery. The piano…was open. It was dark, but Erick could make it out. The voice didn’t come from the phone…it came from the piano.<br />
<br />
Erick turned towards it…scared now. He walked forwards and looked inside it and he saw…the most horrifying thing in his life.<br />
<br />
-End of Chapter 1-<br />
<br />
Sorry there was no transformation in this one. Sei&#39;s absorption was kind of one. But there&#39;ll be differently one in the next part. I&#39;m just setting up the story. Now onto Chapter 2.</p>
