<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Xandal pressed down on the screen a few times as he quickly familiarized himself with the app.  “So, I just select you as a target and hit generate sentence?”  Steve rolled back until his chair bumped up against the desk, nodding at Xandal as he nervously clutched his belly.  <br />
<br />
The miasma from earlier still hung in the air, though it seemed to have diminished somewhat.  Steve knew that Xandal’s preferences were the same as his – they both had a thing for anthro women who were forced to undergo difficult, and sometimes impossible births.  As Steve continued to rub his pregnant belly, he could only hope that Xandal had managed to resist the app’s influence.  Or, at the very least, that Steve’s friendship with Xandal was strong enough that Steve wouldn’t end up as the man that Xandal was going to force into motherhood.<br />
<br />
Another tap on the screen, and Xandal looked up at Steve, “It says: ‘Steve is looking at *her* friend.”  Xandal placed a lot of emphasis on the word ‘her’, none of which was lost on Steve.  <br />
<br />
“Please, Xandal, just…”  Steve stopped as he realized that Xandal was nodding at the screen behind him.  <br />
<br />
“She’s a slave, right?  This thing turned you into a slave?”  Once again, Steve nodded in embarrassment.  “So, who’s your master?”<br />
<br />
“I don’t know…” Steve’s soft, girly voice came out so timidly that he hoped Xandal wouldn’t catch the lie.  Besides, what was he supposed to do, tell Xandal the truth?  Xandal didn’t think that Steve was a saint, but Steve didn’t want to find out how Xandal would react to what he had done back at the community center.  <br />
<br />
“The app doesn’t alter anyone’s memory and the changes it makes are pretty limited.”  Steve gestured around the apartment, “it will change your clothes but not your apartment.  I think… the app gave me a slave’s body, but it didn’t create an owner.”<br />
<br />
A sinister smile began to worm its way onto Xandal’s face as he continued to look at the app.  “Well, Steve, I’m half temped to change ‘friend’ to ‘breeder’ but who knows what kind of dragon I’d end up as, or if I’d even fit in the room.”<br />
<br />
“Xandal… please…” Steve stuttered as tears began to bead up in his eyes.<br />
<br />
“So how about I turn friend into… mistress…?” <br />
<br />
“No, please don’t…” Steve cried as Xandal tapped the screen one last time, “please, Mistress, don’t…”  Steve had tried to say Xandal, but that’s not what had come out of his mouth.  No, he realized, he would never get to say that word again, not unless he was instructed to do so.  As had been the case with Leon before, Steve’s body was only capable of addressing his former friend in one way – by saying the word that the app had bonded them together with: Mistress.<br />
<br />
The golden fur sprouting out over Xandal’s body clued Steve into the next meaning of that word – Xandal hadn’t just claimed ownership of Steve’s body, he had deliberately altered his own being, and his own gender.  <br />
<br />
Xandal’s mouth pushed out into a leonine muzzle as his ears migrated to the top of his head.  His clothes shifted, until he was wearing a crop top and a short skirt, both of which revealed even more of the tawny fur, as well as the two firm nipples pressing out the fabric on top of them.  “Ooh!” Xandal jumped as one of his hands pressed into his flat crotch while the other reached behind… herself to grab the ropey, tasseled tail snaking out from under her dress.<br />
<br />
The new lioness just ran her hands along her knew body, exploring it as though she didn’t quite believe it to be true, only to grasp at her belly button as she let out a soft moan.  Steve watched as Xandal’s belly pressed out into her hands, rapidly inflating until there was a pop and her belly button inverted.  Within a few seconds, the masculinity that had previously dripped out of Xandal’s body was completely gone, replaced instead with a petite, feminine lioness whose exposed belly was a deliberate message to the world that said: ‘Look at this soon to be mommy.’<br />
<br />
“Mhmm,” Xandal cooed as she ran her furry paws over her stomach, “I can’t feel it in there moving around.  It feels so… right.”  The lioness looked up and stared straight into Steve’s eyes, “I can’t wait to give birth, can’t you?”<br />
<br />
From the lips of his cunt to the nipples on her six breasts, the pregnant skunk girl rubbed her belly while wanting nothing more than to yell: ‘No!  I don’t want to give birth!  I don’t want to be a mother, much less a girl!  Just change me back!’  But instead, all he said was, “Mistress, I can’t give birth.  I was bred too early, and my hips can’t accommodate the dragon inside of me.”<br />
<br />
Fuck… fuck!  What Steve wanted didn’t matter, not to his body, not anymore.  Despite the combination of terror and rage over Xandal’s seeming betrayal of him, Steve’s body simply responded to the question it had been asked in a dull, impassioned tone.<br />
<br />
“Well, lets see if we can do something to fix that,” Xandal smiled as she tapped at the screen a few more times.  “Ah, here we go, this sentence says: ‘Steve can feel the dragon inside of her while she rubs her belly.’  You said that this app automatically corrects the syntax, right?  So how about we add the word ‘three’ in front of dragon, do you think that would work?”<br />
<br />
Once again, Steve body replied and the best he could do was to try to direct the response to something helpful.  “Mistress, my stomach already feels like it’s about to explode, anymore might kill me.”<br />
<br />
“Yes, but it might also create three smaller dragons that collectively occupy the same amount of space as the one currently inside of you.  You should be able to birth those, right?”<br />
<br />
“Mistress…”<br />
<br />
“Oh, don’t be a spoiled sport, *slave*, yes I know that it might just add two more dragons to the one already inside of you.  I imagine that would be rather unpleasant for you, but it’s a chance that I’m willing take.”  <br />
<br />
The lioness tapped the screen, and Steve felt the dragon inside of him begin to squirm.</p>
