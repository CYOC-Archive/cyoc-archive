<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mike brought in the popcorn from the kitchen, as Peter continued watching a movie on the T.V.  They were waiting for Ty and Dustin to show up, and of course, they were late.  The movie wasn't interesting, and having lost the storyline ages ago, he struck up a conversation with the equally bored Peter.<br />
<br />
  &quot;So, what are the plans for tomorrow anyways?&quot;  He asked, when he clicked off the T.V.  Peter shrugged, and gave a response.  &quot;I think that Ty and Dustin are going to the gym with me.  Want to come too?&quot;<br />
The question drew a doubtful smile from Mike.  &quot;Do you think I could put forth any real effort now that I'm like this?  Being fat is great and all, but I can barely walk, let alone do lifting.&quot;<br />
<br />
  &quot;I don't know about that Mike.  After all, you won in boxing.  That show's you're already pretty strong.  Plus, me and Ty will be there in case you need any buff under that bulk.  Maybe we'll even show you what it's like to be a bodybuilder.&quot;  He said, munching on the popcorn.<br />
<br />
  &quot;How about you just fatten up, and we'll see what it's like to be sumo wrestlers?&quot;  Mike said, prodding Peter.  Peter swatted him away with a chuckle and went to the bathroom.  Mike sat there, thinking of the offers each had made, and then noticed something.  He had begun to grow again.  His over-large stomach swelled out from under his shirt, but retained it's somewhat solid nature.  His chest filled out, without sagging this time, as both fat and muscle compiled into it.  His short grew tight in only a few moments, as he found was the case with his shirt.<br />
<br />
  Peter returned to the room, and sat on the couch.  He made little notice of Mike's new weight.  Mike spoke up &quot;Thanks Peter.  I was just wanting some new weight right about now.  But you forgot to make my clothes grow.&quot;  He tugged at the shirt in an attempt to pull it down over his body.  Peter responded in a matter of fact tone &quot;We both know you don't want that.  I'm pretty sure you'd rather gain weight until you grow out of those clothes altogether.&quot;<br />
<br />
  A knock came from the door, and Mike struggled to get up to answer.  It was a lost cause, however.  His now 450 pound body was a bit too cumbersome at the moment, and it appeared that it would only become more so as time passed.  Peter answered the door in his stead, and found Ty standing on the stoop.  Apparently, Dustin would be unable to join them.<br />
<br />
  Ty entered the living room after getting changed into his pajama shorts.  He saw Mike waving at him, a bit bigger than last time.  &quot;You will never, ever want to stop growing, will you Mike?&quot; Ty said in a joking manner.  Mike laughed a bit  &quot;Well, I do want to stop... just not before I gain a tonne or two.&quot;<br />
 <br />
  &quot;Mike, two tonnes would be around 5000 pounds...&quot;  Peter said cautiously.  Mike responded &quot;I know, sounds great huh?  You know, you guys should try being fat with me tonight.  Then maybe I'll try your muscle thing tomorrow.  We can eat and get big all night long!&quot;<br />
<br />
  &quot;It's actually a pretty cool feeling, Peter.  Have you ever tried it before?&quot;  Ty asked.  Peter tried to remember, as he had done many changes &quot;Actually, I've never tried being a fat guy...&quot;  Mike looked at him funny  &quot;That's the best option those powers of yours have!  Though, I may be a bit biased.&quot;  he said when he jiggled his gut.<br />
<br />
  &quot;So, Peter... You want to try?&quot;  Ty prodded.  &quot;I know I'll do it.&quot;  Peter looked at the full length mirror in the living room, and studied his body.  He hadn't been fat before, and he wondered what it was like.  &quot;Guys, I'm willing to try anything once.  Especially when I can reverse it.&quot;<br />
<br />
  &quot;That's the spirit!&quot;  Mike said in a slightly muffled tone as he chomped down a candy bar.  Ty and Peter looked at one another, and began their transformations.  It was strange to see the changes from a viewers perspective, and Mike had never seen it really happen before.  It was an odd sight, so Mike was fixated.<br />
<br />
  The growth happened in unison, it was plainly obvious in Ty who was shirtless.  Peter wore a shirt, so it was difficult to see his initial changes.  Mike watched as Ty began to look like his own 180 pound frame from day's before.  A small stomach, and un-noticable chest.  He was big, but not in a way most would notice.  Peter's change was beginning to become evident as his shirt bulged slightly in the front.  <br />
<br />
  Ty began to show love handles as the weight piled on.  His chest slowly ballooned, as his stomach swelled and butt blew out.  Peter's defined biceps slowly blurred, as his arms became pudgier.  Mike sat in a daze watching his two friends growing before him.  Ty and Peter felt chills go up their spines as their thighs met.  <br />
<br />
  In a few moments, Peter's stomach began to lift his shirt, and his chest began to spread out of the arm holes of the wife-beater.  He swelled at an accelerated rate, and his clothes stretched to fit.  They had gotten tight by now, and both he and Ty looked about two sizes too big for their clothes.  Ty's stomach began to flop down over the waistband of his small shorts.  The boys appeared to be around 225 pounds each.  The swelling sped up as the boys passed 250.  <br />
<br />
  Peter watched his stomach swelling out in front of him, and he began to loose his balance.  He caught himself on Ty's flabby arm, so he wouldn't land on the coffee table.  At over 300 pounds, that would do quite a bit of damage.  The two showed no signs of stopping.  Ty felt funny, as his clothes began to become tight again.  Probably Peter playing a joke on him.  The shorts began to split down the seat as he approached 400 pounds.  It wasn't long before the boys stood together at a whopping 450 pounds, like Mike.  <br />
<br />
  The three boys sat down on the floor, in clothes that were far too small.  They had a good laugh as they appreciated their stomachs and filled out forms, and they spent the rest of the night eating and growing more.  By the morning, each of the boys had surpassed 600 pounds, though none would stay that way.  They readied themselves for the gym.</p>
