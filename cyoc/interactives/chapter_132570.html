<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">William woke up directly in front of the clock in the room, groggy and confused. He felt so tired that he might have just fallen asleep on the floor again had it not been for the time 2:20 glaring at him to shock him awake. He quickly got up and woke up Dillon, yelling incoherently about how they had class in just a few minutes. Scrambling, the two boys had no choice but to disregard their friends or the reason for their current state. Instead, they grabbed their backpacks and sprinted out of Johnathan and William&#39;s dorm.<br />
<br />
By the time they had gotten to class, Dillon was out of breath. He needed to focus on cardio more, he thought to himself. Looking down at his massive muscles, he realized just how often he&#39;d skipped running in favor of getting buff. Secretly, even though all the boys said they&#39;d done it for their safety, they really wanted to get in shape to impress girls. Being conspiracy theorists meant they were often labelled nutjobs and that didn&#39;t impress the fairer sex, so there was a strong part of them that believed that this would be their key to success. It hadn&#39;t exactly panned out yet, but that didn&#39;t mean it couldn&#39;t happen.<br />
<br />
As they stealthily took their seats to avoid disrupting the class, William accidentally caught the eye of the professor, who simply looked at them with disgust. The look gave William an immense amount of shame but somehow also excited him. Odd, he thought. Usually, he wouldn&#39;t even care if he was late. William believed he was already smarter than the professors anyways and only went to class to know what would be on the tests. In fact, if not for Dillon&#39;s judicious personality, he&#39;d likely have confidently walked in late everyday this semester. <br />
<br />
Now, however, the guilt was so bad that it made him not want to be late ever again. Unless he would be punished for it, he thought. Wait, where had that come from? In the past, Willam never believed he deserved punishment, so why did he feel like he should get one now?<br />
<br />
As the William contemplated these thoughts, Dillon was having his own shock. Even though they were late, Dillon was quite possibly one of the best students in the college. So why was it that he couldn&#39;t understand a thing about the lecture? He could hear every word the professor was saying, but the concepts just didn&#39;t click as they always would. In fact, his brain was starting to almost hurt from the multiple attempts.<br />
<br />
While the two boys were struggling in their own ways, Dillon to understand the concepts being taught and William to get over the guilt and excitement over doing something wrong, Nicholas and Johnathan were just starting to wake up. Just like William and Dillon, they were feeling very groggy and tired. Jonathan was glad he didn&#39;t have any classes today. As he stood up to check on the website, he wasn&#39;t surprised to see that the screen simply had the words, &quot;Congrats on finding out your truth! Share if you agree with your results!&quot;, displayed. Johnathan rolled his eyes at the message. The entire forum had been tricked into believing what was basically a cheap parlor trick, including his group. He couldn&#39;t even remember what the results were, it was that stupid, he thought. He closed the tab and began scouring through the other forum posts as Nicholas finally got up.<br />
<br />
&quot;What happened?&quot; Nicholas groaned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Must&#39;ve been some stupid trick from that useless quiz. The entire thing was just a joke of some kind,&quot; Johnathan answered. Nicholas just shrugged and brought up another chair so they could browse the forum together. As he did, the brown -haired columnist felt an odd desire to pose as he saw the camera that was somehow no longer covered by cloth. Shaking his head to get rid of the thought, he focused in on the forum so the two could discuss the topics together, unconscious of the fact that he was clearly showing his chest off to the camera as they browsed.<br />
<br />
Due to the new found website, however, most of the posts were all on one topic. It appeared that some people still took issue with the oddities of the site, which Johnathan and Nicholas had chosen to ignore. Soon, however, the combination of the heat and the lack of good topics caused Johnathan&#39;s frustration to reach a tipping point, so he stripped off his shirt to cool off.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dude, what are you doing?&quot; Nicholas asked, bewildered.<br />
<br />
&quot;What? We&#39;re both guys and I&#39;m hot and annoyed, let me be,&quot; Johnathan responded, annoyed. He closed out of the forum tabs and opened up a couple of streaming sites, quick to turn on their favorite channels and distract them from both of their weird antics. In reality, Johnathan was just as confused as Nicholas over his actions. Looking down at his chiseled stature that was covered in a coat of thick blonde hair, he thought  about what he did. Sure he was feeling hot, but that didn&#39;t explain why he would be so comfortable with being shirtless in front of other guys when no one besides his parents had ever seen him without his trademark Polo and jeans. Hell, no one had even seen him in swim trunks ever since he learned about a convoluted theory connecting the ocean to homosexuality. And he didn&#39;t go to water parks because he &quot;didn&#39;t believe&quot; in chlorine. Johnathan was quite reserved in that regard. So why was this feeling so good? And more importantly, why did he want to take off more?</p>
