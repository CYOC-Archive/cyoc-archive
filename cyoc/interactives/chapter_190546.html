<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Discussing the wedding was something this early was a bit of a surprise, but to a degree it would be expected. The thing that essentially set you and Luna together as a romantic couple two nights ago was not what many would expect to lead to a quick marriage, but then most such interactions probably weren&#39;t the result of simultaneously finding out the girl you liked liked you in return and was about to become a MILF-wolf because of her being born one. Thus, in becoming a MILF-wolf, you&#39;d gotten Luna pregnant and found she loved you too. That then made getting married something of a responsibility, and Kellie and Roxie would probably want it before Luna&#39;s pregnancy became obvious for all to see. You could accept that and seeing Luna smile to you that morning made you fine with that. The real surprise was that your father would want to be involved in the planning.<br />
<br />
&quot;You and &quot;mom&quot; would be invited, obviously,&quot; you said to your father and noting his own smile in response, something that made you glad that some of your worries about his politics causing trouble because you were transgender proved to be overblown. You didn&#39;t think that he&#39;d likely changed his mind on the general position, but it did seem that you specifically were an exception to that stance on your father&#39;s part, and that made him more than welcome for the discussion in a way, &quot;though... I wasn&#39;t aware you were into the whole planning thing...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I had to do it twice,&quot; your father answered, &quot;Once with Abigail and once with your birth mother... it can be a big thing... Thus, why I called in a vacation day to help with this...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We were leaning more toward something small,&quot; Luna spoke up, &quot;more just a justice of the peace and a few friends and/or family. Partially in that since Nickie and are both women... anything bigger would be complicated.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah...&quot; your father said slowly, &quot;I think one church gave a ruling with MILF-wolves that any man who becomes a MILF-wolf and marries the MILF-wolf that turned him, that marriage would be seen as &quot;M/F&quot; in the pairing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That was the Catholic Church,&quot; Roxie answered, &quot;and interesting that in a way they&#39;d take a more... progressive interpretation of doctrine, but all the Protestant Churches have argued that the gender is what it is, and would thus view Nickie as female, regardless of her birth gender and use that to attack her and Luna.&quot;<br />
<br />
Your father didn&#39;t say anything immediately in response and ultimately nodded. You watched as he did take a deep breath before nodding, though.<br />
<br />
&quot;Anyway,&quot; your father then picked up, &quot;even with SMALL weddings, the work that goes into them can be big. The justice of the peace should be easy to get, but there is also the question of where you have the wedding and getting permission for the area.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Roxie and I can arrange for that easily,&quot; Kellie said to him, which again got your father to nod.<br />
<br />
&quot;That would then leave the question on where you&#39;d want to have the wedding or any of the post wedding events,&quot; your father commented.<br />
<br />
You looked over to Luna who shrugged and nodded, as that would be a decision that would need to be made, and it seemed like your father wanted to be involved in the discussion.<br />
<br />
&quot;I thought a spot in the park would actually be nice,&quot; Luna commented after a moment, &quot;we often get a lot of good weather and it looks nice.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Which park though?&quot; you asked her, &quot;I think there&#39;s like three parks in town.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Founders Park,&quot; Luna answered, &quot;in the center of town. The trees are big enough to provide shade and they have a pavilion type thing there where the actual ceremony could be. That wouldn&#39;t be too hard, would it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I wouldn&#39;t think it&#39;d be hard,&quot; Kellie commented.<br />
<br />
You nodded and thought that would be a great idea, particularly as Luna thought of it. Though a glance to your father found his hand under his chin and his pointer finger raised up and moving forward and backward across his upper lip. It was something that gave an indication that he was really thinking about something.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is something wrong, dad?&quot; you asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not necessarily,&quot; your dad answered, &quot;founders park would have the largest amount of space to use for a wedding. Thus if there is any sort of pack obligation that would bring others in... you wouldn&#39;t face any space issues. And maybe that would allow for amicable interactions between guests...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You say that like that would be a bad thing, Mr. Maxwell,&quot; Luna commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;That part isn&#39;t,&quot; your father answered, &quot;the bad part is more that A LOT of people use that park. It has the big play ground set for kids to play on. It&#39;s close enough to the main roads going in and out of town, which means you could have a lot of engine noise going on in the background, not to mention guests that weren&#39;t invited because they&#39;re there to use the park. Even with permission to use the park... I don&#39;t think the city could or would shut it down for a wedding.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They could rope off the specific area for the wedding,&quot; Kellie commented, &quot;and if it&#39;s near the pavilion, the wedding would actually be away from the areas where the playground is. So that wouldn&#39;t be a problem.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;d be good,&quot; your father said with a nod.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;d also be looking for a small wedding and ceremony,&quot; you added, &quot;so it&#39;s not like this is going to be a big and long lasting thing that traffic would really mess with.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I was also thinking that two PM to three PM,&quot; Luna spoke up, &quot;most of those not invited to the wedding and said they could attend probably wouldn&#39;t be driving around at the time. Thus with something small, there shouldn&#39;t be any problem.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re sure....&quot; your father said slowly, and actually looking a bit nervous, &quot;wouldn&#39;t there be some place a bit more... I don&#39;t know... &quot;natural&quot; and thus free of traffic?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I really don&#39;t think the traffic around Founders Park is that bad,&quot; Luna answered, actually sounding slightly irritated and you reached out to take her hand in yours. Luna gripped it almost as quickly as you reached for it.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s really worrying you, dad?&quot; you asked.<br />
<br />
Your dad could be as tough as nails when he wanted to be, and there was rarely anything that would really make him nervous. There were things that made him angry, and you remembered your stepmom being there to calm him down after those sorts of things, most often politics or sports related, but you really couldn&#39;t remember him ever sounding as nervous as he did now.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d just want things to go smoothly for you,&quot; your father answered, &quot;and not... not like how mine and your mother&#39;s first attempt went.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;First attempt?&quot; you blinked as this was something you didn&#39;t remember hearing about before.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d had everything planned out to make your mother happy and make her the center of attention,&quot; your father answered, &quot;it was scheduled for a nice church followed by what was intended to be a reception at a nice restaurant. It cost me a pretty penny, but I felt your mother was more than worth it. Unfortunately, despite having what I thought to be the perfect time and place... a drunk driver arrived the church at about the same time we did. No one was hurt, but the church&#39;s entry was pretty well smashed and the church had to cancel the wedding for that day. I lost a lot in that... and while your mother and I did get married and the second attempt had no problems... but I just feel that what happened with the first attempt made that lesser. I wanted it to be perfect. What happened was anything but.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And you&#39;re wanting to prevent something like that for me and Luna?&quot; you asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re my kid... male or female,&quot; your father answered, &quot;and I&#39;d always wanted you to succeed... and...&quot;<br />
<br />
He stopped for a moment, making you look to him and you noticed a tear going down his cheek as you did so.<br />
<br />
&quot;You look so much like your mother,&quot; your father then said to you.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks dad,&quot; you managed as you felt Luna squeeze your hand, &quot;and thank you for caring... but we both know that mom loved you all the same, regardless of the drunk driver.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And I don&#39;t think you could have expected or known about the drunk driver, Mr. Maxwell,&quot; Luna added, &quot;so that wasn&#39;t your fault.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not to mention that unforeseen events can arise anywhere,&quot; Roxie spoke up, &quot;we could go out onto public land. Places where normal werewolves and MILF-wolves like us may normally hunt deer. We&#39;d be away from all the pressures and concerns of human society... but you could also have deer or other mundane animals crash the wedding as well.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I just don&#39;t want anything to happen that would ruin things...&quot; your father said slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;And I&#39;m sure nothing like that will happen,&quot; you assured him, &quot;Founders Park is safe, and it&#39;ll still be a small ceremony, so it wouldn&#39;t take long.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And that&#39;s what you want?&quot; your father asked.<br />
<br />
You looked to Luna, who nodded and then looked back to your father.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah dad, that is what we&#39;d want,&quot; you told him.</p>
