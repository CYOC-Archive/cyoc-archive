<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The sun shone on Will Barnes as he walked out towards his car, heading to school. He sat in the car as Thalia, his beautiful girlfriend, got in the passenger seat, scrolling on her phone. Couldn&#39;t they talk while driving, for once? Or had their morning fuck been enough relationship-time for her for the next few hours? Will unconsciously smiled at the thought. Just an hour ago, he&#39;d been balls deep in her, her warm, slick pussy pressing tightly against his cock. They&#39;d gone at it raw - Thalia was on the pill, and besides, it was difficult for Will to come by any condoms that would fit him. He&#39;d contemplated bringing it up with his friends, but he didn&#39;t like to brag, and although they would believe him - after that session some weeks ago - they would probably take it as boasting. <br />
<br />
And that wasn&#39;t his style. You didn&#39;t get to be the most popular guy if you only bragged about what was obvious, or boasted about what couldn&#39;t be seen. Instead of talking about his gains and how much he benched, he wore fitted clothes to highlight his physique. Instead of talking about all the girls he&#39;d fucked - before his relationship with Thalia of course - he let the rumors serve him. He didn&#39;t exclude nerds or less imposing guys from his circle of friends, he was friends with everyone. That was the reason for why he kept inviting guys like Jake and Peter to events, although he&#39;d really come to enjoy their friendship, especially with Jake. <br />
&quot;Hey handsome? You&#39;re coming with to Jess&#39; after school, right?&quot; Thalia had taken a break from the scrolling, and he answered, deep in thought, &quot;Yeah, of course&quot; then kept thinking about his buds. <br />
<br />
He still hadn&#39;t met anyone who really... got him. Understood him. Who was his equal, who knew how it felt to always be idolized and stuff, and how it felt to not really be part of the gang. He had Thalia, of course, but she wasn&#39;t alone on the top, she had her girl friends, and it wasn&#39;t really the same - he didn&#39;t have a guy friend that he could just talk to, knowing that the person would get it. The closest one to it was Mark, but he was too obnoxious towards others, always talking about his workouts. Unexpectedly, Jake and Peter, the two beanpoles,  had proven to be really good conversation partners, especially Jake, who just seemed to understand Will in a really special way. The only drawback was that each was about two inches taller than him, but he outweighed them by about fifty pounds, sixty in Jake&#39;s case. Because of that, it looked like they felt lesser than him, less confident in themselves. Perhaps he could change that in the following year. <br />
<br />
He knew that he and Jake would be having AP US Government together, and they would all three be having AP Bio, along with other familiar faces such as Elijah, Isaac, Mark and George. Maybe he could talk Jake into working out with him at the gym? Although the guy had been acting kinda skittish towards him after he&#39;d learned that Will&#39;s dick was bigger. When he&#39;d told Thalia, she had just said that Jake was stupid if he let his penis size ruin his self confidence, and besides, she could barely fit Will inside her as it was. Will understood him, though. There was something about a man&#39;s dick that was just inherently telling about his masculinity, and although Jake was plenty big, Will was already so much more manly all the other places. He pulled up to the school parking lot. &quot;Ready, beautiful?&quot; Thalia shot him one of her boning looks, which seemed unnecessary at the moment. &quot;Sure thing, sexy.&quot;<br />
   __________<br />
<br />
New guy Kenny was being shown around by the class clown Elijah when a ... presence... entered the hallway. He turned to see the most jockish-looking boy ever, accompanied by the hottest girl he&#39;d ever seen in real life, walk down the hall. While his stare still was fixed towards the pair, he softly patted Elijah on the shoulder. He turned, saw Kenny&#39;s presumably awed expression and said &quot;Yeah, that&#39;s Will and Thalia.&quot; He had this air of understanding about him as he spoke. &quot;They&#39;re the two most popular people in the district, I&#39;d say.&quot; And that was understandable. Thalia was statuesque, an icy queen of people. She was quite tall, with a fit, toned physique and a rack that drew the attention despite being of not spectacular size. Her heart-shaped face was framed in by jet black hair, contrasting with her pale complexion. Her expression, queenly. Her boyfriend was king among men. Probably somewhere around 6&#39;2&quot;, he was broad-shouldered and muscular, with a strong jawline and high, chiseled cheekbones. Deep set eyes under thick eyebrows, all framed by  chocolate-colored hair. His arms were noticeably thick, while his pecs pushed out against his shirt. He walked with the swagger of a guy who didn&#39;t need to announce to the world that he was there, because he drew their attention anyway. Damn. Just... just damn. &quot;So, are we continuing the tour, or...?&quot; Elijah interrupted. &quot;Anyway, this way...&quot;<br />
  _______<br />
<br />
Will walked into his Gov class, looking for the thin, gangly figure that would be Jake, finally giving up and turning towards an unfamiliar guy with a big mop of blonde hair. &quot;Sorry, mind if I sit here?&quot; He knew the guy wouldn&#39;t mind; most would probably just enjoy being in Will&#39;s company. But maybe this guy finally was different? When he turned his head, however, Will did a double take. <br />
&quot;Why of course, good sir,&quot; Jake joked with a grin, &quot;I shall be most pleased with making your acquaintance. Or d&#39;you prefer the Aussie accent? What? Bro, something wrong?&quot; Will shook out of it. Jake was a rail-thin skeleton, while this guy was not. He wasn&#39;t beefy, in any sense of the word, he couldn&#39;t really be called athletic either, but he filled out his shirt a bit more. But he did have Jake&#39;s hair and face, though. And his stupid sense of humor.<br />
&quot;No, nothing.&quot; He sat down while discreetly scanning Jake&#39;s body, his friend going through the textbook as the dutiful nerd he was. &quot;Hey bro, you&#39;ve been working out or something?&quot; Jake froze slightly, then continued leafing through the book, probably thinking Will hadn&#39;t noticed. <br />
&quot;Actually, yeah, I did a few push-ups this weekend. You?&quot; he answered, obviously deflecting, but Will wasn&#39;t going to push him on it when he clearly didn&#39;t want to. &quot;No, not this weekend.&quot; He opened his own text book.</p>
