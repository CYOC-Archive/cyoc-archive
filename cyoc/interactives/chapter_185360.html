<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was only about a minute later that Sam and his group of friends approached the bar. It was Sam who addressed her “We’ve been over 3 hours now so we should be able to change back. What happens?”<br />
<br />
“If you like you buy some more Swap Scotches. How many? Do you all want to revert?”<br />
<br />
“How about we stay like this for the night Sam. I’ll show you a good time” It was the woman who had accosted Matthew in the ladies.<br />
<br />
“Maybe another time Jess” Sam replied. “I’d like to regain my parts if you don’t mind”<br />
<br />
One of the other male faces spoke up “We’ll actually stay like this for the night” he said. The apparent female on his arm giggled.<br />
<br />
The third apparent male quickly spoke up. “That will be two pinks and two blues” It was a female voice that came out of his male head. <br />
<br />
“Not game to try things out Charlie?” questioned the male head who wasn’t planning to revert. <br />
<br />
“On the contrary, myself and Alice have decided we are going to go the full way. What time do you re-open tomorrow night?” Matthew realised this last question was directed at her. She didn’t know the answer.<br />
<br />
However she was saved by Charlie’s partner, a redhead. “No Charlie. If we a going to do this let’s make it the whole weekend. We can swap back on Monday after you have done a day’s work as my secretary” A male voice had come out of her female looking mouth.<br />
<br />
There was silence for a moment before Charlie nodded his head. “Fair enough. In for a penny in for a pound”<br />
<br />
“So still two pinks and two blues?” Matthew asked. Credit cards were handed over and Matthew accepted payment then dialled up the required drinks. She also passed the couples a key each to the change rooms.<br />
<br />
The two couples due for a swap swallowed their drinks, Matthew observed that it was the woman from the toilets, Jess, who drank the pink. Sam drank blue. the couples took the keys and left. The remaining couple ordered another drink while they waited. Matthew heard them discussing the situation. The woman asked. “Should we do the same as Charlie and Alice?”<br />
<br />
“Maybe another time” The male replied. “Let’s see how tonight goes first”<br />
<br />
“Maybe for my birthday?” the woman suggested. Matthew noticed she was wearing a wedding ring.<br />
<br />
“No promises” the man replied “But I’m not ruling it out”<br />
<br />
Other people had come to the bar so Matthew had to take their orders. She was kept busy for the next 10 minutes and cleared the queue just in time to see Charlie and Alice returning. Clearly it was Charlie now in the heels and the body-hugging dress. She was unsteady on her feet. The new male Charlie had a big grin on his face. They were greeted with hugs and kisses by the other couple. Matthew heard the woman who had stayed at the bar say “I thought Sam and Jess would be out first. They should have been quicker”<br />
<br />
“Maybe not” suggested the new Charlie with a knowing look on his face. “The walls are thin and I think Charlie made a huge mistake letting Jess have the pink drink”<br />
<br />
Sure enough shortly afterwards an unhappy Jess appeared out of the change room. She was also unsteady on her feet and had her breasts back and there was no longer a bulge in the front of her short skirt. The girl had an amazing figure. The apparent Sam had a big grin on his face. <br />
 <br />
The new Jess was also greeted with hugs from her friends but she was not happy and had a scowl on her face. “Surely one night is enough?” she said to the new Sam.<br />
<br />
“No. If it’s good enough for Charlie then you can do it too. You work from home anyway and I’m perfectly sure you will make a very capable fashion consultant. You have always had an eye for women’s clothing. I’ll have all weekend to train you then we can return here on Monday night with Alice and Charlie and you will have a much improved appreciation for my life”<br />
<br />
The group departed at that point. Matthew looked at the time. It was nearly 1 am. Matthew had swapped with Sabrina at about 10.30 so in another half hour or thereabouts they could swap back. Did she want to? What would Sabrina think about extending the swap? And where was he anyhow? He had made it sound earlier that he was just running a quick errand. That was two hours ago.<br />
<br />
More of the patrons were now swapping back into their true bodies. The person with the models body and the male head was originally a female. She and her partner and the couple they were with reverted to what Matthew assumed were their true bodies. Certainly the two women had no trouble walking in their stiletto heels as they left the bar.<br />
<br />
Matthew sold two other Swap scotches to couples who had just arrived at the bar. It seemed they were couples who had been swapped for the evening and perhaps spent time in the hotel next door. They must have done their first swaps prior to Matthew’s arrival.<br />
<br />
Sabrina was still not back. It was now nearly 2 am. The bar closed at 3. She was starting to get worried. Had Sabrina done a runner and left Matthew in her body?</p>
