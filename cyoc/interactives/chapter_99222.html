<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I stared at the bathroom mirror as my hands roamed my face and neck, what had Jennifer done, I needed to find her quick and get her to undo this. <br />
<br />
My eyes widened as I watched my hand finish exploring my delicate new throat and work their way over my shoulder and back to my new breasts. They felt sore and swollen and cupping them didn&#39;t help, they hung heavier and heavier, I felt glad Jennifer hadn&#39;t wore a bra but the tank top was slowly filling. I needed to hurry but my hands had just started at the top of my arms.<br />
<br />
I felt my arms, my new elbows and wrists with each hand, but my eyes were glued to my chest, like watching balloons slowly being inflated, no not inflated, filled. As each grew they pulled me forward and I was having to lean back more to compensate the muscles in my back already feeling a strain. <br />
<br />
&quot;Eep&quot; I squeeked in surprised, hopping in the air as my hands grabbed my ass, the yellow and green skirt Jennifer wore seemed loose and hung awkwardly over one hip now. My hands squeezed the extra flesh and rubbed my hips and waist. I closed my eyes tightly as they migrated south over Jennifer&#39;s vagina, but the moment was soon over as they stroked my thighs and ankles, my body bending to reach my tiny bare feet below.<br />
<br />
Finally I could move, my clothes were quickly failing me, the tank top now showing Jennifer&#39;s belly button and the seems tightening, while skirt and panties felt loose and would soon be round my ankles, grabbing the hemline of the skirt in case I left the ladies toilet.<br />
<br />
Typical the only guy in the corridor at this time was Graham, a short nerdy kid. Well I was going to make his day, I looked up at him, this body couldn&#39;t have been more then 5 foot tall now and shrinking. &quot;Hi Graham, I was wondering if you would let me suck your cock&quot; I cringed, I had no idea how to say it, but it seemed so unreal what had happened and was still was happening to me. <br />
<br />
&quot;No I&#39;m ok thanks&quot; stuttered Graham, &quot;You shouldn&#39;t ask men for sex Jen, Jenifer it&#39;s bad, you should be good and only have sex when you get married&quot; he continued. My eyes grew wide, I turned my face red from embarrassment, I was the hottest girl in School and couldn&#39;t pick up a nerd like Graham. I burst out into the quad, my breasts aching, I grabbed them.<br />
<br />
There were some jocks chatting and smoking, they would be easy, &quot;hi would you, umm, would you...&quot; I tried, they stared at me and giggled &quot;Aw Jennifer&#39;s suddenly gone shy&quot; one laughed. &quot;Think she&#39;s gone off cock?&quot; Said another a big stupid grin on his face, &quot;you want pussy now eh Jennifer, I&#39;m sure Samantha would be interested, try asking her.&quot; A third said pointing across to Samantha Jones, I looked at her, with her short spiked hair, pieced nose and lip, leather jacket and ripped jeans, she was hot and as Kyle I had fancied her, but she was the biggest lesbian in the school.<br />
<br />
&quot;No I...&quot; I tried to argue, but my legs had other ideas starting a cross the Quad towards Sam, I could here chuckles behind me &quot;Oh my god she&#39;s actually doing it, I gotta film this&quot; I heard a family Jock call, his friends whistling.<br />
<br />
&quot;hi umm, Sam. I really want to talk to you, I think I&#39;m not I tested in cock and might prefer pussy&quot; my lips moving against my will. Sam looked at me in disbelief, but took my hand and led me back into the school towards the girls changing rooms. My heart was beating fast, was this going to happen? A hot skinny lesbian was going to make love to me in the changing rooms. &quot;I really like you Jen, but you best not be shitting me, you are a real lesbian not messing about&quot; she demanded. &quot;yes&quot; I squeeked, it wasn&#39;t a lie, I was still Kyle on the inside. She kissed me and my heart picked up its rytham as my stomach turned to jelly. I ran my hands through her stubbly short red hair on the back of her head and up to where it lengthened out on one side. <br />
<br />
Next thing I knew we were on the floor, my skirt and panties came off easily not even needing to be unzipped, my top was a different matter, Sam struggled to pull it over my swelling breasts and for a moment I was left in darkness arms stretched out over my head the cool air embrassing the underside of my bosom. But then freedom as I sat naked on the tiled floor the warmth of Sams body on top of me kissing me, her tongue stud rubbing against my tongue.<br />
<br />
The next moment were a blur of pleasure and pain, new feelings flooded my alien body and all too soon Sam was readjusting her top and pulling up her jeans, &quot;That was fantastic, you will meet me after school so we can do it again right&quot; she smiled mischievously. I just smiled up at her and watched her leave. The changing room was empty now and I needed to find a cock quick. I stood up instantly aware of the huge orbs painfully dangling on my stomach and grabbed my top. Popping it over my head I found my first issue, I wouldn&#39;t be squeezing my swelling titties into that thing, I wished I had a good bra and larger top, the sooner I found Kyle the better. The next issue soon became apparent as I pulled up the skirt and panties and both returned to my ankles as soon as they were released.<br />
<br />
I searched the lockers quick and found a hoody, it was huge and obviously a guys, how it came to be in a random locker didn&#39;t matter and I pulled it over my head. The rough material irritating my nipples. I looked in a mirror. I looked like a slut, a tiny huge breasted girl in a oversized men&#39;s hoody and nothin more, my bare legs and tiny feet appearing from beneath.<br />
<br />
I had to find a guy fast, I was feeling noticeably smaller and shorter and the breasts were now a real pain pulling my body around as I struggled out of the changing rooms.</p>
