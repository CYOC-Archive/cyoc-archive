<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It takes you almost forever while picking out just one suit, but eventually one costume in particular stands out from all the rest. After all, they’re just animal costumes as there&#39;s nothing to get to excited about, right? Padding softly to the hanging suits which were on the racks is when it suddenly accursed to you that you are down a dark hole, deep in the middle of who knows where in an unknown forest at night while finding something full of different costumes with no clue to who owns them as you find it a little suspicious, But All you can think about is the suit your eyes gazed and rested upon the costume of a dig cat. yet it wasn&#39;t just any big cat, but the mighty king of beast itself, the lion.<br />
<br />
The lion costume seemed the way to go as they were strong, the most proud, and fierce cats in the world, even if they sometimes just lay around doing nothing. Well, you finally admit it to yourself that you had always wished to be one since you were a child as No harm would come to you with you being a lion and all, right? Nothing measures up to something so simple, yet so complex that you do find it a bit attracting as it was Sort of in the way where some people really like to have wild types of animals as pets, even an alligator.<br />
<br />
[Being one my favorite animals would be cool!] you think to yourself as lions happened to be one of your favorite animals, along with wolves, kangaroos, hyenas, and more as it lines up. Never the less, you had decided on the lion because you considered them to be your second favorite creature in all of the animal kingdom while you reflected on how it came of no surprise to you. come on, Who couldn’t resist how cool and chilled out these big cats acted?<br />
<br />
Standing slightly over to it that you can tell with just a glance to see it&#39;s the perfect size, For a costume that is. it seems In fact that it was almost meant to be Made for you, but was it even possible? although it was only a costume as it was certainly not the real deal that it still peaked your interest, yet you resisted the ever present temptation of choosing animal costume.<br />
<br />
Walking over to the racks of suits as you started thinking on the suit that maybe you were just paranoid when these questions started popping into your thoughts, almost like you were hypnotized. The sign Did say &#39;sample costumes&#39;, but what if it just meant the first three?! what if these things belongs to someone already? even though you don&#39;t know where there from or how they got here, Should you really try out an unknown outfit?<br />
<br />
Upon  finally reaching the costume that you quickly started feeling the need to take off your clothing and strip down naked. Reaching up after doing so, you took the hook off the bar which contain the lion suit and began putting on the costume. It Almost felt amazing as you were really becoming a lion!<br />
<br />
After about maybe four minutes of struggling to fit into the costume, you you wonder what would happen if you pressed to hard on it as it seemed to be made of a very thin fabric. Surly it was more sturdy than it looked as you managed that The suit fit almost perfectly, aside from having an oversized awkward tail hanging off the back of you while having it almost skin tight. After a sigh as you were about to put on the mask is when you noticed a strange looking dildo sticking in the back of the mouth area that whoever made this suit wanted you to suck on it while wearing it, figuring it was something to use in suit when your thoughts were on something else and slipped it on over your head. it nearly gagged you for breath when it slid in the back of your throat while finishing the costume by zipping it up.<br />
<br />
When you were done, you spotted a mirror next to a stalagmite while Glancing around. you went to take a look at yourself in the mirror as you pondered on how great you looked that you Then noticed something very odd. lion are suppose to be on all fours, yet you weren&#39;t as you dropped down on your hands and knees.<br />
<br />
[Wow. It’s kind of surprising that I am so eager and start to pretend on being an animal.] you think once more as You expected to feel warm in such a furry suit, but you don’t that it felt In fact very... natural. Could the costume really be having some kind of strange side effect on your mind? No, that wasn&#39;t possible, right?<br />
<br />
suddenly, A strange tingling starts up as it makes you wonder if you are somehow allergic to the protect that the clothes are made out of. Then, as soon as it appeared that the tingling was then gone. Could it really be a weird reaction? maybe Perhaps you were just imagining it as you’re bound to have your mind play tricks on you that with you being in an unknown place deep in a never ending forest, Not to mention alone.<br />
<br />
As you stand there that You decide to sit down, suddenly having a headache. a slight pinch makes you pause when Something twitches under your tail as It feels sort of like a twitch is growing that You begin to have second thoughts about trying on this lion costumes, But how was it possible. unless this place was again playing tricks on you when the The seams on the costume were fading as the zipper vanished,you were... uh, oh.<br />
<br />
...<br />
Wait a minute, The costume didn’t feel quite like fabric anymore that It felt in fact more like... real animal fur? your tail felt like you had a new limb attached, well, to be more exact, Real as You try pulling it, but fine that doing so causes a small ache. The tail in the back started to wave around, seemingly on its own that The tail was now apart of you, yet you knew you were the one moving it. You had expected it to feel weird and unrealistic, but it was just like anouther arm (without fingers of course).<br />
<br />
you feel as if your heart rate has just increased that Maybe you’re more afraid than you realized. deep down inside as you somehow concluded, yet knew that you were transforming into a full out lion. as time progresses, your body Still appears to not have any problems with this that It was as if your have always been a lion.<br />
<br />
[What, what in the world?!] you exclaimingly thought while still sucking on the dildo inside the mask, Unknown to you as you begin to brain storm ideas on what to do that the costume gets tighter and tighter over you when you Suddenly got all over. You try to take the costume off, but it feel as if you’re trying to rip out your own skin! The lion suit seems to somehow have bonded with you as it was sticking to you!!<br />
<br />
when Standing up that You immediately started trying to take the suit off while You struggled as you basically look like a lion standing on its hind legs, but to no avail. The zipper you had just used moments ago, seemed to have disappeared! just as quickly you stood up is when soon after, you fall back over that the changing of your spinal cord Instantly snaps and reforms, so you can no longer stand on your feet. Soon you’re on all four paws as you are Now somehow unable to even stand upright and return to your feet!<br />
<br />
you somehow Still don’t notice when the tail proceeded to pops out into place. All the while, you look over yourself as You started to grow whiskers on your cheeks that even though you had your hands in a fist inside the gloves is where they started to change into paws when claws grow out where your fingernails should of been. In a flash, a ripple went through your new fur and then stopped as your ears moved to the top of your head.<br />
<br />
It finally accrues to you, unless you find a way out of this enchanting outfit off of you that you’re going to be stuck as a lion, forever. as The costume was now fully covering and clings to you, seeming more and more like real lion fur that You suddenly feel quite frightened as you lost your senses for a moment that If you were still human is where your eyes would water. Eventually, Your body grows a little bit as the thought almost makes you want to cry. [if I Were only human.]<br />
<br />
-silence-<br />
<br />
soon All of your senses seemed to come alive, with each passing moment. with a sudden spark that your eyes have gained lion vision as you can smell better then before. your hearing seems to increased that you could hear a small insect near by buzzing around, but when you weren&#39;t sucking on the dildo in your mouth as you were breathing in air into you lungs from your nose and mouth is when you realized something was completely off here.<br />
<br />
With a sigh as you glanced around that you Push yourself off the ground with all your might in a giant leap and rocket towards the cavern’s mirror. looking back at yourself that There is no way you would be able to get the costume off now as it is now a part of you. you looked more like a lion then a human, and a pretty good one at that too as most of your troubles faded away into the background.<br />
<br />
[how In the world can this be? What happened to me?] you think as you Try to speak English out loud, though it was latterly impossible which All that came out were cries of roars. You try again once more, yet you still couldn&#39;t as they came out in a same tiring roar when It was then you discovered the real truth that you&#39;re now officially been turned into a full grown lion while giving out one big Rrrooaaarr yo say Nnnoooo.<br />
<br />
-silence-<br />
<br />
...<br />
you weren&#39;t sure how long you were standing there as it may of been maybe about five seemingly long minutes, but there still appears to be no way out of the suit and changing back to your former self on four feet as the transformation was now complete. it would seem that you couldn’t tell the difference between where you begin and where the suit was anymore. Luckily, you run over to the beginning of the animal costume rows That an idea suddenly pops up into your mind!<br />
<br />
[Now then, to figure out a way out of this crazy hell hole.] you thought, just realizing that your humanity was still in there as you had a mind of a human and the body of a lion. Sadly though as you stared at you new reflection, regrettably that you still don’t have a way out After all...<br />
<br />
You sighed again. you wondered on what would happen to you next...<br />
What do you do now?<br />
<br />
(this is where you decide on what you do now. feel free to list your own idea story line up as there&#39;s a list down below. the reason on why i didn&#39;t tell it as male or female because you could also tell it yourselves that you might of pick out and placed on the costume of a different gender. thank you and happy reading.)</p>
