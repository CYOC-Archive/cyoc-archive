<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">With Ricky now a cow in the basement, Peter and Leo&#39;s memories of him grew fuzzy and disappeared altogether. Now Peter only remembered having invited Leo over. The boys got distracted from their snacks by Jenny running through the backyard with her friends, giggling and screaming. They were all carrying dolls, stuffed animals, and tea party equipment.<br />
<br />
&quot;Man, your sister is annoying&quot;, said Leo.<br />
<br />
Peter rolled his eyes. &quot;Tell me about it&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know what?&quot; said Leo. &quot;Watch this&quot;.<br />
<br />
Leo got up and walked over to where the girls had decided to sit, and with a quick grab, pulled a doll out of Kaylee&#39;s hands.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey! Give me back Sasha!&quot; said Kaylee. The freckled girl jumped to her feet, ginger pigtails whirling, and tried to grab the doll back, but Leo kept it out of her reach.<br />
<br />
&quot;Or what?&quot; laughed Leo. &quot;What are ya gonna do to me!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Give it back to her!&quot; said Ashlyn, getting up angrily. The tomboy with short black hair was the tallest of the three girls, but still couldn&#39;t reach the doll.<br />
<br />
&quot;Catch!&quot; said Leo, tossing it to Peter. The girls ran to him, but Peter threw it back to Leo.<br />
<br />
&quot;Peter! Cut it out or I&#39;m telling Dad!&quot; said Jenny.<br />
<br />
&quot;Go ahead&quot;, said Peter,  &quot;and I&#39;ll tell him you&#39;re bothering us&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine! I&#39;m telling!&quot; said Jenny. She ran off to the house, blonde ponytail bouncing, while Peter and Leo continued playing keep-away with the doll.<br />
<br />
What Jenny didn&#39;t know was that, at that moment, her big sister had finished transforming into a cat, and was chasing a mouse - formerly her boyfriend - around the spare bedroom. As that happened, her memories of their existence blinked out as well. The Chronivac scanned for a new target, and found Jenny.<br />
<br />
As the device randomized her stats, Jenny paused, halfway towards grabbing the door handle, and groaned. &quot;Ohhh... I don&#39;t feel so good&quot;, she muttered, holding her stomach. She doubled over, hoping the pain would go, but it only got worse.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jeez... I must have caught something&quot;, she said, fanning herself as she felt warmer. &quot;Maybe medicine will help&quot;. She entered the house and headed for the medicine closet. It was hard to move for some reason, and she pulled at her clothes. When she reached the closet in the bathroom though, she had a surprise. It was a lot closer to her than she remembered. Then she noticed that her clothes were much tighter on her. She had grown.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wh-what&#39;s happening to me?&quot; she said, starting to panic. As she looked down she could see the floor moving slowly away from her as she continued inching upwards, her shirt and pants riding up on her stretching body. But that wasn&#39;t the only thing that was happening. She was also... tanning? Her pale skin was slowly darkening.<br />
<br />
&quot;I need to get those off!&quot; thought Jenny in a panic as she closed the bathroom door behind her.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Michael noticed the commotion going on outside and went to check on them. &quot;What are you doing?&quot; he said. &quot;And where&#39;s Jenny?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just playing!&quot; said Peter with a big smile. &quot;And, uh, Jenny went indoors looking for you&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tell him to give my doll back!&quot; said Kaylee.<br />
<br />
&quot;Peter, give the doll back&quot;, sighed Michael.<br />
<br />
&quot;What doll?&quot; said Peter innocently. He had already passed it to Leo, and Michael had already headed back into the house to look for Jenny.<br />
<br />
Speaking of Jenny, the girl had managed to pull her clothes off before they tore, and stared at herself in the mirror. &quot;Oh my gosh&quot;, she said in a breaking voice. &quot;I-I&#39;m huge&quot;. She was still getting bigger, her scrawny body swelling up as years of working out in the gym paid off. Their skin continued to darken as her blue eyes turned brown. Their hair darkened and shortened, breaking out of its ponytail as it curled. And there was no mistaking the new addition growing rapidly between his legs. &quot;I&#39;m a boy?!&quot; he said in a deepening voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Where did she go off to?&quot; said Michael, checking each room.  He opened the door of the spare bedroom. &quot;Jenny, are you-?&quot; He was greeted with a meow as a sandy yellow cat padded out and rubbed against his leg. She looked very satisfied. &quot;Oh, how did you get in there Kara?&quot; he said with a sigh, picking the cat up and petting her. &quot;Did Jenny put you there?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoa...&quot; was all that Jenny was saying as he flexed his muscles in the mirror. &quot;Not bad&quot;. He now stood at 6&#39;2&#39;&#39;, and his skin had stopped darkening at a rich, dark brown. As he inspected his chiseled physique, memories of being Jenny slowly vanished from his head, replaced by new ones. He could remember being teased as a kid for being overweight, his strict workout routines started in high school, his time in college, making friends with Michael, and a long friendship that ended in becoming Michael&#39;s current housemate. He was still single, but was hopeful about his chances.<br />
<br />
&quot;After all, who wouldn&#39;t want to get to know me better?&quot; he said with a smirk, his gaze going down his perfect abs to check out his crotch and making a few poses. The discarded clothing on the floor quickly shifted into gym shorts, boxers, and a tank top. At the same time, his bedroom altered dramatically as it adjusted to be a single man&#39;s bedroom.<br />
<br />
He was interrupted by a knock at the door. &quot;Jenny? Are-&quot; Michael coughed. &quot;Excuse me, Jonny? Are you in there?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jonny grabbed his clothes. &quot;Yes, be right out&quot;.<br />
<br />
There was an awkward silence. Then Michael said &quot;We really need to get you a girlfriend&quot;.<br />
<br />
The changes completed, the Chronivac returned to scanning for its new target.</p>
