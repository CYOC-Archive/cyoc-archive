<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Hopping in the truck he'd driven to the carnival, Bradley gazed into the rear-view mirror at the horse trailer he'd hitched to the truck and after a moment thought, &quot;Goddamn waste of time,&quot; as he started the truck and put it into gear.<br />
<br />
Home, he parked the truck and unhitched the trailer. When one of the farmhands greeted him, he absently waved back and headed for the house, his mind on other things.<br />
<br />
Upstairs in his room, he kicked off his boots and lay down on his bed. His hands laced together and behind his head, Bradley gazed up at the ceiling, thinking about what the gypsy man had said. After a moment, he muttered, &quot;It is not cruelty,&quot; and sitting up, he gazed out the window.<br />
<br />
From were he sat he could for the most part see a good portion of the ranch that his parents ran and would one day leave him. Through the open window he could hear the nicker and neighing of the some eighty-nine horses he and his parents bred, raised and worked. Thinking about the horse and one in particular pushed what the Roma man had said from his mind.<br />
<br />
Breathing deeply, Bradley thought, &quot;Just have to wait for the farmhands to finish for the day,&quot; and glancing at the clock, he noted they wouldn't be leaving for another hour or so.<br />
<br />
The feeling of wanting to be out there with the horses grew and standing, Bradley gazed about his room and wondered what he should do to take his mind off his hobby. Spying a book, he picked it up and idly flipped through the pages. When that was still not enough to takes his mind off the animals outside, he turned on his radio and lying back down on his bed, he started to once again flip through the book he'd picked up.<br />
<br />
When he heard the last farmhand leave for the day, Bradley nearly jumped up off his bed in excitement. Forcing himself to calm down, he thought, &quot;Wait a bit, just to make sure none of them return,&quot; and sitting down on his bed, he began to absently pick at the comforter covering his sheets.<br />
<br />
After a bit he glanced at the clock and realising that nearly a half hour had passed since the last farmhand had left, Bradley stood and headed downstairs.<br />
<br />
Knowing both of his parents were out of town for a seminar, Bradley smiled as he thought about the couple days he would be alone to engage in his hobby. Heading out of the house, he made a beeline for the barn and letting himself in, he paused as he breathed deeply the smell of hay, grain and horse.<br />
<br />
As he started to pull of his shirt, Bradley walked across the stable, eying the different animals, a sort of carnal lust coming over him as he walked and undressed.<br />
<br />
Dropping his drawers, he spied a fine stallion he had raised since a Foal and had called Buck. Stepping away from his pants and underwear, leaving his shirt lying on the concrete floor, Bradley stubbed a bit as his used his feet to push off his socks. Naked, feeling himself getting exited, he approached the horse and as he eyed the horse's cock, he could feel his own penis growing hard.<br />
<br />
As he reached for Buck's genitals, Bradley absently grabbed a bottle he kept hidden in the stall and pouring some of the contents on his hands, he smeared the goop together and then, reaching forward, he slowly began to massage Buck.<br />
<br />
The horse, as Bradley massaged the large penis, gazed back and after a moment gave out a long nickering neigh. Smiling, Bradley told Buck, &quot;Yeah. You like this,&quot; and as he felt the horse getting more and more hard, he reached down and began to massage his own throbbing organ, thoughts about how it would feel to mount Buck flooding his mind.<br />
<br />
But than things got really weird and just as Bradley felt himself nearly ready to blow, the horse shied away from, forcing him to let go of Buck's penis. Upset, he let go of his own cock and shifting his position, the feeling of excitement slowly leaving him, Bradley hissed out, &quot;Don't do that again.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gently grabbing Buck's cock, Bradley once again began to first go to work on the horse and after a couple strokes, started to go to work on his own hard penis. And once again, Buck shied away, forcing Bradley to let go. Gazing at the horse, a feeling of irate coming over him, Bradley stood there, still holding his own genitals, staring at the horse. After a couple seconds, he snapped out, &quot;Fine,&quot; and looking about, he spied a Filly that he could finish what he'd come to do just as soon as he found a ladder.<br />
<br />
Letting go of his penis, hoping it wouldn't go soft before he had time to finish, Bradley hurried across the barn and quickly found himself a stepladder. Dragging it over to the Filly, Bradley climbed the ladder and when he was in position, he slowly at first began to rub his penis against the horse's genitals, remembering that her name was Autumn as he began to excite her.<br />
<br />
Before him, Autumn flicked her tail and uttered a low neigh, almost in displeasure to what Bradley was doing.<br />
<br />
Whispering, &quot;It will be over soon, honey,&quot; Bradley prepared himself to go the next step. Suddenly he was stopped as something behind him snorted, made a grunting noise and than forced itself atop Bradley, upsetting the ladder as it did so.<br />
<br />
As he realised the it was Buck, the thought of what it would feel like to crushed between to horses having sex rushed through Bradley's mind, followed by what his parents and the farmhands would think when they found his naked, crushed body the next morning. And than all of that was pushed from his thoughts as he felt something brushing against the area between his legs and understanding that it was Buck's penis, he thought, &quot;I'm about to get speared by a horny horse.&quot;<br />
<br />
And than Buck was thrusting away and Bradley wondered if it was possible for a horse to kill somebody by jamming their erect member into the area between a human's legs. But than he thought, &quot;I'll probably more than likely be crushed to death,&quot; as he felt something wet and sticky explode against his skin.<br />
<br />
With another snort followed by another grunt, Buck slid off of Bradley, who for the moment just lay on Autumn's rump, amazed that he hadn't been crushed. After a moment, he slid off and landing on the floor, he gazed about the barn. After a moment, he tittered out a laugh that was near a whinny and standing, he began to wander. When he came to the area that held the hay that was fed to the horses, he sat down and deciding that he was hungry, dug in, stopping only to switch off to sample a mixture of oats followed by a grazing on the sweet grass out in the pasture.</p>
