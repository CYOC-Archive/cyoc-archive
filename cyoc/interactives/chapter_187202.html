<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The more time Tom spends in this body of a child, the more distant his memories from another world become. How does he even know that he is actually Tom? Maybe he is Maxwell who received the memories of someone who died from another world. Nonetheless, it feels weird that he calls himself Tom in his mind while people around him call him Maxwell. Starting from now, Tom will call himself Max.<br />
 <br />
Maxwell&#39;s memories are still spotty. He has slices of lucidity where the mansion he&#39;s living in becomes familiar grounds, then there are times where he gets lost in this maze of hallways and doors. Luckily, he found Alexander leaving a room.<br />
 <br />
&quot;Master Maxwell, what are you doing here?&quot; Alexander asked.<br />
 <br />
&quot;I was going to meet father,&quot; Maxwell replied.<br />
 <br />
&quot;Master could have waited for me. I was going to fetch for you.&quot; Alexander sighed. Maxwell thanked him for the concern then went inside the room where Alexander left. He assumed that it must be his father&#39;s office. But before he did, Alexander pulled him by the scruff of his nightgown.<br />
 <br />
&quot;Master, are you sure you are to be in your father&#39;s presence in that attire?&quot;<br />
 <br />
&quot;What&#39;s wrong with this outfit? He&#39;s just my father.&quot;<br />
 <br />
&quot;He may be your father but your father is still a marquess. It is improper to return thank his grace with less than casual attire. If I would be so prudent, I suggest that we take a trip to your wardrobe and I can be of assistance in making you prim and proper.&quot;<br />
 <br />
Maxwell followed his servant to a room, which is somewhat a few walks away from where there were. The room inside is smaller than his bedroom but still spacious enough in the eyes of a child. There is a pedestal in the middle where Alexander asked his master to stand. As he did, Alexander opened the buttons of his nightgown, revealing his naked form underneath. This would be Maxwell&#39;s first time seeing his nude despite already feeling familiar with it. His skin is pale but turns rosy whenever he breathes. There is a brownish birthmark below his belly button. It&#39;s strange that he&#39;s calling it a birthmark, given how it looks man-made. The mark is a straight line starting from the button and ending just above the crotch. Above the line are five shapes. Starting from the top, it&#39;s a circle, diamond, square, a horizontal line, ending in an upside-down triangle whose tip is pointing to his peanut-sized penis. Maxwell touched the birthmark and felt a slight bevel to it. In his wonder, he forgot that his servant just undressed him just like that. He grabbed his nightgown and closed it shut.<br />
 <br />
&quot;Ma- master. What are you doing?&quot; Alexander asked.<br />
 <br />
&quot;I should be the one asking. What gives?&quot; Maxwell replied with cheeks as pink as cherries. Alexander got what&#39;s going on underneath Maxwell&#39;s skin at that very moment.<br />
 <br />
&quot;Master seems to be at that age. Don&#39;t worry, master. I&#39;ve seen you naked more times than I could count. And you know that I can count as many as nobles could. You don&#39;t have to be embarrassed. And besides, you&#39;re going to be naked if you want to get dressed.&quot;<br />
 <br />
Maxwell scratched his temple, &quot;Well, if you say so.&quot;<br />
 <br />
Maxwell is stripped of his nightgown. The stagnant coldness of the room licked him in the bum, sending him slight shivers that made his teeth chatter. Upon seeing this, Alexander uttered an ancient phrase underneath his breath. He raised his palm against the crystal lights which dimmed for a bit. Then his palm found its way to Maxwell&#39;s back. His hands are warm and comfortable. Maxwell grabbed the hand and raised it to his face.<br />
 <br />
&quot;What did you just do?&quot; Maxwell asked.<br />
 <br />
&quot;I&#39;m surprised that you even forgot that.&quot; Alexander looked bummed. &quot;I may not be a noble blessed with gifts from the pantheon but I know minor magicks. All servants of this household do. I absorbed a bit of mana from the light which I used to make my palms warm. They don&#39;t last long, though.&quot; True to his word, Alexanders calloused palm returned to its original temperature<br />
 <br />
After the display of minor magick, Alexander went back to his work. He picked a casual black blazer with matching dark-colored pants, but not before letting him wear a pair of braies to cover his exposed groin and butt. He has the gist that his master likes casual clothing, so he picked formal attire but still casual at heart. To top it off, he cast a signature magick on the sewn front pocket of the blazer. Embers appeared, etching the head of a wolf atop hills. It&#39;s the insignia of the Vanderbilt household.<br />
 <br />
&quot;There, you are now a man worthy of your father&#39;s audience.&quot; Alexander smiled.<br />
 <br />
Maxwell smiled too. Back in his previous life, his parents were outcasts of their respective families. That leaves little room for an invitation to formal events. This would be his first time wearing such proper clothes. If he wasn&#39;t a child, he&#39;d be a bespoke man that would surely attract the eyes of people. He brushed off the collars of his blazer and made small poses in front of the mirror which earned a chuckle from Alexander.<br />
 <br />
---<br />
 <br />
Deidrick von Vanderbilt towered over Maxwell, physically and in status. Even though he is seated across the room in this ornate lacquer chair, his father&#39;s presence domineered over the young boy. Those eyes have seen more than Maxwell could think of. His greying hair may give the appearance of an aging man, but the body hiding under that tailcoat speaks of a strength that hasn&#39;t aged for a day.<br />
 <br />
Deidrick stood from his chair and looked at the window overseeing an expansive plain bordering a mountain range with countless peaks. &quot;Alexander told me you have lost your memories. Is that right?&quot; he said.<br />
 <br />
&quot;For the most part, yes,&quot; Maxwell replied in a meek tone, his head bowed down staring at his tucked hands.<br />
 <br />
&quot;Do you still know the Vanderbilt code?&quot;<br />
 <br />
&quot;Yes. We strive for peace but we always carry the tools of war. We are the shield to protect the realm and sword that vanquishes all evil.&quot;<br />
 <br />
For a moment, Deidrick stood there in silence. He brushed his beard and contemplated the lack of indecisive tone in his son&#39;s voice. &quot;You have pleased me, my son. You may have made a mockery of yourself in the ceremony but it is not enough to wash away the Vanderbilt in your blood. Say, what gift did the pantheon provide? The priests say the ceremony was a success despite the complications on your part.&quot;<br />
