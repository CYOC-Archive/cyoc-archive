<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Well, on the good side, you bought enough clothes to share with Mike yesterday,&quot; Stacy said with her typical dry wit she fell back upon whenever something happened she could explain.<br />
<br />
Jim paled and shuddered, causing his oversized nightshirt to slip down further, exposing more of his chubby body to his long-time girlfriend.<br />
<br />
&quot;We have to find some way to reverse this,&quot; he said, trying to not sound like he was whining, but the words still came out with a tinge of that tone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, but first we need to get you into some clothes.&quot;<br />
<br />
His tummy gurgled then, rather loudly.<br />
<br />
&quot;And how were you at two with potty training?&quot; she asked.<br />
<br />
Jim could only blush and try and hide his head as he had to admit that he&#39;d worn diapers until he was three.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, back into them you go.&quot; She picked him up under his arms, pulling him free from his shirt and exposing his naked toddler body to the cold air of the room as she turned to go to Mike&#39;s room.<br />
<br />
&quot;No! Mike gets to wear pull ups!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And I hope he stays in them, do you know how much money it would cost me to buy diapers for both of you?&quot;<br />
<br />
To that Jim had no answer, even though he recalled knowing the price of the diapers from having purchased them yesterday. But the memory was slipping away from him--the more he tried to grasp it, the quicker is slipped away, and suddenly he realized that might not be the only memory leaving him, he worried. No, he still remembered dating Stacy, meeting her parents, having sex with her, etc. It was just his memories from yesterday which were a little hazy that&#39;s all. Perhaps it was just a side effect of getting younger so suddenly--yeah, that&#39;s probably what it was.<br />
<br />
While Jim was lost in his thoughts, Stacy pushed Mike&#39;s room door open, surprising Mike and causing him to jump with a yelp as she lugged the toddler Jim over to the makeshift changing table she&#39;d managed to arrange out of an old desk she&#39;d kept from her college days.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry Mike, but I want to get Jim here in diapers before he messes himself.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Jim&#39;s younger too?!&quot; said Mike.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yep, he&#39;s just a little rugrat like you now. In fact... looking at you two, you could pass for brothers... at this age.&quot;<br />
<br />
Stacy laid Jim down expertly, her time having babysat when younger coming in handy now as she lifted his legs rather effortlessly, wiped him clean, dried him, powdered him, and then brought out the diaper.<br />
<br />
Jim wanted to protest, but he saw Stacy&#39;s look and knew better to argue, especially with Mike having gotten up from bed and standing on his tiptoes to watch as Stacy worked with him. Not knowing what else to do, and needing something to keep him from saying something stupid, Jim took his pointer and middle fingers on his left hand and stuck them in his mouth like he used to at this age to suck--suddenly remembering how good this used to make him feel at age two. And before he knew it, he was diapered and all done.<br />
<br />
&quot;And how are you holding up, Mike? No accidents at night?&quot;<br />
<br />
Mike beamed, as though extremely proud of himself like any other toddler might be.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nope! I went the whole night!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, aren&#39;t you a good boy, Mikey. It seems Jimmy needs to take after his big brother more often.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t baby talk me!&quot; pouted Jim.<br />
<br />
&quot;But Jimmy, if you&#39;re two now, you only just turned two considering your birthday was a week ago, whereas little Mikey here, why he&#39;s about nine months older than you, so if you want to get down to--&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re not little boys, Stacy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You could have fooled me this morning.&quot;<br />
<br />
She was enjoying this... too much, far too much, Jim realized as a deep feeling caused him to feel queasy--or that might have just been his tummy rumbling again. He put his fingers back into his mouth and began to suck harder, it was all he could do to keep from crying out with how scared he was feeling. What if he stayed young? What if he had to grow up all over again.<br />
<br />
&quot;If you&#39;re worried that you&#39;re gonna be the youngest, well, don&#39;t worry. In a few months you&#39;ll be a daddy, or I guess an older brother yourself, now I guess.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mommy&#39;s pregnant?&quot; asked Mike, who then blushed and said, &quot;Stacy, I mean...&quot;<br />
<br />
Stacy smirked, and then rubbed her hand over Mike&#39;s head as she gently tossed his hair.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yep, a child of my own... who&#39;d know I&#39;d get to adopt twice over before I got to be a Mommy myself?&quot; she said as she placed her hand rather proudly on her tummy. It might have been Jim&#39;s imagination, but he could&#39;ve sworn he now saw Stacy&#39;s belly had a tiny bump he hadn&#39;t noticed before, and her breasts seemed a little heavier... and inviting. His stomach gurgled again, and this time he realized it wasn&#39;t gurgling because he had to go, it gurgled because he was hungry.<br />
<br />
Unable to resist the almost primeval urges driving him now, Jim ripped his fingers from his mouth and reached up for Stacy calling, &quot;Milk.&quot;</p>
