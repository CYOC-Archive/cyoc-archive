<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Do you need help searching for those hidden memories?&quot; Kalren asked calmly as he walks to the chair in front of the table stares right at you. Of course, you are scared of what this past may bring. But there could be something else that might help by hurdling through this. You then sit down on the chair opposite of him and with determination in your eyes you look at him. &quot;Yes.&quot; Kalren sighs, you can feel strange feelings flowing towards him, you don&#39;t know what it is, but you feel like he is gaining energy or something without doing anything. He then looks to Daze, &quot;Daze, can you get me an empty scroll and place it between us on the table?&quot; Daze nods and goes to his shelf of scrolls and grabs one off the second lowest to his shelf and walks back to the table. He then unravels the scroll and without hesitation, Daze then draws out some runes with a white chalk as they begin to glow. Kalen slowly closed his eyes and Daze finishes drawing the runes around the scroll.<br />
<br />
&quot;You better look straight into his eyes for this to work.&quot; You then look at Daze and then at Kalren as he opens his eyes as they glow yellowish white. You then get the feeling of your soul being swallowed in to his eyes as the world warps and contorts around you. It feels like you&#39;ve been into this distorting realm for days, but it only has been less than a minute until you finally return to the world, but outside, and not at Daze&#39;s house. You look up at the sky, it shows no stars twinkling in the pitch black sky, smoke filling your nose, and the sound of fire crackling behind you. You turn around to see a city on fire. People screaming in pain and in agony. Flying creatures in the black sky carrying victims as they drop them to the firey depths of hell that was once a city beneath them. You wanted to run away, get away from here, somewhere safe, but something in your head, you need to find out what is this memory. To your right, you see a small figure, that looks like your younger self, looking in horror, strangely looking through the vision of your younger self, as two bat winged creatures grab three people in the burning rubble. One of them tries to fight back, only to get its upper body cleanly bitten off as they climb higher and higher until they soon let go, plummeting to their doom. You then cry out in horror, shouting out their names, tears flying off the side of your eyes. Wishing for someone or something to save them, only to get swallowed by the flames beneath them. Just then, the monsters that dropped them screech as they look at you now. You then look up to see them staring at you. <br />
<br />
Not knowing what to do, your body isn&#39;t in control, your young body then turns around running in panic into the forest as the monsters descend almost close to the ground and following you above the trees. Lost and no where to go, you keep going straight, until you reached a cliff. Another piercing screech can be heard behind you, as they appear over the trees and with no hesitation, claws exposed, sharp teeth bared, dive down towards you. Your older self realizes this can&#39;t be the end. This isn&#39;t how you died. Indeed, this isn&#39;t where you died as strong bolts of magic intercepted two of the three monsters as they fell to the edge missing you as they howl to their deaths, the other was met by a black robed man wielding a huge and heavy sword, slashes through the monster horizontally as it burns and disintegrates in mid-air. You then look in awe, as the mysterious man lands gracefully to the ground, putting his huge blade away on his back and looks to you, his face covered by the hood and walks to you. No where to run, no where to hide, the figure then gets close, not wondering what he might do next.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s okay. You&#39;re safe.&quot; the mysterious man said as he ruffles your hair. Underneath his hood, there was a smile, nothing malicious, nothing evil, but assuring that he will be okay. &quot;We will meet again in the future.&quot; Suddenly, as the man places a tip of his finger to your forehead, the world fades to black and then you regain your conscious and back in Daze&#39;s home, still sitting on the chair and see a tired Kalren sitting there taking care of Daze, but Kalren shrugs it off. &quot;I am fine Daze,&quot; he says as he realizes the scroll on the table. You then look at it too. What was once an empty scroll, was filled with pictures and writings details of what his old memory might be. &quot;Is... Is that really my memory?&quot; Kalren reached for the scroll and skims it and confirms it is your memories of the past. &quot;Yes. It is. But only a fragment.&quot; Daze then goes to look at the scroll and reads the part where you were looking at the burning city.<br />
<br />
&quot;I remember going here after that incident. There was no sign of people that survived it, investigations said it was caused by wild fire. But nothing said anything about these monsters attacking.&quot; Daze remembers. Kalren nods, &quot;Indeed, we don&#39;t know why they attacked this city, or who this mysterious man is.&quot; You&#39;re curious if the city exists anymore and ask, &quot;Well, if this is supposed to be my home, then... Do you think it is still there? Or at least something there?&quot; Both Kalren and Daze look at you as Daze replies, &quot;Yes, I do believe it is still there. We are planning on rebuilding the city after that once we get a full investigation of what happened and what is the cause of it.&quot;<br />
&quot;Can we go now or tomorrow? I need to see it with my own eyes.&quot; you ask him. Both Kalren and Daze look at each other and nods. &quot;We will leave tomorrow morning. Rest up.&quot; Daze then walks to the entrance of the door and says, &quot;I will let the King know of our departure, I will be back soon.&quot; he then spreads his wings and takes flight in the night sky and towards to the castle. Kalren sighs, &quot;He forgot to show you where you are going to sleep.&quot; you look at him as he walks up to you, &quot;Come, you will be staying in the guests room next across his.&quot; he leads you to your room of where you are staying.<br />
<br />
That night, you manage to sleep fine until you revisited your memory in your dream and woke up abruptly. You need to find out who you truly are and confirm this truth is really where you live. The next day....</p>
