<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Molly and I slowly made our way back to Bandhavgarh. I couldn't believe that letting Hireman know what the truth was would be a problem for Tabby, but then I wasn't a politician. My reasoning came from the fact that Hireman lied to start the campaign in the first debate, and to my knowledge, Patten had to send a message into the local paper that the lines Hireman had used was a lie and misleading. It was in fact the reason why he ended up asking me about why I did what he thought was wrong. I had figured that I was stopping Hireman from getting away creating unnecessary tension by using another misinformed lie.<br />
<br />
So the revelation that the present campaign had attracted &quot;fact checkers&quot; was a complete surprise to me. And the fact that my speaking the truth during the &quot;debate&quot; would allow Hireman to discredit whatever these &quot;fact checkers&quot; would find was beyond me. They were probably local reporters that because of the way the campaign started had decided to double check all possible sources, but it was still beyond me how anyone could do something like that and think he could get away with it.<br />
<br />
&quot;I probably put my foot in it, didn't I?&quot; I asked after a few moments.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe,&quot; Molly sighed, &quot;though to be honest, I was right with you. If you hadn't have spoke up, I might have.&quot;<br />
<br />
I only sighed and continued walking.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, but what happens when the reporters double check through our reports, both here, with the County Sheriffs, and FBI and find out that I was right,&quot; I continued, &quot;and Hireman then denounces the reports as corrupt or falsified to make me look good?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He'd still be lying,&quot; Molly replied, &quot;and even that wasn't an issue, he's still over generalizing. That because Washerman turned himself into an Animal Person and was bad... that we are also bad by association.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And made it seem like we'd volunteered to take the Serum,&quot; I gave a low growl, &quot;That didn't happen and he should know it! You were a tiger-person when we moved here. The Serum wasn't legal then.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know,&quot; Molly answered simply and nuzzled my shoulder, &quot;He's a liar and an ass. And he ticks both of us off... I think we're past the point of trying to &quot;muzzle&quot; him by presenting him with the truth. He'll keep right on being what he is, regardless of what we tell him.&quot;<br />
<br />
I gave a heavy sigh.<br />
<br />
&quot;It almost makes me want to load a dose of the Serum into a dart gun and shoot him with it,&quot; I grumbled, &quot;maybe living a life with fur would teach him that we aren't mindless animals... and see how he likes people hating him for being furry.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That would be wrong, George,&quot; Molly said in a firm tone.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know,&quot; I sighed, &quot;I know...&quot;<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
The rest of the night went well... or at least as well as could be expected. The York-Rush family had finished their dinner by the time we returned home, and Herman and Ulysses were watching television. Or at least trying to. I could hear the channels flip every couple of seconds, and after awhile, they circled back to the channel they'd started with.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't you guys have cable?&quot; Herman asked when he noticed Molly and I heading toward the kitchen to get what would be our dinner.<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; Molly answered as she stopped, &quot;sorry.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nuts,&quot; was Herman's only reply.<br />
<br />
The TV was turned off when we returned to the dinner table. As we sat down to eat, I heard a few soft footsteps coming down the stairs and toward us.<br />
<br />
&quot;How did the debate go?&quot; came Laura's voice.<br />
<br />
Molly and I looked up to see her approaching. She ultimately pulled out a chair next to Molly's and sat down. She was dressed in pair of pajamas that looked like they were made of cotton with a plaid design on the shirt and the pajama bottoms matched.<br />
<br />
&quot;In terms of Tabby Choir's answers, I think it went well,&quot; Molly answered, &quot;Hireman is still a liar... but there isn't much that can be done about him.&quot;<br />
<br />
Laura only shook her head, &quot;My father's told me a few things about what has been going on in relation to the election here in town. But I've been away long enough that I'm not too knowledgeable on these things...&quot;<br />
<br />
Molly and I quietly continued eating.<br />
<br />
&quot;The whole race is really about you two?&quot; Laura then asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Molly,&quot; I corrected, &quot;The Superintendent, one Wayne Hireman, has denied Molly's &quot;humanity&quot; as it were and has tried to fire her at every possible opportunity. He has a whole bunch of stupid regulations that the school has had to follow and technically still does because he doesn't want Molly employed there. Our friend, Tabitha Choir is running to correct that... and the issues in the race though, only involve Molly as I do not report to the school board.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see,&quot; Laura sighed, &quot;seems like every election seems to have its heroes and villains.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Some real, some imagined,&quot; I nodded.<br />
<br />
There was a brief silence for a few moments before Laura spoke again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Did Molly tell you, Mr. Wayne?&quot; Laura then asked, her tone going more formal toward the end.<br />
<br />
&quot;On what you plan to do...?&quot; I asked and waited for Laura to let a tear go down her cheek and nod, &quot;Yes, yes, Molly told me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's for the best,&quot; Laura said weakly, &quot;I don't want him to suffer, and the doctors haven't seen anything that would indicate that he would recover... I...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We understand,&quot; I told her, &quot;and if it isn't too much trouble, Molly and I would like to be able to say goodbye to a man who gave us our home.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You would come along?&quot; Laura asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your father gave us Bandhavgarh,&quot; Molly told us, &quot;and gave us the land his ranch sits on in his will... which I still don't fully understand... but... he's been so generous to George and I. We should say goodbye to him.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm not sure we have room...&quot; Laura began.<br />
<br />
&quot;I own a small truck,&quot; I answered, &quot;A Ford Ranger. The keys are around here somewhere. You or Simon could drive us down. We'd be in the backseat...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Across the backseat, actually,&quot; Molly corrected.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh... and your boss is okay with this, George?&quot; Laura wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;I've already taken the time off,&quot; I answered, &quot;I'm good for tomorrow and the fall hunting season when it arrives.&quot;<br />
<br />
Laura nodded, &quot;see you both in the morning then... though not quite as early as you two get up to go to work.&quot;<br />
<br />
Molly and I nodded in response.<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
The next morning began quietly. With our taking personal days off, Molly and I were able to sleep in, but not too terribly much. We dressed and went downstairs to find Simon and Laura finishing up breakfast. It was ham and eggs. They had apparently taken Molly's and my appetites into consideration when we began as the servings were rather large. Not about to complain about having our workload reduced, we thanked them for their efforts and enjoyed a quiet dinner. <br />
<br />
Though all did not entirely seem well. Laura looked extremely depressed, and Herman wasn't too far behind. Ulysses looked a bit down too, but he also looked a bit puzzled. Like he didn't fully understand what was going to happen. Laura and Herman did understand, and we figured that was the cause of their depression. They knew that Michael York wasn't going to make it... and despite any outward voicing of acceptance, they didn't want Michael York to die. Simon looked down too, but he seemed more concerned for his wife for anything else.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can drive you two in your truck,&quot; Simon spoke to us after a moment, &quot;I trust you're ready?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Outside of things like brushing teeth and so forth, we are ready to go,&quot; I nodded.<br />
<br />
Simon nodded, &quot;Very good... a shame this has to be happening.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Molly nodded beside me, &quot;yes it is.&quot;<br />
<br />
After breakfast and once everyone was ready, everyone loaded into the appropriate vehicles. Herman climbed into the front seat of the Rush family vehicle while Ulysses climbed into the back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Laura... you're sure you'll be alright?&quot; Simon asked his wife while Molly went to get the keys to my truck.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll be fine,&quot; Laura answered as she climbed behind the wheel of her family's vehicle, &quot;I'll see you all there.&quot;<br />
<br />
Simon waved her off as Molly returned with the keys. Soon after we were on the road following Laura York-Rush down the main roads to Kalispell. The drive was silent as Molly watched from the back seat. Simon didn't say anything, and part of me was concerned that he was to focused on Laura's vehicle in front of us, but we ended up having no difficulties. We arrived at Kalispell's hospital shortly after the visiting hours opened.<br />
<br />
The hospital hadn't changed much from when I had gone with the ambulance when Officer Barnes had been shot by Beauregard. Molly and I followed the family through the front doors and through the lobby. Laura began rapidly leading our small procession through the hallways following the signs that lead to the Kalispell Hospital's small &quot;Intensive Care Unit&quot;. We were met by a doctor as we came one of the bedroom doors.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mrs. Rush and family,&quot; the doctor began and then continued when he saw Molly and I, &quot;and guests.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, George and Molly Wayne, friends of my father's,&quot; Laura answered, &quot;they've come with us today.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How is he?&quot; Herman asked before the doctor could reply to Laura's comment... if he had one, &quot;how is Grandpa?&quot;<br />
<br />
Any concerns the doctor had with Molly and I being there disappeared with that question.<br />
<br />
&quot;There has been no progress,&quot; the doctor said weakly, &quot;the machines are keeping him alive, still... but even there, he continues to grow weak.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He's always appeared so strong...&quot; Molly spoke.<br />
<br />
&quot;Appearances can be deceiving, ma'am,&quot; the doctor answered professionally, &quot;the blow he received delivered a massive amount of blunt force trauma... and at his age... he simply doesn't seem to be able to recover.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And your suggestion remains unchanged?&quot; Simon asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; the doctor admitted, &quot;the chances of him recovering are too small to really count. We can keep him alive... but I'm afraid that it wouldn't be much of a life. I'm sorry.&quot;<br />
<br />
There was a silence for a few moments. After a little while, I heard Laura sniffle and then reply.<br />
<br />
&quot;We've checked through all the necessary legal documents,&quot; Laura said slowly, &quot;Simon and I have been given the authority in this matter... and... and...&quot;<br />
<br />
Laura then broke down and began crying into Simon's shoulder.<br />
<br />
&quot;We do not want him to suffer needlessly,&quot; Simon answered, &quot;if you don't have much chance of saving him... it would be best to let him go.&quot;<br />
<br />
The doctor nodded, &quot;I'll give you all a few moments before the nurse comes in to turn off the equipment.&quot;<br />
<br />
The doctor stepped aside, though he eyed Molly and I as we walked past him. The room we entered was small and cramped. Especially with Laura and Simon's family of four, Molly, myself, and all the equipment being used to keep Michael York alive. He lay there peacefully in a bed, and if it weren't for the various machines hooked up to him, one would assume he was simply sleeping.<br />
<br />
&quot;You two can go first,&quot; Simon offered to us, while steadying Laura who continued to cry into his shoulder.<br />
<br />
Molly and I slowly approached the bedside. As we approached I heard Molly &quot;chuff&quot; toward him. It was a natural greeting among tigers, and Molly was giving that greeting to him. After a moment, I figured to give the same greeting. It seemed like the proper start to things. After another moment, Molly began to speak to him, even though Michael York couldn't answer.<br />
<br />
&quot;You gave George and I so much,&quot; Molly spoke, &quot;You helped when you didn't need to. You told us it was because we stood up to Beauregard, but something tells me there was more to it then that.&quot;<br />
<br />
I found myself gripping Molly's paw with my own.<br />
<br />
&quot;You will be missed,&quot; I managed to add, not sure of what else to say, &quot;You have been a true friend to Molly and I with all you've given us.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We will miss you,&quot; Molly finished and slowly and carefully nuzzled him with her muzzle.<br />
<br />
As Molly and I moved to a place that was more out of the way, Herman and Ulysses came forward.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm not going to be a rancher,&quot; Herman spoke first, &quot;Just to let you know... I know you wanted me to be... but that just isn't my idea... though, you enabled me to have the dreams that I've had. If it weren't for you... I wouldn't have ever seen the beauty of nature as it is. I wouldn't appreciate all that is around us. I want to be a Park Ranger... work in Yellowstone... and make sure that other people can see this beauty which you allowed me to see on your ranch. And because of that... I will miss you Grandpa. I love you very much. Thank you for all you've taught and shown me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Herman turned and moved away. I could see his tears, but he managed to stay upright.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mommy says that you are dying,&quot; Ulysses began after Herman stepped away, &quot;I don't want that. I don't want you to die and go away. I want you to get better. Lift everyone up and tell us you'll be okay. I love you grandpa.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ulysses then moved to hug at one of Michael York's hands. He got no response, but he seemed to cling to the limb. Simon and Laura were the last to come forward. Laura quietly urged Ulysses to go stand by her brother.<br />
<br />
&quot;I want to thank you for being Laura's father,&quot; Simon spoke, &quot;Your daughter is smart... beautiful... strong... brave... everything she's told me you are. And I feel blessed to have had your blessing to marry her... I wish it didn't have to be this way.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I love you, dad,&quot; Laura cried and dropped down to her knees, &quot;you were always there for me. You looked after me and raised me... much to Mom's frustration. She never wanted me to interested in ranching... of course you know that already. This isn't fair. You didn't deserve this, and we will all be lesser without you.&quot;<br />
<br />
At that time, a lone nurse entered the room and moved around Ulysses and Herman and began to properly position things to turn off the machines that had been keeping Michael York alive.<br />
<br />
&quot;But I can't let you suffer,&quot; Laura answered, &quot;you wouldn't want to be laying in a coma for who knows how long... and... and I know you'l be in a good place... Mom will be there. I love you, Dad.&quot;<br />
<br />
Laura then slowly stood up and leaned against Simon for support.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm really sorry you're all having to go through all of this,&quot; the nurse spoke when Laura stood up.<br />
<br />
&quot;It'll be alright,&quot; Laura managed, &quot;we'll heal in time... you may go ahead.&quot;<br />
<br />
Laura then buried her head in Simon's shoulder again as the nurse began turning off and unplugging the equipment. As this was done, the devices monitoring Michael York's vitals grew steadily weaker and weaker. After about five minutes, they ceased and a low monotone &quot;beep&quot; droned through the room, indicating that Michael York had passed on.</p>
