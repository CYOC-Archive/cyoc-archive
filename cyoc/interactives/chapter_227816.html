<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“… Go with Kenzia’s plan this time around.” Astania finished.<br />
<br />
“This change in the world didn’t just start from nothing, it was given form and guided by something. Our pantheon, I suppose is what we should call them. Before I came here, I spent some time in meditation and during my communion, some of our gods revealed themselves to me. They gave me some instructions about what should be done with the world once we’ve gone world wide, but for now, the gods hold great sway in the dreaming world where they can’t reach into the mortal one. I believe Kenzia’s plan plays to our strengths the best.”<br />
<br />
Kenzia nodded her head, looking to the other queens to gauge their reactions. <br />
<br />
Maraya sighed wistfully, “awww, I wanted to see the looks on the humans as we showed them the future in bombastic fashion! But if it’s more elves in the end, this is as good a plan as any.”<br />
<br />
Alisariah nodded, “I like it. It allows for much more intimate transformations. I prefer a personal touch when it comes to initiating my girls…” she smiled and curled into Terrania’s embrace.<br />
<br />
——-<br />
<br />
Outside, the first responders and the media were preparing to go into the newly sprouted woodlands, though they couldn’t quite shake why it seemed… wrong for them to do so. Beyond the inherent wrongness of an entire apartment vanishing into mist, the forest seemed to exude a force that was not quite malicious, but definitely forbidding. It was clear even to these humans with their numb receptors to the energies of magic, that this forest was determined to ward off all trespassers.<br />
<br />
From their perspective, it made perfect sense with that knowledge that they packed away into their vehicles and drove away. The respective groups began radioing and calling back to their respective bosses, informing them that it was a false report. The building was still there, the people were fine and comfortable at home. It was clearly all just someone trying to waste peoples’ time. In truth, it was Alisariah and Astania’s illusions muddling their memories and restoring the glamour of their glade to depict what the humans expected to see. More importantly, everyone who saw the forest for what it was that night were touched by the magic of the elven gods. They would be in for an important visit in their dreams that night.<br />
<br />
——-<br />
<br />
Sam the paramedic trudged home from another long night, not too different from any of the other long nights she’d had for the past week since she got her new jobs. She was already getting quickly burned out of it. Still, she perked up when she inhaled the scent of a pot of Mac and cheese sitting on her kitchen counter. She smiled as she picked up the note left next to her plate. <br />
<br />
“I had to go to bed, I’ve got to start early tomorrow, but I made you dinner. Love you so much! I can’t wait until we have some time on Sunday. -XOXO”<br />
<br />
She smiled and at the same time sighed sadly as she read it, pushing a strand of her short, light blond hair from in front of her face. Priya was the best girlfriend Sam could ask for, too good it sometimes felt like. She had to choke back some tears as she sulked in guilt that she couldn’t put more time into their relationship. <br />
<br />
It was nearly one in the morning when she’d finally gotten into pajamas and brushed her teeth. As she spat out her toothpaste and looked up at her own reflection, she gave pause a moment. She saw a strand of white hair in the front of her bob haircut. “Fuck, really? I know it’s been a long week, but I’m not getting *that* old, am I?” She shook her head, it was gone. Must’ve been work having her high strung.<br />
<br />
She sighed contentedly as she snuggled up into bed next to Priya, who was already fast asleep. Her dark hair was splayed out in all different directions, the kind of glorious, beautiful mess she adored her for. She drifted off peacefully into sleep soon after.<br />
<br />
———-<br />
<br />
“Hey honey, wake up!” Sam awoke with a start to the sound of Priya’s insistent voice. She stirred slowly, realizing gradually she was sitting on dewy grass that had soaked her pajamas, Priya meanwhile was wearing only a long tank top over her caramel skin. They both came to in a glade deep in a dream like forest, a bright full moon cast a bluish white hue that illuminated more than natural moonlight should. If it wasn’t clear enough to them this was a dream, a blue and green aurora danced over the treetops and flickering fairy lights darted in and out of the brush surrounding the glade.<br />
<br />
“Woah… one hell of a dream.” Sam muttered as she came out of her sleepy haze. “For sure…” replied Priya, “but who’s dream is it? Because I’m pretty sure I’m dreaming this too?” Sam blearily tried to make sense of it, hugging her more tightly as she tried to make sense of it all.<br />
<br />
“No need to fret about that, my friends. Dreams needn’t be bound by the logic of the waking world, so why not just go where your fancies take you?”<br />
<br />
Samantha and Priya shot glances at each other as they both heard the voice of their mutual friend Mackenzie, somewhere sourceless in their dreamscape. Then she emerged from around a bolder that wouldn’t have been large enough for her to hide behind. Kenzia entered the glade in her Drow form, wearing only a harp and sat down on the stone. She struck up a stirring, romantic sounding ballad and glanced at them coyly. “Don’t mind me, it’s your dream, I’m just in it. Do what you want to do.”<br />
<br />
Sam glanced over to Priya, her cheeks flushed with the awareness of their mutual friend, albeit she was now something far more than human. “Well, I have been missing you Priya. I felt like I’ve been a stranger to you ever since I started the new job, I wish we had more time together.”<br />
<br />
Suddenly, she gasped as Priya jumped on her and kissed her. “I missed you too, but I know how important it is for you. You’re literally saving lives, that’s why I fell for you, because you care so much.”<br />
<br />
Sam squeezed her tightly, “Then… let’s enjoy this time while we have it.” She felt a shiver on her back as Priya lifted her t-shirt up and over her head. <br />
<br />
“I thought you’d never ask.” Priya smirked as she pounced on Sam’s lap. Sam couldn’t help but giggle and watched in amazement. Priya had never been this forward and dominant before, and she was loving it. By then, she’d already gotten out of her tank top and dragged her body across Sam’s teasing down her flannel pants to her knees before greedily and eagerly feasting in her lover’s womanhood. Sam arched her back, pushing Priya’s tongue deeper into her folds. She gripped Priya by the hips and dragged her in over top of her as she began to match her movement for movement. As Sam’s fingers began to flick and rub the hood of Priya’s clit simultaneously, Priya moaned, humming inside of Sam’s folds and making her squeeze onto her rear tighter. Her finger nails dug into Priya’s flesh, which was becoming a dark gray, nearly black. Priya too saw her lover’s pale skin turning to a whitish gray from the thigh down and waist up.<br />
<br />
Kenzia closed out her ballad as the two newly transformed Drow climaxed, drinking down one another’s juices and admiring their new forms. <br />
<br />
“Mhmm. Best dream I’ve had in a long time…” Samarath cooed in elvish as she languidly made out with her reborn lover Priyana in the grass. <br />
<br />
“Oh, you’ll be in for quite a surprise when you wake up, my friends. Your new lives as te priestesses and healers of my kingdom await. For now though, there’s many hours until dawn, time for more dance and love…” Kenzia beamed as she lifted the two Drow onto their feet and into each other’s arms.</p>
