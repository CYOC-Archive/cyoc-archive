<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">      With know where to safely go, you decide that the best course of action was to go further away from the demons and Enven&#39;s temple. As much as you would like to go and find supplies and even give Enven a proper burial you couldn&#39;t. It was too dangerous. So instead you decided to move towards the more mountainous area. Where you could easily hide from demons and hunters alike. <br />
<br />
      The trek was hard, as you moved closer to the mountains, the hill soon became more rugged and wild. Thorns scraped at the remanents of your clothes and you became fearful that you would fall victim to your own scent once again. So you took things more slowly avoiding clusters of plants and taking the time of going around them. Along the way you even practiced with your magic some more.<br />
<br />
      You managed to turn a small weed into a beautiful rose and make a oak tree sprout flowers, though that did drain your stamina much more. Demons weren&#39;t made for using nature magic. <br />
<br />
    Soon night started to fall and you started to fear the chances of running into another demon, but reminded yourself that you owed  Enven to survive for Atleast a little longer. <br />
<br />
     The temperature dropped quickly as the sun set, to the point where even under your thick fur you still felt cold. You noticed that as you moved closer to the mountains you could see snow begin to lightly fall.<br />
<br />
     You also realized that the cold would also make you be unable to use much nature magic here. Perhaps you could go back? No, you were already getting tired, your paws were starting to ache and you were getting hungry. You need shelter.<br />
<br />
           But where? There was no place here to reside in. No caves, and definitely no village willing to give a demon a room to sleep in. <br />
<br />
   Then you felt it. Something was in the air. The hair on your neck straightened as you made your way through the forest. Something was calling you and you weren&#39;t quite sure what.<br />
<br />
<br />
  You find yourself going into a small clearing where you saw something. A small temple. Not as fancy as Enven&#39;s but it was homely. The size of a house it&#39;s stone brick structure was old and abandoned with vines covering nearly every available surface. Two rusty old lanterns hanged lazily from the door. Wanting shelter you go in. Your advanced senses both physical and magical let you know there was nothing in here save for a couple of rodents and spiders. The wooden door was old and rotten but still useable as you gently pushed it open. It made a loud creak as you entered the first room.<br />
<br />
    After exploring the temple, your eyes letting you see through the darkness you found it consisted only of about five rooms and a small basement that seemed to be used for storage. There was a kitchen, with a stone table and a furnace along with a pile of coal and a supply of rotten food. The first room you entered through was a room of worship it seemed. A broken old altar inscribed with unintelligible carvings along with a small broken statue of a copper dragon stood, a memory of what it once was. There were two desperate bedrooms, one bigger than the other though they were both in a bad state. The wooden beds had nearly rotted away leaving nothing but memories.<br />
<br />
   The final room was unused. No remnants of anything. Not furniture, nothing. <br />
<br />
<br />
    Overall the temple was quite small and old. You were surprised that it hadn&#39;t caved in by now. Despite its flaws it was nearly the perfect home. If you were to simply clean up a bit it would become a simple home, you could probably even use your magic and create some wooden furniture.<br />
<br />
       But first things first you needed to sleep. You hear back to the first room and channeling your powers you manipulate the nearby vines to shift and mend with each other at a certain spot on the floor. You watched as the vines formed a vague rectangle on the floor, layers and layers of plant stacked on each other creating a comfortable surface. The vines stopped moving as you created a makeshift bed spot out of plants. <br />
<br />
   You were still hungry but you figured that could wait for tomorrow.<br />
 <br />
     Still in your nightwear, you fall asleep on the bed, the soft vines coaxing you into rest. You then fall into a dreamless sleep, finally having a calm peace of mind.<br />
<br />
     As you slept, others were busy. Your sleeping body unconsciously shifted as a figure under your clothes shifted and moved. Then coming out of the left pants of your sleepwear was a snake. Your snake to be specific. It&#39;s black scales exit your sheath, it&#39;s mouth drooling precum and tongue tasting the air. Whenever it closes it&#39;s eyes it nearly looks like a regular penis. It shifted and sways in the air, precum dripping into the floor. It&#39;s red eyes see in the darkness, scanning the ground and the area around it. Stopping to look at your sleeping form. It was tempted to pleasure itself with your mouth but right now it had other concerns. It was hungry. It&#39;s master was sleeping and hungry and it needed to fix that.<br />
<br />
       Five feet away from you and your snake penis a rodent scampered around the floor sniffing and looking for food. The snake watched the rat with keen red eyes, unmoving as it saw its prey. <br />
<br />
       The snake then started using its special ability. It started to generate pheromones, it swayed seductively in the air as the pheromones caught the attention of the rat. It wasn&#39;t in it&#39;s mating season yet, but it couldn&#39;t resist the snake. The rat inched towards the black snake, sniffing tentatively at the air. As soon as it came closer the snake moved towards it gently. It curled around the rat, not tightly but hard enough so then it wouldn&#39;t escape. The rat tried to struggle but the snake hushed it, and pushed its head gently into the rodent&#39;s mouth. The rodent instinctively started sucking like a baby would on a teat. Tasting and becoming addicted to the Previn the snake made. It licked and licked wanting more and more, the snake shivered in pleasure. This continued for several minutes, the rat never stopping wanting to savor the creamy liquid the snake fed it.<br />
<br />
      Then after getting enough pleasure the snake exited from the rat&#39;s mouth and looked at it. The rat started struggling again, not because it wanted to escape but because it wanted to taste more of the snake and its heavenly juice.<br />
<br />
    The snake smiled tasting the air again. Then giving the rat one last wink with its right eye, the snake lunged at the captured rat and swallowed it whole. The rat started moving through the snake&#39;s penis body, eventually being sucked into the groin where it was soon sent into the main stomach for digestion. Suddenly the hungry both you and the snake were feeling vanished as the rodent was digested alive. <br />
<br />
   The snake concentrated and felt a change in its system as it intregrated a small part of the rats biomass into itself. Two  sharp fangs grew out of the snakes mouth and then immediately retracted. The snake smiled once more, now it could properly protect its master. All it needed was to absorb a poisonous animal and it would be complete.<br />
<br />
    The snake moved up to your wolf face and gave you a small kiss on the cheek, spreading precum over your face before retracting back into its sheath, the penis going limp and soft as it fell asleep.</p>
