<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"> I was cleaning up my son’s room Kyle because god knows he would never do it, his room had mostly cloths and toy’s scattered around his room and the stench was unique say at least,  My son was at football practice while I was cleaning his room and while I was picking up his dirty cloths an odd metal necklace fell out a pocket from the cloths in my hands what I have never seen before, once I  put the cloths in the empty laundry basket, I brought the necklace up to my eyes so I could study it more carefully because I haven&#39;t giving Kyle this and I am pretty sure he could not afford such a thing from being a 11-year-old in 6th grade, it looked silver with an odd pattern going along the side of it, I will confront Kyle when I go and pick him up after his training and put the necklace in my pocket. <br />
<br />
  I carried on cleaning the room when I found one of my son’s best friends Jacob blue jumpers what was not that odd from him letting himself in whenever he want’s what I did not mind and tried to treat him as I would my own son mostly because his parents did not really care about him and would even sometime would disappear for a weeks and without telling him what made him very self-reliant and a very friendly kid  what knows the meaning of not having nice parents what I had when  I was young, the odd thing about finding the jumper was that he was normally very good in the way of looking after anything what was his. <br />
<br />
Well I just put the jumper in a pile for him whenever he shows up and finished tidying the room, When I finely finished tidying the room, I took Jacobs jumper and started heading down stairs and the necklace in my pocket and both the jumper and the necklace touched my hand for a split second and I started to feel dizzy and lost my footing on the stairs and fell.   <br />
<br />
I opened my eyes and I lying on the floor plus there was something blond in front of my eye, I pushed the object out of my eyes while getting back on my feet but it was my hear what just rested on the edge of my eye what I just put down to my head playing trikes on me from hitting my head on the floor, when I was on my feet everything seemed so much bigger than it was and looked down at the door stop what looked like a bowling pin and saw how big it was to me now I reached out to grab it and relived how close I was to the ground I was what gave me Vertigo for like 5 seconds and  then I felt fine like I was always been this close to the ground, When I grabbed the pin it was surprisingly heavy and I saw my hand what looked small and smooth, then I saw a blue sleeve and looked down what showed I was wearing a blue top what I was not wearing before I fell down the stairs and brought my odd looking hand to it and realized it was Jacob’s one I found in Kyle’s room and felt sticking out ribs through the top what made shock wave blast throw my body. <br />
<br />
I ran up the stairs in a panic  to the bathroom and run in front of the fall length mirror what showed my son’s best friend Jacob as shocked as me, I shouted “JACOB” in a curious manner what came out in Jacobs voce what the reflection copped and I jumped back what the reflection mimicked me, when I got myself together I got in front of the mirror again and reached out and touched it what the reflection of Jacob did and I knew then I somehow have become a copy of Jacob, I looked down at my body and felt curious of it and started to explore feeling under my jumper and felt a smooth stomach what had a small 4 pack and a bumpy rib cage what kind of scared me because it all felt so natural, my new body the hair what went down to my eyes what I never have had and how small I was now the new sense of energy I could feel inside me and the clothes I was wearing what I just realized I was wearing some grey tracksuit bottoms what Jacob would wear at least 2-4 time a week what I did not like the look of myself but now I love them so comfy and fashionable.  <br />
<br />
I just stood there checking out the body I was now stuck in, what I started to surprisingly getting use to and familiar with, then a bang of a door closing what startled and terrified me, so I run to Kyle’s room, when I got there and jumped on to his bed I thought for a second why did I run to my son’s room and who could be down stairs I got of the bed and slowly walked to the top of the stair’s and heard my son and ME talking to each other, I slowly walked down the stairs till I was at the bottom of them and my body walked in and looked down at me and ruffled my hair saying “hay Jacob Kyle in just in the other room, Kyle wanted to ask if you wanted to have a sleep over tonight” I just looked up at him and wanted to shout who are you, what are you doing in my body, what is happening, but I just felt a numb but a good feeling come over me and I just smiled and said “hello Mr Punt no I can’t stay the night my parents are gone again and I need to look after their dog” what felt like what I wanted to say while fixing my heir from being ruffled after that he just smiled at me and went upstairs and I felt a natural urge  to go in to the room where Kyle was in. <br />
<br />
When I got to him he looked at the door where I entered and smiled when the door shut and kissed me what shocked me but I felt a worth and a urge that I have not felt for a long time and felt the need to kiss back, after a minute or so he brock the kiss and  we sat down on the couch to together, I was finding it hard to think of the person in beside me with his hand on my thigh close to my crotch and around my sholders as my son and not as my secret boyfriend what I was getting turned on by his football shorts he was still wearing and I think he can tell I was</p>
