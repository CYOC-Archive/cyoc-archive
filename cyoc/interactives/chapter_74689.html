<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;I take it you don't normally offer people the chance to stay the night with you?&quot; It had a pretty obvious <br />
answer, but the Cuco's rather menacing appearance in the room had shaken you a bit.<br />
<br />
Jenny smiled, and again the blush graced her cheeks. &quot;No,&quot; she said quietly as she shook her head lightly from <br />
side to side. She pulled out of the hug slowly, clearly not wanting to break the contact abruptly. She walked <br />
over to the bar and poured you both another drink before stretching out on the bed, propped up by a couple <br />
pillows. She patted the spot next to her. &quot;Come on and get comfortable,&quot; she said. &quot;It's not like you have <br />
anywhere better to be...do you?&quot; The hopeful look on her face had returned.<br />
<br />
You climbed beside her and took your glass from her hand. &quot;Nah, not really.&quot; A few moments of silence passed <br />
between you as you both sipped your drinks. &quot;So why me, then?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jenny paused. &quot;You smelled different.. and you..ACT different from most of the men I meet, particularly the <br />
photographers.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Different how?&quot; you asked, genuinely curious.<br />
<br />
Jenny scooted close to you and put a fingertip over your lips. &quot;That's two questions in a row..but..I think I <br />
can let it slide,&quot; she said softly. &quot;The change..usually arouses people. It most profoundly affects women, but <br />
it affects men as well. Don't try to deny it..I could smell that you were getting at least a bit turned on.&quot;<br />
<br />
You blushed rather hard. &quot;Well...uhh...yeah..&quot; you muttered as she pulled her fingertip from your lips.<br />
<br />
She giggled, filling the room with a genuine and airy girlish laugh. &quot;It's the pheremones in the air. Nothing <br />
to be ashamed of, Steve..if they didn't affect you at all, it would be because you were VERY gay. And I could <br />
tell that wasn't the case shortly after I'd been introduced to you.&quot;<br />
<br />
You blushed again. &quot;You noticed that, huh?&quot;<br />
<br />
She nodded. &quot;Yep. I notice most things. But anyway..most of the photographers either freak out and try to <br />
run..and that ends..&quot; she looked uncomfortably at the foot of the bed, &quot;that ends poorly for them. Or..they <br />
can't control their urges and they decide to..get a bit interactive with me..but you..YOU didn't do either.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, you told me I'd be safe,&quot; you replied matter-of-factly.<br />
<br />
&quot;And you trusted me,&quot; she said quietly. &quot;That means..that means the world,&quot; she said softly.<br />
<br />
It was impossible to deny that you were attracted to Jenny. Pretty much from the moment you laid eyes on her, <br />
you were attracted. While you would be hard pressed to call it fate or any such thing, you felt a level of <br />
safety with her, despite having no valid experience to back that up. &quot;You're..you're easy to trust, Jenny..&quot; <br />
you said, somewhat struggling for words, just as she appeared to be.<br />
<br />
Jenny laid her head on your chest and wrapped an arm around your shoulders. &quot;Any girlfriend in the picture for <br />
you?&quot; she asked quietly.<br />
<br />
&quot;No..I'm single right now. There have been girls..but..&quot; you paused. &quot;But they never seem to work out.&quot; You <br />
stroked her hair absentmindedly, causing her to snuggle more tightly. She sat up for a second to finish her <br />
drink, leaving the empty glass on the nightstand before snuggling back against you.<br />
<br />
&quot;Steve..I..&quot; she paused, then frowned slightly, let out a sigh, and closed her eyes. &quot;Never mind,&quot; she said <br />
sadly.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; You finished your drink and put it on the nightstand near your side of the bed, continuing to stroke <br />
her hair and neck. She nuzzled against your chest with a smile again.<br />
<br />
&quot;I've never been with a man before,&quot; she said very quietly. &quot;Not..not like..like this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You've never snuggled?&quot; you asked her in surprise.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, I never have.The men..they want me for one thing and one thing only. I know I'm beautiful. That's not <br />
vanity speaking, it's fact. I know that..for some of them..the fact I can shift is a turn on..and..it's all <br />
they want. When they want me..they take me rough..they beg for the beast, even the ones that didn't know my <br />
secret..they begged for the beast,&quot; she trailed off as you continued to stroke her hair and rub her back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jesus, you've been raped before?&quot; You asked, your voice full of a bit of alarm and concern. <br />
<br />
She shook her head. &quot;Not rape..not..really. Just rough. Rough enough that it would have turned into rape if <br />
I'd resisted. Or rough..designed to either dominate my animal side or to call it out.&quot;<br />
<br />
“Fuck..that's harsh,” you replied, more to yourself than her. Without realizing it, your arm tightened around <br />
her and you pulled her more tightly against you, eliciting a soft sigh. She slowly pushed her way up your body <br />
and gave you a lingering kiss.<br />
<br />
“I want you to..BE with me tonight, Steve..” she told you quietly. Her soft fingers found your hand and <br />
entangled with yours. She looked into your eyes, giving you a look full of both desire and vulnerability.<br />
<br />
“I'd like that very much,” you said, cupping her face with your free hand and giving her a soft, deep kiss. <br />
Jenny pressed against you more now, kissing you more deeply, with a hungry desperation and a soft sigh. She <br />
pulled away for a moment, rolling away from you, but stretching out on her side to face you. You mirrored her <br />
actions, laying next to her, letting your bodies touch as you rubbed her back, never taking a liberty of even <br />
sliding a hand up her shirt or down her sleep pants.<br />
<br />
All the while, she reciprocated, tentatively rubbing your back as well, occasionally stroking your face as she <br />
made soft contented noises. Little speech passed between the two of you in the silence of the room. “I <br />
really..I don't know where this is going to lead, Steve..” she said apologetically. “I wish I did, just for <br />
both our sakes.”<br />
<br />
You nodded. “I hear ya. But I don't really think either of us COULD know how this is going to all turn out. I <br />
mean..it's not exactly an every day occurrence...you know..werewo-” you caught yourself again, “lycans and <br />
humans having crushes on each other.”<br />
<br />
She smiled at your stumble on the words, and then she blushed a bit when you  said the words “having crushes”. <br />
“So..this isn't just something you're doing to make me feel better..?”<br />
<br />
“What? No!” you blurted out, before blushing rather hard. You inwardly cursed yourself for your blatant <br />
enthusiasm. “I mean..uhh..I..kinda thought it was obvious that..I..” you trailed off, fumbling on your words.<br />
<br />
“Shh..” she said, pressing up against you and kissing you again. “I know what you meant..” This only <br />
intensified your blushing. “You realize though..that what you see here isn't ALL of me..I'm also every bit of <br />
the creature you saw me become.”<br />
<br />
You nodded. “I know. This..” you stroked her face and ran your hand down her side, “This is just a part of <br />
you.”<br />
<br />
“What do you see when you look at me?” she asked, a curious tone in her voice.<br />
<br />
“I see a beautiful creature, intelligent and vulnerable. Someone who still hasn't lost all her hope for the <br />
world, even when things might make her feel otherwise. Someone who has the ability to walk in a world that <br />
most of us could never imagine. Someone who could defend herself and the things she cares about quite <br />
effectively...but who hopes that day won't come. I see someone who is beautiful, regardless of which shape she <br />
takes, and who embodies the contradiction that comes with being a female of any species.”  Jenny was staring <br />
at the mattress by the time you finished talking. You cleared your throat nervously. “Okay..rant over,” you <br />
said, giving a nervous giggle.<br />
<br />
She looked back at you with eyes that were sparkling with tears. “You sure know how to make a girl feel <br />
special,” she said with a half-smile, before pressing against you with fervor and kissing you incredibly <br />
deeply. She broke the kiss, but left her forehead leaned against yours. She kept her eyes closed, and <br />
whispered very quietly, “You could easily hold my heart in your hand..and probably sooner, rather than <br />
later..” she trailed off again and blushed. (Which really seemed to be a trend between the two of you this <br />
evening.) “Just..” she opened her eyes and stared into yours, “Just don't hurt me..please.”<br />
<br />
“Never,” you replied and kissed her deeply again, in a kiss that lasted longer than any of the ones before it. <br />
When the kiss ended, Jenny got up and out of bed, moving to the light switch and dimming it almost to total <br />
blackness before crawling back up on the bed.<br />
<br />
“Take me..please..” she asked, again a hint of desperation in her tone.</p>
