<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was mid morning when Dan woke from the lovely smell of bacon Andrew was cooking in the kitchen. He was slightly disoriented figuring out where he was, until he remembered he and Andrew feel asleep in front of the TV in the living room. Dan looked down to see that his balls had another massive growth spurt overnight from the pills. They were now larger than the 3 seater couch behind him. In fact, the massive scrotum took up most of the room. He was almost 6ft off the ground as he lay on them. However, in addition to the usual increase in size, this time there was an unusual tinge of pain in his left nut. Nothing too bad, but slightly annoying.<br />
&quot;Breakfast is ready.&quot; Andrew said as he entered from the kitchen in his work clothes. &quot;I need to head off now, so unfortunately I can&#39;t help you adapt to your new size until this evening babes.&quot;<br />
He crawled up onto Dan&#39;s nuts and stretched out to kiss his bf goodbye before sliding back down and headed to the front door.<br />
Before Andrew he left he called back to Dan. &quot;Oh and don&#39;t forget to unload the washing machine this morning. I could hear it going when I came home last night.&quot;<br />
*Jacob!*<br />
Dan had completely forgot that he had his friend cooped up inside his left nut all night! No wonder he had some pain down there, Jacob was probably trying to escape. He really hoped he wasn&#39;t too late to get Jacob out now.<br />
Jumping down to the floor from his balls, Dan started looking for a friend size lump in the massive amount of flesh of his.<br />
&quot;Jacob! Buddy are you in there?&quot; He called with cupped hands around his mouth and pressed against the large testicle that contained Jacob.<br />
Suddenly there was movement, then a human sized lump emerged next to Dan.<br />
“Jeez man took your time to wake up! Get me out of here.” Came Jacob’s muffled voice from inside Dan.<br />
“Will do man, I just need to have a wank to flush you out.”<br />
<br />
Dan grabbed his phone and started looking at some porn to get him in the mood before stroking his cock rapidly. It didn’t take long until he could feel himself very close. He had found bigger his balls had gotten each day, the quicker and easier it was for Dan to come. This day was no exception. <br />
“Get ready.” Dan warned just before he let out an intense moan. Gallons of cum came gushing out all over the living room. He then felt something massive get thrust up through his urethra from the pressure of his flowing cum. Dan watched as his normal sized boner, pumping cum like a fire hose, suddenly stretches to human size proportions as Jacob is thrust out to safety. First his cock’s head widened enough to Jacob’s head, then stretched immensely to accommodate the width of his shoulders. Then all the rest. Jacob lay on the floor breathing heavily, covered is so much of Dan’s splooge that he looked like a white goo monster. He looked very relieved to be in the fresh air rather than cramped up inside his best friend’s nut. <br />
<br />
<br />
Jacob took a 30 min shower to get as much of Dan’s off him as possible. While Dan waited for his buddy to get clean, he mopped up the mess he made in the living room. He also moved Jacob’s clothes from the washing machine to the dryer. This was not an easy task. The new size of his balls meant that he could not drag them on the wheeled stand he had. Nor could they fit anywhere but the living room, and definitely not through any doorway. Luckily he found his scrotum could stretch about a couple of feet between his groin and his nuts, so as long as he dragged his balls to the door of the laundry he could reach both machines with a little stretching.<br />
<br />
Jacobs left the shower and toweled off. He came back to the living room still naked with the towel around his waist and awkwardly smiled.<br />
“Well that was certainly an adventure.”<br />
Dan tired not to stare, but if it wasn’t his imagination, Jacob’s body seemed to have gotten even hotter than it was yesterday. He seemed to have lost all of his body fat, emphasizing his muscles even more than before. He even had those V groin muscles just above the towel, something Dan had always found super hot on guys so definitely would&#39;ve remembered him having earlier. Even what little body hair Jacob had was gone below his neck. Immediately Dan got a boner from thinking all this, so chose not to bring the changes up to his friend.<br />
<br />
“I’m sorry Jacob, I didn’t mean to leave you there overnight. Here have some breakfast, you must be starving.” Dan pointed towards the plate of bacon and eggs with toast. Jacob did not hesitate. He immediately sat down and scoffed down the food.<br />
“I see you’ve grown again.” He said between mouthfuls.<br />
“Ah yeah,” Dan replied looking back at his sack as it took up most of the room. “They’re getting ridiculous, I really hope I hear back for the people doing the trial soon. What was it like in there?”<br />
“Humid and sticky, and very cramped. Through a lot less cramped this morning due to your expansion. It was kinda like falling asleep in a bathtub and waking up in a pool. To be honest, it wasn’t an unpleasant experience. Just something I wouldn’t do any time soon. I was comfortable enough to have a wank inside you at some point this morning at least.”<br />
“You came inside me?!” Dan asked, slightly weirded out and slightly turned on about the fact that Jacob’s cum was left floating inside his nuts somewhere at the moment.<br />
“I was bored and horny while I waited for you to wake up. It’s not like I could leave a mess in there anyway, I was just cumming into your own pool of cum.” Jacob said defensively.<br />
He paused for a bit thoughtfully, looking for a way to change the subject, and then grinned.<br />
“Maybe in a week when those balls are the size of your backyard, I’ll bring some mates over and we could have a pool party and orgy in there.” He said jokingly.<br />
“No! Haha, please don’t. I don’t want people seeing me like this”<br />
“I wouldn’t worry about it, you’d be a gay legend.”<br />
They heard the drier’s ding as it stopped so Jacob went over to grab his clothes from it. He put them on feeling the nice warm fabric against his skin.<br />
“I best be off now. See you soon. Hopefully when they have cured you.” Jacob said as he playfully flicked Dan’s boner with his hand, causing the poor throbbing thing to bounce back into place.<br />
“Yeah man, see you. Thanks for being so cool about all of this, and for me kinda kidnapping you by making you be the first person ever to sleep inside someone else’s balls.”<br />
Jacob laughed and headed to the front door and gave Dan a friendly mock salute as he left.<br />
<br />
Dan took another pill and looked at his massive balls taking up the majority of the room.<br />
<br />
*How will they fit in this house in a couple of days?* Dan wondered.</p>
