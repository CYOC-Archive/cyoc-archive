<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Lance was busy working when he felt the telltale rumblings of hunger. After having very little to eat for breakfast; stemming from the fact that his pregnant wife has developed a taste for mixing odd foodstuffs together. While most seemed mundane and typical for a pregnant woman; Lance did find a few of the bizarre combinations quite the appetite suppressant. Yet the were-panther could not deny the fact that he was hungry; looking at the time on his work computer he grabs his phone to place a call for some take out at a nearby restaurant.<br />
<br />
While he did make an effort to eat healthier, Lance could not help but notice that he was going back to more and more take out food as of late. Whether it was a comfort to him that he could not shake or it was due to the fact that he and Lila just wanted to eat and not bother to prepare something. For him because he spends quite a bit of time at the Gazette and some time at KPXX; coming home exhausted, more so if he had to attend a council session at the elder council building after work. For Lila, the feeling of not wanting to cook was the fact that she was pregnant and just wanted to be held by her mate. At times feeling frustrated that she cannot get any sexual release; Lila does take comfort when her were-panther mate snuggles with her, feeding her snacks as they watch television or just sit and talk at the end of their respective work days.<br />
<br />
Lila was an accountant. At one time she worked for Moon Lake’s comptroller at city hall; volunteering her time at the Elder council building, she soon fell in love with Lance as he took over his older brother’s responsibilities as a were-rep. It wasn’t long after getting together, she started looking at Lance’s books for Knight Media and finding several erroneous irregularities. Able to flex her CPA credentials; Lila soon quickly turned several of Knight Media’s holdings around. Some finding Lance’s wife a foreboding force when she was present, few coined a nickname for her; Ballbreaker. How Lila earned this nick name was unclear; what was clear, is none ever dared to say that in the presence of Lila or Lance, for fear of either’s wrath.<br />
<br />
Getting up from his desk and leaving his office; Lance still sees Ella Alyn still at her desk working.<br />
“Your expose is good,” Lance putting the draft back on her desk; “just double check your facts and sources and get it to print for Tuesday’s edition.”<br />
“Will do,” Ella nodding; “regarding the article about the Parker’s. Do you want their criminal allegations cited,” Ella looking at her boss; “or do you want some bland bio?”<br />
“I told you we need context to give our community a reason as to why we have those coded messages going on,” Lance responding; “spare no punches for those two.”<br />
“Down and dirty it is,’ Ella smiling; “if I didn’t know better, I’d swear we were becoming the next tabloid newspaper.”<br />
“Please,” Lance shuddering; “no suggestions during Tuesday’s staff meeting regarding the latest sighting of Elvis or the latest adventures of Bat-Boy.”<br />
“I’m only teasing,” Ella laughing; “I just want to be sure if we should even mention the unproven allegations of the Parker&#39;s.”<br />
“Like your expose regarding the Crawford’s,” Lance answering calmly; “cite your sources on those.”<br />
“Understood,” Ella nodding as she went back to her work; but before Lance can make it to the elevator, Ella asks him one more question. “How is your article pertaining to the breaking at your brother’s place fairing?”<br />
“Difficult,” Lance waiting for the elevator to reach his floor; “having to word it in such a way so as not to out the existence of were’s is not an easy task. Nor is trying to report the deaths of some of the intruders at the hands of minors; I’m having a tough time obeying the privacy laws in place for minors and reporting the facts.”<br />
Ella laughs; “such is the life of a reporter.”<br />
<br />

<br />
Having to walk home after picking up takeout for lunch; Lance spots not only his Prius in the driveway but he sees Rick’s pickup truck also parked. Lance sighed as he was hoping for a quiet Sunday afternoon with his wife. Stepping into the doorway, Lance was soon jumped upon by Jasper and Yogi. Seeing that Ester was also here and Cindy with her aunt; Lance soon had a headache build; whether it was from his still lingering hangover or the fact that he was feeling worn out, he was soon forced to put such ideals to the side as he had to wade through twin boys wanting him to play.<br />
“Lila can I get some help here,” Looking at his wife as she watches Lance’s plight.<br />
“Jasper! Yogi!” Ester nearly shouting; “give your uncle a chance to get in the door!”<br />
“Thank you,” Lance watching the six year old twin boys sulk back to the living room; “had I known everyone would be here, I would have gotten more take out. Is Rick not here,” Lance looking around.<br />
“He is hiding in the back yard,” Lila joining her husband in the kitchen; “still suffering from yesterday.”<br />
“Then perhaps the children should be out there and keep him company,” Lance sitting down; “I just want to snuggle with you my love. I brought lunch for us.”<br />
“I know,” Lila sitting on Lance’s lap; “but after you left for work Ester called and one thing led to another and we now have a family gathering for Sunday dinner.”<br />
“I take it you want me to go out and get some groceries,” Lance placing a hand on Lila’s pregnant belly; “can we do that after I get something to eat?”<br />
“I suppose,” Lila smiling as she looks into the take out Lance got; “did you get anything to go with the Crab Rangoon?”<br />
“Eat now you two,” Ester looking at Lance and Lila; “because I’m going to need both of you to help me prepare dinner.”<br />
“Did you get Cindy, Jasper and Yogi to bring over their swim wear,” Lance pulling out some fried rice and noodles, along with some odd beef dish; “they can spend an hour or so splashing around in the hot tub.”<br />
“I can have Rick head home and collect that,” Ester sampling a crab Rangoon; “those aren’t bad.”<br />
“Try them with sauce,” Lila speaking through bites of food.<br />
“So what do you need me to pick up at the grocery store,” Lance using some chopsticks to attack the fried noodles.<br />
“The usual items that complement a beef pot roast,” Ester speaking; “potatoes, onions, peas, carrots…”<br />
“Don’t forget the pickles,” Lila adding; “I’m craving pickles.”<br />
“And a couple coconut cream pies,” Ester adding; “got to have dessert as well.”<br />
“Oh and soda,” Lila getting up to grab a drink; “we’ll need lots of soda and juice.”<br />
“So you already have the roast in the oven I take it,” Lance grabbing the last crab rangoon.<br />
“I’ll have it in the oven as soon as you come back with the groceries,” Ester answering; “I suggest you get going.”<br />
“Don’t worry about the children Lance,” Lila looking at her husband; “we have lunch for them already covered.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lance sighs as he stares at the take out already consumed; feeling like he has not nearly had enough, he is soon forced to get up once again and head out the door.<br />
‘Fortunately,’ Lance thinking to himself; ‘I have my Prius to drive this time.’<br />
Seeing Ester and Rick’s children watching television and then being served grilled cheese finger sandwiches with juice and fruit slices by both Ester and Lila, gets that hungry feeling going in Lance again. Unsure if he will make it until supper time without getting something else to eat; the were-panther rushes out the door.<br />
“God dam I’m still hungry,” Lance mumbling as he walks to his car; “screw it all, I’m getting a sub sandwhich after I get groceries. And then I&#39;m having a nap when I get back home.”</p>
