<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Having breasts, Patrick decided, wasn&#39;t what he thought it would be. After he&#39;d gone to the kitchen to get something to drink, his nuts still sore, like he&#39;d either been kicked down there or he had a bad cold, he mulled over what he&#39;d done. Going back and forth on it being a good thing, and how he should stop what was happening, he ambled back to his bedroom. Sitting down before the computer, he stared at his profile, reached for the mouse, then rested his hand back in his lap.<br />
<br />
Mind going back over the amount of power he had access to with the Chronivac, Patrick suddenly found it overwhelming. Reaching for the mouse, he shifted cursor, entered commands to stop what was happening, changed his mind, and instead, began to enter a new set of commands. Thinking, &quot;I&#39;ve come this far, I might as well as see this through,&quot; he left everything the same, but changed the one week to three months. Feeling he was doing the right thing, he saved and locked his profile, stood and told himself, &quot;I&#39;ll give it six months after they&#39;ve finished growing before deciding what to do,&quot; and satisfied, he went to watch television.<br />
<br />
But, as the months slipped by, he found developing tits wasn&#39;t what he expected. Having no idea if it was because of what he&#39;d done, or some unforseen consequence, the first thing Patrick did notice was what was happening to his dick and balls. Always self-conscious about the size, to the point he tried to avoid changing in the locker room, and would often change in one of the bathroom stalls, the teenage boy was now even more so as his penis and scrotum shrank from the length of about five to six inches flacid down to one inch flacid. Finding it was difficult to grasp his cock, he did find some relief in the fact he now sat to pee, something made easier as his male equipment also shifted lower, to the point it was almost between his legs.<br />
<br />
Of course the big thing he found disconcerting about having a small set of junk was the erections. When his package was gradually shrinking, Patrick was certain he&#39;d lost the ability to get hard. But, sometime after his cock and balls went from being what a teenage guy had down to what was normal for, what he guessed, was average for a newborn, he discovered shortly after he still could get hard. The problem with this, he soon discovered, was he had no proper way to grasp his new equipment, and through trial and error, he figured out the best way to get his rocks off was to rub the area betwixt his legs, which was now even more sensitive to touch and stimuli, especially when he was horny, which left shooting nothing when he finally climaxed. Finding this was almost too weird to deal with, as he eventually found out he was almost masturbating like a girl would, he came close to undoing all the change.<br />
<br />
What stopped him from doing so was the breast bud. Having never given it any thought as to how a pair of tits develop, grow, he was surprised to find as he stood naked in the bathroom one day and examined his body his left nipple was different. Swollen, popped up and out, he touched it, and in the process found it so tender, it was uncomfortable to touch. Curious to know if this was normal, wondering if because of how they were growing it would mean his tits would be lopsided, he frowned and tried to figure out who he could talk to about it. The problem he found with this was there was no one he was able to speak to, as he was the only one aware of the changes his body was going through. Thinking his mother might be able to help, he started to get dressed, and found the matter was driven from his mind when his shirt brushed against the sore lump. Taking off the shirt and looking at, the pulling back on and adjusting it, he spent another fitful minute of trying to get comfortable before he sighed in frustration and headed back to his room to find some other top to wear.<br />
<br />
From there, it was another point in learning what it meant to grow and have breasts. All he could wear were soft, cotton shirts, which he had few of to begin with, and was forced to go shopping for, which led him to another bit of self-discovery; his choice in clothes had somehow changed. Before, he&#39;d never given any thought about what he wore, but as he browsed the selections in the boy&#39;s teen section, he found himself displeased with how all of it felt, looked when he tried a couple things on, which eventually led him to making choices from the girl&#39;s tween area. Trying to find tops which were as unisex as possible, worried someone would recognise him, Patrick eventually settled on a number of selections of short-sleeved t-shirts made of the softest cotton he&#39;d ever felt, and was welcome to, as the fabric didn&#39;t rub uncomfortably against his burgeoning breasts.<br />
<br />
Eager to get home with his purchases, the surprise of having to wear girl&#39;s t-shirts wasn&#39;t the only thing, for as soon as he got home, it was to be greeted by his mother, who told him, &quot;I bought you some new clothes. They&#39;re washed and on your bed.&quot;<br />
<br />
Curious about this, Patrick headed for his room, where he discovered what his mom had gotten him was several bras. Staring at them, confused, wondering how his mum had known, he left his garments were they were and went to find his mom. Locating her in the den, he wondered how best to broach the subject, as he didn&#39;t think it&#39;d go over well to start off talking about he was growing tits, he cleared his throat and said, &quot;Umm, mom, about the stuff you bought me,&quot; but never got any further as his mother said, &quot;What stuff?&quot;<br />
<br />
Perplexed by this, Patrick tried to figure out how best to answer before he told her, &quot;You know, when you last went shopping and bought me a few things I apparently needed.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, you mean your jeans, underwear, socks and shoes,&quot; his mother answered back before asking, &quot;Do you need some new stuff?&quot;<br />
<br />
Cofused even more, Patrick didn&#39;t know how to reply and after a bit, mumbled, &quot;I think I&#39;ll need new underwear at some point,&quot; to which his mom answered, &quot;Okay. As soon as I get paid, we&#39;ll get you some,&quot; before returning to the textbook she&#39;d been studying before he&#39;d come in.<br />
<br />
Not sure what was going on, Patrick mumbled, &quot;Thanks,&quot; and went back to his room.<br />
<br />
Baffled as to what had transpired, he found himself in for another shock, as the clothes he&#39;d purchased, and the stuff his mother had gotten him, were gone. Searching for them, he soon found everything already put away, and wondering how this had happened, he sat down at his desk. Booting up his computer, and activating the Chronivac software the moment he was logged-in, Patrick scanned his profile, and mulled over if he should stop. Deliberating on the matter, he found he simply couldn&#39;t give an affirmative yes or no. Some of what he&#39;d experienced was uncomfortable, to downright weird. But other things, he reckoned, weren&#39;t too bad. Standing, he paced back and forth a moment before undressing and lying down on his bed, he turned over on his side and hugged the soft comforter close to his now soft skin. Liking how it felt, he sighed and after some time figured it&#39;d couldn&#39;t get any weirder than it already had gotten.<br />
<br />
To which he soon learned how wrong he was. If his mother buying him bras, and not knowing she&#39;d done so, it was nothing compared to finding a girl&#39;s one-piece black swimsuit amonst his stuff instead of his normal shorts, and finding out he wore it for PE. Wanting to know why reality had changed to the point he wore a girl&#39;s bathing suit, and changed in the girl&#39;s locker room, but having no one to ask, his questions was again driven from his thoughts as he found out none of the girls found it strange a guy was changing in the same locker room with them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Although I can hardly consider myself a guy,&quot; Patrick thought as he saw his reflection one day.<br />
<br />
His breasts had gotten fuller since he&#39;d last looked, and it would have surprised him to know his bras had changed to accomodate the now A cup they filled. But what really drew his attention was how, with his teeny, tiny boy parts, his smooth hairless body, the thin eye brows above his eyes, how flat his stomach was, and the way his waist had taken a pinched look, he looked more like a girl. Wrapping around his torso the towel he&#39;d been in the process of doing so before he&#39;d stopped, Patrick frowned. Something was wrong, as he didn&#39;t want to be a girl, and had had only wanted a pair of tits. Yet, somehow, his body had all but morphed, and he couldn&#39;t help but ask himself, &quot;Did I make a mistake?&quot; as he headed across the locker room and with the towel still wrapped around him, began to dress in the similar way the girls around him were before heading for his next class.<br />
<br />
Pensive about all of it, Patrick leaned back in his desk chair as he mulled over what he&#39;d discovered in the locker room some time ago. Looking down at the pert swell his chest now was, he touched the poked-out part of the sleeper shirt, and gave a shudder of pleasure as the soft cotton fabric brushed against his erect nipples. The three months having come and gone, it was now almost four months since he&#39;d first used the Chronivac, and mulling over everything he experienced, from the discomfort of growing tits, to the way his clothes changed, to reality altering itself, to how, in the long, he decided having breasts wasn&#39;t it was all it was cracked up to be. Thinking how they made him feel self-conscious, like people, mostly guys, were staring, to even how he&#39;d had to adjust how he stood, give consideration were something was in relation to his chest, as he knocked his tits against stuff a number of times, Patrick felt it was probably time to turn himself back to who he&#39;d been before he&#39;d given himself tits.<br />
<br />
The problem he found, was, for reasons he couldn&#39;t understand, he couldn&#39;t bring himself to do so. Something was holding him back, and he wanted to know what. Looking at the computer screen, and his profile pulled up on the Chronivac, he reached out, pushed on the desk, and spun the chair around till he was facing his bed. Using his feet to stop to spin, he looked at the garments he&#39;d left on the bed, a denim skirt, a short sleeve t-shirt, a pair of socks, pastel purple panties with a heart pattern on them, the boots on the floor. Lately, he&#39;d been dressing more and more in girl&#39;s clothing to see how far he could push the boundaries of people&#39;s perception before someone said or did something. But nobody had, which he found he wasn&#39;t surprised, as the girl&#39;s coach had walked in on him a number of times whilst he was changing, or he&#39;d used the women&#39;s bathroom in public, among other instances.<br />
<br />
With a quick spin, he twisted around in place, but did nothing to stop the motion this time. Thinking about all of it, Patrick tried to work what to do, and after some time, found himself conflicted. Needing more than ever someone to talk to, he stopped and wondered if the answer was with the Chronivac. Standing, he walked over to the bed, picked up the skirt, which he knew would come down just shy of his knees, and playing with the three buttons, he found he couldn&#39;t help himself as he thought the outfit cute. Tossing down the article of clothing, he sat down on his bed, hugged himself, shifted about in place, then brought his legs up and placed his feet flat on the bed. Wrapping his arms his legs, finding he liked how it felt to have if breasts pressing against his legs, Patrick asked himself, &quot;What am I to do? Should I leave everything the way it is? Or should I use the Chronivac to change myself, either some more, or back to who I used to be before I had breasts?&quot;</p>
