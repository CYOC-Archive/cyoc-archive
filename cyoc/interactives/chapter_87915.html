<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Further.  Take it further please.”  Daisy half-begged Jacob, the need for her horse form greater than ever.  <br />
<br />
“Of course dear!”  Jacob cried out in response, this time not hiding his joy at her wish to keep them changing back as he pressed down on the Gas a little more.  If he kept driving along like this, it wouldn’t be long before he was free of these human bindings, his thick shaft free for all to see, and for him to proudly display.  <br />
<br />
Now that they had just passed the halfway mark in their reversion, the horse mind was now the dominant force if only just so at this point.  And it desired their old bodies, as did they now.  <br />
<br />
With the turnoff approaching, Jacob watched as his inner two fingers slowly began to merge together and lengthen, while the thumbs, index and pinkie fingers seemed to slowly shrivel and retreat into what was slowly becoming forelegs.  The same thing, he saw happening to Daisy as she could take them to in front of her long face and watch it happen.  <br />
<br />
But something else had her attention, by now the food and drink she’d consumed had worked their way through her body and were ready to be released.  As a human, she would have found a place to pull over and take care of it, but with her simpler thoughts and wishes, an audible fart escaped her.  <br />
<br />
After which her sphincter relaxed, enabling the first log to escape as she sighed inwardly, but not in shame as she defecated inside her increasingly painfully-fitting clothes, the outline of her pussy etched out faintly in the thick material that bulged out slightly just beneath her tail, as the brown mess was pushed along her crotch and across her large, firm buttocks.  As the last of the heavy logs slid out her bladder relaxed as her front now became wet with piss that pooled around her while the brown filth remained trapped inside her attire.  <br />
<br />
The smell of it reached Jacob’s massive nostrils before she’d even finished and as he glanced over, his still growing cock slid further up his chest.  <br />
<br />
“Needed to let it out?”  He asked with not a shred of disgust in his voice.  <br />
<br />
“Yep.”  Daisy replied as she shuffled a bit to make herself more comfortable in the seat.  <br />
<br />
“Good.  Here’s the turnoff at last.”  He announced as he used his still usable arms to turn the wheel and get them off the main road and onto the dirt road that would take them the rest of the way.  <br />
<br />
He still knew he needed to be slower than he was currently going, but his ever-growing lust for Daisy along with his need for his original form saw him pushing the Ford harder than would be recommended.  The poorer state of the road causing them to bounce around a bit in their seats as they hit the bumps and dips.  <br />
<br />
By now, Daisy’s human breasts had started to retreat into her gradually barrelling chest as the horse teats formed lower down her torso, and had since lost her thumbs.  Not that she cared for this, as she managed to work the controls for her seat to take the backrest to as low as it was able to, to which she lowered herself onto.  This position reminding her of the times that she could be in a field and roll onto her back as her memories drifted to those particular events.  <br />
<br />
The smell of organic waste filled the truck but neither Daisy nor Jacob paid it any mind, with her thinking about her chance to frolic around mate with Jacob once they got to the Cabin, and him thinking about the latter, until something caught his attention.  <br />
<br />
A loud pop reached his pointed ears and he quickly looked to the source of it, noticing that his stretching body was finally beginning to rip its way free of his human clothings.  With one of the two buttons holding up his dungarees striking the windscreen and making a small chink in it.  Thinking about how much better it felt without it digging into his shoulder, he squirmed and twisted until the other strap was pulled off the other shoulder, the upper portion of the dungarees dropping down and resting by his waist.  <br />
<br />
This in turn, finally allowed him to see his horsecock, mottled pink and black, and standing up hard with his lust, the smell of the precum that eked out from it slowly adding to the other smells that filled the interior.  <br />
<br />
While daisy had been distracted momentarily by the noise, she soon returned to her wishing to play around, pulling her legs back from under the footwell to mimic the act of doing so.  But this pushed the limits of what her own clothes could take to past their limits with the loud tear announcing their surrender to the stress imposed on them.  From the tail hole, the seam had split along the centre, coming to a halt just beneath the waist at the front.  <br />
<br />
“Oops!“  She giggled at the event as bits of faecal matter dropped off of her large horse-like ass to land on the seat, sticking her enlarged velvety-black vagina into the open where it belonged.  Though the giggling was garble by her own nickering produced by her long face.  <br />
<br />
A new scent reached her nostrils, mixed into the smells of their bodies, and the biological waste they’d released.  Working herself back up to sitting, managing to keep herself from sitting on her tail, her eyes focused on Jacob’s heavy member, seeming to pulse to her.  Her want, her need to have it in her becoming more with the passing moments.  <br />
<br />
Jacob was still in control of the Ford Ranger at this time, though he lacked opposable thumbs and his fingers were either stretching, widening, and merging, or shrivelling away into his arms.  Nothing they were doing concerned him much, since he had the Ring, he could do whatever he wanted, or whatever Daisy wanted him to do.</p>
