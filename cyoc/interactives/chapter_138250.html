<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff had lately been feeling like his mom was treating him like he was 6 years old and not 16, with her borderline helicopter parenting.  Coincidentally, Jamie plans on making Jeff 6 years old again so that she can have her little boy back. As she is making him younger against his will, she opted to have reality mostly altered.  Only Jamie and Jeff will remember him being 16, while everyone else would see and treat him as a little kid.  Jamie also wants to reduce Jeff&#39;s intelligence and maturity to that of a typical 1st grader, and also have his room and clothes age appropriate.  She left his awareness on on purpose as she wanted him to learn his place and accept his new status as a child and she plans on keeping him 6 for a while.  With all desired changes in place, she pressed the button to start the change and proceeded to change out of her work clothes, anxiously awaiting the sight of Jeff being her little boy again.<br />
<br />
Jeff failed to notice the tingle as he was carrying the groceries inside of the house.  He did find it odd that the door knob was higher than usual, but was a little suspicious upon learning that the bags were heavier than he thought.  He tripped while carrying only one bag and noticed that his clothes were different, morphing into cargo shorts, a graphic tee and velcro shoes.  Leaving the bag behind, Jeff ran into the nearest bathroom while still shrinking, having to use the stepping stool that he never remembered seeing.  As soon as he saw the boy in the mirror, a high pitched scream came out of his mouth.  Jeff was reunited with the body he had a decade ago, with all of his baby teeth returning alongside his round face, small hands and the messy hair he had as a kid.  He remembered giving his mom a hard time about getting a haircut when he was younger and he looked as if he back to those days.<br />
<br />
Jeff then ran to his room to see if the chronivac had made a mistake, only to notice that his room had changed completely.  Gone were the sports trophies, weights and the bed he normally had, and replaced with toys both on the shelf and on the floor, as well as the racecar bed he had as a kid.  The Chronivac had also disappeared, which made his heart sank.  Things only got worse as soon as he turned around and saw his mother, who had to have been at least 2 feet taller than him now.  <br />
<br />
&quot;The chronivac worked better than I thought,&quot; Jamie said, while sounding almost too happy, &quot;Now you&#39;re my little boy again, and it was all thanks to you.&quot;  As she ruffled his head, Jeff started to question her, &quot;You did this?  But why?  I didn&#39;t do anything wrong, did I?&quot; &quot;Oh, it&#39;s not a punishment sweetie,&quot; Jamie replied, &quot;I just wanted us to be close like we used to, and now you get to stay with me for at least another 10 years.&quot;  &quot;So you thought turning me into a kid was gonna help?!&quot; Jeff replied, while starting to sound like he&#39;s about to have a tantrum, &quot;How old am I anyway?&quot; &quot;This many,&quot; Jamie replied in a firm tone while holding up 6 fingers.  Jeff couldn&#39;t believe that his own mother would talk to him like he really is a first grader, and also that she would deliberately turn him into a little kid.  His reduced status, maturity and size pushed him into tears, especially because he now thinks that his mom will make him grow up again.<br />
<br />
Jamie didn&#39;t think this would be so difficult, to reduced her own child to tears just because she made him younger.  Still, she had to stand her ground and let Jeff know about how things will be for him.  &quot;Jeff, look at me,&quot; Jamie said in a firm, authoritative tone, &quot;Now that you&#39;re six years old again, here are the new rules...&quot;  Before she could even start, Jeff started screaming and he even hit his own mother.  This prompted her to give him a warning under the threat of a time-out.  &quot;It&#39;s not fair mom,&quot; Jeff shouted in the middle of his tantrum, &quot;I DON&#39;T WANNA BE LITTLE! I DON&#39;T!&quot; &quot;Well, you are little again, and there are some new rules in the house,&quot; Jamie explained to her child, &quot; First, you can only call me &#39;mommy&#39;.  I will not allow you to yell, hit or swear at me, and you can never leave the house without me or another adult. You will do exactly as I tell you, and you will go to bed at 8 PM every night from now on.  Finally, I took your Chronivac and it is now mine.  I have set up a password that you can never figure out so that I can keep you a 6 year old for as long as I want.&quot; &quot;How long, mom?  I don&#39;t wanna be a first grader again.&quot; Jeff replied.  &quot;Could be weeks, months, or even years before I decide to let you be a teen again.  Depends on if you can behave.&quot;  These words made Jeff shutter as he suddenly realized that she was in control and that he was stuck as her little one.</p>
