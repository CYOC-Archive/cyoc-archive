<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Antonio started at his reflection in the pool of water, he hadn&#39;t left the crater of his battle with the beast man for hours, he couldn&#39;t bring himself to look away from his new form.<br />
He had taken on the humanoid form of his opponent, even gained a few new skills, evolved a few to boot, but the form he saw in his reflection was unlike anything he had seen before, his feet were still paws, long black claws extending from each pad, his ankle elongated before connecting to his shin and knee, but the most concerning part of his form was the lack of fur on his body, it was just a solid midnight black shiny layer of skin, the muscles of his new form covered in it, however the spaces between each muscle were coated in crimson fire, the heat of his body causing the pool of water to bubble and boil from his presence alone, with a bright glow in the center of his chest, the flames on his body rising and falling as it fluctuated in a beating pulse. <br />
The tail at the base of his spine was gone, replaced by two tendril like appendages extending from his shoulder blades ending in a oval shaped pad, laced with glowing hair like threads, each tipped with a glowing yellow tip.<br />
<br />
His neck was elongated, almost reptile like, as well as his feline head appearing flatter, more arrow shaped his ears longer and pointing backward, following the flat shape of the top of his head, his eyes were now a solid yellow, however his muzzle retained that feline look to it, his fangs appearing sharper and the two fangs in his top jaw now so long that they escaped his jaw flaps and stretched down to his chin, his whiskers looking slightly longer on his muzzle, his appearance was pure nightmare fuel.<br />
<br />
His front legs had turned into arms, his paws now strong hands with each finger tipped with a long black claw, clenching his palms into fist and then releasing them, getting used to the feel of each limb, his tentacle like appendages twitching and flicking, before he was able to raise them straight up, supprised when they unexpectedly launched forward, extending far beyond the length they were originally, the pads clasping onto a nearby fallen tree among the rubble, Antonio grinned as he lifted the tree without any effort before he reeled the appendages back and threw the tree like a spear, imbedding it into the craters wall.<br />
&quot;Interesting&quot; he grinned before launching his tentacles to the craters edge and launched himself into the air, landing on the rim of the destruction.<br />
<br />
&quot;Very interesting indeed&quot; he said before activating his Chronivac skill, willing a pair of loose fitting trousers onto his body, lacking in fur he now needed something to cover himself from the elements, fabric bindings appearing around the shins and waist of the clothing, both form fitting and fireproof<br />
&quot;Thank fuck for that, I thought my pants were gonna go up in flames&quot; he said with a chuckle before the same bindings appeared around his forearms and midsection, upon his clothing finishing it&#39;s formation he began walking back towards camp.<br />
___________________________________________________<br />
When Antonio broke through the treeline he looked on in supprise to see the three demon women slithering, floating and waddling as fast as they could to disassemble the campsite, Lilith now wearing a simple cloth binding over her milky tits, and a long piece of burlap cloth as a ankle length free flowing skirt resting below her pregnant middle, resting atop her hips, then she turned and looked at Antonio, her eyes going wide and her jaw going slack, her purple cheeks now streaking with tears before she dropped the bundled tent at her feet and lifted her skirt and charged across the river with surprising athletic grace before throwing herself into Antonio&#39;s body, wrapping her arms around his new muscular form and began wailing and bawling into his chest.<br />
<br />
&quot;You asshole!&quot; She bawled, slamming her fist into his chest &quot;you knock me and Heleli up and then charge off against a Disciple of the crown, a warrior that none have walked away from alive without a second thought&quot; she then looked up at his face, bringing her hand to caress his new face &quot;we thought you were dead, and these fucking hormones didn&#39;t help&quot; she whimpered, caressing over her pregnant belly.<br />
Antonio was then greeted by another much smaller hormonal mess of a succubus, grabbing onto his shoulder and practically screaming into his skin &quot;you feline bastard, you can&#39;t do that to us!&quot; She cried, poor Antonio was overwhelmed, the last time he had people who cared about him this much are no longer with him, holding out a palm staring at the two tails that rest in his clutches, gripping them tight and wrapped his arms around Lilith, one of his tendrils encircling Heleli, the pad caressing her bloated womb and face, upon releasing them Antonio realised tears had begun to fall from his amber eyes, feeling them both wipe his boiling tears before showing them the remains of his pack females to them both &quot;before we go, it would help if you assist me with something important&quot;.<br />
___________________________________________________<br />
Antonio stared down at the mound of earth at his feet, Helen stepped forward holding a slab of stone, Antonio grasped it in his tendrils, bot even breaking eye contact with the mound as he lifted the stone and drove it with force into the earth above the mound of dirt, the names Luna and Kiki engraved on its surface, the head of a fox and wolf carved above both names<br />
&quot;Thank you, both of you, you gave me so much, helped me make a paradise, however short it was, and we&#39;re ready to bring my litter into the world, I will never forget you&quot; he choked out, before kissing his finger tips and pressed them into the stone, Lilith, Heleli and Helen then each lay out various flowers in front of the stone before the group turned and watched as Helen opened another portal in front of them, Antonio being the first to step forward &quot;take me home, it&#39;s time to rebuild from the ashes of destruction&quot; he said to her, a newfound determination in his voice as he marched into the spiral of dust and smoke<br />
