<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Molly and I followed Frank Rhoer and Albert Ames as they led us around Michael York's home and to the location where the branding of the cattle Albert Ames had won at the auction of Ebenezer Smith's property and then sold to me was to take place. I do not think that Molly or I looked all that cheerful about it, and I would have preferred a few more hours of sleep... but Albert Ames was insistent on showing the branding off to Molly and I, and he wouldn't take no for an answer. So we went along for the &quot;adventure&quot; of it.<br />
<br />
&quot;You two will love it when it's all done,&quot; Albert Ames said confidently, &quot;the head of a tiger on the flank of four cows and a bull and everyone will know who owns these animals.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sure, sir,&quot; Molly said slowly, &quot;but George and I aren't ranchers. We're only doing this to help my Uncle. Make sure he doesn't lose work because Beauregard went off the deep end.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Albert Ames nodded, &quot;your husband here has said that, and your Uncle has also said that... and I got no real problem with it, I guess. Your Uncle is family, so it's something you have to do... and he's promised not do what Beauregard did, and since that greedy... man... is gone, I suppose it only proper that your Uncle be given a second chance.&quot;<br />
<br />
Frank Rhoer glanced back for a moment and sighed heavily. It was clear that he didn't like being judged for the work he had done for Beauregard in the past, even if he disagreed with his previous employer on things. I decided not to argue on the matter of Frank Rhoer's previous work history. To me it wasn't worth it. Molly continued on the original conversation.<br />
<br />
&quot;George and I thank you for understanding our care for my Uncle and his family,&quot; Molly continued, &quot;but if you understand that we aren't ranchers... why think that we need to see them be branded? It isn't going to make us want to be ranchers.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A lot of it is tradition, I suppose,&quot; Albert Ames said with a shrug, &quot;every owner is traditionally there for the branding of his or her cattle, regardless of whether their herd is outlandishly large the way Beauregard's was, or extremely small the way yours is... and while you and your husband may not be involved in the actual running and caring for the animals... as the owners, you are involved in the ranching industry. And there is nothing to be afraid of or depressed at. Ranching is fine work to be connected to...&quot;<br />
<br />
He then paused for a moment and looked back at Molly and I.<br />
<br />
&quot;And you can take pride in it,&quot; he continued, &quot;think of it this way, if the four cows you now own halve calves who grow up to be good providers of meat, you'll be feeding not just the two of you, but a vast portion of the American west will be buying meat that you raised and owned.&quot;<br />
<br />
It was at that point that Molly gave up arguing to allow us to get back to bed. It was clear that was a battle that would not be won. Although their conversation did leave a little opening for where I thought I could make a small joke.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe so, Mr. Ames, but with Molly an my appetites for meat, I'm afraid that even if Frank Rhoer and his family with the cattle, and Molly and I through some trick of fate bought the meat that had come from them... it wouldn't last us all that long. It'd be eaten rather quickly.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll take your word on it,&quot; Albert Ames replied with a friendly smile, &quot;I'm no real nutritionist, so I can't tell you how much meat you two have to eat daily... though I do get curious. I mean you were both human... can you still eat anything besides meat?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Some dairy and poultry products... eggs and the like,&quot; Molly answered, &quot;just about everything else makes us sick.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Seems like you two have been through more then Beauregard's lunacy,&quot; Albert Ames commented as we continued on.<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
We then proceeded on to the area where the branding was to take place. As earlier informed, Meredeth and Nessie had built a makeshift gate fence that would lead the cattle to a more permanent gate system that looked like it was designed for a rodeo more then ranching. But neither Molly nor I were good with anything like this, so we were left to ask what it was in.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, what is all this?&quot; I asked when my curiosity could be contained no longer.<br />
<br />
&quot;This the chute system I normally use to weigh my cattle,&quot; came Michael York's voice as the elderly man came around one edge of the chute system. He then pointed to one set of pastures to the west of where we were, &quot;When I move them from the western pastures to the eastern pastures, I bring them through these chutes so that I can weigh and check them for anything that might be wrong. It's the only place where you'll be able to put your brand on the cattle that Albert gave you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sold,&quot; I answered, &quot;I felt I had to pay for them... I don't want to feel like I'm some leech draining you of your generosity.&quot;<br />
<br />
The man gave a kind, fatherly smile, &quot;You two were raised well...anyway, as I was sayin' this is the only place you can brand the cattle. Unless you and Molly want to hold them down...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, if we do it that way, we'll end up eating them on the spot,&quot; Molly admitted, &quot;instinctive urge between predator and prey.&quot;<br />
<br />
Michael York nodded, &quot;I understand. So, Albert, do you have the brand?&quot;<br />
<br />
Albert Ames held it up with a smile. He was clearly proud of the work he had done on it, and I could agree that it looked good. While Michael York and Albert Ames looked over the freshly made branding iron, Frank Rhoer went over toward the corner that Michael York had come around. Molly and I slowly followed as we were curious as to were Meredeth and Nessie Rhoer were, as we hadn't seen them yet.<br />
<br />
&quot;How is the fire coming?&quot; Frank Rhoer asked as he came around the corner.<br />
<br />
We followed to find both of Frank Rhoer's daughters manning a &quot;campfire&quot; that was set up near the side of the last part of the gates and chutes that Michael York had set up. They had made a small rock wall around the fire and added some dirt around it to make sure that the fire wouldn't spread... though with as wet as everything seemed to be thanks to melting snow, I didn't know how necessary that all was... but a lot of this operation was new to Molly and I, and what they were doing seemed to be the safe thing to do with regards to fire.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's looking good,&quot; Meredeth answered, &quot;I think we're ready for the brand.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good,&quot; Frank Rhoer nodded, &quot;I'll let Mr. York and Mr. Ames know we're ready.&quot;<br />
<br />
He then hurried around the corner again leaving Molly and I with her cousins.<br />
<br />
&quot;How is your partner doing, George?&quot; Nessie asked calmly after a few moments. Her tone also seemed fairly formal, but I had essentially only just met Molly's cousins and uncle recently, and things were very rough at first because of the nonsense that Beauregard pulled.<br />
<br />
&quot;He's doing better,&quot; I answered, &quot;he's been able to do some desk work at the station, but it'll probably be awhile before he's able to return to patrol duty.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good to hear that he's doing better,&quot; Nessie said with a polite smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;How have you two been doing?&quot; Meredeth asked curiously, &quot;any cubs yet?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What? No!&quot; Molly responded, probably blushing, though you wouldn't see it through her fur, &quot;George and I have decided to wait a bit before starting a family. Try and let things settle down.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah,&quot; Meredeth responded as Frank Rhoer, Albert Ames, and Michael York returned to the area.<br />
<br />
&quot;And the fire is ready,&quot; Albert Ames nodded with a smile. He then placed the part of the brand that would essentially burn the mark into the cow's hide in the fire, &quot;and now we wait for the metal to warm up.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We'd best start moving the first cow,&quot; Meredeth said to Nessie, &quot;by the time we get it locked in the last gate, the brand will be close to ready.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nessie nodded and the two women moved off.<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
Waiting for the fire to heat the brand up to where it was at the right temperature took a little longer then I had thought. The metal had to have been heated several times for Albert Ames to form the design and weld the individual pieces together, so I had figured that it would heat rather quickly. It did not. While Molly and I patiently watched as Frank Rhoer tended the fire to make sure the heat was concentrated on the brand, Nessie and Meredeth slowly coaxed one of the cows down the chute and got it into the last chamber. We all then had to wait a little while longer for the brand to heat up to the right temperature.<br />
<br />
It was Albert Ames who picked up the brand.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, here we go,&quot; Albert Ames announced as he picked up the branding iron wearing some fairly heavy gloves.<br />
<br />
He then turned and moved toward the cow in the last chute. It was held in place by the cramped quarters while Meredeth and Nessie manned the gate switches. One locked the chutes behind the cow making sure it couldn't go back, and the other opened up into the eastern pastures that they would be released into to graze and do what cows did.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just for warning, they may scream when the brand touches them,&quot; Albert Ames warned and then pushed the branding iron through a small slot in the chute.<br />
<br />
And the cow did scream. Molly and I heard a very load &quot;moo&quot; echo over the hiss of the brand making contact with the cow's flank. We could smell something that smelled like it was burning as well, which was obvious when you stop to think about the process of branding. After a few short moments, Albert Ames removed the brand from the chute and carefully put it back on the fire to reheat. At the same time Nessie opened the gate that released the cow into the pasture. It moved off as fast as its legs could carry it, the mark of the head of a tiger burned onto its flank standing out clearly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Will it be alright?&quot; Molly asked after a moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;It'll heal, if that's what you mean,&quot; Albert Ames replied, &quot;It's how we've done branding for years.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's the way everyone has branded cattle,&quot; Michael York corrected, &quot;granted it's usually only done with calves, but that is a handling issue. George and Molly here are probably the only people that could hold down an adult cow and keep it from struggling.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;True, true,&quot; Albert Ames nodded, &quot;so what did you think? This truly marks that cow as yours now. And the same will be done with the other three cows and the bull.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Molly and I have probably learned some things,&quot; I shrugged, &quot;but we still aren't ranchers... I guess we can not get all that excited about this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Take pride in it,&quot; Albert Ames answered as Nessie and Meredeth brought the next cow into the chute, &quot;you and your wife, Mr. Wayne, have done much to save this town... in ways you may not realize...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Removing Beauregard was done because he broke the law,&quot; I answered, &quot;I didn't help arrest him because he was a jerk.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course,&quot; Michael York spoke up, &quot;and if he hadn't broken the law and you arrested him... that might have won him more support... but the fact remains that his activity was geared to gaining control over the town and the ranches around it... not ruling like some medieval monarch, mind you, but having enough influence that those who do have political power listen to him...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;All the same, I'm not in it for political game,&quot; I responded, &quot;Molly an I are here to live... in the hopes that we can live freely and have the space to be free.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;George,&quot; Michael York smiled, &quot;that is what EVERY man wants.&quot;</p>
