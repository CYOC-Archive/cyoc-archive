<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Carl decided to scratch Slide behind the ears and the otter-man began to grunt happily.  Immediately, Filp began to nuzzle at Carl’s other hand and Carl chuckled as he started scratching behind Flip’s ears, too.  Flip grunted just as happily.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, Slide began to nuzzle and kiss Carl’s balls.<br />
<br />
Carl began to object, but it felt so good.  His cock became painfully stiff.  His heart was racing and his breathing became fast and heavy.<br />
<br />
“Oh fuck!” Carl said.  He didn’t use such language except in extreme situations, but this was an extreme situation; Carl had just shot a huge creamy load all over his chest and belly. <br />
<br />
“Is fuck like fudge?”  Flip said.<br />
<br />
Carl laughed, “No, fuck is better than fudge.” <br />
<br />
Carl lay back and before he could stop the otter, Flip began to lick up Carl’s come.  The tickling of the whiskers and the warmth of the tongue made Carl start giggling.  Occasionally, Flip would gently nip one of Carl’s nipples and it would send a shock of pleasure through the young man’s body.  <br />
<br />
Soon Carl was laughing uncontrollably but not from the tickling; Carl was laughing because his first orgasm with another being had been with these delightful little creatures.  He felt so good he wanted to share his happiness with them.<br />
<br />
Slide said, “See, this game is a lot of fun, isn’t it?”<br />
<br />
Carl smiled and said, “Yes, a lot of fun.”  Lie down next to me and I’ll play it with you.<br />
<br />
Slide was almost beside himself with glee.  He quickly lay down and Carl positioned himself with his cock hanging down over Slide’s face.  Slide was quick to take Carl into his muzzle and Carl gasped at the sudden warmth.  It felt so good!  <br />
<br />
“One good turn deserves another!”  Carl thought and sucked the otter’s cock into his mouth.<br />
<br />
Flip, feeling a little left out; began to rub his cock in Carl’s crack.  Carl was only slightly surprised and only a little alarmed at this.  As he sucked on Slide, he realized that if he was in for a penny, he was in for a pound and then laughed around the cock in his mouth at the next thought, “In for a penny: in for a pounding.”<br />
<br />
The laughing caused the little otter-man to moan on Carl’s cock; which, in turn, gave Carl quite a wonderful feeling.<br />
<br />
Flip thoroughly lubricated Carl’s asshole and climbed up on top of him.  Flip rubbed his furry belly against Carl’s back as he positioned himself.  With only a couple of misses, Flip entered Carl and began humping the young man.<br />
<br />
It hurt, but no worse than the time the doctor stuck his gloved finger up his ass and told him to turn his head and cough.  Carl needed to get that examination when he tried out for football.  Carl remembered that he’d been accepted, but sat on the bench the entire season; what a waste of time!<br />
<br />
Within minutes the two otters came inside of Carl and Carl tasted Slide’s come.  It was odd, it tasted sweet and just a little fishy, but he expected this was due to what Flip and Slide lived on.  Carl felt the warmth from Flip’s sperm in his guts.  <br />
<br />
Flip dismounted and Slide and Carl separated.<br />
<br />
“Wasn’t that a lot of fun?”  Slide asked.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, wasn’t that fun?  It’s such a good game, I wish I could play it all the time!”  Flip said.<br />
<br />
Carl yawned.  “Yeah, that was a good game.”<br />
<br />
“Wanna play it again?”  Slide said excitedly.<br />
<br />
Carl chuckled.  These two were horny little fellows.  The moon was high overhead and Carl shivered.  He didn’t have the benefit of a nice thick fur pelt.<br />
<br />
“Why do you shake like that?”  Flip asked.<br />
<br />
“‘Cause I’m cold.”  Carl answered.  “I’m also a bit sleepy.”<br />
<br />
“Well, lie back on the grass and we’ll snuggle up to you to keep you warm.”  Slide said.<br />
<br />
Carl though that was an excellent idea.<br />
<br />
Flip snuggled up to Carl’s front, wrapping his stubby little arms and legs around the young man.  He looked Carl in the eyes and kissed him on the nose.<br />
<br />
Carl hugged Flip to him and closed his eyes.<br />
<br />
Slide snuggled up to Carl with his front against Carl’s back; they were spooning.  He kissed Carl on the back of the neck and wrapped his stubby arms and legs around Carl and nestled his cock in Carl’s ass crack.  He whispered in Carl’s ear, “Good night, we’ll play more when we all wake up.”<br />
<br />
Sleepily, Carl said, “G’night Slide.”  Carl began to drift off.  It had been a long day, a long strange day with a pleasant, but strange, end.<br />
<br />
Carl felt the warmth in his guts spreading through his body and the warmth from the otters surrounding him.  For some reason, he was more warm and content than he’d ever been in his life.  He’d done something for once, just for fun and just for pleasure.  He’d been impulsive and committed a ‘taboo’.  He smiled at that, soon Carl was fast asleep.<br />
<br />
As he slept, his erection grew again and fur began to sprout on his body.  The young man’s body was drenched in sweat.  Carl’s face began to grow a beard and his body was growing hairy; his new human hair, in turn, was beginning to be engulfed in otter fur and to Carl’s sleeping mind, he’d just been covered in a light blanket.  Carl shifted position in his sleep to be more comfortable; his otter tail had begun to grown from the base of his spine and it was bothering him in his sleep.  Carl’s hands started becoming clawed and webbed and furry and his arms and legs started becoming slightly shorter as the metamorphosis progressed.  His torso, however, was beginning to elongate slightly.  His human teeth were falling out to be replaced by fangs and sharp molars; teeth suited to eating raw fish.  His newly bearded face sprouted whiskers on the growing muzzle and his nose was turning black.  Fur began to overtake his new beard.  Carl stirred in his sleep, spitting out the human teeth, but what he dreamt were rocks in his mouth.<br />
<br />
Carl woke suddenly with an incredible need to fuck.  He woke Flip with a couple of kisses and his searching cock found Flip’s asshole.  Without much thought, Carl pushed his changing dick into Flip and Flip grunted.  Carl didn’t seem to notice that he’d changed dramatically in the last twenty minutes or so.  All three were awake now and ready to start playing again.</p>
