<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">My protests melted in my mouth, as I began to feel it contract with a new set of lips. Kay’s eyes did something similar, expanding with her smile as she murmured, “Is this for real right now?”<br />
<br />
I nodded, leaning into the sofa. <br />
<br />
My body was overwhelmed with a muscular exhaustion, combined with a tingling pleasure, like sexual arousal merging with vertigo. An unseen force slid over and constricted my body, pushing the air out of my lungs and inflaming my skin for a brief flash, vapourizing my body hair. My hands steadied me against the sofa, my mind trance-like as it attempted to steady, subjected to the forces of my transformation. <br />
<br />
Kay was excited. She was asking something desperate as she set up her camera on the coffee table. I could barely hear her though, nor see her, her shadow fading from my vision, seeing her with my old eyes for the last time.<br />
<br />
The first changes were in my bones, which warped like clay. A blossoming sensation flowing out from the centre of my body, my hips flaring out as the rest retreated away. Even my skull was reshaping, moving out of the way of my expanding eyes, which had the odd effect of warping my blurred vision, and making my ears pop. It was all too much, leading to a groan vibrating unheard through my teeth, expanding out as my whole jaw drew in.<br />
<br />
The shirt came off without me noticing, too distracted by the shifting of gravity itself, my fat fat receding into my expanding muscle mass. By the time I realized what was going on a blurry Kay was pushing me over, orientating me so I was lying on the sofa, peeling off my pants and boxers as my fleshing hips expanded into them with a jiggle. “Good jeans” was the only word I could make out, between the muffled cackles. She was right too, they were good jeans, which made it sting when I watched them begin to change too, becoming a black mass. Kay tossed them, getting as close as she dared, her cool hand on my shoulder. <br />
<br />
“Nearly there,” she said, a note of worry in the obscured voice. <br />
<br />
I looked at her with a reassuring smile, but caught myself as something new grasped my cock, an undulating pleasure flowing over it. It was spine-twistingly overpowering. My hearing was returning and I was starting to hear my muffled moaning, and Kay’s stifled laughter, her eyes glancing between my eyes and my cock. She lifted my head down, drawing my vision to my body, struggling through the arousing pleasure to see it for the first time. I was breastless but femmenine, hairless and smooth, a classical statue with just the hint of muscle tone, a cock right in the middle of it. It was the darkest thing left on my body, the rest of my skin turning a flawless white, and it was currently jumping up and down like it was trying to escape.<br />
<br />
It felt like it was trapped in a cluster of small liquid-filled balloons, gradually getting tighter as they rubbed faster. I was starting to churn and writhe with the pleasure, closing my eyes, my mouth gasping androgynous grunts. With my last act as a man I grabbed Kay’s hand, gasping her name as I came dry, opening my eyes and watching the force push my cock back into my body. <br />
<br />
My little guy shrank away, my balls pulled into my body itself, drawing into me as a new feeling started to pulse within me. At this point Kay was by my legs, her hand holding mine apart, filming the chang. She watched as my sack flattened, smoothed and shaped, a crease expanding down with a dainty tingle, pushing down from my dick nub - now a clit - until it reached my perineum. What she couldn’t see was the interior, which was churning over and over, a softness reaching to the surface, as my labia took shape. The folds settled, and I felt them dive inwards, my vagina emerging with wet orgasmic release. <br />
<br />
“Fuck.” I said. “Oh shitty fuck.”<br />
<br />
My voice had a soft timber to it now, but still felt very much mine.<br />
<br />
“That good?” She said, gently patting on my hips. “Can you hear me now?”<br />
<br />
I nodded, flipping my freehand at her trying to pull her closer. She vanished from sight again as a black mass covered my vision, but she quickly pushed my new hair away. When my vision settled again I was looking at her holding some of my hair, puzzled, as my bangs settled on my forehead. I flipped my hand again, and while she took both of them she stayed back.<br />
<br />
“One last change,” she chirped, looking into the viewfinder. “Get ready, big girl.”<br />
<br />
My breasts started as mere mounds, my nipples on the lower centre mass, glowing with arousal, my areola pushing across as they began to rise. I was smiling, grasping her hands as I tried to breathe calmly, aware of every breath. She soon vanished from sight behind a wall of white, as my breast got big enough to touch each other, my arms holding them into cleavage. As I let Kayla go they spilled out, jiggling to either side of my chest, but still expanding outwards.<br />
<br />
“Babe?” I squeaked.<br />
<br />
“Ho, shit,” she replied.<br />
<br />
They kept going, kept expanding, getting heavier and heavier, until they consumed the top half of my body, constricting my breathing. When they finally came to a stop they were spilling out everywhere, so large they consumed the top half of my torso<br />
<br />
Between the V on my cleavage Kay was smiling up at me, rising above me. She helped me to a sitting position, by breasts resisting the rise and then pulling me forwards. She put one of the photos we had framed into my hand, one that handily contained a picture of the old me ebtracing her, and had a mirrored frame to see the new me.<br />
<br />
I was a ghost in black lipstick, winged eyeliner accentuating my eyes. My distinct nose and prominent chin were gone, replaced with a long nose and slender chin, new dimples emerging as I moved my puffy lips. I tried to test the lippy, as well as the solid blackness on my nails, scratinging at it with my teeth, but the wound in the layer smoothed back over before my eyes.<br />
<br />
“Sorry,” Kay said resting her head against mine. “If I would have known this was the default ‘big tiddy goth GF’ I would have made some adjustments. Especially with these”<br />
<br />
She gave one of my breasts a shake, patting underneath it. I blinked as I stared at it through the mirror, hypnotized. They were phenomenal, and every time I looked at them I got a happy lil pulse in my pussy.<br />
<br />
“So what do we do now?” I said, as Kay began to groom me. “We could sell that Chronivac for a small ransom.”<br />
<br />
“Or…” Kay said, levelling my head to adjust my hair better.<br />
<br />
“Or…” I continued, beginning to grin.</p>
