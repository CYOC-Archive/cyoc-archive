<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The zoo was situated on plot of land on which a river ran through in a Y fork. Being semi aquatic, the two big and muscled crocodiles were now even more suited to the task of spiking the zoo’s water supply more of the transformative fluid. This was because the only way to do so was to reach the city piping that ran underneath the two separate river beds.<br />
<br />
&quot;I’ll see you soon.&quot; Gretta kissed her new mate. &quot;Be careful.&quot;<br />
<br />
Floating in seclusion at the start of the fork, each of the scaly giants held a sealed container with the pink &quot;water&quot; inside. They would have to split up and deliver each container to the water system in order to keep it from being washed out the drain.<br />
<br />
Though he didn’t want to, Fred broke off from Gretta and plunged under the cool river water towards the left fork. Gretta did the same on the right.<br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
The cobra lady and her reptilian kin had stepped out from the reptile house into the zoo. For most of them, it was the first time they had ever seen anything outside. Yet this was not something to enjoy right now. They had gone into hiding around the grounds. Well, most of them. The giant Komodo Dragon was quite happy to stay inside lest her giant form attract attention.<br />
<br />
It was starting to turn from late afternoon to the early evening. The zoo grounds, at the order of the now dehumanized and voiceless administrator, had been emptied of guests and staff. Only the armed game keepers remained patrolling the park.<br />
<br />
They were terribly outnumbered and outfoxed before anything even happened.<br />
<br />
Boss quietly started her revolution by locating Gustav. As the most experienced and well armed game warden, he presented the biggest threat. It didn’t take long for one of the smaller lizards to find him locked away in the indoor cafe with Sandra the former employee turned tiny anole woman.<br />
<br />
The other four - one human female and three men - were split between the mammal side of the exhibits and keeping a watchful eye on the reptile house as they passed by on a regular patrol. This also made their movement very predictable.<br />
<br />
Presently, the cobra lady was focused on getting close to Gustav with the remote. She hadn’t managed to scan him during their initial tense encounter. That was about to rectified.<br />
<br />
With the administrator&#39;s keys she now had access to every building, every gate, and every door in the zoo. The question was how to approach this particular situation. With a sly grin, the clever cobra woman had an idea. She quickly made her way back to the reptile house and entered the janitor&#39;s room again. There, on the chair, was the administrator&#39;s discarded clothing. She looked around the floor and saw no sign of the helpless garter snake.<br />
<br />
With a huge sigh, she resigned herself to taking on the old balding human&#39;s form. Her sleek and powerful snake body was placed into the &quot;backup&quot; folder that Todd had made. With a few instructions, she hit the button on the remote and staggered slightly, gasping as she shrank, morphed, and fattened. His skin faded to flesh, her snout shrank away, teeth grew in her mouth, her genitals began to tug and change into a man.<br />
<br />
Where moments ago there had been a tall and lovely cobra woman, now there was a bald naked middle aged man. Boss stared at herself in disgusted curiosity and fingered the limp dick hanging from her front. She felt unnaturally gross. But, this would work well. She quickly dressed in the human&#39;s clothes, which felt positively vile, and cleaned herself up. Himself? It was something she didn&#39;t want to think about.<br />
<br />
Once &quot;disguised&quot; she placed the remote in her suit pocket and quickly found one of the male guards. She felt the sensation of one of her comrades staring at her in alarm, but ignored it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can you radio Gustav for his location, please?&quot; It had to look somewhat convincing. She was getting used to playing the role. She cringed internally at her own voice.<br />
<br />
A quick exchange later the former cobra turned human approached the restaurant again. The sinister game warden was waiting by the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now out here. We need privacy.&quot; Boss said urgently, trying to mimic some sort of desperation in her (or his) voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;All right.&quot; The warden shrugged.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now, listen here!&quot; Boss was getting into her role. &quot;This whole thing defies description. We need to get this nonsense cleaned up and quickly.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I agree, sir.&quot; Gustav chuckled. They both stared at the tiny anole woman sitting on one of the wooden tables and internally the cobra felt a pang of guilt as she saw her helpless crestfallen expression. She had another idea forming that might help them out in the long run.<br />
<br />
&quot;I have a plan.&quot; The mock administrator said authoritively. &quot;It&#39;s very simple. I want you to gather your people, load up on bullets, and we&#39;re ending this right here and right now. These freakish mutants need to be destroyed. That&#39;s the easiest way.&quot;<br />
<br />
This startled the game warden and he seemed genuinely taken aback. &quot;With respect, sir, the whole point of letting somebody else do it was to avoid all the nastiness that comes after. I mean, we now have the police and the law debating what the hell to do with these things. Surely...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Were you in the room with me?&quot; Boss snapped, really enjoying the ego trip and sense of power.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh... no.&quot; Gustav said with a resigned understanding.<br />
<br />
&quot;They can debate all they want.&quot; She said with a raised finger in the air. &quot;There will soon be nothing to talk about.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;All right.&quot; Gustav sighed. &quot;If that&#39;s the way this is going down, I guess I&#39;ll round up the other guys.&quot;<br />
<br />
Boss took careful note of his reluctance to engage in blood thristy murder of sentient beings. Not a bad guy. Just muscle following orders. She had no intention to hurt him now. He could be extremely useful to all of the animals as something more.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, what are you waiting for? Go! Don&#39;t do a damn thing until you get my final order.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes... fine.&quot; Gustav signed grumpily. &quot;I do so under protest.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t pay you to think!&quot; The Administrator/snake bellowed.<br />
<br />
This caught the game warden&#39;s sneer as he exited the restaurant with his rifle.<br />
<br />
This left the administrator and green anole. She stared in horror from the table and stood quickly, scrambling to her clawed feet and cradling herself in an oversized t-shirt. &quot;P-Please! Don&#39;t hurt me!&quot;<br />
<br />
The administrator sighed and to the lizard&#39;s horror he began to undress.<br />
<br />
&quot;My God! What are you...&quot;<br />
<br />
Boss removed the remote from her pocket, scanned herself in, and changed herself back into herself. The anole stared in sudden realization and awe and the big tall cobra lady emerged from the human she had been playing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh.&quot; The lizard said sharply, trembling in terror.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;sss better.&quot; The snake said in relief. &quot;Now, then, misssss. I think we sssshould have a chat.&quot;</p>
