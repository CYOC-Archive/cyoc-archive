<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The Lotus Foot program was never meant to be a long-lived one. The practice of foot-binding has been outlawed long enough ago that any living women who were subjected to it were very few and far in between. Not that the People&#39;s Republic of China didn&#39;t make the effort. They combed through China&#39;s very, very, very extensive population. As far as they have been able to tell, the horse Animalian calling herself Ria was the very last one. Any other living women would have to be living in an extremely remote area. As far as the People&#39;s Republic was concerned, their objective was complete.<br />
<br />
Though that didn&#39;t stop a few other problems. Ria and the other last woman with bound feet, Dixie, were not behaving in the respectful way most people would expect the elderly to live. It would seem the RHS effect was quite effective on Chinese women as it was American women. The way they were behaving was rather embarrassing for anyone would wanted to keep an honorable image of their elders. It was also causing other senior citizens of China to want to undergo conversion and could leave to a massive decay in moral fiber.<br />
<br />
There were also some concerns about the BARA and ROSE Houses. Homosexuality is still a hot-button topic in China, even in more progressive times. There were still some ultra-conservatives who thought of the Animalian virus as the cure for homosexuality, but they&#39;re mostly ignored. But having two Animalian groups openly endorsing the same-sex lifestyle was of some concern to some, even if didn&#39;t necessarily mean the members of either group didn&#39;t have relations with the opposite sex. Though the ROSE House being able to convert men completely into females may worry some. Others saw it as an escape.<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
Ping was aware that he was giving up most of his life by joining Animalia&#39;s ROSE House, but then he didn&#39;t think he had much of a life to give up. He was one of dozens of faceless salarymen working in middle class with little chance of promotion. He also didn&#39;t feel right with the gender he was born with, but such behavior would only have gotten him scorn and drive him further down the corporate ladder than he was. So he didn&#39;t feel like he had anything to lose.<br />
<br />
When Ping got to Ao Guang Island, he was intrigued by a special offer. It seems whiptails aren&#39;t the only species of female-only lizards. The mourning gecko also reproduces by parthenogenesis and one has already been uplifted. If he could help show that geckos were capable of doing the same kind of sex transformation as whiptails, the whole procedure would be free. Ping hadn&#39;t particularly cared about the kind of lizard he&#39;d become, so this sounds like a great opportunity for him.<br />
<br />
Ping was a bit surprised to be lead into the changing room and find the uplifted gecko already waiting for him. She was wearing a bathrobe and nothing else. &quot;I, uh, wasn&#39;t expecting something so intimate, Miss...&quot; started Ping.<br />
<br />
&quot;Roimata,&quot; said the gecko, &quot;And Sappho met her mate this way. I was hoping the same for me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mate? But you don&#39;t even know me,&quot; said Ping.<br />
<br />
&quot;How much about you do you want me to know?&quot; asked Roimata.<br />
<br />
Ping thought it over and said, &quot;Well, not really much that&#39;s going to matter. I came here to make a fresh change, to start a new life with the gender I should have had.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then this can be a new beginning for us both,&quot; said Roimata before opening her robe and cradling one breast, &quot;And it starts right here.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ping might have been a bit too shy to suck a woman&#39;s breast if he wasn&#39;t so eager for the change. There was a tingle through his mouth as he sucked on her nipple. The tingle quickly spread over his face as he broke out in scales. There was a very strong itch that made him stop and scratch his upper lip. A small shower of hair followed as his small mustache completely fell off. Ping felt his scalier face and said, &quot;I was not expecting that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You look better without it,&quot; said Roimata. She pulled Ping&#39;s face to her own and started kissing him. The kissing was a bit awkward considering their different facial structures, but then Ping&#39;s face started to expand out into a reptilian muzzle, his eyes getting much larger. The changes spread as the scales extended down his neck. His frame compacted to a more feminine build as estrogen flooded his body. Roimata helped Ping remove his shirt, which was starting to rub his nipples wrong. Not long after that, the flesh around his nipples ballooned out into a pair of functional breasts of a very appealing size. Ping&#39;s hands and feet tingled as his hands developed the distinct wall-crawling pads and his feet turned fully into gecko feet. Roimata pulled off Ping&#39;s pants to allow his tail to fully grow out, which also allowed his hips and ass to swell out to a sexy shape. Finally, his penis and testicles were pulled inside, leaving behind a slit that became more functional as a womb developed within.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not bad, not bad at all,&quot; said Roimata, looking the new gecko over.<br />
<br />
The new gecko looked at herself in the mirror. She looked quite a bit like Roimata, only she still had hair. It hadn&#39;t really gotten longer, but it wasn&#39;t a bad look. &quot;I guess I can&#39;t call myself Ping now,&quot; she said in her new dulcet voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is that not a girl&#39;s name?&quot; asked Roimata.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, it can be, but I&#39;d rather have a new name for this new life,&quot; said the new gecko, &quot;How about Pekoe?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Pekoe the gecko, I love it,&quot; said Roimata before getting close enough for their breasts to touch, &quot;And I think I could love the rest of you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Really?&quot; asked Pekoe before letting out a moan as Roimata latched onto her breasts. Roimata&#39;s hands went to both the other breast and Pekoe&#39;s new slit. Unused to such intense concentrations of pleasure, it didn&#39;t take Pekoe particularly long to climax. &quot;Was I...too soon?&quot; she asked panting.<br />
<br />
&quot;You still need to get adjusted to your new body,&quot; said Roimata, &quot;And I&#39;m going to help you with that most intimately.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That sounds...good...&quot; said Pekoe. She could feel tears of joys trembling at the edge of her eyes. Then her tongue reached up and licked one of them. &quot;Gah!&quot; yelped Pekoe, a little shocked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yeah, that&#39;s something to get used to as well,&quot; said Roimata, &quot;We have eyelids so we don&#39;t need to lick them. But sometimes we react anyways.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, yeah,&quot; said Pekoe, rubbing her other eye. Being a gecko was going to take more to get used to than being a woman.</p>
