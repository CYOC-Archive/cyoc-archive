<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Katie was surprised to hear her mother want more proof. After all she&#39;d just seen her grow up one more year. What she didn&#39;t know was that her mother was excited by the change. She wanted to learn more about the ring and use it for herself. Unlike Katie, who was still a kid and innocent, Kellie wanted to be young and beautiful in her own selfish way.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay Mommy,&quot; She said. &quot;I wish Mommy was twenty-five years old.&quot;<br />
<br />
And with that, Kellie began to change slightly as her features freshened up. She was getting younger, but not too much younger... only two years were shaved off. Katie thought about it for a bit and figured out the problem. &quot;I wish my mom had three years of my youth?&quot; She felt a tingle as her body stretched out.<br />
<br />
Kellie watched, spellbound as her 9 year old daughter began to mature. Her arms and legs came first, growing out, long and gangly like the legs of a colt. Her fingers and toes became thinner, more distinct and dainty as the nails themselves became painted pink polish. She giggled and swung her legs and watched with fascination as her toes drifted further and further to the floor of the carpet, until the balls of her feet touched...then the flats, then the heels. She sighed in elation and realization that she was growing up, finally able to touch her feet to the floor of most places at last, though a part of her somehow wished she could swing her legs at times.<br />
<br />
The coltish appearance stopped there though as she experienced something strange. Her hips began to push out, just a little bit at a time, gaining a slight curve, at the same time her legs and arms gained a distinct tone to them as if she&#39;d spent every day running, playing and moving. Her stomach gurgled as it also flattened and toned nicely, and she could watch the change as it spread along her bare belly and along her belly button, leaving her abdomen neatly pretty like she&#39;d seen girls in sports competitions. <br />
<br />
By now her clothes had stretched beyond their limit and she felt a new strange tingling beneath it. She felt a warmth as within her insides her body began to approach the age of adolescence. She could not see the changes, but she distinctly felt them, letting out a little gasp as new thoughts and understands began to grow in her young preteen mind.<br />
<br />
At the same time her flat tank top would begin to swell with the growth of two small mounds beneath it, the same warmth below filling them as she began to develop...her eyes widening now as she understood what was happening.<br />
<br />
&quot;I’m....entering puberty...&quot;<br />
<br />
The thought excited and terrified her and the changes weren’t done. She could see her face in the rearview mirror as the cute, childlike features began to define. Her button nose was still that, but it was starting to even out. The freckles on her face were less prevalent and her teeth rearranged as some adult ones grew in. She gained a certain maturity, a certain beginning of beauty as her hair began to flow long to her back and around her ears. Kellie&#39;s eyes widened with surprise before looking at her thirty-eight year-old face in the mirror before glaring down at her slightly slimmer. &quot;Katie...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s okay.&quot; Katie smiled back. &quot;It&#39;d be fun to be a grown-up for a while.&quot;<br />
<br />
Silently making her wish, her physique began to grow further outward into that of a fourteen-year-old blossoming into womanhood. Her breasts already expanded to A-cups and she’s already seeing signs of an hourglass figure over her tightening shirt. Hpwever, she could also feel said shirt stretching to the brink as the back was showing rippage around her shoulders. Katie then looked to her face and noticed that it has changed as well, maturing with the rest of her body. Her cheeks looked less puffy and her nose was looking a little long and thin. Her eyes seem less childish and her innocence had become less noticeable. Her hair even grew longer and fuller as is started to look a little wavy. Katie looked on in awe and couldn’t believe she was growing up right before her very eyes. “Wow, really growing up fast here.” she said in a lower voice, “Can I borrow some of your clothes when this is done?” She felt a minor migraine as she could feel her brain growing as well. Years of knowledge are filling her mind, as she was getting smarter by the second. In fact, common knowledge of kindergarten and grade school are easier for her as knowledge of high school entered her head. But that’s not the only thing that is entering her head. Ever since she was five, she always like going outside to play, rather it is hide and seek, ball, or playing tag. But now that she’s growing, her body is becoming predisposed and more athletic. Looking at herself, Katie could tell that her body was a little toned then before as she was gaining both energy and metabolism from the ‘years’ of sports. Her mind was also being filled with memories of the many years she participated in sports including T-ball, soccer, and gymnastics. Thirty-six year old Kellie looked on in disbelief as her daughter was maturing faster then before.<br />
<br />
Entering her teen years, Katie has now entered the threshold of child to adult as she hit the sweet sixteen mark. Her height reached five-foot-seven as her shirt was completely stretched to the limit. Her breasts grew to B-cup size as the seam in the middle of her top of her shirt and grew down the middle, showing a bit of cleavage. Her hips and reach expanded further to create a much curvier hourglass as ripping came to the her waist line and exposed some skin. Her arms and legs gained more feminine muscles as her biceps were bloating and her calves were bulging with years of jogging and push-ups. Her face continued to mature as her lips started to puff out and her nose grew long and thin. She did notice signs of pimples dotting hear and there, but that soon faded to be replaced with smooth flawless skin. Even her hair grew fuller as it went down to her mid back. Her brain kept on filling with high school knowledge as history, math, English, and social studies felt easier for her. But her athletic knowledge continues to dominate more of her brain as memories of her taking on karate, track, and volleyball now entered her mind. The teen watched on and was amazed by how her body has grown and developed.<br />
<br />
Growing to five-foot-ten and closing in on a full six feet, Katie&#39;s growth strained her shirt to the point of breakage, releasing her now C-Cup breasts to the air. Her hourglass figure grew curvier as her hips expanded further and her rear inflated bigger. That expansion caused her pants to break off on the spot, leaving her in the full monty. The muscles on her arms and legs grew thicker and harder and although they are not body builder level, she does show that she was very athletic. Her face left childhood completely as her skin as clear and shiny, her nose was very elegant, her lips puffy and defined, and her eyes looked sultrier and less innocent. Her hair was close to her back and darkened slightly to match with her looks. Her mind matures as well as knowledge and memories were changing incredibly. Most of which involve sports as she now knows how to do the hurdles, light weight training, and yoga to make her feel flexible. At 21 years of age, Katie was amazed to see how grown up she looked. The twenty-nine year old Kellie was blushing at her daughter, likely jealous of her body. But still, that wasn’t enough as she was just about finished with her changes with the ring on her finger.<br />
<br />
Her growth and development continued until she stopped at twenty-five, right as her mother reached that same age. Once the changes are done Katie was stunned at the fact that in front of the mirror was he adult self. In fact, she looked like an exact replica of your young mother but with a few exceptions. Her breasts now grew to D-cups as additional muscles were added to her own physique. Her waist was wide and curvy as she traced her now dainty hands on the barely visible abs on her stomach. Her arms and legs looked muscular, yet at the same time sexy as well to fit her beauty. Speaking of her beauty, her face was beyond beautiful. She had some high cheekbones, plushy and kissable lips, elegant eyes, and a long and thin nose to complete her looks. Her hair was long and full as it goes down to her lower back. So much so, that Katie had to get a piece of her ripped one piece that was handing loose and lifted her hair up, forming it into a pony tail that goes to the middle of her back. Posing a little bit, Katie looked to herself and self, “Mmm… Damn girl, you’ve certainly grown up to be a fine woman.”<br />
<br />
&quot;And this woman is going to get dressed up, right?&quot; asked the twenty-five year old Kellie, struggling to hold her pants up. Katie nodded and rushed to her mother&#39;s bedroom.</p>
