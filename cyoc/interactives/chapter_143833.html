<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kellie had been quite guarded over the past week. Jacks arrival had shaken her greatly, and troubled Merlin more when he learned who his mother was. &quot;This is my fault,&quot; he whispered. &quot;By destroying Morgan we may have unleashed a far worse evil onto the world.&quot;<br />
<br />
Merlin worried the the presence of Lilith, Baba, Circe, and Jack may have grave consequences on not only Kellies world but the other world as well. As he now began to research a way to defeat Lilith and her family, he instructed Kellie to be prepared and above all else keep Jack from journeying to the other timeline. As Kellie now sat in the quad afterschool she pondered what she should do about this latest threat.<br />
<br />
&quot;How bad can this Lilith and Jack be,&quot; Katie asked. Kellie sullenly looked at her friends. Since Jack&#39;s arrival it had been a major topic of conversation. A conversation that Kellie really didn&#39;t want to have. &quot;Bad,&quot; she sighed. &quot;Lilith is the mother of demons. She&#39;s incredibly powerful, maybe more powerful than my dad. That shes teamed up with two other legendary sorceress can only lead to problems.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So what does that mean for Jack,&quot; Lisa asked. Kellie crowned as she now thought of her ex. &quot;Jacks always been an asshole,&quot; she grumbled. &quot;When I knew him the first time I saw it first hand. He maybe handsome and smart but deep down he&#39;s ugly plain and simple.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And yet you not only slept with him you two had a kid,&quot; Mary Elise stated. Kellie sighed. Yes at the time she thought she loved him. That is until she came to terms with not only her sexual orientation but the fact that Jack was not a good person. &quot;Yeah I did,&quot; she sighed. &quot;Part of me is angry about that. I was so uncomfortable in my own skin that I tried convincing myself I loved him. Even though I saw how rotten he was first hand.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sensing a but here,&quot; Kumi added. Kellie gave a small smirk as she glanced at her friend. &quot;Yeah,&quot; she smiled. &quot;You see if I was never with him then I never would of had Katie.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kellie sighed heavily as she once more gazed out onto the school grounds. How could she both loathe Jack as a person and be thankful at the same time. She knew he was a philanderer with a nasty temper but he had given her a daughter. A daughter she loved with every fiber of her being. Turning to face her friends she drowned as she saw Jack exit the school with Lexie, Maaya and Sebastian.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Kellie,&quot; he smirked. &quot;Was hoping to run into you.&quot; Kellie crowned as she watched her friends close ranks around her. Kellies one consolation was that all eight of her friends had her back. They were determined not to let anything bad happen to her, even if it meant that Karen and Mary Elise would have to face off with their old friend Sebastian.<br />
<br />
&quot;Cant believe your hanging around that guy Sebastian,&quot; Mary Elise growled as she looked at her former boyfriend. &quot;Hey Jack&#39;s cool,&quot; Sebastian retorted. &quot;Not my fault you and your friends blame him for something that happened literally a lifetime ago.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So you told him our history,&quot; Kellie said as she glared at Jack. Jack nodded as he gazed at his ex. &quot;Sebastian needed to be told,&quot; he said. &quot;Besides me and him are becoming really good friends. Not my fault Mary ditched him to hangout with you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And what about Lexie and Maaya,&quot; Kellie said pointing to the meek girl and punk rock girl behind Jack. &quot;You tell them as well. Is that why Maaya all the sudden went from wallflower to hot chick.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jack smirked as he looked back at his imp and succubus companions. Liliths spell had alter things so that everyone remembered Maaya as a mousey and meek girl who was friends with a Lexie, a notorious troublemaker. Rex the janitor had been wiped from everyone&#39;s memories much to Jack&#39;s surprise. As he turned towards his friends he gave the two a knowing smile. &quot;Why dont you two show Kellie and her friends the gift I gave you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Maaya and Lexie smiled as they began to shift into their true forms. Maaya&#39;s skin darkened to a dark red as bat like wings sprouted from her back. The girls eyes glowed menacingly as they went from brown to red. Oddly the succubus still wore her glasses, which were now perched upon her nose. Finally her body seemed to fill out incredibly, expanding to full maturity with large d cup breasts and an hourglass figure.<br />
<br />
Lexie (or Rexie as she preferred when she was in this form), appeared to shrink down to child size as her skin darkened while her platinum blond hair turned ghost white. The imp smiled maliciously as her teeth extended into metallic needles while a spade tail and wings sprouted from her back. As she completed her transformation she hovered on the air, her wings beating rhythmically. &quot;Actually when I look like this just call me Rexie,&quot; she giggled.<br />
<br />
Kellies friends had gasped in shock at the transformations as she dully watched. This wasn&#39;t the first imp and succubus she had seen in her life and to be honest it didn&#39;t surprise her that two people would trade their humanity for power. &quot;An imp and a succubus huh,&quot; she said flatly. &quot;Cant say it&#39;s a big surprise. So what does that make Sebastian?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hes human,&quot; Jack said. &quot;But like Mary and Katie for you, I&#39;ve taken him under my wing. Kind of show him what magic is all about.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you want Jack,&quot; Kellie sighed. &quot;Your obviously gathering an army so spill it. I dont have all day.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jack gazed curiously at Kellie, surprised she was unfazed by what he had done. Quickly composing himself he cleared his throat. &quot;Katie,&quot; he said clearly. &quot;I want to see my daughter.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No chance,&quot; Kellie said flatly. &quot;You want to see her, travel to that timeline yourself. Oh wait I forgot. Merlin and Morgan were the only ones that know the spell. Unless they teach you, you cant go. Really sucks for you huh.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jack grit his teeth as he glared at Kellie. &quot;Dont be a bitch,&quot; he growled. &quot;Right now I&#39;m standing here with a warlock in training, an imp, and a succubus. If we attack right now, you know some of your friends won&#39;t survive.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;True,&quot; Kellie said. &quot;But we also both know that if a fight breaks out between us our folks will get involved. Are you so anxious to destroy the world that you would fight me?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jack grunted in frustration as he looked at the smirk on Kellies face. She was right, a magical conflict between their families would destroy the world, something no one wanted. All Jack wanted was to see Katie. He was her father, he had been denied that in their first lifetime. He would not be denied in his second.<br />
<br />
&quot;Damn it Kel,&quot; he yelled. &quot;Look, hate me all you want. I just want to see her okay. You wouldn&#39;t even let me see her in our first lifetime. All I want is a second chance.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;All you want is access to the other timeline,&quot; she countered. &quot;I bring you to Katie&#39;s time and you and your friends can just travel back and forth no problem.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then bring her here,&quot; Jack stated. &quot;Look...I just want a chance okay? You may think I&#39;m some evil thing but I&#39;m not. I&#39;m necessary in this world. Light and dark have to exist for the world to function. That&#39;s something you and your old man cant seem to understand. Now please, let me meet Katie.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kellie sighed, she worried now that by giving Jack what he wanted she would endanger both worlds. She needed to come with an answer soon though as it appeared Jack and his friends were running out of patience.</p>
