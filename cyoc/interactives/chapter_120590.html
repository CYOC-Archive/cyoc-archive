<br/>
Hawk’s Collected Souls:<br/>
Hawk, Rat, Rabbit, Snake, Minotaur, Horse (others unknown).<br/>
</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">‘Come then, bird,’ said Hasib. Hawk swept down and retook his place on Hasib’s shoulder. Hasib set off walking. ‘We are going to to the Holy Mortuary,’ he said, as an afterthought, realising that this bird was his warden. ‘I have a friend there who may be able help us.’<br />
<br />
The Holy Mortuary stood not far east of the pyramid. From the outside, it appeared rather humble. A collection of small buildings were connected by terraces to form a courtyard. However, passing through the main gate revealed that the courtyard was not flat but dug into the earth, with various staircases leading downwards, splitting off and meeting one another, before disappearing under the desert. This was, Hasib knew, the entrance to the catacombs. Presumably, it was these underground chambers that led to the hidden entrance of the Great Pyramid. Legend told the catacombs formed a vast labyrinth, filled with traps to deter grave robbers. For Hasib to even hope at finding his way to the Pyramid, he would need a guide.<br />
<br />
 ‘Effendi?’ said a voice. A priest had emerged to greet Hasib, recognisable by his golden head dress. <br />
‘Ana huna liqa&#39; sidiyq liy,’ said Hasib. ‘Howwa qundulift. Ismuhu Ruh.’<br />
<br />
Speaking in the sphinx’s native tongue, Hasib had told the priest he was here to meet his friend, an acolyte named Ruh. Though he knew this perfectly well, he still felt a pang of surprise once the words left his lips. This, he supposed, was what remained of Louis in him, who had not expected to speak and understand a tongue that was foreign to his ears.<br />
<br />
‘Ruh?’ said the priest. ‘Yes, Ruh is here. But I suspect sir has not visited here in some time.’<br />
‘It is true,’ said Hasib, with a frown. ‘I have been travelling. How did you know?’<br />
The priest gave him a wry smile. ‘All I shall say is, Ruh is no acolyte anymore. Please, follow.’<br />
<br />
He turned and led the way around the perimeter of the courtyard. Hasib felt the bird on his shoulder grow restless, looking about the place warily. The whole conversation had been conducted in the language of the sphinxes and so it did not understand what was happening. Hasib had little sympathy.<br />
<br />
The priest took Hasib to the tallest of the towers on the edge of the courtyard. As they approached, Hasib heard a low, thudding drumbeat and sonorous, undulating chants. The sound grew louder as the priest opened the big, wooden doors and led Hasib inside. Hasib found himself inside a large, windowless chamber, lit only by a series of flaming cauldrons that made the room swelteringly hot. In the centre, upon a stone table, was a body, freshly wrapped in linens, awaiting to be interred to the catacombs. More priests lined the walls, some chanting, others banging drums or shaking rattles. Hasib had never seen the death rites being performed before, but he knew they involved a sacred dance that only the Hierophant could carry out. He remembered the Hierophant as a crotchety, elderly sphinx, so he was surprised to see a young sphinx stepping up to dance. He was even more surprised that he recognised him.<br />
<br />
There was no mistaking Ruh’s distinctive fur, which was whiter than the marble of the Great Pyramid. Hasib had known Ruh as a teenage boy and had rather foolishly imagined he would still be the same. He was a grown man now, and he certainly had grown. He was lithe and muscular and tall. He wore nothing but a patterned, silk breechcloth, freeing his body for the dance. There were plaits in his silvery mane and beads around his neck. He caught sight of Hasib and smiled. Hasib had never seen ice, but he imagined it would look something like the brilliant, pale blue of Ruh’s eyes.<br />
<br />
The music quickened and Ruh began to dance. It soon became clear where his new strength had come from, for the dance demanded it. Hasib watched as Ruh thrashed, leapt and spun, his body twisting and contorting, his beads almost flying off his neck and the front his breechcloth swinging. Near forgotten memories resurfaced in Hasib’s mind of when he and Ruh were students. Those warm nights they’d spent together. It was no taboo in sphinx culture for boys who were becoming men to explore themselves and each other. Most grew out of it by adulthood. Hasib thought he had grown out of it, but looking at Ruh now made him question it.<br />
<br />
Realising that Louis could read all of these thoughts, Ruh blushed. At least the bird was oblivious.<br />
<br />
The ritual ended. Ruh finished his dance. A group of priests came to lift the mummy away while the others filtered out in an orderly procession. The priest who had escorted Hasib went to inform Ruh of Hasib’s arrival, but Ruh was already heading over to greet them.<br />
<br />
‘Sib!’ he boomed. ‘How long has it been?’<br />
‘Too long, old friend,’ said Hasib. He couldn’t help grinning.<br />
He held out a paw but Ruh ignored it, locking Hasib in a tight embrace. He was still damp with sweat, which sent Hasib’s pulse racing, yet he felt a twinge of guilt come from Louis.<br />
<br />
‘You may leave us,’ Ruh bade the priest, who bowed and promptly vanished. Then they were alone in the empty embalming chamber.<br />
<br />
‘Oh, hello,’ said Ruh. Not to Hasib, but to the bird upon his shoulder. He lifted two fingers and caressed the bird’s chest. The bird glared at Ruh, but allowed it. ‘A new friend of yours? A souvenir from your travels?’<br />
‘You could say that,’ grumbled Hasib.<br />
<br />
‘You’ve been away from home too long. You must have missed it’<br />
Ruh went to a nearby basin of water and splashed his face. Droplets of water trickled down his chest.<br />
‘I did,’ said Hasib. ‘I see you are Hierophant now.’<br />
Ruh beamed. ‘I am as surprised as you are.’<br />
There was so much to catch up on. Hasib wanted to talk the whole night with Ruh, like the good old days. But he could feel the bird’s talon’s digging into him. He was there for a reason.<br />
<br />
‘Listen, my friend. I hate to interrupt pleasantries with business, but I have a favour to ask.’<br />
Ruh’s smile faded. ‘Can it not wait?’<br />
‘I’m afraid not,’ said Hasib. ‘I need to get inside the Great Pyramid. Can you help me?’<br />
<br />
Ruh’s face darkened. He turned his back on Hasib and walked further into the room. ‘You know it’s forbidden.’<br />
‘I would not ask if it weren’t necessary. I have reason to believe an evil creature has found its way inside.’<br />
‘I shall inform the priests. We will find it ourselves.’<br />
‘The priests won’t find it. Only I can.’<br />
‘Why is that?’<br />
Hasib faltered. He could not lie to Ruh, but Louis would strangle his words when he tried to tell the truth. ‘I cannot tell you,’ was all he said.<br />
<br />
Ruh turned back to Hasib. His face was stern, even angry. But as Hasib looked at him helplessly, his expression softened. He crossed the room towards Hasib until he was standing very, very close. He lifted one of his huge paws and placed it gently upon Hasib’s cheek. Hasib found himself leaning into his palm, allowing Ruh’s fingers to curl into his mane. The bird flapped its wings in surprise, stumbling off of Hasib’s shoulders. Hasib did not pay attention to where it landed.<br />
<br />
‘Have you missed me, old friend’ said Ruh, ‘as much as I have you?’<br />
Hasib could not answer. He had buried those feelings deep within himself, but with Ruh’s touch they were all alight once more. But why encourage it? He had died that morning. Once they found the gargoyle, Louis would take control again. They would leave this place and Hasib would never see Ruh again.<br />
<br />
Ruh leant in to Hasib’s ear and whispered, ‘If you have, meet me after dark in the Royal Bath House. I want to catch up properly.’<br />
Hasib’s eyes went wide. Did Ruh mean what he thought he meant?<br />
Ruh stepped back. ‘We were close once, but that was a long time ago. If you wish me to commit blasphemy, you must show me how truly you care for me. Restore my faith in you, and I will do as you ask.’<br />
<br />
With that, Ruh left. The bird had found a perch on a nearby vase, from where he watched Hasib angrily. Then Hasib flinched, gasped and almost toppled over. He grabbed hold the embalming table to steady himself. And when he spoke, it was in a language the bird understood.<br />
<br />
‘It’s me,’ said Louis. ‘I’m in control again.’<br />
Hawk was still glaring.<br />
‘Don’t look at me like that. That was all Hasib. I didn’t know he was here rekindle an old flame. I don’t think even Hasib knew.’<br />
Hawk’s expression did not change.<br />
‘Look, that white sphinx is in charge of the priests. He says if Hasib meets him tonight, he’ll take us into the Pyramid. It’s all part of the plan, I promise.’<br />
<br />
Hawk seemed placated at that, and flew across to retake his place on Louis’s shoulder. Although Louis hadn’t told him the full details, of course. Of what Ruh wanted in return. But there was no reason for Hawk to be jealous if Ruh made love to Hasib, was there? It wasn’t really infidelity if Louis wasn’t in control, surely?<br />
<br />
But even at the back of Hasib’s mind, Louis had been aware of everything. He had felt Hasib’s feelings as strongly as if they were his own. He couldn’t tell if his yearning for Ruh came purely from Hasib’s mind or partly from his own. <br />
<br />
It felt dishonest to go through with it. Dishonest to Hawk, especially if he did it without telling him. And dishonest to Ruh, who would never see Hasib again once the business was over. But if there was no other way of getting inside the Pyramid, what else could Louis do?</p>
