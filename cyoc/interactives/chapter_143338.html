<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Can I watch?” The words tumbled out of my mouth just as involuntarily as her confession had a moment before. We both stared at each other in surprise.<br />
<br />
“What?” Cathy asked me. She sounded shocked, as opposed to offended.<br />
<br />
“Can I watch?” I asked again.  <br />
<br />
“James..” Cathy said, hesistating for a moment, “I get REALLY sexual when the change happens. And to change back, I have to get myself off again, once I&#39;ve fully transformed. Are you sure you want to be around that? I mean..I&#39;m twice your age.”<br />
<br />
“Age is just a number, Cathy,” I replied. “You&#39;re a woman, and the fact you have to satisfy yourself isn&#39;t weird or gross to me. Plus,” I added, “You&#39;re very attractive.” That wasn&#39;t flattery or lies; I&#39;d seen her naked. Whether she aged so well due to being a werewolf, or just good genetics was beside the point. Her body was flawless. <br />
<br />
Cathy chewed her lip for a moment, and I could see her studying me, looking me up and down. I couldn&#39;t tell what precisely she was thinking about, or contemplating exactly. Maybe she was trying to figure out if I was fucking with her. Maybe she was trying to figure out if she could kill me. <br />
<br />
“Alright, James,” she said with a small nod. “But don&#39;t you dare tell your mom about this.”<br />
<br />
“My MOM knows you&#39;re a werewolf?” I said, legitimately surprised.<br />
<br />
“Of course she does,” Cathy replied. “We&#39;ve been best friends since we were seven, remember? She was there the first time I changed.”  I made a mental note to ask her for more details about that. I was also a little offended that my mother had never told me about Cathy&#39;s condition. But then again, here was a paradox. My mother knew (and had kept the secret from me) about Cathy...but she couldn&#39;t have kept this secret without me making the wish. Yet I was offended, because the revelation made me wonder what else she might have hidden from me, even though she couldn&#39;t have hidden it from me if I&#39;d never made the wish about an hour earlier.<br />
<br />
“I promise you, I&#39;ll never let my mom know about ANY of this,” I told her, which was the truth. I had absolutely zero desire to talk about anything sexual with my mom. Her version of “the birds and the bees” had been one of the most awkward conversations of my life.<br />
<br />
“Good enough for me,” Cathy replied with a smile. “OH SHIT, I ALMOST FORGOT!” she blurted out suddenly. “If you get scared or freaked out at ANY  time..which is pretty likely, since..you know, I&#39;m gonna be a giant monster,...DO NOT RUN. LEAVE CALMLY.”<br />
<br />
“Got it,” I said.<br />
<br />
“GODDAMN IT, JAMES, I&#39;M SERIOUS.” Her eyes locked on me, and her jaw was set. She walked over to me and grabbed me by the shoulders, forcing me to look her in the eyes. “I don&#39;t know why you want to watch this; I am going to turn into a monster.  And I know that you&#39;re sure you can handle this, but what you don&#39;t get..what your mind doesn&#39;t comprehend..is that you CAN&#39;T handle this. When you see me fully transformed, it will trigger a primal instinct in you, a survival instinct. Your body will tell you to run, because you are in the presence of an apex predator that has hunted man for thousands of years. “<br />
“And I know that you think you&#39;re entirely safe, because I&#39;m Cathy..and I&#39;ve known you for your whole life, and I would never hurt you. But James..” she paused, “When I&#39;m fully transformed; I&#39;m NOT Cathy. I&#39;m the beast. I am an apex predator, and you&#39;re made of meat. I&#39;m still..the human aspect of me..it&#39;s still in there, but it&#39;s not in control. I&#39;m a passenger. Sometimes I can influence behavior, but not always. And if you run, you&#39;re gonna trigger my hunting instincts...and..” she stared at the floor, and her hands dropped from my shoulders. “James...I REALLY don&#39;t want to hurt you.” The last words were soft, and full of emotion.<br />
<br />
“I promise that I won&#39;t let you hurt me,” I replied. I almost made a wish, but to be honest, I was concerned about creating another paradox. It was definitely something I would use as a backup plan if things went sideways, however.<br />
<br />
“Okay,” she said softly. There was silence for a few seconds, and then her mood seemed to brighten. It was almost as if we hadn&#39;t just had a weirdly heavy interlude just prior. “I think it&#39;s about time to do this, then.” She drew the curtains closed, and turned back to face me. “No need to have anyone accidentally catch a glimpse of this,” she said with a laugh.<br />
<br />
Cathy peeled her top off and shimmied out of the long skirt, and unlike the previous time I&#39;d seen her naked, this time she was acutely aware of her nudity. Her long hair was hanging over top of her breasts, and the light in the room accented the strawberry aspect of her strawberry blonde hair.  Her tits were wonderfully buoyant for being D-cups as well. I found myself enjoying her nudity more this time than I had the first time around, probably due to the fact I knew her better, as opposed to the first time, where I&#39;d been  more malicious in my enjoyment of it. “You like what you see there, James?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah,” I replied, probably a little too quickly.<br />
<br />
“Good,” she replied back, and immediately covered her mouth. It appeared she felt like she&#39;d answered a little too quickly as well.  She sat down on the floor, about two feet away from the couch I was sitting on. “Go ahead and get a video of a moonrise on your phone and show it to me,” she said.<br />
<br />
My hands were shaking as I opened the youtube app and did a quick search. I hit play and put the video into fullscreen mode and held it out to face her. Her eyes immediately widened, and a broad grin crossed her face. A full body tremor went through her. “O...Okay...” she said as she started to hyperventilate, “Last chance to leave, James..”</p>
