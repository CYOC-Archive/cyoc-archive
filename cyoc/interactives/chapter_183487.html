<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As James walked through the park near his campus he thought hard about how he had been dating Rebeca for half a year now. James was a short skinny engineering major and appearance wise was completely forgettable. On the other hand Rebeca was a tall curvaceous political sciences major and was easily one of the most attractive women on campus. James had met her when they had shared a humanities class that was required for both of their majors. For most of the class they hadn&#39;t talked to each other until near the end of the semester they had been randomly paired together for a project. <br />
<br />
The project was standard project and they would have completed it and went their separate ways had Rebeca&#39;s mother not had an accident forcing Rebeca to abandon the project to take care of her. It took a week for her mother to recover enough for her to insist that Rebeca should go back to class because she could take care of herself now. <br />
<br />
Rebeca was nervous when coming back to class thinking James would have been angry with her for abandoning him with the project. She would be surprised when as she went to class again she would find out that James had not only completed their project on his own but had made a copy of the notes from the lectures that she had missed. He had also tried to reach out to her friends in her other classes to get them to do the same. This had had mixed results as some of her friends had agreed but others had ignored the unpopular James. When she next talked to James he was glad that she was back and had gotten most of the stuff she had missed during her absence. Rebeca was really greatful for his efforts and had impulsively offered him a date with herself. James at that time had internally felt conflicted at accepting because he didn&#39;t want to feel like he had guilted her into seeing him outside of class but he also knew that this would likely be the last time they shared a class and he hated to lose the chance to spend more time with her, so he accepted. <br />
<br />
Their date had gone surprisingly well with them seeing a movie then going to an arcade then finishing the date eating Indian food in a nice but not fancy restaurant. James had expected that that would be the end of their relationship but insisted that they do it again and James found himself half a year later still with her. <br />
<br />
During the time that they had been together they had been seeing each other regularly between and after classes and had been going on dates and hanging out at each other&#39; apparent often. For the most part the time James got to spend with Rebeca was great but there were times when James felt out of place next to the gorgeous woman. Her friends were mostly kind to him seeing him as unthreatening but their were some of her friends who were rather dismissive of James. There was one friend of her&#39;s named Sofia that had made it clear to James that she did not like him. James tried not to be discouraged by this and strived to show her that he only wanted to do what was best for Rebeca.<br />
Things had changed a short while ago when at the beginning of a new semester Rebeca convinced James to move into her larger apartment so that they could share costs. Previous to this James had not slept with Rebeca as he was too afraid to ask and didn&#39;t want sex to change their relationship, but now that they were sleeping in the same apartment Rebeca had asked if he was open to have sex. James was open to it but in an attempt to prevent it from changing their relationship too much he made it a point to after sex talk with Rebeca about serious topics. They had talked about things like their future, what they thought about children, and this night Rebeca had talked about her sexuality and how she was bisexual. James was a little shocked at learning this but it didn&#39;t make him any less attracted to Rebeca when he asked if she was attracted to any of her female friends Rebeca assured him that while she found most of them attractive she preferred him. She then asked him to keep it a secret but she had found out that Sofia was a lesbian and had been trying to date her. Rebeca liked Sofia but saw her as more of a friend than someone she would want to date. <br />
<br />
It was the night after learning about Rebeca&#39;s and Sofia&#39;s sexuality that found James walking the park thinking his relationship with Rebeca. His mind was filled with thoughts about how he had gotten between Rebeca and Sofia and how he felt like their whole relationship might have been built on guilt. These thoughts clouded his mind and he found him self walking to a part of the park he had not been in before. He would be brought out of his thoughts when something caught his eye laying in the grass by a bush. He picked it up and saw that it was a packet of pills. He flipped it over and read the label. He then laughed to himself at the outrageous claims of the pills and was about to throw them away when he more thoughts surface in his mind. James was not the most endowed of men only reaching past 5 inches long. He tried his best in bed with Rebeca making sure that he tended to her pleasure just as much as she did for him but she it made no secret that she had some rather large toys tucked away for herself when she horny and alone. James pocket the pills not knowing what he should do with them and returned to his shared apparent.<br />
