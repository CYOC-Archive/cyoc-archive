<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Wolf Coven – Rubicon

<p>Cork, Ireland October 7, 2006 

<p><i>Talking all the day, with true friends who try to make you stay<br>
Telling jokes and news, and singing songs that pass the night away<br>
Saw the Galway salmon run, life twinkling, dancing, dazzling in the sun<br>
Leaving on her western shore, soft summer sunsets ask for more<br>
Stood by her Atlantic scenes…<br>
And sang a song for Ireland…*</i></p>

<p>Heather felt the wind in her hair and sun on her back as she, Dita, and Rachel ran effortlessly through the soft green fields.  She slowed to a stop, letting the rays of the setting sun soak into their nude forms. </p>

<p> “Hey guys,” reminded Rachel.  “The moon’ll be coming up any minute now!” </p>

<p> “Moment of truth, chica!” </p>

<p>Heather took a deep breath as she turned towards the southeast, the glow of the rising full moon illuminating the southern sky. </p>

<p>Dita squeezed her hand gently.  “We’ll be just fine, hon.” </p>

<p>The moon itself appeared over the horizon.  Heather gasped in anticipation, and Rachel looked at her friends with concern. </p>

<p>Nothing.  The silver disk now shone in its totality. </p>

<p>Rachel looked on questioningly.  “D’ye feel anyt’ing?”

<p>Heather and Dita looked at each other.  “I don’t feel any different, Deet, do you?” </p>

<p> “Uh…no.  Sure don’t.” </p>

<p>The two held their breaths, searching their bodies for anything that wasn’t supposed to be there. </p>

<p>They grinned.

<p>Heather gasped in delight.  “We’re okay!!  Dita!!  We’re okay!!” </p>

<p>Dita squealed happily, hugging her friend.  “They were wrong! Heather…we’re still human!!  Heather!!” </p>

<p> “Heather!!” </p>

<p> “Heather!” </p>
 
<p>Heather woke up.  Dita was looking down at her with a strange smile on her face.  “You overslept.  It’s eleven o’clock babe, and it’s the seventh of October.  Tonight’s the night!” </p>

<p><i>Ahhh shit</I>, thought Heather to herself.  She raised her eyes to the heavens.  <i>Very funny, God!</i>  “Where’s Rachel?”  Heather couldn’t believe what she did last night.  What the hell was going on?? </p>

<p> “Ah, she just took a shower.  How are you feeling?” </p>

<p> “You know how you feel when you’re leaning back in your chair and you just tip a little too far, but you’re able to catch yourself but just then you tip a bit too far again?  Kinda like that.  When do we know?”  Dita’s expression sobered and she stroked Heather’s hair gently.  “The full moon rises at a quarter till six, Mom says we’re gonna change right around that time.” </p>

<p> “So we have seven hours to wait?”  Dita nodded.  “Just about.  Look, I know you don’t want to believe this, but assuming that you’re wrong, we need to get someplace to hide for our transformation.” </p>

<p> “Fine,” said Heather.  “Where did you have in mind?” </p>

<p> “Looking at the map, I’m thinking we should head for Dingle.  It’s a pretty rugged place, perfect for people looking to get away for three days.  Most people pass it up for the Ring of Kerry.” </p>

“<p>What happens if we’re seen?  There can’t be that many places to hide.” </p>

<p> “We should be fine Heather.  Anyway, Rachel will be with us.  If it comes to that, she’ll just say that we’re with her.” </p>

<p>At that, Rachel popped out of the shower.  “So where we goin’ then?” </p>

<p> “Well now lass, we be headin’ down tae town of Dingle,” Dita teased. </p>

<p> “An Deangan peninsula then?  That’s a good choice.  But when you’re attempting an Irish brogue, you move the focus of your voice from the middle of your mouth to about an inch in front of it.  Gives ye the right intonation.” </p>

<p>After a quick brunch, they took the bus to Dingle.  Heather squirmed in her seat as the three hour bus trip seemed to take most of the day.  She wanted to talk to Dita about what happened last night, she knew that she didn’t really feel that way about women, but no, she couldn’t really breach the subject with Rachel around.  By the time they had arrived in Dingle town, it was already getting late. </p>

<p> “Okay.  This is Dingle, Dita. You want to hike, right?”<br>
“Right, we don’t want anyone spying on us if we can avoid it </p>  

<p>Heather glanced at her watch.  Five minutes till six.  She sat with Dita and Rachel. </p>

<p> “Heather,” Dita said quietly.  “It’s about that time, let’s take our clothes off.” </p>

<p>With a shuddering sigh Heather agreed.  Well, it wasn’t like she’d never been naked in front of friends before. She pulled off her shoes and socks, followed by her shirt and bra.  Goosebumps arose on her skin as she felt the frosty breeze.  She then pulled off her pants and underwear to the gasps of Rachel and Dita. </p>

<p> “Jaysus, Heather,” breathed Rachel, as she finished undressing in solidarity with her friends.  “Have you always had so much hair?” </p>

<p>Heather smiled sheepishly.  “I’d usually kept myself shaven or pretty trimmed, but I had to give it up two weeks ago.” </p>

<p> “It’s, uh, beautiful, Heather, wish I could get a muff like that,” said Rachel. </p>

<p> “Thanks, Rachel.  I was really scared at first…but y’know, it’s not that bad.  I really like the way that it looks and feels.” </p>

<p>Dita shuddered.  “It’s cute, but I couldn’t stand to have all that growing between my legs.  Sorry babe.” </p>

<p>Heather smiled sympathetically.  Funny, she didn’t seem to mind last night, did she?  “Dita, if our parents are right, you <i>will</i> have this growing between your legs…and under your arms.”  Dita’s face turned white at the thought. </p>
    
<p> “But all this time you’ve been denying it!” </p>

<p>Heather nodded.  “I still don’t think it will happen, Dita, your mom kissed me and made my hair grow, but that doesn’t mean that we are werewolves.” </p>

<p>Dita nodded towards the southeastern sky, swallowing hard, whimpering.  “Oh babe, we’re about to find out!  …My mom <i>kissed</i> you??”  Heather nodded silently. </p>

<p>The full moon crested the horizon.  Heather looked, biting her lip, praying silently that nothing would happen. </p>

<p>As the combination of reflected sunlight and lunar gravity touched the two teenagers, their pituitary glands kicked into action, activating a chain reaction of processes that most in medical science would consider impossible.  The first noticeable change was a rapid increase in body heat. </p>

<p>Heather gasped as she felt her body temperature rising, the heat soon accompanied with a strange swooshing of adrenaline throughout her body but seemingly centered around her lower belly.  Though the sensation was unbelievably pleasant, the tension she felt on the verge of orgasm, fear like she had never thought possible exploded within her into sheer terror. </p>

<p> “Dita!” Heather wailed.

<p>Dita nodded, whimpering. “I feel…!  Oh Heather, honey it’s happening!!” </p>

<p>The warmth increased in Heather’s joints and she lifted her hands to her face.  Her body shuddered involuntarily; it was if a nest of snakes had erupted and were squirming and crawling inside her, squeezing her bare bones, sliding through and caressing each fiber of her muscles. <i>Oh God, please… no… don’t let this happen to me!  PLEASE!!</i> Heather looked at her hands, feeling her hand’s muscles, tendons and ligaments spasm.  Slowly, almost imperceptibly, with a sickening crackling sound, her hands began to elongate.  Heather’s eyes welled with tears realizing that what she tried so hard to deny was coming to pass. </p>

<p>She was a werewolf, and Heather Peters didn’t like it at all. </p>

<p> “RACHEL…OH GOD…RACHEL HELP ME….<i>HELP ME</i>”, screamed Heather in horror, glancing over at Dita who was staring in shocked silence at her own changing hands, terrified.  Heather saw and felt soft downy hairs emerging from her skin with a tickling sensation.  </p>

<p> “No…Noooo.” Heather whined.  Her eyes widened in terror as she realized how canine her voice already sounded.  Heather flexed every muscle she could, fighting to stop the change, struggling to remain human.  Her mother’s words thundered in her head: <i>It is going to happen to you. You will grow fur; you will grow fangs and a muzzle. You ARE going to turn into a wolf on the night of October seventh, and yes, you probably will remain a wolf for a few days.</i></p>  

<p>Rachel rushed over to embrace Heather, and Heather stared at her with panicked eyes as she felt her teeth start extending into fangs. “Rachel,” she gasped.  “Help me.” </p>

<p> “I’m sorry, Heather.”  Rachel stroked her friend’s teary face with compassion.  “I’m so sorry.” </p>

“Rachel….<i>please!!!</i>”  Rachel, compassionate to the last, embraced her friend, feeling Heather’s transforming body trembling and shuddering in her arms.  “I’m here hon, but I can’t stop it.”  She took Heather’s cheek in her palm, feeling soft hair that had formed along the edge of her face.  Dita reached out to Rachel, her arms trembling, pulsating. </p>

<p>Despite her previous bravado, Dita was sobbing along with her friend as her pelvis gradually changed shape with a series of cracking pops that forced her and Heather to their knees, emphasizing the reality that they were truly becoming beasts.  Dita heard her own words coming back as if to mock her: <i>Deny it all you want Babe, but you can feel it inside of you as much as I can. On October 7th, you and I are gonna change.</i> Both girls groaned as powerful muscles began developing, a process that would normally take several months would happen over the course of a few minutes. </p>

<p>Heather felt a violent tingling under her arms and between her legs that spread all over her body.  Looking down at her body and moaning she saw that her pubic hair was straightening and getting thicker as it seemed to pulse on its own accord blossoming into dense black fur. Tiny hairs appeared on her breasts, even her nipples grew fuzzy.  Within a minute both Heather and Dita had a coating of thick fuzz all over their body, save for their faces, a fuzz that was steadily getting thicker, filling in the spaces between the patches of fur. Dita whimpered as she felt the inch-long fangs her canine teeth had become and probed the ivory-colored fur growing on her own body, a sensation that was actually quite pleasant if very unsettling.  She gasped and fell on all fours, her furry breasts wobbling as her feet were next to change, the instep lengthening, and the balls of her feet developing thick leathery pads. </p>

<p>Heather whined as she felt the nails of her elongated hands and feet thicken and lengthen into black claws, she lifted her hand and stared as the fingers became stubby and padded and her thumb shrank to a dewclaw. Bones and muscles crunched as their chests barreled out, their breasts shrinking to teats under the fur, joining four new ones that had formed.  </p>

<p>Heather felt pressure build in her backside. Sobbing in humiliation as her bushy tail appeared and lengthened to a full two feet, she cried out sorrowfully to Rachel; “I don’t wanna be a wolf!!  I don’t <i>wanna</i> be a wolf!!” </p>

<p>Rachel looked at her friends in sympathy, two wolves, one black, one ivory, with human faces. </p>

<p>Heather felt the hair on her head get thicker as it shortened into fur.  Her ears began lengthening, assaulting her eardrums with a much richer medley of sound.  She realized that only one thing remained to change and she screamed in anticipation of pain and in sorrow for the loss of her beauty.  <i>Oh no, please not my face, not my face, not my face!!</i>  Her face tickled furiously as it was covered with thick fluffy fur and she felt pressure build in her jaws.  A lust for bloody flesh welled within her, increasing her horror. </p>

<p> “No...no…oh God, no!!!” </p>

<p>With a series of shuddering cracks, Heather’s nose and mouth pushed forward into a muzzle.  Her moans and cries of fear deepened into growls, her horror increasing as yet another vestige of humanity disappeared.  Fur around her neck and shoulders lengthened into the thick shaggy ruff distinguishing the werewolf from the normal lupine. </p>

<p>Heather felt an irresistible urge to scream again.  She sat up, held her head to the sky…and let out a long mournful howl, joined in unison with Dita.  Their bodies trembled with unbearable pleasure as a series of powerful orgasms washed over them.  Heather saw her world go white, then red, and then passed into a strange muted vision.  Her eyes had gone from hazel to a golden yellow.  The transformation complete, Dita sat in stunned silence, struggling to come to grips with what had just happened to her, and Heather looked down at her new body, hungry and frightened beyond comprehension. </p>

<p>Heather stared at herself trembling in fear and horror, her tail <i>oh God; I have a tail, a freakin’  TAIL</i>, tucked tightly between her legs.  She was so frightened it was hard for her to breathe. <i>I’m not a human being anymore; I’m a monster, a freakin’ creature of legend!</i>  She whimpered, realizing that she didn’t sound even remotely human, realizing that never again would she <i>be</i> completely human. </p>

<p>Realizing that she was now looking at Rachel as easy prey, that one leap and a shake of her head and she would taste the delectable flavor of human flesh and blood. </p>

<p>Rachel looked upon her friend with concern, seeing the dark wolf whimpering, shaking in obvious fear.  “Heather...Heather, are you all right?”  Heather started at the noise, looking up to see Rachel staring at her sympathetically.  “Honey, can you understand me?” </p> 

<p>Heather growled, then, seeing Rachel withdraw wide-eyed, realized that she couldn’t talk anymore.  Heather nodded her shaggy head.  “Heather, you’re still in there, right?”  Heather nodded again.  “Are you okay?”  This time Heather whined and shook her head.  “Oh baby, I’m sorry.”  She approached the black wolf gingerly, not wanting to startle it. </p>

<p>Heather whined, and lowered her head to let Rachel stroke her.  She needed to be held, to be comforted. <i>I’m an animal…I’m an animal!!</i></p>

<p> “Shhh, easy Heather, you’re a beautiful wolf!”  Heather whimpered at this.  <i>I used to be a beautiful girl</i>, she screamed inside, but snuggled closer to Rachel.  </p>

<p>Rachel was amazed at what her friends had become as she hugged Heather lovingly.  Though beautiful, the two animals were terribly frightened, with Heather breathing rapidly and shallowly and Dita sitting on her haunches probing her fur.  “Heather?” Dita tried to say, but all that came out was two short yelps. </p>

<p>**Dammit, I can’t talk**</p>

<p>*dit-a?* </p>

<p>**Heather?  Can you hear me, hon?** </p>

<p>*yeah…i can hear you.  oh god dita...i’m a monster!!  A big furry <i>monster</i>!!*</p>

<p>**You’re NOT a monster babe.  Easy honey, you’ll be all right. **  </p>

<p>With some difficulty, Dita was not yet used to moving on all fours, she joined Rachel in comforting her friend, nearly loosing her balance as she stoked Heather’s shoulder with her paw. </p>

<p>*three days Dita.  We’re gonna have to stay this way for three days!* </p>

<p>**Aw, c’mon chica.  We can still enjoy ourselves!  Be honest Heather…how do I look?** </p>

<p>Heather looked at her friend as Rachel continued hugging her.  She had the massive ivory pelt of an arctic wolf, with clear golden eyes and black nose, but the size and musculature of a more powerful creature.  Dita was, in a word, spectacular. </p>

<p>*You look pretty good.* </p>

<p>**Oh gee golly gosh, thanks Heather.  You look positively <i>gorgeous</i> yourself.  You may have noticed that we are not now or as yet voracious beasts rampaging over the wilds of dear Erin.  I, for one, am a candidate for valedictorian with a four-three GPA and now have a <i>bitchin’</i> fur coat!  You’re in the fast reading group yourself.  We’re just…well**</p>

<p>*Not <i>human</i> anymore?* </p>

<p>**Is that really so bad.  Humans can’t do this…can they?”** </p>

<p>Dita strolled over to Rachel and gave her face an affectionate lick, then lay down on her back squirming.  Rachel squealed and gave Dita’s furry tummy a loving scratching.

<p>Heather rolled her eyes. </p>

<p>**Ohhhhh….GOD Heather that feels good!!  C’mon, now Heth.  Lessgo for a walk, eh?**  Dita leapt up and nuzzled Heather, and then put her paws on Rachel’s shoulder’s and received an affectionate hug. </p>

<p> “Awwwww, luv you TOO Dita.”  Rachel giggled, pleased to see her friend so happy.  She kissed Heather on the forehead.  “You too, Heather,” she whispered.  Heather whined. </p>

<p>*Thanks, Rachel.   Shit, you can’t understand me at all.  Oh Dita, I don’t know if I can handle this!* </p>

<p>**Yeah?  Are you hungry?** </p>

<p>*Famished.  My God Dita, I’m craving raw flesh!!* </p>
