<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Once Ty was back inside, he quickly closed the back door and made sure it was locked. He took his free hand and felt June squirming inside his closed fist. She must be very tiny! He carefully opened his fingers, palm up, and gasped at the sight of teensy tiny June lying dishevelled on her back in the middle of his hand. She stared back in fresh shock.<br />
<br />
She was barely three inches tall!<br />
<br />
&quot;T-Ty!&quot; June whimpered nervously, &quot;Please! I&#39;m getting too small!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry, little toy.&quot; Ty grinned deviously. &quot;I won&#39;t let anything happen to you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s hardly reassuring...&quot; June retorted, gulping slightly as she bounced and swayed while Ty carefully carried the toy sized woman up the stairs with him and returned to his bedroom. Shrunken and shrinking June had no choice but to hang on in the literal palm of Ty&#39;s hand, feeling herself dwindle ever smaller. Helpless, growing concerned, she laid back in nervous disbelief. Everything was terrifyingly huge to her now. Ty&#39;s bedroom was an expanse large enough to fit an entire town. The ceiling seemed to be thousands of feet above her. Worse still, he was still letting her shrink. During the journey upstairs she was lost a few more millimetres, which at her size was a significant amount.<br />
<br />
Ty sat down on the edge of his bed and stared at little naked June in wonder. She started back, blushing, and realized what was happening. She gulped hard, broke out into a sweat again, and went beat red with flushed arousal and fear.<br />
<br />
&quot;B-Be... be gentle.&quot; She squeaked, about two and a half inches tall. Her voice was squeaky and high pitched to the point it was growing inaudible to Ty. He had to lean in to hear her and watched her cringe as his massive head drew near.<br />
<br />
&quot;I thought you liked it rough, my little bitch.&quot; Ty smirked deviously, giggling as June laid back in his hand and her face registered a combination of anxiety and anticipation.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ty...&quot; June called up, alarmed as her shrinking continued. &quot;I&#39;m getting too small! You’re going to lose me!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you?&quot; Ty grinned playfully. &quot;Maybe I should let you go microscopic. I do have a microscope, after all.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ty, no!&quot; June suddenly flew to her knees and steadied herself in Ty&#39;s palm. &quot;W-What if... what if I get eaten by germs or something?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you going to do to make me stop it?&quot;<br />
<br />
June pleaded now. Putting her hands together and clasping her fingers, shaking her clenched fists emphatically. &quot;Whatever you want! Just like I said! Please! I&#39;m getting scared!&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty leaned in closer and raised the tiny two inch tall woman to his view. She knelt in the palm of his hand, terrified, and waited with a slack jaw and wide terrified eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please!&quot; She repeated, her voice decreasing in audibility and raising sharply in pitch, closer to a quiet squeak now than anything resembling human.<br />
<br />
&quot;Or I could speed it up...&quot; Ty offered, watching her body language fall. &quot;I could hold you in my hand as you pass a grain of sand and vanish under my eyes. Imagine walking in the canyon of my fingerprints.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No!&quot; June screamed, standing up and frantically waving. &quot;Please, don&#39;t! I wanted to be your friend! I can still fix things! I thought we were going to be friends! I can make you feel good! Don&#39;t shrink me out of existence! Please!&quot;<br />
<br />
At that moment Ty had a choice between cruelty and mercy. He held the object of his worst torment in his hand and she was fast vanishing from the world. If he let her go... if he let her keep going... she would be gone forever. Lost to sight. Forever shrinking until she eventually grew too small to either breathe, live, or even exist. She would shrink past matter, molecules, whatever else was even possible. Or he could keep her living in the micro-verse. The idea of her forever trapped in a nightmare world and struggling to survive, terrified... gobbled up by a microbe or a mite.<br />
<br />
It made him sick as much as it aroused him. Ty was many things, and he owed a great deal of retribution to June in particular - especially with his new powers - but he was no monster. He let the truly dark thoughts of snuffing her out pass by and focused on a crying and waving June, now so small that she couldn&#39;t be heard. While he had zoned out, she was reduced to mere millimetres, growing so small that his hand was now a rolling hill of flesh to her.<br />
<br />
Ty stared down at a very nearly insect sized step mom. A quarter of an inch? Millimetres? He had no idea how to quantify her size now. She was waving and pleading frantically, hopping in his palm with little tickles of movement he barely felt. Her voice had become so high that she was inaudible, reduced to only a quiet pip.<br />
<br />
He felt himself growing hard and full. The power he felt was the most spectacular thing he had ever experienced. He let her shrink and carefully raised from the bed to cross over to his desk. In the meantime, he watched her utter panic as she reduced to the size of a bug and continued. The little dot on his hand was running around helplessly in his palm as he became smaller and smaller.<br />
<br />
As promised, he pulled out a glass slide from his microscope and picked up a pair of precision tweezers. The dot in his palm was now a faint grain of sand in the barely perceptible shape of a human woman.<br />
<br />
He plucked it off his skin like a sliver and tried not to squeeze the tweezers. He dropped it onto the microscope’s slide and turned on the light. He leaned over excitedly and looked down the tube.<br />
<br />
He saw June’s crumpled torso. At 2x magnification she filled the view.<br />
<br />
“Oh, still such a big girl, aren’t you?” Ty whispered, feeling his erection swell and bob excitedly in his pants.<br />
<br />
That quickly changed. Ty watched the seconds tick by as June became small enough to see under the microscope. She was staring up at the godlike glass above her with the most pained and horrified look Ty had ever known. Tears fell from her eyes in anguish. She was clutching herself and trembling in horror. She was utterly helpless and utterly lost. He penis surged fuller and began to dribble in his shorts.<br />
<br />
He watched her go down further and further into irrelevancy, taking his eye from the view to look at the slide. She was nearly invisible. When he looked back, he saw a spec. He switched the microscope to four times. Then six times. Then eight times. By the time he reached ten, June was silently wailing uncontrollably and screaming in terror. Under the magnifier He saw... things. Germs on the glass. With a rush of delight, he saw June dwindle to their scale as they began to approach her.<br />
<br />
Well, now... he smiled. Let’s see if we feel like ending her life after all. June was quickly overcome. Ty switched to the last setting... twelve times, and watched as his unfathomably small spec of a step mom was engulfed in one of the creatures. It sucked her leg in. She kicked and screamed and clawed at the blob like microbe and eventually resorted to clawing frantically at the glass slide itself, trying to grip the microscopic imperfections on the glass surface.<br />
<br />
The next few minutes seemed to pass by in years. June was sucked deeper into the primordial being, from the waist down, still shrinking ever smaller. Ty watched her vanish from even the view of the microscope and decided he had seen enough. He knew she was about to be destroyed.<br />
<br />
Somewhere, deep below, lost to human sight, June was completely absorbed into the jelly like mass of what was now to her a titanic amoeba like germ. She sucked in one final breath as she passed through its membrane and closed her eyes. The slosh of whatever surrounded her rumbled through the wet form that encompassed her. All the while, she felt herself shrink into oblivion itself, reaching an impossible scale. She clenched her eyes as hard as she could.<br />
<br />
She waited for death. Her lungs felt like they might burst. Eventually, unable to hold it in anymore, she exhaled and was rewarded with the hollow noises of goo being sucked into her lungs. She kicked and struggled frantically as she began to drown in the germ’s innards. The weight of it was such that she could barely move.<br />
<br />
For a brief moment, she had the realization that she was about to die in the most fantastic way imaginable and felt genuine pain at the loss of never being able to experience whatever weird perverted desires Ty had intended for her.<br />
<br />
She began to fade. Her mind became foggy. She was almost 10 full seconds without air and about to black out... forever.<br />
<br />
Fine, she thought. I was a wretched cunt. I deserve this. She was still shrinking. She could feel the goop in her lungs being forced out of her mouth. She relaxed as her consciousness began to die along with her body.<br />
<br />
Take me, she thought.</p>
