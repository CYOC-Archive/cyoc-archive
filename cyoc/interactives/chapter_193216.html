<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The trio, Ryan and Carter, plus Gaz who followed along intangibly, headed out for a walk around town to see what kind of situations they could come across. Being that it was a bit earlier in the day, there weren&#39;t too many people out at the moment. However, one location that seemed to be the exception was the park a few blocks down. Groups of people were out and about, going for jogs, throwing a ball back and forth, or just taking in the warm summer air. <br />
<br />
They discussed a few different people that could be possible benefactors to their gifts, but when they came across two guys playing catch, they made up their minds. <br />
<br />
Upon first glance, it wasn&#39;t hard to see the differences between these two. One of the guys seemed to be a bit on the smaller side, probably a little under 6&#39; and on the skinnier side. He was struggling to throw the ball like his other friend who was practically his opposite. Tall, muscular, and even from this distance, it was easy to see he was extremely good looking, particularly because at this moment, a few girls had come up to flirt with him. <br />
<br />
&quot;Come to your party later? Sure, I can make it, but only because you asked so nicely,&quot; he said with a wink. <br />
<br />
The girls giggled as they walked away together. The popular friend looked satisfied, but his catching partner looked a little less than amused. <br />
<br />
&quot;I cannot believe you, Dave. Even on a Friday morning in the middle of the park, girls can&#39;t help throwing themselves at you.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, it&#39;s not my fault. The ladies can&#39;t help themselves around me,&quot; Dave laughed and jokingly flexed his arms. &quot;Besides, Brady, why are you so jealous? You don&#39;t even like girls.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Sure, but I still never get that kind of attention like that from guys. Even at gay clubs I feel like I just disappear.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve always told you that you can start working out with me. I&#39;d give you some of my muscle if I could since I have so much to spare, but until that&#39;s possible, you&#39;re gonna have to put in the work.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know. Do you really think that&#39;ll help?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Hell yeah it will! Listen man, if I were gay and you were all buff and stuff, I&#39;d be all over you.&quot; <br />
<br />
Dave jokingly started stroking Brady&#39;s arm. Brady blushed for a moment before a smile spread across his face. He pushed Dave away. &quot;Ha ha, good one. I wish that was the case, then someone could finally take that ego of yours down a notch.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe then you&#39;d finally see what all the fuss is about.&quot; Dave said, gesturing to himself. <br />
<br />
The two of them continued to talk and joke around with each other, but unbeknownst to them, there were a few powerful ears listening in on their conversation. <br />
<br />
&quot;Gaz, I think you know what needs to happen here. I wish what Dave and Brady were talking about would come true.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Granted. Hope you&#39;ll like your first work of charity.&quot; <br />
<br />
Eventually Dave and Brady got back to their game of catch, but as they were throwing the ball, they felt a weird tingling sensation wash over them. It only lasted for a moment, and both of them brushed it off easily enough. However, with each pass of the ball, their wish would slowly be granted. <br />
<br />
It was subtle at first, but within the first few throws their changes started to become evident, although neither of them really noticed. Brady&#39;s shirt started coming up above his waist as he grew taller. His flat stomach peeked out from underneath the hem showing his faint treasure trail. His legs stretched as well, making his knee length shorts start to look like they were supposed to have that 5&quot; inseam. Brady usually sat somewhere around 5&#39; 8&quot;, but he would probably be pushing 6&#39; if measured. <br />
<br />
Dave on the other hand was going through the opposite change. As he was shrinking, his shirt started draping across his torso a little more. The fabric was still being pressed tight against his impressive muscles, but it seemed to be a size too large now. Running for the ball, Dave almost stumbled a few times as he had to adjust his pants to keep them from falling. <br />
<br />
And one particular time, Dave went to go for a catch, one that he knew he should have caught, but for some reason it grazed over his fingertips, just out of reach. &quot;I think I&#39;m getting worn out, bro. I should have been able to make that catch.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe you&#39;re just not as good as you thought,&quot; Brady retorted. &quot;Besides, we haven&#39;t been going that long. I feel fine!&quot; <br />
<br />
Dave was about to make his own snarky remark, but something in his mind was stopping him from doing so. As he went to throw the ball back, he noticed there was something off about Brady. &quot;Nice crop top, Brade.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean?&quot; Brady asked. He looked down at his shirt and noticed his shirt was coming up a few inches above his belly button. Figuring his shirt had just rolled up, he tried pulling it down, but it wouldn&#39;t budge. While he was doing so, he also saw that his stomach looked a little more toned than he remembered. &#39;Who cares if I&#39;m showing a little body, I look good anyways,&#39; he thought to himself. <br />
<br />
Brady and Dave continued to toss the ball back and forth, and as they did so, the changes only expedited. The portion of stomach that Brady was showing off became more chiseled as the muscled refined themselves into a well sculpted six pack. The part of his torso still covered by his shirt was also growing. A pair of pecs started to form on his chest, and as they plumped up, they began pushing against the fabric. They bounced as he ran around for the ball, but Brady was too focused to tell. But the shirt, which realistically was hanging on for dear life at this point, wouldn&#39;t last for long. As Brady&#39;s arms grew, the sleeves tightened against his newly bulging biceps, but in doing so restricted his range of motion. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, you don&#39;t mind if I take my shirt off, right? Feels a little tight.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;No problem, Brady, I&#39;ll join you, too.&quot; <br />
<br />
The two of them took off their shirts. However, this was when they both really realized the changes their bodies were going through. While Brady had been hulking out, Dave on the other hand had his own transformation to deal with. His chest had flattened out completely. There was still a sense of tone to his slim torso, but it was a far cry from the sculpted terrain he was used to. His arms had thinned out as well. If he flexed, he could still make a bicep, but it was probably a good five times smaller than he was used to. As he was looking over his upper body, Dave didn&#39;t realize his pants were slipping. And as his pants fell, his slim legs had been brought to his attention. His legs had shrunk along with the rest of him, but strangely enough, his ass seemed to actually be bigger than before, although not as defined. However, not only were his smaller than before, they were a lot smoother, too. There was only a small dusting left on his calves. In fact, that seemed to be the case elsewhere as he saw that the rest of his body was a lot smoother. His arms, his chest, and as he brought his hands up to his face, he felt a distinct lack of stubble. <br />
<br />
Dave was about to call out to Brady, but his voice got caught in his throat as he saw had become of his friend. Standing over there was a behemoth of a man groping his body. <br />
<br />
Brady finally took stock of the situation as his shirt came off. He was ripped. He ran his hands up and down his chest, reveling in the sensation of his new pecs and abs being touched. Interestingly, he felt a rough texture as he was doing so, and that was when he saw that there was a fine layer of hair covering his chest before. He bounced his pecs and smiled as he realized he had the kind of body that he would always lust over before. Now those kinds of people would lust over him. <br />
<br />
Brady struck a few poses, flexing his biceps and drinking in their new size. He stretched out his legs, which at the moment were swallowing his shorts. And as he flexed his thick thighs, within seconds they ripped off. Normally he would be ashamed of being this exposed in public, but a voice in his mind told him that people would be lucky to see this much of him. Going with that line of thought, Brady pulled out his phone from the remnants of his shorts and went to take a selfie. When he opened the camera, he saw that not only was he now ripped, he was handsome, as well. No, not handsome. Sexy as hell. His haircut had coiffed itself into something you would see in a fashion magazine, which only served to help highlight his perfect face with its angular jaw and accompanying well-groomed beard. <br />
<br />
Satisfied with a the few selfies he took, he remembered Dave was probably over there shocked by his transformation. Brady was going to rub it in. Now they were equals, maybe even something more than equals. But when he looked over to where Dave should have been, he saw a skinny, barely dressed twink staring back at him. At first, he thought this twink had been perving on him, but upon close inspection, he kind of resembled Dave. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yo, Dave, is that you?&quot; Brady asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;Um, well... yeah. What happened to us Brady?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;No idea, but who cares? Look at me Davey, I&#39;m a fuckin&#39; beast!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m happy for you, but do you see me? All those hours in the gym gone. I&#39;m just little twig now.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, but at least you&#39;re still good looking. Maybe not in the same way, but you&#39;re definitely cute.&quot; As those words left Brady&#39;s mouth, Dave&#39;s face slimmed as the rigid angles from before softened into a younger looking visage. <br />
<br />
&quot;But I don&#39;t want to be cute. I want to be big and rugged like you. I mean, like I used to be. How am I supposed to pick up girls like this?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe you don&#39;t.&quot; <br />
<br />
Brady pulled Dave in for a bear hug, placing his head against his chest. With his face shoved into Brady&#39;s meaty cleavage, he felt a tickling against his skin as Brady&#39;s chest grew a blond forest of hair from the dusting he had before. Then, suddenly a wave hit Dave as a new scent filled his nostrils. Brady began smelling muskier, and normally Dave would reel away from being this close to a big, sweaty guy like Brady, but for some reason, he found himself melting into him. Those concerns he had earlier washed away. He didn&#39;t need to worry himself with girls anymore, he knew what he wanted, and it was right in front of him. <br />
<br />
&quot;Heh, you like that, Davey?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Mmm, yeah. God, Brady, you feel so good. I feel like I can&#39;t tear myself away from you,&quot; Dave said reaching around, grabbing a handful of Brady&#39;s muscular ass. <br />
<br />
Dave could tell that Brady liked that because he could feel something stiff pressing up against his stomach. Dave had seen Brady nude once or twice on accident, but it didn&#39;t look like he was working with this monster before. <br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck. You can&#39;t do that in public, you&#39;re gonna make me burst out of my boxers. But, I guess that means you&#39;re not so concerned with the changes anymore.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Not if I get to have more fun with you later,&quot; Dave said looking up at Brady with pleading eyes. <br />
<br />
&quot;Why don&#39;t I give you a little preview of what&#39;s to come,&quot; Brady said before pulling Dave in for a deep kiss. <br />
<br />
As they made out, their clothes, or rather what was left of their clothes, started shifting. Forming over Brady was tank top and a pair of athletic shorts, while on Dave was a mesh crop top and a pair of short shorts. <br />
<br />
Brady was the first to break the kiss. &quot;How about we take this back to my place.&quot; <br />
<br />
Brady and Dave headed off, still remembering what their lives used to be like, but too consumed in the pleasures of their new lives to care. <br />
<br />
&quot;Aww, that&#39;s so cute how they ended up together in the end. Plus that Brady guy got me chubbed up just looking at him. Really good work, Gaz,&quot; Carter said. <br />
<br />
&quot;That felt nice to be able to help people like that. I wonder if there&#39;s anyone else around we could help?&quot; Ryan asked.</p>
