<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">There was something very strange going on. It started with just one themed diner but it could have effect hundreds by now. In certain 80s themed diners a strange energy really built up and people with little interest in the era become walking stereotypes of it. It&#39;s still the same year and your still the same person technically, but everything about you is different. You become the way you would have been in that era.<br />
<br />
It started with a group of college students. They were typical nerdy guys. They had agreed to meet there to talk about plans for their guild in World of Warcraft. They typically met at a local restaurant for these meetings but it was family owned and due to the economy had to close. They then decided to have their meeting at this diner that was in the same general area that they used to met in. What they didn&#39;t know at the time was it was 80s themed, not that it would have mattered at the time. <br />
<br />
They got there and 80s music was playing from a jukebox. The waiters and waitresses were all dressed up like the 80s the crazy hair styles and shoes. Even the way they spoke fit the era, obviously this place went all out. The group barely noticed they were the only customers at the time. A waitress wearing roller-skates came up and took their orders. The food was all the same but that&#39;s cause seriously has diner food really ever changed? <br />
<br />
They were discussing their plans and the one wanted to check Facebook while he was waiting to say his opinion but his phone seemed to have no signal. <br />
<br />
&quot;Mike what&#39;s wrong?&quot; One of the other guys, Danny, asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;My wi-fi isn&#39;t working what kind of diner doesn&#39;t get a signal?&quot; Mike said confused. <br />
<br />
&quot;we&#39;ll ask the waitress&quot; Danny said unconcerned.<br />
<br />
When she came back with their drinks they asked her about why phone connections don&#39;t work and she smiled at them. <br />
<br />
&quot;Got one of those fancy mobile phones huh?&quot; She said &quot;I wish I could afford one but they really haven&#39;t got many signal stuff up yet so it&#39;s not worth it&quot; she then takes their food orders and goes.<br />
<br />
She seriously acted like in the 80s when the brick phone was all you could get and very expensive. They checked and none of their phones could get a signal or internet it was as if it didn&#39;t exist here. The guys were confused but continued talking about their plans, they could go an hour or so without a phone. <br />
<br />
As they continued to discuss they didn&#39;t notice the subtle changes.  <br />
<br />
The first changes were in another one of the 3, David, he start to scratch his head as his hair started to grow out a bit. His hair slowly grew out into what looked kind of like a mullet. It matched his blond hair but none of the other guys seemed to notice. As they kept talking about their plans but David found it hard to concentrate. <br />
<br />
Most growing mullets but Mike ended up with very short hair. Mike short hair, Danny, and David got mullet hair. None of them really seemed to notice much. Their shirts began to change and shift material into different variations of sleeveless and t-shirts, defiantly not the type that these nerds would wear. Their pants started to change a morph into short-shorts. Defiantly not the type most guys today wear but it was so popular in the 80s, even among guys. <br />
<br />
They didn&#39;t notice as their muscles bulked up. It now seemed to make sense the sleeveless shirts now showing their much bigger biceps. Danny flexed a bit unconsciously. Their calves and leg muscles bulked as if they are always active. <br />
<br />
As they talked they hardly noticed their conversation started shifting from WoW and other games to sports, football specifically, and girls. Now not like how guys talk about girls today but very clean cut type. Some strange mix of immature and innocent. <br />
<br />
Their skin tone cleared up going from slightly oily to clear to tan over a few minutes. They seemed to be total jocks now. They found themselves singing along to the 80s songs and their phones vanished, apparently none of them wanting them. Mike subconsciously not liking sports but doing it to please his father. The other 2 were hardcore into it. <br />
<br />
After their meal they paid and left. &quot;Dudes I heard there&#39;s a totally righteous party going on at someone&#39;s house&quot; Danny said <br />
<br />
&quot;Who&#39;s?&quot; Mike asked<br />
<br />
&quot;Some airhead named Britney, I don&#39;t know&quot; Danny shrugged as if that detail didn&#39;t matter. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well we need to know in order to get there&quot; David said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok, ok, chill I just gotta ask around&quot; Danny said putting his hands up defensively. <br />
<br />
They left and eventually did find the party, turns out a lot more people have been effected by the diner cause there was a full on 80s party when they got there. But who else might become a victim.</p>
