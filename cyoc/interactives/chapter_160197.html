<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Three days later, Connor was sitting on the coach, watching TV, huddled up in a blanket. This was supposed to be the day she would change back. She didn&#39;t want to be fooling around with Allen, and then suddenly revert back to a man. Instead, she sat alone and simply waited. She didn&#39;t know what to expect. Would she slowly become a man again, or would she change in a poof, like it never happened in the first place?<br />
<br />
The doorbell rang. Connor opened the door. She didn&#39;t see any person there. Instead, there was a piece of paper, and on it, written in thick lines with a black marker, there was a message.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come to the grand oak tree at midnight if you want to be a man again. Do not tell anyone. Come alone.&quot;<br />
<br />
Connor reminisced. In the woods, there is a clearing where kids play, and in the center of the clearing there is a large tree, nicknamed the grand oak tree. It is also a popular place for teenagers to fool around. In fact, back then, that&#39;s where Connor fucked Jenna. This must be her idea. She always took herself a little too seriously, which is why she couldn&#39;t handle getting dumped, even if all they did was drunkenly fuck after some party.<br />
<br />
--------------------<br />
<br />
At night, deep in the dark woods, a small girl walked. In her hand, she held her phone as a flashlight, lighting up the overgrown path in front of her. Without a light source, it would have been completely pitch black. The air was chilly, so she had borrowed her mother&#39;s coat.  Various roots and brambles, were noticeable hurdles to her shorter legs. Everything appeared large to her at her size. She thought back to how mysterious these woods were back when she was a young kid. She was reminded of those times. However, her nostalgic mood was abruptly broken as she saw some discarded condoms laying around.<br />
<br />
The clearing was coming up ahead. What was the time? She looked at her phone. &quot;23:42&quot;. Well, she didn&#39;t want to be late, but this was a little early Was she supposed to stay at the outskirts and wait until midnight sharp? <br />
<br />
&quot;Connor? Is that light from you?&quot; she heard. Was that Josie&#39;s voice?<br />
<br />
She stepped forward. Out in the clear, the night sky offered ambient lighting, leaving her not so dependent on her phone&#39;s light. She could see the grand oak tree. Two persons were standing next to it. That had to be Josie and Jenna. They started walking towards her. They got closer, and she could see that it certainly was them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my god!&quot; Josie exclaimed. &quot;You look so different now!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, all because of you two.&quot; Connor replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your voice, it&#39;s so light!&quot; Josie squealed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Puh!&quot; Jenna spat. &quot;Connor, you deserve this. This only happened to you because you&#39;re a jackass. You haven&#39;t suffered enough. Not enough for what you did to me. What you&#39;ve done to so many people. Don&#39;t think you&#39;re off the hook yet. If you ever do something bad then we&#39;ll do much worse! Ten times worse!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Jenna!&quot; Josie interjected. &quot;Enough of that. We&#39;ve done enough as it is.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Connor, you&#39;re lucky Jenna is a softie.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I am not a softie! Jenna, you&#39;re just mean! And also, you didn&#39;t see how Kendall cried, how distressed she was. Just imagine how horrible it must have been for Connor to through all this, not knowing anything. Imagine! Connor, please forgive me.&quot; Josie went to hug Connor. The small girl was fully embraced by the emotional Josie.<br />
<br />
&quot;How will you change me back?&quot; Connor piped. She could barely speak with Josie squeezing her.<br />
<br />
&quot;In one day.&quot; Josie released their hug.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not now?&quot; Connor asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s happening over the next 24 hours. Josie explained.&quot; We initiated it just now.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;So we&#39;re done?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes.&quot; Josie confirmed. &quot;Sorry for asking you to come out to the woods in the middle of the night. We wanted to see the girl you, and Jenna, well she wanted a theatrical ending of sorts.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well it would have been dramatic if you kept to the script and didn&#39;t start apologizing to Connor. That defeats the entire point of everything. Whatever. Connor, just know we&#39;re not even yet.&quot;<br />
<br />
After a somewhat constrained goodbye to the two girls, she once again walked through the dark woods. She was actually going to change back. This was the end.<br />
<br />
----------------<br />
<br />
Connor woke up the next morning. She felt the muscles she had so dearly missed. She was still a girl, but no longer did she have twig for arms. Her body had actual definition. Patting her chest, her breasts were smaller too. This was about the body she had when she first had sex with Allen. She probably still had the time for a quick session. If she called Allen he would probably skip class to fuck her, but no. She couldn&#39;t do that. She had to stop thinking of Allen in this way. She was soon to be male again. Everything was supposed to go back to how it used to be, and she had to accept that.<br />
<br />
As the evening arrived, his female form was only a memory. He was back to his buff male self. A few hours were still left, but it was close enough, so that no one could notice, which was fortunate, since his parents arrived home from their vacation. They saw their son, having no idea he was a girl some hours before. His parents told him all about their trip. He nodded along, pretending he was interested, but his mind was in a different place entirely. <br />
<br />
He realized he hadn&#39;t sent any message to neither Kendall and Allen that he&#39;d changed back. Should he even send a message? His relationship with Kendall had been kind of awkward ever since he transformed into a girl, and his relationship with Allen, well it could get awkward now that he was male again. He could just show up to school like had done before, acting all normal, pretending nothing happened. Everything was normal now, right?</p>
