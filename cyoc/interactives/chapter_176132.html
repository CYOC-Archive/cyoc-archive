<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;You will be fine,&quot; Fabina said to the African American woman walking beside her, &quot;the conversion doesn&#39;t hurt... and the people at Horizon are most accommodating with people. They even hired an uplifted Animal as one of their scientists when they found out she&#39;d actually &quot;learned&quot; from the Human scientists they had on staff that were often discussing things outside and near where she lived...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s not the conversion I&#39;m worried about,&quot; the woman, Barb, said slowly, thankful that the mask she was wearing presently covered some of the surgical scars that had related to both the enhancements put in and taken out, &quot;It&#39;s more... well... the embarrassment over some of the details...&quot;<br />
<br />
Fabina nodded as she escorted Barb toward Horizon Lab&#39;s doors. She had met with all three of the women had ended up on the wrong end of the adult entertainment industry, and something that Fabina was well aware had its problems. She wasn&#39;t the sort to say it was wrong to have adult entertainment, as to a degree she&#39;d long felt that things like sex were natural and that people should be more comfortable with accepting that. It&#39;d be a means to deal with sexual desire in a more constructive way than what had been offered by those that tended to emphasize some form of repression. That ultimately lead to problems where eventually those desires get out of control and people are actually harmed by them. And what happened to Barb and her friends was a part of that problem, as because of so many of the taboos that were out there regarding sex, those playing to various particular fetishes could get extreme, that had included efforts to enhance them in ways that were unrealistic and gave them problems afterward. Thus her sponsorship for the three of them for their conversions.<br />
<br />
&quot;They won&#39;t be a problem,&quot; Fabina said softly, &quot;as I said... Animalians are rather open and accepting about sex. There is of course the desire to generally keep things &quot;private,&quot; particularly with romantic couples... but there will be some understanding and acceptance on what happened to you. Now... the male you would get the chance to date, marry, and have a family with... IF that&#39;s what you want might not be into the whole dominatrix thing, but you should be well aware that Animalians are very well proportioned.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes... but it&#39;s more natural for you,&quot; Barb answered as she looked Fabina and could see the Dog Animalian&#39;s generous curves not being hidden by her shirt or long fur, &quot;we were all pumped up in ways that looked... unnatural and then cast aside with not enough money to even remove the enhancements until your sponsorship came in...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That is a wrong by your previous employer,&quot; Fabina promised, &quot;not something that Animalia will hold over you. In fact they&#39;re rather big on second chances.&quot;<br />
<br />
Barb smiled at that as Fabina opened door into the waiting area. She entered and came up to the person manning the front desk. It all carried the assorted security measures that related to Covid 19. The vaccine presented a hope for an end to it, though the slow roll out of that vaccine was raising problems with it and that kept the restrictions in place and would have Lyre&#39;s Horizon Light continuing to take in Covid patients as it was one of the few places in the area with the space to treat the surging number of cases, and that kept a lot of people on edge. Barb accepted that and handed in the initial request forms and handling the related paperwork that was to be finished as per Horizon&#39;s requirements. <br />
<br />
When the last of the paperwork was finished the secretary spoke, &quot;if you go through the doors to the left here, we&#39;ll have a staff member escort you to one of the waiting rooms we have set up for those waiting conversion. One of our specialists will meet you there.&quot;<br />
<br />
Barb nodded and glanced over to Fabina who had moved toward the other end of the main waiting room and then turned back, &quot;may my sponsor come with me? I know I don&#39;t need the help and all... but...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She may accompany you to the waiting room... and may follow to outside the conversion room to wait for your transformation to finish,&quot; the secretary spoke, &quot;but unless she is the one converting you, she cannot be in the conversion room with you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I understand,&quot; Barb answered, &quot;just wanting to make sure someone I know is in the area...&quot;<br />
<br />
The secretary nodded, and with that sign of approval Fabina did come forward. The pair continued on with Fabina following behind. Fabina wasn&#39;t sure of some of this wasn&#39;t guilt over being pushed into the situation she and her friends had been in, embarrassment at having to convert into Animalians to remove the surgical scars, or simple shyness at related to becoming an Animalian to regain a more natural version of the sort of look that had been had as a result of the cosmetic surgery. All could be possible, though Fabina didn&#39;t want to try and guess. It wasn&#39;t her place to guess and she was there to give some sense of comfort to Barb and provide enough &quot;scouting&quot; so that when Amos met her there wouldn&#39;t be too many surprises or any frustration between a former porn star and an active body-builder.<br />
<br />
The scientist who came was Judy and Barb ultimately did relax a little when the grey furred Mountain Cottontail Rabbit Animalian gave her polite smile and ushered her into the conversion room. Fabina waited quietly outside the door. A few moments, Judy came out of the room and moved to stand by the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is one of the &quot;plastic girls&quot; that I&#39;ve heard about?&quot; Judy asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Fabina answered, &quot;all were able to get the plastic out in funding their conversions...&quot; Fabina looked to Judy, &quot;that isn&#39;t a problem?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No problem,&quot; Judy answered, &quot;but even with a mask on... there were some signs of surgical scars on her face... I... I can&#39;t believe people would put people through all that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The problems repressing sex so much,&quot; Fabina commented, &quot;people pretend to be Puritans and forget that they were still going to have sexual desires letting some hide desires that might not be as good as others. In this... Animalia is a rescue for them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She did thank me for that,&quot; Judy answered, &quot;and given the choice of Animalian she has... hopefully she and Amos get along well.&quot;<br />
<br />
Fabina nodded when there was a knock at the door and then it opened. Barb slowly came out, still wearing her clothes, though the shirt was a bit stretched in the back because of the spines that she&#39;d grown that the Texas Horned Lizard was none for. The larger spines on her head actually poked through her dark hair. She moved with a bit of confidence as she swayed her now wider hips and larger bosom that strained her shirt and bra from the front. Barb still had her mask on, though it was now suspended from the spikes on her head rather than her ears, as lizards didn&#39;t have an external ear structure in the way that mammals did.<br />
<br />
&quot;This feels pretty good,&quot; Buzz announced, &quot;I checked and all the scars are gone... though it feels like my back is at war with my bra.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s probably the spines pushing against the fabric,&quot; Fabina commented, &quot;we&#39;ll see if the designers have some ideas... As we do have another Texas Horned Lizard Animalian, but HE is a male, and thus I don&#39;t think they&#39;ve made bras.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh... that could make for something interesting... what does he do?&quot; Barb asked, and actually sounding curious.<br />
<br />
&quot;Before the pandemic shut everything down... he&#39;s into body building,&quot; Fabina answered, &quot;How he&#39;s done I can&#39;t say. He became an Animalian before I did.&quot;<br />
<br />
Barb nodded, &quot;so first we see about some clothes and we&#39;ll go from there.&quot; She paused to look to Judy, &quot;and thank you again.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It was no problem,&quot; Judy responded.</p>
