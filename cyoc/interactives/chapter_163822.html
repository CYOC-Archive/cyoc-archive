<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Over the course of the week, Deion (as he called himself around the school) found himself kind of getting used to the life of a black guy, even though he swore over and over that he was not going to acclimate or accept it. Admittedly, the rap music he listened to now with the other black guys on the team just really hit it for him, and even if he changed back somehow, he did find he probably had a new appreciation for music outside his usual. He didn&#39;t share what had happened to him with anyone at the school though, and when he was at home, even after he started making new friends, Deion spent his time trying to find ways to revert himself back to Alec, or at least understand what happened to him.<br />
<br />
He spent a good amount of his every day life in the gym or hanging out with his new friends on the football team - tell the truth, having a more diverse set of friends... it really gave him a sense he hadn&#39;t been living right before. He&#39;d dismissed a large number of people here on purely ethnic grounds - and that did a disservice to them.<br />
<br />
Working out with the guys on the team really impressed that on him in particular. He&#39;d never been particularly enchanted with the working out part while he&#39;d been on the wrestling team, but now he just plain loved the fitness aspect. And the girls loved it too. He&#39;d had more than a few dates already, mostly to the town cafe. Some things just did not change - while joking with his date on Thursday, she had joked that his taste in location was kinda white.<br />
<br />
Deion had just smiled to himself as he mentally noted to himself, &#39;And that would be because I used to be a white guy before some street gangstas made me like this.&#39; Of course he said nothing of the sort to her. Didn&#39;t want his date thinking he was crazy, after all. What a crazy life he&#39;d led so far.<br />
<br />
Speaking of crazy, he&#39;d been ordering and obtaining books on the topic of this kind of change, well, trying to anyway. Few if any of them seemed to be authentic or trustworthy, speaking of some of the craziest terminology he&#39;d ever heard. So he had about ten books on this kind of thing on his shelf at home, on top of about eight other books about trying to induce changes. None of them worked to make him turn back into &quot;Alec&quot;. But he was not gonna give up on changing back into who he knew he truly was.<br />
<br />
Even though this life was...not quite so bad.<br />
<br />
Thus Deion about a week after his first day at the school was starting to really find his groove at the school. He left his generous and mostly empty house as per the usual, having recently stocked up on food due to the fact he seemed to have an enhanced appetite due to the changes to his fitness. Muscle needed a lot of food. He&#39;d had three servings of chicken, almonds, salad, and a banana before heading out. Maybe he was always such a temperamental twat when he was such a racist because he didn&#39;t eat right...<br />
<br />
Deion as usual passed by some of the girls, and waved...and surprisingly, his old girlfriend Kayla waved back at him. He bit his lip slightly and turned away, not eager to have this happen now. Could she tell? Could she see he was actually Alec? They had been boyfriend and girlfriend for the better part of a year and a half, and she knew him well... Deion decided to bite the bullet. &quot;Hey, how&#39;re you lovely ladies doin&#39; this morning.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi Deion!&quot; <br />
&quot;Hey hot stuff!&quot;<br />
<br />
Kayla on the other hand was silent for a moment and Deion hoped she wasn&#39;t--- his worries were cut short when she said, &quot;...Hi. Sorry about that. I&#39;d just been deep in thought...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She&#39;s dealing with boyfriend trouble.&quot; One of the girls said, followed by the other saying, &quot;Yeah, her old boyfriend was a huge racist, turns out. He was a creep, but he always treated her well. So she doesn&#39;t know how to deal when he left.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ouch. Deion did admit that he was well prepared to hear how people viewed &quot;Alec&quot; as if he was gone now, but to hear that kind of an opinion on himself... did they feel that way toward him before, and were just being quiet about it? He looked down and said, &quot;Uhh yeah, I get that. Sorry that uh, you have to deal with that kinda thing. I get that feelings can get all tangled up... hm, you up to hang out some time after school?&quot;<br />
<br />
Kayla took a moment to contemplate, and whispered with her friends, consorting with them about whether this was wise. Everyone, after all, knew about how Deion was now. She then stepped forward, &quot;Sure. How about after school today by the track field?&quot;<br />
<br />
That was where he and her had made out for the first time! Just remembering that almost boned Deion up, but he kept his composure around the girls and said, &quot;Uhh yeah, I&#39;m down for that. I&#39;m gonna head off, see you later, Kayla.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, he&#39;s pretty eloquent for a footballer.&quot;<br />
&quot;Yeah, doesn&#39;t use all that much slang. I heard he does surprisingly well in English.&quot;<br />
<br />
And with that, Deion left for school ahead of the girls, as soon as the traffic lights turned, and he thought about everything that had happened. He was gonna need to control that famously powerful libido of his with her. He sure didn&#39;t want to come off like he was just in this for sex. Sex was, sure, a large part of it, but he&#39;d like to try and re-establish some level of a relationship with Kayla. Do it right instead of fucking it up like he had before.<br />
<br />
Deion found himself once again sitting in first period and dealing with the usual; his old friends giving him death stares, and the fact that once again he was getting boned up. He tried to keep control of it, acknowledging that he would before long have to deal with this, but he would like to be able to do his schoolwork here before taking care of his bodily urges. He swore, even though the changes had stopped and he was now like this, he was still dealing with the vastly higher libido than usual.<br />
<br />
He looked around the classroom, trying to distract himself, and as the class went on he stifled a grunt as he dealt with his issue. Deion kind of wondered how long it&#39;d be before he got a handle on this and stopped having to rush to the bathroom as soon as he could. He swore he probably had a whole stall that&#39;d just look funny under a black light.<br />
<br />
Eventually, class ended and with a ten minute break between classes, Deion figured he could go ahead and take care of his business. Heading out of the class and slinging his backpack over his back, he wiped off some sweat from his forehead and left for the bathroom just outside the classroom. He breathed as he entered, looking around and heading for one of the stalls...<br />
<br />
...And then heard something that told him that he was not the only one to have this kind of an idea. Moans and stifled groans coming from inside of the stall next to the one he would be using. Just the sound of someone else getting off started to set Deion off as well. All the urges he&#39;d pushed down were starting to bubble up. He gulped and hurried into the designated stall, the other guy just across from him getting louder and more urgent even as Deion pushed his pants and boxers down.<br />
<br />
The black teen gulped and then wondered if it really was the change that made him so much more sensitive, or if he just started letting himself enjoy his sexuality. Even as he wrapped a hand around his generously sized shaft, it sounded like the other guy was done even as Deion was due to begin. Curiosity taking over, Deion stepped out of his pants legs and quietly moved over to try and get a look at who it was. He heard the stall door opening, and checked to make sure his own was locked.<br />
<br />
Peering out from the crack between the stall door and the wall, Deion watched as a different looking Dave exited the stall, shirtless and wearing just a pair of shorts, carrying his shirt with him. Instead of immediately putting it back on, Dave seemed to take the opportunity to flex, despite probably knowing there was someone in the other stall.<br />
<br />
And Deion could see that Dave indeed looked...different. The change that had happened to him was now happening to Dave it seemed, though it seemed it was slower moving in Dave. It had not taken very long for Deion to end up black, but a week after exposure and Dave looked like he was at least nicely tanned, more muscular in half a dozen ways, his gut starting to lean out and show a sweltering set of abs on his stomach. Dave&#39;s glutes were bigger and more visible in his shorts, and it seemed his hair was slightly darker in a few areas, his face looking slightly off too...<br />
<br />
...But it seemed Dave hardly seemed to notice, or seemed to appreciate what was happening to him without knowing where it was going. It was kind of a turn on watching the cocky Dave flex and preen for himself in the mirror. Deion pulled himself away though and went to continue and finish up his own indulgence in here. As usual, he was rather surprised by the sensuality and sheer arousal he was feeling, gasping and choking down moans as he jacked off.<br />
<br />
Deion found himself cumming into the toilet again, feeling his body tense as he shot his load. Ahh, now he could probably go a few periods before having to come back in here and do this again... Now, Deion thought about what to do going forward. He looked through, and saw Dave was still enjoying himself out there, flexing away. Should he try and warn Dave about this? Or just keep his distance and let the change become more evident before trying to say anything...</p>
