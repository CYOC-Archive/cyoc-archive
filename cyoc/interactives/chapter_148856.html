<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">There was a sudden warmth along your back where the beast sat as the back of your head. At first you thought it was the warmth of the wolf itself, but then that warmth became an almost burning tingle. It soon became unbearable and with a grimace you force yourself to your hands and knees. A jolt of pain shot through your body and you cried out in discomfort. What was really strange was that the wolf released a pained yelp as well. The wild canine was still on your back, now hunched over and straddling your body. The animal was so big that you were almost completely hidden beneath it. <br />
<br />
You move to pull yourself from underneath the wolf, but as you do the lupine is dragged backwards with you. That little bit of movement sends anther jolt through you as you nearly fall to the ground. You clenched your teeth. That almost felt good! The gray wolf whines, the noise almost sounding pleasured, before it tries to adjust it&#39;s footing. It takes a step forward and you are pulled along with it. The burning tingle becomes a dull numbness as you lose felling in your back and head. Something was wrong. Through clenched eyes you look down at your hands and gasped. white fuzz appeared to be sprouting over your arms. More alarming was that your fingers looked as though they were web! The digits appeared to be covered with skin; as you looked on in horror you witnessed your fingers on both hands beginning to fuse together, flesh and bone knitting as your hands became fleshy nubs! You felt a similar sensation at your feet.<br />
<br />
Just then your clothes began to fall off. Your clothing rapidly unraveled at the seams, disintegrating as it fell to the ground in bits and pieces. You were soon stark naked in the forest with a large gray wolf on your back. The aforementioned wolf abruptly flops to the ground, resting on it&#39;s right side and you found yourself upended as well. Scared and unable to process what was happening you began to throash wildly in an attempt to get up. Panting could be heard coming from the wolf before it began to whine. Without warning you barfed up a clear, viscous fluid. You were stunned by the sudden action and could not fail to miss that the pungent tasting fluid you choked up smelled of sex. You feel the wolf move a bit before it&#39;s head comes partly into view. It licks the side of your face, almost in a calming gesture, before it moves out of sight. The surrounding world soon starts to grow as it finally dawns on you. You were melding with the wolf! Beyond that, the wolf was a female, and you had just hacked up some of her vaginal fluid. You were transforming into the animal&#39;s vulva!<br />
<br />
Over the next several hours your body went under drastic changes. Your mouth grew to encompass much of your form. Your skin gradually changed in texture as white fur began to grow thick all over yourself. Your arms and legs have been reduced to limp, dangling stumps as they are drawn into and melded into your torso. Your hair had fallen out leaving your entire grotesque, quickly shrinking form bald save for the thin coat of short white hairs sprouting over your body, growing thicker by the moment. Your skeletal structure softened as your bones were dissolved into additional mass.  You were completely helpless as you were gradually were drawn up into the wolf&#39;s underbelly and rear. Your teeth receded into your gums, leaving your now soft toothless mouth only capable of making wet, disgusting smacking sounds. You began to salivate uncontrollably, only it was not saliva dripping from you lips...but something else.<br />
It was all so surreal. With terrible certainty you knew you were rapidly becoming one with the wolf. The conversion process progressed with startling speed. Your arms were gone, your ears were gone, and your head had fused with your torso as you quickly grew smaller and raised further into the air. With a final inward tug your head was pulled up and sank between the wolf&#39;s hind legs. Your lips involuntarily puckered, then pulled vertically into a perfect slit, and started to absorb your nose. Your face warped as your nose shrank. It moved south, slipping beneath the wet folds at the tip of your mouth and the she-wolf’s vulva, fusing with her clitoris. <br />
<br />
Your tongue wagged for the last few times before it dissolves, your taste buds migrating to the soft pink interior walls of the animal’s vestibule and vagina while the rest of the tongue liquefied and mixed with the sexual fluids you were presently salivating. As the clear fluid, pooled and dripped from your fur covered lips, you could do nothing more but watch and listen as it splattered on the grassy floor below. Never again would you utter a word. The tiny wet splats as your liquefied tongue dribbled from your mouth and dropped to the ground would be the last sound it ever made. In vain you tried to scream one last time as the final changes took place, your lips - now the she-wolf&#39;s outer folds - pulsed and twitched before they settled down into their new form and function. The female’s sexual fluid dripping from them, the pheromone laden flavor filling what now served as your mouth. <br />
<br />
The only human features remaining, were two small birth marks, arranged to resemble two terrified eyes. Located below the wolf&#39;s anus and flanking the wolf&#39;s pudendal cleft. What little else remained that was still remotely human was hidden away inside the female horse, warping and being integrated into its anatomy. Your organs were either broken down into superfluous tissue or re-purposed. Your heart and lungs disappeared as your respiratory and circulatory systems were replaced by the the wolf’s. Oxygen and blood being supplied by the wolf&#39;s own body. <br />
<br />
The core of your being was now the animal’s cervix and Fallopian tubes. Your penis disintegrated as your testicles shriveled to near nothingness before they were assimilated, absorbed and consumed by the wolf’s own ovaries. This was a particularly painful experience until your nerves and pain receptors melded with the animal’s. Your kidneys and bladder were merged into those belonging to the she-wolf as not only were you now the wolf&#39;s vulva, but it&#39;s entire reproductive system, and urinary tract. Your very DNA was eviscerated as it intertwined with the DNA of the canine. The she-wolf would not gain any human characteristics however. She would still be 99.99 percent canis lupus. The remaining .01 that was homo-sapiens male would be carried as random bits of genetic information within the female wolf&#39;s genetic code. <br />
<br />
By nightfall it was all over. The she-wolf lifted one of her hind legs and began to lick, cleaning her new vulva. Once satisfied the beast relinquished and lowered her leg before rolling to her feet. The she-wolf began walking, moving deeper into the forest. Her newly aquired vulva trembling under her tail. Uncertain what fate had in store for it.</p>
