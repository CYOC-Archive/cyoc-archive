<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The flash of light which came from the now broken shard filled the room and caused everyone to close their eyes to protect themselves. The light was so bright that even with their eyes closed the light got to them. Then it disappeared, when it did everyone slowly opened their eyes and were seeing stars as they looked around. <br />
<br />
“Ok…what the fuck was that?” inquired Barbara as Lindsay looked at her sister, however she was different, she looked not taller but more graceful. Her neck was longer, her blonde hair now almost glowed golden and her already large breasts seamed bigger, her white button down top she had been wearing had been replaced with a what looked like sports bra, but it seemed to be made out of multiple pieces of material like fish nets and scraps. <br />
<br />
Beside her Stacy had also changed her black hair turned even darker and silky with maybe a hint of purple in it. Like Barbara she had a longer neck, more graceful arms and what looked to be perfect skin. Her shirt changed as well to a dark purple top in the shape of an upside-down V with a collar around her neck which was also made of scraps of material. Her breast which where never as large as Barbara’s seamed to have grown as well. Her core seamed stronger as well but not as built as Barbara who had visible yet feminine six back.<br />
<br />
Lindsay’s hair had some how braided itself into a prefect braid and there was even some kind of crown mixed in her hair, her hair had also turned an impossible white. Her body also seamed to have the same general changes that hit her other friends, longer neck, more graceful frame and an increase in bust size. She wore a top which looked a lot like a swimsuit with a classy furl around the bottom edge around her breasts and a pair of straps which went up over her shoulders in light blue.<br />
<br />
She then turned her attention toward James, his blonde hair looked just as bright if not brighter then normal however the real change was that he was now shirtless, she had seen James shirtless when they all went to the pool so she knew he wasn’t overweight but now he looked like he had spent every moment possible in the pool, he looked like a professional swimmer. <br />
<br />
Then she looked at Oscar and her bush deepen, Oscar looked just as muscular as Oscar and his dark brown hair seamed better looking and his green eyes seamed to glow. <br />
<br />
“What is going on?” inquired Oscar as suddenly Lindsay lost her balance and fell backwards onto the couch. Moments later Oscar landed on top of her, they were latterly face to face and inches apart. <br />
<br />
“What is going on?” inquired Oscar again as they looked at each other.<br />
<br />
“I have no idea.”  Answered Lindsay as screams filled the air as both Oscar and Lindsay tried to stand up only to find their legs did not want to work, so they rolled off each other. And looked toward Elizabeth who was screaming, what they saw was impossible. <br />
<br />
She did not have legs anymore, instead her legs and merged together into a single limb which was now covered with light blue and white scales before spreading out into two white tail fines. Multiple small fins grew out of the tail. She was a mermaid.<br />
<br />
She looked around, Barbara now had golden and yellow scaled covered tail with yellow tail fins, Stacy had a purple and black tail with purple tail fins. Both had also become mermaids. James legs had also turned into a tail, with a mixture of white and gold, with a golden tail fin. She looked at Oscar to find his legs had also turned into a tail, with a mixture of Kelly green and dark forest green. Both had become merman just like the others had become mermaids.<br />
<br />
She looked at herself, she looked at her hands and noticed that they where now webbed with red webbing between each of her fingers. Her arms seamed thinner and more graceful; her blouse had been replaced with a dark red tub top with crises crossing straps which went over her neck. The top looked to be made from a mixture of seaweed and what looked to be netting of some kind with some seashells mixed in. She touched her neck and it felt longer and she almost gasped when she felt some slits open on the side of her neck.<br />
<br />
“Gills….” Said Lindsay as she looked at her legs, well now a tail, it was a deep dark red mixed in with some lighter red and some black. Her tail fins where bright red which made them stand out. She was a mermaid just like everyone else in the room. <br />
<br />
“We are mermaids.” Said Lindsay <br />
<br />
“WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON?” inquired Barbara as she looked around, four mermaids and two mermen where now in the living room of a house hours away from the nearest ocean.</p>
