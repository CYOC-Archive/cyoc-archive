<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ethan watched as his phone acted with a mind of its own. He was aware of the phone’s sliding around and adjusting parameters without his input but couldn’t process what was happening. He saw words, and sliders, and numbers, but didn’t understand their impact. Before anything major changed, Ethan felt a seeping cold enter his body. He looked down at his body and found himself totally naked. He was sitting on his bed in his room anyway, so nobody could see him, but he wasn’t fazed by this change – it was almost like it was totally normal to be naked while the app worked its magic.<br />
<br />
The first change that Ethan saw on his phone was the screen scrolling up by itself to the body hair section of his profile, and the keyboard popping up. Letter by letter, the words “little body hair, untrimmed” were erased, and a single word replaced it: “hirsute”. Ethan felt a warm, tingly sensation overtake his chest as quickly, a thick carpet of chest hair erupted from his skin, covering the front of his body from below his neck all the way down to his pubes.<br />
<br />
He moved one of his hands to start rubbing the chest hair, feeling the soft hairs on his stomach, and rubbing them in a swirl as the hairs spread on the rest of his body. His arms and his legs grew hairy too – not as much as his chest but certainly more than any average man, especially of his age. Even his ass grew furry, on his cheeks and around his hole.<br />
<br />
That was only his first change. This app was far from complete from Ethan’s reprogramming. Keeping things basic, it slid up to the top of his profile. It clicked his height first and slid the slider up from 5’10 to 6’3. Ethan sat up a bit straighter on the edge of his bed as his body reached new proportions, one hand still rubbing his now very hairy chest. The app opened the box one below it, weight, and slid it up to a hefty 280 pounds. A sub-option, previously left blank, was then clicked for body type. The keyboard reopened, and the letters clicked on his screen to spell out “bulky muscle”. Ethan readjusted his posture again as his body started to pack on pounds. He felt stronger as his body expanded, feeling it from his hand on his chest. His chest popped into two very hairy but meaty pecs, but his stomach grew in size to match it. It was by no means all fat, but Ethan was certainly not the owner of a lean body.<br />
<br />
The next slider that the phone selected was age, as it quickly slid his profile’s 4 years of age to 43 years old. The effect of aging took over his body as some of his hairs started to turn gray and his skin weathered a bit. His face displayed the most prominent changes as it lost its youth and developed some wrinkles. The hairline on his scalp started receding as the hairs turned gray, but the phone quickly fixed that when it scrolled to the hair color box and replaced the text with “gray, but shaved bald to the scalp”. Ethan’s head reflected these new changes as the head on his hair seemed to evaporate, leaving behind a shiny dome.<br />
<br />
The changes that came with his age and weight even seemed to transfer to the room, as it tidied itself up and the belongings started to shift from a freshly-out-of-college age man’s materials to that of an established man in his early forties. He watched, completely unbothered, as the clothing in his closet changed to smarter clothing with better fits, and the belongings on his shelf changed: more books, less video games. The windows also shifted, no longer was he in an apartment building, this was clearly a house that he now owned.<br />
<br />
The app was hardly done describing his new body though, as it scrolled to some other physical features. It scrolled down to his foot size, and selected the scroll wheel, sliding his modest size 9s to a size 12W. Ethan felt a warm expansion as his feet grew to their new size, he wiggled his toes in response. He didn’t have much time to experience his new feet though, as his cellphone scrolled down to the description of his manhood.<br />
<br />
Ethan had previously been slightly above average, but the slider scrolled up his penis length to a hefty 8 and a half inches. He was no porn star, but whoever was on the receiving end of his cock was certainly in for a good time. With his free hand he quickly acted on the urge to grab his penis as it grew in his hand, both in size from the app’s magic and because it was getting hard. As Ethan played with his cock, the app made a subtle adjustment to his ball size, making them larger and hang lower. Ethan let out a deep “oof” as he literally felt his balls drop, but quickly forgot about any sensation that he’d received.<br />
<br />
Ethan watched, one hand massaging his now engorged cock, as the phone slid back up to the top of the screen. A box he had previously paid no mention to was clicked: facial hair. The “clean shaven” text was selected and erased in one fell swoop, as the keyboard typed out a new style for his face: “dense circle beard with heavy stubble on sideburns”. Similarly to before, Ethan felt an eruption of hairs grow from his face as a very thick goatee framed his mouth, going down to his chin and stopping at the perfect length to not be considered a neckbeard. The hairs at the bottom of the chin had mixed in with them some silvery gray hairs.<br />
<br />
He pulled his hand away from his cock and stroked his face. This new hair was coarser than the hair on his furry chest and belly, but still felt nice to touch. He stroked it, as a dense stubble filled on his cheeks, stopping just above his ears where his bald head began. In the back of his mind, new memories were woven into his brain on how to maintain his new look.<br />
<br />
The app continued to work its magic as it scrolled all the way to the top of the page, selecting his name. Letter by letter, Ethan’s name was erased from the box, as it exited his mind entirely. He wasn’t worried, not even acknowledging that he temporarily had no name. The keyboard clacked as a new name was entered in the box and Russell found himself comfortable with his new identity, not even aware that mere seconds ago he hadn’t had this name his entire life.<br />
<br />
Russell’s phone was not finished with him, despite the new name. The machine scrolled down to the tattoos and piercings section and started to liberally fill in the previously blank boxes. Specific mentions weren’t made for the most part, but the machine typed out that he had a full sleeve on one arm, and a chest and ass tattoo. As it finished typing, Russell felt a pleasant buzz across his body as he looked over at his arm. A lot was going on. From the wrist all the way up to the shoulder, intricate designs of ink filled in on his hairy skin. There were several things intermingles together: a gear, a tree, a beer bottle. It was a work of art. He felt another pleasant tingle on his left pec, a picture of a mountain over his heart. A bear claw with the bear pride colors also appeared on his right asscheek, accentuated by the fur on it.<br />
<br />
In the piercings section, his mysterious benefactor only typed out two characters into the box: “;)”. Russell looked it over in his blank state when suddenly he moaned out loud, involuntarily, his manly voice ringing through the air of his room as his cock demanded his attention once more. He quickly grabbed his shaft in his meaty paw, and fondled it softly as a new piercing made its way through the cockhead. It didn’t hurt, and he started rubbing it in place, getting pleasure from the feeling of the huge Prince Albert on his head. Despite being rock hard and actively stimulating it, he couldn’t cum – not that it was on his mind. <br />
<br />
The app quickly slid down to the fetishes section while Russell was distracted playing with the new jewel in his huge cock. There was room for detail, but the previous statement of “I’m a pretty vanilla guy, but haven’t tried a ton!” message was quickly erased by a short and to the point message. “Leather. Dominance. Feet.” Russell tilted his head back as he felt compelled to let go of his cock. Upon letting go, instead of finally coming, he felt his meaty package get wrapped up in a leather jockstrap. His throbbing erection against the pouch of his strap left nothing to the imagination. He sat up on the bed again, paying attention to his phone once more as a pair of wool socks rose up on his feet, before swiftly becoming encased in a pair of leather boots to match his new big feet.<br />
<br />
The app, seemingly satisfied with the new Russell, slid down to the final box which had been empty the entire time, About Me. It quickly chattered away a profile for the man, the tone of which was being engrained into his brain with every typed word.<br />
<br />
“Proud gay bear. Not just looking to get my dick wet tonight, but hoping to find my husbear out there. Love lifting, hiking, and generally keeping active. If you aren’t serious don’t fucking waste my time. Hung top, don’t be a bitch about it.”<br />
<br />
Russell smirked, looking over his profile, as a second message came up. “Your chatroom with your partner is ready!” with the only option to click OK. Russell clicked the prompt as it connected him to a chatroom with his match.</p>
