<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ty surveyed his body and face, he looked like a young teenager with a completely built body, which kind of creeped him out... but it did give him an idea.  &quot;I wonder... can I change my age?  Or other peoples memories of me?&quot;  something was brewing in that head of his.  He thought out the words that he would use to express what he wanted to wish next.  He stepped out of the bathroom with his 9 inch cock swaying back and forth.  His muscles rubbed by each other with each step, and it felt amazing.<br />
  <br />
  He stepped into the kitchen and made himself a milkshake.  He decided that he hated high school, and wanted to be out of it, but he wanted to experience college.  He wanted to know everything he should have learned before then as well, and with that, he made his wish.  &quot; I wish that I would age to twenty years old, starting with how I look now.  I also wish that everyone remembers me passing high school, and going off to college, and that I know all about the subjects I take there.&quot;  He took a big gulp of his milkshake, and awaited the changes.  He began to feel warm.  He walked over to the living room mirror to watch his handywork.  First, his height changed.  He grew inch by inch, starting at 5'7&quot;, than 5'8&quot;, 9, 10... soon he was six feet tall.  His face altered in shape, becoming slightly more angular in appearence... he was handsome too.  Small hairs trailed up his crotch to his navel and his chest sprouted a few as well.  He took another gulp and kept watching, intrigued.  His dick lengthened by another inch and was done.<br />
  <br />
  Something strange happened.  Ty watched his abs smoothing over, and his beefy chest becoming more soft.  'I must have experienced the freshman 15...' he thought, but soon it had become the freshman 20, then 25, then 30.  Ty realized what was happening.  He looked over at the milkshake in his hand and realized he was still drinking from it's straw.  Essentially, the wish fooled his body into thinking he was drinking a milkshake 24/7 for the 5 year difference in his age.  He looked down at his stomach which was swelling considerably, it on it's own looked like a freshman 50.  He looked into the mirror as he became more and more dumpy.  He wished for a scale quickly, it appeared, and he stepped on it.  260 lbs flashed at him, and it was climbing steadily.<br />
  265, 270, 275, 280...  <br />
  <br />
  Ty wasn't just getting fat, he was getting obese!  He looked around his body watching his sides pile up with jiggling masses of fat, he could feel his ass wobbling as he moved about.  His chest became like jell-o, sagging onto his ample stomach.<br />
 320, 325, 330, 335, 340...<br />
<br />
  He was inflating with jiggly, bouncing fat, second by second his body went off balance as his stomach shifted most of his weight forward.  He passed by 400 pounds in only a few seconds.  He felt his thighs squish together and his arms pressed softly against his sides.  He tried to pull the shake away from his mouth, but he couldn't, and he couldn't stop drinking.  <br />
<br />
  430, 440, 450, 460...<br />
<br />
  Then, the last few drops of the shake filtered into his mouth.  He wasn't done yet though.  He stood helpless as his body widened before him, his belly sagging over his cock and balls, as well as his crotch building up fat making his now 10 inch dick look stubbier and shorter.  It looked like it did before he first changed.  Soon his stomach heaved down over his dick, and when coupled with his boobs, his body seemed somewhat genderless.<br />
<br />
  500, 550, 600, 650...<br />
<br />
  'How fat could a person get on only milkshakes over 5 years?!'  He thought.  700 passed by quickly, and soon he was 750.  He watched helplessly as his body packed on it's last few pounds.  <br />
<br />
  780, 782, 783, 784.....<br />
<br />
  Ty stood as a fat, heaving mass, trying to hold himself up...  He w as huge!  Way bigger than Mark, but it wasn't a bad thing.  It was just different, and warm.  'I wish I had the strength to move right now....'  And suddenly, he did.  Ty got up with complete ease, he waddled back from the mirror in order to see his entire body, but he couldn't, he took up too much space.  Now he was tired... too tired to think.  He laboured up the stairs to his bedroom, his body jiggling the entire way.  He had to squeeze through the door, which took quite a long time, and sat slowly upon his bed.  It groaned and the wooden frame fell through.  The mattress hit the ground with a deafening thud, but it was no matter to Ty.  He Lay down and fell asleep.......<br />
<br />
  The next morning he awoke, he had slept nearly 24 hours.  Being so fat completely wiped him out...  He slid from the bed, jiggling again.  He used all his strength to stand again and saw that there was a large breakfast on his desk.  It had a note from June on it &quot;I see you broke your bed again!  We'll buy you a metal one this afternoon.&quot;  Ty shrugged and looked around his room, spying something on the wall.  A large certificate hung there with the Guiness worlds records insignia on it.  &quot;This certificate is awarded to Ty Brahms.  World Record Holder for the most weight gained in only a few years.  5 years and 600 pounds later, this should be a hard record to beat, Ty!&quot;  Ty looked down at his enormous body, which seemed even fatter than the day before.  Soon, Dustin walked into the room, still only looking like he was 13.<br />
<br />
  &quot;Ty, mom and dad left before I got to eat.  Can I have some of your breakfast?&quot;  He asked kindly.  Ty looked at him strangely, Dustin was never nice.... but then again he was never the younger brother.  &quot;Sure little fella.&quot;  Ty said.   Dustin didn't seem to care that Ty was nude, he casually mentioned it  &quot;I guess you put on more weight at college, none of your clothes fit you anymore, right?&quot;  Ty nodded &quot;Yeah, all that food out there sure is fattening... &quot;  he thought to himself  &quot;I better fix this weight soon... these people are making it seem like I'm not going to stop getting bigger.&quot;  Dustin took a few gulps of his food.  &quot;And you're going back to the residence tomorrow?&quot;  he sounded somewhat dissappointed  &quot;Yep, sorry kid.&quot; Ty said, suddenly understanding that Dustin looked up to him.<br />
<br />
  Ty left dustin to his food and waddled back into the bathroom.  The place where his true adventure started.  He looked in the mirror, lifting his stomach and looking at his dick, which had dissappeared into his groin.  He looked at the toilet, which was re-inforced with steel pipes, as was the shower... not that he could fit in the standing shower anyways.  Tomorrow he would start his next term in college, apparently in an illustration program.  This was his life now, and there was no turning back... but he was at a cross-roads.  Should he lose the weight, or stay fat?  June had never made him breakfast before, and usually mark was too cheap to buy him a shirt let alone a new bed....  Did they like him more like this?</p>
