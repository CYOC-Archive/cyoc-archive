<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ryan had an idea, and said, &quot;You know, Cy, you've got a nice body.  It's got a lot of potential. I bet I could help get your physique on the path to being a real muscle stud.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Me?  A musclestud?&quot; Cy said out loud.  Then he thought at Ryan, &quot;How?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Put me on. Put on your gym clothes.  Let me guide you through a proper workout.  How about now?  I know you've got a gym membership, if you don't want to use the school gym.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How do you know?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dude, don't you think I noticed you staring at me when I was lifting weights last Sunday. You were wearing a fucking pink leotard!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I - it's not what you think. Maybe it is what you think, fuck I hate having you read my thoughts. Still you sure do know how to make a muscle stud,&quot; Cy replied rubbing his jaw thoughtfully, &quot;You'd make a very personal trainer.&quot;<br />
<br />
He quickly changed into his gym gear.  Ryan could sense Cy's sudden eagerness.  While he was pleased that his plan was working better than he'd hoped, a sense of trepidation filled him at spending more time wrapped around this handsome sweet smelling man's cock. Shaking his head to try to clear his mind wasn't an option with Cy's junk filling Ryan's pouch/head. The shaking movement was merely the natural pendular movement as Cy jogged in his gym clothes to the gym. With all his books, and street clothes stashed in his backpack, Cy was working up a lot more sweat than normal.<br />
<br />
Cy could feel Ryan's trained mind exercising control helping Cy to set his pace. He felt his stride adjust under Ryan's guidance.  The calm of Ryan's intense focus on the goal helped. Ryan visualized a more muscularly developed version of Cy, and shared this image with Cy.  It was strangely erotic. Cy was getting hard just visualizing the image that Ryan had made of him.  A six pack of abs, a broader chest, muscled guns and thighs --it all seemed to be within his grasp with Ryan wrapped around him.<br />
<br />
Cy lost himself in Ryan's focus. He moved from machine to machine working out in the gym.  He barely remembered signing in. He had finished the regimen that Ryan had chosen for him, and was sitting on the bench press drenched in sweat and breathing heavily.  He glanced at the clock and his eyes went wide. He'd been working out non-stop for over 4 hours. Ryan absorbed his sweat, and found himself enjoying drinking in part of Cy's essence. He let Cy resume total control as he relaxed.  Ryan hadn't moved his muscles, but he felt exhausted all the same from all his mental focus.<br />
<br />
His stomach rumbled.  He'd missed dinner. He licked his lips recalling that gym sold energy bars. Then he realized he hadn't called his mother.  She'd probably freak. Even though he was an 18 year old senior, he was still a high school student. He went to his bag and dug out 50 cents. Then he found the pay phone and keyed his home number.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, Ma, sorry I didn't call sooner.  A friend is helping me get into a workout routine, and I lost track of time...,&quot; blurted out Cy as soon as his mother answered.<br />
<br />
There was a pause as he listened. She wanted to know who he was with and where he was. He told her that Ryan was a top athlete at his school and today had volunteered to help Cy develop a workout program. That they both had memberships at the same gym, and that's where they were.<br />
<br />
Initially, his mother's voice sounded of relief tinged with anger.  Then to Cy's surprise, she said, &quot;Cy, I'm glad you've gotten yourself a good friend, and that you're started to workout again. Just be home by ten. And next time call me first before you decide to workout late.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure thing, Ma, thanks for understanding.&quot;<br />
<br />
Oh, fuck, dude, she thinks you've got a boyfriend. She thinks I'm your boyfriend! Ryan's mind screamed.<br />
<br />
Cy chuckled. His mind tried to supress the thought, but enough leaked out to scare Ryan.  Maybe he was Cy's boyfriend now. What was it coach was always saying...something stupid.  Ah yes, &quot;A boy's bestfriend is his jock.&quot; Ryan was Cy's best friend, maybe that translated to boyfriend. Ry and Cy, thought Ryan, after a long workout, Ryan was feeling a lot more comfortable with Cy's hot sweaty body inside him. Damn, he could use a sauna.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, a sauna sounds good,&quot; Cy was resting with his head between his legs on the locker room bench.  He added under his breath, &quot;Ry.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ryan swallowed.  The pouch constricted, and Cy's junk started to swell.  Damn, Ry hadn't felt like that since he'd been on his first date with a girl. Was this his first date with a guy?<br />
<br />
Cy chuckled and headed to the sauna wearing only his workout shorts and jockstrap.  He carried his towel with him.  Ryan was expecting to be absorbing a more concentrated essence of Cy before the night was over. Cy could sense Ry mentally licking his lips.<br />
<br />
Cy noticed some other people in the locker room, so he didn't speak aloud.  He thought, boy, Ry, if I knew you'd go all the way on a first date, I might have gotten to know you sooner.<br />
<br />
Ry felt a flash of intense anger.  He wasn't gay.  Not really.  It was Vinnie's fault. He was a jockstrap - a living jockstrap - so it was natural that he would want a cock inside him.  He wondered if he's still want Cy's junk inside him when Vinnie turned him back into a man. Right now, he felt certain that he would.  He would never forget Cy's rich sweet muskiness or the taste...  If Vinnie could really turn him back, if Vinnie would really turn him back.<br />
<br />
Hey, Ry, I'll make sure that Vinnie changes you back like he promised. I'm looking forward to you putting your junk in me.  If you want my junk in you, I bet we could 69.<br />
<br />
It was then that Ry realized not only had Cy heard all his thoughts, but that Ryan's fabric body had repeatedly tightened and relaxed working the contents of his pouch into a full hard-on as if he'd just beaten Cy off.<br />
<br />
Cy spread out his towel and laid down in silence in the hot cedar lined room.  It was nearly nine, and the Sauna was empty.  Lately, most guys were using the steam room anyway. Cy and Ry lay there in silence for at least 5 minutes.  This seemed like an eternity.<br />
<br />
Then...</p>
