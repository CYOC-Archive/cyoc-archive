<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">She turned the page onto a pencil sketch of a lithe elven woman. She was the very epitome of the word graceful, tall and slender and curvaceous. She was clearly unashamed of the fact, as her attire was rather scandalous. The maiden wore only a loincloth held fast by a delicate metal belt and a brassiere that cupped her bust and sported a dramatic mantle that rested on her shoulder. She also sported intricate bracers laced with writing and anklets around her feet.<br />
<br />
She was suspended in a helix-shaped pillar of magical energy that was flowing like water around her body and lifted up her waist length braided hair. She seemed to be mid casting of some great spell or ritual, as she pulled on strands of the magic with her long, slender digits. Arcane light pulsed from beneath her half-shut eyelids, rimmed with dark eyeshadow.<br />
<br />
Leah was transfixed on the image, for reasons that she couldn’t quite place, this particular drawing was incredibly alluring. She shifted and folded her legs as she felt her sex growing slick and a heat building in the pit of her stomach. For a brief moment, she checked her phone clock and looked over her shoulder to see if her roommate was going to be showing herself soon. “About an hour ‘til she’s getting back…” she muttered to herself.<br />
<br />
“To hell with it.” She walked over to her bed and lay prone. With one hand she lifted the hem of her sweats, with the other, she slowly began traveling down her body, and teased her womanhood, she bit her lip to push down a moan, she shut her eyes. <br />
<br />
————<br />
And when she opened them again, she was elsewhere. She felt her back going from resting on a lumpy mattress to resting on a cold marble floor. She was no longer looking at a plain white ceiling, but at a vaulted pitched wooden roof with tall, airy rafters. She felt a light breeze on her face, and immediately she shot upright with a jolt. Her eyes flicked side to side in a panic as she tried to make sense of her surroundings. Immediately, her attention was grabbed by the sound of footsteps tracking over the marble floors. To her surprise, she was approached by a regal looking fox with lustrous orange and black fur, more surprising, it spike to her in the voice of an adult woman.<br />
<br />
“My lady! You’re here so soon! This wasn’t what I expected at all, but no matter. I’ve had but a brief three years to prepare the tower to your liking, but I’ve just about brought it to a satisfactory condition.” The fox walked up in front of her and sat expectantly. “I’m yours to command my liege, where would you like to begin your introductions?” <br />
<br />
Her first reaction was to scurry away from the fox and gasp in shock.<br />
<br />
The creature looked down in disappointment. “Does my form offend my lady? I was informed this was one of your favorite animals. I can become another, if she prefers?”<br />
<br />
“Who are you? Where am I? How’d I get here?” Leah stammered out the questions in quick succession, as soon as she managed to stop hyperventilating enough to get them out. She took in more of her surroundings. It was evident this was a half-circular room that served as an opulent study with ceiling high shelves of books and scrolls. There were also large, plush padded armchairs with soft cushions and pillows. “It’s… really pretty I’ll admit.”<br />
<br />
“Of course, my lady.” The fox began.<br />
<br />
“Just Leah, please…” Leah asked.<br />
<br />
“Ah! Rather modest of you. Very well Leah, though decorum should demand otherwise, I shall try to make you comfortable.” The fox stood up and posed herself with pride. “I am Elisthia, your sorcerous familiar. Among other duties, I keep your tower in order, and if I may say, I’m so very grateful to hear it’s to your liking!” Elisthia trotted around the room and sat in one of the chairs. “And… as for why you’re here… I admit I don’t know precisely why you’re here *now*, as I said I was expecting wasn’t expecting you so soon… but this tower, the surrounding landscape, and me, you created them Leah! You gave birth to this place, and now, you may finally reap what you’ve sown!” Elisthia hopped excitedly. <br />
<br />
“That’s… a lot to take in.” Leah wondered. “Fuck me, this sounds like some Isekai bullshit.”<br />
<br />
“I beg your permission to be candid Leah, but it’s your imagination after all.” The fox answered.<br />
<br />
“That’s fair, I set myself up for that.” She admitted. “Wait! If this is my… fantasy becoming real does that mean?”<br />
<br />
“Ah yes. Your transformation into an elf. That will be any minute now. Would you like me to afford you some privacy for that, Leah?”<br />
<br />
Leah felt the lingering tremors of pleasure in her loins flair up again, stronger this time. “Uh.. yeah, yes please. That’d be a good idea.”<br />
<br />
“But of course, mistress. I’ll be in the foyer when you have need of me.”<br />
<br />
  Leah looked down at herself and processed what she’d been told. She pictured the sorceress she drew in her mind once again, and immediately her mind filled with anticipation and apprehension. A part of her feared having been torn from her home, possibly never to return. On the other, could she really have hoped for a better fate than this?<br />
<br />
She soon had no time to question it as she felt herself getting pulled upward in a great, swirling vortex of multicolored lights. Leah wound up floating on the current, and as soon as she was locked in, she gasped as her body flooded with sensation. As the light engulfed her, it seared away all her clothes. From socks to hoodie, she was left stark naked, and everywhere the light touched her skin it tingled incredibly pleasantly. Leah writhed and shook from the sensation as she hugged herself tightly while the magic reshaped her. Any scars, stretch marks, or skin conditions Leah was covering up were washed away, leaving healthy, youthful flesh behind. She cupped her breasts in her hands and panted with excitement as she found them growing in her hands, and the feeling was indescribable. She blushed dark red as she came on the spot from how good it felt to massage her nipples and knead her breasts. It followed into another, equally intense orgasm as her thick thighs and wide hips were elevated to another scale of voluptuousness. Her fingers feverishly administered to her sex as heat flashed through her loins up her spine and through her outermost extremities. Her rear turned plump and pillowy as it expanded to balance out her frame with the enlarged bosom, her frame was also evened out as she had a rapid growth spurt in height, rising from five and a half to well over six and a half feet. <br />
<br />
Leah squinted as a dusky dark eyeshadow and equally glamorous lipstick and blush dusted her facial features. Her eyes began to glow bright and luminous as the magic that was changing her, as their irises went from a soft brown to vibrant amber. After coming down from her orgasms, she shook out her long, silken hair that had shifted from light brown to raven black. Leah giggled as she felt it brush her bottom and braid itself into various artful knots as it tumbled down her back. By now, the anxiety she felt had melted. She was radiant, she was glorious, she was everything she’d ever aspired to be. She moaned low and husky as the best part of the change came last. Her ears began to be sculpted like clay as they swooped upward, tapering into long, majestic points. Leah reached up tentatively to test and, yes, her breath hitched and she smirked with joy as a shiver of erogenous pleasure shook all the way to the pit of her stomach. She giggled happily, the idea of elf ears being erotic zones was always a major turn on for her. She giddily massaged her pointed ears as they fluttered and flushed rosy on the sides of her head. It was enough for her to ride out one parting orgasm, as the magic subsided and locked her elven form in. As a final act, the magic shrouded her in a two piece loincloth and breast wrapping as the drawing promised, and the spell graced her with elegant bracelets, a golden necklace, and various rings and ear piercings as a parting gift before setting the elf down on her feet.<br />
————-<br />
The door swung open as the sorceress strutted out of her study to survey her tower.<br />
<br />
“Leah, my mistress! I must say, elvendom suits you! Why, you’re positively glowing.” Elisthia beamed with pride. <br />
<br />
“Thank you Elisthia, but please, call me Leahala instead. Lady Leahala, arch sorceress of the Tower of Findolaf.”<br />
<br />
“But of course my lady! Now, I must tell you, the tower awaits your command. What is your first act as its mistress?”</p>
