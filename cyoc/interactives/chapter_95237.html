<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dan recited the ancient text, his words humming through whatever simulated as his voice box. Each word was like a slow and low vibration that further aroused and teased the siblings, Kat wiggled on the bed. Her nipples were hard and erect, all eight of them. Dan struggled to complete the spell, gasping on his own words. His droning incantation began to become garbled, his lips became swollen, clit erect and distracting. His speaking became unintelligible, labia overflowing with wetness. Kat moaned and tweaked her nipples, dropping the book in the process. Dan had collapsed on shaky needs and Kat moved forward, gathering Dan in her arms and feeding him her fingers. Kat had lost all control of her body, doing what she felt was natural in her hyper aroused state. She fingered herself, masturbating because she felt the need to. Dan was thrown to the background, assaulted by his sisters mauling hands. His legs went limp, allowing himself be to used.<br />
<br />
Kat moaned in unison to Dans muffled cries of pleasure, she dragged herself over. The feeling of all eight of her breasts mashing against his bare thighs, sent him over the edge, Dan climaxed. Dans vision blacked out, everything became slightly spotty and he panted. Kat collapsed against him, her breasts still pressed up against him. His arousal had only slightly diminished, as well as Kats own. Through their shared climax however they gained clarity.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh god...we didn&#39;t finish the spell...what happened!?&quot; Dan spoke through pants. Kat just absentmindley ground her body against him, causing him to pant harder.<br />
<br />
&quot;I...I forgot...to mention another spell....I..erggh...cast when along with the ....ugh..sensations one&quot; She moaned out. Dan needed Kat to be clear headed, and letting her molest herself was not what was needed right now. Struggling, trying hard to ignore the sensations of his slick thighs and legs squirmed out of Kats reach. Falling upon the floor with a thud, he scrambled into a spread eagle position. Knees in the air exposing his pussy towards Kat. <br />
<br />
&quot;Kat...tell me please...what was the other spell&quot; Dan asked slowly, trying not to stimulate them further. Kat blushed, and looked away before answering in a small voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;I kind of cast an...perpetual arousal spell.....&quot; She muttered. <br />
<br />
&quot;You what!&quot; Dan yelled, a spittle of their cum blasted forth to the floor. Kat wriggled upon the bed.<br />
<br />
&quot;I did it for you! if you were going to be my cunt, you should at least have fun...I didnt want you to get bored...besides it wasnt supposed to be forever...only until I changed you back...now everything is all....screwed up severely.&quot; Kat bemoaned. Dan just shook his hips in frustration.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wouldn&#39;t be in this predicament in the first place if you learned not to be such a brat!&quot; Dan argued.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey! You&#39;re the one that caused us to get stuck!&quot; Kat fought back.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re the one that decided to turn me into your twat in the first place! how fucked up is that...and all the things we just did...and a while ago!...I cant ever forget that...&quot; Dan spoke harshly. Kat just smirked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whatever, besides it&#39;s not like you&#39;re my brother anymore...even mom sees you as only my pussy...which, is kind of wierd but...it doesnt really matter you&#39;re not my brother...you&#39;re my cunt&quot; She pointed out, if Dan had visible eyes he would be glaring at her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck you!&quot; He yelled, storming out of her room. Dan was livid, the spell was a crapshoot. He had been getting along with his sister for a brief moment, only to suddenly lose it when she revealed her further treachery. Something was seriously wrong with that girl, and now here he was stuck as her sentient disembodied pair of legs. She was not even concerned about him in the slightest, wondering if the spell would truly restore him and not just give her back full control. Dan could not trust Kat, maybe later on he could or she would change. However at the moment, he was very wary of anything his sister offered. <br />
<br />
Dan sighed deeply, a shiver flicked down his body. Grinding his pussy lips together in a frown, every action served to arouse them. Dan became furious again, stomping his way towards his room.<br />
<br />
When he came to the open door of his room however he was shocked to find it dramatically changed, where is room used to be now sat an office. His bed was gone, his posters, music, stereo and all of his possesions were simply gone. A large computer desk, office chair and an entertainment center sat in its place. Dan stared in horror, what had happened to his room?<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh...Dan? what are you doing out of Kats room? Did you need to use the bathroom?&quot; Dans mother asked, carrying a load of laundry.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom...what...what happened to my room?&quot; Dan, slightly mortified at talking to his mother in his lewd diminished form. Dans mom frowned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why would you need a room?&quot; She asked obliviously.<br />
<br />
&quot;Because I...&quot; Dan trailed off<br />
<br />
&quot;look at you, you&#39;re all wet...I swear that girl and her hormones sometimes.&quot; his mother chided.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom...look at me!&quot; Dan yelled in frustration.<br />
<br />
&quot;yeah...is there something wrong? do you have a yeast infection...is Kat on her period?&quot; She asked. Dan just cringed.<br />
<br />
&quot;No...no!&quot; Dan moaned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then what?...she&#39;s..she&#39;s not pregnant is she?&quot; she asked with a gasp. Dan nearly gagged.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course not!&quot; he blurted out. His labia becoming slick with wetness once again, droplets of his dew fell to the floor and made rivulets down his smooth thighs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good, I taught her better than that, I&#39;ll not have her parading you around for boys just for kicks...you could get a nasty STD&quot; Dans mom explained. Dan was growing more and more uncomfortable as the discussion progressed. <br />
<br />
&quot;Mom...I&#39;m your son right?&quot; Dan asked slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well of course&quot; She smiled, Dan breathed a sigh of relief.<br />
<br />
&quot;But you need to learn that Kat has needs, and since you are her vagina you&#39;ll need to fulfill them...&quot; She said with conviction.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait...if i&#39;m her Vagina and your son...then what the hell am I!?&quot; Dan sputtered in anger.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dan...language! show me some respect!...you&#39;re special darling, but more importantly..you&#39;re what makes Kat a woman...she needs you honey. And I need you to take responsibility and start acting more mature.&quot; Dan just stared at his mother in awe.<br />
<br />
&quot;Go back to her room this instant, and get cleaned up...you&#39;re practically soaking the carpet.&quot; She hissed. grabbing his pert nude ass cheeks and pushing him in the direction of Kats room.</p>
