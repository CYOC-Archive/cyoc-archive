<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">-Begin Journal Entry-<br />
<br />
I just realized something. I spent the last journal entry talking about Rasler... You know, how awesome he was and how great he looked. Not only is that awkward, but it’s sad. I mean, I even ignored myself in a journal entry that was supposed to be about me. My adviser also said for me to describe myself, just so I could read it over a few weeks from now and see how I view myself compared to the entry. I guess it’s like a secret self esteem test. If I say &quot;baw I’m ugly!&quot; then I fail the test. Anyway, where to start? I already mentioned I’m a nerd, but that’s extremely misleading…<br />
<br />
If I told you I was a nerd, you’d look me over and laugh. I was lean for a nerd and wasn’t all pimply or did anything considered socially-awkward. I stand a around six feet tall, so I have a decently sized body that’s good for swimming and running. This is precisely why I joined the swim team and the track team. I don’t have a perfectly sculpted body like a certain someone I know, but you can sort of see my abdomen muscles and when I flex, some meat pops up on my bones. I guess I have an average build for an eighteen year old. I’m also quite hairless, though I shave my under arms and private areas just because having body hair makes me feel dirty for some reason. My hair is a sandy type of blonde and it falls down to my shoulders. I usually keep it in a ponytail to keep it out of the way, and it seems to compliment my face just fine. My eyes are a pretty sky blue. I like my eyes, and I think they look better with my frameless classes hovering over them. <br />
<br />
Just a story out of the blue: When I went with Rasler for that model shoot, a woman engaged me in a conversation. Well, first she took off my glasses and began tilting my head from side to side. She looked me up and down before speaking to me in with an unidentifiable accent. She said, “Hm, your body lacks definition and your face is handsome, but not masculine enough! Who chose you to be a model for the swim wear?” Then she looked me over once more and stops right where my crotch was. I was wearing jeans that day, so... Well, you know. She began speaking again, this time she sounded pleased rather than disappointed. &quot;Oh I see, you are here for the other photo shoot. I still say you are not masculine enough, but it is hard to find males who are endowed enough to be a certain kind of model. Are you a Speedo model or an underwear model?&quot;<br />
<br />
After that day, I had a little pep in my step. I guess that was one of my greater assets. I never really boasted or made it apparent, but at least I knew I had SOMETHING over most of the guys at my school. Either way, I can honestly say that I’d be at least a 7/10 on the hot-or-not meter… Eh, I think I’m going to look back on this journal entry and think that I’m really weird for talking about myself like this.<br />
<br />
-End Journal Entry-<br />
<br />
<br />
Rasler had gotten out of the hospital since there was really no reason for him to be there. Rasler had today off, while I had school. I suppose his parents were still in shock that he almost got hit, and just wanted him to stay home. I was at my home too, but I was getting ready to leave for school. I quickly did my whole morning routine. Hopping in the shower, drying my hair afterwards, brushing my teeth and then getting dressed before heading down for some breakfast. Today’s routine was different. I blame that magic eight ball. I was still curious about it, and I just had to get at least a few questions out of that outlandish woman. I dove into yesterday’s pants pocket to retrieve the wretched thing. I peered into the looking glass, and before I knew it, I had some chick sitting on my bed. Sadly enough, this will probably be the only time I ever have a woman in my room, let alone on my bed. <br />
<br />
&quot;Good morning. I see you are getting ready for school.&quot; She curtly said, looking displeased for some reason.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah I am... Uh, what’s with the attitude?&quot; I asked, wondering if I offended her somehow.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, for starters, you made only two wishes! My previous owners made at least ten within a twenty-four hours. Now that you’re going to school, I know there will be no more wishes for a few hours as well. I’m quite bored, to say the least.&quot; She explained, crossing her arms while shooting me a dirty look.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh... I uh... Didn’t know. I guess you actually LIKE granting wishes. May I ask a few questions?&quot; I asked, even though it was redundant to ask her if I could ask her a question.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course.&quot; She replied, relaxing slightly.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know when you did that second wish thing? Well, everyone forgot what happened except Rasler... What’s up with that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, everyone forgets what a person looked like or what happened to them before the change took place. However, the person who has something changed about them will think that they just had a strange dream or some such, while accepting the new change as if they were like that to begin with.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;In other words, if I made a midget eight feet tall, he’d act like he was always eight feet tall, but would think that he was actually a midget at one point? They think it’s was a vivid dream or something because it can’t be true if that’s not what they see.&quot; I tried to make sense of it all. I suppose I have to be careful about what I do, or else the FBI will be ramming down my door to arrest me for breaking the laws of physics and what not.<br />
<br />
&quot;That is correct. I do hope you keep the wishes coming. You can use wishes to better other people’s lives as well, so keep that in mind. Many of my previous owners were too selfish to wish for others, but there were a few who decided to unselfish.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay then. Er, one last question and then you can go. What’s your name?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You can just refer to me as Nino.&quot; As soon as she said her name, she had disappeared back into the magic eight ball. <br />
<br />
I was getting use to all these strange happenings. It’s not like it was a hard thing to grasp, it was just so very... Strange... Awkward... Bleh! I was going to be late for school! Before I could panic, a sly grin crept across my face as I looked at the ball in my hand. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, she did like granting wishes. It’d be rude to deny her the satisfaction… I wish I was transported to an empty bathroom in my school...&quot; I paused for a minute and quickly added &quot;I mean an empty boy’s bathroom!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Heehee, it’s almost as if you knew I was going to send you to a female’s bathroom. Ehem! So you have wished it, so it shall be granted.&quot;<br />
<br />
With a cliche puff a smoke, I was there. My books, my body, my brain... I think my brain came with me, anyway. I felt sorta loopy. But I was definitely in an empty stall in the boy's bathroom. I proceeded on my way to my locker as usual, wondering if Nino had hinted for me to use my wishes on others just so she could do what she does best... That was probably the case. Maybe I should take her up on that offer sometime soon.</p>
