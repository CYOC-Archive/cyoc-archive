<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Chuck groaned as the hunter continued to stroke and rub him, gripping his cock in huge and powerful hands. He leaned his head back and closed his eyes as he pumped his cock into the man’s hands, feeling as is his cock was shifting shape just to fit better into his hand. The hunter grinned and continued to rub, watching as Chuck’s dick grew longer and harder even as it slimmed down into a slightly pointed and clearly animal penis as a furry sheathe slipped up around it, the fur already matted down by precum. Chuck felt his balls tingle and twitch as soft fur coated them as well, churning with fresh cum ready to be released at the hunter’s teasing.<br />
<br />
Fur continued to creep upwards across his chest; soft, fluffy and gray, unlike the wiry dirty blond chest hair he had sported until mere moments ago. Thicker, too, with a nearly complete covering of smooth fur across his whole chest. Not that Chuck even noticed as he panted in arousal, amazed at how great it felt to have another man in complete control of his body…<br />
<br />
The hunter cradled Chuck’s head and forced him to look right into his deep blue eyes. For the first time, Chuck noticed the hunter’s teeth, his canines longer and more pointed than any he had ever seen before and sticking out slightly from beneath his lips. For a moment, he felt like he was going to be devoured on the spot like a quivering animal, prey for the great hunter, but instead the hunter merely smiled and dipped down below to wrap his lips around Chuck’s newly transformed and sensitive cock.<br />
<br />
Chuck could feel a long tongue, like a dog’s tongue, wrapping itself around his dick, savoring every drop of precum he was drooling. He felt the man’s sharpened teeth gently scraping across his skin, feeling a rush of adrenaline knowing they could snap down at any moment. And finally, he felt strong fingers reaching around and teasing as his asshole, gently stretching him out before slipping inside and rubbing back and forth, picking up in intensity until he was getting full-on finger-fucked.<br />
<br />
The hunter’s finger jabbed at his prostate over and over in time with his sucking, drawing Chuck closer and closer to orgasm, until finally the dam burst and he sprayed cum down the hunter’s throat. As Chuck came, the hunter slipped his fingers out from within him with a slurping sound, and as the same moment a little tuft of a tail popped out of Chuck’s back, the fluffy cottontail of a rabbit. A fitting prey for the great hunter.<br />
<br />
The hunter led out a strange sound, a growl of pleasure that rumbled up deep within his throat as he rose back up and looked into Chuck’s eyes again. For a moment, Chuck did not see the hunter, but instead he saw the face of a great wolf, but he blinked a few times and the handsome face of the local man once again filled his eyes.<br />
<br />
“So… What brings you here?” the hunter asked as he wiped his lips and lay back on the beach, as if nothing had just happened. He looked over Chuck with interest, noting that his changes were still incomplete; beyond his chest pelt, rabbit tail, and animal cock he still looked mostly human. Perhaps his ears were a bit pointier, but that was it. “I guess it really does take longer for others…” he murmured to himself.<br />
<br />
“I… Huh?” Chuck started to say, noticing that the hunter’s language was coming to his lips quite easily. Chuck chalked it up to having picked up a few words on his trips to the nearby islands for supplies. “I’m helping build a resort hotel on the beach over there. Me and my dad and a few other guys, at least…”<br />
<br />
“A builder, huh? That’s a noble job,” the hunter said in a smooth, deep voice, his praise filling Chuck with pride. “But, you shouldn’t build on other people’s land. I’m afraid these islands belong to someone else already.&quot;<br />
<br />
Chuck was baffled by that. They&#39;d cleared the project with the local government and they hadn&#39;t said anything about people living here, at least not for a millennia. “Umm, I didn’t know anything about that, I was just doing what I was ask to, Mr… Uh, what’s your name?”<br />
<br />
“Ken.”<br />
<br />
“Is that short for something?” Chuck responded, trying to remember local names that started with ‘Ken’. “Kenku, Ken’ua…?”<br />
<br />
“It’s short for Kenneth. It’s a long story, but the short version is that you can either leave these islands or stay here and join me and my friends,” Kenneth said, putting a strong arm around Chuck’s shoulders. Chuck eyed the bow and arrow on the ground and thought for a moment that Kenneth was threatening him, but his words didn’t sound ill-intentioned. “But, I hope you’ll stick around. We’ll need lots of houses soon, and I bet you’ll find lots to do around here.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kenneth leaned in and planted one more kiss on Chuck&#39;s lips, then he hopped up from the ground and grabbed his bow and quiver. “Anyway, I’ve got to get lunch for me and my friends. Think it over, but don’t take too long. Otherwise, the choice will be made for you,” he said with a grin as he started to sneak off into the jungle. “You know where to find me if you want to talk some more. Or do anything else for that matter. Later!”<br />
<br />
Chuck just stared after the man as he disappeared into the jungle, wondering what the hell had just happened. His body felt strange, but he couldn’t place exactly what felt wrong as he pulled his shorts back up, feeling a little discomfort in back as they rubbed against his new tail. In a daze, he walked back toward the construction site, scratching the fluffy fuzz on his chest…</p>
