<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Alex couldn&#39;t do anything but sit in the cage and stare at the men passing by. The more he watched the more he noticed oddities. There really were no women, he saw some children, all boys, and even saw a man with a swollen stomach that had to be pregnant with how lean the rest of his body was.<br />
<br />
People were also much more open physically and sexually, Alex figured that was because there only seemed to be one gender. Why hide what everyone has?<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah! Lord Marus! I was hoping you&#39;d stop by today! I have the perfect purchase for you. Just Lord Florin&#39;s type!&quot; Alex suddenly heard the slaver speak. The man he was talking to rode on horseback, wearing a long robe of black with gold embroidery, left open at the front. His man hood was hidden by a filmy loincloth of the same black and gold and his feet in matching boots. Around his neck was a gold chain, almost a choker a black stone shining at the center of his throat. And he was.. stunningly handsome. Blond hair that poured down his back and a leanly muscled physique. He had four guards around him, burly and muscular they wore similar loincloths to Marus but in red and gold with matching boots, and all wore chain necklaces in silver. It seemed some sort of uniform. But all four men were strikingly good looking. Some sporting beards, others with chest hair proudly on display. One had greenish skin and short tusks but that made him look rugged rather than bestial. Another had horns and goat legs. But all four guards were of a size.<br />
<br />
&quot;How many times must I tell you, it&#39;s just Marus. I serve Lord Florin. Let me see what dregs you&#39;re casting up today.&quot; The man sounded bored, and like he wasn&#39;t expecting much. It wasn&#39;t Alex that was prodded out of the cage of course, not with his lanky frame with the slight belly from forgetting to go to the gym. He wouldn&#39;t match this group, not if these were &#39;Lord Florin&#39;s type.&#39;<br />
<br />
It was the youngest of the remaining three that the slaver beckoned out of the cart. His body was lean and athletic and he was fairly well endowed. His cock dangling between his legs as he stood up. Marus looked the young man up and down with a critical eye, then pulled out something like a jewelers loop and peered through it. &quot;Hmm.. potential. 500 gold coins, not a copper more.&quot;<br />
<br />
The slaver looked about to argue, but nodded, handing over one of his rings and a scroll in exchange for a bag from one of the guards. &quot;Papers are in order.&quot; The guard grunted to Marus after looking it over.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait a moment. I want a better look at that one, bring him out.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That one? You don&#39;t want that one.&quot; Alex looked up and noticed Marus&#39; eyes were on him.<br />
<br />
&quot;I do. Bring him out.&quot; The slaver looked at Alex with narrowed eyes, he felt a light buzz from the nipple ring and quickly got out of the cart before he ended up zapped again. Marus looked him over from horseback, the lens still to his eye. &quot;Yes.. yes. Perfect. I&#39;ll give you two thousand for him.&quot; Even the guards looked stunned, the slaver looked poleaxed.<br />
<br />
The exchange was done quickly, no way was the slaver going to let a sale like this get away. Alex watched helplessly as the ring switched hands from the slaver to Marus. The scroll was given to the guard who squinted at he paperwork, then handed it up to Marus who looked it over. The slaver was sweating at documents that obviously had to have been forged, but Marus said nothing and slipped it away with the other. For some reason he wanted Alex, even if it wasn&#39;t completely legal.<br />
<br />
&quot;Carry them.&quot; Marus said to the guards. &quot;I don&#39;t want them tearing their feet up on the streets on the way back.&quot; It was the half-orc that lifted Alex and tossed him over his shoulder. As long as Marus wore that ring he wasn&#39;t going to fight. It was a half-hour walk to their ultimate destination, and at that point he was set down on the ground. Before him sprawled what looked like either a temple or a very lavish estate. The building was gleaming white stone with a large fountain in front of it, though the whole place was walled off from the rest of the town, walls they were already past. A garden looked to encircle the building. He saw many more men walking around in the loincloths, all in various colors but all with that gold embroidery. All wore those chain necklaces too. Many were bronze, some silver, and occasionally gold. Rarer still were gold ones set with gems. All of them wore robes like Marus, in the colors matching their gems. He saw only a red one and a blue one through, they were walking buy side by side in conversation.<br />
<br />
There were other men about, too. Though their clothing was like that of the villagers, though of a nice make. The loinclothed and necklaced ones seemed to be serving or entertaining them. Alex looked away as he saw one pair openly having sex under a tree. &quot;Welcome to the Dicktin brothel. The finest brothel in the kingdom and your new home.&quot; Marus intoned as he looked over at the two new acquisitions. &quot;Terrik. Take that one to Halver to have him sorted.&quot; Alex looked to his fellow cage mate and watched as one of the guards escorted him off.<br />
<br />
&quot;You will come with me.&quot; Marus said to Alex. &quot;You will be meeting with Lord Florin directly. When I bow you will prostrate yourself on the floor. You will address him as my lord or sir. You will do as he tells you. Cooperate, and you will find your time here.. quite pleasant.&quot; Marus seemed eager for some reason, as if Alex were a great find he was about to present to this Lord Florin. Alex couldn&#39;t comprehend why, he was average at best, a little scruffy and frumpy at worst.<br />
<br />
He was led into the building. The whole place was like some fantasy palace. White stone with colored fabric drapings of all colors. Areas were people were lounging, some engaging in sex, though Alex hardly found that surprising since they were in a brothel. He was led up stairs and through hallways to what must have been the upper most floor. They stepped into a large room with an open terrace overlooking the garden which stretched off behind the brothel much further than he expected. On the edge of town, there were no buildings beyond the garden wall, just the view of forests and fields.<br />
<br />
There were only two other men in the room. One was in a silver chain with a purple loincloth though he was obviously the lesser of the two as he was just standing there fanning the other who sat lounging naked in a chair reading a book. The man was tall but slender. Over six feet with flawless tan skin and long black hair. His ears were long and pointed, his features fox like. An elf? He wore no necklace either, the only things he did wear was a circlet of gold around his head and some rings on his fingers.<br />
<br />
&quot;My Lord Florin.&quot; Marus bowed. Alex did as he had been told and knelt down, putting his forehead on the floor. &quot;I bring you something quite special.&quot;<br />
<br />
&#39;Special? Me?!&#39; Alex still wondered what had sparked all of this. Could they tell he was from another world maybe?<br />
<br />
&quot;This?&quot; The smooth, deep voice must have belonged to Florin, and he sounded as skeptical as Alex felt. &quot;Marus. Have you gone mad? My chief procurer brings me this... dreg?&quot;<br />
<br />
&#39;Okay,&#39; Alex though, &#39;that was a bit mean.&#39;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know he may not seem like my, my lord, but if I may, you should examine his aura.&quot; Marus sounded confident still.<br />
<br />
There was a moment of silence, where Alex dared to raise his head just a little. Florin was holding up a lens to his eye, much like that Marus had looked him over with. &quot;Oh, Marus. Remind me never to doubt you. Stand up, tell me your name.&quot; The order was obviously directed at Alex.<br />
<br />
He quickly did as he was told, getting to his feet, stunned. &quot;Alex.&quot; Then belatedly. &quot;My lord.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ll need to work on manners and presentation&quot; Florin stood from his chair and walked over to a side table which held several wooden boxes, all long and narrow. He opened one up, pulling out a gold chain set with a gleaming white stone. &quot;So you know what this is, Alex?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A necklace, my lord.&quot; Marus glared at him, but Florin laughed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good, spirit, I like that. Some of my men come to me far too cowed.&quot; Florin held up the necklace where it could glimmer in the light. &quot;Necklaces denote rank in this brothel. Bronze ones mostly do chores but do engage in entertainment. Silver typically have more important duties in addition to entertaining customers, such as acting as guards or stewards. Golds focus almost solely on our guests, though sometimes do other tasks. Those with gems are special talents. The higher the necklace the more they cost, but the fewer in my employ. Those gems are magic.&quot; Florin turned to Alex. &quot;Marus for example heals those he copulates with because of his stone. He also has a special eye for talent. The stones only work when worn by someone who.... aligns with them.&quot;<br />
<br />
Florin ran a finger over the white stone as he stepped closer to Alex. &quot;It&#39;s been decades since we had someone who could wear this one. The fetish stone.&quot; Alex stood frozen as Florin put the necklace around him. It didn&#39;t seem to have a clasp, the chain just melded together when then ends met. &quot;We won&#39;t need that. The necklaces are better control devices anyway.&quot; Florin reached down and grabbed the nipple ring, it popped open and surprisingly left no mark behind. Marus quickly made his way over to take the discarded ring. &quot;Ask. I know you want to.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The fetish stone?&quot; Alex said, Florin speaking at the same time with an amused smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, a special transformative magic.&quot; Florin stepped around behind Alex, putting hands on his shoulders. &quot;After a few moments of touch, you&#39;ll begin to change. Everyone has something that they want in a sexual partner. This stone brings it out, within reason. It won&#39;t kill you, or make you mindless, but I&#39;ve seen this stone do some extraordinary things.&quot; Alex felt a tingle passing through him as Florin rubbed his shoulders. He looked down at himself, his eyes widening. His small gut was melting away, and his arms and legs looked more toned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Me though? I&#39;m a man of simple pleasures. I like my men with lean muscles.&quot; Alex&#39;s chest swelled slightly as his stomach firmed up into a six pack. Florin&#39;s hands moved over his chest. &quot;Smooth skin.&quot; Almost as if the words were driving it, Alex&#39;s little bit of body hair seemed to vanish, some of the blemishes and freckles on his skin even disappeared. Then he felt one of the elf&#39;s hands wrapping around his cock. &quot;And big dicks.&quot; In Florin&#39;s hand, Alex&#39;s cock suddenly swelled, not growing hard, but more than doubling in size. Still flaccid, it lengthened to seven inches, the foreskin regrowing and covering the head, thick veins popped out along the shaft as it gained girth at an alarming pace, becoming as thick as his wrist. Only then did he start getting hard, the massive tool dragged at his crotch, he could even feel his balls swelling as gravity pulled them down, brushing against his thigh. soon his cock stuck out an impressive foot, the head slipping free of his foreskin, glistening and red.<br />
<br />
Florin snapped, at the servant who had been fanning the elf ran over and put his mouth over Alex&#39;s cock, just in time to catch a mouthful of cum as Alex exploded. The servant was careful to catch every drop, and even licked what spilled off the floor. Florin returned to his seat. &quot;We&#39;ll need to work on endurance, too. Well done, Marus, I&#39;ll make sure you are adequately rewarded for this find. Bring him to his new room and have him cleaned up and dressed properly now that he actually fits in.&quot;<br />
<br />
Marus bowed, and with a glare from the man Alex did the same. Alex quickly fell in behind Marus as they went back into the hallways. Alex couldn&#39;t get used to the feeling of his massive cock flopping between his thighs. &quot;You may not leave the grounds except under order from Lord Florin and with a guard. Other than that, as someone wearing a gem you can go anywhere but the Lord&#39;s private apartments unless summoned. You may issue direct orders to any wearing a bronze necklace if you need anything brought to you.&quot; Marus gestured back the way they came. &quot;For now you will be training at least four hours a day. Some guests may still wish to purchase your services, you will please them as best you can. Your clientele will be spending quite a bit of money for the pleasure, so do not disappoint.<br />
<br />
Alex stumbled a step as they stepped into a large room. White stone like the others, the cloth was all white and gold, matching his necklace. There was already a tub full of steaming water in the room, Alex guessed for a bath. But then he saw a mirror and caught sight of himself. His face was still his, but there was something different about it. His jaw was smooth, and he had a more masculine cast to his features. His unimpressive body now had a toned swimmer&#39;s physique and his cock.. it dangled halfway down his thighs, the thickness of it was almost obscene. &quot;Does it wear off?&quot; Alex asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mmm..&quot; Marus looked over, then shook his head. &quot;You&#39;ll maintain whatever changes the stone makes to you until someone else over rides them with something else. You might spend some time with some interesting changes. Or you can always play roulette with your brothers, hoping for something easy to deal with.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Brothers?&quot; Alex said moving over to Marus who beckoned him to the bath.<br />
<br />
&quot;Me, you, the others. We&#39;re all brothers. It&#39;s a way to denote ourselves without using unpleasant terms. My brothers sounds better than the other whores.&quot; Marus laughed, watching Alex slip into the bath. &quot;Someone will be up with dinner and some clothes soon. We&#39;ll start your training tomorrow.&quot; And with that, Marus left.</p>
