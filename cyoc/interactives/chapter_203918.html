DING, DONG!<br />
<br />
The door swung open, Lauren was immediately greeted by a very cheerful looking woman,<br />
<br />
“Hey Lauren!!” Tamika said very cheerfully, wrapping her arms around Lauren,<br />
“Hey Tamika,” Lauren said. She expected Tamika to be more of the quiet type, and she still seemed that way… but something was clearly making her a lot more extroverted, “good to see you again,” she added,<br />
“You too!” Tamika said, unwrapping herself from Lauren.<br />
<br />
Tamika’s house looked incredibly clean, especially with the state it was in the night before. Even Lauren could tell Tamika had been up since early hours cleaning. And to her credit, the house looked immaculate.<br />
“So, how’s it been going without the kids around?” Lauren asked, still admiring the shine on almost every surface,<br />
“Ooh, it’s been pretty good,” she stated, “I found a distraction… or two,” she stated, giggling to herself after,<br />
“Interesting,” Lauren said, casually leaning herself against the counter, “I always struggle to distract myself. It always narrows down to visiting my mom and trying to find friends with free time,” she stated, “but honestly… no one else has any free time,”<br />
“Well as I’m sure I said, I’ve got all the free time in the world,” Tamika quoted, “and I really have been struggling. First time without the kids right there…” she said, gesturing to the long sofa,<br />
“I’m telling you, it doesn’t get easier. You just know they’re safer,” Lauren commented,<br />
“I’ll keep it in mind,” she said.<br />
<br />
“Oh right!” Lauren said, “I made this for you!” She said, revealing a fair sized cylindrical tin,<br />
“Oh wow, you really didn’t have to bring anything,” Tamika assured,<br />
“Don’t even, girl,” Lauren started, “you know I couldn’t just show up empty handed,” she said. She placed the tin on the table, and popped open the lid. She revealed an incredible looking cake, nothing like Tamika had ever seen. The smell immediately tingled every one of her senses,<br />
“That smells… unbelievable!” Tamika said,<br />
“I know!” Lauren said, “it’s my mothers recipe… it’s rather magical, isn’t it!” She stated,<br />
“I don’t want to be rude or anything…” Tamika said, “b-but could I…”<br />
“Go ahead!” Lauren said, lifting it from the tin.<br />
<br />
Tamika placed three plates on the table and provided Lauren with a dull knife to cut the cake. The cake was placed nicely onto one of the plates, and Lauren cut two slices for the both of them.<br />
<br />
“It’s a little chilly, you don’t mind if I take my sweater off, do you?” Tamika asked Lauren,<br />
“No no, it’s your home,” Lauren replied. Both women chuckled at the remark.<br />
As Tamika pulled her sweater off, covering her face and revealing her white tank top.<br />
Lauren couldn’t help but look at her…<br />
<br />
Tamika’s breasts were at least three sizes larger than Lauren’s… she was sure she had larger breasts, not that she was really comparing when she first met her. It just seemed like Lauren had the larger bust. Not that Lauren was anything special, a generous B cup at most, but Tamika was absolutely not someone who she ever expected to be packing a rack!<br />
<br />
“Sorry about that,” Tamika said. Lauren looked away quickly, but Tamika caught her glance. She smirked.<br />
“N-no worries,” Lauren said, “I-I mean… it’s your house, like I said,” she stated, very awkwardly. She couldn&#39;t bring herself to look back at Tamika, finding herself oddly embarrassed about being so infatuated with Tamika’s breasts. And although she could easily narrow it down to jealousy… it was definitely a little more than that.<br />
Tamika took a bite of her slice of cake, her face lit up light a lightbulb. It was the most delicious thing she’d ever tasted,<br />
“This is the most delicious thing I’ve ever tasted!” She said out loud,<br />
“O-oh, I’m so glad,” Lauren said, trying her best to stay focussed,<br />
“What’s wrong Lauren?” Tamika asked, scooting herself closer to Lauren.<br />
<br />
She was given an almost direct line of sight into Tamika’s cleavage between the tight tank top. She felt herself beginning to sweat, trying her best not to be distracted by them, but she couldn’t take her eyes off of them,<br />
“Are you distracted by something?” Tamika asked once again, acting almost like an airhead as she asked. Lauren knew Tamika was an intelligent woman and very socially aware, she knew exactly what she was doing. She moved closed and close until their chests were essentially touching,<br />
“T-Tamika…” Lauren asked, trying her best to look into her eyes, “w-what going o-on here…” she asked, very nervously,<br />
“I just…” Tamika seemed to be trying to act sexy, but something about her smirk… she looked like she about to laugh, “I wanted you…” she looked like she was about to explode.<br />
<br />
She quickly snapped her head backwards and burst out laughing, “Dammit!” She said to herself, “I wanted to keep building up,” she said,<br />
“B-building what up?” Lauren asked, still very confused.<br />
“How hard was it to keep your eyes off of… these?” She said, lifting up her breasts. Lauren suddenly blushed incredibly hard,<br />
“I-it was…” Lauren stammered, “I don’t understand what’s going on right now?”<br />
“Oh yeah, sorry Lauren,” Tamika said, “I think it’d be easier if I just told you… I have the power to change boobs,” she stated very blatantly.<br />
<br />
Lauren looked puzzled… very puzzled,<br />
“You have what-now?” She asked,<br />
“I think if I’m going to tell anyone, it’s going to have to be you. I don’t know you so well, but I know that we can do some amazing things with this!”<br />
“Amazing things with what exactly? Tamika you’re not being clear, what the hell are you talking about?”<br />
“Okay, okay,” Tamika began, “I got a letter that said every day I have a single wish that will be granted for me. Yesterday I wished for giant breasts, and today I wished that I can control breasts completely, so I could bring them back to normal size,”<br />
“A-and this is… your normal size?” Lauren asked, glancing quickly at her chest,<br />
“Oh no no!” Tamika said, almost bursting into laughter again, “I have really small boobs, but I wanted to see what it was like having big boobs,”<br />
“Wait but you said you made them giant?”<br />
“Yeah. You wanna see what size they were?” Tamika asked,<br />
“Uhm… I guess so…” Lauren said, “but I still don’t get it, you’re being totally serious?”<br />
“Absolutely. Let me prove it to you.”<br />
<br />
Lauren suddenly felt something shift. Her whole chest felt a very mild sense of pleasure, like a rising heat. She looked down at her own tan coloured sweater and watched in awe as her chest began to rise like bread in an oven.<br />
She couldn’t believe it as her own below average bust suddenly rose to average, above average. Within just a few seconds, her chest had risen to the size of her head, and they were definitely being weight down, almost sagging right onto her lap.<br />
Without thinking, Lauren shouted, “Holy shit!” And stood up quickly. Without properly adapting to the weight, she immediately fell to the ground, landing directly on her new boobs, “oow…” she groaned.<br />
<br />
“I’m so sorry, Lauren!” Tamika said, covering her mouth,<br />
“Are you kidding!?” Lauren said, lifting herself up carefully, looking at her slightly larger than head-sized boobs on her chest, “this is the greatest thing that has ever happened to me!!” She said with excitement,<br />
“I’m so glad you like them!!” Tamika said,<br />
“W-well… maybe not the boobs themselves, but you!” She exclaimed again, “this power! If you can change anything, every day, we can do so much!!”<br />
“Just for one month, though,”<br />
“Oh, right,” Lauren said, understanding, “I guess there’s just one more question then,”<br />
“What’s that?”<br />
<br />
“Where do we begin?” Lauren said with a grin on her face. Tamika couldn’t help but grin back. They both knew this was going to be the most fun time of their lives!</p>
