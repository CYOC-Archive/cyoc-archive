<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Your name is Rick and you're strolling through the woods with your girlfriend on a nice summer day. You were a bit apprehensive about coming into the woods since Snakor was said to roam them but Nancy had pointed out that he had only gone after children so you would be safe. You couldn't argue with that logic so here you were in the woods. Nancy took out a cigarette and you said, &quot;I wish you would quit smoking.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm a big girl and can make my own decisions regarding my health,&quot; Nancy said in an irritated voice. After she lit up she continued, &quot;It's not like it's going to kill me in the next few minutes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well you could start a forest fire here,&quot; you said shaking your head. &quot;The leaves and grass are really dry and you know they've issued a red flag warning for fires.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh a cigarette isn't going to start a forest fire,&quot; Nancy said rolling her eyes at you.<br />
<br />
You were about to respond when you suddenly see flames race toward you at blinding speed and stop right in front of you. Your jaw dropped to see a young woman encased in flames. Well you assumed it was a young woman from the way her chest was jutting out. You also noticed that nothing around her was burning. It took you a couple seconds to get over your shock then you asked, &quot;Who are you and why is nothing around you burning?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I am Quickfire,&quot; the woman said and it was a woman from the sound of her voice. &quot;As to why nothing around me is burning my fire doesn't burn anything unless I wish it to. I can tell that you're concerned for the forest.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well it's a beautiful place and I'd hate to see it burn when it can be prevented,&quot; you said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I've already said a cigarette won't burn down the forest,&quot; Nancy said rolling her eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;That's where you're wrong,&quot; Quickfire said anger lacing her words. &quot;It was a cigarette that caused the forest fire me and so many animals were caught in. I was lucky to live through it. Many of the animals weren't so lucky.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You're just a nut,&quot; Nancy said waving her off. &quot;A cigarette can't start a forest fire.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nine out of ten forest fires are started by careless humans,&quot; Quickfire said her voice now dripping with venom. &quot;It takes just one spark from a fire that was thought to be out, from a person starting an ATV or bike too close to dry vegetation, or hot ash from a cigarette.&quot; She looked at you and said, &quot;I don't want to harm a friend of the forest but I can't let you interfere with what I'm going to do. You would get hurt far worse if you did.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you talking about?&quot; you asked. The answer came when Quickfire grabbed you with one hand and threw you against a tree. You hit the tree with enough force to knock the wind out of you and nearly knock you out.<br />
<br />
You slumped down to the ground and looked up as Nancy asked in a panicked voice, &quot;Why did you do that?&quot;<br />
<br />
Nancy started to come over to you but Quickfire grabbed her by the throat and said in a voice full of menace, &quot;Because I don't want to kill him. Now it's time for you to die.&quot; With those words flames spread over Nancy's body and she screamed in pain.<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; you said weakly and tried to move so you could save Nancy. She may have her head up her butt but she doesn't deserve to die. You were just starting to move when the flames died and Quickfire dropped her charred corpse. &quot;No,&quot; you moaned as you staggered over to her. Looking up at Quickfire you asked, &quot;Why did you kill her?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She needed to die for the animals and the forest,&quot; Quickfire replied with a hint of sorrow in her voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Her death can't bring them back,&quot; you said.<br />
<br />
&quot;But it does prevent future deaths she would have caused,&quot; Quickfire said. &quot;She perished quickly compared to those animals that die in a forest fire. I must go and look for others that would harm the forest with their carelessness.&quot; With that she took off like lightning running through the forest.<br />
<br />
&quot;I swear that I'll bring you to justice someday Quickfire,&quot; you said glaring in the direction she had gone.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can help you with that,&quot; a female voice said behind you.<br />
<br />
You whirled around and saw what could only be described as a demon. She had black hair, black horns growing out of her forehead, and black orbs for eyes. When she smiled she showed sharp fangs that could tear flesh from bone. Her skin was red and she wasn't wearing any clothes. Despite this you couldn't see any nipples on her breasts or her genitals. She had a long thin tail with a spade tip and her fingers and toes were thin ending in claws. &quot;What?&quot; you asked stunned.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can give you the power to eventually bring Quickfire to justice,&quot; the demon said. &quot;All I want in return is your soul.&quot;<br />
<br />
You looked down at Nancy's corpse and asked, &quot;Do you actually think that I'd give up my soul for that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't think that,&quot; the demon said. &quot;I know you will give me your soul. Your passion to see Quickfire brought to justice and for you to be the one to do it is very strong. You can't bring her to justice as you are though. Give me your soul and I'll give you the power you need. You don't have to decide right now. Think it over and if you decide to give me your soul come to me after her funeral.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And where will you be at if I do?&quot; you asked so you could avoid the place. You didn't want her to misinterpret you walking past as accepting her offer.<br />
<br />
&quot;You'll know,&quot; the demon said cryptically. &quot;By the way you can call me Alana.&quot; With that she was gone.<br />
<br />
It was a very emotional time for you and Nancy's family over the next few days. You were arrested for her murder but because they didn't find any traces of accelerant on you or Nancy they had to let you go. It was clear that the police didn't trust you though and you were tempted to accept Alana’s offer. The funeral itself was closed casket and Nancy's mother broke down during the graveside service. &quot;How dare you be here,&quot; she said glaring at you. &quot;You murdered my daughter and you have the gall to come to her funeral. It should be you in that casket instead of my daughter.&quot; At that she had pulled out a gun and fired at you. Fortunately you dived to the side when you had seen the gun and she missed. They had to wrestle the gun from her. You told her husband that you were going to leave so the service could continue. You also told him that if the police asked you were going to deny that she had attempted to kill you but that she needed to see a grief counselor.<br />
<br />
You walked away not bothering to call for your ride. You wanted to walk and think. It seemed that just about everyone thought you had killed Nancy even though you didn't. There had been two more people who had just been found burnt to death that had been missing for a couple of days before you had the run-in with Quickfire. You expected the police to come arrest you again as soon as they felt confident they wouldn't be letting you go again.<br />
<br />
After a couple of hours you found yourself on the doorstep of a house not having paid attention to where you were going. You were about to turn around and leave when the door opened and a woman said, &quot;I knew would come Rick. Please come in so we can get the formalities out of the way.&quot;<br />
<br />
You should have politely refused but you entered the house instead. You already knew the woman was Alana and you were here to sell your soul to her. &quot;You know why I'm here,&quot; you said looking down.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course I do,&quot; Alana said with a smile. &quot;I have to admit that I'm surprised that you're here though.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You knew I'd come to you,&quot; you said sighing.<br />
<br />
&quot;To be honest I didn't,&quot; Alana said. &quot;I just said that to shake you up a bit. What happened to make you change your mind?&quot;<br />
<br />
You quickly explained what had happened during the last few days and finished by saying, &quot;I guess I'll have to become a fugitive so I can bring Quickfire to justice.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alana hugged you and said, &quot;I didn't think it would be this bad for you. I think the best thing is for you to disappear and I'll make that happen. First I need you to verbally accept my offer to give you the power to eventually bring Quickfire and other supervillians to justice in exchange for your soul.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I accept your offer,&quot; you said sealing the deal.<br />
<br />
&quot;Follow me to the basement,&quot; Alana said. You followed her down to the basement where she turned around and reverted to her demon form. It happened so fast that you didn't get a chance to see it. &quot;Are you ready?&quot; she asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;As ready as I'll ever be,&quot; you said.<br />
<br />
Alana came up to you and kissed you. You were stunned but it was enjoyable and you began to kiss her back. Suddenly it felt like your whole body was on fire and it wasn't only your body that felt like that but it felt like your soul was on fire too. It quickly turned to a pleasurable feeling instead of a painful one. You were lost in the feeling so you didn't know what was happening to your body. Alana broke the kiss and your knees buckled. She kept hold of you and said, &quot;It's done. Come take a look at yourself.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alana led you to a mirror and you were shocked at what you saw. Instead of your male human body you saw a female demon in it's place. Your skin was red like Alana’s with the same thin fingers and toes with claws and a thin tail with a spade tip. You lacked nipples on your breasts which were about a C cup and genitals. Reaching back behind you were surprised to find you didn't have a butt crack either and you figured the same was true of Alana. Opening your mouth you saw you had the same fangs as Alana and a forked tongue like a serpents. Your hair was gold as were your horns which were smaller than Alana’s and your eyes were silver orbs. &quot;What did you do to me?&quot; you asked noting how feminine your voice sounded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well you gave me your soul which means I could do whatever I wanted to do with you,&quot; Alana explained. &quot;What I decided to do was to make you my daughter.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why would you do that?&quot; you asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I've wanted a daughter for the last thousand years now,&quot; Alana said, &quot;but no male demon would have sex with me. When you told me what happened I thought it was best that Rick disappear and I saw a way to have the daughter I always wanted.”<br />
<br />
&quot;But we don't have any genitals,&quot; you said.<br />
<br />
&quot;You're wrong on that Astarayneya,&quot; Alana said.<br />
<br />
&quot;What did you just call me?&quot; you asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Astarayneya,&quot; Alana said, &quot;it's your demon name and one you must never let anyone know. If they know your name they can summon you and you would be forced to do what they summoned you for. It could be something simple like helping them find a lost object or it could be something like torturing and killing someone.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I could be compelled to torture and kill someone?&quot; you asked stunned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes if someone summons you using your name so make sure you tell no one your name,&quot; Alana said. &quot;You need to think of a name you want people to know you by when you're in your demon form. For your human form your name is Alice Moore and I've taken the name Jennifer Moore.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What can I do?&quot; you asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well you can do anything a demon can do if you're summoned but you're gifted in transforming yourself and others into anything with one exception,&quot; Alana said, &quot;you can't transform yourself or anyone else into a copy of someone that's living. To transform someone else you have to be touching them. Also you won't die on this plane though Holy Water will harm you and might dissolve your corporeal form.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess I'll call myself Morphanna while in this form,&quot; you said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Great,&quot; Alana said beaming. &quot;Now I want to show you how we have sex.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But I'm your daughter now so that would be incest,&quot; you said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Incest is a human idea designed to keep the genes diverse enough,&quot; your mom said. &quot;We don't have that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Your mom stopped speaking and moved her hand down to the base of your tail and stroked it. A very pleasurable electric shock went through your body and your knees buckled again. Your mom kept stroking your tail sending the waves of pleasure throughout your body causing you to shudder and moan. Someone stroking your old dick never felt like this. You felt some sort of warm fluid gather at the tip of your tail and then your mom licked it causing a more intense wave of pleasure to course through you. Then you felt something against the tip of you tail and you looked back just in time to see your mom's tail enter your own. You gasped and arched your back at the feeling of it. You had no words to describe it but you liked it.<br />
<br />
Your mom kept pumping her tail into your's for the next two hours with you having several orgasms during that time. She would go fast and then slow in a rhythmic cadence. Finally you the most intense orgasm that you literally roared with pleasure as did your mom. You felt your tail muscles clench and your mom's tail twitch as a warm fluid flowed both ways. You collapsed onto the floor as your mom pulled her tail out of your's. She then moved her tail to your mouth and a drop of a purple fluid dropped into your mouth. You were about to spit it out when you realized that it was really sweet. You wanted to get all you could so you started to lick her tail.<br />
<br />
Your mom looked down on you with a smile and said, &quot;Now you know what having sex as a demon is like. We females are lucky since we can do it both ways but the males can only insert their tail into a female's tail. A male's tail can't expand like ours. Well ours have to expand since we give birth out of our tail and our babies are the same size as a human's.&quot;<br />
<br />
You barely heard your mom as you were enjoying the purple fluid on her tail and drifting off.</p>
