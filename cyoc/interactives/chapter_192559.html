<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Madame looked at him and smiled, something which she does a lot.<br />
Is that trua Kyle? Did you promise this man you would work on his farm if you didn&#39;t pay your debt?<br />
Yes madame, he said in a low voice.<br />
Jacob was looking at him very accousingly however he was still looking for a way to solve this.<br />
Madame saw this and said:<br />
Well if money is the problem than you came to the right place. I suggest your friend work for you as a draft animal for an undisclosed period of time.<br />
Jacob&#39;s face lighted up finally seeing a way to get back his money.<br />
Kyle on the other hand was very nervous. He had finished his degree in business, however nobody would hire him. And he definetely wasn&#39;t expecting his first job to be as an animal.<br />
Jacob sort of dragged/pushed him onto stage. He was still reluctant however Jacob said something before he could get his ideea in.<br />
OK, so how does this work, do we just strap him down?<br />
Who who who, first of all what animal do you need most for your farm?<br />
Most likely more horses to farm the land.<br />
OK any breed in mind?<br />
Nah just give him a not of endurance.<br />
OK! said madame Illusia<br />
When not dealing with horny participants she couldn&#39;t be bothered to strap them down, so she made a gesture and 2 farm hands came in and secured his hands and feet in place while tearing his clothes of him. <br />
You could see that he wasn&#39;t happy and the position wasn&#39;t ideal for him. <br />
Ahh, don&#39;t worry that will feel natural in a short time. <br />
As she said this she started the fire under the cauldron while inspecting him. <br />
I might have an ideea as to how you can make more money with him.  Do you have any stallions at your farm? <br />
Yeah! Why? <br />
Great, just wandering. <br />
She flipped the switch and the glistening black liquid started flowing down. <br />
His hands were first, the 50C° liquid seared his hands, but after a while he felt his hands automatically clench, and after some more time he couldn&#39;t feel them anymore. <br />
His legs were hit next and as much as he tried to not think about what was happening to him the searing hot sensation followed by numbness and then by more numbness and pressure woke him up from his slumber. <br />
His wrists started cracking and elongating as part of his new front legs,pushing up his shoulders to the same height as his basin. <br />
When he looked down instead of seeing his wrists he saw a round joint connected a long bone to what was once his fingers. <br />
His lower and upper hands were changed the same and got an uniform coating of fur. <br />
His legs were next and started by making the sole of his foot much longer,something which raised him up even more off the ground making him wonder how was he going to be able to use these legs. <br />
From his perspective he could saw his front legs getting furrier and by bending his neck down he saw his legs still cracking and making his brand new back legs. He also saw a tail sprouting behind him however there was no change to his privates yet which worried him. As he was looking down at his belly between his front legs he saw a hand cutting his underwear off and throwing it on the ground and with the same dexterity grabbing his member. She started stroking it while he was still looking at himself being touched for the first time by a woman. <br />
Now this wouldn&#39;t be fair if you weren&#39;t in on the negociation she said while still stroking him. <br />
Jacob and I have decided that you are worth more without a shaft in between your legs. <br />
His face dropped realizing what they meant. <br />
Now you want to neuter me as well? <br />
No, no nothing of the sort you will not loose the ability to reproduce, you just won&#39;t be the one producing the semen anymore. <br />
He took a few seconds to understand and then he got really aroused out of fear. <br />
The thing Is that you will be working for me 15 years as a male plow horse. <br />
You can make the same amount by giving birth to 3 foals in 3 years. <br />
As he said that madame picked up her pace and got him really close to an orgasm and then let him go. <br />
She kept him on the edge using a spell and any movement that he would make would trigger his orgasm. <br />
When he tried to look down he saw his engorged member and that was enough. <br />
He started to cum profusely for 5 minutes he kept going even after he was done. <br />
Each subsequent thrust was shortening his member bringing it closer to his back under his tail. <br />
He screamed as it migrated under his tail as the sensitivity was cranked to a maximum. The sensation was so intense that any remnant of what was left in his prostate came out as his prostate itself started started pulsing and shrinking. He couldn&#39;t take it anymore. Just as he said this it got even worse as it started to shrink even more and shrivel up inside him while still pulsating. <br />
It entered his body forming a slit under his tail that extended quite a ways down<br />
The pulsing sensation moved inside his body making his scream again as the  remnants of his prostate turned into an uterus. Enlarging into his belly, giving his abdomen a round shape to it. With this ocassion his abdomen, his torso changed and gave him a coat of brown hair. <br />
As his neck was elongating he or rather she saw a brown horse coming up from behind the stage, who was surely there to reinforce the ideea that he wasn&#39;t the one producing the semen anymore.</p>
