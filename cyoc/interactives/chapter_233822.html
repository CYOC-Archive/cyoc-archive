<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Seeing the game would need another few minutes and Theo being finished, Mark decided to change Ben next. As Ben wasn´t under the same rules Mark had on the others, his changes were a bit different.<br />
First, while Ben was a worm right now, Mark had decided that a snake would be a better pet, so further changes would target a snake instead of a worm. And he would get arms like a naga, just to have a use.<br />
Second, as he had the real Ben trapped inside, with an accepting control upfront, that needed to change. As he had no desire to add all commands the others had manually, he had used the chronivac to copy over all base commands from his little pets into a new file, creating a preset to use on new persons, which could be applied by a single command. With this, he would soon be able to change things for Ben as he did for the others.<br />
Lastly, Ben was Aidan´s age, 28 years, which wouldn´t fit the friend-group before him. So, to fit him in, Ben needed to be younger or be much slower in school than his year mates, so he would be hold back a year or two. That would also happen, with Ben ending up as a 14-year-old, half his normal age. The school had set to him back two times, so he ended up with his brother and the others, and they “bonded” over their changed forms. Him being slow was now countered by having real friends, so he would stay with them.<br />
All these changes would happen the second Ben gave the sock planned for him a sniff, just like the others. As Mark approached Ben, he took out the sock marked with a “B” and an “S”, before getting his attention. “Hey Ben, isn´t it boring to just watch them play?” he asked.<br />
Ben sighed. “Yeah, but I cannot play with them. How would I use the controller? With my nose, tongue or tail tip?” While the controlling personality accepted his changes as “normal”, he didn´t need to be happy about its limitations. Ben himself was mentally pleading for his freedom, this wasn´t what he thought Mark would do to be able to life better as a worm.<br />
Mark grinned at him. “I have something to help you. Here, take a sniff.” With that, he shoved the sock into Ben´s face. Without a way to stop himself from breathing, Ben did unvoluntary takes a sniff, recoiling from the scent for a second. But in that second, the sock already jumped his face and started to meld into his skin.<br />
The controlling mind vanished, and Ben returned to the surface, only for all the mental changes pressing in, silencing any protest of him. A bit of the socks turned into a small snout-like extension over Ben´s mouth and nose, while the rest expanded around his head, turning his skin with cloth-cover into light brown scales. These scales pressed into his head, reshaping it to the long, narrow face of a snake. His ears were pressed flat under it, vanishing together with his hair.<br />
The changes continued down his neck, and his head was now only slightly wider than the neck. From his front, his arms broke free of their clothes-prison, already becoming short and thin limbs. His hands had already reformed to have only three long fingers, ending in a blunt claw each. The length of the arms was half the original one, but more flexible than before. <br />
The arms and hands were covered in more dark-brown scales, while his body had the same light-brown scales as his head. The “ripped open” front, where his arms broke out, closed under the scales, leaving no marks behind. His cock and balls weren´t covered by his hands anymore, but also vanished under his scales, acting like the others had. A small opening was left behind were his ass used to be, not really noticeable. His feet under the wraps pressed even tighter, no longer any visible feet, but a simple tail-tip. <br />
Overall, his body was thinner than before, the width of his former stomach now around what one leg had been, his former knees were the same width, and below thinned quickly, as the former ancles were only as wide as a finger. He would now move either like a snake, flat on the ground, or like naga in games or films did, with would be like slithering on his knees.<br />
Ben lost another four inches in height as his body got younger during the other changes. He would still be taller than the others, but as he was older, they could still grow bigger. The last to happen was a stronger alteration of reality, so no one would think Ben was ever older than 14. He now didn´t belong to Aidan´s classmates anymore, but was in Chris class at their school. Memories of being older were being erased. If Mark ever changed them all back, Ben would now be in that class, and it would take more editing to get the “old” Ben back completely. At least if there wasn´t a failsafe in the chronivac to restore him.<br />
Just as the changes finished, Mark moved his hands as if to disperse something from his nose. “Ben, what is that smell? Have you eaten rotten eggs?”<br />
Ben´s mind, now adjusted to the same commands as Chris and the others, looked at Mark and started to answer honestly: “I don´t know, Mark. It jusssst appe…” Even his voice sounded younger, and he dragged out the s like a snake when it hissed. <br />
Mark stopped the answer, seeing the same blank look the others had when he removed something, and filled the void with: “No Ben, that smell is always there, as it is part of you. You don´t like it, even as it remembers you of your owner and makes you feel safe. My little snake, everything is as it should be.”<br />
Ben shook his head, accepting that with a light hiss. He frowned at the smell and taste, but knew he couldn´t change that. He rubbed his nose, only to recoil, as his hands stunk as well, a strong smell of piss remained in them. But that was normal as well, and he sunk back, ignoring Mark as the game of his friends just ended. He switched with Chris, while Justin switched with Dean.</p>
