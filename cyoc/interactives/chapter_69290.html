<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><br>Feeling weird about the whistle, not understanding how any of this could have been happening to him, Chad decided that it was best to 
ignore the ring. In a way, having the beard and the fuzzy ears was kinda cool, especially since he never let himself grow his beard out. Chad 
always felt it was best for a guy like him, both as the Quarterback of the High School football team and the Captain of the Water Polo team, to 
have a clean shaven face. For a long time, Chad prided himself over his boyish good looks, but now that he had the beard on, he felt more like 
the man that he knew he was. Since Chad had blown the whistle not once, but twice and had very unexpected results each time. Chad thought 
that someone, anyone but him, would be able to have heard the call of the whistle, but was disappointed each time. To Chad, the idea that the 
whistle could have been the cause of his recent and sudden changes to his physical appearance was preposterous, but it was still a nagging 
thought in the back of his mind.</br>
<br><em>Man... I don't know what the hell is going on here, but I am going to get to the bottom of this once 4pm rolls around! I don't think I 
should blow this whistle any more, just incase something else happens to me because of it!</em></br>
<br>As the day went on and the other classes, including lunch period, came and went, Chad got all kinds of reactions. Some of the guys 
around the school complimented him on his thick, but short beard. Even some of the girls, who had never looked at him before, smiled and 
giggled as he passed by. Chad couldn't believe how much having a beard changed things and he was <strong>really</strong> beginning to 
like the idea of it. Even as the day went by, it went by pretty quick, quicker than it had ever seemed to, but all the while Chad's mind was on the 
sound of the whistle. He thought and thought about blowing it again, seeing what else the whistle would do to him, if it really was the cause. 
As he thought about hearing the sound, even though it was loud and it seemed to hurt his ears, Chad realized that there was something about 
it that made him feel... <em>good!</em> Chad found himself wanting to hear the whistle sound again and decided that he would blow it 
again later, after school, while he waited for his secret admirer at the field house. He knew that this way, no one would notice anything 
different about himself and he could go about his business as he pleased. Knowing that he was going to get to hear the sound again, Chad 
clutched the whistle to his chest tightly, pressing into the cleft between his pecs through his shirt and reminisced about how the sound made 
him felt. Until that moment, Chad didn't realize that the whistle actually had an energy about it when it was blown! Chad knew the thing made 
him feel good, but he never really remembered feeling anything actually happening to him when it was blown. For that reason, Chad felt his 
body longing for him to blow the whistle once again and Chad promised himself that he would feel <em>good</em> again soon... very soon 
as he looked at his watch and saw that it was already 2:30pm, with one half hour left to go before the school let out and everyone started to 
pack up and go home... including the majority of the staff!</br>
<br>During the last half hour of the day, in his gym glass, all of the students were given a half hour to do whatever they wanted. They could 
play catch, dodge ball, volley ball, badminton or just hang out. Their gym teacher, who was also the Football Coach was a very relaxed and 
free-spirited type guy. The thing was, Mr. Sinclair made everyone vote on it unanimously and he wasn't surprised when all of the students, 
including Chad, shouted out <em>"hang out"!</em> Mr. Sinclair just smiled his pearly white teeth, which Chad noticed that his bicuspids were 
slightly longer, pointed and sharper than most. Noticing this got him curious and Chad decided to approach Mr. Sinclair just to talk to him 
about that and whatever else decided to come up through conversation. As Chad walked toward Mr. Sinclair, who was just hanging out on the 
pulled out and wooden bleachers, he noticed that a few people were watching him intently. Karen Sinclair, along with his buddies Mike, Mark 
and Carl were all watching him with curiosity, wondering what he was going to Mr. Sinclair about. While they all knew it really wasn't any of 
their business, they were all still curious, just as older teenagers were!</br>
<br>As Chad approached Mr. Sinclair, Mr. Sinclair was oblivious to Chad's advances as he was buried in his paperwork, either for the class or 
possibly stuff for the next and closely approaching football game. Chad knew that this would be the perfect time to startle him and possibly 
even scare him since he was never taken off guard. As Chad was within feet, he called out to Mr. Sinclair, hoping for a shock.</br>
<br>"Mr. Sinclair!" Chad almost shouted!</br>
<br>Mr. Sinclair looked up with a smile, but without so much as a twitch and greeted Chad. "Yes Chad, can I help you?"</br>
<br>Chad just looked at him, disappointed that even that didn't catch him off guard, but Chad didn't show any of it. "Oh... no, not really. Since 
we have this little bit of time as free time, I just thought I would come over and chat with you about stuff."</br>
<br>"What kind of... <em>stuff</em> Chad? Mr. Sinclair replied, looking interested in what the boy had to say.</br>
<br>"Oh... I don't know... just stuff. I mean, I have been your Quaterback for some time now and no one, including myself, has ever really 
gotten to know you. So, I thought that this would be the perfect opportunity for us to shoot the breeze and see what I can learn about you." 
Chad replied, slightly embarrassed especially since he was being so cavalier about it all, while scratching his head, not really knowing what to 
say.</br>
<br>"Well... that is awfully nice of you Chad, but I tend to keep to myself and not really get involved with people outside of my personal circle, 
which is mostly comprised of my family." Mr. Sinclair responded genuinely, while waving to his daughter who had looked over toward the two 
of them at that second.</br>
<br>"Oh... well... don't you think I would be part of that personal circle Coach? I mean, I have been playing football for you since before I was a 
freshman here and now I am in the beginning of my senior year. If you do the math, we would have been working together for the past three 
and now going on four years. Hell, you have invited me over to your home a few times to go over new plays and get my opinions on them. 
Don't you think I would be a part of that personal circle?" Chad asked genuinely.</br>
<br>Mr. Sinclair smiled his toothy smile. "Yeah, I suppose you would be right! Hell... never in my years have I ever seen a guy like you play so 
damned well! Believe me when I say this, I have been coaching football for many, many years and I have never seen talent like yours. The way 
you move, the way you throw and just everything about you tells me that you have a bright future ahead of you in football!" Mr. Sinclair said 
with fervor and finesse!</br>
<br>Chad smiled and his face reddened, slightly embarrassed to hear that since he definitely wasn't expecting to hear any of that from him. 
Seeing Chad's reaction, he smiled and gave Chad a slight sideways hug as Chad sat down next to him on the bleachers.</br>
<br> "So... what would you like to know about me? You can ask anything you want about me since... like you said, you are in my personal 
circle!" Mr. Sinclair said warmly.</br>
<br>"Ok... cool!" Said Chad, not expecting to get a free ticket into his life. "So... I just noticed, when you asked the class about what they 
wanted to do, that your bicuspids were unusually long and sharp looking. So... I was wondering, have they always been like that or...?"</br>
<br>"Heh... these old things?" Mr. Sinclair asked as he felt his teeth, exposing them more for Chad to see perfectly, realizing they didn't look 
that different after all. "I have had them all my life, well... since adulthood. Just like any kid, I lost my baby teeth and got my adult ones. I guess 
they are slightly longer and sharper than most, but hey... everyone is different from everyone else. In fact, yours don't look any different from 
my own."</br>
<br>Chad felt his own teeth with his fingers and his tongue and realized that he was right. Chad could remember from the day that he got 
both of his adult set of bicuspids that he enjoyed how long and sharp they were. It made any tough meats that his dad prepared for him pretty 
easy to cut through. Now that he thought about it, his dad even had teeth like him and Mr. Sinclair's.</br>
<br>Pulling Chad out of his reminiscent stupor, Mr. Sinclair spoke again. "Anything else you would like to know? You should make it quick 
since there is about five minutes left till the end of class and you still have yet to change out of your gym clothes!"</br>
<br>"Oh... um... what are you working on... different plays for the next game or something?" Chad asked hurriedly.</br>
<br>"Yeah... I guess you could call them that!" Mr. Sinclair said with a smile.</br>
<br>"Oh... well I was just wondering because I have never seen plays written out like that before!" Chad replied genuinely.</br>
<br>"Well... I like to write things out, give myself time to think about things through and through before I draw them up. Most people think I 
am a visual thinker with how well our plays go over, but the secret to our success is this first step!" He said as he closed the folder and kept the 
files out of Chad's sight, preparing to end the day as well. "Don't you think you should get going, I mean there is about another minute before 
the bell rings!"</br>
<br>Chad smiled and shook his head no. "Nah... I am staying late today. I have my own car and driver's license now, so I can do pretty much 
whatever as long as I am home by a certain time or my parents know that I am staying at a friend's house or something. Besides, I got this 
whistle from a secret admirer and they asked me to meet them in a secret location in about an hour from now, so I am going to take my time 
and just hang out here."</br>
<br>As Chad pulled out the whistle, Mr. Sinclair looked at it, studying it for a second and smiled. "Well... that sure is a nice whistle! Is that pure 
silver?"</br>
<br>"Yeah... whoever sent it to me must have paid a pretty penny for it!" Chad said with a beaming smile.</br>
<br>"Yeah... I am sure they did Chad! Well... I gotta run and take care of a few things before I head out. If you need anything from me, 
anything at all... I will be in my office in the locker room and just come and ask for it while I am here... ok?" Mr. Sinclair said with a warm smile.
</br>
<br>"Sure thing Coach!" Chad exclaimed.</br>
<br>With a smile from the both of them, the bell rang dismissing students for the day. Mr. Sinclair quickly disappeared downstairs and Chad 
sat there for five minutes longer, making sure the locker room would be empty, except for the Coach so he could use the whistle once more. 
He could feel his body begging and urging to hear the sound again, but he couldn't really understand why it was such a big deal, even though 
it made him feel really, really <em>good</em>. Once the five minutes were up and he was reasonably sure that everyone was gone, Chad 
hurried down into the locker room and checked everything out. Chad took his time, slowly walking through the entirety of the locker room and 
made sure that not a single person was there to see him change... if he did. Even the thought of it was weird to Chad, but that whistle was he 
only thing he could think of that would make him grow a beard and get fuzzy ears like he did in that short time. As Chad moved through the 
locker room, he went to see if Mr. Sinclair was there and to his surprise, the coach was no where to be seen! Chad knew that this was definitely 
the most perfect opportunity that he had. Chad increased his pace, going through the rest of the locker room quickly, but stopped at his locker 
when he noticed a piece of paper that was folded in half taped to it. At this point, Chad had scoped out the locker room and no one was 
around, especially since he knew that his locker was at the very end of all of the lockers in the center of the last room with them. Not knowing 
what was really going on anymore, Chad just shrugged his shoulders. Taking the note off the locker, he unfolded it and noticed that it was 
another typed up note so not to give away who actually wrote it. The note read:</br>
<center><em><br>Chad,</br><br>I am glad to have seen that you have used the whistle at least a couple times! I knew that my suspicions 
about you were true and that you were like me! It has been so long since I have come across someone like myself and I know just how awesome 
it will be being our true selves together! Your locker is a very special one, just like you! Once you open the locker, pull the hook in the center 
on the ceiling toward you and you will find your way to where I will be waiting for you! Remember, just wear the whistle and nothing else.</br>
<br>Your secret admirer!</br></em></center>
<br>Thinking this note was the strangest one he had ever received, Chad opened his locker and placed the note inside. While he was curious 
to see if something really did happen if he followed the instructions, he was more curious about what the person meant. How was he 
<em>special</em> and <em>different</em> like whoever this person is? No matter who this person was, Chad knew that he wasn't going to 
meet anyone without taking a quick shower just to freshen up, especially if it was Karen! However, first thing was first, Chad wanted to use the 
whistle just once more. Chad quickly disrobed and left only the whistle to hang in the cleft of his athletic chest muscles. Chad knew that if the 
whistle was the thing that was truly changing him, for the better it seemed, Chad didn't want to take any chances with destroying his clothes 
just incase something really did happen. Now standing there naked, slightly smelly from the day and the activities in gym, Chad decided to use 
the whistle again. As Chad held it in his hand, he noticed that he could feel a slight bit of energy coming off of the thing. Placing it up to his 
lips and pursing them against the metal, he could feel the energy start to enter him, but only at and into his lips. Curious, Chad blew a short 
burst and the high pitched noise made his ears hurt once again, but not as bad as the first or the second time, which was still not as bad as the 
first. As the sound reverberated through his ear canals, he could feel the same energy that was in his hands and on his lips wash over his body 
and slowly pierce his skin, going through every fiber of his being, finally hitting his core. Chad could not believe how invigorated or renewed he 
felt! As Chad stood there, he looked himself over and he noticed nothing had happened yet and just when he was about to blow the whistle 
again, he felt the energy come out of his body and rise to his muscles and his skin, making them tingle furiously. Slowly, he watched his 
muscles increase in size, but just slightly all the while he watched as his body slowly grew more body hair! In places where he remained clean 
shaven, short stubbly hairs now covered his newer and slightly bigger muscles. His arms, legs and recently face and ears grew slightly hairier 
and more dense. His arms and legs definitely looked hairier, not quite as hairy as his dad or even the coach, but it was close. Chad even could 
feel his facial hair was thicker and slightly longer, by an eighth of an inch. Then suddenly his ears started to itch and when he went to scratch 
them... that was the biggest thing of all that he noticed. As he felt them, Chad realized that they came to a very slight point at the tips of his 
ears. Since he could not believe what he was feeling, he had to see it for himself! Chad reopened the locker and stared at the mirror that was 
adhered to the interior of the locker door. There, in his reflection, he saw what his fingers told him! As Chad peered into his reflection, 
unbelieving of what he saw, Chad noticed two things about himself. The first was that his ears definitely came to a slight point, but they 
weren't all that noticeable unless someone looked at them closely. The second was that his face looked slightly off around the mouth and when 
Chad went to inspect, he found that his teeth had lengthened slightly, coming to a definitely longer and sharper point, which looked entirely 
capable of tearing through anything that he bit into.</br>
<br>Looking up to check the time, Chad realized that a half hour had passed and he only had a half hour left before he was to meet up with 
his secret admirer. He felt a little off about meeting whoever it was naked, especially since he is more different now than before, but it was also 
kind of exhilarating! Chad quickly moved to the showers of the locker room, which thankfully weren't too far from his locker and the coach's 
office. Checking to see if the coach came back, he didn't see any sign of him at all, which Chad thought was really weird, but didn't put much 
thought into it. Chad moved into the showers, turned on the water and let it cascade over his new trimmed and slightly more muscled body. It 
was very refreshing to him, but in his opinion, nothing felt like the whistle did! Not wanting to waste any time at all, Chad dispensed a few 
squirts of soap and quickly applied it to his body to clean off any sweat or foul smelling odors. Once he was clean, to his liking anyway, Chad 
turned off the water and grabbed a towel from the near by towel rack, drying his body completely and then hurried back to his locker. On the 
return, which was about fifteen minutes later, there was still no sign of the coach. Chad thought to himself <em>Maybe he had something 
important come up and he had to hurry home.</em> Chad just shrugged his slightly broader shoulders and went back to his locker.</br>
<br>As Chad opened his locker, he saw the piece of paper and read it once more. Thinking it couldn't hurt to follow the instructions, Chad 
hesitantly grasped the hook. He wondered what would happen, but also felt his child like curiosity overcoming him, reminding him of how cool 
he felt that secret passages and such were pretty cool. Following the directions, Chad pulled the hook forward and found that it slid toward him 
with the slightest of ease. Suddenly, there was a loud click and he noticed that his locker and the two next to him were slightly disconnected 
from the wall. Chad closed his locker door and moved to the end of the lockers and inspected them. At the end, it was disconnected and 
pushed outward about a half an inch. He couldn't believe what was going on, first the strange transformative whistle and now a secret door that 
led somewhere... more than likely a secret room under the field house since the locker room was underground as well. Chad could feel his kid-
like nature take control of him and his curiosity got the best of him.</br>
<br>Chad grasped at the edge of the raised lockers and pulled it open, just wide enough for him to get behind it and explore whatever was 
laying it wait. As he opened the door far enough, he saw a long, cement tunnel with piping and corrugated electrical tubing along the tops of 
the walls and the ceiling that supplied power to the single dome lights that illuminated the secret passage every fifteen yards or so. The light 
was not the brightest, but it was enough for him to see. As Chad walked with purpose, he slowly came to another door, but this one was a 
normal wooden door that you would find to seal off any regular room in an apartment or house. Grasping the handle, knowing that it had to be 
five minutes to four now, Chad started to turn it and once there was no more resistance, Chad pulled the door open.</br>
<br>There, standing just beyond the threshold of the door, in all their naked glory was...</br></p>
