<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The boys that represented the Theodore Roosevelt High School basketball team, The Juggernauts, were a rowdy group, well known for their sexual conquests with the girls of not only their school, but every high school they played at across the county. They weren&#39;t as bad as the football team, The Marauders, who got the most plaudits and love from the crowd, this WAS America after all, but the jovial Juggernauts came a close second. Led by Logan Hanley, the rapscallion sixteen year old had led the team to a near blowout season against all the other competitors the previous school year, and in more crude, juvenile terms, all five boys had all blown their loads in extravagant, glorious fashion. They were more sexually experienced than most of the teachers. Anyways, Logan had been such a good player and leader than he had been scouted to play college basketball over the summer and was on a fast track to go on to the NBA. What had been even more impressive is that Logan had maintained a 3.9 GPA in school while doing so. The other boys had looked up to him. Now that the gender wave had hit, and Logan was gone, they were rudderless. <br />
<br />
Not that they minded much.<br />
<br />
Loud moans came from the men&#39;s locker room as Cyril Williams, Manny Bosman, and Xavier Miranda, a recent emigrant from Brazil, pounded into one another with reckless abandon. <br />
<br />
&quot;Who&#39;s my little fuck slut!?&quot; demanded a feminine yet commanding voice, that of Cyril. She had been the biggest guy on the team, and often haggled with Logan&#39;s leadership out of macho posturing(Though mostly in a friendly &quot;breaking each other&#39;s balls&quot; kind of way). Now, Cyril was a petite little firecracker of a woman, meeting only the minimum height requirement to play basketball. Nevertheless, she commanded respect, her posture, charisma, and sheer conviction overriding the two girls who were physically bigger and stronger than her now.   <br />
<br />
&quot;I said, who&#39;s my little fuck SLUT!?&quot;<br />
<br />
Right now she was straddling Xavier, ramming the new Brazilian beauty with an enormous dildo in Xavier&#39;s new vagina while playing with the nipples on her pert tits. Said dildo had magically appeared in his locker, and he had been teased mercilessly for it.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m...I&#39;m your little fuck slut&quot; moaned Xavier, the pleasure of a female orgasm overwhelming her. She passed out for a moment, and then reached up to kiss the beautiful black girl who was acting like a dominatrix.<br />
<br />
Cyril received Xavier&#39;s kiss and returned it in full, and then some. <br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s a good girl&quot; she smiled, and turned around. &quot;I&#39;m next. Manny, you gorgeous negress, please go up gently my rusty sheriff&#39;s badge and don&#39;t be afraid to go rough and ready&quot;, handing Manny the dildo...<br />
<br />
**<br />
<br />
&quot;Why are you looking at me that way?&quot; asked Logan in a huff, clearly annoyed. She was on the way to her house, rattled by today&#39;s events and overall not in a great headspace, whipping her hair out of her face for what felt like the thousandth time today. She practically wanted to run over every car she saw, but took some deep breaths to calm herself down. The novelty of having boobs wore off VERY quickly for poor Logan, and she didn&#39;t need Alan staring at her like a piece of meat like some girl on the cheerleading squad. <br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s just...I think you look really beautiful is all&quot; added Allison meekly, making a cute little frown with her face. Logan took one hand off the driving wheel pointed it at Allison. <br />
<br />
&quot;Spare me. I don&#39;t want to talk about it. As soon as I get home, I&#39;m cutting this ginger mop off. I don&#39;t want to be pretty, and I don&#39;t want any girly girl shit from you.&quot;<br />
<br />
 Allison suddenly turned away and cursed herself. She thought: &quot;I&#39;m coming on too strong. I have to let Logan lead the way if I&#39;m ever going to have a shot at being her girlfriend!&quot;. <br />
<br />

Millie carefully stepped inside the small bathtub with the newly christened Juliana, not wanting to spill any water on the floor. The water was at just the right temperature, as hot as it could be without being scalding. She had poured Mr. Bubbles in for some extra fun. Their long, lithe legs intersected one another&#39;s. They both giggled.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is nice&quot; said Juliana, her hands in the bathtub fingering herself discreetly.<br />
<br />
Millie had her hair up in messy bun, but was still wearing her oversized hipster glasses. <br />
<br />
&quot;So...I guess Drumf isn&#39;t taking this too well&quot; she giggled again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah&quot; giggled Juliana. &quot;She&#39;s surprisingly good looking now. Her hair doesn&#39;t look like a rug anymore.&quot;<br />
<br />
The presidential candidate Drumpf had been one of the people transformed. She had given a brief press conference on television, looking for all the world like a slightly older version of her daughter, and boasted to her insane coterie of paranoid followers that this was a government attack by the President, in league with Drumpf&#39;s &quot;Lying&quot; competitor to permanently emasculate the country once and for all, and the scary part was that they seemed to buy it...<br />
<br />
 Millie grabbed Juliana&#39;s free hand and cupped it in hers. &quot;She&#39;s...something else. I don&#39;t pay attention anymore, it&#39;s what she wants. I was shocked though at how hot the Canadian Prime Minister turned out to be...&quot;<br />
<br />
The two educators stared at one another longingly... <br />
<br />

<br />
Back in Saudi Arabia, Aziz was the first person to wake up. The relentless afternoon sun was baking his...her face. She immediately sat up in a panic. She felt her face, as smooth as a baby&#39;s bottom, and then noticed a curtain of raven black hair in her peripheral vision. She reached up to grab a fistfull of hair...her hair. Then she noticed the cleavage poking out beneath her t-shirt. Aziz, who had never seen so much as the ankle a woman that was not his mother or sister, and he certainly never gazed upon their BREASTS, was mildly stunned, but not shocked. He had watched enough pornography over illegal channels to know what a boob looked like. He then looked at her new smooth hands with a perfect manicure, each nail long and well kept and...girly. Aziz was a boy of twenty and liking nothing more than doing boy&#39;s things like fixing cars and roughhousing with his mates. This femininity felt wrong to him, and the transformation itself was otherworldly.<br />
<br />
Speaking of his mates...<br />
<br />
Aziz looked around, seeing four women, all not dressed in accordance to the state&#39;s religious laws, passed out, scattered all around him. None looked seriously injured. Every single one of them were exotic beauties the likes of which Aziz had never seen in real life. They were GORGEOUS. He had to help them hide before the religious police came and arrested them!</p>
