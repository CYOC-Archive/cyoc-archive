<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Only around ten miles from Jeff lived a small ten-year-old boy named Kieran who was an avid drawer and liked many things. However, his favourite subject was dinosaurs and his favourite of them all was the almighty Tyrannosaurus Rex. Day by day, he drew them and got better with every attempt to the point of them looking very good but he held one key desire. He’d always wanted to be a T-Rex, know what it felt like to be the King of the Dinosaurs but even he knew it was impossible. Still, as he finished his latest drawing and was called down to lunch, Kieran looked out the window with a sigh. “I wish that I could become a T-Rex.” <br />
<br />
As he turned to go downstairs though, he felt a violent shudder pass through him which makes him fall over. “W-what was that?” He stared at the wall as he watched it rapidly rot and decay before the well-built stone walls began to crumble like wet paper as large holes emerged from within. “I’ve gotta get out of here.” He sprinted downstairs only to stop and spy his mom hunched over on the floor in visible pain. “MOM! W-wha-“ She suddenly turned it him and he gasped at the sight of a pterodactyl head bursting from her own. “MOM?!” Her body was suddenly ripped apart as a proper Pterodactyl form ripped from within. “M-Mom?” The Pterodactyl’s head snaps to him with a blank look in its eyes before screeching and launching at him. “MOM!” He slammed the front door in the Pterodactyl’s face as he began to cry. “M-my mom is a d-dinosaur and s-she h-hates me!” He felt a sudden thrill go through his body again as he fell over again. “W-what’s h-happening? W-why does this f-feel so w-weird?” As his heart pounded, he looked around to see his house and many others crumbling into nothing as a jungle emerges everywhere. &quot;W-why i-is t-t-this-AGH!&quot;<br />
<br />
As Kieran  tried to stand back up, he fell over again as he felt his legs painfully shift and bend so he’d always be standing on his toes. “W-why?!” He heard his feet crack and bend as he watched his toes merge into just three stubby digits covered in brown skin that sprout three black claws. “W-wai-t!” He managed to struggle to his feet as his legs were covered in the brown scales and they grew to over four feet in height. “Why do I look like a-NNNNGH!” He felt his torso violently expand outwards as his organs and bones shifted to accommodate, becoming very wide and overweight by human standards but perfectly normal for a certain dinosaur. “A-T-Rex! I’m becoming a T-Rex!” His joy caused him to miss that his vastly increased body weight was too much for his spine as he was forced into a permanent hunched over stance. “This is so cool!” <br />
<br />
Even so, the sensation of his skin darkening and toughening into a strange brown skin similar in texture to leather made Kieran feel dizzy. “I feel si-i-ick.” He groaned in pain as a tail erupted from his rear, feeling it smash away some rubble from his former house but he was too busy looking down at his changing arms. With a loud crack, they split in half as his fingers merged into just two stubby appendages tipped with black claws although watching any of this was hard since his chest and thus arms were recessed back from his head due to his new stance. Despite the dramatic changes, Kieran was delighted.  “This is so croool.” He blinked and cleared his throat which he could feel tingling very uncomfortably. “Tris is wrrrray crool.” He coughed several times as he heard his voice getting deeper with each passing word. “Sroooooo wrrrrrrd.” He blinked as his words were barely even English by this point. “Grrrrs rrrr’s nrrrrt lrrrrng unrrrrtl rrrrri rrrrse srrrrrrch. Rrrrrng rrrrrto rrrrrrnorrrrrrrr.” <br />
<br />
With that final loss of language, his neck violently expanded to become almost as thick as his stomach; his head now being harder to turn but feeling the sheer power in his neck and body. He growled approvingly as he stomped the remains of a car into rapidly disintegrating scrap. &quot;RrrrrrrrrNGH!&quot; He felt his jaw violently dislocate as it suddenly widened, giving him a significant maw whilst his head warped and shifted into a more saurian appearance. &quot;Grrrrrrrrrrrr.&quot; All of his teeth began falling out, being replaced with razor sharp fangs as even his tongue enlarged whilst his entire face pushed out into a wide jawline. &quot;Rrrrrrrrrrrrng.&quot; Finally, he felt his head reshape so it was much flatter with all of his air swiftly falling out but he also had to shut his shut his eyes due to them burning and itching. When he reopened them, his eyesight was substantially worse; very blurry, unfocused and in black and white whilst his schlera had turned bright amber. All in all, he&#39;d become a healthy young Tyrannosaurus Rex as he looked himself over. &quot;Rrrrrrrrrr.&quot; Now what happens?</p>
