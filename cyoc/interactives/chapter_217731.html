<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Before Jeff is able to decide, he suddenly hears the front door open, “ANYBODY HOME,” he then hears a familiar voice call, the former teens eyes widen in shock: it was the voice of his dad Marc!<br />
<br />
‘No no no… what the hell is dad doing here,’ Jeff thinks to himself, the transformed teen looks around frantically, his eyes then land on his reflection: the naked form of his mother! Jeff feels the panic in him grow, ‘I can’t let him see me like this,’ he thinks, ‘what am I supposed to do?’<br />
<br />
Jeff is so panicked, that the easiest solution to his situation, which would be simply transforming back into himself, does not occur to him, ‘I got to get some clothes on,’ is all he thinks, before quietly sneaking into his parents bed room. There he opens his mother’s wardrobe and pulls out a pair of white lace panties, a matching bra and a blue dress and quickly changes into them, strangely Jeff finds it not difficult to strap the bra on him, it feels as if he’d done it before. ‘Did some of my mother’s instincts, actions, thoughts, personality… enter my mind when I transformed into her,’ Jeff asks himself, he has no time to find an answer as he hears footsteps coming up the stairs and a second later the door to the bed room opens, standing before him is his dad Marc.<br />
<br />
“Jane,” Marc asks, sounding surprised, “weren’t you supposed to be in Florida at a meeting?”<br />
<br />
‘Fuck… think Jeff, think,’ Jeff thinks to himself, “um… the meeting… the meeting didn’t go as long as we thought,” he then says.<br />
<br />
Marc tilts his head, “I see,” he says.<br />
<br />
“And why are YOU back already,” “Jane” asks.<br />
<br />
Marc groans, “some idiot, who we needed to seal the deal, did not show up,” he says, not sounding all to pleased, “so, the meeting has been postponed”.<br />
<br />
“Oh,” Jeff says, “sorry to hear that”.<br />
<br />
Marc nods, “where are the kids,” he then asks.<br />
<br />
“Riley is at a friend’s house and I don’t know where Jeff is, probably spending the weekend with his girlfriend,” the “woman” says, ‘man, this feels so weird, talking about myself as my mom,’ Jeff thinks to himself.<br />
<br />
Hearing that the kids aren’t home causes Marc to smile, he slowly walks up to Jane, Jeff gulps when he notices a strange sparkle in his dad’s eyes, next thing he knows is his dad wrapping his strong arms around him and a second later he is kissing “Jane” on the mouth. Marc pulls back with a grin, “so… we have the house to ourselves,” he says, “what a perfect opportunity for some… fun,” the man gives his “wife” a wink, and Jeff KNOWS what his father means, causing the teen to panic.<br />
<br />
“S-sorry… Marc,” the “woman” says, “but… I am not really in the mood”.<br />
<br />
Jeff’s eyes widen when he feels his dad’s hands on his butt, giving it a squeeze, “oh…. Come on Jane,” his dad says, a lustful tone to his voice, “we hadn’t had fun for a while, I am so pent up, what better opportunity is there than now, while the kids are out of the house? Please!”<br />
<br />
Jeff shakes his head and pushes his dad away, “I said “no”,” he says, “I really am NOT in the mood!”<br />
<br />
Marc is about to argue, but being a smart man, he knows that it would cause his wife to get even madder, he really didn’t want that. The man lets go of “Jane”, “okay… sorry,” he says, “then… what do you want to do?”<br />
<br />
“I want to be left alone,” Jeff says, “I really am tired and totally stressed out from the long journey,” he walks past his dad and out of the room.<br />
<br />
“What about watching a movie,” Marc asks, “that should calm both of us down”.<br />
<br />
“No… I really just want to be left alone,” Jeff says, and with that he walks down the stairs.<br />
<br />
After “Jane” has left, Marc lets out a sigh as he sits down on his bed, “I never saw Jane this tensed before,” he says to himself, “I still believe sex, or at least a movie with a nice glass of wine, would do us both good. But, knowing her, she won’t change her mind, but… I have another why to make her relax,” he then pulls out his phone and smiles, “actually, this is the best situation to try out this Chroonivac App I stumbled upon”. Marc opens the App and scans the house, after a short while, his phone gives off a “ping” and he notices two files appear, one with his name and the other with his wife’s name. Smiling to himself, he opens Jane’s file and reads through the information, his eyes widen, “wow, this thing knows everything about her,” he says, “pretty scary, but also very interesting. I think, before I try any sort of transformation, I think I’ll decrease her stress level, to make her feel more relaxed”. Jeff’s dad then moves the stress level of his wife, which is at 80%, down to 0%, and confirms the change, “now, to see if it worked,” he says to himself, he gets up and walks down into the kitchen where he can hear “Jane” rummage around.<br />
<br />
When Marc confirms the transformation, Jeff suddenly feels his tenseness and panic start to fade, he can’t help but feel more and more relaxed, ‘I don’t know why I felt so tensed and panicked,’ he thinks to himself, ‘Marc… I mean dad… he only was trying to help. I should have not snapped at him like that’. He then hears footsteps behind him and when he turns he finds Marc standing in the doorway.<br />
<br />
“How are you feeling, Jane,” Marc asks.<br />
<br />
“A little better,” the “woman” says, “sorry that I snapped at you. I just felt so tensed… it just has been a stressful day”.<br />
<br />
“No need to apologize,” Marc says, smiling, ‘looks like it worked,’ he thinks to himself.<br />
<br />
“You know,” “Jane” then says, “watching a movie does actually sound like a great idea. Do you have something in mind?”<br />
<br />
“How about something romantic,” Marc asks, “we could have some snacks and wine. I know that especially red wine helps to calm you down”.<br />
<br />
Jeff thinks for a while, ‘hmmm… I always wanted to try wine, but my parents never aloud it. Now that I am a grown woman, I don’t think they’ll mind,’ he thinks to himself. He smiles at Marc, “sounds like a plan,” he says, “why don’t you set everything up, while I shove some frozen Pizza into the oven?”<br />
<br />
Marc smiles, “sure,” he says, he then heads to the living room, a big smile on his face, ‘that App really is amazing,’ he thinks to himself, ‘I can’t wait to try out more’.</p>
