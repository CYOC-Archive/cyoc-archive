<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After calling around and eventually locating Kyle&#39;s house, they make their move.  The girls get in Jen&#39;s car and drive to a nearby hardware store.  They purchase a bundle of rope and a towel.  Then they go across the street to Wal-Mart and buy a stun gun.  On the way to Kyle&#39;s street, Ashley ties the towel at the ends to form a makeshift gag.  They park outside of his home and Ashley walks up to his door and knocks.  Kyle comes to answer, but didn&#39;t realize Jennifer was hiding in the bushes next to his front door.<br />
&quot;Transform or dare, Kyle,&quot; Jen says before firing the stun gun onto his neck.  The scrawny creep blacks out shortly afterwards.<br />
When Kyle comes to, he finds himself naked and tied to a chair in his basement.  He also discovers the towel stuffed in his mouth, effectively preventing him from doing anything more then making grunts and hums.<br />
&quot;How&#39;s it going Kyle?&quot; Jen asks condescendingly.  &quot;You seem to find yourself in some predicament here,&quot; she smiles.  &quot;It&#39;s a shame you so rudely ignored my question upstairs.  And by the way, your minute is long gone.  So let&#39;s get started shall we?&quot; she asks in a bubbly voice.  &quot;For your transformation, every time you hear the word &#39;payback&#39;, your body will slowly become more and more feminine until you&#39;re entirely that.  A woman,&quot; she says.  &quot;And let&#39;s get that dare out of the way.  I dare you to &#119847;&#119838;&#119855;&#119838;&#119851; say the phrase &#39;transform or dare&#39; again.  This will be the last turn anyone takes for a while.  So no going back for you,&quot; she elaborates.<br />
&quot;Good,&quot; Ashley adds.<br />
&quot;Now, time for some &#119849;&#119834;&#119858;&#119835;&#119834;&#119836;&#119844;.  Right, Ashley?&quot; Jen says.  The little amount of body hair Kyle has retracts.  Jen smiles.<br />
&quot;Yeah, some &#119849;&#119834;&#119858;&#119835;&#119834;&#119836;&#119844; sounds good for all we went through, Jen,&quot; Ashley says.  Kyle&#39;s feet start to change, his toes become smaller as his feet turn petite and smooth.  Jen&#39;s smile grows wide.<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s do this, &#119849;&#119834;&#119858;&#119835;&#119834;&#119836;&#119844;, &#119849;&#119834;&#119858;&#119835;&#119834;&#119836;&#119844;, &#119849;&#119834;&#119858;&#119835;&#119834;&#119836;&#119844;,&quot; Jen repeats.  Kyle&#39;s calves turn sleek and smooth.  His thighs begin to grow, they become soft and smooth themselves.  He rises a little in his chair as his ass starts to fill out, pushing him upwards just a little.  His extending legs aid this process.  Finally, his hips widen to match the new width of his thighs and ass.  His lower half is now very feminine, and very sexy.  Except for one thing, his well below average penis.  Jennifer gets on her knees between Kyle&#39;s legs to get a closer look.  She looks him dead in the eyes with a smile on her face.<br />
&quot;&#119823;&#119834;&#119858;&#119835;&#119834;&#119836;&#119844;,&quot; she says.  His already less than impressive member begins slowly shrinking.  The shaft disappearing into his crotch.  His ball sack shrivels up completely as his testicles pop into his body and move off to become part of his newly forming female genitals.  His penis head absorbs into the flesh leaving new pink pussy lips.  Kyle is now squirming and squealing in his chair, realizing the dire situation he&#39;s  in.<br />
&quot;&#119823;&#119834;&#119858;&#119835;&#119834;&#119836;&#119844;,&quot; Jennifer and Ashley begin alternating quickly.  The effects of their words move to his stomach.  His pudgy stomach flattens down to a sexy skinny physique where you can distinguish his ribs.  His waist starts moving in as his bones and organs shift accordingly.  It keeps shrinking until it becomes tiny, its only function to amplify the new size of his hips and ass.  While shrinking, it also reduced the height of his torso, furthering the sexiness of his long legs on this shorter body.  The radius of his nipples starts to expand and he feels pressure building up behind them.  His shoulders, hands, and arms narrow down, becoming soft, slender, and smooth.  His finger nails grow out.  The pressure that has been building inside his chest finally releases as the flesh pillows out in pulses.  Every heart beat causing the emerging mounds of flesh to increase in size.  They balloon out to at least DDs before finally stopping.  The next part to convert is his neck.  Slowly decreasing in size, his Adam&#39;s apple disappears.  His face begins shaping into that of a well structured and beautiful woman.  His cheeks and facial bones readjusting to give him appealing features.  His nose becomes petite and brown eyes turn into a gorgeous blue as his lashes grow longer.  His lips begin to plump and become succulent.  Lastly, his black hair shifts into a light brown as it rapidly grows down to just below his shoulders.<br />
The chair that once held a creepy little dweeb now holds an astonishing woman that could have any man tripping over himself for her.  This is exactly what Jen was hoping for.<br />
&quot;Now, I&#39;m not going to go into the details, Kylie, but I happen to be in possession of two uses of this power, so I&#39;ll ask you once again.  Transform or dare,&quot; Jennifer says with a evil look.  Kylie&#39;s eyes widen.  She knows she can&#39;t answer with the gag in her mouth, so she sits there helplessly while her minute runs out.<br />
&quot;Rude, rude girl.  You really need to learn how to answer people Kylie.  We&#39;ll deal with that, but first, considering the ordeal you had me go through today, you must be fascinated with the female orgasm,&quot; Jennifer says.  &quot;I can help you experience plenty.  Let&#39;s go with a mental transformation this time, huh?  That sound fun, right?  For your transformation, your brain will only find slutty clothes appealing to wear.  You won&#39;t ever feel like wearing something conservative.  It&#39;s either sexy or nothing.  If you&#39;re forced to wear a uniform, you will find some way to sexy it up,&quot; she says.  &quot;Now for that problem you seem to have with answering questions.  I dare you to constantly act flirty to guys and gals alike, but if they ask you for sexual activity, you will &#119834;&#119845;&#119856;&#119834;&#119858;&#119852; say yes.  You&#39;ll just be &#119852;&#119848; &#119838;&#119834;&#119840;&#119838;&#119851; to please them,&quot; she says.  Jennifer looks over to Ashley and nods.  Her friend walks up to Kylie and pulls the gag out of her mouth.<br />
&quot;Holy shit! What did you do?&quot; Kylie yells in her new sultry voice.<br />
&quot;It seemed pretty obvious to us,&quot; Jen says.  &quot;Listen, I don&#39;t care how you feel about your new situation slut, and honestly I don&#39;t want to hear from you.  Jill off in that chair until me and Ash are out of here,&quot; she adds.  Kylie&#39;s body start frantically squirming in her rope, trying to get her hands free.  Ashley reaches down and unties the rope.  Kylie&#39;s hands immediately plunge into her already sopping pussy violently.  Her eyes rolling back as she leans back in the chair.  Jennifer and Ashley laugh to each other and begin to head up the stairs.  They get in Jen&#39;s car and decide to...</p>
