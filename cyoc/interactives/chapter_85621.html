<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Sparked on by his memories of humiliation and fears of never being independent from his parents Jeff couldn&#39;t allow himself to select anything under 25 as how he would look now.<br />
Over the last four years, the memories of being less capable than his fellow students had haunted him. Now that would all change.<br />
<br />
He selected 26 and pressed go still resenting the ridicule.<br />
<br />
How would they like it being picked last in everything? Struggling with lifting things that a normal male teen should be able to handle? Hitting your head on everything by seventh grade? Needing to shave by 8th grade? Huh?<br />
<br />
The effects were already taking hold mentally though the physical changes had only gotten him back to where he looked before playing with the Chronivac. <br />
<br />
His stomach grumbled as his torso elongated even more and filled out with muscle. Having the build of a fully grown adult throughout high school makes you very likely to be popular with the coaches and encouraged to be on every team. Colleges have already offered him sports scholarships even though his grades aren&#39;t anywhere near what they where when he was prepubescent. <br />
<br />
The Chronivac beeped that it was done, the transformation seemed instantaneous. Jeff stood up with a little grunt, he felt much more massive than when he clicked go. How did he miss this happening? <br />
<br />
Everything seemed simultaneously familiar and strange as he walked to the bathroom mirror. He knew he was taller but the new vantage point didn&#39;t seem any different from normal.<br />
<br />
Getting to the bathroom he stepped inside without turning on the light; even from his silhouette he could tell that he was an extremely muscular young man. Thinking back, he remembered showing the first signs of puberty around 7 or 8. He was taken to the doctors many times to find out what started his puberty so early. DCFS got involved thinking his parents might be giving him hormones and Jeff was asked lots of questions about what he ate, did, if anyone ever gave him pills or strange candy. Thankfully, DCFS could find no wrongdoing and stopped harassing his family.<br />
<br />
By 5th grade Jeff was able to grow sideburns, which he diligently removed, and his voice was changing, which was much harder to hide. He was terribly out of place with the rest of the class, and well, kids could be cruel. Every question and comment in Sex Ed class made the students look at Jeff as an example, they weren&#39;t trying to make it awkward but the situation was extremely embarrassing for him. Jeff always stood out in a crowd, was always assumed to be the older, more responsible one, was always remembered by everyone when introduced especially when his true age was given, and always had to be on his best behavior. It didn&#39;t help that the attention from everyone in the class gave him a raging erection and he didn&#39;t know what to do with it. <br />
<br />
It was maddening, but that fateful day in Sex Ed class was the turning point. The other kids in his class looked at him with new understanding and in some cases, envy. Answering the quick, shy questions in the hall about what a boy could expect in a few years made him an instant hit with the boys. The acceptance boosted his confidence and the girls suddenly seemed to notice him much more acutely.<br />
<br />
It was around this time that Jeff was pulled out of team sports in gym class. Basketball, baseball, kickball, flag football... Jeff being larger and more muscular than any of the other students had a huge advantage, and as the difference only widened with time, he was too much of a risk for the school. The insurance risk of having a 200 lb student running full speed with a 80lb student was too much, so the gym teacher put him in the weight room and let Jeff go to town under the supervision of the assistant coach or sometimes, student helper. <br />
<br />
By 8th grade he would have more easily fit in with the high school seniors or college freshmen. His classmates had grown to treat him as an equal but the older students who were truly 18-19 called him a freak and said he must be really dumb to be held back to middle school. The years of structured weightlifting with one on one guidance had a dramatic impact on his physique, He looked as though he could be the defense on the varsity football team. At this point he was shaving daily to keep from growing a full beard and he seemed to look more and more like his father every day.<br />
<br />
9th grade came with much excitement for Jeff, he would be able to spend time with those he fit in with mentally, as well as physically. He held the admiration of many of the high schools men, which made some act cruel from jealousy, others were kind and tried to understand how Jeff had become so masculine, and others would appraise from afar. The females liked that he exuded maturity and masculinity. Jeff lost his virginity the second day of high-school and had a steady string of girlfriends after that. After his third girlfriend, Jeff got classified as man slut in female circles. Due to the rumors that were spread, the ladies thought he would go out with a girl if she offered him sex, and it turned out he would, but that was never a requirement of his. He never had to look for a girlfriend, they just seemed to fall out of the woodwork and make themselves available to him.<br />
<br />
Throughout 9th grade, whatever faint traces of childhood remained, disappeared completely, at least physically. As May began and the school year was coming to an end Jeff noticed that by noon each day he had a blanket of stubble, despite shaving that morning around 6am.<br />
<br />
That was last school year Jeff realized, noticing that he was standing in a dark bathroom staring at his silhouette. The memories faded and Jeff realized that the Chronivac had completely rewritten his life in 2 minutes. <br />
<br />
Without further hesitation, while still having the momentary perspective of the original Jeff, he flipped on the light. With the new perspective pushed into the back of his mind, the only thing Jeff could do is gape and say, &quot;weird&quot;. As the words left his throat they sounded like his but not at the same time.<br />
<br />
The first thing he noticed was that he was built like a WWF wrestler and really tan. He then recalled getting his first job over the summer at a lawn care service and working outside all summer doing physical labor. He spent a moment taking his shirt off and appreciating the effects of his new history on his physique. 8 pack abs, firm chest, bulging biceps, all his. Slightly more body hair than he remembered but I guess that happens naturally when your body&#39;s development is 10 years farther than it was last time you looked. Specifically hair had appeared on his chest, shoulders, and back; it was now thicker everywhere else.<br />
<br />
His face had undergone the most drastic change aside from the muscle mass. No longer did boyish cuteness reflect back at him from the mirror. Baby fat had long since melted away and been replaced with muscle and stubble. In this reality, his ear length, unkempt hair had been replaced with a short, easily managed, haircut that let all his masculine features show.</p>
