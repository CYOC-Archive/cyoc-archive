<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The following Morning Ryan spent hungover even worse than the night before…<br />
<br />
His memories were so strange…<br />
<br />
He could swear he was at Sparks last night. He remembers dancing, partying, someone taking a shot out of his cleavage….<br />
<br />
Wait….what? That didn’t make any sense. <br />
<br />
There was a sudden knock on his door as Ryan stood up and went to answer the door. To his shock and surprise it was the strange woman from yesterday.<br />
<br />
She was standing there wearing a skin tight silver mini dress with matching heels. Her super long hair was tied up in a large bun.<br />
<br />
“You fool…I warned you…” She said barging in.<br />
<br />
“Umm…can I help you?” Ryan asked.<br />
<br />
“Shut the door and sit down!” She said angrily.<br />
<br />
Ryan was bit taken back as he nodded as closed the door and sat down as he looked at her.<br />
<br />
“I warned you! I told you to handcuff yourself or lock yourself up! Don’t you realize that was for your own protection! You could have been rid of the curse but now it is even stronger!” She said facepalming yourself.<br />
<br />
“What the hell are you talking about?” Ryan asked.<br />
<br />
The woman pulled up pictures on her phone showing Ryan pictures of Rebecca dancing at sparks. Drinking and partying.<br />
<br />
“You know her?” Ryan asked.<br />
<br />
“Of course I do…she is you!” The woman said.<br />
<br />
Ryan was a bit taken back at this news. What the hell did she mean?<br />
<br />
“I warned you not to go out last night….but did you listen? No! Of course not. Worse you came to my club!” She said.<br />
<br />
Ryan was a bit surprised. “Wait you are the owner of Sparks?” <br />
<br />
“A co-owner yes. My husband and I started it together. Now our daughter is mixed up in your bullshit…” The woman said angry.<br />
<br />
“Wait who is your daughter?” Ryan asked.<br />
<br />
“The woman pulled out her phone and showed her a picture of a girl that looked so familiar…Ryan didn’t realize it yet but it was Taylor from the night before.<br />
<br />
“Please…I don’t understand…explain everything to me.” Ryan said.<br />
<br />
“You are cursed kid…The same curse I received 30 years ago.” The woman said.<br />
<br />
“Wait…curse?” Ryan asked.<br />
<br />
“You have heard of werewolves right? Well you are a were-girl. Or a were-woman depending on how you look at age. The concept it similar but unique in many ways.” She explained.<br />
<br />
Ryan was a bit taken back. Wait…Mindy…Her little outburst…was this real?<br />
<br />
“30 years ago when I was about 20 right around your age I was a boy named Jeremy. I was dating a girl named Sarah and we thought we were in love. I was young and stupid. Sarah had a hot friend and one night after partying I took her friend home. We slept together and the next morning I felt so guilty I told Sarah myself. She didn’t take it very well. She broke up with me and cursed me. I didn’t realize at the time but Sarah was actually a witch and that curse was very real…” The woman explained.<br />
<br />
“So…you are actually a man?” Ryan asked a bit creeped out.<br />
<br />
“Not anymore…Eventually the curse grew to the point where I became stuck like this…eventually I accepted myself and embraced my new female life. I got married had a child even. Then I saw you, I immediately knew you had the same curse. My daughter is here now and I don’t want her getting wrapped up with a cursed person like yourself.” She said.<br />
<br />
Ryan was a bit taken back…She was saying he and Rebecca were the same person? That he transformed into her? His head was spinning.<br />
<br />
“Okay…let’s just say for one minute I believe this…why do you even care?” It’s not like my curse affects your daughter?” Ryan asked.<br />
<br />
“That’s where you are wrong! Were-girls as they get stronger can influence those around them. Make girls act more like them. Make boys fall for them…It’s like a seductive aura…like a musk they can’t resist. I don’t want my daughter anywhere near you. I want her to focus on school.” The woman said.<br />
<br />
“Listen…tell me about this curse…maybe I can stop it?” Ryan asked.<br />
<br />
The woman laughed a bit. “Good luck, my ex-girlfriend actually tried. Eventually she felt pity for me and tried to counter her own curse but by then it had gotten too strong.” She said.<br />
<br />
“Well maybe there is things we don’t know yet!” Ryan said pleading.<br />
<br />
“Fine…so…similar to a werewolf. The curse starts off only changing you on the three nights of a full moon each month. You become an incredibly sexy party girl who loves socializing and sex more than anything…You wake up the next morning with little more than hazy memories, the other you is basically another person in control of your body at this time…<br />
<br />
However over time the curse spreads…it gets stronger. Soon it starts affecting you more than just full moons. Before you know it the curse starts happening every night…Then eventually it starts randomly happening through the day…until eventually you wake up and…well…you are stuck like this forever.”<br />
<br />
“Is there anything you can do to fight it?” Ryan asked.<br />
<br />
“Like I told you last night. You can lock yourself up. The one upside to the curse is that after every change you gain a little bit more control…but.” She said.<br />
<br />
“But what?” Ryan asked.<br />
<br />
“But…that doesn’t mean the urges stop. I’m the beginning I didn’t think it was that bad because I never remembered what did. Eventually I did start remembering. Worse eventually I still aware after the transformation. Like a passenger inside my own body. Eventually I was able to stay in control at night but the urges were so strong I couldn’t resist my desires.” She replied.<br />
<br />
“Listen kid…you seem like a nice guy. I wouldn’t wish this life on anyone. Even now my body is still cursed. I can’t wear clothes that aren’t sexy in some way. High heels are the only shoes I can wear that feel comfortable anymore. I can’t even cut my hair or trim my nails. I’m horny all the time and while I may look good despite my age…I would give anything to have my old life back.” She said.<br />
<br />
Ryan was surprised. For a woman over 50 she didn’t look a day over 35. However there was a sadness to her eyes. He could tell she was telling the truth.<br />
<br />
“Wait…maybe we could meet up again? You could offer me more help if I need it?” Ryan asked.<br />
<br />
“No kid…I’ve already told you everything I know. The rest is on you.” She said before leaving without even saying her name.<br />
<br />
Ryan sat there for hours pondering everything he had just heard. Could this be true? What was he supposed to do?</p>
