<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;You little moron!&quot; shouted Simon at his 7-year-old friend as he rushed over to the computer. He had to reverse Heather's change fast. He just hoped it wasn't too late.<br />
<br />
After pulling his long hair out of his face again, Simon called up Heather's information to see that her current age read &quot;0&quot; as Ed had set it. Quickly, he tried to type &quot;12&quot;, Heather's normal age, but, because he was rushing, he accidentally typed &quot;21&quot;.<br />
<br />
He hit &quot;enter&quot; and again a glow shot from the emitter straight at the puddle where Heather used to be. The puddle formed itself back into an embryo, which rapidly grew into a baby.<br />
<br />
Simon let out a sigh of relief as he watched the baby grow older, which reminded him of watching a tree grow in a time lapse film. It appeared that Heather would be back to normal soon.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, thank God,&quot; said Ed.<br />
<br />
&quot;You're lucky you little punk. She could have died,&quot; said Simon. Heather was now about 3 years old and looking more like a girl than a baby.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sorry, dude,&quot; whined Ed. &quot;How was I supposed to know how old the machine though zero was? I thought it'd just make one of us a baby or something.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Guys,&quot; squeaked a little girls voice. Both of them looked over at Heather. She was now about 6 years old. She stood up off of the ground and said, &quot;What the hell just happened to me? That was sooo weird. I mean, Everything just went black for a few moments, and then I opened my eyes again, and I was a baby growing older.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Genius boy here decided to set your age back to zero and you disappeared into a puddle,&quot; said Simon.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey,&quot; piped little Ed. &quot;It was an honest mistake. I'm sorry, okay.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, well you could have killed her with that honest mistake. You could have killed any of us.&quot; said Simon.<br />
<br />
As the two of them argued, Heather felt her body pass into puberty. Her girlish figure started to fill out again to look like it had been before she was changed, but instead of stopping at 12, her growth just seemed to keep going. Her breasts continued to expand as her hips and butt grew larger and more mature. All the while, her height just kept increasing. Already, she was over 5' tall.<br />
<br />
Realizing that her changes weren't stopping she said, &quot;Um, guys. I think you might've overdid it here.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hearing her more mature voice, Simon and Ed stopped arguing and looked over at her. Their eyes went wide as they realized that she was now a teenager, and a cute one at that. Her breasts had filled out to B-cups while the rest of her body had taken on distinctly womanly curves. The boys were both amazed at how sexy she looked now.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow,&quot; said Simon. He couldn't think of any other words just then.<br />
<br />
Seeing how they were staring at her, Heather did her best to cover up her breasts and crotch with her arms.<br />
<br />
&quot;You perverts!&quot; she shouted.<br />
<br />
But in spite of covering herself up, her growth continued underneath her arms, making her curves more pronounced and even sexier.<br />
<br />
&quot;What'd you do to me now?&quot; she asked. &quot;I'm still growing!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Um,&quot; said Simon, still stunned by her beautiful growing body. &quot;I guess I must have put in the wrong age when I changed you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Great,&quot; she said in an unmistakably adult voice. &quot;What now? Am I going to turn into an old woman? Huh?&quot;<br />
<br />
Simon checked her stats again.<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; he said. &quot;I just put in your age in reverse. You're going to be 21. I was really rushing at the time. Sorry.&quot;<br />
<br />
Just as he said that, Heather's changes stopped. As Simon had said, she was 21 now, a fully grown woman in the prime of her life. She looked her body over, first checking out her cleavage and then her round, firm behind.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmmm,&quot; she said. &quot;Well, I guess I can't really complain. How could I be angry at you for making me look sexier? Though, grab me a blanket or something. This isn't a peep show.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;S-Sure,&quot; stammered Simon. He ran off to grab a blanket off of his bed.<br />
<br />
Ed just stood there staring at her in awe. In spite of being only 7 years old, he still had his adolescent mind with all of its cravings.<br />
<br />
&quot;Close your eyes, dweeb, or I'll give you a spanking,&quot; said Heather. Ed gasped and quickly turned his back to her. She was a bit frightening now, considering that he now stood eye level to her belly button. That spanking was no idle threat.<br />
<br />
Simon returned and tossed her the blanket. She wrapped herself up with it toga style.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can I turn around now?&quot; said a slightly scared Ed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; replied Heather. &quot;I'm no longer naked.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ed turned around as Simon sat down back at the computer.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can change you back now,&quot; said Simon.<br />
<br />
&quot;Um, maybe not now,&quot; said Heather. She smiled a mischievous grin. &quot;Can I try on some of your mom's clothes first? None of mine will fit me. Can I? Please?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, sure. I guess,&quot; said Simon.<br />
<br />
Heather let out a happy little squeak as she hopped into the air.<br />
<br />
&quot;Cool! Thanks!&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
Then, she ran off toward Simon's parents' room. Simon and Ed just looked at each other.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is... weird,&quot; said Simon.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I know,&quot; said Ed. &quot;She kinda scares me now, 'specially since I'm so small. Can you make me older again, please?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't think so,&quot; said Simon, &quot;You can stay that way for a little while. It'll be a good punishment. You deserve it for almost killing Heather.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, come on, dude,&quot; said Ed. &quot;It was just a mistake.&quot; He sat down a pouted a minute looking every bit the sullen 7-year-old that he had become. &quot;This is so not fair.&quot;<br />
<br />
A few minutes later, Heather reappeared in the room and said, &quot;Okay, boys, what do you think of this?&quot;<br />
<br />
She was wearing...</p>
