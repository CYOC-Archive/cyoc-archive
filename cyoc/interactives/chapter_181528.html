<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The morning light came through the window above the shutter door, jenny caressing her face with its pleasant warmth, yet she kept her eyes shut, trying to get a few more moments of peace, that I before she herd whispering<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you sure we should do this?&quot; Asked Momo &quot;they look so peaceful&quot; sighed Lucy, Lina had no idea what they were going on about<br />
<br />
&quot;Listen, sooner or later there going to find out&quot; said Sofia sternly, before chuckling evily &quot; plus, ist been a while since iv used this on anyone&quot;.<br />
Lina could here something plastic rattling, whatever Sofia had planned was not going to be good,<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok fine&quot; said Momo &quot;on three, One,Two-&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh forget it!&quot; Shouted Sofia before the loud sound of an air horn reverberated around the room &quot;RISE AND SHINE&quot; Shouted Sofia, as she begins to roll back and forth on the ground in fits of laughter, Momo and Lucy looking away trying to play innocent.<br />
<br />
Viki shot bolt upright, looking around for the sorce of the sound before glaring towards the trio, she then grabbed her pillow and threw it at Sofia, obviously this scenario had happened before,<br />
<br />
&quot;You Jerk!&quot; Shouted Viki &quot; you know that scares the babies, it&#39;s bad for them!&quot;<br />
Sofia was still rolling around, now clutching the pillow that was thrown at her while tears of lagoon streamed down her face &quot; maby but I know that laughter is good for me!&quot; she weezed before starting to calm down<br />
Everyone then looked towards where Lina was, she had sprung out of the makeshift bed over the coffee table and into the recline, her face was painted with shock her hands resting on her belly as the babies within had their eyes wide like saucers looking around for the sound that woke them up, before they begin kicking and squirming.<br />
<br />
&quot; oh perfect&quot; said Lina &quot; just what I need first thing&quot; she grumbled looking up at the group, her hair knotted and a small line on her face where she had been drooling in the night<br />
&quot;Wow, you are not a morning person are you?&quot; Said Viki, receiving a menacing glare from Lina before turning to Sofia, who gulped suddenly not finding her situation funny anymore<br />
<br />
&quot;You&quot; said Lucy in a dangerously low voice &quot; you can start making me feel better by getting me a decaf going&quot; she said while walking towards the bathroom, then looking over her shoulder at Momo and Lucy, who shrunk back from her gaze &quot;that goes for you two as well, NOW&quot; she said before shutting the door<br />
<br />
Everyone stood there shocked, she was such a nice sweet girl yesterday, but waking her up on the wrong side of the bed was like poking a sleeping grizzly bear!, soon they all snaped out of it as her words sank in<br />
<br />
&quot;I got the decaf&quot; said Momo suddenly in a rush &quot; iv got the kettle&quot; &quot;I&#39;ve got the milk&quot; said Lucy and Sofia, before the three looked at Viki &quot;What about you&quot; said Lucy <br />
<br />
Viki just smiled &quot; oh I haven&#39;t done anything to her&quot; she said as she pressed a button and the bed reverted back into a sofa &quot;I&#39;m off the hook!&quot; she laughed before turning, hearing a flush and running water, before the door opened and out stepped Lina<br />
<br />
Her face now in a smile like nothing had happened, before walking over to the kitchen area and gently taking the cup of decaf coffee from Sofia, who&#39;s mouth as well as Momo&#39;s and Lucy&#39;s hung agape<br />
<br />
&quot;What?, oh right, thanks for the coffee&quot; Lina smiled as she waddled back towards the couch and sat down before starting up conversation with Viki<br />
<br />
Back in the kitchen Momo was lost for words &quot; WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?!&quot; she whispered to Lucy &quot; how should I know?&quot; Lucy replies<br />
Suddenly Sofias face goes blank, then into a state of horror &quot; oh god what have I done!&quot; She whispered &quot;what did you do?&quot; the two girls asked &quot;she had a transfer cord before correct?&quot; Said Sofia, Momo just nodded &quot;then I gave her the new model of the babysitter tech, but I think I took the wire out but left all the other cord components in&quot; she said her face blank<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok what does that mean&quot; said Lucy<br />
&quot; it means that those components may or may not have started to produce artificial hormones eventually turning our little mama bird into a ticking emotional time bomb!&quot; Whispered Sofia &quot; in other words-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mood swings&quot; Lucy and Momo said in shock.<br />
<br />
&quot;We still need to tell them about what happened&quot; said Momo &quot;Ok we will&quot; said Lucy &quot;but calmly and gently&quot; she added<br />
They all noded in agreement before making their way over to the lounge, Lucy sat in the recliner, and Momo in the armchair, but Sofia was making a brake for the stairs &quot;where are you going?&quot; Said Lucy, sending her a begging look as if to say &quot;PLEASE don&#39;t make us do this alone!&quot;<br />
Sofia just sent a sympathetic look &quot; iv got to go feed the kids they should be up by now&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok have fun&quot; said Lina waving Sofia off<br />
&quot;So what was it you guys want to talk about, you look like you&#39;ve got something on your mind&quot; she smiled before asking &quot;are your test results in yet?&quot;<br />
<br />
Both Momo and Lucy looked at each other &quot;no not yet, we won&#39;t get them for a while with Sofias wor pace&quot; Lucy giggled<br />
<br />
&quot;I can hear you!&quot; Shouted Sofia, causing the group to laugh, when the laughter stopped Viki Chirped in &quot; So spit it out what is it&quot;<br />
<br />
Momo sighed &quot;maby it will be easier to show you&quot; she said as she switched on the TV, and switching over to the news<br />
<br />
&quot;Braking news&quot; said the producer &quot; a local terrorist group known as the reborn agency has been found by police officials last night, the raid found 12 in production bombs in the buildings attic, there were 18 members of this group, 17 of which have been arrested and converted into dolls to be reintroduced to society&quot; Lina was lost for words, what was this news broadcaster on about &quot;bombs&quot;,&quot;terrorists&quot;, there was nothing like that here, before the broadcaster continued &quot; One of thies individuals is still at large and is reported having white hair, blue eyes and a tribal style design on the left side of a white custom model body mold, all citizens are asked to keep an eye out for this individual and report her whereabouts should they know her location, that&#39;s all for this morning, stay safe people&quot;.<br />
<br />
Lina didn&#39;t know what to do &quot;what was all of that about&quot; she said as a single tear fell down her cheek<br />
<br />
&quot; it&#39;s all lies&quot; growled Viki &quot; those twelve elegiac bombs were babies, and those 18 so called terrorists were part of the repopulate group&quot; Viki was trembling with rage, tears falling down her face as she tried and failed to wipe them away, her hands pressed firm to her stomach for comfort &quot;and now there all gone!&quot; She screamed &quot; they were my friends and now there mindless dolls!&quot; She Shouted before sobs wracked her body, Lucy came over and just held her as she cried.<br />
<br />
Lina had her own tears as she stared down at her stomach, was this how she would end up?<br />
<br />
When suddenly a bang could be herd on the metal shutters, panick gripped Linas heart, were they next, were they here to take her new friends and her babies, but then the hologram gave way and a white haired and ice white bodied woman with black tribal patterns collapsed through and onto the floor, her breathing ragid and uneven from running<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my god&quot; said Momo &quot;LUNA!, What happened to you!&quot;<br />
<br />
As Lina and the others walked and waddled over they saw, Lunas midsection modification was missing, and empty gap where her belly should have been, with tubes and wires exposed and sparking, cuts all over her body and two bullet holes in her left leg, her eye was black, bruised and stolen with a cut on her lip and across her right cheek, to put it plainly she looked like he&#39;ll<br />
&quot;Did someone say luna!?&quot; Said Sofia rushing down the stairs before her almost falling back in shock, she then composed herself &quot;momo help me get her into the workshop, NOW&quot;.<br />
<br />
As Momo and Sofia carried that broken girl into the workshop, all Lina could do was stare at the puddle of blood on the floor &quot;will she be ok&quot; she whispered, not looking away &quot; if......if anyone can save her it&#39;s Sofia&quot; said Viki, almost sounding like she was trying to convince herself.<br />
<br />
Lina then looked at Lucy &quot;What is all this&quot; she demanded, Lucy sighed &quot;it started as trying to save the human species many years ago, but now it&#39;s turned into a war to let humanity survive&quot;</p>
