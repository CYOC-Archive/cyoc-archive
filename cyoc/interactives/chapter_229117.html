<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Actually, why don&#39;t you decide?&quot; she looks up at you reassuringly.<br />
<br />
You think to yourself, contemplating how you want Ciara to change. <br />
You start by reverting her chest to its old size. “That way,  if I decide to make your breasts bigger later, you won’t still remember having them enlarged at all.” She nodded in agreement. <br />
<br />
Then you come up with an idea. You want to make her just like she is now, but think that she’s always been way less developed than she already is. You turn her awareness off and decide to start with her chest. You switch the light over to the palest pink you can manage, then point it at her chest. You watch as her chest melts away, her top morphing into a plain t-shirt and her bra changing into a training bra before finally disappearing. Her chest is now flat, and she believes she’s always been this way. <br />
<br />
Then you turn on the flashlight’s awareness switch, turn up the pink intensity, and point it back at her chest. You observe as her boobs slowly fill out. You watch closely until they stop filling in, not wanting to go too far. Her chest is now a healthy B-cup, the same size she’s always been, replete with a fitting bra, but she still thinks she’s spent her whole life flat as a boy. <br />
<br />
Ciara looks down in surprise and jubilation, her hands moving to cup them gently. “I can hardly believe this!” She exclaims. You smile at the adorable way she’s handling this. <br />
“I have boobs! Real boobs!” She starts jumping experimentally, and you can’t help but to watch them jiggle. You chuckle as she continues bouncing up and down for a few moments before stopping to sigh with happiness. “This is going to be so great,” she says dreamily.<br />
<br />
“Do you have any clue how often I was teased about not having boobs? And now...I do!” She’s still smiling as she looks at her chest again, almost reverently. You reach out and give one a squeeze yourself, eliciting a happy moan from Ciara.<br />
“They feel so good,” she says with a grin. “I finally feel like a real woman!” She leans over to you and gives you a kiss on the cheek before heading off towards her room. You follow after her, curious as to what she’s going to do next. <br />
<br />
As soon as you walk into her bedroom, you spot Ciara rifling through her dresser drawers for clothes that will emphasize her “new” figure better than what she has right now. She pulls out a tight-fitting t-shirt and slips it on over herself before turning to face you. Her smile gets even bigger as you notice how snugly it fits around her chest. With a sly grin, she winks at you. “What do you think?” She asks teasingly.<br />
You give an appreciative whistle that makes Ciara giggle happily before turning back to the dresser drawers for more clothes to try on. She quickly pulls out a low-cut V-neck blouse and slips it over her head, then turns around so you can see how well it accentuates her cleavage. “I have real cleavage now!” She exclaims with delight.<br />
“Yeah...you do,” You reply with a nod of approval before reaching out to give one breast another squeeze through the fabric of her blouse. Ciara moans happily at your touch and leans into it slightly. Then a mischievous grin crosses her face. <br />
<br />
She reaches behind her to open the clasp to her bra. She does so awkwardly; having never needed a bra before, she wasn’t very used to it. Or at least, she didn’t remember being used to it. After a few moments of fumbling with the hooks, however, she successfully unclasps it and pulls it off her shoulders.<br />
“I don’t need this anymore,” she says with a proud grin as she holds up her discarded bra for emphasis. You look down beneath her cleavage to see her nipples poking through. She was clearly turned on by this whole situation, even though her boobs had always been this size.<br />
<br />
“You know what?” Ciara asks with a sly grin as she looks at you seductively. “I think it’s time we take advantage of these new toys.” With that said, she walks over and wraps her arms around your neck before pulling herself in for a deep kiss. <br />
As the two of you make out passionately, Ciara starts grinding against you. She moans into your mouth as she feels your erection growing beneath her. You feel her nipples pressing into your chest through the fabric of her blouse and can’t help but to reach down and give them a squeeze. <br />
Ciara gasps at your touch before pulling away from you slightly so that she could pull off her shirt completely, revealing her bare breasts for the first time since they had &quot;changed.&quot; You couldn’t help but stare in amusement as she cupped them gently with both hands and looked down admiringly.<br />
<br />
“I still can hardly believe it,” she says softly before looking up at you with a sultry smile. “I never thought I’d have real boobs like this, and now that I do…” she trailed off.<br />
You leaned in to give her a gentle kiss before whispering into her ear. “Now that you do...what?” You ask curiously as your hands started exploring the rest of her body. <br />
Ciara let out a soft moan at your touch before replying breathlessly, “I want to take full advantage of them.” <br />
<br />
She pulls away from you slightly and gives you a seductive look before slowly sinking down onto her knees in front of you. You watch as she undoes the button on your pants, pulls down the zipper, and starts pulling your pants down along with your boxers. Your erection springs free, standing at attention right in front of Ciara’s face. She looks up at you with a mischievous grin before leaning forward to take it between her boobs. <br />
<br />
You watch as she squeezes them together around your cock and starts moving back and forth along its length. They were a bit small for this, but you didn’t care. Ciara had never been interested in trying this before. You can feel yourself getting closer to orgasm with each passing moment until finally you let out a loud groan as your cum shoots all over her chest and face. She looks up at you with wide eyes, clearly surprised by what just happened but also looking incredibly turned on by it. <br />
“Wow,” she breathes softly before leaning forward to lick some of the cum off your cock. You watch in amusement as she does so before pulling her back up. <br />
<br />
Ciara looks down at her chest and notices all the cum that’s covering it. “I think I need a shower,” she says with a smile as she starts walking towards the bathroom. You follow after her, eager to join in on the fun.<br />
Once inside the shower, you both quickly undress before stepping underneath the warm water together. Ciara turns to face you and wraps her arms around your neck as she pulls herself in for another deep kiss. The two of you make out passionately as the water cascades down over your bodies, washing away all traces of cum from earlier. <br />
She moans as you lather her “new” boobs with soap. She rubs it in sensually, yet curiously, as though discovering every curve of her chest for the first time. <br />
<br />
You had made your girlfriend absolutely obsessed with her average chest. Nothing was even different physically. The only difference was that now, she wouldn’t take her chest for granted. And believing that her boyfriend had “blessed” her with this gift was just the cherry on top. Their relationship would never be the same again.</p>
