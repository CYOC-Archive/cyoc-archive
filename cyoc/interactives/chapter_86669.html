<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">His current foster family wasn&#39;t his first. The Child Protective Services send him to the care of numerous family, when they didn&#39;t send him back to an orphanage. (Never the same, of course.) As hard as it may be to believe, June and Mark Dubois weren&#39;t the worst family to take care of him. Sure, they viewed him as nothing more their slave. But at lest they didn&#39;t actually inflict physical ills to him, regardless of Mark&#39;s constant promises to do.<br />
<br />
So rather than using is powers to punish the Dubois, he willed them to actually care about him, to have accepted him as part of the family. (He also willed Dustin&#39;s body to be back to normal.) He then wished that, without forgetting the truth, he will also have all the memory corresponding to the new reality, and said memory to always be the first to come to his mind, specially when thinking about June, Mark and Dustin.<br />
<br />
As the new memory flooded his mind, he discovered an unexpected effect to changing his family: In this new reality, the Dubois adopted him wen he was 6, and were the only family he ever knew.<br />
<br />
He also discovered why they never got another child of their own. Ms. Dubois was pregnant with twins, some complication arose. Doctors were only able to save Dustin, and June lost all hope to give birth again. (Something the &quot;new&quot; June don&#39;t hide to Dustin and Ty.) Because of that, Dustin became rather protective of Ty. A bit to much, even. (Young Dustin often asked if he will have a brother or a sister, only to see his mother starting to cry or hear his father say &quot;Sorry boy, but your mother can&#39;t have more kids.&quot; his voice full of saddens, when not both. So naturally, after Ty&#39;s arrival…)<br />
<br />
His brother was not the only one to overreact, to having Ty&#39;s around. June still wanted as much as ever to have a second kid some day or another, if not more. Because of her damaged uterus, she couldn&#39;t be it&#39;s birth mother, but to her that wasn&#39;t important anymore. When she finally was able to adopt Ty, she welcomed him by organizing a birthday-like party in his honor. Since then, the family celebrated this day every year, with a birthday cake featuring as many candles as years of Ty being one of them.<br />
<br />
When younger he didn&#39;t mind a first birthday cake almost two week before the actual one. (Neither did Dustin, since this party DIDN&#39;T include gifts.) But the past Ty of this reality, growing, started to ask the true meaning off this party, specially for his adoptive mother. He somehow got in his head that this party was a way for June to &#39;force her to be happy&#39;, to forget she can&#39;t have more children of her own, to forget he isn&#39;t her flesh and blood. That idea saddened him, fearing his mother might be on her way to a nervous breakdown. Paradoxically, his anxiety made him unbearable, particularly to June.<br />
<br />
Said mother believed that Ty, being an orphan, started to wonder about his birth parents. The possibility he might reject her, somehow choosing his true parents hover Mark and her, frightened June. But she knew preventing Ty from searching were he come from can only help said rejection to happen. So she choose to do the opposite: She secretly searched everything she could about Ty&#39;s birth parents.<br />
<br />
This secrecy led Ty to believe she was now on the verge of breaking down. That is, until the day of the party.<br />
<br />
Ty&#39;s fool mood prevented anyone to enjoy the party. Hoping to cheer him up, Dustin and Mark choose to bring the cake sooner. Alas, that only made Ty explode, yelling his false assumption about June before stomping to his room.<br />
<br />
Later, his mother knocked on his door. When he didn&#39;t respond she quietly entered. She looked a Ty, sadly. &quot;Do you really think what you said?&quot; When he didn&#39;t respond, she added &quot;You&#39;re wrong, you know. The original party, the one on your first day with us, was only to make you feel welcomed. But with how much happier we all were with you around, we felt obligated to celebrate it. Dustin always wanted to have a sibling, it was like part of him knew he should have one. But his constant asking for one always made me cry, depressing him.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;With you around he was full of life and joy again, like any boy should! Moreover, Dustin honestly can&#39;t hope of a better sibling than you, and he know it.&quot; She pursued, winking.<br />
<br />
&quot;He even know it a bit too well.&quot; Half joked Ty, a timid smile appearing on his face. &quot;So, why were you so jumpy around me latterly, mom?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Because of that&quot; She said, giving him an USB-stick &quot;It contain everything I was able to find about your true parents.&quot;<br />
<br />
For an instant, Ty was speechless. When he find his voice again, &quot;Mom…&quot; he finally said &quot;Dad and you ARE my true parents. The ones that have raised me, the ones that take care of me. Don&#39;t let ANYONE ever say you&#39;re NOT my true parents. That said, thanks for the stick. I DO want to know more about my birth parents.&quot;<br />
<br />
Around two weeks latter, on his actual birthday, Ty got new powers. If he want, he can wish the death of his birth parents never did happen, making him live with them. Or he can continue to live in the improved Dubois family. What should he do?</p>
