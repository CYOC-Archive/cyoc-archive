<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The curse looked around the bank in which Jessica Smith worked, finding that she did get along with most of the coworkers, it found the source of her problems in Cassandra Kaufmen, the branch manager of the bank she worked at.<br />
<br />
Cassandra Kaufmen was 54. And impossibly tall woman, standing at seven feet tall, she was imposing to begin with, her gaunt face and sharp features made her look much more serious by nature. And that was the way she liked it, she wore block heels that she had made specifically to give her a few more inches of height, and dressed in all grays at work, keeping her white streaked black hair in a tight bun, and wearing a pair of classic librarian glasses that made her look an &#39;all business and no pleasure&#39; style.<br />
Cassandra had however been blessed with an impressive bust, a natural set of FF cups, she bound them with a sports bra to make sure she wasn&#39;t taken any less seriously at work. She had been getting ready for work, just drying off from a shower when the curse blinked her out of existence, her home instantly emptying itself as if she never existed.<br />
<br />
Kyle cracked his head against the ceiling as he was shoved upwards, his back pressed against the eight foot height ceilings he looked down in astonishment as a tall, thin and busty woman&#39;s naked body was fused with his waist. He froze, he was always afraid of heights, and now he&#39;d have to get used to being high up from now on, he nervously lowered himself, gently moving her body as he lowered himself to sit on the floor, stretching out his new legs and leaning back on his new hands. Kyle stared at the elegant body he had been forced to ride forever, not scared or horrified but dumbstruck Kyle sat there not knowing what to do. He sat there, trying not to touch his new lower half out of respect for her, when the curse flooded his head with knowledge of his new reality.<br />
<br />
Kyle, now Kayla, had always been home schooled, but still had the same friends, and met them in the same way, everything was the same but her schooling and her body. Kayla sat dumbfounded, reaching down and gently touching her new bust, it occurred to her that her lower body had stopped developing, but not her upper, and there was always a chance of having a pair of breasts like these on her chest above, and getting even taller than....<br />
<br />
“Nine feet?” Kayla gasped, “I&#39;m... I”m nine feet tall. This... this is too much.” She slumped back and grabbed her lower hands, she didn&#39;t have much time to take in this information when a knock came at her door.<br />
<br />
“Kayla? Are you ready, we need to go shopping.” Her mother called.<br />
<br />
“I&#39;ll be there in a minute.” She responded.<br />
<br />
“Hurry up honey, we have a lot to do today.” <br />
<br />
Kayla got up, not wanting to disappoint her mother, she fought her acrophobia and got her lower half dressed, her style was the same, a sort of hipster punk, she was mindful of the ceiling being so close, and had to practically crouch as she went through the door, when she turned she realized that she wasn&#39;t in their apartment anymore. She stood up, the new ceilings were a lofty thirteen feet high, and they were in what looked to be a one story bungalow, she walked out into the living room, noticing she could see over every book shelf, and how clean they actually were.<br />
<br />
“My handy work I guess.” She thought, she rounded the corner to the kitchen, the layout of the house much the same as the apartment, where she found her mom, same as ever, but now much shorter than her. “So much for your little man jokes.” She thought to herself.<br />
<br />
“There&#39;s my giraffe.” She said.<br />
<br />
“Damn it.” Kayla internally groaned.<br />
<br />
“Come on, we need to get moving.” She went out the door and Kayla followed.<br />
<br />
Kayla didn&#39;t know what she was expecting for a car with her height, but it certainly was comfortable, she had to lay back in the SUV, but she was at least comfortable with this. It was a bit of a hassle getting in and out of it, but she could figure out how to do that more easily as time went on. At the store she got a few stares, which made her a little uncomfortable, but she instinctively responded with a big smile and a peace sign, which made the on lookers smile, and made her more comfortable as well. She found that her mother had her pick all of the goods from the top shelves, and even scout other aisles for out of stock merchandise so they didn&#39;t waste time there. <br />
<br />
After shopping they went about doing some errands, paying bills and doing small favors for people which took advantage of Kayla&#39;s astounding height, which made her feel somewhat used, but everyone she met greeted her like a good friend, and she found herself enjoying this more and more. The last stop of the day was of all places, Jennifer&#39;s house.<br />
<br />
“Why here?” Kayla grumbled internally, not wanting to see that bitch this soon. <br />
<br />
“Okay, you know the drill, we clean the gutters and to a check on the shingles here, I&#39;ll be on the porch with Mrs. Smith, maybe you&#39;ll get to talk to Jenny while you&#39;re here, you haven&#39;t seen her in a while.”<br />
<br />
Kayla seethed, she wanted nothing to do with her after this curse forced her into this life, she wasn&#39;t even used to this body yet. Kayla and her mother arrived and Kayla got to work, wanting nothing more than to get out of there quickly, she was just about done when she heard the familiar and unwanted voice.<br />
<br />
“Kyle? Or is it... Kayla?” Jen said.</p>
