<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Hmm, that could work.&quot; She thought. &quot;Now... should I, like, make her not his type with a race mixup? Or, maybe I could just make her not a student? Hmm, options options.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen wondered for a few more moments, then decided exactly what she wanted to try. She selected a word, then altered it, unaware of whether or not she may have just altered Brett instead, or possibly the entire location. <br />
<br />
She quickly changed &quot;working&quot; into &quot;splurging&quot; then looked up to see if the change was to her liking. Once more the world immediately changed around her, not only unknowingly changing her and those around her, but that entire are of the mall as well.<br />
<br />
Jennifer felt extremely disoriented. What had she just done? After glancing at the app, it gave her now further information on what had just occurred. She was aware that a change was made, but for the life of her could not recall what had been altered. She glanced around the food court. Everything seemed to be in place? <br />
<br />
Jennifer looked ahead to where she had been facing, only to see an obese redheaded woman, probably around 40 clearly splurging on a great amount of food as she shoved it down her throat. She was with an equally fat little ginger girl, no older than 16 also gorging herself on food. <br />
&quot;Mama, can I have that slice?&quot; She asked, half of her mouth still filled with food.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure thing Brittany, have at it.&quot; She said, handing her daughter a sloppy pizza slice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ugh, perhaps that is what I was doing.&quot; Jennifer thought to herself. &quot;I&#39;ll just help those poor people out quick, then I  have to get back to work.&quot;<br />
<br />
She selected the  mother, reasoning that changing her would help her daughter out. After a few sentences that would have led nowhere, she finally found one vague enough to work.<br />
&quot;This fat mother is eating.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Bingo.&quot; Jennifer smiled. She quickly altered &quot;fat&quot; changing it to &quot;fit&quot; and with a single word, she smiled at her success.<br />
<br />
At the table now sat a fit woman. She had a pixie cut of curly red hair, with moderate makeup and only earrings for any jewelry. She wore a gray tracksuit with something pink on underneath barely shining through her large breasts. Her body was toned, with tight calves, some muscle on her arm and a defined stomach abs.<br />
<br />
Her daughter had also drastically changed. She was healthier, seemingly very skinny with only a bit of meat on her bones. She had curly red hair down to her shoulders, had no makeup on but big hoop earrings. She wore a sweater that hung off on shoulder, and a tank top underneath with dark skinny jeans. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh shoot look at the time.&quot; The mother sighed. &quot;Britt, finish your salad we have to get home so we can change for yoga.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Sure thing momma.&quot; The girl smiled, slowly nibbling the last of her lettuce. <br />
<br />
Jennifer smiled, but it quickly faded to a confused grin, then into a frown. She fixed those two, clearly for the better.... so why did she still feel as if something was wrong? Not just some thing... many things. <br />
<br />
Jennifer looked around the food court, trying to spot anything amuck. There were several patrons of various backgrounds eating food at different tables. Regular, everyday people walked by just beyond the court&#39;s small walls. On the curved far side of the court were the restaurants, 5 in total. <br />
&quot;Everything at least looks fine, so why-&quot; She began before being interrupted by her watch.<br />
<br />
BEEP BEEP BEEP<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh Hell, waisted my lunch break on this damned app.&quot; Jennifer sighed. &quot;Oh well, the court isn&#39;t going to manage itself.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jennifer walked back to her table, took a final bite out of her sandwich then through back on her tight vest which never fully wrapped around her large breasts. Jennifer was never the brightest student in the world, but thanks to some help from her family she managed to focus in the last years of college and really improve herself. Now, she manages the food court restaurants and tries her best to keep a tight grasp on the various workers.<br />
&quot;Eh, it&#39;s not the best life, but it beats giving up school to become a prostitute or a janitor.&quot; She always thought to herself.<br />
<br />
She grasped her clipboard, and was about to put away her phone when an idea struck her. Clearly, something was off. Maybe it was because of how she was using it or maybe it was broken, but regardless, she had to try and use it again. She had a real chance to make her life so much easier, and if this test run worked then maybe she could slowly work on improving her own life directly later.<br />
<br />
She placed the phone on her clipboard, hidden from view, and the surveyed the restaurants once more.<br />
<br />
First, there was the pizza place. It was run by the cashier, a shy teenager named Nancy. She&#39;s a nerdy brunette who can talk to customers fine, but always seems to mess up with her two other college aged workers. Paul and Randy, both Grade A assholes who are responsible for cooking, but always seem to either goof off or screw up. Jennifer tries to mediate, but she can never quite catch them in an act bad enough to fire them outright. <br />
<br />
Next there was the McDonalds. The cashier was a boy named Ron, ironically, who was rather slick and irritating. He sometimes put off customers, but worst of all had an issue with his fryer Betty. Betty always kept to herself, but was sometimes bothered by Ron&#39;s womanizing or racism towards her Vietnamese heritage. Of course, sadly, none of this was proven or Jennifer would have kicked him ages ago. In the back was another cook, Jake, who was a nice guy all around but a bystander who just never socialized with anyone.<br />
<br />
In the middle was the Mexican place. In front was the whitest kid you&#39;ve ever seen named Ian. He was a ginger mess who always fumbled orders. Nice enough, but not reliable. In the back, however, was Derrick and his brother Joe, two Italian jocks who did a decent job, though managed to use their adult status to weasel their way into trouble over teenaged Ian. <br />
<br />
To the side of there was the Chinese place. It was run by a family, the Hans, and at the head was Mr. Han. His three adult daughters, Wendy, Dani, and Rachael did the work, but he hung around to ensure &quot;his&quot; business was running smoothly. He always talked behind Jennifer&#39;s back in Mandarin, and made sure his three daughters relied on him only. They were problematic themselves, but way better than Lin Han.<br />
<br />
Finally there was the ice cream parlor. Running this was a sweet black girl named Hannah. She was very respectful and a hard worker, but never had reliable help as many teens came and went helping her there. The newest helper, Greg, never showed up on time, and Hannah was sure he would quit soon too. This was also where the most obnoxious teens liked to hang out, which sometimes bothered customers.<br />
<br />
<br />
Jennifer always vowed that if she ever got more power she would do a real cleaning session on this place, and now she DID have power. She could alter people with just the change of a single word, and really help this place soar in efficiency and overall customer enjoyment. Now, the question was, which store would she visit first?</p>
