<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Calling Jeff flabbergasted would be an understatement, so would shocked or scared. A seemingly real creature just materialized out of his computer and jumped on him...<br />
<br />
Purring up a storm the seemingly overjoyed cat began making biscuits on his lap, lovingly clawing through his shorts at the important bits in his lap, It took him a second to respond but he did. &quot;Ow, my manhood, I&#39;m planning on needing that when I&#39;m older.&quot; Jeff exclaimed jumping and instinctively grabbing at the creature.<br />
<br />
Evading his grab, Fifi, bounced down then gracefully bounded up onto his bed purring and continuing to make biscuits. Jeff wasn&#39;t sure if this was some avatar of the Chronivac program, or maybe he was missing some sort of hardware or software requirement that made things go erratic, but Fifi wasn&#39;t presenting itself as a threat in any obvious manner. &quot;Okay fine, you can stay on my bed, just don&#39;t ruin my comforter, and don&#39;t make noise, I&#39;m not allowed to have pets and don&#39;t want you to raise the alarm.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff went back to the computer and sure enough, the chronivac program hit an error when he tried to open it claiming it couldn&#39;t find realityUpdater.cfg and a reinstall was recommended. Jeff restarted the install program and found the cat had moved onto his nightstand and doing the butt wiggle, preparing to launch onto his over bed shelving. &quot;No! it can&#39;t hold...&quot;<br />
<br />
Too late, the small screws were ripped from the drywall in an instant and things were crashing down... The cat harmlessly bounced off the bed and gracefully landed on the tiny desk that served as Jeff&#39;s study area, scattering everything that was there...<br />
<br />
Jeff stared in disbelief as his room was suddenly substantially destroyed in an instant. &quot;Oh no,&quot; he muttered. &quot;I&#39;m no handyman and dad&#39;s gonna kill me.&quot; His gaze fell to the cat with disdain. Fifi was licking its paw in disinterest. &quot;I bet you&#39;re pretty proud of yourself destroying my shelves, bed, and upsetting my desk.&quot; Jeff didn&#39;t actually hold it against the animal, it didn&#39;t know any better, but he was very angry at the situation and had to at least vent...<br />
<br />
The cat stopped licking itself and stared past Jeff, seeming to answer a higher power. &quot;Bbbrrrooooww.....&quot; it&#39;s meow mutated into an awful annoying melody jingle, similar to the noise the animated cat made on the computer but it cut through Jeff&#39;s skull and he felt it resonate throughout his being.<br />
<br />
Jeff watched in confusion as his bed, comforter, alarm clock, desk, destroyed shelving unit, and even his clothes, blipped through phases becoming low detail pixelated renders of their concepts, blurred completely, and then returned to high detail versions... but different.<br />
<br />
His shelves were reattached to the wall, but were now oversized cubbies looming forebodingly over the bed instead of the small light modern white plank it had been. His bed was a queen, not a twin (and frankly didn&#39;t fit), his desk was replaced with a glass top desk that had no attached shelving and everything that was inside the original unit abruptly fell to the floor. His plain blue comforter was replaced with a queen sized floral design. His digital alarm clock was replaced with an analog brass one.<br />
<br />
As the reality warping sound stopped Jeff looked in disbelief as his personal space was mutilated, the shelf was &quot;fixed&quot; but the space was completely dysfunctional. The cat, seemingly satisfied with its chaos, jumped off the desk and strolled out the door... Jeff tried to follow but had to struggle with the oversized bed and cramped quarters.<br />
<br />
Finally getting out of his own room Jeff checked the rooms he passed, having lost sight of the creature. When he flipped the light on in the bathroom; he checked the shower he was in for a shock as he saw his reflection in the mirror.<br />
<br />
He was wearing a toolbelt full of tools... that&#39;s what caught his eye first. His shorts were replaced with heavy rugged work jeans, instead of a graphic t-shirt he was wearing a tight white wifebeater with a thin, dark-tan, unbuttoned overshirt that had &quot;Handyman Services&quot; over his breast pocket. His feet now sported steel toed work boots with heavy socks. <br />
<br />
What&#39;s more, his build was lean and muscular. He now had pecs that showed through the shirt, and tightening his stomach made his abs pop. He looked like a generic handyman cosplay. Unexpectedly, his pants were showing his bulge but he wasn&#39;t hard.<br />
<br />
After a few moments of exploring this new form, Jeff started to piece together that everything that changed was stuff he mentioned. His manhood when he was jumped on, being a handyman when things fell, his bed, shelves, and desk... it was like the cat did an internet search and replaced items mentioned in conversation with something it found. &quot;It must be part of the Chronivac.&quot; he reasoned. (In truth, it is accessing assets and packages from the device.)<br />
<br />
His new form simply appeared to be a better version of his old one with a shitty generic outfit. The tools showed signs of use but weren&#39;t damaged, and seemed fully capable of getting a job done. He had a better build and bigger endowment, but didn&#39;t seem to be any older. His face was the same, his voice hadn&#39;t changed, he was the same overall height, and his body hair and facial hair seemed unaffected. <br />
<br />
Jeff made his way to the kitchen trying to find the instiller of this chaos but Fifi was elusive, his father however was grabbing a cup of coffee. &quot;Hey dad there&#39;s a problem.&quot; Jeff raised his arms to give his dad a full view of his form and outfit. Mike looked Jeff, &quot;Yeah, what&#39;s that? Something wrong with your shirt buttons?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You don&#39;t see anything wrong with this picture?&quot; Jeff asked in disbelief, having not been able to access the Chronvac, he&#39;s unaware of the reality settings...<br />
&quot;I asked you to fix the light switch a week ago but its still busted.&quot;<br />
Exasperated, &quot;It&#39;s not busted, you bought a normal switch, not a dimmer switch. The one you got doesn&#39;t have a potentiometer, so there&#39;s nothing for me to fix.&quot; Jeff blinked confused how he even understood what he said, but he did... His dad just scoffed not liking the answer. Bewildered, Jeff added, &quot;Hey follow me...&quot; <br />
<br />
Jeff led his dad to his room. He isn&#39;t the most observant but should notice something changed. &quot;Does anything about my room seem out of place?&quot;<br />
&quot;Well yeah, you&#39;ve got a ton of shit on the floor. I thought we agreed you were going to store stuff in your closet.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff winced, he seemed to think everything was normal. He needed his Dad&#39;s help. He needed to explain. &quot;No, Dad, this is really important and going to sound crazy. I got a program and installed it then a cat appeared onscreen. Then it changed, became a real cat and jumped into my room. Next thing I knew, I had this porn star body, I know how to change a light switch, my room is all different, and my clothes became this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Young man! Did you say there is a cat in the house?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes, no, its not real, but its not not real? I...&quot;<br />
&quot;Your mother is allergic, for her health, keeping cats out of this house is our primary concern, why are we touring your disaster of a bedroom? Every minute it&#39;s in the house is hours of her suffering! Honestly Jeff!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Bbbrrroooowww&quot; an ominous melody cut through the house as reality reformed. Half the house&#39;s switches were now dimmable, whether they should be or not, allergy medication popped into existence on every table and counter top, the pens, pencils, erasers and miscellaneous drawer paraphernalia were replaced with literal piles of shit, Jeff&#39;s possessions along with dirty dishes littered every inch of the room, Jeff&#39;s shirt became buttonless, and Jeff looked in horror as his dad and himself appeared to be momentarily censored. The pixels quadrupled over iterative steps and eventually disappeared revealing...</p>
