<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Passive in her way of agreement Sybil knew it was her total silence that Professor Beeker wanted from her. The thought of being an ignorant pony mare and standing about as such lusting to be mated was not the kind of lifestyle she would prefer. Worse yet, if she was then allowed or forced to mate with Daniel, the thought of this made the accepting her fate become tollerable.<br />
<br />
Miss Jane stood by as Doctor Hornaday quickly filled a syringe with the new Arabian formula. A swab of Sybil's upper arm and in went the injection sealing her fate and a mouth the management considered a loose cannon.<br />
<br />
&quot;I congratulate you on accepting our offer, your coming experience should be an eye opener' to say the least. Being a woman with the experience in human relations and child birthing, this will without a doubt cause some disturbing adjustments.&quot; says the Doc his face beaming with pride and satisfaction.<br />
<br />
&quot;Doctor, in a few days my son Gerald will be forthcoming to reside here for a time. The good Professor has insured my complacient authorization of guiding Sybil into his broad minded scheme of things.  From this time forward I believe it would be in your interest and his that work begin immediately on transitioning Geraldine back to my Gerald, and soon!&quot; said Miss Jane to the Doctor.<br />
<br />
Sybil looked at Miss Jane and winked at her in a sly and slow fashion.<br />
<br />
Miss Jane took note of her action and sidestepped its meaning as right then was not the time or place to make either the Doctor or his boss suspicious.<br />
<br />
Taking Sybil by the hand Miss Jane took her out of Doc Honaday's office and to her private office for a talk.<br />
<br />
Soon, each lady was seated, Miss Jane at her desk and Sybil in a comfortable chair in front of the desk. <br />
<br />
&quot;I wish to give you my .................&quot; started Miss Jane.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, no please don't try to make this entire situation seem as if it is the best and proper thing for me to do, because it ain't! Let me recant the past and all that has happened. My college educated son was lured into thinking he was to earn an income or at best an endowment to continue his education. When in fact, he was coaxed into accepting the Dartmore project and made then from the sound morale youth he was, to a sex lusting sensualist of a stallion animal and pony to be used for breeding human qualities into your pony blood lines! <br />
<br />
His acceptence of becoming a pony and remaining as such on a permanent basis has caused my marrige to break up, and sending my dear husband into a mental institution. From there he was found by the first curator of this project, and then be at weak time in his life he was coaxed also into being an active part of the Exmoor Project.<br />
<br />
Now my husband stands at stud, his mind a blur of human thoughts and animal lusts. He knows niether me or his son as family, his one and only interest in life and continued living is to satisfy his male organ's sensual drives. <br />
<br />
Now we come to quint essential part of the present situation, me! <br />
<br />
I am as the good Professor calls me, &quot;A loose cannon&quot; and knowing his devious secrets and ways as proved by your own sone Gerald, he has forced me to accept his so called, offer. An offer of either hell or living deeper in hell is what shall be for me. <br />
<br />
To tell you the truth, I might have preferred to remain with my son and be his sexmate and mare. Yet the thought of doing it in total ignorance was the one thing, the crux to force me into accepting the proposed life as a stallion, human mind and memories intact, maybe?&quot; explains Sybil.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm assured the Professor will let you keep your mind alert and alive while becoming and living on as an Arabian horse and stallion. It is the change of gender which he makes his sport of you and me by that male attitude of him being supreme over the weaker sex.&quot; says Miss Jane, and sighing as she says it.<br />
<br />
&quot;To be quite frank now and telling you this in no way should or would stop me from going through with this scheme. I left with two different attorneys back in the states, each having a full letter explaining all about and all at fault in this devious scheme to make money out of those foolish or week enough to become a part of this experiment. In detail did I explain what occured, and since then have set rebuttal letters to the attorneys as additional insurance to bring them up to date. They will, upon not recieving any addtional letters make the contents of my information known to the authorities. Thus it would put an end to this entire line of damnation!&quot; explains Sybil as Miss Jane sits with mouth open in surprise.<br />
<br />
&quot;You do realize that the Professor and Doctor Hornaday will not stand idol and let you bring their empire crashing down to its ultimate ruin! They will lash out and destroy Daniel and the others making your claims seem as foolish lies. You too, as you will now become over the coming months as strong and desiring stallion would be at the Professor's mercy. The word mercy is something ole' Beaker just doesn't know the meaning of that word! If he kills you that would be showing his mercy. Yet I suspect he will make your stallion self a life of torture and pain for as long as he is under watchful eye of local government. But, one should note that he is even now working with the armed forces in making volunteers from there into spies which might never be discovered. Those he has transitioned into new species and helped to send them into the field of honor as spies, has doomed each of those young people to a life long state of bestial exsistence! It is with such knowledge that the higher level of government will no doubt step. Your letters will be deemed as pro-annarchy, those attorneys and their families, along with anyone else aware of this entire project will be as they say, become expendable! I am quite factual in speaking this as I know of the Professor's original plan and it is well thought out from any possible action of those involved.&quot; tells Miss Jane.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then I'm beaten before the game even starts!&quot; chides Sybil.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm afraid so, he even has plans for those like me that once this were to begin I and my family would become a part of his devious ways.&quot; says Miss Jane to Sybil.<br />
<br />
Sybil sits for a moment her eyes in a stare at Miss Jane. <br />
<br />
Coy in manner of speaking and demeanor Sybil asks, &quot;Pray tell what do you think the Professor would do to you and yours?&quot;<br />
<br />
Miss Jane leans back in her chair and gives a sigh.<br />
<br />
&quot;Lions, he likes for me and mine to be as creatures which feed even on their young.&quot; she says showing her disdain for the thought.<br />
<br />
&quot;Enough of this, I suggest you write your lawyers soon as the Arabian process comes on quickly and use of the hands will be first to be changed. As with others the soft tissue changes first but for some unknown reason the new formula effects the toes and fingers at the same time.&quot; Miss Jane explains.      <br />
<br />
The two ladies get up and Miss Jane escorts Sybil to the door. Niether say anymore a word about the coming times, enough has been said to alert Sybil as to her lone state there in Dartmoor, England.</p>
