<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;We need to move now&quot; whispered Lina in fear, all the women in the room stayed rooted to where they stood, all frozen with that same fear<br />
<br />
&quot;NOW!&quot; Lina Shouted, causing all of them to jump, Lina rushed over to grab Echo, clutching her baby girl close to her chest, Lucy, shot up the stairs to get Momo and Misty, while Violet bolted towards the parts room with cat like ability despite her gravid swell, Catherine Close on her tail.<br />
<br />
Then Lina herd them, the sound of choppers circling the building like vultures, and the cry of police sirens growing near<br />
<br />
&quot;LUCY, MOMO GET YOUR ASSES IN GEAR NOW!&quot; Shouted Lina with ferocity that even scared herself, not moments later Momo came waddling down the stairs as fast as she could, Lucy close behind clutching Misty close &quot;move now!&quot; Shouted Lucy as the sound of tires screeching to a halt could be herd from outside<br />
<br />
&quot;Shit they must have followed me here&quot; said Lucy before looking at Momo &quot;I&#39;m so sorry&quot; she said as tears threatened to overflow, Momo cupped her cheeks giving her a smile as Lina entered the room &quot;well what&#39;s happened has happened, no changing it now&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
&quot;You guys get down here now&quot; came Sofias voice from a nearby speaker as the table rose up revealing an evaluator underneath &quot; everyone in&quot; said momo before plugging her transfer cord into Lina, disconnecting her midsection and pushed her into the elevator with the others, shutting the metal shutters across<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you doing!&quot; Said Lucy, Momo just smiled and placed her hand on the door as an explosion ringed out from the front door &quot;buying you all some time&quot; said Momo before turning to Lina, <br />
<br />
Linas midsection had once again swelled out, Luna now nestled inside, then Momos cord disconnected and fell to the floor with her ripped out parts &quot;you take good care of my girl ok?&quot; Said Momo, tears falling down her face, then looked up to stare Lina in the eye as her midsection sparked, blood dripping to the floor &quot;you will take my place, lead them, keep them safe&quot; said Momo before pressing a button and the elevator began to decend, another explosion ringing out Then Momo looked down with a smile &quot; tell my sister I love her, and I&#39;m sorry&quot; she said, as she disappeared from view, the elevator then began decending towards the old railroad.<br />
<br />
No one spoke as they went lower, a fog of grief and sorrow hung in the air, only Linas and Lucy&#39;s sobs could be herd, both of them holding eachother for support, Violet reached out her paw placing it on Linas head, Lina looked up to see Violet had tears in her eyes, but she was still trying to comfort her, Lina just put her hand on her paw, just holding it as she hugged Lucy, then Echo let out a small wail, and Linas attention was focused on her daughter, immediately clutching her close to calm her, plus holding her baby gave Lina some peace, knowing she was safe, but still it didn&#39;t make her pain go away.<br />
<br />
Misty was no better, sniffling into Catherine&#39;s sholder crying for Momo, Catherine was doing her best to calm her down, but to no avail<br />
<br />
Then the room opened up into a large red brick tunnel, the ground covered in old railroad tracks, but what was on the tracks was unlike the old look of the room, the train was silver and black, seven cars in total, two of which looked to be still in construction, each car had six disks facing at an angle to the floor, causing the train to be suspended in mid air, all the cars were different, some looked more practical than aesthetic, one car that caught Linas eye had a half glass cylinder on the top, with greenery filling it to the brim, must be a greenhouse of sorts.<br />
<br />
Then Lina saw Sofia, giving out orders to the other young women that Catherine and Violet had brought back with them, and Linas grief came flooding back, she had to tell her, then she felt Lucy rub her back &quot;il tell her, don&#39;t worry&quot; she said as the elevator reached the bottom they saw Viki sat on a bench, waiting for them, that&#39;s when Linas mid stood still, &quot;the babies on the second floor!&quot; She said looking around<br />
<br />
&quot;There already here, in the nursery car&quot; said Viki with a smile before her eyes fell upon Linas belly, tears began building in her eyes as she covered her mouth, this caused Lina to feel sad, her lover would be reminded of her friend everytime she looked at her.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry Vivi, I understand if you can&#39;t stand me right now&quot; said Lina as she hung her head, then she felt a belly pressing against hers, and arms wrapped tightly around her &quot;your so dumb, you know?, I said I want to have a family with you two and that&#39;s what I still want&quot; said Viki as she cried &quot;I just wish that she was here to see&quot; she whispered<br />
<br />
Then the sound of screaming and crying could be herd from the head of the train, then turning to look behind her, Lina saw that Lucy was gone &quot;she must have told her&quot; said Lina sadly, then there was a loud bang, and dust and debri came crashing down next to Lina and Viki crushing the elevator beneath.<br />
<br />
&quot;The topside building must have just caved in&quot; said Lina, before Sofias voice came over the speakers in the train, her voice sounded rough and dead &quot;everyone on bord now, were getting out of this god forsaken place&quot;<br />
<br />
Lina and Viki were climbing abord as the last of the women and supplies were put on board, then the large metal shutters at the far end of the tunnel let out a large metalic clang, like something had just rammed against it, not long after Lina saw blue mist starting to creep out from underneath, gathering into the form of a woman &quot;no way!&quot; Said Lina as she looked down at Echo, her breathing had become more rapid, almost in fear, then she let our a cry, tears filling her jade eyes.<br />
<br />
The blue mist woman&#39;s head snapped towards Echos crys, a evil grin spreading across her face as tendrils of smoke jumped towards the train &quot;What the-&quot; said Viki before her face turned to fear &quot;the nursery car!&quot; She screamed as the blue tendrils grabbed at the car, trying to rip it from the back of the train, then the train whirled to life, blue lights appearing over the blue disks as it began to move forward.<br />
<br />
Echos eyes shot wide as a pillar of green mist spread from her hand, her original form from the mirror forming infront of Lina, her translucent hands outstretched infront of her as she spoke in a tongue Lina had never herd of, as green mist pooled at her feet, snakes shooting out, striking and hissing at the blue mists tendrals, looking down the train she could see some of the young women holding makeshift weapons, attempting to beat off the grip of the mist, but there weapons passed right through them, that is until a few of Echos snakes struck at them, prying them off the back of the train.<br />
<br />
As soon as the train was free it shot forward, Echos mist form seeping back into her, Echos voice weak on Linas mind began to speak &quot;I&#39;m tired mama, so.....tired&quot; Lina smiled and kissed her baby girls forehead &quot;sleep now baby, you were such a brave girl&quot;<br />
<br />
Echo smiled as her jade eyes closed, then a light snore emitted from her &quot;out like a light&quot; came Sofias voice, Lina turned to talk to her, but Sofia held out her hand, stopping her<br />
<br />
&quot;I won&#39;t ask that you tell us what that all was, but I will ask you to come to the front of the train and give your orders&quot; she said with a small smile before adding &quot;make my sisters sacrifice with it&quot;<br />
&quot;I will, you have my word&quot; said Lina determinedly as she walked towards the bridge.<br />
<br />
&quot;We need to get topside&quot; said Viki at the bridge, Lina was amazed, there was a round polished wood table infront of her, large windows either side with curved black half arches either side, behind the table was two smoth curved ramps with a white console in the middle, a yellow coloured holographic map floating above, then there was a lounge of sorts, with white sofas and armchairs, and finally the command area, with sleak smoth shaped wodden consoles and desks running across with a one hundred and eighty degree curved windshield infront of them, showing the dark tunnel and tracks ahead as they moved<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t get your panties in a twist big mama, iv got you covered&quot; said Sofia as she waddled over to the command console, and pulled down one of the leavers.<br />
<br />
Up ahead the roof came down and let in a beam of light &quot;it&#39;s a ramp!&quot; Said Catherine from the lounge before Sofia Shouted into the intercom &quot;everyone brace!&quot; As the train tilted upwards and shot up the ramp, now airborne before leveling out, Lina looked out the front window and saw forrests and fields as far as the eye could see &quot;we shot straight over the city wall!&quot; Shouted Lucy triumphantly, everyone began cheering, before a red warning appeared on the console &quot;warning: heat lock on detected&quot; came the trains AI voice as Lina herd the rush of the mind getting sucked back behind the train, then before she knew why, she slammed her free hand into the comand cars wooden floor, her eyes turning jade green and snake like, clutching Echo close with her other hand, as a blanket of mist shrouded the train, before a mighty crash sounded from behind them.<br />
<br />
&quot;The city fired on us&quot; said Lina as she staggered back, sliding down the back wall, before taking a seat on the floor, still clutching Echo, while her other hand now slightly burned was now placed protectively over her swollen wombs<br />
<br />
&quot;Get us as far from here as possible&quot; she said to Sofia, then everything went dark.....</p>
