<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Alec didn&#39;t stop crying for 20 minutes. Durring which, Vivian had been holding her for almost the entire time. Both she and Andrea knew something very serious must have happened, and while even Andrea was having a hard time accepting it, it was almost certain that somehow Alec unlocked a new magical ability. What they didn&#39;t understand though was what possibly could it be that would cause even him to turn into a sobbing mess like this. He was so excited one minute and became this in the next. <br />
It was another 5 minutes before Vivian finally was able to calm Alec down. &quot;There there, its going to be ok. Whatever has made you like this, I am sure we can work through it. No matter what, I promise I will stay with you. I have no plans on going anywhere else unless it is with you. We are partners in this, okay?&quot; Andrea wanted to also say the same, but didn&#39;t want to ruin Vivian&#39;s momentum. Her effort was clearly working on Alec, as he slowly seemed to be calming down. <br />
<br />
Now that he was no longer sobbing into her shoulder, Vivian wiped away Alec&#39;s tears. In her head though, Vivian was struggling with a sudden thought. &quot;Did Alec always look this feminine? I mean, when did he is seriously become this cute? I know he hasn&#39;t had a dick for quite a whike now, and in all likelihood is slowly getting more and more feminine as time goes by, but this has to be a major jump in girl-ness. Even I am starting to doubt if he was even a man to begin with, even though I know first hand about his entire background&quot; she thought. However, she never would say that to his face when he was already this down about something. But it was becomming a serious struggle for her to not just start kissing him. While it is true that they have had what likely is the most intimate relationship out of everyone she knew, was she seriously this <br />
much in love with him? No, she couldn&#39;t be, they were friends for sure, and had both gotten off using her body, but did she seriously fall for him? She decided that this would need further investigation later on and returned her attention back to Alec.<br />
&quot;Thanks Vivian&quot; finally muttered Alec, however in a now unquestionably female voice. His voice was simply beautiful. Both Vivian and Andrea felt that they could even listen to this new voice rant for days on end and never come to hate its sound. It was both soothing and seductive at the same time, while also clear as a bell. However it was very, very feminine. Not even a tiny trace of masculinity could be felt in it. It was the epitome of a feminine voice.<br />
&quot;Hehe, d-don&#39;t mention it&quot; awkwardly replied Vivian, trying her best to keep herself from simply pouncing on Alec and fucking him. &quot;Can you tell us what happened to you? We can sort of guess already that you did manage to unlock a new magic for yourself, and that it likely has something to do with why your voice changed so drastically into that of a girls, but if you could share with us a bit more of the details, maybe we could help you out sonehow? But only if you feel like you can trust us. But keep in mind that this is your owwn personal secret skill, and are in no way obligated to share it with anyone, under any circumstance&quot; added Andrea.<br />
Alec nodded towards Andrea. She was right, it was her skill to do with what she pleased in terms of sharing its contents, but... she hadn&#39;t just gotten 1 skill. She had gained 3, and all of them were to a life altering degree. But Alec felt that she at least could trust these two girls, especially Vivian. Taking a deep breath, Alec began to explain. &quot;I did unlock new magic, but not just 1, but 3 of them. However I think they came within a set since they are all related to each other.&quot; <br />
That bombshell of a declaration was out of everyone&#39;s expectations. Unlocking a skill was rare enough, but to unlock an entire set? That was truely the rarest among the rare. &quot;Umm, which set was it?&quot; Asked Vivian. &quot;The succubus set&quot; quietly muttered Alec, just loud enough for the others to hear it. &quot;And because of it, I am now a woman, from now to forever, with no way to change back. Furthermore, these have become my real boobs, which size are now are directly proportional to the amount of magic I can use. And I don&#39;t know what my max size is, but even these boobs are only about 20% of my total mana.&quot; <br />
Vivian now picked up Alec and held her tightly from behind. &quot;Don&#39;t worry, I will stay with you forever and ever. Even if it is just myself, you, and your J-cups tits, I promise to never leave you&quot; declared Vivian. &quot;Oh my, was that a love confession&quot; teased Andrea. &quot;Vivian you sly girl.&quot; <br />
<br />
Vivian suddenly realized what she just said. She didn&#39;t mean for it to sound like that, but it unquestionably could be taken as a love confession. But it was not in her nature to back down from something she was serious about. &quot;S-so what if it was?&quot; Andrea&#39;s expression changed immediately. She was only teasing her a bit, and hadn&#39;t expected her to double down on it and make her intentions clear. &quot;Oh, uh, well. I will give you both some time then. If you&#39;ll excuse me. Alec we can discuss your succubus power tomorrow morning okay.&quot; And with that Andrea, gave them some space and left.<br />
&quot;Vivian I-, are you really sure about what you are saying? I can never be a man again. In fact, in all likelyhood, I may begin attracting both men and women. So there will surely be a lot of annoying people in the future if you do this you know. Plus I can&#39;t get my dick back now, and... this could be just an effect from my new skills after all&quot;<br />
&quot;I meant what I said. I want you in my life from now on. Whether as just my friend, my partner, or even as my wife, is up to you. Just promise me that we won&#39;t leave eachother.&quot; <br />
&quot;I promise I won&#39;t ever leave. And if that leads us somewhere then that is how it is. Becomming your wife is a bit much at the moment, though I can&#39;t speak for future me. But I am not that dense to still not get what you are saying after all of this, so here is my answer, can we just start as, um, I guess girlfriends now that I am a woman. That being said, I am new to the world of lesbianism, so... forgive me if I end up being a shitty girlfriend.&quot;<br />
&quot;I will if you can do the same for me. But Inthink it will be fine. We both know my body&#39;s ins and outs after all. Now we can explore your too.&quot;<br />
&quot;Will we also be including Andrea? Or will she just keep watching us from a far even though she said she would give us some space.&quot; Alec says loudly. &quot;Sorry, I couldn&#39;t help myself.&quot; Andrea says as she walks out from behind the nearby bushes. &quot;Its fine for now. I am satisfied with this development, for now.&quot; Says a smiling Vivian. She was not even slightly annoyed at Andrea&#39;s eavesdropping. &quot;Actually spill it. I am super interested in my girlfriend&#39;s new magic abilities!&quot; She continued, making sure to put a ton of emphasis on the word &quot;girlfriend&quot;. <br />
<br />
Alec found herself laughing at Vivian&#39;s sudden attemot at changing topics just so she could call her her girlfriend. &quot;Fine, I will share. Come over here too Andrea. I think you may know the most about this out of the 3 of us anyways. Alec explained her 3 skills to them, as best she could. Apparently, Succubi were not know if they were in this world or not. It was a possibility, but if they really did exist, it was just that hard to find them to know for sure. After she finished her explination, it was Andrea who spoke first. &quot;I can&#39;t believe you got something THAT powerful.&quot; If what she said was true, Andrea felt Alec would more than likely be able to easily put the entire world under her control once she maxed out her &quot;Succubus&#39;s love&quot; skill. &quot;You are so lucky Alec!&quot; Vivian excitedly shouted as she slipped both hands into Alec&#39;s too, fondling her boobs while Alec sat on her lap. &quot;I want magic titties too if it means I can get a rack like this. Not to mention all of the other benefits with them. +130 mana at lvl.1 is too insanely strong. And fucking gives you a permanent stat increase for every area is also just too good. We are so selling your bed roll next time we can. You and me are sharing one from now on. So prepare yourself. And I know a few good spots for getting quality dildos if you are interested.&quot; <br />
&quot;Oh yeah, thanks for reminding me Vivian. I have been meaning to check out their new stock lately but keep forgetting to do so. I hear they have some that vibrate now too.&quot; Even Andrea was interested in them? All of this talking about sharing a bed, and finding her a dildo, and about new kinds of dildos, made Alec&#39;s head spin. &quot;What, did you think most women weren&#39;t interested in this kind of stuff? I&#39;ll let you in on a little secret now that you are part of the team. ALL women adventurers have at least 1 dildo hidden in their posessions. Did you know that we can get so horny that our clits physically hurt sometimes? And unlike this one here, most women don&#39;t just fall asleep with it still inside of her. Did you know that some dildos are a magic tool too? Some can temporarily curse their user to lay a clutch of egg for each time she has orgasmed&quot; revealed Andrea. &quot;Er, not that I would happen to know how that felt or anything, but I, uh, hear it is quite enjoyable, to lay eggs that is.&quot; Both Alec and Vivian now turn to stare at a blushing Andrea, who couldn&#39;t stop herself from fidgeting. They both thought the exact same 2 things &quot;Andrea has definitely used that one before&quot; and &quot;now I kinda want to try it too&quot;.</p>
