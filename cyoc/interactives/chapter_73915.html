<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Wait! Over there!&quot; Brad pointed into the dark forest, mocking his <br />
girlfriend as the campfire cracked. &quot;I think I saw a ghost!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You think you're so funny mister,&quot; Keri punched him in the side as <br />
their friends laughed out loud at their antics. &quot;Maybe i'll be too <br />
scared when the lights go out.&quot; They all understood the threat she was <br />
making. Steve and Nina squeezed each other at the thought. Daniel <br />
tried to ignore the reminder that he was there alone and generally of <br />
no luck with women. <br />
<br />
Suddenly, a branch snapped loudly, and they all went silent, looking <br />
out into the darkness. Crunch. Crunch. Footsteps coming closer, until <br />
an old man became visible in the flickering firelight. &quot;Haven't seen <br />
many campers in these parts for a while.&quot; They were all silent, not <br />
sure how to respond to the eerie old man's approach. &quot;I don't mean to <br />
interrupt, but seeing as I can hear your hollering all the way up at <br />
my cabin,&quot; he made a broad gesture behind himself, &quot;I thought I might <br />
as well come down and listen in properly.&quot; <br />
<br />
The man stepped out of the woods and right up to the campfire, stoking <br />
it briefly with a sizable branch. &quot;So what brings you out into these <br />
woods?&quot; Brad raised his hands and started to answer, but the man cut <br />
him off as if he hadn't meant it as a question. &quot;College students? Out <br />
here to blow off some steam are ya?&quot; They all nodded.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, it's a good thing you made so much racket. If you hadn't, I <br />
couldn't have warned you about the danger.&quot; He took a shiny flask out <br />
of his pocket, took a drink, and handed it out towards Steve, who was <br />
nearest to him. When Steve shrugged it off, he put it back in his coat <br />
before sitting and settling in. The man looked old, but his movements <br />
were those of someone strong, not frail. <br />
<br />
Brad was getting impatient, and the old man cozy-ing up to the fire <br />
was more than he was willing to offer. &quot;We don't need your warnings <br />
old man. We'll keep it down. Go back to your cabin.&quot; The old man just <br />
stared deeply back at him, loudly snapping the branch he was carrying <br />
and tossing it into the fire. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I think you do need my warnings. Very much so. But I don't mean <br />
to stay. I'll be quick about them and then be on my way.&quot; The man <br />
turned away from Brad, catching the eyes of the others each in turn as <br />
he spoke. &quot;My story begins many many years ago. A simple wood-smith <br />
lived in these very woods. He was walking not more than a mile from <br />
this very spot, when he came across a shiny black stone.&quot; He looked <br />
back to Brad, his eyes piercing as he gave him one last chance to <br />
challenge. Brad was silent.<br />
<br />
&quot;However, the stone wasn't a simply black. As the man approached it, <br />
the sun sparkled against it, turning it a sparkling blue, purple, and <br />
green. The stone was radiant. He wanted to share it's beauty with <br />
others, but it was too big to move, and he'd likely not find it again <br />
easily. He stayed for a while, staring at and enjoying the stone. As <br />
he rose to leave, he wished he were a skilled artist, for then he <br />
could capture it's beauty and enjoy it whenever he wished.<br />
<br />
&quot;The next morning after eating his breakfast, he picked up a pencil <br />
and paper to make a grocery list. After completing the list, he looked <br />
down and realized he had sketched an amazing pencil sketch of the <br />
stone. He was shocked, having never been able to draw even a straight <br />
line. Even as he was amazed with his own drawing, he remembered more <br />
of the depth and beauty of the real stone and found his hand whipping <br />
across the paper, deepening and refining the sketch to match.<br />
<br />
&quot;Astonished, he looked into his yard, picking out a nearby tree. His <br />
flipped the page in a mad frenzy, and a few moments later he had <br />
sketched a perfect likeness. He was overjoyed. It was a dream come <br />
true, to have a talent like this. Somehow the stone had made him into <br />
an artist. In the following years he became a great painter, found a <br />
wife, and had three glorious children.&quot;<br />
<br />
Steve spoke up this time, &quot;this is your scary story? A stone that <br />
grants wishes?&quot; He laughed out loud, and the girls joined in.<br />
<br />
The man simply glared at him, then continued as if uninterrupted. <br />
&quot;Years later, his kinds had moved away, and his wife took ill. Taking <br />
care of her, he wasn't able to go far from their house for years. They <br />
were in their fifties, and his wife had given him such a happy life, <br />
such amazing children, he longed to help her. He decided to paint her <br />
something beautiful to raise her spirits. He remembered the stone he'd <br />
seen in his youth and ventured into the woods, bringing his easel, <br />
paints, and all, until he came upon it once more.<br />
<br />
&quot;It took him several house of work to finish his painting. When he <br />
finished, he looked at it with sadness. Any of you would have found it <br />
stunning, his strokes masterfully capturing the vibrant daylight <br />
sparkling off the stone in amazing detail. However, he was sad that it <br />
was no match for the true beauty of the stone. If only he were strong <br />
enough to carry the stone home, he could bring it to his wife so she <br />
could see it for herself. Alas, he was not, so he reached to pick up <br />
his painting. <br />
<br />
&quot;Immediately, the wood frame cracked, the canvas tearing. He was upset <br />
at having ruined the painting he spent hours working on. When he tried <br />
to pick it up from the ground, the wood splintered to bits in his <br />
fingers like it was sawdust. He was shocked, looking at the bits in <br />
his fingers. He reached towards a tree to steady himself, and before <br />
he knew it his fingers had dug into the bark. Pulling free, bits <br />
splintered out from the tree. Somehow the stone had made him <br />
incredibly strong!<br />
<br />
&quot;It dawned on him that with his new strength, he might take the whole <br />
stone home to his wife, sharing it's beauty with her. He reached <br />
around and picked it up with no more effort than lifting a sack of <br />
flour. He whistled and sang to himself as he carried it through the <br />
forest, excited to show it to his wife.&quot;<br />
<br />
Brad spoke up this time. &quot;So now the stone turned him into superman? <br />
This is quite the spooky story pops.&quot; They all laughed, and again, the <br />
man just glared at them briefly.<br />
<br />
&quot;When he arrived home, the artist set the stone down in his yard, and <br />
called for his wife to come out to him. She could barely walk, and <br />
hobbled out to him as best she could. Her face was as grim and sad as <br />
on any of her days since the illness, until she saw the stone. As soon <br />
as she did, she lit up, stunned by it's beauty. Flecks of green and <br />
purple sparkled and shimmered in the deep black. It was the most <br />
beautiful thing she'd ever seen. <br />
<br />
&quot;The stone reminded her of youth, of health. She thought how much she <br />
wished to be young and healthy again, and instantly, her body began to <br />
change. The gray in her hair disappeared. The brittleness left her <br />
bones. Her back straightened, righting her posture. The artist was <br />
astonished. In just a few minutes, she looked every bit as young and <br />
radiant as when they had met in their twenties. The woman felt <br />
wonderful, and looked down at herself, slowly beginning to understand <br />
what had happened. It was a miracle. She ran to her husband, both of <br />
them overwhelmed with the miracles they had seen that day.<br />
<br />
&quot;However, when she reached her arms around him, she felt a terrible <br />
pain in her back, and heard an awful sound, like dozens of sticks <br />
cracking at once. Her body slumped over and he immediately realized <br />
what had happened. In the excitement, he had forgotten about his <br />
amazing new strength, and had let himself crush her spine. In moments <br />
her eyes were lifeless and he was covered in blood. He fell to the <br />
ground weeping at the horrible mistake he had made. He wished and <br />
wished she could be well, hoping the stone could right his wrong, but <br />
she never moved, lifeless in his arms.&quot;<br />
<br />
The old man paused, visibly seeking out each of their eyes. <br />
Challenging them to interrupt now. They didn't. &quot;He buried her that <br />
day, right in the yard. Then he looked at the stone. It's sparkles no <br />
longer beautiful to him, instead glimmering like a taunting evil <br />
reminder of what had happened that day. He vowed for nobody ever to <br />
find the stone, and so he picked it up, and carried it off into the <br />
woods, never to be seen again.<br />
<br />
&quot;It is said, if you listen, even today you can hear the cracking <br />
branches as he carries it aimlessly through the forest. Occasionally, <br />
you might even hear a thump, as he sets it down for a moment of rest. <br />
If you are really close, you might hear the sound of his weeping, as <br />
he cries about the terrible day his wife died in his arms.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Boo!&quot; Steve shouted, pointing a flashlight up under his chin to make <br />
his face look scary. His silliness broke the somber tone of the man's <br />
story. They all laughed. <br />
<br />
&quot;You may laugh at my story, but be careful in these woods. Many <br />
strange things are rumored to happen here.&quot; Then as quickly as he <br />
came, the man stood up and wandered off.</p>
