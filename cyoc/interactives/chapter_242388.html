<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It had been a little over an hour since Nat called Tom. Under direct orders he and Alexa began making their way through the state park, Nat&#39;s words echoing in his mind.<br />
<br />
It&#39;s bad.<br />
<br />
Emptying out into a clearing, Tom immediately knew Nat wasn&#39;t kidding. The place was a slaughterhouse, bodies strewn across the forest floor. Already S.P.E.A.R agents were taking crime scene photos, collecting evidence, and placing in bodies in body bags to be autopsied.<br />
<br />
&quot;This your first murder scene?&quot; Alexa asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; Tom replied. &quot;But this is probably the worst.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah same,&quot; Alexa shuddered.<br />
<br />
Quickly scanning the area, Tom could see Nat directing agents. It appeared she was the one taking the lead on this case. As agents now left to perform her duties, Tom noticed her talking with a familiar figure.<br />
<br />
&quot;Miles?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Who&#39;s Miles?&quot; Alexa asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;An acquaintance,&quot; Tom responded. &quot;He&#39;s a demon hunter and if he&#39;s here then...&quot;<br />
<br />
Scanning the area, a small grin spread across his face. Nearby stood his cousins Aaron and Haley as well as the Moreland twins. Calling out to the group, Tom approached, part of him worried yet also relieved that his family members appeared unharmed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aaron! Haley!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Tom,&quot; Aaron said in surprise. &quot;Whoa what are you doing here?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My job,&quot; Tom stated. &quot;Ended up taking that job with S.P.E.A.R. Everyone okay here?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah just a bit shocked,&quot; Aaron replied. &quot;Wasn&#39;t expecting to find this on the job.&quot; Tom nodded, glancing behind his cousin as he noticed a pair of dhamphirs and a kitsune. &quot;Those three with you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Aaron blushed, motioning Nyx forward. &quot;Nyx, you remember my cousin Tom, right?&quot; Tom recalled meeting her at S.P.E.A.R befire and offered Nyx a warm smile. &quot;Nice to see you again Nyx, I wish it was under better circumstances.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah same,&quot; Nyx replied unsteadily.<br />
<br />
&quot;And you&#39;re her sister, right?&quot; Tom asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Andromeda Tepes, right on the nose.&quot; she replied, curtsying before Tom. &quot;Chase&#39;s girlfriend and this is Ikuro.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My boyfriend,&quot; Haley interrupted.<br />
<br />
Tom looked shocked, surprised to see Haley was dating yet also curious as to why the couples were lingering in the middle of nowhere. The sound of Alexa clearing her throat made Tom realize he should introduce his partner.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry,&quot; he said. &quot;You guys remember my partner, Agent Alexa Ross. Alexa, you remember my cousin and friends. The big one, Haley, is my other cousin.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alexa offered a small wave as Ikuro stepped forward, his brow furrowed as he studied the woman carefully.<br />
<br />
&quot;You are Nekomata correct?&quot; he asked, his three grey tails swishing back and forth.<br />
<br />
&quot;Um yeah,&quot; Alexa replied. &quot;How did you know?&quot;<br />
<br />
Ikuro was quiet, a frown forming on his face as he glared at Alexa. &quot;Nekomata raiders have terrorized the north for centuries. Killed many of the Shimizu over time. Where are you from?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ohio?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Where is this...Ohio, Nekomata?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Haley,&quot; Tom asked. &quot;Can you tell your boyfriend that Alexa is okay? Her family settled in the states back when the the Pilgrims landed. She doesn&#39;t have anything to do with any raids on the kitsune.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ikuro it&#39;s cool,&quot; Haley said. &quot;I know my cousin he wouldn&#39;t hangout with anyone like that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Perhaps that is what she tells them,&quot; Ikuro stated. &quot;I have dealt with far too many Nekomata raiders over the years. They are tricksters.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Look I get it,&quot; Alexa said, pushing her brunette hair behind her ears. &quot;Nekomata have a...reputation, but I&#39;m being serious when I say I&#39;m not like that. My family has lived in the states so long that we&#39;ve kinda lost touch with the culture. Closest thing I can say that&#39;s funny about me is probably an unhealthy obsession with rom coms.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ikuro raised an eyebrow, not understanding what a rom com was as he turned to Haley. &quot;She&#39;s cool,&quot; the tigress replied. &quot;I got a good feeling about her. You can trust her.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Very well,&quot; Ikuro stated. &quot;In the short time I have known Haley, she has an uncanny ability for knowing someone&#39;s character. But, I will be watching you Nekomata. Haley, you also must explain to me later what these rom coms are.&quot; Ikuro said as Haley gave her boyfriend a little chuckle and slap on the shoulder.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay then,&quot; Tom said slowly. &quot;So can anyone tell me what happened?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Best we can figure someone slaughtered a whole community of Dogmen,&quot; Charlotte shrugged. &quot;Whoever it was though is a real pro...and a real psychotic. I&#39;ve seen plenty of gory scenes, but this? This one was done with....just hatred.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Definitely,&quot; Aaron added. &quot;And they went through a lot of effort to not only wipe out the Dogmen but remove any territory markers. It&#39;s like they were trying to wipe this community off the map. S.P.E.A.R have any idea what&#39;s going on?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We think it might be connected to whoever this Seraphim character is,&quot; Tom stated. &quot;This isn&#39;t the first instance we&#39;ve come across.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There have been other attacks,&quot; Andromeda asked. &quot;Why hasn&#39;t anyone been told?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Because S.P.E.A.R isn&#39;t trying to cause a panic,&quot; Alexa said. &quot;Things have been unsettled recently. The kitsune civil war. Caleb&#39;s injuries. Even an attack by the Amberhills.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Was that the thing with Connor?&quot; Charlotte asked. &quot;Him and Caleb really didn&#39;t go into a lot of detail as to why he looked so banged up.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It is,&quot; Tom replied. &quot;And I&#39;m only telling you because Connor&#39;s your brother. The Amberhills are in custody now. We&#39;ve been taking the necessary measures to keep them confined as we interrogate them. Now remember Charlotte he is fine, but he....brought Henry Amberhill down mostly on his own with others assisting him in getting the rest of his pack in custody.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh god damn you big bro, why do you gotta be the hero.&quot; Charlotte said shaking her head. She knew her older brother was brave, but she didn&#39;t like to see him in any worse condition than he was already in. She already didn&#39;t want to know what their mother&#39;s reaction was to what Connor did.<br />
<br />
&quot;As Princess of the Tepes family I ask that S.P.E.A.R inform us of what is going on with this latest threat,&quot; Andromeda exclaimed, taking a confident step forward. &quot;If this Seraphim is a threat to my people, then we need to prepare ourselves accordingly.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tom gawked, turning to Alexa as she simply shrugged. &quot;Umm, I think that&#39;s probably above my pay grade,&quot; Tom replied meekly, rubbing the back of his neck.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then I wish to speak with your supervisor,&quot; Andromeda replied firmly.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll take Andromeda over to Nat,&quot; Alexa replied. &quot;You catch up with your cousins and ask them about what&#39;s going on.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tom nodded, watching as his partner now escorted Andromeda towards Nat and Miles. Turning back to the others, he noticed a smile now spread across the tigress face.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; he asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;She seems nice,&quot; Haley grinned. &quot;You two dating?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What? NO!&quot; Tom exclaimed. &quot;She&#39;s just my partner. Besides I&#39;m supposed to go on a date with a friend of hers. A troll girl named Cora.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah but I bet you&#39;d rather go on a date with Alexa,&quot; Haley mused. &quot;I mean it&#39;s been how long since Lynne dumped you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Who&#39;s Lynne?&quot; Nyx asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Our sister in-law,&quot; Aaron replied. &quot;Caleb&#39;s wife Gloria? Lynne is her kid sister.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You dated the sister of the owner of the Magic Shop?&quot; Ikuro said in awe. &quot;Even in the north the reputation of the Magic Shop is revered. I can understand why Haley mentioned you were so devastated when she left you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Can we please focus on something besides my love life,&quot; Tom groaned. &quot;What I need to know is what you saw when you got here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Pretty much this,&quot; Aaron shrugged. &quot;The entire community was slaughtered with one Dogman displayed like a warning.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Or a calling card,&quot; Chase added. &quot;Whoever did put them there to let us know they were the ones responsible. They went to great lengths to not only butcher them but, wipe any trace they were here off the map. Has anything else popped up with this Seraphim?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A couple of instances yeah,&quot; Tom replied. &quot;But you didn&#39;t here it from me. Most I can say is a good portion of the supernatural community is freaked out. S.P.E.A.R is trying it&#39;s best to find this person fast.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Have they thought of asking the hunters?&quot; Nyx asked. &quot;I know my family hasn&#39;t had the greatest relationship with them, but I&#39;m sure Aaron or Chase would be a huge help.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Things are a bit complicated when it comes to S.P.E.A.R and the church,&quot; Tom sighed. &quot;But, I know I would appreciate any information any of you come across. You need help just call.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll keep you in the loop if you do the same,&quot; Aaron replied, extending his fury paw forward to shake his hand. Tom smirked, shaking his cousin&#39;s hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sounds good to me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And if you want to go on a double date with me and Ikuro,&quot; Haley added. &quot;I promise to tell him to be nice to Alexa.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tom sighed, pinching the bridge of his nose. Sometimes his cousins could drive him crazy.<br />
<br />
***********************************<br />
<br />
As S.P.E.A.R processed the Dogmen crime scene, Connor Moreland now made an impromptu trip to the church of Archbishop Castignoli.<br />
<br />
Despite his injuries, Connor was still far more capable than Caleb at this point. Caleb was still recovering from injuries that would have killed most men. Connor&#39;s injuries, however, consisted of a sore hip and some numbness in his leg. He was in much better shape to make the trip than Caleb.<br />
<br />
Entering the church, Connor was immediately greeted by the Archbishop, a grim expression on the elderly priest&#39;s face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good to see you Connor,&quot; he said. &quot;Heard about your encounter with the Amberhills. Glad to see you in one piece.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you Archbishop,&quot; Connor stated. &quot;Didn&#39;t realize the church was aware of that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You can just call me Pete Connor,&quot; Pete smiled. &quot;And after so many years working on the periphery of the supernatural, I&#39;ve learned to keep my ear to the ground and my eyes open.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I understand Pete,&quot; Connor stated. &quot;Still, trying to wrap my head around why you felt this was so urgent though.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ll understand in a moment,&quot; Pete stated, beckoning Connor inside. Following the Archbishop, Connor gasped as his gaze rested on the front of the church. Tied to the cross was a vampire, the man&#39;s body steaming from being in contact with the holy symbol. Even from the back of the church, Connor could see the vampire was badly beaten, a sign hanging from around his neck.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dear god.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;God has nothing to do with this,&quot; Pete replied in a low voice. Slowly the pair approached, Connor able to finally read the message.<br />
<br />
&quot;Where is his god?&quot; he whispered in confusion. &quot;What kind of sick joke is this?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That Mr. Moreland is something we are trying to decipher.&quot;<br />
<br />
Connor turned, watching as a young man with dark hair and glasses emerge from the shadows. Studying the man carefully, Connor&#39;s eyes grew wide.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re a vampire!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dhamphir actually,&quot; he replied. &quot;Prince Brendan Tepes of the Tepes family. I believe you&#39;ve met my sisters.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait you&#39;re Nyx and Andromeda&#39;s brother,&quot; Connor exclaimed. &quot;Why are you here? Archbishop?!&quot;<br />
<br />
A small grin now formed on the elderly priests face as he slowly approached the young dhamphir.<br />
<br />
&quot;God works in mysterious ways Connor,&quot; Pete said. &quot;In this case though, I feel a confession is necessary. You see...I&#39;ve remained on speaking terms with S.P.E.A.R for quite some time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;After what happened,&quot; Pete began. &quot;I....like your brother held onto a lot of anger. As time passed though, I began to pray. God, told me that I needed to forgive. That S.P.E.A.R was penitent in their statements. They sought forgiveness and I forgave, thanks to of all people a vampire, named Hailey Meyers.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The new director of S.P.E.A.R,&quot; Connor finished. &quot;Okay, while I agree with that, I&#39;m still curious as to why a Tepes Prince is standing in the church with us.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I was just as curious as you Mr. Moreland,&quot; Brendan stated. &quot;However, Director Meyers&#39;s mother is in our employ and acted as a mediator in arranging this meeting. Both the Archbishop and Director Meyers assured me that you would be far more amicable than your older brother. No offense sir, but Caleb is not exactly looked upon fondly by my family.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I get that,&quot; Connor said softly. &quot;And judging by how you carry yourself, I&#39;m guessing you&#39;re the diplomat of the family?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You would be correct,&quot; Brendan stated. &quot;Although I must say, I&#39;m a bit uncomfortable meeting within the church. As you can imagine, my people and holy sights don&#39;t exactly mix well. Even if it has no biological affect on me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah feel the same way anytime I enter a vampires crypt,&quot; Connor said, a small smirk spreading across his face. &quot;Pleasure to make your acquaintance.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Likewise Mr. Moreland.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You can call me Connor,&quot; he said, taking a moment to glance at the vampire. &quot;Any idea who this is?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I do,&quot; Brendan said solemnly. &quot;A prominent merchant within our territory recently went missing. They often traded their wares in the human realm, mostly with S.P.E.A.R or items within the Magic Shop. Vampiric mysticism and potions turn a hefty profit. He was reported missing a week ago.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And how long has he been here?&quot; Connor asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I found him just before I called you,&quot; Pete said. &quot;As soon as I contacted you, I spoke with Director Meyers. She said she would send someone.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;P..prin..ce Bren...dan?&quot;<br />
<br />
All three men gasped. Up until this moment they believed the vampire dead. Now, they could see it raise its head slightly, his swollen eyes focused on the young dhamphir prince. Quickly Brendan raced to him, taking his hand in an attempt to comfort him.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m here,&quot; Brendan said softly. &quot;Who did this to you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ser...seraph...Seraphim.&quot;<br />
<br />
Brendan nodded, closely examining the vampire. The poor man&#39;s body was broken in numerous places. Even with a vampires ability to heal, Brendan was unsure if he would survive.<br />
<br />
&quot;Save your strength I&#39;ll get you down.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ki..kill...me...pl...please!&quot;<br />
<br />
Brendan&#39;s face fell, his eyes glossing over with tears as he stared at the broken, pleading man. Connor now approached the dhamphir prince from behind, gently placing a hand on Brendan&#39;s shoulder.<br />
<br />
&quot;He&#39;s not going to make it,&quot; Connor said softly. &quot;I&#39;m asking your permission. Let me put him out of his misery.&quot;<br />
<br />
Brendan paused, nodding before turning away and closing his eyes. Connor now removed a stake, piercing the vampires heart, mercifully ending his suffering. After a moment, Archbishop Castignoli finally spoke.<br />
<br />
&quot;This wasn&#39;t a random act of violence,&quot; he said stoically. &quot;There was purpose to this. This Seraphim is sending us a message. None of us will be safe until they are stopped.&quot;</p>
