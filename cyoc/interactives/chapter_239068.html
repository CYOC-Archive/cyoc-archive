<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jennifer was concerned. She had rolled a five earlier that day in her bedroom, something minuscule compared to that number. Part of her wanted to believe that Kyle&#39;s game was just a figment of her imagination and that her breasts were just exceptionally ripe that day. But she also felt compelled to worry, as if it were true, she may have just gotten something bad.<br />
Not a minute after rolling the die by accident, Jennifer felt her stomach tie into knots. It felt like she was having stomach cramps, but lower than usual. She nervously got up, clutching her stomach and made her way out. The teacher saw her and only nodded, understanding she needed to leave. Jen was thankful for the &quot;walk-out&quot; bathroom policy, which essentially gave her a free hall pass. She rushed down to the nearby single-person bathroom, empty and alone. She locked the door behind her as the pain reached a crescendo.<br />
She gasped as the feeling of skin moving caught her off guard. Like someone had put a dozen snakes inside her, it roiled and stretched. It was happening down below her belly, just above her snatch. She quickly pulled off the large shirt and stripped off her panties. She saw firsthand what was happening down there.<br />
A lump of skin was growing out of her pubic mound, not a quarter of an inch above her clitoris. The lump had two smaller lumps below it in a single pouch of skin. The larger mound was lengthening and getting a lot more solid, while the other two remained soft and oval-shaped. The skin on the longer object was wrinkled and falling back slightly, allowing other skin beneath to show. As the protrusion reached seven inches in length, Jennifer saw what it truly was.<br />
She had grown a penis. She was currently growing a penis and balls! She had seen them a lot in porn and other sources, but she now was seeing one up close. And on her body. It was sheer insanity that it was happening. She watched it throb slightly, pressing onward to a greater length, with its balls getting larger to match. Jennifer reached a hand down to feel it. It was hairless and smooth, like a baby&#39;s skin. And it was big, too. Though, from what she heard, the average size of a human male&#39;s penis was about five inches hard and 3-and-a-half soft. This one, however, had already exceeded eight inches and was still going. In fact, she watched as it went into 9, 10, 11 and 12 inches before stopping at thirteen inches in length while it was soft. Her newly formed girl-cock was now twice the size of a regular man&#39;s erection, and she wasn&#39;t even hard!<br />
&quot;Oh my god, oh my god. T-that&#39;s a dick. I have a penis!&quot; Jen gasped out. &quot;Oh, nooooo, what&#39;s that feeling?&quot; She moaned as the rod began to lengthen and get harder. She was getting her first erection, and at full mast, she may be able to see it up close. She felt it start to rise skyward, inching closer and closer toward her torso, then her chin. It went right between her breasts, titfucking them as it continued up. When it finally stopped, it was sticking out of her cleavage below her chin.<br />
&quot;Agh! It&#39;s right there. Jeez, this thing is *gasp* gigantic. How do men deal with these?&quot; Jen asked herself. She realized the answer was to jack it off like they usually would. But Jennifer hated that idea, especially with a cock that reaches her neck. She felt below for the matching balls and gasped when she felt their heft. They had to be as big as apples. They churned in her grasp, the skin moving in response to touch. She could not believe what had just transpired and was almost having a panic attack.<br />
&quot;Oh god, I can&#39;t walk out with this thing. I... Oh no, I need to relieve it. Fuck.&quot; She moved herself over to the toilet and plopped herself hard on the seat. Her balls swung down and hit the ceramic below, and almost made her cum. She moaned as her hands went to work on the pillar of meat. As she stroked it, she quickened the pace. It was a lot of meat to work with, and she was uncertain of the reaction she would have to it going off. She desperately needed to release it, but had no clue how when it was that big.<br />
Until she remembered where it was. She stopped stroking for a moment and looked down. The engorged purple head with its urethral slit sat right there beneath her chin, in range of her mouth. It was almost too big to fit, but she figured it would be the quickest way out. Grabbing the head of her massive girl-cock, she shoved it in her mouth. She gasped at the enormity of the organ. It was like trying to fit a can of Coke in her mouth! The head was rubbery and throbbing hard, filling her mouth. She groaned as her hands resumed their work. It didn&#39;t take long before the feeling of an orgasm encroached. &#39;Oh shit, oh shit,&#39; thought Jennifer, her mind swamped by lust and hormones.<br />
After only three minutes in the bathroom, Jennifer&#39;s cock erupts with semen as her mind blanks from orgasm. Her pussy clenches simultaneously, giving her a second and more mild orgasm. The semen from her cock travels down her throat, filling her stomach. There is a lot of it, and some leaks out of the corners of her mouth to the floor. She gasps for air as she draws it out of her mouth, the taste of cum filling her lungs.<br />
&quot;Oh my god, I just did that. What the fuck. I just came in my own mouth!&quot; Jennifer cried out. &quot;Fuck, why was it so good?&quot; She sat there, letting the erection die down. Finally, after three minutes, it returned to its original length of 13 inches. &quot;Jeez, I can&#39;t fricking deal with this! Kyle is a bastard for this. I... I gotta find him and get this fixed. But where is he hiding?&quot; She knew he lived somewhere within ten minutes of the school. He usually walked, too. She brought up Google Maps, curious to see how many houses were within walking distance of ten minutes.<br />
The answer was 70 houses. 70. She had no time to go door to door asking if some dirtbag kid lived there and could reverse her changes. Hell, she would only be able to do several anyways, as who knows how long her cock would stay down. Regardless, she had to get moving now.<br />
Gathering herself together, she grabbed her clothes from the sink. Her bra, still too tight, worked, as did the shirt. The panties she had managed to fit below her balls over her pussy, but not much further. The issue was her pants. They were made for a slim waist, and she lacked room for her anaconda cock to fit. Meaning she needed an alternate method of hiding it. A twinge of genius hit her. A lost and found bin was outside, right by the doorway. If she could grab the box, she could look for fitting clothes.<br />
Opening the door for a peek, Jen saw nobody coming down the hall either way. She reached out her hand and grabbed the cardboard moving box from the hallway, dragging it into the bathroom with her.<br />
She began tossing shirts, shoes, socks and shorts everywhere, finding two options for her use. An extremely baggy pair of jeans and a long plaid skirt. The jeans could hide the cock easily, despite the restraint on her other bits, while the skirt could keep her gonads less packed in and her legs able to move easier, except her erection would be way easier to spot.</p>
