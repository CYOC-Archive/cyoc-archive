<br />
&quot;To even things out,&quot; Kelly gave an almost predatory smile to me, which made me gulp.<br />
<br />
&quot;Even what out?&quot; I managed, trying to hide the fact that I was sporting a decent sized erection in my pants.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh... many things, like using that transformation trigger on me during the chase,&quot; Kelly gave a toothy smile, &quot;it was rather clever... and it has made me into something I&#39;ve fantasized about... but I could also say you were cheating with that.&quot;<br />
<br />
I only gulped as he looked at her teeth and how they glistened a bit in the lamplight of the part of the park they were in. It was something where I was fearful that she might do something that would end up in me being eaten. Without the ring I couldn&#39;t do anything to stop her if she wanted to. Particularly as she raised one hand and marveled at the ring on her finger. I didn&#39;t think it was cheating but arguing wouldn&#39;t work. She now had the ring, and to a degree, her powerful furry body with multiple breasts left me feeling rather horny too. Thus, I was hovering between two conflicting points, one to flee and the other wanting to try and seduce her.<br />
<br />
&quot;But I do look good... and I feel good,&quot; Kelly&#39;s smile remained, &quot;so I&#39;ll forgive you for that. But I will change some things so that things are more... real than just you. I mean, a werewolf should control his or her own transformation, not just in having their boyfriend say a word or phrase. I mean there&#39;s nothing like that in the stories I&#39;ve read.&quot;<br />
<br />
She then looked at the ring and continued to smile, &quot;and since this ring does work... I can do it. First, I wish that I, and any other werewolf can transform at will into big and beautiful... or handsome if they&#39;re guys... werewolves, capable of thinking and acting as they would normally if they wish, and that humanity has never had a problem with werewolves... ever.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nothing seemed to happen, though for the most part I didn&#39;t entirely expect something to visibly happen after that. It was essentially like my initial wish to turn her into a werewolf to act on the fantasy she&#39;d admitted having. She didn&#39;t wish for anything to happen, but merely to change the terms on what would apply to &quot;werewolves,&quot; which I figured would apply to only herself at the present time. The one thing that I was curious on was how her wish would affect things in the larger scale. For, I&#39;d found that the ring was powerful and could do a lot, which left me wondering on where its exact limits were. Would there be &quot;trickle down&quot; affects from certain wishes. As while she was presently the only werewolf, her wish had mentioned werewolves, as in plural. Would the ring then turn people that had fetishes like her own into werewolves as result of her word use?<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you really think that will work?&quot; I asked her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Everything else has worked with it so far,&quot; Kelly answered, &quot;I don&#39;t see why not... and now for evening things out... I wish that Joe was a ruggedly handsome and virile male werewolf, utterly devoted to his mate... me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s you&#39;re wish?&quot; I wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, it&#39;s my fantasy,&quot; Kelly stuck out her tongue for a moment, &quot;besides... it wouldn&#39;t be much of one if I were the only werewolf around, now, would it? I&#39;d want to be a sexy werewolf that can hunt deer and all that kind of stuff. But I&#39;d also want to be WITH a werewolf that would do that with me. Playing chase in the park is fun... but it&#39;s not the limit of what I&#39;d want to do.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And you&#39;d really want me?&quot; I asked, my voice sounding more hopeful than I&#39;d originally wanted to go for. <br />
<br />
It was almost as though I were looking at her as more than just a hot girl who had a werewolf fetish and was now a big and powerful one standing over me. It was like looking to a loving partner who meant more to me than her looks, almost like real love, which wasn&#39;t necessarily bad, in a way. As I did find her beautiful and while a part of me had wished to use the ring&#39;s power to let me see her naked, I did eventually decide that was too petty and wasn&#39;t right, which I figured could lead to a lasting relationship and a loving one if I played my cards right. But that was still a very early stage, and now it felt as though I was already deeply in love and loyal to her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah... I mean, you haven&#39;t been bad, and a lot of guys just seem to see me as the local hot chick,&quot; Kelly answered, &quot;and by the scent of that erection you&#39;re sporting... I&#39;d bet that a part of you was in agreement with those guys. But if they came across this ring... they would have turned me into some mindless slut without a braincell to her name. You told me about it... showed how it worked and actually gave me something I&#39;ve wanted. That&#39;s better than what so many others have tried. Thus... I want you as my mate... filling out my fantasies giving you a reward for being better than the college jocks.&quot;<br />
<br />
~~Kelly~~<br />
<br />
He gave a bit of a dopey grin that I thought was a bit cute. Of course, his face had shifted a bit since I&#39;d made my wish. He looked a lot like he did before, but it was more mature now with a stronger looking jaw and a straight nose. It as if the ring&#39;s power had altered him in a way that made him in his human form look even better. I&#39;d even seen his human musculature enlarge and become a bit more toned in a way, and from the aroused scent he was giving off, I was fairly certain his equipment was bigger now too. It was something that made him match the sort of personality that had been understanding and respectful, not like many of the jocks who figured I was just something to be hit on. In this, I&#39;d already liked him, and now with the ring... I&#39;d made him even better.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re too good for me,&quot; Joe said after a moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know... and I&#39;ve enjoyed the game of chase, but it&#39;s time for you to transform,&quot; I answered, &quot;to think about being in your werewolf form and taking on that form.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Anything for you,&quot; Joe answered.<br />
<br />
I only watched as he blinked and then began to change. When his eyes opened his irises had become a vibrant golden yellow that matched my present wolf eyes and he began to transform. His fingernails began to lengthen out into claws and his muscles began to bulge larger under his shirt and pants. That then further became obvious as I could see points where his toe claws were digging into the front of his shoes, and after a few moments, his sneakers gave way as his growing digitigrade feet tore through them. The popping of his zipper and pants button also indicated  the main clothes he was wearing were sure to follow them.<br />
<br />
&quot;You could have disrobed before transforming,&quot; I said to him with half a chuckle.<br />
<br />
&quot;I could have,&quot; Joe admitted, revealing now sharper teeth and as his ears migrated up onto the top of his head, &quot;but I figured you&#39;d want to see something more... exciting.&quot;<br />
<br />
He then gave a heavy grunt as the button on his jeans gave way and flew through the air before landing at my feet. It let his jeans fall open, and I could see that his jeans weren&#39;t the only thing being strained. His underwear was also fighting a losing battle against a massive erection that was growing larger in length and circumference as it rose up from underneath his waistband. Looking further down, while his balls were likely growing with the rest of him, I also had the sense that a canine knot was forming at the base of his penis, and that added to the scent of arousal that in a way was driving me wild. A part of him even smelled that way when I&#39;d completed my transformation and burst free from the playground equipment he&#39;d tried to hide in. It made me wonder if Joe was into this sort of thing too, and that only made me start to get wet in anticipation of seeing him transform.<br />
<br />
He continued to grow larger and more powerful, giving off a few growling grunts as he did so. His fur was growing in fast and largely matched his hair color, and as it grew in thick, the seams of his shirt and pants were starting to give way under the growth of his transforming body. I stepped back to give him room and he clambered up onto his feet as his shirt and pants ripped away, revealing a well-muscled and furry body. Only his underwear hadn&#39;t been pulled apart yet, though his enlarging shaft was stretching the elastic on one end and a growing tail was starting to match it on the other end. At the same time, his face began pushing forward into a lupine muzzle with the bones audibly cracking as it pushed forward and as his teeth grew to fit it. It was then that his underwear lost the battle with his tail and came pulled apart at the seams and leaving a now naked Joe in front of me in a powerful werewolf form. <br />
<br />
He now stood taller than me and his muscles were impressive, and his massive erect penis looked even more inviting. It fit a lot of my fantasies and I very much wanted to bounce on that.  He also let out a triumphant howl as his own transformation finished. I soon joined him.<br />
<br />
&quot;I take it you enjoyed that?&quot; Joe asked to me and I smiled back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Very much,&quot; I answered, &quot;and you were right... I did like seeing you burst out of your clothes... it&#39;s very much a turn on.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And that&#39;s what you wanted?&quot; Joe asked.<br />
<br />
I only responded by wagging my tail.</p>
