<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jayden found his way into the magic shop one evening, looking for something to buy for his girlfriend, Sakura. She wasn’t the most visually attractive girl in the world, but he liked her. And she sure liked him. Of course, being the nineteen year old guy he was, he was looking for a set of sexy lingerie that could make a pair of C cup boobs to look like double-D’s. But he had no idea where to look…<br />
<br />
After maybe fourth minutes, he finally came upon a store… it was an odd store. Dark exterior, bright yet dull colours inside. It was a peculiar shop, and yet he was entranced into entering.<br />
He looked all around the store, unable to really find anything that piqued his interest. Until he came upon a small ring. Looked cheap.<br />
<br />
“For yourself?” A voice asked from behind. Jayden almost yelped from surprise, spinning backwards to face an older looking man, “or for a special someone?”<br />
If Jayden didn’t know any better, he would’ve called the old man a wizard, but he held himself back, not wanting to offend him (and possibly to reduce the price of the ring), “f-for a special someone…” he replied,<br />
“Right,” the old man said, “there’s a lot to be said about that ring. It’s one of many,” he began, making his way back to the counter. Jayden didn’t know what else to do, so he awkwardly followed the old man, “each one is a vessel for a powerful type of magic, gifting it’s wearer however much magic is stored within,”<br />
“There’s magic in this?” Jayden asked excitedly<br />
“Yes,” the old man, “but don’t get excited. The ring you hold possesses a type of transformation magic,”<br />
“So I can transform someone with it!” Jayden suggested, a smile widening on his face,<br />
“Not exactly. The magic can be manipulated… but it’s the one who wears it that is transformed,”<br />
“Oh…”<br />
“I will say, the spell is not yet set, if you wanted to pay… a little extra, I could adapt it for you,”<br />
Jayden hesitated, “c-could I make some kind of request? I’ll pay whatever you want!”<br />
“As long as the special someone you have in mind would not be opposed to it. And to remind you, this spell is going to be temporary… at the going price,”<br />
“I-I think… she’d dig it. What price?”<br />
“Well… to manipulate the magic, as well as to keep the ring—”<br />
“I can bring the ring back when it’s done,”<br />
“Well then,” the old man said, “let’s call it forty dollars,”<br />
“Deal!” Jayden said, pulling out his wallet,”<br />
“Slow down, dear boy,” the old man said, leaning over the counter, “first I must ask; what’s your request?”<br />
<br />
—<br />
<br />
A week passes, the old man never gave a second thought to the transaction. Just another day, another sale, and another satisfied customer.<br />
<br />
“I’ll see you on Wednesday,” the old man said, bidding farewell to his store-assistant and pupil, Alexandria,<br />
“Goodbye!” She said politely, nodding as she left the store, the bronze bell ringing above the door as the door swung back and forth.<br />
The old man sighed. Another good day of work. He made his way to the entrance and locked the door in front of him.<br />
For the next hour or so, he swept the floors, reorganised the shelves, and gave the windows a much overdue clean. <br />
<br />
As he was onto the third window, the majority of the display items on the floor in order for him to move around. The old man could two women walking towards him. Unfortunately he was unable to see them clearly having not entirely cleaned the window yet. But they continued to get closer. And closer. Until they were right up to the door.<br />
It was over an hour since the store had been closed, let alone the mall itself.<br />
<br />
Tap Tap Tap<br />
<br />
One woman had begun tapping on the door, rattling the shutters as she did. Whoever she was… she was insistent on getting his attention. He carefully stepped off of the windowsill, making his way around the various knickknacks and merchandise that surrounded his feet, approaching the door.<br />
The tapping got louder and harder, more constant as the woman seemed to be getting more and more impatient,<br />
“One moment,” the old man said, navigating his way around his products he’d yet to really clean up.<br />
The tapping continued, causing the entire door to shake, “I DEMAND you come to the door THIS INSTANT!” A woman practically screamed from the other side,<br />
“I said one moment,” the old man repeated, but the tapping didn’t stop. It turned from tapping, to knocking, eventually to pounding. Frustrated, and for fear of the glass on his door, he waved his hand, causing the knocking to stop immediately.<br />
<br />
He finally arrived at the door, pulling at several locks before opening it towards himself, revealing two women, both looking dramatically different from one-another… yet seeming somewhat related. The older of the two was clearly the one who had been knocking, her hand frozen mid-slam in the air. The old man waved his hand once again, freeing her hand. She appeared to be a woman of Asian descent, wearing a long yellow dress, looking very professional, clearly a mother of some kind. Her black hair tied up in a business bun, makeup that would suit a business-woman. She was generally very appropriately dressed,<br />
“Was it not clear how urgent this matter was!?” The woman said, angrily. She rubbed her hand after being held in the air,<br />
“Please ma’am, you have to understand my store is closed for the day,”<br />
“That doesn’t give you the right to refuse me entry when I have an issue with one of you… products,”<br />
“I understand. But I never said that. I simply meant I was not able to come to the door immediately,”<br />
“Ugh,” the woman scoffed. She moved right past, moving onto the reason she had come to his ‘aid’, “this is— was my daughter,” she said, pointing to the woman behind her. It was almost immediately that the old man recognised the problem.<br />
<br />
The woman behind her appeared to be her daughter, yet she possessed a number of features that most likely didn’t come from her mothers side of the family… or any side of the family.<br />
Her hair was long, straight, a hair and holding it all as it ran down her back. Instead of black, it was a natural shade of blonde. She had a face full of makeup, long eyelashes, a very large set of lips and a pair of silver hoops dangling from her ears. She wore a top that barely covered more than her chest, her toned midriff exposed, leading onto a pair of tight jean-shorts barely holding in her bulbous bubble-butt, toned yet thick thighs and wide hips. The rest of her legs were tall and toned, definitely taller than her mother. She had perfectly manicured feet, wearing a pair of pink high-heels shoes. To match the voluptuous nature of her body, her breasts, even when supported by the magenta crop top, gave off everything they needed to. Firm, round, perfect mounds that would make anyone jealous, envious, lustful…<br />
All this topped off with a fair tan all over her body.<br />
<br />
She was the embodiment of what a nineteen year old boy would consider peak stereotypical feminine sexual attractiveness. She wasn’t anything but natural, but even plastic surgery would barely cover a body of this magnitude.<br />
<br />
“I see the problem. It’s an easy fix, but I have good news!” The old man stared, but immediately was pushed out of the way by the clearly entitled woman in front of him. Her daughter followed ducking down slightly to enter his shop, “uhm excuse me I just…”<br />
“NO!” She shouted, “you will NOT excuse ME, my daughter, over the space of THREE DAYS has turned into a… a big breasted hussy!”<br />
“And can I ask… is your name Sakura?” The old man asked the daughter, directing his attention away from the mother,<br />
“Oh my god! Like… how did you know that!?” She replied, seeming genuinely amused by the fact he guessed her name right, “are you a wizard or something?”<br />
“No no…” he hesitated, “well yes, but no. It would appear I have met your boyfriend, Jayden. Is that correct?”<br />
“Not anymore… my mom made me break up with him and stuff,”<br />
“I see,” the old man said,<br />
<br />
“I expect no judgment on my parenting,” her mother jutted in, “I forced her to break up with him after he caused her to become a monstrosity. It’s only fair,”<br />
“But like, I wanted to become a big bimbo!” Sakura said,<br />
“NO!” The mother yelled, “MY DAUGHTER IS NOT A BIMBO!” She yelled, almost shivering when she used that word,<br />
“Please,” the old man said, “I do have good news for you, my dear,” he said, placing his gaze upon the mother, “she’s only going to remain this way for the next three nights. It’s a six day spell, I’m sure you can understand why it’s that number specifically,” he chuckled, “there’s really no cause for alarm, it’s not permanent whatsoever,”<br />
“You really think you know it all, huh?” The woman said, “but you failed to realise that WE HAVE A WEDDING TO ATTEND TOMORROW!” She yelled, “AND I CANNOT AFFORD TO HAVE MY DAUGHTER SHOW UP WITH A BRAIN THE SIZE OF A WALNUT, AND BREASTS THE SIZE OF HER HEAD!!” She yelled,<br />
“Okay… yes I can see this being an issue,”<br />
“Really?” She sarcastically responded, causing the old man to grow more and more irritated,<br />
“I can’t exactly… reverse the spell,”<br />
“Of course you can’t,” she scoffed,<br />
“But I can do my best to dampen it… and I’m willing to do it free of charge, as long as you’re willing to face a few consequences,”<br />
“Are you seriously threatening me?” The woman said, appearing defensive,<br />
“No, not in the slightest,” he said, “but if you really want this spell to disappear by tomorrow… there are consequences involved,”<br />
“Hnghh,” she groaned,<br />
“It’s that, or you simply don’t bring your daughter to the wedding, and I can somewhat compensate you for your troubles in this circumstance,”<br />
<br />
“Absolutely not,” the woman replied immediately, startling the old man,<br />
“Really?” He replied. His eyes gazed behind him, seeing Sakura fiddling with an item on a shelf, “excuse me!” He called out, “please don’t play with that!”<br />
“HEY!” The mother yelled, “the least you can do is let my braindead daughter fidget with a few gizmo’s,”<br />
“Well I haven’t exactly cleaned up in here…” the old man said, gazing at the mess all over the floor. Then he spotted something, “I suppose…”<br />
“Suppose what?” She asked. The old man leaned down and grabbed a small golden bracelet, it was covered in runes of some kind. To her, they meant nothing. To the old man, they were runes of transferral.<br />
He spoke a few ancient words, and was suddenly able to pull the bracelet apart, duplicating it, holding two, one in each hand.<br />
<br />
“This is likely the best outcome here,” he said, “this bracelet will allow you to transfer attributes between yourself and your daughter. With this, you can share the changes between one-another,”<br />
“Share?” She said, “you said you would undo these changes,”<br />
“I never said that…” he said, almost rolling his eyes for the first time in what seemed like a century, “this is the best scenario. Please believe me,”<br />
“I don’t,” she said, then snatching the bracelet from his hand, “but if you say this’ll do it, then I suppose I’ll humour it,” she said, placing the bracelet around her wrist, “so what do I do with it,”<br />
“Right… so you activate it by tapping on the rune,” the old man said. She complied, tapping the rune, allowing it to begin glowing green.<br />
<br />
“Now,” he said, “Sakura!?” She called, grabbing the attention of her daughter. Her head popped up from behind a shelf, “come over here,” he said.<br />
She made her way over to him, slipping over a few small trinkets, eventually stepping on a little cow plush, making the old man’s heart skip a beat, luckily not activating it. He let out a sigh of relief,<br />
“Yes?” She said, leaning down to speak to the man, “do me a favour and put this on your wrist for me,” he asked. She took the bracelet and put it on her wrist,<br />
“Sure!” She said, “and like I tap it right?” She asked, not waiting for an answer before doing so,<br />
“Yes,” he said, “now both of you, on the count of three, I want you to tap twice the bracelet. Got it?”<br />
“Yes yes,” her mother said, “now on three,” she said, beginning the countdown herself. The old man sighed, crossing his arms as he watched.<br />
<br />
“Two… one…” she counted, “now,” she said. The two both double tapped the bracelets. The bracelets both lit up brighter, their light emanating in an almost mist-like state. Suddenly they shone bright, then back to just glowing.<br />
<br />
“What did that even do?” The mother asked, failing to notice that the zipper at the top of her dress had started to pull down, revealing a small tease of her cleavage. The sleeves began to reduce, creating a tank-top style look to the top of her dress… more like a top now. The zipper widened, revealing her chest in a very open v-neck, all the way down to the bottom of her breasts. Incredibly revealing. Her skirt was shortening, tightening, becoming more promiscuous… and she didn’t seem to have a clue what was going on. After her outfit changed, her hair was next. From (slightly greying) black, blonde streaks spread from the roots until all of her hair was completely blonde. Her numerous grey hairs less apparent due to the lighter hair.<br />
Her nose shrunk a little, her eyes grew a little, her lips plumped bigger and bigger. Her whole face changed to appear sexier, more refined and angular. Her cheekbones, her chin, her cheeks, everything smoothening and deepening. Her makeup began to change, from modest and professional to flashy and glossy. Her eyelashes growing longer as they became darker.<br />
Her cleavage started changing, getting tighter and tighter as her top contained her slowly expanding bust. Their size and shape changing, becoming fuller, rounder, firmer. Before long they were only a few sizes smaller than her head.<br />
Her waist shrank as her hips widened, her thighs growing thicker as her butt ballooned bigger, riding up her already very short skirt. Her yellow panties very visible underneath the skirt. Her legs toned more and more as she grew inch by inch in height, her heels helping her appear even taller than she was already becoming. Soon, she was somewhere around six feet tall, including the shoes.<br />
Her whole body began to darken with a tan. And as this happened, it seemed her mind dumbed down moment by moment. Her eyes losing their intelligence (and arrogance) as she lost more and more common-sense and reason.<br />
<br />
The opposite could be said for her daughter. Sakura’s breasts lost their size, shrinking back to a reasonable, somewhat droopy look. Her butt become normal. Her body reduced back to a chubbier, more lovable state. Her lips shrank, her hair returned to black, losing it’s length and colour. Her butt seemed to be less bubbly, but clearly she was blessed with a rather large rump before any magic was applied. Her makeup returned to a more reasonable, less extreme take.<br />
And finally, her clothes started getting longer, gaining more mass and being a lot less tight around the edges.<br />
<br />
“Whoah… where… mom!?” She said, looking at the bimbo in front of her,<br />
“Yes my dear,” the old man said, making his way over and grabbing both bracelets off of each woman’s wrist. He clinked them back together, forming a single bracelet that he placed neatly on the counter behind him,<br />
“W-what did I do to her?”<br />
“Nothing,” he said, “you remember your boy… friend buying you a special ring, correct?”<br />
“Yeah… and then it’s kinda blurry,”<br />
“Good. That means it worked perfectly,”<br />
“What happened…” Sakura asked.<br />
<br />
“Your boyfriend bought you a ring, it transformed you into a overtly sexualised woman. Your mother brought you here, demanded I fix you. And since I couldn’t fix you, I decided the best thing to do is transfer the transformation over to her,”<br />
“O-okay…” Sakura said, “that… kinda makes sense,”<br />
“Your mother’s changes should only last three days, and should they last any longer, return to me and I’ll see what I can do,”<br />
“B-but what about the wedding. We’ve got a wedding tomorrow and—”<br />
“I am incredibly aware of the wedding, trust me,” the old man said, insisting he doesn’t become frustrated with Sakura as well, “you are, unfortunately, going to have to miss it due to your mother developing a… sickness. Understand?”<br />
“Yes, sir,”<br />
“Good,” he said, “now for your boyfriend. Send him my apologises, and a full refund on his purchase, provided he can return the ring to me,”<br />
“Oh the ring!” Sakura said. She reached into her pocket and grabbed a small ring with a completely empty opalescent gemstone in the centre,<br />
“Well perfect,” he said, “then allow me to repay him if he is to return to the shop whenever he is able to.”<br />
<br />
“Like… what is going on right now?” Sakura’s mother asked, clearly looking very confused, dazed… and a little turned on, “I don’t even know what just happened, but I feel all hot and stuff,”<br />
“Too much information, mom,” Sakura said,<br />
“Wait, I wasn’t a big bimbo lady before!” She said, looking at herself. She grabbed her breasts, beginning to massage them, “I never had big bimbo titties!”<br />
“I’m afraid that for the next three days, you will be stuck in this body,”<br />
“Will she remember this?” Sakura asked,<br />
“She will, but it will take a number of weeks before the memories stop being fuzzy. They’ll appear more like… a dream you can loosely remember. But all the parts will be there,”<br />
“Alright, thank you,” Sakura said,<br />
“And please keep an eye on her. If you lose sight of her… there’s a lot of trouble that body get find itself in,”<br />
“I will,” Sakura said,<br />
“And goodbye to you, Asami Tanaka,” the old man said to her mother. Even behind her tight, big lipped, makeup covered face she seemed to scowl at the old man. The two left the store, both having been changed in quite the opposite way. <br />
<br />
As the door shut, the old man made no effort to watch as they walked away. He locked the door, pulling the shutter tight on each window. He sighed, knowing he’d just wasted a perfectly good hour with two completely useless customers… not to mention they never spent a cent in his store! That wasn’t going to keep the lights on… but at least they were out of his hair.<br />
<br />
He sighed. He decided to pick up all the objects and antiquities left on the floor and put them back where they belong.<br />
It took him around an hour, but by the end of it, he felt relieved.<br />
<br />
As he finished placing every time back on it’s shelf, he realised he’d forgotten one final lock on the door. He tutted himself as he approached the door. And with one final, simple twist.<br />
<br />
Click<br />
<br />
The door was locked.<br />
<br />
PSH!<br />
<br />
The old man stood up straight… he didn’t know what that sound was. And it worried him. He turned around, and immediately made eye contact with that small. Cow. Plush.<br />
<br />
“Shit.”<br />
<br />
—<br />
<br />
Alexandria arrived hastily, finding her key and quickly unlocking the door, “sorry it took me so long!” She said, entering the shop. She remembered the shopkeepers instructions, quickly covering her mouth,<br />
“Can you throw that damn thing outside!” A voice said from within the shop. Alexandria didn’t answer, simply complying. She covered her mouth, locating the cow plush, grabbing it and throwing it outside. She shut the door, preparing to deal with it later.<br />
<br />
“Thank you,” the voice said. Standing up from behind the counter was not the shopkeeper… at least not the way Alexandria was expecting. She couldn’t help but snicker a little, “I’ll curse you for that,” the shopkeeper commented, waddling into view.<br />
<br />
In front of Alexandria was the shopkeeper, but younger, plumper, and a completely female. She was completely nude, her belly wide like her hips, thighs thick, butt bulbous. But most prominently was her incredibly large, watermelon sized breasts, pouring out milk all over the floor, as well as a brand new udder protruding from right underneath her stomach doing the exact same. Her head had two small horns poking out from the top, as well as her ears larger and longer. Her skin had dark brown spots all over. It wouldn’t take a genius to say she’d taken on a few cow-like characteristics,<br />
“Do me a favour and get a bucket,” the shopkeeper said.<br />
<br />
“Of course,” Alexandria said through a smirk. Returning to the storage room to grab a bucket as requested.<br />
<br />
—<br />
<br />
The rest of the night consisted of Alexandria awkwardly milking the shopkeeper. The shopkeeper unable to stop himself from moaning as she did, being that the experience was incredibly pleasurable.<br />
After he was reduced down to a manageable size, he cast a spell to appropriately clothe him. It did it’s job, giving him a tight cow-print dress, boots, fishnet stockings, a pair of black gloves and very cow-themed makeup. Alexandria couldn’t help herself from laughing before helping retrieve the cow-plush from outside.<br />
<br />
And the final action of the night consisted of the shopkeeper and Alexandria speaking and negotiating with the Milk-Obsessed Demon ‘Kal-Mi’, using her Cow-Idol to contact her, eventually finding a use for all that milk they’d accumulated.<br />
<br />
—<br />
<br />
For the next two weeks, the shopkeeper remained a woman, minus the horns, a little slimmer, and only presenting an udder past nine o’clock. He would continue milking himself until he’d reached a milk-quota and Kal-Mi was pleased. And then finally, the spell was broken.<br />
<br />
Sakura and her mother, Asami, never returned. But Jayden did. He returned to claim his refund. He was a little shocked to see a woman standing before him, but he seemed to understand things weren’t so night-and-day in this kind of place. Instead of a money refund, Jayden took a bottle of mints that would transform any individual who ate them into a complete bombshell, and they only lasted six hours at a time.<br />
It was only until Jayden decided to try them for himself… and then eat more than one at once. But that’s a story for another chapter.</p>
