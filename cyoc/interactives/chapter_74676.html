<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It only took two days for another prince to come looking for me. In those two days, I felt I had gotten to <br />
know Morgana fairly well. She was slutty and evil, but she was kind, at least to me. She always made sure I <br />
was perfect. She washed me, fed me, even gave me my own bedroom instead of that blasted cage. Granted, it had <br />
bars on the window and a magic lock on the door, but it was an improvement. I was still her captive, and I was <br />
about to be given reason. As soon as the prince showed up on her property, Morgana teleported me back to the <br />
cage. From there, I could see Prince Daniel. He was a foreigner, so he must have traveled far to come for me. <br />
He was a hunter by the look of it, and unlike Jake, he came alone. Not even a horse was with him, so all he <br />
had was his leather armor and his bow and arrows.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, it's time again. I have just the trap for him.&quot; Morgana said. Suddenly, the two women were in the front <br />
hall of Morgana's castle. Daniel would be just behind the door in front of them. Realizing a chance to run <br />
away, I tried to run for the door. However, I was shackled to the wall.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry, can't have you ruining my fun.&quot; Morgana said as she started casting once more. This time, there was no <br />
leather, and she simply started making motions at certain parts of the room. As she did, they appeared to <br />
change. First the floor became grassy, then the walls seemed to disappear into woods. I looked down to see I <br />
looked like a particularly curvy tree. Then Morgana shackled my neck to the wall to stop me from moving at <br />
all. As she continued to change the hall into an illusion of a forest, the front door started to creak open. <br />
Morgana hurriedly finished the spells and transformed herself. As the door opened, Daniel was greeted by a <br />
dense forest with an attractive dryad in it. He knocked an arrow, but didn't raise his bow. Instead, he walked <br />
over to Morgana.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello prince, are you looking for the witch?&quot; She asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes. What is this place? I thought it was a small castle.&quot; Daniel said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, it is. However, the actual castle is in these woods. Here, let me show you where it is.&quot; Morgana said as <br />
she started to walk. Miraculously, the illusion shifted so she appeared to be walking into the forest even <br />
though the forest was really a wall. Daniel followed her, and the whole room seemed to move with them. <br />
Eventually, they stopped.<br />
<br />
&quot;What is it? Are we there?&quot; Daniel asked as he raised his bow and started aiming it at nothing.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, but I feel something. Come with me.&quot; Morgana said as she ran to a certain point in the room. Lying there <br />
was what looked like a deer. It was clearly dying.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, this is terrible. Please prince, you must help me.&quot; Morgana pleaded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, but you still have to take me to the witch afterward.&quot; Daniel said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh of course prince. Now, there's only one way to save this doe.&quot; Morgana said as an evil smile appeared on <br />
her face. She turned to Daniel and stretched out an arm toward him. The other arm was pointed at the deer. An <br />
arc of light shot between the animal and Daniel, traveling through Morgana. As it connected with Daniel, he <br />
started to change. First his mouth and nose stretched out into a snout. Then his spine cracked, forcing him <br />
onto all fours. His clothes fell away, revealing a thin coat of brown fur growing on him. Next, his penis was <br />
pulled inside of him, replaced by a tender clitoris. The rest of the transformation occurred very rapidly, but <br />
within moments, there was a doe standing where Daniel had been before.<br />
<br />
&quot;There, now it's all better. And about the witch,&quot; Morgana said as the room shifted back to normal, &quot;here she <br />
is.&quot; With that, Morgana's disguise fell, and the doe started to run away.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh no, you can't leave. There's still so much for you to do. We need to explore your new form.&quot; Morgana said. <br />
After she had said that, she started to change again. This time, she changed in a very similar way to Daniel, <br />
but with some differences. Her vagina stretched out into a large penis, and antlers grew from her head. <br />
Meanwhile, the shackle around my neck vanished.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now, here is my offer. If I can screw you without making you cum, I will turn you into a stag. If you cum <br />
though, I will set you loose into a herd and change all the herd's does into stags so that you are the only <br />
thing they can breed with, understand?&quot; Morgana asked. Shockingly, she sounded the same despite her new body. <br />
After a moment, Daniel nodded. Morgana smiled and mounted Daniel, thrusting her penis deep into Daniel's new <br />
vagina. Daniel's knees nearly buckled from the pleasure, and she came in a matter of moments. Morgana didn't <br />
stop though. She continued for a good half hour before finally cumming into Daniel and transforming back into <br />
a human. She was still nude, not bothering to put her clothes back on after her transformation. In the time it <br />
took er to cum once, Daniel had came at least twenty times.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, that went worse for you than I expected. Just for that, I think I'll make a few adjustments to you <br />
too.&quot; Morgana said. She snapped her fingers and Daniel's rear and vagina swelled. In addition, she now had <br />
clearly visible breasts, six of them, under her. Before they were covered by fur, but now they showed enough <br />
that Morgana was able to reach down and start pinching one. Then they teleported away. Morgana was back soon, <br />
and she had a mirror with her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I love my work.&quot; She said.<br />
<br />
&quot;What's the mirror for?&quot; I asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I didn't tell you did I? I have these magic mirrors in my workshop so I can watch a few of my former...&quot; <br />
Morgana paused, trying to think of a word.<br />
<br />
&quot;Victims?&quot; I suggested.<br />
<br />
&quot;I was going to say conquests but that works too. Actually, now that I think about it, you should have some of <br />
these too. It's important to take pride in your work, and Jake and Daniel were at least partially your work. <br />
So, I'll go put a couple of these mirrors in your room.&quot; Instantly, I was in that room, and two mirrors were <br />
on the wall. I watched them intently. Daniel was already being rutted by a stag and clearly trying not to <br />
enjoy it, and Jake was serving a man drinks in a maid's uniform. Behind her were a few other women that looked <br />
exactly like her except for their hair color doing the same. It appeared that Morgana had managed to trap more <br />
than just the two princes in new forms. I would have to be careful so she didn't want to do anything to me.</p>
