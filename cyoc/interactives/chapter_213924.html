<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I followed the minotaur, appreciating his form as we walked, and working out how I could best please him in our next downtime together. I&#39;m glad he is unclothed, showing off that natural power that he gained after turning into a bull. It&#39;s hard to believe he was my teacher at some point, though maybe it&#39;s not all that surprising. He is still really kind, and nice, and knows exactly where to scratch and pet me. The mere idea of him rubbing my stomach or ruffling my fur is exhilarating, and I look forward to whatever training he has planned.<br />
<br />
&quot;In here, Jeremy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mr Holstein puts his hand on a part of the wall. The stone rising up to reveal a tranquil lake, healthy green grass and clear blue sky. Is it a part of the game&#39;s world? Do I even care at this point? I run in alongside my teacher, instinctually going to the shallows of the water and wetting my golden fur. Pressing my head into the clear liquid, rolling onto my back and kicking my legs in the air. Scratching my skin on the wet dirt, and listening to the pure laugh of my new owner.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hahaha, that&#39;s a good boy. Did you want to help me fish?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes! How do I do it? Is this part of the training?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course, and I&#39;ll help you each step of the way.&quot;<br />
<br />
He flicks his right hand, materializing a sleek blue fiber rod out of the air. Already baited, tossed into the water as I move to the minotaur and sit by his legs. Lazily resting my head against his loincloth, absorbing my owners stink, and watching the hook bob up and down in the water. The steady rhythm combined with the bull&#39;s healthy musk getting my mind ready for the lesson. His deodorant had all worn out, letting me take in his natural smell. It was the stink of a barnyard, yet somehow pleasant to my nose. An ambrosial scent that I put my entire focus on, as I positioned my muzzle under his loincloth and took direct sniffs. Tongue licking the underside of his cock, as he held the rod with one hand, and patted my back with the other. It feels so good to be his little shoony...<br />
<br />
&quot;Now Jeremy, I did want you to do some training. You&#39;ve been a very good boy, and this is exactly where I want you while I&#39;m fishing.&quot;<br />
<br />
I didn&#39;t want to speak. My continued licks and laps at his cockhead were confirmation enough that I was content.<br />
<br />
&quot;But how about you fish a bit yourself? A good dog like you can track a fish in the water and bring it to your owner, hmm?&quot;<br />
<br />
Of course I could! If he said I can, then I can. I look over to the lake, spotting fish swimming around the shallow end. My paws splashing in the water as I run after them with mouth wide opened. It scared the fish away, though I was determined, chasing another down as the water got deeper and I started to swim. My chubby body slowing me down, but I&#39;d be good, I&#39;d catch it for Master Holstein! Something heavy hit my back as I swam ahead. Piercing past my fur and combining with my person. I looked back for a second to see my minotaur drawing magical invocations which were fired into my body. An enchantment! Maybe this will help with the training!<br />
<br />
It became hard to focus on anything but the fish in front of me. My bigger body slimming down to become better suited for the water. Losing that cute fat and gaining sleek muscle. Helping me to catch up with the brown fish ahead, grabbing it with my teeth and paddling back to my master. Almost dropping the fish due to my wide smile from the achievement. Placing it down by his feet, getting a pat on the head, then going off for more. <br />
<br />
My cock pushed out of my sheath, red head cooled by the water as I sank down to find another treat for my master. My body gaining its last year of growth as I spotted a brightly scaled fish. Becoming larger, arms longer to better reach for my master&#39;s cock, hand bigger to easily contain the girth. Legs spread further and becoming firmer to retain a squatted stance as I rest by his side. With those benefits also being useful as I dart through the waters and grab my target with my bigger maw. Prancing over to my master, depositing the fish, then sinking again. Cock slapping between my legs, each success giving me all the pleasure I could need.<br />
<br />
For the third, I felt my thin body gaining strength. The sleek muscle pushing out to show months of training. It was nothing gargantuan like Master Holstein. No veiny and huge biceps nor cushiony pecs. But strength enough to run, hunt, and snuggle with him. Smaller than him, but still strong, exactly what he wanted. All equipped to grab another fish, feel my cock throb, and drop it with the rest. I wasn&#39;t even thinking anymore, and I didn&#39;t need to think. I just needed to get more, and get rewarded for it.<br />
<br />
It was now the fourth time I went after these fish, but it felt like the hundredth. This repetition looped in my mind, clearing out unneeded thoughts like my family, or the life I once had. Pushing them away for the needed movements and instincts for fishing, and for pleasuring my master. I still remembered the other monsters, still remembered Sam. But Holstein was so nice to me, he did everything for me, he looks after me. A few strands of fur greyed as I nabbed the fourth target, cock dribbling pre into the water as I walked it over, received another pet, and came onto the grass. Being careful to release my load away from the goods I had gathered. The arousal created by the mere fact that I had done a good job, that I was the perfect pet for Master Holstein.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now that&#39;s my Jeremy, who&#39;s my cute little dog boyfriend?&quot;<br />
<br />
Me! I&#39;m his cute little dog boyfriend! My acknowledgment was met with a collar locking around my neck. Inscribed with my name on the front, and my owner&#39;s details on the back. Just in case I ever got lost, or needed to call him when out in public. My body was fatigued from the four fish I had gathered, the back of my ear being scratched by Master Holstein, as he always did when he was proud of me.<br />
<br />
&quot;Rest up, Jeremy. You met your training perfectly.&quot;<br />
<br />
I was so glad to hear that. I started to pant, hot breath running along my master&#39;s cock as I squatted down and got back to pleasuring his cockhead. Working my tongue along his dick, encouraging him to climax with my constant hot breaths. Keeping him hard and happy as he built up a pile of his own catches. Occasionally I stopped for short moments to make sure he doesn&#39;t reach his limit too early, then got back to it when his groans and grunts ceased. Only pushing him past the point of no return when the sun starts to set. My muzzle the perfect size to perfectly contain his cock. Mouth wrapped around his dick as he bursts his cum into me, and I clean up any remaining mess he might have made.<br />
<br />
I pulled my head out of his loincloth after a job well done. Looking up to the proud yet stern face of my owner, as he crouches and brings me into a hug. Collapsing onto my body, moving the both of us to the floor as we snuggle, and I fall still. Giving myself entirely over to him, letting him position us as he likes. Bringing me tightly against him, as we both close our eyes and doze off with the setting sun. This is the first day of my great new life, of being nothing more than the simple pet and boyfriend of this domain&#39;s master of history. <br />
<br />
It&#39;s the best life I could wish for, and it&#39;s the only life I can imagine.</p>
