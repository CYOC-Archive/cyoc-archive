<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The next morning, Tommy noticed that he had forgotten to charge his phone, something he forgot regularly. Not seeing any problem with charging it at work, he took a relaxing shower and put his clothes on, his shoes only before leaving his flat. He got breakfast on his way, and reached his destination ready to start working.<br />
-<br />
Ken, not being able to wake up from his dream in the darkness, laying unmovable around, was bored to death by this. Why was he trapped like this, even in his dreams? Wasn´t it enough to not being able to move freely? Maybe it was a sign of an illness, not that he knew much about such. But how would you explain his situation?<br />
It felt like an eternity when something changed. A light appeared, growing wider and blinding Ken in his dream, but he still heard a thud sound from whatever had been moved beside him. Before he had regained his senses, someone grabbed him, dragging him out of wherever he was, by hooking into both his mouth and his ass.<br />
“What the hell?” went through his head, having the distant feeling of being touched in the same spots in the waking world. And then he felt something push into his mouth, something big. He wanted to gag, but couldn´t. He felt the pressure built up on his tongue, and felt his arms stiffen. Next, something equally big pressed into his ass, followed by his cock being pressed tightly and his legs stiffen.<br />
It was the same feelings he had while awake. That couldn´t be by chance, right? Just as his sight was returning more to normal, watching the ground approach him, he woke with a scream. Only for said scream ending up muffled by whatever invisible force had again pushed his mouth far too wide open, letting his jaw hurt worse than it would if being punched.<br />
Ken laid in his bed, covered by his blanket, with the now known repeating cycle of pain. He was unmovable again, and it didn´t take long for the salty taste to return as well. Another day of this weird torture had started, and he hadn´t even been able to leave his bed. It did little to dampen the pain he went through. And he hadn´t really eaten anything since this all started, making him rather hungry. He was sure that he wouldn´t even complain if just a few flies flied down his open mouth so he could get something.<br />
-<br />
It was hours into work that Tommy checked his now charged phone. He noticed a message from Ken, and opened it smiling. “Finally, he got around to write something. Well, you feeling stuffed, big brother, will be my feet pushed into you, hehe. That´s also why you smell and taste feet, my feet specifically. And the pain will most likely also be me, it seems you feel every step I take in you, huh? Now, why would your limbs be stiff and unmovable? For that I have no idea right now. Well, I will just have to visit you later.”<br />
Tommy worked for another three hours before he headed out. He had taken his old shoes with him, and made sure that after an hour of jogging outside, that he switched into his old shoes. He wouldn´t present Ken with his connected shoes, not that he noticed anything when Tommy took them off before his eyes.<br />
The shoes went into a thrash back, the ties again bond to not hang around, before being stuffed into his backpack, to not stink it up. Then, he made his way up to Ken´s flat.<br />
-<br />
Ken´s day had been as torturous as the last. He couldn´t do anything while he laid in his bed, unable to move, while also feeling the reappearing pain in his back and his legs.<br />
His earlier hope, that Tommy would come to see him, was unfulfilled, but he had no way of knowing if Tommy had answered his message since the evening before. Could it be that he ignored him?<br />
His earlier thought about a fly landing in his mouth as something to eat was otherwise blocked. Around an hour of lying there, something slowly walked over his skin, up from his neck. Ken felt it move inside his mouth, but then the contact vanished for some time. After maybe another hour, he felt something in a corner of his mouth, and whatever it was just stayed there.<br />
Unbeknownst to Ken, a spider had decided to use his open mouth to spin her web, seeing as it could easily invite some flies. When the web was finished, the spider took up a small corner, right next to Ken´s upper-left wisdom tooth. Sadly, not a single fly flew into the web, leaving the spider without a meal.<br />
Hours into the day, which seemed to Ken like an eternity, he felt whatever was inside his mouth vanish, making him close his mouth and swallow to get a bit of moisture back inside. That left the spider to be rushed down his throat, ending up a meal itself, unbeknownst to Ken still. He would never know he had just swallowed a spider.<br />
Easing the pressure in his ass next, Ken let out a sigh of relieve. He had been lucky, his bladder and bowels had still been to empty to let anything out, so neither his underwear nor his bed had any mess he would need to clean.<br />
Ever so slowly, he could move his body more, even when his fingers and toes remained as stiff as before. He could finally leave his bed slowly. And just as he stepped into the bathroom, his doorbell sounded. With no way to answer it verbally, and still only in his underwear, Ken was swinging between answering and ignoring it.<br />
Lucky for him, whoever was there knew he had a hidden key, and shortly after, the door was opened from the outside.<br />
-<br />
Tommy reached Ken´s flat and ringed the bell. When nothing was heard from the inside, he decided to use the hidden key Ken had placed under his doormat, hidden by an extra layer to not be that oblivious. Tommy knew that trick from their parents as well, even if he didn´t use it.<br />
The first thing inside he took notice of was the putrid smell of piss and shit, making him hold his nose closed. “Ken? What have you done that your living room smells like this? Is your plumbing defect?” he called inside, but received no answer. But soon he could see the dried mess on the couch, and he opened a window to get some air in.<br />
-<br />
Hearing his brother out in the living room gave Ken some hope, but he still hadn´t drunken anything, meaning he couldn´t answer. But he took the opportunity, being inside his bathroom now, to drink a few sips of water from the tap, moistening his mouth more than his few, dry swallows of spit.<br />
Not wanting to let more time flow by, he left his bathroom, and his bedroom, to greet his brother in the living room.<br />
“Tommy, finally” he croaked out when he saw his brother by the now wide-open window.<br />
-<br />
Tommy turned when his brother greeted him, and was surprised that Ken had forgone all clothes beside a pair of underwear. Hearing the croaked tone, he knew Ken hadn´t been able to drink much, if anything for some time.<br />
“What do you mean, finally? You were supposed to show up at the lab two days ago, but there was nothing, not even a text from you. And now that you have send something, you think I would drop anything I was doing for some cryptic message?” he said, sounding annoyed. It was an act that he didn´t care, but Ken wasn´t bright enough to get it.<br />
-<br />
Ken looked a bit apological at his brother, but what could he have done? “I couldn´t move, Tommy. As I texted you, I was trapped with a not responding body for the last two days. And today was the same. Why didn´t you react sooner?” he croaked out again, turning a bit angry at his brother.<br />
“Now I´m at fault? I didn´t get your text until midday today. Okay, I forgot to charge my phone yesterday, but I couldn´t know when you would finally do something, could I? You are not the first one of our test subjects that didn´t respond on the set time, but mostly they never respond. Maybe I would have checked on you next weekend if I hadn´t heard anything.” Tommy answered him. <br />
Ken was taken aback, Tommy wasn´t one to get angry easily. Maybe it was because it was work related. “Have you ever checked on these not responding test subjects? Are they okay?” he croaked out again. While to him, others were not interesting, it would be good to know that they were okay.<br />
“Yeah, we are obligated to check on them after a week at the latest, to make sure there isn´t any lasting side-effect. They were all okay, just had lost interest in the experiments. While it was a way to get money fast, some weren´t too happy about all the tests we did. Others had effects like you, only on a smaller scale it seems.” Tommy explained the procedure.<br />
Ken, like he always did when Tommy talked to much, had turned deaf after he got the answer he wanted, that the others were okay. So, it wouldn´t be lasting for him. <br />
-<br />
Seeing Ken had spaced out again, Tommy sighed quietly. Seeing as Ken didn´t even realize he had stopped talking, he tipped him at the shoulder before asking: “Is there anything else I should now about your situation? And, do you want to continue with the tests?”<br />
Ken thought about it for a few seconds. “As I said, I couldn´t do anything, for most of the time. I haven´t eaten anything since the evening after being in the lab, the cereal from the first day is still on the table in the kitchen. But weirdly, I´m not hungry. But I taste something salty all the time. I only drunk water in the times I could move, but beside a shower to ease my muscles, I didn´t do anything but sleep between these times I can´t move. Oh, and in my dreams, I´m unmovable, as well. I just lay there and can do nothing. The first night was your lab, and last night a dark place I couldn´t make out. Got only blinded when finally, there was light and someone grabbed and moved me.”<br />
When Ken didn´t continued, Tommy asked: “And the night in between? And what about my second question?”<br />
Ken tried to remember the second night. “That night, I dreamt that while I was unmovable, I was somehow suspended midair. There was a running tv for some time, until it turned off. And hours later, whatever held me in the air pushed me down to the ground. And then I heard you talking, but I don´t remember what you said exactly. Something about shoes not taken off, and getting ready. And if I did something all night? I´m not sure.” Then he thought about the question. “Well, you said the others were okay afterwards. I just hope the stiffness and immobility would stop. But beside that, I would be okay continuing.” <br />
Tommy nodded at that. He now had some things to think about. “Think you can come to the lab tomorrow? I want to run some tests still, but now it´s closed, and I don´t have any equipment to test you here.”<br />
“As long as I can move, yes, I would come. Maybe you can find out why I can´t move.” Ken agreed, and after a few minutes, Tommy left. They just weren´t close enough for long talks.<br />
-<br />
Tommy walked home in his old shoes, not bothering changing them for the short trip. And while he enjoyed hearing all the side-effects of him wearing the Ken-linked shoes, he would need his brother in the lab the next day, therefore a bit of being not used would be okay. He would put him back on tomorrow after Ken had left. He would wait for him to be home again. Maybe with another hour in the tank, he could make the connection a bit lighter?<br />
Then there were the dreams. Ken dreamt from the viewpoint, if you call it that, of the shoes. First, in the lab, second, on his feet the whole night, and last, his shoe cabinet. If he wasn´t so dense, he should really connect the dots. Especially after hearing Tommy talk. He remembered what he said that morning.<br />
After a small dinner, Tommy went to bed, still thinking too much about all this.<br />
-<br />
Ken enjoyed an evening without much limitation. Yes, he was still stiff, and still had limited movement with his fingers, but he could move around. He drunk a lot, as if to compensate his body for the missing fluids of the last days. He still didn´t eat anything before heading to bed when he got tired.<br />
His dreams were of a dark place yet again. And he laid there, unmoving, silent, and bored out of his mind. At least he woke up hours later, without any blinding lights or something similar.</p>
