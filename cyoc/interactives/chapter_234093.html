<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kyle jumps in front of Aaron, looking with malicious intent at his older brother, the sheer hornyness exhaling from him in the form of a musk cloud turned him on even more, the animalist desire to remind his bitch who is in command even after he got his dick back. &quot;Even after all i did last night, your ass is the best one in town,&quot; Kyle snorts like a bull. &quot;Look at me bro, how masive i am, how much bigger im gonna get, how big you made me.&quot; The towering giant shows his pride flexing his giant biceps as a display of dominance, his smell hitting his nose as he crash down on his brother, he steams sweat, Aaron was shocked, now that he had his size back, he felt somewhat in control, but now he sees that he may never get it back, the fear in his eyes is just more lust for his behemoth sibling.<br />
<br />
The morning was full of sex and worshipping, after Aaron cummed just from being fingered by the fat meaty fingers of his bro, Kyle made his brother not only take his giant  twenty one inches dick up the ass, but to lick the cum and sweat out of it, to savor the smell from underneath the glands, to sit on his crotch while rubbing his abs until he cums again and pecs, Aaron felt how hairy his &quot;little&quot; bro had become. Later Kyle finished the humiliation round with stuffing his brother under his armpits and closing the humogous arm while he plead for mercy, Kyle only laughed. &quot;This is how a real man smells, all the hard work pays off, and this is your reward of it speaking of which.&quot; He releases Aaron from his musky prison and leaves he room.<br />
<br />
Aaron felt like he had been hit by a truck, a smelly one, despite all this humiliation, he couldn&#39;t deny it, he felt good, something in his brother, the smell, the size, his handsomeness, how he dominates the ambient with his rugged voice, his brother was a giant pillar of masculinity and virility, something Aaron could only imagine, he starts to rub his dick with the cum his brother jizzed all over him room, enthralled by his image on his head, the smell from his armpits stuck on his face, after minutes of blissness, his concentration is broken by a loud BUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRP coming from the kitchen, looks like the big guy got his calorie intake for the moning.<br />
<br />
For the next two days, all they did was sex, school, eat, workout and worship, all the way from their rooms to the basement, but Kyle was mad, despite everything he did, his growth seemed to have slowed, he didn&#39;t even got more than 30 pounds, his cock only grew 1 inch more, he was still getting bigger, but at a slower rate, not even eating more was helping, he had to find a way to return his growth rate, or to accelerate even more, and he has just the idea in mind.<br />
<br />
Aaron woke up the next day without a flappy semi hard cock on his face or the pungeant smell of man permeating his room, he got scared that something had happened to his brother and start searching, no cum flooding the bathtub, no sign of him on his room or the kitchen, on his homemade gym on the basement he saw a note written. - Had to set somethings right lil bitch bro, come back later.- hes skipping school again, Aaron bet, but this is the opportunity to have a normal day on school.<br />
<br />
While the older brother enjoeyed his time, Kyle didn&#39;t waste time, if having Aaron bitching all over his pilar of masculinity made he grow bigger and bigger by the day, imagina what having a lot of other muscle sluts worshipping his god physic while he workout, he had totry it out. Waking up earlier, Kyle takes out on the streets with a blue tank top fighting to stay on the titanic torso, revealing his 8 pack abs and gigantic biceps together with the hairy bush in his armpits, a white jockstrap with cum stains on the front, a black short that revealed everything he had to show, his obscene bulge and bubble but, and to top it of, gigantic size 26 sport shoes and socks, Kyle was ready to take over some bitches and conquer them like he did with his brother.<br />
<br />
Kyle left the house and start running down the streets, there was a 24 hour gym just 8 blocks below his house, all that movement made him all sweaty, and when he took a whif of his musk, he started tenting on his shorts, a bit of pre already leaking, he was all set up. Reaching the gym, he was already drenched in sweat, entering the place, the receptionist was so impressed by the sheer gargantuan man that crossed the door, he didn&#39;t even bothered to check him in, Kyle already felt like a king. He took some weight plates and put on the biggest bar he could find and started benching over 1000 lbs, he grunted and banged the weights as much as he could, the gym had some guys of all sizes, all looking directly at him and impressed by the mountain of muscle, and the big tool in his shorts, begging to be released, Kyle benched, curled and did leg press with a heavy machine, he couldnt fit in the machine, after he was finished, he took out the tank top that didn&#39;t covered anything and looked at his muscles, all pumped out and started flexing and hitting poses, the 6 guys in the gym impressed by the gun show happening and approaching to see it closely, Kyle plan worked.<br />
<br />
The next part of it was in motion, Kyle said he had bigger equipment at his home, and that he could lift even more, and they all could see it, just go home with him, stoping in various places to buy the big guy food, shakes and more, everything to fuel this gigantuan muscle beast and his bulk.<br />
<br />
Aaron reaches his home later that day at 15:00, expecing to find his brother, when he listen to clanks coming from the house, Kyle is on his workout already and probably won&#39;t excuse him again for not being there. Aaron enters the house rushing to the basement justifying himself alreadt, but he found no one there, not even his machines, he hears more clanks coming from outside, when Aaron comes out of the basement, he notices the kitchen is full of bags of fastfood, empty protein shake tubs, the living room sofa had plates, cups and ropes of cum on the ground, more clanks coming from the backyard, Aaron goes there to check what was happening, opening the door he is met by the most enthralling vision of all, his brother, lifting more than 1400 lbs of iron while 6 men bitch moan and worship his muscles, one in each armpit, sniffing his manly musk straight from the source while pinching his nipples, two guys taking care of his legs, feeling the muscles and the heat irradiating from his hard cock, one carrying a giant jug of water for him, and other wiping the sweat of his eyebrows with a towel.<br />
<br />
Kyle heard the door opening and stopped his workout, he stand up, still siting on the bench &quot;Hey bro, you got company today, made more bitches on the way home.&quot; Kyle grabs the dude with the towel and raises his arm, shoving him on his sweaty armpit, the guy starts to lick, tickling him. &quot;They make ends meet, but my cock throne waits for you, come before i make you.&quot; Aaron feels so weirded by other guys being around his naked brother working out on the backyard, he didn&#39;t felt aroused by it like the other times, even the fear of being crushed by his gargantuan hands did anything to him, he was paralyzed by shame of being watched by all these man, of being made public on how his &#39;little&#39; brother made him so submissive, but when that salty aroma hit his nose, he couldn&#39;t control himself, he looked ath that cock flopping around at Kyle command, he started undressing himself ready to do his muscle god bidding, it was like Kyle had powers over him, and all these man, powers that made them submissive to him,  to want to worship this man like the god he was.<br />
<br />
The rest of the day they worshiped, sucked and worked out at Kyle command, they didn&#39;t had other thought in their heads other than serving him, and Kyle felt good, when the night came around, they all went inside to eat, they were all tired and needed to recharge their energies, Kyle just dropped down on the basement, he was enamored by the power he leveraged today, and was ready to do this all over again tomorrow, but first thing he wanted to do, it was to measure himself, and to see if all of this paid itself, he drifts of in his sleep, dreaming of being a giant, towering over people, and all he does is to lift and eat, his body, a temple of worship to his subjects, their faith on him making him grow bigger by the day.<br />
<br />
On the next morning...</p>
