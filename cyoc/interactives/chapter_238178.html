<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You decided you didn’t want to hear about the French Revolution, you pictured yourself in a western saloon in the heart of 1882. Suddenly the classroom disappeared and you found yourself in a bustling saloon, the air thick with tobacco smoke and the hum of rowdy patrons. The bar was a long, polished oak counter, worn smooth by years of use. Behind it stood Hector, a chubby older man with a bushy mustache and a apron stained from years of service. You pushed your way through the crowd and leaned against the bar, calling out<br />
<br />
 “Whiskey, sir!” <br />
<br />
For some ADD hypersexual reason you wondered what the barman would look like as a nfl Dallas cowboys cheerleader serving these men drinks as Hector poured you a glass, his hands steady despite the din around him. <br />
<br />
As he set it down, you noticed something peculiar. The floor beneath him began to ripple, like water disturbed by a stone. Hector looked down, his brow furrowing in confusion. The ripples grew more intense, and suddenly, Hector&#39;s body started to... change. His apron fell away, revealing a toned stomach that would make any cowboy proud. His arms elongated, muscles popping into definition. His chest broadened, and his shoulders narrowed. The transformation was rapid, like watching a sculptor&#39;s clay take form under their hands. The saloon fell silent, all eyes on Hector.<br />
<br />
 Hector&#39;s face contorted in pain, but his voice was a deep, resonant rumble as he cried out, What sorcery is this?! The floor beneath him began to glow, and words appeared, scrawled in a fiery script: Allowed to do Anything. The same words from the talisman. The transformation continued. Hector&#39;s hair grew long and blonde, cascading down his back in waves. His mustache disappeared, replaced by full, luscious lips. His skin took on a golden tan, and his eyes... his eyes turned a piercing blue, like the sky on a clear summer&#39;s day. The transformation ended as suddenly as it had begun, leaving Hector standing there, now a Dallas Cowboys cheerleader in their 20’s wearing a bikini, riding boots, and a cowboy hat. <br />
<br />
The saloon erupted in chaos. Men shouted, women screamed. Some crossed themselves, muttering about the devil&#39;s work. You stood there, watching the spectacle unfold, a sense of calm amidst the storm. You raised your voice, shouting over the din. “Folks, this is no devilry! This is just... normal. Now, why don&#39;t you all go home to your wives and leave uhhh- my patient here with me?” <br />
<br />
The crowd hesitated, then began to disperse, muttering amongst themselves. You turned to the women of the saloon, the prostitutes who had been watching the scene unfold with wide eyes. <br />
<br />
“Ladies, you said, I need your help. This budding young woman needs a bath. The women exchanged glances, then nodded, a few of them giggling nervously. They gathered around Hector, helping him down from the bar. He looked at you, his new eyes filled with confusion and fear. <br />
“ Don’t you worry one bit missy I’m allowed to do anything.” you reminded him as he rapidly continued becoming a her.<br />
<br />
As the transformation of Hector, now Daisy, concluded, you found yourself staring at a sight that was equal parts bewildering and arousing. The shrinking bulge in Daisy&#39;s bikini bottoms was no longer a mere suggestion of masculinity but a concave moist vagina, its lips glistening and inviting. The tavern girls, initially hesitant, now gathered around Daisy, their eyes wide with curiosity and desire. You joined them, helping to undress Daisy, her new body trembling with each touch. “Girls” you said, your voice firm yet gentle.<br />
<br />
“let&#39;s give this woman a bath. She&#39;s had a long day.”<br />
<br />
The women nodded, their hands now more eager than hesitant. They led Daisy to a large wooden tub behind the bar, filled with steaming water. As they bathed her, you couldn&#39;t help but notice the change in Daisy&#39;s demeanor. She was no longer the gruff, older bartender, but a woman new to her own body, her eyes filled with wonder and confusion. Once Daisy was clean and dressed in fresh clothes, you took her hand, leading her to a quiet corner of the saloon. The place was nearly deserted now, the patrons having fled after the &#39;devilry&#39; they&#39;d witnessed. <br />
<br />
“I don’t know what happened to me but you have my gratitude stranger my name is Daisy I reckon don’t know rightly why...”<br />
<br />
“Daisy.” <br />
you began, looking into her piercing blue eyes “ I know this is all new to you. But I want you to know, I find you... fascinating. And I&#39;d like to get to know you better. Would you... would you like to be my girlfriend?”<br />
<br />
 Daisy looked at you, her brow furrowed in thought. Then, a small smile played on her lips. “Well, ain&#39;t that somethin&#39;? A girl like me, with a fella like you? I reckon I&#39;d like that just fine.”<br />
<br />
 Your devious heart swelled with a mix of triumph and affection. You leaned in, pressing your lips to hers in a soft, gentle kiss. When you pulled back, Daisy&#39;s cheeks were flushed, her eyes shining. But there was still work to be done. You turned to the oldest prostitute in the saloon, a woman named Madam Rose. She was a tall, imposing figure, her hair a cascade of silver curls. “Rose..”  you said, I need you to transform.<br />
<br />
“ I want you to become a butch, muscular French dominatrix. Rich as sin and running this saloon like the queen you are.”<br />
<br />
Rose looked at you, her eyes narrowing. Then, she threw back her head and laughed. Well, ain&#39;t that a kick in the pants? Alright, sugar, let&#39;s see what you&#39;ve got.”<br />
The transformation was slower this time, more controlled. As the final shimmer of transformation faded, Rose stood before you, a vision of power and allure. Her once-silver hair was now a raven cascade, cropped short and sharp around her face. Her eyes, a piercing ice-blue, held a fiery intensity that commanded attention. She wore a tailored suit, the deep red fabric hugging her muscular frame like a second skin. A silver chain linked to a leather collar around her neck, and a riding crop tapped against her thigh, emphasizing her newfound authority. You turned to Daisy, who looked at Rose with wide-eyed wonder. The transformation had taken its toll on her, leaving her vulnerable and confused. You took her hand, giving it a gentle squeeze. <br />
<br />
“It&#39;s alright, Daisy”<br />
 you murmured “I&#39;m here with you.”<br />
<br />
 Daisy looked at you, her blue eyes filled with fear and uncertainty. <br />
“I-I&#39;m scared” she admitted, her voice a soft southern drawl. “Where are we goin&#39;, darlin?”<br />
<br />
You gave her a reassuring smile, pulling her close. We&#39;re going to my room, Daisy. In my time. You held up the amulet, now glowing softly. This is how we&#39;re going to get there. Daisy looked at the amulet, her eyes widening. <br />
<br />
“That&#39;s... that&#39;s the one from before, ain&#39;t it? The one that made me... like this?”<br />
<br />
You nodded, pressing the amulet to your palm. A portal opened up before you, a swirling vortex of light and color. Daisy gasped, her hand tightening in yours. It&#39;s beautiful, she whispered. Leading Daisy through the portal was like stepping into a dream. The saloon faded away, replaced by the sterile, modern decor of your room. Daisy looked around, her eyes wide with wonder. <br />
<br />
“This place... it&#39;s like nothin&#39; I&#39;ve ever seen..”<br />
 she gasped and began to twitch as her eyes glazed over the amulet playing on your desires as it vanished back into your body.<br />
<br />
 As you watched, Daisy began to change. Her body shrank, her curves softening into the lithe form of a teenager. Her clothes warped and shifted, transforming into trendy outfits from Forever 21. Her hair long blonde hair falling in loose curls around her shoulders. She looked at you, her eyes filled with confusion and fear. “Wha-wh-What&#39;s happenin&#39; to me?” <br />
<br />
she asked, her voice now higher, more youthful. You cupped her face in your hands, looking into her eyes. It&#39;s okay, Daisy, you soothed. This is who you really are. A 17-year-old girl from Georgia. Your family moved here three years ago. Daisy&#39;s eyes filled with tears as the new memories surfaced.<br />
“ Mama... Papa... they made us leave our home...”<br />
<br />
 she whispered, her voice breaking. You pulled her into a hug, letting her cry into your chest. “It&#39;s okay, Daisy.” murmured.Daisy&#39;s body, now a youthful 17, is a vision of innocence and desire. Her skin is smooth and soft, like fresh cream, with a light dusting of freckles across her nose and cheeks. Her eyes, once filled with fear, now sparkle with curiosity and lust. Her breasts, though small, are pert and round, fitting perfectly in your large hands. Her nipples are hard, pressing against your palms as you rub her body. Her hips are narrow, flaring out into long, toned legs. Her hair cascades down her back in loose curls, the color of warm honey under the sunlight.<br />
<br />
As Daisy&#39;s breathing returned to normal, you cupped her face in your hands, looking into her eyes seizing the opportunity to acclimate her to you.<br />
“Daisy, it&#39;s okay” you soothed. “Remember, we met on the first day of school? In homeroom a few years back? I&#39;ve been here for you ever since.”<br />
<br />
She nodded, her eyes filling with trust. You leaned in, pressing your lips to hers in a soft, gentle kiss. She melted into you, her body molding against yours as you deepened the kiss. Your hands roamed her body, feeling the soft curves of her youthful form. You could feel her heart pounding in her chest as you reached up to cup her breasts, your thumbs brushing against her hard nipples. You guided her back onto the bed, breaking the kiss to trail your lips down her neck and across her collarbone. She gasped as you took one of her nipples into your mouth, sucking gently. Her hands tangled in your hair, holding you close as you lavished attention on her breasts. You could feel her hips moving beneath you, seeking friction as she grew more aroused. <br />
<br />
Suddenly, the door to your room burst open. Daisy squeaked in surprise, covering her naked body with a pillow as your mother, Stephanie, walked in. She barely glanced at the two of you, instead stumbling inebriated straight for the closet.<br />
<br />
“ Daisy, this is my mom, Stephanie”<br />
you said, sitting up and pulling on your shirt. Daisy blushed, awkwardly mumbling a hello. Stephanie turned to look at you, her eyes raking over Daisy&#39;s body. <br />
<br />
“Her body&#39;s not bad” she commented, her voice casual. <br />
<br />
Daisy blushed even harder, burying her face in the pillow. You chuckled, running a hand through your hair. <br />
“Stephanie, can Daisy stay the night?”<br />
you asked, using her first name like you always did. She looked at you, her eyes narrowing slightly. Of course, she said, a smirk playing at the corners of her mouth. <br />
<br />
“You get to do whatever you want now, remember?”<br />
 She turned back to the closet, pulling out a bottle of bourbon. <br />
<br />
“But if you&#39;re going to drink my liquor, you can do something for me in return kill that piece of shit I’m married to Derek and have Rachel become the successful single mother of you and Charlie, hic- like a lawyer or some shit.”<br />
<br />
You weren’t used to your mother being so blunt and you’ve really never seen her this drunk.. despite being three sheets to the wind Stephanie had a plan and was going to manipulate her hot dog son into getting what she wants.<br />
<br />
You stared at your mother, Stephanie, in disbelief. <br />
<br />
“Kill Dad? And make Rachel...?”<br />
<br />
 You couldn&#39;t even finish the sentence. Stephanie just looked at you, her eyes cold and hard. <br />
“He&#39;s super abusive, and he&#39;s been cheating on me for years. I&#39;m done with it. And Rachel... she&#39;s always been too mature for her age. She&#39;ll make a great mother.”<br />
<br />
She paused, then added, “And I want to be young again. I want to party, to have fun. I don&#39;t want to be tied down anymore.”<br />
<br />
She felt your brain subconsciously giving her what she wanted and tingling began to strip off her clothes, her body starting to change as she did so. Her pot belly shrank, her breasts grew firmer and fuller, her graying hair turned a vibrant blonde. She was transforming, regressing in age, and it was happening right before your eyes.<br />
<br />
“ And Daisy”<br />
she said in younger melodic tone, glancing over at your girlfriend who was watching the scene unfold in shock. <br />
<br />
“She&#39;s a sweet girl. I think she&#39;d make a great addition to our little... family.”<br />
<br />
 Stephanie continued to grow younger becoming a curvy 16 year old girl who looked like a mix of German and Baltic and bit her lip, her eyes gleaming with lust as she looked at you. <br />
<br />
“You can have me when I&#39;m like this, you know. Not related to you anymore. And Daisy... well, I&#39;m sure she&#39;d be up for a little fun too.”<br />
<br />
 You felt a surge of arousal at the thought, despite the shocking nature of the conversation Stephanie had played you like a fiddle and was rapidly forgetting the tools that she employed being your mother as reality reknit itself and she continued to enjoy her young nubile body. Stephanie noticed, a smirk playing at the corners of her mouth as she began to rub her unshaven pussy. <br />
<br />
“See something you like?” she purred. Daisy looked at you, confusion and betrayal in her eyes. “What&#39;s going on?”<br />
<br />
 she asked, her voice barely above a whisper. You didn&#39;t have an answer for her. You were still trying to process it all yourself, you were struggling to understand what triggered everything, you wanted this right. Surely this was all intentional at least subconsciously. <br />
<br />
You felt a surge of panic as Stephanie&#39;s hands began to roam over Daisy&#39;s body, her fingers finding their way to Daisy&#39;s clit. Daisy&#39;s eyes rolled back, her breath hitching as Stephanie started to rub her in slow, deliberate circles. You watched in horror as Daisy&#39;s personality seemed to shift right before your eyes. <br />
<br />
The innocent Georgia peach you knew was gone, replaced by a hardened southern sex connoisseur. Daisy looked back at Stephanie, a seductive grin spreading across her face. <br />
“Thanks for lettin&#39; the bestie in on this threesome, lover boy.”<br />
<br />
As Daisy spoke she drawled, her voice suddenly gruff and confident. Stephanie just smirked, not taking her eyes off of Daisy as she continued to rub her. Daisy, meanwhile, reached out and grabbed you, pulling you into their naked bodies. You felt Stephanie&#39;s warmth envelop you as Daisy pressed herself against your back, her tongue snaking out to lick a trail up your spine. You gasped at the sudden contact, your mind struggling to keep up with the rapid changes in your life. Stephanie guided you into her, her hips bucking to meet yours as Daisy began to work her tongue in your butt. You felt a surge of pleasure unlike anything you&#39;d ever experienced, your body responding to the dual stimulation. You tried to hold back, to maintain some semblance of control, but it was no use. Stephanie and Daisy were in charge now, and they were determined to have their way with you. You could feel your body tensing, your orgasm building as Stephanie and Daisy continued to work in tandem. They were relentless, their touches expert and precise, driving you closer and closer to the edge. You tried to hold back, to make it last, but it was no use. With a final thrust, you came undone, your body convulsing as you released into Stephanie. As you came down from your high, you looked at the two women who had just changed your life forever. Stephanie was still smirking, her eyes gleaming with lust and satisfaction. Daisy was grinning too, her tongue licking her lips as she looked at you.<br />
<br />
“ That was just the beginning, lover boy..” she said, her voice still gruff and confident.<br />
“We&#39;re gonna have so much fun together.”</p>
