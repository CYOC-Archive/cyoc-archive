<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Yawning tiredly, you adjusted the armor over your torso. While not hindering in anyway, your drastic change in physique has lead you to feeling slightly uncomfortable while you walked to the main gate of Tel’Adre.<br />
<br />
‘I wish I didn&#39;t have to walk through that desert again but it&#39;s my only way back to the wasteland I reached it from. Even still though, I would rather be at camp and starting from their.’<br />
<br />
Suddenly a wave of dizziness washed over you and caused you to close your eyes so as to not hurl the light breakfast you had. When, next, you opened your eyes you found yourself back in the campsite of the demonic wasteland instead of the sprawling city of Tel’Adre.<br />
<br />
You knew that magic was possible so the current shift in your location didn&#39;t phase you but you still couldn&#39;t keep the total surprise out of your face. Once you finally collected yourself, you realized the full implication of what your teleporting could mean. Not seeing anything wrong with your current location, you set to work by taking down and setting up the old and new campsite. Once done, a brand new tent was standing tall with all of your current belongings inside. All that was left was to clear away the trash inside.<br />
<br />
Grabbing an old bucket you found, you set to work on filling it with the rotten pieces of wood and dumping them in the fire pit. While working on an extremely large pile of the rotten wooden, you found a new chest you hadn&#39;t before though this one was in much better condition as the iron lock was nowhere near rusted. Not sure if the key was still around or intact you decided to wait anyway and finish cleaning. In the end, no key was found.<br />
<br />
“So I have a lock without a key, guess I&#39;ll have to break it open.”<br />
<br />
Gripping the edges of your shield, you set to work again. Finally, after close to an hour of banging, the lock broke. Inside were multiple syringes with green liquid inside them and the words “GRO+” on the side. Not wanting to even think about what that could mean for a user, you closed the chest and set it aside.<br />
<br />
“I’ve got a tent, food, and water for a few days as well as instruments for hunting if I need now all i need to do is figure out where to hunt.”<br />
<br />
Grabbing your bow and arrows as well as your sword and shield, you set off to find wildlife to hunt.<br />
<br />
It was around noon when you finally came across the entrance to a forest. Knowing that it could be dangerous to enter, you knocked an arrow and began your exploration. Over time, you would hear rustling from the trees but, each time you looked, nothing was there. After hours of searching you started to hear the sounds of a rushing river. Both curious and cautious, you kept your arrow knocked and slowly made your way up using the trees as cover. Finally reaching the clearing of the river, you saw that it was empty save for a single imp drinking water.<br />
<br />
Before you could even draw your arrow back though, a large amount of force crashed on the backside of your head. Unconsciousness consumed you in a matter of moments. When you finally woke up from your forced sleep, you found yourself in what appeared to be a large cave with 3 imps, identical to the one you first saw gathered over a chest that was taller than they were. Attempting to get up, you found that you were bound to walls by ropes around your wrists and completely naked except for you gauntlets and boots.<br />
<br />
Now noticing that you were awake, the 3 imps became much more vocal from their previous hushed whispers.<br />
<br />
“See, I told you he would wake up soon so that means We’re doing it my way.”<br />
<br />
The sudden boast of his rightness caused the other 2 imps to pout whilst you were simply confused on what he meant.<br />
<br />
“You 2 can gather the items while I converse with our new guest.”<br />
<br />
Grumbling, the 2 imps obeyed and went back to the chest while the apparent leader walked towards you with a skip in his short steps.<br />
<br />
“Good morning sleeping beauty. If you&#39;re wondering where you are then just stop because, in a couple of moments, you won’t be fit to think of anything except sex when we 3 are done with you.”<br />
<br />
Not one to swing the other way by forceful or consensual means, you started struggling with even harder with your bonds.<br />
<br />
“Oh don’t be like that you&#39;ll love what we do first but after that we have no idea before we break you in.”<br />
<br />
“Here’s the stupid items you wanted…”<br />
<br />
It was one of the other imps who spoke and he and his partner were carrying a large tray filled with bottles with of unknown origin. The leader grabbed the bottle on the tray as the second imp continued.<br />
<br />
“... I still don’t see why we have to waste all the potions just to use the liquor in the end.”<br />
<br />
“If I explained it once, I explained it a thousand times. Only using the liquor is well and good with some people but if you really want to break them and make them yours then you need to take what they value most and make them see the potential for it before taking it away completely especially with guys otherwise they may still fight even if they are dumb and that is too much of a hassle.”<br />
<br />
The second imp tried to speak again but the leader shushed before turning back to me.<br />
<br />
“Now, my dear guest, it should be quite obvious what you hold most so you best well enjoy it while you can.”<br />
<br />
Before anything happened though, the 3rd and final imp who hadn’t spoken, started to leave and the leader noticed.<br />
<br />
“chickening out again?”<br />
<br />
“No, I just have standards on what I have sex with and if they don&#39;t have a vagina then I don’t have sex.”<br />
<br />
“Suit yourself but make sure to come back in an hour so we all can have some fun.”<br />
<br />
And with that, one imp left, one imp flew towards my face to pour the potions contents down my throat and the final imp was standing around bored.<br />
<br />
Now at eye level with you, the leader imp made a strange gesture at you with his hands. Anxious of what the gesture meant, you soon found yourself flooded with lust and your penis reached full mast.<br />
<br />
“Pretty good for a human if what I know is right but it’ll be much better.”<br />
<br />
To disoriented with lust, you couldn&#39;t stop the imp from pouring the contents down your throat before quickly getting another one and another after that. After pouring 5 potions down your throat, the imp leader stopped and landed next to his partner. Even in your lust filled mind you could see and feel the changes coming over you.<br />
<br />
The first was your muscles, even with your sudden increase the other day, you still kept you slim and toned figure but now you were the opposite of the word slim. Pound after pound of muscle grew on your body, causing your body to widen. Your shoulder became broader as the extended apart and your specs inflated like balloons until you couldn&#39;t see your feet. Your and gained so much mass they looked like bricks made of flesh. Your calves widened as well till they were touching each other and even made your legs move apart. With the addition of muscle also came an increase to your height until you were 6’5”. Over a foot of height gained in an instant. <br />
<br />
Finally came your dick and balls. Your balls went first this time and quickly grew till they were the size of baseballs. After your balls was your dick, first it doubled in girth till it was 4 inches wide, finally came the length, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24. Your dick was now 2 feet long and it wanted to release every bit of cum that your balls were now producing.<br />
<br />
“Marvellous isn’t it, to think that…”<br />
<br />
The imp didn&#39;t get to finish his sentence though as you used your new found strength to rip out of your bonds and crushed both his and his partners skull with your still gloved. The final imp heard your roars of lust and came running back before hightailing it out of there and into the jungle.<br />
<br />
Still high on lust and with nothing to do, you knocked over the tray filled with potions and caused many of them to spill and break but many stayed together. Finally losing yourself to the lust, your body worked on instinct alone and it grabbed every unbroken bottle on the floor before pouring it in his mouth. The changes that occurred were so intense and so numerous now that your body ejected the one thing that continued to be the problem. Your cum, and when it finally released, it coated all the walls in cum before you passed out. When you finally woke up hours later, your body was much more different than you thought possible.</p>
