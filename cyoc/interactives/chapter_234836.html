<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;How about let&#39;s just chill inside? I&#39;m getting a little tired.&quot; Charlie continued.<br />
<br />
He could&#39;ve sworn Brady&#39;s face lit up when he heard that before walking pass him to run to the door and hold it open. Charlie by now has been blushing hard. The younger teen wearing ill-filling clothes, holding the door open for him.<br />
<br />
&quot;C&#39;mon, bud.&quot; Brady moved his head, signaling him to come in.<br />
<br />
As soon as Charlie went in, he felt the athmosphere in the house change. Without their knowledge, reality is slowly changing in every second.<br />
<br />
Toys getting replaced as Brady matured. Gone with the childish toys, replaced with a few collectible action figures. Some from his childhood remained, but are mostly left forgotten as they get stored to the back of the house. His collection of video games piled up by the television. Brady remember some of those bought my himself with money he saved up, some are gift by his older sist...<br />
<br />
Older sister? Yeah... That&#39;s right. There is no way Liana is his mom. Where did that thought even came from?<br />
<br />
Brady closed the door, took his shoes and socks off, and rushed to the kitchen as Charlie sat on the sofa. He came back to the living room with a pitcher of water and a glass for Charlie.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, you don&#39;t have to-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And leave my best bud have a heat stroke? No fucking way.&quot; Brady chuckled and rushed back to the kitchen.<br />
<br />
Charlie looked back behind the sofa and stared at Brady, watching his friend doing all the things he had to so to take care of him. Just thinking about it makes him wanna let him know how much he appreciates him. Deep inside, he knows he wanted to more than that. He wanted to hug him so tight.<br />
<br />
Brady continued, getting some stuff from the fridge and disappearing from Charlie&#39;s view as he gets blocked by the refrigirator door. Stumbling a little, he gave a loud &quot;woops!&quot;, by then his voice sounded much deeper, somehow even huskier.<br />
<br />
&quot;Got it.&quot; Brady said as he closed the fridge.<br />
<br />
Charlie&#39;s eyes widened when he saw Brady once more. He had now grown his age of 18. Clothes changed to finally fit his growig body, now wearing a tight white tanktop that showed the slowly defining muscles on his chest. His shorts, although remained the length half his thigh, turned into a much breathable material. Charlie noticed it somewhat thight enough to show his buldge. The hair on his arms and legs starting to darken a bit to a much toned down color of blonde. He noticed Brady stared back at him with a smile, immediately Charlie turned around in embarrasment.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why am I starting that hard on him? What.... What is this feeling? Am I...&quot; Charlie covered his face.<br />
<br />
While Charlie sinka into his own internal debate, Brady made sure to fix a proper snack for the both of them. A good healthy snack that Charlie would enjoy, but also help him grow stronger. &quot;He needs to be stronger to keep Charlie safe&quot; Brady thought as he cracked eggs onto a bowl.<br />
<br />
As he wisks the egg, his arms started to get bigger. The growth moving to his shoulder, back, and soon his whole torso had grown lean muscles. Once done, he moved to the stove. With each step, his legs grew muscles. Calves shaping like stone, but also remaining somewhat soft. He crotched down to grab a pan underneath the drawers, making his butt plump a little. He got up and placed the pan onto the stone to heat up.<br />
<br />
While the pan was heating up, he placed a few loaf of bread in the toaster. And while that&#39;s happening, he finally started cooking the egg. He prepared at least 3 toasts for each of them. The cooked scrambled egg was then sliced like a pizza so they can still share. equally. On every loaf, he placed eggs, some cheese, with a bit of salt, pepper and dried parsley for style.<br />
<br />
Charlie listened as Brady finished up. He felt heavy footsteps get closer to the living room as Brady bring the food to the coffee table. Charlie looked up to Brady and finally get to see what the teen had become.<br />
<br />
Through the course of a few minutes of Brady cooking, he grew up to the age of 20. Finally out of his teenage years. Brady looked like he spent his time well in the gym. Well, why wouldn&#39;t he if his motivation is to keep Charlie safe. Brady has now a short stubble for his beard, kept well shaved.<br />
<br />
Charlie stared at him as if its the most unnatural thing to see him like this, but those feelings changed when he saw Brady smile at him once more.<br />
<br />
&quot;Enjoy&quot; Brady said as he sat beaside him, his arm placed over his friend&#39;s shoulders.<br />
<br />
Charlie by now had been blushing so hard, its obvious in his ears, all red. Bardy chuckled and grabbed a piece, putting it up just by his mouth.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on, at least one bit, buddy.&quot; Brady smiled.<br />
<br />
Charlie took a quick chomp at it, giving a very eccentric energy as he think about the food. Brady made it for him.<br />
<br />
As he chew, he stared at the toast as Brady placed it back to the plate. He felt Brady&#39;s hand hold him on his chin, moving his view to his face. With a aoft delicate touch, he wiped the crumbs off Charlie&#39;s lips.<br />
<br />
Charlie&#39;s lips are so soft, he thought. It&#39;s like, he want to feel it more.<br />
<br />
The two of them stared at each other. A tension building up between the two.<br />
<br />
Charlie wasn&#39;t just here to babysit anymore, nor hang out with a friend. He&#39;s here for a very special reason.<br />
<br />
Charlie&#39;s eyes widened as he felt Braden&#39;s lips touch his, but that quick kiss elevated into something more. Charlie kissed back, and soon they were making out.<br />
<br />
He couldnt control his feelings for Braden anymore. Neither do Braden.<br />
<br />
Charlie placed a hand on Braden&#39;s thigh and Braden responded with a groan. Charlie moved on top of Braden, stradling him on the sofa. They kept kissing, until Charlie felt Braden&#39;s hard cock.<br />
<br />
&quot;I...I-&quot; Braden stuttered, shy about how much Charlie made him hard.<br />
<br />
Charlie smiled, and continued kissing him.</p>
