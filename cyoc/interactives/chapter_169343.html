<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>I&#39;ve added Greg returning to the apartment to the &quot;Larry Wants Answers&quot; branch from the previous chapter since this is more of a concurrent side story.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After writing that short snippet in the book Greg was eager to get home and masturbate furiously.<br />
<br />
As he waited for the bus he had a strange feeling in his nether regions. Reaching down to adjust himself, something felt off. He couldn&#39;t feel his penis. In a panic he looked around to make sure no one was watching and pulled open the front of his pants to find his dick was completely hidden from view. Greg reached down and felt an small indent where his cock should be and a rush of pleasure before a hard half inch nub emerged. Had what he&#39;d written in the book had come true? That would explain why Jason was so obsessed with it.<br />
<br />
He took out his phone and looked through his porn files. Everyone&#39;s dicks had all either jumped up in size considerably or shrank down to barely anything. Oddly enough the video he had of Jason remained unchanged though.<br />
<br />
Just then the bus arrived. Greg gawked at a man in a construction uniform with an obvious bulge stepped off. As Greg cautiously stepped on the bus, he looked at all the passengers, unsure what awaited him. The bus was fairly packed but only one person was standing. He wondered how many of these men now had gigantic 10 inch+ cocks and which ones had little micro-weenies.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hurry it up!&quot; the bus driver yelled at him. Greg jumped and quickly paid his fair mumbling an apology as he sneaked a peak at the lump snaking down the side of the driver&#39;s shorts.<br />
<br />
He heard the doors shut behind him sealing him in this metal cage of horny big dick animals. Greg was excited with the prospect of this world at first but now that he was living it he was extremely nervous about getting found out and just wanted to get home and start jerking his new itty bitty dick. Thank god he was wearing baggy pants.<br />
<br />
As the bus began rumbling along he made his way down the aisle. All of the seats were taken, except the center seat in the back row. There was a man in a suit standing near it and Greg could see the hint of a big dick down his pinstripe trousers.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you want that seat?&quot; Greg asked, worried if he took a seat from a big dick that he might get harassed for it.<br />
<br />
&quot;W-what? N-no!&quot; The man in the suit turned white and stuttered nervously as though he&#39;d just been caught in some kind of lie. Greg was somewhat disappointed having expected every big dick to have a dominant personality. Suddenly the man&#39;s demeanor changed and it sounded like he was putting on a deeper voice &quot;I mean, no thanks little guy. It&#39;s all yours.&quot; <br />
<br />
Shrugging his shoulders Greg sat down and began looking around wondering if anything else in the world had changed. Then he noticed the guy next to him had a lewd smile. Greg looked down and noticed his fellow passenger was wearing baggy pants so he couldn&#39;t see the size of his dick either.<br />
<br />
&quot;You seem pretty eager.&quot; The man commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh what do you mean?&quot; Greg asked as the bus slowed down to pick up more passengers.<br />
<br />
&quot;You from out of town or something?&quot; The man asked &quot;Not a lot of guys take that seat since it&#39;s the only one passengers can stand in front of, and puts your eye-line at perfect height for-&quot;<br />
<br />
The passenger was interrupted by the sounds of thudding footsteps. Greg could feel a strong presence looming over him. He turned around to see a massive bulge right before his eyes. Looking up, he saw a new passenger had chosen to stand right in front of him, looking down menacingly.<br />
<br />
Greg gulped. &quot;Umm do you want this seat?&quot;<br />
<br />
The man chuckled, &quot;No, you stay right where you are.&quot;<br />
<br />
Greg peered around him and saw a eight new passengers had formed a queue behind him. One of them was chatting with the guy Greg had spoken to before sitting down.<br />
<br />
Greg looked at the passenger beside him for support but now the guy had and hand in his pocket and was subtly rubbing where the base of his cock would be as he watched the confrontation. Greg didn&#39;t know what to do. This was one of his wildest fantasies but at the same time he felt extremely hesitant, when suddenly he heard his ringtone chime off.<br />
<br />
He quickly fumbled for his phone and answered but could still feel the mans eyes boring into the absence of manhood between his legs.<br />
<br />
Before he could say anything Jason&#39;s voice began yelling at him.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the fuck did you do to the book!?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Quiet down,&quot; Greg whispered, looking around. He didn&#39;t want to draw attention to himself lest he be ousted as having a tiny penis, &quot;I&#39;m on the bus.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t care!&quot; Jason kept shouting, &quot;Tell me where you are, I&#39;m coming to get you. You need to give it back.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How did you even get my number?&quot; Greg asked stalling for time, Thinking maybe he could play dumb.<br />
<br />
&quot;I got it from Larry, by doing him a favor I am NOT going to repeat to you. I noticed you took it and I went out to the hall to look for you, but one look from Larry and I– fuck...&quot;<br />
<br />
The mental image of Larry&#39;s cock made Greg release a dribble of precum in his underwear. But if Larry was still in the 99th percentile and the average was 10 to 15 inches now then that means Larry would be even bigger than before. Greg&#39;s imagination ran wild with the things Larry would do with that thing.<br />
<br />
&quot;What did you do? How big is Larry&#39;s dick now?&quot; Greg whispered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hang on. What do you mean *now*?&quot;<br />
<br />
Oh shit...<br />
<br />
&quot;Uhh nothing I just-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You fucking know!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ummm know what?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You know you wrote something in the book and gave everyone massive cocks and made them all horny bastards.&quot;<br />
<br />
Looked like the gig was up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well not *everyone*, twenty five percent of men have tiny dicks&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dammit Greg. I don&#39;t want to live in your perverted small penis humiliation fantasy world,&quot; Jason responded. &quot;At least not as a small-dick. I want my book back.&quot;<br />
<br />
Greg sighed, if he had to give the book back he might as well enjoy the fantasy before it all went away again. He peered around the guy standing in front of him and it looked like some of the other passengers had stood up to join the queue.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay okay, Let me just finish sucking off the cocks on this bus&quot; as he said this, Greg heard the guy sitting next to him quietly moan, &quot;and I&#39;ll-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;NOW!&quot;<br />
<br />
Damn what a nag.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, sorry. I&#39;ll catch the next bus back over.&quot; Greg conceded, &quot;Do you want me to change back what I wrote?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;NO! Don&#39;t write anything else! We have to be careful or something else might get fucked up! Just get back here with my book!&quot; Jason said before hanging up. Greg put his phone away and took one last longing look at the crotch of the hung business man in front of him before standing up and signaling for the bus to stop.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aww come on!&quot; He heard the guy who had been sitting next to him shout with frustration. Looking over Greg saw the seated passenger had a panicked expression after unintentionally drawing attention to himself. The passenger looked like he was still pleasuring himself through his pocket.<br />
<br />
Greg wasn&#39;t the only one who noticed. The man who had been standing in front of him smiled wickedly &quot;What&#39;s going on down there?&quot; he asked pointing at the oddly positioned hand in the seated passenger&#39;s pocket.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh shit, Nothing!&quot; the passenger tried to pretend he hadn&#39;t just been masturbating.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, I think &#39;nothing&#39; is right.&quot; the big-dick-man responded causing the tiny-dick passenger to let a squeak escape his throat.<br />
<br />
Greg pushed his way past before he got any more drawn into the scene.<br />
<br />
As he made his way to the front of the bus Greg could feel his hand grazing across multiple massive bulges of the standing passengers. And multiple hands grazed across his, each time met with a wry smile or an off the cuff comment.<br />
<br />
&quot;Where you running off to? They got a sale on extra small condoms?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Didn&#39;t know the bus still used stubs.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks for the offer but I don&#39;t need a tic tac&quot;<br />
<br />
Each one made Greg&#39;s dick twitch with pleasure and his face blush. But Greg forced his way through. Halfway down the bus he passed the man who he had offered the seat to earlier.<br />
<br />
&quot;C&#39;mon join the line, you really need to let off some stress Ed.&quot; the man&#39;s friend insisted. &quot;I can see your fucking horny all the time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;N-no thanks Dirk.&quot; the passenger&#39;s nervous voice was back. &quot;I don&#39;t really wanna-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Geeze Ed, what are you so afraid of? Unless-&quot; the bus came to a sudden halt and the man tumbled forward and grabbing onto Ed&#39;s pants and yanking them down to his knees. At that moment a giant phallus popped sprung up in front of Ed&#39;s groin. It&#39;s immense size wouldn&#39;t have looked out of place in this world... if only this phallus wasn&#39;t a bright purple strap on.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well looks like you&#39;ve been lying to us this whole time Eddie&quot; Dirk said pulling the strap on forward to reveal the hard leaking one inch dick underneath. Many of the men on the bus had noticed this confrontation and were laughing and making jokes as Eddie failed to pull his pants back up. More began to stand up and approach which created a barrier of men Greg had to squeeze past. He almost made it to the front of the bus before suddenly being sandwiched between two large gentlemen with their massive erections prodding into his sides.<br />
<br />
As Greg struggled to get past them the bus driver stood up and turned to look at all the commotion.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the hell is going on back there?&quot;<br />
<br />
That was when Greg finally managed to pop free of the two behemoths trapping him and fell face first into the bus driver&#39;s crotch. Greg&#39;s face was close enough to smell the musk of his sweaty balls. He could see the head peeking out the bottom of his shorts. Fighting the urge to stick out his tongue and lick the tip right then and there, Greg scrambled out the door before the bus driver could give him an order that would make him too horny to leave.<br />
<br />
As Greg ran past the bus he saw Eddie with his face pressed against the window in with an expression either of extreme pain or pleasure. He could also hear the sounds of gagging coming from the open back window of the bus.<br />
<br />
Greg ran as fast as he could towards Jason&#39;s apartment.</p>
