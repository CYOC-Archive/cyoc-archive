<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Michelle smiled. “Normally, I go elsewhere..meet up with my pack and have fun..but, it&#39;s already getting late. No need to have you losing control at an inconvenient point. Plus,” she added, smiling mischievously, “I want your wolf cock all to myself tonight.”<br />
<br />
“You have a pack?” I asked, somewhat surprised. I suppose I shouldn&#39;t have been, in the grand scheme of things. She was a werewolf, and so logically, there would be others. I just didn&#39;t expect the universe to adjust to my wishes without explicitly being asked. There was also the concern about other male werewolves, who were now my competition.<br />
<br />
She nodded and giggled softly. “Oh yeah, hon. Me and some girlfriends all wolf out together at least three nights a month.”<br />
<br />
“At least three nights?” I asked. “So they all..trigger, like you?”<br />
<br />
Again, she nodded. “All werewolves have a trigger that makes them change even outside of the full moon&#39;s light. Most of us like to have some fun on the side, even when we&#39;re not forced to change by the moon...so it&#39;s probably like every few days at least a couple of us get together and get our change on.”<br />
<br />
“Is it always doggy style fucking?” I asked, trying to avoid getting too hard as I thought about Michelle having transformative lesbian werewolf sex.<br />
<br />
She glanced at my cock and smirked. “Are you asking for details?” One eyebrow cocked up slightly, and her hand rested on my thigh. She nuzzled my neck as she leaned in, exhaling a breathy sigh into my ear. “Do you want me to tell you about what makes their bodies change?” My cock went rock hard at her blatant teasing, and she slid her hand around my length. I nodded and mumbled out an affirmative grunt as I nuzzled her back.<br />
<br />
She pulled away, smirking again, clearly enjoying teasing me. “It&#39;s not all doggystyle fucking. That&#39;s just my trigger, though usually the trigger is somehow related to either the first change, or the way you got turned. It&#39;s a psychological hook, I think would be the best way to put it.”<br />
<br />
“For a long time, I was the only werewolf I knew, and I did what I could to avoid exposing others. But the older I got, the more I enjoyed the full moon nights, and the more I became aware of how acutely lonely I was. Humans are social creatures, and wolves are pack animals. We need companionship. In hindsight, I realize it was inevitable that one day, I&#39;d end up turning someone.<br />
<br />
I was working at a restaurant, and had become friends with a couple other girls there; they&#39;re both a bit bigger, like me, and we bonded while being catty about a couple of the more attractive servers. We started hanging out a lot outside of work, and they let me in on a secret-that they were lesbian lovers on the side, though they kept it quiet. Of course, once I was in on the secret, they started being a lot more affectionate with each other when we hung out. A lot of the time, it felt like they were doing it for my benefit, no less. Up til that point, I&#39;d never been with a woman, and the thought hadn&#39;t even really crossed my mind. When they found that out, they started hinting around at the idea of the three of us getting into bed together. What I didn&#39;t expect is how wet that got me,” she said, pausing and teasing at one of her nipples absentmindedly.<br />
<br />
“I couldn&#39;t get the thought out of my mind. It was probably a month solid that every night I went home, I was cumming all over my fingers while thinking about them together, or with me. I even started masturbating myself on all fours, so I could change while I fantasized. That&#39;s when I realized that the wolf had chosen them. I stopped wearing panties when I was around them...we exude pheromones, you see..and it causes essentially &#39;animal magnetism&#39; to happen..humans and other werewolves..they get attracted, or more attracted, depending...” she slid a hand between her legs, moaning softly as she played with her clit, then pulled her hand away, sliding her fingers up to my face and under my nose. I responded with a soft growl and playful nip at them. She smiled again, and I was acutely aware of the sweet smell of musk, and how horny I was getting. As I made a move toward her, wanting closer contact, she gently pushed me away. “Patience, darling..the moon isn&#39;t quite up, and you wanted this story..”<br />
<br />
She continued, though she was obviously as aroused as I was. It was almost torture to resist pouncing on her and having my way again. “I struggled with how badly I wanted them, and how badly I wanted to turn them. Even so, I couldn&#39;t help myself. Constantly being exposed to the pheromones made them more openly hungry for me, and I couldn&#39;t help but flirt back.  I knew I could minimize the effect if I just wore panties, but the wolf inside wouldn&#39;t let me. Things got more intense one night after work. Jenny is the more dominant of the two of them, and is the only girl I know with bigger tits than me. She and I were closing; Meg was off that night. After work, we went out for drinks. One turned into two..turned into three..turned into four. And the flirting just got harder and harder. I kept getting wetter and wetter, until finally, she grabs me by the hand and demands I join her in the bathroom. Thankfully, it was one of those smaller ones, where you can lock the door so nobody can get in. She immediately pins me to the wall and hikes my skirt up, then absolutely tongue fucked me until I collapsed.  I bit my lip to keep from screaming in pleasure and came all over her face. That&#39;s when I knew that the wolf absolutely wanted those girls. The only reason I didn&#39;t self-trigger a change was because of where we were.”  One hand went to her crotch, while the other teased a nipple. “Mmmhh...” she moaned, glancing past my shoulder and to the darkening sky outside of the window, “Moonrise is soon..I can&#39;t wait to hear your howl..”<br />
<br />
I was aware of a hum inside of my head, and a mild static tingle running through me. I was more acutely aware of her scent, and of my own growing needs. “I feel..weird,” I told her.<br />
<br />
“Your body&#39;s already undergoing the tiniest of changes. Your metabolism is starting to speed up, and your glands are starting to produce whatever precisely enables the transformation. We call the sensation moon heat,” she said, licking her wet fingers. “It&#39;s tempting to give in when we feel it, but holding off..waiting for the moon to force us into our beast shape..makes things so much more intense.”<br />
<br />
“So..did your cum make Jenny a werewolf?” I asked.<br />
<br />
Melissa shook her head. “No...I mean, yes..it did. Just not that night. Our cum is infectious, but only once we&#39;ve started to change. I could have turned you by sitting on your face, but since I was dripping with your seed already, I didn&#39;t think you&#39;d want it that way.”<br />
<br />
I laughed. “You&#39;re quite correct,” I told her. <br />
<br />
“Still, even if we stay human, when a human ends up tasting our cum, it has a psychological effect. It&#39;s not quite an addiction, but it makes them more...susceptible and attracted to us. Kind of like a vampire feeding someone their blood,” she explained.<br />
<br />
“Vampires are real??” I blurted out.<br />
<br />
“Of course,” she said. “Like us, they tend to be a bit more..hidden, but they&#39;re real. Are you really surprised? In a world with werewolves, vampires are kind of a given, wouldn&#39;t you think?” I realized this again had been the ring correcting for my wish. I&#39;d made a world where the supernatural was possible, so all supernatural things were possible, and at least in the case of vampires, real. I knew I could unwish them, but didn&#39;t feel like breaking the moment by doing so. <br />
<br />
“I guess not,” I said with a soft chuckle. “So..finish the story..” I was instantly hard again, wanting to hear more of her escapades, and the formation of her pack.<br />
<br />
Another smirk was her response before continuing. She licked her lips, giving me a hungry and flirtatious look. “Even after that, I still was struggling with the idea of turning them, even as I fantasized more vividly, now that I knew how Jenny&#39;s tongue would feel on my pussy. I knew there was every danger I would chicken out, unless I gave myself no choice in the matter. The wolf had to be stronger than every human impulse I had. The full moon was a week away, and so I deprived myself of eating any meat at all, so the wolf would be ravenous when it emerged, and override my humanity. Every night, I self-triggered my change, deliberately thinking about them and how they would look as they transformed, bonding the wolf completely to the idea and lowering my own psychological barriers against it.”<br />
<br />
 Melissa splayed her legs apart and began to play more deliberately with herself, flooding the room with her scent. Sweat had begun to bead on her forehead as she stared not at me, but out the window. “Not..not long now,” she said, and I was aware that while the room was completely dark, I wasn&#39;t having an issue seeing fine detail. “Your eyes...” her fingers moved more quickly as she took several shallow, gasping breaths, “They&#39;re..starting to..mmmmhh..fuck...starting to shine...” I saw a reciprocal glimmer in her own, and knew that things were about to happen. I could hear my heartbeat, and was aware of the static feeling growing even stronger. My dick waved madly, bobbing up and down as my muscles flexed and twitched in anticipation of the release of the change.<br />
<br />
“Finish..finish the story..” I said, watching as she played with herself, unable to keep myself from grabbing my dick and giving it a stroke.<br />
<br />
“The upside to being a bigger girl is that you usually have weekend nights off, because they want the pretty girls working busy nights. And the first night of the full moon fell on a Friday, so we all were off. We made plans, officially to just &#39;hang out&#39;..” she said, pulling her hands off of herself long enough to do air quotes, before almost immediately returning to running her fingers down every inch of her body. “But we knew what we all wanted. I was nervous still, so I waited until around an hour before moonrise, so I&#39;d already be under the influence of the moon heat when I got there. We had a couple of drinks, all while exchanging kisses and getting more and more fired up. As the moon rose, we&#39;d just gotten to the bedroom. They were so overcome by pheromones and their own lust that I think I could probably have shifted fully, and they still would have wanted me, but it didn&#39;t come to that. My muzzle was already stretching as I went down on Meg, and my pussy was covered in fur as  I straddled Jenny&#39;s face. Jenny was turned by my drenching pussy juice, and Meg..”..she paused, gasping again as her fingers worked harder again, and I heard a few soft popping noises as her jaw began to thicken, and her ears grew longer. I was burning up with heat now, and my heartbeat completely hammered in my ears.<br />
<br />
“I..bit...her inner thigh as she came..” a deep bass growl interrupted her speech again, and her teeth grew sharper. Her voice was rougher as she finished speaking. “And the next night, we changed as a pack. Now it&#39;s your turn...join me in the shift..”</p>
