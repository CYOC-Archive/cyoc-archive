<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mark was about to rush towards the sorority girls but he was halted at the last second by a sight which resonated so much more with his new mindset. Sure, the sorority girls seemed like a more than fine options, however the remnants of his human mind told him that if these young women looked like maenads, they were in fact so tacky, flaky and uninteresting that the veneer of ancient appeal rubbed away very cheaply. Their costumes, all being bunny girls, were proof of that. Excellent on the outside or the moment but not the most alluring for a satyr. Easy and fun to have intercourse with, yet a lot cheaper and banal than true maenads or nymphs. Satyrs had more authentic tastes and Mar&#39;k new desires were removed from the girls of party sororities which he had dreamed about since high school. And precisely, as he was about to fall back on what he cared less for, well, he saw a nymph. A true nymph, or rather what would come as close in these parts. A young college student, in a long-sleeved blouse and long petticoat, clutching books and a bag, was going back towards the usual dorms, darting between the trees and obviously uninterested in the partying around her. The wind and her movements made the fabric of her clothes hug her curves and she had what was required and where. The sorority bunny girl sisters bared everything and left very little to the imagination, where the hiding of her little secrets and treasures gave the nymph more reasons to be enthralled by her. And these little flat shoes making her dart between the trees! Utterly enchanting! Not seeing exactly what she was under her clothes made her intriguing and thrilled Mark to discover what was concealed so demurely. And her wavy hair and round face, as well as her full lips, were just as mesmerizing. Twitching and throbbing, his erection demanded immediate attention and to know the nymph in a more... profound way...  <br />
<br />
She started when he showed himself and she first assumed he had lost his way from the party, albeit with a quite impressive costume. However, the erect penis was a bit too much and revealing of the crass vulgarity of frat boys, indeed employing mythological characters without any cultural interest or context. But then that lout had grabbed her, dragged her through the woods and pinned her to the ground. He had bleated and kissed her ferociously. His manhood pressed against her thigh and it bulged tremendously, demanding attention and its release. He clamped her mouth shut and to reassure her showered her with compliments. All true, even. She smelled of coconut and musk, a real delight and sniffed and kissed her neck. He told her she was a real beauty, a dream come true, worthy of rivalling Aphrodite in person. Overcome by satyr thoughts, Mark was living in the moment. Satisfying his arousal was the only thing that mattered. He caressed her lovingly, saying he&#39;d be gentle and that his desire for her would be unending. He called her the fairest nymph in the woods, his dearest and his delicate and precious flower but she seemed deaf to his pleasant and sweet words. He pulled up her skirt an d tore her panty, revelling in the beauty between the legs. As he was about to finally satisfy his penis standing out of its sheath proudly and in all its glory, a monstrous force pulled him backwards by the horns. He groaned and bleated angrily and turned around, ready to ram into the jerk who had interrupted him so callously. It was Merlin.<br />
<br />
Merlin. Merlin who had thrown at him to giggling bunny girls and told him to have fun with these. His arousal dominating his mind,  Mark fell upon them and even though they smelled like cheap perfume, drugs and low-grade booze, it felt good to get his release, finally. The girls laughed and let him ram and thrust into them, kissing them and ejaculating again and again. The girls even kissed his massive erection, complimenting its extensive size and girth. Their bodies were as they were advertised through their costumes but certainly worthy of passionate sex and love. Not nymphs but as low-grade maenads, they certainly were eye-catching and beautiful. As for the nymph, sobbing and shaking, Merlin consoled her and as Mark and the bunny girls recuperated from their intensive love-making, sweating and panting, he held her sleeping form in his arms, like some ancient Greek hero having rescued the fair damsel descendant of gods. He ordered Mark to follow him back to the store and to take his two girlfriends with him. After they go dressed again, even if their bunny costumes barely covered what should be in society. <br />
<br />
Mark had fun on the way back, the girls and him chatting about the entertaining sex they&#39;d had, complimenting each other a lot and how they couldn&#39;t wait to start again soon. Merlin, for one, was sure the tissue of chloroform he had made the young girl breathe would keep her calm until her transformation was over and he&#39;d deal with Mark and the two drugged idiots in the meanwhile. They were already drunk and high by the time he&#39;d found him, conscious that Mark, as a satyr, was going to get himself into potential trouble. The promise of more drugs, cocktails and wads of bills made them, following him without asking questions, saddeningly enough. He had hoped the outcome would be different, but things would still work out. Maybe, even better, who knew? His customer for purchasing mythological creatures was seldom disappointed by what Merlin had to offer and this time would certainly not be different. Even the most lousy transformation that great wizard could work to his advantage in his Fay Zoological Park. Anyway, when he had secured those four, he still had to chase the ten other frat boys who had purchased costumes at his store. Mark had fully become a satyr, or close enough. Because he had just kissed and caressed the poor innocent that had crossed his way, and not had sex completely, she&#39;d turn into a nymph, probably a wood or water specimen. As for the two others, as Mark had fully thrust into them, and more than once, they&#39;d definitely turn into female satyrs. Merlin sighed. The night would be productive indeed, and lead to much gold coins, but was going to be. very, very long.</p>
