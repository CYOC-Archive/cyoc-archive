<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Listen, Allison, I&#39;m sorry! I&#39;m just not completely used to thinking of you as a woman! You&#39;re still my bro. You may look like a girl, but I&#39;m still having trouble adjusting to that fact! Isn&#39;t that good enough for you?!&quot; pleaded Logan.<br />
<br />
&quot;No!&quot; said Allison, wiping the tears from her face with both of her hands. &quot;I&#39;m a girl. So are you. Accept it. Embrace it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, as you can see&quot; said Logan, raising her wrists, which had almost completely healed, &quot;I&#39;m having a bit of growing pains.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You cut me, Logan. You went right down to the bone. You tore my heart out when you said that I could never be your girlfriend. I love you!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; asked Logan, genuinely shocked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Logan, geez, you&#39;re still such a boy. I&#39;ve been head over heels crushing on you ever since the change happened. All the signs were there. Everyone knows it except for you!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh&quot; said Logan, not sure how to respond to that. She turned back to the TV, where she was watching Cartoon Network.<br />
<br />
&quot;God, I don&#39;t even know if I can do this anymore, being here I mean&quot; Allison whimpered, her face in her hands, shaking because she finally cleared the air on how she felt but thought she could never reveal. <br />
<br />
&quot;Christ, two days as a girl, and you&#39;re already a bigger crybaby than Kaitlyn was&quot; said Logan sarcastically.<br />
<br />
Kaitlyn Shulgin had been a girl that Logan and Alan both went to middle school with, and had been infamous for being a drama queen attention whore. She had moved out of town with her family during the summer between eighth and ninth grade, leading to many people in their social circle celebrating the fact that she was finally gone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I&#39;M the crybaby&quot; retorted Allison. &quot;I&#39;m not the one who tried to kill herself the second she started growing boobs!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Nice job trying to guilt trip the suicide patient, Allison!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, don&#39;t you pull that with me, buster!&quot;<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Julia Armitage, an eighty year old born-woman who had been affected by the Great Change more than most(Not only being cured of her scoliosis and her Parkinson&#39;s Disease symptoms but now looking about seventeen years old),  had been exercising her newfound physical freedom in the hallway when she had overheard Logan and Allison&#39;s lovers spat. She stopped in front of their room, opened the privacy curtain just a bit, and watched the girls bicker. <br />
<br />
&quot;You two should just fuck and get it over with.&quot;<br />
<br />
Logan and Allison spotted the small, frail little blonde girl snark at them and then casually skip away down the corridor. Then they turned back to one another.<br />
<br />

<br />
Aziz looked at the man(?) cautiously. Thinking about what negative things this journey might entail, she had come to the decision to throw caution to the wind and go with him. After all, the mysterious stranger was right. Saudi Arabia was a rigged system, and she had little chance of advancing beyond her current station in life since she was not part of the royal class or the pseudo-aristocracy of the rich. Her family was well off enough to take care of themselves without her, especially now that the Great Change had made the subjugation of women, one of the kingdom&#39;s greatest means of social control totally irrelevant, and she knew her friends would manage as well.<br />
<br />
&quot;I...am intrigued&quot; said Aziz with a sly grin forming over her coffee colored face. &quot;And I accept your offer.&quot;<br />
<br />
The bearded man clapped his hands so loudly in jubilation that it had sounded like thunder. &quot;Great!&quot; he announced boisterously. <br />
<br />
The portal then opened within the living room.<br />
<br />

<br />
At home in her spacious bedroom, Kira was currently whipping her newest acquisition on her wide bottom. Her newest slave was a white new-girl who had formerly been an obese little nerdy outcast named Dave Foyle, now a cute geeky girl named Dana. Amanda had spotted Dana in Ms. Chung&#39;s class and talked her up, making friends with her before dropping the bomb that she was looking for another sub to bring home to her Queen, showing her the slave collar. Dana, who had never had any friends and was desperate for any kind of human relationship, eagerly agreed. <br />
<br />
They had gone to Kira&#39;s home, and after the Queen had sized up the glasses wearing cutie and approved of her, told her that her ass belonged to Kira now. She had Dana strip out of her long skirt, which had appeared on her in the middle of class the day the Great Change happened, take off her brown top and bra, and get ready for a day she would never forget...<br />
<br />
**<br />
<br />
Lucretia was listening to Robbie&#39;s sob story with sympathy. She had known Robert for a long time and had never expected her co-worker, who had always been so confident and self-assured before the Change, become so broken and fragile looking. She consoled the new-woman with a long and tight hug. Robbie gradually returned the hug.<br />
<br />
&quot;Does that feel better?&quot; Lucretia asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;A-a little&quot; sniffled Robbie.<br />
<br />
&quot;Say, why don&#39;t you come with me after work. We can go have a drink together, forget our problems. Maybe see a movie or something until you get your mind off of things. I&#39;m sure Elizabeth wouldn&#39;t mind, would she?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;S-she probably wouldn&#39;t even notice&quot; said a slightly whimpering Robbie.<br />
<br />
Lucretia surprised herself when she had seemingly noticed Robbie&#39;s body for the first time. It sure was curvy, she thought, and Robbie&#39;s boobs were bigger than hers. And her face. It was as innocent and pouty as a child&#39;s. She began to wonder why Elizabeth would ignore as somebody as adorable as Robbie had become.<br />
<br />
**<br />
<br />
Principle Negrotti had received her second phone call in a row from someone who had complained about Millie Aaronsohn&#39;s and Juliana Quesada&#39;s newfound romance. They had been seen last night, flirting and goofing off like schoolgirls all over town. She had no idea why Millie and Juliana, both of whom Jenna had respected beyond compare, were being singled out and picked on. She almost wanted to tell off these batty bigots and religious fanatics to cut the shit, but her position was at stake. <br />
<br />
**<br />
<br />
Greta and Jean were squealing at the former&#39;s home, which had recently been &quot;renovated&quot; into a large mansion. <br />
<br />
&quot;We did it!&quot; screamed Jean. &quot;We solved climate change!&quot;<br />
<br />
The ring on Greta&#39;s finger glowed with the aftermath it has when it unleashes a massive dose of magic.</p>
