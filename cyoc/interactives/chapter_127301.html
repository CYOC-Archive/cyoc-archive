<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;We should probably check to make sure no-one is around.  I wasn&#39;t exactly quiet.  And when we&#39;re sure we&#39;re alone... I think we should get to really know each other&quot;  Her voice echoed as both bodies spoke simultaneously.  She leaned in and kissed you on the neck with one body, while her other body seductively traced her fingers along her curves.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh... Yeah, good idea!&quot;  Her little display served its purpose to get your blood flowing.  This was the girl you had fantasized about for years.  No, this was two of that girl.  And she was just as into you, as you were into her.  Except she used to be a singular she, and now she was a plural she.  The strange machine you had discovered had not only made an identical clone of her, it had somehow caused her to be both the original and the clone at the same time.  A single girl in two bodies.  A single girl who was in love with you.<br />
<br />
She had always been very shy - her flirty attitude right now was a stretch from how she normally acted.  The rush of discovering your attraction was mutual must have broken her out of her shy shell.  Or maybe it was being cloned.  Either way, you knew that if someone stumbled upon the two of you doing anything more intimate, she would be embarrassed to death.  &quot;I&#39;ll check the front.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Make sure to check all the way down to the curb.  I don&#39;t want anyone to wander in, like we did.  I&#39;ll check the back.&quot; She released her grip on you, and both girls turned and walked different ways deeper into the facility.  You admired both of her cute butts as she walked away from you.  Then turned and went out the way you came in, through a hole next to the front door.<br />
<br />
The courtyard of the abandoned facility was still empty and in disrepair.  Overgrown grass had claimed much of the landscaping, and cracks in the cement allowed patches of it to grow up through the road.  The parking lot out front still had no vehicles in it.  You remembered her request and walked down the long abandoned drive to the chain link gate that separated the overgrowth from the road.  The cut portion of the fence you had squeezed through had swung shut, disguising its existence.<br />
<br />
You looked both ways down the street.  There was no foot traffic, and no road traffic.  This was a bit of a back street, so that wasn&#39;t unusual.  Satisfied that no-one was going to disturb you, you turned back to the mysterious and suspiciously logo-less building and started the walk back up the drive.  It wasn&#39;t a hard walk, it just took a couple minutes to reach the abandoned building.<br />
<br />
While walking, you couldn&#39;t help but fantasize about what life would be like now, with two of the same girlfriend.  She had very clearly wanted to get physical.  Both of her.  That would mean a threesome.  For your first time.  It was a heavenly thought that only spurred you on faster.<br />
<br />
You made it back to the hole in the building and ducked through.  From deeper in the building, you heard a familiar screaming/moaning.  Just like when she had been cloned.  With great speed, you rushed through the building to the room with the tube.  She sat at the monitor, watching it carefully.  The second girl sat on a lab table next to the door, and smiled as you walked in.  &quot;All clear?&quot;  she inquired.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah.&quot;  You looked around but didn&#39;t see anything different from when you had last been in the room.  She got up off the table and embraced you in a hug and quick peck on the cheek.  &quot;Don&#39;t worry, I already checked back here.  There&#39;s no-one else here.  Just you and me.  Uh... mes, I guess.&quot; she laughed at her wordplay.  Relieved that nothing seemed off, you kissed her on the cheek.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry, I thought I heard the machine going again.&quot;  You wrapped your arms around her waist and held her close.  The other girl remained seated at the terminal, clearly reading something off it.  She hadn&#39;t reacted when you had entered the room.  But, she was also the girl you were holding in your arms.  She had always been like this - when she found something interested she always got completely absorbed in it, and became oblivious to the outside world.  Now though, she seemed to be capable of getting completely absorbed in a subject while also doing other things.  A small part of you envied her, but you didn&#39;t know enough about the machine to trust it.<br />
<br />
The girl you were holding spoke softly, &quot;Oh, that.  Yeah, I was trying a few things with it.&quot;  You looked down at her, concerned.  &quot;Wait, what?  What happened?&quot;  She smiled and pressed her lips together, clearly showing they were closed.  Her response echoed at you from around the lab, &quot;Oh, more of the same.&quot;<br />
<br />
Startled, you released your hold on the girl and looked around.  She wrapped her arms around your shoulders and hugged you close.  Two more girls walked out from around the machinery and shyly waved at you.  &quot;You... cloned yourself again?!&quot;<br />
<br />
Her response came in quadruple echo, &quot;Yeah!  Twice.  So I&#39;m 4 of me now.&quot;  The girl at your side leaned over to your ear and whispered, &quot;What&#39;s the saying?  More of me to love?  There&#39;s plenty of me to love now!&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;What if the machine scrambled your brain?  You didn&#39;t know it would work the same way the second time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But it didn&#39;t!  I&#39;m fine.&quot; &quot;I feel better than fine... I feel amazing.&quot; &quot;It&#39;s really liberating being in multiple places.&quot; &quot;And having multiple brains.&quot; &quot;I bet school will be a breeze like this.&quot;  &quot;Hah, I can even cheat on tests if I want.&quot; &quot;Not that I ever would.  Don&#39;t need to.&quot; &quot;But now I can be in class and somewhere else...&quot; &quot;... like with you.&quot;  She spoke each line with a different body, speaking with each body at least once.<br />
<br />
&quot;I was just worried.  I don&#39;t want you to get hurt.  Especially not to some strange cloning machine.  I... I love you.&quot;<br />
<br />
She kissed you on the lips.  The 3 other hers spoke in echo, &quot;I love you too.&quot;<br />
<br />
Her kiss was just as loving and tender as the first time.  When it finally ended, she whispered to you, &quot;Come with me.  I have a gift for you.&quot;  She released her hug on you and lead you to a second tube over by the machine.  The door swung open as you approached.  She motioned for you to get into the tube.<br />
<br />
You stopped and turned around.  The girl you had just kissed slowly released your hand and stepped back.  She smiled at you and mouthed &quot;I love you.&quot; You saw the girl still sitting at the console - she had her head propped up on her arms and a broad lovestruck smile on her face as she watched you.  A 3rd copy of the girl sat on a lab table and twirled her hair through her fingers.  The 4th copy of your girlfriend was nowhere to be seen, but that wasn&#39;t entirely surprising - she had just said how much she liked being in multiple places.  She was probably just around one of the machines.<br />
<br />
You gulped and decided to trust your long-time crush and new girlfriends.  You turned around and stepped into the tube.  The door wooshed shut behind you, and you turned around to see you were now trapped.<br />
<br />
The machine hummed to life and a dull light spread through the chamber.  At first you felt nothing.  Then a faint pleasurable buzzing spread through your body.  The light grew brighter and brighter until you couldn&#39;t see any more.</p>
