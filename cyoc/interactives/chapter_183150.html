<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Marcus decided to wait a few minutes before leaving the restroom and heading back to the auditorium. He wanted to put as much distance between him and Steel to not arouse suspicion. Since the career fair was held at the end of the school day, Marcus only had to wait a few more minutes in the auditorium before being dismissed.<br />
<br />
Just as Marcus was heading to the exit he heard Victor behind him say “Where’d you going so fast?” Marcus turned around to see Victor approaching him with the body of a slightly chubby middle aged man wearing coveralls. <br />
<br />
“What happened to your other body?” Marcus asked him.<br />
<br />
“She got super pissed after she caught me messing around, so I basically had to accept one of the offers left” Victor said solemnly. <br />
<br />
“Was it Mr. Robbins, the school janitor?” Marcus guessed although he knew he was right. <br />
<br />
“Yeah, whatever it’s only a week. Besides tell me about your job and where you were headed so fast” Victor said excitedly. Marcus began to feel a few beads of sweat on his forehead.<br />
<br />
“I chose a freelance writer….” Marcus lied, “and I need to go home to watch my little brother. My parents need to run some errands.” Victor then bid him farewell and Marcus headed home. The walk was only 15 minutes but his new body made it feel so much more different than usual and much more longer.<br />
<br />
Every once in a while he felt a slight ache from his right knee or from his shoulder. It wasn’t unbearable but it was slightly jarring from his old body. In addition, his body was earnestly aching for sleep which Marcus knew he wouldn&#39;t be getting any of for a few more hours. Now He needed to get home and convince his parents quickly. Although he got home much slower than usual, his new height allowed him to take much wider steps allowing him to go a bit faster at least,<br />
<br />
When he arrived home, he found his parents in the living room watching the news. “How’d the career fair go today?” His dad asked him. <br />
<br />
“Pretty good! I found an awesome job!” Marcus said closing the door behind him. <br />
<br />
“Really what is it?” His mom asked him. <br />
<br />
“This freelance writer is allowing me to shadow him and the best part is that he’s always traveling to different locations to write articles” Marcus said with fake enthusiasm. His plan to convince his parents was already in motion, now he just need a little more.<br />
<br />
“That sounds pretty interesting” his Dad said changing the channel. Marcus could tell they were beginning to lose interest, which was the perfect time to strike.<br />
<br />
“By the way, he asked if I could stay with him this week so I could travel with him much easier while I shadow him” Marcus said calmly. His parents looked at each other. <br />
<br />
“I don’t know…” his Mom began. <br />
<br />
“Mom please let me do this! I really like this job. And this writer is super reliable, he&#39;s known by a lot of the townspeople.” Marcus said begging with his hairy calloused hands. <br />
<br />
“Let the boy go”, his Dad said “it sounds like he’s really into this career.” <br />
<br />
His Mom glanced at him a bit disapprovingly but finally caved in. “Fine. But I want you to call me at least once a day”. <br />
<br />
Marcus grinned. “Thanks Mom” he said as he made his way up the stairs.<br />
<br />
Now Marcus had to avoid his parents until tomorrow, he saw his little brother in his room playing a video game. If he took an interest in Marcus&#39; new appearance, he didn&#39;t show it as he continued playing. Marcus closed his bedroom door behind him and noticed how much smaller everything appeared. Thanks to his new height, his whole room appeared to be miniaturized, however he was still able to fit on his bed although his legs hung over a little. Marcus then took notice of the smell on him, it was the aroma of stale tobacco and alcohol. He had forgotten how much Steel reeked of the stuff, if his parents took notice he would never be given the chance to stay with Steel. &quot;I guess I need to wash up&quot; Marcus said.<br />
<br />
Luckily for him, Marcus had his own bathroom and began to undress. He took off the fedora, overcoat, and dress shirt and tie but found himself hesitating thereafter. He took off his belt before undoing the button on his pants. He found a pair of black boxers awaiting him with a nice outline bulging out. &quot;Here goes nothing&quot; Marcus said as he took them off exposing Steel&#39;s body completely. Marcus gasped at his new cock... it was enormous! It was much longer than his previous one, perhaps 8 inches if he had to guess. It was also surrounded by a huge bush of salt n&#39; pepper pubes.<br />
<br />
Marcus glanced at his reflection. Although he looked a bit silly with his old head, if he ignored it, he had a nice body that seemed to be everything he had always wanted. Marcus then took a quick shower making sure to get rid of the questionable aroma on his body before changing back into his original clothing. Afterward he had dinner and returned to his bedroom. The whole thing had been a success and now Marcus had to just find where to meet Steel. While it was only 9 PM, Marcus could feel his body aching for sleep and he decided to give in. But first he took out the purple vial of AC-3 and swallowed it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now I just need to meet up with Steel Tomorrow&quot; Marcus thought as he drifted to sleep.</p>
