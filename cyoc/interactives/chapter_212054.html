<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Miles woke up first and felt James lighter body again as he started to move. He felt his own body lying his back and his big hairy arm around his waist. Miles slipped the magic ring of the finger, moved the arm away and went over to the mirror again. He was James again and somehow felt better than the last few days. He hid the ring in the room and admired his fuckable butt once more.<br />
It didnt took long and James awoke too. Miles was still staring at his own reflection as he heard James clear his throat. <br />
&quot;Do you really think I can pull of being you, sir?&quot;, James asked with Miles deep voice.<br />
It send shivers down Miles spine and seeing the submissive James controlling his big, hairy and muscular body somewhat turned him on. He started to question if the last swap changed him but he immediately pushed the thought away as James posed the question again.<br />
&quot;Sadly you cant take off as me for the full week but you could take off the first few days until you&#39;re catched up with the recent work I&#39;ve done and have to do.&quot;, Miles said.<br />
&quot;So I&#39;ll stay here, look at your recent activities as CEO and come back to play you?&quot;, James got up and started to get dressed in my tailored suit.<br />
Miles started to put on James clothes too.<br />
&quot;Yes. I&#39;ve already scheduled the next two weeks so that you wont have a meeting where you could slip up but you&#39;ll still have to do the smaller things.&quot;, Miles said.<br />
He watched James fixing his tie before slipping into the dress shoes. Miles stepped into James Chucks and tied them.<br />
&quot;What key is the one for your apartment?&quot;, Miles asked pulling out a keyring from his pocket. <br />
&quot;It&#39;s so weird that I will live here, in this giant house, for a week. Is this really okay for you?&quot;, James asked walking towards Miles.<br />
He was now standing right in front of Miles, his pecs were inches away from Miles face.<br />
&quot;Let me see...&quot;, he snatched the keyring from Miles hands and looked through the keys.<br />
Miles could smell the perfume and aftershave of his real body and it made his small dick hard. He looked up at James and waited for him to show the keys purposes.<br />
&quot;This one is for the front door, this is the back door,...&quot;, James started to explain every key to Miles.<br />
After he finished talking Miles grabbed the keys and said goodbye to James. He wanted to get some distance right now as he started to fall in awe with his real body while James explained the keys. Could it be that they get more the bodies manerisms with every swap, he asked himself. Deeply ashamed of his dick tenting his pants he reached for the door.<br />
&quot;Wait a minute...&quot;, he heard his old voice shouting again. Instinctively he turned around again to look at James. James came down the stairs and Miles watched how his muscles moved beneath the tight suit with every step, every breath James took.<br />
&quot;We should adress each other by our bodies respective names right? So I should call you James for the time now. Is that okay, sir?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes, definitely.&quot;, agreed Miles. &quot;And you have to drop the sir now that you are me.&quot;<br />
 &quot;Yes, sir - I mean James. Do we keep each others private phones too? I mean I dont know if I really want to talk as you to your friends and know all of your private stuff.&quot;, James continued. &quot;Maybe we should keep our own phones. I mean we could just write each other if something comes up. No need to look at each others private chats.&quot;<br />
It was weird seeing Miles muscular body to act this insecure.<br />
&quot;Yeah, sure.&quot;, Miles said handing James his phone. &quot;I&#39;ll still leave my work phone here. You can reach out to me on my private phone. I&#39;ll see you at work in a couple of days.&quot;<br />
With that Miles left his own house and took the bus to James apartment. <br />
<br />
Over the next few dates James as Miles looked at his new temporary home through all the business operations Miles did before the swap and those that are important for the forseeable future.<br />
Miles as James was working hard as the intern in his own company. He delivered coffee, printed important stuff for coworkers and secretly tried to find the mule while doing so. Sadly he had no luck so far.<br />
At the evening of the third workday as each other James heard a new notification on Miles workphone. He unlocked it to see a grindr message to his surprise. He knew he should not read the message regarding the private sex life of his boss as he should continue studying before going to work again tomorrow but his body&#39;s sex drive got pent up so much over the last couple of days that he needed some kind of relief. <br />
He opened grindr and read the message.<br />
It was from a young hunk named Vince who just recently moved into Miles neighborhood. James texted back and suddenly found himself in a very engaging conversation witj Vince.<br />
Vince was 28, the same size and of similar statue as Miles, and momentarily jobless but he was still craving some sexual action.<br />
James invited Vince over quickly. <br />
It didnt take long and he brought Vince into the special room, just like Miles brought him into it a few weeks ago.<br />
&quot;Wow, this room feels bigger than my entire apartment!&quot;, Vince said looking around.<br />
James took off his suit jacket and tie.<br />
&quot;You&#39;re still a bottom, right?&quot;, James asked Vince.<br />
&quot;For you? Always.&quot;, Vince answered. <br />
James hung up the jacket in the closet as Vince took a look.<br />
&quot;Wow! Are all of these your suits? They look incredible!&quot;, Vince asked. &quot;I havent owned let alone worn a suit in years.&quot;<br />
He let his hands move across the hung up suits.<br />
&quot;Can I try one? Please!&quot;, he begged at James just as Miles workphone started to ring.<br />
&quot;I have to take that.&quot;, James said grabbing the phone.<br />
&quot;Please, just one for this moment.&quot;, Vince begged further.<br />
&quot;Yeah, why not. Go ahead.&quot;, James answered. <br />
He left the room and Vince heard him answering the phone. He picked out a blue three piece suit, together with a white shirt and dark red tie. He grabbed a pair of black dress shoes and a black belt before he went over to the dresser and searched for a pair of underpants and socks.<br />
He took a pair of Miles black boxer briefs and a pair of gold toe socks.<br />
As he wanted to close the drawer he suddenly saw something shimmering between the socks. He grabbed it and pulled out a nice looking ring. The magic ring which powers Vince doesnt know of.<br />
He put the ring onto the dresser and quickly undressed himself. <br />
Vince stepped into the black boxer briefs before slipping the socks over his muscular calfs. He put on the white dress shirt, followed by the dress pants. He pulled the belt around his waist and tied the tie. He slipped the vest over his broad shoulders and buttoned it up. He slowly wiggled his feet into Miles worn dress shoes and tied them. For the finishing touch he put on the suit jacket.<br />
Vince stepped in front of the mirror and admired his looks. Miles suit fits him perfectly and he looks dashing in it. His eyes wander over to the ring on the dresser. He questined himself wether he should also put on Miles juwelry or if thats too much. He had to decide quickly as he heard James as Miles opening the door.</p>
