<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">One of the girls cuddling with her pouted.  &quot;Leaving us so soon, Maria?&quot;  She reached over to kiss the girl on her cheek. <br />
<br />
Maria smiled.  &quot;Yeah, it&#39;s past my bedtime.&quot;<br />
<br />
The girl on her other side spoke up.  &quot;Why don&#39;t we all get a room at the hotel across the street, then?&quot;<br />
<br />
Nancy looked down.  &quot;What do you want to do, hon?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t really afford that, but I&#39;d love to.&quot;<br />
<br />
The first girl, Allison, laughed.  &quot;Oh don&#39;t worry your pretty little head about that!&quot;<br />
<br />
The other girl, Rachel nodded.  &quot;We&#39;d be happy to pay for our little love shack.&quot;<br />
<br />
Maria looked up at Nancy.  &quot;What do you think?&quot;<br />
<br />
Nancy nuzzled the girl&#39;s hair.  &quot;Whatever you want, beautiful.&quot;<br />
<br />
Maria looked at her admirers.  She figured that Nancy, Rachel, and Allison were the best looking ones, but there were a pair of tiny blonde twins she&#39;d been eyeing (and they&#39;d been looking right back).  &quot;How about you two, you want to come along?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Very much so!&quot;<br />
<br />
Half an hour later, the six girls found themselves in a suite at the Hilton across the street.  It featured an enormous bed, and a jacuzzi, which the girls were currently occupying.  The twins were named Jessie and Jamie, and they were very cute- despite being 19 they were smaller than Maria was.  Things became something of a blur after that, all Maria could remember was a pleasant haze of sex before she woke up in a pile of girls on the bed.<br />
<br />
Nancy was holding her protectively, and one of the twins was resting her head on Maria&#39;s crotch.  Maria reached to stroke the adorable blond&#39;s hair, and the girl made a pleasant purring sound as she stirred slightly.<br />
<br />
The twin...Jamie, Maria thought, had proven to be quite skilled with her tongue, to her enjoyment.  Why had she ever married a man, when a woman was so much better?  Not that she regretted giving birth to Gina- her little girl was gorgeous!<br />
<br />
Still, if only a woman could have children with another woman.  She was sure the girls present would make some beautiful babies!  The other twin, Jessie, opened her eyes.  &quot;Hey Maria.&quot;  She smiled lazily.  &quot;What are you thinking about?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;d think it&#39;s silly.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nuh-uh...I wouldn&#39;t.&quot;  She had a dreamy look on her face, and her eyes seemed glassy.<br />
<br />
&quot;I was thinking wouldn&#39;t it be great if a woman could get another woman pregnant?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ooh.  Yes!  I&#39;d love to have your babies.&quot;  Jessie grinned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, well...I&#39;d love to give them to you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jessie reached for her.  &quot;C&#39;mere, and we can try.&quot;<br />
<br />
Wriggling out of Nancy&#39;s grip, Maria went down on the tiny blonde, who seemed younger than before.  Well she had been a bit drunk.<br />
<br />
Hours later, Maria woke to a cry of &quot;Holy shit!&quot;<br />
<br />
Sitting up, she saw Nancy standing in front of a mirror.  Something was different about the girl.  &quot;Nancy, what&#39;s wrong?&quot;<br />
<br />
She then heard crying from the bathroom and got up to investigate.  She found Jessie and Jamie in there...but it was impossible, the girls looked more like 11 year olds than grown women!  Jamie was staring at the tiny buds that passed for her breasts in shock.<br />
<br />
The door closed, and Allison came in.  The girl looked barely 13...and she was carrying a small girl with dark hair.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my God, is that...Rachel?&quot;<br />
<br />
Allison set Rachel down, who looked all of seven.  She was adorable, with blue eyes and curly dark hair.  &quot;I woke up and I was little!&quot;<br />
<br />
Nancy came over.  She looked to be 17 if she was a day.  &quot;We all got younger.  Even you, a little bit.&quot;<br />
<br />
Maria looked at herself in the mirror.  Nancy was right, she looked maybe 14.  Her breasts were still B cups, but barely.  &quot;Ok girls, I have a confession to make.  I didn&#39;t know this would happen but...I&#39;m actually 39.&quot;<br />
<br />
All the girls gasped.  <br />
<br />
&quot;How is that even possible?&quot;  Nancy looked frightened.<br />
<br />
&quot;I really don&#39;t know.  Tell me, girls, how many of you were lesbians or bisexual before you met me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I was bi.&quot;  Nancy spoke up.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m bi, and Rachel is exclusively girls-only.&quot;  Allison added.<br />
<br />
The twins looked at each other.  &quot;We...we thought we were straight.&quot;  Jessie frowned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Obviously that&#39;s not true.&quot;  Jamie nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok, well, I&#39;m married to a man and have a daughter.  But right now...I don&#39;t feel a damn thing when I think about Justin, even though we&#39;ve been married for twenty years.&quot;<br />
<br />
The other girls looked at each other, then back at Maria.  &quot;I think we all feel the same.  So what happened to you...to us?&quot;  Nancy was holding it together in the face of an impossible situation.<br />
<br />
&quot;I really don&#39;t know.  I started having thoughts about...my daughter and her friend.  I didn&#39;t understand it, but I couldn&#39;t shake how aroused I was feeling, so I went to my room and masturbated.  I felt really hot, and a few hours later, I was a teenager again.  It was really weird, like a dream, all I knew was, I wanted to have sex with a girl bad, and I made my way to the club.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So is it some kind of disease?&quot;  Rachel&#39;s eyes were puffy and red.  She&#39;d been crying.  Who could blame her, having gone from a twenty-something woman to a first-grader?<br />
<br />
&quot;A virus that makes you into a lesbian?&quot;  Jamie shook her head.<br />
<br />
&quot;And a kid?  No way!&quot;  Jessie added.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I mean, it&#39;s happened.  We can&#39;t deny it.  The evidence is right in front of us.  What I want to know is, why did some of us get younger than others, and are we going to get smaller?&quot;  Allison waved her arms excitedly.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, no, I don&#39;t want to turn into a baby!&quot;  Rachel started to cry again, and was comforted by the twins.<br />
<br />
&quot;Girls.  Calm down.  All we have to do is get to the hospital, and they can check us out.&quot;  Maria smiled at them, and they all smiled back.  Even though they were upset and scared, they were all in love with the petite raven-haired girl.  <br />
<br />
Now that the plan was set, they got dressed (even if some of the girl&#39;s clothing now looked ridiculous on their shrunken frames) and they went down to the lobby to call an ambulance.</p>
