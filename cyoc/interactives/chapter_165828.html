<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">   Marcus thought he heard Oliver&#39;s voice from the bull door, so he opened it and went inside.<br />
   The room was pitch dark. He couldn&#39;t see anything. Marcus tried calling for Oliver&#39;s name, but to no avail. He kept looking and calling inside the room.<br />
   Suddenly, a great wind came from the room, and it shut the door behind Marcus, trapping him inside. He panicked and didn&#39;t know what to do. He tried pulling out his cellphone, but he realized that it had suddenly disappeared. His pockets were empty. He had no way to call 911.<br />
   As he tried thinking of another way to get out of the room, something lit up in the middle. It was a golden orb, and it was standing on a pedestal. Marcus backed away, not knowing what this orb was, and what it was going to do. Suddenly, he heard thunder rambling, and before he knew it, lightning came speeding from the golden orb and struck him in the chest. He was electrified, but luckily he didn&#39;t die. He fell on to the ground, weak, and with a serious pain in his head. His ears were ringing, and his body started to ache madly. He pressed his hands against his ears, trying to get the ringing to stop. And then he winced in pain as two small nubs sprouted sprouting from his forehead. &quot;Ah! God, what is this?&quot; The room was lit dimly by the golden orb, so he could still see himself, and what was happening to his body. <br />
   After the two small nubs, the change started in his feet. He took his shoes off, and he saw that his feet had swollen, and were stretching to the length of his calves. &quot;What&#39;s happening to me?&quot; he cried in horror as he saw his toes fuse together and become black hooves.Fur started sprouting from where his hooves where. He saw his entire skin transition into the leathery hide similar to that of a bull&#39;s.<br />
   &quot;Ack!&quot; He rolled over to his back and cringed as he gripped his legs. With each second, his heart pounded like crazy. And with each pound his body grew and grew. As he felt his heart beat strongly, he could feel his muscles inflate with it. <br />
   Lub dub! His calves grew, and his leg muscles exploded, ripping his pants.<br />
   Lub dub! His chest grew, as his pecs inflated to that of a massive body builder. The change ripped his shirt, revealing his massive and sweaty trapezoids and barrel like chest. His nipples were erect as ever.<br />
   Lub dub! He felt his arm inflate with power and strength. His shoulders were like boulders now, and his biceps, triceps, and forearms made him look like had been lifting for years. <br />
   Lub dub! His gut tightened, and he could make out his abs bulging from his core.<br />
   Lub dub! His ass grew, building and growing with muscles. And something was threatening to pop from above his rear. <br />
   Marcus looked at his hands as they inflated too. Two pairs of his fingers were fusing, and by the end he had a large three digit hand each tipped by a hard black hoof. &quot;Oh God, what is happening to me...&quot;<br />
   He clutched his stomach; the change wasn&#39;t over yet. He went down on all fours and winced in pain. He felt something explode from behind him, and as he looked back, he discovered a tail swishing from his behind.<br />
   &quot;What the fuck! Is that a tail?&quot; He cringed once again as he felt two simultaneous changes happen. &quot;Oh fuck!&quot; he cried, discovering that his voice had become a deep baritone. &quot;Oh fuuuuuuccckkk!&quot; He clutched his stomach once again, as his horns grew and his face stretched out into a muzzle. His brow furrowed, and his nostrils flared. &quot;Fruu....mruu..mooooooooo!!!&quot; he bellowed in a bull&#39;s pleasurable moo as he felt his dick explode into massive proportions. He looked at it and saw that it had changed color, gaining a dark brown and leathery hide. The tip was now darkened. His balls started churning, and he bellowed as they grew along with his dick.<br />
    As his transformation slowed, and his fur finished growing across his body, his python of a cock slumped unto the ground.<br />
   Marcus stood up and marveled at the change that had happened to his body. He felt his face, or rather, his muzzle. He touched his horns, realizing that they were the ones weighing his head down. He admired his muscles. Damn, he was built like a god. And as he examined his legs, he saw that they weren&#39;t human anymore. They were the strong hind legs of a bull.<br />
   &quot;Fuck,&quot; he said in his low, gravelly voice. &quot;I&#39;ve turned into a Minotaur!&quot;<br />
    He stood there, basking in his nudity. The cold atmosphere made his cock start to grow.He was dumb founded.<br />
   Then, suddenly, the golden orb in the middle grew brighter, and he realized that there had been another door all along at the end of the room as the orb&#39;s light revealed it to him.<br />
   Suddenly, the door&#39;s knob turned, someone entered the room. It was...</p>
