<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kaitlyn found the note stuck in her binder at exactly 7:30 P.M, after she had eaten dinner with her family <br />
downstairs. Now she was in her bedroom, finishing up the homework that she hadn&#39;t completed already.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s this?&quot; she thought to herself. Kaitlyn took off her black-rimmed glasses because she thought her eyes <br />
were deceiving her. The note seemed to be a question sheet about how she would be if she were a guy. Pfft. She <br />
had no interest in being a boy! When she was about to put it back into her pack, the note&#39;s writing suddenly disappeared, only to be replaced by this warning:<br />
<br />
&quot;YOU MUST COMPLETE THIS QUESTIONNAIRE. SOMETHING BAD WILL HAPPEN TO YOU IF YOU DON&#39;T.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kaitlyn was a little scared now. The note was ALIVE.<br />
<br />
&quot;What bad thing?&quot; she asked, feeling ridiculous.<br />
<br />
&quot;YOU WILL BE ERASED. YOU WILL HAVE NEVER BEEN BORN. YOUR LIFE WILL BE EXTINGUISHED.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kaitlyn put her glasses back on as the ominous threats were replaced once again by the questionnaire.<br />
<br />
1. If you were a boy, would your handwriting be sloppy?<br />
<br />
Kaitlyn really didn&#39;t want to do this, as she thought herself above such superstition, but the idea that she <br />
could just *Poof* really bothered her. And besides, it&#39;s just a note. Magic didn&#39;t exist. There had to be a <br />
physical explanation for why the wording changed. No problem with just...humoring the note for a bit until she <br />
figured this mystery out.<br />
<br />
&quot;No&quot; she wrote for the first question.<br />
<br />
2. If you were a boy, would you like pink?<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes&quot; she wrote. Pink was her favorite color anyway, and she didn&#39;t want it changed. In fact, the pen that she <br />
was using had pink ink in it.<br />
<br />
3. If you were a boy, would your hair be straight or curly?<br />
<br />
Kaitlyn had very nappy hair that she had to use a flat iron on every day since she was black. She didn&#39;t <br />
really like it, which was why she straightened it out every day.<br />
<br />
&quot;My hair would be naturally straight, to my waist, and very thick&quot; she wrote.<br />
<br />
Her hair, which she had been growing out lately, suddenly lengthened a few more inches to her hips, and grew <br />
in volume. Kaitlyn stroked the long ropes of hair, sighing heavily and getting slightly aroused at the thought <br />
that she could change herself. Maybe this note wasn&#39;t so bad after all...but she didn&#39;t want to be a boy...<br />
<br />
4. If you were a boy, what would your favorite color be?<br />
<br />
&quot;Pink, like I wrote earlier.&quot;<br />
<br />
5. If you were a boy, what color would your hair be and how would you wear it?<br />
<br />
&quot;Same color as it is now, but I have a genetic mutation which lets me naturally change the color of my hair <br />
whenever I feel like it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kaitlyn added the last part to try a little experiment. She grabbed some locks of her hair(in all honestly, <br />
her hair felt like it weighed more than her), and she willed it to change color to royal blue. It did. Kaitlyn <br />
then shoved her free hand towards her gasping mouth. She changed it back to charcoal black, and suddenly <br />
sighed in relief. This thing was real...and she could do ANYTHING.<br />
<br />
6. If you were a boy, what kind of skin color would you have?<br />
<br />
&quot;Same skin color I have now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kaitlyn considered becoming Asian or even Italian, but she was proud of her ethnicity, and she didn&#39;t want to <br />
feel like a traitor to her family or her ancestors. Her skin didn&#39;t change.<br />
<br />
7. If you were a boy, would you play sports?<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, but only casually. I would be good at everything, and be a natural athlete.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kaitlyn&#39;s soft and curvy body suddenly tightened up, toning into hard earned muscle. Her arms remained thin, <br />
but were very well toned now.<br />
<br />
The arousal that she felt earlier was intensifying. She almost wanted to take her shorts off and masturbate, <br />
but the questionnaire still had plenty of questions. Hopefully she would be able to trick it.<br />
<br />
8. If you were a boy, what kind of clothes would you wear?<br />
<br />
&quot;I wouldn&#39;t be a boy. I would remain a girl, and I would have impeccable, fashionable taste.&quot;<br />
<br />
The note changed again, this time with another warning.<br />
<br />
&quot;YOU WILL TURN INTO A BOY. IT IS TOO LATE TO TURN BACK.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yeah?&quot; wrote Kaitlyn. &quot;I refuse.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kaitlyn waited several tense moments to see what would happen. When the tension almost got too great, it <br />
replied<br />
<br />
&quot;IF YOU ARGUE ANYMORE I WILL CHOOSE THE ANSWERS FOR YOU&quot;<br />
<br />
Kaitlyn knew that arguing would be useless. She didn&#39;t want to be a male but it looks like she has no choice, maybe she could become a feminine male. She finally game up and answered the question.<br />
<br />
&quot;If I was a boy I would exclusively wear only women&#39;s clothing. My wardrobe would be full of a large variety of clothes giving me limitless choice in fashion&quot; <br />
<br />
Her clothes didn&#39;t change but she felt them become somewhat tighter as her body took on more of a masculine look.<br />
<br />
Question 9: If you were a boy, how large would your penis be? <br />
<br />
&quot; My penis would be of average size&quot; <br />
<br />
Kaitlyn felt a tingling feeling in her pants. &quot;Ohhh&quot; she moaned feeling a strong arousal as her clitoris extended into a penis and a ballsack formed underneath. Her dick was hard and was straining against her panties. She rubbed her sick through her clothes a few times, tempted to masturbate. But there were still some questions left unanswered. <br />
<br />
Question 10: If you were a boy, would you be attracted to girls? <br />
<br />
Kaitlyn was unsure how to answer this one. She wanted to remain as girly as possible, but she didn&#39;t like the idea of being gay. <br />
<br />
&quot;I would be bisexual and would only be submissive in sex&quot; <br />
<br />
She decided that being bisexual would be best.<br />
<br />
Question 11: if you were a guy, would you shave?<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, I would be completely shaven all over&quot; <br />
<br />
Any body hair they was on Kaitlyn disappeared.<br />
<br />
Question 12: If you were a boy, how masuline would you act?<br />
<br />
Kaitlyn scoffed at this question. &quot;I wouldn&#39;t act masculine one bit. I&#39;d act completely female and would have no interest in ever acting like a man&quot; <br />
<br />
Kaitlyn&#39;s body took on more of a feminine pose, even more so than before. However she had o shuts herself slightly due to the dick inbetween her legs. <br />
<br />
Kaitlyn was now so aroused that it was unwarranted holding back from masturbating, she started rubbing her dick though her clothes whilst she used the other hand to answer the questions. &quot;Ohh that feels so good&quot; Ahe moaned in ecstasy.<br />
<br />
Question 13: If you were a boy, what would you body look like?<br />
<br />
Although Kaitlyn wanted to be girly, she couldn&#39;t help having a bit of muscle.<br />
<br />
&quot;I would have an athletic body build and I would be just shy of 6&quot;.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kaitlyn felt her body grow and her muscles build up. Her clothes adjusted with her, turning into a pink miniskirt. A light blue blouse, high heels and matching pink panties and bra.&quot; Kaitlyn&#39;s penis was pushing the skirt upwards, the sight of it jut turned her on even more.<br />
<br />
Question 14: If you were a boy, what would you name be?<br />
<br />
Kaitlyn like her name as it was, and decided that even though it&#39;s a girls name she wanted to keep it anyway.<br />
<br />
&quot;I would have the same name I do now&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you for playing. If you want to live a happy life pass this onto the next person you see... Boy or girl&quot; <br />
<br />
Kaitlyn was glad that it was over, and even though she wasn&#39;t too fond o her new male body, she was at least happy that she managed to stay the same mentally. She left the note outside her room, ready for someone else to find. <br />
<br />
Locking the door, she was glad she could finally relive her desperation to masturabte..</p>
