<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I pull the paper from my pocket and read it, shocked... &quot;Those guys are all gay for each other and the girls want a muscular stud like me to fuck them with no attachments.&quot;<br />
<br />
I look at Jeff who just snarls in defiance at me, still thinking I don&#39;t know what he was going to do to me, and that he could pretend I was unjustified for stopping him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jeff understands my perspective of the situation and knows how I feel and why I feel that way.&quot; It was the meanest thing I could think to say, and I&#39;m not going to lie, I felt untold amounts of joy as the hyper-jock jerk&#39;s eyes bugged out and he stared deeply into the seat backs in front of him, presumably contemplating his actions, as the girls took their seats and the movie drew closer.<br />
<br />
I took my seat before the others, next to Jeff and whispered so only Jeff could hear. &quot;Jeff can speak normally, but his words no longer have any power over our reality.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You stole my powers!&quot; Jeff said through gritted teeth.<br />
&quot;You tried to destroy my... all of our identities!&quot; I growled back crudely gesturing to the others.<br />
&quot;You would have been happy! I&#39;d have made sure of it!&quot; My perspective on the matter clearly wasn&#39;t enough to make him understand...<br />
&quot;Jeff is a closeted gay man who loves sucking my cock and getting me off.&quot; I whispered venomously, &quot;You love it so you must be okay with it! Isn&#39;t that how your logic works?&quot; I stared daggers at Jeff as his face turned into that of a wounded puppy and it slowly dawned on me what I just did. &quot;Oh no, Jeff I&#39;m sorry. You&#39;re straight! You&#39;re straight! We&#39;re just going to sit here and enjoy this movie, we&#39;ll discuss this later.&quot; I managed to get the words out as reality warped violently one way then the other before settling back down.<br />
<br />
The movie came on and a placidity fell over us, we each fell into the correct mindset to just enjoy the movie despite everything else going on. That really wasn&#39;t my intention but it was a nice reprieve from the intensity of the situation. The movie ended and we were invited by Kent and Dan for some food, but Jeff and I declined explaining that we each had some matters to attend to at home.<br />
<br />
Arriving back at the apartment I broached the topic as I sat on the couch, &quot;Jeff, I know what you were going to do to us and that makes me feel betrayed. Furthermore, you made me an out of shape, gamer nerd, I used to be in better shape than this, and that feels like a big violation too...&quot; <br />
<br />
Jeff got settled and came back to the living room, he ushered for me to lie down on the couch and unzipped my pants, &quot;I may have gotten carried away, but think about it for more than 2 seconds,&quot; He gently coaxed my dick from the confines of my underwear. &quot;I love eating your cock and getting you off, do you really think I want to share you with Kent and Dan?&quot; as he said this he started working me sending shivers throughout my body.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, but you said...&quot; I started but he cut me off continuing. &quot;Yeah, I was impulsive, but it wasn&#39;t anything we couldn&#39;t fix... take me for example, you made me gay for a minute there, but you fixed it! I love me some boobies and some sweet sweet vajay-jay!&quot; His his mouth came over my cock and started doing... whatever it was he did.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh god! Yeah, You&#39;re right. I can fix everything you fucked up. God, for a straight man, you&#39;re an expert at getting me off, you know just what to do to me and how to do it.&quot; It was meant as a compliment, but his skill increased 10 fold.<br />
<br />
He pulled his mouth off for a second, &quot;Yeah, if only the women were as easy to please as you. Here hold on...&quot; As if to demonstrate his point he went back down on me and within seconds I was orgasming.<br />
<br />
&quot;You.. you&#39;re.. you&#39;ll f-f-find someone...&quot; I was struggling to carry on the conversation. I felt it was rude to just be pleasured, but he wasn&#39;t gay and didn&#39;t want me to return any favors for him. He did however love to see me struggle... it was a testament to his skill and prowess.<br />
<br />
He looked up and smiled, &quot;With these guns, she won&#39;t be able to keep herself away! Hey, I&#39;m sorry I turned you into a dough boy, I guess that was mean of me.&quot;<br />
<br />
I had forgotten that I wasn&#39;t always on the chunky side... &quot;Right, not to worry, this will all melt away overnight, for Kent and Dan too. We&#39;ll wake up our original sizes before you messed with us, ... um, with no side effects... uh... or anyone realizing anything changed... and our clothes will fit.&quot; <br />
<br />
Jeff looked at me quizzically, &quot;Dude? You just want to go back to being yourself? Why don&#39;t you just say you look like me? I look awesome!&quot; <br />
<br />
I cringed, he really didn&#39;t think it through... &quot;Jeff, you look amazing, you&#39;re really strong, and sexy, and you exude masculine excellence...&quot; I didn&#39;t notice as his form shifted, &quot;right now... But you need to maintain that with the right food and exercise. Your body&#39;s going to tell you when you need to eat, which will be constant, but you don&#39;t know the first thing about working out or nutrition... You thought what you did to me was mean, but what you did to yourself... Dude, you&#39;re going to freefall into ex jock mode and slide into bear territory in no time flat! I may envy your build, but I sure don&#39;t envy the grocery bill you&#39;re going to have. You could avoid it with a lot of hard work and dedication, but you just don&#39;t have that kind of drive, you went to college to avoid telling your parents you didn&#39;t want to go to college... seriously... and beyond that, with all that testosterone you&#39;re putting out, if you have any potential for thinning hair, you&#39;re going to go bald now for sure. You&#39;ve chosen who you want to become, I don&#39;t get it, but I&#39;m okay with it.&quot; I shrugged my shoulders noncommittally.<br />
<br />
Jeff visibly staggered. He hadn&#39;t pieced that together, and when he had powers he would have just said he didn&#39;t need to do anything extra to stay lean, muscular, and in peak physical condition. Things in his mind shifted wildly, no longer did he choose this form for it&#39;s current state, no, he chose it so he could ascend to beardom! Jeff blushed a deep red, and his pants tented obscenely. &quot;So, you&#39;ve figured me out,&quot; Jeff offered a vulnerable smile, obviously scared. &quot;I&#39;m glad you&#39;re okay with it,&quot; a few uncontrolled breaths escaped &quot;Most people don&#39;t, couldn&#39;t understand... that this isn&#39;t me.&quot; he made a gesture encompassing his, admittedly great body,&quot; I&#39;m nervous about how people will react when I start to coat these muscles in fat, everyone loves, me being buff, but being bulky,&quot; he swallowed &quot;hairy,&quot; his voice became a whisper &quot;balding... it will make me happy.&quot; his eyes were welling up.<br />
<br />
Jeff&#39;s sudden emotions caught me by surprise, &quot;I never imagined I&#39;d be accepted. I.. I appreciate you supporting me,&quot; he recomposed himself, I didn&#39;t mean to strike a nerve but obviously I did, &quot;but you still seem stressed, I&#39;ll grab a quick snack and then I&#39;ll let you peg me, I know we&#39;re both straight, but you still seem to need to let off some more steam and I do love getting you off.&quot; Jeff gave a heartfelt smile and turned away.<br />
<br />
I felt bad for the guy, he must have been holding that in since forever, and making us all chubbier was, at least in his mind, freeing us from the confines of male beauty standards, oh my god, it all makes sense now! I didn&#39;t like that he made me chubby, but understanding him better made me want to repay the intent despite the action, and since he was about to let me peg him... &quot;When I peg Jeff, I&#39;ll know just what to do instinctually, and be able to get him off so hard his nuts will triple in size working overtime to refill. After that he will feel so relaxed he&#39;ll pass out and sleep till tomorrow morning.&quot;</p>
