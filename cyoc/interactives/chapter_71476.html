<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Monday returned and Cory had gone back to school as usual. He had decided that he couldn't let his new odd affliction run his life, after all. The day had been uneventful so far; Cory had been successful in keeping his emotions in check, and so nothing had triggered any changes. Lisa was absent Monday.<br />
<br />
Tuesday came. Cory awoke to find that he had changed into a giant spider somewhere in the middle of the night. He chalked it up to an unusual erotic dream he had, and scuttered out of his bed and onto the floor. Heaving a sigh, Cory willed his eight legs to fuse into each other, re-forming his human arms and legs. His face pointed out into a nose and his hair grew back onto his head. Cory glanced at the spider silk in his bed with disgust. Walking to the bathroom down the hall, his abdomen and torso turned back into his chest and butt as he stepped into the shower. The changes were becoming easier for him and no longer alarmed him. It was more of a nuisance than anything else.<br />
<br />
Cory's thoughts drifted to Lisa and Penny's situation. In response, a pair of breasts popped out of his chest. Staring down at them with a scowl, Cory willed them back into himself. Cory finished his shower and went to school. Lisa was still absent. Cory went next door that night, and knocked on Lisa's door. He saw a curtain flutter in an upstairs window, but nobody answered. Cleaning the cobwebs out of his sheets, Cory went to bed.<br />
<br />
Wednesday rolled around. At Lunch Cory noticed that Lisa had returned, but had become sullen and withdrawn. He knew that it was because of what had happened to her sister Penny, petrified into a doll and unable to move. Cory wondered how long a human could remain petrified and trapped within her own body before she would go insane. As a doll, Penny wouldn't need any sleep or food. She would just exist. Cory hoped she had lapsed into some sort of unconsciousness.<br />
<br />
He decided Penny (obnoxious as she was) couldn't wait any longer. At the final bell, Cory caught up to Lisa as she was walking home.<br />
<br />
&quot;Lisa, how are things going?&quot;<br />
<br />
Lisa looked away and muttered &quot;Fine.&quot;<br />
<br />
They continued in awkward silence for several minutes. Lisa rubbed her shoulder, wishing Cory would leave her alone.<br />
<br />
As they reached their houses, Cory just blurted it out.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know what's happened to Penny, she's turned into a doll. I think I can help. I can change into things too!&quot;<br />
<br />
Lisa froze and stared at him with a dull fury.<br />
<br />
&quot;Penny is very sick. We are not looking for handouts. I heard all sorts of rumors at school today, and they were all very cruel. Very sick. I am not looking for more abuse, especially from you!&quot;<br />
<br />
Lisa stormed away. It was now or never.<br />
<br />
&quot;LISA!&quot; Cory screamed. He hoped he wouldn't regret this, but he had planned it pretty well over the past few days. As she turned around, he pulled a blue feather from his pocket and jammed it into his arm. The pain caused a spike. Before Lisa's eyes, Cory began to change.<br />
<br />
Blue feathers radiated out, running up and down his left arm, covering his hand. Running into his backyard, Lisa following, Cory quickly pulled his shirt off. The blue feathers were spreading across his chest, down his left arm. Up his neck, they joined with his now feathery blue hair around his face.<br />
<br />
Lisa stared, mouth open, as Cory turned into a blue jay.<br />
<br />
Cory kicked off his sandals. His bare feet and legs turned a dark grey. His bird feet flexed and his bones became lighter, enabling flight. His feathery arms acted as wings and Cory was able to lift himself off the ground. His shorts flopped down and off as a tail formed at the bottom of his spine. Naked, Cory flapped into the air, landing on the roof. Cory figured that was a sufficient demonstration, and stopped the process before his face became a beak or his legs reversed direction. Crouching down with his grey legs spread, he was glad for his covering of feathers.<br />
<br />
Cory yelled down, &quot;I think I can restore your sister!&quot; Flapping about, he made a quick loop around the block (he was rather enjoying this) and landed in front of a wide eyed Lisa.<br />
<br />
She simply thrust his shorts at him and turned quickly, heading off toward her door. &quot;Follow me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cory grinned as he pulled his clothes back on, feathers blowing away in the wind.</p>
