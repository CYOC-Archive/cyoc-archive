<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Susan looked at her husband, or rather the former husband now. It was her feelings that were making her go crazy. The reason why she had divorced her husband was silly and loaded with more emotions than reason. Over 20 years Susan felt more attraction towards females than for males.<br />
<br />
Jennifer, felt like an ‘accident’ that was never supposed to happen. Back then she had horrible feelings about her being a mother and giving birth to her unnamed child, but because Susan’s father, Miles Smith, wanted to keep their grandchild. Susan went along with her father&#39;s wishes. Thus Susan was &#39;pushed&#39;, mostly by her father, to give birth to her child even when she didn&#39;t want to go through with it. Susan’s parents were willing to provide Susan with monetary and parental aid. But what was the cause of this incident that lead to this &#39;accident&#39;, Susan wondered, and tried to remember that day. <br />
<br />
It was special day for something which didn&#39;t involve her being pregnant, that&#39;s what she could remember, no the day was to meant to achieve something else than a threesome. What was it. Was Susan supposed to have threesome with David, no that wasn&#39;t it, how did it go again. Susan rubbed her two brain cells together, which caused her brain to tremble and produced a small vibrating headache, and then she finally remembered all the details of that day. It went like this. She and one of her female friends wanted to explore themselves when they were at the near end of their college years. Yes, that&#39;s it. At first it should had been Susan lip smacking, tongue twisting and finger blasting her friend but instead her hedonistic college friend had invited David to the party which became a threesome session.<br />
<br />
The plan was simple, or this is how Susan&#39;s friend had said to her. Susan&#39;s friend had a crush on David as she was a more bisexual. Which meant that Susan&#39;s role was very simple. She plays as her friend’s emotional support, gives and receives a couple of french kisses to her mouth to make the guy excited, tease him a little with her moist pussy and let her friend finish the act. Then Susan’s friend and David would live happily ever after, but no, the fate had other plans in mind. Susan could had never guessed that David had never had threesome sex before in his life and the “Hey, I tell you when I pull out” speech was convincing enough for naive Susan like a worm for a fish in a hook. The sperm that was meant to go inside her friend&#39;s pussy was now inside her vagina lips.<br />
<br />
What else would have happened when Susan’s vagina met with David’s cock when she was bend down like a cow girl while she kissed her friend in the mouth. What was Susan expecting to happen when David’s virgin balls slapped themselves on to her pussy lips. The “oh gosh, I&#39;m so sorry” from David’s lips and seeing her friends disappointed red face made Susan feel an emotional cocktail that made her numb. A feeling that made her distance herself from other females. The warm liquid inside her pussy made Susan revalue her life choices and she decided to stay with David, even if it felt wrong. Susan could have never guessed that she would steal her friend&#39;s crush and become stay-at-home mom after graduating. Susan never saw her friend after the incident which pushed Susan to stick with David and take him as Susan&#39;s &#39;new&#39; roommate but even then...<br />
<br />
David said all the time how he was sorry for everything. <br />
<br />
Susan tried to present her heteronormative life to her father Miles as her own choice. She lied to her father, she lied to her husband and she lied to their child Jennifer. Susan lied to everyone, including herself, that she was deeply in love with her husband and married him because of love. The real reason was the small growing bump on Susan’s stomach. She went to the altar, said her vows, took the ring in to her finger and still Susan felt sad. Everywhere Susan went she presented the fake smile to everyone as she carried her child inside her.<br />
<br />
Then Jennifer was born. <br />
<br />
And what did David say all this time when she had to breastfeed and take care of their daughter.<br />
<br />
‘Sorry-sorry-sorry’<br />
<br />
That’s what David said all the time when they were together. Maybe he didn&#39;t say those words all the time but... Even If he didn’t, he looked like as if he had done something wrong all the time. Susan’s headache got stronger as she thought about her past. Her husband was a wimp and he would have been better off if he had born as a she instead.<br />
<br />
&quot;UGH! This headache, it&#39;s...&quot; Susan winced.<br />
<br />
“Susan?” David asked and interrupted her thoughts.<br />
<br />
“Wha----!? HUH!?” Susan shouted at her husband but couldn’t believe what she saw in front of her.<br />
<br />
David looked more feminine than he had just a second ago. The beard he had was gone and he had more lengthier hair.<br />
<br />
“David. What happened. How do you look, so, uhm… How do I put this… More feminine..?” Susan asked as she couldn’t believe her eyes.<br />
<br />
“Susan. I’ve always been like this. What are you talking about?” David said to Susan.<br />
<br />
“No. That’s not what I meant. I mean, you look like someone’s bottom bitch than a top dog. No. That came out of nowhere.” Susan stopped herself from rambling as another electric spike penetrated her skull. “What was I saying again… You’ve always been gay, right?”<br />
<br />
“Susan? Are you feeling alright? Me and my husband are the reason why we broke up. We both couldn’t lie to ourselves and it was more freeing to admit that were both gay for opposite sexes. I hope you find yourself a beautiful lady that loves you.” David assured and placed his hand on Susan’s shoulder.<br />
<br />
“See. No spark. My cock isn’t moving an inch up or down. No boner. Nothing.” David chuckled as he tried to present his sexier side to Susan.<br />
<br />
Susan had to admit. She didn’t feel anything at all. It felt as if Susan’s body had gaslit herself into believing that she didn’t find David attractive at all.<br />
<br />
“All I can do is to thank you. The wonderful lessons what you taught me when we were together. My boyfriend really loves the tongue trick you showed me that one time. But that&#39;s beside the point. He&#39;s waiting me outside. One day I hope Jennifer is ready to accept that both of her parents started their future with a wrong foot. Tell her I said hi and that&#39;s she is free to visit her &#39;dads&#39; at any time.” David smiled and patted Susan’s shoulder.<br />
<br />
Susan felt a different tingle in her head and suddenly the David in front of her begun to lose height. The man in front of her was now as tall as she was, or maybe Susan was a bit taller than him.<br />
<br />
“David..? Is it just me or have you always been as tall as I am?” Susan asked from her ex-husband.<br />
<br />
David looked at his body, and...</p>
