<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Authors note&quot; This chapter&#39;s title is a verse from the hit song &quot;Time Warp&quot;. A song from the cult classic movie The Rocky Horror Picture Show.<br />
<br />
While it has been raining; the downpour has been significantly lighter since it started shortly after school. Sitting inside watching television after having a little bedroom fun; both Spencer and Frieda stole glances at each other. The movie they were watching, while sanitized for prime time viewing was a cult classic. A low budget parody of Mary Shelly’s Frankenstein with overt sexual overtones with the dialogue, wardrobe and a kitschy musical score.<br />
<br />
“I’m surprised this is on,” Frieda watching a girl in a glitter tuxedo tap dance and twirl around in a ballroom surrounded by people clearly cross dressing. “A bit cheesy mind you.”<br />
“It’s a cult classic,” Spencer answering; “I’ve heard of diehard fans heading to movie theaters dressed as their favorite characters in this movie.”<br />
“Let me guess,” Frieda watching a group of people dance in tune to the chorus; “they jumped out of their seats to do this crazy number?”<br />
&quot;Among other things,&quot; Spencer responding as the number ends and the next begins.<br />
<br />
******<br />
<br />
“I remember your father taking me to the theater to see that movie,” Amanda chuckling as she drove her daughter back home. Arriving at the Lawson’s just after nine in the evening. Catching a glimpse of the movie that was on the t.v while Frieda quickly grabbed her clothes and shifted out of her fursona; Amanda was surprised to see it on t.v. More surprised that it was the original and not the hated remake made on MTV.<br />
“You went and saw that movie with dad,” Frieda looking at her mother dubiously. “Please tell me neither of you dressed up like that odd ball scientist?”<br />
“Oh god no,” Amanda laughing; seeing her daughter looking relieved added, “we dressed up as the help.”<br />
“Those two crazies,” Frieda looking shocked; “who are you and what have you done with my mother?”<br />
“It was when we were younger,” Amanda giggling; “Benton was not an uptight stick in the mud as he has been. There was a time when he was a romantic. A bit cheesy mind you.”<br />
“Oh my,” Frieda sighing as the drive back to the estate seemed to take forever. A little sad that she had to leave Spenser; yet somewhat relieved that she didn&#39;t have to watch anymore of that schlock Spencer found as a result of channel surfing.<br />
<br />
*******<br />
<br />
Sitting at his computer desk in his room, Eric was absently humming the opening song to the movie Frieda and Spencer were watching. Despite not seeing the movie, the bond he had with Spencer and Frieda allowed him almost watch the movie by seeing it through their eyes.<br />
“I wonder if this is going lead to costume ideals for the Halloween dance,” Eric musing as he tried to work on the last of his homework. “They’ll have a lot to do to convince me from my plan to dress up as the pink panther,” Eric looking online for non-toxic pink dye. While not in his fursona, due to a broken nose he received from his math teacher; Eric was a were-panther. Pure white fur when he is in his fursona, with a barely noticeable patch of brown at the top of his head. Eric got the ideal of dressing up as the pink panther after the first time he went hunting with Frieda and Spencer.<br />
<br />
Coming back with his muzzle stain with the blood from his first hunt; a buck that spencer killed. Eric fondly remembered as he, Spencer and Frieda came to the soundproof basement of his house. Making love one final time before falling asleep; the feeling of being full and content, his girls resting by his side as they slept soundly. Eric was hoping that he could have that feeling again soon.<br />
“When this nose is finally healed,” Eric musing; “and this were-alert is over, we three are going to have one hell of a rut.”<br />
<br />
********<br />
<br />
Back at Lawson’s, Spencer sighed as she turned off the television; the movie not quite over. The hybrid were didn’t feel like watching the rest after Frieda had to leave. Her mother coming over to pick her up, despite the rain coming down. Hoping to have the entire night for just the two of them; Spencer bemoaned at the fun she had planned being denied.<br />
“And it was going to drive Eric mad with lust,” Spencer turning off the living room lights; “oh well, there is always tomorrow or Friday.”<br />
<br />
********<br />
<br />
&#9835;Science Fiction. Double Feature. Dr. X will build a creature&#9835;<br />
“Please stop,” Frieda putting her hands to her ears in a vain attempt to drown out her mother’s singing; “I don’t want to hear anymore.”<br />
Frieda practically leapt out of her mother’s electric car as pulled into the driveway. Finding the movie cheesy to begin with; Frieda had a finger down the throat moment when her mother outright admitted to seeing said movie in the theater along with her father. The both dressing up as the characters Riff Raff and Magenta and engaging in spontaneous singing and dancing throughout the movie. Running through the estate; Frieda nearly runs over her father as she makes a mad dash up to her room.<br />
<br />
“What got into her,” Benton wondered as he headed towards the garage.<br />
&#9835;I knew Leo G. Carroll Was over a barrel&#9835;<br />
Benton hearing Amanda signing as he approached the garage door, made him pause for a moment.<br />
&#9835;When Tarantula took to the hills&#9835;<br />
“Let me know when you are about to jump to the left,” Benton opening the door; stopping Amanda and her spontaneous singing.<br />
“You heard,” Amanda looking like she was the cat that got caught with the canary.<br />
“Well when you left,” Benton stepping out of the way as Amanda rushed inside; “you were seething in rage as Lila was dining with us.”<br />
<br />
Amanda growled as she heard that name. Despite doing her best to remain civil; Amanda just can’t get over how much she loathes the were-tigress and that she is pregnant with Lance’s child.<br />
“Has she left,” Amanda’s mood doing a complete one eighty; “or is she still like there is no tomorrow?”<br />
“She left a little while ago,” Benton following Amanda to the kitchen; “Lance came by to take her home. The emergency session at the council finished about thirty minutes ago.”<br />
“Did Lance tell what they are doing with Jack Crawford,” Amanda grabbing a can of ginger ale from the fridge.<br />
“The Luna Brotherhood is stepping in to ensure Jack co-operates and doesn’t do anything stupid,” Benton replies; “Lance wouldn’t reveal any more than that despite my attempts to press him for information. But what he did let slip,” Benton pausing; “is that the head of the Luna Brotherhood is personally overseeing Jack Crawford.”<br />
“Did he say when the were-alert would end,” Amanda having yet to open up her soda and drinking it.”<br />
“Nope,” Benton answering; “I never got a chance to ask that. Lance got distracted when Lila started to feel sick he started to go all panic mode and rush her out.”<br />
“Probably more of that morning sickness,” Amanda shrugging; “or all the food she ate is coming back to haunt her. Pregnant or not; no one can eat all that pasta and not feel sick afterwards.”<br />
“You were like that when you were pregnant with Frieda,” Benton responding; “in fact if I recall you were raiding the fridge at all hours for yogurt and cold cuts.”<br />
“Apples and oranges,” Amanda finally taking a sip of her ginger ale; “now are we going to keep talking in here or do you want to go and watch the rest of The Rocky Horror Picture Show on tv?”<br />
“That is on,” Benton looking shocked; “well that explains you singing earlier.”<br />
“Frieda and Spencer were watching it,” Amanda putting her soda down; “and believe me I was surprised it was on as well.”<br />
“How far into the movie,” Benton asking; dreading the thought of having to suffer through Tim Curry’s opening number.<br />
“About halfway,” Amanda looking coy; “perhaps afterwards we’ll do…”<br />
“Nope,” Benton looking bemused; “it was bad enough you made me dress up to see that movie in the theatre. I’m not going to be roped into doing that dance like last time.”<br />
“I was thinking of letting you toucha toucha touch me,” Amanda looking sly; “I am feeling dirty.”<br />
“That I can do,” Benton perking up at the thought of a pre-bed romp.</p>
