<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Michelle watched her body excitedly as she felt the tingling of the magic pass through her. She couldn&#39;t wait to find out just what parts of her were so horribly flawed that they were keeping her away from the man of her dreams - and see them disappear in favor of total perfection. She glanced back at Nick&#39;s confused face long enough to notice that he seemed to be getting taller. Was that it? She needed to be a few inches shorter to be his ideal woman? Michelle shrugged, not caring that much about the minor loss of height. But now that she was paying attention to it, she seemed to be shrinking by a lot more than just a couple of inches...<br />
<br />
Before she could dwell on that thought for very much longer, though, she was distracted by the sudden, intense burning sensation that inflamed every part of her body. It was like her skin was covered in fire ants that were crawling and poking all over. Then she saw it - the hair that was rapidly growing out of her pores, thickening as it emerged and became a solid pelt of fur.<br />
<br />
Her whole body was reshaping itself in the meantime. With one sickening crack after another, bones disappeared and rearranged themselves deep inside her flesh, and Michelle naturally bent further and further forward until she was forced down onto her hands and knees. By the time she saw a long, thin tail swishing behind her, and felt its constant movements like it was an extension of her spine, the understanding had gotten through to her stunned, scared brain. She wasn&#39;t turning into an ideal woman. She was turning into a cat!<br />
<br />
How could this be happening? Was there a stray cat lying on the grass behind Nick, or somewhere in her field of vision, that she&#39;d accidentally glanced at while she was drinking the potion? No, that couldn&#39;t be right, she would remember something like that. She had no explanation for what could have caused the magic to go so wrong, but it kept on turning her into an animal anyway. Her clothes and her purse had magically disappeared somewhere along the way, so as the changes reached completion, she was standing on all fours, indistinguishable from anyone&#39;s pet. The remains of the small glass vial laid, crushed, on the pavement near one of her newly-formed paws. She looked up at Nick, who now towered over her dramatically shrunken form, and who was now leaning down with his giant face and saying something to her. She tried to call out to him.<br />
<br />
-----<br />
<br />
Nick watched it all happen in disbelief. Michelle, he had thought to himself, was a rather good-looking woman - it was too bad he could never force himself to have any attraction to humans. Then came something he would never have even thought to wish for. Watching her turn into an animal right before his very eyes - that was now the hottest thing he&#39;d ever seen in his life, real or fictional. And it wasn&#39;t lost on him that she looked just like his own pet cat, Tom. The only difference he could see was that Michelle was still female - reminding him of how many times he&#39;d wished he&#39;d adopted a female cat instead of Tom.<br />
<br />
He could never bring himself to mess with Tom&#39;s little barbed penis to fulfill his fantasies. He knew that it was wrong, what he wanted to do to that cat so badly. He never went further than masturbating while Tom happened to be curled up next to him... But Nick shook himself out of those thoughts quickly. They were giving him a powerful erection, and he was still in a public place. Plus, more importantly, something fantastically impossible had just happened right in front of him, and he needed to know what was going on.<br />
<br />
&quot;M-Michelle? Is that you?&quot;, he asked the small brown cat at his feet, which was frantically looking over itself in dismay. &quot;How did this happen?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nick!&quot;, the cat yelped in surprise, speaking in a small voice that could thankfully still be understood. &quot;I need your help! T-this wasn&#39;t supposed to happen! I got this little potion at this shop I found that turned out to be magical. But something must have gone wrong with it somehow!&quot;<br />
<br />
A magical shop? Nick wished he&#39;d been the one to discover something like that. All the impossible fantasies of his that could finally be fulfilled if he got his hands on potions like these - hopefully more deliberately than this. He would definitely have to ask Michelle where to find that shop, once whatever this was got straightened out. &quot;What was the potion supposed to do?&quot;, he asked her.<br />
<br />
&quot;It was... well...&quot; Michelle hesitated to answer. &quot;This is kind of embarrassing... The man at the shop told me it was a &#39;Dream Partner Potion&#39;! You drink it while making eye contact with somebody, and it turns you into the ideal partner for that person. I guess I, uh, should have just come clean about this, but I&#39;ve had the biggest crush on you for a while now, and I thought this would be the perfect way to get you to notice me. But I thought the potion would actually work, or at least not do anything at all - not go totally haywire and turn me into... this!&quot; Her long, thin tail subconsciously stepped in to cover for her lack of hands to gesture with, swooping around to point at the length of her new body.<br />
<br />
Nick&#39;s face, already pale from the shock, went a ghostly white. He knew he was fucked up, but he&#39;d never thought about it so bluntly before - his ideal sexual partner was an animal and not a human. Not even a furry hybrid creature, just a regular animal. To think that this magic had found him out and exposed his darkest secret, when he wouldn&#39;t have even admitted to himself that he was that perverted...<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, uh, wow, that can&#39;t be right,&quot; he stammered out, trying to act casual. &quot;I mean, I definitely thought you were pretty attractive beforehand, so that potion shouldn&#39;t have really done anything to you at all! Say, that guy didn&#39;t happen to, uh, give you any pointers on how to undo the magic from that thing, did he?&quot; He had to force himself to blink, his eyes were so wide, as he stared at the incredibly, distractingly beautiful feline at his feet.<br />
<br />
&quot;He told me the potion was permanent,&quot; Michelle answered. &quot;But I guess he must have given me the wrong potion, right? There must be a way to reverse this one. We just have to find the magic shop somehow - I mean, it disappeared the moment I stepped out, but it could come back at any moment. And then we can explain the problem to the guy and he&#39;ll sort it out!&quot;<br />
<br />
Nick forced himself to blink again. He did <i>not</i> want to be there at the moment when this woman simultaneously found out that her big crush was into bestiality and that she would be stuck as a cat for the rest of her life. His erection strained against his underwear at the very thought of it, but he knew the reality would be so much worse than the fantasy. He was expecting to get clawed in the face sometime very soon. As much as he wanted to play with those potions himself, maybe it was for the best if they never found that magic shop. Or if he didn&#39;t really try to help her with finding it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nick!&quot;, the cat got his wandering attention again. &quot;Nick, listen to me. I need you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot;, he said, surprised she would be so forward.<br />
<br />
&quot;I need you to take care of me until we get this fixed. I mean, you&#39;re the only person I would trust with this. Plus, you&#39;re the only person who saw it happen, so you don&#39;t need any convincing to believe that it&#39;s really me. Please! I can&#39;t go running around like a stray animal! And I already don&#39;t like the way that person&#39;s dog is looking at me...&quot;<br />
<br />
Nick reached down to pick up Michelle&#39;s shrunken form, careful not to let her rest in his lap where she might feel the boner in his pants. &quot;I guess I can take you back to my apartment for now,&quot; he said, waiting for the erection to go down before he tried to get up off the bench. &quot;Just until we find out how to undo it, right?&quot; If he wasn&#39;t careful, a mischievous glint was going to form on his face as he thought about it. &quot;I mean, I feel like it&#39;s sort of my fault, in an indirect way. So I&#39;m happy to help.&quot; She curled up in his arms, clearly - despite everything - feeling safe in his grasp.</p>
