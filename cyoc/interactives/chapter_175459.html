<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jonathan woke up to the sun shining in his face. It felt warm on his skin. But then Jonathan remembered closing all the blinds and curtains, so no light could pass through.<br />
<br />
His body jerked awake, seeing himself in his room. He fully remembered going to sleep on the couch, so why is he in his room.<br />
<br />
Jonathan hopped off his his bed and started walking. He noticed that he was a baby, and his diaper needed changing. “I should return to normal! It was 12 hours!” He thought. Suddenly he remembered applying the lotion twice, meaning he would be a baby till it was 5 in the afternoon.<br />
<br />
Slowly opening his door, he got a whiff of food being cooked downstairs. Suddenly, he realized what could have happened.<br />
<br />
He closed his door and looked everywhere in his room for his phone. He found it on his night stand charging. Opening it up, he saw multiple text messages and missed phone calls.<br />
<br />
Mom: George got sick so we are going home early<br />
<br />
Mom: 10 minutes away!! Hope you cleaned the place up <br />
<br />
After that, he had 50 combined missed calls from his mother and father.<br />
<br />
Mom: Jonathan you better answer the phone! <br />
<br />
Dad: I don’t know who you’ve fucked, but a grown grandchild is not the best Christmas present surprise.<br />
<br />
Mom: found your phone! Wherever you are, you won’t be needing this phone!<br />
<br />
Jonathan turned off his phone and looked around his room for his stuff. He needed to hide the lotion from his family before they used it. <br />
<br />
Searching high and low he was unable to find it in his room or the bathroom. He was in deep waters at this point.<br />
<br />
“Someone’s energetic this morning” a man said. Jonathan turned around to see his dad. A 6 foot tall man with a beard, bear gut and hair everywhere. It was like Bigfoot shaved, and the hair was growing back. <br />
<br />
His dad was wearing nothing but his underwear. Jonathan always felt awkward when his dad did this. Especially when he gave his special hugs.<br />
<br />
His dad came up to him and picked Jonathan up, “big bear hug!” He said. Jonathan hated this hug as a kid. His dad’s body hair always made the hug feel disgusting.<br />
<br />
Jonathan felt a hand on his diapered area. “Someone needs a changie wangie!” His dad said.<br />
<br />
Jonathan’s dad grabbed a towel and laid him down. He untaped Jonathan’s diaper and took it off him. He left with the dirty diaper, leaving Jonathan on the floor naked.<br />
<br />
A few moments later, he returned back with a box of diapers and changing supplies.<br />
<br />
Jonathan felt wipes and even powder applied to his private area. As he was getting changed, his dad thought it was a good idea to talk to him.<br />
<br />
“The guys in our family are proud for what we pack. You’ll grow it out soon!” He tickled Jonathan stomach, forcing him to laugh. He hated his treatment at the moment. If he actually had a son, Jonathan would not want his father to come out and say that he’d have a big dick. <br />
<br />
“There! All done!” He said. His dad lifted Jonathan up and put him on his shoulders. “Get ready! The trains leaving the station!” He said. Suddenly, Jonathan’s dad bolted out of his room and ran down the stairs while making train noises. He took him around the house and to each room as if they were on a tour.<br />
<br />
The “train ride” ended at the kitchen, where Jonathan’s mom was already wearing the present he got her. He was sat down in a chair while his dad walked over to his mom.<br />
<br />
“Did anyone answer about Jonathan?” His father whispered<br />
<br />
“No, they all said they haven’t talked to him in a while. Even his female friends don’t know where he is.” His mother answered<br />
<br />
“Well until he comes back, we have to be the greatest grandparents for this kid!”<br />
<br />
Jonathan knew he had smelt breakfast. He saw his dad hand him a plate of multiple things. Pancakes, bacon, eggs, and sausages. His mother even made the pancakes into little ducks.<br />
<br />
“Here you go bud! Eat up so you can be big and strong like paw paw!”<br />
<br />
His mother chucked, “paw paw?”<br />
<br />
“What? He has to have an easy way to remember his grandpa! He hasn’t even said a word yet!”<br />
<br />
Jonathan was already eating when he noticed his parents stare at him. His dad came up to him and asked, “Can you say paw paw?”<br />
<br />
Jonathan swallowed the food he had in his mouth, “Grandpa!” He said.<br />
<br />
“No come on! Say paw paw for me!”<br />
<br />
Jonathan shook his head no and continued eating. <br />
<br />
“He’s stubborn just like you!” His mother said. <br />
<br />
His parents got their plates and joined Jonathan with eating. His parents talked about what they planned to do with him if their son never came back, and even talked about getting the police involved. That was something Jonathan didn’t want to happen, but he also didn’t want his family to know the truth.</p>
