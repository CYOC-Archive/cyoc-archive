<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Oh, right,” I said.  “The hair care.  Maybe I should teach you something first,” I added.<br />
<br />
“What’s that?” Karyn asked.  I pointed at her cock.  “What’s to know about that?” she asked.<br />
<br />
I said, “Oh, fine, don’t listen to me.  See what happens if you get a wart or something.”  She looked at me <br />
with a bit of worry on her face.  “Just do the same thing you do to your tits,” I teased her.<br />
<br />
“Oh, ha ha, very funny,” she replied.  We bathed the rest of our bodies and we helped each other with some of <br />
the harder to reach areas.  Karyn resisted my attempts to arouse her again.  She protested that we’d had <br />
enough fun and needed to continue.<br />
<br />
Finally she showed me how to properly wash my, in her own words, more luxurious hair.  She said it was <br />
absolutely necessary to use separate shampoo and conditioner, unlike the combo type I normally used.  She made <br />
sure that I knew how to fully rinse out my hair so that all of the liquid washed clean.  <br />
<br />
Karyn turned off the shower and I started to leave it.  But she grabbed me by the elbow and told me that it <br />
was better to drip dry in the shower for a few moments first.  Once a sufficient time passed she left the <br />
shower but beckoned me to stay for a moment.  She grabbed a few towels out of a small closet and tossed one of <br />
them to me.  She instructed me to wrap it around my head and to make sure that I got all of my hair inside the <br />
towel.  She demonstrated it with her own hair, but I had a lot more hair than she, so she had to help me out a <br />
bit.  <br />
<br />
She dried off her body quickly and then finally permitted me to leave the shower.  She tossed another towel at <br />
me and I used it to dry off myself.  Once again she took me by the hand and we returned to her bedroom.  With <br />
an excited look on her face she sat me down on the bed and went back into the bathroom.  She returned with a <br />
blow dryer and a few hairbrushes.  <br />
<br />
Karyn spent the next several minutes thoroughly drying my hair.  She also made sure that it was properly <br />
brushed so that it wouldn’t get tangled.  She commented that it was as if I was her personal salon patron.  <br />
After she finished with my hair, she guided me through giving the same treatment to her own hair.  I had <br />
certainly never done this before and it felt a little like the first time I attempted to ride a bike.  To her <br />
credit she was extremely patient with me and told me I did a decent job.  That did not stop her from using the <br />
tools herself, however, in order to make sure it was to her own liking.<br />
<br />
“That’s your first lesson in femininity,” she said as she tossed the wet towels into the bathroom.  “I just <br />
remembered I’ll have to give you another one tomorrow,” she added.<br />
<br />
“What’s that?” I asked.<br />
<br />
“We still have fully female reproductive systems,” she said.  “And we’re of mature age, you know…”  She let <br />
her words tail off.<br />
<br />
“Oh boy,” I said when I realized what she meant.  “That should be fun.”  She laughed at me in an almost <br />
mocking manner.  As I tried to ignore her laughing at me, something else suddenly sprang into mind.  “Um, <br />
Karyn, do you think you have any of those pills?” I asked.<br />
<br />
“What pills?” she asked back.<br />
<br />
“Like the computer said,” I reminded her.  <br />
<br />
Her eyes widened.  “Oh, jeez,” she said.  “We both fucked each other.”<br />
<br />
“Right,” I said.  “So we both need one.”<br />
<br />
Karyn headed for the bathroom again.  Before she got there she stopped and turned around to face me.  “Do we <br />
though, Joey?”<br />
<br />
“Of course we do,” I said.<br />
<br />
“Well…would it be so bad?” she asked.<br />
<br />
“If we got pregnant?” I asked.  She nodded.  I was about to respond very negatively to her question.  But I <br />
hesitated.  I think I knew what she meant.  She figured that we were always going to be together.  At this <br />
point, I felt the same way.  Pregnancy was an inevitability.  <br />
<br />
“Well?” she asked impatiently.<br />
<br />
“Karyn,” I said, “you know we love each other.  You know we’re going to be together.  But do you really think <br />
this is the right time?  So soon, right away.  We still don’t know what else we have to learn about this <br />
world.  I think we need to wait.”<br />
<br />
She looked disappointed.  I was surprised.  We were both only 21 years old.  To me that was way too early an <br />
age to begin a family.  We still attended college, too.  And we weren’t married.  Did society still generally <br />
expect wedlock before procreation?<br />
<br />
“Promise me something then,” she said.<br />
<br />
“Anything,” I said.<br />
<br />
“Whenever that time comes, we try to do it together,” she said.  “We go through it at the same time.”<br />
<br />
I walked over to her and kissed her on the lips.  “Deal,” I said.<br />
<br />
She looked a little surprised.  “Deal?” she questioned me.<br />
<br />
“Deal,” I said.  She kissed me back.  “We’ll have twins of a different kind.”<br />
<br />
“In more ways than one,” she laughed.  I laughed since I knew she meant that we’d have children that would <br />
grow up in this combined sex world.  She went back into the bathroom.  I heard her go through the medicine <br />
cabinet.  She returned holding a small pill bottle.  “This has to be it,” she said as she handed it me.<br />
<br />
I looked at the bottle for confirmation.  “Prexnull,” I said aloud.  “For prevention of pregnancy.  Yep I’d <br />
say this is it.”<br />
<br />
“What a strange name,” Karyn said.<br />
<br />
“Could have been worse,” I said.  “Like Preg-Not or something.  We’ll have to remember to take them in the <br />
morning.  It even says not to take it so soon after sex.”<br />
<br />
“Something to look forward to,” joked Karyn.<br />
<br />
“Now I’m exhausted,” I said.  “Bed?”<br />
<br />
“Yea,” she agreed.  We climbed under the covers and wrapped our arms around each other.  “I love you, Joey,” <br />
she said.<br />
<br />
“I love you, Karyn,” I replied in kind.  We gave each other one last kiss and soon drifted off to sleep.</p>
