<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jack finished up cleaning off Soren’s cock, taking his time and giving him an extra lick up and down the whole length of his shaft for good measure. He looked up and wiped off his mouth, then saw something he hadn’t expected. Soren was avoiding his Jack’s gaze, and a blush from deep underneath his fur was turning the skin around his ears bright red. The big guy was huffing and breathing deeply, almost whimpering, in the aftermath of Jack’s blowjob.<br />
<br />
“Wow, I knew I was good, but not that good,” Jack muttered to himself. “Soren? What’s the matter, dude?”<br />
<br />
Soren narrowed his eyes and flattened his ears down against his head, the murmured something so quietly Jack could barely hear it. “…my first time…” was all Jack could make out clearly.<br />
<br />
“Say again, big guy?” Jack said, leaning over and gently stroking one of Soren’s pecs, circling a furry finger around one twitching nipple.<br />
<br />
“I said it was my first time, okay!?” Soren sputtered out, putting his big furry paws over his face. “Y-you didn’t even kiss me or anything…!” Technically, it mostly true; as a human, Sarah had obviously never had her cock sucked off, but her sex life had been pretty minimal except for a few boyfriends during college. Even after turning into a hulking, extremely masculine bear, having someone spring sex on her out of nowhere like this… well, it was a lot to take in.<br />
<br />
Jack raised an eyebrow, then he snickered a little, earning another embarassed glare from his roommate. “Wow, I never took you for such a romantic, Soren,” Jack teased. “You’re like a big ol’ teddy bear, aren’t you?”<br />
<br />
Taking the hint, Jack grinned and leaned in close, gently placing his muzzle against Soren’s and planting a soft kiss on his lips. “Soren, I might be a screw-up, but I’m glad to be teamed up with you this weekend,” Jack said with complete honesty. “I feel a lot better knowing I’ve got such a sweet guy watching my back.”<br />
<br />
Soren took a deep breath to regain his composure, then looked at Jack affectionately. “I appreciate it, Jack,” he said, experimentally leaning in and kissing Jack on the tip of his nose. “I think we’re going to make a good team here.”<br />
<br />
Until now, Jackie and Sarah had been letting things proceed on autopilot, sitting in the backs of Jack and Soren’s brains and enjoying the ride. However, the closer they became to one another, the more they felt themselves taking the reins themselves, realizing how much fun it was being Jack and Soren as they became lovers together. Offered a chance between their old lives and the new one they&#39;d been given for the weekend, they found themselves enjoying the exciting new life so much more.<br />
<br />
Jack blinked as he tried to sort out his feelings, no longer seeing any sign of Sarah in Soren’s face and instead seeing only the hulking and dependable (yet surprisingly sensitive and caring) bear. Likewise, Soren no longer saw Jack as a girlfriend at all, but instead as a fun-loving, passionate opossum who needed a strong boyfriend to help him find a little confidence. And it went without saying that the three men they had come to the camp with were no longer romantic interests in the least, but instead had become a real handful to deal with as they dealt with a flood of teenage hormones.<br />
<br />
A bit later, the bell for lunch rang out over the camp and they both seemed to have regained their composure. Soren stood up and pulled his shorts back up, while Jack checked the mirror to make sure he didn’t have any bear cum stuck in his fur. Once they were both satisfied, the headed outside holding hands, Soren giving Jack a quick peck on the top of the head as they walked down the path to the mess hall.<br />
<br />
However, they did not notice the orange fuzzball watching them from in the distance. Jared had snuck out of the medical cabin while the nurse was looking for a thermometer, intending to apologize to the two counselors for causing so much trouble. However, he found himself unable to approach them when he saw them holding hands and kissing. His striped tail whipped around as he looked on, not understanding why he felt so betrayed seeing the two counselors together. Jack was just a crush, right? A cool grown-up whose attention Jared craved… Right? Still, something in the back of Jared’s head made him think that Jack should mean so, so much more to him. Jared quietly followed after the two of them, desperate to get to the bottom of why he craved the handsome opossum’s affection so much…<br />
<br />
And, as always, Alex was watching over the group, frowning as he tapped his clipboard and trying to figure out what to do about this situation. At the end of the day, his job was to keep his campers happy, and while the others were settling in pretty well, Jared did not seem to be having a good time at Camp CritterCreek. Jack and Soren were well on their way to becoming a great team and possibly a long-term addition to the camp staff, Rick was dealing with his new memories well enough and enjoying his second childhood, and even Martin was enjoying the chance to let loose and wreak a little mischief as a horny little teen. They’d be fine, but Jared was well on his way to having a bad time, and Alex wasn’t going to let his perfect record get ruined that easily. He’d have to think of a way to cheer up the upset tiger and set him up for a great time this weekend, but he knew he was up for the job, especially with the magic of Camp CritterCreek at his side.</p>
