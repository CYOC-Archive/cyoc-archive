<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Nick!&quot; Luna spoke first before her mother could answer, &quot;what... what are you doing here?!&quot;<br />
<br />
There was surprise in her voice and it sounded fairly clear that she wasn&#39;t expecting company or necessarily wanted company. But in a sense, you and her were friends for years, and to you that made it acceptable for the two of you to come to visit. Of course, normal visits Vaxer household had normally been to discuss homework or various other things of that nature, and it was partially what lead to some of your attraction to Kellie, Luna&#39;s mom. For the middle aged woman had always looked fit and healthy, and in some ways, Luna looked like a younger version of her mother. Though those visits had generally been separate from Kellie who went about her day and you were often expected to head home before sunset on most nights. You&#39;d figured that that was Kellie wanting to protect her teenage daughter from teenage boy hormones.<br />
<br />
Little did she know that you were actually transgender. You were born male, but had always felt  that you should be female. In some ways it was why you had got along so well with Luna. She found out about this once the two of you got into high school and found out that you not only had some interest in things like make up, but also on how to use it. You eventually admitted it to her as Luna had been understanding and quite open regarding things. It was something you knew you wouldn&#39;t get from your father and that your step-mother, while having good intentions, couldn&#39;t really protect you from him growing up. In this doing homework with Luna had often been a form of escape from an overbearing and overly conservative father.<br />
<br />
That transgender issue was also a big part of what attracted you to the &quot;MILF-wolves.&quot; Everyone knew werewolves had existed, and in some ways could be fairly predatory. In the Middle Ages and Ancient world, it was largely thought to be a curse or some magical ailment, and stories of them were used as an object lesson to get people to behave. Yet, there then came odd stories that contradicted that narrative. There were supposed werewolves that came out of Lithuania or Latvia that said they fought witches, which puzzled church leaders who thought that werewolves would be in league with witches. Then came the story that broke all of it in the Beast of Gévaudan. The French village had been terrorized by a large wild animal for years. <br />
<br />
The French government&#39;s hunters went in to kill the beast and largely failed. They killed wolves in the area, but not the beast. It wasn&#39;t until the end when a nobleman, the Marquis d&#39;Apchier was attacked by the beast when a transformed werewolf came between the Marquis and the beast and then killed the beast. The werewolf then turned back into its human form of Jean Chastel and moved to care for the startled Marquis, informing him that he&#39;d been hunting the beast just as others had was never a threat to humans, particularly those that he found to be &quot;just.&quot; And while religion still played a role in 1767 when the incident occurred, many people couldn&#39;t buy into the whole &quot;curse&quot; issue given that Chastel wasn&#39;t linked to any murders or anything truly &quot;dark,&quot; and that Chastel ultimately said that he&#39;d been born with lycanthropy, first transforming on or around his eighteenth birthday. This then lead to the supposition that lycanthropy was more a disease rather than a mystical curse.<br />
<br />
The confirmation of the disease hypothesis came in the early 1900s when a werewolf who during the day worked in one of the largest medical research facilities in London. He found it to be a rather unique virus that was in a family all its own, though it was noted to spread in various ways, most often through family lines, but also through bites, sex, or through blood transfusions, which actually lead to massed increase in the world&#39;s werewolf population during the World Wars. The most truly bizarre part of the discovery was that the virus didn&#39;t kill those infected, but rather had a more mutagenic affect and in time lived in symbiosis with the host. It was only in the last twenty years or so that the werewolf virus, &quot;Lycanthropus Chastellus,&quot; mutated to create the &quot;MILF-wolf&quot; variant, including age changes for all women and gender changes, as well, for any man that was infected. The only ones that seemed to be immune to the &quot;MILF-wolf&quot; variant were those werewolves that had the original strain.<br />
<br />
You had learned about these things going through high school, as it was considered part of the standard science courses and in a way to help keep people safe, as not everyone even wanted to be normal werewolves, let alone MILF-wolves. However, that gender change aspect was something that struck you as something that would solve your issues with gender identity. Your father wouldn&#39;t understand and wouldn&#39;t pay for the sort of surgery needed for you to become what you felt yourself to be, but being with a MILF-wolf would fix that. You&#39;d become female and would be what you felt you should be. Luna listened and loosely accepted that part, though she also seemed distant about it. And that brought you back to her surprise and seeming frustration as you&#39;d come into the Vaxer home to find your friend there before her mother, already a fully transformed MILF-wolf.<br />
<br />
&quot;I was just...&quot; you began to say, &quot;I mean... you know more about me... who I am. And well, with all the reports that the MILF-wolf strain has been spreading in this area. I was wanting to see if you were okay and if your mother could help.&quot;<br />
<br />
That got Luna to blink with some surprise, surprise you didn&#39;t expect. To your other side, Kellie&#39;s presently gold eyes also blinked with surprise. It was like neither of them expected you to say that or something like that.<br />
<br />
&quot;You told him about me? About us?&quot; Kellie asked to Luna, which made you blink in surprise. It made you ignore where Luna&#39;s hands drifted to her sides for a moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; Luna answered her voice becoming slightly deeper and &quot;mature,&quot; though you weren&#39;t sure if that was the word to use. Luna turned 18 a few days ago.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then why has he come in... after &quot;curfew&quot; and saying he was hoping I could help because of MILF-wolfs being around?&quot; Kellie questioned her daughter, &quot;of course if he wants to become a MILF-wolf, I can help with that... and so can you... but we don&#39;t go around shouting it to the world. To a degree even the normal werewolves like their privacy.&quot;<br />
<br />
This was more a parent interrogating a child, which had you more perplex than anything else, even as you noticed that Luna was clutching at her sides and starting to sweat a little. Minor creases were forming at the edge of her lips and going up her cheeks toward her nose. It was almost as if Luna was actually starting to age rapidly, though you hadn&#39;t seen her do anything with her mother that would cause her to become a MILF-wolf like her mother had become.<br />
<br />
&quot;And I kept it,&quot; Luna managed to grit out as her eyes flashed yellow for a moment and a stand or two of grey appeared in her normally blond hair, &quot;he&#39;s just had an interest in MILF-wolves since we had that mandatory class about them in freshman year of high school.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Can I ask why?&quot; Kellie turned to you and drawing your attention away from Luna for moment, though she also seemed to give off a moan as her hands drifted from her sides up to her chest where her breasts were starting to swell underneath her shirt. As if they were growing to match the massive furry breasts that Kellie had out in the open.<br />
<br />
The more protective tone from Kellie was enough to get you to back up a bit, as while werewolves weren&#39;t necessarily the mindless monsters or psychopathic serial killers that some stories told, they could be predatory and powerful, MILF-wolves included. And you could see the long glistening fangs in Kellie&#39;s muzzle, and while you may have wanted to become a MILF-wolf to match your gender identity, that didn&#39;t mean you wanted to be bitten and have something half as long as your thumb piercing your skin. That would hurt, and with Kellie now advancing toward you with her triangular ears alert and teeth bared, that indicated that Kellie wasn&#39;t interested in sex  or any of the ways that MILF-wolves spread their strain of the &quot;were virus&quot; at the moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry... I&#39;m... I&#39;m,&quot; you stuttered and tripping back to land on your but, barely noticing Luna straining to get out of her her shirt as her growing breasts broke the straps of the C cup bra she normally wore, &quot;transgender... physically, I was born male, but I never really felt &quot;male.&quot; That&#39;s why... becoming a MILF-wolf... while being aged into my thirties wouldn&#39;t necessarily what I want, being female IS.&quot;<br />
<br />
That got Kellie to stop her advance and her lips slid back down to cover her teeth. That let you relax a bit, though Kellie remained between you and Luna for the moment. Looking past Kellie, you noticed that Luna was now reaching down with now claw tipped fingers and was actually pulling her pants and panties apart. Her face was far more mature looking, which fit the sort of build that MILF-wolves had in their human form and fit what many held a MILF to look like, even if the woman wasn&#39;t a MILF-wolf. They looked mature enough that you knew they weren&#39;t physically in their teens or twenties, but yet much of their bodies still looked as though they could be in their twenties. You thought you could see blond patches of fur starting to grow across her body, with some small speckles of gray fur mixed in.<br />
<br />
&quot;I see...&quot; Kellie said slowly, &quot;well, I suppose that could make sense. And this world has all sorts of changes in the last twenty years or so. The were virus mutated when an adult werewolf, sick with some other disease, nipped a pregnant woman on the boob.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Whatever happened to her?&quot; you asked noticing more of Luna&#39;s changes behind her mother as her body was covered in fur, her feet lengthening to allow a digitigrade stance and her muscles rippling with added power.<br />
<br />
&quot;I bopped him on the head for pretty much falling onto me,&quot; Kellie smiled, &quot;he didn&#39;t mean to... and turning into a MILF-wolf felt good, but that didn&#39;t mean the bite, however accidental, didn&#39;t hurt. Though I didn&#39;t know it at the time that any human male I was with soon became a MILF-wolf too. It also meant that when Luna was born... she was destined to become a MILF-wolf on or after her eighteenth birthday.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kellie then stepped back and gave you a full sight of Luna. Her teeth were changing and enlarging, with her canines beginning to lengthen into real fangs while her face began to push forward into an actual muzzle. Her ears moved up to the top of her head and a tail was beginning to wag its way out behind her. It was a lot to process. By the way Kellie had spoken, it sounded like Kellie wasn&#39;t the latest person infected with the present MILF-wolf strain of the were virus, but the first MILF-wolf and thus every other MILF-wolf could be traced back to her, or someone that had had contact with her. It also meant that Luna was born a MILF-wolf... and you watched as Luna gave a triumphant howl as her tail finished growing behind her, and now looking almost like a blond furred clone of her mother.<br />
<br />
&quot;But... you were...&quot; you stuttered in some surprise.<br />
<br />
&quot;I didn&#39;t transform on my eighteenth birthday... which wasn&#39;t what we expected,&quot; Luna said voice, her voice clearly more mature. Different from Kellie&#39;s but definitely mature, &quot;which was why that party was family only. Me. My mom, here, and by dad, Roxie.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Isn&#39;t she your Aunt?&quot; you asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, Roxie was my husband,&quot; Kellie explained, &quot;and given that I didn&#39;t know or realize that the were virus had mutated in the sick werewolf that bit me, I didn&#39;t realize my husband would become a MILF-wolf after I had sex with him. So... we had sex, Rook became Roxie and we&#39;ve sort of lived as &quot;sisters&quot; on the surface to have more MILF-wolf fun at night. Often with each other and at times when a normal werewolf comes into town, we both get him.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re still attracted to men?&quot; you asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, of course,&quot; Kellie answered, &quot;my marriage and fun with Roxie is based on the fact that I fell in love with Rook. Him becoming a her didn&#39;t change that love. I suppose you could say I became a bit bi-willing as a MILF-wolf, as did Roxie. And given everything else we know about werewolves in general... we expected Luna to have her big night when she turned eighteen... but that didn&#39;t happen. Roxie was content to wait... but I got a bit impatient, and that&#39;s what you walked in on.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And where is Roxie now?&quot; you asked, thinking on the equally voluptuous woman that you thought was Kellie&#39;s sister but was actually her transformed husband.<br />
<br />
Kellie turned one ear toward the backyard of the Vaxer home, &quot;I would imagine that since she could wait for Luna&#39;s MILF-wolf goodness to come out on its own accord, she&#39;s probably gone off for her own fun... or to see if that klutz of a werewolf that bit me is in town... he&#39;s actually quite good when it comes to pleasing two horny MILF-wolves. I think I&#39;ll go join them...&quot;<br />
<br />
You watched as Kellie moved to head toward the back of the house. She reached one doorway and then looked over her shoulder, &quot;Nick... if you really want to be a MILF-wolf... to be in the gender you feel is the right one... I leave that to Luna... who I think already loves you. At least from what I&#39;ve seen from you two growing up together as such good friends. It&#39;d be better than worshiping the feet of someone else&#39;s mother. And Luna... when you and Nick are done, come show Roxie the new MILF-wolf you.&quot;<br />
<br />
With that, Kellie left  and you were left sitting on the floor of the living room with the now transformed Luna before you. In many ways, she now ticked many of the boxes that had attracted you to her mother, and the others would be true in her human form. Though for right now, Luna was there in the physical form of a voluptuous 35 year old wolf woman, even if she was only eighteen in terms of her actual age. She came over and soon sat beside you while you wondered on what would happen next...</p>
