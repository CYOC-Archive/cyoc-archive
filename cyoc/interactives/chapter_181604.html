<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Two months had passed in the virtual world, and by now you were heavily disconnected from at the very least the time in the real world compared to the time cycles in the game. After you were transformed the kobolds used magic from their shamans to bind your arms behind your back and your legs up against your belly with your knees together, putting you in the fetal position. You were taken to a cave deep within the forest, and deep inside of it was a nexus that broke off into various caves and passages and you were placed in one all alone inside of a nest. Your loneliness however wouldn&#39;t last long since several males walked on in and grinned at you whipping their reptilian twin cocks out.<br />
<br />
The following weeks would be nothing but constant breeding for you where male kobolds stuffed their cocks in your mouth, up your tailhole, and deep into your pussy, and of course none of them pulled out all the whilst treating your body like a toy. With the taste of male cum stained in your mouth after the first few weeks a group of females waked on in and removed the spell binding your arms and legs. However by now you were broken, hopeless, and you had a small round bulge in your belly from the males from before. So you just watched the females and allowed them to have their way with you.<br />
<br />
The females much like the males used your body like a toy, and spoke in a strange tongue you didn&#39;t understand. The females while they enjoyed smothering your face with their breasts, asses, and thighs, seemed to be more respectful to you... to a degree at least. They taught you how to understand their language, and used magic to help you learn faster. One of them outright apologized for the first batch of males and stated they were only so rough with you to break you in for the others. This of course didn&#39;t come without its price since while they provided nourishment to you, you also had to get down and dirty with many of them in order to receive such gifts. In addition to this most nourishment came in the form of a cooked animal leg or two, water, and on a few strange occasions one of the females would plant your mouth up against her bosom and nurse you.<br />
<br />
The females stayed with you for another few weeks and you noticed your belly getting bigger with every passing day, and you started eventually feeling slight pains every now and then. After becoming fluent with their tongue, draconic, you started asking questions like,&quot;Why did you do this?&quot; and,&quot;What do you want from me?&quot; To which a number of females simply replied,&quot;A sex slave,&quot; which at first disheartened you, but then a different female explained that intercourse was one of few ways kobolds entertain themselves in the caves, and they urged you to accept your role with optimism. One of the females told you,&quot;Back when you were being fucked wasn&#39;t there a sense of satisfaction~? A rush of happiness from your loins~? That is what makes your position so great, some even envy you!&quot;<br />
<br />
You would think back to when you were stuffed with cocks, having the taste of ass, male and female cum memorized or rather stained into your mind and tongue by now. At first you were apprehensive, but you accepted the males and females and part of you... enjoyed that rush of release of pleasure, having some creature toy with you, build up your instincts to breed only for them to pleasure you enough to make you climax... it was like nothing you ever felt before. She of course afterwards had a nice hot make-out session with you and fucked you silly but you approached it differently, and actively engaged in sex this time.<br />
<br />
A few days after this packs of males and females would show up and you would start participating more and more in intercourse, and it not only felt good, orgasmic, and pleasurable yet dirty, but.... comforting. You started to feel like you had been accepted into a new life, a new culture, a new family. You started getting to know other kobolds by name, identifying them by scale color, features, eye color, but also their scent and musk they gave off. Then, one week ago it happened, your belly was so full you could hardly stand, you could barely walk or crawl. Then when one of the males from the original pack that fucked you relentlessly for the first few weeks came in you felt a large pain inside of your womb and cried out loudly. This garnered the attention of several other kobolds lined up to exchange food for favors, and while you had no clue what was going on, it seemed that many of them did.<br />
<br />
The male would sit you up on his lap, taking your hands as two females rushed in, one shoving a gag in your mouth while the other spreading your legs. You felt confused, scared, but then the make uttered a single word in your ear that triggered a motherly side of your instincts to kick in, which was,&quot;Push,&quot; As soon as you heard this you bit down on the gag as hard as you could, squeezing the male&#39;s hand and pushing with all you had as several large objects moved through your birth canal. The female at your legs was ready to catch and she said,&quot;Count, no focus on pain, just count,&quot; to which you nodded as you snarled loudly, digging your claws into the male&#39;s hand as a huge large round object parted your pussy lips and exited with what you could only describe as a plop... a large wet plop.<br />
<br />
It was a large round egg with an exterior resembling the scales of a kobold, your scales, but you only had a split second to realize this before the next started to come out. Taking the females advice you snarled and just pushed, thinking to yourself as you screamed through the gag,&quot;Twwwwwo...!&quot; Then you felt a second wet plop and it was out, and not nearly as difficult as the first egg. You felt there was still more to come though, so you continued to count and push regardless of the pain and soon there were 5 eggs sitting in front of you, two of which had exteriors resembling the color of your scales, one of which resembling the scales of the male holding you now, and the other two resembling some of the other males who bred you on that day. You weren&#39;t sure how each egg could have a different father, but then you remembered that cheetahs back in your world could bear kittens from multiple males at once and assumed it was something like that.<br />
<br />
Two healer shaman would rush in after you laid your clutch and started applying healing magic to you, and the male from before stayed with you as the two females ran out and told the others lined up what just happened. Many of the kobolds who were here to exchange food for favors with you decided to just leave their food in your den for the day and as you laid in the males lap and regained your strength, you were being nursed once more by one of the shamans. The rest of the day you spent curled around your eggs before the male took them away to an incubation room and promised to guard them with his life, to which you simply nodded to him. <br />
<br />
___<br />
<br />
It was now three days after you have given birth to your first clutch, two months after transforming initially into a kobold, and thanks to the healers your body was fully healed and fertile again. You were now catering to a pair of kobold brothers, happily holding one&#39;s twin cocks in your mouth while the other thrusted in and out of your cunt lovingly. You have grown to love the taste of cocks, cunts, and even tailholes, but today you have been told you would be offering your favors to a guest... something that wasn&#39;t a kobold. This had you excited to no end and it didn&#39;t take you long to climax before the brothers filled your mouth and womb with their seeds, and pulling out after that and allowing their cum to drip all over your body.<br />
<br />
&quot;See you soon sweetheart~ Good luck with the guest~&quot; The one who filled your mouth spoke in draconic and kissed your cheek as you swallowed his seed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do send for me if you end up with a nice sized clutch like before~&quot; The other added before rubbing your plump thighs and rear.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m always here boys, come back anytime~&quot; You purred seductively in response having grown to love and cherish your role as you rubbed your thighs and slowly stood up on your weak legs with dripping milky breasts from when you were heavily pregnant just a few days ago. You couldn&#39;t wait to meet whoever was coming over, and they were going to use you too. How big would they be? Would they be a man with a fat cock, or a woman with a figure like yours? Would they be small and sissy, big and dominant, or something mixed between those two~? Either way you started munching down on a leg of lamb the two had left for you, tearing off huge chunks of meat from it as you waited with anticipation and drooling cunt.<br />
<br />
Who was this guest~?<br />
<br />
(Feel free to add on any species ya like, and the reason I didn&#39;t add the Loch Ness and Plesiosaurs as mentioned earlier is because they are aquatic and would be a bit out of place in a cave.)</p>
