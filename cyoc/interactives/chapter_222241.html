<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">His paws were damp as he walked through the aftermath of revenge, arms and limbs scattered in all directions, the gravel riverbank coated in blood, splatters of blood and organs on the trees and bushes and a trail of red running down the river as a severed head lay in the once clear waters, in his old life Antonio would have been horrified to the point of vomiting at the sight of such a massacre, but in this world his will and stomach were much stronger, if anything he took pride in the slaughter before him, it meant that his empire was free of intruders once more.<br />
<br />
The Chameleman chief then clambered up Antonios paw, the big cat raising his paw to his face as the lizard took a knee, looking down at the ground &quot;my lord, the beast and the rider have been detained, and the hunting party has been set on their way home with their haul&quot;<br />
For a creature so small the lizard chieftain never failed any task that Antonio set him or his people<br />
&quot;Very good Akron, you may return to the den, leave a handful of your warriors here while I decide what to do with the driver and their captured cargo&quot; Antonio grunted, the Chameleman nodded before he vanished from sight, his skin shifting colour to match his surroundings perfectly, the first time Antonio had seen this Skill, he was tempted to consume one of their tribe, to add the skill to his own, however he decided against it, finding shadow movement to be far superior for a creature like himself.<br />
<br />
The big cat then turned his attention to the mole rat creature, the structure atop it&#39;s back now ripped from its body and laying on the riverbank, it&#39;s struggling body pinned under another Iron silk net, it&#39;s ends being held down by the four nightmare wolves, their strength seeming to have increased ten fould after their feast on the human slavers, with a grin Antonio picked up a severed hand in his maw before swallowing it whole, his fangs now coated red and dripping from the corners of his mouth, but something didn&#39;t feel right, the blood tasted wrong, nothing like any prey he had taken down in his time in this world, his thoughts were interupted however as he acquired his new skills<br />
SKILLS: Berserker, Grasp heart, Demon summon, Hellfire seed ACQUIRED<br />
Antonio was confused by these skills until he watched as the severed body parts shifted from a bloody human appearance to a twisted crimson form, long black claws on a hand, seven black hearts in the open ribcage of another, these creatures were definitely not human they were Changelings, creatures from hell, the lowest firm of the demonic race, his attention immediately snapped to the rider, the human now had an impossibility wide grin on his face, his eyes now black, staring right at Antonio as he stood up with relative ease, the net over his body turning to ash as he rose, his bones coul be herd crunching and cracking , his legs extending and his knees snapping in reverse, his arms elongated, breaking through his human skin, revealing a twisted crimson set of arms, long black spikes emerging from it&#39;s elbows and two long clawed fingers that dragged on the floor as the creature leaped down onto the ground, his cloven feet leaving the stones as red hot coals as he walked, the beast then reached up and clawed at its human face and clothing, setting them ablaze revealing the creatures true face, a bat like head with no eyes, a mouth full of jagged teeth and a set of curved Horns from the back of its skull, a row of spines along it&#39;s back, long and thin in all directions.<br />
&quot;Comrades you slay, Kitty must pay, Nero will slay!&quot; The raspy voice of the beast shrieked as it charged Antonio reaching forward on it&#39;s knuckles and dragging itself forward at an alarming pace.<br />
WARNING, ATTACK IMMINENT: SKILL: Noir Guardian, Berserker ACTIVE<br />
Antonio braced himself for impact, when the sound of something solid hitting something metallic echoed across the forest, opening his eyes with a growl Antonio could still feel his body vibrating and ringing from the demons strike, his black coat now glistening metallically in the sunlight, the demon held his head as it stumbled back<br />
&quot;Head ring, bells sing, screams sing&quot; it madly chuckled, Antonio had had enough of this demons rambling letting out a mighty roar as he charged the demon, raising his paw as he swiped his claw across its face, his pad making contact and sending the demon crashing into the woods, taking out several trees before a flock of birds scattered in the near distance, signaling the four nightmare wolves to return with the captured creature Antonio gave chase to the demon.<br />
<br />
The woods seemed to darken as he approached the broken tree where he expected to see the creatures mangled corpse, however what he found was the tree splintered and broken, with one of the creatures arms roped off at the shoulder, hanging in the splintered wood, staining the tree black with it&#39;s blood, it was still alive though as he followed a trail of black blood up a neerby tree, Antonio was now on high alert, his Noir guardian and Sense heat source skills now active, scanning the treetops and listening for the slightest sound.<br />
<br />
Was that the wind?, No not the wind, as the whispering sound of a laugh rushed past his ear, then the other side &quot;come on you ugly fucker, I don&#39;t have all day, COME ON!&quot; He roared, grinning when a twig snapped behind him, the demon let out a chilling scream as it lunged from the treetops it&#39;s gangly arm reaching out and slicing across his back, but the beast didn&#39;t get away unscathed, as it&#39;s claws raked his back, Antonio turned and slammed jus fangs down on the demons arm, ripping the creature from the air and slamming it into the ground, before pinning it&#39;s head with his paw, then driving it through the creatures skull and into the now blood drenched earth.<br />
<br />
Antonio took a moment to catch his breath, wincing in pain from the cuts on his back, then removing his paw from the creatures cracked skull, ripping what remained off the body and lumbered back to the den.<br />
