<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Robert ran to the restroom and threw up in the toilet. He was scared and excited at the same time. With this ring he could bend the aspects of reality. He could be young again, and fit, and handsome. He walked out of the stall and looked at himself in the mirror.  If he was gonna investigate the football team he might want to look more like a football player. Instead of saying his transformation this time he thought it internally. He noticed his head hair was coming back. His old hair color of dark brown was coming back. The grey and sliver disappeared. The amounts of chest hair receded to a small about in between his pectorals. His fat around his legs, arms, face, chest, stomach, and back receded. Muscles started to form around his body. He grew taller by three inches. His shoulders broadened. His face became chiseled. His member even grew. His hair reformed to a modern cut short on the sides and longer and styled in the middle. He was still in his old cloths though. He willed his cloths to change to a more younger style. His dress paints formed into jeans and his dress shirt became a tight t-shirt that showed his muscles. His fancy shoes became vans and a brand new watch appeared on his left wrist. He walked out into the halls. He made his way to the gym. He changed everyone mind in the class that he was in that class and kept his name. The teacher ordered everyone to change for PE. He made a gym uniform appear in his locker and was ready to go. Rob felt weird that everyone thought this was so normal. He had a feeling that at any moment people would not recognize him. PE was about as bad as he could remember from back in the day. They played some football and basketball. He got to try out his built body and he even started to remember who was on the team with him in the PE class. Along with a few of the plays from practice. It was if his mind was adjusting too.<br />
<br />
He could remember how Daniel was left handed. He knew that Stephen was slower because he tore his ACL six months ago. Rob was really starting to like this new ring. He went though the rest of the day with little trouble. Whenever there was a problem he used his ring, just like that. He finally made it to the end of the day which meant one thing; Practice. He made his way back to the locker room. And started to get ready for practice. <br />
<br />
While he was nearly naked except for his compression shorts his teammate Benny came up to him. &quot;Hey why aren&#39;t you in line for your milkshake?he asked.<br />
Robert quickly tried to will the ring to answer the question but for some reason he couldn&#39;t. <br />
&quot; I agh had to shit first and I guess I forgot.&quot; he lied hoping Benny would take the bait. <br />
&quot; Oh well, hurry before all the juniors get your creme. I&#39;ll tell Lamar your first after Daniel is done.&quot; he asked and turned the corner.<br />
Rob had to see what all the fuss was about. he turned the corner to see all his teammates lined up. The line was composed of 2/3s of the seniors all of the juniors and the sophomores and freshman to the end. Even the freshmen while few in number looked extremely old and built for their age. Even the two 8th graders who barely made it had biceps thicker than a grapefruit. At the front of the line the biggest person Rob had ever seen was being serviced by Daniel. Lamar was about as black as black coffee, Huge muscles were packed on to his 7.5 feet body. His massive tree trunk arm had a hold of Daniel&#39;s blonde hair. He thrusted his 18 inch pole down his throat. Suddenly his big melon balls gave way and shot a gallon of cum down his throat. <br />
<br />
The rings power must have had a delay. Rob suddenly remembered what was going on. Lamar was generous to let every person on the team suck him off before practice and games so that his power could be delivered to us. Daniel even looked a tiny bit bigger and taller after he finished wiping his mouth. Lamar pointed a fat finger at Rob and motioned for him to get down. Rob suddenly couldn&#39;t control his legs and felt himself kneeling down in front of his wet hot member.<br />
<br />
In a deep voice&quot; Where were you Rob your usually first or second? Don&#39;t worry because you do such a good job imma give you more than David who was first cause you my favorite.&quot; He grabbed his hair and shoved his dick right down his throat. His whole body was working on his own. He wanted to spit it out but his tongue and throat had a sense of their own. He licked his shaft and cradled his balls while Lamar&#39;s massive fingers thrusted his head back and forth. He could feel the pressure rising in his balls and his pecker was getting really hot. Soon gallons of cum shot down his throat and into his belly. He tried couching but he found himself licking the seamen off the tip. He got up and wiped his mouth he felt his belly. He was defiantly bloated. But their was a certain electricity in that seed. He felt himself getting a little taller and more muscular. He moved away from Lamar but a bright flash struck him in the eye. He noticed a glint of mental on Lamar&#39;s hand. It was a silver ring just like his.</p>
