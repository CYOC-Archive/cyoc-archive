<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>I love this series and would love to see more stories with it.. so please anyone wishing to add to it do it, because there is so much potential. I&#39;m not a great writer, I only wanted to bring some atention to this amazing story idea. </div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Drew could not believe what was happening, except that he saw it with his own eyes: body swapping was real. <br />
<br />
He sometimes wondered about what would it be like to be someone else, but nevertheless, he was happy in his own body. He wasn&#39;t the most muscular guy in the room but his body wasn&#39;t at all bad. He spent many years practicing yoga and jogging regularly, which rewarded him with a toned twinkish body. Arthur on the other hand was quite athletic, being an expert swimmer. Drew still remembers the first time he saw him in his speedo after practice: his messy wet hair dripping on his big pecs, his amazing six-pack, and the big bulge in his green speedos. <br />
He knew Arthur was his soulmate and that he would do anything for him. <br />
<br />
Which is how he ended up on this mysterious cabin trip. Arthur promised it would be fun, but he never expected this. His thoughts were interrupted by Arthur: &quot;Drew, I know you are nervous, just go with it and I promise you&#39;ll have fun. Now, let&#39;s go it&#39;s our turn to pick the presents!&quot;. Arthur was right, he might as well enjoy the experience. He looked around the room and noticed that most of the people were in great shape, he was really excited at the idea of ending up in a muscular body. <br />
<br />
Arthur grabbed his hand and dragged him to the pile of presents under the Christmas tree: &quot;You pick first, good luck!&quot;. &quot;Thanks, babe! I guess I&#39;ll take this one!&quot;. He picked up a big neon green box. &quot;Great choice! I&#39;ll take the little white box that was next to yours,&quot; said Arthur with a big smile. Drew suspected that Arthur knew something that he didn&#39;t, but he shrugged it off for now. <br />
<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s go to the bathroom and change because it&#39;s your first time I&#39;ll join you,&quot; said Arthur. You made your way to the bathroom and Arthur followed you in. You noticed that a hot man in a red sweater, which you remember as being Alf, Arthur&#39;s uncle, was looking at you as you entered. You hoped that it was because he recognized the box in your hand. You got really enthusiastic about the idea of transforming into him. He was really hot, you only noticed him in a passing glance but even that was enough to see the bulging muscles hiding underneath that sweater. <br />
<br />
You quickly opened the green box and took out a t-shirt that was too small to be Alf&#39;s. You quickly became disappointed. You took everything out of the box: a red t-shirt, a pair of black athletic shorts and some grey.  trunks. You preferred boxer briefs because they offer full coverage. You looked at Arthur with a miserable look on your face. &quot;I know babe, but you never know... Maybe on your new body, trunks will fit really well. Based on the athletic clothes, I guess you got one of my cousins, not sure which one until you transform. My turn now!&quot;. You looked at Arthur as he opened the small blue box, from inside he took out a pair of white briefs. &quot;O hell no!.. I hope this is a joke and it&#39;s not grandpa&#39;s briefs,&quot; said Arthur with an annoyed look on his face. The idea of Arthur turning into an old man amused you. &quot;What do we do now, how do we transform?&quot;. &quot;You just need to put on the clothes and touch the stone next to the mirror. You will transform instantly with no pain.&quot; said Arthur. You looked at the trunks in the green box, and decided to put them on. You touched the stone and a green light filled the room. &quot;Did it work?&quot; you said as you noticed that your voice was different. &quot;Sweet! You got cousin Shawn, he was a star quarterback in high school, and a gym freak.&quot; <br />
You looked at your body in the mirror and noticed your muscles for the first time. Your pecs were huge, you started touching them and you felt a strange sensation. You started bouncing your pecs. &quot;Wow, this is so cool, Arthur you have to touch them, they are so soft yet if I flex they become really hard, I&#39;ve never felt something so strange.&quot; &quot;Calm down tiger, we&#39;ll have enough time to explore that body this week, especially that monster growing inside those trunks,&quot; said Arthur with a grin on his face. You looked down and started to blush because you were growing an erection in your trunks, that didn&#39;t leave anything for the imagination, this guy was huge. <br />
<br />
&quot;Now let&#39;s see if my hunch was correct,&quot; said Arthur who was already in the white briefs. The familiar green light filled the room, then you gasped when you saw Arthur&#39;s new body. &quot;Great! I&#39;m not my grandpa&quot; said Arthur while laughing. &quot;Babe, you are your uncle Ash, you are so hot now&quot;. You examined every inch of Ash&#39;s body. His muscles were more defined than Shawn&#39;s, his pecs were huge covered in fur, he had an 8-pack and those white briefs were too small for his body, they outlined his dick perfectly. &quot;Yes, this is my uncle&#39;s body.. He&#39;s also Shawn&#39;s father. I picked a box next to the one you chose hoping something like this would happen. I have to say, I was a little scared when I saw only a pair of white briefs... But I guess Ash just wants someone to expose his body, so he can get praise from the family...&quot; He started flexing in the mirror &quot;I have to say, these white briefs are too small and really uncomfortable. Also being covered in body hair will get some time to get used to.&quot; explained Arthur. &quot;So you are my dad or my new body&#39;s dad. Will that make things strange between us?&quot; wondered Drew. <br />
&quot;No don&#39;t worry. Taboo swaps are more common than you think. No one will judge us if we continue to be romantic toward each other, some people would be turned on by it. Also, I&#39;m not missing the opportunity of getting fucked in this hot body, this daddy needs a dick in his ass. But if you are uncomfortable we can keep things mild, maybe just jerk each other or something.&quot; said Arthur with a sympathetic voice. &quot;I&#39;m not sure yet. Your new body is really hot and turns me on, but the idea of you being my current dad is too strange. I don&#39;t want to ruin your fun, but I&#39;m not sure I&#39;m ready yet&quot;. &quot;No problem babe, we&#39;ll take things slow, and see where we end up. Just know that I love you and after this week nothing will stop us from showing each other how much we love one another. Now let&#39;s go outside, I&#39;m sure everyone is excited to see our new bodies.&quot; said Arthur. <br />
We exited the bathroom, only in our underwear. &quot;A father-son swap!! Lucky guys indeed! Have fun in those hot bodies boys!&quot; said the man in charge of the event. I was blushing, my erection still being visible and Arthur&#39;s dick almost ripping the small briefs. Arthur started to flex a bit, while the crowd clapped and whistled at him, he stopped soon afraid not to rip his briefs. While we made our way to the table I noticed that the real Ash had a big grin on his face, and was looking really proud of his exposed strong body across the table. Shawn was looking down at his phone, not a little bit embarrassed of his almost naked body parading in the room. <br />
<br />
After arriving at the table I was having a hard time calming my erection, mostly because Arthur in Ash&#39;s really hot and nude body was next to me. My attention was caught by the real Ash, who finally got his turn for the swap. When he exited, everyone started to cheer. He was dressed in a tight blue -shirt and some red short pants in Arthur&#39;s body. &quot;A cross swap!!! Take care of that young and lean body Ash!&quot; said the event coordinator. On his way to the table, Ash took his shirt off and started flexing, exposing Arthur&#39;s body. &quot;Well, after the show I gave everyone in his body, it only seems fair he does the same in mine,&quot; said Arthur unbothered by the event that occurred. &quot;Look my dad is next, I wonder who&#39;ll end up as&quot;. I noticed the box he was holding and I had a knot in my chest. When you left home, you packed a pair of your pajamas and some yellow boxer briefs in a white box with a red ribbon. It couldn&#39;t be, there are a lot of white boxes with red ribbons on them, I&#39;m sure it&#39;s not mine. But you knew the truth, you are not sure what you were expecting, you are in someone else&#39;s body, of course, someone will end up in your own body. But you didn&#39;t expect for that person to be Arthur&#39;s father, still, you weren&#39;t ready for what was going to happen next. Arthur&#39;s father exited the bathroom with your body, dressed only in your yellow underwear. He started flexing and jumping around, it looked quite comical with your twinkish body. He waved at you, and you tried to cover your new face in embarrassment. <br />
The rest of the night went by quite fast, Shawn ended up in Clyde, Arthur&#39;s father. <br />
<br />
After the swaps, we were sent to our rooms, where our luggage and new clothes were waiting. &quot;I can&#39;t wait to get out of these white briefs, I feel like if I make a wrong move they&#39;ll rip,&quot; said Arthur. We got to our rooms and opened Shawn&#39;s and Ash&#39;s luggage. &quot;You&#39;ve got to be kidding me,&quot; said Arthur. &quot;Ash only packed small briefs, in different colors. I&#39;m sure he&#39;s thinking it&#39;s funny .&quot; <br />
&quot;Shawn only has trunks and tight-fitting athletic clothes&quot;. <br />
&quot;At least you&#39;ll look really hot in them. I&#39;ve got no options so I think I&#39;m going commando&quot; said Arthur as he put on only a pair of skin-tight athletic shorts. &quot;Babe, I can see your dick.. Well, your uncle&#39;s dick,&quot; said Drew. Arthur was shirtless and he was looking in the mirror, a clear outline of his uncle&#39;s dick being visible through the shorts. &quot;It&#39;s not my fault Ash has a monster between his legs. I guess that&#39;s where Shawn&#39;s got his from.&quot; &quot;You&#39;ve got a point there. Shawn didn&#39;t pack any pajamas so I&#39;ll sleep in my trunks.&quot; <br />
&quot;I think I&#39;ll sleep nude, at least in my bed I should feel comfortable,&quot; said Arthur while adjusting his bulge.</p>
