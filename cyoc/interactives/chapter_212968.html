<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><br />
Jeremy&#39;s eyes widened. <i>Zach&#39;s ass is so fucking good </i> his words took on a hard edge, shaped by his body and his surging desires. He licked his lips slightly as Zach unintentionally put on a show. <br />
<br />
 &quot;This shouldn&#39;t feel good.&quot; Zach said as he effortlessly pulled back into a standing pose. His body flowed through Yoga forms thoughtlessly. It was as if he suddenly had years of practice.  &quot;... but...er...do you feel it too Mike?&quot;<br />
<br />
Mike blushed, &quot;I-....well..&quot; he stammered a bit, unsure how to respond to his friend. He did feel &#39;it&#39; however. That inexplicable rightness of his new form. It was good. Better than before even. He was older, stronger even as a woman, and there was a new energy, an... excitement that seemed to always be waiting in him...and excitement for...something. He began to feel that odd warmth return. <br />
<br />
Again, the lips between his legs twitched, their palpitations oddly...eager. <br />
<br />
As Jeremy observed the conversation, the pressure in his crotch only increased. His cocktip slowly began to emerge from his sheath as a tent began to strain against his speedo. &quot;Hawwwww&quot; he moaned lightly. Their forms were amazing, he decided. Perfect even. He truly was beginning to understand why older kids obsessed over girls.  The curve of Michaels breasts, the flicking tail over Zach&#39;s pink and white ass. He wanted.... he wanted... them. His mind obsessed over his friends forms in a way he&#39;d never felt before.  One of his hands drifted unbidden to his crotch, giving the engorging tent a slight squeeze. An unexpected electric pleasure unlike anything he felt tingled up his spine. His tail lashed in increasing, unconscious hunger as his bubble butt tensed visibly. <br />
<br />
Zach turned again to Jeremy.  As he faced his friend, his eyes were unable to resist drinking in his muscles. &quot;We might have you beat in flexibility Jer, yet Jer. your shoulders are so broad now.&quot; He said, eyes taking in the mountain of muscle before him. Hie eyes admired the firm shoulders and bowling ball sized delts that capped their tips. Tracing down, he felt increasingly warm as he admired the toned six pack his friend now sported. He felt a want filling him, a want his child-like mind assumed was envy. He had, after all, no other words for the strange feelings. While he&#39;d noticed a mild-yet growing interest in girls before, his parents had never given him &quot;the talk&quot; so he didn&#39;t know what that feeling was.  As his interest was only just beginning, in school he had merely began to notice them more than normal rather than actively pined over them, he failed to recognize that that mild interest was at all related to the feelings washing over him now as he took in his friend&#39;s muscles. <br />
<br />
&quot;I feel so soft, curvy.&quot; He thought, his hand tracing over his form without him realizing, &quot;Yet Jeremy is so strong. I-I always wanted muscles like that. To <i> feel </i>...muscles like that...&quot; <br />
<br />
His increasingly clouded mind failed to realize how his bodies desires were shaping his thoughts. He&#39;d never once wanted to <i>feel </i> muscles. He&#39;d only ever dreamed of <i> having </i> them so that he could brag to his friends and ultimately fulfill his dream of being an NFL quarterback. Touching them was well outside the bounds of his run of-the-mill juvenile muscle envy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can I uh...touch your arms dude?&quot; Zach asked as his eyes laser focused on Jeremy&#39;s impressive biceps. As a boy he&#39;ve killed for arms like that. He, wanted them.... &quot;I, uh, always wanted to be that manly. Want to know what it feels like....&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Like this?&quot; Jeremy purred, as he lifted both arms, flexing them. The muscles practically exploded from his hide, each straining against his skin with raw masculinity and power. Something about the act seemed to short circuit all of Jeremy&#39;s past timidity. He felt big. Strong. Masculine. Testosterone gushed from his muscles, coursing through his blood stream. His eye lids lowered, and a confident smirk crossed his face. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hawwww. Feel away ladies&quot; he purred, mind dulling. <br />
<br />
Eyes fixated on the masculine display before him, Zach placed his hands on Jeremey&#39;s arms, ignoring the &#39;ladies&#39; comment. The feel was indescribably good, filling him with an intense warmth. Gently, he stroked his hands through the mocha fur of his friend, enjoying the arching thickness. Between his legs, his lips twitched. Then twitches again. He pinned his legs together slightly, body seeking to give relief to the unmet needs of his womanhood. <br />
<br />
&quot;I-I&#39;d like to feel too&quot; Michael said, &quot;I er also always wondered what it was like...&quot;<br />
<br />
In seconds, his hands were also fawning over his friend as a similar twitching set in between his legs. <br />
<br />
Jeremy was in heaven. His friends fawning played into his growing ego, while the gentle touch of their hungry hands filled him with an increasing unrestrained desire. <br />
<br />
Between his legs, his bulge began to extend. Inch after inch it filled with blood, unabashedly tenting his strained speedo. <br />
<br />
Without a word, Zach moved from the arm to Jeremy&#39;s chest. Jers hips bucked slightly at the unexpected touch, yet he didn&#39;t complain or question his friends advances. <br />
<br />
&quot;So big..&quot; Zach whispered. <br />
<br />
Meanwhile Michael&#39;s hands traced up the shoulder&#39;s, enjoying their heft, before traveling down his back. The thick bands of Jeremey&#39;s lats offering the perfect guide for his hands, leading them south. <br />
<br />
Zach meanwhile rested one hand on his breast. In his head he distantly justified this as a comparison. Feeling how a breast and a thick, hearty pec differ. In reality, his hands were drawn to a buzzing need. As they graced his nipples, he couldn&#39;t help but enjoy the unexpected sensitivity. He let out a soft bray.<br />
<br />
&quot;These pecs are so amazing, but I have to admit&quot; He whispered to himself, tail lashing &quot;Breasts feel pretty good too...&quot; Between his legs, a slight moisture began to form as his he shifted himself, now facing Jeremy dead on. His returned his hand to his friend&#39;s form, placing both on his heaving pecs. Zach noticed Jeremy&#39;s breath was quickening. His own sped in response. <br />
<br />
Jeremy, meanwhile, could only continue to enjoy the attention. His cock was now at full mast, the tip of his two feet long meat just barely contained in the unusually flexible speedo. The top of the shaft, however, was exposed to the world. Pitch black, and featuring a thick medial ring, the cock gently twitched. It wanted something, yet Jeremy didn&#39;t know what. <br />
<br />
From behind, he felt Michael&#39;s hands unexpectedly grasp his tail. Eyes wide, he turned from Zach to see what the blue furred woman was up to. <br />
<br />
Moments before, Michael had reached a crossroads. Having reached the end of Jeremy&#39;s lats, Michael found himself unsure how to continue. He found himself dropping to his knees, his friends sculpted ass just before his muzzle. He found himself wanting to touch that too...for some unknown reason. It was so big, shapely, filed with power. Yet, he hesitated, eyes locking on his friends tail, trying to fixate on something less... Intimate. <br />
<br />
<i> I haven&#39;t felt my tail yet. Maybe...maybe I can just explore Jer&#39;s instead. Just getting to know our new specifies better... </i> he reasoned as he did just that. Significantly thicker than his own, Michael found even Jeremy&#39;s tail to be strong. As his hands traced along it, he found himself admiring it. Something about the animal appendage looked so good to him. He enjoyed the way it perfectly framed the butt bellow. <br />
<br />
<i> Why don&#39;t humans have these? </i> he wondered. The tail tensed in his hands, the furred tip raising in response to his stimulating touch. He distantly heard Jeremy let out a moaning Haww in response to his fingers. Egged on by his friend&#39;s reaction, his hands traced towards the more sensitive base. The tail lashed forcefully, as he gently massaged the connection between Jer&#39;s spine and the new appendage. He heard a breath haww from above which caused his nether lips to clench, moisture starting to leak onto his swimsuit. <br />
<br />
Looking up, he saw Jeremy was looking down at him. He paused, a bolt of fear coursing through him as he realized he may have gone a step too far. <br />
<br />
Jeremy smiled, as if reading Michael&#39;s mind. &quot;No need to hold back&quot; His voice rumbling as his tail flicked in anticipation. &quot;You said you wanted to know what its like to be a man. Nows your chance to get the full picture.&quot;<br />
<br />
Michael&#39;s hands wasted no time. Immediately they were stroking down the powerful curve of Jeremy&#39;s ass, feeling the tightness of the speedo and the restrained power contained underneath. Michael couldn&#39;t help but moan, as his hand once again gravitated to his breast.<br />
<br />
Jeremy turned as he felt Zach start to edge lower, the donkey woman&#39;s hands feeling the shape of his washboard abs.  Zach&#39;s breathe had quickened, and Jeremey could feel each breath against his sensative skin. <br />
<br />
Zach meanwhile was having trouble feeling the muscles with Jeremy&#39;s...thing in the way. He wasnt&#39; sure exactly what was happening to his friend, but decided to ignore it. His desire pushing him on. Hands against Jer&#39;s abs, the cock was pressed against Zachs toned stomach. <br />
Jeremy shuddered at the unexpected sensation. He also didn&#39;t know what was going on. As Jeremy drew closer, the cock was pressed flush against him, the tip edging comfortably between his breasts. <br />
<br />
Zach&#39;s mind was a flood of hormones. The dual sensations of rock hard muscle, and the gently pulsing of his friends straining member filling him with too many feelings to comprehend. His breasts tingled with each pulse of the cock, and below, his vagina twitched uncontrollably. Between his legs, a drip of moisture traveled down the fur of his inner thigh. <br />
<br />
Jeremy, likewise, was lost in the moment. Without thought, his hands rested on Zachs head. He felt the woman&#39;s long ears twitch upwards  in surprise at the touch, yet fall back behind her head, as if accepting Jeremy&#39;s dominance. Slowly, he began to press her head downward. Down towards his straining penis. There was no thought behind the action only need. Zach accepted this, bending down as his eyes shifted from the abs to his friend&#39;s penis. <br />
<br />
Zach leaned in, his muzzle inches from the tip. He didn&#39;t know what he was doing or what to do next, he was just....doing. He heard a quickening succession of Haws from Jeremey, his friends hand twitching on top of his head. His own hand traced down his body, eagerly making its way to his moist, dripping folds. Nature was guiding them both. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hawwww&quot; bellowed Jeremey, as his cock jumped, forcing its way out of his speedo. Surprised, Zach leaned back, catching himself with an arm. In his face sat the flared tip of Jeremey&#39;s equine length. From the tip, a bead of white emerged. While Zach didn&#39;t yet know what cum was, he somehow knew this was not pee. Its smell filled his nostrils. Guided by the musky scent, he leaned in. It smelled so good and he wanted a taste...</p>
