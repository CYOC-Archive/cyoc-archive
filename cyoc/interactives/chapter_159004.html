<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Robert came home quietly and looked forward to a rather quiet Valentines Day evening, as it was something that he did need. His role as Animalia&#39;s Deputy Mayor wasn&#39;t necessarily too difficult when it came to the tasks that he was assigned. He would serve as something of a moderator when the City Council met and discussed things. He would help with answering questions from the press that came to Animalia on certain things, particularly the number of reporters coming in was greater than what Animalia normally handled. He would fill in for Clara when there were days where she was either absent from Animalia or unable to come it. That wasn&#39;t too hard, in theory.<br />
<br />
However, there were always issues that came up where people might have more pointed questions and wouldn&#39;t necessarily like the answers or some other event would come up that would need to be hurdled. That had some times happened in relation to specific incidents, like Heather&#39;s rampage through Lyre and Animalia a few years before or Mary Piper&#39;s kidnapping Jeremy Green the following year. Often because these incidents presented issues that related to the accident of Animalia&#39;s founding and the issues that related either Humans gaining instincts and drives that really weren&#39;t there normally or consequences of Horizon&#39;s early experiments being presented. And Animalia often had to answer for those things. In pure theory Animalia Ambassadoria was supposed to provide a cover for that, but Robert was also getting some of the sense that the way the show operated, it wasn&#39;t providing the sorts of answers to deal with those sorts of questions.<br />
<br />
And the day had been one of those days, largely as things related to the coming national election came in on Nevada. Most of those that came to Animalia were more interested in trying to push questions on who Animalia supported and a couple conservative online papers asked enough &quot;gotcha questions&quot; to make people sick, largely in relation to how Animalia treated crime and punishment. Often with the reports on things related to two that were presently in the system. One a Bat Animalian and training for various law enforcement duties as part of a &quot;pay-back&quot; program, intended to ultimately cooperate with various law enforcement agencies nationwide and the other a Snake Animalian connected with a series of incidents that had spread HIV/AIDS among lesbian women. Robert didn&#39;t know how many times he had to answer some variation of a question of &quot;why do you support setting criminals free,&quot; and was frustrated by the fact that Animalia&#39;s answer turned more to rehabilitation whenever possible, and with both Heather Wilcox-Green and Mary Piper had been successful.<br />
<br />
In this he was a bit tired when he made it home, though the welcome was warm and one that made him feel better. He opened the door to a &quot;Happy Valentines Day&quot; from Martha and his children,  Renee and Melvin. Martha had said her line vocally, which earned a couple of small yips from Renee and Mel, who were in their stroller but with a sign draped across the tops of the stroller that read, &quot;Happy Valentines Day, Daddy.&quot; Robert found himself smiling at that.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... it would seem like everybody is ready for the holiday,&quot; Robert said with a small smile as he kissed Martha and then turned rub the cheeks of both Renee and Mel. They again happily yipped and even attempted to nipple at his finger.<br />
<br />
&quot;Because it&#39;s a great holiday,&quot; Martha smiled, &quot;sharing loving feelings between loving partners... and sharing that with two beautiful kits that are the product of that love...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And you did so with their stroller?&quot; Robert asked with a small smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;My first thought was to give them a sign they could hold up,&quot; Martha explained as she moved around to pull the stroller back from the entryway where Robert had come in, &quot;but I&#39;m not sure they would have been able to hold it up or would have wanted to hold it up... So I suspended their message from the sun-shade for their stroller and set them in it. The biggest thing was ultimately more in the message that we wouldn&#39;t be going out.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah... so you thought mom was taking you on an adventure,&quot; Robert said down to Mel and Renee who answered with little yips.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dinner shouldn&#39;t be too far off,&quot; Martha said to Robert, &quot;and then once these two are down for the night... I have a special present for you...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Special?&quot; Robert smiled, &quot;Well... that might be nice... and keep the focus on the best parts of the day.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A rough day?&quot; Martha wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;More just an overflow of reporters wanting to use Animalia as their own editorial column,&quot; Robert sighed, &quot;not all of which is positive... but that&#39;s still something a bit to forget about. Tonight is to be for love.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, it is,&quot; Martha agreed.<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
Others were more learning about things like Valentines Day for the first time. Mr. Hyun had had some awareness of the holiday thanks to his own past service, but this was really the first time Ling had seen anything like it... at least with regard to having a bandmate. And as the two Korean Water Deer made their way through Lyre and Animalia as part of a walk for some exercise, and surprised at how warm it was for a day in mid February, Ling couldn&#39;t help but look at some of the decorations that were put up. Where were cardboard and plastic hearts that were on display in windows with the words &quot;Happy Valentines&quot; written across them in white cursive lettering. All of it fascinated her.<br />
<br />
&quot;A whole holiday for love,&quot; Ling spoke in awe as they crossed a street and noted the red fuzzy hearts that were hung from one of the street signs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Mr. Hyun answered, &quot;and often romantic love...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Like you and I?&quot; Ling asked back.<br />
<br />
&quot;For any couple so far as I know,&quot; Mr. Hyun answered, &quot;though I will have to admit that before you... I really hadn&#39;t had the time to ever consider such relationships before and never had any orders to &quot;investigate&quot; the holiday.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then this would be our first Valentines together,&quot; Ling said happily, taking Mr. Hyun by the arm.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m afraid I am no poet,&quot; Mr. Hyun told her modestly.<br />
<br />
It was at this point where they came up on one of Lyre&#39;s family restaurants with a sign in a window advertising a special Valentines Day cake. The picture showed a light colored cake made in the shape of a heart with whipped cream around the top edge of the cake and packed with strawberries running along the top of the cake and with what looked like a raspberry sauce laid in stripes across the rest of the fruit. Ling licked her lips at that.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t need a poet,&quot; Ling answered, &quot;Just you... and that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mr. Hyun followed Ling&#39;s finger to the picture of the dessert advertised in the window and gave a sigh, &quot;you&#39;d wish to have dinner now?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And that cake shaped like a heart,&quot; Ling nodded, &quot;it&#39;d be a sweet treat.&quot;<br />
<br />
Unable to deny her anything, Mr. Hyun nodded and ushered Ling toward the door.<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
Mieni was similarly decked out for Valentines Day though with a bit of a different tone to it, partially because of the location and the more &quot;aquatic&quot; nature of its residents. The main hotel was open, largely in case people flying across the Pacific had to land at the atoll on their way somewhere else, but other than that many of the things for the atoll&#39;s tourism industry were on reduced hours, given that during this time of year their tourist traffic was a bit lower. Some did come in from time to time, but many of these were also private flights wanting private access to places, which was tolerated but often on the condition that these guests note not only the rules the colony had but that Mieni had full time residents.<br />
<br />
And it was those full time residents that had the time to throw a small Valentines Party on the evening of the Fourteenth. In theory it was for the residents, but a couple of married tourists had stumbled onto the occasion.<br />
<br />
&quot;So... you all live here?&quot; a Human man asked to Harold and Kirana and gestured to the others that were present, including Rapier and Gladys, Ran and Gaz, Rita and Ralph, Brazen and Tzan, Susan and Chipper. He noted that a few of the couples had children that they stayed close to or followed them as they danced together in the beach&#39;s sand with some various love songs playing in the background. Those that didn&#39;t have children danced a bit more independently, but still with a fairly romantic atmosphere.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Harold nodded, &quot;My wife and I work with the Horizon facilities here, which will handle the uplifting process with oceanic life and the possible applications we may use to gain greater understanding of the ocean... Essentially getting first hand testimony from those who live there. Some of the others work as life guards, managers for the hotel, and so on.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you do outside the tourist season?&quot; the man&#39;s wife wondered, &quot;I mean... we came in... but I&#39;ve haven&#39;t seen too many other people here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;True, February isn&#39;t very busy, tourist-wise,&quot; Kirana commented, &quot;but Horizon&#39;s work is pretty steady and we can even branch out to look at the affects of things like global warming as need be. All of it can be a full time job, and for the most part the tourist seasons have been good enough that Mieni can coast between them. So... those that have worked with the various tourist sites have been able to assist with some various local security issues... make sure there are no commercial fishing actions getting into the waters and that animals that come in are protected. That sort of thing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And with the present quiet in the tourist activity,&quot; Harold added, &quot;those of us with bond mates are happy to spend time with those we love and show our children the good fun that can be part of Valentine&#39;s Day.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I trust we&#39;re not interrupting anything... are we?&quot; the woman asked nervously, &quot;I mean... we were able to come in... but we didn&#39;t want to interfere with anything private...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s fine,&quot; Harold commented, &quot;It&#39;s a day for love, and if you wish to share in the party... the more the merrier. Just... remember the general rules with regard to what is and is allowed and mind the children.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you,&quot; the man said before leaning over to kiss his wife.</p>
