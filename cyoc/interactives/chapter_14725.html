<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Felix woke the next morning in a panic.  What's happened to me?  Why can't I move?  What the hell . . ?  Then he remembered bungling his own transformation into a greyhound and becoming a jackass, a jackass that his smirking sister then turned into a stuffed animal.  Out of his button eyes, Felix found he could somehow see Tina's room around him.  At least, he could until she tossed her discarded panties on top of his giant rabbit face.  <br />
<br />
Tina laughed and went off to take a shower ignoring the pleading telepathic voice that had once belonged to the 6'1&quot; body of her older brother.  &quot;Come on, Tina!  This isn't fair!  Come on!  I didn't deserve this!  Please, Tina!  Please!&quot;<br />
<br />
Tina showered and dressed, smiling ear to ear.  With his ability to communicate with her, Felix listened to her thoughts.  He would have gulped nervously if he could have.  She was replaying in her mind every time he'd put her down.  He could hear his own words repeated in a mocking singsong voice.  To his shock, she seemed to remember every single time he'd said anything to her.  When she finished he begged in an almost sobbing tone &quot;I-I didn't think I'd been a bad brother to you, Tina.  Really.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tina finished dressing and pulled the panties off Felix's stuffed animal face.  &quot;Well, you'll have all day to think about it, won't you, Felix?  I'm going off to school now&quot; said Tina and gave the stuffed rabbit's head a pat.  Mr. and Mrs. Fairfax were already off to their jobs as usuall as she glided down the stairs to the front door just as the doorbell rang.  She opened the door.  There was Tony St. Martin.  <br />
&quot;Hi, Tina is Felix ready to go?  I waited for him for at the corner like always but he didn't show&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh, um, no.  Felix wasn't feeling himself this morning.  He's not going to school&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh, gee, well tell him to get well soon.&quot;<br />
Tina nodded and watched him walk off, dress pants straining to contain his muscular little rear.  <br />
<br />
Tina went off to 8th grade thinking about Tony's whole body and that face, those cheekbones.  At first, she was thinking the usual &quot;If only . . &quot; that followed staring at pictures in GQ magazine.  But then she considered her possession of the chronivac.  Why not?  What's to stop me?<br />
<br />
Tina went over to a friend's house after school.  She told them that she might call them on the phone before school started and tell them to come over to her house and skip school.  Tina got home late and immediately on seeing her, Felix began pleading with her.  A whole day spent unable to move or communicate, stuck in the body of a stuffed animal had left him feeling a bit unhinged.  He recounted all the nice things he'd done for her over the years.  But rather than soften Tina's attitude, it only annoyed her.  As Felix feared, a taste of power had only whetted Tina's appetite for more.  She started typing away at the chronivac telling Felix that she was going to erase his mind completely.  But reading her mind, he could tell that she had called up Tony's profile.  She typed away for a few minutes then went to bed.<br />
<br />
The next morning, she showered and dressed and applied perfume humming a song all the while.  She left her brother the stuffed animal on the chair next to her bed and then carried the chronivac downstairs.<br />
<br />
A few minutes later, the doorbell rang.  Tina jogged over to it.  She smiled when she opened the door and saw Tony St. Martin there in dress pants, white shirt and a thin sweater vest.<br />
&quot;Hi Tony!&quot;<br />
&quot;Um, hi, Tina, is Felix up and around today?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yup.  Come on in&quot; she said reaching out and tugging at one belt loop of his pants.  She led Tony to a spot just inside the door and then headed off to the dining room table.<br />
&quot;Felix should be down in just a minute&quot; she said, smiling at slender, athletic Tony.  Tony smiled politely back.  She started typing away at the laptop.  Tony was just looking down at his shoes when he felt the familiar electric wave pass through him.  He turned toward Tina typing on the laptop, realizing too late what she was typing at.  His body felt unchanged except for an odd hazy feeling in his mind.<br />
&quot;Hey what're you do-&quot;<br />
&quot;Quiet!&quot;<br />
Tony tried to get out words of indignation but couldn't open his mouth no matter how hard he tried.<br />
&quot;Now take off your clothes&quot;<br />
To his amazement, Tony found himself stripping in front of Felix's 14 year old sister.  She came bouncing over to where he stood at the bottom of the stairs.<br />
&quot;Stand at attention&quot; she casually commanded and Tony accentuated his posture and clasped his hands behind his back.<br />
<br />
Tony desperately wanted to run to the dining room and grab the chronivac.  How the hell had she ever gotten hold of it?  But he couldn't.  He couldn't move a muscle.  All he could do was stand there like a statue of flesh while Tina giggled and circled him.  Finally, she pulled out her cell phone and dialed her friends.  &quot;Stacy!  Do NOT go to school.  Come to my house.  Immediately.  I've got a fanTAStic surprise for you.  Oh, and bring Diana.  You will LOVE this and that's exactly the right verb&quot;  She snapped her phone shut and stood on her tiptoes right in front of him looking into his eyes.  His expression wasn't catatonic or zombie-like.  He looked as though he would say something at any moment.  But he couldn't without her permission.<br />
&quot;You know what I did to you?&quot;<br />
Pause.<br />
&quot;No, of course you don't and you can't respond unless I give you permission to.  I made you my sex slave, really just a slave in general, but with specific attention to sexual satisfaction&quot;<br />
While Tony groaned, she giggled delightedly and circled around him one more time.  She rubbed her palm over one superlative buttock and tried to take the measure of the arc of muscle, fanning her fingers out against the side facing plane of him.  She pinched and prodded him all over, noting his complete lack of fat and flawless skin.  She had her hand against his thigh comparing it to his penis when the bell rang.  She went to the door with a smirk.  It was Stacy and her half black friend Ann.  <br />
<br />
Tina ushered them inside.  &quot;So what's the-&quot;<br />
Stacy and Ann gasped and froze at the sight of naked Tony St. Martin.  Both backed against the door Tina could barely close behind them.<br />
&quot;Wh-wh-what is he doing there, like . . that?&quot; demanded Ann.<br />
&quot;He's under a sort of spell.  I told him to take off his clothes so he had to take off his clothes.  He's my sex slave, our sex slave&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh, this is good.  A black girl gets to have a white boy as a slave&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you sure?&quot; asked Stacy walking up close to Tony along with her friends and then standing on tiptoes, five foot seven like them, to look in his eyes.<br />
&quot;He looks . . alert&quot; she said snapping her fingers right in front of his eyes.  Tony blinked each time.<br />
&quot;He is alert.  But he doesn't control his body except to do what I tell him.  Watch.  Bend down and kiss my feet&quot; Tina commanded and Tony dutifully bent over, his chest almost to the floor and pressed his lips to her sneakers.  <br />
&quot;Now stand up again&quot;.  Tony stood up at attention again.<br />
Ann reached around behind him and slapped his ass hard.  Tony didn't even acknowledge it.<br />
&quot;What was that for?&quot; asked Stacy. <br />
&quot;Nothing.  I just always wanted to slap that ass.  This white boy has got back.  Mmmm mmm mmm&quot;<br />
Stacy nodded with a chuckle.  &quot;He's the bomb, I mean, bodywise.  Way too into the whole book thing for me&quot;<br />
&quot;I gotta try one more thing to be satisfied that this boy is under a spell or whatever you said it was&quot; said Ann.  She stepped back and dropped her backpack to the floor then took out a pen.<br />
&quot;No boy wants you messing with his jewels or his johson if he can help it&quot; she said and then slowly, tentatively pushed Tony's supersized penis to one side.  Stacy and even Tina giggled with delight.  Tony didn't change expression.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you satisfied?&quot; crowed Tina.  We have a living, breathing sex machine at our disposal and we ARE going to use him&quot;<br />
&quot;Slave&quot; she said turning to Tony.  &quot;From here on out, you will respond 'yes master' as appropriate to the situation.  Is that understood?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes master&quot; said Tony while inwardly screaming at his inability to fight her control of him.<br />
&quot;Now pick up my two friends and carry them upstairs&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes master&quot; replied Tony.  He wrapped one arm around each girl and with an ease that amazed them, carried them both up ths stairs.<br />
&quot;Put 'em down now&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes master&quot;<br />
&quot;Okay&quot; said Tina.  &quot;Now comes the fun.  Who goes first?  Who takes our boy here for a test ride first?&quot;<br />
Ann stepped forward rubbing one hand along his face.  &quot;Me&quot;<br />
&quot;Alright.  Tony?  You will now make love to Ann as though she is Claire Heath&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes master&quot; said Tony and then he stepped forward with a smile and kissed the black girl.  He picked her up and carried her into Tina's bedroom.  In his mind, Tony screamed No!  He loved Claire.  He didn't want to fuck this girl.  He particularly didn't want to fuck her the way he would make love to Claire.  But he couldn't help himself.  <br />
<br />
From the chair next to the bed, stuffed animal Felix saw it all.  At first he tried to speak telepathically to Tony, but somehow couldn't make contact.  He watched and learned.<br />
<br />
Tony caressed her and kissed her and lovingly burnished her body.  He kissed her some more and let her feel the warm energy of his breath at her breasts, using his mouth the way Claire liked it.  He pressed his chin to her bush and rubbed with pressure along her legs, the way that so delighted Claire and at last, he stretched his long tongue inside her.  He first pressed it hard against her clit, then basted it back and forth, then swirled around it just the way Claire liked.  When he had her panting in reaction, he got up and had her pull a condom over his rock hard penis and finished things top of her, thrusting first gently then harder and noting where it pleased her most but kissing her and rubbing his nose on hers all the while, smiling looking into his eyes as he would Claire's.<br />
<br />
Ann emerged from the room with her top only half on and her hair a mess, her eyes wide with delight.  &quot;Wow.  I mean, next&quot;<br />
<br />
Tony made love to Stacy and then Tina each time half seeing Claire in bed with him and that was what truly infuriated him.  Sex was sex, but this almost seemed to stomp on and spit on his love for Claire and fidelity to her.<br />
<br />
They had him fuck them one after another with no break in between, not that athletic 16 year old Tony needed one.  After all three had had their turn, Tina commanded Tony to go to the bathroom and take a quick shower.  He obeyed and emerged washed and toweled dry but still naked 5 minutes later.<br />
&quot;Cleans up nice&quot; said Ann walking around him.<br />
&quot;Tony, go downstairs and cook our lunch for us.  Cook the leftovers on the top shelf of the fridge.  Hurry.  You've made us hungry&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes master&quot; said Tony and he bounded down the stairs and over to the kitchen.<br />
<br />
Tina and her friends went down more leisurely. <br />
&quot;We can do this to ANY boy at school.  ANY boy&quot; laughed Tina.  <br />
&quot;Well the bar, or may I say, the pole has been set pretty high already&quot; said Ann and they all burst into laughter.  They were debating which boy to test drive next when the doorbell rang.  <br />
<br />
Tina looked out the adjacent window and saw a redhaired kid about Tony's age in a bellhop uniform with what looked like an electronic organizer in his hands.  She opened the door with a smirk.  &quot;What are you, room service?&quot; she cracked and her friends laughed.<br />
<br />
He raised one eyebrow in contempt.<br />
&quot;Trans Dem Labs, miss.  We make the Chronivac that you used on your brother and Tony St. Martin&quot;<br />
&quot;The what?&quot; asked Ann.<br />
&quot;The same thing as that with which I'm about to freeze you&quot; he said and typed a few keys.  All three girls froze in place as if placed in suspended animation.  The redheaded guy took a few steps toward Tony, who, with his master in limbo stopped where he was as well.  <br />
&quot;I'm going to save your friend upstairs first&quot; he declared and giant stuffed rabbit Felix felt the electric wave pass through him.  In just a second, he became a thing of flesh and blood and then resumed human size and shape.  Felix ran into his room and pulled on a pair of boxers and pants.  By the time he got downstairs, Tony was back to normal and striding toward his clothes, piled in a corner near the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh god, thank you&quot; said Felix to the Trans Dem Labs guy<br />
&quot;And I'm sorry, Tony.  I'm so sorry.  It was just one stupid mistake&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Go through the tutorial and be sure of what you're doing next time&quot; said the Trans Dem Labs guy and then, with a sigh, &quot;We really need to raise the fees for registering profiles&quot;<br />
<br />
Ann emerged f</p>
