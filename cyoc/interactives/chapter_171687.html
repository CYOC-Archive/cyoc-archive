<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Well, first things first.<br />
<br />
Jack needed some new clothes. &quot;Jack? That movie isn&#39;t too scary for my big tough boyfriend, is it?&quot; Vicki teased him a bit, though she would not know that Jack had just lived through the opening events of a horror movie now himself. He breathed. He needed to see Vicki - for many reasons. He yearned to see her again just to make sure she was okay, maybe it was just the danger from now, but he wanted to hold her tight tonight in desire, and...and he needed to try and break it to her. He needed someone he could trust to help with this curse of lycanthropy. And he trusted nobody more than Vicki.<br />
<br />
&quot;No way no how, I&#39;m down for a scary werewolf movie. Count me in.&quot; Jack said with an awkward smile, followed by looking around. He needed the address, &quot;Now I uhh, I got into a bit of a sudden shoot, and my weirdo photographer did something...weird.&quot; Jack didn&#39;t know how to tell his girlfriend he suddenly didn&#39;t have any clothes except his tighty-whities, but he was certainly going to try for this excuse at least.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, don&#39;t tell me it was another pervert...this industry is no good here, Jack! I swear!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not the typical pervert...but definitely very weird. He had me do an underwear shot, and when I went to go get my clothes, they were gone!&quot; Jack rubbed his forehead, wondering if he might be able to tell her in the future &quot;well I turned into a murderous gigantic hairball and sliced up some zombies&quot;. Would this become something like a normal occurrence for him?<br />
<br />
&quot;Ohh Jack...where are you? I&#39;ll pick up some new clothes and bring them right on over.&quot; Vicki didn&#39;t seem to be suspicious of this, and given what his boss was like, Jack didn&#39;t blame her for that. Skeevy loonies were a dime a dozen. Made Jack thankful whenever he found a photographer who was on the up and up.<br />
<br />
&quot;The old BART station down, marked 2278. It&#39;s down a few streets from the diner.&quot; Jack found himself curious about that. Odd that the diner was so close by and the trailing started so close as well. Someone knew his favorite locales.<br />
<br />
As the phone call ended, Jack thought he heard something and froze in place. It sounded like some kind of car driving by outside. Very slowly, as if expecting something. He held his breath and moved close to the wall. He began to move up the stairwell, trying to get a better look. Jack&#39;s eyes narrowed. It was the very same trailing car from earlier. It looked like whoever it was, they expected to pick up the zombies Jack had left in pieces from that lupine episode.<br />
<br />
He tried to get a closer look while remaining in the cover of the dark inside of the tunnel entry, and he thought he could see a humanoid figure in the driver&#39;s seat. He looked like he was wearing some kind of full face covering mask, only a pair of eye holes cut in the front. Just as Jack was about to get some more details about the inside of the car, the man sped off. Leaving Jack with vanishingly little. He thought he heard some people coming and went back down, seeing a woman and her two kids walking by.<br />
<br />
Damn he was gonna need to get some method of dealing with werewolfism inflicted nudity, because there was no way he could just run around basically naked. Even if he was a damn gorgeous sight, even with the brow and so on. It was a wait that felt longer than it was to have Vicki show up, but before long he heard the sound of a car honking its horn outside.<br />
<br />
Jack quickly ran up and outside after seeing Vicki driving her car. Piling on into the passenger side door, blushing a little bit, Jack looked at her and said, &quot;The things I get up to to pay the bills.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ohh Jack...&quot; She said with a sigh, and handed him a new v-neck, jeans, and a pair of sox. Jack for his part did not waste any time in getting himself clothed...though now that he did, he felt curiously like these clothes were a bit less...comfortable in an odd way than just running around like that was. It was only now that he had a sense of comparison that he realized it. Maybe this was some added bestial instinct. Or maybe it was the Full Moon due to come out that night.<br />
<br />
Before long Vicki was driving off toward her home for what she assumed would be a nice afternoon and evening of movies, lunch and dinner, romance and more. Jack however looked up at the sun and wondered. He already knew he had shifted a bit just since last night. His back was awkward now - his spine seemed more prominent - his brow and his chest hair... this was clearly all build up toward the shift that was to come tonight at the full moon.<br />
<br />
The car began to drive off toward Vicki&#39;s home and their date. Jack just wished he could abandon his worries and have a nice, Netflix and Chill dinner date with his girlfriend without problems. But the fact was, he had a lot he needed to tell her.<br />
<br />
-----------------<br />
<br />
Vicki&#39;s house was a remarkably nice place. She was not from quite as wealthy a family as Jack&#39;s, but her folks were affluent, and they were able to make sure she got a very nice place. They weren&#39;t exactly a religious bunch, so when they found a place this large and accommodating with such a small dividend needed to pay for ownership, well, they went ahead. Vicki had no problems with it, at least as far as she told Jack. It was apparently Victorian in age, and back in the day Jack had helped her in bringing her stuff in and cleaning up the place in advance of her move being complete.<br />
<br />
Vicki decided to start their movie viewing experience with Bad Moon, which immediately provided Jack with an anti-role model. Jack was sure as much as he could be that he hoped he did not end up becoming the same kind of werewolf that Ted from that movie was. The man was ultimately a foul beast whether he was in werewolf form or not though. So it might be more that the curse brought out something that lurked inside of him.<br />
<br />
Jack found himself ravenously hungry - again - and if he had to guess, the transformation burned off a lot of calories. Maybe that was something he could use in case he really needed to cut off calories in advance of a shoot! Bad idea, granted, but it was there. Jack ate easily three servings of round steak, two servings of chicken breast, and three servings of tender pork. And he was prepared for another when he realized it, &quot;Ohh, uh, that was the last of the pork, wasn&#39;t it...?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ve been eating like an animal today, Jack!&quot; Vicki chuckled, though she immediately said, &quot;I trust you though. You always stay in great form.&quot; She walked over and felt up his bicep, and Jack grinned a little.<br />
<br />
&quot;Always love to look good for my gorgeous girlfriend.&quot; He winked, and as soon as Jack had cleaned up his hands, he felt her arms wrap around his torso, not even any remark on his hair situation. She started to move as soon as she could to help Jack out of his shirt. He repaid the favor in helping her get undressed - blouse and skinny jeans coming off, and leaving her in her panties and bra. Seemed things really were going in the Netflix and Chill direction. Even as the movie kept on playing, Vicki started to kiss Jack&#39;s lips. Teasing and slowly bringing him toward the couch.<br />
<br />
&#39;I&#39;ve heard sometimes about horror seeming to bring out some peoples&#39; more amorous sides in response to the darkness on the screen, but this was something else&#39;. This was...still rather surprising in how sudden it was. &quot;V-Vicki? Wow...Wow. Not that I&#39;m unhappy...&quot; Jack murmured as he felt her start pulling his jeans down, sticking her hand in the front of his briefs. &quot;I&#39;m always up for more of this. But usually there&#39;s...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t really explain it myself, Jack. It&#39;s like you&#39;re...&quot; She kissed Jack&#39;s neck a few times and kept rubbing at his manhood, noting as she did there seemed to be something unusual about it. Shapewise and size wise. &quot;More magnetic today than you&#39;ve ever been, not that you lacked that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jack didn&#39;t want to stop, but he also was reminded in that moment that there was more he was here to do than bang his girlfriend and have some fun today. He gulped and lightly bit his lip to get himself back to thinking with his head rather than his crotch. &quot;I uhh...babe, there&#39;s...there&#39;s something I really need to tell you about today. It&#39;s uh, related to the incident that happened last night...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on, lover boy, can&#39;t it wait till we&#39;re done?&quot; Vicki kissed him on the lips, shutting Jack up and moving around on top of him. Letting her hand explore his body. She always did enjoy how toned and well muscled he was - he was more toward the fitness model end of the trade, and she was very much thankful for that. Abs sculpted as if from the ideal man, a chest strong and broad, shoulders wide, built on every part, and strong, muscled arms. Legs fit for helping thrust in and out...<br />
<br />
Jack moved over on top of her, twisting and turning on the couch. He knew for some reason this was a better position for him. It just seemed more natural. Could this be the influence of the wolf inside of him somehow? Well, there was that instinctual thing, as well as the fact he was increasingly feeling like he could smell the arousal coming off of his girlfriend. And fuuuck, it was intoxicating. It was almost enough to make Jack feel like skipping his attempts at telling her anything and just going right for the pleasurable activities.<br />
<br />
The briefs came off, and he was before long helping her unbuckle the bra and get her panties down. Jack knew he had one more chance to try at least and get something said, &quot;Now, before we go ahead with this, I just wanted---just wanted to say something really important. It&#39;s...something&#39;s...really different about me lately. And I gotta say what.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It can wait, lover boy.&quot; That was all the answer Jack got before he was brought into enough of an urgent kiss that he plunged his manhood into her right there on the couch. One thing that was obvious about Vicki was she was anything but a quiet lover. She immediately started moaning and urging him on. Making him go further, thrust harder, muscles flexing and jaw tight with exertion. She always pushed him like this into really exerting himself - even made him pull a muscle in his ass once, not that he really minded. <br />
<br />
They were watching a horrifying movie, hearing screams and panic and noise, and yet here Jack and his girlfriend were, making love right there in front of it all. Maybe it was fortuitous, maybe it was all in some response to the horror, or maybe it was Jack&#39;s new lycanthropic nature having some effect.<br />
<br />
But he did admit. Yeah, yeah it can wait. He could tell her after the two of them were done with their amorous activities, right? <br />
<br />
Jack thought he heard something coming from the back of the house, somehow he could hear it just fine even over the noise of the TV and the moans of his girlfriend. It sounded like someone was stumbling around in the backyard of the McMansion. Maybe it was just the local cats or something. Jack however thought he saw a shadow out of the corner of his eye, toward the far end, through a few open doors, near the door toward the end of the house, toward the backyard. He could see something even as he thrust away - pushed his hips deep.<br />
<br />
The figure vanished, and Jack was left wondering what was going on here. Surely that was someone...but at the same time, he was really feeling like he was in heaven from just the sheer sensation. She was really tight on him today. Curiously tight. He couldn&#39;t just suddenly grow bigger down there, could he?<br />
<br />
Jack pondered what he should do from here...</p>
