<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>That&#39;s why I&#39;m bad at writing, never able to separate content and delete unimportant one. Lets hope my Protagonist won&#39;t be an wo level Archamge within one month. XD</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The moon rose over the city, casting a silver glow on the streets. We had worked hard all day, loading and unloading crates at the docks. Even Adrian, the lazy hyena, had done his share of the work. We had managed to finish the job on time, despite the delay caused by our absent.<br />
<br />
As we ready to leave, one of the dockers suggested we go to the bathhouse, a welcome thought. I looked around and saw Ronald, the hunk rhino beastman. He was the best worker at the docks, strong and confident. His gray skin and white horns contrasted with his black mane and onyx like piercing eyes. He had a majestic and noble aura, and he charmed everyone with his smile, onyx like piercing eyes. Even as asocial as Max heard of his romantic history.<br />
<br />
Ronald noticed me looking at him and waved. “Hey, you look like you need a bath. Why don’t you come with me? I know a place that has big tubs for big guys like us. You won’t regret it.” He said, his voice inviting and seductive. <br />
<br />
My mind immediately conjured images of steamy bathhouses, where bulky beastmen would revel in their nakedness, their bodies immersed in warm, soothing waters. And I sharing a tub with him, feeling his skin and horns, his mane and muscles. It was a tantalizing thought, a fantasy come true. Having this thought making me feel like a voyeuristic interloper.<br />
<br />
However, I had been through a lot today. Start from saving Max’s life, the weight of exhaustion pressed upon me, both physically and mentally. I was still adjusting to being a wolf beastman, to having fur and a tail, to living in this isekai world. I just yearning for the solace of a deep slumber, forget everything for a while. Even the mere suggestion of indulgence failed to stir enough blood to my crotch.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nah, I&#39;ll pass for now. All I want is to collapse into bed and sleep like a log. But thank you for the invitation.&quot; I replied, my voice heavy with weariness.<br />
<br />
Ronald and the others raised their eyebrows, a puzzled expression on their furry faces. They looked at each other, wondering what was wrong with me. “Oooookay.” Ronald said, his tone laced with disbelief. They regarded me with a mixture of curiosity and bemusement, their eyes silently questioning the peculiarity of my response. It dawned on me that I had made a mistake. I had forgotten to act like Max, to be rude and uneducated, to reject the invitation with a snarl or a curse. I had been too polite, too civilized.<br />
<br />
Adrian chuckled with a playful glint in his eyes, seemingly unfazed by the previous exchange. &quot;You see, I&#39;ve been saying it—Max has improve into quite the remarkable wolf. I am so proud of him.&quot; His words carried a sense of amusement, unaware that he had inadvertently diffused the situation for me. Good job!<br />
<br />
Not wanting to draw any further attention or invite additional scrutiny, I mustered a straight face and waved goodbye to the group. As I turned away from the lively dock, my footsteps guided me towards the modest shack that Max had called home in his memories.<br />
<br />
The path leading to the shack was surprising lively, although night of Port-Tailus without brightly lit like the city in modern world, nocturnal beastmen stirring around, enjoying their nightlife. It seems that most beastman have low light vision, at least wolf eyes easily pierced the dimness.<br />
<br />
I see fox beastman slyly slipped through alleys and backways, keen eyes and ears open for both threats and opportunities. Meanwhile in the town square, a gathering of horned beastman was engaged sparring, crowds of onlookers cheered. Raucous music and laughter spilled from taverns, drawing in patrons of all breeds - shaggy lions bumped flagons with dainty mice, while towering horses conversed with gluttony swine. <br />
<br />
As the moon climbed, more wonders and strangers. Drawn by the sounds of revelry, I made a mental note to find some time to take a stroll. When I arrived at Port-Tailus at noon, I was dragged to work by Adrian without even taking a good look of the city. <br />
<br />
As I continued walking, the shouts and music of the city faded behind me. Ahead, all that could be heard was the soothing crash of waves and birds crying overhead. Before long, I reached a cluster of shacks that looked like they had seen better days. They were battered by the wind and rain, but they still stood strong, like the people who lived in them. One of them was Max’s home, the place where he slept every night.<br />
<br />
Stepping inside Max&#39;s shack, a swirl of emotions flooded my senses. Gratitude filled me for the shelter of four walls, sheltering him from the worst of storms. Wonder took hold as glimpses of Max&#39;s private domain came into focus - clues to the wolf who laid his head here each night. <br />
<br />
Yet Max was not often alone according to his memories. Adrianis his housemate, but sometimes disappeared on unknown errands, leaving Max none the wiser as to his whereabouts. Going by scraps of impressions left behind, I could speculate that scoundrel may have enjoyed a debauched life during the long night. <br />
<br />
I rummaged through Max’s vault and found some coins to buy myself a meal. My wolf stomach was growling, demanding my attention. I headed to a nearby stall that catered to the hungry worker. I didn’t know what I was eating, but it was hot and filling. I guess I shouldn’t expect much from my first dinner in this isekai world. The technology here reminded me of the Age of Discovery on Earth, when explorers sailed across the oceans in search of new lands and riches. <br />
<br />
I remembered reading an article once that said humans had the most taste buds, and canines had only a fraction of that. Birds had even less, barely able to taste anything at all. Maybe beastmen were somewhere in between, depending on their animal traits. That might explain why I couldn’t tell if the food was bland or spicy, sweet or sour. It didn’t matter, though. It was cheap and convenient, and that was enough for now.<br />
<br />
I finished my meal and washed up, then lay down on Max’s hard bed. It was not very comfortable, but it felt perfect for his big and furry body. I wondered how I would ever sleep on it with my thin human body again, maybe I will start sleeping every night in beastman body? My tail wag at my unbridled idea, decided to stop thinking about it and focus on my ability panel. I summoned it and reviewed today’s events.<br />
<br />
——————————————————————————————<br />
<b>Extraordinary Ability:</b> Possession Lv. 2 (50%)<br />
<br />
<b>Achievement Unlocked:</b> First Taste, Takedown Strong Alone, Who is in charge now?<br />
<br />
<b>Upgrade Unlocked:</b> Heritage, Knowledge<br />
<br />
<b>Optional upgrades:</b> Affliction, Empathy, Insanity, Range, Kinempathy<br />
——————————————————————————————<br />
<br />
<b>1.</b> I was dying from overwork in my world, when a boring god decided I was suitable for his entertainment. He sent me to my dream world, full of beastmen, and told me to enjoy myself which he would relieve by watching.<br />
<b>2.</b> He gave me Possession - the ability to possess other beings, but it had many limitations. It could be leveled up by completing certain achievements. So far, I had unlocked three of them.<br />
<b>3.</b> I used my ability on Max, an adult silver-fur wolf beastman, to save him from committing suicide. He didn’t seem to mind that I took over his body, as long as I didn&#39;t hurt his pride. So I decided to keep it for now.<br />
<b>4.</b> I met an adventurer on the way to the city, and knowing that magic existed in this world. I was curious to learn more about it, maybe even try it myself.<br />
<b>5.</b> Max was rude and uneducated, but he could be persuaded with reason. I managed to solve one of his problems, but I had no idea how to deal with the other. Maybe I should be his best man and help him find a new girlfriend? But I didn’t have much experience with women, since I preferred men.<br />
<b>6.</b> All the coworkers at the dock were friendly and handsome. I wanted to get to know the others better, especially the ones with cute ears and tails.<br />
—————————————————————————————<br />
<br />
“Hey, quit staring holes in the wall and get some shut-eye,” Max suddenly groused, interrupted my thoughts.<br />
<br />
“You mean you don&#39;t notice it before us?” I asked, surprised he couldn&#39;t see what held my focus. So my ability panel was it only visible to me, or could I share it with him? As I wondered, a “Share” icon appeared next to the panel.<br />
<br />
But was I ready to do that? After all, this was my only advantage in this world. For now, discretion remained the wisest path until I could trust him completely.<br />
<br />
“See what? The cracks on the wall? Don’t worry about them, they’re as tough as me. They won’t fall apart.” He said, sounding proud.<br />
<br />
“If you say so, I&#39;ll be relieved. You’re really proud of yourself, aren’t you? You never apologize for anything. But sometimes, you need to take a step back and the sky will be brighter. I’m not saying you’re wrong to be stubborn. It can be a good quality. But it can also backfire, like it did this time.” I said, trying to have an honest conversation with him. I wanted to share some of my modern wisdom and compassion with him, to heal his wounded pride.<br />
<br />
“What’s the point of telling you? You can see everything in my head, go ahead and look, you nosy jerk.” He snapped, sounding angry.<br />
<br />
“It’s not the same, you know. Telling me yourself is an act of introspection. And while I can see your memories, they’re just like watching a video or reading a book. I don’t know how you feel or what you think. That’s important, too.” I said, trying to explain.<br />
<br />
I waited for Max to reply, but he remained silent. The air was thick with tension and unsaid words. I wished I had the Empathy Upgrade, so I could sense his thoughts and feelings. But I didn’t, so I had to respect his choice. Maybe he would open up to me another time.<br />
<br />
“I get it if you don’t want to talk about it right now. I’m here for you whenever you’re ready.” I said softly, then closed my eyes, hoping to get some sleep.<br />
<br />
But sleep didn’t come. Instead, I heard Max’s voice again, low and bitter. “I’m an orphan. I’ve always been on my own.”<br />
<br />
Images flashed in my mind, fragments of Max’s memories. I saw him as a young pup, alone and hungry, scavenging for food in the snow. I saw him dodging bigger and meaner wolves, fighting for his survival. I saw him growing up tough and strong, but also lonely and distrustful.<br />
<br />
“I had to be tough. If I showed any weakness, the pack would take everything from me.” Max snarled. “I couldn’t rely on anyone. I couldn’t trust anyone.” I felt a surge of empathy for him, for the hard life that had shaped his personality.<br />
<br />
“You’re not alone anymore.” I said gently, trying to comfort him. “You have me. You have friends. You can trust us. We can help you. Together, we can be the kings of the dock!”<br />
<br />
“Fuck you. I don’t want to be a docker forever. I have bigger dreams than that. Now shut up and let us sleep. We have to get up before sunrise.” Max snapped, shutting me out again.<br />
<br />
“Okay, okay. Good night, Max.” I said, giving up for now.<br />
<br />
“…Night, crafty ghost…” Max muttered, his voice softer than before.</p>
