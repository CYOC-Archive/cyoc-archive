<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dave had recently came into possession of a large share of money from a nearby pharmaceutical company, the thought of been able to carry on his research in a more practical and comfortable lab was exciting. He had already spent a large sum of the money on expensive equipment such as an MRA scanner and an electron microscope. With these tools he would be able to figure out the mystery behind this package he had received.<br />
<br />
Now Dave didn&#39;t mingle with illegal drug trafficking often, it was far from the norm for him however he felt obliged to do so this time. When he first found out about the &quot;Lunar Ectasy&quot; he thought it was just some sort of hoax, however that was before he saw the CCTV footage of that female scientist who was transfigured into that abdominal monster. It was terrifying to Dave however also very exciting, this was the first real proof that werewolves existed and that this drug was the key to finding out what made them.<br />
<br />
There had been previous cases this year of slaughters in the news however there was no connection between this drug and those murders back then. Now it was obvious to Dave, no one had survived an encounter with these creatures and as far as he knows anyone who took the drug seemed to die a week or so later, so its makes sense why it hasn&#39;t leaked. <br />
<br />
The real question though was what sort of remarkable substances this drug was must to cause such mass mutation. <br />
<br />
All this information though was only from the briefing file which came with the money and the package. So to find out more information Dave would have to look down at the microscopic layer of this drug.<br />
<br />
He walked towards the package which he had laid on his table, it was a small white suitcase with a combination lock on it. Very secure. The briefing had mentioned that the spread of the drug was aerosol so he had to be careful how he picked it up. He put on his mask and gloves and entered the combination.<br />
<br />
As soon as he did this he heard a voice behind him &quot;So we&#39;re opening mystery boxes now&quot; said a snarky voice.<br />
<br />
Dave turned around closing the lid of the suitcase &quot;No, sadly its not exciting as that&quot; Dave said quickly looking at the woman in front of him.<br />
<br />
It was his partner Jean, she was wearing a similar lab coat to him however it had been &quot;modified&quot; by her to reveal her large cleavage.<br />
<br />
She looked up at him and laughed softly, &quot;Well you don&#39;t know if its exciting or not, after all it is a mystery&quot; she slowly walked up to Dave and put her soft hand onto him. He groaned softly and stuttered &quot;I don&#39;t think this is the best time for this&quot;, he said pushing the suitcase up the table.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmmmm&quot; she muttered now inches from his face. They stared at each other for a moment. Dave was close to giving in to his temptation, but refused, this wasn&#39;t the best time for this especially with what substances he had right behind him. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ugh- your so boring Dave&quot; Jean said standing backwards.<br />
<br />
&quot;What have you got there anyway&quot; she said peeking over at the suitcase.<br />
<br />
&quot;Our newest assignment, from the fellows at Rainbow&quot; he said picking up the suitcase.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hm? I didn&#39;t know we had any new specimens?&quot; she said cautiously darting her eyes quickly between Dave and the suitcase.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well it&#39;s urgent according to them, looks like they didn&#39;t have time to send it anywhere else&quot; Dave said. He too was curious why the company had sent the drug to them and not a more experienced sector, after all they didn&#39;t really have the equipment to analyse it properly.<br />
<br />
Jean laughed again &quot;Oh...thats where you got the money from&quot; she walked over to the new microscope and touched the cover. &quot;Well it must be important then&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well what is it&quot; Jean said walking back over to Dave.<br />
<br />
&quot;Here have a look at the briefing&quot; Dave said handing her the clipboard. <br />
<br />
She took her time reading it, most likely checking it over to make sure it was legit. She was the sort of person who was cautious over receiving these types of mystery packages. <br />
<br />
&quot;Lunar Ectasy- wait wasn&#39;t that in the news a while back?&quot; she said putting the clipboard down. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes I think so&quot; Dave said looking down at the suitcase.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well can I have a look at it&quot; she said holding out her hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, but be careful, it spreads in the air&quot; he said handing her the suitcase.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you take me for? An idiot&quot; she scoffed, she walked over to the equipment cabinet and stitched her special sensor mask around her face. It was made of a fine impermeable silk, that Dave had given her a few Christmases back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Lets do some Science!&quot; she said opening the suitcase. Inside was a small plastic clipped bag with a white substance in it. The first thing Dave noticed was how little of it there was, only filling 1/8 of the small packet. The second thing he saw was the label on it. Jean had also noticed this and began to read it:<br />
<br />
&quot;WARNING, this is a highly contaminated substance that must be treated with the upmost care- Oh do we really need to read this, its just like all the others&quot; she said taking the packet out of the suitcase.<br />
<br />
&quot;Its better safe to be sorry isn&#39;t it?&quot; Dave said softly.<br />
<br />
&quot;True, but when has science ever been about being safe&quot; she said comically. <br />
<br />
Dave watched as Jean started to examine the substance placing it on a microscope slide and checking out its key components. She inserted the slide into the microscope and sat down. <br />
<br />
She wiped her forhead &quot;Phew, it&#39;s getting hot in here, did you turn the AC off or something?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll go check&quot; Dave said leaving the room. He was sure he turned it on when he had entered the building, but he had better check anyway. He walked towards the thermostat, and read it. The AC was active, maybe Jean was developing a cold.<br />
<br />
Dave started to walk back to the lab. On his way though he heard a loud noise in his pocket. He got startled but then it was realised it was his phone. He pulled it out and answered it:<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello who&#39;s there?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh Hey Dave its just me Jake, I just wanted to tell you I am heading to your lab&quot;<br />
<br />
Jake was the person who had written the briefing for the Lunar Ectasy, Dave barely knew him only talking to him once before over email about the drug. In fact he was the one who had sent the CCTV footage to Dave.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why?&quot; Dave said curiously.<br />
<br />
&quot;We just wanted to make sure everything was going okay, it&#39;s not really your typical work day is it&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No...I guess not&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Anyway did you get the package&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, my partner is currently analysing the drug&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Good, how are the masks we see sent you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Dave stopped in his tracks. Masks. <br />
<br />
&quot;Wait what do you mean?&quot;<br />
<br />
There was delay this time.<br />
<br />
&quot;The masks, which you know...block the drug from working its effects???&quot; <br />
<br />
Dave was silent, however he knew that Jake had caught onto this.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh....shit!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I have to go!&quot; Dave said ending the call and running back into the lab.<br />
<br />
He looked around and saw that Jean was still at the electron microscope looking at a printed slide from it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh hey.....I&#39;m sorry I took my lab coat off, it was getting really hot in here...but look&quot; she said lifting up the micrograph. &quot;The drug&#39;s composition is incredible, no wonder it causes mutations it&#39;s been specifically engineered to cause the release of stress relieving hormones and the virus in it, attacks the cells and injects them with these proteins which cause them to mutate. There&#39;s nothing about the increased body mass though, I&#39;ll have to do an MRI scan, have a good luck at the DNA sequence....hey whats wrong?&quot; she said looking at Dave who was breathing heavily.<br />
<br />
Dave walked over to the table and looked inside the suitcase &quot;Everything okay?&quot; he said looking over at Jean.<br />
<br />
&quot;....Yep, outside of the heat, did you check the AV, i&#39;m burning up over here&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think...did you umm...see any masks in that suitcase?&quot; he said cautiously.<br />
<br />
&quot;No...why?&quot; she said looking up at him.<br />
<br />
Dave could tell Jean was reading him like a book. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh....&quot; she said slowly taking the mask of her face. She went to stand up but collapsed on the ground. She groaned loudly trying to sit herself up. Dave made to go help her however she shouted &quot;No you&#39;ll get contaminated too...if you already haven&#39;t&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh god&quot; she said wiping her sweaty forehead, grasping hold of one of the nearby table legs. She convulsed slowly at first, groaning louder each time. &quot;Urgh....Dave....fuck.....I feel......oooh....&quot; she said her body getting wet with all the sweat. Dave knew this was what it meant by the stress relieving hormones, it must of been numbing the pain.<br />
<br />
She lurched forwards as her chest cracked, she cried out as her back contorted. Dave could see her bones pushing against the wet shirt. &quot;Oh fuck!&quot; she yelled out as her body continued to transfigure. She pressed out her hands against the floor, watching as the fingers started to curl into claws and palm stretching out. While the figure in the video had changed very quickly it looked like Jean was changing much slower.<br />
<br />
Dave was in shock wanting to help her, however knowing if he did he might change as well. As far as he saw there was no masks inside the suitcase. So what the hell was Jake talking about.<br />
<br />
Jean screamed out, as her cleavage spontaneously burst outwards ripping through her bra and subsequent top. She groaned loudly trying to stop it, pressing against them however this only encouraged her breasts to further enlarge. However it wasn&#39;t only her breasts which were enlarging it was her bones too, stretching out further than physically possible, she would be getting more slender if it wasn&#39;t for her muscles which were now inflating. She looked like one of those female wrestlers. By now her entire physique was that of a bodybuilder with massive breasts. &quot;Oh fuck, Dave...help me...come to me&quot; she said whispering to him while lying on the floor. She attempted to move towards him, however he only moved backwards. <br />
<br />
&quot;I feel...so...FUCKING GOOD! she said her skin now ripping up revealing ink black hairs. Her body was soon consumed by this fur until she was completely covered. Now she looked like the woman in the picture without the snout or the ears. Jean to Dave&#39;s horror picked herself up and slowly advanced towards him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dave....my baby come to me! this is it! This is the time, you and me were waiting for&quot; she said softly. She was a few feet from Dave now. However she fell backwards as she felt immense pressure on her sexual organs. She convulsed on the floor again crying out, however this was soon drowned out by the mass cracking of her head as it changed into a snout. Her teeth ruptured out her mouth with new long sharp ones forming in their place. Her ears sharpened and pricked up as well. Now Dave saw the monster.<br />
<br />
She groaned softly, Dave looking down at her under the brightly lit light. She was unrecognizable now. <br />
<br />
&quot;J-jean....are you still there&quot; he said slowly walking towards her. She suddenly pounced upwards onto Dave, he screamed as he was thrown down below her.<br />
<br />
&quot;DAVE!!! I WANT YOU TO FEEL ME!!&quot; she said growling loudly. Before she could do anything however there was a loud bang from the other side of the room. Jean was thrown off of Dave into the nearby equipment closet. Dave looked over to where the sound came from, there was something standing there reloading their shotgun.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi Dave, it looks to me like theres been a biohazard breach!&quot; He said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait Wait! Don&#39;t!&quot; Dave said still recoiling from the impact.<br />
<br />
&quot;Who the hell are you anyway&quot; Dave said now standing in front of him.<br />
<br />
&quot;We were just talking a minute ago, on the phone&quot; he said imitating a phone call.<br />
<br />
&quot;J-jake&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thats the one!&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
&quot;What...wait...wh-&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll answer your questions later, for now we need to get out of here&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;What why?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Lets just say this hasn&#39;t been the only breach&quot;<br />
<br />
Jake helped Dave towards the door. &quot;Lets g-&quot; before Jake could finish his sentence they heard a low growl from the room.</p>
