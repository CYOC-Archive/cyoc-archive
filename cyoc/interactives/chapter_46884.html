<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I woke up some time later.  The air of the room felt cooler against my body and I quickly realized I had changed back.  I could feel soft skin against my arms instead of coarse fur so I knew that Alexa had also changed back to human.  She was still asleep.  I tried to move my arms and let go of her, but found that I could not without disturbing her.  I did not want to wake her up so I stayed in my position.  I had no idea what time it was, but I knew it was night because it was dark outside the windows of the living room.  I hoped it wasn’t too late.  <br />
<br />
I noticed that the television was still turned on.  I looked up as best as I could and saw Rick still asleep on the bed.  He was in the same position so once again I knew the wishes worked perfectly.  It appeared that he was moving around slightly so I knew that he wouldn’t be asleep much longer.<br />
<br />
Alexa was still asleep in my arms.  I had to wake her up so I kissed her lightly on the neck until I heard her make soft noises of approval.  “Wake up, babe,” I whispered in her ear.  “Rick’s waking up.”<br />
<br />
“Mmm…Rick…” she said.  Then she sat upright and turned to face me.  “Oh, shit, I forgot about him.”  She rubbed the sleep out of her eyes and asked, “What time is it?”<br />
<br />
I sat up and was able to see the microwave clock.  It was 10:30.  “10:30,” I said.  “A little late.”<br />
<br />
“Oh, jeez,” she said.  “What if he woke up and saw us?” she asked worriedly.<br />
<br />
I smiled.  “He didn’t.  I made a wish before I fell asleep that he would stay asleep until we woke up,” I explained.<br />
<br />
“Good thinking,” she said.  She looked at the television and saw that he continued to awaken.  “We better give him something to do,” she said as she stood up.  She rubbed her hands over her body.  “Ew, I feel kind of dirty.  I need a shower.  Wait a sec.”  She smiled with an idea again.  “Maybe I don’t.  I wish that I was clean as if I had just taken a shower.”  A second passed.  She didn’t look any different, but she ran her hands over herself again.  “I definitely feel clean now,” she said.<br />
<br />
“That’ll save time,” I said.  I made the same wish as I stood up.  “At least the ring doesn’t have a sense of humor and we ended up dripping wet,” I added.<br />
<br />
Alexa laughed.  “Yea, good thing,” she agreed.  “Not like we wouldn’t have been able to fix that.  Now where are my pants?” she asked.<br />
<br />
Now it was my turn to laugh.  “You wished them off,” I reminded her.  “Gonna have to wish them back, I suppose.”  We wished back our clothes and got dressed again.  “Now for our maid.”  She looked back at the television.  Rick was awake and he just sat on the bed.  He seemed to stare at the dildo in bewilderment, as if he couldn’t remember what he did with it.  “Turn that off,” Alexa said.  “No need to explain that to him.”  I wished that the television didn’t show Rick’s room anymore and Alexa called for him.<br />
<br />
We heard the door open a few seconds later and Rick dutifully walked down the hall back to the living room.  He wore the thong again, so he had remembered to put it back on.  “What can I do for ya?” he asked cheerfully.  Either he was sincere or terribly overacting.<br />
<br />
Alexa gave me the answer.  “No need to fake it, Rick,” she said.  “I wouldn’t be happy to be in your situation either.”<br />
<br />
He sighed heavily.  “Fine,” he said.  “Whatcha want me ta do?”  he asked.<br />
<br />
“I have a question, Rick,” I asked.  “Doesn’t your accent bother you at all?”<br />
<br />
“What accent?” he asked.  “Whatcha talkin’ ‘bout?”<br />
<br />
That satisfied my curiosity.  He was trapped in this body and the voice was evidently part of it.  He probably sounded normal to himself.  “Nothing,” I answered.  “Just…wondering.”<br />
<br />
Alexa interrupted me.  “You want to know what you can do,” she said.  “We have to go out for a while.  You can dust the whole place.”<br />
<br />
“Where y’all keep that stuff?” he asked.<br />
<br />
“I wish you knew where all of the cleaning supplies were so that you didn’t have to ask us these questions,” she answered.<br />
<br />
“OK, he said.  He went to the kitchen sink and pulled out the necessary supplies.  “I’ll get it done.”<br />
<br />
I cringed at what he said.  It sounded a little too close to a phrase I didn’t like.  Alexa held out her hand and said to me, “Come on, Joey, we must be off.”  I took her hand and she led me out of my apartment.  “Don’t know when we’ll be back, so if you finish, just call it a night, Rick,” she called over her shoulder.  <br />
<br />
We walked into the building hallway and I closed the door behind me.  Alexa led me over to the door to her apartment and opened it.  We both walked in and closed the door behind us.  I looked at her.  She had another mischievous grin on her face.  “What’s on your mind now?” I asked.</p>
