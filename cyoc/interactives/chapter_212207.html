<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Elizabeth decided to become a live teddy bear. A very cute one and moving around would be fun. If she became an inanimate teddy bear, well, she would be helpless if she wanted to transform herself back into a human. It was much, much safer than staying inanimate and be at the mercy of every person or dog around. So she pressed in her demands and waited for the Chronivac to work its magic. She was impatient to see the world as a teddy bear! And indeed the changes took effect immediately. She shrunk and her insides became full of stuffing. Her skin became incredibly fluffy and she felt her face flatten and her eyes widen and become round. Her ears shifted to the top of her head. Her tummy bulged out and her fingers and toes become so round that only a bump for a thumb remained. Elizabeth was worried at becoming a round figure and losing her curves yet she was more astonished at sensing her own clothes shift and transform around her body. She was keeping her clothes? And why did they wrap themselves as a full skirt? As the transformation stopped, she walked to the full-length mirror in her room. Well, she toddled a few tentative steps and fell, only to discover she had no strength to get upright. She could only go around on her hands and knees, like a baby. Was her body that weak? Well, it WAS made of stuffing, after all. However, her reflection in the mirror made her understand things more clearly.<br />
No wonder she could only walk around as a baby! She was a teddy bear dressed as a baby! The thick skirt was in fact a diaper, covered by rumba panties and she was dressed all in pale pink, a onesie with a bib with a picture of little mouse in a ballerina outfit and a bow of a brighter pink atop of her head, right between her two round ears. Her color was of a pinkish white and from a plastic chain was  dangling a pacifier. She was a cute teddy bear indeed, but a brand of cute that referred to babies! This was humiliating! She looked ridiculous! But... Well, she could go around a bit like a baby, just to see what happened. So Elizabeth, looking very much like the cutest baby, albeit a teddy bear, went off to explore.<br />
<br />
Seeing the world in such a different way was intriguing and very interesting. Everything was so big! It made everything so different! And the garden! The trees towered over her and the grass a funny jungle to explore! All to her new discoveries and losing herself into a real babyish fascination with the world, Elizabeth became very much oblivious to every thing else. She thus shouted out in fear when a huge hand siexed her and she found herself in the muscled and huge arms of a man. A behemoth now, thanks to her now tiny size! <br />
&quot;What are you doing here all alone, sweetie?&quot; said the man kindly, before stopping and staring at the animated teddy bear he was holding instead of a baby as he had first thought.<br />
He stared at her incredibly.<br />
&quot;Let me go,&quot; said Elizabeth in a tiny babyish voice. <br />
&quot;What...What are you?...&quot; stammered the man.<br />
To hide his discomfort, he poked Elizabeth on her belly gently, the way all adults love to poke babies they find adorable. Elizabeth giggled uncontrollably at the tickling, which made the man coo at her. He was a big softie, that one. He asked her more questions and as Elizabeth had no time to think about a remotely convincing lie, she had to tell the truth about the Chronivac. The man&#39;s mind whirled at this. Such an object of power! With it, he could do anything! Especially solve all the problems of his life, and that of his husband! He had to get his hands on this marvel! The transformed girl said she was alone. He told her he&#39;d change her back if she told him where the Chronivac was. Tired of her situation, wary but being so helpless, Elizabeth accepted. The man dashed into her home, seized the Chronivac and darted away from Elizabeth&#39;s home, the baby teddy bear still in his arms.<br />
&quot;Hey! You said you&#39;d change me back!&quot; she cried in her baby voice.<br />
&quot;Yes... After...&quot; grumbled the man, focused upon his running. <br />
Elizabeth feared the man had other plans in mind...<br />
<br />
And indeed, as the man entered his home, a small apartment he shared with his husband who was still at his job, he set the baby on the couch and made himself a cup of coffee.<br />
&quot;Change me back!&quot; cried Elizabeth again.<br />
&quot;Yes... We&#39;ll get to that...&quot; mumbled the man.<br />
He fiddled with the Chronivac and set the coordinates to change an old pizza box into wads of bills. It worked and his eyes sparkled with glee. He tried again on different remnants of boxes and soon bills covered every surface of the kitchen table.<br />
&quot;Stop that! Change me back! You promised!&quot; cried yet again Elizabeth.<br />
&quot;Of course, sweetheart,&quot; smiled the large man.<br />
He typed in coordinates but Elizabeth didn&#39;t have time to ask what he was doing and why he did not consult her. She felt her body transform immediately. Her fingers reappeared and she felt her toes again. Her insides became human again and the stuffing disappeared. Her hair fell upon her shoulders and her skin became pink and soft again. She was human again. But... Why was her hair coiffed into ringlets? Why was she dressed as a baby still, in the same clothes? Why could only gurgles escape her mouth? Why were her fists tiny and her fingers refusing to unfurl? Why was she weak and only capable of jerky movements? Why was she a baby? The large man approached, looming over her. <br />
&quot;You&#39;re adorable,&quot; he gushed. &quot;My husband and I always wanted to have a baby girl. Now, it&#39;s real! I&#39;ve transformed you into the most adorable baby girl, to grow up into a gorgeous young lady! You&#39;ll be in ads and TV and bring in lots of more money! And my husband will mollycoddle and pamper you! He loves children! Just a few buttons and you&#39;ll forget your memories, leaving a silly little girly girl who loves her daddies very, very much. You&#39;ll live a nice wealthy life thanks to this machine. It&#39;s the least I can do to thank you for bringing it to me! We&#39;ll adopt you and transform something into an adoption certificate, toys and a nice room. But my hubby will love taking you shopping, don&#39;t worry!&quot; <br />
Elizabeth fussed and started crying. No! She didn&#39;t want to be a sweet cute girl that lived in a sugary world with two fathers that treated her like a little doll! She&#39;ll be mollycoddled and pampered all day long and from what the man said, there would be a lot of pink, cuddles and baths involved. Treated like a little princess while acting life a loving little girl was not her idea of a fulfilled life! And she be engulfed in loving adoration for her two new parents without realizing what she had lost! No! She wanted to be smart! Not a silly cute little things that was to be a doll to tickle and pamper and put to bed! She had to...<br />
It was too late. The Chronivac had altered her mind and from a fussy baby of six months, there was now a gurgling smiling baby reaching out to the man to be held and hugged, to which he obliged eagerly. The man smiled. He could already picture his darling husband lovingly cooing at their new daughter while walking in the park as she was in a pram. That and a myriad of other delicious fluffy activities.</p>
