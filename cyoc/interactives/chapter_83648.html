<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">However, the djinn didn&#39;t left immediately he gave Drake a gift, not out of any sense of regret but as merely a token for having freed him. He gave him the power to recruit little friends so his new childhood wouldn&#39;t be lonely.<br />
<br />
==========================================================================================<br />
<br />
Drake had a cousin, Tommy was his name, although 3 years younger, they were very close growing up, those days life had gotten on the way and Drake and Tommy didn&#39;t see each other that often. But the memories of those days still remained in Little Drake for his cousin was attending the barbeque with his girlfriend Molly.  When Drake saw  his big cousin Tommy he sprung from the ground and toddle his way to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why, hello champ being a little nudist aren&#39;t we?&quot; said Tommy ruffling Drake&#39;s hair, the fact that Drake was actually taller than him didn&#39;t even registered as odd. Drake smiled from ear to ear and hugged his cousin. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oww! he is adorable.&quot; said Molly not realizing that it was a naked grown man hugging her boyfriend.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hehe... ok that&#39;s enough big guy, now run along!&quot; replied Tommy trying to pry himself out of his cousin embrace.<br />
<br />
&quot; &#39;Kay&quot; said Drake and said goodbye with a toddler smooch, one of those that&#39;s more saliva than anything else. Unbeknownst to everyone that kiss sealed the spell Beldazarr put on Drake, as soon Tommy would realize.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry, didn&#39;t know my cousin would be a little streaker, it&#39;s a weird thing that my mom used to do with me.&quot; explained Tommy.<br />
<br />
Molly giggled, &quot;You were also running naked when little? tell me you have pictures, hehehe. Maybe you ought to join your cousin.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah right, would you like a lemonade?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tommy left Molly alone for a moment while he went to the table where the drinks were placed, he began feeling a little dizzy, he hoped Drake hadn&#39;t had anything contagious, he was planning to score tonight and the last thing he needed was the flu. He grabbed the pitcher, but suddenly a full pitcher was too heavy for him, he tried to serve a couple of cups but ended up spilling it all over the table and on himself.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m so sorry.&quot; said Tommy drenched in lemonade.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh dear.&quot; his aunt Lisa came to him. &quot;Don&#39;t worry son, everyone has accidents, let me clean this up.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Darling, give your shirt or it would stain.&quot; said his mother.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, right. I&#39;ll go change.&quot; said Tommy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh there&#39;s no need the weather is warm enough.&quot; said she stripping him off his shirt. <br />
<br />
&quot;Mom!&quot; complained the teen, but then his mother saw that his socks were also wet.<br />
<br />
&quot;Give me these too.&quot; said taking off the shoes and socks out of his son, leaving him barechested and barefooted.<br />
<br />
Tommy returned to Molly, but now only in shorts, sure the wind on his flesh on such a hot day was nice, and the grass tickled his soles, still he was the only one not fully dressed, well except for little Drake who was happy playing with the sprinklers they had set for him.<br />
<br />
&quot;What happened to you?&quot; asked Molly.<br />
<br />
&quot;A little accident with the lemonade. But nothing to worry.&quot; perhaps he could play this on his favor, sure he could be a klutz in her eyes, but he could be a handsome klutz at least, he tried to show off his muscles to her he flexed his biceps, he always had a crush for neighbour Molly &quot;Beside this way there&#39;s much of me to see.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What little is there to see.&quot; she joked and then she whispered to him alone. &quot;Let&#39;s try this again when you get enough hair.&quot;<br />
<br />
He was struck down. For all uses and purposes Tommy was quite the jock actually, sub-captain of his soccer team, but if you saw him right now you&#39;ll believe he was in the swimming team, since no trace of body hair graced his torso (or nether regions). However Tommy was hurt, he just wanted to make friends and he felt Molly was being mean, he had tears in his eyes when something else made its way from inside his shorts. <br />
<br />
&quot;Mrs. Jenkings Tommy wet himself!&quot; Molly yelled for everyone on the BBQ to hear. Tommy felt guilty and began to cry.<br />
<br />
&quot;I knew it was too early to try big boy pants on him.&quot; She came from behind him and pulled his pants down, his penis flopping about as she did it. Molly helped him to walk out of them and then, altought he was the same size as her, she hold him and patted his back, his butt resting on her hands.<br />
<br />
She took him with Drake, which by now was muddy from feet, hand and buttocks. Molly put Tommy down and Drake rushed to his side. Drake was elated to have his cousin join him in play. He grabbed him and drag him to the sprinklers. Tommy was still sniffing when the water him, and then saw the huge smile of his cousin, it made him feel better. He wanted to play with his cousin, they pranced around the water, their willies bobbing around without a care on the world, soon he was just as muddy as Drakey nakey, he was enjoying himself too much that he didn&#39;t notice stray leaf on a very slippery mud, he tripped and fell on the ground.<br />
<br />
And for a brief moment the old Tommy came back, to realize he was naked and covered in mud, he had peed himself in front of his girlfriend and his own family was laughing at how silly the were the antics of the &#39;&#39;little&#39;&#39; tykes. He was utterly humiliated, and not being able to hold himself he began to cry, which each tear his adult mind was forever lost, and he was bawling. Molly saw this and went to comfort him. Angela was content that Molly, their babysitter, was so good with his son and nephew.</p>
