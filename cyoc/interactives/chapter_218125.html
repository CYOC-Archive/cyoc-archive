<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><br />
Jeff woke up the next morning and rubbed his stubble. He still wasn&#39;t used to having it. A few days ago he&#39;d been a baby faced teen with zero facial hair. His skin had been smooth as soap. Most boys in college didn&#39;t have his level of stubble now. It was so thick and his face had filled out completely. He now had laugh lines and wrinkles throughout his face. His face had character in it, Jeff thought, looking in the mirror. That&#39;s when he realized he didn&#39;t just look like a 16 year old who might pass for 21 or 22 because he had facial hair. He looked much older. He looked like a man in his 30s. His hair hadn&#39;t receded entirely yet, but it had gone up his forehead by about two inches. His forehead was now wider than before. <br />
<br />
The Chronivac had settings which naturally altered reality and the bet had already been made for Jeff to take on all his father&#39;s rights, habits, triggers, desires, and addictions regarding drinking and smoking to go to the winner. Jeff thought about that first word. He had all the rights of an adult now so the Chronivac had made him into an adult. Jeff blinked. There was something else slightly off...<br />
<br />
His father entered the bathroom and Jeff gaped. The once hirstute man was now a baby faced teen, gangly and with hardly any muscle mass. Jeff had begun to fill out but he wasn&#39;t quite the size his father had been. The young teen washed his face and brushed his teeth. &quot;Hi, son,&quot; he said, his voice a number of octaves higher than it had been the day before. <br />
<br />
Mike looked different. Very different. He looked like he could be a choir boy or play little league. He looked like he had the face of a 14 year old with no facial hair, on top of a gangly 16 year old frame. <br />
<br />
Jeff was now taller than his father by a head. He wasn&#39;t quite as tall as his father had been. He was now 6 feet tall exactly while his son now stood at 5&#39;6&quot;. Genetics seemed to retard the AR Virus kids, who almost never grew as tall as they had been once before after contracting the virus. They usually grew somewhat short, halting their growth at an average of 5&#39;3&quot; so even though they matured, they looked forever boyish. Contrasting this were the Skippers, who normally grew to be taller than they would have had they not inherited the Skipper genome. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, Dad,&quot; Jeff grumbled, noticing that his voice had dropped and now sounded the part of a typical 30 year old. <br />
<br />
&quot;You must be tired. You&#39;re the Dad now,&quot; his surly teenage &quot;son&quot; replied. Then he remembered they had swapped roles long ago as well as titles. <br />
<br />
Jeff now remembered when they had contracted their mutual diseases. He had been 4 years old when he had been diagnosed with Precocious Puberty aka Skipper Syndrome. He had looked to be the age of 18 by the time he was in grade 6 and now he looked to be about 30. Having the body of an adult gave him all the rights and privileges of one. <br />
<br />
His father hadn&#39;t been so lucky, contracting the rare and non contagious AR virus when Jeff was 12. It happened in some families. No one knew why the mutation occurred usually within the same family that a young son became an adult early. Fathers of Skipper children were 2,000 times more likely to contract AR virus, resulting in an entire portion of the populace where fathers and sons swapped ages. About 15% of all families now had this dilemma and society had adjusted to fit their needs. <br />
<br />
Since his father&#39;s mind had reduced to that of his teen self, Mike could no longer work the job he once had, whereas Jeff&#39;s mind had matured and absorbed the ability to adapt. He learned job skills in special classes at the age of 10 when he was taken out of regular school and started attending one with Skipper kids who were much faster growing. <br />
<br />
He had been working at his father&#39;s old job. Mike&#39;s boss had worked out a plan for Jeff to work at the factory and Mike had gone back to school.<br />
<br />
Jeff smoked his morning cigarette outside while his &quot;son&quot; made him some coffee and put together a breakfast of oatmeal and raisins with orange juice and eggs on toast. Mike had taken on some domestic duties lately in order to earn some more allowance money from his former son and Jeff was encouraging his former father to do chores around the house until he was able to find a job at a local shop or movie theater. Jeff was a good looking man, swarthy and handsome. He drove them everywhere and had just begun to give his former father driving lessons, and Mike was still a nervous driver whereas everything was old hat to his former son, who drove with complete confidence. <br />
<br />
Mom had left Dad when he contracted AR Virus. Most women did. The divorce rate was almost 85% for couples that went through this experience, though with gay male couples that rate was only about 50%.  <br />
Jeff was raising his new son on his own. <br />
<br />
He drove Mike to his high school and let him off, wishing him a good day. Mike was in a club for other AR kids. It had been psychologically jarring for him to enter junior high when he first shrunk. Mike had to give all of his former clothes to his son, who was growing into them like a weed. <br />
<br />
Jeff got to work and clocked in. His father&#39;s job was now his. He was a machinist and he worked hard at it, operating complex machinery with precision and skill. He performed everything pretty naturally. He came home as if everything had always been this way and his new son came home from school, bounding upstairs to go to his room. He heard his former father jerking off and chuckled to himself. Ah, the life of a teenage horndog...<br />
<br />
Jeff thought to himself that he liked the changes in their family. He felt at home in this body. He was a handsome adult male and he could fuck any woman that chose to be with him. He had a son to take care of...but he found an old photo album. Mike never looked at photos of his former self but Jeff was fascinated. His father had been 6&#39;5&quot; and had towered over other men. Mike had a hairline almost totally receded whereas Jeff still had his hair. Mike had been incredibly muscular whereas Jeff had turned out to have a rather slim to average frame, but nothing hugely impressive. <br />
<br />
He wanted to experiment. Finishing another cigarette outside, he made his decision...<br />
<br />
Mike was still jerking off when his &quot;dad&quot; knocked and entered into his room unceremoniously. <br />
<br />
&quot;DAD!! Knock first!&quot; Mike screamed at his former son, his shrill voice making his new father laugh a little too much. <br />
<br />
&quot;Son, it&#39;s nothing I haven&#39;t seen before. I thought I told you to take that pile of leaves and bag it.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, alright!&quot; Mike put his pants and belt back on. <br />
<br />
&quot;What are you watching?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;NOTHING OKAY!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Hehehe. Sure.&quot; He laughed at his son blushed. Jeff continued. &quot;I bet you wish you could just keep jerking off all day and not clean anything up for the rest of the week.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I do!&quot; Mike&#39;s surly teenage hormones were in full overdrive. All 5&#39;6&quot; of him. He looked down at Mike and smiled a secret smile...all bets would be forgotten....<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll make a deal with you. You jerk off for the rest of the day and not clean anything else this week and in return I get your old genetics and grow to be your old height and get your old muscle mass.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;How about my old hairline?&quot; Mike said sarcastically. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, sure. All of those. Deal?&quot; <br />
<br />
Mike scoffed. &quot;Sure, Dad. Whatever you say.&quot; They shook hands and reality shifted dramatically...</p>
