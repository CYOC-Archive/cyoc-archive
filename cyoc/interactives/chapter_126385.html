<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Kellie watched Katie and Lisa walk away she began to think about what she could do with the rest of her afternoon. Gloria and her friends had left for home leaving Kellie alone in the park. Looking around she was not sure what to do. Gloria had close friends now and their did not seem to be anyone that Kellie wanted to use the ring on. Shrugging the teen decided to walk around and enjoy the mid May sun. As she walked she began to think about what the future held for her and her friends.<br />
<br />
The girls were sophomores and would be completing school in less than a month. A fun and entertaining summer seemed to be on the horizon, which would hopefully give Katie or Kellie their drivers license. After that Junior year would be entertaining for the group. Samantha would be hopefully still be dating Mike while the Katie and Kellie would continue  being a couple. Mika and Claudia, who had always been social butterflies, would casual date people around school. Hopefully the remainder of high school would an enjoyable experience for the girls. As Kellie continued to walk she absentmindedly began to think of Mary Elise.<br />
<br />
Mary Elise was the only one who was not actively dating anyone at school. While she was pretty, and a good friend of Kellies, she remained hopelessly single. The girl was more interested in studying then any romantic adventures. Kellie however could see that deep down she was somewhat jealous of the fact everyone else appeared to be dating except her. Kellie wanted to help her but wasn’t sure how. She didn’t know of anyone that was interested in Mary Elise, that fact frustrated Kellie slightly. Katie was able to help her friend Samantha find love but Kellie was unable to do the same for her friend. As Kellie turned the corner she suddenly realized she had turned onto Mary Elise’s street. Looking at her house she could see the pretty redhead sitting on her porch reading.<br />
<br />
“Hey Mary,” she called. Mary Elise looked up from her book and smiled. “Hey Kel,” she called. “Fancy seeing you here. Where’s Katie?” Kellie shrugged as she approached the house. “She went shopping with her aunt after we finished babysitting,” she said. “I decided to just take a walk after that and found my way over here.”<br />
<br />
Mary Elise smiled as she put her book down. “Well it’s nice to see you,” she said. “With all the excitement yesterday we really didn’t get a chance to hangout. All that dating stuff made me feel like a fifth wheel, kinda sucks being a dateless wonder.”<br />
<br />
“Come on Mary you don’t need to feel like that,” <br />
<br />
Mary Elise smiled sadly as she looked at her friend. “I know,” she said. “It’s just that between Claudia constantly dating and now you and Katie I kind of feel out of place. I worry that you guys aren’t going to have enough time to hangout out with me anymore.” Kellie placed her hand on her friends shoulder as she tried to comfort her. “We’ll find someone for you Mary,” she said. Mary shrugged and grinned. “I don’t know, maybe. It’s kind of hard to find a guy whose interested in science and comic books.”<br />
<br />
Kellie giggled as she thought about Mary Elise’s interests. Mary’s academic interests and comic book obsession were not exactly the most popular activities for a teenage girl. While Kellie enjoyed those things she could understand how Mary was having a difficult time. Finding a guy who liked those things that she was interested in was hard in high school. Kellie was determined though, if they could find someone for Samantha certainly they could find someone for Mary Elise. <br />
<br />
“Hello Mary how are you today,” a man said. Turning Kellie could see an older man next door waving to the girls. Mary Elise smiled as she waved. “Hi Professor Kane how are you,” she said. Professor Kane smiled as he looked out towards the street. “I’m doing just fine thanks,” he said. “Just getting some fresh air before I finish grading these finals. How about yourself?”<br />
<br />
Mary held about the science book she was reading. “Just enjoying the book you recommended,” she said. “You were right, this book on Stephen Hawking is fascinating.” Professor Kane smiled. “I had a feeling you might enjoy it,” he said. “Most people would be bored to tears by some of his theories but I’ve always found it interesting. Even when I was your age science was alwaysnof love of mine.”<br />
<br />
Mary Elise returned his smile with a nod. “Well professor you know me too well. Guess we both have a different take on what we find fun.”<br />
<br />
Kellie smiled, this was too good to be true. Looking down at her ring Kellie made a wish and watched.<br />
<br />
Professor Sebastian Kane was in his early sixties with receding grey hair and a thin build. Kellie watched as Sebastian began to grown younger. The mans grey hair began to regain the ebony color of his youth as he reentered his fifties. The wrinkles around his face began to lessen  while his grey eyes seemed to brighten ever so slightly. By the time he hit 50 Sebastian possessed salt and pepper hair and fierce grey eyes.<br />
<br />
Kellie watched now as he began to relive his forties and thirties. Sebastian’s hair continued to darken becoming more black than grey. Kellie watched as the bald spots on Sebastian’s head began to fill in. As he grew younger his hair began to slowly creep forward. By the time he became thirty again Sebastian had a full head of black hair with a smooth unlined face. Kellie could see the mans body was beginning to fill out as well. Sebastian had been a relatively skinny man at sixty, as he grew younger Kellie could see muscle begin to return to his narrow frame. <br />
<br />
Sebastian possessed a wiry yet muscular appearance with a narrow waist. While not an athletic man he appeared to be in shape. Kellie thought he was handsome to a certain extent with his dark hair and smooth face. Quickly though Sebastian began to retreat into his twenties. The academic appeared less like a professor and more like a student now. The man possessed an average build with piercing grey eyes and a kind yet handsome face. Kellie watched as that face continued to soften as he approached college age. The man was quickly becoming a boy now, his dark hair becoming thick and full. His face, unlined and inquisitive, possessed a look of someone yearning for knowledge.<br />
<br />
As Sebastian retreated through college and once again became a high school student Kellie could see the boy become skinnier. The muscle he possessed in his twenties faded slightly giving him a skinny build. Now only 17 Sebastian was a tall skinny teenager with wild black hair, piercing grey eyes and a kind yet handsome face. Smiling now he looked at Mary Elise. “Hey Mary how are you,”<br />
<br />
Mary Elise smiled and blushed slightly as she looked at the handsome boy. “I’m doing pretty good Sebastian how are you?”<br />
<br />
Sebastian smiled sheepishly as he adjusted is ill fitting pants. Kellie could see the boy looking at Mary longingly, he obviously was interested in her yet now searched for words to express himself. “I’m good,” he said quietly. “I was wondering though what you were doing later?”<br />
<br />
Mary shrugged shyly as she looked at Sebastian. “Nothing really. Why?”<br />
<br />
Sebastian shuffled his feet while looking at the ground. “Well I was wondering if you would like to go to Comic con with me next weekend,” he said shyly. “I happen to have an extra ticket and knew you were into that sort of thing. Plus I was thinking checking out the science museum next weekend too if you’d rather do that.”<br />
<br />
Mary Elise stared dumbfounded at Sebastian now, almost at a loss for words. “Really,” she exclaimed. “You want ME to go with you?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah,” Sebastian said shyly. “Unless you don’t, which is cool I understand.”<br />
<br />
“But why me?” She asked.<br />
<br />
Sebastian shrugged. “I don’t know. I mean I like you and we do share a lot of the same interests. I just thought it would be fun to go out together.....like a date.”<br />
<br />
“Sebastian I would love to go on a date with you,” Mary Elise exclaimed. Sebastian smiled brightly as he looked at the the pretty redhead in front of her. “Cool,” he said awkwardly. “So, um it’s a date. I guess I can call you so we can figure out what time.”<br />
<br />
Mary Elise nodded enthusiastically as Sebastian smiled. “Um I gotta get going but I’ll stop by later to talk, Okay?”<br />
<br />
Mary Elise responds with an enthusiastic yes as she watched Sebastian head back inside. “Oh my god I have a date,” Mary Elise exclaimed. Kellie smiled as she now hugged her enthusiastic friend, happy to have once again made one of her friends happy.</p>
