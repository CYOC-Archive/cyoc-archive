<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Uhm… sorry… just milk?” Heather said, hesitantly, “nothing else?” Wanda looked over at you, wondering what you were playing at. Admittedly, you had no idea why you asked that. Something about thinking about Wanda’s growing boobs made you think about milk, and you just blurted it out. You sat there for what felt like three years, before going back on your previous comment,<br />
“A-actually it’s fine! I don’t know why I ordered that.”<br />
“No no, it’s okay. I can do that for you… I’ve just never heard of someone asking for ‘just milk’ before… especially with a free coupon.” She said, scratching the back of her neck awkwardly, “and for you?” She asked Wanda, failing to make eye-contact entirely,<br />
“I’ll… have the same.” Wanda said, glancing at you with intrigue.<br />
“Oh… okay!” Heather replied, shrugging her shoulders, “why not. Two glasses of milk coming up… they’ll be ready in a minute or so.” Heather walked back to the kitchen, looking puzzled but clearly she was a fan of this strange interaction. She walked off, her hips swaying and her butt jiggling as she did. Wanda, yet again, was unable to stop staring.<br />
<br />
“What the hell are you playing at, dude?” Wanda asked,<br />
“What’s the problem?” You retorted, “a guy can’t ask for a glass of milk and be satisfied?”<br />
“Nah… you’re up to something again. You’re being extra weird, getting her to sit on my lap, talking about the size of my tits, and acting dumber than you are. What’re you planning?”<br />
“Nothing.” You lie, “but let me ask you a weird hypothetical question.” You start,<br />
“Sure, why not.” Wanda said, leaning in closer with a wide grin on her face,<br />
“If you had a magic power to grant wishes, and could make anything in the world happen right now… particularly in this cafe, what would it be?”<br />
“What’re my limitations?”<br />
“Be creative.”<br />
“Knowing me, I’d probably make you a woman with huge tits.” She snickered again, you couldn’t help but let you a slight chuckle,<br />
“So you like tits?”<br />
“Obviously…” she replied, tilting her head, “you’ve known me for almost five years, and you’re asking ME if I like tits?” She almost cackled with laughter,<br />
“I’m just checking.” You smirked.<br />
<br />
“Hi! Here you two go, I hope you enjoy. It’s the last of the milk, straight from the fridge.” Heather said returning with two glasses of milk on a tray, each glass with a straw,<br />
“I wish she trips and spills milk all over Wanda.” You whispered, smirking.<br />
Suddenly, Heather found herself tripping over her own foot. She yelped out loud, a few of the other patrons looked over just as Wanda’s glass was tipped forward, the glass falling off the tray, and the milk spilling out onto Wanda. In a splash, Wanda’s face, chest, and pants were covered…<br />
But strangely, the other glass fell onto the table right in front of you. Sitting perfectly upright. Not a single drop spilt.<br />
<br />
“FUCK!” Heather shouted, looking incredibly embarrassed, her hands hovering in the air unsure of what to do, frozen in shock. Wanda sat there in astonishment as the milk soaked into her pants, cardigan, and tank top. She wasn’t wearing a bra, so the wet patches made her breasts pretty apparent in her top,<br />
“I-I…” Wanda stammered, looking over at you as if you’d done something here, “it’s okay.” She said, standing up. Dripping with the white liquid.<br />
“Maybe an apology favour is in order.” You said smugly, clapping your hands together, looking Wanda in the face.<br />
“What the fuck are you doing?” She asked, looking a little pissed off,<br />
“You know, since Apology Favours seem to be the most ‘sacred’ thing about our culture, I’m sure they reach beyond the bounds of feesability.”<br />
“Seriously dude… this isn’t funny.” Wanda said, looking pretty angry,<br />
“Calm down.” You said, holding your hand in front of Wanda, “I wish that apology favours mean that you can ask for whatever you want… and I mean WHATEVER.”<br />
“Huh?” Wanda asked, “that’s already how they work, you dipshit.” She said, rolling her eyes. She turned to face Heather, letting out a deep sigh, “it’s okay, seriously.” She said, Heather looked incredibly guilty.<br />
<br />
“I can get you anything, really.” Heather said, “I’ll find a towel, some kind of rag— I can even give you my top if that would help!” She insisted,<br />
“No no…” Wanda said, “honestly… just get me another drink, I really don’t care.”<br />
“Oh…” Heather said, looking guilty again, “w-we don’t have anymore milk, unfortunately.”<br />
“Ugh…” Wanda said, frustrated, “then just give me whatever fucking milk you can.” She snapped. She leaned down to pick up her bag, ready to leave as soon as possible.<br />
“Of course…” Heather said. Seemed to be brace for something.<br />
<br />
In a matter of moments, Heather’s unform began to tighten around her chest. Just as you predicted, her breasts were growing, and likely filling with milk. They stretched her uniform, as they grew fuller and heavier, the fabric of her top started to squish them. You looked at the front of her apron, as suddenly two obvious wet patches began to appear. It was mesmerising to watch someone’s entire biology shift right before your eyes. You watches as the wet patches grew bigger, and her bust grew even larger. Then the top split at the side, ripping more and more as her breasts become slowly more exposed. Before long, they were fulled burst through her top, now creating at a tent on her apron. You could actually see drops of milk coming from her huge, long, dark nipples, dripping onto the floor.<br />
Heather grabbed her large breast, and picked up the spilt glass on the table, “this should only take a minute…” she leaned over, and squeezed. Milk sprayed out, slowly filling up the glass.<br />
Admittedly, you were creating quite the tent in your own pants… and you had absolutely no shame in it. You looked at Wanda, but she didn’t seem to be having as much fun as you were. Maybe this wasn’t so exhilarating, just a normal thing to see in this new everyday life. Maybe it was the context that made it not so sexy?<br />
“I wish Wanda was enjoying this a little more.” You whispered, wishing your friend a little more pleasure in what was going on.<br />
<br />
To your shock, you watched as Wanda’s eyes lit up with mesmerisation, “I’ve never seen a woman produce so much milk…”<br />
“O-oh…” heather said, looking a little flustered. She was trying to squeeze as much milk out of her breasts as fast as she possibly could, “neither have I.” She chuckled,<br />
“That’s the magic of Apology Favours, huh.” Wanda said, unable to get her eyes off Heather’s chest.<br />
“Hah… yeah.” Heather said awkwardly. The glass was almost full… but Wanda wasn’t ready to let it go.<br />
“Y’know, I wouldn’t mind a second round?” She asked, a cheeky smile playing on her lips,<br />
“Oh! Uhm… sure, I’ll have to grab another glass from the back?”<br />
“Nah, I can take it from the source…” she said. Heather’s face went red, she wasn’t sure what to say. She just wanted to empty her breasts, but it was clear by her facial expression that she was more than happy to oblige with the request.<br />
“Absolutely!” She said, trying to act professional, “the customer is always right, as they say. Please, just… be gentle.” She said, a simple kind smile.<br />
<br />
“Holy shit.” You said, watching as your friend walked up to this waitress, grabbed her huge breasts, and latched herself onto her nipples. And like a baby, she began drawing milk. You watched as she swallowed gulp after gulp of this rich, creamy milk, running down her throat.<br />
You just sat there, sipping on your own milk, watching as these two attractive women pleasured each other in the most unconventional way you could’ve dreamed, a completely public place. And absolutely no one was judging them for it.<br />
Sure, a few men were glancing over… but it was no different than a casual glance at some cleavage. People were acting like this was an everyday scenario. You couldn’t believe it.<br />
<br />
You had literally changed reality!</p>
