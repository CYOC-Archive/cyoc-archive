<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mal sighed and set aside his phone after another guy pinged him. He was popular, but he was only really interested in getting Charlie to contact him. Maybe if he had been single and was using the DILF pill for fun he&#39;d have messaged a few of the guys, most of them were cute. Skyler was on his own phone, playing on some app, maybe even the same one.<br />
<br />
Another ding had Mal reaching for his phone, then once he saw the screen sitting up. &quot;It&#39;s Charlie.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No shit?&quot; Skyler leaped out of his seat and came over to Mal, peering over his shoulder. &quot;How can you tell? You can&#39;t see his face in the profile, and it says Chris is the guy&#39;s name.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s him.&quot; Mal said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Chat him up, see if you can get him to send a pic with his face. Just to be sure.&quot; Skyler leaned over, watching as Mal typed out a message. &quot;Hey, stud? You&#39;re really going with that? God you are bad at flirting.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry, I&#39;ve been with the same guy for eight years, I&#39;m a little rusty.&quot; Mal sent the message anyway.<br />
<br />
&quot;Eh, you&#39;re supposed to be older anyway, it kind of works. Okay, lure him in, gentle. You don&#39;t want to spook him by coming on too strong.&quot; Skyler shifted around to sit on the coffee table and watch as a few messages passed back and forth.<br />
<br />
Mal read them aloud for Skyler&#39;s benefit. &quot;He&#39;s asking if I&#39;m looking more for hookups, or just some chatting.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Chatting, but you&#39;d be open to see where it goes.&quot; Skyler prompted, motioning Mal to reply. Mal nodded and gave a thumbs up.<br />
<br />
&quot;That works for him.&quot; He murmured.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good, ask to exchange pics, but send it with one of you.&quot; Skyler leaned forward, then frowned as Mal went to just snap a face shot. &quot;No, not like that. You need to be sexy about it, show some nip or something. Here..&quot; And without asking, Skyler leaned forward and pushed up Mal&#39;s shirt, guiding the bottom over and behind his head so his meaty chest was on full display. Then he reached out and squeezed both of Mal&#39;s nipples.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ow. What the fuck?&quot; Mal asked, backing up and giving Skyler the stink eye.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just perking the girls up. It&#39;d be better if you had some hardware on them, but this will work. Now move one arm behind your head and try to look casual as you snap the photo.&quot; Skyler smirked as Mal glared but did as instructed.<br />
<br />
&quot;There. Sent.&quot; Mal was quickly pulling his shirt back down, rubbing at one of his nipples. &quot;Really? Hardware?&quot;<br />
<br />
Skyler lifted his shirt up enough to show a glinting piercing through one of his nipples. &quot;I got these when I was DILF pilling more, decided to keep them.&quot; He grinned and leaned forward, trying to get sight of the phone screen as Mal angled it away from him.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s not like I intend to keep doing this, it&#39;s just to see what Charlie is up to.&quot; Mal sighed and looked at the screen. &quot;It&#39;s him.&quot; She turned the phone to show the face and torso shot of a shy looking Charlie. He was never much of an exhibitionist despite having a nice, lean physique. Skyler nodded and stood, wandering off towards the kitchen as Mal kept up the chat.<br />
<br />
&#39;Aw, shy? You shouldn&#39;t be. You&#39;re very cute.&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Thanks, you&#39;re pretty great yourself.&#39; Mal shook his head, and Skyler said he was bad at flirting.<br />
<br />
&#39;I like the boy next door type. So, are you really just on here to chat?&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Well, chat and look.&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;No hookups?&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Not yet. I&#39;m still figuring some things out.&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;You mean if you&#39;re into men?&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Yeah&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Well? Are you?&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;I&#39;m beginning to think so. Hey, I&#39;m going to go take care of something, but I&#39;d like to chat with you again, if that&#39;s okay?&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Looking forward to it.&#39;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I don&#39;t think he&#39;s actually cheated on me yet...&quot; Mal said, looking up then frowning as she spotted Skyler. He was leaning on the counter, stripped down to just his briefs. He had his hands pressed to the counter as his muscles slowly grew, she could see each one flexing as it pressed against his skin, some veins rising to the surface.<br />
<br />
His face was still his, though it was aging before her eyes, his boyish good looks becoming more distinguished, as his blond hair paled, the stubble on his face becoming dotted with gray. Either he shaved himself smooth, or the DILF pill had ideas on what he should be, because his smooth chest sprouted a thicket of curly blond fur, from which his silver nipple piercings glinted. Annoyingly, he didn&#39;t seem to put on any of the weight Mal had, instead just gaining a good amount of solid muscle, making his slim build into that of a routine swimmer. He wasn&#39;t as bulky as Mal, but was still nice and solid. It wasn&#39;t as dramatic a change as Mal had undergone, he looked like a Skyler aged two decades. Two decades he spent running, swimming, and hitting the gym.<br />
<br />
He looked just a little sheepish as he saw Mal looking his way. &quot;Sorry, seeing you made me miss it.&quot; He stretched his arms over his head. &quot;God, I forgot how strong I felt like this. Is it weird I feel better older than I do younger?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A little. He wants to keep chatting.&quot; He said, wiggling his phone, &quot;But I think I got all I will out of him tonight.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, snap some pics to send to him later. I&#39;m getting those jeans and we&#39;re going out for drinks. We shouldn&#39;t waste having time on these pills just lounging around the apartment. We&#39;re hitting the bar.&quot; Skyler picked up his discarded clothes, moving to head into his bedroom.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sky, I&#39;m not sure I want to go out like this.&quot; Mal said, standing up to follow.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh live a little. I&#39;m not asking you to find some twunk to stick your dick in. I&#39;m just saying lets go get a few drinks, maybe do a little harmless flirting, and unwind a little. You need it. Though it would be a shame to not use that cock of yours. It is impressive. Besides, I need some more gay friends and at the moment you fit the bill.&quot; Skyler pulled out a pair of jeans and a shirt from his closet and tossed them to Mal. &quot;See if those fit. Then we&#39;re going, no arguments&quot;</p>
