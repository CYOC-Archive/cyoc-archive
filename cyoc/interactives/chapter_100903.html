<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jake had to admit that he had fun at the lake.  Gina&#39;s family was very nice, and they were very kind to him.  Well, except for Brin.  She had constantly pestered him, asking him endless questions, and challenging some of his answers.  It was obvious that not only did she not like him, she did not trust him.  But it didn&#39;t matter to him.  She could think what she wanted.  As soon as it was 8 pm, he was going to use the medallion to change his body back to its old male self.  In the mean time he had enjoyed himself with Gina&#39;s family at the lake.  The barbecue was delicious, Gina&#39;s Dad was funny, and Gina&#39;s Mom was very caring and welcoming.  It was a good day.<br />
<br />
But now that evening was here, he was ready to change back into his old male body and return to his old life.  He sighed and watched the sun set on the lake.  Gina touched him gently on the back and startled him.  He turned and was surprised to see that she had shrunk herself again.  She now looked to be about 6 feet tall.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, you shrunk yourself again?  So I guess it&#39;s time.  I can use the medallion again, &quot; said Jake.<br />
<br />
Gina nodded quietly. She looked around to make sure that they were alone.  &quot;You know you don&#39;t have to, right?  You had fun today, I could tell.  You can stay like this forever if you want.  I don&#39;t mind, and I will never tell anyone who you really are. Is it really that bad - being my sister?&quot; asked Gina.<br />
<br />
Jake sighed.  &quot;Your offer is tempting, but this just doesn&#39;t feel right.  I am still a guy at heart, and I feel uncomfortable in this body.  Besides, I have my own family, my own life.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, Jake.  I understand.  Just give me one last hug before you go,&quot; said Gina.<br />
<br />
Jake leaned down and gave the shorter girl a hug.  She grabbed onto his wrists tightly, and he felt the familiar tingle.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Gina .... What are you doing?&quot; said Jake, as he struggled to get out of her grasp.  He looked down, and saw the necklace in her hand, pressed tightly against his skin and hers.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shhh.  It will all be over soon.  You will get new memories, new mannerisms, and you will forget about your old life, &quot; said Gina, as she continued to make contact with him.  She had read that the longer the subject had contact with the medallion, the more characteristics would be transferred into their mind.<br />
<br />
Jake&#39;s body started to shrink to match Gina&#39;s height, and his mind began to get cloudy.  He slowly began to see new memories: memories of tea parties and dolls, memories of ballet and dance classes, memories of being the tall girl in a class of short girls, memories of being an outcast as he continued to tower over other kids, and finally memories of gaining acceptance as a star athlete.<br />
<br />
&quot;Stop, let go of me.  Something is wrong, &quot; said Jake weakly.  Gina could feel him shifting.  His hips swayed a little, and he no longer had the posture of a boy.  She saw him toss his head to get the hair out of his eyes, just like she did.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just a little longer, Tina, &quot; said Gina with excitement. &quot;Then everything will be normal.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you talking about? &quot; said Jake, as he shook free of her grasp and pushed her hard.  Gina recognized it as a technique her basketball coach had taught her.  &quot;My name is Gina, not Tina.&quot;<br />
<br />
Uh, oh, thought Gina.  I may have held on a tad bit too long.<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you girls doing?  You have only been sisters for one day, and you are already fighting? Gina, please explain yourself, &quot; said Mom.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, &quot; said Gina and Jake at the same time.<br />
<br />
&quot;I said Gina, not Tina, &quot; said Mom angrily.<br />
<br />
&quot;I am Gina, &quot; said both girls at the same time.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh dear, I think we have a problem, &quot; said her Mom.  They were both wearing identical swimsuits from Gina&#39;s collection of clothes, which she had insisted they wear before swimming in the lake.  Now she could not tell the difference between them, aside from the fact that one of them had a strange medallion in her hand.  She didn&#39;t think it would be a problem, but she never imagined that the strange new girl might try to steal her daughter&#39;s identity.<br />
<br />
While her Mom was still pondering how to tell her daughters apart, Brin pondered over what she had seen and heard from her hidden position in the bushes.  She didn&#39;t understand everything, but from what she gathered while spying Gina had acquired some kind of magic medallion.  It had the power to shrink you, as well as mess with your mind.  She wondered what else it could do.  Maybe help her grow taller, like her sister?  She hated being the runt of the family, a measly 5 feet tall even though she was just a year younger than her sister.  Her sister was always complaining about how horrible it was to be so tall, but she had no idea how miserable it was to be small.  But maybe it was time for her to find out. <br />
<br />
Brin wasn&#39;t exactly sure how the magic medallion worked, but she knew had to have it.</p>
