<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">…another furred shape bolted into the fray, bounding on all fours from the direction of the road. It slammed into the second werepanther, sending him flying with a startled ‘Yowl!”. Then Ryan’s rescuer dived upon Paul, desperately attempting to use her weight to hold him down. Ryan and Claire were taken aback as their eyes and keen noses took in the sight and scent of…<br />
<br />
“Save your mate, Ryan!” Barbara barked at him.<br />
<br />
Seeing the abrupt turn in her fortunes, Irena the werepanthess roared her fury, and advanced, stepping over Claire’s legs on her rear paws. She raised a forepaw, ready to slash Claire’s furred throat with her extended claws. But Barbara’s intervention had brought Claire hope and new fire. Quickly remembering her self-defense classes from evening school, she locked one of her lupine feet behind Irena’s legs – and then kicked out hard with her other leg at her attacker’s knee…<br />
<br />
Irena screamed as the impact broke her kneecap. She twisted and fell down into the gushing stream. <br />
<br />
“Yoowwll…!” Irena fought to keep her balance in the water as she gripped the hard earth of the bank, hating the sudden bath. Claire joined Ryan at the edge of the stream. They exchanged lupine grins.<br />
<br />
“Let’s cool our kitty down! Then she can dry off in a cell,” Ryan snarled. Claire nodded.<br />
<br />
Together, they dunked Irena into the stream. She squirmed – but she was no match for the combined strength of the werewolf couple. Pulling her out of the stream to cough up water as her body slowly reverted to human form, Ryan left Claire watching over her, whilst he checked on Barbara. She was still holding Paul in place. Snatching up his taser from the ground, Ryan soon subdued the second werepanther.  <br />
<br />
He sighed with relief, and nodded to his kindred friend. “Thanks, Barbara. You…came after us?”<br />
<br />
Barbara grinned, letting her long tongue loll out as she recovered from her exertions. She affectionately licked Ryan’s face. “I wanted to make sure you kids were getting on okay, after your phone call to me. And I fancied a night run… So when I heard the racket, I just followed your scents.”<br />
<br />
“We’re grateful…that you did,” Claire declared, walking slowly over to them as she got used to her new lupine legs and feet. “You saved our pelts, my…sister.”<br />
<br />
“Yes, we’re pack sisters now, Claire.” Barbara smiled and hugged the other wolfwoman. “Welcome to our race. Glad you changed your mind, as well as your form!”<br />
<br />
“Yes, I’m glad too. Thanks to you and Ryan.” Claire beamed.<br />
<br />
“I better call for police back-up from my cell phone in my pants. But first…let’s get my first proper look at you, my wolf-girl!” Ryan prised Claire away from Barbara, and drank her all in – sight and scent. He gave his sideways grin, then he looked downcast. “I’m so sorry… I wanted your first night to be special, and those ferals nearly took you away from me…They will be dealt with, I promise you.”<br />
<br />
“Not…your fault. And whilst fighting a werepanther…wasn’t amongst the excitement…we had planned…, I’ll give you plenty of opportunities…to make it up to me!” Claire smirked. She angled her lupine head forward and licked at Ryan’s healing wounds. “So… How do I look?”<br />
<br />
“Come on. The water here’s too gushing to reflect you, so…” Ryan took her half-paw in his and led her to his pile of clothes. Managing to operate his cell phone with his stunted digits, he took a picture of the new Claire, whilst she lay on the ground – keeping watch on the groaning Irena (who had fully reverted back to human form in her exhausted state). Then Ryan showed her the photo. <br />
<br />
“Wow…!” Between the photograph and her examination of herself stretched out in the moonlight, Claire regarded her fursona with mounting excitement. She estimated that the transformation had gifted her a little extra height and muscle – and she was now a few inches shorter than Ryan’s six-foot tall frame. Her coloring was mainly black-furred, with grey and white markings in places – especially around her stomach and her husky-like face – with the underside of her chin and her neck as pure as snow. Her fur felt wonderful and it protected her from the chill of the night. Her claws, fangs, and stronger muscles had served her well too. They had helped to save her life…<br />
<br />
She stroked her chest and new teats, and grinned up at Ryan. “I’m more like…a B cup now, under this fur! I’m perfect… Thank you, Ryan. Thank you for making me kindred. For making me your mate.”<br />
<br />
“You’re welcome, my beautiful lupine lady.” Ryan smiled back. “By the way, don’t forget it’s your body. It’s up to you to determine for yourself what is right for you. Personally, I think you’ll be about the same size as this in your altered human form.”<br />
<br />
“Heh! Even better! I’ll need to get some new bras…But that’s fine. I didn’t become a werewolf…to change my human figure – I became a werewolf for us. But do save that photo. I will want it to remind me always… of this joyful moment.” Claire smirked, feeling that she was getting used to talking with her altered mouth and vocal cords. She handed Ryan’s phone back to him, and he used it to alert his police team, informing them of the situation with the now-subdued feral werepanthers. Meanwhile, the latest werewolf of Moon Lake gazed out over the lights of the town with her lupine eyes, and smiled. <br />
<br />
Finishing his call, Ryan sat on his haunches next to his mate. They embraced, and Claire felt herself becoming aroused as their fur brushed against each other. Plenty of opportunity for that later, she told herself. I’ll need to learn strong self-discipline.<br />
<br />
“How do you feel, Claire?” Ryan asked her, smiling. “Apart from what your scent’s telling me, that is…”<br />
<br />
“I feel…good. No! I’m still healing – but I feel…fantastic! I feel…right, Ryan! Overwhelmed by all the scents and sounds, though.”<br />
<br />
“You’ll learn to filter them in due course. Anything else?”<br />
<br />
“Yes… I feel…hungry.” Claire grinned. “You were intending to share dinner with me here, weren’t you?”<br />
<br />
“You betcha’. But we need to change the plan.” Ryan looked across to their pack sister. “Barbara! Can you rustle up some food for us all? Get some scraps too, for our…guests.”<br />
<br />
“Sure! Back in a few minutes, whilst I get ready some rabbit and mouse burgers. Hope you remembered to bring the buns!” Winking at them, Barbara dashed off on all fours in the woods – leaving her fellow werewolves snorting with laughter.<br />
<br />
Recovering herself, Claire sobered up. “The big secret of this town…is now my secret too…,” she whispered as she and Ryan looked across Moon Lake. “I’m not just a human resident now, I’m a were-creature citizen. This town is my sanctuary... My home. Our home.”<br />
<br />
“Yes - our home, Claire. And as for our happy life together… Well, we’ve only just begun!” Ryan nuzzled and nipped Claire’s furred face, and she eagerly responded in kind - keen to share their scents. They then instinctively howled their gratitude at being alive, as well as giving thanks to the moon for Claire’s re-birth. Tomorrow, Ryan would sort the legal registration of Claire Robertson as the latest werewolf of Moon Lake. And whilst the night would be a long one for them all, given the circumstances, both Ryan and Claire suspected they would finally get some fun free time together in their current forms, before dawn…</p>
