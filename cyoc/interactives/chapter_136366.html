<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The progression of Lyre/Animalia&#39;s summer events was nice, and it did give Doctor Jones some chances to pause some of his work and relax, particularly as some events like SAMAS was even allowing for displays of skill that wouldn&#39;t rely on showing off the way the A-BC would have or the potential for injury the way UFC-A did. Especially with the fact that many martial arts, while they did teach specific combat and self-defense skills, that historically were often applied to military matters, the real point in the training often seemed to focus on mental focus and self control and didn&#39;t inherently require combat. This aspect was something Doctor Jones found the most interesting, and he did enjoy seeing masters and students display their skills and what they learned. In some ways it was a pleasant distraction from some of the bigger issues that went around Animalia.<br />
<br />
Some were political in nature, as in many ways the bills designed to curb the spread of Regressive Hypersexuality Disorder weren&#39;t dead as had been climbed. In pure theory the bills were still very much alive, as the number of votes that those that had been the most supportive of Animalia were still in the minority, and especially so in the House, which had already passed those bills. The Senate was a different issue and the continued spread of Regressive Hypersexuality and the President&#39;s incessant tweeting on the subject generally kept the Senate moving toward that outright ban. And the Senate HAD the votes to pass the bill as it was. What had happened, however, was more of an amendment to the bill that was essentially something that would allow for a stall for time. One of the few conservative Senators that had run for years on Culture Wars issues put in an amendment to the bill that would essentially demand that all Homosexuals to be dosed with the Animalia virus to put an end to the &quot;threat&quot; of homosexuality. That reignited a whole different debate that cost many of the more moderate members of the majority to back off with regard to pushing the bill. The result was that the Senate shifted the bill to the back burner for the moment to try and avoid having such a potentially divisive bill in Congress coming up right before the mid-term elections. It was a &quot;victory&quot; for Horizon and Animalia, but not a complete one. The bill was more in limbo than being dead, and would really depend on the results of the upcoming mid-terms, which to many experts, it seemed likely that the faction that had been in support of Animalia stood a good chance of regaining Congress, which would put the final nail in the coffin for the bill. But, that would take time and they&#39;d have to wait until November for that.<br />
<br />
The rest related to Doctor Jones&#39;s work to help those with regard to Regressive Hypersexuality and the other cases that he had. It had been something that was really starting to strain him, as while therapy worked to help those with Regressive Hypersexuality gain control over their greatly enhanced libidos, it was something that was beginning to become stressful on him with regard tot he work that went into it. And after he&#39;d had a conversation with Nessa when Nellie was converted, he&#39;d had the realization that he needed a larger staff for his clinic to handle the case load and give Doctor Jones the ability to have free time, and with that acceptance he began putting out advertisements and conducting interviews, though, THAT created its own issues.<br />
<br />
He had a fair number of candidates, and had made promises to Bunni to include her in the practice once she completed her studies, but the interview process had also revealed other issues that Doctor Jones noticed and changed the way he was looking at the situation. That made his situation in making the choice before him difficult, particularly as it would relate to who to hire. He only had the room and budget to bring in two additional therapists, but counting Bunni, he&#39;d had four candidates, and three of which he&#39;d had actual interviews with. And that was what sat in the back of his mind as he watched some of the SAMAS events, though at least one decision was easier than others.<br />
<br />
&quot;Talon is out,&quot; Doctor Jones thought with a quiet sigh to himself, &quot;he may not be opposed to Animalia, but it&#39;s clear that he&#39;s looking at the situation far too politically, and that isn&#39;t the job that I&#39;m advertising. If he wants to be a strategic consultant for Animalia or the State of Nevada or the Democratic Party in how to deal with the President and his supporter&#39;s lunatic ideas... that&#39;s one thing, but that isn&#39;t therapy and won&#39;t help those that have already converted and have Regressive Hypersexuality... and it raises the risk of misdiagnosis having negative effects, which could happen...&quot;<br />
<br />
And Doctor Jones was certain of that. Julius Tire had been a good example of that, in that some of his past lifestyles did raise him as a potential candidate to suffer from Regressive Hypersexuality, but when Doctor Jones had gotten to interview him, he found that while Julius&#39;s libido was higher, it was still within most Animalian norms. The biggest thing that he actually needed related more to his more standard couples therapy with regard to the specific selection between Blanca and Candida. That was something that Doctor Jones couldn&#39;t determine until AFTER Julius Tire had been converted, which was how many of the Regressive Hypersexuality cases were discovered. They happened and there could be some signs that they might happen, but even with females, those potential clues didn&#39;t always mean that sort of case would happen. After all, Countess Irena and Tyra didn&#39;t suffer from Regressive Hypersexuality and they were originally in some of the same age group as those that did. That was something where Mr. Talon&#39;s more proactive mindset wouldn&#39;t help Doctor Jones&#39; practice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course... Talon was the easy part,&quot; Doctor Jones thought as he returned home and then sat on his couch, setting a briefcase he had with him on the small table in front of the couch.<br />
<br />
As he opened it, he took out his notes from the other two interviews that he&#39;d conducted and which set up the real issue behind the choices he had to make. For, not hiring Talon would only reduce the situation having three candidates to fill two spots, and in many ways the decision would be a hard one for varying reasons. One was that he&#39;d given his word to Bunni that she would have a spot once she completed her schooling. The biggest negative there was that it would take time, at least a year for Bunni to complete her online courses, and perhaps more given the workload that she was also taking on to pay for it and to raise Owen. Rockwall locked like he&#39;d be a big help for her in that regard, but even that wouldn&#39;t change the fact that it would take time for Bunni to earn her degree and that Doctor Jones needed help now... and yet he&#39;d given his word to Bunni.<br />
<br />
There was also the fact that Bunni was specifically studying into child psychology, which wasn&#39;t the issue that Doctor Jones was dealing with. There had been children that had been converted during the initial outbreak, but due to other circumstances many of them also ended up being double dosed as well. The end result was that many might have had issues with being rushed into adulthood and a rapid progression through puberty, but so far, with all of those specific cases, the new Animalian proved to be mentally stable and adapted well. The greatest stresses had been more on the parents in that their children had grown up faster than was expected, though even there, there seemed to be no problem. Those children that weren&#39;t double dosed and were largely still the same age physically as they were before their conversion also didn&#39;t show any real signs of stress that would require therapy. There might be some concerns with single dosed teenagers like Sophie, Roland, and Jessica as they went through puberty and felt the naturally high libido for an Animalian kick in... but that was something akin to growing up, and would apply even if they were still human. Most of the rest were even younger and thus didn&#39;t have that issue. And with the Animalians that had been born in the past year or so, most of them were at the oldest a little over a year old. In this, among Animalians, at least, there really wasn&#39;t going to be that great a demand for a child psychologist... but again... Doctor Jones had given Bunni his word, and he couldn&#39;t just go back on it...<br />
<br />
&quot;And then there are Swarzz and Add,&quot; Doctor Jones thought as he looked at the notes for those two interviews.<br />
<br />
Swarzz was trained in helping patients deal with depression and bi-polar disorder and other issues that had often been related to causes for suicide, which wasn&#39;t exactly the same as Regressive Hypersexuality, but Doctor Jones could see where some of the techniques that he&#39;d used could be effective in helping patients recognize things and move to control them. Swarzz had also had a relatively good success rate in that regard, which counted for good experience, and that was something Doctor Jones couldn&#39;t just ignore. And at the same time, from what he&#39;d picked up in the interview with the man, Doctor Jones had also gotten the sense that Swarzz, himself, carried a great deal of guilt over events in his own past that could need addressing. It was something that he&#39;d used as good motivation with regard to his career, and could speak to the success that he&#39;d had. But it could also be something that could strain Swarzz to the point where he&#39;d actually begin to suffer from the same things he&#39;d set out to help others with. In this, Doctor Jones wanted him around, just to talk with him and help Swarzz if that was in fact the case.<br />
<br />
Amy Add didn&#39;t have Swarzz&#39;s experience, but her studies were more in the sort of couples therapy Doctor Jones had specialized in and had found to be helpful in dealing with Regressive Hypersexuality. The condition had served to increase the libido rates in converted humans that once as Animalians, their desire went well beyond the normal levels for Animalians, and had often raised issues where the new Animalian would be far more playful with others than would often be wanted. There had been no rape cases, yet, but those situations had lead to certain actions that made some uncomfortable, particularly in their interaction with the Animalians suffering from Regressive Hypersexuality. In this the therapy was needed to help the Animalian truly gain and maintain control over themselves and thus recognize the limits to which certain things were tolerated. Add&#39;s studies in couples therapy would directly help with that sort of thing, though her greatest weakness was in that she lacked experience outside of her own education.<br />
<br />
&quot;And now I need to choose between the three of them,&quot; Doctor Jones quietly thought to himself, &quot;to honor my word... experienced success... and a novice but with a focus more directly in line with what I need...&quot;<br />
<br />
And he did find it a tough decision. His word was valuable, and he had good reasons for wanting Swarzz and Add as well, and it just made him wish he had three openings rather than two. For as it was, if he had that much room for it, he&#39;d go with all three with Bunni&#39;s spot reserved for when she completed her education. Though... as he thought about it, the fact that Bunni was still going through her education and had her own responsibilities to handle, it wasn&#39;t as though she would be ready to even take cases for at least a year. And a lot could happen in that time. In this, Doctor Jones realized he really didn&#39;t have much choice with regards to the choices he had to make on who to hire, in this, he dug into his pocket and pulled out his cellphone and dialed a number.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello? Clair residence,&quot; came Bunni&#39;s voice over the phone after a couple of rings.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello, Bunni, this is Doctor Jones, how is Owen doing?&quot; Doctor Jones began the conversation.<br />
<br />
&quot;He&#39;s doing rather well,&quot; Bunni answered, &quot;Right now... I think he&#39;s watching something with Rockwall.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And how are your studies coming?&quot; Doctor Jones asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;About the same as they&#39;ve gone... slow and steady,&quot; Bunni replied, &quot;It&#39;s all interesting and I&#39;m learning a lot... but it all takes time.&quot;<br />
<br />
Doctor Jones smiled and nodded, even if Bunni couldn&#39;t see that through the phone, &quot;Yes. I remember all that... Studying and going through certification and licensing... but in the end, the hard work can pay off.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of that I&#39;m sure,&quot; Bunni answered, &quot;So... do what do I owe the pleasure of your call? I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve been too busy just to engage in simple pleasantries.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes... I HAVE been busy,&quot; Doctor Jones answered, &quot;and it&#39;s for that reason that I&#39;m calling. As you know... I&#39;d promised you a spot with my practice once you complete all your courses.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, I remember,&quot; Bunni answered, &quot;though... if you&#39;re asking me to take short cuts to start soon, I must say no.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not actually asking for shortcuts,&quot; Doctor Jones answered, &quot;It&#39;s just that... I do need the help NOW, and in that sense... I really can&#39;t keep a position reserved until you graduate.&quot;<br />
<br />
There was a silence for a few moments, which left Doctor Jones a bit nervous. He knew this would essentially be going back on his word and could well upset Bunni who had been optimistic about a position readily waiting for her. Eventually she did answer.<br />
<br />
&quot;I understand,&quot; Bunni said slowly and her voice being rather somber in tone.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s not that I wouldn&#39;t love to have you onboard,&quot; Doctor Jones spoke at hearing the tone of her voice, &quot;as your dedication to Owen and your studies has been very touching... but at the moment, so much of my work is so focused on dealing with Regressive Hypersexuality that... I really need the help now. Now... this doesn&#39;t mean that a position won&#39;t open up when you do graduate, and I would happily provide you with any and all recommendations when that happens eve if a position doesn&#39;t open up...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Trust me, Doctor Jones,&quot; Bunni answered, &quot;I understand. I admit I was excited to have the promise of a position, as I would love to be there to help people... but the more I&#39;ve looked over the news reports on Animalia and Animalia Ambassadoria&#39;s past episodes... and talked with people in Lyre, the more I&#39;ve gotten the sense that my specialization in child psychology might not fit all that well. There might be some cases with the human children in Lyre, but not enough to maintain a sustainable practice for long. Especially with so many in Lyre that during the initial outbreak became Animalians... and double dosed Animalians, besides, and those teenagers that converted willingly later, with parental permission, and have seemed so mentally well adjusted... the more I&#39;ve actually figured it might be a good idea to go to a place where I can put my studies into child psychology to good use.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Really?&quot; Doctor Jones asked, surprised that Bunni had actually been thinking over some of the same issues he&#39;d been pondering over.<br />
<br />
&quot;Really,&quot; Bunni answered, &quot;if things change... and I suppose that&#39;s possible, well... great. I&#39;d love to be able to help children in the area. But if not, I&#39;d be more than willing to break in in a place where I can be of help with what I&#39;ve actually studied.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... that&#39;s good,&quot; Doctor Jones commented, &quot;Thank you for understanding... and if a position here doesn&#39;t open up in the future, I WILL give you a good recommendation to help you get a foot in the door.&quot;<br />
<br />
Doctor Jones took great relief in how things had progressed. The decision to choose Swarzz and Add over Bunni was a tough one, but given her present studies and the time that would take to complete combined with his present needs, Doctor Jones realized that was his only real viable option at the moment. And besides, the future was always in motion, something could happen in which Bunni might still be needed when she did finish her studies. In that, only time would tell.</p>
