<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Convincing Josh wasn&#39;t the only part of the bargain, Jake also had to convince Katie. While he essentially had her dick-whipped with his eleven inch erection getting her to agree to a another double-date size comparison was one thing, getting her to agree to a be a prize for the winner was something altogether different. Funnily enough however, this wasn&#39;t her main concern.<br />
<br />
&quot;So you&#39;re saying that when you win, you get to have sex with Liz?&quot; Katie pouted, lying in bed next to Jake, steadily stroking his nearly foot-long erection; not that she necessarily needed to, totally nude with her voluptuous D-cup breasts pressed against his side kept his oversized cock hard all on its own. Jake had sprung the question on her when she was most susceptible, i.e. after an hour-long sex session, however she was putting up a surprising amount of resistance to the idea.<br />
<br />
&quot;He was the one who brought it up, not me.&quot; Which was technically true, though Jake couldn&#39;t deny that he was actually looking forward to slipping his dick into Liz&#39;s extra large rack after winning the first size comparison. Make no mistake, Katie was big, but while Liz&#39;s looks weren&#39;t his bread and butter, he always wondered what her huge boobs would feel like enveloping his huge dick… though wasn&#39;t about to admit that aloud, especially with the face Katie was making. &quot;I&#39;m surprised that you&#39;re more worried about that rather than the chance that I might lose.&quot; He added for good measure to try and sell Katie on the idea that he was in for this more for the comparison.<br />
<br />
She rolled her eyes, &quot;Oh please. Like he&#39;d ever be able to beat a beast like this.&quot; Well so much for that approach… Though Jake could help but feel empowered by Katie&#39;s unshakable confidence in his cock-size, it didn&#39;t do him any favors when it came to persuading her. There was nothing else for it, if he wanted to make this happen he&#39;d have to suck up his ego some.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, I know I&#39;m good and all, but he can still show me up, after all, he did claim that he used to be nine inches.&quot; Jake said, quoting back Josh&#39;s exaggeration to jog Katie&#39;s memory. Though from her expression this clearly wasn&#39;t enough to sway her over. No matter, he had an ace-in-the-hole. &quot;Plus…&quot; he began, feigning modesty, there&#39;s always the chance that I&#39;ll have an &#39;off-day&#39;… like at the movies.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ah yes, that shameful day at the movie theater, when Katie had gotten a hold of his itty-bitty inch-long dick. Thanks to some adjustments with the watch the following day, he&#39;d managed to play that off as being merely the head of his softy, but the reminder still stung.<br />
<br />
However this humiliating call-back seemed to be enough to get Katie back on board. &quot;Yeah, that&#39;s true…: she admitted absentmindedly, her fingers dancing around the tip of his dick as if reliving the memory getting a soft sigh from Jake as she did. Smiling seductively at his reaction, she perked up, &quot;Alright, I&#39;m in, but on one condition.&quot; She said this while hiking her leg up over Jake&#39;s waist, teasingly tracing his cock-head against her outer folds.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah… what&#39;s that?&quot; Literally in the palm of her hand, Jake muttered weakly finding the tables turned on him as his towering cock grew to full size once more. He always seemed to go light-headed if he went more than a round after bumping himself up to double digits. Usually Katie was too far out of it to request a round two, but leaving her somewhat sane to ask a question had also left her unfulfilled, and now she was capitalizing on that fact.<br />
<br />
&quot;When you win, and I know you will.&quot; She quickly added to cut off his protest, not that she needed to what with the way she was rubbing his length between her salivating lower lips. &quot;When you win, I want you to limit your sex-session with Liz to something simple, like a just a blowjob or handjob. I want her to watch while I take care of the rest… deal?&quot;<br />
<br />
She asked this as she slid the head of Jake&#39;s dick inside her outer opening, keeping him there till he gave her a reply. Sure, missing out on having sex with Liz was one thing, but he was really into this to shut Josh up again and get a tit-fuck from his girl in the process. At the end of the day, she wasn&#39;t really his type, and even if he did want to try for a more &#39;thorough&#39; encore, he could probably win Katie over with some future deep dicking. &quot;Deal,&quot; he tiredly agreed, keen on Katie consummating her cock-teasing. Saying nothing, but only giving a grin, Katie thrust herself down onto Jake&#39;s massive shaft; a climactic start to another prolonged tryst.<br />
<br />
The next evening came soon enough what with far less prep-work taking place, what with the two couple&#39;s forgoing any pretense to what that evening would be about; a simple dinner, a quick dessert, and then, to action.<br />
<br />
The hour came soon enough, and as the doorbell rang Jake opened the door to see his adversary; Josh. Any sense of humility gone since his little dick humiliation, Josh gave a wide grin of unmatched confidence as he swaggered inside without a word. Ignoring his brashness, Jake would sort him out soon enough, Jake looked towards Liz and nearly lost his breath before managing to muster up a strangled, &#39;Welcome.&#39;<br />
<br />
Her and Josh&#39;s rocky relationship what with his size insecurity had led to her putting on a few more pounds, leaving her looking even more curvaceous than before. But while a bit plumper all around, it as clear that the bulk of it had gone to her tits. It now took all of Jake&#39;s willpower not to simply stand and stare, especially as the number she wore that evening gave an unparalled view of just how deep her cleavage was.<br />
<br />
Though his eyes were aimed elsewhere, his mind was fully focused on tit-fucking those huge boobs. If he were at &#39;full&#39; size, his dick could have easily survived those massive pillowy mounds wrapping around his shaft, but in his current state he&#39;d end up overwhelmed by breasts.<br />
<br />
Speaking of which…<br />
<br />
While he&#39;d love nothing better than blow Josh&#39;s cock out of the water with his 11 inch titan, the was more than a little chance that Liz would be particularly suspicious after he last measured in at 7.5. He didn&#39;t know if Josh had told her about his bogus routine to regain his size and use that as an excuse. Instead, he&#39;d play it safe and stick to his usual 8.5 inches and simply shrink Josh back down like he&#39;d done before.<br />
<br />
Dinner went quickly enough, with the two women exchanging the occasional bit of idle conversation whereas the men for the most part kept quiet, mulling over the upcoming &#39;match&#39;. While Katie kept eyeing Liz with looks of smug superiority in the long awkward silences that interspersed the hurried eating, Liz pointedly avoided her friends gaze. She&#39;d grown tired of Katie&#39;s better-than-thou attitude ever since that first measurement. Well after tonight that sense of superiority was going to get smacked down to the ground when Josh whipped out his new monster cock.<br />
<br />
In anticipation, Liz unconsciously started rubbing Josh&#39;s thigh under the table. Then, her hand found its way around his large shaft. When she made contact, she realized what she was doing, and blushed, regaining her composure and removing her hand… but not before give <br />
Josh&#39;s monster a quick squeeze eliciting a husky gasp from the man.<br />
<br />
Katie, not to be outdone, spent the desert course with her foot on Jake&#39;s crotch, playing with the head of his dick through his trousers, keeping his cock at near rock-hard-readiness.<br />
<br />
After only a few moments of this teasing, Jake slammed down his fork and stood up a visible tent in the front of his trousers. &quot;Enough of this, let&#39;s just cut to the chase.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;About fucking time,&quot; Katie said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck yes.&quot; Josh and Liz said simultaneously. The two, even with a month apart, were still so in sync with one another. As the four moved into the living room once more for the contest, Jake almost regretted how much he was going to humiliate his friend. &quot;So little man, you ready to get this competition started so I can show your girl what a real cock looks like?&quot; Almost.<br />
<br />
Ignoring Josh&#39;s bravado, Jake targeted his dick with the watch and while momentarily surprised at seeing the readout list him as 9.5 instead of the 8.5 he&#39;d left him at, shrugged it off and dialed Josh&#39;s size down to 4.5 inches. He knew changing him this drastically was a major risk, but on the other hand, who in the world would believe that there was a magical watch that could change a guy&#39;s dick size?<br />
<br />
&quot;Losers first,&quot; Jake said smugly as he pressed &#39;ADJUST&#39;.<br />
<br />
ERROR.<br />
<br />
Jake froze as the 4.5 he&#39;d dialed in faded and went back to it&#39;s previous size. Perhaps there was a limit to how small he could shrink someone else&#39;s cock? After all, last time he&#39;d only reduced Josh by a little over an inch. Hastily dialing Josh&#39;s numbers down by a couple inches, taking him to 8 inches instead of 9.5. ADJUST. ERROR.<br />
<br />
&#39;What?&#39; Josh was perplexed. Josh had already stripped off his shirt and was now beginning to unbuckle his belt. Desperate to tip the scales back in his favor, Jake changed attempted to change Josh&#39;s cock-size for a third, and what would probably be, final time. He&#39;d reduce him by 1.1 inches, the same amount he&#39;d reduced him in his last contest. It would put his current 8.5 incher only 0.1 point above Josh but it would be enough. Yet as Jake pressed ADJUST, he again got the ERROR message.<br />
<br />
Belt undone, Josh got a buzz on his cellphone and briefly paused as he pulled it out of his pocket, swiped to unlock it... then looking up towards Jake, gave a grin. &quot;Huh, got a couple of messages for you Jake.&quot; Confused, Jake looked up from his watch as Josh turned his cellphone screen for him to look at. His eyes went wide.<br />
<br />
&#39;Who would believe that there was a magical watch that could change a guy&#39;s dick size?&#39; Jake&#39;s rhetorical question echoed in his mind as an answer came back. &#39;The same guy who had a magical app that could adjust the length of his cock.&#39; On Josh&#39;s cellphone screen was an app with the same logo as Jake&#39;s watch. His secret was out!<br />
<br />
However, it didn&#39;t end there, as a Josh&#39;s phone also showed a message, &#39;You have three invalid adjustment attempts from an unknown device. Would you like to SYNC, BLOCK, or REPORT this device?&#39; Jake&#39;s blood ran cold; which one would Josh pick and how would this play out?</p>
