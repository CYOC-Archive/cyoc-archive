<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jess looked back at Henry as she lay there on all fours, her heavy tits brushing the ground. Her tail flicked as she looked at the bulge in his pants. This was her father, but this curse had her so horny...so horny...nobody would have to know...would it really be so bad? If he just extended that tear in her pants a little farther her needy pussy would be exposed and.. <br />
<br />
&quot;Dad?&quot;<br />
<br />
Henry swallowed hard. &quot;Jess...Jess, I&#39;m so sorry…&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dad, the curse! Please don&#39;t talk! I...I...&quot; The look on her face told Henry everything. He could see she desperately hoped he wouldn&#39;t, and she desperately hoped he would. He watched in horror as her toes began deforming, hard black keratin growing over her nails. Her feet began to grow and stretch just below the ankle. His daughter&#39;s feet were turning into cloven bovine hooves before his very eyes. And he felt his own arousal go into overdrive in spite of it. His cock was now straining desperately against his pants. He doubted if he&#39;d ever been this hard before in his life! And he could smell how horny Jess was, even without her new transformation giving it away. It&#39;s temporary if she doesn&#39;t come, he reminded himself. Still, what if he did it? What if he--oh, god. Oh, no, was this really happening?<br />
<br />
Still on all fours, Jess lifted herself from her knees to her new hooves. Her ass was now right at groin level. She looked up at him over her shoulder. She closed her eyes and lifted her tail. &quot;MmmmMMMMOOOoooo…&quot;<br />
<br />
He grabbed the seat of her pants where they had split and he tore them. Her panties underneath were soaked through from her arousal and clung to her swollen labia. He dropped his own pants and freed himself, not hesitating to pull those panties to the side before plunging himself in. Soon he felt hands grab his hips as he thrust. A warm body pressed up against him. Breasts pressed against his back. Something hot and hard pressing between his ass cheeks. A tongue licking his neck as the hands caressed his stomach and chest. <br />
<br />
&quot;Joan…&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Henry...join us, Henry. Be-e-e-e-e-e like us.&quot; Joan&#39;s voice resolved into a bleat as she ground her cock against his ass. It was so hard and smearing him with precum as it slid up and down between his cheeks. She was so close to actually doing it, actually pegging him.<br />
<br />
Henry paused for a moment. He thought he heard somebody calling out &quot;Dad!&quot; But the only other ones here were his wife and daughter. He turned his head and his lips met Joan&#39;s half-human, half-goat snout. It was different kissing an animalistic mouth, but he certainly had no complaint. He broke away from the kiss after a few seconds. &quot;Fuck me, Joan.&quot;<br />
<br />
He felt her cockhead pressing gently but firmly against his pucker and the feeling was exquisite. He willingly pressed back, grunting in a moment of pain before relaxing himself and letting her inside. Her precum made a natural lubricant and she slid inside of him so smoothly it took his breath away. A natural rhythm soon established with her cock sliding out of him as he fucked Jess, and Joan thrusting into him each time he pulled back from the cow girl. It wasn&#39;t his daughter anymore, just a cow girl with a hot wet pussy. <br />
<br />
&quot;Dad!&quot;<br />
<br />
There was the voice again. He hesitated for a moment, but then the cow girl&#39;s tail flicked up and Joan buried herself in him again as she began playing with his nipples, setting them on fire as they grew longer and thicker. He moaned and she pinched them, flicked them, tweaked them. A soft moan escaped his own lips as he felt his chest swelling with a new weight that filled his wife&#39;s hands and then some. The feeling of her fondling his breasts was so good...<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck me, Joan, fuck me…&quot;<br />
<br />
He smacked the cow girl&#39;s ass, watching the furry flesh ripple. Then, his eyes widened in surprise as she lifted a leg, hauled back, and kicked him square in the face with her hoof. Everything went dark for a moment.<br />
<br />
“Dad? Dad!”<br />
<br />
Henry woke up to Jess shaking his shoulder. He was slumped against the wall of the den, and his jaw hurt.  <br />
<br />
“Dad, are you okay? What did you do, what did you say?”<br />
<br />
Henry blinked and rubbed his jaw. He was relieved to see Jess was still fully clothed, even though her breasts were still practically spilling out of her shirt. Was that all a fantasy? “I...I don’t know. I...oh god, I’m so sorry…”<br />
<br />
Jess hugged him as her lip quivered and she held back tears. “It’s this place. It’s got you, too, doesn’t it?”<br />
<br />
Henry clasped her head to his shoulder. His fingers brushed past her cow ears and he fought back tears of his own. “I think so. I think so. I don’t know what I said, but...what happened just now...I had this fantasy and I...I can’t talk about it, Jess, I can’t.”<br />
<br />
“The way you were looking at me, the way you were...I had to hit you to get you to stop touching yourself.”<br />
<br />
Henry stood back up, still rubbing his jaw. “I don’t know what I said. I really don’t. You did right, though, making me stop.”<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I...well, I wish I&#39;d done that with mom before she…&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know, Jess. She showed me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, you&#39;re taking it pretty well. I saw it happen.&quot; Her nipples stiffened, pressing insistently against her shirt as she recalled Joan sitting on the bed, bending over, trying to reach her new cock with her mouth as she jacked it off. &quot;She was trying to suck it...I bet that feels good…&quot; A bulge began swelling against her waistband.<br />
<br />
Suck it? What? Joan had a...a dick now? Henry looked down at Jess. She had undone the button on her pants and was freeing the growing mass there. He watched Jess fondle it as four bumps formed on it, rapidly growing into tears as the udder swelled inexorably larger. He shook Jess by the shoulders as her hand began straying to her crotch. &quot;Hey! Don&#39;t you go there!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jess shook her head, the fog momentarily clearing. &quot;Sorry. Sorry, Dad, I just…I just really wish you had stuck to pen and paper, Dad.&quot; Jess crawled back to her feet. &quot;Anyway, I was gonna let you and Mom know. I found James. He&#39;s back there taking a cold shower right now.&quot;<br />
<br />
A brief wave of relief passed over Henry. &quot;Well, that&#39;s one piece of good news, at least. Is he okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes and no? I think he got some anger and frustration worked out, but when I found him he had sprained his ankle pretty bad. That&#39;ll get better, but…&quot;<br />
<br />
Henry&#39;s heart sank a bit. &quot;He&#39;s changed more, hasn&#39;t he?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah. He&#39;s got--&quot;<br />
<br />
*WHAM*<br />
<br />
Henry and Jess turned at the sound of a bedroom door slamming closed. <br />
<br />
Jess turned toward the hall. &quot;Well, you&#39;ll see, you can&#39;t miss it.&quot; She held her breasts to her chest with an arm to keep them from bouncing too much as she hurried down the hall. &quot;Cold shower time for me too, I need it!&quot;<br />
<br />
Henry swallowed hard. &quot;Son of a bitch, why is this happening to my family?&quot; he muttered under his breath.</p>
