<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">What nobody noticed yet, outside of the three goddesses, was the changes in the private religious constructions behind Curt&#39;s manor, just before his grand garden. The Buddhist temple, giant Christian cross and Shinto temple had disapered. Instead, at the other end of said garden was a single building dedicated to the currently tree existing goddesses, suggesting there was only one religion in the new reality, the one worshiping Amaterasu, Issun and Tomoyo.<br />
— – - – —<br />
Speaking of Tomoyo, said goddess could feel that, if the world really was ‘growing’ more gods it would already have more and so needed more to be made to stay stable, not that she would object to have more divine being helping taking care of Curt-dono.<br />
<br />
That&#39;s when Amaterasu and Issun rejoin their divine superior, the goddess of death (among other things) having an idea about who should join their rank next. &quot;You know, I think it&#39;s a bit cruel how Simone will see all her family die before they can help her grow into a proper adult. Maybe if we changed the drakaina&#39;s grand-mother into one of us… But if we do so, we better do it fast, she don&#39;t have a long time left in her current life.&quot;<br />
— – - – —<br />
As soon as the three goddesses are at their destination, Tomoyo shoot the old woman with the plastic gun. She had chosen “dragon”, “busty”, “maid” and “change awareness”. Like for each precedent goddess the gun created, she is now wearing a kimono so intricate not even a goddess could put it on without help, but wouldn&#39;t hinder its wearer if ever started doing maid work.<br />
<br />
The now divine dragoness gained for domains Knowledge, Education, Discipline, Advice and Psychology. Somehow, unlike her grand-daughter Simone, she is an hybrid of eastern and western dragon. Most of her body look like it belong to a western dragon, wings include, all covered in white scales. But she had bright red hair from the top of her head, between her horns, (a bit like a mohawk) and descended all the way to her tail. Most of her tail was devoid of hair, but she still had a tuft of it at the tip. She also had ‘whiskers’ similar to what one could find on a catfish (or an eastern dragon) and majestic horns that looked like an hybrid of eastern and western dragon&#39;s, while also evocative of a crown.<br />
<br />
But what surprised the other goddesses (other than Tomoyo) was the new story of the new dragoness. Akiko, since such was her new name, was a relatively recent new goddess, even in the new reality.<br />
<br />
She was born from the union of the queen of the western dragons and the son of the eastern dragons&#39; empress, in a time those titles had already become meaningless remains of a time begone, both species having long foregone their isolationist habit and integrated into human/anthro society. (After all dragon too, like every antros, could give birth to human children.)<br />
<br />
Growing up, Akiko developed the hoarding habit of her mother, but her eastern heritage gave it a twist. Instead of wanting to amass material possessions, it was knowledge she decided to collect. And since her hoard was immaterial, she could share it without loosing any, and gladly did so, not knowing it would put her on the path to godhood.<br />
<br />
That said she got the time to met love, a human named Edmund, and even become a mother before ascending. She gave birth to a boy who would end up marrying a girl who, too, was a human born of draconic parents, (albeit strictly western ones) who would in turn have kids, including a young drakaina named Simone. Edmund was gone now, death couldn&#39;t make any exception, not even for a god&#39;s lover. But as much as she missed her beloved, Akiko still had her daughter and grandkids, and it was more than enough to make her happy.<br />
<br />
The other goddesses notice they aren&#39;t in the hospital anymore, but in what look like a mix between a library, someone&#39;s personal office and maybe even a classroom. &quot;Before you ask, this is my office at home. All the book you see can be freely consulted by anyone that want to do so and, yes, that room <strong>does</strong> also serve as a classroom from time to time. I <strong>am</strong> the goddess of teaching, after all. Speaking of which, I suppose I&#39;ll have to cancel the lesson on dragon breath I had promised to young dragons. We can&#39;t let Evanson-dono be ignorant of the only religion existing, nor speak of a god that never existed, it could would really damage his reputation.&quot;<br />
<br />
Amaterasu, Issun and Tomoyo felt Akiko use her divine power to let all her students know they didn&#39;t need to come today, or in the foreseeable future. Not that Akiko didn&#39;t think she needed long to help Skyla-buch&#333;, Anna-dono, Ashley-chan, Misty-chan and Curt-dono learn what they needed to learn, but even a goddess couldn&#39;t be too careful. &quot;Sorry girls but I need to go, there is 5 students that need very special remedial lessons from Chishiki-sensei!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Did— did Chishiki Akiko juste spoke of herself…?&quot; started to ask Tomoyo, before shaking her head. She had more important maters to attend to, like creating more goddesses to stabilize their new reality.<br />
— – - – —<br />
Akiko could have teleported right into Evanson-dono&#39;s office, like the two others had done earlier, but barging in unannounced like that would have been rather uncouth. If the Shiranui couple wanted to act like ruffian it was their problem, but she certainly wasn&#39;t going to follow their terrible example! Plus, it give her an occasion to look at the dragon fountain at the manor entrance.<br />
<br />
Being the goddess of knowledge, (among other things) she remember both her old and new past like she had lived both lives simultaneously. She remember the day she first met Evanson-dono, back then Edmund was still alive. As soon as Curt had posed his eyes on her he had blurted &quot;I would like a statue of you, nude!&quot; If anyone else than Evanson-dono (or Edmund) had said this, she would have punished them. And honestly, she had expected Edmund to use his walking frame to bash curt. But to her surprise her beloved had encouraged her to accept instead. So she posed for a sculpture, and the result is the fountain at the entrance of Evanson manor.<br />
<br />
She finally enter the manor proper and was met with Meredith of all people. &quot;Ch— Chishiki-kami?!?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No need to be so skittish around me, Meredith-san. I may be a goddess, I&#39;m also a servant of Evanson-dono, and I hopped we would have become friends after working for the same man for so long. Now if you excuse me, I felt Skyla-buch&#333; and Evanson-dono needed some advices and decided to come in person. Oh, and if you see Anna-dono, Ashley-chan or Misty-chan send them to us, I&#39;m sure their input would help.&quot; Akiko know the three girls are already with Skyla and Curt, but she can&#39;t act like the omniscient goddess she is, Meredith is skittich enough as it is.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, s–sorry, but you&#39;re royalty, a–and a go–goddess on top of th–that. It&#39;s quite intimidating.&quot;<br />
<br />
Akiko shake her head. &quot;You know my grand daughter, Chishiki Simone-chan. Do you find her intimidating?&quot; Rhetorically asked the young goddess, knowing the answer was ‘no’. &quot;Because she is just as much royalty than I am, is related to a goddess, namely me, and is far more likely to have a temper tantrum than I am.&quot; She also wanted to say how little her family&#39;s tittles mattered in modern days, but knew Meredith was one of those people who couldn&#39;t accept that fact.<br />
<br />
Having said her piece, she decided to go see Evanson-dono and his entourage without more delay.</p>
