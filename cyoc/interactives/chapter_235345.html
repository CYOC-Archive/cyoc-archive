<br />
The door shut behind Elena as she donned her lab coat. It had been a week of furious work. She turned to her lab partners John and Rachel. She sized the both of them up.<br />
<br />
 John was surprisingly well built for someone who spent his days cooped up in a lab his with his slight tan and short brown hair. He was currently filling a beaker while going over his notes, studying them carefully to make sure he got the measurements right. <br />
<br />
On the other side of the room was Rachel, Elena watched as she adjusted her glasses and sighed looking at an ipad, Elena knew exactly what Rachel was looking at. Their lab had just been giving a few million dollars in funding under one, stupid, utterly ridiculous decision. Their gene lab, with all its brand new high tech equipment and funds was stuck studying some ancient myth nonsense. <br />
<br />
One of their largest benefactors had offered them the funding under the condition that they look into what she, Sakeena, had called “an ancient breakthrough in gene therapy” in some old Celtic tablets. Elena callled it “a coincidence and hot garbage”, the tablets had made a few lucky guesses on how genes worked and this damn rich bitch had fallen for it. <br />
<br />
It talked about being able to merge human “essence” with those of deer, horses, cows and pigs. Utter nonsense, but the faster she could disprove it, the faster they could use the rest of the funding for actual research. <br />
<br />
Elena walked over to Rachel and asked “pass me my notes from yesterday, I want to make sure we get this all right so we don’t have to do this again” <br />
<br />
Rachel reached over the table and passed Elena her notebook.<br />
<br />
“Isnt this interesting? They seem to have got so many things almost exactly” Rachel said in her usual perky voice “its almost like they knew what they were talking about” <br />
<br />
“Dont get me started again Rachel” Elena sighed “its just a weird coincidence”<br />
<br />
“Well I think its interesting thats all” Rachel shrugged <br />
<br />
“I mean shes right, its almost scary how precise their measurements for ingredients look” John said without turning from his work. “They have it down to the gram, how did they even weigh that stuff back then”<br />
<br />
“Don’t say that around Sakeena when she visits, dont want her getting even more crazy” Elana said smirking “she&#39;s crazy enough as is” <br />
<br />
An hour passed and John had begun boiling the potion or concoction or whatever on the burner as per the instructions and Elena was watching half interested. <br />
<br />
She noticed that the ventilation was definitely on but she could smell something sweet, something wasn’t right. She wanted to say something, tell John to stop until they could make sure they werent inhaling toxic fumes. But she couldnt, she felt safe, she felt in control. She turned to ask Rachel if she noticed the smell too. Rachel looked half asleep, she was sweating a bit too. Elena looked at he, Rachel was flushed red, the nipples on her B cup breasts showing through her shirt. Elena had never noticed how pretty Rachel was, her chestnut hair tied into a bun. Her perky tits moving up and down as she breathed, she didnt have a bad ass too if she was being honest. She probably never noticed because she wasn’t into women. Well Rachel was pretty but Elena would still dominate her, she was only 5’5 while she was 5’10, she could just grab and pin Rachel to the wall if she wanted to. Wait why was she staring at her co-worker? Where did these thoughts come from? Elena thought to herself. She had to do somethin….<br />
<br />
“Elena? You okay?” Rachel said, snapping her out of her strange thoughts.<br />
<br />
“yeah , fine, just a bit sleepy I think” Elena said, her previous thoughts fading from memory <br />
<br />
“Sakeena said she’s coming to visit soon, to check on our progress”<br />
<br />
“Oh nice, she can see first-hand how crap this all is”<br />
<br />
Another 5 minutes passes and Elena opens the lab door to Sakeena in her business suit. She hadn’t put on a labcoat like she was supposed to or a mask Elena noticed to her dismany. Thank God it was during this pointless “study”. Elena greeted her and shook hands with her as Sakeena walked in studying the room, taking a deep breathe.<br />
<br />
“Heres one of the first batches, of your project, in another minute or so we’ll take if off the burner and run tests on it”<br />
<br />
“Good, I can’t wait to see what secrets had been kept hidden from us for so long” Sakeena said, absently rubbing her necklace, it was some abstract design, that Sakeena had told Elena and her co-workers was of “ancient Chinese origin”. Sakeena was known for her eccentric streak.<br />
<br />
John and Rachel greeted Sakeena before Johns timer beeped. It was time to take the concoction off the heat.<br />
<br />
John turned the knob on the burner. <br />
<br />
With a loud bang, everything went black for Elena. She found herself on the floor, ears ringing and in pain. She reached for her ears but they werent where they were meant to be in a panic she felt around her head and she found them on the top of her head where they were meant to be. Feeling the fur around them. Wait what? She strained to open her eyes to see the lab. The beaker had broken open throwing the concoction all around the lab. <br />
<br />
She turned to the person closest to her, John and she immediately recoiled. She must have hit her head hard. He was covered head to toe in fur, he had broken through his clothes, the torn shreds around him. His face had contorted into a snout like a cow and his… her? Chest was adorned by massive D-cup breasts. John was barely recognizable but Elena could tell it was her just by her scent somehow. She studied her more to see a pair of udders below her chest. Something had gone wrong. Either she was badly drugged from the explosion or they had found something dangerous and had to get medical treatment immediatly. A small voice in her head told her this was normal, this was the new normal, this is how humans are meant to be.<br />
<br />
“Wha… what the fuck” Elena could stutter out, shocked at her own thoughts.<br />
<br />
She turned to Rachel in a similar condition, she was not covered in fur but on the top of her head lay a pair of bull horns. Her clothes like johns were torn and strewn everywhere giving Elena a full view of her heaving breasts, not as big as Johns but still very prominent. Not exactly small either. She noticed Rachel sported a tail out of her ass and her pussy. Her pussy was now no longer alone and no longer quite human either looking much more bovine.Above that bovine pussy  lay a monster, 9 inches of bovine cock was hanging between Rachels legs while she struggled to stand up. Her face remained human looking. The perfect kind of person to infiltrate human society. <br />
<br />
 Elena would need to get control of this bull if she wanted to rule she thought to herself. These strange animalistic thoughts starting to normalize itself in her head.<br />
<br />
She turned to Sakeena, the olive skinned women was standing up already, examining her new body. The remains of her suit still on her. She was covered in fur and a row of 6 tits could be seen straining through her tattered white shirt. A tail dangling from behind her skirt. Her nose had turned into an almost pig like snout. She also looked a bit more plump than before. Sakeena turned to Elena.<br />
<br />
“It worked, it worked, this is amazing, I feel strong, I feel like I could rule the fucking world” Sakeena said helping Elena to her feet. Elena stared at her bewildered. A million thoughts flying into her head.<br />
<br />
This is your experiment, dominate her,take her now before she takes over you, you know how you need her funding, you need her but you have to be in control.<br />
<br />
Sakeena passed Elena her phone. “Look at yourself Elena, look at what you have become, together we could take over the world”<br />
<br />
For the first time Elena saw herself. She saw her dyed blue hair now pushed down by a new sudden growth brown hair on top. She saw her brown furred ears at the top of her head. Her face was now drop dead gorgeous. She saw her A-cup tits transformed into Ds,she saw her stomach now adorned with muscle, she looked further down to see her 12 inch horse cock and equine pussy, she felt her tail swish behind her, she touched her winking equine pussy a slight whiny coming out of her. She felt powerful. She was the queen. SHe was to rule. This was right. <br />
<br />
She put the phone on a table gently, glanced at Rachel and John who were holding eachother, touching each other intimately. This concoction was clearly an aphrodisiac or some sort.<br />
<br />
She turned back to Sakeena who was preening herself. Grabbed her, pushed her down and put her snouted face on her now erect cock.<br />
<br />
Sakeena opened her mouth to protest but Elena thrust in. Sakeena started gagging but began to move up and down the shaft. Fingering her new sow vagina while Elena looked down at her.<br />
<br />
“From now on you work for me”<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Sakeenas assistant, Jessica ran to the lab, she had heard a bang and had gotten the nearest security guard to help her. They both rushed in to see her former boss getting railed by Elena with some kind of dildo. And Rachel under some women in a costume. The room stunk of sex and something else. Something sweet.<br />
<br />
Jessica turned to the security guard who was just as shocked as she was. Elena turned to them and told Joy and Rachel to attend to their guests. Jessica wanted to run but she couldnt. Something about this room felt safe. Felt nice. Elena got off of Sakeena who moaned as Elenas length slid out of her leaving a slimy trail of cum in its wake.<br />
<br />
“Welcome, im sure you have many questions, just sit down and i’m sure we can sort this out”<br />
<br />
Jessica could only nod, flustered by everything happening infront of her.<br />
<br />
<br />
Another hour of fucking passes and Elena turned to her new kingdom. She surveyred her ex coworkers, John now Joy was relaxing in his office after Rachel had milked her dry. The new bovine had taken to her new life well. She was covered in fur and there was no way she could leave the lab without anyone noticing. Rachel was in the lab cleaning up the mess they had made under Elenas instruction . Using a protective suit  to hide her horns, though the long bulge in her left leg would raise a fair few questions. In Elenas office sat Sakeena who after clearing her schedule for the week to avoid the suspicion of a chubby pig girl walking in to a board meeting. In another chair sat Jessica and Claud well now Claire who were exploring eachothers changing bodies. Last Elena saw Jessica had the stubs of horns growing out of the top of her head and while Claud from security had changed into a female very quickly, her more… animalistic changes hadn’t  kicked in yet. Elena turned on the record function on her phone.<br />
<br />
“Interesting, while it appears that the concoction changed us instantly, this DNA… virus, to call it such a crude term, doesn’t change people as quickly when its sexually transmitted, these half changed people, especially women will be powerful in spreading it further. Especially with the increased sex drive that comes with it. The gender that people changes to seems to be at least mostly female… mostly” She looked down at her lengthening shaft.  <br />
<br />
She put the phone down and sat on her chair. She had a few hours to think, to enjoy herself. The others had accepted themselves as being subservient to her. She was in control but she needed more. She needed to spread this gift. She had never felt more powerful, more sexy in her life. <br />
<br />
She thought to hereself. She had the rest of the laboratory to change, the campus then the larger town. The effects their bodies have seems to calm humans down with Jessica and Claire as evidence, some kind of pheromone thing but she doubted it would be just easy sending a cow woman or a horse or any other kind of animal woman out to just “chat” to people. She had to come up with something</p>
