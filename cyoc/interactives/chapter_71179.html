<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">...He felt himself drifting as he breathed in the scents of the bath oils. Opening his eyes, realising that the washcloth was no longer covering his eyes, Sandy began groping about for it. Below him the bottom of the tub suddenly vanishes and kicking his legs, he reached for the edge of the bathtub. Finding it not there, Sandy began to panic as he saw that the steam from the water had thickened and taken on the appearance of fog. Still kicking, he began to swim...<br />
<br />
...Everything shifted and he felt something like sand come in contact with his feet and moving forward slowly, looking about, he wondered how he'd gotten outside as trees poked out of the fog once and a bit. As he stood up, he started pondered over how he'd gotten to shore so fast, but realising he was naked, Sandy squatted down, ashamed by the idea that somebody might see him...<br />
<br />
...A figure approached out of the mists and realising that he was now standing on shore, wearing not a single piece of clothing, Sandy looked wildly about, desperate for a place to hide. The figure began to take shape and blinking, Sandy saw that it was the Roma who'd given him the ring. Wanting to accuse her of all his misfortunes, Sandy found he had no voice. And as the Roma drew closer, Sandy could see a smile playing across her face. Reaching for him, the Roma commented, &quot;You still don't see in the proper context,&quot; as she reached down and grasped Sandy's penis and testicles. &quot;Perhaps this will help,&quot; she declared as she pushed on his genitals and realising that she was pushing them up into his body, Sandy tried to scream...<br />
<br />
Gasping and floundering about, Sandy sat up, the washcloth falling from his face as some of the water slapped his body, the walls and went over the side of the tub. Realising he'd fallen asleep and in that time the water had gone cold, Sandy struggled from the tub, the dream he'd been having slowly slipping from him.<br />
<br />
Unsure what he'd been dreaming, but sure that it might have been important, Sandy stood for a moment, dripping on the bathmat. Reaching for a towel, he began to dry his hair as he squatted down and released the stopped. As the water drained from the tub, he wrapped the towel around his head and grabbed a second towel and began to dry off his face and than his body. When the soft terrycloth came in contact with his breasts, Sandy suddenly remembered what had been happening.<br />
<br />
&quot;At least I'm a man where it still...&quot; he started to as he dropped the towel down to his genitals and began to dry, but than dropped the towel onto the floor when he realised that he was drying smooth, flat skin.<br />
<br />
Glancing at the mirror, Sandy, seeing that he clearly lacked a penis or a set of testicles, moaned out, &quot;Noooo,&quot; and reaching down, cupped the area where his male genitals used to be. As he did this, he slowly ran two fingers between his legs, tracing out what was clearly a vulva, disturbed by the fact that he clearly liked the feeling of his fingers poking at his female genitals and that he could clearly hear his mother telling him, &quot;A lady does not touch herself down there, like that.&quot; and pulling his hand away, Sandy continued to stare into the mirror, taking in every bit of his feminine appearance.<br />
<br />
Still refusing to acknowledge that was in fact a she, Sandy reached down and picking up the towel, continued to dry herself. As he did this, he glanced at the ring occupying one of his fingers and resolving himself to go back to the carnival, he muttered, &quot;No more distractions as he wrapped the towel around his midsection, just below his armpits.<br />
<br />
Walking back to his bedroom, Sandy came to the several conclusions. The first was that he despised how much he was suddenly feeling as emotion after emotion washed over him. The next was that he was disturbed by the sudden knowledge he understood, including that it had been nearly a week since his last menstrual cycle. After that he came to realise that he was upset about he like such soft thing, like his terrycloth towel, pressed against his body. Telling himself, &quot;Get it together, man. You are not one of the weaker sex,&quot; Sandy was immediately struck by the notion that this was totally a sexist comment and that neither sex was weak or strong.<br />
<br />
&quot;Each balances each other out,&quot; he muttered and than, shaking his head, he mumbled, &quot;That's just nonsense.&quot;<br />
<br />
In his bedroom, he dropped the towel into a laundry basket and removed the one covering his head. Picking up a brush Sandy stood before a small mirror on the back of his vanity and began to first brush out his hair and than tease it into something cute, but appealing. As he did that, he let his thoughts simmer as he found himself upset that he knew so much about styling and doing up his hair.<br />
<br />
After he'd finished with his hair, Sandy headed for his dresser, figuring that all his clothes would still be for the appropriate sex, &quot;The male,&quot; he thought as he opened the top drawer.<br />
<br />
To his horror and disappointment all Sandy found was a drawer full of bras, different styles of panties and socks that were cleared designed to be worn by a girl. Slamming the drawer shut, Sandy began to search the other two drawers and than the closet, becoming more and more fraught with disappointment and horror as he realised that every piece of male clothing had vanished and all that was left was clothes more suitable for what he thought as &quot;the weaker sex&quot;.<br />
<br />
Sitting down on the bed, staring at the ring the Roma had given him, Sandy breathed in and out, collecting his thoughts. After a moment, he stood and announced, &quot;I'll make that Roma turn me back!&quot; and striding toward his dresser, he pulled out a pair of blue cotton pants that had no zipper, buttons or fastener in the front, side or back, a pair of white boxers, he'd come to the conclusion that the less he had to wear woman's underwear the better, and a white tank top with thin shoulder straps and what appeared to some sort of thing padding sewn into the inside of the shirt and would cover the front of the breasts.<br />
<br />
Dressed, hating how much a girl he looked, Sandy grabbed a pair of socks and exited the bedroom. Slipping on the socks and than a pair of shoes, he grabbed a coat he thought looked cute with what he was wearing, he purse and apartment keys. Taking one final look about, making sure he had everything, Sandy left and began making his way back to the carnival.<br />
----<br />
<br />
When he arrived back at the carnival Sandy balked for a moment as he saw how many people was attending because it was the last day. And than he thought, &quot;They'll see you as the weaker sex. Not as some pervert in woman's clothing,&quot; and approaching the front booth and the Roma sitting behind it, he paid his entrance fee.<br />
<br />
Moving quickly through the grounds, he scanned the midway, searching desperately for the stand that he'd originally gotten the ring from. When he found it, Sandy noted the number of customers gathered round and disappointed that he'd have to wait, he almost turned away. Telling himself, &quot;No. You are not getting stuck like this,&quot; he instead took a deep breath and approached the stand, waiting patiently until all but a few customers were gone.<br />
<br />
When he was sure that he could get the Roma alone, Sandy flagged him over, pulling the ring off his finger after he done so. When the man approached, Sandy could immediately see that it wasn't a man as he'd first thought but a very masculine looking woman. Shrugging it off, Sandy set the ring down on the counter and as the Roma smiled, Sandy explained, &quot;I wish to return this. I am sorry, but I cannot accept it. Plus, I think it did something to me that I'd rather not talk about in public.&quot;<br />
<br />
Still smiling, the Roma pushed the ring back toward Sandy and replied, &quot;It is yours. And what it did, it was supposed to. For now you can see things in a new, perhaps proper, context.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Listen,&quot; Sandy said as he pushed the ring away. &quot;If you know what this did, than you can undo it. I don't want to be the weaker sex. I hate what I am feeling, despise what I am knowing,&quot; and trailing off, he searched for the correct words. After a moment, he blurted out, &quot;I know what a tampon is. How to pee sitting down. How to sit wearing a dress. I even like the touch and smell of a man.&quot;<br />
<br />
The smile did not falter and as the Roma pushed the ring back, she said, &quot;Than you are starting to learn. Be happy. Not many get the option you have been granted.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sell me a different ring,&quot; Sandy demanded and than added, &quot;I don't care if it turns me into a male penguin, just as long as I am male,&quot; and as a sob escaped his lips, he muttered, &quot;I don't want to be female. I want to be male. Just, turn me back. Please.&quot;<br />
<br />
Shaking her head, the Roma told him, &quot;No. This is a good thing for you. Learn from it and grow,&quot; and turning, she said, &quot;Now, if you'll excuse me. I have customers to attend to.&quot;<br />
<br />
Horrified that he'd just been condemned to live out his life as a woman, Sandy watched the Roma approach a person looking at the finger armour. Glancing down at the ring, he picked it up and after a moment flicked it back into the bin it had first come from. Wondering what he should do, Sandy just stood there, thinking dark thoughts about the Roma and what he viewed as an unfair transformation. After a bit, he let his eyes stray down and thinking, &quot;If you shan't sell me another ring, fine,&quot; he reached down and into his purse.<br />
<br />
Extracting a bit of money, Sandy looked down and noted it was a ten-dollar bill. Looking up, noting the Roma woman had her back to him and the few customers were either talking to the Roma or gazing at the jewellery, Sandy set the currency on the counter and than pinned it in place when it started to blow away.<br />
<br />
Another glance at the Roma woman and customers and his hand darting forward, Sandy grabbed a yellow and white ring, thinking the colour scheme looked rather masculine. Quickly turning away, aware that he'd just stolen a ring that was about four dollars, he mentally shrugged as he thought about the ten dollars he had left. Moving quickly back through the crowds, Sandy exited the carnival grounds, declining a hand stamp when the Roma behind the front booth. Finding a quiet spot, Sandy held up the ring and gazed at it, wondering and hoping that it could do what he believed it could do.<br />
<br />
Slipping the ring on his finger, he waited a few moments. When nothing happened, he became first frustrated and than desperate. Taking it off, he tried in on different fingers and when nothing happened, he sat down at simply stared at the ring. After a bit, Sandy looked up and thinking, wondering how it was he'd come to the conclusion that the ring had changed him, he idly slipped the ring back onto his ring finger. Still pondering over the mystery, sure that the ring could do what he believe it could do, Sandy continued to look off into the distance. As he did this, he began to fiddle with the ring, twisting it back and forth for a couple turns before finally twisting a full circle.<br />
<br />
Unaware of what he'd just done, Sandy twisted the ring another complete circle and that a third complete circle. Sliding the ring off his finger, he was thinking, &quot;Cheap piece of...&quot; when he stopped and thought something about his hand looked off. Than a searing pain, like one huge cramp, washed over him and doubling over, Sandy found he was unable to look at anything.<br />
<br />
The sensation growing and growing, it suddenly shifted and Sandy found himself being squeezed downward. Gasping out, he tumbled over onto his side and curled up into a fetal position, dropping the ring to the ground as he did so.<br />
<br />
Wanting to cry out, Sandy found himself unable to form a single noise and instead wished that the pain he was feeling would just go away. And than, quite suddenly, it simply vanished. Forcing his eyes, open, Sandy pushed himself up into a sitting position, remained like that for a couple seconds and than slowly stood and almost few over the moment he gained his feet.<br />
<br />
As his centre of gravity violently shifted, Sandy became aware of several things all at once. The first was that his sense of hearing had suddenly increased. As he ran a hand over his ears, which he noted now came to a point, he than became aware of something brushing against the back of his legs. Glancing behind and down, he gasped out when he saw the bushy yellow foxtail with the white tip extending out of his clothes. It was than that he became aware that his clothes had changed and looking at them, realising that he was no wearing one piece swimsuit with purple and blue flowers printed on it and a pair of board shorts, it came to his attention that he was no longer a full grown woman, but was now a girl of about five years old.<br />
<br />
&quot;There you are!&quot; a voice suddenly exclaimed as Sandy realised that she had somehow turned herself into a little girl. And as the horror of what had just happened, the voice announced, &quot;What have I told you about wandering off,&quot; as suddenly Sandy felt her hand clamped firmly in another.<br />
<br />
Looking up, realising that who he was looking at was his mother, Sandy suddenly realised that they were leaving. Glancing back at the fair, he whined and than said, &quot;I hafta go back.&quot;<br />
<br />
A simple chuckle from his mother and as he pulled Sandy along, she said, &quot;Maybe next year sweetheart,&quot; and as Sandy realised that he'd lost the ring, he desperately tried to pull away, to which his mother simply told her, &quot;Stop that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Upset that she'd just made her life worse and that not only was she a little girl now, but a little girl with a fox tail and partially-formed fox ears, Sandy whimpered out once more, &quot;But I hafta,&quot; and than sinking deep into herself, she wondered what he'd gotten himself into as she found herself dragged along to a car and that she was now stuck, forced to live life as a girl.</p>
