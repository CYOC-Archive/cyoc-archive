<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was almost three in the afternoon when Isaac got back home from his day job. It had thankfully been a slow day at the coffee shop; he’d even had some time to do some of his school reading. It was nearing the end of his college semester, and the load of finals was coming down on him hard. Isaac left his coat and his keys hanging by the door and went to the kitchen of his modest little apartment. He had only a few hours to himself before he had to start getting ready for his second job at the club, and he wanted to get something in his belly.<br />
<br />
Isaac made a sandwich and spent the next hour doing nothing particular at all; what with a full college load and two jobs, Isaac had learned the benefit of taking some time for himself, for his sanity. But he couldn’t sit around forever, and his wristwatch reminded him of that when it sounded off his four o’clock alarm. <br />
<br />
“Snap,” he said, tossing down his phone. “Alright, time to get ready for work,” he chuckled. <br />
<br />
Isaac stood up from the couch and crossed through his bedroom and into his bathroom. He opened up the medicine cabinet and pulled out a large white bottle. He undid the childproof cap and shook the bottle until two large white pills. Isaac had subscribed to them for six months now, ever since the free sample had popped into his mail. Back then, he had been the typical, overburdened college student: full-time, low-paying job, mountains of school work, barely making ends meet. He had been desperate to find another job, but either the hours didn’t work for his schedule or recruiters would tell him “you’re not qualified.” The last one he remembered had been the night club Isaac worked at now. At least, he sort of worked there; they didn’t hire Isaac, but they did hire his older friend, Russel.<br />
<br />
Issac hadn’t known what to expect when he experimented with the pill all those months ago. He certainly didn’t expect what he now accepted as just another part of his get-ready-for-work routine. Isaac’s stomach still fluttered when ever he was about to pop the white pill into his mouth. He poured a glass of water from the faucet and took the pill, chasing it down with the water. The moment it all reached his stomach, Isaac started to feel warm inside. He started to strip of his clothes and went into his closet, passing the dresser that contained his usual clothes and instead going for a smaller plastic dresser. He opened the drawers and pulled out a long pair of wide-waisted jeans, some jockey boxers, and a black, XXL shirt that read “STAFF” in capitalized yellow letters. As he did, Isaac saw the hairs on his arms, usually sparse and almost invisible against his skin, begin to grow darker and thicker. He walked back into his bedroom, arching his back to stretch as he felt his bones start to elongate. The heat in his stomach began to radiate into the muscles of his arms and legs. Isaac smiled as he watched the muscles in his skinny forearms begin to grow large and veiny. His biceps and triceps followed suit and began to expand and cover themselves with coarse hair.<br />
<br />
He moaned and lay back on the bed as the feeling of the change grew stronger. His narrow chest began to bulk up, his ribs disappearing under layers of muscle and fat and hair. He felt his pecs grow meaty and heavy, laughing in a deep, throaty, chuckle as he felt the change center around his nipples to make them larger and more sensitive. His smooth belly grew large and rotund, the muscles underneath his healthy padding becoming firm and powerful. Isaacs legs stretched as his quads became thicker, his ass grew larger and fuller. Isaac couldn’t help himself and enjoy the last of his changes, reaching down to feel his already hard, five-inch dick grow thicker and longer in his hands. His balls ached and churned as they grew as well. An itching sensation came upon him as most of his body filled in with coarse, graying hair; the svelte grew in thick over his chest and belly, his arms, his legs, and on his face, where a handsome day’s-old scruff grew to cover his square, masculine jaw.<br />
<br />
He opened his eyes, feeling thoughts of school work and his life as Isaac slip away into a quiet, sleepy corner of his mind as the other man took over. Russel stretched and groaned in satisfaction, enjoying the pumped-up feeling of his body after the change. He gave his big cock a few welcome back strokes, his other hand tweaking his big, sensitive nipples as his pace increased. Russel arched his back and let out a deep, satisfied growl as he came hard all over his big hairy belly. He released his softening cock and chuckled as he used one of Isaac’s shirts to clean off the mess. Russel dressed himself in the clothes that Isaac had so thoughtfully laid out for him, admiring the way the black cotton stretched around his big arms and emphasized his round shoulders. He put on his jeans and found his steel toes, pausing on his way out of the bedroom to adjust himself. I gotta shop for my own jeans, Russel thought to himself, the kid buys em too tight in the crotch. Russel quickly laced up his boots, collected his wallet and keys and strode out the door, stopping to grab his burner phone from a box by the door before locking it behind him. He frowned and shook his head at the sight of Isaacs beat-up sedan, wishing the kid drove a truck or something, but he was looking forward to the night ahead. Russell made great tips working as a bouncer for the club in addition to a decent hourly rate, and there was never a dull moment. As the sun set, he found himself wishing he could spend time out and about during the day like Isaac did; working nights was fun and all, but Isaac didn’t take the pill on his days off, which meant Russel never got a day off at all. As he drove to work, he began to wonder if there was a way to make the effects of the DILF pill last longer, perhaps even become permanent…</p>
