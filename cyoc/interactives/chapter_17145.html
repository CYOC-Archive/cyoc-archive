<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff peered own into the folder and his eyes went wide with terror seeing the piece of property he was to become for the company.<br />
<br />
&quot;Its a Bull!&quot; said Jeff slowly as the thought ran through his brain.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh much more than a common bull, your to be a Charolais Bull! This breed is very special and once as a bull you will be assigned to one of our associate farms as the prime sire of a growing herd. I must admit that the Professor has quite the time with those free spirited men who come here and give their very selves to the higher ideas of science.&quot; told the Nurse to Jeff.<br />
<br />
Jeff was still thinking this as some very wild hoax but he changed his mind when the sensation came. Peering down as best he could there came this sensation from his groin. The nurse took note of his wonderments and stepped over to the man who she supposed was a willing specimen.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your growing from the injection!&quot; she said as the Nurse reached down and lifted into Jeff's view his balls sac.<br />
<br />
Two deep reddish skinned balls the size of two lemons tucked together in a lightly furry sac suspended from his groin by a thickened stretch of skin. She traced her other hand from the huge testicles upward along the very sensual furry hide to his groin where she giggled some other loose skin.<br />
<br />
As if tracing his extended maleness her hand moved upward along Jeff's rounded plump belly. She moved both of her warm hands to either side the limp skin and made him feel the most sensual sensation.<br />
<br />
About to his belly button her hands stopped and squeezed the limp folds of furry covered skin. Jeff's eyes went wide as his thoughts of what he'd been feeling realized something which was never his before, but was now his to be sure.<br />
<br />
From just below the crest of his round belly came this pointed knob attached to a wrinkled red shaft. The more he fantisized about what he'd been told and what he saw and felt the longer and stiffer this thing became.<br />
<br />
After just a few minutes the red shaft was almost to his chin as Jeff began to realize what he'd been told was indeed going to become true.<br />
<br />
A sensation of sexual urges mixed with his panic to bring shooting forth long streams of white thin juices and what had to be sperm from his enlarged balls.<br />
<br />
&quot;You are really getting into the grove on this, aren't you!&quot; said the Nurse as if to offer her personal feelings for Jeff's liking his new self.<br />
<br />
It was at that moment the doors burst open and Professor Beaker and two guards stormed in with the guard who spoke to Jeff not a half hour ago.  <br />
<br />
&quot;I am not happy with what I'm seeing here Nurse!&quot; exclaimed the Professor.<br />
<br />
The Nurse looked at her angered boss and then to the security guard who had informed Jeff of his coming demise.<br />
<br />
&quot;He likes the idea, Sir!&quot; said the Nurse as she pointed back toward Jeff.<br />
<br />
The Professor walked over and slowly picked up the folder having information and the photo of the final form to make Jeff his future self.<br />
<br />
Showing the photo of a monster sized Charolais bull to Jeff the Professor asked, &quot;You really find this to be something you'd willingly be made into?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff was always quick on his mental toes and figured if he did not wish the Professor to think he was willing he'd most likely be made into some ignorant beast anyway.<br />
<br />
&quot;Look's authorized to me, besides as your add mentioned I'd have everything I need and work would be rather easy. I never saw a Charolais breed before but it looks to be a hardy type and not some boney sack of skin.&quot; said Jeff as if he was honored by this entire situation.<br />
<br />
&quot;Take him over there!&quot; demanded the Professor to the guards holding the arms of a struggling security guard.<br />
<br />
As they strapped the guard down to a steel exam table the man was begging for to be set free. Professor Beaker looked at the man but said not a word to him. He walked over to his lab trays and after a few moments of quiet conversation with the head Nurse he began to fill a syringe.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm pleased but surprised about your accepting so quickly and of such ease my plan to remake you into a Charolais Bull. You soft physical form would easily remolded into the bullish body structure, as well then if you accept the life of such, I'll let you remember your true self. There have been a few to this point which from their sexual desires found bestial life a new way of personal enjoyment. I will if you continue to cooperate well your entire human mind, memory, and learned knowledge will remain intact, this all for you to understand and find delight in being as a Bull.&quot; said the Professor.<br />
<br />
Jeff remained quiet as he turned his thickening head to watch just what the Professor was planning to do to the young security guard.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, please no I was only thinking of the guy and making him happy to be as what you had in store for him.&quot; begged the man now strapped and helpless.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't believe a word of it! You have taunted my subjests before and made trouble when they revolted against my planned transitions. Now I've had enough of your unruly manner, its time you contributed to the bottom line! I have now a plan for you to work with our fine friend over there as he will be a Charolais bull when completed, you will be for him a Nympomania minded Heifer of the Charolais breed. As with the phobia of  the Nymphomanic female mind your every waking hour will be to feel your pussy filled with the shaft of some male, or that bull over there!&quot; stated the Professor as he plunged the syringe into the man's neck.<br />
<br />
A chuckling laugh from the Professor as he thought of the man becoming first of female gender, then becoming a phobia of some Nymph sexual pattern, and finally slipping into the animal form of a sexy cow. A pat on his forehead and another laugh. <br />
<br />
&quot;I think we'll leave you your horns as a reminder of just how much you will become a true cow!&quot; said the Professor as he turned to leave and let the poor man scream out his fears.</p>
