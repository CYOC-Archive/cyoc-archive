<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jenny made her way down the block.  She had to be careful, at this time of day, a girl her <br />
age was supposed to be at school...and there was always the off chance someone might <br />
recognize her; she'd lived on this block most of her life.<br />
<br />
Not that she expected it, Jennifer Smith was 17, not 9. It wasn't long before she reached <br />
Kyle's home.  His family wasn't as wealthy as her dad, but they made do.  They had a nice <br />
place.  <br />
<br />
No one was home, so Jennifer hid near the front steps, behind some bushes.   And waited.<br />
<br />
---------<br />
<br />
Kyle had been excited all day, especially when Jennifer didn't come to school.  Was she <br />
really transformed?  He couldn't wait to find out.  He figured he'd call her first, let her beg <br />
him to change her back.  He had to play it cool though, she had the power at the moment.  <br />
<br />
He hadn't believed it either, until he chose Dare.  Bastards, forcing him to run naked <br />
through the girl's locker room.  He hadn't gotten caught, but the way everyone looked at <br />
him after...like they all -knew-.  And especially Jennifer.<br />
<br />
But he was going to get revenge on all of them.  <br />
<br />
As he walked up the stairs, he was suprised to feel a hard, cold object in the small of his <br />
back.  And heard a young girl's voice from behind him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello, Kyle.  Don't move...this is a .45 caliber pistol.  It's more than capable of putting a <br />
hole right through your abdomen.  Tell me you understand.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kyle felt all the bravado drain out of him.  He gulped.  &quot;Uh...Jenny?  Hi, um...look, I'm <br />
sorry...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Shut the fuck up, Kyle.  Nobody's home, so open the door.  We're going to talk in your <br />
room.  One wrong move, and you'll be on the ground, choking on your own blood.  DO <br />
YOU UNDERSTAND?!&quot;<br />
<br />
In his mind, he tried to tell himself she was just a kid.  He could overpower her easily.  But <br />
there was something in her voice...something dangerous.  He realized, with cold certainty, <br />
that this wasn't the Jennifer Smith he knew.<br />
<br />
He opened the door and slowly led her in.  &quot;My room is in the basement.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then let's go.  The basement door can be locked from inside?&quot;<br />
<br />
He nodded.  &quot;Uh..yes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Move it.&quot;<br />
<br />
He unlocked the basement door and slowly walked down the stairs.  He heard the door <br />
close behind him, and the deadbolt turn.<br />
<br />
The gun wasn't trained on him, this was the time to act.  He half turned..<br />
<br />
Only to see Jenny smiling cutely at him.  She already had both hands on the gun, and she <br />
pressed it into his side.  She was wearing faded jeans and a light blue blouse.  Her hair <br />
had paled several shades.  She looked just how she did when she was younger....but her <br />
eyes...<br />
<br />
Jennifer Smith had green eyes.  The girl who was pointing a gun at him had icy blue eyes.<br />
<br />
He shivered and walked down the stairs, turning on the light.<br />
<br />
&quot;Over there, the couch.  We're going to sit down and talk.&quot;  He didn't dare disobey, he sat <br />
down, watching her warily.<br />
<br />
Jenny hopped onto the couch, drawing her legs up beside her, and braced herself against <br />
the cushions.  She set the gun down, but it was still far too close to her hand...<br />
<br />
&quot;It was getting heavy.  You didn't leave me with much strength.&quot;<br />
<br />
He bit his lip.  &quot;uh...yeah..sorry..&quot;<br />
<br />
She glared at him.  There was a wildness in her eyes.  It promised....violence.<br />
<br />
&quot;Transform or Dare.  Well who would have thought it was real.  That's how you did this, <br />
right?&quot;<br />
<br />
He nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;So someone did something to you....what?&quot;<br />
<br />
He told her everything.<br />
<br />
&quot;Moron.  Jennifer didn't have a clue about that.  I realize she treated you like dirt, Kyle, but <br />
you picked the wrong target.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait...who are you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm Jenny.  Jenny Smith.&quot;<br />
<br />
He blinked.  &quot;I don't understand.&quot;<br />
<br />
She sighed, and ran her fingers through her short hair.  &quot;You do remember that my mother <br />
was killed, don't you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh...oh yeah...I didn't find out until later, my folks said it was an accident.&quot;<br />
<br />
With reflexes that would put a mongoose to shame, the gun was in her hands, and aimed <br />
at his head.  &quot;IT WAS NOT A FUCKING ACCIDENT!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
Kyle had never been so frightened in his life.  &quot;Please don't kill me...I'm sorry!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmph...waste of ammo.&quot;  She put the gun down again.  &quot;It wasn't an accident.  She was <br />
murdered.  Some loser wanted to rape her.  She fought, he shot her.  Then he came for <br />
me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kyle's eyes widened.  &quot;You were there?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yes, yes I was.  He took my clothes off, and he was going to rape me too, but I got <br />
lucky and someone stopped him.  I was gone for awhile, remember?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah...and when you came back...I tried to talk to you, but you...&quot;<br />
<br />
She shook her head.  &quot;That wasn't me, Kyle.  That was Jennifer.  The real Jenny, she <br />
couldn't handle it, so she made us both up, you see.  Jennifer to deal with the real world, <br />
and me....to handle things.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, you mean....like multiple personalities?&quot;<br />
<br />
She smiled at him.  For just a moment, she looked very cute.  But then it was gone, and <br />
Jenny was back.  &quot;You always were a smart boy.  Yes.  Nobody even noticed, Jennifer had <br />
the whole world fooled.  Not bad for a stupid bitch, huh?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You hate her.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course I do.  She got to be in charge, growing up, wearing nice clothes, going out with <br />
boys, and treating people like shit....and look at me!  This is what I am!  Jennifer couldn't <br />
even handle the truth, she didn't even fucking remember what happened to us!&quot;  Jenny <br />
looked violent, and her hand was on the gun once more.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you going to kill me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I should.  I really should.  But I'm not.&quot;  She took her hand off the gun.<br />
<br />
&quot;In a way, I'm grateful.&quot;  She sighed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh?  I don't...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You let me out, by doing this.  I'm only able to come out when Jennifer runs into <br />
something she can't handle.  Being turned into a kid, that's high on the list.  I was going to <br />
make you turn us back...but then she'd be in control, and I don't want that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;...look.  I've been an asshole.  All I could think about was my own petty shit.  I didn't think <br />
about your feelings, ever.  I know saying 'sorry' doesn't fix a damn thing...so....how can I <br />
help you?&quot;  Kyle wasn't afraid anymore.  He'd done something terrible.  He'd been this <br />
girl's friend once, and he stopped, because of his own pride.  She'd been hurting inside, <br />
but he'd never once cared about it.  She might still kill him, but that didn't matter now.<br />
<br />
Jenny tilted her head to the side, appraising Kyle.  &quot;Jennifer misjudged you.  You are a <br />
decent guy, when you put some effort into it.  Better than that jerk she's been dating <br />
lately.&quot;  She made a face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, you mean Brad?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Bleah.  Don't say his name, please.  Just making out with that jerk was enough, but she <br />
had to have sex with him?  I feel so dirty.&quot;  Jenny shifted uneasily.<br />
<br />
&quot;I should have gone after him.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jenny shrugged.  &quot;Eh.  Don't worry, I'll attend to him.  You did the right thing, Kyle, for the <br />
wrong reasons.  I'm out now, and I'm here to stay.  You want to help me?&quot;<br />
<br />
He nodded.  &quot;Yes...I owe it to you.&quot;<br />
<br />
She smiled at him again.  &quot;Good.  Now, this stupid Transform or Dare thing...I can use it <br />
on someone, and then they get the power to use it, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, but you can't just trade back.  You have to use it on someone other than the person <br />
who used it on you.  I guess that's to prevent people from abusing the power.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'd like to know who thought this up....it could still be abused, in theory...&quot;  She seemed <br />
thoughtful.<br />
<br />
&quot;I thought so, but who could you trust?  Power corrupts.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah...it does.  You'd have a hard time resisting the urge to do whatever you <br />
wanted...heck, it's magic, it can probably even make it harder to resist.  Tell me, what <br />
happens if you use it, and the victim never has a chance to curse someone else?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm not sure...it must have happened before though, I mean, as urban legends go, it's <br />
been in this town for a long time.&quot;<br />
<br />
She nodded, as if to herself.  &quot;I was thinking to use it on Victor...but maybe it would be <br />
better to just kill him.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Victor?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Victor Hughes, he's the punk that killed my mother.  Now that I'm out, I'm going to...we're <br />
going to kill him.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We?&quot;  Kyle paled.<br />
<br />
&quot;You did say you wanted to help me, right?&quot;  She smiled sweetly at him.<br />
<br />
Kyle realized he was doomed.  &quot;So...what do we do first?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I'll let you decide...I should get offload this curse soon, it's a distraction I don't need.  <br />
Who should we use it on?&quot;</p>
