<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mardi Gras was a particularly active night for many, considering this festival encouraged people to let loose their inhibitions and get all the debauchery out of their systems before Lent started. Most Animalians were incapable of doing the kind of fasting that Lent requires because of their specific diets. Still, they were quite willing to take any opportunity to celebrate. Though there were still some that were trying to keep to the original reason for this release of sin.<br />
<br />
Anton, being a devout Catholic, was explaining to Marlysa the importance of Lent. &quot;So, forty days you have to not eat meat until Passover?&quot; asked Marlysa.<br />
<br />
Anton gave an amused chuckle at that. Teaching an uplifted animal about religion was challenging at times since animals didn&#39;t have much of a concept for religion. &quot;First off, you only have to abstain from eating meat on Fridays, but fish is acceptable,&quot; said Anton.<br />
<br />
&quot;But isn&#39;t fish a type of meat?&quot; asked Marlysa.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, yes, but back in medieval times, fishes were considerably a completely different class from other animals. Also, the Pope allowed people to eat fish to ease the burden some,&quot; said Anton, &quot;Also, it&#39;s not Passover, that&#39;s the Jewish Holiday. You&#39;re supposed to hold back until Easter.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I thought Passover was a part of Lent,&quot; said Marlysa.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not precisely,&quot; said Anton, &quot;It&#39;s part of the origin of Easter, but it&#39;s not something Christians directly observe. We call it Good Friday instead.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh,&quot; said Marlysa, &quot;But I counted the days between now and Easter. That&#39;s more than 40.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s 40 if you don&#39;t count the Sundays,&quot; said Anton, &quot;People are expected to still maintain their vigilance on Sundays, but technically you&#39;re allowed to indulge.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Vigilance?&quot; asked Marlysa.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, nowadays, people are supposed to give up a certain thing during Lent,&quot; explained Anton, &quot;Most people give up a favorite food, some people make a vow to do more charity work, some people abstain from having sex...&quot;<br />
<br />
Marlysa interrupted with an almost stern tone, &quot;Don&#39;t you even think of considering that one.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;m not,&quot; said Anton.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good, because I could definitely use some right now,&quot; said Marlysa as she started removing her top.<br />
<br />
&quot;So soon?&quot; asked Anton, &quot;Are we going to do more partying right now?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you really going to argue with these?&quot; asked Marlysa as she let her large breasts out into the open.<br />
<br />
Anton considered it for half a moment before saying, &quot;I can&#39;t argue with my lovely wife.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s what I thought,&quot; said Marlysa before pulling in Anton for a long kiss.<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
Just as Mardi Gras was a time for couples to celebrate their sexual relationship, it was also a time for newer couples to indulge in previously-untouched waters. Such was the case with Mike and Mary. Even after having that discussion with Eugene and his new mate on Valentine&#39;s Day, Mike still was too nervous to think about going further with Mary. While he still found her attractive, he was too inexperienced to be able to work up the nerve to go forward. But Mary will soon help him to overcome that hesitation.<br />
<br />
Mike was heading back to his room to get ready to go out. He was planning on going out to dinner with Mary. He was pretty eager to try out some of the Creole-style crayfish they were cooking for Mardi Gras. But as he got to his room, he started picking up a scent, a scent that was very enticing and alluring. And it was definitely coming from his room. Mike considered the scent for a moment before he opened his door.<br />
<br />
What he saw was something he was definitely not expecting to see. Mary was waiting for him on his bed, wearing a very lacy piece of lingerie that showed off the curves of her body very well. &quot;Hello, Michael. I&#39;ve been waiting for you,&quot; said Mary in a sultry tone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mary...you look...&quot; stammered Mike.<br />
<br />
&quot;You like it? I got it from Miss Vivian&#39;s Intimacy Boutique,&quot; said Mary, rubbing a hand up and down one side, &quot;I got this perfume there as well. They were having a sale today.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, great, so...what&#39;s this about?&quot; asked Mike.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know exactly what this is about,&quot; said Mary, getting off the bed and walking towards Mike, swaying her hips, &quot;You know you&#39;re attracted to me and I&#39;m attracted to you. We&#39;re the proper physical age and we shouldn&#39;t be holding back our longing for each other. Tonight, you and I are going to be taking it to the final level.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But...my parents...&quot; said Mike with hesitation. He was having trouble controlling his desire. Mary&#39;s sexy body and that enticing aroma was turning him on, as could be seen by the bulge in his pants.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your parents said to wait until you knew a girl more closely before going that far,&quot; said Mary, gently stroking the side of Mike&#39;s face, &quot;I&#39;d say that we&#39;ve gotten pretty close over the last few months, haven&#39;t we?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But...but...&quot; said Mike weakly, barely able to hold back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mike, we didn&#39;t go all the way on Valentine&#39;s Day, I&#39;m not going to miss out on Mardi Gras. We deserve better than this. Let me show you why,&quot; said Mary before leaning in and kissing Mike. At that point, all resistance dissolved. Mike started kissing her back eagerly. He couldn&#39;t ignore his desire any longer. He needed Mary, more than anything he ever felt in his life.<br />
<br />
Mary rubbed up against Mike and soon felt the throbbing bulge in his pants. &quot;Ooh, looks like someone needs to be let out,&quot; said Mary. Before Mike could object, Mary knelt down and undid the zipper of his pants. It didn&#39;t take much work to make his cock spring out. It was a very healthy length, being about 10 inches, which was not uncommon for Animalians. &quot;Oh, you&#39;ve been holding out on me,&quot; crooned Mary as she stroked his length. Mike whined a bit, trying hard to hold back. &quot;Oh, still too shy? I know how to fix that,&quot; said Mary. Mike gave a yelp of surprise as Mary&#39;s mouth suddenly encompassed the upper half of his cock. Before long, he was moaning with pleasure as Mary massaged his shaft with her tongue. Her hand was feeling his large balls, stroking and massaging them.<br />
<br />
It wasn&#39;t taking too much effort for Mike&#39;s pleasure to peak. &quot;Mary...I&#39;m about to...I&#39;m gonna...&quot; gasped Mike before the dam burst. Mary was a bit surprised by the splash of semen in her mouth, but she kept herself from gagging and pulled back. Mike panted as he started calming down. &quot;Where did you learn to do that?&quot; he asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I read it in the Kama Sutra book they had at the boutique,&quot; said Mary, &quot;I hope you don&#39;t want to stop. Male Animalians can go for multiple rounds.&quot; She pulled the straps of her lingerie, allowing more of her breasts to be seen, &quot;You do want to keep going, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
Mike&#39;s cock quickly sprung back up to attention. &quot;Oh, definitely,&quot; he said, &quot;But what about the crayfish?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I already bought some. They&#39;re in the fridge,&quot; said Mary as she started shimmying out of her lingerie.<br />
<br />
With no reason to hold back, Mike started taking off his own clothes. Mary was very pleased with his body too. His strong muscles were clearly seen under his plush fur. As soon as they had stripped, the two otters crawled onto the bed and started kissing more. Then Mike crawled up on top and got ready to plunge. After making sure he was lined up, he lowered down, going deep into Mary. Mary moaned with pleasure as Mike stretched out her tunnel. Soon, the two of them were bouncing and moaning to a strong rhythm. The spirit of Mardi Gras was with them and they were going to get all their pleasure done tonight.</p>
