<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;So... what is this about a Succubus Club?&quot; I asked as Lara stood next to me in the conference room. We had gone back to the seminar and endured an additional three hours of courses. Aubrey had taken a seat next to me while Su and Sophia sat behind us. The former had taken the liberty of copping feels the whole class. Now that the seminar was out for the day we all stood in a conference room waiting to be introduced to our Resident Assistants. <br />
<br />
&quot;As I told them, by the end of this year every woman on this campus is going to want a taste of your dick. I figured it&#39;s best to try and form a club of members with preferential treatment,&quot; Lara explained.<br />
<br />
&quot;So... I&#39;m your whore,&quot; I grumbled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, please, you&#39;re not a whore,&quot; Lara scoffed. &quot;I&#39;m just building you a harem.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A harem?&quot; I asked, giving her a sideways glare.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure. A collection of prime women who will spread their legs at your request. I figure the best way to do that is make a club. Aubrey, Su, and Sophia are the first members.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re planning on more?&quot; I asked feeling a little nervous. <br />
<br />
&quot;Today it&#39;s three, tomorrow six, and the day after that, twelve,&quot; she smiled.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t think I have enough energy to keep that busy,&quot; I chuckled.<br />
<br />
She gave me a sideways look of aggitation and disbelief. &quot;Please, Jethro, I&#39;m a Succubus. I could make you into a mindless breeding machine who&#39;s hard 24/7. All it would take is a few sessions of glorious sex and a few days of magic.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You... you wouldn&#39;t do that would you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course not, I love you too much. Still, once my magic is done every woman in this University will want you. I just need to make sure you fuck the best.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What does that mean?&quot; I asked, feeling a bit frustrated from how cryptic she was. <br />
<br />
&quot;Sexual energy, like all other types of energy can be good or bad depending on source and quality. Take a look at those two girls over there,&quot; she pointed. I looked to see two freshman chatting with each other in the corner. They were both about the same height but one was thin and the other a bit chubby. &quot;What&#39;s the difference between them?&quot; she asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Their weight,&quot; I grumbled, not really wanting to answer that.<br />
<br />
&quot;Besides that,&quot; Lara rolled her eyes. I turned and shrugged. &quot;Here, borrow my eyes,&quot; she huffed, touching my temple with her index finger. My vision went fuzzy then refocused feeling more acute. I looked again and could see the girls in greater detail. &quot;Look at the one on the left.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; I acknowledged.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s start from the top down. Her hair is natural, straight, and unstyled. She lets it grow long and uses conditioner but by and large leaves it alone. Her ears are pierced with studs and on her neck is a simple heart-shaped locket likely containing a picture of her family.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why not a boyfriend?&quot; I interjected. <br />
<br />
&quot;Aha, look how she&#39;s dressed. A plain shirt, and jeans. Definitely not dating anyone or she would likely be showing off some skin. Most likely she received the locket as a graduation gift. Then there&#39;s her purse. Why do women carry purses?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;To carry things?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not just things, lots of things. Purses carry money, ID, cigarrettes, lighters, makeup, tampons, and birth control. Now, she&#39;s not wearing any makeup aside from a hint of foundation and blush, so her supply of makeup can&#39;t be that much. Tampons and birth control make sense as she likely is hoping for some action here at college. If she were only carrying money she would have a wallet, not a purse.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You think she&#39;s a virgin?&quot; I asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, not by how she&#39;s carrying herself. Chances are she&#39;s had experience but is conservative about who she sleeps with and how often. Now on to her nails. They are well kept and manicured so she takes care of herself. Add that to the fact that her jeans accentuate her ass but aren&#39;t too tight so as to make her look like a slut, and then the final note: three inch heels that once again draw attention to her butt without making her look like a slut.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, so...?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;She embraces her femininity. Sexual energy from her is an easy six or seven. With a little magic I can improve her to a solid nine or ten, easy. Now look at the other girl. Once again from the top down: her hair is styled in a high and tight with green highlights, her weight is unfortunate, she&#39;s sporting black lipstick, a septum piercing, and her nails are thoroughly chewed. Her hoodie and sweatpants are a blantant message of not caring and she is doing everything possible to appear... man-ish. She&#39;s disavowed her femininity, her sexual energy is toxic. I wouldn&#39;t fuck her if I could mount your dick on a remote machine with a range of 500 meters.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Damn, that&#39;s harsh,&quot; I muttered. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ugh, I can&#39;t stand women like her. The world works best when men embrace their masculinity and women their femininity, especially when it comes to sexual energy. Derrick had quality sexual energy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But he was a cheater,&quot; I protested.<br />
<br />
&quot;True, and I hate cheaters, but at least he followed his instinct: to fuck whatever woman wanted him. That alone made him a quality source. Still, by the end of the year, even the girl on the right will want you but she won&#39;t get you. The club will make sure of that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If you&#39;re going to make a club you should probably reconsider the name,&quot; I suggested.<br />
<br />
&quot;True, I suppose Succubus Club is too aggressive. I keep forgetting you humans think that we&#39;re demonesses. Perhaps something else more... feminine.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How about the Venus Club,&quot; I suggested. Venus was always seen as the perfect woman and the goddess of love. Surely it would befit a harem headed up by a sex fairy.<br />
<br />
Lara grinned. &quot;Oh, that&#39;s good. I like the way you think,&quot; she cooed, gripping my ass and pressing the underside of my scrotum with her middle finger. <br />
<br />
&quot;Alright everyone it&#39;s time to meet your RAs,&quot; the Director of Student Life announced over the roar of the fifty odd students gathered there. &quot;You&#39;ll notice that there are several stations in this room, each correlating to a Hall and Floor Number. Go to your appropriate station and you&#39;ll meet your RAs and ARAs. Enjoy!&quot; <br />
<br />
With that said the group began to break up and move around. Lara and I found a sigh raised high above the crowd that read &quot;LOVE 3rd.&quot; Fighting the ocean of moving freshmen we made our way to the table beneath. The sight of who sat at the table made me freeze. <br />
<br />
&quot;No fucking way,&quot; I hissed. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, this is too perfect,&quot; Lara grinned. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, you can&#39;t be serious,&quot; Charity turned and gawked at Lara and I much in the same way I had to be staring at her. Her eyes were side open and jaw slack. She looked slightly different. I noticed that she had cut her hair. No longer did it hang all the way to her ass but was now featuring a bob cut. I had to admit, I was never a fan of short hair, but with her small framed face it looked really cute. <br />
<br />
&quot;Charity!&quot; Lara called, breaking the tense silence and moving to give Charity a hug. Charity accepted awkwardly and even reciprocated taking care not to spare more faux affection than she had to. &quot;I can&#39;t believe it we&#39;re on the third floor together! Oh, this is fantastic! Jethro can you believe this?&quot; <br />
<br />
No I couldn&#39;t, nor could I believe how well Lara pulled off the ditzy blonde act when it suited her needs. &quot;Yeah, fantastic is... yeah...&quot; Charity sighed, patting Lara on the shoulders to try and deter the embrace from lingering too long. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, my gosh, you&#39;re our RA!&quot; Lara squeeled. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, it uh- looks that way,&quot; the other admitted hesitantly. <br />
<br />
&quot;You cut your hair,&quot; I blurted out, trying to chase the awkward atmosphere and failing completely. <br />
<br />
&quot;Um, yeah, yeah I figured I needed a change since... well since last night,&quot; she muttered, running her hand behind her head and teasing it. <br />
<br />
&quot;Charity! Hi!&quot; came another squeely feminine voice. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, shit, why me?&quot; Charity moaned, looking at the floor. A giddy girl of Lara&#39;s height came racing out of the crowd and embracing Charity with more enthusiasm than Lara had. She was a blonde, her hair laying just past her shoulders, her body incredibly thin and fit with small perky breasts and an ass that showed a high emphasis on leg days.  &quot;Hey, Amelia,&quot; Charity greeted half-heartedly, her arms imprisoned by her sides. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh! Charity, what&#39;s with the cold shoulder?&quot; Amelia pouted. &quot;I mean I&#39;m your ARA this year! Isn&#39;t it great?&quot; she shouted enthusiastically while sipping a cup of coffee. &quot;Oh, my gosh can you believe this? I know they told me to show up yesterday but then I found out that we weren&#39;t going to be visiting our floormates till today so I was like: why don&#39;t I just arrive the day of and get my room all sorted in the morning? So that&#39;s what I did.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course you did,&quot; Charity huffed. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ooh, what&#39;s this? Making new freshmen friends already?&quot; Amelia smiled looking at Lara and myself. <br />
<br />
&quot;Lara,&quot; the succubus introduced herself with a handshake. I did likewise, Amelia winking at me as our hands parted. <br />
<br />
&quot;And I&#39;m Amelia, your Assistant Resident Assistant. It&#39;s wonderful to meet you both. Lara, you&#39;re a very pretty girl, have you considered trying out for the cheerleading squad?&quot; It was then that I actually realized Amelia was wearing a cheerleader&#39;s outfit. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, no, you&#39;re not going to do this here,&quot; Charity scolded. <br />
<br />
&quot;Look, Charity, I&#39;m sorry for what happened with you but you must know I tried.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You said I was perfect for it, and then I got kicked a year later.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why&#39;s that?&quot; Lara asked, cocking an eyebrow. <br />
<br />
&quot;Politics, mainly,&quot; Charity noted, glaring at Amelia. <br />
<br />
&quot;Charity, I tried, okay. I stood by you, put my reputation on the line, and at the end of the day I was outvoted. No one was willing to stand against Dahlia so out you went. Still, you have to admit, cheeleading just wasn&#39;t for you. This is more your style: brains, organizational skills, crisis management, you&#39;re all those things!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I suppose you&#39;re right,&quot; Charity huffed. &quot;I am a lot happier now that I don&#39;t have to deal with those bitches anymore.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So, Laaaaara, what do you say? Wanna try it? I mean, you are a Freshman so the chances of you making the team are slim but it does happen, so you might as well try out. Whaddya say?&quot; Amelia pressed. <br />
<br />
&quot;I say why not?&quot; Lara smiled, Charity rolling her eyes in disagreement. <br />
<br />
&quot;Great, wonderful. Now, I just need to ask you a question, it&#39;s a bit personal, don&#39;t get mad, but... how flexible are you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Unparalleled,&quot; Lara grinned. I remembered the feats she was able to pull the night before. She wasn&#39;t wrong.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oooh, confident. I think you&#39;ll fit in just fine.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you really planning to join the squad,&quot; I asked as we backed away from the table. <br />
<br />
&quot;Of course. Imagine how much influence I would have there. The cheerleading team, the sports teams, the coaches, teachers, it would be a lynch pin.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You sound like you&#39;re trying to take over the world,&quot; I chuckled. <br />
<br />
&quot;Wow, it took you a long time to figure that out,&quot; she smirked. I stopped and stared at her for a moment, concerned that my &#39;wife&#39; was really more a monster than she seemed. &quot;Gotcha,&quot; she winked. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hello everyone, I&#39;m Charity-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And I&#39;m Amelia.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And we&#39;re going to be your RAs this year. Which means we are the ones to come to if you have any questions or issues regarding the dorms. Now, keep in mind that you can switch rooms if you want to, like I know some friends want to room together, but if you&#39;re going to do that it should be before the school year starts because dorm rooms go quick. I&#39;m in room 301, Amelia&#39;s in room 319, as you probably noticed we&#39;re at opposite ends of the hall so if you don&#39;t feel comfortable coming to one of us you can go to the other and we&#39;ll share pertinent information-&quot; Charity went on in a very diplomatic manner, Amelia showing signs of boredom.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well thank you for the PSA,&quot; Amelia interrupted. &quot;Listen, while it&#39;s true we&#39;re here for help and support we&#39;re also here to organize events for all of you on our floor. Times to bond, party, and just relax with a bunch of like minded people. If anyone has suggestions I&#39;d love to hear them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright,&quot; called the Director from before. &quot;Listen up if you want to switch rooms, go to the floor you want to switch to now.&quot; With that announcement almost every girl in the room moved over to our table, the crowd seeming to triple in size. <br />
<br />
&quot;Holy shit, um... okay,&quot; Charity blinked. <br />
<br />
A girl stood next to me, teasing her hair with her hand while chewing noisily on gum. She looked at me and flashed her flirtiest smile she could. I smiled awkwardly back, Lara flashing her a death glare to which the girl simply giggled nervously before vanishing into the crowd. &quot;Is this your doing?&quot; I asked Lara, trying to remain as quiet as possible. <br />
<br />
&quot;I may have boosted your pheremones significantly,&quot; she answered, looking a little embarrassed. &quot;I guess I overdid it. Even the blob is being affected.&quot; I looked over to where Lara stared and sure enough the chubby girl from earlier was trying her best to look attractive, her whole outlook failing her immensely. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well you gotta fix this!&quot; I hissed, noticing that the Director was looking at me, likely considering moving me to another floor considering Love 3 had become inundated with women. <br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t I know it. There&#39;s bound to be hotter girls yet to arrive on campus. Can&#39;t have them going to other floors.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s not what I-&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Look, just do me a favor and scan the crowd. Don&#39;t stop until I tell you.&quot; I did as she said, noticing that some women I looked at became slightly disoriented before finding their way out of the crowd and heading to another floor or even another hall. After a while the group had been cut down to about half its original size. <br />
<br />
&quot;Do I dare ask what you just did?&quot; I asked nervously. <br />
<br />
&quot;Just a little bit of magic. Everyone you considered unattractive I influenced to want a different floor. This way only the attractive girls stayed.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You need to stop using magic so recklessly,&quot; I scowled. <br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t I know it! I feel tired. You&#39;re going to have to replenish me after this.&quot;<br />
<br />
The Director finalized the proceedings, having us all sign documents finalizing our rooms and proceeding to move our belongings as needed. We were then dismissed for the day, being reminded to attend dinner at the appropriate time. That&#39;s when Su came up to me, looking awkward and shy but also extremely cute. &quot;Excuse me, Jethro, but, I was wondering... I mean, I&#39;m in Devint Hall but want to move to Love Hall. Could you... help me? If it&#39;s not too much trouble,&quot; she grinned sheepishly. <br />
<br />
Lara looked at me and smiled. &quot;You can go if you want. I&#39;m going to be in my room laying down until you swing by.&quot;</p>
