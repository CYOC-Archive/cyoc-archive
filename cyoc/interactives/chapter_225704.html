<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The story that we are about to unfold, is a Christmas story, but not one that we think about often. Of course, we&#39;ll see some long-familiar faces to be sure, but their situations could be what you&#39;d heard of before, or never at all... So let&#39;s begin with this;<br />
<br />
[A Transformative Christmas Lesson]<br />
<br />
<br />
Up in the North Pole where nothing drastic happens... At least not typically.<br />
<br />
In a peculiar red building just there in the winter grounds. Inside is where his workshop is at... &#39;His&#39; as in, the big red... That jolly fella in a red suit, red pants, with a black belt, black boots, and a pointy red hat with a white pom-pom at the end. A very obese man with a massive belly and, somewhat also have muscles hidden inside his fatty arms, and legs to be able to carry his own weight. He looks like he could be in his 40s or 50s, despite that he&#39;s older then he looks. He&#39;s pale skin, a round face with cute rosey chubby cheeks with a white bushy mustache, bushy beard, and white hair. Who looks old enough to remember how he began being who he is. And yet, still agile that you could mistaken him for being in his 30&#39;s. But he&#39;s not of course... He is none other than...<br />
<br />
Santa Claus.<br />
<br />
Santa walked on, and on, making sure there is little to no complication in his workspace. He already looked at the list, and he has yet to check it twice. So he went to the library, with so many books that contains information about the magic of this place, the real origin story... Everything you&#39;d expect to see in a library. At the center of this room he looks upon the snow globe, it&#39;s bigger than a bowling ball, and clear enough to pass for a fortune teller&#39;s crystal ball. If need be, he can make the globe bigger, but that&#39;s not necessary, he held it up close to his face. As he does he gets the view of the downtown at a random place. Happy to see that there is still the Christmas spirit in everyone this year.<br />
<br />
And while he was enjoying the view of everyone working, and having a good time. Santa sees something that gives him a happy feeling. A Black Santa decorative statue. Despite that it looks nothing like the real Santa. The real Santa himself is not offended at all. In fact seeing this reminded him of a friend of his. That he had in the past...<br />
<br />
Now, Santa Claus is just one man, he cannot make deliveries on his own. Dispite him being called &#39;Prime Santa&#39; (The very first one of his kind). Going around the world in one night is too much for one Santa, no matter how much magic he has. So he had his elves scout for assistances to be the &quot;Secret Santas&quot;. A group of Santas that make deliveries in their own country, and even becoming like him as well. All they have to do is wear his coat, and he shares his magic to them, as well as their bodies shaping themselves to be like Santa himself.<br />
<br />
To become fat, but not immobile. To become old, but not elderly. To become jolly, But still sane. And of course, if a woman volunteers then she will become a man as if she was always this way, and he will still have a woman&#39;s heart. For all practical purposes, they are still themselves mentally.<br />
<br />
As long as they are inside his workshop, with it&#39;s magic there&#39;s no language barriers, and it will be like everyone speaks one language. Besides the Elf language, Santa technically only speakes, English and Japanese, because the former is the most spoken language on earth, and the latter he was told to read Japanese stories in its intended language. Also he was shown Sumo Wrestling which he never got around to try. Him being a polyglot is unfortunately a myth. So the fact that he got other Santas helping him who can speak those languages so that way everyone can talk to Santa. That actually explains it. So what happens when a dark skin person volunteers? Well...<br />
<br />
In the past the Elves ended up... By mistake! Brought a stowaway in the sleigh. A black teenager named &#39;Elliot&#39; who doesn&#39;t believe in Santa, as well as the whole Christmas bit. Thinking this Holiday is just overated. While he was there he snuck in Santa&#39;s office, and thinking that it would be a funny prank, decides to wear Santa&#39;s coat. To him, it not all that special, it just a coat after all. But what he didn&#39;t know is that he &#39;indirectly&#39; volunteer to be a Secret Santa Claus!<br />
<br />
And of course, being black doesn&#39;t stop him from being a Santa, and it shows, he went from an average build teenager to an overweight man in his 40&#39;s with a white beard, but his dark skin stayed the same. He fit in his role without changing his skin color. At first he was scared out of his mind, the change was slow, but gradual. And after about 12 days of his body changing, his transformation was done. Santa told Elliot after he was caught wearing his coat. &quot;You were expecting a punishment for your intrusion? Well you&#39;re about to get it young man! As soon as it&#39;s Christmas you are going to do my job as my new assistance, my new &#39;Secret Santa&#39;!&quot; <br />
<br />
And so years have passed, and he had his fair share problems down the road. Even with that he is not white, he is still Santa to them. Sure, he did help Prime Santa with his own problems, and while he did understand the meaning of Christmas, and what Santa and how he does things. Once you volunteer as Santa you&#39;ll be as him until your job is done for the year. Though there are some exceptions, you can even stay as him for a bit longer, though this magic... Is not permanent!...<br />
<br />
Once your back to your real body, it goes as if your body is normal. In other words... You aged like normal. Unlike the real Santa who is immortal. They can&#39;t be Santa forever... So wanting to move on while he&#39;s still young. Elliot wishes to retire from being a Secret Santa, and Santa is much obliged, and let him go. Santa hasn&#39;t seen him since 5 years, at least not face to face. The man who inspired the Black Santa, is living a happy life as a father. And Santa is smiling.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m happy for you... Elliot... Have a Happy Holiday season!&quot; Santa gladly says. as he turn away from the globe, and left the library...<br />
<br />
<br />
--------------------<br />
<br />
Moving on from that, he checks in with the Guard-Elf, who is tasked with...<br />
<br />
Santa then sees a sleeping Fat Elf. Of course he didn&#39;t get much sleep, but he did promised to keep this work going. This is getting irritable...<br />
<br />
&quot;Rolly! Wake up!&quot; Santa shouted. That snap the poor Elf awake. The elf shakes his to dispel the dizziness.<br />
<br />
&#39;Rolly the pudgy Guard-Elf&#39; is facing Santa with worry. Confused for a Half-Breed, Rolly is a very fat- or rather an obese for an elf. He wears the same uniform like his fellow elves, but for him... They seem almost ill-fitting for him. With what his pants occasionally ripping when he eats, or bents over. which explans his too big pants for him. But then his tunic-like dress shirt, it often rise up to show his exposed tummy, belly-button and all. He didn&#39;t get an extra size for it yet. He just hope the inevitable doesn&#39;t happen.<br />
<br />
&quot;So any word on him?&quot; Santa asked. As he looks at him, expecting results after his laziness.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, I checked everywhere on the the North Pole. But nobody.&quot; Rolly stated. But he didn&#39;t understand what he was looking for. And Santa noticed it right away.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you know who you&#39;re looking for?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh... Who?&quot; Rolly asked wincing. This may not be what he wanted to hear.<br />
<br />
&quot;Krampus! That Satyr-like monster, who undermines my work by kidnapping the naughty kids!&quot; Upset that he has to spell it out for him. Rolly had a thought, and he spoke without thinking.<br />
<br />
&quot;Santa... If he is such a threat. Why not asked ask the Bunny, or the Tooth Fairy or-?...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t want to involve the Guardians if I don&#39;t need to... Mother Nature would not be happy if I brought up a non-issue.&quot; Santa stated. rising a hand to his right temple. He didn&#39;t want to make another false alarm. &quot;Calling them will be our last resort! Understand?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, right! Uh... Understood!&quot; Rolly says sheepish. Then he thought for a moment what Santa said earlier about Krampus... &quot;But Santa... If he only targets the bad kids then maybe we should just-...&quot; Santa stopped him on his tracks.<br />
<br />
&quot;We will not take that chance!... He is a menace, and I cannot have someone like him, come in the scene just to kill the joy of Christmas. He even captures my worker Elves, and almost manipulated the Secret Santas!&quot;<br />
<br />
At this point Rolly would not think twice anymore. If he&#39;s convince then so is Rolly. &quot;Okay Santa! I understand... No taking any chances!&quot; He said confident.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good! Do not ever suggest anything like that ever again... Just remember what you had to go through before Elliot saved you.&quot; Santa told Rolly.<br />
<br />
Rolly was captured by Krampus, although he can&#39;t remember anything. But he was told what happened, in fact it was Elliot who saved him. And he still can&#39;t thank him enough. So before he went back to work, he wanted to asked Santa about Elliot.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes sir! Um Santa?... How is he? I just want to know what his child-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Rolly! Just go!...&quot; Santa pointed at his post. &quot;...And keep a look out for Krampus! And after you&#39;re done with your shift. Then I&#39;ll tell you more about him.&quot;<br />
<br />
The poor guy, With him being a fat elf he seems hardly qualified to be here. But he wanted to be on the action. And Santa gave him that task. Could anybody else do this?... Sure, He does have other Guards-Elves, but they are busy protecting the toy makers from potential threats, and Rolly was one of the few who are committed enough to stay on duty.<br />
<br />
If only he can keep himself from eating, and snoozing.<br />
<br />
Like what Santa said, Krampus is sort of like Santa&#39;s dark side. A satyr-like being who adores punishing naughty children, by taking them and, beating them (But not kill them!) until they would remember to be good.<br />
<br />
This goes against everything Santa stands for. He wanted to teach kids how to be good, but not like this... Giving these poor children the traumatic experience that makes them not want to go out, and live.<br />
<br />
For all practical purposes, Krampus is an animal that needs to be locked up! And as Santa makes his way outside. He smiles.<br />
<br />
And speaking of animals...<br />
<br />
<br />
--------------------<br />
<br />
After having an angry moment, Santa only wanted fresh air, albeit freshly &#39;cold&#39; winter air...<br />
<br />
As he made his way to the stables where his own reindeers are. There, he meets &#39;Buddy the Stable-Elf&#39; who is build like an actual farmer... With muscles, and a bit of fat. And he wore overalls with a hat, and a big tolerance with bad animal smells. Somebody has to keep the stables clean.<br />
<br />
Santa with all his wisdom, decides now is the time to use his magic.<br />
<br />
&quot;So Buddy, feelin&#39; like hav&#39;n fun to night? Ho ho ho.&quot; He spoke with a twang. That got Buddy&#39;s attention, wide eyed he said with a southern accent. &quot;Santa! No!&quot; he started. &quot;I can&#39;t handle them while the reindeer are being whiny! I rather them saying &#39;moo&#39; instead&#39;a talkin&#39;!&quot;<br />
<br />
That gave Buddy glares from the reindeers. Buddy remarked. &quot;Now don&#39;tcha go lookin at me like that! Why! Y&#39;all can still think for yer-selves!&quot; Santa shakes his head. He&#39;s not lying, the reindeer do complain, like alot. he often feels like they... Well, at least need a friend outside of the North Pole... Another reindeer perhaps.<br />
<br />
&quot;But still,&quot; Santa started. &quot;I want to hear them out.&quot; With a wave, they began to change. &quot;Ah naw! Heck naw!&quot; Buddy holds his hat down covering his pointy ears, he knew where this is going, he seen this alot. Santa used his Transfiguration magic on the reindeers, to make them anthropomorphic so they can talk to him. By giving them not only speech, but also the ability to walk on two legs, and grab things with their front hooves, like as if they can play card games with them.<br />
<br />
Yes, basically he has made the reindeer a humanoid Furry creature!<br />
<br />
And Buddy of course doesn&#39;t take it very well. &quot;Santa! It took me awhile to keep &#39;em calm!&quot; Santa waves him off. &quot;Calm down Buddy. This won&#39;t take long.&quot;<br />
<br />
Now, you know the names like Dasher, and Dancer, and Prancer, and Vixen, and Comet, and Cupid, and Donder, and Blitzen? Well they &#39;were&#39; the original reindeers that pull the sleigh when it all began. but these are not the &#39;Original Reindeers&#39;. Instead those names are now more, or less a title of position in the sleigh that they would be in. So then what about &#39;Rudolph&#39;? Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer is considered a legend. Nobody knows if the story was real, or not. Maybe there &#39;was&#39; a reindeer named &#39;Rudolph&#39; back then, but only Prime Santa would know.<br />
<br />
And so Santa hears them all out one at a time, each of them are males, but they are all come in shapes, and sizes. A lot of them are muscular, one of them is on the younger side &#39;Sparky&#39;, and one of them &#39;Teddy&#39; (in his Anthro form at least) sports a muscle-gut body, and one of them is like a veteran reindeer &#39;Roger&#39;. And like Buddy predicted, they all say nothing but mindless complaining. Nothing constructive. Except for three things...<br />
<br />
<br />
Roger the Leader reindeer: Requests that we have some new members, that way he can perpare them for this lifetime job. Or at the very least, bring in fresh faces to make this group feel lively once more.<br />
<br />
Teddy the Chunky reindeer: He wanted to travel the world, not as a job, but as a vacation, and maybe even live a little as an Anthro, as odd looking as they are now. He even admitted he wanted to at least give sumo wrestling a try. Ever since seeing a billboard Ad in Japan. They (himself included) feel coop up in a farm stables, filled with no one but, other sleigh pullers. They too want a little bit of freedom.<br />
<br />
Sparky the youngest reindeer: He was hoping to find a new friend, even if they don&#39;t join the sleigh team, then maybe at least someone else to talk to. He feels like an outsider being the youngest one in the group, he&#39;ll even become a human if that&#39;s what it takes. <br />
<br />
<br />
He did somewhat expected a request like that, and that&#39;s fair. Roger wanted new blood, or new visiters, Teddy wanted to see the world, not just glance at them while traveling, he even likes sumo wrestling, and Sparky wanted a friend to share his stories with. He&#39;ll do anything for it. Santa takes their words into consideration. Maybe at some point he&#39;ll do something about it.<br />
<br />
Until then, Santa reverted the anthro reindeers back to their normal regular reindeer selves, back on all fours again.<br />
<br />
After they&#39;re in the building, Buddy the Stable-Elf was pleased with that event. Finally he can unplug his pointy ears. &quot;I cannot believe ya did that! Ya be givin&#39; me migraine afta&#39; that!&quot; he said rubbing his temples. Santa petted his head. &quot;You rest now, go home Buddy!&quot;<br />
<br />
And so, Santa is on his way back to the workshop...<br />
<br />
<br />
--------------------<br />
<br />
Just for fun, Santa took a long way to get there.<br />
<br />
Passing through a small village, called &quot;The Elf Villa&quot;. Where all the buildings, while not tiny, tailer made for both elves, and normal sized people like Santa so both of them would be able to visit. With exceptions like their own individual houses.<br />
<br />
Seeing a village of houses just for the Elves, while yes, those who work for him do live in his workshop. But those who have families of their own would much prefer to have a place for themselves, spaces of their own.<br />
<br />
And of course, giving them privacy for reasons not worth mentioning.<br />
<br />
In the beginning most, if not all of the elves are pale skinned, and thin. Santa recruited them back when only a few children knew about him, But as the number of children grew, neither did the elves.<br />
<br />
Santa with his magic wanted to bring in not only more elves, but perhaps, little bit of diversity.<br />
<br />
Then, they start to repopulating elves by changing what was once human into elves, and humans came in different body types. As well as different colors of skin.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, that came with its own set of prejudice among the pure blooded elves. Being opinionated about the severity of their race, and that it shouldn&#39;t be tampered with. While the other side argued &#39;If places like America can change, so too does Elf Villa&#39;. And sure, the hate is not gone entirely, but it&#39;s not as strong as was from the start. The few who still held on to that, often think of them as &#39;Half-Breeds&#39;...<br />
<br />
In any case, this place feels lively all the same. And Santa wouldn&#39;t want change too much about it, or at least nothing too drastic anymore.<br />
<br />
Passing by building after building, ones that would houses clothes, one on antiques, one on the bakery, one on selling books and even one that sells movies. If you can believe it.<br />
<br />
A couple of kind plump elf bakers who runs the bakery, gave Santa a big pie to take with him for his lunch break. He thank them for their kindness, and told them to keep on giving happiness with their pies.<br />
<br />
And after Santa made it to the workshop, he is greeted with a familiar face... &#39;Sally the Elf-Seeker&#39; who is tasked to find more elf recruits. who was originally a human woman, but now she is an elf, and willing help Santa in anyway, ever since he save her from Krampus.<br />
<br />
Afterwards, they had lunch together, and they&#39;re eating pie. Sally starts. &quot;So Santa, How is he doing?&quot; Asking about Elliot. he replies. &quot;He is living his life with happiness. Sure, I&#39;ll miss seeing my friend again, but it&#39;s for the best. They can&#39;t be Santa forever.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, he still has a family back home. He doesn&#39;t want to keep abandoning them.&quot; she said sadly. Santa nodded. Sally asked. &quot;So then... Any word on... &#39;Krampus&#39;?&quot; she whispers the name.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nothing... None at all.&quot; Santa answered. Sally made a sound like &#39;Hmm&#39;, and Santa looks at her. &quot;What is it Sally?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The &#39;Nothing&#39; answer is what scares me. We don&#39;t know what he&#39;s planning, or what he&#39;s doing. Let&#39;s hope for the best that-...&quot; Sally paused thinking of the right words to say. Santa thought ahead.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well whatever he&#39;s planning, we will be prepared.&quot; As Santa continues, he was losing track of what to say. &quot;After all we haven&#39;t seen him in like... Oh, how long was it?...&quot; Somebody answers for him.<br />
<br />
&quot;About 10 years sir!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes ten yea-... Rolly!&quot; Santa turns to the pudgy guard-elf. &quot;What is it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I have something urgent that needs your attention!&quot; Rolly says. But before they left, the fat elf sniffs the air, and sees his favorite food, from his favorite bakery! A pie! Only one quarter left. But this is definitely pie! So he asked. pointing at the plate.<br />
<br />
&quot;Excuse me?... Are you gonna finish that Pie?&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
--------------------<br />
<br />
Santa wanted to ask Rolly what the problem is. But Rolly&#39;s too busy eating the rest of the pie while they&#39;re walking towards the library. Santa could&#39;ve said no, and finished the rest of it himself. But then he would&#39;ve been a hypocrite. Preaching the fact that &#39;Christmas is all about giving&#39;, and yet he just keeps the pie for himself. But if he did that maybe then he&#39;ll know what&#39;s wrong.<br />
<br />
Just as soon as they got there, Rolly just finished his share of the pie. With a burp, he rubs his belly with gusto. &quot;Yummy! They know how to make the best pies here in the North Pole! Huh?&quot; He then looks at Santa with a dazed expression, who simply says. &quot;Yes, they do.&quot; That snapped him awake. Rolly was blushing as he realized who he is talking to. &#39;That was embarrassing!&#39; Rolly thought to myself.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now then... What is it Rolly?&quot; Santa asked the pudgy Elf. Who is worried about the situation. So much so, He brought Santa back to where he left the globe to show him something. And when they got there Rolly is already working on setting it up to make the orb bigger.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is bad, REAL bad! I was looking for any potential elves to work for us, and I saw-...&quot; Santa stops him. &quot;I thought I told you to keep a look out for Krampus?&quot; he&#39;s not angry, per se, but an explanation as to why he&#39;s avoiding his actual job would&#39;ve be nice.<br />
<br />
Santa then asked. &quot;I left the Elf member seeking to Sally. Why are you shirking your work?&quot; Rolly didn&#39;t dare interrupt the Big man, he did not have the patiences for that. Rolly spoke after he finishes. &quot;Well... Sir... I- uh... I don&#39;t know if Krampus has anything to do with this but... But I sense dark energy in that area, it could be sadness, or anger I-... I need you to have a look!&quot;<br />
<br />
And so Rolly made the orb from the Snowglobe bigger, big enough to view in the whole library, even from afar. &quot;What do you think this means?...&quot;<br />
<br />
Santa looks at the Globe in thought, then says. &quot;It means... We have somebody that needs our attention!&quot; And so he left to prepare his magic to either transform (something/somebody) without them knowing it, or show up unannounced to give them a hand.<br />
<br />
And that somebody... Is you!</p>
