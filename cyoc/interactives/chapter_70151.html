<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The next morning David found a text waiting for him. It read:<br />
<br />
‘hey dave, u feeling better yet? Im going to come by today about 12 to make sure ur ok, alex’<br />
<br />
Shit, thought David, it was after half 11 already by the time he’d woken up, he didn’t have long before Alex <br />
was due to arrive. What was he going to tell him? How could he explain growing to bodybuilder size in a <br />
fortnight? While he was worrying, he had an idea and started picking up handfuls of clothes and arranging them <br />
under his bedsheets. He closed the curtains, turned the radiator way up and the lights up, and threw crunched <br />
up tissues all over. Just as he’d thrown his tenth tissue there was a knock at the door.<br />
<br />
David ran to the door, regained his composure, and opened it, seeing Alex’s familiar face. For a moment he was <br />
puzzled – hadn’t Alex been shorter before? – but he quickly pushed that thought away and said, “Hi, can I help <br />
you?”<br />
<br />
Alex was clearly shocked by the muscleman standing in front of him, but eventually said, “Erm yeah, I’m a <br />
friend of David’s, just wanted to see if he’s OK...who are you?”<br />
<br />
“I’m his cousin Jared from across town, I’m his closest relative so I came to take care of him. Poor guy, been <br />
sick as a dog for like two weeks now bro.”<br />
<br />
David wasn’t sure why he’d picked Jared as his fake name, but he liked it. He felt like it suited his new body <br />
much better than David did anyway. He gave Alex a quick look over too. Dressed in a green t-shirt and denim <br />
shorts and with slightly matted hair, Alex looked like he’d just got back from the beach. David could see his <br />
nipples poking through the t-shirt, his big pecs pushing the shirt out nicely, and a little pre leaked out of <br />
his dick.<br />
<br />
“Oh right, well I just came by to make sure he was OK, me and the guys haven’t seen him for about that long. <br />
Can I see him?”<br />
<br />
“Sure, he’s in his room, follow me.”<br />
<br />
David led Alex into his bedroom and warned him, “He’s very weak and might not be up to talking. I wouldn’t go <br />
closer than the other side of the bed too if I was you, it’s some nasty shit he’s got.”<br />
<br />
Alex perched on the other side of the bed and said, “Hey Dave, it’s Alex. Just wanted to check you’re alright, <br />
me and the guys were getting worried. But it sounds like you’re still unwell...” Alex paused to give ‘David’ <br />
time to respond, but when the piles of clothes didn’t say anything he continued, “Well I guess you’re too sick <br />
to talk but that’s OK, I’m going to leave some stuff with your cousin here. Get well soon buddy.”<br />
And with that Alex got up and he and David left the room.<br />
<br />
Alex took a deep breath out, “So what exactly’s wrong with him?”<br />
<br />
“It’s a really bad flu – doctors can’t really do anything for it so they just said for him to rest. Tell you <br />
what, give me your number and I’ll tell you when he’s better.”<br />
<br />
“Sure,” Alex said, writing it down on a piece of paper, “And give this to him too will you? You know, for when <br />
he’s better,” Alex handed David a bottle of red wine as he was leaving – it used to be one he really liked, <br />
but from last night’s experience David didn’t think he’d have much of an appetite for it any more.<br />
<br />
“Sure thing, thanks Alex,” David replied as he closed the door on him. Just as the door closed Alex realised <br />
that he’d never told Jared his name, how had he known?<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, David let out a sigh of relief. Alex hadn’t realised it was him, so he opened his bedroom curtains <br />
again and threw his clothes on the floor from the bed. Then he put on his uniform, packed a gym bag and headed <br />
off for an afternoon shift at work before he could spend the rest of the day working out. His shirt was really <br />
snug across his big pecs, back and arms, and his ass was incredibly pronounced through the pants. Fuck I look <br />
good, David thought.<br />
<br />
When he got to work, he ran almost immediately into Mrs Somers, who didn’t look happy.<br />
<br />
“David, could I see you for a moment? In my office.”<br />
<br />
David followed her in and closed the door.<br />
<br />
“Sit down,” she said while opening a notebook, “David, I’ve been paying a lot of attention to you over the <br />
past two weeks. You’re usually very conscientious, but lately you’ve made lots of mistakes. To be specific: <br />
forty-three orders taken incorrectly and sent back to the kitchen; twenty-two instances of undercharging <br />
customers; three tables allowed to leave with no payment taken at all; and twelve instances of you admiring <br />
yourself in silverware instead of serving customers. What do you have to say for yourself?”<br />
<br />
David felt very uncomfortable. He knew he’d made mistakes but it was very unsettling to hear them itemised and <br />
numbered. He looked into his hands and mumbled, “Sorry Mrs Somers.”<br />
<br />
His supervisor sighed, “David I’m afraid sorry isn’t going to cut it. I’ve also noticed there have recently <br />
become things more important to you than work – you’ve put on weight very quickly. I don’t know how you’ve <br />
managed it but it’s none of my business. And there’s all that time looking at yourself in the silver. I think <br />
it’s best if you focus on what you’re interested in and if I find a replacement.”<br />
<br />
Suddenly shocked, David asked, “Wait, am I being fired?!”<br />
<br />
“What I said David is that it serves neither yourself nor the company to have you here if you can’t focus on <br />
your job. Your redundancy check is in the mail. Please vacate the premises, thank you,” Mrs Somers went back <br />
to some paperwork on her desk while David sat there. What would he do now? After sitting and thinking for a <br />
minute or two he got up and left. Before he knew it, he’d walked to the gym, and had the most intense workout <br />
of his life. He may not have been as smart as he had been but David understood the gravity of the situation. <br />
Without a job how would he pay rent? Or for food? Or, as seemed most important at that moment, his gym <br />
membership?<br />
<br />
With nowhere else to turn, David decided at the end of his workout to text Tony:<br />
<br />
‘got fired, need help finding a job. Can we meet? Dave’<br />
<br />
A reply came almost immediately:<br />
<br />
‘orange bar, 9pm tonight, tony’<br />
<br />
David smiled. He may not have a job but at least Tony might be able to help. With this in mind David hit the <br />
showers, washing away the sweat from his large body. As he washed himself he noticed there was a lot of hair <br />
on the floor of the shower. As he looked his body over he saw to his surprise that he now had much less pubic <br />
and body hair than before. Not that he’d been hairy at first, but now he looked almost smooth. He looked <br />
himself over in the mirror and decided he looked better this way, it made him look bigger somehow.<br />
<br />
By the time he was all dressed it was very nearly 8pm, he’d been in the gym for just about 7 straight hours <br />
and was feeling really pumped by now. So he grabbed some food and then went to the Orange Bar, in the same <br />
booth as the night before, ordered a beer and waited for Tony.<br />
<br />
David didn’t know why he’d asked Tony. He thought for a moment and decided it was just because he was the only <br />
one who knew David as he had become. However there was something else, another reason he wanted to see Tony <br />
again. He felt very at ease around him: comfortable and as though he could be himself, or his new self at any <br />
rate. Like he could check out guys without reproach and discuss the upcoming changes but also...oh shit. David <br />
realised he had a crush on Tony.<br />
<br />
Just then the man in question sat down at the booth with a beer, saying “I’m so sorry to hear you lost your <br />
job Dave. Happens to a lot of guys in our position: as they change they lose what makes them good at the job <br />
too. But in your case I’m sure you won’t miss waiting tables.”<br />
<br />
“That’s true,” replied David, “But I just can’t think of anything else I could do. I thought maybe...” he <br />
trailed off as he became a bit self-conscious and looked down into his beer.<br />
<br />
“Maybe what?”<br />
<br />
“Maybe...you could get me a job?” David said looked up at him hopefully.<br />
<br />
“You do remember what I do right? Modelling and porn? Which do you wanna do bro?”<br />
<br />
“I’m not ready for porn that’s for sure. Know anyone who needs a muscle model?”<br />
<br />
Tony slouched back in his seat and sighed, “I can ask around but I’m not sure. Let me have a think and get <br />
back to you. Anyway, onto what I wanna talk about: have you grown since yesterday?!”<br />
<br />
David looked himself over. Maybe he had but he couldn’t tell without taking his clothes off, “I don’t know. I <br />
did spend seven hours in the gym today. Didn’t know what else to do after I got fired.”<br />
<br />
“Shit...looks like it’s having a huge impact in your first month...” Tony said as he stared at David, “Tell <br />
you what, let’s get you home and find out!”<br />
<br />
“Sure,” David replied as he drained his beer. His heart fluttered – Tony wanted to go back to his place, would <br />
this mean more sex or something...more?<br />
<br />
After a quiet and slightly uncomfortable cab ride, they arrived back at David’s place.<br />
<br />
“Alright fucker, first things first, let’s get you weighed,” Tony said. David lead him into the bathroom, <br />
stripped off and stood on the scales. Tony looked him over with a big grin on his face and a lump in his pants <br />
before asking, “Well?”<br />
<br />
“Shit...” David replied, “Two-forty-five.”<br />
<br />
“Are you kidding me? Twenty-five pounds in a day?! How big are you trying to get?!”<br />
<br />
“I don’t know...I didn’t really think about it, after I got fired I didn’t really have anything else to do. I <br />
needed to blow off some steam...I didn’t think about it as anything else...”<br />
<br />
“Of course you didn’t. You said thinking hurts now right? That’d explain it...shit man I can’t believe how big <br />
you are, you’re only twenty pounds behind me, and if you don’t get another job soon I bet you’ll pass my size <br />
easily, maybe even tomorrow.”<br />
<br />
David felt bad but he couldn’t really explain why, “Sorry Tony...”<br />
<br />
“Sorry?! Shit man I’m impressed! Don’t apologise, it’s been months since I’ve seen a bigger guy than me...the <br />
thought of you being bigger...dude I’m so turned on right now,” Tony said as he gave his crotch a rub, <br />
“Also...have you shaved today?”<br />
<br />
“No, why?”<br />
<br />
“Because bro, you were way hairier than this yesterday. Your pubes were like a forest and you had hair all <br />
over, now...damn man you’re real smooth,” Tony said as he slid a hand over David’s smoother chest and stomach, <br />
“What happened to it all?”<br />
<br />
“There was some on the floor of the gym shower...I didn’t really think about it...”<br />
<br />
Tony grinned and replied, “Of course you didn’t. But yeah man you’re real smooth now. And I tell you, there’s <br />
a decent calling in my line of work for smooth muscle...”<br />
<br />
David was confused, “Which work is that?”<br />
<br />
“Modelling and porn, not so much the acting,” Tony said as he ran his hands across David’s broad shoulders. <br />
David giggled at the mention of porn – he wasn’t comfortable enough with himself just yet...but if it meant <br />
more time with Tony he could work his way up to it.<br />
<br />
“You’ve shrunk a bit too. Not much, maybe an inch or two, but enough for me to notice,” Tony observed.<br />
<br />
“My buddy Alex stopped by today, I thought he looked taller but I guess that explains it,” David said slowly.<br />
Tony looked back at David after he’d finished, “Did he recognise you?”<br />
<br />
“No, at least if he did he didn’t say...I think I fooled him,” David said, and told him about how the visit <br />
had been.<br />
<br />
“So you called yourself Jared huh? I like that, suits you. It’s a big, powerful name. Maybe that should be <br />
your name when you’re all done.”<br />
<br />
David liked the sound of that. Jared. It felt right somehow.<br />
<br />
Tony stood away from David awkwardly for a moment, then said, “Anyway it’s late, I’d better be going. I’ll be <br />
in touch if I find you some work, but I think you’d better leave starting until after you’re done changing. <br />
Bye.”<br />
<br />
David was saddened by this – he didn’t want Tony to go. He watched him go out the door, and went to bed <br />
without jerking off, for once.</p>
