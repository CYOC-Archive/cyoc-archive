<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Hey,&quot; Jessy asked, &quot;You don&#39;t think we&#39;re to be sold off as pets for aliens do you? Or we&#39;re gonna be one big theme park for aliens?&quot;<br />
<br />
Both Sammy and Doctor Sammy both seriously considered this option. <br />
<br />
Both Sammies found the idea of being owned by someone like a pet unpleasant and unwanted, and the idea of being fed, sold, traded, like slaves, they hated even more. <br />
<br />
&quot;Naw.&quot; Doctor Sammy shrugged. &quot;If aliens had the power to do this, then they&#39;d make us eager to be pets too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What if they want us to be sad at being pet cause they think that&#39;d be fun?&quot; Jessy added.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then we&#39;d also be scared and sad about being baby furs if they found us being sad fun, but we&#39;re happy instead. And if were being made into a theme park, I think we&#39;d have copy right marks stamped on us everywhere, and we&#39;d be still charging for stuff, charging MORE for stuff.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What if the aliens don&#39;t use money?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;d still be more interested in entertaining guests than making friends. And if they wanted our world as a theme park, they do it a lot faster than we are.&quot;<br />
<br />
So it came to be agreed, that no, the source of the baby furs, was not likely to be aliens. <br />
<br />
Doctor Sammy told them some more stuff she&#39;d learn about their own kind.<br />
<br />
One thing major Doctor Sammy noted, was while every now knew what the baby fur&#39;s laughter did, humans were naturally drawn to it anyway. Doctor Sammy showed Sammy some notes (scribbles), she&#39;d interviewed a baby fur skunk who&#39;d said when he was human he said he&#39;d &#39;slip his wrists&#39; or something the moment he heard the baby fur&#39;s laughing . . . instead he dropped the knife hearing their laughter and headed straight for them, tossing off his clothes behind him as his underwear turned into a diaper and he grew his furry tail. <br />
<br />
&#39;Something foolish&#39;, Sammy thought. People resisted stuff if they were made to do it, no matter how bad or good it was for them, even stuff they&#39;d do if just asked, it was just the nature of humans. Jessy had been worried Sammy would &#39;do something foolish&#39; if she and her friends had put on ear muffs and stormed his house. Sammy had never actually planned to do something foolish, but he thought about the rest of the world. How many humans out there would rather do something foolish than become friends with baby furs? How many countries? <br />
<br />
Sammy wasn&#39;t VERY worried about himself or his fellow baby furs, almost nothing had been able to actually hurt them, but that wouldn&#39;t stop the humans from hurting themselves if they&#39;d rather do that than becomes friends. <br />
<br />
&quot;Samantha,&quot; Sammy said, &quot;Do . . . you know if, well, if we can kinda, well, make things that are alive, and stopped moving, start moving again?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We  . . . tried.&quot; Doctor Sammy said, she pointed at a plush skeleton hanging in the corner. &quot;My great-great-great-great uncle when the universe-city was founded, don&#39;t know how it got lost.&quot; <br />
<br />
Doctor Sammy then showed them a video tape that looked like one of those old one person short film viewer cartridges and inserted it into a TV in the corner. <br />
<br />
A crayon drawn sigh say &#39;X spera&#39; (and a picture of a mint) 1.&#39;<br />
<br />
And it showed Doctor Sammy waving at the camera while somefur off screen mimed squishing her head. Then the camera showed an Egyptian mummy, that Doctor Sammy touched . . . the mummy turned into a plushie full size baby fur jackal, with the Egyptian jewelry changing into play jewelry or felt. And of course a plushie toy diaper. <br />
<br />
A crayon drawn sigh say &#39;X spera&#39; (and a picture of a mint) II.&#39;<br />
<br />
Next, Doctor Sammy wearing a blind fold touched something under a sheet. The mass underneath shrank and she pulled the sheet away to reveal a baby fur sized, plushie of a baby fur weasel with a toy diaper on it. A tag on its toe, that became like a tag like on any plushie listed &#39;time of going to sleep and not waking up&#39; as a couple days ago.<br />
<br />
A crayon drawn sigh say &#39;X spera&#39; (and a picture of a mint) III.&#39;<br />
<br />
This time the camera wouldn&#39;t even show what Doctor Sammy was touching while blind folded, but she then showed a plush toy arm, and JUST an arm. <br />
<br />
The video ended. <br />
<br />
&quot;It seems . . . that even our . . . ahem, magik, can&#39;t, wake up stuff that&#39;s gone to sleep and won&#39;t wake up.&quot; Samantha said, actually sounding SAD. <br />
<br />
&quot;So . . . are they MAGIC plushies?&quot; Jessy asked a bit timid.<br />
<br />
&quot;They seem to be just plushie. We . . . opened one up, all we found inside was fluff. We actually wanted to figure out how with the power of love to make them move on their own, even if they&#39;d just be plushies that move and not really who they were before they went to sleep not waking up. Maybe they can do stuff like stay behind counters all day or stuff like that. But our friends who wear the stars or crosses around their necks said it was be &#39;dis-re-spect-ful&#39; to them if we used their plushes like that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sammy completely agreed with that. If he&#39;d gone away before making friends, and what he left behind been made into a plushie, he wouldn&#39;t it standing behind a counter all day. <br />
<br />
&quot;Uh,&quot; Jessy surprisingly asked. &quot;I&#39;m wonderin&#39;, does this mean we&#39;re really plushies in disguise?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Actually, me and my friends all talks about that,&quot; Doctor Sammy said pushing up on her big glasses. &quot;Do you pinkie swear not to share with ANYONE EVER what I&#39;m about to tell ya?&quot;<br />
<br />
Sammy and Jessy looked at each other, then they wrapped pinkies with Doctor Sammy. &quot;I hearby do declare a pinkie swear!&quot; They said together. <br />
<br />
&quot;Okay . . . a couple of coyote baby furs, they said they were visiting from Nevada.&quot; She leaned in a whispered. &quot;They became blood brothers.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sammy and Jessy looked at her for once not understanding. <br />
<br />
&quot;I mean,&quot; Doctor Sammy whispered even lower so even their big ears let them hear her. &quot;That they actually were able to get a little needle, and prick themselves, so they both bleed a tiny bit so they could be blood brothers, so we&#39;re not really plushes in disguise.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They BLED?!&quot; Jessy gasped.<br />
<br />
&quot;SHUSH!&quot; Doctor Sammy covered her mouth. &quot;That&#39;s why you pinkie promised not to tell. We told the Governor, and he said we shouldn&#39;t really share this, in case the humans find out. He said, they might do bad stuff.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sammy admitted, keeping that underwraps was reasonable. So far NOTHING had been able to hurt a baby fur from poison to spiked pits (that just turned into ball pits), to an atomic bomb. That two baby furs, agreeing to be blood brothers, had managed to make themselves bleed, WAS something big, and something humans WOULD use if they found out. <br />
<br />
Sammy looked at a picture on the desk, that showed four baby furs. <br />
<br />
Sammy thought about what he saw, he did seem to have thinks a little more than his fellow furs, maybe because when he&#39;d been human he&#39;d spent so much time already around the baby furs who&#39;d become his friends? <br />
<br />
But what Sammy had a think about now was, he honestly couldn&#39;t help but feel sympathy for the humans. When the world all became friends, WOULD there be any traces that humans had existed at all? It felt wrong for it to be like humans had simply never been around, it felt, not nice. <br />
<br />
Well, the little girls in My Neighbor Totoro film had stayed human along with the other characters, so the IDEA of humans wouldn&#39;t vanish, and if they were gonna be baby furs forever, then they&#39;d all remember humans forever too, right? <br />
<br />
Sammy remembered what he had been scared of the most when human was that Jessy wasn&#39;t Jessy anymore, and he wouldn&#39;t be Sammy anymore once they were friends again. The idea he wasn&#39;t really Sammy anymore did scare him. <br />
<br />
Sammy checked himself, he still liked the color red, he hated zucchini, and he loved Jingle Bells. But they were just the outer shell, they could be filled in and replaced by anything. He did loved to DJ music. He still loved the idea of putting together radios. He still liked the idea of collecting and sharing music. Jessy was still his special best friend for him. <br />
<br />
He didn&#39;t think being a baby fur was so bad now, but maybe that was because he&#39;d now tried it? He didn&#39;t want his kind and humans fighting. Sammy did note how he thought of himself as a baby fur now, not as a human changed into one. He still thought of his time as human as HIS time, not someone else&#39;s. <br />
<br />
And he noted that he still didn&#39;t agree with Jessy&#39;s statement that humans were &#39;icky.&#39; And all the baby furs he&#39;d met were unique, not really acting like robots or something.<br />
<br />
And he still didn&#39;t like the idea of people being FORCED to be his friends, forcing others to be your friend was what BULLIES did, and bullies were bad. <br />
<br />
But not even the army baby furs were really engaging into any sort of &#39;stragedy&#39; or PLAN to make more humans their friends, it just continued to spread, seemingly beyond anyone&#39;s control. There was no evil super villain with a furiciation ray he could stop while wearing a really cool cape. No stuck-up invisible people forcing people to become baby furs. <br />
<br />
&quot;Sammy,&quot; Sammy asked, &quot;Can we sleep over at your house tonight?&quot; He asked a baby fur he had just met, and didn&#39;t feel the least bit awkward in asking. <br />
<br />
&quot;Sure!&quot; Doctor Sammy said.<br />
<br />
&quot;And I wouldn&#39;t mind sleeping over!&quot; Jessy nodded, &quot;Even if that means our friends in Franky Town would get to hear your music for a bit.&quot; <br />
<br />
Sammy hadn&#39;t thought about that. But, he did want to see a bit more of the new and improved capital, and talk more ideas with Doctor Sammy. <br />
<br />
Doctor Sammy&#39;s house was like the rest of the capital, perfect to their size and right out of play-school. If Sammy hadn&#39;t know, he&#39;d have never guessed human lived here before.<br />
<br />
Samantha&#39;s husband was a diapered weasel named Allen, and their two children, both baby horses, Jaice and Janet. They were hugs all around. Followed by drawing on the walls, and nap time. <br />
<br />
And on TV, the REAL news, as Sammy thought of it now, showed off the humans latest schemes to try to get rid of the baby furs. Sammy couldn&#39;t stop himself from giggling a little at the antics. <br />
<br />
Poison candy was of course useless for killing baby furs, but candy DID slow them down, since they would stop to have some, (though no baby fur would stop for candy they didn&#39;t like), and little toy finger puzzles it was shown had proven more effective in getting them to stop as they try to figure out the little things. <br />
<br />
One soldier had taken the chance to come out of a fox hole and use a flame thrower, maybe thinking it would change due to still being connected in a way to the whole. Instead it turned into a froth blower, covering the area in suds, and the new baby fur dolphin, using his toy to make friends of everyone in Austin Texas. <br />
<br />
When Sammy had been locked up in his house, he&#39;d never thought about the sheer SCALE the baby furs were spreading. How fast his new world was converting the old one. This wasn&#39;t just a few hundred or a few thousand. There were already at least 67 million of his kind. With the southern coast states between Texas and Florida now their friends, and reaching down to meet up with their friends making more and more friends in Mexico, Cuba, and the other islands, and reaching up to the other states as well. Any humans who hadn&#39;t been been made friends in those areas that now counted as Furryland had fled. And there was no telling how many more the fall out cloud would change as the winds drifted it along. <br />
<br />
At least now he knew why there hadn&#39;t been a rescue staged for him. <br />
<br />
67 million. Had Sammy really been planning to find a way to change back 67 million baby furs into humans? Then again, if Sammy had thought it was still a good idea, he was sure if he was determined enough, he&#39;d think of something, but he hadn&#39;t lied to Doctor Sammy when he said he couldn&#39;t picture himself becoming human again, and didn&#39;t WANT to picture himself being human again. He knew, every last one of those 67 million baby furs and growing, would do anything to help him, because they were friends, just as Sammy knew he&#39;d do the same for them. The idea of losing that level of empathy felt painful. <br />
<br />
He wondered what exciting things he&#39;d learn tomorrow. But there was one important thing to ask.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you know where the first baby fur is?&quot; He asked.<br />
<br />
&#39;Florida&#39; was the only answer he got from Samantha&#39;s family. But there were plenty of more fur&#39;s to ask in the morning.</p>
