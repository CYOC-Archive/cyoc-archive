<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It&#39;s comforting... I feel soft walls around me... a aura of protection emanate from them... It&#39;s so good... It gives a soothing solace... I feel some good... safe...<br />
<br />
There&#39;s a hole above me. It&#39;s getting bigger, and light is starting to filter through it. I&#39;m not accustomed to changes. Movement all around me scares me.<br />
<br />
The enclosure that was so tender to me starts to shiver, faltering slowly. I don&#39;t understand what&#39;s going on, but after a while, strange sensations come from everywhere... a cold feeling all over me, a blinding lighting fueling my fear, a strong scent of chemicals and worst of all, noises. There are some much noises. It seems like a commotion is happening around, clatters, shouting, yelling. I&#39;m scared.... I&#39;m scared...<br />
<br />
After a while, I manage to flutter my eyes open. Screams of joys overwhelm my surroundings again as I do it. I don&#39;t know where I am, but there are a number of strangely clothed individual jumping around and blabbering. Their voices are muffled, a strange detail since they are right next to me... The movements and the sounds are too much... I try to recede back where I came from, but the petals of the flower just won&#39;t stay. I feel vulnerable, weak, exposed... They are all looking at me and I don&#39;t like it! I want to go back! I want to go back, I want to go back, I want to go back...<br />
<br />
The emotions I feel saturates my line of thought. I don&#39;t know what to do... Where am I? Who am I? Who are they? Why am I here? I don&#39;t know anything... I just want to go back to the calm of before... I manage to raise a petal in front of me, to hide myself from their gazes, but it&#39;s far too small to keep me completely hiden. I back up from the side they are from, only to hit a wall. I turn back, trying to spot what I just hit, but there&#39;s nothing! It&#39;s like there is an invisible rampart between me and everything else! Am I trapped? I try to touch the barrier again, to pass through it, to slam through it! But it&#39;s solid. They are still looking at me, I want to step back, I want to go away from them, but I&#39;m stuck... <br />
I&#39;m scared... I&#39;m so scared... Why is this happening... What is happening... <br />
<br />
... What am I?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Most of them brought chairs and drinks next to my glass cage. They are cheerful and merry, chattering about something I don&#39;t comprehend. Their words are imcomprehensible and non-sensical to me. They kept diverting their stares to me, pointing and explaining while I am left wondering. They are so different from me... but also kind of ressembles me... <br />
<br />
I have the same kind of appendages than them, I got two arms, easy to maneuver, and two legs as well. The differences though are simple to spot, as they are covered in strange white clothings while I&#39;m left exposed, the cold air trickling my skin. I also have a different skin color, as they are white or black while I&#39;m... green. I tried rubbing my skin previously, and the texture is quite different from what I expected... The real question though, is what did I expect? Why do I feel so different, an oddity compared to them? I&#39;ve given up covering myself with the mere petals, as I just brang my knees to my chest and my arms surrounding me, trying to find at least a bit of comfort that I lost when I got out. I am positioned the farthest from them I can, but my mobility is limited in my small confine. I feel opressed by everything,  every movement, every sound, every scent is alien and panicking. Even my own actions feels out of place, like my body isn&#39;t supossed to be the way it is... I breathe heavily, and liquid starts pouring from my eyes... Tears are drippling from me... Make it stop please...<br />

We did it. After continuous tries and failure, we managed to create life. I have to say, I was not the most thrilled of the group about this whole experiment. I was torn between the ethics against the idea and my growing scientific curiosity. I embarked in this project because my brother, Derek Stamnler decided to enter it. We tried countless times with different techniques, but strangely, it is one of our embandonned tests that succeeded. We were still studying our 17th attempt, when suddenly, I spotted movement from test 08. I told everybody else and, as we gathered, we saw our creation take form, the flower blooming, revealing a human-plant hybrid. We were jumping of joy, we had created life.<br />
<br />
For festivities, some mentionned some beer bottles they had hidden in stock.  It may seem unprofessional, but you should try creating life and then keeping your calm in procedures! We still made the necessery tests beforehand to make sure that everything was in check, and started recording statistics again for the test 08. We are now surrounding the successful incubator, talking about the implications, the future of the project, and, obviously, the subject itself. We&#39;ve been sitting here for an hour or so, laughing, smiling and even joking about this project finally taking a good turn, and the dynamic shifted from simple celebrations, to what seems like a late night at the bar. The couple Sarisha and Oliver already excused themself to our dormitories... no need to guess what they are doing.<br />
<br />
Derek (Whispering): Hey sis, do you think the Vegegirl is okay? She seems all stressed up in there.<br />
<br />
Myself: I don&#39;t know. We checked her vitals and it stated that she was fine...<br />
<br />
Derek: If you say so...<br />
<br />
We assumed that she was female as we scanned her. The produxtion of Oestrogen is far more present in her than Testosterone. Moreover, her whole petite figure and delicate movement did make the balance turn. Strangely though, we didn&#39;t manage to find her genitals... In fact, a striking feature of hers is the total lack of orifices. A simple look is enough to see that she doesn&#39;t have the normal vagina opening, nor does she have any anus. Only smooth... hum... skin replaces it. She does have a mouth, but she never opened it once. Her whole body is made covered in green cuticle (basicaly the skin of plants) and her hair is replaced by what seems to be thick leaves shaped like the long filaments flowing on her whole body. These leaves are absolutely long and is she standed up, they would probably droop down to her knees at least. Her most defininf features though... for me at least... is her deep hazel, almost orange eyes. <br />
<br />
Terance: Hey gang... Am I the only one to find her kinda cute?<br />
<br />
Derek: Now that you say it... Smash indeed!<br />
<br />
Teresha: *sigh* Oh you guys...<br />
<br />
A smile at the corner of her mouth betray our boss&#39;s amusement over the remark. The small plant-girl could be qualified as cute, but her sex appeal is basically non-existant. She has no curves, no orifices as stated earlier, and she kind of recoil everytime we approach... She probably is just stranged over her existence, she was just born!<br />
<br />
Teresha: It is odd though, I thought we only created the mother flower to transmit the DNA of a human properly, like in a normal pregnancy! Why is she so... different?<br />
<br />
Myself: My guess would be that the DNA of the vegetal carrier got partially transfered as well, making some sort of hybrid...<br />
<br />
Derek: Ok, but how was it compatible? The two samples of a vegetal and a mammal would not mix to make a viable component normally! How did... THAT even happen?<br />
<br />
Myself: I... I don&#39;t really know to be honest. We should make more tests tomorrow.<br />
<br />
Terance: Yop, we drank too much today to do anything productive.<br />
<br />
Derek: Says the guy who literally drank a full bottle to himself!<br />
<br />
The laughter in the air slowly diminished as the night progressed. Teresha was the first one to go to her dorm, followed by Terance soon after. Zoeh did too soon after, she seemed as reserved as always, even with the power of alcohol. Soon enough, I was left alone with my brother.<br />
<br />
Derek: Hey Sarah, this is incredible right?<br />
<br />
Myself: What do you mean?<br />
<br />
Derek: Well... we just created life! I just... can&#39;t get over how incredible that is...<br />
<br />
Myself: I understand... It&#39;s strange indeed.<br />
<br />
I looked back at our creation, her eyes are wide and brimming with water, at least she is not slamming herself against the incubator&#39;s partition anymore... She still is trembling though. I wonder if she can understand words? Did the DNA mix altered the normal human mind to the point of bestiality? Is she even conscious and aware of her own existence that we bestowed to her? How does she reproduce? Can she reproduce? What will she eat? All these questions are turning in my head since I saw her bud open in front of our amazed eyes. I really hope to find more about her soon... but for now, the effect of alcohol is starting to kick in for me too...<br />
<br />
Myself: Well... I&#39;m going to sleep... You&#39;re coming bro?<br />
<br />
Derek: I&#39;m already following you!<br />
<br />
We left the new life form alone in the lab, as we entered our respective dorms, and plunged into our beds. It didn&#39;t take long for me to find sleep... The anticipation of tomorrow residing in my head...</p>
