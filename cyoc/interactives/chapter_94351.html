<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Corey wiped sweat off his forehead with his enormous, fleshy arm. He bent down to pick up two cinderblocks off the stack, hoisting them into the air like they were made of foam. Suddenly, a tremor went through his arm. The immense weight of the blocks pressed insistently against his wrists and he dropped them with a thud. Woozily, he leaned against a pillar as all the strength and virility drained out of him, leaving him once again skinny as a beanpole. He looked over to where Nick had just undergone a similar transformation. He took off his construction hat and his long blonde hair unfurled in a sweaty mass.<br />
<br />
“Nick,” called Corey, “What just happened? Who were those men? Who were… we?”<br />
<br />
Nick looked over at Corey with sorrow in his eyes. “I tried to protect you. I’m so sorry. But we’re in this together. Let’s go home now, I’ll tell you everything.” As they walked back to Nick’s apartment and shared coffee in his kitchenette, Nick told Corey the sordid details of the past three days, including last night’s discovery about how returning to the same form only strengthened the stereotype.<br />
<br />
“So we can never have sex again?” said Corey, careful not to create a mental picture and inadvertently give himself a boner.<br />
<br />
“Well, we can definitely never do oral,” laughed Nick, “But I think that maybe, just maybe, if we blindfold ourselves, we can have sex before we lose ourselves completely. It’ll be weird and mighty inconvenient, but now that we’re in this together, I know we can make it work.”<br />
<br />
“But every time we do it, we’ll have to spend a couple hours as homophobic straight dudes?”<br />
<br />
“I ever said it was a walk in the park.”<br />
<br />
“So… Do you want to try it tonight?”<br />
<br />
Nick balked. “So soon? Are you sure you don’t want to spend some real time together first?”<br />
<br />
Corey smirked. “Trust me, I’m glad that you’re back and I’m excited to be in communication again. I missed you so much. But I’m also filled with this… This energy. Something residual from that body. I feel like I need to use it while I still can.”<br />
<br />
“OK, Cor. We can try it out. Just block out your schedule for tomorrow morning. Or at least hope that your next form is filthy rich so you don’t have to worry about work anymore.”<br />
<br />
“Can do. I love you, Nick.”<br />
<br />
“I love you too, Cor.”<br />
<br />
The two surfers spent the rest of the evening walking the beach, talking and laughing under the stars. When they finally returned home, it was very late, but Corey doggedly fetched the bottle of lube.<br />
<br />
“Are you sure about this?” asked Nick.<br />
<br />
“Absolutely,” Corey replied, “We need to find out how we can make this work.” I’m ready.”<br />
<br />
Corey lovingly tied Nick’s blindfold then affixed his own around his eyes. He lubed up his stiffening penis, lined it up with Nick’s waiting opening, and began to thrust. His entire body came alive with electricity. Instantly his cock began to thicken and elongate inside Nick, making him moan with ecstasy. His voice slid into a deep baritone as he begged for more.<br />
<br />
Images flashed through Corey’s brain: the waitress from the bar, the stripped from his favorite club, the slut who walked by the construction site, their pussies wet and ready. His body crackled with sexual electricity and he pounded away like a jackhammer, grunting, spittle flying from his set mouth.<br />
<br />
Nick moaned and groaned, pumping his own thick cock in his hand. Being penetrated started to feel alien and wrong, but if he kept jerking his own member and focusing on the hot lifeguard from the community pool in her bikini, his mid-transformation mind was happy.<br />
<br />
Corey swelled with muscle, becoming even bigger and taller than before. His abs were like diamonds, his arms and legs were raging pythons. His neck thickened like a tree trunk and his rectangular face grew a thick, trimmed beard. Curls of dark hair sprayed out of his chest, covering it in a profuse blanket as he thrusted.<br />
<br />
Nick had similarly thickened with muscle, though his was now hidden beneath a layer of fat. A belly burgeoned above his throbbing cock. His tomato red face glistened with sweat and the blonde stubble that thrust once gains from his face follicles pushed out into an unkempt mass that couldn’t exactly be called a beard.<br />
<br />
His mashed nose tweaked as if it had been broken and his teeth turned a grubby grey, flecked with saliva. His body filled with aching pleasure and he came onto his hairless, broad chest, his armpits bristling with dirty, sweaty hair. As he did so, a light winked out in his eyes and a pool of drool formed at the corner of his mouth.<br />
<br />
While they had been at it, the room once again changed into the disheveled heap, but now the stench was almost unbearable. The stink of sweat hung around the room like a mist. A sodden sock hung limply out of the top of a towering stack of greasy pizza boxes.<br />
<br />
With a few more rapid thrusts, Corey grunted and came in an enormous spatter. He pulled out, wiping off his dick with a grungy undershirt as the final facets of his personality kicked in.<br />
<br />
“Hey, Nick,” he said gruffly. Nick grunted in response. He felt like his head was stuffed with cotton. Words didn’t come easily to him anymore. Just physical labor and sex.<br />
<br />
“It’s 7:00, man. Time to go.”<br />
<br />
With that, they both pulled on their clothes, donned their yellow hard hats, and set out for another day’s work under the sun.</p>
