<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">David didn&#39;t know the reason why he could notice the changes. He suspected his latest wish was the cause of it, but given that a literal wishing rock existed let his mind go through all kinds of possibilities. But those weren&#39;t important now: He had to get back the rock before Marco uses it again!<br />
<br />
While Marco was still checking out his even more mind-boggling wife, David rushed over to him, bumping Kailyn and almost knocking her over. He grabbed onto Marco&#39;s forearm with one hand while the other tried to get a hold of the rock. Marco realized this too late, and just as he was about to reacquire the wishing powers a large, powerful hand got both his arms locked tight and pulled him away from Marco, who was still barely holding on to the rock.<br />
<br />
&quot;David!&quot; Was all Sofia said in an angry tone as she dragged him a couple of feet away from Marco with ease. &quot;What has gotten into you?&quot;<br />
<br />
David was too shocked by this sudden turn of events, and an angry Sofia looking down at him as if he was a dwarf didn&#39;t help that feeling either.<br />
<br />
&quot;I told you, mom! David is an ass!&quot; Mason declared.<br />
<br />
&quot;Language, Mason!&quot; As much as Sofia wanted to agree in this moment, she had to keep her son at bay.<br />
<br />
&quot;I-I&#39;m sorry, I was just trying to...&quot; David stuttered like never before.<br />
<br />
&quot;All good, Sofia. Don&#39;t be too harsh on him. I&#39;m sure he wasn&#39;t trying to attack me.&quot; Marco calmed down his amazon-like wife, but David could see the clear intent behind it. &quot;Besides, we have more important business to address. I wish we were in the bedroom!&quot;<br />
<br />
And just like that, in the blink of an eye, both Marco and Sofia were gone without anyone noticing anything off except Marco and David.<br />
<br />
David was furious. For one at himself since he actually managed to lose the rock that held such power and at Marco who was using it even more drastically than David had until now. He knew that Kailyn must still look like an overexaggerated version of her mother, minus the height, but the rock had priority now.<br />
<br />
Without paying any sort of attention to both Mason and Kailyn, which he really, really should have, he angrily walked up to the corner to the stairs. But just as he was about to take the first step, a force much stronger than Sofia had shown just a few moments ago rapidly pulled him back by his left arm.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t think I&#39;ll let you go off that easily after you insulted my sister!&quot; Mason called out from behind him. But as he turned around, David made a bold claim that he would soon regret.<br />
<br />
&quot;Listen up, Mason, I don&#39;t have time for your bratty, little...&quot;<br />
<br />
David was about the same height as Mason, so when he turned around to look him dead in the eyes, he wasn&#39;t expecting to be looking in between a pair of big pecs and abs. Really big pecs and abs! And there wasn&#39;t even a shirt to cover them.<br />
<br />
&quot;...ass&quot; the last word excaped David&#39;s mouth as he tried to comprehend just what happened and who this was. Of course this couldn&#39;t be Mason, but as he looked up behind the wall of pecs, he saw Mason&#39;s face, completely unchanged.<br />
<br />
&quot;What was that? First insulting my sister and then me?&quot; Mason lifted the forearm of his relaxed arm towards him. As his hand formed a fist, he flexed his upper arm, causing David&#39;s eyes to almost fall out of their sockets. Mason had always been average at most when it came to body size and muscularity, but the cannonball that was snuck under the skin where his bicep should have been proved him otherwise.<br />
<br />
He didn&#39;t know why, but Marco must have wished for this. Mason got a huge overhaul in terms of his physique. He was standing at an impressive 8&#39;6&quot;, only a foot smaller than Sofia was but equally as huge to David. But what Mason lacked in height he added in muscle mass seemingly exponentially. Besides his cannonball biceps he had pecs that stuck out by almost a foot with 8 tightly packed, almost endlessly deep abs beneath them. His legs, which almost reached David&#39;s chest, were as thick as a tree trunk and bursting with power. He noticed quite the package in his tight shorts which had to be far above average, at least.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, you&#39;re so gonna regret this!&quot; He said as he flung David across the room and against the wall with a simple flick of his wrist.<br />
<br />
The hard impact certainly made David feel some pain, but he wasn&#39;t really injured in any way. Well, at least not yet. As he saw Mason stomp towards him like the hulk, and feeling the weight of each step under his ass, he wasn&#39;t so sure if he&#39;d be able to get up the stairs towards Marco in just a few minutes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey!&quot; A female voice yelled. &quot;Cut it out you big jerk. You don&#39;t have to get all upset because of the smallest of insults. It&#39;s not like he&#39;s wrong, to be honest. You and me look quite a bit different to the rest of the people.&quot; Kailyn exclaimed and Mason stopped in his tracks.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aw, come on Kailyn. Yes, you&#39;re right, but still, he insulted us both!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Stop crying and get to the gym. I&#39;m pretty sure you&#39;re already late.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mason looked at the clock and as much as he wanted to deny it, she was right. So with a last disgusted and angry look towards David, he grabbed his bag and maneuvered his colossal body out of the front door.<br />
<br />
David looked over to Kailyn as if she was a guardian angel, but that thought was quickly out of his mind as he saw some new changes she must&#39;ve undergone as a side effect. All of her curves were still the same just like her mothers, but on top of that all that good-looking chubbiness was exchanged for a fantastic-looking, high-end fitness figure.<br />
<br />
Her waist, which was already relatively small compared to her hips, shrunk down even more as 6 soft but clearly visible abs showed below her dark grey workout bra. Her legs and arms also got slightly bigger, only looking sexier. Her huge boobs stood a little perkier thanks to some strong but not visible pecs supporting them while her assshelf got even bigger and filled out with hard mass under all that soft mass.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t even think about thanking me. But this was the first and last time I&#39;ll safe you from Mason.&quot; She disappeared to another room before David could say a single word.</p>
