<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jen looks at the picture intensely. It showed the familiar image of her old(real?) self, looking happy and proud, confident and sexy in a short, tight minidress, her ample boobs showing through the satin of the dress nicely. Her beautiful young face all done with daring makeup, her long blonde hair straight and flowing over her creamy thin shoulders. &quot;I lost all of this... I lost myself!&quot; Jen thinks and she feels a deep grief and a pinch of anger. &quot;I have to... I have to fix this! I have to fix myself somehow! I don&#39;t want to be a guy, I&#39;m a girl dammit!!&quot; Her heart racing with desperation, Jenny crashes down on her bed, grasping the photo tightly as her tears rain over it. After a few minutes of sobbing, she finally manages to calm down and starts thinking more rationally. &quot;Enough crying&quot; she tells herself, drying her swollen eyes. &quot;This is negative thinking. This obsession over being a girl again isn&#39;t helping me, I need to stop. I need to focus, think positive! You decided to try being a gay guy, Jen, remember? So...man up! Jenny Smith is old news, let her go! Become a guy, Jen! &quot;Jen&quot;... Hmm even that name has to go, it&#39;s female... New rule, female bad, male GOOD! Joe... Yeah, that&#39;s my new name. I&#39;ll be... Joe... Newman! Yeah, thats perfect. Meaningful, symbolic, positive... I have to...kill Jenny Smith, so she can be reborn as Joe Newman... a new man, a new life full of oportunity, to be someone new, whoever I choose, to be a better person... and what&#39;s most important of all things, to be a MAN. Because it&#39;s BETTER to be a man, get that in your head! Screw being a boring straight girl, screw Jenny Smith! She&#39;s just an outdated stereotype, a bigot, a stupid girly girl princess mess! She&#39;s gone and good riddance! Society is better off with this stupid cis-female transitioned into a modern, gay male, right?&quot; Jenny, or maybe we should call &quot;her&quot; Joe from now on, actually feels much better now, her(his!!) self pep talk really helped HIS mood! Joe honestly had to agree with himself, as Jenny she was just a boring stereotypical hetero girl. Heels, skirt, makeup, jock boyfriend... she was even a bit homophobic! Joe rubs his newly shaved head as he shudders at the memories of horribly ignorant and offensive things he had said as Jenny. Being a gay man himself now, he cant help but feel offended by such bigotry. He also felt ashamed because those words were after all said by &quot;herself&quot;! &quot;Such ignorance...&quot; He cringes, &quot;That stupid, bigoted cis-girl! Fuck her, fuck Jennifer Smith! Evil little blonde she-fascist, makes me so mad! People like her are exactly what society needs less of! It&#39;s 2019 for goodness sake.&quot; Joe spits in anger on Jen&#39;s picture before throwing it to the floor. He gets up and rushes into Jen&#39;s parents bedroom. He opens up mr. Smith&#39;s wardrobe, since he knew his &quot;dad&quot; owned quite a few nice suits. It should all fit him pretty good too, judging by his similar build! <br />
While Joe gets dressed, he considers what he should do with his brand new life. Obviously he had to get new ID, and get some sort of job... Now wearing black men&#39;s loafers, light blue slacks, he grabs a nice white dress shirt and starts buttoning up. He smiles, looking at himself in the mirror, thinking how surprisingly nice it felt to wear smart, elegant and MALE clothes! How comfortable the shirt felt on his skin, and how it made him look smart and sexy while fully covered up! He buttons up his collar and starts working on his cuffs and remembers that as Jenny &quot;she&quot; didn&#39;t ever wear button up shirts or full blouses, always and just skimpy, tight crap. &quot;That&#39;s definitely changing from now on &quot;Jenny&quot;, no more skanky tube tops, miniskirts and heeled boots, you&#39;re all about classic masculine elegance now! Suits, ties, vests! Oh, and bow ties are definitely cool, heh heh! You&#39;ll be a true, queer, dapper hipster guy! Just like the ones you used to hate!&quot; Speaking of ties, Joe picks a nice navy blue tie from the drawers and slides it under his raised collar. He grabs Jenny&#39;s phone, cringes at the duckface selfie on the background, and looks up how to tie a tie. Joe nails it immediately and as he pulls up the tie&#39;s knot and fixes his collar, he realizes he is absolutely in love with the crisp shirt and tie look! He smiles a million dollar smile at his reflection and completes his new look with the matching light blue blazer. It fit him perfectly and over all he simply looked dashing! &quot;Joe Newman&quot; he speaks out loud. &quot;Joseph Robert Newman.(he decided to take on the second name of Robert, after Jennifer&#39;s father, whose suit he was now wearing, after all. A way of keeping a tie with his old life. Joe remembers that his father said that if he had a son he would name him Robert jr.) This is who I want to be. This is who I AM! A proud and openly GAY MAN, and I swear to myself that I will do anything within my power to avoid ever becoming a girl again!!!&quot; Joe feels himself getting his first erection. His rock hard cock tents his slacks and he gives it a loving tug. It felt better than anything he had ever experienced as Jenny, he thought, and he didn&#39;t even have an orgasm as a man yet, let alone have sex! Joe smiled as he thought of one thing he definitely wanted to do... Become a LGBT+ activist!! His erection intensified. The erection was caused by pure euphoria instead of lust, his blood rushing due to the sense of newfound freedom he felt! As he adjusted his tie and shirt collar, the new man takes in all of the recent personal epiphanies... Just an hour ago, a mere hour! He was Jenny, a mean, bigoted slutty girl... Now, well just look at that girl! Look at all the positive changes she went through... She became a nice person, with a sensitive, friendly personality. She became smarter, much smarter. She became open minded and socially aware. She is no longer heterosexual and a conservative, she is now gay and a left wing friend of the world. She is now a young adult, all grown up. She is now much less vain. Skimpy miniskirts, cleavage and long platinum blonde hair, replaced by smart shirt-and-tie attire and a discreet brown buzz cut. And last but still worth mentioning, she is no longer a cis-woman, the pronoun &quot;she&quot; no longer applies, in fact... HE is now a gay man and part of the LGBT+ community!(YAY!) Overall, a mean girl became a nice guy! <br />
Joe takes the phone again and he takes a decent new selfie to replace the old embarassing background. No more girl with heavy makeup, making a duckface with her pouty rouged lips, with her boobs popping out of her black shiny tube top. In her place, the picture of a young man, wearing a clean white shirt and  a blue tie, nice snug Windsor knot. His good guy face displaying a nice sincere smile. Joe was about to put the phone in the pocket of his slacks when he hears the message tone! It was a text from Matt, his, or should that be Jenny&#39;s? boyfriend! He says he&#39;s coming over here in a bit, like the two of them planned yesterday... Joe remembers now, Matt was coming over to have sex with him...with Jen! Oh boy... To make things even worse, Fred, another boy was going to come over later in the evening! Jenny had one &quot;official&quot; boyfriend, who was Matt these days, although she was envolved with other four guys right now. Not that Matt knew, of course! So, what should John Newman do about this mess??</p>
