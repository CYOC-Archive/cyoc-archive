<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">There was one person whom Kevin had come to rely on. She was the closest thing the eccentric, prickly man had to a confidante, even though their relationship was strictly business. It was always her to whom he turned when he needed to blow off steam, emotionally or sexually. And so -- while the thought of calling Elwen crossed his mind, as a hot chick who was kind of in the same boat -- ultimately he went with what was familiar.<br />
<br />
He picked up his phone and dialed her number.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello?&quot; Just hearing her sexy voice made him relax slighly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Lianne. It&#39;s me, Kevin. Can you come over? I had... a really stressful day... some crazy shit happened. I need to... see you really bad.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry to hear that, Kevin. You&#39;re in luck; my evening is open.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How soon can you make it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can be there by six-thirty. Or, if you want to treat me to dinner, I can make it by five.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure! Uh, is pizza okay?&quot; He ran his hand through his hair. &quot;I... really don&#39;t want to go out right now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sounds good. See you in an hour, then. Bye.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Bye.&quot;<br />
<br />
He flopped down on the couch, heaving a sigh in relief. Then he bestirred himself to get ready.<br />
<br />
<center>~ 0 ~</center><br />
Her real name was Harriet Diana Witherspoon. But she was Lianne deLane to her clients, and &quot;Diane&quot; to her friends. As a professional escort -- or, more popularly, a call girl -- discretion was an important part of her business.<br />
<br />
She had been in the business for a long time, though she could still pass for a woman in her early thirties. She was of average height, about 5&#39;7&quot;; fit, with a firm bubble butt and full D-cup breasts. Her hair was long and red, with a slight frizz; her eyes green. Faded freckles decorated her face (and bust). <br />
<br />
She did not normally meet people in their homes, but there were about a dozen or so regulars who she felt comfortable enough with to extend this privilege. Among them was Kevin Summers. Not the most personable man, but he didn&#39;t haggle her prices, respected her time, and all around treated her like the professional woman she was.<br />
<br />
So she showered, made herself up, and called her friend Scarlet Spangles to let her know where she would be and to check in on her around seven. Scarlet wasn&#39;t her real name, either; but they had met through the escorting agency under their <i>noms de guerre,</i> and while she&#39;d told Scarlet her real name, she had the feeling Scarlet preferred to go by her soubriquet.<br />
<br />
She entered the older part of town, turning down a street that still clung to pretensions of middle-class but was clearly fading. Kevin&#39;s house was probably the most decrepit on the block. However, as she pulled up in front, she noticed some rather... elaborate renovations. Not over the whole house, but the front door and windows of the living room had been replaced by medieval-looking arches trimmed in silver. It... clashed with the rest of the house, but she had to say, it did suit Kevin in a way. She knew him probably better than anyone, and his secret admiration for the past.<br />
<br />
The door flew open even before she knocked, and she was greeted by Kevin in an old bathrobe. He gestured her inside, and slammed the door shut. She looked around, stunned. It was like she&#39;d stepped into a mansion -- all the antiques that Kevin had scrounged looked <i>new</i>, while the junky odds-and-ends had been replaced with elegant, tasteful and <i>expensive</i> furniture.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow, Kevin,&quot; she managed, tenaciously holding on to her professional aplomb. &quot;You&#39;ve really --&quot;<br />
<br />
She was interrupted by the sight of the bathrobe flying past her to land on the couch. She blinked, and turned to see her client already naked and erect. A joke about him being especially eager died on her lips as she took in the metallic patches and swirls across his skin, and the grim desperation on his face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my God, Kevin!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah you can say that again.&quot; He walked past her and flopped down on the couch. He reached for his cock, hesitated, and laid his hand on his leg.<br />
<br />
&quot;You weren&#39;t kidding about crazy stuff happening.&quot; She had been going to insist on dinner first, and other things later; but seeing the state he was in she changed her mind. Partly due to compassion; but there was something else, and she was seasoned enough to know it.<br />
<br />
There was an <i>attraction</i> she rarely felt with clients, and never with Kevin. Physically he was average; with watery blue eyes, straw-coloured hair now thinning and greying, and a somewhat tall frame with traces of flab, especially in his gut. His cock was thick and his balls a bit big, but she&#39;d seen many cocks in her line of work and was no longer impressed by any -- until now, at least.<br />
<br />
Now her eyes kept getting drawn to it as she sat alongside him on the sofa and put a comforting arm on his shoulder. To her surprise, he leaned tiredly into her. But he didn&#39;t speak, leading her to prompt him.<br />
<br />
&quot;So what happened?&quot;<br />
<br />
A long, tremulous sigh. Then he told her. About finding the medallion, hearing the voice, the pain as the thing fused to his chest; transforming the security guard. About not wanting to wear clothes, about his fucking front room turning into a palace and his god-damned TV disappearing and being replaced by a mirror. What was he supposed to do with a mirror? It&#39;s not like he wanted to look at his ugly mug.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re not ugly,&quot; she reassured him, honestly enough. <i>Plain, but not ugly. Well, not really plain either, any more.</i> &quot;What about the... metal?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It grew out of the medallion when it fused with me.&quot; He shrugged, then hunched his shoulders. &quot;It&#39;s... spreading.&quot; A few seconds of silence. &quot;Lianne... I&#39;m scared. I&#39;m fuckin&#39; scared.&quot;<br />
<br />
She stroked over his back, trying to think of what to say. &quot;I can&#39;t blame you. This is... incredible. Really, literally; I would not have believed anything you told me if it weren&#39;t for seeing it.&quot; She shook her head. &quot;But, Kevin, if it&#39;s any consolation... that guard seemed happy with his -- her change. And your new living room is definitely an improvement.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My TV turned into a fuckin&#39; mirror.&quot;<br />
<br />
She let herself chuckle a little. &quot;That&#39;s my boy. Always looking at the bright side of life.&quot; She pulled him into a half-hug. &quot;Hey, maybe it&#39;s a magic mirror. It sounds like you&#39;re creating a fantasy world. Or well; resurrecting one?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t <i>want</i> to create a fuckin&#39; fantasy world!&quot; He shuddered, his breathing quickening. She went back to rubbing his back. She&#39;d never seen him like this, on the verge of tears. Yet, even as she pitied him, her eyes kept going to his cock. Which somehow managed to remain erect.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry Kevin,&quot; she eventually said, softly. &quot;I can&#39;t do much to... ease this burden you&#39;ve picked up. I know it&#39;s not fair. But I will do what I can to help. Such as...&quot; She reached across with her other hand, laying it on Kevin&#39;s as he restlessly rubbed his leg. She bent forward to make eye contact with him. &quot;Not to push you, but I came here to do a job, and it does seem little Kevin is pretty worked up. Maybe a blowjob will help comfort you?&quot;<br />
<br />
He immediately perked up. Meeting her gaze with eyes even more watery than normal, he blinked back his tears. &quot;A... a blowjob, really? I mean, I was <i>hoping</i> --&quot; he glanced at a polished coffee table holding several condoms alongside a white envelop stuffed with cash &quot;-- but I figured... once you saw me like this... heard my story...&quot;<br />
<br />
She laughed. &quot;Well, what did you expect to do all evening? Just eat pizza and talk?&quot; Though she realised, belatedly, that she <i>ought</i> to be concerned. Even being this close to him probably put her at risk of being transformed. But... she <i>wanted</i> him. That realization also just hit her; she was starting to get damp down below, and her nipples were making their presence known against her bra. She shivered, wondering if this was some effect of the... enchantment or whatever on Kevin.<br />
<br />
<i>Well, in for a penny, in for a pound.</i> She&#39;d offered, and she wasn&#39;t going back on it. And, she rationalised, the changes <i>were</i> positive. She wouldn&#39;t mind turning into an even hotter elf woman. Maybe she wouldn&#39;t have to spend so much money on keeping up her appearance.<br />
<br />
So she stood up and walked to stand in front of him, sensually unbuttoning her blouse, giving him a bit of a show as her pale, red-lace covered boobs came into view. Finally she tossed it onto the couch, and knelt down between his legs.<br />
<br />
&quot;How does bareback sound?&quot; she asked, smirking up at him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh? R-really!? Sounds great!&quot;<br />
<br />
She had <i>never</i> given a bareback blowjob to a client before. But the closer she got to that cock, the more she needed it. Need to feel it, to taste it, to experience its power with no rubber getting in the way. She&#39;d never been this obsessed with cock before either, but -- she laughed quietly.<br />
<br />
<i>Okay, magic dick,</i> she thought, leaning forward and running her hands along the inside of Kevin&#39;s thighs. <i>Let&#39;s see what you can do.</i><br />
<br />
Cupping his balls in one hand, she wrapped the other around it, stroking it while giving little kisses to the tip. Kevin grunted in appreciation, leaning back with his hands on the plush sofa cushions. She pressed in farther, licking up the underside of the shaft and then sucking lightly on his tip. She was rewarded with a spurt of surprisingly good-tasting pre, savoury and salty. Her eyes widened a bit; she&#39;d had a few boyfriends in her time, and none of them tasted this good.<br />
<br />
Kevin groaned as she began sucking on him in earnest, her fingers dancing over his shaft and softly squeezing his hairy balls as she slurped and licked at his crown. He did his best to restrain himself from thrusting, but damn it was a lot harder this time. Maybe it was the fact that she was taking him raw, but it felt so much better. More... primal.<br />
<br />
&quot;Urrrngghhh... so good, Lianne...&quot;<br />
<br />
She felt him trembling, holding back. Normally she preferred not to have men thrust, and corrected clients who presumed it was okay. But this was different. Pausing in her rhythm, she gave him another long lick and then looked up at him through her lashes.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s okay, Kevin. Just let go... do what comes naturally.&quot;<br />
<br />
He gaped at her a minute as she gazed wantonly up at him, her lipstick smudged along his length. Then he grinned. &quot;If you say so, lady.&quot;<br />
<br />
She nuzzled into his cock, smearing pre along her cheek. &quot;Mmm, I do say so. I want everything you&#39;ve got, lover boy.&quot;<br />
<br />
She kissed his base, then licked up again, before sealing her lips around him and going down. His hips jerked, and he felt his tip push against her throat. She gagged slightly, but then took it, moaning around him. Before they knew it, he had his heads twined on her hair, helping to push her forward as she eagerly bobbed her head along his length.<br />
<br />
Then the gate symbol etched into Kevin&#39;s chest began to glow.<br />
<br />
Kevin, staring off into the distance unseeing, didn&#39;t notice. Diane did, however, glancing up to gauge the effect of her work. Her stomach did a flip, and she knew what was happening. She felt afraid... but she didn&#39;t stop. In fact she worked harder, caressed his fat rod with her tongue as it pumped in and out, gently squeezing his balls to make them give up their load. It was an exciting kind of fear -- an anticipation of what was going to happen.<br />
<br />
But Kevin could <i>feel</i> the power rising in him. Suddenly he gruned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nnnrrggghh... stop. Get back.&quot;<br />
<br />
Diane looked at him, confused and reluctant to pull away from his delicious meat.<br />
<br />
&quot;Move... back!&quot; Kevin commanded again, his voice rough with tense need and the power flowing through him.<br />
<br />
So she pulled off and scooted back on her knees. Kevin surged to his feet, and immediately pushed her forward, back onto his cock.  She quickly adjusted, swallowing his thick, throbbing dick with a deep need of her own. It had been a long, long time since she&#39;d been this into a blowjob; but while she recognised that, she didn&#39;t care. She could also feel the power, welling in his flesh, swelling his balls, shining from the metal threading across him; and she wanted it. Needed it to fill her, inseparable from the need to feel his hot seed in her belly, his taste on her tongue.<br />
<br />
And Kevin did not hold back. Diane was always good, but this... He felt young again, better than young; like some primal beast in rut. He pistoned his hips forward and back; his hands entwined in her hair, shoving her in to meet his thrusts. Feeling his swelling balls slapping her chin; the desperate eagerness of her tongue and her lips as she sucked and slurped even amidst the pounding. He leaned forward, teeth grit, eyes closed. Unknowing of the glowing tendrils of metal growing out over his skin, knowing only the power and the need to CUM.<br />
<br />
And when at last the dam broke, he <i>roared</i>. Burying his cock to the hilt, pulsing blast after blast of hot liquid essence and raw magic down Diane&#39;s gullet. Enwrapping both of them in blinding blue-white brilliance.<br />
<br />
And the escort could <i>feel</i> his fingers grow longer, stronger, claw-tipped as they gripped her hair. Feel his cock in her mouth grow thicker, longer, its bulbous head flaring into a point in her throat, little ridges forming against her tongue and palate, a fat knot bulging against her teeth. It should have been frightening, it should been gag-inducing, as the magical explosions of seed rocked her frame.<br />
<br />
But she felt only pleasure and pride in being able to swallow such a <i>divine</i> monster. For that same magic was changing her even as it did him; power pumping straight into her core.<br />
<br />
And as Kevin&#39;s hands were wholly consumed by platinum and little, etched scales formed on their backs and spread up his forearms; as his cock became literally hard as metal yet still flexible as flesh, and silvery smoothness spread out over his now massive ballsack and loins, wiping away all his pubic hair; Diane felt her own body changing as it absorbed his power and made it her own.</p>
