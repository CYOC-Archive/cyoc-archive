<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I turned round as the hand rested on my slight shoulder.<br />
<br />
There behind me, with a broad but nervous grin on his face, was one of the younger guys I'd seen on a table by the platform.<br />
<br />
&quot;Er, hello lady. I really enjoyed your show, I hope you don't mind me bothering you,&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Surely not, young man,&quot; I drawled. This body really liked him. That scared me deep down, but I had no control. I involuntarily offered him by tiny hand. &quot;My name is Charlotte. Pleased to be meeting you.&quot;<br />
<br />
He touched me with his hand. His wrist seemed muscular, strong and was flecked with blond hairs against his tan. I loved the strength of his grip.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, pleased to meet you too. I'm Steve. I'm here with my buddies - it's Jamie's birthday - and just wondered if you had, erm, anything, you know, else you offered here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You might just be lucky, *Steve*,&quot; I said, emphasising his name, &quot; come with me.<br />
<br />
Still holding his hand I walked over to a giant of a man stood by the bar in a suit. <br />
<br />
&quot;Brad,&quot; I whispered to him, &quot;I'm going out back with this boy, he's got some buddies over by the platform. Tell them to follow, will you, darl?&quot;<br />
<br />
He nodded at me. Somehow I knew he knew how the drill worked in this place.<br />
<br />
&quot;You sure are a lucky boy, Steve.&quot; I smiled back at him.<br />
<br />
He just grinned. He was quite a looker. 5'11, 165 pounds and<br />
had a body defined by the workouts he had clearly been doing since junior high. His slight body fat made the muscles that he did have very defined. His smooth upper body and torso tapered down to form a perfect v-shape at his waist. He also had a perfect, round ass that stood poised atop his strong soccer jock legs. He had spiky, light<br />
brown hair and brown eyes. I'd go further with him than any other clients, I thought to myself. Boy, did this body need it to, it hadn't had any real loving with anyone I'd have found remotely attractive - rather than rough punters - for nearly twelve months. And it needed it. <br />
<br />
I lead him into this dingy room, cluttered with many husky fake-velvet dark sofas and dim lighting. It was full of cigarette smoke. I was shocked to find myself lighting up - I'd never smoked once as Roger, but I loved the kick it gave me.<br />
<br />
&quot;So your mates got cash?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;For you baby!&quot; Steve grinned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Take a seat then.&quot;<br />
<br />
Steve lounged against one of the sofas, showing off his pecs as he leant back in his half-unbuttoned white shirt. The nusic picked up again and I straddled his firm legs and began to sway my wide hips from side to side. I stretched forward, placing my slender and thin arms either side of his head on the back of the sofa. He just grinned at me. I lowered myself so my soft ass was on his knees. &quot;Really firm legs,&quot; I thought to myself.<br />
<br />
Then I became staggered at how raunchy this dance became. I was writhing literally all over him. At one point, as his five friends came in, complete with beers and Shelly, who must have finished, I had my feet up on the sofa either side of his waist as he slipped bills down my suspenders... at the same time my ass was grinding into his clearly hard crotch sending him crazy. I ripped off my bra/bikini top and starting massaging his face with my breasts. The sensation of his tongue on my nipple sent me crazy. I should have stopped him there, but his face was so gorgous, that grin so delightfully sexy and this body needed him. I kept gyrating for him, waving my butt in his face and, to be honest, toying with his body. Then I almost jumped off him, and as I saw the look of disappointment on his face grinned and winked at him.<br />
<br />
As two of the others received a typical backroom dance with Shelly I asked, in my fuck-me sex kitten voice, &quot;So who's the birthday boy?&quot;<br />
<br />
The boy I assume is Jamie put his hand up. I felt determined, to give him a dance which made Steve so jealous he'd have me. And that's what I did, as I spent ten minutes with Jamie's hands on my giant breasts seemingly non-stop. He was a good-looking and fit guy, but this body seemed to have its steam up for Steve and nobody else. Just before it was time for me to finish, I poured a test tube cocktail down Jamie's throat from between my tits and asked him for his cash. He stuffed $100 into my hand. That was enough for me to show him fun. In one movement I slipped and wriggled the tiny sports shorts which rested on my hips to the floor, and showed Jamie my pierced clitoris. Roger's mind, I could sense, went crazy at this - how much would I like to be back in my old body. I certainly hoped nothing would go to far - but in the body I was in all I could think of was Steve. I glanced over my shoulder and saw Steve with both hands in his pockets. Hey, hey, I grinned to myself!<br />
<br />
Placing Jamie's hands on my hips, I lowered myself onto the waist of his jeans and massaged his pecs. Then, in tune with the music I ground and ground and ground on his rock hard cock. It felt big, which excited me as I ground my own watering pussy down onto the outside of his trousers. He loved this, and as I pulled his head into my breasts he began to groan as he came in his pants. Steve and the other young guys, to the extent they weren't distracted by Shelly whooped and cheered him. My attentions turned to Steve.<br />
<br />
I limbered, naked, over to him. I could tell from the look in his eyes, his gorgeous eyes, that he was jealous. As Roger, I was again terrified but this body, its real mind and its urges were immune to any of my real thoughts. I was a prisoner to this whore.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, Stevie boy?&quot; I stood before him, grinning as he took in my curves. &quot;What am I worth to you?&quot; He silently just threw his wallet on the floor. Crouching, I grabbed it, and as I walked to him dropped it with my bag. I was going to enjoy this on so many levels.<br />
<br />
Steve looked nervous, which excited me even more. I could tell that so many previous clients thought they were gods and treated me like crap.<br />
<br />
&quot;Go on, Steve, Becki won't mind.&quot; one of his buddies whooped. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ah,&quot; I thought, &quot;so there's a girl.&quot; That excited me more. <br />
<br />
I set to work with a little dance again until I was really close. I just knew I was going to hate what happened next but this body would love it. I could feel the needs it had.<br />
<br />
Before long that big, strong hand was grasping one of my breasts, sending electric shocks through me, and I was acutely aware of something hard and quivering touching my jutting ass.  'Oh no!' I thought in desperation and somehow managed to think to myself, &quot;Get away from me, before you, before I-&quot;, I trailed off as Charlotte's body took over.<br />
<br />
&quot;You have a great body, Charlotte&quot; Steve said, if that was even his real name. I just ran my tongue over my full lips.<br />
<br />
He had started to draw away but then started fondling my tit again as his other hand grasped my hip. I reached down, unbuttoning his white shirt to reveal his perfectly chiseled pecs and washboard stomach and massaged the waistband of his boxers before unbuttoning his jeans. I rubbed his massive and very erect cock through the soft fabric of his boxers, and with my other hand, guided the small fingers over his jutting jaw and profound cheekbones. He really was gorgeous, but it was work too.<br />
<br />
Suddenly I felt the hard head of the cock probing between my buttocks and my mind went into shock.  I didn't think I was capable of moving, but my body had it's own agenda.  With a little grinding twist of the hips, I caused the head of the cock to nestle between my dripping pussy lips.<br />
<br />
'Oh my god!' I thought. 'I never touched it-' Then my world turned upside down as he rammed it home.  I screamed, but couldn't help bouncing my ass back into him as he pumped into me in long measured strokes.  Now I was unable to think of anything except the ecstasy of the hot meat plunging into me, over and over, even though deep in my consciousness I was again repulsed. After what seemed like no time at all we were slamming together frantically until we both shouted and he shot me full, just like all the others.<br />
<br />
I laid there for a moment, orgasmic shocks still shuddering through my body. Then I turned around and sat up on the sofa, legs across his stomach.  Steve lay back before me, grinning.<br />
<br />
I couldn't tear my eyes away from that monster cock that had just rocked my world.  I didn't really want to, but I knew part of the routine was to taste it.<br />
<br />
Struggling with my body, that I now recognized as my master, I grasped the cock and immediately wrapped my mouth around it and started sucking in earnest.  I realized that I wanted it to explode in my mouth more than anything in the world. This body really did need sex and really did want Steve.<br />
<br />
Steve groaned a few times, then with a visible effort pulled away from me.<br />
<br />
Slowly, I pushed myself down on his shaft, feeling it glide across my lipsticked lips. Mmmm, pure heaven! As amazing as it had been to kiss that swollen purple head, it was nothing compared to the pressure it put on the back of my throat. Like some starving animal, I gorged myself on dick, cramming inch after inch inside my mouth. I didn't do it with the wilful abandon many girls I'd fantasised had though. I did it mechanically, knowing just what was needed when. That was scary. It was hot, hard, and throbbing but it was so much more.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sssssllllooooorrrkkkkk . . .&quot; Sucking for all I was worth, I pulled slowly back and watched his wet shaft emerge from between my lips. Not only could I hear it escaping my hunger, but I could actually see it stretch as I tried to suck it from his body. Suddenly, it popped out into the cold air, falling down to slap me across the chin. I giggled, loving how it felt, and wrapped <br />
my hand around his shaft. <br />
<br />
&quot;You like that don't you my boy.&quot; Quickly, I kissed my way down, then closed my mouth around his balls as I stroked the cock above. He had his hands on the back of my long blonde hair, which tugged at my scalp. <br />
<br />
&quot;This is money's worth boys,&quot; he yelled. <br />
<br />
&quot;Holy fuck!&quot; Digging his hands into my hair, he yanked me even <br />
closer. The others laughed, then laughed even harder to see me blush. I was so excited it was turning EVERYBODY on.<br />
<br />
Not content to watch, Jamie leapt up from the couch to stand <br />
before me. Giving his mate a nudge, he said &quot;Let's see how the slut <br />
handles the two of us together.&quot;<br />
<br />
I stopped, but kept a very firm grip around Steve's manhood. <br />
<br />
&quot;Eh! This is still work. You owe me another $100 if you want anything, birthday or not.&quot;<br />
<br />
At that I felt a bill drop between my breasts. Roger's part of my mind felt full of horror.<br />
<br />
With that, Steve ripped his balls from my mouth and replaced them <br />
with his cock. A second later, Jamie hooked a fat finger inside my mouth, pulled my cheek open wide, and rammed his cock in too!<br />
<br />
Vaguely, I could feel a bit of pain, as if my lips were going to split, but couldn't care less. I knew what I was doing. I had two cocks fighting for space inside me, one testing the entrance to my <br />
throat while the other tried to poke a hole in my cheek -- and it was fantastic! <br />
<br />
Sucking and licking at them both, I reached up and began fondling their balls, using the hairy sacs to pull their dicks even deeper.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shit, I'm gonna cum, man!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait a sec!&quot; Quickly, the Jamie pulled back from my throat, preparing to paint my gums along with his bud. &quot;Just give me--&quot;<br />
<br />
Too late.<br />
<br />
Before Jamie could finish the sentence, Steve exploded yet again! There was no warning, nothing extra to feel, just a sudden geyser of white, hot sperm blasting inside me. At first, I flinched in surprise, but quickly recovered, ever the pro, to begin slurping what this body though of as wonderful nectar down. The part of me which was Roger was repulsed. By the time I'd swallowed his third spurt, a twin blast was spewing alongside it. There were two boys fucking my face, splitting my mouth wide with their dicks, and I <br />
had made them cum! The hot sticky mess pooling on my tongue was, with the stuffed notes by my bag, MY reward, my job. I was horrified.</p>
