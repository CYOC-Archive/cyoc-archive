<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Your sister. Shit. Could she see through the magic, and if so how could she? Would she ruin it? Tell everyone? Be cool, be cool.<br />
&quot;Oh hey Kate, weird seeing you out here, I was just coming out t-&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh shut up, I know you&#39;re allowed to be out here, silly. I was just messing with you.&quot; She said, interrupting you.<br />
Good, she doesn&#39;t know either.<br />
&quot;O-Oh yeah I knew that, I was just um... So why are &#120378;&#120368;&#120374; out here?&quot; you ask, trying to steer the conversation another way.<br />
&quot;HM? Oh I&#39;m just skipping, there&#39;s a substitute in math today.&quot; She says nonchalantly. You had forgotten in the confusion that you&#39;re sister was a bit of a slacker. She was also pretty well endowed for her age, though you&#39;d never let anyone else know you payed attention to that, especially on your sister. Being that you were both in 9th grade, she was surprisingly well built. She stands at a healthy 5&#39;6&quot;, with a decent amount of tone on her muscles from cheer leading in 8th grade. Her legs are nothing special, if only a little bit plump in the thigh region, but nothing special. Her butt was pretty toned and decently sized, especially for her age, having one of the best asses in the school, if you do say so yourself. Her breasts are modestly sized sitting at a mid B-cup, not the largest in the school, but certainly not the smallest. Her waist is toned and flat. Her arms are somewhat fit, and you doubt she has troubles in P.E. Her hair was decently long reaching down to the just below her shoulder blades, and mostly straight. Finally her face was what you considered to be one of her best features. She rarely wore makeup, not that she needs it. Her skin tans easily allowing her to not focus much on it, and her acne was almost non existent. Her skin looked smooth to the touch, though it&#39;s hard to tell seeing as you haven&#39;t gotten very many opportunities to touch her face. Wait a minute. This is an opportunity right now, you&#39;re sure you&#39;re allowed to.<br />
<br />
               Wow... it really was soft. And wow... she really didn&#39;t care that you were just touching her face.<br />
&quot;Why are you touching my face?&quot; She asks, confused.<br />
&quot;Umm... I felt like it?&quot; you say, rather unsure. I suppose she does care, she just won&#39;t stop you.<br />
&quot;Okay? Can you please stop?&quot; she asks, slightly irritated. Eh what the hell you&#39;re feeling brave right now.<br />
&quot;No.&quot; You say assertively.<br />
&quot;Fine&quot; she says, giving up. Wow, that worked well. You really did like the way your sister looked, not necessarily in an explicitly sexual way, you just thought she was attractive for her age. You just wish her breasts were a little bigger, being the most lacking thing in your opinion, though you had always liked bigger chested girls. You suppose there isn&#39;t much you could do about it though. Realizing you&#39;re still touching her face, and it&#39;s probably getting rather annoying to her, you decide to stop and move onto something else, her breasts. You had never touched a boob before. You had gotten real close before but than your sister came into the room while you were with your girlfriend. You never got another chance unfortunately as she left you shortly afterwards. You saw it as only fitting that the girl who ruined your chance to touch a boob would now be your chance to touch a boob, even if she just so happened to be your sister. you slowly move your hands down and, hearing no objections from your sister, you decide to touch them. While they felt nice, it was nothing compared to the feeling of triumph at finally having this opportunity. Your sister seemed uncomfortable, looking around to make sure she wasn&#39;t being made fun of but otherwise she continued to talk to you like nothing was happening. <br />
&quot;A little eager don&#39;t you think?&quot; she said, wincing slightly at your rough handling of her tits.<br />
&quot;Sorry, I&#39;ve never done this before.&quot; you reply, slightly embarrassed.<br />
&quot;Yeah, clearly. It&#39;s fine just be more gentle please. I don&#39;t want to be sore later.&quot; You decide to go a little more carefully.<br />
&quot;You know what would be even better than touching them? Seeing them. Do you mind?&quot; you ask, timidly.<br />
&quot;Not that much just make it quick the period is gonna end in a few minutes.&quot; she says. After struggling for several seconds to remove her bra, you are forced to ask for assistance. She does so begrudgingly, and you get a nice good look at them. While you never thought you would be this intimate with your sister, you are certainly enjoying yourself. Her nipples aren&#39;t small, just smaller than you thought they&#39;d be for some odd reason. Wait a moment were her breasts... bigger? <br />
&quot;Hey Kate, what&#39;s your cup size?&quot; you ask, confused.<br />
&quot;C-cup, why do you ask?&quot;<br />
&quot;Didn&#39;t you say that you were a B-cup like a week ago?&quot;<br />
&quot;No? I haven&#39;t been a B-cup in months.&quot; she says.<br />
Wait, hadn&#39;t you just wished that her breasts were bigger? Had... had you made her breasts grow?<br />
&quot;I wish you had D-cup breasts.&quot; you say, ready for nothing to happen. However right in front of your eyes, and right in your hands, her breasts grew a considerable amount. &quot;Hey Kate what cup size are you again?&quot;<br />
&quot;I just told you I&#39;m a D-cup, gees you don&#39;t listen sometimes.&quot; she says, slightly annoyed. You are dumbfounded. Can you make wishes as well as do anything you want? All because of this emblem on your hand. Best day ever. You snap out of your thoughts and realize your sister is attempting to get your attention. &quot;Jim... JIM! I really need to get to class man, the bell rang like 2 minutes ago. I really don&#39;t think I can be late again to science, can we please wrap this up?&quot;<br />
&quot;What? Oh, yeah, sure. Sorry.&quot; Your sister starts gathering up her stuff again, but when she reaches to grab her bra you pull it away. &quot;Actually, I think I&#39;ll keep this, it&#39;s too small for you anyway.&quot;<br />
&quot;Fine, I&#39;ll just walk around with back pain all day. These things aren&#39;t light y&#39;know.&quot; she says.<br />
&quot;That&#39;s tough luck I want it. You should get to class though, you&#39;re almost late. You should run if you don&#39;t mind me saying.&quot; She begins to walk away and then lightly jog, uttering &#39;dammit&#39; under her breath. As you watch her leave her newer bigger breasts are flopping everywhere without proper support. <br />
<br />
               You have so much more power than you initially thought. Oh this will be so fun to test the limits of what you can do. But just where are you going to go next. You decide to...</p>
