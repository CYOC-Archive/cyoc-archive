Francis Twist was sitting in he office, doing some paper work when she got a phone call. She was a little surprised to see it was Maggie Lawson calling her. Normal she called Samantha if she needed to tell them anything.<br />
<br />
“Maggie, hello. What can I do for you?” Francis asked. <br />
<br />
“I hope I haven’t caught you at a bad time.” Maggie said.<br />
<br />
“No, not at all. I don’t have any appointments until this afternoon. What’s up? Is Spencer alright?”<br />
<br />
“Physically she’s on the mend. But I wanted to talk more about some of the things she might be keeping bottled up inside.”<br />
<br />
“Oh?” Francis sat forward in her chair. She wasn’t expecting Maggie to reach out. Spencer had seemed pretty good, all things considered, from her perspective. But then, Francis didn’t have the whole story. <br />
<br />
“I’m not sure how much you know, about Spencer and Jeremy’s history together.” Maggie began.<br />
<br />
“Only that they used to date, and at some point Jeremy got aggressive with her. What else should I know, if she’s going to be a patient that is.”<br />
<br />
“Oh she is. I think we’ve put this off for far too long as it is.” Maggie said.<br />
<br />
“Would you prefer to do this in person? Again, I don’t have any appointments right now. Can you get away from the hospital?”<br />
<br />
“Sure, where’s your office?” <br />
<br />
Francis gave Maggie her address, and Maggie said she could be there in about fifteen minutes. Francis altered her secretary Rudy she’d be expecting Maggie. Francis couldn’t deny she was interested in what Maggie was going to say. It was clear her mother was worried about her daughter. Evan, the more protective and strict of the two parents, hadn’t seemed that concerned. Or maybe he was.<br />
<br />
-----------------------------<br />
<br />
“Nice office.” Maggie said when she arrived. <br />
<br />
“Thanks. Samantha did most of the designing, apparently I have as much taste as her father.” Francis said. The two women sat on the small couch Francis had positioned near the large window. The whole atmosphere of the room was very relaxed and informal. The small area that did look “professional” was just Francis’ desk.<br />
<br />
“So, is Evan also worried about Spencer? Or rather, her mental health?” Francis asked. <br />
<br />
“Both Evan and Spencer are alike in that sense. Neither of them like talking about their feelings.”<br />
<br />
“Then he doesn’t know you’re planning on bringing Spencer here?”<br />
<br />
“I’ll tell him, but he’ll just say I’m overreacting and that as long as Spencer doesn’t spend her nights crying herself to sleep she’ll be fine.”<br />
<br />
“One of the downfalls to being in the military. They tend to encourage their enlisted men and women to repress their feelings. All for the sake of creating better soldiers. And unfortunately it would appear that Spencer’s inherited that from her father.” Francis sighed. <br />
<br />
“Again, one of the reasons I think she needs to talk to someone. Evan’s dealt with his demons in his own way, but I don’t think his methods will work for Spencer. As much as she hates to admit it, she’s more like Evan than she thinks. Which is why they’re at each other’s throats are often than not.” <br />
<br />
“What exactly are we talking about? The recent fight, or her relationship with her father?” Francis asked.<br />
<br />
“Neither. I’m more concerned about what happened back in Virginia.” Maggie said. <br />
<br />
“Some form of abuse I’m given to understand.” <br />
<br />
“That’s an understatement of the greatest kind.” Maggie said. With some difficulty, she told Francis the events that unfolded while Spencer and Jeremy were together. Almost six months of hell for Spencer, which ended with her taking a bite out of Jeremy’s skull two nights ago. Francis was diligently taking notes the entire time. <br />
<br />
“And Spencer hasn’t spoken to anyone about what happened to her? No one?” Francis said. <br />
<br />
“As far as I’m aware, she’s kept everything silent.”<br />
<br />
“You said Evan told Eric what happened…”<br />
<br />
“Actually he just gave Eric a copy of the case file. I’m not sure how much Eric’s read. It’s safe to say it’s a pretty explicit read.” Maggie said.<br />
<br />
“And how. I may just ask to speak to Eric, maybe try to get him to share the information. You wouldn’t mind would you?”<br />
<br />
“No. As long as the information stays secret. I really doubt Eric would say anything to anyone. But you never know. There was a time I actually liked Jeremy.”<br />
<br />
“And I used to like boys.” Francis joked. She and Maggie laughed, lightening the mood after Maggie’s story brought them both close to tears. Maggie because it pained her to know she let those horrible things happen to Spencer. Francis because she hadn’t realized how severe the abuse was between Jeremy and Spencer. <br />
<br />
She really did wonder how Spencer kept on going like nothing had happened. Some of the anger she must have been suppressing was probably released when she and Jeremy fought. But that couldn’t have given her any sense of closer. <br />
<br />
“When will Spencer be released from the hospital?” Francis asked. <br />
<br />
“It depends. Latests would be Wednesday afternoon. We’re keeping her overnight, her ulna has some new hairline fractures from changing. It’s just a precaution in case they get worse. In all likelihood she’ll be sent home for Thanksgiving.”<br />
<br />
“I can start seeing her the Monday after if that works.”<br />
<br />
“It works.” Maggie said.<br />
<br />
“But first I have to figure out a way to get her here. Evan and I both work. And Elle’s busy studying for her midterms, and Jonathan’s not the most responsible person in the world. Which leaves…” Maggie thought. <br />
<br />
“Maggie?” Francis asked, noticing Maggie’s eyes had gone a bit distant. <br />
<br />
“Oh sorry. Listen, I’m going to ask Eric if he’d go with her on Monday. If you want I can ask him to bring the files with him.”<br />
<br />
“Sure. You don’t think Spencer would mind his being here?”<br />
<br />
“He’s gotten her to open up to him in ways she’s never opened up to me or Evan. I think it’ll be good if he’s there for support.” Maggie said.<br />
<br />
Francis couldn’t agree more. Eric really cared about Spencer’s well being. And though Spencer did hide her emotions most of the time, the fact she was apparently infatuated with him hadn’t gone unnoticed.</p>
