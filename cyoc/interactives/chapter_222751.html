<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Antonio groaned as he was risen from the inky blackness of sleep, the high pitch sound of a steam whistle ripping through the air, Antonio jolted upward at the shrill sound, before falling back to the feeling of a soft surface against the back of his head as the room seemed to jolt forward.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck, my head is pounding&quot; he groaned as he pressed his palms against his temples before he stopped at the feeling of a soft pair of gentle hands caressing his head replaced his own &quot;I&#39;m not surprised sir, you came crashing through our roof, madam Rosewood was furious&quot; a gentle voice spoke, opening his eyes Antonio was greeted to the site of a shining chandelier rattling above, it&#39;s light dancing across a bright red roof, but then there was the sea green eyes that looked down at him.<br />
<br />
Antonio was up like a shot as he backed away from this mysterious person, before staggering back and landing in a soft cushioned chair, staring at the woman who sat on her knees on the dark green and yellow carpet Antonio has moments ago been laying on.<br />
She was slender in build creamy white skin, sea green eyes and a modest blush like glow in her cheeks, her lips were full and crimson red, long dark eyelashes above her eyes, short curly blonde hair that was styled to hold itself up, what looked like a brow flat cap you&#39;d see on a train driver on her head, it&#39;s solid black flap shadowing one side of her face, she wore a button up blouse that extended up her neck with a small frilly collar below her chin, a pair of goggles hanging from her neck, the buttons undone towards her chest, creating a perfect window into her impressive cleavage she wore a corset around her waist, straps over her shoulders holding it in place, it&#39;s beige color seeming to blend with the cream colored blouse, shoulders that poofed out into thin form fitting sleeves.<br />
<br />
With her still on the floor he had a perfect view of her legs, smooth and toned, like she regularly ran, her skirt shaped in a V shape, highest at her beltline, letting him glimpse her frilly white lingerie underwear , her brown skirt was ruffled all the way along it&#39;s edge, with straps on the inside and outside of her legs, holding black stockings up as she wore knee high steel cap boots.<br />
<br />
She looked up at him with a confused look &quot;sir you seem to be just fine for someone I surely thought would be dead, no one could survive a fall like that&quot; she said jesturing to the gaping hole leading to the floors above as she stood up, brushing her skirt off.<br />
Antonio unsteadily walked under the hole, smog covered sunlight beaming through from above, the outside clearly visible, and moving?<br />
<br />
Just as he was about to ask this strange girl what was going on the sound of a heavy slam against wood made Antonio jump to see a large muscular man standing behind a bar, bottle after bottle of various alcoholic beverages lined behind him, a steely look on his face, a large scar over his left eye, leaving the eyeball a milky white, stubble covered his jawline, a beaten up flat cap on his dark brown hair, he picked up another shot glass and began polishing it, each twist of the cloth flexing his muscles, the black shirt that he had rolled up to his elbows straining to keep his form contained, his collar unbuttoned but still folded neatly, he wore a blue tartan patterned overcoat, it seemed he kept this item of clothing in pristine condition, a pocket watch stowed away in a pocket on his chest, its chain dangling down before hooking onto the pockets lip, he snarled at Antonio as he eyed the watch, causing him to back away slightly.<br />
<br />
The large man gave a sigh, then as he straightened himself up he beckoned Antonio over, hesitantly Antonio took a seat at the bar, finding the round red padded stools to be quite comfortable, the blonde woman did the same, leaning an elbow on the bar and pressing her palm into her cheek, looking at Antonio<br />
&quot;What will it be stranger?&quot; The man&#39;s gruff voice sounded, a thick Russian accent seeping through with every word, Antonio looked through the bottles on the wall before groaning, holding his head &quot;ugh, a whiskey would be a godsent right now&quot; he groaned, putting his head to the table.<br />
<br />
The barkeeper grunted and got to work selecting a bottle and glass<br />
&quot;You still haven&#39;t answered my question&quot; the woman asked, Antonio looked up at her in annoyance, he didn&#39;t even know this woman, why was she trying to pry?<br />
&quot;How did you survive a fall like that sir?&quot; She repeated, Antonio let out a sigh as he leaned back, holding the bar rail for support letting out a sigh of relief before looking the blonde woman in the eye &quot;I guess....i was just lucky, better to count my stars than question how I survived, I&#39;m sat here and that&#39;s what matters to me&quot; he said with a groan, sighing in satisfaction as the barkeeper slid a shot glass of whiskey into his hand, raising the glass in thanks to the man he threw his head back, downing the drink in one before landing the glass back on the bar<br />
&quot;Ahhhhh, thank you barkeep, that&#39;s just what I needed&quot; he said before he stood from the bar<br />
&quot;Where you think your going&quot; the barkeeper growled, reaching over and holding Antonio down by the shoulder<br />
&quot;You wait for Madam Rosewood, you brake roof, you pay or you fix&quot; he said firmly, squeezing his grip painfully tight on Antonio&#39;s shoulder<br />
&quot;Hey hey easy big guy, I think she&#39;ll want to see him all in one piece&quot; the blonde said.<br />
<br />
The mountain of a man paused for a moment, looking into her eyes before grunting and let Antonio go, turning his back on both of them to resume cleaning glasses<br />
&quot;You&#39;ll have to forgive Hector, he can be a bit....strong handed at times&quot; she said, giving Antonio a small apologetic smile, just as he was about to open his mouth, the sound of a door slamming from the floor above sounded through the building<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t care who he is, whoever wrecked my place better have his good graces with the big man, BECAUSE HE&#39;S ABOUT TO MEET HIM&quot; Came a loud female voice, accompanied by angry thundering footsteps, looking over at the blonde woman Antonio gave her a look of confused and panic<br />
She sighed and lay her head on the table &quot;Hector, I&#39;m gonna need a drink myself&quot; she said in a muffled voice, the large barkeeper grunted in acknowledgement<br />
&quot;Well then sir, I&#39;d like to introduce to you, the owner of our fine establishment Madam Rosewood&quot; she said as she gestured  to the woman who came charging down the stairs behind them.</p>
