<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The cake was delicious and the dinos were good company. As Ty began to relax once again, he found himself laughing at Not Mark&#39;s primitive and downright dim new personality and Darcy&#39;s big heart. Although when he looked to Juno, the powerful goddess raptor&#39;s eyes strayed from his own and avoided him.<br />
<br />
Eventually, their bellies full and lethargy setting in after an emotional and stressful reintroduction, Ty found himself sitting at the table with Juno while the other boys tried to figure out the TV remote.<br />
<br />
&quot;Give me!&quot; Not Mark hissed in the background, sharply, grabbing the device from a crouched down Darcy. &quot;Old me know how use good!&quot;<br />
<br />
Channels began to flip in the living room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you truly desire for your birthday wish to come true?&quot; Juno whispered, staring at Ty directly with her piercing gaze.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes.&quot; The human gulped.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nmmh.&quot; She nodded, looking back into the living room. &quot;These two seem occupied.&quot; The raptoress rose from her chair gracefully, fluttering her downy feathers, and turned to the other two saurians.<br />
<br />
&quot;We are not to be disturbed.&quot; She commanded. &quot;No matter what.&quot;<br />
<br />
The male raptor and the huge stegosaur turned their attention away from a football game and nodded in unison.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come along.&quot; Juno waved up the stairs. &quot;I should like to speak with you in private now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;S-Sure.&quot; Ty nodded meekly, following the lady raptor up the stairs and trying not to observe the new tight curvature of her feathery ass or the sensual sway of her long powerful tail.<br />
<br />
-<br />
<br />
The two sat next to each other awkwardly on Ty&#39;s bed, avoiding eye contact. The raptor sighed heavily and looked down at the top of Ty&#39;s head while he stared at the floor.<br />
<br />
&quot;So.&quot; Juno said sadly. &quot;Here we again in the place where you made me a woman. All I can think of is how you tried to unmake me. Every step of my mind fracturing and dwindling away from me is fresh. How you stared at me with such disdain, such annoyance.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry.&quot; Ty cracked, putting his head in his hands.<br />
<br />
A pointed claw touched Ty&#39;s chin and raised his head up gently to stare at the feathered raptor. &quot;I know.&quot; She whispered in reply, gently. Her eyes softened. &quot;Yet the trust you violated has yet to recover. How can I be certain that you will not grow bored of my companionship and attempt to destroy me again? At the first sign of difficulty, the first inconvenience, can I depend on you to be there when I need you? My master? My lover? My friend? My caretaker?&quot; She paused and suddenly looked immensely tired, her facial features falling in sadness. &quot;My mate?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I-I don&#39;t know.&quot; Ty admitted, looking down again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah.&quot; She turned away, somewhat hurt. &quot;Perhaps not the answer I was expecting, but your honesty is appreciated.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Does...&quot; Ty gulped. &quot;Does she live in you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Her?&quot; Juno quickly turned, snorting derisively. &quot;Hmm, no. No, she is but a distant and unfortunate part of my past now. An idea more than a personality. As intangible and unreal as an old story. Yet a fundamental base of who I am and who I will be. It is difficult to describe the amalgamation of my selves.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Can you try?&quot; Ty looked up, curious.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can.&quot; She smiled slightly, appreciating his interest. &quot;Imagine that you are you. In fact, for the purposes of this explanation, there are three of you. Now, all of you are independant of each other, of course. You exist with your own distinct personalities, thoughts, feelings, and consciousness. Each of those people is then melted down and placed into one whole. No longer are they independant. They become one. I am still the beast that you intended me to be. I will always be primal, sexual, and primitive. That is what I truly am.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty seemed to grow a little excited, to which the raptor let break the first toothy grin since their reconciliation.<br />
<br />
&quot;This arouses you, does it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So... is the beast in control?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ahhh!&quot; The raptoress raised a clawed finger into the air and crossed her legs up onto the bed, chuckling slightly. &quot;No! Because of my integration of the old and new, the beast mixed with the human I used to be to produce something new. Thus, Juno.&quot; She waved her hands over herself. &quot;As I said, the old and new combined. A perfect contradiction.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Can... can you suppress June? Remove her completely?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then what would I be?&quot; Juno shrugged, snorting. &quot;If I lose her memories and experiences, it fundamentally changes my knowledge, my intelligence, my experiences, and my very personality changes. Perhaps I become more beast again than woman. Perhaps my mind and my comprehension of the human world decreases. I lose many abilities I have yet to explore. The memories, even, though painful, are useful to me. They inform my new self. It concerns me that you ask if I can change my core.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m only asking out of curiosity.&quot; Ty gulped, backtracking quickly. &quot;I don&#39;t want you to be somebody else.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nor can you force me to be.&quot; The raptor smirked. &quot;I still retain complete control over my form, my destiny, and my self. You may not have that control of me again. What say you to that... master?&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty chuckled weakly now, nodding, and put his hands on his lap nervously. &quot;You&#39;re probably right to prevent that kind of control.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t have to be.&quot; She said sweetly, lowering her voice to a whisper. &quot;In total honesty, the horny little dinosaur inside of me wants become small and vulnerable again. She wants you to grab her tail, pull it up, and put your dick in her. She wants you to change her, to twist her flesh, to own her completely.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty began to sweat again, turning a deep shade of red.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you not want that too?&quot; The giant raptor woman leaned in, putting a massive bicep and tightly corded forearm around Ty&#39;s back. &quot;Do you not wish me to be the small cute raptor woman again?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I-I do...&quot; Ty blushed, reaching up and gripping the trunk of the dinosaur&#39;s huge forearm, rubbing her scaly fingers and marvelling at the glossy finish of her skin.<br />
<br />
&quot;I want you to force me up against a wall and take me.&quot; She hissed sharply. &quot;I want to wake up in the morning to you parting my legs and fucking me. I want your hands to hold mine down as you roughly penetrate me. I want to be yours.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Me too.&quot; Ty whimpered, feeling his young cock jolt.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t allow you to.&quot; She suddenly sighed, drawing away, looking slouched and small despite her great size and strength. &quot;That is the trust you&#39;ve taken from me. I need it to return.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then... what about your idea?&quot; Ty looked up excitedly. &quot;You said you had an idea?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah.&quot; She nodded slowly, closing her eyes. She clacked her jaws twice and then opened them, playfully. Mischieviously. &quot;Then you seek to regain my favor, do you? You&#39;ll have to give me something in return if you want to earn my trust back. No words, as these, will do. Not even actions or demonstrations of devotion will fix what has been broken.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then what can I do?&quot; Ty put his hand on her side, desperate. &quot;What can I do to fix this? To win you back?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If I tell you, you&#39;ll think me mad. So suffice to say we must have mutual trust and understanding.&quot; The raptor&#39;s eyes twinkled. &quot;I believe that to reach that understanding... we must become one.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;One?&quot; Ty gulped. &quot;One mind. One soul. One essence. We must become part of one another for a time and see what the other sees. Think what the other thinks. Feel what the other feels. We are, after all, Gods among mortals. Or... perhaps demigods. I know not our true nature. Regardless, that is my offer.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Y-You want us to merge? To... to... amalgamate, as you said?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmmmnh.&quot; The raptor cooed playfully. &quot;After a fashion. It is difficult to describe the experience I have in mind. But... I cannot say more.&quot; She chuckled, heavy chest rising and falling quickly. &quot;You will certainly understand.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine.&quot; Ty blushed. &quot;Whatever you want to do to me, I will do it willingly.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh?&quot; The raptor turned suddenly, brightening. Her feathers fluffed for a moment and she raised an eye ridge. &quot;Well... that&#39;s a start, is it not?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re... I want to know you. All of you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And I you.&quot; The raptor said sweetly, cupping Ty&#39;s chin in her hand. &quot;So let me have my fun, and we&#39;ll move forward.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine, fine!&quot; Ty beamed, nodding quickly. Agreeably. &quot;I owe you that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;First, let me change into something cuter for the occasion.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty watched breathlessly as the great big raptor woman suddenly twinged and arched her back. &quot;Oh, it already feels so fucking good.&quot; She moaned her enjoyment, voice raising slightly, as she began to shrink down. Her bulging hard muscle began to soften and deflate as her stretched height and stature began to reduce. In moments, she was feet shorter and still going down. It was then, to his delight, that Ty noticed what was happening. She was growing more attractive, slimmer, cuter. More feminine. Her curves were increasing, her hard packed breasts were softening and growing, her waist slimming, her hips rounding. The curvature of her ass began to round. Her feathers gained a sheen. Even her eyes seemed to widen.<br />
<br />
Ty gasped in amazement as he stared at a youthful and truly adorable dinosaur woman, reduced to her &#39;natural&#39; four foot height with many improvements and accents.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you think?&quot; She said sweetly, her voice raised, melodious, feminine. Playful. &quot;You do like me as the small, lean, busty raptor woman you created, don&#39;t you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ve... you&#39;ve definitely improved the design.&quot; He gasped, staring at the large plump breasts hidden under her fine coating of feathers. She was even more colorful, her reds ranging from orange to azure and her blues softening into aqua an turquoise. The light reflected off her feathers in the strangest way, giving her a sheen, a glow, that made her even more beautiful. This was to say nothing of her curves, her proportions, or even her short and sweet new height, her torso sitting on top of long curvaceous feminine legs.<br />
<br />
She saw him looking over her new body and growled her approval, jaws snapping. &quot;Oh, that&#39;s not all I&#39;ve improved. You&#39;ll find my pussy tight, wet, slippery. Virginal. It will stay that way forever. I&#39;ll always be tight, always eagerly lubricated, always ready to be mounted. You can have my body and pleasure whenever you desire. Which suits me... just fine.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty stared the raptor in the eyes and they shared a rekindling of their lust. Ty&#39;s face was hot and sweaty. The bulge in his pants was raised and throbbing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Kiss me.&quot; She insisted. &quot;Please. Let&#39;s... reconnect.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m so sorry I tried to unmake you.&quot; Ty breathed, grabbing the raptor&#39;s head in his hands and jerking her forward. She whimpered in response, hand falling down to her cunt, and began to masturbate as the human&#39;s lips touched her scaly own. They embraced, Juno eagerly fingering herself, as Ty caressed her body and ran his fingers through her gorgeous plumage. She softened herself for him, preening by sheer will.<br />
<br />
Lost in passion and delicious arousal, Ty slipped his tongue into her mouth, the raptor snapping at his tongue gently and sucking it between her deadly teeth. Ty moaned into her mouth.<br />
<br />
She opened her eyes, seeing him lost and distracted in lust... and with a wicked grin upturning on her maw... she began to shrink him down. She was hungry, after all.<br />
<br />
Ty was so unaware of what was happening, so turned on that the tingling felt normal, that by the time he realized he was having to crane his head up to continue making out with Juno, he was already a few inches shorter. He opened his eyes to find her massive again.<br />
<br />
&quot;D-Did you grow yourself again?&quot; Ty blinked, looking up in shock, seeing her lower jaw filling his hand, having to reach up to maintain his grip on her shoulder.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, silly master.&quot; Juno looked down, giggling, blinking alluring dark lashes. &quot;Everything is the same as it was.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah...&quot; Ty looked down at himself, saw his sagging clothing, and gulped. &quot;Oh... oh my God.&quot; He began to squirm in nervousness.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mmm, you&#39;re helpless.&quot; She moaned, grinning from ear hole to ear hole. &quot;Look at you! Smaller and smaller.&quot;<br />
<br />
She grabbed Ty&#39;s shirt, yanked it off his tiny frame, and tossed it away. &quot;Why... you&#39;re getting so cute. And tiny!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;J-Juno!&quot; Ty squeaked, his voice raising like he was slowly sucking in helium. &quot;W-Wait, what are you... what does this have to do with anything?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ll see.&quot; She said sweetly, lying on her side and swinging her legs over the bed, tail swaying in excitement, as Ty got smaller and smaller in front of her. She giggled sweetly, touched his head, and followed his reduction down with her palm.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, almost there!&quot; She smiled. &quot;Just cuter and cuter by the second!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This... this is kind of scary!&quot; Ty squeaked, sitting in oversized underwear with a now flaccid dick.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s the matter, master?&quot; She giggled. &quot;Do you not like having your body manipulated against your will?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;O-Okay...&quot; Ty blushed nervously, barely over two feet tall and still going down in size. &quot;Y-You&#39;ve made your point.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But we haven&#39;t even come to the real fun, have we my darling little master?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;J-Juno...&quot; Ty gulped, seeing her giant hand reaching for him, the crevices and sharp points of her claws becoming clearer as Ty&#39;s point of view lowered. &quot;W-Wait!&quot; He squeaked, becoming 12&quot; tall as she grabbed him around the waist and extracted him from his clothing, holding him up for inspection as he grabbed the top of her hand and kicked frantically, terrified.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ohhh, so cute.&quot; She grinned, chuckling, knowing what was coming. &quot;Why... you look cute enough I could just eat you all up!&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty suddenly went limp and turned pale in her grasp as she raised the human to her now massive jaws and licked her lips pointedly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Juno!&quot; Ty screamed, now little more than six inches tall and still shrinking. &quot;No, please! Don&#39;t!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Did you give me a choice?&quot; She asked, cocking her head. Her expression hardened. &quot;No. But don&#39;t worry, master. No permenant harm will come to you. Quite the opposite. When we&#39;re through, you&#39;ll understand. So, for now...&quot;<br />
<br />
She giggled as Ty relaxed somewhat.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re going to get to know me from the inside out.&quot; With a sweet giggle at her perfect pun, the raptor opened her jaws, took four inch Ty in her hand... and plopped him onto her tongue delicately.<br />
<br />
Ty laid on the raptor girl&#39;s wet and abrasively textured tongue and held on tight, hugging the giant mandible as her jaws slowly shut around him. He heard the slap of saliva somewhere and the stirring of flesh as it went scarily dark. He began to tremble, hearing hot breath flowing back and forth through her nasal cavity above him, and the liquid pulsations of something behind him. He cringed in terror and realized. Her throat. She swallowed suddenly, a powerful gulping pull, and he tried not to freak out. No permenant harm... inside out. Eat him up. My God, what was she doing?!<br />
<br />
As if to answer the question, Juno&#39;s voice echoed around him, her tongue swaying unconsciously and throwing Ty around as he jaws parted and closed, lips vibrating outside her maw. &quot;Ave yough figuhured it oggg yeggg?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;DON&#39;T EAT ME!&quot; Ty screamed, terrified, wrestling with the dinosaur&#39;s giant tongue. Her jaws parted again, and to his relief Ty saw a giant finger slip into her maw. He reached for it frantically, desperately grabbing at her clawtip and slipping with the saliva now coating his tiny naked body.<br />
<br />
Juno reached in, extracted Ty between her thumb and finger, and held him up. He was clinging to her finger shaking in pure horror.<br />
<br />
&quot;Masterrrr.&quot; She consoled mockingly. &quot;I said I would not harm you permenantly. Now be a good little human and take your punishment. For the both of us. Please? I promise there&#39;s a surprise waiting at the end of the journey.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The end?&quot; Ty gasped, panting in horror. &quot;You... you mean your stomach?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Some digestion will occur, yes. But after that, you&#39;ll see.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;JUNO!&quot; Ty screamed. &quot;NO! PLEASE! I-I&#39;M SORRY! I&#39;M SORRY! I&#39;M SORRY I&#39;M SORRY I&#39;MSORRYI&#39;MSORRY!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Now, now, master.&quot; She giggled again. &quot;Don&#39;t be afraid. This will be fun! Down the hatch!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;NO!&quot; Ty screamed, clutching her giant fingers with everything she had as she raised her arm, looked up, and parted her jaws wide. Ty stared down with tears streaming down his face as he looked at what was waiting for him below in the literal jaws of death. The dinosaur opened her fingers, causing Ty to slip, and her eyes were locked into waiting anticipation as she flicked him off her claw. Ty fell, kicking and screaming, for what seemed like forever, until with a wet slap he hit the back of her jaws and kicked desperately, only serving to push himself toward her throat. He fell past the back of her tongue, unable to grab on to her flesh, and with absolute stomach sinking terror he slid down her throat, feebly attemping to grab at her uvula.<br />
<br />
Outside, Juno began to pant through her nose as she felt her tiny helpless creator as a lump at the back of her throat. He was sitting on top of a powerful ring of muscle... all she had to do was swallow and he would be gone. With a happy sigh, Juno gulped hard, swishing some of her saliva down too. She felt the vibrations and the squirming panic as Ty slid down. She touched under her chin and rubbed her neck, massaging the area, and gasped as she felt him pass deep inside of her.<br />
<br />
-<br />
<br />
Ty screamed all the way down as he was engulfed in a closed in tube of dark red and plunged down Juno&#39;s throat in helpless and complete terror. There was nothing to hold, nothing to stop, the natural sliminess of the passage was designed to speed him down to the end.<br />
<br />
The end.<br />
<br />
Ty let out a final scream as a ring of muscular flesh opened beneath him and he slipped down a hole... into her stomach. He smelt the acid the moment he crossed the threshold, knowing his imminant death was about to arrive. He closed his eyes, took a breath, and felt a sudden sting as he splashed into the pool beneath him. It was nearly instantaneous. Flesh seared for only seconds before he went numb, his tiny form engulfed in sizzling stomach acid and dissolving so quickly that he didn&#39;t even feel the pain of dying. Complete and utter blackness took him.<br />
<br />
-<br />
<br />
Outside, Juno felt it. The movement inside of her stopped suddenly. She stared down at her tight belly with wide eyes and touched it through her feathers. He was gone. A cold chill went down her back. The method was surely quick and painless. Now he would begin to nourish her... to become a part of her. Now the real fun could begin...</p>
