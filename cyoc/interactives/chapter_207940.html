<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“First thing’s first.” Finn smirked as he watched Jeff leave, enjoying the sway of his boyfriend’s beautiful ass.<br />
<br />
There was no way he was giving up the jock. He started typing “Jeff lets me wear his jock whenever I workout” and hit enter. He adjusted himself sensuously, feeling the jockstrap attempt to absorb the enormous load. Cum dripped from the bottom of the jock. Then he pulled up his shorts and walked back out into the gym, smelling like a barn.<br />
<br />
He helped Jeff lift and enjoyed watching his boyfriend’s eyes cross and muzzle twitch when he smelled the ram’s moist groin. The ram made sure to position himself so Jeff had no choice but to sniff his cumfunk. The tiger’s workout shorts tented and his reps improved, raising his head and suckling on the ram’s cock through his shorts. <br />
<br />
Finn knew they were getting looks and saw yet another man giving them the same glances the new jockstrap had. Young, a bit skinny, definitely not Finn’s type. His lips curled into a devilish smile. Maybe this guy could be something else. Rubber scuff caps for his hooves?<br />
<br />
“Hit the leg machine, I gotta piss.” Finn told Jeff.<br />
<br />
The tiger raised a brow and glanced at the skinny man who was staring at them. <br />
<br />
“Oh? Do you want to help him get fit?”<br />
<br />
&quot;Fit? What&#39;s the matter with you?&quot; Finn glared at the muscular white tiger. “Why are you so interested in making me jealous?”<br />
<br />
“Jealous? Finn you don&#39;t actually think…?” Jeff paused, looking puzzled. “What’s wrong with you? Aren’t you interested in turning the world into eye candy?”<br />
<br />
“No!” Finn snarled, slamming a hoof on the workout bench. “Fucking stop it, Jeff!”<br />
<br />
Jeff stared at him, a sudden fear in his eyes, and then trained his face smiled. “Okay big ram, maybe you need to cool off.”<br />
<br />
“Cool off? When you’re the one being a slut?” Finn growled. “Knock it the fuck off. You’re either dating me or you aren’t. First it was Todd, and then this random fucker in the gym-”<br />
<br />
“Who? But Todd was just...” Jeff blinked, then his eyes widened. “Finn, don’t tell me…”<br />
<br />
“Oh, stow your patronizing, I know you changed me into this. Don&#39;t act so self-righteous.” Finn snorted and grabbed a towel. “Now I’m going to have to go deal with yet another of your floozies while you pump those muscles, honey.”<br />
<br />
Jeff shivered as the ram walked away, his cock completely soft. What had he done?  Why was Finn so insanely jealous of other men? That was the entire fucking point of being handsome and muscular-you got looks. This couldn&#39;t go on. But how could he fix it? He watched the skinny guy glance at him and then follow the ram into the bathroom. There was definitely lust in those eyes.<br />
<br />
Maybe he could make the ram less jealous? Jeff pulled out his phone and wrote ‘Finn is just as desirable to other men as I am’ and hit enter. He looked to the bathroom and hoped that would help. He didn’t want to do anything drastic. Yet.<br />
<br />
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=<br />
<br />
Finn heaved a sign and rubbed the jockstrap around his cock. It was becoming a bit too sticky, he’d likely have to wash it before it irritated his hide. Ah, such were the perils of pursuing a fetish. He pretended to be getting ready for a shower and spied the fit but skinny young man walk into the bathroom behind him.<br />
<br />
The burly ram turned, pulling down his jockstrap, exposing his cock, then pretended to notice the twink and pulled them backup.<br />
<br />
“Hey there.” The young man smiled at the ram. “I’m Sam.”<br />
<br />
Finn blinked at the younger man’s forwardness. “Uh, hi, I’m Finn. Let me guess, you want to know if I can hook you up with my workout buddy, Jeff?”<br />
<br />
“Jeff? The big tiger?” Sam smirked and shook his head. “No, daddy. I want you.”<br />
<br />
“Me?” Finn asked, pleasantly surprised at the turn of events but a little insulted. “I’m only 20 years old, not exactly a daddy-oh!”<br />
<br />
The young man had started fondling the burly ram, hands gently groping his generous ass and pressing his face into the ram’s furry beer-swollen tummy. <br />
<br />
“You smell good.” The man moaned, groping Finn’s thick cock. “Big guy.”<br />
<br />
Finn groaned, feeling the man’s soft hands fondle him and grope him. Sam snuffled up to his armpit and began licking the sweat there. The big ram raised his arms and found himself sitting on the bench as the young man pressed into him, then sat on his lap, rocking against the ram’s hardness. This wasn’t so bad to the ram, but…<br />
<br />
“I’m afraid I’m taken, little guy.” Finn tenderly stroked the younger man’s rather cute face with a hooflet.<br />
<br />
“Mmm.” The young man whined and rubbed his face between the ram’s sweaty chest fur. “I wish I could be with you. Work out with you…”<br />
<br />
Finn smiled and pulled out his phone. &#39;This man is a purple and gold spandex workout suit that loves supporting me. His fabric is unbelievably comfortable and resilient, able to last decades without ripping or tearing. The fabric massages and soothes me while I work out and contributes greatly to muscle growth when worn.&#39; Similar wording had done wonders for his new jockstrap, it might be great for this guy. Then he pressed enter.<br />
<br />
-=-=-=-=-=-=--=-=-=-=--=-=-=-=-<br />
<br />
Sam watched the ram type something into his phone and smiled.<br />
<br />
“Texting your boyfriend you’re going to be late?” The rakish young man winked.<br />
<br />
“Oh, I think we’ll be just fine.” The handsome ram’s muzzle twisted into a blocky-toothed grin and he carefully tapped enter.<br />
<br />
“I…oh…!” A wave of dizziness swept of Sam and he fell forward into the ram’s sweaty-furred torso. “I’m, uh, going to need a few.”<br />
<br />
“Take as long as you need, handsome.” The ram smiled gently and began removing Sam’s clothes, tossing them to the floor where they disintegrated into nothingness. <br />
<br />
Sam nuzzled against the ram further, erection throbbing against his musclegut. It felt like his head was stuffed with cotton. Thinking was just so tiring, it was just too easy to lose himself in the musk and sweat and softness of the big burly ram’s fur. He pulled himself closer, wrapping his arms around the ram, body feeling light and tingly.<br />
<br />
Finn smiled and rubbed the back of the man’s deflating head. The twink’s skin was taking on a royal purple sheen with gold highlights and felt delightfully soft, just like the soiled jockstrap containing his straining cock. The back of Sam’s head dented further as he began to stretch around the ram’s huge chest and big belly. <br />
<br />
Sam felt so aroused and erotic, his skin tingling all over as he slid across the huge ram’s body. He felt strangely happy being so close to the burly ram, holding each of his hefty muscles, the ram’s wide, toned ass, the soft belly, even support his thick cock and balls. Sweat was soaking into him, making him smell like a barn. As he stretched across the ram’s wide chest, he felt like he was being hugged, warm and safe.<br />
<br />
The bodysuit shivered as an orgasmic feeling encompassed his whole being. Being worn felt wonderful and fulfilling. The big ram got up and the muscles sagged softly against his fabric and the suit couldn’t think anymore, all it could do was strain across those lovely muscles and soft belly in sheer bliss.<br />
<br />
Finn scratched his ass, lifted his fluffy tail, farted, then walked to the bathroom door, feeling the fabric tighten around his butt and massage it. The big ram sauntered back out into the gym in his handsome new suit, cock straining, looking for Jeff. He smirked when he saw his muscular tiger boyfriend off in the distance, looking at him in concern.<br />
<br />
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=<br />
<br />
Jeff looked up at the ram as he exited the locker room, nervous. <br />
<br />
But then he saw the tight, form-fitting workout spandex bodysuit he was wearing and relaxed. The purple and gold coloration really did suit him. Finn had clearly just go in for a change of clothes. The suit hugged the ram’s hill and valleys, emphasizing them, and he saw the ram grin when he noticed other gym goers eyeing him up like a piece of hot meat. Finn smirked and groped his bulge before sauntering over to Jeff.<br />
<br />
&quot;Where&#39;s the other guy?&quot; Jeff asked cautiously. <br />
<br />
“He was rather clingy.” Finn said, then chuckled. “Don’t worry, he’s happy.”<br />
<br />
“I’m just glad you’re over being jealous.” Jeff sighed in relief.<br />
<br />
“Not completely.” The ram leaned over and kissed the muscular tiger. “But I’ve found an outlet. We only have half an hour left and I wanna get in a good workout, really work up a sweat for…to break in my new suit.”<br />
<br />
“Aw, I was hoping you’d spot me, but…” Jeff shrugged, “Have fun, babe!”<br />
<br />
The burly ram went to a weight lifting bench and began doing squats, muscles heaving and flexing inside the suit. If Jeff hadn’t known better, he’d swear the fabric was twitching and straining around the muscles. Finn’s cock was clearly hard, tenting his suit. With each squat he did, the ram groaned pleasurably.<br />
<br />
Jeff sighed contentedly and went back to lifting weights. Crisis averted, it seemed.<br />
<br />
By the time they finished, the suit and jock were completely soaked in sweat and precum. For some reason, Finn insisted on wearing them into the showers and lathering up with them, cleaning them while they were still on his body. Halfway through the wash, his hips bucked and his cock spasmed. The ram bleated and moaned happily under the hot steamy shower head.<br />
<br />
Jeff shook his head and smiled. His boyfriend sure was weird sometimes! But man, that post-workout pump was really clear today, Jeff could have sworn the ram was even bigger than before the workout.</p>
