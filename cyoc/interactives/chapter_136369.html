<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Footnotes available at end of episode for those who came in late, and our title is also a line from The Monkees&#39; &quot;Last Train To Clarksville&quot;.—tmw.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Morgan Barr slowly awoke, unaware of the smile upon his lupine muzzle.<br />
It took a bit of time for the brown furred werewolf&#39;s vision to come into focus, but finally he saw the stars shining brightly above him through the branches of the trees losing their leaves as autumn was at last starting to arrive in Moon Lake after an extended (but enjoyable) Indian Summer.<br />
However, the stellar view above was nothing in comparison to the brighter stars he saw while rutting with the hybrid werewolf-cat-panthress Spencer Lawson just before he passed out from <i>One hell of an orgasm! Spencer wasn&#39;t kidding when she said she was in <b>serious</b> heat.</i> (*1)<br />
Morgan just laid there on the table cloth from home he had spread out as a blanket. The heady scent of female whatever Spencer was still lingered in the air, a pleasant aroma to his heightened were senses.<br />
But as Morgan became more aware of his surroundings, he felt an odd sensation below his waist.<br />
Wondering what was going on, Morgan raised his head and looked past his chest to see a furry head bobbing up and down upon his newly revived wolfhood.<br />
&quot;Oh good. You&#39;re up,&quot; said Spencer, raising her black furred head to look at her rutting mate for the evening. &quot;And in more ways than one too,&quot; she added with a smile, before teasingly running her tongue underneath the outer edge of his cock head.<br />
Morgan shuddered in pleasure as Spencer said, &quot;I thank you greatly for what you&#39;ve done for me tonight. I really needed it.&quot;<br />
&quot;No problem. Glad to help,&quot; Morgan replied, and he meant it too. <i>Now if I can just get to see you in a more social setting. Maybe overcome my shyness around women and actually get to go on a date or three with you.</i><br />
&quot;I hope you don&#39;t mind,&quot; said Spencer, as she moved to position herself over Morgan&#39;s now fully revived lupine red rocket, &quot;but I&#39;m still feeling a little itchy.&quot;<br />
&quot;Shall we...?&quot; began Morgan, knowing what Spencer needed.<br />
&quot;Yes, but this time <i>I&#39;m</i> driving, and as fantastic as it was, please don&#39;t flip us over,&quot; said Spencer with another big smile on her muzzle, as she lowered herself toward her goal.<br />
Morgan felt himself sink fully into Spencer&#39;s hot and needy depths once more as the hybrid were began to ride him hard and fast, racing toward her next sensational orgasm.<br />
<br />
MEANWHILE...<br />
&quot;I hope you all have enjoyed your dinners,&quot; said Pierre, as the maitre&#39;d of Shambala (a secret were establishment somewhere between Moon Lake and Seattle) watched the busboy remove the empty dishes and cutlery.<br />
&quot;Yes, we have,&quot; answered Melissa Stovall, to which the rest of her party heartily agreed.<br />
&quot;Excellent!&quot; replied Pierre. &quot;Now then, if you have the time, I shall return with a wonderful dessert to top off this fantastic night of celebration,&quot; referring to the fact the Stovalls, along with their daughter Julie&#39;s fiance, were there to celebrate the fact that Melissa was now expecting her second child. (*2)<br />
Martin Stovall nodded his approval as Eric Anderson said, &quot;Merci.&quot;<br />
As Pierre left their table, Julie turned to her beloved and said, &quot;I didn&#39;t know you spoke French.&quot;<br />
&quot;Not fluently,&quot; admitted Eric. &quot;With Minnesota being near the Canadian border, I&#39;ve picked up a few words and phrases over the years, but that&#39;s about it.&quot;<br />
&quot;So, what do you kids think of the place?&quot; wondered Martin. Although Shambala had a steady were patronage, they were still technically a public business, so everyone was in their normal forms right now.<br />
&quot;It&#39;s great dad,&quot; said his daughter. &quot;What kind of functions do they cover?&quot;<br />
&quot;Everything,&quot; he answered. &quot;Weddings, anniversaries. Birthdays.&quot;<br />
&quot;Say, that reminds me,&quot; said Julie, turning to face Eric. &quot;I know we&#39;re both 14, but I&#39;ve never asked when your birthday is honey.&quot;<br />
&quot;March 14. Why?&quot; asked Eric in return.<br />
&quot;OH MY GOD!&quot; shouted Julie, excitedly.<br />
&quot;What?&quot; said Eric, as some of the other dining room patrons briefly turned to see what the noise was about.<br />
&quot;My birthday is February 14. Do you know what that means?&quot; Julie asked him in return.<br />
&quot;Besides the fact that it&#39;s Valentine&#39;s Day, you technically will be a month older than me each year,&quot; replied Eric, not knowing what had his fiance so excited.<br />
&quot;Besides that,&quot; said Julie with a grin, to which Eric had no answer. &quot;I&#39;m Aquarius and you&#39;re Pisces!&quot;<br />
&quot;So? I&#39;ve never put much stock into astrological signs or horoscopes,&quot; admitted Eric.<br />
&quot;Neither do I,&quot; agreed Julie, &quot;but fish-&quot; she said, pointing to Eric, &quot;and water,&quot; she added, pointing to herself, &quot;go wonderfully together. It&#39;s further proof that you <i>are</i> my were-merman and I&#39;m your mermaid!&quot;<br />
&quot;Really?&quot; said Eric, as a smile crossed his face. Considering his recent scare when he thought Julie was going to dump him for fellow were-mer Arthur Curtis... (*3)<br />
&quot;Yes!&quot; said Julie, as she leaned over to begin kissing Eric.<br />
Melissa couldn&#39;t help but smile at her husband, as she held his hand in hers and laid her head on Martin&#39;s shoulder.<br />
&quot;They were meant to be together,&quot; Melissa said happily, watching Julie and Eric continue to kiss.<br />
&quot;And so are we,&quot; said Martin proudly, as he removed his hand from Melissa&#39;s to put his arm lovingly around his wife.<br />
Martin Stovall was still holding her, and the younger couple were still exchanging kisses, when Pierre returned with their dessert.<br />
<br />
ELSEWHERE...<br />
Alex Ramsey thought dinner at the Andersons was a pleasant event.<br />
Then again, he also believed that any moment with his boyfriend and future husband Nate Anderson was wonderful too.<br />
After supper, Martha excused herself to visit their next door neighbors, Samantha and Frances Twist, while Nate offered to walk Alex home.<br />
As the pair left out the backdoor of the Andersons&#39; house and started climbing up the hill behind it, Nate admitted, &quot;I&#39;m worried about the Predators and Prey Game.&quot; (*4)<br />
&quot;Oh. Why?&quot; wondered Alex. He had his book bag in one hand, and was holding Nate&#39;s with the other.<br />
&quot;It&#39;s not the plays. I&#39;ll be as good as anyone else come game day. But right now we just keep getting split up into offense and defensive squads. What happens when we&#39;re finally assigned to a team, but we&#39;re split up?&quot;<br />
&quot;Well,&quot; said Alex, as a sly smile crossed his face. &quot;Regardless of if one of us winds up a Predator and the other Prey, you know we&#39;re going to have some more intimate scrimmages after the game,&quot; before kissing Nate&#39;s cheek.<br />
&quot;Would you still respect me in the morning if I beat the pants off of you during the game?&quot; Nate asked jokingly.<br />
&quot;Only if we both get to enjoy being nude and furry afterward,&quot; replied Alex, noting the fact that right now, both teenagers were still in their normal human forms instead of their werewolf fursonas.<br />
At the top of the hill, which also was the halfway point between the Anderson and Ramsey houses, Nate stopped and turned to look at Alex. &quot;Want to get wolfy and howl at the moon?&quot;<br />
Alex briefly glanced skyward before facing Nate and replying, &quot;There&#39;s no moon tonight.&quot;<br />
&quot;Who needs one?&quot; said Nate in return, before embracing the man of his heart and initiating a passionate kiss.<br />
