<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">He had never worked in the clothing section of the store before. But after he&#39;d gotten the scoop from Patricia on what he was supposed to be doing, and was left in three sections of woman&#39;s wear, Edgar found it was almost like a second nature to be working around the various garments that he felt he should know nothing about, yet it kind of felt like he did.  Several times he had a couple of those weird moments when he found himself looking at a particular top, dress, or outfit, finding it cute, and wanting to try it on. But he found it was easy to shrug off by reminding himself he was at work, and that there were other odder things going on.<br />
<br />
The first came when he thought he was due for his dinner break. Yet, when Patricia came to find him, she at first called him Roni, which he at first didn&#39;t realise she was talking to him, then was able to shrug it off by saying, &quot;Sorry. Didn&#39;t hear you. Got caught up in what I was doing,&quot; to which she smiled and told him, &quot;That&#39;s okay,&quot; then, &quot;Why don&#39;t you go take his lunch break.&quot;<br />
<br />
Confused by this, he wanted to argue that it wasn&#39;t lunch time. But, shrugging it off as well, he headed back to the employee break room, where he found that the clock back there said it was almost twelve thirty, in the afternoon. Unsure what was going on, he collected his lunch and as he sat down to eat, he tried to remember if he had read anywhere in the Amulet of Zulo was capable of changing time, as he was sure he had arrived at three pm and worked to eleven pm.<br />
<br />
Lost in thought, he didn&#39;t give it a second thought when two women, one of them he knew worked the customer service counter, entered the break room. As they collected their lunches, he was distracted from his thoughts as one the woman said, &quot;Well, if she is going to flake every single time, I suggest we don&#39;t invite Kathy along anymore,&quot; to which the other sighed and said, &quot;She&#39;s been my friend since junior high. But, I suppose you&#39;re right. But if we don&#39;t invite her, who will be our third. I mean, don&#39;t get me wrong. I like hanging out with you, as you&#39;ve been my besty since grade school. But, I dunno, these outings of ours just feel, I dunno, more complete when there is three of us to share it with.&quot;<br />
<br />
The other not replying as they had noticed Edgar for the first time, they immediately sat down across from him. And as he reminded himself that their names was Dakotah and Kira, it was to his immense surprise Dakotah said, &quot;Hey, Roni. What are you doing after work?&quot;<br />
<br />
Taken aback by this, and not only because he had once again been called Roni, even though his name tag clearly said Edgar, but also because nobody actually really talked to him, unless it was something work related. Swallowing the bit of food he was chewing, getting over his shock that these two actually were talking him, and seemed to be interested in what he was doing after he&#39;d finished, Edgar shrugged and said, &quot;Don&#39;t know. Haven&#39;t really got anything planned I suppose.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;See, we usually have these little get outings, usually once or twice a week,&quot; Kira immediately began explaining. &quot;Think of it as a sort of girls&#39; night out. And it is supposed to be me, Dakotah and out friend Kathy. But, lately, she&#39;s been flaking on us, leaving us in a total lynch. So, maybe, I dunno, you could come with us. What do you say? I will totally be fun.&quot;<br />
<br />
Taken aback by what he was hearing, and what he had just been invited to join, Edgar fumbled for something to say. Tempted to tell them he couldn&#39;t, that he was a guy, he instead found himself say, &quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; to which Dakotah pleaded, &quot;Please. Come on. It will be fun.&quot;<br />
<br />
As if hearing himself from a great distance, Edgar listened as he muttered, &quot;I don&#39;t know. I mean. I don&#39;t really have anything to wear,&quot; even as he wanted to argue that he was a guy.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s cool,&quot; Kira replied. &quot;We were thinking about doing some shopping first.&quot;<br />
<br />
Feeling like he was backed into a corner, that, on one hand, it wasn&#39;t appropriate for a dude to go out with two women on a girls&#39; night out, whilst on the other he found he really wanted, Edgar mulled it over a second longer before hearing himself saying, &quot;I&#39;d love to. What time, and where, should I meet you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We get off at about three,&quot; Kira said, to which Edgar heard himself saying he got off at the same time.<br />
<br />
A dream-like state seemed to come over him as he listened and talked with the two woman and before he come to terms with what was happening, it was  decided that they would meet at Dakotah&#39;s place after work.<br />
---<br />
<br />
The rest of his work day passing in a flash, Edgar found himself alternating between feeling like he was walking about fully awake and sleep-walking in the same dream-like slate. Unsure why it seemed reality had been re-written so he worked the seven to three shift, he tried on multiple occasions to try and puzzle it out. Things seeming to do a weird jump, he soon found himself first punching out for the day and then, without realising how he had gotten there, he found himself at Dakotah&#39;s apartment, arriving at about the same time Kira. And once more, as if experiencing a very vivid dream, things seemed to shift and suddenly he found himself modeling a very tight pair of ultra low rise, button fly, hip hugger jeans. Trying to wrestle some control, he found he wasn&#39;t even able to do that as everything seemed to speed up and before he knew it, he found himself going with Kira and Dakotah to a couple more stores, out to dinner, taking in a movie that at any other time he wouldn&#39;t have watched but found interesting this time, and afterward to a couple bars and clubs.<br />
<br />
As he sat at a table with the two women, it was as if suddenly he had awoken from a pleasant dream. Hearing himself announce over the pounding beat, &quot;Oh, yeah. He is kind of cute. Not exactly yummy. But certainly kind of cute,&quot; Edgar once again found himself wondering what the necklace had done to him. Needing the bathroom, he found it welcome excuse as he slipped from the chair, told Dakotah and Kira, &quot;Be right back,&quot; before starting across the club, dodging between patrons.<br />
<br />
Without a second thought as to what he was doing, Edgar pushed open the bathroom door and as he stepped in, he took in the stalls and lack of urinals. Realising he had gone into the wrong restroom, he was about to turn about and exit when he noticed a couple women standing in front of the sink. Thinking they would raise the alarm about a guy in the women&#39;s toilet, he was surprised when they ignored him. Hurrying to nearest stall, wondering what was going on, if he had somehow turned into a girl and hadn&#39;t realised it, he closed the door and locked it. Fumbling with the three buttons on the jeans he was wearing, wondering how it was possible he had been able to squeeze his way into them, disturbed at how flat his front looked, but figuring if he turned into a girl, there wouldn&#39;t be anything there, he pushed down on the jeans and was surprised to find that not only was he wearing a pair of very tiny pair of bikini briefs, but also that his man junk was tucked comfortably between his legs.<br />
<br />
Disturbed by this, suddenly aware of other aspects of his body, Edgar sat down on the toilet. Without giving thought to what he was doing, he began to pee sitting down. His mind on other matters, he again wondered if maybe the Amulet of Zulo didn&#39;t turn him in a girl, but had done something to his mind. But then remembering how he had been called Roni, the way Kira and Dakotah acted like he was one of the girls, and the way they women didn&#39;t bat an eye when he, clearly a dude, entered the wrong toilet. Finishing his business, he stood and with his privates again tucked between his legs, Edgar stood, pulled up his underwear and jeans, buttoned the front, which pulled everything so tight it was impossible to tell if he had anything down there, and after flushing, exited the stall.<br />
<br />
Grateful to find he was alone in the bathroom, he headed for the sink and as he began to wash his hands, he stared into the mirror.<br />
<br />
The familiar image of a six foot one, gangly man with short black hair and dark grey eyes peered back at him. Turning his head one direction, then another, he noted that nothing had changed. Looking down at the shirt he was wearing, a tight little white tank top with a sparkly heart printed on it, he noted that he was wearing a bra underneath it. His mind thinking, &quot;Spaghetti strap bra and top,&quot; as he tried to figure out what the ultra thin straps that went over his should were called, he looked down at his feet and noted that he was wearing a cute pair of boots that zipped up the side. Wondering when he had changed, remembering that he had an adorable jean jacket that complimented the outfit, he looked back at his reflection. Staring at his male self, observing that he had shaved his body at some point, thinking he should look ridiculous dressed the way he was, yet finding it not only looked natural, but that he also looked pretty, he leaned forward when he thought he saw something.<br />
<br />
The words, &quot;What the hell,&quot; escaped him as he took in the dab of make up he had on and straightening, he ran a hand through his short hair as he tried to figure what the amulet had done to him and why it seemed to have only affected his mind and the people around him.<br />
<br />
No answer came to him and as he sighed, he figured that it was something he would have to look up, if he could find the magazines and books he had read at various points over the past three or fours years. Feeling his mind start to drift back to the dream-like state again, he smiled and told himself, &quot;But first girl, you need a night out for partying,&quot; and finding it odd he had said what he just said, Edgar turned away from the mirror and headed out of the bathroom.</p>
