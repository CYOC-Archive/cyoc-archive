<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff walks to Darren’s room, which is directly next to his, and knocks on the door, the door opens and the “girl” is greeted by the smiling face of Darren, “hey Zoey,” he says, “what’s up? Did you have a nice rest?”<br />
<br />
“Hey,” “Zoey” says, “I did have a nice little rest. I just wanted to see if you have anything planned for the rest of the day”.<br />
<br />
Darren shakes his head, “no, I have nothing planned,” he says.<br />
<br />
“Okay,” the “girl” says, “um… I know that I am supposed to stick close to you, that I am in reality your hostage. But, would it be okay if I’d explore the hotel and grounds a little? I never have been in a five star hotel and I am curious to see what they got”.<br />
<br />
Darren thinks for a while, “well, as long as you be careful and promise not to try and escape or call for help, I guess I can let you roam free. Just stay in the hotel and on the grounds, and keep your phone on, so that I can call you”.<br />
<br />
Jeff smiles, “thanks Dar… I mean… dad,” he says, “I promise to be careful and I don’t see a reason to wanting to escape… you haven’t harmed me in any way”.<br />
<br />
Darren smiles, “okay, well then, have fun and stay in touch,” he says, “if something happens or if you need my help, call me straight away, my phone number is in your contact on your new phone”.<br />
<br />
Jeff nods, “I promise I will,” he says, “I’ll see you later… dad,” with that, the “girl” turns and heads towards the elevator. The former 16 year-old boy, now 12 year-old girl, takes the elevator down to the Lobby, “I can ask at the front desk if they have something like a gaming room or event thing,” he says to himself.<br />
<br />
When he arrives at the front desk he rings the bell, a young lady soon appears, she smiles down at the young “girl”, “what can I do for you, honey,” she asks.<br />
<br />
“Hey,” the “girl” says, “I was wondering, do you have a gaming room or some other activity services?”<br />
<br />
The woman nods, “if you take the elevator down to the basement, turn right down the hall,” she says, “there is a pool area, sauna, gaming room, a gym and other areas for you to have fun. Signs on the walls will point you in the right direction”.<br />
<br />
“Thanks, miss,” “Zoey” says, then she heads to the elevator and heads down to the basement, unaware that a certain boy is chilling in the gaming room.<br />
<br />
When “Zoey” arrive in the basement, she exits the elevator and pauses for a second, “hm… the lady said to turn right,” she mumbles, so she starts to head down the long hallway.<br />
<br />
After a while, “Zoey” sees a sign, hanging over a double door which splits the hallway into two. The sign says “Event & Activity Area”, the “girl” notices that there are doors with signs above them: “Table Tennis”, “Gym”, “Pool”, “Sauna”, “Cinema”, “Gaming”,… . “Zoey” smiles she then heads to the door with the “Gaming” sign, as she gets closer, she can hear the sound of someone seeming to play Mario Cart. The “girl” nervously opens the door and steps inside, closing the door behind her, then she looks around the room: the room is large, it has multiple Arcade machines like “PinBall” and some machines where you use a claw to try and grab an item. “Zoey” turns her head to the right, she sees a huge Flatscreen which has the Mario Cart game running, in front of the TV are multiple big beanbags, one seems to be occupied.<br />
<br />
‘I wonder if the person will let me play with them,’ the “girl” thinks to herself, ‘I haven’t played Mario Cart for a while,’ she takes a deep breath and after picking up hall her courage, slowly heads over.<br />
<br />
When “Zoey” walks around the beanbag, she notices a boy with olive skin, brown hair and an athletic body sitting in it. The boy seems to be totally focused on the game, he does not glance up, “Zoey” clears her throat, the boy pauses the game and turns his head to look at her, a smile appearing on his face.<br />
<br />
When Raúl hears someone cough beside him, he pauses the game, and when he turns his head to see who it was, he can’t help but smile when he realizes that Zoey is standing there. “Oh, hi,” the boy says, “sorry, I didn’t notice you, I was so focused on the game”.<br />
<br />
“Zoey” can’t help but chuckle, which sounds more like a giggle, “I thought so,” she says, “I wanted to ask if I may be able to play too?”<br />
<br />
Raúl almost melts when “Zoey” giggles, ‘man, her giggling sounds so angelic, as does her voice,’ he thinks to himself, ‘she even looks much prettier up close’. The boy smiles, “of course,” he says, “it is kinda boring playing by myself,” he adds, handing the “girl” a controller.<br />
<br />
“Zoey” smiles happily, “cool,” she says, taking the controller and sitting down next to the boy on a free beanbag.<br />
<br />
Raúl exits the game and starts setting everything up for two players, “by the way,” he says, “my name is Raúl”.<br />
<br />
“Zoey” smiles, “happy to meet you, Raúl,” she says, “my name is Zoey”.<br />
<br />
‘I know,’ Raúl thinks to himself, “the pleasure is all mine,” he says with a smile.<br />
<br />
“Are you from here,” “Zoey” asks curiously.<br />
<br />
Raúl nods, “I am,” he says, “well, not from this city, but I live in Spain”.<br />
<br />
“Zoey” widens her eyes, “for a Latino, you speak really well english”.<br />
<br />
Raúl chuckles, “thanks,” he says, “I pay a lot of attention in class, plus I have a few friends overseas, so I got lots of training,” he smiles proudly at Zoey. “Where are you from, if you don’t mind me asking,” he then says.<br />
<br />
‘He has such beautiful eyes, and his smile is incredible,’ the “girl” thinks to herself, ‘wait! What the hell am I thinking? I’m straight! Why would I find a boy attractive,’ Jeff feels confused.<br />
<br />
“Um… Zoey,” Raúl says, “I asked you a question”.<br />
<br />
“Zoey” blinks, “s-sorry, I… um… was zoned out for a s-second. Sorry… wh-what was the question again,” she asks, blushing a little.<br />
<br />
Raúl smiles, ‘looks like she finds me attractive,’ he thinks to himself, ‘I might be lucky, I just have to play my cards right and not rush it’. The boy chuckles, “don’t worry,” he says, “I asked where you are from”.<br />
<br />
“I… I am from the US,” the “girl” says.<br />
<br />
“I see,” Raúl says, “must have been a long trip,” he adds.<br />
<br />
“Zoey” nods, “yeah, it was,” she says.<br />
<br />
“Are you here with your dad on vacation,” Raúl asks.<br />
<br />
“Not exactly,” she replies, “my dad is here on a business matter, since I have no school, he asked if I wanted to tag along”.<br />
<br />
“I see,” Raúl says, “I saw your dad earlier in the Lobby, he looks pretty intimidating”.<br />
<br />
“Zoey” chuckles, “yeah, but he is a big softy,” she says with a grin, ‘good thing Darren did not hear that,’ she thinks to herself, “are we gonna play or what,” she then asks.<br />
<br />
“Oh, right,” Raúl says, “he… sorry, I am just curious and interested”.<br />
<br />
“Zoey” smiles, “all good,” she says, “we can talk more while we play”.<br />
<br />
Raúl smiles back, “fine with me,” he says, “I really wanna get to know more about you”.<br />
<br />
This causes “Zoey” to feel a little uneasy, ‘is he just interested or is he hitting on me,’ she asks herself, ‘god damn it, Jeff… get a grip! He is just curious, that’s all! When he tries to kiss you, THEN you may start to feel uneasy’. The “girl” looks over at Raúl, “I’d like to know more about you too. You seem to be a nice guy,” she says, mentally slapping herself, that sure came out wrong, oh well, “wh-what would you like to know?”<br />
<br />
Raúl smiles, “well, what do you like to do in your free time,” the boy asks, “just tell me some stuff about yourself”.<br />
<br />
“Zoey” thinks for a while, ‘it can’t hurt to tell him about myself,’ she thinks to himself, ‘we are both boys, so I shouldn’t need to worry about saying something wrong,’ Jeff is so nervous, that he forgets that he is NOT a boy right now. The “girl” looks at Raúl, “well, I enjoy sports, like soccer, basketball, I also enjoy going to the gym,” she says, “I like to hang out with my friends, go shopping, enjoy a movie in the cinema. I am single, I guess I haven’t found the right mate yet, I also love to go to the beach, I live in the south of Florida. I am extremely submissive, which I get bullied a lot for. That’s about it, what about you?”<br />
<br />
Raúl smiles, ‘I know most of what she is telling me, thanks to the App, but to not raise suspicion, I prefer to pretend I didn’t know anything about her, just like any other boy,’ he thinks to himself. “Well,” the boy then says, “I enjoy the same things as you: I love sports and hanging out with my friends. I am also single, sadly, haven’t found the right girl yet, but hopes are high and I have the feeling I’ll meet her soon. As for my personality, I am pretty dominant on a loving and emotional side. I mean, I would never hurt a girl in any way, and I live in Barcelona”.<br />
<br />
“Zoey” smiles, “I’d like to see your home town one day,” she says.<br />
<br />
“I’d be happy to show you around, Zoey,” Raúl says, smiling, “do you mind me asking, what type of boy do you find attractive?”<br />
<br />
Without thinking, “Zoey” replies, “boys like you: athletic, good looking, brown skin, brown hair, brown eyes”.<br />
<br />
Raúl smiles, “well, and you are my type of girl, Zoey,” he says, “d-do… do you think w-we could…?”<br />
<br />
“I don’t know, Raúl,” the “girl says, “I mean… we just met, besides we live so far apart, I doubt that it would work out”.<br />
<br />
“Well… at least, could we swap out numbers,” Raúl asks, “I… I’d like to stay in contact”.<br />
<br />
Jeff is shocked when he finally realizes what he has said to Raúl, ‘what the fuck is going on,’ he asks himself, ‘why am I saying these things? I am a boy, not a girl, well… okay, I AM a girl at this point, but I am a boy mentally! So why on earth would I even consider dating him?’<br />
<br />
The former boy looks at Raúl, he then hears a voice in his head, ‘Raúl is such a handsome boy,’ it says, in a calm tone, ‘he is just what you want! He is so kind, his eyes are so beautiful, his smile is heaven…! Just give it a try, it won’t hurt! You are a girl and girls date boys, so give it a shot, don’t let this hunk get away!’<br />
<br />
The more Jeff listens to the voice, the more it starts to make sense, ‘I AM a girl… a straight girl,’ he thinks to himself, ‘straight girls date boys! And Raúl is just so handsome! I… I AM curious to want to know what he looks like under those clothes!’<br />
<br />
“Zoey,” Raúl asks, sounding worried, “y-you okay?”<br />
<br />
“Zoey” blinks, “y-yeah, sorry, I… kinda zoned out for a second,” she says, “I am just surprised… you are the first boy to ask for my number!”<br />
<br />
Raúl smiles, “well, why wouldn’t I,” he asks, “you are such a beautiful girl. Your… your lips… they look so kissable… y-your eyes are stunningly beautiful… as is everything about you”.<br />
<br />
“Zoey” blushes, she then giggles, “and you are one hunky handsome boy,” she says, “okay, you persuaded me,” and without a second thought, gives the boy her number, and Raúl gives “Zoey” his.<br />
<br />
“Thanks, Zoey,” he says with a big smile, “I… I hope we’ll become good friends… b-but maybe… maybe more,” he asks, hopefully.<br />
<br />
“Maybe,” the “girl” says with a smile and wink.<br />
<br />
Raúl smiles, he then looks at his watch, his eyes widen, “wow, time flies,” he says, “and we didn’t even play the game”.<br />
<br />
“Zoey” giggles, “I preferred the conversation to be honest,” she says.<br />
<br />
Raúl smiles, “d-do you want to meet up tomorrow evening?”<br />
<br />
“Zoey” thinks for a while, she then smiles, “sure, but I can’t promise anything,” she says, “I promise though, if I can’t come, I’ll call you, okay?”<br />
<br />
“Okay, sounds good,” Raúl says, smiling.<br />
<br />
“Well, I guess I better head back to my room,” “Zoey” says, “it is almost time for dinner and I don’t know what my dad has planned”.<br />
<br />
Raúl nods, “same here,” he says, “I hope to see you tomorrow, Zoey”.<br />
<br />
“Me too, Raúl,” she replies.<br />
<br />
Both get up, Raúl turns off the power to the TV and console, they then head to the elevators and get in. When the elevator reaches Raúl’s floor, the boy turns to “Zoey” and gives her a kiss on the cheek, causing the “girl” to blush, “s-see you s-soon, Zoey,” Raúl then says, blushing himself.<br />
<br />
“Zoey” is surprised, but the kiss did feel nice, it actually felt right being kissed by Raúl, the “girl” giggles, she then leans in and give Raúl a peck on his cheek, “yeah… s-see you soon, Raúl!”</p>
