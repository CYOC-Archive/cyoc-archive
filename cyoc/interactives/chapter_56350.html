<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Marie-Eliza realized this wouldn't be the end. If the game did this to a transformation into <br />
a love doll... what of other Leoman who'd be struck down by the game?  'The sooner the <br />
game is killed the better. I don't know if I can catch every one of these fires anymore than <br />
Madam Serenity can... Well, at least it's only six or five days until they should have enough <br />
cure to finally end this insanity started my Other Mother's creators...' <br />
<br />
Madame Serenity felt sick when she found a note on the foot of the bed. It was very well <br />
written. A little too much poetry for her taste but go the point across. <br />
<br />
Marie-Eliza had said Penny would be able to restore them. She could have hardly restored <br />
them to Leomans if they had never been Leomans and were just love dolls manufactured to <br />
look like Leomans. <br />
<br />
MARIE-ELIZA had SAID they could be restored. So therefore they could be restored. As a <br />
result, reality was pushed kicking and screaming (and Marie-Eliza knew this cheat would <br />
cost her somehow, she just didn't know how yet) so where the four of them had existence <br />
again before as Leoman before coming in contact with the game instead of having always <br />
been love dolls, as the twisted version of the cascade had dictated. Yes, Marie-Eliza knew <br />
she'd pay dearly for this act of cheating. Cheating with Magic ALWAYS extracted it's price <br />
somewhere... <br />
<br />
The note was signed by four names (two male, two female). Metaphors and thesaurus-rexs <br />
aside, it basically said the four of them in this apparent version of the timeline had entered <br />
a pact after getting a hold of the game to Transform each other into near indestructible <br />
love dolls no one would miss, whose threads of fate made it impossible for them to be <br />
separated but still able to speak to each other mentally. <br />
<br />
Madam Serenity was astounded, even if this was just reality covering it's bases, that people <br />
would do something like this to themselves willing and knowingly. <br />
<br />
She also noticed a video camera that had been set so it had a good view of the bed that <br />
had been left on record until it had exhausted it's space and automatically shut down as <br />
programmed to do. <br />
<br />
'Dear God! They made a RECORDING of turning themselves into latex sex figured?!' <br />
Madame Serenity wasn't sure how to comprehend people like that. 'Does this mean they <br />
heard what I and the glass pup said?... Then again I get the feeling they don't give a damn <br />
about what we said anyway...'  <br />
<br />
The males looked like they had been made from a standardized mold, as did the two <br />
lionesses. <br />
<br />
Serenity, as a PI, was one for details and did note that the love dolls all had copy right <br />
information on their rears. As if that was to somehow matter to them once they couldn't <br />
even move by themselves!  What was this, some glorified form of suicide, being scared to <br />
die, or being scared to live but not wanting to die? <br />
<br />
Madam Serenity groaned, she had gotten into this business for the sake of those changed <br />
or enslaved by the game against their will... These self inflicted ones either never came to <br />
her, or she never found, and they always gave her a headache. In particular since her one <br />
source of information on how things were before the mess insured had said it was at it's <br />
limit and had to skedaddle! <br />
<br />
Madam Serenity of course had no way to know that the Japanese wolves had set a <br />
precedent by legally signing themselves off as life-time-performance-art leaving a door <br />
that people could turn themselves into rocks if proven of sound mind and body. <br />
<br />
 Of course even with this weird legal precedent in place, there would have been the <br />
question if those who had legally signed their lives away were at the age where they could <br />
legally do so!  In the old timeline the punk had been a teenage punk living alone, and his <br />
victim a teenage boy living with his parents and the two furries had been mid-twenty <br />
adults.  How this would work out for the leoman cascade that remained now that the <br />
infection of the game was gone was anyone's guess. <br />
<br />
And Madame Serenity knew none of this, all she knew was that in the new screwed up <br />
version of reality that had apparently come to pass, she had another group of -willing- <br />
victims on her hands, and who had apparently gotten what they wanted, and those meant <br />
they could stupidly just go off in search of another turn again. <br />
<br />
'Oh oh oh! Is she going to play the tape?' Thought of the love dolls. <br />
<br />
'Eh eh eh eh I hope so. Should be fun.' Said her partner. <br />
<br />
'Maybe she'll want to join us, join us! Tee-hee!' Of course that twisted version of the <br />
cascade thankfully no longer existed, and would not have effected Madame Serenity <br />
anyway. <br />
<br />
Her partner answered, 'Even if she doesn't, I was hoping someone would play the <br />
recording back if anyone found us...'  The love dolls had thought they'd go undiscovered <br />
for weeks, months, since none could know they were missing... but an apparently fellow <br />
living object and this old human had found them. <br />
<br />
Madame Serenity sighed to herself and began to run the recording from the beginning, <br />
hoping this could help her decide what to do. <br />
<br />
++++++++<br />
<br />
'Welcome back lovely.' Kira said, being careful not to say 'welcome home'. 'It was kinda <br />
empty without you.' <br />
<br />
'Sorry,' Sunny said, 'But we had to work double shifts do to everyone being hurt... we came <br />
as soon as our shift was over.' <br />
<br />
'So you came along too Luna? Heh.' Kira teased to the giant silver wolf woman statue with a <br />
star chart turns by the month in her belly compared to the traditional clock turning in the <br />
giant gold statue's belly. <br />
<br />
Luna replied, 'Well, it didn't feel right to just leave Sunny all by her lonesome with you.' <br />
<br />
'Don't worry, I don't bite.' Said the immobile bronze 'Thinker' Lupman statue. <br />
<br />
Meanwhile through out the manor, Luna and Sunny's spiritual auras as the sun and moon <br />
statues inspired an enhanced level of efficiency in the night shift lupmans as it had the last <br />
time they had spent the night with Kira. <br />
<br />
Kira recounted his life in the days of plantations and slavery, of his self imposed <br />
punishment for being a vigilante on an innocent man. Of Amy and Zelipe's rescue, of his <br />
own choice that this existence in the motionless world was better than one in the transient <br />
moving world. <br />
<br />
Luna and Sunny let themselves open to Glendale's power grid, feeling like they were one <br />
with the city. It was electrifying to pardon the pun. Sunny and Luna talked about their <br />
attempt to woo Jensen to no avail and seek out a mate for the pair of them. Weather it was <br />
the electricity, Kira's smooth tongue, or his ability to give off a comforting aura, or just <br />
tired of trying to find a man for the two of them who was something great (even if that <br />
something great was an entry way statue) the clocks on her bellies were soon on the side <br />
of their hips as the statue became a picture of the gold, silver and bronze ceiling size <br />
lupmans in passionate loving making. <br />

<br />
The thorns would not touch the children in any shape or form. That had been a failsafe the <br />
witches had left in place very carefully. They didn't want to risk the thorns not being able to <br />
tell friend from foe. The children were allowed to do pretty much as they pleased anyway.  <br />
The thorns turned to and from flowers at the children's passing. <br />
<br />
It was actually a small miracle the 300 year plus weapons didn't accidently take a leoman's <br />
head off, or accidently knew a child to pieces. Creating something OUT OF A VISION was <br />
completely reckless, even more so handing it off to those who had no experience using the <br />
weapons let alone how they worked or how much damage they could truly cause. <br />
<br />
Not to mention the weapons had to reloaded after each shot, and that meant creating <br />
ammo, FOR BAZOOKAS in a place meant to house children and to be their personal <br />
playground. The witches truly were completely mad. <br />
<br />
Everyone at the witch's house, -becoming an estate as they practically devoured territory <br />
around it- accept all this with little more than a nod and a smile. The witches at this point <br />
openly displayed their power almost. And the Witch Pride and Samantha and Alissa's family, <br />
accepted it all. As those in Glendale's thought slowly became more aligned with the <br />
witches' warped perception of reality, those within the witch's home simply woke up one <br />
morning, realized the owners of the house were witches, and simply accepted it as the <br />
influence of the witch's ultimate spell to rewrite the world came to pass among them in <br />
one form or another. <br />
<br />
Armored windows were of course next. And reinforced walls and doors. There had to be no <br />
openings. No mistakes. Not with everything to gain and everything to lose. <br />
<br />
As the weeks passed... all the children except Joella began to dance, in a pattern that never <br />
repeated with one of the children at the center always seemingly directly the never <br />
repeating performance. The witches pleased, this meant the bound between Familiar, <br />
Master, and Infinite Chaos grew strong and stronger. <br />
<br />
Marie Cruz meanwhile, was reduced to counting the days until it was safe to move her <br />
friends, and into the praying town where they could recover property. And wonder if she'd <br />
have to kill another child before things ended. Marie loathed this waiting, but had seen <br />
what impulsiveness had gotten her. She HATED how time seemed to crawl at times like <br />
this.  And of course, to figure out a way to avoid the future she had seen...</p>
