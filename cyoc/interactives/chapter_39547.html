<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Little fucking bastard...&quot; Cole grunted while he continued his workout. He was a pretty <br />
good looking guy -- he was short, only about five feet and two inches tall, but he had a <br />
muscular build to try to compensate. He didn't look like a bodybuilder, but he was still a <br />
little muscular -- just more on the stocky side. &quot;Why did my little brother get lucky with <br />
the genetics?&quot; <br />
<br />
He continued to grunt out the words angrily until he was finally finished his workout. You <br />
see, while Cole was a good looking and handsome man, he was incredibly jealous of his <br />
older brother, Matt.<br />
<br />
Matt was only two inches taller than Cole, but out of sibling rivalry he always rubbed it in. <br />
His build was much more lean than Cole's was, but his muscles were much more defined <br />
and better looking. <br />
<br />
The two of them had been fighting since birth. Cole was two years older and 24, while <br />
Matt was 22. Cole desperately wanted to be the alpha male -- but his brother always took <br />
over the position and humiliated him.<br />
<br />
After his workout and a shower, Cole decided to take a walk. He was having a bad day -- <br />
no matter how much he worked out, he still couldn't get that buff. <br />
<br />
The sidewalks were relatively crowded but Cole didn't have any problem getting around -- <br />
he'd just shove his way through when he was in a mood like this. <br />
<br />
He suddenly saw the picture of a hugely muscular man -- he must have been a <br />
bodybuilder. Cole was always in denial about being gay, but he was, and he loved muscle <br />
very much. When he approached the poster, there was a strange packet taped to it with a <br />
pill inside. What was that there for?<br />
<br />
Of course, Cole took the packet anyway. Curiosity got the best of him, and he was in such <br />
a foul mood that he'd do nearly anything at the moment. Deciding that walking was <br />
boring him, he began to walk back to his apartment. Unfortunately because of recent <br />
financial issues, Cole and Matt were roommates.<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
&quot;Gr... I have to get even bigger than him... can't get lazy...&quot; Matt grunted while he lifted <br />
weights. While he knew he was bigger, stronger and taller than his older brother, he didn't <br />
want to risk losing that precious advantage -- he loved being the alpha male, after all.<br />
<br />
After finishing his workout, showering, he decided to head back to his apartment. He <br />
wanted to watch the baseball game today, and certainly didn't want to miss it.<br />
<br />
On his way home, he was distracted by a poster. It was a poster of a freakishly huge <br />
muscular man flexing. Matt tried not to stare, but he couldn't help himself. He wished he <br />
could be like that guy. <br />
<br />
Unable to stop himself, he walked closer to the sign to get a better look at the guy. Oddly <br />
enough, there was a packet taped to the sign with a pill in it. Matt was a believer in <br />
'everything happens for a reason', so he decided to take the packet and head home. He'd <br />
try to see what it was later.<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
When Matt got home, he noticed that his brother was sitting on the couch and watching a <br />
football game he had tivo'd. &quot;Put it on the game.&quot; Matt said in a bossy tone.<br />
<br />
Cole was surprised to see his brother enter, and even more surprised to hear him <br />
command him to change the channel. While that wasn't unusual behavior, it always pissed <br />
him off. &quot;Fuck you, man. I'm watching the game.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We're going to watch baseball. It's much better than this junk!&quot; Matt said angrily.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I've got the remote so too bad for you.&quot; Cole said, smirking.<br />
<br />
Matt immediately lunged at Cole, trying to grab at the remote. He wasn't exactly polite or <br />
subtle, and he knew he was stronger than his brother.<br />
<br />
Cole expected it so tried to roll off the couch to dodge Matt's pounce.<br />
<br />
The two of them went at it for a while -- ripping the remote out of each other's hands and <br />
trying to change the channel, only to have the other brother grab it back again. Eventually <br />
they were trying to put each other in headlocks. <br />
<br />
&quot;You weak little piece of shit!&quot; Matt said, having his brother in a headlock.<br />
<br />
Cole growled and tried to get out of it, but he was sort of stuck. He wasn't going to give up <br />
that easily, though. Instead, he pulled Matt backwards, slamming him into the television <br />
as hard as he could.<br />
<br />
The television fell off of the stand and broke -- the screen shattered, and all that was <br />
within seemed quite squashed.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the fuck did you do that for!?&quot; Matt screamed, furious.<br />
<br />
&quot;You were the one who fell on it, fat ass!&quot; Cole retorted.<br />
<br />
&quot;I... I can't stand you! You're such a weak piece of crap! I can't believe you're even my <br />
brother!&quot; Matt screamed, storming off to his room in a rage.<br />
<br />
Cole wasn't hurt by the words -- in fact they just made him angrier. He too stormed off to <br />
his room and lied down on his bed. He wished that he could be much bigger than his <br />
brother, but that didn't seem like it was possible. How was he going to go through life like <br />
this?<br />
<br />
He looked over to his bedside table, seeing the packet with the pill in it. He had no idea <br />
what it would do, but at this point he was desperate for anything. Maybe it would drive <br />
him into a homicidal frenzy and cause him to kill Matt -- who knew what would happen.<br />
<br />
He opened the packet and dry swallowed the pill. At first, nothing happened. He figured it <br />
was some sort of practical joke someone had played... it most likely was a sugar pill, or <br />
something.<br />
<br />
After a few minutes that changed. <br />
<br />
He suddenly got a very uncomfortable, raging hard on. It was out of no where -- in his <br />
current mood he wouldn't be turned on so randomly, so what the hell did it? Did he take <br />
viagra or something?<br />
<br />
Well, he realized that maybe jacking off would do him some good. Not only did he feel <br />
incredibly horny, but he figured that if he masturbated it'd help him relax and calm down.<br />
<br />
He adjusted his package through his jeans -- geez, getting a boner this big was quite <br />
uncomfortable when wearing jeans!<br />
<br />
The second he touched it, sparks of immense pleasure shot up through his body. It was as <br />
if he just ejaculated -- but he didn't! His cock was still hard, and he just lightly touched it <br />
through his pants.<br />
<br />
Cole was too horny to even worry about his jeans at the moment. Reaching down with a <br />
hand, he began to massage and rub at his crotch through his pants. It felt so good... his <br />
cock felt bigger than ever -- he couldn't believe it.<br />
<br />
It didn't take long for him to have an orgasm. He felt his cock spurt multiple times, and an <br />
obvious wet spot was forming in the groin of his pants. He wasn't embarrassed by it -- in <br />
fact, he thought it was hot! <br />
<br />
Then something else happened. Something very out of the blue. Cole began to feel his <br />
body tingle all over -- it felt good, but very strange and foreign to him.<br />
<br />
After a while he felt his clothing get a little tighter. Maybe he was just having trouble <br />
breathing after having an orgasm that amazing? He wasn't sure...<br />
<br />
Once again his doubts were proven wrong. The tingling began to increase, and his <br />
clothing felt even tighter now.<br />
<br />
In reality, Cole's entire body was growing more muscular. His legs, his arms, his chest, his <br />
neck, and even his cock were all growing now. <br />
<br />
The once slightly baggy shirt he had on was now quite tight. His nipples were completely <br />
erect, and visible through his shirt. The sleeves of his shirt were having a little bit of <br />
trouble containing his much larger biceps, too. His chest was actually sticking out now, <br />
visible through the shirt.<br />
<br />
His jeans were also much tighter. While they weren't too baggy before, now they were <br />
quite tight. His legs had grown quite a bit and were bulging out now -- his cock wasn't <br />
helping out, either. Before it was an average 6 inches erect, but now it had to have been 7 <br />
inches.<br />
<br />
&quot;Holy fuck...&quot; Cole said, running his hands over his stomach, feeling his defined, hard, <br />
sexy muscles. Unlike his brother, he was a little hairy, but he still felt incredibly hot.<br />
<br />
He thought he was hallucinating until he looked down and into a mirror to see that his <br />
cock was visibly bigger -- one couldn't fake that too well, after all! He just realized <br />
something, though; he was still horny.<br />
<br />
Even if he was unaware how the changes occurred, he didn't care, he had to jack off again. <br />
Seeing his sexy body was enough to make him practically cum, but he figured he'd put in <br />
a little more effort now. Unzipping his fly and letting his shaft pop out, he began to stroke <br />
it.<br />
<br />
Once again, it only took a few minutes for him to blow his load -- this time it actually his <br />
the ceiling on the first spurt, then his shirt, and another big spurt onto the floor.<br />
<br />
It was happening again. The tingling sensation came back, faster this time, and he could <br />
feel his body expanding.<br />
<br />
His already impressive chest filled out his shirt even more now to the point where it <br />
looked like it was painted on. His arms were so big that if he flexed them the sleeves of <br />
his shirt would surely rip.<br />
<br />
He had to take the belt off of his jeans and undo the top part of them because his legs <br />
were getting so tremendously large, as was his cock.<br />
<br />
Once again, his cock gained another inch or so -- eight inches now. It was also getting <br />
quite thick. It never was soft, for some reason... always erect, always ready.<br />
<br />
Cole had gained at least three inches in height already, and a ton of muscle. He now knew <br />
what made this happened, too.<br />
<br />
Whatever was in that pill caused him to grow every time he blew a load. <br />
<br />
He was too excited to jack off more; he wanted to show his brother his new size and cock <br />
-- maybe he'd even get his little brother to help him out?<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, Matt, can you come here for a sec?&quot; Cole didn't realize it earlier but even his voice <br />
was deeper, manlier, and much sexier. He began to stroke his cock lazily with one meaty <br />
hand as he awaited his brother's arrival.</p>
