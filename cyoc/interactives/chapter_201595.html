<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>This chapter was inspired (loosely) by a comment someone made about the previous chapter during a discussion a long while back on the forums.  I figured, while I&#39;m updating the branch of Hypnotist&#39;s Coin I&#39;d been working on, why not throw in this little scene that wouldn&#39;t stop bouncing around in my head, as well?<br/>
<br/>
Also, it&#39;s probably obvious to most, but the characters&#39; attitudes and actions in this thread don&#39;t necessarily match how I plan to characterize them in my other thread.  Each branch is a little universe of its own.  Don&#39;t take this one too seriously.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Tom looked back at me, and the coin in my hand.  “Say, would you like me to change you, now?”<br />
<br />
I paused at the question.  I would have loved to try transforming, myself, sure, but with the coin, Tom changing me would put me at his mercy.  Not that I didn’t trust him; I’d known him a couple years now.  But nobody shows anyone every side of themselves.  On the other hand, the fact that the coin wouldn’t work through recordings meant my only hope of using it was MAYBE trying it in a mirror, and even assuming reflections could work when recordings didn’t, I’d need some way to actually give myself suggestions while still being in trance.  If I really wanted to try this out, I’d have to trust SOMEONE, and since Tom already trusted me, why shouldn’t I trust him?<br />
<br />
I held out the coin to him.  “Alright,” I said.  “I’ll let you change me.  Just, remember to make the change triggerable, okay?  I’d like to be able to flip to my fursona and back at will, not to have to have someone around each time.”<br />
<br />
“Sure, sure,” he said, taking it.  He held the top of the string, letting the coin drop to the bottom, a wide smile creeping up his face as my eyes were slowly drawn to its steady, back and forth motion.  Thoughts and… worries… seeming… further and further… away…  <br />
<br />
There was just…<br />
<br />
The coin…<br />
<br />
Swinging back…<br />
<br />
And forth…<br />
<br />
Back…<br />
<br />
Forth…<br />
<br />
Thoughts… barely there…<br />
<br />
Tom’s voice rang out clearer, stronger than my own thoughts.<br />
<br />
“Alright, sleep now. Relax and listen to me…”  I heard him laughing softly.  I smiled.  It was good that he was happy…<br />
<br />
“I’ll turn you into your fursona eventually,” he said, “but you can’t blame me for wanting to have a little fun with some eye candy, can you?”<br />
<br />
No, I couldn’t blame him…  He’d turn me eventually, after all..<br />
<br />
“So one of the things you mentioned earlier got me thinking, and we’re gonna have a little fun with it.”<br />
<br />
I would like to have fun…<br />
<br />
“You’re starting to turn into a Vulpamon right now.  Just imagine it, and feel it happen.”<br />
<br />
I nodded, picturing what Vulpamon looked like while the change came over me, my body getting thinner as sand-colored fur began to sprout from my skin, all over my back and sides, with a patch of white on the front of my chest.  I felt my thighs grow a little thicker, and my arms become narrower, as the sandy fur began to poke through them, my body feeling warmer and warmer as the fur covered them completely, drowning out my old, human skin.<br />
<br />
Even with the coin demanding all my focus, I still felt giddy as I felt myself changing more and more.  It was really happening!  It was so good of Tom to do this!  I’d have to thank him, by obeying whatever he told me!  It was only natural.<br />
<br />
White fur grew over my hands and feet as the digits on both of them became much thicker, each finger and toe’s nails vanishing as short black claws poked out to replace them.  A pinkie shrank away on each hand, as did the little toe on each foot, and yet, despite my fewer and chunkier digits, I knew, somehow, that my hands would still be dexterous.  Because I was becoming a Vulpamon, and she’d never had trouble holding things in the show.<br />
<br />
As I felt my toes curl down, and leathery pads form on the balls of my feet, my shoes began to feel very uncomfortable.  Tom seemed to notice, as his next command was “Take off your human clothes, a Vulpamon like you doesn’t need them.”<br />
<br />
He was right, of course, so, I started by untying my shoes and slipping them and my socks off.  I felt no worry as I started to feel my penis shrinking, even before I started to undo my pants.  I was becoming a virtua-mon, and they didn’t reproduce sexually.  I’d have no need for it.<br />
<br />
My spine started to grow as I slid my pants off, extending an arm’s length behind my, thin and pale at first, before quickly sprouting out fluffy, sand-colored fur, tipped with white.  As I pulled my shirt up over my head, that too, began to change, my face taking an angular shape as my jaws and nose pulled forward into a pointed snout, my teeth sharpening at the same time my nose turned black and wet.  A fluffy mane of fur grew around my neck, draping over my chest.  Like the rest of my body, my head was rapidly covered in fur, my human hair getting lost amid the growing fluff.  My ears moved up the sides of my head as they grew longer and longer, rising to points.<br />
<br />
As my eyes turned a deep green shade, I reached up above my head, and, out of nowhere, pulled a green ninja mask down over my face, the one article of clothing Vulpamon did wear in the show.<br />
<br />
My change complete, my focus… returned to Tom… and the coin…<br />
<br />
“Well…  That’s kinda boring…”<br />
<br />
Oh…  Did I...  Disappoint Tom…?  But I…  Had become Vulpamon… Just like… in the show…<br />
<br />
“Okay, how about this; you’re becoming a sexy, fantasy Vulpamon, like one you’d see on FurAffection.”<br />
<br />
I shivered slightly, thinking back to some of my favorite Vulpamon pics, fully displaying not only her foxy allure, but her power, and already felt a change start to come over me.  I felt a straining sensation in each of my muscles as my body started getting taller, my arms and legs subtly bulking up as I felt new strength flowing into me.  they continued to grow, more defined, soon becoming clearly visible under my fur.   I couldn’t help but moan softly as the blank, furry spot between my legs opened up into a sensitive slit, while fat began to build up in two mounds on my chest, rapidly swelling up to become nearly as large as my head.  <br />
<br />
Even as the changes slowed, and my mind returned to the coin, I couldn’t help but enjoy being a perfect picture of both strength and sensuality.<br />
<br />
“Okay, now THAT’s better,” Tom’s voice said.<br />
<br />
He was happy…  Good…<br />
<br />
“I’m not normally one for amazons, but I don’t wanna be here all day tweaking things,” he mumbled, before saying more clearly, “you’ll take this form any time I say ‘virtua-time,’ and go back to being human, forgetting about what happened while you were changed when I say ‘human time.’  Also, while you’re a sexy Vulpamon, you’ll think like her, too, including seeing me as your trainer.”<br />
<br />
“Tamer,” I corrected.  Even hypnotized, I couldn’t let that common mix-up stand.<br />
<br />
“Er, right, you’ll see me as your tamer, and do what I ask.”<br />
<br />
I quickly returned my focus to getting into the mindset of Vulpamon, remembering the proud, stoic fighter from the show.  I focused on moving with calculated grace and efficiency, seeking greater and greater strength through battle with other virtua-mon, and bonding with my tamer.  I calmed myself, ensuring I didn’t let rage or fear dull my senses when the time came for combat.<br />
<br />
“Now, wake up,” he said, and I immediately did so, standing tall and alert.<br />
<br />
Still in wolf form, Tom stood in front of me, looking me up and down.  “Not bad, bad at all.  You look gorgeous!”  He stepped closer, a smile forming on his face.  “So, Vulpamon, how would you feel about a special ‘training’ session?”<br />
<br />
“That would be an excellent use of our time, my tamer.  Shall I practice lifting weights, running, proper kunai form, or-“<br />
<br />
His smile flattened into an unamused line.  “I wanted you to have sex with me.”<br />
<br />
“Sex?”  I raised an eyebrow.  Looking him over, my tamer looked fine, but even after being turned female, I still felt no attraction to him.  I put my hand to my chin.  Still…<br />
<br />
“That is an interesting proposal, my tamer.  While my glitched body does resemble a human female, I do not know if it is capable of true reproduction the way a human’s is.  Or if a human and a Virtua-Mon could even create a child together if I am capable of reproduction-”<br />
<br />
He interrupted me.  “Oh, believe me, not being able to have a kid is no problem for me.”<br />
<br />
“However,” I continued, “the possibility of leaving offspring that could employ both the strength of a Virtua-Mon and the tactical ability of a human, to say nothing of potentially being truly independent, with no need for a tamer to unlock it’s true potential, does intrigue me.”<br />
<br />
He grinned wide.  “Well, if you like the idea, let’s get going.  I was starting to worry this wouldn’t actually work!”  He stepped closer.<br />
<br />
I shut my eyes and held out a hand.  “Wait.” <br />
<br />
He stopped, and groaned.  “Ugh, what now?”<br />
<br />
“It is custom for most creatures that reproduce to have one member of the pair test the other’s worthiness as a potential mate, correct?”<br />
<br />
“Uh, yeah…”<br />
<br />
“Well then, my tamer, may I have permission to test you, first?  The qualifications to be a fitting mate are different from being a fitting tamer, after all.”<br />
<br />
He blinked, taken aback.  “Uh, sure, what kind of-”<br />
<br />
“Nature’s Cloak!”  I shouted, a tornado of leaves rose up around me, as my body turned invisible.  I rushed around behind him within seconds, reappeared, and grabbed him from behind.  He gave no resistance as I flipped him over my body, suplexing him to the floor.<br />
<br />
He barely had time to groan before I’d grabbed him by the shirt and lifted him up again, pinning him to the wall.<br />
<br />
“Leaf Kunai!”  I called.  In a greenish glow, a pointed leaf, firm and sharpened to a razor’s edge, appeared in my free paw, steadily holding it millimeters from his neck.<br />
<br />
I kept my breathing level as I waited for his counterplay, wanting to be certain the pained, panicked expression he wore as he gasped for breath weren&#39;t part of a feint.<br />
<br />
“I GIVE!”  He choked out.  “I GIVE!”<br />
<br />
I released my grip on him, muttering “no, that won’t do at all,” as he slowly recovered.<br />
<br />
I noticed the Coin of Control on the floor where Tom had stood a few moments earlier.  While I knew (and didn&#39;t, at the moment, care,) that my mindset was altered by hypnosis earlier, my memories had not, so I knew what it could do, and that I couldn’t afford to leave it there.  Quickly lifting it up, I pondered what to do with it.</p>
