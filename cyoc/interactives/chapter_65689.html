<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff finished choosing the options, and set his transformation to begin. Tomorrow, his <br />
uncle was taking his dad on a fishing trip, and he wasn't allowed to tag along. He had <br />
always secretly looked up to his uncle, and wanted to ensure he could go with them while <br />
being as close to the older man as possible.<br />
<br />
The Chronivac whirred as it began. Jeff had chosen to become a pair of sturdy waders. His <br />
dad and uncle would wade deep into the stream to do their fly fishing. He set the duration <br />
to last for the entire fishing trip so Jeff would be home to change back.<br />
<br />
Jeff thought about changing reality but he was curious to learn why he wasn't allowed to <br />
go. If he altered reality completely, he wouldn't have to explain where he disappeared to. If <br />
he didn't alter reality at all, his dad and uncle would probably talk about Jeff while on the <br />
fishing trip. So Jeff decided on a partial reality change. Everyone's memories of the past <br />
would stay intact but no one would question where Jeff disappeared to or where his uncle's <br />
new waders came from.<br />
<br />
Soon, he felt a tingling crawl across his skin. He stripped off his clothes, sitting down <br />
naked on a chair to watch the change progress. His skin began to feel dry, and he stroked <br />
his arm to notice it was tough and rubbery. A cold breeze made him shiver, and he <br />
touched his scalp to notice all his hair had fallen loose from his skin. As he brushed the <br />
hair free from his bare flesh, he realized he was beginning to feel stiff and numb.<br />
<br />
He looked down at his hands as his skin changed color, darkening to a deep greenish gray. <br />
He turned his hand backwards and forwards, watching as his nails faded into the rubbery <br />
flesh, his fingers closing together and fusing into a featureless lump.<br />
<br />
He shuddered as his legs tingled, closing together as the flesh began to merge, while at <br />
the same time his arms pressed to his sides and sank into his torso. The bottom of his <br />
fused feet began to feel heavy and hard, and he looked down to see them swell into a <br />
tough rubbery sole. His legs bent, becoming lighter as they hollowed, and with a pulling <br />
sensation he felt his lower body detach from his waist, and stared in shock as it stood free <br />
from his torso.<br />
<br />
His ass stretched, opening up and hollowing as it became the opening of a large green <br />
boot like shape in front of him. He barely noticed that the bottom of his torso where the <br />
separation had happened was now a rubbery sole. He tried to move, but all control of his <br />
body had faded. His mouth began to open wide against his control, spreading to cover his <br />
face as his head shrank into his shoulders. Then his mouth moved close to his asshole and <br />
connected. Finally his cock and balls stretched out to become the suspender like straps <br />
that would hold the waders up.<br />
<br />
Jeff was in shock at the feeling of his transformation, and slowly began to take stock. He <br />
couldn't move, but he could feel and see and smell, and his body was now in gangly and <br />
helpless. He was a pair of waders.<br />
<br />
A few hour passed before finally Jeff heard someone walk upstairs, by the weight coming <br />
down on the stairs he could tell it wasn't his mom or brother.<br />
<br />
The Door swings open and in stepped his uncle, wearing some old worn down sneakers, <br />
jeans and a shirt. Jim was always a stocky guy.. a real man.. lots of body hair and he was <br />
quite beefy.<br />
<br />
he looked down on the floor and spotted the waders. `Why'd I leave my waders in Jeff's <br />
room?` he said to nobody, tossing his heavy bag on the bed and grabbing Jeff in his <br />
fingers.<br />
<br />
Jeff panicked a bit, realizing he could smell his uncles strong musky feet already and those <br />
sneakers where not even off yet!. This was a stupid idea, why didn't he just change himself <br />
into a fishing rod or a hat.. gulping as Jim took one of his old sneakers off and started <br />
sliding his dark sock down into Jeff's mouth.<br />
<br />
Jeff wiggled faintly, able to feel, smell and even taste his uncles sweat and musk. Jim <br />
seemed to be happy, wiggling his toes inside as he pulled on Jeff up.<br />
<br />
Jeff cursed at himself for having this stupid plan. he always liked his uncle... but not <br />
enough to have his sweaty feet all the time in his face. Then he would have screamed if he <br />
could have as he felt the other socked foot enter his ass. Then Jeff felt his cock and balls <br />
being stretched over Jim's shoulders.<br />
<br />
Jim smiled and stood up, the weight of him pressing down into Jeff who was able to handle <br />
the weight. &quot;gotta walk these in a bit today. they are a little stiff&quot; he heard as his uncle <br />
headed downstairs.<br />
<br />
Well at least he would be joining his dad and uncle on the fishing trip tomorrow Jeff <br />
thought.<br />
<br />
Jeff's dad walked by and said, &quot;You're not wearing your waders commando the way you like <br />
to.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jim said, &quot;As I said, I don't want Jeff to see my stuff. I think it might scare him.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff then figured out at least one of his uncle's secrets but Jeff then realized that this secret <br />
would mean that he would feel his uncle's tackle in both his mouth and his asshole very <br />
soon.</p>
