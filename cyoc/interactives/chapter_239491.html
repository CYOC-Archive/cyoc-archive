<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Blaise turned to the audience, spreading his arms wide. &quot;Everyone give a big round of applause for our volunteer!&quot; The audience clapped excitedly, more than a few wolf whistles ringing through the air.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, we can&#39;t work with you like that.&quot; Blaise said simply, motioning to Ryan who&#39;s face scrunched up curiously. &quot;But it&#39;s an easy fix.&quot; He extended his hand, palm upwards and blew across it towards Ryan. Some sort of glitter flew threw the air, and where it touched his clothes it burst into flames. The fire didn&#39;t burn, well, not Ryan anyway. But his clothes were eaten by the glittery flames, disappearing in moments to leave the tall, thin Ryan standing there completely exposed. He started trying to cover himself with his hands, but a snap from Blaise made him drop his hands to his side.<br />
<br />
&quot;Perfect. Now, we just need to decide what our dear audience wants to see tonight. What kind of show do they want?&quot; Suggestions began flying from the audience, Ryan only caught a few things, some seem fine to him, like massive muscles, or porn star, others worried him such as the one who wanted a big belly and another that called out nipple-dicks. He wasn&#39;t even sure what those were but he could guess and it did not sound fun. But then Blaise snapped and pointed. &quot;A classic, and one I haven&#39;t been able to do in a long time! But always a fan favorite.&quot;<br />
<br />
Blaise interlaced his fingers and inverted his hands to crack his knuckles. &quot;First..&quot; He began to wave his hands, and pointed at Ryan, a blast of light hitting him right in the crotch. &quot;We need a big ol&#39; donkey dong, yes?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;D-donkey?&quot; Was all Ryan was able to get out before a tingling formed in his crotch. His balls began to grow first, swelling and dropping lower, the skin of his scrotum turning a deep black as they did, each one growing to the size of a lemon and hanging halfway down to his knees. HE little out a soft sound that sounded like a whimper, even as the crowd began to cheer, chanting, &quot;Don-key don-key don-key.&quot;<br />
<br />
Then his cock began to elongate, but this was a familiar feeling, he was getting hard. Except instead of stopping at his familiar six inches it kept going. The tip of his cock flattened inwards, the glans becoming crown shaped. It started to feel like invisible hands were stroking him off, making him gasp as he stumbled backwards and landed in a chair he was ninety percent positive hadn&#39;t been there a moment ago.<br />
<br />
Veins shifted along the length of his shaft as it started widening as well as growing longer. The skin turning a dark ebony like his scrotum. Halfway down the shaft, a ring popped out encircling his cock. Those invisible hands kept working his growing member, and all he could do was grip the side of his chair.  &quot;Uh.. um.. hee.. he.. heee.. HAW!&quot; He let out a donkey-like bray as his cock fired a thick sticky load across the stage and into the audience, splashing across the bare chest of a muscular man in the front row. The slim man next to him leaned over and began to eagerly clean the seed off his neighbor&#39;s chest, even as Ryan shot another load at the pair, the third simply splashed on the stage in front of him.<br />
<br />
Ryan was gasping for air, and even though he had come more powerfully than ever in his life, his cock stayed huge and rigid in front of him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Did you enjoy that, Ryan?&quot; Blaise asked as he came up behind him, putting his hands on his shoulders. Ryan wanted to shake his head no, but instead he bobbed it in the affirmative. &quot;Sorry about the braying, it&#39;s a side effect, but you&#39;ll get used to it, in fact, let&#39;s make him a little more donkey, shall we?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Upsidaisy!&quot; Blaise shouted as he grabbed Ryan by the ears and yanked upwards pulling him out of his seat, then pulled downwards on his ears, almost pulling Ryan&#39;s head back. Then he let go and Ryan felt his ears bounce back.. up? Ryan reached up and grabbed at his ears, which were now a foot long and covered in fuzz. No earlobes, the just sort of stuck out of his head. When he realized what happened, they flicked out of his grip and backwards of their own accord. The crowd was laughing at the sight.<br />
<br />
Ryan got so distracted he didn&#39;t notice Blaise run a hand down his spine and then grab at something just above his butt and yanked. He pulled so hard, Ryan practically doubled over, stumbling backwards a few steps with another involuntary, &quot;Heehaw!,&quot; then landing on his ass. He felt Blaise drop whatever it was he held and Ryan grabbed for it, pulling it around to look at it. The ropey tail was covered in grey fur and tipped with a black tassel of bristly hair. <br />
<br />
The audience was roaring, some laughing, some cheering, some.. well.. the sounds of sex were reaching his much more sensitive ears now. <br />
<br />
&quot;What next?! What next?!&quot; Blaise called out to the audience. Ryan scrambled to his feet, feeling the ears twitching on top of his head as he started catching shouted words from the audience.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shorter!&quot; &quot;Chubbier!&quot; &quot;Buffer!&quot; &quot;Taller!&quot; &quot;Twinkier!&quot; &quot;Furrier!&quot; He gulped a looked over to Blaise who was urging the audience on many of them echoing previous suggestions until only a few words were being shouted, then held out a hand for silence and a slight hush fell over the audience, though not completely.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think there were four winners there. Let&#39;s just go for the hat trick, shall we?&quot; Blaise turned to Ryan and snapped his fingers.<br />
<br />
Ryan let out another involuntary bray as he doubled over. He could see the ground getting closer as he lost height, but it seemed to make him stockier and more compact as he wasn&#39;t losing size, if anything he was growing. He watched his legs shorten even as they plumped up with more muscle, as did his arms. His feet and hands stayed almost the same size but seemed to get a bit wider. His cock also stayed the same, looking even bigger on his shorter frame. He was almost certain he could get his mouth to the wide flat tip not that he was about to try.<br />
<br />
His chest swelled as his pectorals puffed outwards, at first hard slabs of muscle, but then they began to soften, his nipples swelling in size and capping the rounded chest mounds. His stomach let out a small gurgle and puffed outwards with a bray and a blech. No six pack for him, he had a beer belly, firm and bouncy. He ran his hands over what had once been a perfectly flat stomach. Sure his chest had been flat too, but at least he had been slim. Now he was all thick muscle with a soft padding layer.<br />
<br />
He could feel his ass swelling behind him too, first with muscle then softening into large bouncy globes much like his pectorals. Black hair pushed out first in the middle of his chest and around his nipples, before meeting growing together in a short bristly patch of chest hair that covered his pecs, then grew down in a wide strip over his gut. He felt an itch along the side of his jaw and reached up to feel bristly sideburns growing in down to his jaw line. Between his ears his hair had turned black and spikey, sticking up brush-like as the itch of more growing in passed down his neck and over his spine to between his shoulder blades. More hair grew in his pits and on his arms and legs, all of it short and bristly.<br />
<br />
Blaise stepped close and he had to crane his neck a little to look up at the man. Blaise had been taller than him before, but he judged he had lost at least half a foot in height, maybe a couple inches more. &quot;A perfect donkey fire plug.&quot; Blaise intoned, tilted his head to the side, smirked, and corrected himself. &quot;An assplug? No.. not quite yet..&quot;<br />
<br />
The audience was cheering and calling out as Blaise walked around him. &quot;Needs more ass.. don&#39;t you think?&quot; HE said with a look of stage. There were affirmative cries in response. &quot;You may want to sit for this.&quot; Blaise said as he swiped a finger through the air, the chair coming from a few feet away and knocking into Ryan in the right way to make him plop down in it.<br />
<br />
Almost immediately his feet began to cramp up. His newly hairier legs got even more so, a thick coat of short grey fur spreading out along his thighs and down his shins. He could feel the itch as it grew in over his ass, and up past his cock to blend with the strip over his belly.<br />
<br />
The joints of his legs were twisting about, his thighs growing shorter and even thicker as his calves shortened as well. His feet elongated as his toes began to fuse into a pair of solid black hooves. Blaise stepped forward and pressed a hand against Ryan&#39;s rock hard shaft, pushing it against his belly and between his pecs and sure enough the flat head of the cock came right up to his lips, the smell musky and animal like, and.. it made him want to..<br />
<br />
He opened his mouth, somehow wrapping his lips around the wide head of his cock, but not able to take much more, his tongue ran against his slit, making him shiver. Blaise whispered into his ear. &quot;You don&#39;t need your smarts anymore. You have two jobs around here, fucking and manual labor.&quot; Ryan let out a muffled sound of agreement as he continued to work on his own shaft, bringing up his hands to rub at it as he continued to tease the head with his tongue. He felt his thoughts slowing, like everything was moving through syrup. He remembered who he was, but a lot of those memories didn&#39;t make much sense anymore. He may be short, but he knew he was strong, a sexy, stocky, beast of burden.<br />
<br />
He didn&#39;t even notice as his facial features shifted slightly, still human but donkey like, with a wide nose and big teeth, almost muzzle like, and big brown eyes looking out somewhat dully from under thick brows.<br />
<br />
Blaise put his hands on Ryan&#39;s shoulders and leaned in whispering. &quot;I know you like this new form, but there&#39;s a part of you in there still fighting.&quot; Ryan looked up, the voice in his head was quiet, shoved far back, but indeed, it wasn&#39;t happy with this turn of events now that he could once again hear it. Like a gag had been removed from a hostage. &quot;And I do like a game.&quot; Blaise&#39;s breath was warm in Ryan&#39;s ear as he spoke in a soft whisper that Ryan still heard despite the crowd cheering on his self-felatio. &quot;Seven hours to sun rise, by then, get at least seven guys to fuck you in the ass and I&#39;ll return your mind and make you human again.&quot; Blaise hummed. &quot;A little too easy, the way the audience is looking at you like a steak. One of those seven has to be one of the two friends you came here with. Roy or John, right?&quot; Ryan nodded. &quot;Good, do we have a deal?&quot; Ryan nodded, perhaps a bit too eagerly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I&#39;m a generous host, so let&#39;s get you a head start.&quot; Blaise stood and spread his arms wide to the audience. &quot;And now, for the best part of the night!&quot; In a flash of flames, Blaise&#39;s clothes vanished, leaving the man bare to the world. Though his skin had turned a deep red, and horns curled back from his brow. The flames roiled across the audience, burning away what clothes still remained on them, tables and chairs flying away to the sides of the room as pillow and cushions of all sizes fell to the ground between the gasping, shocked audience.<br />
<br />
There was a whistle from Blaise and the performers came out from backstage, moving out to mingle among the audience, and soon little pockets of sex were beginning to break out here and there, couples, threesomes, a few larger groups. The three werewolves had found themselves a pair of muscle bears to play with, one of which had been wearing the remains of a torn, frilly, floral top until it had been burned away.<br />
<br />
A ring of pillows appeared on the stage with an excellent view of the festivities breaking out in the once audience. And with a beckoning finger, Ryan went over to meet him, clomping on hooves. &quot;Come here my sweet donkey, I&#39;m going to be the first of the seven.&quot;</p>
