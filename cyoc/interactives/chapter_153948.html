<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><br />
Yuriko had been trailing behind the group as they went from house to house. A small smirk spread across the teens face as she watched Gloria and the others, they looked like they were having the time of their lives. That changed quickly though as Yuriko saw as Jackie answered her cellphone. The young girl had a concerned look on her face before rapidly ageing into adulthood and vanishing. “Crap where’s she going,” Yuriko thought. The teen bit her lip in frustration, she needed to keep an eye on Gloria and her friends. How could she be in two places at once.<br />
<br />
Yuriko sighed, while she couldn’t ask her family or friends for assistance from the future, she wasn’t without a few allies. Reaching into her pocket, Yuriko produced a small coin. A coin engraved with a wolf on one side and a witches hat on the other. “God I hope this works,” she thought. Pressing down on the coin firmly, Yuriko watched as it admitted a soft glow. In only a moment Yuriko was relieved to see a woman with sandy brown hair and a large man with dark hair appear. “Mia, Zack am I glad to see you.”<br />
<br />
The adult Mia and Zack blinked, trying to get their barings before smiling at the young teen. “Yuriko,” Mia said happily. “Wow great to see.”<br />
<br />
“Great to see you too,” Yuriko smiled. “Really need your help.”<br />
<br />
“So what’s going on Yuki,” Zack asked as he gazed around the neighborhood curiously. “And what exactly is going on? This place seems....really familiar.” Yuriko rubbed her neck sheepishly as the newly wed couple gazed at their surroundings. Slowly their eyes began to widen as they noticed not only a rejuvenated Gloria and friends, but their last 10 year old selves as well.<br />
<br />
“Yuki,” Zack said slowly. “Did...did we time travel?”<br />
<br />
“Um kinda,” Yuriko said sheepishly. Mia glowered at the young teen in an almost motherly fashion as she watched her past self rAce towards another house. “Yuriko,” she hissed. “You know how dangerous time travel is! Didn’t you learn anything from Lynne and your brother last year!”<br />
<br />
“Mia I can explain,” Yuriko said quickly. “Better make it fast kiddo,” Zack frowned. Yuriko gulped as she looked up at Zack. The wolfman stood at a massive 6’5” and was rippling with muscle. For Yuriko it seemed that anytime Zack got annoyed his wolffish features would rise to the surface. “Okay I’m sorry,” Yuriko whined. “But Merlin asked me too. He said he needed to keep an eye on things here, so he sent me back to keep an eye on the past.”<br />
<br />
Mia sighed heavily, while she was on friendly terms with Merlin and the rest of Yuriko friends and family, she was often kept out of the loop because of her relationship with Rexie and Ayami. “You know it really bugs me when he decides to use kids to achieve his goals,” she groaned. Taking a deep breath she now forced a smile as she looked at Yuriko. “Okay Yuki guessing you need our help.”<br />
<br />
Yuriko smiled, thanking the young couple before explaining what she needed to do. Yuriko trusted the young couple completely, they had always looked out for the teen. Yuriko would even say that they were like family to her. As she now explained what was going on and Jackie’s disappearance Mia and Zack nodded. “Okay Yuki,” she said. “Tell you What why don’t you and Zack follow Jackie, I’ll keep an Gloria and the others.”<br />
<br />
“Honey You sure,” Zack asked.<br />
<br />
“Absolutely,” Mia smiled. “Besides Rexie is my familiar. Yeah she’s connected to the past version of me but she still bound to my control. If anything goes sideways I’ll be able to control her.” Mia now gestured towards her wrist, an almost translucent chain leading from her wrist to Rexie. Stepping forward she now stood on tiptoe as she gave her husband a gentle peck on the cheek. “Hey you be careful okay.” Zack smiled and nodded as he and Yuriko vanished.<br />
<br />
As Zack and Mia now appeared, the two gazed at their surrounding. “A hospital,” Yuriko said in confusion. “Why is she coming here?” Zack smirked, tapping the girl on the shoulder as he pointed towards the front door. A now adult Ann was helping Ann inside the emergency room. “Guess Ann got hurt,” Zack stated. “Geez even back then those two were inseparable. Only question is, how do we keep an eye on them.”<br />
<br />
Mia winced slightly as an idea now came to her head, a very bad idea. Mumbling a spell the teen now summoned a silver bat, which she proceeded to strike Zack in the head with. “Owww,” Zack whined. “Damn it Yuki what the hell!”<br />
<br />
“Sorry,” the teen replied blushing. “It was the only thing I could think of. On the plus side though, at least your bleeding.” Zack removed his hand from his eyebrow, noticing a small amount of blood on his hand. “Oh awesome thanks,” he grumbled. “Still pretty pointless though, you know I regenerate too quickly.”<br />
<br />
“That’s why I used silver,” Yuriko replied. “Now come on before it heals.” Zack grumbled in response as the two now headed towards the emergency room.<br />
<br />
Jackie sighed as she now sat down next to Ann, their were a few forms she needed to fill out before Ann would be seen. As she now sat next to the woman she could see a small smile on Ann’s face. “So I have to ask Angel,” Ann giggled. “What’s with the cute costume.”<br />
<br />
Jackie blushed as she gazed at her Belle costume. “Oh,” she blushed. “Well, me and the girls were out trick or treating when you called. Kind of a girls not only, no boyfriends or girlfriends.”<br />
<br />
“Well it’s beautiful,” Ann smiled before wincing. “You doing okay darling,” Jackie asked. Ann nodded as she gazed down at her ankle, she had yet to take her boot off but she could feel it throbbing. “Yeah I’m fine,” she said. “Just did a number on my ankle. Probably end up on crutches.”<br />
<br />
“Well I can help you anytime you need me Ann,” Jackie said quickly. Ann smiled warmly as she placed a hand on her magically aged up girlfriend. “I know Jackie,” she said. “And I always love spending time with me but you don’t have to worry about me all the time, I’m a grown woman.”<br />
<br />
“I know Ann but I love you,” Jackie said lovingly.<br />
<br />
“And I love you too,” Ann smiled. “But I hate to see you worry or see your grades slip.”<br />
<br />
Jackie blushed, a small frown crossing her face. “So I’m the second best student,” Jackie grumbled. “So what. Your the one that matters not my stupid school work.”<br />
<br />
Ann gave Jackie a sincere look as she now squeezed her girlfriends hands tightly. “And what kind of a girlfriend would I be if I put my needs before yours,” she said. “I girl I got to know when we first met was studious, smart and driven. She wouldn’t of settled for second.”<br />
<br />
Jackie opened her mouth before closing it. Ann had a point, she was driven to succeed. She had let her relationship with Ann though complete overtake her life. Jackie sighed as she sadly looked into Ann’s eyes. “Does this mean we have to break up?”<br />
<br />
“Oh god I hope not,” Ann exclaimed. “All I’m saying is focus on school a little more Jackie. I’m not going anywhere and I’ll be waiting for you.”<br />
<br />
Jackie nodded before taking a deep breath and leaning into her girlfriend. “Okay Angel I promise.”<br />
<br />
“You know this doesn’t need mean I don’t want you to stop seeing me right,” Ann said happily. “I mean if I’m going to be layed up I’m going to need a little extra help. Besides, really wAnt to see you in that costume, say in our bedroom?” Jackie couldn’t help but chuckle as she gave Ann a kiss. “You tease,” she laughed. Ann and Jackie sighed contentedly as they noticed a large muscular man sit across from them with a teenage girl at his side. Jackie couldn’t help but find the girls face familiar yet she had other concerns at the moment, she needed to do well not only for herself but for Ann.</p>
