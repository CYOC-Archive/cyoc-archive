<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Marcus followed Allison&#39;s suggestion. He took the two little dice in his mighty hand and threw them onto the board.<br />
&quot;Seven.&quot; Allison said as she didn&#39;t know if Marcus could see his own roll thanks to his massive pecs.<br />
He took his player and moved seven spaces. Once again, he landed on a blank spot. He drew another card and was positively shocked and excited for the changes to come.<br />
<br />
&quot;Be the titan you&#39;ve always dreamed to be with a couple of rolls... and an extra turn!<br />
First roll: Gain Height in inches.<br />
Second roll: Gain additional bulge<br />
Third roll: First dice - Second dice = Muscle Mass Multiplyer<br />
Fourth roll: Your Maximum Strength is increased/reduced to be able to lift one of the following objects based on your roll: 2: Feather, 3: Soda Bottle,  4: Cat, 5: Watermelon, 6: Punching Bag, 7: Pig, 8: Cow, 9: Elephant, 10: Blue Whale, 11: Sierra Redwood Tree, 12: Eiffel Tower.<br />
<br />
Marcus absolutely loved the first three roles but feared the last one. Even if he was a titan currently, he could lose all his strength until he could only support himself and lift a feather extra as his max. He would have huge muscles with no strength to back them up.<br />
Nervously, Marcus did the first three dice rolls.<br />
<br />
First roll: 6+3 = 9 Inches in Height<br />
Second roll: 2+3 = 5 Inches in his Crotch<br />
Third roll: 5-3 = 2, Doubling his Muscle Mass<br />
<br />
While he certainly had higher rolls before, the most important roll was coming up just now. He was faking a chilled face, but internally he was fearing the potential outcome to all of this. Josh was maybe right, he was having too much luck. With high hopes, he threw the dice and was rewarded with...<br />
<br />
Fourth roll: 6+5 = 11, Making him strong enough to lift a Sierra Redwood Tree, which is almost 3,000,000 pounds heavy!<br />
<br />
Marcus couldn&#39;t beleive it. Not only was he about to get bigger than ever, but he would soon be sooo much stronger than he currently is. And he is already dangerously strong now.<br />
But Marcus didn&#39;t have much time to revel in that though as his first change just began.<br />
<br />
With a feeling as if he was constantly stretching, his height shot upwards, making the already quite tall 6&#39;3&quot; man a falt 7 feet tall.<br />
As he looked down at his four friends, he noticed his small member rapidly changing in size. The feeling was so amazing that he had a hard-on almost instantly. His above average, 6 inch stick rose higher and up to his abs, not stopping the growth until it was 11 inches long and a bit thicker.<br />
He was almost about to cum since his next change was already happening. Somehow more intense than last time, his massive muscles exploded with size, surging larger and bigger until he sported twice his previous mass. After it ended, he was a coloss. His flexed arms rose higher than his own head, having to look up to see the peak. His pecs have tranformed into a full-on table for him to eat on. His newfound, diamond-hard 10-pack, which stood out multiple inches, was fully surrounded by equally inpressive and toned obliques. His legs fought for space on his tall body, using what little space they had left to be able to move. By now, he was a good chunk heavier than half a ton. Thankfully his incredibly dense body wasn&#39;t weighing extra.<br />
<br />
Speaking of dense, his body had to go through one last gigantuan change. The density and strength of his muscles doubled and re-doubled within seconds. The feeling of it was so incredible that he was lost in joy. Soon Marcus&#39; muscles were harder than anything on earth. As the change finally subsided, Marcus felt like the epitome of pure strength, which he was!<br />
<br />
His impossibly huge arms possessed strength noone could ever guess unless they saw it themselves. He wasn&#39;t just extremely strong anymore, he was superhuman. He knew that he had to be careful from now on, else he could accidentally destroy a building with one sweep of his tremendous, superpowered arm.<br />
<br />
While Kenneth and Jill were quiet as always, Josh knew he had lost the game, literally. He didn&#39;t even think that any card had the ability to take away what he just gained. Even Allison had second thoughts. While she was still horny as can be, she knew that giving somebody this much power, no matter if good or evil, was a bad, baaad idea...</p>
