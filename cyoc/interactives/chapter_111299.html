<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Half way to the bathroom Jesse got an idea. Nick was probably at work right now, bored out of his mind, so why not make his day a little more interesting, just as a joke?&#8232;&#8232;<br />
<br />
&quot;Excuse me for a sec,&quot; Jesse said quickly, hurrying over to the computer. He had just gotten a great idea and wanted to see if it was possible before he forgot it.&#8232;&#8232;<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
&#8232;&#8232;Nick was working a weird not quite full day because Samantha, one of the girls who worked with him had called in sick. He knew Samantha wasn&#39;t really sick, that she called in at least twice a month when the weather was nice, but Nick wasn&#39;t the sort to complain, especially when it had him working the same hours as Maxine. Ever since he had started working at the used book store two years ago he had a crush on Maxine, but hadn&#39;t been able to get the courage up to ask her out. He didn&#39;t even know if she was even interested in him, which was part of the reason he was afraid to say anything about dating to her. The last thing he wanted was to bring up the topic only to find that she had no interest in him. Jesse might have laughed at him for creating such a problem for himself, but Nick preferred hope of a possibility than finding out with certainty that it would never happen.<br />
<br />
&#8232;&#8232;Maxine was working at cash register, ringing up what looked like an entire set of encyclopedias that a little old woman had purchased. Nick was going back and forth between the shelves and the back room, trying to figure out how to fill in the newly empty space where all the books the woman had bought had been. There were plenty of books in the back room, but he couldn&#39;t just put in a random jumble of books in the reference section, not if he wanted to keep his job.&#8232;<br />
<br />
&#8232;He had just about solved the problem, having found a set of books on World War Two history and a really old but nice looking illustrated children&#39;s dictionary when his cellphone buzzed, letting him know that he had a text message.&#8232;&#8232;<br />
<br />
Curious at who would be texting him at work he took out his phone and frowned. It was from Jesse and all it said was, &#39;ha ha&#39;.<br />
<br />
&#8232;&#8232;Nick shook his head. It was typical, Jesse was always up to some sort of joke or another and it looked like he had started something. He knew that he was going to have to stay on his toes when he got home to keep from walking right into it.<br />
<br />
&#8232;&#8232;Stopping for a moment to adjust his crotch, Nick put his phone away and went back to stocking the shelves. Double checking the amount of space on the shelf one last time, he went to the back room to pull out the box of books he had found to put out. Maxine was still helping the same customer and it looked like she was going to have to help carry her purchase out so she wouldn&#39;t be able to help him, not that it bothered him. Things were slow enough right now that every little bit of work helped to make the time pass faster.<br />
<br />
&#8232;&#8232;As he walked out of the back room he adjusted how he was carrying the box. He must have picked it up at a really awkward angle or something because it was really pressing hard against his pecs. Something was odd, no matter how he shifted the weight of the box it was still awkward. He also found that it was easier to carry the boxes the more he adjusted.<br />
<br />
&#8232;&#8232;Once he got to the shelves he put the box down and shrugged his shoulders, feeling the weight of his pecs as they bounced up and down. The pressure still remained and his pecs felt, well, not exactly tender, but maybe more sensitive and possibly thicker and plumper.<br />
<br />
&#8232;&#8232;He looked up and caught Maxine looking at him. When their eyes met she smiled at him. He smiled back, a thrill of excitement running through him. Maybe today was the day that she would ask him out, sparing him from having to make a stand and ask her.<br />
<br />
&#8232;&#8232;Nick began to take the books out of the box, his arm brushing across his chest as he reached to put the dictionary on the shelf. The slight contact sent another shiver through him. Yes, there was no doubt about it, his pecs seemed more sensitive. He could actually feel how tight his shirt felt against them and the way his nipples were pressing against the cotton, smooth fabric of his undershirt. When he looked down it came as no surprise to see that his nipples were hard, poking up and visible through his shirt. The thing was, he could never remember them being as obvious as they were now. Not quite certain of what he was seeing meant, he gently brushed a hand across his chest, feeling the hardness of his nipples and gasping as a rush of warmth flowed straight to his cock.<br />
<br />
&#8232;&#8232;Blushing, he tried to focus on putting the rest of the books of the shelves and ignore how impossibly horny he was getting, but he began to notice the way the muscles in his arms and pecs strained, bounced, and popped against his tight shirt was making it harder and harder to focus on the task at hand. The fact how tight his shirt and his pants felt didn&#39;t help at all. Every slight touch and little bounce against his pecs, and surprisingly his ass, sent another jolt of pleasure through him, going from his pecs or ass to his cock, making it feel so hard.<br />
<br />
&#8232;&#8232;Focused as he was on ignoring his growing arousal, he failed to notice that Maxine had finished helping the customer and had come back to the shelves until she spoke.<br />
<br />
&#8232;&#8232;&quot;Hey, how&#39;s it going?&quot;<br />
<br />
&#8232;&#8232;Nick&#39;s eyes went wide at the sound of her voice and he stood up straight to look at her.<br />
<br />
&#8232;&#8232;&quot;I&#39;m good,&quot; he stammered, the way she was looking at him making her blush. His nipples and dick were still rock hard, pressing almost painfully against his shirt and pants and he was sure that she had noticed. Embarrassed, he tried to fold his arms across his chest, tried being the key word. No matter how he positioned them, his pecs seemed to be in the way and when he looked down, no longer able to meet Maxine’s eyes, he could see why. His pecs had grown.<br />
<br />
&#8232;&#8232;They had gone from being a fairly average palm-size to what could only be described as the size of basketballs. Even his nipples were bigger. And that wasn’t all. His arms looked like there were footballs stuffed inside, his shoulders were massive, he could almost feel how much his ass had grown, and he could feel his dick throb at the sight of the man meat. Wait, why would the sight of his own body turn him on?<br />
<br />
&#8232;&#8232;&quot;You sure?&quot; Maxine said quickly, &quot;Because you went really pale all of a sudden.&quot;<br />
<br />
&#8232;&#8232;&quot;I did?&quot; he said weakly, worried about her noticing his sudden growth spurt, &quot;I mean I... I guess I need to sit down for a sec.&quot;<br />
<br />
All at once it had clicked into place and he understood what was going on, what Jesse&#39;s joke was.<br />
<br />
&#8232;&#8232;Not waiting for a response he hurried to the back room, feeling his bubble butt and pecs heave and bounce with every step he took. Closing the door behind him he pulled out his cell phone and called Jesse.<br />
<br />
&#8232;&#8232;His friend picked up after the second ring, laughing uncontrollably.&#8232;&#8232;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s not funny,&quot; Nick fumed, &quot;What did you do?&quot;<br />
<br />
&#8232;&#8232;&quot;Some stuff,&quot; Jesse said between fits of laughter, &quot;Don&#39;t worry I set it so you and me are the only ones who know…” He trailed off as if he were about to say more but didn’t.&#8232;<br />
<br />
&#8232;&quot;Change me back now,&quot; Nick hissed, not seeing any humor in the situation.&#8232;&#8232;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t, not yet,&quot; he kept laughing, &quot;Not until the changes are done.&quot;<br />
<br />
&#8232;&#8232;&quot;What?&quot; Nick almost squeaked, &quot;There&#39;s more?&quot;<br />
<br />
&#8232;&#8232;&quot;Yeah. Just have fun with them. Trust me, you&#39;ll like it!&quot; &#8232;&#8232;After that there was more laughter.<br />
<br />
&#8232;&#8232;Furious and embarrassed Nick turned off the phone and looked down at himself. His pecs, ass, and muscles were still getting bigger, or at least she thought they were. It was kind of hard to tell, especially when his eyes were drawn to his nipples. They were just so embarrassingly big, probably a quarter an inch long. Unable to help himself, he ran his fingers over them, feeling how hard they were and how sensitive they were. Despite his anger and fear he felt his dick starting to harden again.&#8232;&#8232;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; he said softly to himself, putting his hands down to his sides, &quot;I can handle this.&quot; &#8232;&#8232;Taking several deep breaths to calm down he marched over to the door and went back into the store.<br />
<br />
&#8232;&#8232;Maxine was waiting at the door for him, &quot;Feeling better?&quot;<br />
<br />
&#8232;&#8232;He forced himself to smile, &quot;Yeah. I don&#39;t know what came over me for a second there.&quot;<br />
<br />
&#8232;&#8232;&quot;Mmmhmm,&quot; she nodded, her eyes flickering down to his crotch for a moment before she smiled, &quot;I&#39;m glad you&#39;re okay. You had me worried for a second.&quot;<br />
<br />
&#8232;&#8232;Self consciously, he brought his arms to try and cover his crotch, inadvertently squeezing his pecs, &quot;I&#39;m okay.&quot;<br />
<br />
&#8232;&#8232;&quot;Good,&quot; she gave an awkward little laugh before going back over to the cash register.<br />
<br />
&#8232;&#8232;Nick went back to finish putting the books on the shelf, unable to help letting out the occasional gasp as he moved in a way that caused his ass to bounce a bit too hard. It felt so good that his dick was practically aching for attention. He could actually feel himself starting to get leak precum.<br />
<br />
&#8232;&#8232;Finally he finished with the shelves. Looking up he again saw that Max had been watching him as he worked and again he blushed, this time because thoughts of him sucking on his big, achingly hard dick sprung unbidden to his mind. He again forced himself to smile at him and the way he smiled back at him again sent a thrill running through him, this time accompanied by a little spurt of moisture from his dick.<br />
<br />
This was the part Jesse hadn’t told him, the changes that he wouldn’t notice. Gone was the beautiful, blonde college girl known as Maxine. Nick did not notice that the object of his affection was now a strikingly handsome, tall, dark-haired man known as Max who was on the college gymnastics team. Nick found that Max’s piercing blue eyes and the way the gymnast’s body bulged in all of the right places, especially the particular bulge front and center, made the images in Nick’s head more challenging to dispel. Nick particularly did not notice either that he now found himself extremely attracted to men.<br />
<br />
&#8232;&#8232;Still smiling he went to the bathroom and locked the door behind him. As soon as he turned on the light his smile fell and he let out a heavy sigh. &#8232;&#8232;Afraid of what he would see, he turned to look at himself in the mirror.<br />
<br />
His pecs had ballooned out to ridiculous proportions so that it looked like he had a pair of watermelons under his shirt, their inch long nipples sticking straight out, tenting his shirt. His shoulders were nearly was wide as the mirror, and the muscles in his arms rivaled those on a bodybuilder’s. At least his shirt had changed with his growing torso so that it kept him covered, even if it was so tight that it did practically nothing to conceal what was beneath. A similar thing had occurred further south. His thighs looked as thick as tree trunks, his feet were at least size 16, and his ass was so round that it looked like a classroom globe had been stuffed in his tight pants. The strange thing was, as horrifying as the change was to him, he still felt incredibly sexy. The way his huge ass moved when he walked actually turned him on. His dick felt so hard and bulged and throbbed so obscenely visible just from looking at his reflection that he realized that something had to be different there too.<br />
<br />
&#8232;&#8232;Pulling down his pants and then his sodden jockstrap (that’s new, he thought) he looked at his clean shaven crotch and dick. Its large head was flush pink and swollen and throbbing with arousal, glistening with moisture. His dick had to be at least a foot long. He turned and looked at his ass. The cheeks were silky smooth and shown brightly in the light, his hole looking ready to be parted by a big, hard cock.&#8232;&#8232;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh,&quot; he sighed softly at the thought, his precum flowing in anticipation of a good, rough fucking. He had never had such thoughts before, but now it was nearly impossible to push them out of his mind. His asshole was so tight and empty that it needed filling. He could see drops of pre beading at the top of his dick, which was sticking out farther and higher than it ever had before, begging to be sucked. More than anything, he needed to be fucked, to have Max push him against the wall, shove his cock into him and pound into his ass again and again, pulling and sucking on his pecs until he came.<br />
<br />
&#8232;&#8232;&quot;Okay,&quot; he spoke to himself, trying to force those thoughts from his mind, &quot;I&#39;ve got to keep calm. I need to relax and not think about how much I need my ass filled with a big, hard cock.&quot;<br />
<br />
&#8232;&#8232;Without even meaning to he had brought a hand up to massage his pecs, while his other hand drifted down to his crotch to stroke his dick, first running a finger over his wet mushroom head to moisten it.<br />
<br />
&#8232;&#8232;&quot;No!&quot; he brought his hands to his sides and clenched his fists, &quot;Deep breaths. No sexy thoughts, none at all.&quot; Nick struggled to ignore how hot his dick was, to not think about how sensitive his big, bouncy pecs were. &#8232;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m going to put my pants back on,&quot; he tried to talk himself through what he needed to do while also forgetting about his new jockstrap, &quot;And go back to work. That&#39;s all there is to it, just slide my pants up my legs, let them press up against my dick and feel how smooth they are against my ass. It&#39;ll feel so good, the way they&#39;ll rub me as I walk, not as good as having my ass stuffed full of cock, but it&#39;ll be good.&quot;&#8232;&#8232; He stopped reaching for his pants to finger himself, exploring the inner spaces of his ass and imagining what it would feel like to shove them in deeper, fingering himself until he came. The problem was, that wasn&#39;t what he wanted, far from it.&#8232;&#8232;<br />
<br />
&quot;Max?&quot; he called out weakly, realizing that his thoughts all came back to one thing, getting fucked, &quot;Could you come here?&quot;&#8232;&#8232;<br />
<br />
Unable to believe what he was doing he unlocked the door and pulled off his shirt, allowing his pecs to hang free. They hardly drooped at all, staying round and firm, their big, tan nipples jutting out in the cool air of the room.&#8232;&#8232; Max opened the door and his eyes went wide.&#8232;&#8232;<br />
<br />
All Nick could think of was his cock and how good it would feel in his ass.&#8232;&#8232;&quot;I...&quot; he couldn&#39;t believe what he was about to say, but it was what he wanted more than anything, &quot;I need you to fuck me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&#8232;&#8232;The smile he gave him let him know that this was what he had been wanting for a very long time. He locked the door behind him, unzipped his fly and let his cock spring free. It was nothing exceptional, a respectable six inches and the instant Nick set eyes on it he felt a spurt of precum trickle down his cock.&#8232;&#8232; He practically threw himself at him in his hurry to feel him slip inside him.&#8232;&#8232;<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoa, take it easy,&quot; he laughed, pressing his hands against his pecs.&#8232;&#8232;<br />
<br />
He moaned, his strong knees going weak as he cupped his massive pecs in his hands, guiding him back to the wall.&#8232;&#8232;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, please,&quot; he panted, &quot;Please fuck me hard. I want to feel that big, throbbing cock of yours in my ass. I need to be fucked.&quot;&#8232;<br />
<br />
“Don’t worry,” he stooped down to eye the impressive behemoth of a dick in front of him, “We’ll get to that. But first, I’m a little hungry myself.” He flicked his tongue on the piss slit. “Wow, you’re really gushing!” Without waiting for a response, he stuck his mouth on the cock and began bobbing his head up and down. Nick tilted his head back and moaned loudly, all thought purged from his mind as the pleasure raced through him.<br />
<br />
&#8232;He moaned, &quot;I&#39;ve been waiting so long for this.&quot; Max stood up, kissed him on the lips, spun him around, and pushed him against the wall. He pushed his cock against Nick’s ass.&#8232;<br />
<br />
The way he was teasing, letting him feel his cock against him, but not giving him its full length was maddening. The feeling of his dick in the crevice of his huge pecs was nearly overwhelming but not at all what he wanted. All he wanted was for him to stick it in him, but he struggled to keep himself from lunging backward to impale himself on the hunk. Minutes ago he had been struggling to keep himself from doing this and he tried to call back some of that restraint, to at least keep him going a bit longer.&#8232;&#8232;<br />
<br />
&quot;Me too,&quot; he reached around and gave his dick a gentle tug, causing him to shudder and moan, &quot;You ready for this?&quot;<br />
<br />
&#8232;&#8232;&quot;Please,&quot; he gasped, &quot;Please, just shove it in me. I can&#39;t take much more of this.&quot;&#8232;&#8232;<br />
<br />
Nick couldn&#39;t believe how horny he was, his nipples and dick throbbed with sensations as Max continued to slide his cock head up and down along his hot, wet hole, parting his rim without actually plunging in.<br />
<br />
&#8232;&#8232;&quot;Alright, here it goes,&quot; with a grunt he thrust into him.&#8232;&#8232;<br />
<br />
The sensation was electric, his soft cherry parting and allowing him entrance, the muscles of his ass clenching down around his cock with another spurt of precum from his dick flowing along his immensely sensitive pecs. Nick bucked his hips against him, his inner muscles squeezing down on his cock as he gasped for breath. It felt so good, so right, like the most natural thing in the world was for him to have Max&#39;s cock buried balls deep in him.&#8232;&#8232;<br />
<br />
Max began to slide back out, and he whimpered, his asshole spasming, not wanting to release the wonderful, hard cock.&#8232;&#8232;<br />
<br />
It was almost out, just the head in, and Max held it there for a moment, squeezing Nick’s dick as he bucked against him, wanting to have the full length of his cock back in him.<br />
<br />
&#8232;&#8232;Just when Nick thought he wouldn&#39;t be able to take it any longer Max thrust back in. Again his ass clamped down on his cock.&#8232;&#8232;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow,&quot; he laughed, &quot;You&#39;re good at this.&quot;&#8232;&#8232;<br />
<br />
&quot;Really?&quot; Nick gasped as Max started to thrust rhythmically, &quot;This is my first time. If I&#39;d known it would feel this good I&#39;d have asked you to fuck me a long time ago.&quot;<br />
<br />
With each thrust his hole spasmed, driving him to greater and greater heights of pleasure. His dick was crushed between his pecs and the wall as Max pressed himself harder and harder against Nick. Precum flowed down Nick’s chest and thighs like a river, droplets flying through the air and hitting the floor as Max thrust and he writhed in pleasure.<br />
<br />
Max began to pick up the pace, his thrusts becoming faster and harder, causing Nick&#39;s enormous dick to bounce and heave wildly until Max tensed, holding him in a crushing embrace as his cock twitched in him, a powerful blast of hot cum jetting deep into his ass.<br />
<br />
Nick came himself, the feeling of Max&#39;s hot seed filling his ass driving him to an orgasm so powerful that it left him unable to stand. Cum rocketed out of his cock at lightning speed and hit the upper part of the wall. When Max released him, his cock sliding from his thoroughly pleasured asshole with a wet &#39;pop&#39; he fell to the floor in a puddle of his own fluids.<br />
<br />
&quot;That was amazing,&quot; Nick gasped when he was at last able to speak.<br />
&#8232;&quot;Tell me about it,&quot; Max said with a content sigh before grabbing a handful of paper towels to blot Nick’s cum juices off chest.</p>
