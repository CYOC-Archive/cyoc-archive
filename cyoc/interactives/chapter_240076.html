<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">John stepped away from the table and pulled his pants back up, tucking his still-swollen penis into his boxers. &quot;Hold on, let&#39;s talk shop,&quot; he said, trying to ignore the sensation of his enlarged head against his inner thigh. &quot;What&#39;s the range of your power? Can you do this from a distance?&quot;<br />
Paul nodded. &quot;I can do it from a few feet away, but the closer I am, the more control I have. And it&#39;s not just for show, either. The changes are real and permanent.&quot;<br />
<br />
John&#39;s mind raced with the implications. &quot;Permanent, huh?&quot; he mused. &quot;What if I want it to go back to normal?&quot;<br />
<br />
Paul&#39;s expression grew slightly apologetic. &quot;Well, that&#39;s the thing,&quot; he said, &quot;I can&#39;t shrink things back down. Once I&#39;ve made them bigger, that&#39;s it. They stay that way.&quot;<br />
John&#39;s smile faltered a bit. <br />
Paul nodded. &quot;Yeah, sorry man, but it&#39;s a one-way ticket. Once it&#39;s big, it&#39;s always big.&quot;<br />
<br />
John took a moment to absorb this. He felt his cheeks heat up, his mind racing with the implications. He&#39;d be walking around with this...monstrosity attached to him for the rest of his life? The idea was both exhilarating and terrifying. But before he could voice his concerns, Paul spoke up again.<br />
&quot;But hey, it&#39;s not all bad,&quot; he said with a wink, &quot;You&#39;ll never have to worry about size again, right?&quot;<br />
John couldn&#39;t help but chuckle, the absurdity of the situation hitting him like a ton of bricks. &quot;I guess that&#39;s one way to look at it,&quot; he said, adjusting his pants again.<br />
<br />
The discomfort grew as John tried to ignore the heavy weight of his engorged cock. The fabric of his boxers was stretched to its limits, and the constant rubbing against his thigh was driving him insane. He cleared his throat, trying to focus on the task at hand. &quot;Look, Paul, as...interesting as this is, I&#39;m not sure how exactly this fits into our &#39;helping the community&#39; model,&quot; he began.<br />
<br />
Paul&#39;s enthusiasm didn&#39;t wane. &quot;Think about it, man. We could help guys who have trouble with, you know, size issues. Like, for their partners. Make their lives better. And if it&#39;s just for confidence, that&#39;s a huge deal.&quot;<br />
John raised an eyebrow, his voice a mix of skepticism and curiosity. &quot;But what about those who don&#39;t need help with confidence? What if it causes more problems than it solves?&quot;<br />
<br />
Paul nodded, acknowledging John&#39;s concern. &quot;That&#39;s a good point,&quot; he said, stroking his chin thoughtfully. &quot;But we could also help with other things, like, uh, medical issues. Guys who had, you know, accidents or surgeries.&quot;<br />
John&#39;s mind was racing. The potential was there, but he couldn&#39;t shake the feeling that this was all a bit...weird. And what if someone didn&#39;t want it? What if they had a change of heart after it was done? &quot;What if someone wants to go back to normal?&quot; he asked, his voice tight.<br />
<br />
Paul&#39;s smile slipped a bit. &quot;Well, like I said, I can&#39;t make things smaller. But,&quot; he added quickly, &quot;I can work on other aspects. Like, I can make the shaft thicker, or the balls bigger. Or even give it more length. It&#39;s all about balance, right?&quot;<br />
John took a deep breath, his hand reflexively going to his crotch to adjust his bulging package. &quot;I appreciate that, but I think we&#39;re getting ahead of ourselves. First, I want to know what happens when you do this. What&#39;s the aftermath? Does it affect how it works?&quot;<br />
Paul leaned back in his chair, looking a bit more relaxed now that the demonstration was over. &quot;It doesn&#39;t mess with the plumbing, if that&#39;s what you&#39;re worried about. Everything still works like it&#39;s supposed to, just...enhanced. But yeah, you might get some weird looks in the locker room.&quot;<br />
<br />
John couldn&#39;t argue with that. The idea of going to work tomorrow with a cock head the size of a fist was not exactly appealing. He decided to test Paul&#39;s power further. &quot;Okay, okay,&quot; he said, &quot;Let&#39;s say we go with this. Can you make my shaft thicker to match the head now?&quot;<br />
Paul nodded eagerly and placed his hands back on the table. &quot;Ready when you are,&quot; he said, focusing his energy. John stood and pulled his cock out of his pants again.<br />
John felt the same warmth spread from Paul&#39;s hands and into his penis. The sensation was less intense this time, but no less strange. He watched as his shaft began to thicken, the skin stretching and the veins becoming more prominent. It was a gradual process, unlike the rapid expansion of his glans, but the end result was just as dramatic.<br />
When it was done, John&#39;s penis looked more like a can of soda than a human appendage. The shaft was thick and meaty, the head still grotesquely large, but now in proportion to the rest of his member. He took a deep breath, feeling the weight of his new size.<br />
<br />
But as the novelty began to wear off, John felt a creeping sense of frustration. This wasn&#39;t what he had in mind when he wanted to make a difference. He was supposed to be forming a team to help people, not turning them into caricatures of themselves. &quot;Okay, okay, let&#39;s stop here,&quot; he said, cutting off Paul&#39;s explanation of how he could make John&#39;s balls as large as grapefruits.<br />
Paul looked at him quizzically. &quot;Is something wrong?&quot;<br />
John sighed, tucking his monstrous cock away. &quot;Yeah,&quot; he said, his voice tight with frustration, &quot;It&#39;s just...I don&#39;t know if this is what I had in mind for the team.&quot;<br />
<br />
Paul looked crestfallen. &quot;But you said you wanted unique powers, and I&#39;ve never heard of anyone else who can do this,&quot; he protested.<br />
John nodded, his expression sympathetic but firm. &quot;I know, and I appreciate it. It&#39;s just...I need to think.&quot; He sat down heavily in his chair, the weight of his decision pressing down on him. His penis, now thick and heavy, was a constant reminder of how off-course he had gone.<br />
Paul nodded slowly, understanding dawning on his face. &quot;Okay,&quot; he said, &quot;I&#39;ll, uh, I&#39;ll leave you to it.&quot; He got up and let himself out, the awkwardness of the situation thick in the air.<br />
<br />
John sat in his garage, surrounded by the tools of his forgotten dreams. The echoes of their conversation bouncing around the walls. He had wanted to assemble a team that would make a difference, not a sideshow act. But as he thought about it, maybe there was something to be said for making people feel good about themselves. Maybe that was a form of help, too.<br />
He pulled out his phone and started scrolling through the list of potential team members. There was a woman who could manipulate light, a man who could control the weather, and another who could heal injuries with a touch. Each had a clear and noble purpose for their powers. And then there was Paul, with his...unconventional ability.<br />
John&#39;s thumb hovered over the delete button, his mind racing. He knew that he couldn&#39;t have everyone on his team running around with oversized genitals, but he couldn&#39;t ignore the potential for good that Paul&#39;s power represented. It was a delicate balance, and one he wasn&#39;t sure he was ready to navigate.<br />
Finally, after what felt like an eternity, he made up his mind. He sent a text to Paul, his thumbs moving swiftly over the screen. &quot;Thanks for coming by,&quot; he typed, &quot;I need to think more about how we can use your power effectively. Give me a couple of days, okay?&quot;<br />
Paul&#39;s reply was almost instantaneous. &quot;No problem, man. Just let me know what you decide. I&#39;m all in if you are.&quot;<br />
John set his phone down on the table, his mind still racing. He knew he had a lot of thinking to do. The team was supposed to be about helping people, not just giving them what they thought they wanted. But as he stared at the spot where Paul had been sitting, he couldn&#39;t shake the feeling that there was more to this power than met the eye.<br />
He stood up, his cock bobbing heavily with the movement, and began pacing the garage. He needed to figure out if he was willing to take the risk, to embrace the weirdness of it all. The clock ticked away the hours as John weighed the pros and cons, the future of his team and his own conscience hanging in the balance.</p>
