<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I had an idea so profound my hand began to shake. <br />
<br />
I knew what I wanted to do, what I had to do, and the anticipation was debilitating, made worse by the struggle of adapting to those dainty little hands. I jumped into the ‘Preprogrammed Transformations,’ pushed past the nigh infinite variations on ‘bimbo’ and into the little section of goth girls. Unfortunately there weren&#39;t many left when I filtered out all the non-black girls, left mostly with caricatures and half-formed mutants. But, right there in the middle, there was one that did the job.<br />
<br />
‘Cute BTGGF: Raven’<br />
<br />
I grinned at the image, testing out it&#39;s effect on the preview of Kayla. She must have seen the smile, shifting beneath me. I got in close, presenting her with just the ‘proceed’ button, letting her initiate her own change as I stroked her hair. She tapped it, laying back into the sofa.<br />
<br />
We both knew the second the change began, watching her pupils dilate in a snap. I could feel everything she felt through them; the fear, the excitement, the curiosity, all swirling as she was engulfed by the omnipresent arousal. Her legs began to shift, getting comfortable, her eyes glazing over before shutting.<br />
<br />
“Ant?” She murmured, one hand letting go of the sofa. I sprung to my knees beside her, taking her hand with both of mine. <br />
<br />
The first thing to change was, like me, her shape. She writhed as the change warped and accentuated her pre-existing shape, instincts driving her towards the inexistant source of this omnipresent arousal. While she always had a little thickness and a lot of ass, now that thickness was starting the shift, stretching and plumping passing the thickness of my own and towards the territory she always dreamed of. <br />
<br />
I pulled back to get a better picture, and what I saw stunned me. The change turned her into something of a cross between a fertility goddess and a supermodel, her body now much more apple-ie coke bottle than mine, jerking and jiggling as the excitement continued to grow. I was transfixed on it, my heart beginning to tace, tingling rising in my loins.<br />
<br />
Her hand found mine, ripping me out of a sexual daydream, pulling me in as the next stage kicked in, pleasure pushing her back up and throwing her titties into the air. Rivulets of throbbing arousal covered her body, flowing with her follicles, racing towards lover centre-mass, a million vibrating ribs converging on her pussy. The little stubble covering her body, from pits to pussy, down to her feet and over her hands, popped off into nothingness. <br />
<br />
Her whole body smoothing out into a wall of warm chocolate, glistening in the low light, and though she couldn’t see it she could feel it. She was more than goddess-like, she felt simply as a goddess, the change worshiping her in the most sensual way possible. She ground her hips at me in response, her moisture seeping onto the sofa, as mine started to trickle down my leg.<br />
<br />
It really was a revelation. My sexual arousal was so much stronger now, but so much vaguer, a holistic experience that consumed my body. I wanted to just ride her, fuck her, hell merge with her and ride it out together. My sexuality was driving me to her in ways incomprehensible before.<br />
<br />
Her lip quivered as she mumbled something, the only words I caught were vulgar and guttural, but I wanted her to keep it up. The whole motion masked the fact her whole mouth was starting to reshape, her lips broadening and retreating into a dainty black love heart, her jaw more rounded. Meanwhile her nose rose up, retaining much of its breadth and sticking up ever so slightly, freckles spreading out across it and over her cheeks.<br />
<br />
“Very pretty,&#39;&#39; I said, stroking her hair with my freehand. She moved into it, moaning as her new mouth mouthed my finger, eyes flickering on me as smokey shadow burst onto them. While it was hard to keep her eyes open, the pleasure now latching onto her clit, she managed to give me a flicker, eyeing each other for the first time. It gave me butterflies, so aroused I was having to shift my hips.<br />
<br />
She gasped at me, her mouth almost cleaving off my thumb. I yelped, but said something cheeky and encouraging as I kissed her hand, rubbing it against my face, but as I looked her eyes found me, shooting me a pleading glance. My heart sunk.<br />
<br />
“What do I do?” I said, patting on her head. It was starting to shake, her whole body writhing, scrunching up as eeps left under breath. I made suggestion after suggestion, but she shook them all down, shaking her head as her hair flumped out into a voluminous kinky bob.<br />
<br />
I looked up and down her, trying to find the source of her distress, but how would I even be able to tell if something was off? Her breasts were starting to quiver too, jiggling to an unseen force, flowing towards her nipples, but her hand, her free hand was hovering on her lap, near her crotch. Did that mean her tits were stuck somehow? When I tried to pat one she shook her head, biting her lip, her hand grasping for my chest, a panicked look on her face. <br />
<br />
“Has it malfunctioned? Are you in pain?” She shook her head, mumbling something as she quivered her lips at me. I pulled in close, almost shoving her ear into her mouth, only to be met by a stilted laugh.<br />
<br />
“Kiss me. I am going to cum. Fucking kiss me.”<br />
<br />
I exhaled with a laugh, sliding my hand under her head. I dove straight into the kiss, pressing our lips together, her tongue immediately hunting mine. She was hungry, hungry the kind of infectious and angry lust that we normally have to build to, but now was pouring out of her. The arousal was flowing into her, massaging and reshaping her clit, as it did the same to her breasts, like a tiny vortex had wrapped itself around them. <br />
<br />
I was starting to feel the arousal rise again, and I was tempted to try to flick my bean, but she pulled me out of that daydream again, this time via the tit. Her last act was to grab hold my flesh, full fisted, screaming as the pleasure pumped into her. Her back spasmed with each new wave, jiggling her plump ass, and expanding tits, as mine screamed out in another way.<br />
<br />
“Antoinette.” She gasped, as I tried hard to not cry. Thankfully, as the last sensations began to fade out, she released my tit, collapsing onto the sofa.<br />
<br />
“Fuck that was good,” her newly crips voice moaned. I didn’t respond, too busy messaging a boob. “And look at these things,” she said pressing her breasts together and shaking, “how do they compare to… oh shit!”<br />
<br />
Upon realizing what she had done she pulled me onto the sofa, rubbing a cream into the affected boob from her medical kit under the table, apologizing profusely. Meanwhile, all I could think of was that now I had the bigger tits, that somehow feeling like a victory at that moment.</p>
