<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Let Tony go!&quot;<br />
&quot;Keep Tony!&quot;<br />
&quot;Keep all three!&quot;<br />
&quot;Keep the teddies!&quot;<br />
&quot;Yeah! They&#39;re so cute!&quot;<br />
Opinions varied but the Ringmaster had made his own decision. When opinions varied that much, the best was to listen to one&#39;s own instincts. And his told him that the two ballerina bears would bring in more tickets, if he had to choose between them and Tony. Taking all three would be a little too greedy. And another similar anthropomorphic animal with superhuman strength could be more easily found and molded than two little bears.<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s bring Tony back to you, dear audience!&quot;<br />
With a snap of his fingers, a puff of green smoke erupted where Tony was and the man was there, returned to his initial form. He was convinced that he had been skilfully hidden and had seen a gigantic puppet perform tricks. He retained no memories of being a superhuman circus tiger. Only in his dreams would these memories might emerge again. He smiled a bit stupidly as he regained his seat, explaining how it had all been a trick, albeit an amazing one. The Ringmaster made the two ballerina bears curtsy and bow before retreating with them off the stage, letting two magical replicas to come in opposite ways and pretend the same had happened to them as to Tony. They would take Jared and Tayla&#39;s places for a few days, before vanishing, leaving no traces and in particular leaving no clues back to the circus. Before he stepped back to run the show, he drank some coffee and let the fire breathers and acrobats do their performances. That was when a young child, an apprentice warlock, arrived, breathless and very much excited. He explained that Bubbles, the marine orca-like monster they kept, was behaving rather strangely in his basin, waiting to perform his tricks. It was hard to get him to be calm and compliant at times. He had a face mingling marine and mammalian features, a somewhat human torso and arms and the rest of his body was shaped like that of an orca with more yellow markings. In short, he resembled an orca centaur, his lower body that of a killer whale. He was a very intelligent creature but prone to bouts of moodiness. The name Bubbles was a contrast to his more aggressive traits. But now, he was acting excited and most restless, peering out of his basin or looking underwater through different angles through he glass at thew audience that could not see him yet. Most peculiar indeed. And then the Ringmaster understood. He laughed. Bubbles was attracted to a member of the audience!<br />
A girl in her late teens. With straight brown hair flowing a little past her shoulders. Flowing clothes but that did show that she was skinny, but with enough curves to be quite attractive. Especially her... arrogant chest. No one would find her repulsive in a bathing suit. Why Bubbles was sensing his urges very demanding in regards to her was hard to fathom, at least for now, but the Ringmaster felt it could be the path to make Bubbles more compliant and to new performances. As well as interesting and entertaining little guppies and pups, potentially. The Ringmaster  went to Bubbles and told that he performed well, he would get his &quot;lovely little mate&quot; by tonight. And indeed Bubbles made a stellar performance, only eclipsed by the clowns&#39; &#39;magical&#39; tricks and throwing of amazing candy to the public. <br />
<br />
Oceane was walking back home when it happened. She was suddenly grabbed from behind. She was utterly terrified, expecting the worst but it was barely better than a rape. A piece of cloth was pressed to her nose and mouth and her struggles and scratches weakened while she sunk into unconsciousness. The Ringmaster performed his magic while Bubbles was getting restless. He knew his dearest was coming and it made him excited and frustrated in his aquarium, a trailer enchanted to hold a good-sized swimming pool. Already her scent was driving him crazy with desire and a warm pool of carnal love was developing at the level of his groin, heralding a demanding arousal.<br />
So when Oceane woke up, she fought feebly as she was being chained in a sort of grotto with a fake pool of water nearby. Her lower body felt numb and she could not move her legs at all. She mumbled an explanation, thrashing as best she could as two carnies left her, not even bothering to talk to her. She protested, utterly terrified. Why was she back at that puppet carnival? As they left, one carnie mentioned a hypnosis that couldn&#39;t work because of an intense fright and rebellious mood. The other did pay more direct attention to her, smiling and wishing her a pleasant wedding night. She screamed that she was 19 only but they were gone. <br />
As her eyes adjusted to her surroundings, she thought she&#39;d faint. Her legs! They were gone! Replaced by a light turquoise fish tail ending with the fluke of a dolphin&#39;s tail. What? What sort of crazy kink was that? She flopped her new tail uselessly, attempting to slide out of it. To no avail. And... And it hurt. She could feel nerves sensing the pebbles and grit of the grotto and the water lapping her scales and soft dolphin skin. No... No... That wasn&#39;t possible... How... And then she heard it. Sounds of chains being dropped, splashes, soft cooing growls and  little utterances resembling clicks and making &quot;gluck&quot; sounds. <br />
<br />
She saw its shadows approaching, followed by its actual body. The marine monster she had felt was so pretty and realistic from the show earlier! It was there! In front of her and frankly, it did not look like a puppet or an animatronic anymore. Unless... Unless it never had been? Was everything real from the start? The monster hoisted itself up on the sound, approaching her slowly. Tentatively. He handed her something from its claws. Pieces of raw fish. Oceane loved sashimi but in these circumstances... She&#39;d pass. And it looked like the monster was trying to coax her with it. Yes, so no. It made crooning noises and took advantage of her chained wrists to rub her head and then inhale deeply the crook of her neck. <br />
&quot;Pretty... So pretty... Beautiful mate...&quot; it purred.<br />
Oceane screamed that she was not his mate but he did not heed her. She was new at this, so of course she did not know any better. She would soon enough. He&#39;d show her, be very patient with her and he&#39;d be the best sire and mate of all the seas and oceans. She was extremely pretty and her mermaid form even more charming! And her scent! Utterly enchanting! Enthralled by her presence and prospective future with her, he decided to just heed his raging desires. She was shy but he&#39;d be gentle. She&#39;d learn to love mating and him with time. She would realize how caring and sweet he was. And she would be elated to have her belly full of pups, to be sure. <br />
<br />
The Ringmaster, sick of her screams and cries, had taken her voice. Oceane had become a little mermaid indeed. Bubbles had broken her thoroughly too, even if the marine creature could not conceive it as such. When she was so sad she stayed without moving, he just hugged and snuggled up next to her, delighted at the lack of resistance and even taking her little touches offered in return as proof of her love. He did not realize that it was because she simply had no one else. His affection was growing on her too, slowly but surely. She&#39;d be ready to perform with her mate in the near future. Bubbles was certainly less aggressive than before and much more compliant to set up tricks and shows. Oceane did not fight back anymore when Bubbles slid into her. She knew it would happen and could do nothing about it. No pups yet but it would come with time. She did start to openly accept Bubbles&#39; gifts, nurturing, affection and love and to return it. Bubbles&#39; moodiness had merely been pent-up  frustration and lack of mating and communication. That problem was definitely solved now. He made sure she came to realize how pleasant life could be with him. He liked to scratch her, snuggle with her and nudge her delicately. Certainly less boorish than a stupid teenager her age! And Bubbles&#39; aquarium had been decorated as a warm tropical place for her, along with a sulphur pool and a sauna! What more could she ask for, really? And Bubbles was a fine creature indeed. Women! But she was finally learning that she should feel flattered to have been chosen. She was pretty and perfect to be with Bubbles. And she had been made a mermaid! Why should she feel ungrateful in the end? And she was warming up to her strong marine mate. All would be well in the end. All of the circus&#39; recruits accepted their new place in life eventually.</p>
