<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Derrick opened his front door, glancing around his front yard as he grabbed his mail. The large weeping cherry trees blocked his view of <br />
most of the neighborhood, limiting him to a front lawn that desperately needed mowing. (This was not a bad thing, as he was currently in T-<br />
shirt and boxers, having not gotten dressed yet at 10:30 this morning.) A package down on the step caught his eye; he grabbed it and <br />
slipped back inside the house.<br />
<br />
He flipped through his bills, mumbling to himself. &quot;Junk, bill, junk, junk, pizza flyer, junk, bill..&quot; He split the bills, throwing them onto a small <br />
pile of other bills on top of the kitchen microwave, or as he called it, his 'next paycheck, whenever that might be' pile. The rest he dumped <br />
into the trash, minus the pizza flyer, which he pinned to the fridge with a magnetic clip.<br />
<br />
He turned to the box, hastily dumped on the dining room table. &quot;I wonder what this is? *I* can't afford to buy anything..&quot; The address was <br />
right, but the name on the label was only 'Occupant'. He noticed the delivery label had a 'signature required' mark.<br />
<br />
No wonder there, the neighborhood he lived in didn't have the best reputation, and deliveries were notoriously unreliable. Ah well, rent was <br />
cheap. (Utilities sucked, but hey, a whole house to himself!)<br />
<br />
Derrick cut open the small box, finding a well-packed styrofoam frame holding a plastic remote and a CD jewel case. No packing sheet, <br />
printed instructions, or anything else. The remote was large, looking more like a graphing calculator than a regular TV remote, with more <br />
buttons and a fairly large LCD screen. The CD case was blank but for the brand-name logo 'Chronivac' and a version number printed on one <br />
corner. The disc inside had the same name and version number, this time with the number hand-written, and a 'PC/Mac Compatible' label.<br />
<br />
Perplexed, Derrick climbed the stairs to his computer room/studio. Soda cans piled the desktop, while his drafting desk was covered in <br />
boxes, art supplies, and loose papers. He popped the laptop open, plugging in the detached USB keyboard and setting it in front of the <br />
scuffed MacBook Pro. Three keys on the regular keyboard were missing, victims of a friend's careless soda spill.<br />
<br />
The disc spun to life, and a prompt came up, &quot;Would you like to install the Chronivac Transformation Software Package?&quot;<br />
<br />
So.. a morphing program? Derrick was a digital artist, freelance. (Not a *successful* one, mind you, but that takes time..) He had registered <br />
on a few sites, gotten a few promo magazines and such, this was probably the same thing. Worth checking out, at least, he reasoned.<br />
<br />
He hit 'Yes', entered his password, and away it went. While it installed, he read the little diagrams that flickered by as the installation <br />
continued. They showed some (rather impressive, near-photo-realistic) CG figures progressing from shrimpy, average builds into blown-up <br />
bodybuilders, or from men into women. Other little boxes described details of height, weight, muscle mass, gender, sexuality (how does <br />
sexuality come across in a 3D model?), hairyness, gender endowments, even species. One of the later sequences showed a man being turned <br />
into a lion, progressing through a really good-looking anthropomorphic stage.<br />
<br />
The diagrams also explained the remote, stating it was an advanced full-body scanner and emitter. Scanner he could buy, but emitter? It <br />
must be a projector, one of those small-scale ones he'd seen described as an emerging technology for cellphones that never seemed to <br />
catch on, and it had the ability to modify a given model on the fly. The scanning mode was capable of taking full, high-resolution scans, <br />
even through clothing.<br />
<br />
Derrick finished the install, and decided to make a small test of it. He set the emitter on his desk, set the scanner to go off in ten seconds, <br />
and moved to the scanning area.<br />
<br />
Derrick was not what you'd expect when someone said they were a recently-graduated freelance artist. Some might expect a skinny, gawky <br />
type, weighing around 120 lbs. soaking wet, in trendy skinny jeans, maybe a hipster-type in ironic T-shirts or flannel, with thick-rimmed <br />
glasses, gauged ears, and a cap over shaggy hair. There were certainly plenty of those in his graduating class. (It was art school, what do you <br />
expect?)<br />
<br />
Derrick was not that. Derrick stood 6'2&quot;, weighing in at around 340 lbs. A good portion of that was fat, but he had a really <br />
large-proportioned, solid frame under it all, broad shoulders, wide hips, big hands and feet, and a large head. Eschewing the common <br />
hoodies of his peers, he favored heavy wide-leg jeans and rock T-shirts, or often henley, leaving the buttons open in front. He was hairy, to <br />
a degree, but pale-skinned and blond, meaning what he did have was not visible more than a pace away. To his mixed consternation and <br />
excitement, he was growing hair on his back, which he was proud of, but he also knew it was something most people found disgusting. He <br />
generally wore a beard, either a goatee, or often a full beard.<br />
<br />
Masculinity was a point of pride for Derrick. He grew up in eager anticipation of growing into a massive, muscular bear of a man. Now in his <br />
late twenties, he'd achieved a good portion of what he wanted, but not in full. His beard didn't really fill out like he wanted, and he had little <br />
to no sideburns to speak of. His chest had a few sparse hairs spread around, and a little patch in the center, but he'd always wanted a rug on <br />
his chest that spilled over his collar. And despite wearing size 15 shoes, he was only modestly endowed. He was stronger than most, but <br />
Derrick knew he wasn't exactly Mr. Olympia.<br />
<br />
Derrick had one big problem, which had been the root of a good portion of his life's problems and difficulties. He was an amputee, with his <br />
right leg chopped down at the ankle, the result of a series of surgeries to correct a major birth defect which had never panned out. In his <br />
youth, his prosthesis had never been quite right for his growing body, leaving him unable to join in a lot of gym activity for the soreness it <br />
inflicted. This led him to be sedentary from grade school on, leading to his discovery of art and computers, but also leading to weight gain <br />
and general poor health.<br />
<br />
He heard the 'ping' of the scanning software, and shivered. A brief tingle passed over him, but he shook it off. Odd nerve effects at his age <br />
and weight weren't uncommon, but he grimaced at another sign of bad health.<br />
<br />
He sat back down at his computer, looking at an astounding 3D image of himself. Highly detailed, better in full motion than most high-end <br />
Poser *renders*, the spinning figure was him, in full detail, entirely nude. Even then prosthetic was gone, and his stump, scarred, calloused, <br />
and entirely familiar to him, was fully detailed with every flaw intact, the figure standing on one center-balanced left leg.<br />
<br />
Derrick grimaced at the sight of his full figure. The rolls of fat on his midsections, while not unfamiliar, were not pleasant to look at.<br />
<br />
A list of details was written in the top left corner:<br />
<br />
Name: Derrick Kimble<br />
Gender: Male<br />
Age: 28<br />
Weight: 244 lbs.<br />
Height: 6'2&quot;<br />
Sexual Orientation: Bisexual (straight-acting)<br />
Muscle/Fat Ratio: 4:3<br />
BIRTH DEFECT (Right leg, amputated, prosthetic)<br />
<br />
His eyes popped at all the info. All this, from a scan? He cringed at the sexuality part, he had suspected he might be gay for some time now, <br />
but hadn't really had a chance to explore it in person one way or another. (He'd rationalized to himself for years that his fetish for hairy <br />
muscle guys was just a self-desire thing..)<br />
<br />
Derrick saw a list of collapsable menus on the right side of the screen, listing details like Appearance, Personality, Background, and a bunch <br />
of others. As he moused over to them, the cursor passed over the figure, highlighting various body parts.<br />
<br />
Passing over his right leg, the glow took on a bright red tone, and a pop-up appeared.<br />
<br />
&quot;Repair birth defect?&quot;<br />
<br />
Derrick's eyes bugged out for a second. But, of course the software could correct imbalances in the body type, all it had to do was copy the <br />
3D data from one side to the other and stitch the mesh back together. He clicked 'Yes', and paused, watching the model's right leg expand <br />
to match the left. They even mixed it up, removing and adding little imperfections like that little mole on his left calf, which didn't show up <br />
on the model's right.<br />
<br />
'Calculating effect of repair on body type...'<br />
<br />
The figure seemed a lot better balanced on two legs. The right thigh, which was noticeably smaller than the left, bulked up to match. It took <br />
a few seconds, but he also realized the whole figure was losing a bit of fat. The weight on the left jittered, rising as the full leg grew in, but <br />
dropping as the belly and ass of the figure shrunk slightly.<br />
<br />
In the end, the weight settled at 352, six pounds heavier, but the figure looked a lot better. Derrick guessed the model had lost maybe 10 or <br />
15 pounds of fat, but gained it back and more in muscle and bone on the new leg.<br />
<br />
A new pop-up appeared. 'Apply all changes?' Below this was two drop-downs, labelled 'User Aware', currently set to Yes, and 'Reality Shift', <br />
currently set to Yes. There were also two locked sliders, 'Duration', set to Permanent, and 'Time', set to 5 minutes. He hit the second drop-<br />
down, and wondered at the meaning of the different options, a vague, impossible concept tugging at his thoughts. He pushed it aside and <br />
settled for 'Unexplained but expected', and clicked Yes.<br />
<br />
Transformation starting in 5.. 4..<br />
<br />
Just then, a horrible pain stabbed through Derrick's right leg. It was like a cramp in every muscle of his right leg, even the inactive ones, plus <br />
a bone-deep ache that vibrated from the end of his stump, past his knees, and into his hips and spine.<br />
<br />
He climbed his way to his feet, and stumbled to the small couch next to his drafting desk. He pulled off his fake leg and began massaging <br />
the muscles through the prosthetic sock, digging deep to try to knead out the pain.<br />
<br />
It didn't seem to do any good, but the pain began to fade on its own. He laid back as the ache continued to diffuse, his eyes tightly shut, his <br />
breathing heavy.<br />
<br />
After a couple minutes, Derrick opened his eyes, to be greeted by the most amazing, impossible sight.<br />
<br />
His right leg, or rather, his foot, growing at a visible rate, the visible spread of toes stretching the prosthetic sock. He tensed what he had <br />
always considered the analogous muscle to squeezing his toes together on the left, and watched as the foot jerked up. New sensations came <br />
to him, as his leg finished growing, and he found he could suddenly feel his right toes- HIS TOES!!<br />
<br />
He gave a deep, shuddering breath, and reached forward, ripping off the ill-fitting prosthetic sock to be greeted by his toes. Just like his left, <br />
they were large, strong, with pale hair on each toe knuckle, and thick, soft nails on each toe. He wiggled them, and giggled at the sight. He <br />
pulled his leg up over his left knee, exploring every inch of the strange, new, but still familiar limb.<br />
<br />
Tears flooded his eyes, and he ran his fingers up the rest of the leg, finding it just as if he'd always been this way, sparse hair over the foot <br />
and lower leg, with no signs of the many surgical scars he'd borne all his life.<br />
<br />
Minutes later, Derrick pulled himself together, taking a deep breath and getting to his feet. He stepped daintily on his new leg, getting used <br />
to the weight and feel. He took one step, stumbled a bit, then another, and another, and began walking around the house, down the hall, <br />
descending stairs. He stopped himself from going outside, and scrambled back up the stairs, finding a pair of cargo shorts. Not bothering <br />
with shoes, he pulled on the shorts and sped back to the front door, securing his keys in a pocket. Stepping out the front door, he practically <br />
skipped down the front steps, heading for the overgrown lawn.<br />
<br />
A sudden sharp pain stabbed him in the sole of his new right foot, and he dropped, quickly sitting down, checking his new foot for damage. <br />
A small, rounded stone had dug into the bottom of his arch, but brushed off without incident. From his sitting position, he reached his legs <br />
out, putting his feet onto the shaggy grass. He luxuriated in the sensation, blades of grass sticking up between his toes. He pushed himself <br />
to his feet, and took a few steps around.<br />
<br />
More tears came to his eyes, but he quickly pulled himself together, and headed back inside.<br />
<br />
As he stepped back inside, his eyes widened. He realized what this meant.<br />
<br />
He could change things. About himself, about his life. He could fix all the shit that had happened, he could make his dreams come true. Hell, <br />
with this Chronivac, he could make his *fantasies* come true, and live out all those things which excited him in ways he rarely admitted.<br />
<br />
But he had to be careful.</p>
