<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The game came and Deion tried to keep his mind on that while he was here, not thinking about the whole drama with Dave, the books that were due to arrive at his place, or the issue with Spencer and his grunts. He sat, gathering his thoughts, preparing himself for the big game in the locker room that night. His team was likewise getting ready - some were handling the stress better than others, but what really impressed Deion was how everyone there was really just there for each other regardless of background or past. Really showed how vapid and egocentric the perspective of Spencer really was.<br />
<br />
He could hear the shouts and the noise outside, and Deion admitted that across the years he had never heard that kind of a response, especially not with wrestling. That was always a strictly indoors, mostly crowd-less proceeding. But now, playing football, it was all incredibly public. It was all out there for everyone to see. He got up once it was time to head out, and marched into the light alongside his fellow footballers.<br />
<br />
Some gifts were being brought in by fans, and Deion got a message from Savannah, and a letter giving him the best of luck from Kayla. He was glad things had apparently gotten sorted out with her, and she was here to see the game. Apparently she found herself a lovely new man, and hopefully he&#39;d be someone not quite as much a disaster as Alec had been.<br />
<br />
He knew, even if he lost here, he was going to have the time of his life. This was going to be something unlike anything he&#39;d experienced before, and he was going to go to that afterparty and enjoy himself. He breathed and looked side to side. Easily the biggest guy on his side of the Field, and few guys on the other team approached his level. But he knew going by how things like this went the minute he let it go to his head it&#39;d sabotage him out there.<br />
<br />
The whistle issued, and the big game began.<br />
<br />
------------<br />
<br />
Admittedly, Deion had not expected to win. Especially after that rough first half of the game, and the way they managed to get things to one final round. But then they pulled ahead on the last inning and he was left standing there in the field as his team&#39;s victory was pronounced. His muscles were tired, sore and he knew he had used everything - every last ounce of strength - to pull ahead. He was glad he hadn&#39;t gotten a big head due to his size because god DAMN did that other team know what they were doing.<br />
<br />
Really showed this was a sport where skill as well as size played a role. The coach was giving everyone congratulations and said that there&#39;d be a celebratory dinner this coming week at a local pizza place for the victory. That got everyone cheering. Deion remembered the afterparty, and went ahead and checked his phone once he was in the locker room and changing clothes back into his street clothes. He saw a text message from Savannah; &quot;Congratulations, top stud. Now how about I give you some personal congrats.&quot;<br />
<br />
That got Deion grinning and thinking about what that meant. Sure he was aching and sore from the big game, but his libido didn&#39;t take much prodding to roar to life. It was time to go and get his post-game rewards. At least he hoped so. Savannah was a beautiful woman and it&#39;d be awesome to not only end the night a winner in football, but having the best sex of his life.<br />
<br />
Deion texted her back, asking, &quot;So, any particular requests before I get there and say hey?&quot;<br />
<br />
She responded back quickly, &quot;I want you hot and shirtless at the door. Think you can do that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure thing.&quot; And with that he put his phone away and started heading over at a steady jog, eager to get in his afterparty. Even after the exertion of the big game, Deion could still use his legs to that kind of level. Really showed what a strong point his legs were on him. As he arrived at the door, hearing the party music and dancing going on inside the house, Deion promptly took his shirt off and knocked a few times at the door.<br />
<br />
As soon as the door opened up, he smirked and shrugged his shoulders, &quot;Hey, how&#39;s the party? Everyone ready to get it on?&quot;<br />
<br />
The people at the door ushered him in, people shouting about how &quot;Big D&quot; was in the house, and that the team had brought home their first victory of the season in the first game of the season. He loved the pop / hip hop tunes going on in the house, and saw how there seemed to be a lot of people here tonight. He started looking around trying to find Savannah, eagerly anticipating what would come tonight...<br />
<br />
He was then called out to by her from inside of a bedroom, looking inside to see her in just her bikini and shorts. That immediately got his attention, making Deion grin and proceed into the bedroom, shutting the door behind him. &quot;Hey babe, looks like I won in like, my first game ever.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That you did,&quot; she said putting her hands on his massive shoulders, &quot;You did so wonderful, baby. Everyone was watching, and I think you&#39;ve probably got a few college scouts looking into you now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;College scouts? Shit! Seriously?&quot; He was at once thrilled by the idea, and while he didn&#39;t know if he&#39;d be able to play football so well into college, he was excited to have his future coming together like this. Of course, people would be looking for Deion Dalton to be their football hero. Which meant if he reverted back to Alec...<br />
<br />
He banished those thoughts from his mind, especially as Savannah went to him and kissed him on the lips, &quot;Let&#39;s worry about tomorrow when it comes. Time to focus on the here and now...&quot; She let her hands drift on to his abs and pecs, bringing him in closer to her.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s in the here and now?&quot; He cheekily responded, kissing her on the lips again.<br />
<br />
&quot;The best sex of your life, big guy.&quot; And with that, Savannah kissed him more intently and both started to move over toward the bed, the mood being enhanced by the inhabitants of the next room over apparently having the same idea. Savannah kissed him passionately all the while letting her hand move down and push his shorts down, rubbing his manhood.<br />
<br />
He expertly removed her bra, panties and shorts, all the while she was touching his body, feeling the energy still thrumming through him even after a full length football game. Savannah couldn&#39;t help but feel almost overwhelmed by Deion&#39;s size, but was surprised by how much control he demonstrated over himself.<br />
<br />
It was all Deion could do to not immediately take control, push on top, and get to thrusting away. That was what he would naturally consider doing. But for now he let the sex simmer, and felt her kissing down from his lips, to his neck...ooh, she kissed his nipple... and then she kept going, drawing out more gasps and then a loud moan from Deion as she kissed his manhood, bringing it into her mouth. His back straightened and he grit his teeth, &quot;Ohh fuck babe, that feels so...so...ooh...&quot;<br />
<br />
She had him now, thrashing and only barely keeping himself under control. Deion was a powerful, huge man, and he was verging on taking over in vigorous fucking going on, and Savannah knew what she was playing with. She kept teasing the head, lightly grabbing the balls, letting herself lightly touch his muscles, enjoying every second of contact...<br />
<br />
&quot;Mm...Mmph! Fuck! Savannah you gotta let me...&quot; Deion was sweating like he&#39;d never sweat before, gripping the bedsheets and lightly thrusting his hips. His muscles stood out in stark relief. Every single striation was flexed and primed, his body ready to move...<br />
<br />
And then she took her mouth off of him, making him look down and grin as she said, &quot;Come and get me, big boy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Deion was on top of her in record time, thrusting away as soon as he reliably had his manhood inside of her. His ass clenched and flexed as he pistoned away, his chest feeling tight and strong as he positioned himself over her. He grunted and groaned, trying to keep himself from cumming too soon. Every single thrust and motion threatened to catapult him to the finish line a little too soon. He bent forward, breathing and momentarily catching his breath...<br />
<br />
...And then he was going again. He was aware of her gasping, moaning and screaming from how big he was. Deion remembered all the time he had to just deal and use his hand. This was indeed the best sex he&#39;d had in such a long time. Alec certainly never could&#39;ve delighted Kayla the way he was giving this kind of experience to Savannah...<br />
<br />
Deion gasped and shouted, &quot;Mmmmotherfuck! I&#39;m cumming! Cumming!&quot;  He managed to pull out just in time and sprayed a volley of his seed over her back and then all over the bed. He groaned and wavered on his aching legs, his whole body feeling tight and worked to its limit by both the game and the sex that had come after it.<br />
<br />
Savannah was gasping and laying back, evidently she&#39;d come about two or three times in the course of his lovemaking, and she suddenly looked up at him and asked, &quot;You game for a round 2, stud?&quot;<br />
<br />
Deion looked at her rather astounded, trying to work out if he would even be able to do that with him as he was now. He nodded and looked at her confidently, &quot;I&#39;m feeling pretty tuckered out, but let&#39;s see how many times I can give it to you tonight.&quot;<br />
<br />
--------------<br />
<br />
&quot;...Just so we&#39;re clear, I&#39;m not gay.&quot; Dave said to his date as the two of them arrived at the apartment Dave had set up for their &quot;date&quot;. Dave had of course managed to arrange a whole room at a local apartment for his &quot;date&quot;, in this case a Filipino twink he&#39;d met on an online dating site. He didn&#39;t like anyone looking at his phone on the off chance they would see he had Grindr on there for when he got bored of fucking his way through the female population of the school, and then had to start looking into encounters with men.<br />
<br />
&quot;You said that like four times.&quot; Enrique Ramos was tight, toned, slight in musculature and height but well formed. His face was an effeminate sort of handsome that, together with his generous ass, brought in the so inclined men day after day. As long as he was safe, there need not be any problem with it. &quot;Just relax tonight and let&#39;s have some fun, eh?&quot;<br />
<br />
As long as nobody knows, Dave justified to himself. Much as he enjoyed the odd gay hook up, he reacted with fear and revulsion at the idea of actually coming out as any particular identification. He was straight as could be...he just liked having the odd gay encounter now and then. And then there was Deion. The new black football player both fascinated and infuriated him, and Dave wanted Deion for his bed sooner rather than later. He was a rival, and Dave fucking loved fucking his rivals.<br />
<br />
It was just a part of his psyche - a reaction to being upstaged, the way he&#39;d been when Deion rolled in. He swore that guy was making shit up when he said Dave was somehow changing. Turning...what, black or something? He&#39;d never looked whiter, Dave thought to himself as he prepared for the date. &quot;You wanna join me in the apartment jacuzzi?&quot;<br />
<br />
It was a request Dave put out there based on a few stories he&#39;d heard. And honestly, if he could, fucking his date by the jacuzzi sounded awesome and hot. It was outright turning him on right then and there.<br />
<br />
Enrique smiled when he looked down at Dave&#39;s pants, seeing the bulge present there, &quot;I...do not think either of us is going to go back here much cleaner after the jacuzzi, big man. Let&#39;s hit it.&quot;<br />
<br />
With that, Dave and Enrique left the room to go and hit up the jacuzzi...</p>
