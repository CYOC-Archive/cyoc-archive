<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Alec bend over and held his now feminine hand near his neck. His old body was still alive. Gently he lifted his old body&#39;s head and other than a small bruise there was nothing to be seen.<br />
He breathed a sigh of relief. His own body was fine, but he really needed to take better care of when he used possession. Now to do what he set out to do.<br />
<br />
He stood in the middle of the room for a moment. But how exactly was he going to get more experience this way. He jumped up and down a bit and felt his breasts jump and and down with him. Amber&#39;s body felt fit, slightly more so than his own.<br />
He dropped down on the floor and tried to do some pushups. After about the same as what he&#39;d normally be able to do he started to feel Amber&#39;s arms. He dropped himself down on the floor again,  acutely aware of his larger chest being pressed against the ground.<br />
He got back up again and searched Amber&#39;s pockets and found a key to her room and her adventurers card.<br />
<br />
He didn&#39;t really want to see her stats, but this was getting him nowhere fast.<br />
With a sigh he put her card on his bed and a small hologram popped out, showing a 3D figure of Amber.<br />

<br />
Alec felt the crushing feel of inadequecy. She had better stats than him. Not much better, but still better. Especially her intelligence. <br />
I wonder if I can use her intelligence while in her body. &quot;Ha!&quot; He laughed out loud. If only this world had the internet, he would&#39;ve tried to find some difficult puzzles to solve.<br />
<br />
But, she had magic! Which made sense considering he saw her at the Wizards guild first. But how does magic work.<br />
He waved her hands for a bit. &quot;Fireball!&quot; But nothing happened.<br />
He struck a pose like Zeus and pretended to throw a lightning bolt. &quot;Magic missile!&quot; But nothing happened. &quot;How the hell does that work?&quot;<br />
He cupped her hands by her side and thrust them forward with the palms. &quot;Hadoken!&quot; Nothing happened.<br />
He pointed at an empty cup near his bed. &quot;Water!&quot; The cup remained empty.<br />
<br />
Frustrated he read on. &quot;What kind of skill is Minor Morph Self?&quot; He wondered. &quot;Does she have the ability to turn into a kid or something?&quot;<br />
&quot;Minor morph self!&quot; But nothing happened. <br />
I should be able to use her powers right? They, at least, should be easy to use. Maybe she needs to see herself for it to work. Alec walked into the bathroom. Her body felt weird to walk with, her wider hips and lack of dick somehow caused him to sway her hips more as he walked into the bathroom. <br />
<br />
He stood before the mirror.<br />
He stared into Amber&#39;s clear green eyes. &quot;Minor morph self!&quot; But nothing happened. <br />
Wait, her other skill was infiltration right? Maybe morph in this case meant minor changes in appearance and he didn&#39;t have any changes in mind when he tried. He needed to test this.<br />
He looked at Ambers bright blue hair and pictured it pink. &quot;Minor morph self!&quot; <br />
A familiar flash followed and the blue hair was replaced with bright pink hair.<br />
&quot;Yes!&quot; Alec jumped up and fist pumped. He was immediately aware of Ambers breasts jumping up with him. <br />
Should he, he hesitated. Maybe something else first. He looked at Amber&#39;s face in the mirror. &quot;Minor morph self!&quot; A large bushy mustache appeared on Amber&#39;s upper lip and he burst out laughing.<br />
With the lowest voice Amber could manage he joked to the mirror. &quot;Well you listen here young lady!&quot; Amber&#39;s new bushy mustache wriggling wildly as he spoke. He wiped a tear from her eye as he said &quot;Minor morph self!&quot; and with that the mustache disappeared. <br />
<br />
He looked at Amber&#39;s breasts in the mirror. He pulled Amber&#39;s top off. A bright blue flower decorated bra held her ample breasts. A clasp was located in the middle of the formfitting cups. The color of the bra matched her earlier hair color, apparently Amber liked to be clothed with matching colors.<br />
<br />
Alec struggled a bit, but he managed to unclasp the bra. The cups sprang loose and Amber&#39;s breasts dropped out. They were large enough to fill his hands as he felt them and weighed them. <br />
He looked at them in the mirror. &quot;Minor morph self!&quot; He said. The breasts he was holding surged forward and spilled over his hands, ending roughly a cup larger than they&#39;d been.<br />
Alec let them go, they rested majestically on his chest. He gently stroked the large pink nipples and shuddered. That felt different from his own male nipples.<br />
&quot;Minor morph self!&quot; He said again. But the breasts didn&#39;t grow this time. &quot;Well, I guess it really was minor.&quot; He shook his shoulder causing his large breasts to bounce and dance around.<br />
<br />
He looked in the mirror again. &quot;Minor morph self!&quot;<br />
Her lips plumped up and gained a soft pinkish color. He turned with her shoulder to the mirror and pursed her thick lips while admiring the large breasts he&#39;d made. He winked seductively at himself.<br />
This was so fucking amazing. He grabbed the top and went back to his bedroom. Large breasts jiggling as he went.<br />
He dropped on the bed, sending the large breasts bouncing around wildly. Then got back up again. He put her thumbs in the edge of the skirt and took a deep breath. Was he really going to do this. How exactly was this going to help him.<br />
Experience be damned, he just wanted to see this! And it&#39;s not like Amber would find out, right? He pulled the skirt and shorts down.<br />
Amber was wearing a bright blue thong underneath.<br />
Alec looked at Amber&#39;s ass. &quot;Minor morph self!&quot; Amber&#39;s ass plumped up a size, her thong disappearing in her ass crack.<br />
He then took off the thong. Looking past the large breasts he saw Amber&#39;s pussy between his legs. Just above was a perfectly maintained pubic bush, colored the same bright blue as the panties and the original hair was.<br />
&quot;Minor morph self!&quot; The hairs disappeared, giving him an even clearer view of Amber&#39;s pussy.<br />
<br />
He&#39;d obviously seen a vagina before, but back then he wasn&#39;t attached to it. He ran her fingers across the labia and shivered. A heat was building between his legs. Not just a heat though, as a guy when he felt aroused his dick would sometimes feel like it needed to be put in something. Like it needed to be squeezed. This however felt nearly opposite. He stroked the labia again, but pushed his fingers furthers. The lips parted and a shock moved through his body.<br />
His vagina felt like it was empty, like it needed to squeeze around something instead.<br />
He started rubbing more vigorously and gasped as he found the clitoris. It was so small, but so sensitive.<br />
&quot;Minor..&quot; He breathed &quot;morph ...self!&quot; He felt the clit grow, his fingers could now grab and massage it.<br />
His pussy felt so empty. He plunged a finger into the warm wet hole and moaned. <br />
It didn&#39;t feel like it was enough. Amber&#39;s body was sweating, it needed more. He plunged two fingers in and moved them around.<br />
Another moaned escaped. He bit the plumped up lips. One hand worked her enlarged clit, the other was moving in and out of her pussy.<br />
<br />
Like in his old body, he could feel the pressure building. The climax inched closer, Amber&#39;s body tensed up, her back arched, her wide hips thrusting in the air. Alec gasped as the body found release and an orgasm rocked Amber&#39;s body. Alec shivered and gasped for air as Amber&#39;s body came.<br />
Alec lay panting on his back on the bed. It had felt different, but just as good as when he was in his own body. &quot;Fascinating&quot; he whispered.</p>
