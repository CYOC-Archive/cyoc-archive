<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jason drove down the dirt road.  He was about as happy as he possibly could get.  He had a tape worth quite a bit of money if he sold it and his knowledge properly.  Posting the footage on the internet, he realized, would not be as profitable as he first thought.  Selling it to a rival firm like Transgene would be far more lucrative.  Further, since he was the brains behind the animorph virus, he’d be able to sell that to Transgene for their military contracts.  He was sure they were trying to develop a super soldier and if he played his cards right, he’d be a multi-billionaire.  After all, the virus only remained active for three or so weeks, after that, there would have to be fresh viruses from stored stock.  That was the beauty of his design, it melded DNA, reproduced for three weeks and then what ever was not infecting a new host disintegrated into the cell instead replicating itself again.  In the wild, it would remain viable for the same amount of time and then disintegrate if it didn’t find a host.  The other thing that worked in Jason’s favor is that it only seemed to work on mammals, though he was sure he could develop other strains that would morph fish, fowl and reptiles and perhaps even insects, though the thought of metamorphosed, intelligent spiders gave him the creeps, not to mention how many eggs something like that could lay.  Insects and spiders, he decided, were where he drew the line..  His genius would make him a very invaluable man.<br />
<br />
Neither Ron nor Dick knew that Jason was the one responsible for the ‘spill’.  Knowing the virus disintegrated into uselessness after the three week timeframe meant that Jason could release all of the stored samples and destroy all but his copies of the experiment notes.  He didn’t need stock to work from, he could simply rebuild.  Those notes were safely locked away in a place that only his handprint could open.  Jason would be the only one with the knowledge and it was all in his head.<br />
<br />
Jason gloated to himself, it was early evening and in the darkened forest the road was hard to see.  He flipped on the lights just in time to see the large buck jump out into the road.  Jason instinctively swerved to avoid the deer and his front right tire picked that moment to explode.  The Jeep tumbled off the road and down into the creek.<br />
<br />
At the same time, a couple of miles up the creek in an pine thicket close by, Dick and Smokey were getting better acquainted with Rob.  Rob didn’t seem to notice that he was changing he was far too busy with the two huge bear cocks he was taking and his own mind blowing ursine orgasm.  Had he noticed the fur creeping over his naked body and the restructuring of his bone and muscle he wouldn’t have minded; Dick was right, the gift was wonderful.  It made you feel so strong, so full of life, so powerful, so very horny.<br />
<br />
When Jason came back to consciousness, he was lying on his back.  A blurry figure was giving him sips of water and washing the gash in his forehead.  He could smell gasoline, he turned his head to the left and saw the jeep crumpled about 100 yards away.  It was burning and there were figures outlined by the firelight.  They were trying to put the fire out.  His vision began to clear a little as he watched and his mind came back into focus.  He was down by the creek, the creek into which he had dumped the virus.  His head snapped back to look at whom or what was tending his wounds.  He looked right into the face of what appeared to be a pig, but the pig was obviously anthropomorphized by the virus.  He noticed the pig had large breasts and tusks that seemed to be diminished versions of what wild boar usually had.  The sow-woman had a look of genuine concern on its bristly face.<br />
<br />
Jason recoiled in horror, “My God, what have you done!”  Jason crawled away as best he could from the anthro-pig, his leg was not broken, but it was not functioning well.<br />
<br />
The sow answered Jason’s question.<br />
<br />
“We pulled you away from the wreck.  We smelled the… the… the stuff leaking from your car.  We noticed a fire had started in the front of it and moved you.  I gave you water and you took some of my milk.  In your sleep, you suckled me.”<br />
<br />
Jason’s mind was reeling, he’d been contaminated, infected and now what?  What was he going to do?  He hadn’t bothered developing a cure even if that was possible once the foreign DNA was recombined with human DNA.<br />
<br />
He felt itchy and his feet and legs both now felt strange.  His jaw hurt.  He took off his shoes and pants, heedless of the sow-woman and was horrified.  His legs were changing.  They were still legs, but the feet were becoming hoof-like, like those the sow had and he noticed bristly hairs growing on his… hocks… hams?.  He itched all over; he removed his jacket and shirt leaving him sitting there in his briefs.  He examined himself.  His chest and arms were growing bristly too and the pain in his jaw as increasing.<br />
<br />
Suddenly there was an explosion of scent; it was like turning up the volume on his sense of smell.  He could smell the forest, the burning jeep, the gasoline, the loamy soil with its fungus scent, his own somewhat fresh human cum in his briefs, like bleach, and something else.  He looked over at the sow and could smell her sex.  She was in heat and Jason knew it.  Jason’s attention was drawn to his loins.  His briefs were bulging with a growing hard-on.  He reached down to his briefs.<br />
<br />
Jason remembered the farm his uncle owned when he was a boy and how huge the stud boar’s balls were in his huge scrotum.  Ol’ Joe was his uncle’s prize boar.  Ol’ Joe was a gentle sort until breeding season.  He remembered seeing that boar fuck the breed sow and he remembered also how just watching that powerful beast had made him shoot in his shorts.  He watched with fascination as the boar literally ‘screwed’ his mate with the corkscrew penis boars have.  He also remembered a bit of trivia he’d picked up in his zoology courses: pig orgasms last for thirty minutes or more, one of the longest orgasms in the animal kingdom.<br />
<br />
He looked down as he lowered his briefs, his balls were growing, he could tell.  They were already half again as big as they normally were and they tingled warmly.  His cock was beginning to grow longer, thicker and it was twisting into a corkscrew.  It looked like a small version of Ol’ Joe’s huge member.<br />
<br />
While he was examining himself, the sow had moved closer.  She was becoming very attracted to the stranger.  She stood in front of Jason and Jason started snuffling the air, though he didn’t notice because he was fascinated with his own cock.  His nose seemed to be moving of its own will.  <br />
<br />
Jason looked up and suddenly realized just how attractive she was.  She was beautiful, why had he reacted with such disgust before?.  He reached out with his hand and touched her breast and a pain wracked his skull.  It felt like spikes were being driven into his head.  Blood gushed out of his mouth as his tusks began to grow out, thick, sharp and gleaming white.  His human teeth began to fall out and he could feel them being replaced by the hybrid boar-human ones.<br />
<br />
The sow bent down and began sucking on her new boar’s corkscrewing cock.  It seemed the right thing to do.  Jason grunted and snuffled as she touched the changing member.  He ran his fingers through the hair on her head.  He was in heaven; she smelled so good and was giving him such pleasure.  The pain had lessened in his head and now an incredible feeling washed over his body.  He thought he could feel each bristly hair push out of his skin and it felt good, but it was nothing compared to the blow job he was getting.<br />
<br />
Jason grunted and squealed as he emptied the last of his human semen into his sow’s mouth.  Yes, that was right, HIS sow!  She was his sow to mate with and his alone.  He felt he would protect her against anything.  Visions of Ol’ Joe and how he fucked played across his mind and his balls tingled with the thought.  Now he knew the power and joy with which Joe must have fucked.  Within minutes, after hurried positioning and figuring out how to fuck as a man-pig, he mounted his sow and began corkscrew fucking her.  As he did so, Jason’s tusks grew to their full length.  His balls grew larger and heavier and hung lower.  His snout pushed out, though being and anthropomorphic boar, it wasn’t nearly as long as a natural boar.  Everywhere Jason would have had a beard; he had thick dark bristles, thicker than those on the rest of his face.  A broad line of bristles, about an inch and a half wide grew down his back along his spine from his neck to his ass and a small curly tail wiggled as he thrust into his mate.  The fingers on Jason’s hand’s fused; the second and third fused and the fourth and fifth fused and grew meatier and broader than two human fingers combined.  Thick dark nails pushed out his human nails and his thumb, still opposable, grew wider, thicker and stronger.  As Jason began his thirty minute orgasm, his body completed its metamorphosis.  Jason’s neck grew thicker, his chest barreled out and his lats became massive slabs.  Jason’s biceps and thighs grew meaty with new boar muscle and though his forearms and calves were not as big in proportion, they too became strong and sinewy.  The effect was one of broad, stout, stocky power.  Jason was a boar-man.<br />
<br />
The other anthropomorphic animals gathered around and watched the mating, but the mating pair barely noticed.  Many species were represented in the small audience, but all commonly were fascinated that the human was now one of them.</p>
