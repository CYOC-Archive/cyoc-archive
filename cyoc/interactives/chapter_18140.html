<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jim stands on the pool deck and begins to head for the house. He is panicked and not thinking clearly. Thoughts rush through his head as he hears the commotion behind him, reaching for the handle on the sliding glass door he looks up at his own reflection.<br />
<br />
His skin is darker. It looks more tan than before, which is absurd since he has only been outside for a few minutes. His skin is wet from the pool and little beads of water are glistening on his skin. The outline of his dick is pretty clear through the wet speedo he wears. He doesnt have time to feel self conscious. He needs to escape. The need to get away from the madness behind him is overwhelming.<br />
<br />
Placing his hand on the door he tries to slide it over to the left and enter the house, but it wont budge. Its locked. How could the door be locked from the inside?<br />
<br />
On the other side of the glass Jim sees a man on his hands and knees in the kitchen. Escaping the pool doesnt appear to have helped. The trim athletic male appears to be swelling, his tongue is stuck out like a  dog panting, and around his neck a little shiny green collar circles him. His tongue is shiny, and as Jim watches a tail slowly grows from the guys ass, extending out and curving as it inflates and  juts from him. His hands curl in to paws and become smooth shiny white plastic at the same time as his ears which turn black and become little floppy dog ears. His nose is a black shiny bulb on his face. The look of panic in his eyes is enough for Jim. This man tried to escape the pool in to the house and changed anyway. His mouth is a grimace as he tries to resist what is happening to him but he changes anyway become a little inflated dalmatian toy. His belly is swollen and he has a little air valve in the center as his legs shrink and change.<br />
<br />
Jim tears himself away from the sight. He has to find a way out of here before he changes. He hasnt even yet considered that its too late for him. Swimming with the donkey toys was all it took for their influence to spread.<br />
<br />
He refocuses his eyes on his own reflection in the sliding glass door. He has to think. Has to calm down and focus.<br />
<br />
Jim feels a tightness between his legs, his suit is pinching him in an uncomfortable way. Automatically he reaches down and pushes it to loosen it up and hears a squeak as his hand brushes his thigh. Like a wet balloon the sound comes from his flesh on flesh, or what was flesh.<br />
<br />
Jim looks down in slow horror as if time itself is slowing down with the realization. His belly button is gone, and where it once was a little clear air valve sticks from his chest.<br />
<br />
&quot;No! Im not going to be some freaky animal toy. Fuck this party!&quot; Jim bolts for the other side of the pool where he sees a gate diving the pool yard from the rest of Toms back yard. He can escape that way, maybe jump the fence.<br />
<br />
As he crosses the hot sunbaked cement of the pool deck surrounded by men and women, some completely transformed, others in mid change, he feels himself change more.<br />
<br />
His suit is tight and pinching his cock but the pressure appears to be behind him. Reaching back he feels a lump just under his waist band. Slowly its pushing outward and his little speedo is straining under the pressure. Popping it down under the growth he releases the pressure and feels his tail sprout rapidly. His entire ass is smooth and plastic already as his tail flourishes its little tassel in rubbery inflated toy detail. Jim gasps at the feeling. Having a tail is not as weird as it gets as he feels his dick and balls change and become inflatable, balloon like in his Lycra suit they press against the fabric and he feels confined and sensual at the same time. Jim felt aroused but different, he was no longer human entirely, and parts of him were inflated, toy-like.<br />
<br />
Jim shakes his head with resolution. He doesnt want to be naked or give in to his change like the others. He rushes to the fence and places his hands on the gate latch. His fingers itch as he presses the latch. Locked!<br />
<br />
Grabbing the top of the fence he prepares to leap over it by squatting down and pulling himself up fast to aid his jump. His hands are odd though. Placing them on the top of the wooden fence he is unable to separate his fingers. Slowly his thumbs press in to his hands and begins to form fists that he cant unclench.<br />
<br />
Jim doesnt have time to wonder at his hands as they become smooth and hoof like.  He jumps up and lands atop the fence flailing madly as he crashes to the ground on the other side.<br />
<br />
Free from the pool at last... but will this halt his transformation?<br />
<br />
Jim quickly begins to run for the...</p>
