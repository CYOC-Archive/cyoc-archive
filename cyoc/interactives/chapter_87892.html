<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Casper considered transforming the last few humans on the beach, but decided against it, something about doing so felt arbitrary. Like it was cheating somehow. <br />
<br />
He noticed a handful of Synthetics had followed Ashley&#39;s example, and wore sun dresses or swim suits, but these all seemed to be for aesthetics rather than any practical purpose, and the nudist on the beach were still the vast overwhelming majority. <br />
<br />
The big example was a beautiful white wolf woman walking across the beach with a yellow sun dress her tail swinging in the air, holding an open parasol. <br />
<br />
He did notice what the hotdog vendor was selling (now a rubber light brown monkey with cartoon like eyes) was now more suited to Synthetics than humans, maybe they were simply his larger customer base here. After all, this did seem to be the &#39;go to&#39; beach for Synthetics now. <br />
<br />
He also noticed that many of the younger girls had again been &#39;upgraded&#39; in the chest department. One of the naked busty rubber bunnie girls stepped on a rusted nail hidden in the surf, and her foot suffered no damage while the rusted nail bent sideways. It seemed being barefoot wasn&#39;t really a danger to Synthetics. Then again, suffering from the elements, and modesty, all seemed to be meaningless concepts to their kind. <br />
<br />
He saw a couple policemen going down the street on bicycles. He used the ring, letting them unconscious decide themselves. One became a wolf, and the other a cougar. Though it seemed they stayed true to the template established before, with POLICE in yellow on their deep navy blue backs, and their skin being sky blue. Casper wondered if they were born or made like that, or whether it was a form of dye job or modification. Either way, they pedaled bare footed on their bikes still. Both wearing their duty belt, radio, hat, and their badges hung around their necks with their barcodes. <br />
<br />
But both were effectively naked. A blue patch over their nozzles. They continued on their circuit without even stopping. <br />
<br />
It seemed the powers that be didn&#39;t mind him changing police, then again, they WERE still doing their duty to the best of their ability, so it wasn&#39;t like had made into his minions or anything. <br />
<br />
336.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wanna take a stroll on the bottom of the ocean?&quot; Ashley asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Something I remember now! Let me show you!&quot; <br />
<br />
At Casper&#39;s protests, the rubber lizard pulled him into the surf, and underwater. They were filled with air, so the real challenge was staying UNDER water and not simply floating to the top. <br />
<br />
Casper gasped for breath, only to realize he was breathing just fine. <br />
<br />
&quot;&#39;Ool &#39;uh?&quot; Ashley tried to say underwater. <br />
<br />
&quot;&#39;Uss &#39;O,&quot; Casper replied. <br />
<br />
Their voices were muffeled and muted, but that aside they were doing fine. Casper felt the water pressure on him, but his body resisted it the way the bunnie girl had resisted being punctured by the rusted nail. Their voices couldn&#39;t travel farther than a six feet or so at most, but as long as they didn&#39;t accidentally didn&#39;t float to the top, Casper had to admit, the view underwater was fantastic! <br />
<br />
He was naked, underwater, seeing a view most humans never would. It was incredibly seeing the deep blue sea beyond and before him. <br />
<br />
He saw a scuba diver checking out some barnacles that had grown on the nearby peer who waved at them and Ashley waved back.<br />
<br />
Casper used the ring, and the scuba diver, rather than become a seal or a fish, became an bald eagle with blue wings, white belly, and red claws. Didn&#39;t see that coming. <br />
<br />
He was also now naked, except for a machine on his back that Casper didn&#39;t recognize, but its purpose seemed to be to DECREASE his buoyancy so he could sink easier. Casper didn&#39;t know a thing about scuba before, so he didn&#39;t gain any NEW knowledge about Synthetic divers worked. <br />
<br />
The diver practically flew underwater. Ashley and Casper sat down underwater and simply watched him as he went about his work. <br />
<br />
337.<br />
<br />
Casper actually went into a trance state, his version of sleeping as he felt the waves wash over him. Ashley shook him.<br />
<br />
&quot;&#39;Ime &#39;o &#39;o.&quot;<br />
<br />
Casper nodded, and out of the surf they went. <br />
<br />
Many of the naked rubber anthros had gone home, with humans coming in to fill their place. <br />
<br />
He only changed one family, who by their own desires became a black mouse, a white ducky, (two boys) and their parents who became a pair of gold and bronze fennec or desert foxes, naked as Casper and Ashley. <br />
<br />
341.<br />
<br />
The pair saw the father pay for a snack for his family by his rear being scanned. Ashley blinked and looked at Casper who shrugged remember his own surprise at it happening to him. <br />
<br />
Finding the scanner on a nearby payphone that miraculously still worked in this age of cellphones, which had again the scanner, Casper called Lana&#39;s cell phone. <br />
<br />
She told him when and where to meet and what movie they were going to go see (a super hero science fiction movie a walking tree and a normal FURRY cyborg raccoon and a host of other crazy hero types). And when and where to go. <br />
<br />
Ashley and Casper decided to get to the theater early. <br />
<br />
Changing that many at once had NOT been pleasant. So Casper wasn&#39;t sure about changing everyone in the theater audience at once, but he did have a way he could pace it out some. <br />
<br />
As it happened, Lana and her two friends were early too. Lana was still naked as her friends, but had a shoulder bag with her, implying she had come from practice. <br />
<br />
&quot;Not going with Tommy?&quot; Casper asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;His practice ran long, the coach wants to be sure we win next game.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Gotcha.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Hi Ashley! How&#39;s it going?&quot; Lana causally asked the rubber lizard girl. <br />
<br />
Ashley stuttered, remembering that according to her memories, she and Lana had met before, being a childhood friend of Casper . . . and being the one who claimed him after Casper and Lana decided they were better off being just friend. <br />
<br />
&quot;Just Fine Lana.&quot;<br />
<br />
The two naked rubber pink hedgehogs were introduced as Janet (the one with the ballon chest), and Casey. <br />
<br />
The ticket booth didn&#39;t have a scanner, but it did once Casper used the ring. The boy behind the counter became a bright blue minotaur, who of course, still wore the jacket and hat that were part of employee standards for the theater. <br />
<br />
342.<br />
<br />
Of course . . . ugh . . . Casper paid for all four ladies. The more things changed, the more things stayed the same. <br />
<br />
The snack bar didn&#39;t have much in the way for Synthetics . . . until Casper let the two behind the counter became what they wanted to be. The girl became a purple feline bombshell that left Casper&#39;s jaw hanging open and actually made Ashley elbow him a bit. The lad became a golden antelope that made Janet an Casey drool (if Synthetics actually did that). <br />
<br />
343.<br />
<br />
The group bought some bags of plastic caps and some a few drunks of liquid polymer. <br />
<br />
The five Synthetics were the first ones into the theater and naturally took the best seats. <br />
<br />
Ashley whispered, &quot;So what&#39;s the plan?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m still going to let them unconsciously decide their colors and species. I think I&#39;ll do that from now on. If I got to choose my species and colors, then I&#39;m being a jerk if I don&#39;t let them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ooooh a conscience, that might be trick in this line of work,&quot; Ashley teased. <br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe. But at least it&#39;s keeping me from like you said, creating my own harem or making everyone vote MY way.&quot;<br />
<br />
A nuclear family with two daughters came in first. Amazingly, all four became horse Synthetics. The father became light brown with a dark brown mane and tail. The mother became shinny gray with a blond mane and yellow eyes. Her youngest daughter became a grayish violet color with a blond mane too. Her daughter became a light violet body and a light purple mane. <br />
<br />
All four naked rubber horse balloon people sat down in front of the collage students. The youngest filly hopping up and down in her seat, her mother calling her &#39;her littler super-ball.&#39; <br />
<br />
&quot;Isn&#39;t she a little young for this movie?&quot; Asked Ashley spying the younger daughter.<br />
<br />
&quot;When has that ever stopped parents?&quot; Casper asked, it was a superhero movie, that meant kids wanted to go see it, simple as that. <br />
<br />
347.<br />
<br />
&#39;Let&#39;s see how many people are seeing this movie tonight.&#39; Casper thought. If the movie was popular enough, he might even hit past the 500 mark! Assuming that OTHER anthros didn&#39;t come to see this particular sowing of this movie as well. But either way . . . with many seats, Casper was confident about his odds.</p>
