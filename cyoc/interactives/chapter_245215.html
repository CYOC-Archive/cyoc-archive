<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dave was losing focus again.<br />
<br />
It wasn’t the heat, though the summer sun was baking the site hard enough to make his jeans cling to his thighs like shrink wrap. It wasn’t exhaustion either. No, it was the fact that every guy on the crew had a cock—and lately, that was all Dave could think about. Not their faces, not their names, not even their asses—just the dicks. The ones barely hidden by fabric. The ones bouncing in boxers. The ones probably soft and heavy and sweaty from a morning of lifting sheet rock.<br />
<br />
It was like his eyes just slid down to every crotch around him. Automatically. Every time. His cock was twitching again in his pants, dribbling pre-cum into his underwear just from the sight of bulges shifting in tight pants. It was like he had a magnet for cock. Or a radar. His head kept filling with thoughts he didn’t even recognize as his own.<br />
<br />
And the worst part? He liked it.<br />
<br />
“Jesus Christ,” he muttered, ducking behind the stack of drywall for a second and fumbling out his phone.<br />
<br />
The Chronivac app was already open—he didn’t even remember unlocking it. Just habit now. He glanced at the interface lazily as it pinged nearby bodies.<br />
<br />
<b>Nearby Target Detected:<br />
Matt – 2.3m<br />
Libido: 64%<br />
Inhibition: 42%<br />
Curiosity: 15%<br />
Attraction to You: 8%</b><br />
<br />
Matt.<br />
<br />
Of course it was Matt.<br />
<br />
The same guy he had in mind when he cranked up his attractiveness and slapped on the muscle mass. Dave hadn’t touched Matt’s settings. Hadn’t needed to. He figured Matt already leaned the right way. He just had to look like something Matt might be into. Maybe smell like it too. That new pheromone nudge had to be doing something, right?<br />
<br />
Still, Dave hovered over the sliders for a second—just long enough to justify it.<br />
<br />
He didn’t want to <i>change</i> anything. Just nudge.<br />
<br />
He dropped Matt’s Inhibition to 30%, Curiosity to 25%, and barely tapped Attraction to 12%. Just enough to open a door if there <i>was</i> one. Just enough to see what might happen. Nothing aggressive. Nothing that would read as mind control. Just… encouragement.<br />
<br />
Matt wandered over during break like he always did, tank top already off, pants slung low enough to see waistband.<br />
<br />
“Shit’s hot today,” he said, wiping sweat off his forehead and letting the shirt hang from his shoulder. “You good, man? You’ve been quiet.”<br />
<br />
“Just hot,” Dave mumbled, trying not to stare too long.<br />
<br />
Matt gave him a once-over, eyebrow raised.<br />
<br />
“Have you been working out or something?” he asked. “You’re lookin’... I dunno. Bigger.”<br />
<br />
Dave shrugged. “Been trying to take better care of myself.”<br />
<br />
Matt laughed, then stretched his arms overhead—taut, cocky, loose. The waistband shifted. The bulge bounced once. Dave nearly groaned.<br />
<br />
There was a shape. A curve. The kind of shape that made his brain short-circuit lately.<br />
<br />
“I need some water,” Matt said, cracking open a bottle.<br />
<br />
“I need… something,” Dave whispered to himself, a little too low to be heard.<br />
<br />
Matt leaned against the trailer wall. His chest was heaving gently. His throat gleamed with sweat. His pants hung just a bit lower now. Dave’s cock throbbed, rubbing painfully against denim.<br />
<br />
And something in his head just snapped.<br />
<br />
Like a breaker flipped.<br />
<br />
He stepped forward. Slowly. Then dropped to his knees in the dirt before he even realized what he was doing.<br />
<br />
“Dude?” Matt asked. Confused, not alarmed.<br />
<br />
Dave didn’t answer.<br />
<br />
He was already reaching for the zipper.<br />
<br />
He didn’t <i>think</i>. He just <i>moved</i>. The Chronivac app was still humming softly in his pocket. He hadn’t touched anything new. This wasn’t about programming anymore.<br />
<br />
Matt didn’t stop him.<br />
<br />
Didn’t say anything else.<br />
<br />
Dave undid the fly and eased the jeans down just enough to free Matt’s cock. It bounced out, thick and uncut, already swelling from the heat and attention. Dave’s mouth watered. His head swam.<br />
<br />
It wasn’t about Matt.<br />
<br />
It was about this. <i>The cock</i>.<br />
<br />
He leaned forward and inhaled. Deep. Sweat. Musk. Skin. His tongue darted out before he even gave himself permission. He just needed a taste.<br />
<br />
Matt hissed through his teeth. “You don’t have to—”<br />
<br />
But Dave was already doing it. Lips parting. Tongue sliding under the shaft. The head pushed into his mouth, warm and heavy. He moaned like it was a fucking religious experience.<br />
<br />
His jaw ached. His lips tingled. He could feel spit sliding down his chin. But all he could focus on was cock. The taste. The smell. The way it felt to have one in his mouth.<br />
<br />
Almost without thinking, Dave popped open the button of his own jeans and slipped his hand down. His cock was already painfully hard, slick with a steady stream of pre-cum. He wrapped his fingers around the shaft and started pumping slowly, in rhythm with the motion of his mouth. Each bob of his head sent heat crackling through his grip, each taste of skin making the strokes feel dirtier. More necessary.<br />
<br />
Matt groaned again and braced himself against the trailer, hips twitching once.<br />
<br />
Dave kept going—sucking harder, stroking faster. He was moaning around the shaft now, the vibration making Matt shudder above him.<br />
<br />
“I’m—fuck—I’m close,” Matt muttered.<br />
<br />
Dave pulled off, gasping, hand still stroking, eyes locked on Matt’s cock.<br />
<br />
And then—<i>Matt came</i>.<br />
<br />
Thick white ropes spilled out onto the dirt, hot and fast, dripping down his shaft as he gasped through clenched teeth.<br />
<br />
That was all it took.<br />
<br />
Dave’s own orgasm hit like a sucker punch—deep, sudden, no warning. His cock jerked violently in his grip, spraying hot cum up his shirt, across his belly, even flecking his chin. His entire body spasmed once, hard enough that he nearly toppled forward onto the ground.<br />
<br />
He moaned low and long, still pumping himself as the aftershocks rippled through him. It was overwhelming—pure sensory overload, made worse (or better) by the scent of fresh cum in the air and the taste still clinging to his tongue. His knees buckled as he gasped, cock twitching weakly in his hand.<br />
<br />
Matt zipped up, catching his breath.<br />
<br />
“You’re full of surprises, man,” he said casually. “Guess we’re cool.”<br />
<br />
He walked off, shaking his head like he was trying to reboot.<br />
<br />
Dave stayed kneeling a second longer, panting. His hands were a mess. His lips tingled. His heart was still racing like he’d sprinted uphill.<br />
<br />
He glanced down at his phone.<br />
<br />
The Chronivac app was still open.<br />
<br />
A notification pulsed softly across the screen.<br />
<br />
<i>Sexual Pattern Logged: Orgasm successfully achieved during partnered encounter. Would you like to enable &#39;Familiar Partner Reinforcement&#39; to increase arousal and satisfaction in future interactions with this partner profile?</i><br />
<br />
<b>New Setting Available: Familiar Partner Reinforcement<br />
<br />
[YES] [NO] [Learn More]</b><br />
<br />
Dave blinked blearily at the screen, brain still fogged from the orgasm.<br />
<br />
He didn’t even read the fine print.<br />
<br />
Just tapped <b>Yes</b>.</p>
