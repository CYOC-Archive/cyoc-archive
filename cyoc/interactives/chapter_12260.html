<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Eric felt the electric pulse pass through him and glanced two bodies over at Tony.  That was the body he wanted.  If he couldn't be powerful, he wanted the speed and athleticism of Tony.  Eric felt his body slimming, but that didn't narrow the field much.  All four of the others weighed much less than him.  He saw his body hair disappearing and that ruled out Jeff's body which was just as hairy as his.  His penis became uncircumcised, a long droopy foreskin forming over the end of his organ.  His pubic hair changed a bit, but remained dark colored and that ruled out fire crotched Jack.  <br />
<br />
Eric exulted at the prospect of being model faced Tony.  But when the process finished, he looked to the body next to him and saw that Jeff had become Tony.  What's more, Jeff, in Tony's body, was four or five inches taller than he was.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh shit!  I'm fucking Mark!  We gotta do this over&quot; complained Eric, sounding particularly odd to the others complaining about Mark in Mark's voice.  &quot;We gotta do this over!&quot;<br />
&quot;Why?&quot; asked Tony two bodies over in the red haired corpus of his best friend Jack.<br />
&quot;Oh come on.  This is terrible for me&quot;<br />
&quot;So . . it's okay to put it on someone else?  No way.&quot; said JeffTony.  &quot;You took the risk of not getting the other body you most wanted same as the rest of us.  Now you're Mark.  Deal with it for 8 or 9 days till Sunday after next&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He wanted Tony's ass&quot; added Jack with a laugh, compounding the humiliation by telling Eric off with his own body.  &quot;I can access his memories from right before the switch.  He wanted that round little ass for himself&quot; added Jack and he gave a little slap to JeffTony's buns.<br />
<br />
Eric wanted to push the issue some more but the others just went on without him picking the right clothes for their new bodies out of the pile in front of them.  A thought ocurred to him, watching his own body.  Jack was now inside it.  Jack.<br />
&quot;You'd better play hard at the game tomorrow, Jack!&quot;<br />
Jack slapped his belly with both hands.  &quot;I'll play as hard as my big ol' belly lets me play!  I'm quite a porker, you know, Mark, oops, I mean Eric&quot;<br />
&quot;That's not funny, man, you've gotta play your best tomorrow&quot;<br />
&quot;Why wouldn't I?&quot;<br />
&quot;I don't know.  Why don't you play hard in phys ed some of the time?&quot;<br />
&quot;Um, maybe because it's boring?  Calm down little man&quot; said Jack and he used Eric's muscular arm to effortlessly pushing still naked EricMark back onto the bed.  Before Eric could jump back up and confront him, he was confronted by Jeff's body.  By process of elimination, he realized it was Mark.  <br />
&quot;You'd better live up to your own words&quot; growled MarkJeff.  &quot;You'd better do your best tomorrow in my body&quot;<br />
&quot;Why, what've you got-&quot; began Eric and he suddenly recalled from Mark's memory, that he would be giving a performance tomorrow.  He, Mark or EricMark now, would be the lead dancer in the ballet school's production tomorrow night.<br />
&quot;Oh no!  No!  That's too much!&quot;<br />
&quot;No it's not.  It's what I've been doing for a couple months now and if you've got my body, it's what you're going to be doing&quot;<br />
&quot;But . . ballet?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yeah, ballet.  The guy from TransDem said that Tony was perfect for it, that time when Emma Chase forced him into it.  The guy said that his body was perfect for it and that he was really good at it.  Well, I'm giving it a try and I'm really good at it.  You will be, too&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh jeez.  There's no way out of this?&quot;  All his friends made it clear, that, no, there wasn't.  In short order, TonyasJack, MarkasJeff and JackasEric left.  Everyone agreed to leave the chronivac there, with JeffasTony rather than letting Mark take it with him just because he had Jeff's body now.  JeffasTony spent some time putting the chronivac into hiding.  While he did, Eric went over to the bathroom to inspect his new body.  He peeled off the clothes he had just hurriedly put back on and stared at this slender boy he'd become in the mirror.  He weighed and measured himself.  5'8&quot; tall and 115 pounds.  At first, it was almost offensive to his football player's sensibilities.  115 pounds!  But the more he inspected this new body, the more he grudgingly allowed himself to see its virtues.  He patted the parts of his new body and commented on it as though it was someone else.<br />
&quot;Hmmm . . good delts for 115 pounds . . good calves and excellent tight abs . . nice traps, too . . a V back almost automatically, this waist is so small.  God I'm thin in the middle . . and, wow, look at those glutes!  Could you pack any more muscle behind hips this narrow?&quot;<br />
He pulled his clothes back on and stepped closer to the mirror to stare intently at this new face.  What a pretty boy!  Eric remained engrossed in his new countenance until he heard a giggle behind him.  The door to the bathroom had fallen open and Cindy St. Martin was shaking her head looking at him.<br />
&quot;Are you gonna fall in love with looking at yourself in the mirror again, like you did a month or two ago.  That was too weird.  You-&quot;<br />
&quot;Shut up little bitch&quot; EricasMark muttered under his breath and walked past her to his room intending to familiarize himself with it.  But he didn't stay there long.  Cindy immediately ran down the stairs complaining to her mother.  &quot;Mom!  Mark called me a bitch!  Mark called me a bitch!&quot;<br />
Oh jeez is she gonna make a huge deal out of that?  She did.  EricasMark had barely set foot in his room when his pudgy mother bounded up the stairs and into his room and took him by the hand.  EricasMark felt quite sure that he could resist her physically but knew he had to go along with the usual flow of things.  He followed the pull of her hand down to the master bedroom.  There, to his amazement, he was bent over his mother's knees, his pants and shorts pulled back and his round little ass whacked with a hairbrush a score of times as hard as his pudgy new mother could manage.  All the while, she chewed him out for misogyny and being an uncouth little animal.  At the end, she pushed him away to the floor.  EricasMark stumbled to his feet, shocked at being treated so callously and ran up to Tony's room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Did you see that?!  She spanked my bare ass!&quot;<br />
&quot;Use your Mark memory&quot;<br />
&quot;Huh?&quot;<br />
&quot;Use Mark's memory.  I've been going through Tony's.  I think Tony knows of her doing it to you about 8 or 10 times.  She spanked Tony a few less times than that&quot;<br />
<br />
Eric thought of being spanked and thought of Mark and memories started rushing forward.  With some practice, Eric became adept at tapping into Mark's memories.<br />
<br />
The next day was Eric's introduction to ballet.  He dreaded it all day, but had packed his leotard, tights and dance belt in the gym bag that he took to junior high with him.  Mark was only in 7th grade.  EricasMark tried to just stay quiet during the school day.  He couldn't meet with his metamorphosed friends who could all get together in high school.  He was surprised at all the attention he got from 7th grade girls.  Mark appeared to be quite popular, which surprised Eric because he thought Mark was as much of a nerd as Tony.  How popular would he be if everyone knew he was a ballet dancer, even if he was a star at it?  <br />
<br />
At the end of the school day, a nervous EricasMark ran out of the junior high.  Partly it was to get ahead of the other kids so that they wouldn't see him enter the ballet school a mile away.  But also, after a few seconds, he realized that he was now a terrific runner, floating along at a near full sprint almost effortlessly.<br />
<br />
He entered glanced quickly around as he approached the dance school and then ran inside.  He exchanged hellos with the school's owner and clsas instructor.  Using Mark's memory, he figured where to change and, not without ambivalence, how.  He pulled the wedgie jock, dance belt he remembered the term now, up and pulled on his leotard and tights as his Mark memory told him he should.  EricasMark looked at himself in a mirror and shook his head.  He let out a long slow exhale and stepped out into the studio.  Some girls were arriving now, too.  He almost turned around to avoid being seen.  But the girls were very friendly with him.  He felt tremendously anxious.  His round ass was on display.  His male equipment was pulled up in a hemisphere that was practically presented to anyone in front of him.  But slowly he worried less.  Slowly he became acclimated.  Slowly he became comfortable even dressed in skintight white tights and top.  The process accelerated when he got to jump and dance.  He was a terrific jumper.  He challenged the other two boys present and any of the girls to try to match him and easily jumped higher and farther than any of them.  He took ballet class till 4 and then hung around with most of the dancers for their performance.  They were going to dance part of Le Corsaire and another ballet.  EricasMark would have lead roles in both.  He scoured his Mark memory for the steps and danced all his steps as a sort of solo practice while waiting.  When time for the performance came, he was confident.  He put everything he had into the performance and was proud of the applause and congratulations he got afterwards.  He hung around for a half hour talking to a man who was some sort of scout for a large ballet company's school.  He wanted Mark to join and attend.  &quot;We wish we had more boys with athletic ability like you coming into ballet&quot; he said.  EricasMark wouldn't make an official commitment but gave positive indications to the man.<br />
<br />
When he was just about to leave, he suddenly saw JeffasTony by the door.  He was there to walk his little brother home and make sure there weren't any problems.  There weren't, but Eric appreciated the gesture.  He could tell that Jeff felt protective toward him and he felt a sort of allegiance to his big brother.  They stuck together through the continued bizarre treatment they got from their new parents.  On some days, Mrs. St. Martin cooked a full meal, a full meal for 3 and reheated leftovers for Tony and Mark.  They noticed that there were two tv's in the house, one that Mr. St. Martin seldom seemed to leave and another in Cindy's room.  There were two phones, one in the kitchen and one in Cindy's room.  Mrs. St. Martin usually picked Cindy up at the private girls' school she attended but didn't bother to pick up Tony and Mark at their public schools, which were actually farther away.  <br />
<br />
Eric saw Jeff fall almost completely into Tony's intellectual interests and found himself similarly falling into Mark's.  &quot;I used to laugh at some of the shit the guy spent his time thinking about&quot; prefaced JeffasTony, &quot;but now that I have all his memory, some of it seems completely cool&quot;.  EricasMark nodded agreement.  &quot;I spent three hours Tuesday night looking out the window and checking against this astronomical chart.  Three hours!&quot;.  <br />
<br />
Everything wasn't intellectual.  Eric tried out his new penis a half dozen times while in Mark's body.  The uncircumcised organ was impressive both in size and length and Eric was quite sure that Jeff had tried out Tony's at least as often.  <br />
<br />
Even more amazing to Eric than seeing why Mark had intellectual interests was that he came to see being dressed in ballet tights and dancing in his new body as commonplace and as fun.  He didn't hesitate for a moment to be in front of people dressed like that.  Of course, it helped that everyone he met told him he was the best boy dancer they'd seen.<br />
<br />
But even ballet counted among the things he would miss when he stripped and stepped in front of the chronivac at the appointed time.  He loved feeling the mass and strength of his body restored but could acknowledge now that even reed thin Mark had considerable strengths.</p>
