<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was going on 3:00 and Will had spent the last two hours trying on some more clothes and posing for the camera, he wanted to be done with it and not have to deal with Jake being there taking the pictures with him. “He wouldn’t shut up until it was done. That’s just the way he is…” He reasoned, he used most of Eva’s wardrobe over the two hours, she had to do some kind of modeling with all these outfits. She even had an outfit that he’d found the first look through in the bikini drawer. Will couldn’t resist seeing himself in it. It was a, what he’d heard been called, bando sling, first he tied the sheer pink nylon top over his considerable breasts, it took him a minute but he managed to tie it securely in place. <br />
<br />
Next he stepped into the bottom of the outfit and was amazed at how odd it felt as he pulled it up his body. It was basically a thong that covered a three-inch strip of pink satin running from his crotch up his chest, between his breasts, where two strings split around the neck and down his backside. He was smirking into the mirror at his sexy reflection. “My god what a knock out, I can’t wait to get back to Megan…I have all this pent up…mmm…” He shuddered at the thought, he’d managed not to touch his sex the entire time say for when the photo required it, but his resistance was slowly waning. “Should be back to her by tonight, where the hell is Jake dammit!” He sighed, stepping into the silver heels to complete the image and posed several times for the camera, noting how well this outfit showed his rear.<br />
<br />
After a while he boiled down to just trying on various sets of sexy underwear for the camera, until finally it was full of images. He shrugged as he scanned through some of them as he undressed and pulled on a nice comfortable pair of cotton panties, they were black with Victoria’s secret written all over. Each picture screamed femininity, him in various acts in the pictures, different outfits, in one he’d even gotten Eva’s dildo up to his mouth and kissed it. He even went so far as to place the tip at the edge of his pussy lips, but nothing further. Still, he was pleased with the images, he wished Megan had done some of those things in the pictures, even just dressing up for him. “Oh well, maybe things will change.” <br />
<br />
 Without really thinking about it, Will was getting himself ready to workout. He pulled on a red spandex/nylon sports bra, it held his breasts firmly and covered down to his abdominal area. Will then grabbed a pair of leggings with the same material but in black. Finally, realizing what he was doing as he was lost in thought, Will looked down at the leggings, they seemed to grip every contour of his lower frame perfectly. Showing off every sexy line his body had to offer from top to bottom. “Man, this auto-pilot thing has to stop…well, no harm. I guess I could use the run.” He looked into the mirror, putting his hair in a wild ponytail before he put on some white ankle socks and a pair of Eva’s running shoes and walked to the gym downstairs.<br />
<br />
Soon he was over at the treadmill, stretching a bit before standing on the machine. Will started the machine off slowly, warming up first at a quick walk. Soon he was ready for a full on jog, his body seemed quite adept at it. Will’s breathing was steady so he increased it a little more, feeling like he had more energy than as a man. Though there was definitely a difference running as a woman than as a man, the breasts being a huge part. They bounced and though the bra helped it could only do so much, he slowed down a bit to prevent this. He kept it at a steady pace and continued for almost an hour before finally throwing in the towel, his breathing was still only slightly labored but he felt he needed to at least change it up.<br />
<br />
He moved to pick up some free weights, trying his best to pick up the fifty pounders at the same time. Will did manage to move them but only enough to get them off the rack, the weight of them pulled his small frame with, causing him to fall to the floor. “Shit…I’m way weaker…this blows…” He moved down the rack, trying each smaller size until he reached the ten pound weights, sighing he began doing reps, alternating arms. He wasn’t altogether sure what workouts a girl would be doing, only what he knew as a guy, which probably wouldn’t help very little. As Will pumped the weights, he moved over to the area of the gym that was clear except for; a mat on the floor and a rather large exercise ball, and on the wall was a flat panel TV with a small dvd player hooked up underneath.<br />
<br />
Placing the weights next to the mat, finding it really straining now. Will walked over to the TV, flipping it on along with the DVD player. After a moment, Will stepped back and waited for the DVD to start playing, it soon began a workout video specifically designed for the ball and mat in front of him. “Well, it couldn’t hurt to give it a shot, you’re only a girl once.” He joked to himself as he began watching the DVD more intently. “Welcome to Advanced Ball Exercises.” Will chuckled, how hard could it be. He soon found out it was more taxing than he thought but was able to catch on after a bit. The lady on the screen coached several different positions, working on various parts of the body, glutes, calves, thighs and abs. Ball balances, butt lifts, leg lifts, hip extensions and ab rolling were just some of the positions he had to do.<br />
<br />
It wasn’t long before Will was feeling the burn from the workout he made it about twenty minutes before he felt like he couldn’t do anymore. He wiped his brow with a towel, patting down the rest of his glistening body. “Maybe I should go shopping…I don’t know…it’s just an hour more then Jake will be here and I’ll be a man…no sense in wasting money…” Plus he didn’t want to draw attention to himself leaving his friends house, a strange attractive girl. Debbie would kill them both no matter whom he was inside. He noticed while trying on bras that Eva’s clothes fit almost perfect, but Eva’s breasts were a little bigger than his, which made her bras ill fitting on Will. <br />
<br />
“No biggie.” Will shrugged as he walked into the nearby bathroom, stripping off his workout clothes and throwing them into the hamper. “I’ll have to wash Eva’s clothes before I go, she’s kind of a spaz about her things.” Will said remember one time when he got scolded by her just for taking a sip of her pop by mistake. Taking the hair-tie out of his hair and running his fingers through his lush main of hair. <br />
<br />
Will jumped in the shower once the temperature was just right. The heat of the water relaxed him almost to the point of passing out right there. He quickly washed himself before he got too relaxed. His fingers felt around his pelvic area as he lathered up with soap, feeling the area around the small strip of pubic hair. “No stubble…not even a hint of it.” It had only been a day and he knew that it was definitely possible to go more than one day without shaving there. But looking at it, it almost seemed devoid of any hair at all, like it was indefinitely smooth minus the small strip. “I wonder if it would be gone forever if I shaved it off…”<br />
<br />
That made Will more curious, he felt his body where girls usually had hair growth; underarms, thighs and he even double checked his forearms. All of it smooth as a baby’s butt, though his legs did show signs of hair growth, but even so the hair was so soft and fine and would go unnoticed for several days if wanted. “Very selective alteration…wonder why it would keep the leg hair…weird magic.” He shrugged, comforted that he didn’t have to shave that day or ever for that matter. Continuing washing his all too feminine body, Will played with the jewelry that dangled from his firm belly. His hands ventured to the ring in his nipple, tugging on it, he felt a sharp jolt, a mixture of pleasure and pain, shiver through him.<br />
<br />
Will’s nipples became erect almost immediately from the stimulation, Will had to hold back a gasp from it. “Damn…this body is so sensitive…almost a shame to waste it.” About to reach for his wanting sex, Will regained his control, knowing that the body was enhanced from the vial and didn’t know if he enjoyed himself too much bad things might happen. Regardless, he cleaned himself down below, ignoring any sense of pleasure he was feeling, even ignoring the ultra-feminine smell of the body wash over his body. Without much more exploring, Will finished with soaping up his face before rinsing his entire body off. Putting some shampoo in his hair he made sure to get the chlorine out of the blonde locks.<br />
<br />
“Shit, it’s like my body knows more than I do!” Will said slightly frustrated, the magic was infiltrating his thoughts, most of the time without him realizing it. He made certain to keep his mind focused and not let it happen again without his knowledge. Turning the water off, Will grabbed another towel and patted himself dry, being careful not to snag the nipple and belly rings. Drying his hair, briefly, he let it drop to his upper back, still a little wet. Wrapping the towel around the chest, Will walked over to the mirror, clearing some of the fog with his delicate hand. In the mirror was a beautiful, blue-eyed blonde and though he knew the girl was probably a little older. But she looked as though she were seventeen without the make up to mature her.<br />
<br />
Sighing, Will looked around and saw there was a closet at the other end of the bathroom that he failed to notice more than once. He walked over and opened the closet, inside were nightgowns, robes and lingerie, but much more practical than what was upstairs. “So the girl is normal after all.” Will grabbed a white satin sleeveless robe, though in the darkness of the closet he hadn’t realized just how see-through it actually was. Draping the towel over the shower he grabbed the robe and tied the sash in a bow. Looking down the patterns seemed to hide everything nicely but from a further distance it was practically hiding nothing.<br />
<br />
Making his way upstairs, Will noticed the bottom of the robe was really flaring open from his quick movement, he had to keep his hands on his thighs to keep himself from flashing with each step. Walking into his bedroom, Will grabbed the camera, figuring he might as well load them up while he still had the time. Grabbing another pair of panties from Eva’s drawers, another cotton pair, he shook his head. “Hmm, this won’t match…what the hell, no one’s around and I still have half an hour to do it, get back and change into something plain before Jake gets home.” He put the cotton ones back and grabbed a pair of the v-string satin ones that were white like the robe. <br />
<br />
Pulling the strings of the panties up around his legs, he now felt the familiar sensation of the string resting between his soft cheeks. Will combed his hands through his thick wet hair before walking back toward the stairs. A few trickles of water dripped from his hair down onto his chest, the cool water made his nipples poking the sheer fabric. Feeling the familiar tingle, Will ignored it once again. <br />
<br />
Reaching the bottom Will slipped into some sandals that had a two-inch sole, the heel was raised a little higher, pointing his toes more to the ground. He was getting used to it, Eva’s shoes were nearly all like that and he was becoming very good at walking in them, even if it was his first day trying it. When Will had tried on Eva’s heels earlier he had to take short steps to keep his balance, but the wider sandals meant he could stride rather normally.<br />
<br />
A smirk crossed Will’s face, he could feel the sexy saunter and sway of his hips as he moved along the cement walkway. Looking up at the large brick home, which was purposefully given an antiquated aesthetic appeal, opposing the fresh look of the pool house, making it grander. “God I wish I’d had a daddy who hit it rich.” He chuckled, opening the back entrance to the mansion, which connected to the kitchen. Oddly he didn’t hear the alarm beep, shrugging, he closed the door behind him. “Jake must’ve left it off for me.” Will said to himself as he walked into the kitchen area, and it wasn’t too long before he heard the sound of clicking the hardwood floor.<br />
<br />
Will wasn't sure who it was and he'd been too stunned to turn around and leave.</p>
