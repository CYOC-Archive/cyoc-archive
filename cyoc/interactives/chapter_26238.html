<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><p>“Come on Dan, choose your destiny,” Kat said.</p>

<p>“Um,” Dan said.</p>

<p>“Very well, since you took so long, you'll become a …”</p>

<p>“Kangaroo!” Dan yelled.</p>

<p>“Really?” Kat asked.</p>

<p>“Sure, why not. I'll be a roo,” Dan said.</p>

<p>“Meh, it’s your life Dan,” Kat said. She flicked her wand and Dan felt a wave of dizziness go through him. As it did, images of hopping under the hot outback sun filled his mind. A desire to much on grass and plants nearly overcame him. “Boing!”</p>

<p>The sensation faded and Dan looked at Kat. “What was that?”</p>

<p>Kat grinned and folded her arms. “Silly roo, what do you think it was?”</p>

<p>“Okay Kat, the game is over. What do you really…”</p>

<p>Dan’s question was interrupted by the sensation of his pants ripping as a huge tail burst through them. Dan looked back in disbelief at the sight of the red furred appendage. It coulden't be what it looked like. For one, his jeans ripped far too easily? Secondly, humans didn't just grow kangaroo tails.</p>

<p>“Oh, in case your wondering, I made it easier for your clothes to rip. Handsome tail by the way, I hope you enjoy it as this is just the start.”</p>

<p>“No, this is … im…possible. It has to be trick or illusion!” Dan cried.</p>

<p>Dan’s entire body began itching and his hips started pushing outwards as they grew.</p>

<p>“Damnit Kat, this isn't funny! How can you do this to me?”</p>

<p>Dan began to scratch under his shirt. Tears formed in his eyes when he felt fur sprouting. He lifted his shirt off to see orange fur was covering his body like a sweater.</p>

<p>“Please, make it stop … make it …arg!” Dan yelled.</p>

<p>He closed his eyes as a terrible pain engulfed his face. His throat seemed to dry out as he felt his jaw pushing outwards. He faded in and out of consciousness, only vaguely aware of how Kat’s magic was reshaping his skull. His memories seemed to stay intact but the change carried a cost. Dan found himself forgetting his skills.</p>

<p><i>No, I remember. Nine times nine is eighty one, twelve times twelve is um, I can't remember. Nine times, um, times, what does that mean? No, I'm becoming a dumb animal.</p>

<p>Please do, I don't want to be dumb! In a right trangle, the longest side's length is equal to the sum of the squares of the other sides. Um, right. Um, no Danm fight it. Please, no!</i></p>

<p>In quick suucession, Dan forgot the formula, then what a formula was, then he couldn't remember what a triangle was. He knew the shape, but the name escaped him. Finally, the concept of a shape confused him. He'd seen those things but couldn't remember what they meant.</p>

<p>When the sensations in his skull abated, Dan opened his eyes. Kat was staring at him. Dan still knew who he and she were. However, he couldn't remember the words. Memories of times they shared together, when they were still happy were fresh in his mind. A tear rolled down a cheek as Dan recalled the times where he and Kat got along great. Now, he was just going to be an ignorant animal while Kat committed any number of atrocities.</p>

<p>Kat made a mirror appear in her hand. Dan couldn't remember the name for it any more. However, he still had just enough of his wits to understand that the reflection in it was his own. His face was a kangaroo face. Gone was his hair and the look of intellect and potential in his eyes. Instead was an curious but ultimately ignorant stare of a kangaroo.</p>

<p>"Almost there Dan, we just need to get rid those silly clothes," Kat said.</p>

<p><i>Dammnit, what are clothes? Why can't I remember?</i></p>

<p>Something seemed to lift Dan off of the ground. He saw the things covering his body turn into dust before disappearing.</p>

<p>His entire body was now covered in fur. Dan watched as his feet began to grow in length but decrease in width. The rest of his body twisted and reshaped. Once again, Dan faded in and out of consciousness. While his skills had largely vanished, Dan was still Dan enough that he knew what was happening to him. He wanted to beg Kat to stop this. Unfortunately, he couldn't think of the words. In the end, all he had left was clicking and grunting to try and show Kat his distress.</p>

<p>When he mind refocused (as much as his new mind set would allow it to anyway) he found himself back on the ground and leaning forward. He looked at the human before him and then down at his body. Things were different, he knew that. He couldn't remember the name of what he'd become but he knew he was no longer the same species as Kat.</p>

<p>"Don't be sad Dan, you're a handsome kangaroo. You'll make an excellent addition to the zoo. I know you won't be able to understand what I'm saying for much longer. I suggest you enjoy your new form. I've made sure you're the only male in their kangaroo enclosure. Now, let's get you out of here before you get any ideas."</p>

<p>Dan looked down at his body and then at Kat one more time. He felt defeated, helpless to do anything. Life would continue on, but not for him, not a life he had in mind anyway. It seemed he had little choice but to face his new reality.</p></p>
