<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">A light flipped on! Mike felt his heart stop as his stomach clenched in fright. He&#39;d been caught!<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, well, well....what do we have here....?&quot;<br />
<br />
Mike quickly put the plant down and stood up to face the music. <br />
<br />
&quot;Sir, I&#39;m sorry. I didn&#39;t mean-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just never you mind,&quot; answered the farmer. <br />
<br />
&quot;No need to try to explain anything. I know perfectly well what&#39;s going on here, and soon, you won&#39;t be able to explain anything at all.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sir, I&#39;m....I&#39;m sorry!&quot; Mike said, taking that as a threat that he might be shot or butchered by this landowner.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shush, boy! &#39;Sorry,&#39; you may be now. Even sorrier you will be soon. But you weren&#39;t sorry when you have been breaking into my green house to steal my product.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But. This is the first time-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;NEVERMIND, I said! It&#39;s too late for you! Thank&#39;s to my old donkey Jeb here, I caught the latest culprit. He shall be rewarded and you shall be punished. He&#39;s learned his lesson by now, I think. And you&#39;ll have yours to learn.&quot;<br />
<br />
This old man was a kook! Mike was about to just brush past that man, when the large obnoxious beast blocked his way with an almost human-like hunger in it&#39;s eyes.<br />
<br />
The man had quickly left the greenhouse, shut, and locked the door. Mike heard it shut, then heard the click that locked him in here with this dirty smelly old beast. Then he heard a hissing and looked up. <br />
<br />
There were these rows of pipes that looked like they were meant to spray water. Which makes sense, as this is a greenhouse with plants that need watering. But instead of water, there appeared to be some sort of gray fog coming out of those pipes....<br />
<br />
Gas! Was he about to be gassed like a Holocaust victim!? He had to get out of there! But everywhere he went, that damned donkey followed! Blocking him every which way....<br />
<br />
But it soon didn&#39;t matter. Mike began to feel relaxed. Giddy, even. He began to laugh at the stupid-looking gray-furred beast in front of him. It was even funnier when it began to bray. Higher and higher, Mike became. He became so high, it felt like his spirit was leaving his body. He could swear he saw a ghostly shape of that donkey leave it&#39;s body as well. <br />
<br />
Suddenly, he felt a force pulling him forward, even as the &quot;donkey ghost&quot; drifted towards him as well. They seemed to pass through eachother. He felt the world spin around, and suddenly he was looking at his own ghostly figure! What a hell of a trip this was!<br />
<br />
He heard the gas turn off over head. He and the ghostly image of his human body just floated there. Looking at eachother. Then he felt a pulling. A pulling back down to earth! With a rush, he felt dizzy and strange. The suddenly, he was no longer &quot;high.&quot; He immediately felt normal. Well, not really &quot;normal.&quot; He felt connected back to the real world mentally, but physically, everything felt all.....wrong.... He couldn&#39;t describe it. It was like he was standing on all fours, but it felt somehow like he had to. His entire body felt....different....was the temperature increased? His head was all-aswirl at this completely different, foreign, physical feeling.<br />
<br />
He heard the door open. It sounded much louder than it should. <br />
<br />
&quot;Haaww!&quot; He brayed out in fright, but thought nothing of the noise he had just made, for that sudden much louder noise of the door opening gave him a startle. He also became distracted when he finally noticed he was looking at....well....himself! Was there a mirror? Mike was so confused.<br />
<br />
His mirror image was moving of it&#39;s own accord. Looking at his hands. Breathing heavily. Mike wasn&#39;t doing any of those things, but was just standing still. On all fours....?<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, &quot;Jeb&quot; was similarly confused, but was much quicker on the uptake. For he knew beforehand what his &quot;reward&quot; was likely to be, for he was himself once a theif breaking and entering on this property. He started by inspecting his new hands. Hands! FINGERS!!! Clothes!! Clean clothes! At least, *clean&quot; relative to that dirty, musty, old gray hide he was forced to live with for.....for ...how long...,? He finally found his new voice...<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my God!&quot; Mike heard his doppelganger say. &quot;Can....can it be...!? I....I....I....can talk! I have hands! I can....stand on two legs!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Indeed you can. MIKE!&quot; said the farmer as he walked in after so loudly opening the door to this facility. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my God! Thank you, thank you, thank you! For finally showing me some mercy!&quot; the new Mike said, trembling in joy and disbelief.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t thank me. Thank HIM!&quot; The farmer pointed at the former Mike. &quot;Jeb over there gave you the opportunity of a life time.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Haaaww....&quot; Wait....<br />
&quot;Haaaww...&quot; &quot;What the fuck&quot;? Thought Mike.<br />
&quot;Heeeee....hhhhaaawww.....&quot;<br />
<br />
Mike&#39;s blood froze cold. The terror of that noise coming from his own mouth was like the sheer terror of a deer frozen in headlights. He slowly craned his long neck downward to look at his arms and hands. The sight that greeted his new large dark eyes, was extremely surreal. Instead of seeing his arms and hands like he expected, he saw the legs and the tops of a solid mass of the hooves...of....a donkey! <br />
<br />
Thos hooves we&#39;re d finitely his now! He could &quot;feel&quot; them as part of his body. They didn&#39;t &quot;feel&quot; like hands, per se. They just felt like toeless feet on the ends of two legs! <br />
<br />
&quot;Heeeee hhhaawww&quot; he said again, unintelligibly. <br />
<br />
Still trying to wrap his brain around his situation, he knew he didn&#39;t want to look. But he had to anyway. He FELT his body was formed or shaped entirely differently. He felt much more husky and clumsy . He craned his neck to the right. And saw....the broad flank of a gray-furred donkey with hind legs! He saw a huge black monster between those hind legs! <br />
<br />
He saw that big black monster begin to grow. He FELT it begin to grow! He FELT it as a part of his body! He couldn&#39;t tear his eyes away from that far too large of a member. He watched in horror as he felt it at the same time, the alien-looking flared end sickly unfurl from the heavy sheath. The smell when it snaked it&#39;s way out! <br />
<br />
He felt the need to piss. He felt the piss begin to make it&#39;s way up his new equine equipment. He felt and watched the hot liquid begin to rocket out of the smelly tip of the penis!<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh god!&quot; He thought. He couldn&#39;t stop it! He wanted to cry as he closed his eyes while he stood there in this body of a donkey, pissing. Next he felt a brand new body part, like and extension of his back. He felt the stomach rumble, as that body part lifted up, exposing his big black donkey anus. He felt the bowel movement, as the donkey shit squeezed it&#39;s way out and plopped on the floor. Several plops. He had just shit out whatever it is this donkey had eaten from before he swapped places with it! <br />
<br />
&quot;Heee hhhaawww!&quot; Mike brayed. The big black penis refusing to retreat back into its hot and humid home. Instead, it grew even larger! With speech, the ability to grimace, and the fingers and hands with which to ball up into fists in growing irritation and horror, the only expression of dealing with a horrific dawning situation, was with the huge dick he had inherited in his body swap with a large jackass:<br />
<br />
He was growing hard and horny! Especially with all the strong, heavy, male jackass hormones hitting his brain at the same time as being terrified. <br />
<br />
&quot;Heh, heh, heh,&quot; said the farmer. &quot;Looks like old Jeb here is &quot;discovering&quot; himself again.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Haaww hheeee hhaaww heee hhaaww!&quot; Mike protested, as he tried to say &quot;I am not Jeb! I&#39;m not a donkey!&quot; &quot;Heee hhaaww heee hhhaawww!!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, son. Have you learned your lesson now?&quot; He asked your doppelganger. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ye...yes!&#39; he said enthusiastically, still examining Mike&#39;s youthful human body in mesmerization. <br />
<br />
&quot;Good! And am I ever going to see you around my farm again?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;No! No sir!&quot; He said again, equally enthusiastically. <br />
<br />
&quot;Good. I&#39;d suggest checking the pants you&#39;re wearing to see if you are carrying your wallet so you can be back on your way HOME!&quot; <br />
<br />
He did so quickly, and produced Mike&#39;s phone, wallet, and keys. <br />
<br />
&quot;And as for you....&quot; the farmer said, turning towards Mike. Now Jeb. &quot;You&#39;re my property, and you will behave yourself. We have a lot of work to do on this farm. The sooner you learn your place, the better it will go for you. It took...MIKE...over there, the better part of 20 years to earn his way back to humanity. He traded places as a similar punishment you have now received, back when Jeb was a 3 year old colt. The....ORIGINAL Jeb, that is.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That would mean you&#39;re a 23 year old jackass,&quot; he continued his lecture to the &quot;new Jeb.&quot; &quot;Donkeys don&#39;t ttypically live much past 30. You&#39;ll probably die of old age as a useless old farm animal in about 10 - 15 years. 17, if you can make it to 40. At that point, your hooves will be melted down into glue and I throw the rest of your carcass into a hole in the ground. But. Eh. I&#39;ll still get a good 10 year&#39;s use out if you.&quot; <br />
<br />
Mike hadn&#39;t yet reached panic-mode, but it was fast-approaching. .He was still too shocked, terrified, and in utter disbelief about his new-found position in life as a species much lower on the food chain. With a body he had taken over that smelled and even FELT filthy! Also, he felt....tired! Not sleepy tired. But muscles achy tired, as if he&#39;d done a bunch of work all day..... Because....well....the body he landed in HAD just done physical labor all day, and the body hadn&#39;t gotten a rest yet. <br />
<br />
Mike&#39;s doppelganger, or rather the being that took over Mike&#39;s youthful human body, was still hanging around. He was still in disbelief over having hands. MIKE&#39;S hands. He also found he wasn&#39;t feeling the constant aches and pains that came with doing daily slave labor all day, every day. He looked up at the former donkey body he had just vacated. &quot;Jeb,&quot; was his name. &quot;Mike&quot; was now his new name! &quot;Gene&quot; was his birth name, when he was born as a human back in 1960. Speaking of years....<br />
<br />
Interlude:<br />
<br />
The farmer had mentioned he: Gene, formerly Jeb, currently now Mike; was stuck as that donkey for the past 20 years! He remembered the day he had swapped with the young 3 year old donkey colt. Could it REALLY have been 20 years!? He had lost 2 entire decades of his life!? But he looked down at the hands he was given once again. They looked and felt youthful. The hands of someone named &quot;Mike.&quot; Maybe he had regained his youth, and now will have an extra 20 years tacked onto his lifespan...?<br />
<br />
Anyway, on that fateful day 20 years ago, Gene remembered that the 3 year old donkey he swapped with had taken over his body. His human body that was already aging. He couldn&#39;t remember what year it was, exactly. And he had no way of knowing what year it was now. He just remembered he was in his late 30s. Perhaps in his 40s at the time. <br />
<br />
For the record, he was a 40 year old man at the time when he had swapped with a 3 year old male donkey colt. He was on the verge of being homeless and desperate to feed his family. So be trespassed on a farm to see if he could steal a few ears of corn and perhaps some soybeans. That&#39;s when he was caught, drugged, and found himself on all fours! <br />
<br />
The donkey that took over his body was of very low intelligence. Compared to a human, anyway. He couldnt even figure out how to properly stand and use the fingers Gene had left him! Gene had no idea what happened to his body after the farmer had ushered him out of the barn. He could only assume he was put into some sort of asylum or something....<br />
<br />
Anyway, Gene was told he would work until the day he paid back his transgression. He was not told HOW he could pay it back. He figured that laboring as a beast of burden would be the only way out. It wasn&#39;t like he could ask any questions. The physical ability to speak was taken from him! Until tonight. When he caught another thief breaking and entering the farm, this time to steal some pot.<br />
<br />
And now here he was. Standing on two legs, marvelling at actually having HANDS! And FINGERS! Gene, or rather Mike now, started becoming giddy with his new-found freedom and joy. He danced around and celebrated as the old farmer and the poor beast that had taken his former position in life stood glaring at him after the farmer finished his speech to the new Jeb. <br />
<br />
Mike stopped hootin&#39; and hollerin&#39; when the farmer scolded him to &quot;knock it off.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, looks like you got your keys, wallet, and phone,&quot; he continued. <br />
<br />
&quot;Phone?&quot; he asked, not knowing what the solid, black, rectangular thing was in his hands. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; sighed the farmer. &quot;That right there is a cell phone.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Heee hhaaww!!&quot; Jeb brayed, trying to say &quot;my phone!&quot; <br />
<br />
A cell phone? Mike rembeted what cell phones were! And he had one! And he....he could use it! He could use use things again! Only trouble was, it didn&#39;t look like a cell phone he was used to dealing with. How did it open? He also figured the person he swapped with must be rich to have a cell phone! <br />
<br />
Mike figured he&#39;d investigate how to work this newfangled device later on. He also had a wallet. He investigated the wallet, and took out two IDs. One was a fancy-lookimg driver&#39;s license that looked nothing like what he remembered they looked like. And the other was an ID from the local high school. They both contained the photo of a really nice-looking boy, with a birthdate of....2006! 7/06! Michael Galeota, was the name.  &quot;Good looking boy&quot; was another issue. He had come to recognize individua people by how they smelled and their body language. Not how they looked. But now he could focus on the face....<br />
<br />
Seven, 2006? It&#39;s been a really long time since &quot;Mike&quot; had thought of the names and the order of months. He had fingers now, and could use them to count! <br />
<br />
Mike was beginning to remember the millennium. It was a few months after the turn of the year 2000, and there was a bit of hysteria over some sort of computer bug....<br />
<br />
&quot;Mike! Are you going to go &#39;home&#39; or not!?&quot; asked the old man, pulling him out of his meandering thoughts and emotions. <br />
<br />
&quot;Uh. Home?&quot; He asked. <br />
<br />
The old man took the wallet from him. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes. Home!&quot; He looked at it, and showed him the address on the license of where Mike lived. &quot;You also have a car parked on the side of the road around back. You can use those keyes to drive out of here! You&#39;re a free man, and I suggest you go before I change my mind!<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Jeb was beginning to get anxious. The initial shock was starting to wear off as the gravity of his situation was sinking in more and more, and he didn&#39;t know how to deal with a large male beast&#39;s growing sexual tension. <br />
<br />
&quot;A fucking donkey!&quot; He thought. &quot;I can&#39;t be a fucking DONKEY!&quot; But he was! He continued checking out his inherited beastly body, just as Mike was discovering himself. He couldn&#39;t believe the humongous male package he was forced to sport now! The thought of it was making him harder and harder. The thought of being trapped as a donkey and that donkey taking over his life!  He didn&#39;t have hands or fingers he could flex. Nor many fine facial muscles to grimace. So all of his efforts at expressing himself involuntarily went right to the two most flexible parts of his new body:<br />
<br />
His tail whipping around in agitation, and the big black penis extending further and further out! Becoming more and more of a solid black pole beginning to tremble. <br />
<br />
&quot;Heee hhhaawww,&quot; Jeb began a series of brays that would work it&#39;s way up to a crescendo of panic. <br />
<br />
&quot;Heeee hhhaawww!&quot; He brayed, as he stomped a hoof in irritation at not having hands or words.....not being ae to ignore his first equine erection. <br />
<br />
As the exchange between the farmer and Mike began to wind down, Mike looked up at the donkey, the body he had suffered with for the past twenty years. It made him shudder. He thought about the boy in the photo of the ID he was holding. That boy was now in the very same position he himself had been for the past twenty years! That boy was beginning to panic....<br />
<br />
&quot;Heee hhaaww....heeee hhaaww...heee hhhaawww....HEEEEE HHAAAWW....HEEEE HHAAWW....HEEEE HHHAAWWW HEEEE HHHAAWW HHEEEEE HAAWW HEEEEHHAAWWHEEEHHAAWWHEEEHAAWWHEEEHAAWWHEEEHHAAAWWW!<br />
<br />
Mike began to feel really bad!.That kid couldn&#39;t be older than 16. He still had a full life ahead of him..... But then again, he had enough disposable income to have his own cell phone, and still decide to steal from a local farmer. At least when he was Gene, he was stealing as the very last resort. This boy was stealing pot, and he had money. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, it serves him right!&quot; he thought.<br />
<br />
With one last look at the crook before him who was just beginning his long journey of a prison sentence, Mike scoffed at the dumb lowly beast. It smelled, and it was making a hell of a racket. It also has a long day&#39;s work ahead of it tomorrow. Meanwhile, he, Mike, had a brand new life ahead of him. No longer would he be stuck on all fours. He could now stand and walk upright with dignity. <br />
<br />
As he was leaving, Jeb was continuing to panic more and more. The farmer decided it was a good time to beat it out of there himself and close and lock the door. Jeb was, afterall, a large farm animal of over 700 lbs. He&#39;d eventually calm downz but ATM, he was dangerous <br />
<br />
Jeb heard the door close and lock! He tried calling after that farmer and his stolen human body to not leave him in there once he discovered he was all alone. But no word could he let out. His calls to not be left alone like this just blended in perfectly well with his already-panicky brays. The constant brays instead of words, only caused him to continue to bray and jump around and kick about.<br />
<br />
&quot;HEEE HHAAWW HEEE HHAAWW HEEE HHAAWW HEEE HHAAWW HEEE HHAAWW HEEE HHAAWWW!!&quot; <br />
<br />
This went on for quite a while, despite the fact that the body he now wore was already worn out from that day&#39;s work. But eventually, he did begin to slow down. Finally becoming somewhat peaceful while trying to catch his breath. He was just standing there, wheezing in and out for maybe ten minutes.  Sort of in a mindless stupor until he began to collect his thoughts again. <br />
<br />
He looked back at himself. The body that was now his, that was sort of hanging out back there on all fours. A body he could physically feel was definitely now him! <br />
<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t believe I switched bodies with a fucking DONKEY!&quot; he thought. He started growing hard again at that thought, as he simultaneously &quot;sighed&quot; with a hawww.<br />
<br />
&quot;Man, this sucks!&quot; His thoughts continued as he looked down at his front legs. &quot;Hooves!&quot; he thought, as he lifted his front right hoof to look at it. To inspect it. &quot;what the fuck am I supposed to do with these!?&quot; He experimentally clopped it on the ground. It really did feel entirely differently. Not nearly as sensitive as hands and fingers. Not at all like he had his hands balled up into fists. More like feet without toes, as he noted earlier. <br />
<br />
In any case,  there was nothing that he could do with his inherited hooves! Too stiff and blocky to manipulate anything. Too large to wedge into spaces. Hooves are meant to be walked upon. That&#39;s it. Even front hooves are less useful than human feet for anything other than walking!<br />
<br />
&quot;Hee hhaaww!&quot; He brayed out in unspoken donkey brays, still unable to speak!</p>
