<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Rick! The camera! Do you know where it is?&quot; Emily snapped her head around the room hopeing it wouldn&#39;t have gotten far. The sudden movement caused her excess weight to wobble and sent her tumbling to the floor.<br />
<br />
&quot;Emily are you alright?&quot; Asked Rick &quot;that looked like a doozy!&quot;<br />
<br />
Emily pushed herself off the smooth , slightly cold synthetic floor. &quot;Yeah, I&#39;m alright. Just alot of new weigh... Wait? How did you know I fell?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can see you somehow. Actually.&quot; Rick replied before pausing for a moment. &quot;Yeah, I think there are cameras all over the ship... Uh, I mean myself? Ugh! This is so weird...&quot;<br />
<br />
Emily sat up on the floor looking around the alien (no pun intended) space. The walls were an eggshell white, with feint swirling groves that twisted across the walls and floor in perfect geometric designs. The groves gave off a faint blue glow that seemed to somehow illuminate the whole room as no other light sources were visible. Emily turned to the window again seeing the endless expanse of space littered with stars. Just above the window however was a small block about two square inches in size.<br />
<br />
She staired intently at it for a moment before Rick broke the silence. &quot;Yeah Em, that&#39;s me I think!&quot; Emily stepped back in slight surprise. &quot;I mean, whatever your looking at is what I&#39;m seeing you through.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh, you said there were cameras, as in plural right?&quot; She asked, crossing her arms beneath her breats and propping them up as she stroked her chin thinking.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah! Infact there&#39;s another one behind you. you know your as got huge? In a good way I mean.&quot;  Rick stuttered with his recovery.<br />
<br />
Emily turned around an sure enough on the opposite side was another cube set into the wall.<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh?&quot; She huffed looking around the otherwise empty room. &quot;Can you use multiple cameras at once? Or...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Let me try...&quot; Rick trailed off in his soft feminin voice. After a moment Rick came back. Uh, yeah though its not a great feeling.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok, ok.&quot; Emily murmured.&quot;Rick can you look, uh, inside yourself with you&#39;re cameras and try to find the actual camera so we can try n fix this crazy&#39;ness?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ill try Em, hold on a sec.&quot; Replied Rick before cutting off in silence.<br />
<br />
There was a faint hum present in the room while Emily waited to hear from Rick.<br />
<br />
A minute passed before the female voice broke in again.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think I found something!&quot; Rick blertted into the room.<br />
<br />
&quot;The camera?&quot; Asked Emily with with nervous excitement. <br />
<br />
&quot;Not exsactly. Uhh, ok let me try... Ah! Did that do something?&quot; As Rick yelled &#39;ah!&#39; A triangular door opened in the wall.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, a door opened up! Great job Rick!&quot; Emily took an excited step forward only to stumble remembering first that she was in high heels and second her new assests threw off her balance. She then took slower steps to get acclimated to her new body.<br />
<br />
Outside the room was a longer room, which was likely a hallway. The door behind her closed silently and just before here another small camera block popped out of the wall.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok there you are.&quot; Said Rick from somewhere in the hall. &quot;Sorry Em I&#39;m trying to figure out how my &#39;view&#39; works, it hurts my head to try n see multiple views so I have to cycle through them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Take your time Rick, and try not to think about a self destruct or anything, don&#39;t need that going off.&quot; She joked at him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh crap, I hadn&#39;t even thought of that. Damn, now I can&#39;t stop thinking about it.&quot; Rick rambled on in panic. &quot;Ok, doors, doors&quot;<br />
<br />
There was a pause before Rick came back. Ok, to your right down the hall is a open door, its in there.&quot;<br />
<br />
Emily strutted down the hall, passing smooth walls and wondering how many doors might be hiding in them. Over all the whole alien thing was kind of growing on here, once she had the camera she might ask Rick explore him a little more, after all he was an alien ship! When else would they get a chance like this?<br />
<br />
After a few minutes of walking Emily found the open door.<br />
<br />
Inside there was a large oval window that looked out into space, this was of course the most interesting thing in the room at first glance, because in view of the windo was the blue and green marble that Emily knew to be earth!<br />
<br />
She went running awkwardly in here heels up to the window, pressing her body and face against the transparent surface.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank god! I didn&#39;t even think about where in space we might be!&quot; Emily exclaimed!<br />
<br />
&quot;That is a relief but its not the thing that I found, look behind you.&quot; Rick announced.<br />
<br />
Behind her, and stationed in the center of the room was a kind if podium or dais. It was crescent shaped with two floating cubes made up of smaller cubes not unlike a rubix cube without the colored stickers. Close by was a chair. If Emily had to guess this was the control  room or some kind of cockpit. <br />
<br />
She took up position Isis&#39;s the arc of the crescent shaped control panel , instinctively putting her hand overtop the floating cubes. Instantly they began to spin and rotate, the different layers of blocks spinning and interchanging and a screen appeared before her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ohh, that feels kinda nice.&quot; Cooed Rick from inside the room. &quot;Ok, don&#39;t do anything this is the thing I found...&quot;<br />
<br />
On the screen different views of the ship appeared, most were all shots of rooms like she&#39;d started in but the flowing geometry set each one apart. The cycling stoped when she saw herself, or the back of herself in the control room.<br />
<br />
Then a overlay appeared on the screen with a blue outline overtaking her body, clearly some kind is selection filter. Then a number of other filters popped up just outside the main shot of the camera. Each one of those options she recognized from the strange cameras different settings options.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, dose that mean...&quot; Emily trailed off. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah.&quot; continued Rick, &quot;I think the camera fused with my, I mean the ships camra system. But look in the center there, the red button. I can&#39;t do anything with it. I tried to take a picture of you ealier and it didn&#39;t do anything&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You what!&quot; Emily shouted &quot;without asking me first?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry Em, I was just trying to figure myself out, being a space ship is confusing, changing the cameras is like blinking and seeing with new eyes. Opening the doors is like breathing with different sets of lungs...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Right.&quot; Emily sighed with shame. &quot;Sorry Rick, you really got the short end of the stick on this one huh?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s not all bad, its just very disorienting, I&#39;m actually really interested in how it works, just be patient with me. Anyway I&#39;d have set the option so you&#39;d have been aware, but I think you need to be the one that &#39;authorizes&#39; the picture. I think your MY pilot, or captain or somthing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Suppose that makes scene...&quot;<br />
Emily sighed. &quot;Ok, lets test it then. Set it to aware and blend in with environment.&quot; <br />
<br />
On the screen the options rolled by into the correct positions which Emily herself selected in and outline, once the  settings were locked the dull colored red button on the screen became bright red and Emily tapped it.<br />
<br />
 A bright flash filled the room and as Emily&#39;s sight returned she knew something had changed, because where her hand was in the screen was now very different.<br />
<br />
Her hand now had only two long fingers and a thumb each knuckle five inches long, her skin had fine from green to lavender purple and she had no fingernails.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, Rick, can you get me<br />
A mirror in here.&quot; She said aloud, her voice having a buzzing feel to it, like speaking into a fan.<br />
<br />
&quot;Actually I think I can&quot; Rick replied as in front  if the control panel 4 large mirrors rose silently from the floor.<br />
<br />
Emily walked around on her heels to the mirror and took in the sight of her body. First her feet weren&#39;t in heels she was walking on a pair of hoves not unlike a cow&#39;s with its big 2 toes, but each toe was as big as an elephant&#39;s toe. Her knees had an extra joint like an exaggerated dog leg. Her hips and as were just as wide as her last body and her jumpsuit was now orange and the legs of the suit started half way at her shaply thighs. At her stomach two small arms  curled up at her abdomin, they features human like hands but reminded Emily of the small arms if a T-Rex but on a human proportion. Her regular arms were the same size as last time, though longer because of the odd hands. Her chest however now sported 3 H-cup breasts! Somehow the suit managed to keep them contained despite the collor revealing the two deep valleys of cleavage they created. Her neck was a foot longer, and very slim. Her head resembled her previously beautiful alien face with a few additions. First and for most she had a 3rd still yellow eye set vertically into her forehead, a second set of antenna longer then the first set further up her head and deep purple freckles that gave her a &#39;country-girl&#39; look sprinkled her cheeks and human nose. Lastly her hair had become a gray white. If not for its platinum like shine Emily thought it might make her look old, but its brilliant gleam came off more like strands of spun sugar and silver.<br />
<br />
&quot;The three boobs are a bit different, but overall not a bad look&quot; she said examining herself in the mirror.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm, you know...&quot; Rick butted in. &quot;It seems like as long as were on an alien ship, anything we capture with the camera on the blend in setting will turn into some kind of alien.?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Did you say &#39;capture&#39;?&quot; Asked Emily, turning her head toward the nearist camera cube she knew Rick was using.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, yeah... Wait! Your not thinking?...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well we are in an alien shut, and I am an &#39;alien&#39; now for all intents and purposes...&quot; Emily went back to the controls and put her hands over the cubes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your really suggesting we go and abduct some &#39;humans&#39; to &#39;experiment&#39; on with the camera!&quot; Rick stammered out emphasizing the words loud and clear.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh come on, that sounds like the best idea ever right now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t even know how to fly myself Em! N you wana swoop up strangers and experiment on them?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yup!&quot; Was her simple response.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, that dose sound like some really good fun...&quot; Rick folded after a few moments of thought.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes! Close encounters if the 4th kind! Here we come!&quot; Cheered Emily.<br />
<br />
The ship didn&#39;t more at all, not even a whirling up engin sound.<br />
<br />
&quot;I said I don&#39;t know how to fly myself Em. This may take a bit.&quot; Rick announced, totally killing the mood.</p>
