<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ryan had so many questions and so few answers.  The only real solid thing he had to go on was that he, or rather his body was at Memorial Hospital.  Ryan put got dressed, trying to piece together what had happened to him, his erection slowly fading.  He heard a car start in the driveway, backup, and pull away.  The sounds registered but he didn’t quite realize what they signified.  He was alone in the house with Mike.  Ryan moved towards the door and stepped out of the office and back into the kitchen common area.  Mike saw him and responded before Ryan was even close to becoming in his surroundings.  “Dude!” Mike exclaimed, “What the fuck!” In his confused stupor, Ryan had only put Aaron’s shirt and socks on. <br />
<br />
To Mike, the look on his younger brothers face was one of confusion and fear, little did he know the actually owner of those emotions was a man far older and far more confused and scared.  Mike’s disgust and anger softened, he became worried for the young boy he had watched grow up.  “Uhh come on dude” Aaron spoke again, “ lets get you cleaned up.”  Mike got up from his stool at the kitchen counter and moved towards Ryan, once again placing his hand on the boys shoulder this time to direct him upstairs.  <br />
<br />
Mike steered Ryan in Aaron’s body to Aaron’s room.  At least where Ryan would sleep was answered, even if so many larger questions remained at a mystery.  Ryan stood in the room still desperately trying to work out a plan to solve a problem he didn’t understand.  Could he return to his own body? Where was Aaron’s soul/consciousness?  What did the old clerk mean by, well, any of what he said?  <br />
<br />
Mike stared at his little brother for a while, trying to determine what he should do next?  Aaron didn’t seem to be in any pain? But he also didn’t seem to recognize his own room.   Mike chalked it up to shock.  That must be why Aaron had run off.  Who knows why he’d finally stopped at that liquor store, it’s a good thing the police officer was there to bring him back.  Mike wondered for a second if Aaron would ever get his wits back, before pushing the thought from his mind.  Of course he would, it as just shock, he’d read about it in his college psychology and history books. Men who went through traumatic events just needed time to make sense of it all.  Aaron wasn’t even a man, he was a boy, and his threshold for the traumatic was much lower.  Mike decided the noble and brotherly thing to do would be to take care of Aaron until he snapped out of this funk.  <br />
<br />
Mike went to Aaron’s dresser and pulled out a fresh t-shirt (from some math decathlon, ‘what a nerd’ he thought) and a pair of gym shorts that had only ever been worn around the house playing video games.  Mike walked Aaron across the hall to the bathroom that they had both shared previous to Mike going off to the community college in town.  Mike started the water in the shower, waited until it got warm and turned to Ryan.  “A, A, Shower will help you clear your head” he stammered a little, trying to project an air of confidence and authority.  Aaron just stood there, in his shirt and socks looking at the wall, in a deep stupor.  Mike was going to have to take a more hands on approach.  He placed his hand on Aaron’s shoulder, “Aaron?” Mike asked in a level and calm voice, “I’m going to help you, is that alright?” This brought Ryan out of his thought a little, “yes, yes, you can help me?” he asked hopefully.  Rather than reassure Mike this made him more worried.  He started to take his brothers shirt off, Aaron raised his hands when prompted.  Next Mike kneeled down and took the boys socks off, trying not to make eye contact with his brother’s penis.  Mike sighed as he stood up, considering his options and trying to rule out what he knew he had to do next.  Mike began to strip down.<br />
<br />
This grabbed Aaron’s attention.  He remained very still as the teen boy stripped down butt naked.  Ryan had never taught Mike while he was at the middle school, but the 18 year old man who stood before him was a sight to behold.  Mike stood a whole head taller than Aaron.  He was much better defined, clearly he worked out.  Nice biceps lead up the arms to powerful pecks, down to abs and a short but thick penis.  Mike put his hand on Aaron’s shoulder yet again and steered him into the small walk-in shower.  <br />
<br />
The warm water washed over Aaron’s back first, as he worked to maintain his position facing Mike.  Aaron’s little dick was at full mast again, though you might not know it.  Mike grabbed a washcloth, put some gel soap on it and started to scrub Aaron down.  Neck, shoulders, chest, the kid would not turn around so Mike reached over his brothers shoulders to get his back before moving lower.  Mike couldn’t help but notice what a little butterball his brother was, he tried to keep it from his mind as he washed Aaron’s pudgy stomach.  Mike paused for a moment, at the area between Aaron’s belly button and his penis, he was helping his brother he reminded himself, this was for his family, and he continued.  Mike tried to ignore Aaron’s erection as he scrubbed all angles the boys under carriage.  <br />
<br />
Mike shut off the shower, and dried his still aroused little brother off before drying himself off.  He put the clothes on Aaron he’d selected earlier and directed Aaron back into his room.  Mike had Ryan lay down on the bed, and tucked him in, despite being only 5 pm.  Sleep would help this out, he thought, before leaving the room with the light on.  <br />
<br />
Ryan was beginning to think that living life as Aaron wasn’t so bad. Both Aaron’s father and brother had just fondled him.  Ryan knew enough about Aaron to fake his way for a while but he’d really have to dig deeper into Aaron’s life if he was going to fit in.  Ryan got out of bed and sat at an open desktop at Aaron’s desk.  The computer didn’t have a password, so Ryan was able to get right in.  Ryan began searching through the different folders, web browser history, and photos to see what he could glean about his new host. Ryan knew he had to come up with a plan, and fast.</p>
