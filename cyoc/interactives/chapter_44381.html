<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I was hardly aroused up until the point where the pill ran though Drew. Making him less of a raving raging hormone crazed beast and more of a controlled man that he normally was. Soon I began to feel something strange. He was hitting my prostate more often, not every thrust he made, but often enough to invoke a sexual reaction. His large rough hands caressing my otherwise smooth abs other than a thick treasure trail. Through this transformation into a much more tender sex, I was able to enjoy it some. I was still in incredible pain, but at least now there was that pleasure involved. I had the vague memory of hearing that most men never feel one of their most powerful sex organs touched, the prostate. I gasped and moaned as Drew’s hand slid up my shirt, just under my chest, pulling my back up against the bars. &quot;You like this, Boy?&quot; Drew said through clenched teeth into my ear. It became obvious to me that he had most likely fantasized about this before. Despite not enjoying this position or being called boy, I knew it was in my best interests to say, &quot;Y-yes, sir...&quot; before clinching my teeth together once more. <br />
<br />
	His thrusting would soon become longer and slower, he lowered his hand back onto my stomach. Then my bush. Drew’s breathing was ragged as he wrapped his hand around my shaft, much to my surprise. In all of his sexual relations, he was the top, being as large as he was, he was just best suited to play the dominate top guy. But when not under the influence of that little blue pill, he was considerate of his partners’ pleasure as well. <br />
<br />
	As soon as his hand grabbed onto my cock, it quickly began swelling to it's full girth. Despite the pain, I thought that I might really enjoy this now. I easily filled your large hand, Drew was impressed by my thickness size actually. He stopped, leaving his shaft in my ass, his pecker kissing my prostate as he noticed I were slowly thrusting into his hand on my own. Drew didn’t think I realized it at first and, in a sexual way, he thought it was cute. He didn’t say anything as my thrusting was helping him get closer to the point of pleasure, too. My eyes were still shut, but no longer forced shut in agony. This time he heard me moan, enjoying this. Though my body was working on getting myself off, it was getting him off just as much as my ass rubbed against Drew’s dick as my dick rubbed against his hand.<br />
<br />
	Drew clenched my swollen member tight with his fist. He liked how I were taking what I wanted from him even though the agreement was that he get off, and I get a clean record. Not that both of us get off. He began to thrust on his own again, harder than when he first calmed down from the drug, but not as painful as before. He started to move faster and his focus was now back to his dick, his hand slowly moved off my shaft and onto my hips. His arms couldn’t quite fit through the bars past his forearms, so Drew had to make do with his limited mobility. His grunts was a tell-tell that he was getting close. Drew pulled up the back of my shirt and a 'plop,' his cock  came out of my hole. Confused, but still with his hand still on my waist holding me in place, he pressed his cock against my lower back, rubbing it slowly. And then I felt… A few drops of cum on my back. Anticlimactic ... but before I thought to move away, Drew fire hosed all over my lower back, coating it in a film of thick cum in 4 equally large loads. I opened my eyes wide when I felt the cum soaking my ass and lower back. I was glad my shirt and hoodie that had been pushed up by Drew when he first roughly grabbed me and began fucking. <br />
<br />
	Feeling that he was done with me, I squatted down, too far in to just stop masturbating and kept jerking myself. Drew noticed that I had continued, which led him to believe that I wasn’t just some punk getting ass raped by a cop. That I actually enjoyed some of it. &quot;Turn around Marcus.&quot; He ordered. My back and neck stiffen as I let go of myself and stand up. Turning around to face him, I held my shirt and hooding up a bit at my back, away from getting soaked by his cum. I could feel his cum run down the back of my legs. &quot;Wow,&quot; Drew grinned, &quot;That’s a big dick,&quot; Not as long as his, but mine was pretty damn close. I had some girth on me, which was more than his own. He reached out for it and yanked me forward. Drew pulled off my hoodie and shirt. While he admired my young, fit body, he began to kneel down, his cock semi hard, actually touching the ground in this position. <br />
<br />
	I definitely had not expected Drew to get down on a knee like that. I figured that he might have told me to stop jerking or make me jerk off in front of him for his pleasure, but it seemed to me now that Drew was thinking about actually involving himself. I was stunned, and I was hard. I held onto the bars as he almost seemed to worship my thick shaft and heavily hanging balls which they were bigger than his own. He rubbed my shaft against his stubbly cheek, he hadn’t had the chance to shave his 5 o' clock away. He had no idea that this was my first sexual experience... <br />
<br />
	I shivered, but not from being cold as the stubble rubbed against my cock. This was not like anything I had ever fantasized about, and I had the feeling that Drew would become the object of my fantasies for quite some time. He grinned up at me, then it struck him. 'This is probably never going to happen again,' he thought. Being in the small town that we were in, it was hard enough to find a decent guy to fool around with let alone a hot scared one like myself. And one that would help him play out fantasies? He thought not. But a promise was a promise. He was going to clean my records... Since I did take it like a man... now I just had to give it like one. I managed a small smile of my own as I looked down at Drew, watching him in surprise. I didn't know what to think, other than that I was starting to really feel good. At this point I didn't want his 'rape' to end. <br />
<br />
	Holding my cock firm against his stubble-covered chin, &quot;So punk!&quot; his voice took on a different tone, not so much that of a cop. &quot;What should I do about this?&quot; he had slipped into a pleasurable tone, where he started using words like 'I' and 'For you' rather than the horny cop tone, where it was all about him.</p>
