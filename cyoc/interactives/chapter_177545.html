<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mason was a 43-year-old father of one, a son named Ian who was home for the summer from his first year at college. Mason had been eager to have his son back home; it had been a long first year, and with their mother no longer with them, he had felt powerfully lonely on the nights between phone calls and video chat sessions. However, lately his son had been very laconic, and he couldn’t really blame him. Most of his friends had left town for college and made lives there, and the rest had drifted away. Ian was only 19, too young to drink, and a little too awkward to try meeting people any other way, bless him. As an independent contractor, Mason didn’t have much in the way of ‘work buddies’ to spend time with either, so he supposed his son wasn’t the only one being anti-social. Sometimes he felt a distance between him and Ian, as if college and growing up were pulling them apart. He wanted to spend more time with him, to try and develop something they did together, but they didn’t have much in common as far as interests.<br />
<br />
When Mason received a free sample in the mail from Transversion labs, he thought it was a joke. A DILF pill? He shook his head; he’d always hated the phrase ‘DILF’, and the ‘dad bod’ rage that Ian had teased him with when he was in high school. It probably tickled him the wrong way because a part of him knew that he definitely fell into that category, he reflected with chagrin. He was a tall man, and the nature of his work kept his body relatively fit and strong. Sure, his hairy pectorals sagged a little bit, and the hard muscles of his abdomen were hidden under layer of protective fat and hair now. As a young man he’d struggled to grow facial hair; now in his forties, he had to shave every day. Or at least he used to; now his beard was thick and coarse upon his angular cheeks, his strong chin. He knew he was a good looking older man, even if lately it had felt like no one else did. In the rare occasions he did find the time and energy to date, he usually struck out. <br />
<br />
But as Mason read the instructions of the pill, an idea came to him despite the absurdity of its purported effects. Could it really transform someone into a hairy, older, and sexier version of their male selves? Mason didn’t know what would happen if he took it; he’d just discovered the pelt of hair slowly coming in on his back, he felt like he was experiencing enough virility in his own life. Ian, however, Mason smiled in spite of himself as he thought of his son becoming a handsome, older man like him. In fact, his heart leaped; they could go to bars and have a beer, hit a casino, maybe even wingman for each other and get themselves some action for once. <br />
<br />
His ears clearly ringing, Ian had just come out of his room and padded into the kitchen where Mason was sitting at the table.<br />
<br />
“Sup, Dad. What’cha got there?” he asked, grabbing a bag of chips out of the pantry.<br />
<br />
“I’m honestly not sure. It’s a free sample I got in the mail,” Mason replied, holding out the little box to him.<br />
<br />
Ian took the box and read the label on the back, one eyebrow slowly arching. “Is this a joke? This looks pretty lame, Dad.” He snickered, looking at him from over the box. “Guaranteed to bring out the hirsute older gentleman in you!” he quoted with a laugh.<br />
<br />
“I know,” Mason chuckled. “I thought it was corny too.”<br />
<br />
“Were you gonna try it?”<br />
<br />
“No, of course not! I’m already…”<br />
<br />
“Old and hairy?” Ian cut him off, smirking.<br />
<br />
“And that’s how he got grounded,” he said with a mock-stare of fatherly sternness. “Maybe I’ll let you out when YOU get some hair on your chest, little boy.” He quipped at his son.<br />
<br />
“According to this, I’ll only be grounded for two minutes then.” Ian said, crossing over to the cabinet and pulling out a glass. <br />
<br />
“Wait,” his father stood up from the table. “Are you gonna take it? We don’t even know what it does!” he cautioned as Ian opened the container and tapped out a big white pill. <br />
<br />
He filled the glass with water and said, “Meh, wouldn’t be the first time.” He said, before popping it into his mouth and taking a deep gulp of water.<br />
<br />
“Ian!” his father shouted, but it was too late. He stared at Ian with apprehension as his son set the empty glass of water on the counter top. Ian coughed and cleared his throat.<br />
<br />
“Damn, why do they make that pill so big…” he said, rubbing his throat. They both jumped and looked at each other at the sound of Ian’s deeper baritone voice.<br />
<br />
“How you feeling, buddy?” said Mason, a smile tugging at his mouth.<br />
<br />
“Um, okay, I guess…I…” but then he groaned and doubled over as if he had a cramp. Mason rushed over and helped him to the couch, his eyes widening in shock when he felt the muscles under Ian’s shirt moving and twisting. He set the young man down pulled back as his son started to moan and jerk in pleasure.<br />
<br />
Ian’s bones began to elongate as the muscles across his body swelled and hardened. His pectorals became hard and meaty, sagging over a rapidly growing and round beer-belly. His shoulders rounded out as his biceps and his forearms slowly bulged bigger and bigger with muscle. There was a tearing sound as Ian’s white shirt began to split with the expanding girth of his torso, and Mason watched in awe as coarse, brown hairs trickled in across his body, becoming especially dense on his legs and veiny forearms. He blushed and tried to look away when the seat of his son’s pants also began to swell with a growing bulge that quickly became a growing erection; the growing man reached a large, hairy paw down to stroke the new length. The brown hair on his head and of his beard became thick and peppered with white and grey hairs, and then as quickly as it had begun the transformation stopped. <br />
<br />
Mason looked down at the sweating, groaning, hirsute man laying upon his couch, inn awe that this was his son. He looked like any of the big-bellied, roughnecked construction workers he ran into at the yard or the hardware store. The man took a deep breath and sat up, his bulky frame looking comical in the torn and straining clothes of a 19-year-old college student. He wiped his face and pulled his hands back in shock when they made first contact with his soft, luxurious beard. He looked over his arms and his body and gasped.<br />
<br />
“Holy shit!” he shouted in a deep, rich baritone. “It worked! Damn, look how hairy my arms are!” the man stood up and admired himself, twisting around as he examined his round, soft ass, and his wide, hairy back.<br />
<br />
“Damn, son; I think you might be taller than me!” he chortled nervously, stepping closer and sizing the new man up. He was glad to see that at least Ian’s same old hazel eyes were staring back down at him.<br />
<br />
“Oh, I’m definitely taller than you, old man!” Ian said with a confidant smirk, straightening his back and flexing his big arms. <br />
<br />
“Who you calling old?” Mason reached up to tousle his son’s thick, graying hair. The action felt out of place performed on this beefy man. “And you better start putting down the fork and putting on the weights!” he laughed, patting his sons hairy, flabby belly.<br />
<br />
“Oomph, yeah. That’s heavy, but it also makes me feel…good?” he wondered, his big brow furrowing. “It just makes me feel manly and confident.” He admitted with a boyish smirk of embarrassment on his bearded face.<br />
<br />
“That’s how it feels to be a grown man, son.” Mason replied, lightly slapping his own belly. <br />
<br />
Ian then got a weird look on his face and then looked down at the still present bulge in his now tight shorts. He grinned sheepishly, saying, “Sorry, dad, but I gotta take a peek,” before undoing the strained waist of his shorts and sliding them down. Mason turned away in embarrassment when he saw the thick, pink head of his son’s new cock peaking out from the leg of his boxers. His suspicions were confirmed when Ian laughed and said, “Oh my god, its fucking huge!” he exclaimed.<br />
<br />
Mason chuckled; he was well-endowed himself and he had always wondered if his son had inherited his big gift. “I take it you’ve made some other improvements?” he suggested, still with his back turned. <br />
<br />
“I mean, I wasn’t complaining before, but damn.” He said with satisfaction, adjusting himself as Mason turned back around. Ian looked at the torn shirt clinging to his bulky torso and the tight shorts laying on the ground. “Shit, man, I don’t think my clothes are gonna fit.” <br />
<br />
“C’mon, son,” said Mason, hesitating to use the word on a man who was clearly ten years older than himself now. “Maybe I got something you can wear.”<br />
<br />
Ian followed his father to his bedroom, stumbling slightly as he became accustomed to his new height and his big feet. They went into the closet and sorted through Mason’s clothes; his boxers would fit Ian, but all the shirts were too tight around his big, rotund belly. Ian chuckled when his father handed him one of his baggier Tony Bahama shirts and a pair of oversized jeans he’d purchased on accident once.<br />
<br />
“Really?” Ian chuckled, “You’re gonna make me be the big-bellied Hawaiian shirt guy?” he asked, shrugging into the shirt. <br />
<br />
“Hey, man. If it fits.” Mason retorted, but then his eyes widened in shock as Ian casually stripped of his boxers, letting a fat, soft cock and hairy pair of heft nuts hang out for all the world to see, his shirt still unbuttoned.<br />
<br />
“Ian, c’mon, man!” he complained, turning his head and raising his hand.<br />
<br />
“What? We’re both men here. We’ve both been in a locker room, man.” He said before stepping into the much looser pair of boxers and pulling on the jeans. They were a little too tight under his big belly, but if he didn’t wear a belt, they would be fine. <br />
<br />
“You don’t think it’s weird to show of your new…manhood, in front of your father?” Mason asked incredulously.<br />
<br />
Ian looked up and thought about it as he buttoned his shirt, unconsciously leaving the top few undone to show off his hairy chest. “I dunno, man. It’s like, I know you’re my father but right now I feel for you like my friend.” He explained. “Probably my best friend.” He admitted. “I still love you, but now it feels platonic rather than familial.” He finished, inwardly musing at his improved articulation. <br />
<br />
“So, do you feel like the same person?” asked Mason, uncertainty in his voice.<br />
<br />
Ian dug around through the closet for a pair of socks. “Yes and no. There’s definitely someone else in here, and he wants a beer. You wanna head over to the bar?” he asked<br />
<br />
“Well, sure, but you can’t…” he stopped when he saw Ian giving him a devilish and excited smile. “Oh right. With a body like that, they’re definitely not gonna card you.” He admitted.<br />
<br />
“Hell no!” Ian guffawed, “Look at these 280 pounds of man meat?” he laughed, gesturing over his immense frame. “Hey, side note, you got any shoes that fit?”<br />
<br />
Mason got changed himself and came out into the living room to find Ian standing in the kitchen, holding a bottle of whiskey over a glass.<br />
<br />
“What the fuck do you think your doing?” Mason shouted in his booming dad voice. Some part of the original, 19-year old Ian clearly was still there, because the big man jumped and shrank back for a moment by instinct.<br />
<br />
“Just, pregaming a little, before we go out. Buddy.” He said, sheepishly.<br />
<br />
“Not without pouring one for your old man, you’re not.” Mason said, pulling out a glass of his own and putting it down next to Ian’s.<br />
<br />
The big man broke into a nervous smile and shook his head. “Damn, Dad. You scared the shit out of me.” He chortled, his hand deftly pouring just the right amount for a perfect shot of neat whiskey.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, you may be older and grayer than me, now. But I still got it.” Mason gloated, taking up the glass.<br />
<br />
“I gotta try that sometime,” Ian growled. They clinked their glasses together and took the shots. Ian groaned in satisfaction as the liquor ran down his throat. He’d hated any kind of whiskey before the change, but now it tasted delicious. And it didn’t even put a dent in his sobriety. <br />
<br />
“C’mon, let hit the bar,” rumbled Ian, eager to change that fact. <br />
<br />
“Let’s do it, buddy.” Mason agreed, grabbing his keys and following his ‘son’ to the door. “Hey, I probably shouldn’t call you ‘son’ or anything in public, huh?”<br />
<br />
Ian nodded his head in understanding. “Yeah, I’m more of a Daddy right now,” he laughed, lightly punching his father in the shoulder. “How about Bobby, for now. And I ain’t calling you daddy.” He growled with a smirk.<br />
<br />
Mason just shook his head as they stepped into his truck, noticing it creek slightly with the weight of two big men in it. They drove off to the bar, with Mason wondering what kinds of shenanigans this new persona was going to get them into.</p>
