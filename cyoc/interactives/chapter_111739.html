<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ava had been working out all year, and was quite pleased with the results. She was more in shape than she had been, even when she was regularly playing volleyball. She had purchased a couple of new bathing suits at her boyfriend&#39;s request, and actually even thought she looked good in them. She still had trouble putting herself out that way, but it was something she was hoping to overcome.<br />
<br />
It was the middle of fall, and her bathing suits weren’t much use anymore. Pinup calendars were a thing she had seen other women do, but it wasn&#39;t something she ever thought she would feel comfortable with. Still, wanting to push herself and surprise her boyfriend, Ava convinced herself to follow through with the plan.<br />
<br />
Her boyfriend had always called her a mermaid, and had tried to get her to buy a tail, but they couldn&#39;t find one that worked for a reasonable price. Ava looked for a place that might help her make a mermaid pinup calendar. She found a place called &#39;Mythological Calendar Co.&#39; that specialised in photoshoots and calendar making involving mythological costumes. From Alluring Aardvarks to Zebra Centaurs, we&#39;ve got it all! the site promised.<br />
<br />
She rushed through the agreement and payment pages, and booked an appointment on a day she wasn&#39;t working, but her boyfriend was. She closed the page, hid the confirmation email, and closed the laptop, blushing already. The appointment was in a couple of weeks, so she also booked hair and waxing appointments. It wasn&#39;t going to be fun, but she figured a pinup mermaid probably wouldn&#39;t have hair.. there.. and hair on her legs would interfere with the costume.<br />
<br />
She could feel the burning in her cheeks and put the whole thing out of her mind, returning to a knitting project.<br />
<br />
Two weeks later.<br />
<br />
Ava wasn&#39;t quite prepared when she walked into the salon. Immediately, upon walking in, she became self conscious about the reasons she booked the appointment. Babbling a little bit, she managed to explain what she wanted done. The salon workers were discrete and supportive, but Ava was still super red the whole time. She let them do what they thought was best, and tried not to draw any further attention to herself. It felt like an eternity. This is unbearable. This is stupid. This isn&#39;t me. I can&#39;t leave now.. but.. She would have done anything to leave, but couldn&#39;t. After a couple of hours, it was finally over - she paid and rushed out before even looking in a mirror.<br />
<br />
It wasn&#39;t until she had been home for half an hour that she worked up the courage to go upstairs and look at herself. Her hair was cut and styled a little shorter than before, right around her shoulders. The wax job was very well done, but it hurt a little more than she expected. She felt awkward about the whole thing. Looking at herself in the mirror she instantly had doubts that she could go through with the calendar.<br />
<br />
I can&#39;t do this.. what have I gotten myself into?<br />
<br />
She heard someone coming up the front step, quickly got dressed and headed downstairs.<br />
<br />
&quot;oOO. I like the hair cut&quot; He said, leaning in for a kiss, when he came inside.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mhmm. I&#39;m glad.&quot; Ava said returning the kiss. Hesitating she added &quot;I also got some waxing done.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh?&quot; He said, adjusting his pants slightly. &quot;Your legs?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;maybe you should come find out.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ethan guided Ava to the couch while removing her pants.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your legs are so smooth...&quot; he said, stroking them. His eyes caught her crotch area. Normally, a few hairs were still visible on either side, but there was only smooth, if slightly irritated skin.<br />
<br />
He brought his hand up, reaching inside and felt all around her crotch. He shuddered and tensed a bit, as though he were fighting an orgasm.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my sweet sexy siren.&quot; he pulled down the panties enough to kiss just beneath the panty line before kissing his way up her sculpted middle, and between her breasts on his way to her lips. He got mostly on top of her, one hand inside her panties, stroking the whole area. He kissed her several times before she shifted, undoing his pants and reaching one hand inside his pants. Finding his cock, she squeezed and stroked it just as he was doing to her. It didn&#39;t take long for them both to climax. They rested on the couch together.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well.. we&#39;d better get cleaned up for dinner.&quot; Ava said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Haha, yeah&quot; Ethan said, getting up awkwardly, trying to avoid the mess in his underwear.<br />
<br />
Ava felt better, and, though she still didn&#39;t want to think about it, she was more comfortable with the idea of going through with the photoshoot.<br />
<br />
<br />
Ava managed to drive to Mythological Calendar Co. in time for her appointment, and even walked inside with reasonable aplomb. Once inside however, she was overwhelmed by what she saw.<br />
<br />
Rows of costumes, assorted sets. It was a converted warehouse that would have housed at least two dozen staff, but now she saw no one.<br />
<br />
&quot;Coming!&quot; She heard - apparently there was at least one person inside.<br />
<br />
An older woman rounded the corner, how old Ava couldn&#39;t tell. She was neither in shape nor out of shape, neither old nor young, and it seemed to Ava that this woman could easily blend in to nearly any crowd.<br />
<br />
&quot;You must be Ava.&quot; The woman asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes..&quot; Ava said a bit timidly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, perk up a little. This is going to be fun. You&#39;re a beautiful young woman posing for her boyfriend. There is nothing to be afraid or ashamed of.&quot;<br />
<br />
This piercing comment caught Ava a little off-guard.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry, you&#39;re not the first, and, for my sake, I hope you&#39;re not the last!<br />
<br />
Now before you think about backing down, let&#39;s get into this. What you were you thinking? Faerie? Lamia?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My boyfriend calls me a mermaid, and, I thought it would be fun to do a mermaid calendar.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Great! What kind of mermaid? Fish? Dolphin? Orca? .. Octopus..?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh.. I don&#39;t know, what do you think?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, you can do 12 shots with one costume, or for the price of 2 costumes, you can 12 shots with as many different costumes as you like. &quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Given the cost.. 12 different costumes, I guess..&quot;<br />
<br />
The photoshoot went by in a semi-awkward blur. In truth, it wasn&#39;t that bad, but she still wasn&#39;t used to it. Still, holding the finished calendar in her hands, she had to admit that some of them looked pretty good, and that her boyfriend would probably love it. After settling up, she went home, stashed it in a drawer, and did her best to forget it.<br />
<br />
Christmas finally rolled around and she timidly opened the bottom drawer of her night table, and removed the calendar. She blushed even before opening it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my, I can&#39;t do this..&quot; she said aloud.<br />
<br />
She opened it at random, finding a picture of herself with the legs of horse like some sort of faun. She hated it. &quot;This is insane, how did I think this was a good idea?&quot; She shut the calendar, but it back in its hiding place, and decided to go find another gift for her boyfriend.<br />
<br />
She didn&#39;t notice a card falling out as she hid the calendar, it read:<br />
<br />
This calendar must be delivered to the intended recipient within five days of the new year. Failing this, the model will be subject to the consequence clause. <br />
Consequence clause: The model posed for the recipient for his or her enjoyment. If the model does not supply the calendar, the model will take the form posed as for the calendar month when...</p>
