<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Erick's new pet. Just rub your chest with one of the clothes and see what happens,&quot; John said with a laugh.<br />
<br />
&quot;Pet! You're kidding right?&quot; Luke said gently rubbing his left pec with the cloth stuck to his right hand. <br />
<br />
He drew the cloth away and let out a yelp.  His left nipple had divided into two identical nipples, and the <br />
lower one started to migrate down his chest. He stared, it was like watching cells divide. Each of his two <br />
left nipples had split to form two tipped nipples, and he was sure they'd split.<br />
<br />
&quot;Four nipples?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, you'll have eight when you rub your other pec,&quot; John answered matter of factly. Then he added, &quot;But <br />
that's not the only change is it?&quot;<br />
<br />
Luke looked and notice that everywhere he had rubbed now had stubble growing out of his skin. It was growing <br />
fast. He was growing chest hairs.  He grinned, but it kept growing. It was a couple inches long and it was <br />
darker than his own hair had been.<br />
<br />
&quot;What's happening?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, now that it's begun, you'll end up rubbing yourself all over, and as you rub, you'll change. Your arms <br />
will become forelegs, you'll grow a nice tail. Come on start rubbing, I want you completely changed before <br />
Erick arrives,&quot; John commanded. <br />
<br />
Luke tried to resist, but he felt compelled to obey, and worse yet his unfurry skin had started to itch <br />
intensely, He needed to rub it.  He grit his teeth. They itched too. Before he realized it he was rubbing his <br />
teeth and lips and chin and nose.  He felt his teeth becoming pointy in his mouth, and then his muzzle pushed <br />
out from his face. He really was becoming an animal.  He dashed to the full-length mirror in the entry. His <br />
father stood in the doorway of his study looking at Luke. Luke looked to him for help.<br />
<br />
&quot;Father, Uncle John's done something awful to me. Look!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What? It's not awful, Luke, it's just not finished. Now start rubbing, you'll make Erick an excellent Black <br />
Lab,&quot; Mike said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm turning into a Labrador Retriever?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Michael, must you constantly spoil my little surprises.  I had wanted Luke to guess what he was becoming,&quot; <br />
John said.<br />
<br />
&quot;What have you done to my father, Uncle John?&quot; Luke barked. He noticed his voice had become harsher and less <br />
distinct. His left hand was massaging his now furry neck. As he stared in the mirror, his hands unbidden slid <br />
up the sides of his head. His hair was soon black all over, his skull flattened and elongated, and floppy <br />
hairy ears hung from the sides of his head. He pulled his hands away from his face. He realized to his horror <br />
that his hands were resting on his butt cheeks and rubbing them. He felt his glutes weaken, and his pelvis <br />
shifting and narrowing. He fell to all fours.  His father and uncle drew up chairs to watch his chance close <br />
up in comfort.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I really should be videotaping this for Erick, he'll never believe this is Luke!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, he'll believe, he's a wizard's son after all. He'll discern Luke's true identity, of that I am sure.&quot;<br />
<br />
Luke looked plaintively at his father, and whimpered, &quot;Woof, woof!&quot; He could no longer speak like a man.<br />
<br />
He was one bizarre looking dog. He had changed completely everywhere he had rubbed himself. But he still had <br />
his pink human male genitalia, and his hands.  His feet and hind legs were completely canine, as was his tail <br />
and head.  His torso was barrel like and furry. He now had 8 nipples, and thanked God that they were hopefully <br />
still vestigial. It had occurred to him that neither his uncle nor father had said where he was a stud or <br />
bitch dog.  He recalled his father and uncle debating the merits of having a bitch or stud dog or having it <br />
fixed. His father had come down heavily in favor of having a bitch, since she could be used to produce puppies <br />
that could be sold to offset the expense of her upkeep. Luke couldn't remember what his uncle's position had <br />
been. He hoped he favored the stud dog.  Luke didn't want to be a female or neuter.  He wondered what Erick <br />
wanted. Did Erick even know that his father was doing this to Luke?  He couldn't believe Erick would be happy <br />
about this. They weren't just cousins, they were buddies. Weren't they?<br />
<br />
He resisted as long as he could. If anyone could see Luke's face under his fur, it would have been beet red.  <br />
He was so embarrassed, but his cock and balls begged to be rubbed, and as he rubbed he felt them changing.</p>
