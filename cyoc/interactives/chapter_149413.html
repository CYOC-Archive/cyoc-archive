<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">    Magic circling outside his palm, the tome in Kenos&#39; hand shines with a dark luster. The blood written words grow thick and viscous, trailing off the rotted pages and into the claws of its wielder. Tendrils of crimson liquid coil around the serpentman&#39;s claws, coagulating at the circular runes encompassing his hand. With a clench of his fist and the flick of his wrist, a dozen needles of frozen blood sail towards the cult of reptilian men.<br />
<br />
    Her blade parallel to the ground, Cynthia&#39;s dark clothed figure dashes forward without a hint of hesitance. The sailing of the blood knives and the motions of the clansmen slowing to a seeming halt, the librarian sorceress slips past the wall of knives with ease as they fly, the movements of their reptilian targets sluggish yet purposeful.<br />
<br />
    Time flowing back into reality, Kenos&#39; serpentine maw twists into an annoyed frown, his former clansmen insultingly slashing the crimson needles away with their claws. Either his power in this body he inhabited had caused inhibition, or his cohorts abilities had been amplified.<br />
<br />
    Glancing to the agile form of Cynthia as she lunges towards the clansmen, the snakeman&#39;s eyes flash as an idea comes to mind.<br />
<br />
    Focusing her attention to the lizardmen at the far left of the group and extending the arm that held her blade, the librarian soars into the air with a graceful flip. Rearing a leg back, the ragged hiss of a reptilian mage cuts through the tense silence, the lizardman&#39;s jaw slamming shut as Cynthia&#39;s heel makes contact. <br />
<br />
    Sent to the ground, blood spurts from the reptilian&#39;s nostrils. Not even given a chance to be saved by it&#39;s cohorts as the witch lifts him up by the scruff of his robe. With a twirl and a final flash of her blade, the clansmen goes limp in her grip, lifelessly crumpling to the floor alongside his ownerless tome. The scent of blood sullies the air, leaking from the hole in the lizardman&#39;s chest.<br />
<br />
    Leaping away from the remaining group, the sorceress wipes away the blood on her glasses, her eyes narrow and cold, smile cruel and sadistic.<br />
<br />
    &quot;Two down, four to go. I really hope the rest of you lot can put up more of a struggle than that.&quot; Blade spinning between her fingers, the dark sorceress angles her sword towards the clansmen once again. Her grey eyes dart to Kenos, the blue serpentfolk locking eyes with her. &quot;Standing there isn&#39;t very helpful, now is it? I&#39;ll hold his followers off while you lovingly commit patricide.&quot;<br />
<br />
    The idea was mutual.<br />
<br />
    The form of his father seemed uncaring even as blasts of magic were evaded from behind him. His followers were easily replaced, nothing more than sacrifices for the end goal.<br />
<br />
    In unison, the tomes in the claws of both father and son shine in a lusterless radiance. Red and purple slitted orbs lock as they utter incantations of a long dead language. One out of spite, the other out of unbridled hate.<br />
<br />
    Crossing his arms across his chest, Kenos&#39; fangs grit. The pages in his tome flutter as the bloody words trickle off their pages onto his other hand, the dark substance quickly solidifying as his fist clenches. Slamming the pages of his tome shut, the arm with the liquid rears back to his left shoulder. Digging his claws into the dirt road, the snakeman gestures a slash.<br />
<br />
    Following his movements, with a splatter the solidifying blood morphs into a curved blade. Remaining apathetic even as the blade whizzes towards him, Kenos&#39; father scowls, outstretching his hand as the blade nears him. The sickening sound of skin tearing resounds as the blade makes contact, the crimson leaking from his palms contrasting the deathly white scales of the rest of his body.<br />
<br />
    &quot;A purposselessss movement.&quot; Kenos&#39; lips frown, the blood puddling at his father&#39;s feet.<br />
<br />
    &quot;Purposeless?&quot; Kenos&#39; muscles tense, the contemptuous voice of his father cutting deeper than the blade of blood he had sent ever could. Readying his tome, the blue snakeman&#39;s eyes examine the form of his father in stunned curiosity. As if time were reversing, the puddle of blood flowed from said puddle in strands upwards, completely defying gravity. The strands of crimson liquid messily crawling inside the gash on the white reptilian&#39;s hand. <br />
<br />
    As his wound heals, the mad eyes of his father dig into him, fangs glinting as he smiles. &quot;It truly is purposeless; your existence of course.&quot; <br />
<br />
    Kenos flinches, tome almost slipping from his claws. His purple eyes dilate in shock as the white form of his father slowly steps towards him, Cynthia&#39;s massacre of his cohorts going completely unnoticed by him.<br />
<br />
    &quot;Even your very actions lack purpose.&quot; The blue serpent trembles as his father places a claw against his cheek, trailing it down his face until it lay at his neck. &quot;Someone like you could never hold courage; every movement and spell cast have been dictated by your everlasting fear of me.&quot; A shaky breath slipping from his maw, Kenos places a hand on the wrist of the lizardman&#39;s arm. <br />
<br />
    &quot;Lacking a purpossse and courage will not sssstop me from killing you.&quot; Stepping to the side, Kenos yanks the white scaled arm of his father, the reptilian clan leader stumbling forth at the gesture. Expression stern and eyes cold, the serpentman brings his claws down upon the back of his father&#39;s neck, sending the lizardman to the ground face first.<br />
<br />
    Not bothering to give him a chance to recover, Kenos relentlessly drives his heel into the back of the reptilian&#39;s neck, his lips twisting into a grin at the pained grunts of his father. <br />
<br />
    With a satisfying crack, the white lizardman stills, his red eyes becoming dull, almost purple. <br />
<br />
    Rolling his body over, Kenos tears the robe around his father to shreds, falling to his knees at the lizardman&#39;s chest. Laying his tome to his side, Kenos fingers rapidly clench and unclench as they near his father&#39;s chest. Digging his claws into the pale scaled reptilian&#39;s torso, a scream of unleashed fury echoes from the depths of Kenos&#39; being, claws tearing through the hardened scales as a knife would butter.<br />
<br />
    With a final sickening squelch, the serpentman tears his arm free from the chest of his father&#39;s body, heart sitting within his blood soaked hands.<br />
<br />
    &quot;To think ssssomeone ssuch as you could ever have a heart. The thought was unbelievable, but sssseeing as how you do, it ssseems it was long dead.&quot; Clenching his fist, the heart explodes into a mess of red liquid, drenching his blue scales and coloring them red.<br />
<br />
    Rising to his feet, Kenos glances a final time to the limp remains of the body, a single tear falling from his left eye. Wiping it away in hatred, the snakeman spits at the body, turning around to meet the grey eyes of Cynthia. <br />
<br />
    Just like him, she too was covered in the blood of the lizardmen clansmen. The remains of the six reptilian cultists lay splayed about behind her, the ground dyed a deep crimson that would eventually fade to a dull bronze.<br />
<br />
    Placing her arms on her hips, Cynthia&#39;s lips curled into a smile. &quot;Seems like we&#39;ve made quite a mess of ourselves.&quot; Her eyes fall to the form behind him, the smile vanishing from her face. &quot;He seems smaller than I remember.&quot;<br />
<br />
    Face twisting in confusion, Kenos spins around to examine the body, his jaw dropping as his muscles tense.<br />
<br />
    The dead eyes that lifelessly gazed up at him were not those of his father.<br />
<br />
    They were his own. The eyes of a child who had lived his life in fear.<br />
<br />
    His soulless body had been used as a doppelganger, flesh melded and twisted into an exact clone of his father.<br />
<br />
     A phantom.<br />
<br />
    Stepping back before crumpling to his knees, Kenos vomits.<br />
<br />
    Hyperventilating, he could do little but quietly fade away as Cynthia&#39;s voice desperately called his name. <br />
<br />
    Purple eyes going blank, the anguished soul of the lizardman fades as a courageous blue floods into his slitted orbs.<br />
<br />
    Catching himself with his hands, the serpentman retches, spitting the remains of whatever he had consumed earlier from his maw. Panting desperately, the blue reptilian&#39;s breath slows as a gentle hand helps him rise to his feet. <br />
<br />
    Shaking his head, the blue eyes of the serpentman tiredly meet the gentle worried grey eyes of the librarian from earlier, her face filled with apprehension.<br />
<br />
    Glancing to his hand, his serpentine eyes widen in horror as countless scales cover them, dried flakes of blood blotting out the blue. Immediately his arm breaks free from the woman&#39;s grip, his form falling onto his rear, unable to stand out of pure panic.<br />
<br />
    Maw agape and chest heaving, his blue eyes move from his hands to his feet, breath quickening at the wicked claws adorning the tips and the long snake-like tail trailing from behind him. Clutching his face, a gasp freezes within his throat as a picture of a serpent forms within his mind.<br />
<br />
    Eyes darting across his body wildly, the serpentman&#39;s hand trails down his face to his neck, claws tracing against the repulsive slimy exterior of his scales. His other hand recoiling from his maw to rub his tail, the feeling of his claws massaging the bizarre appendage causes his scales to tremble. Thoughts foreign yet familiar. Memories that were <i>his</i> but not his <i>own</i>.<br />
<br />
    Hand at his neck trailing and feeling the rest of his body, carnal desires plague the reptile&#39;s fragile mind as the tip of his tail smacks against his sack, the impact and resounding feeling forcing him to his back.<br />
<br />
    Forked tongue spilling from his jaws, the snakeman&#39;s hand rises up before his face, rapidly clenching and unclenching. Bringing it down to his face, a shrill hiss echoes from the recesses of the serpent&#39;s essence as he imbedes a claw into his cheek.<br />
<br />
    &quot;What&#39;sss… What issss--?!&quot; <br />
<br />
    His scales freeze up as the woman&#39;s hands grasp his wrists. Touch warm and soothing, her voluptuous form kneels over his prone body. Blue slitted eyes wider than dinner plates and jaw agape, his arms go limp as the human woman guides his hands up to the edges of his face.<br />
<br />
    Silence flooding the air, her lips curl into a gentle smile, her hands retreating from his as she rose up from the ground, stepping away and allowing the moon to fill his vision.<br />
<br />
    Like a door opening within his mind, the blue snakeman pulls at his face, scales retreating and coagulating at his face.<br />
<br />
    In a burst of light, the blue scaled mask of a snake lay within his palms, the leather of his gloves squeaking against the cool scales. Pulling away in shock, the mask falls to his lap.<br />
<br />
    Breathing slowing, the red clothed human glances upwards to meet the grey eyes of Cynthia, her hand extended to him. Accepting it, she helps him to his feet a third time, leaning his body against her own. Mask and a foreign tome clutched tightly in his hands, the tall slender form of the librarian helps him walk to a small building, pieces of glass littering the dirt road; no doubt from a smashed window.<br />
<br />
    Each step sluggish and slow, his tired blue eyes clench shut as they suddenly halted, opening to meet the gentle smile of a yellow kobold, his amber eyes glowing in joy.<br />
<br />
    &quot;Welcome back... Kairos.&quot;<br />
<br />
    At the sound of his name, the blonde haired human could only smile, realizing that he had been returned to normal.</p>
