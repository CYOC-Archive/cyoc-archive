<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As  Gloria and Nate were coming in from the outside, Naomi had to use the restroom, but when she opened the door, she caught a quick glance of the mummy girl, Libby, and her boyfriend with some of their clothes off and making out in the bathroom.<br />
<br />
&quot;OH MY GOD!&quot; Naomi shouted as she partially closed the bathroom door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Have you ever heard of knocking?!&quot; Libby rhetorically asked Naomi.<br />
<br />
&quot;Get your clothes back on and get out of there, this is a bathroom, not your personal bedroom.&quot; Naomi demanded as Libby and her boyfriend got their costumes back on and got out of the bathroom letting Naomi into the restroom.<br />
<br />
Gloria had seen some of this and knew that things might soon be getting a little too out of hand here. Gloria looked over to see the Vampire couple looking a little drunk and went over to sniff their drinks to find it had been spiked by someone.<br />
<br />
Gloria looked over to see Nate&#39;s brother, Adam, who was spiking some of the drinks being passed out and some of the other couples either didn&#39;t notice it, or thought it was cool.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s okay Gloria, don&#39;t worry, I&#39;ll handle this.&quot; Nate said as he went to over to talk with his brother.<br />
<br />
Gloria then heard a shatter as she saw someone had bumped into a lamp and it fell on the ground. Gloria now seemed to be getting very mad now, but she thought that maybe things might calm down until she saw someone letting some more teens into the party who were obviously former trick-or-treaters. The wish Gloria had made earlier made it so when they got to the front door, they would become teenagers, and she made sure the wish would change them all back to normal once they left.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh....Gloria? You okay?&quot; Sasha asked Gloria whose face was burning red.<br />
<br />
&quot;EVERYBODY OUT OF MY HOUSE, THIS PARTY IS FUCKING OVER!!!!!!!&quot; Gloria shouted as the teenage party guests began to leave and once they did, they turned back into parents with their kids trick or treating, or kids with their older siblings trick or treating.<br />
<br />
Gloria saw Nate coming up to her. <br />
<br />
&quot;Gloria, are you going to be okay?&quot; Nate asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just take your brother and get out of here.&quot; Gloria said crossing her arms as Nate grabbed his twin brother and they left the house, and now Adam once again became his little brother, which Gloria was relieved to see, she thought Adam was a total jerk being a teenager.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, could we all stay a little bit longer? We were kind of hoping the party would last another hour or so.&quot; Clark, the teenager in the superhero costume asked Gloria.<br />
<br />
Gloria looked to see that the six original people she had let in at the door wanted to stay longer and was still feeling pretty upset at how her party had ended and took her anger out on the six of them now.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ugh! I can&#39;t even believe I let you six in my house to begin with. You&#39;ve got to get your lives together. I wish you all would just grow up already!&quot; Gloria again absentmindedly wished.<br />
<br />
Gloria watched as the six teens now progressed into adulthood. Libby, and her boyfriend, Woodrow, progressed into their mid 40s and Libby had actually gained a little bit of weight. Damon grew to have a muscular figure, and surprisingly Cammy did too as her years married to Damon had inspired her to keep in shape. Clark, the teen in the superhero outfit, and his girlfriend, Holly, both grew into adulthood and now both wore business suits.<br />
<br />
All six of them looked around and saw the mess that remained after the party and now looked at Gloria with disappointed looks.<br />
<br />
&quot;Gloria, I can&#39;t believe the mess you made to your house.&quot; Mrs. Holly Lowry (Clark&#39;s wife) said to Gloria.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know, I&#39;m sorry Mrs. Lowry, it wasn&#39;t meant to get all out of control, but I thought it would just be fun for me and my friends.&quot; Gloria explained to them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well you&#39;re lucky I don&#39;t tell your father what you did young lady.&quot; Mr. Damon Keats said to Gloria.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know what, you&#39;re parents don&#39;t have to know everything that happened here tonight Gloria. We&#39;ll all help you and your friends clean up this mess.&quot; Mrs. Libby Chipman promised to Gloria.<br />
<br />
&quot;We will?&quot; Mr. Woodrow Chipman asked as her his wife nudged him in the stomach.<br />
<br />
Gloria thanked the adults, and soon all of them, including Gloria&#39;s friends all helped Gloria clean up her house. Gloria learned some things about their lives as adults. Mr. Damon Keats worked alongside Jason as his company. Mrs. Libby Chipman worked with Reiko and was actually the first person to confide to her that she was bisexual. Holly surprisingly was a coworker and friend to Aunt Ann and she introduced her to her husband, Clark Lowry.<br />
<br />
After everything was cleaned up and looked good, Gloria said goodbye to the three couples.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, Gloria, are you not going to change them back?&quot; Naomi asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, I changed them before because I was mad, but it&#39;s kind of funny now that I see them like this.&quot; Gloria said.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I could&#39;ve left any of the other party members whatever age I wanted to. But I originally wished the three of them to be together on Halloween and I think the ring was trying to tell me that those six needed each other more in their lives than they realized.&quot; Gloria said with a smile on her face as she saw the three couples walk to their homes with their lives changed hopefully for the better.<br />
<br />
&quot;That seems ridiculous to me.&quot; Naomi said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe. But to me, it feels like Halloween magic.&quot; Gloria said.</p>
