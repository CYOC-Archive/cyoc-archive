<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;That looks like fun,&quot; said Douglas Hale, intently watching werefox William Anderson fuck his wife&#39;s werecat ass while she ate out his wife&#39;s werevixen cunt.<br />
&quot;You up to a little anal honey?&quot; he asked his mate, even as he moved his werefox penis into position.<br />
&quot;Only a little?&quot; teased Dawn Hale, briefly taking her mouth away from Martha Anderson&#39;s juicy werecat pussy. The werevixen raised her tail and wiggled her ass in anticipation of what was about to happen, even as she went back to eating her new female partner.<br />
Martha could feel Dawn&#39;s moan through her vagina as Douglas&#39; werefox penis entered his wife&#39;s ass. The fact that she was now eating werecat pussy with more enthusiasm than ever before just proved to Martha how great anal sex with a capable partner was, even as William continued to fuck her own rear.<br />
<br />
MEANWHILE...<br />
The Jenkins and Jenny Harper looked over everything in awe as they were ushered from the car into the Tachibana residence. <br />
It was a modest two story structure as far as size went. No swimming pool or lavish acreage. Just a simple house amongst many in a quiet neighborhood with a lot of rooms that were originally converted into bedrooms when the surviving family emigrated to America from Japan after World War 2.<br />
Now that the family had grown, leading to new generations of Tachibanas within the Moon Lake community, most of the downstairs rooms had been converted back to their original purposes, with only the upstairs being truly residential now.<br />
But what had impressed the new arrivals the most was the decor.<br />
No one was certain where everything came from, but an ancient Oriental flair was present everywhere, from the wall hangings to the rugs. There was more traditional American furniture amidst the rest, but even when guests were in the house, those fixtures seem kind of out of place compared to the rest.<br />
A man in an all black suit showed the Jenkins and Jenny to the den, where a large sofa and a couple of chairs, along with a modest size television and a coffee table sat. The only Oriental touches in this room were the pictures, landscapes of a more scenic Japan showing no modern buildings, only things like temples and cherry blossom trees in bloom.<br />
When they were alone, Mister Jenkins asked, &quot;Do we need to kick our shoes off or something?&quot;<br />
&quot;Nobody said anything about that when we came in, so just leave them on for now,&quot; replied his son Harry. Everyone had left their overnight bags by the door as they entered the room.<br />
The older Jenkins took the sofa. Harry sat in one of the large, comfy chairs, and Jenny sat in his lap, more for comfort and support than a lack of somewhere else to rest.<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry I got you all into this mess,&quot; she apologized to everyone again.<br />
&quot;It&#39;s not your fault honey,&quot; Mrs. Jenkins said, trying to reassure her. &quot;I blame your folks and that Dieter Wilhelm guy. What kind of a name is that anyway? German?&quot;<br />
&quot;I believe so,&quot; answered Jenny. &quot;My dad works for his family and has always tried to play matchmaker between me and him. I&#39;ve never wanted anything to do with the guy. Everyone back in Alabama is part of the reason why I chose to attend college in Moon Lake in the first place. I wanted to get a fresh start and try to establish a new life without them. I never foresaw falling in love,&quot; she added, before kissing the top of Harry&#39;s head, &quot;or going furry.&quot;<br />
&quot;Well, even though the formal ceremony isn&#39;t until next Saturday, you&#39;re part of our family now,&quot; said Mister Jenkins, &quot;and one thing this family does is stick by each other through thick and thin. We and everyone else will do our best to make sure you get your happily ever after and beyond,&quot; he promised.<br />
&quot;Thank you. Thank you all,&quot; said Jenny, fighting a losing battle to keep from crying.<br />
&quot;Here honey,&quot; said Harry&#39;s mom, pulling a tissue out of her purse to give to Jenny.<br />
<br />
ELSEWHERE...<br />
Akane Tachibana was uncertain what the original purpose of the room was when they first moved to Moon Lake and made arrangements to buy the house. She originally used it as a bedroom for her youngest child, the lone daughter Akane and her late husband had just before his death near the end of the war. Now a woman in her own right and happily married with children of her own, Akane used it as her private study and personal sanctuary to get away from the stress of the world and mediate.<br />
But that was not possible right now with the endangered guests under Skulk protection occupying her den and the phone on her desk ringing.<br />
&quot;Daisuke here,&quot; said the voice on the other end. The grandson in charge of security for both Skulk and Tachibana&#39;s business holdings, he had led the capture of the suspect and was now reporting to her about his findings after the discrete search of the man&#39;s campsite.<br />
&quot;The news is not good,&quot; he said. &quot;We have found a rather large and buried cache of weapons and ammunition here, along with some suggestive evidence that perhaps the man currently in police custody might have killed the original owners of that VW vehicle he currently drives.&quot;<br />
&quot;Of what nature?&quot; asked his grandmother.<br />
&quot;A bloody rag amongst his trash. There are two distinctive scents. Both male. Neither of which are his or that of any animal.&quot;<br />
&quot;I see,&quot; said Akane, thinking things over for a moment before speaking again. &quot;If you have not done so already, notify the police about your findings immediately. Continue cooperating with them fully, but for everyone&#39;s sake I want you to start verifying that at the moment, this suspect is acting alone, and that there is no one else either already here or on their way to Moon Lake to assist him.&quot; <i>I cannot imagine anyone within Moon Lake, were or normal, acting against this town, but there is too much at stake in the coming week to take that for granted on simple faith.</i><br />
&quot;I understand,&quot; was all Daisuke said, not bothering to point out the enormity of what his grandmother and leader of the Skulk had just asked of him. <i>Is this just a wise precaution, or does Grandma-san suspect something? Oregon authorities will want to know what happened to the true owner of that VW, but it would be best if otherwise our efforts remain local, no matter how tightly our forces are stretched.</i></p>
