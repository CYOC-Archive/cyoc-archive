<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">While Evan sat in the den trying to act like everything was normal and slowly getting used to his new height and build, Jeremy was sitting dejectedly at his desk cleaning off the last bits of cum from his laptop keyboard.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fucking Evan and his fucking friends...&quot; he muttered under his breath, wiping the last stain away as best he could, &quot;I bet even his stupid dick is perfect.&quot;<br />
<br />
He stared at his laptop, and sighed. He really didn&#39;t have the willpower to try and do homework right now, with the sound of video game gunfire and laughter coming from down the hall. He closed his laptop, stretched, and yawned to himself. It was too early to go to bed, but he felt done for the day. Shrugging, he got up and padded out the door and down the hallway. Maybe he&#39;d go take a shower and try to clear his head.<br />
<br />
The bathroom was the fourth and final door in the hallway, and, seeing that it was open a crack, Jeremy figured there was nobody inside and casually swung open the door. To his shock and embarrassment, there was someone there.<br />
<br />
Caleb had always been Jeremy&#39;s favorite of his brothers friends, not that there was much competition. He was never too harsh on him, and he had a playful sense of humor and a polite air which was a welcome relief from the raucous shenanigans the rest of the group got up to. It also helped that he was pretty gorgeous, with wavy black hair, light brown skin and bright, friendly gray eyes.<br />
<br />
And now, Jeremy had walked in on Caleb with his dick out, just finishing up taking a piss. His mind went empty. He froze.<br />
<br />
For a moment, Caleb didn&#39;t seem to notice that someone had opened the door. He rolled his head around his shoulders, letting out a sigh of relief as he reached down and shook out his dick. Against his better judgement, Jeremy&#39;s eyes drifted down to it. And...fuck. It was big.<br />
<br />
Caleb was fully soft, but his cock looked nearly as big as Jeremy&#39;s was hard. He hadn&#39;t expected it — Caleb was the shortest of Evan&#39;s friends, just a few inches taller than Jeremy himself — but now that he was looking at it he could barely take his eyes off of it. The boy was uncut, with heavy looking balls, and above all he was *thick*. Jeremy hadn&#39;t had much experience with sex — frankly he tried not to think about his sexuality too much, what with his brother calling him a queer or a pansy whenever he did something wrong — but staring at Caleb&#39;s gently swaying member he felt a pang of desire. With the desire, though, came bitterness. He bit his lip, and found himself thinking: why can&#39;t I look like that? Why do other guys have all the luck?<br />
<br />
As soon as he had that thought, two things happened. Caleb turned and noticed him, and, at the exact same moment, a familiar pain shot through his head. It wasn&#39;t as bad this time, and he felt it in his eyes more than anywhere else, but he flinched and clutched his head, clenching his eyes shut. Thankfully, the fact that he looked like he was in pain must have made it seem like he&#39;d just walked it and flinched away from seeing Caleb with his pants down. He heard the boy laugh as the pain reached its peak.<br />
<br />
&quot;No worries, little dude, happens to everybody,&quot; he said, but Jeremy could barely hear the words, &quot;It&#39;s...hey, are you alright?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeremy&#39;s eyes shot open just in time to see the last tinge of green fading from his vision, and he shook his head as the pain cleared away.<br />
<br />
&quot;I...yeah, I&#39;m fine,&quot; he managed, &quot;I&#39;m sorry I barged in, we usually close the...door...&quot;<br />
<br />
He trailed off. Caleb had turned to face him, and seeing his dick head-on was almost overwhelming. Jeremy couldn&#39;t help but let his eyes trace over the swaying, egg-sized balls, the broad head that almost peaked out of his foreskin even soft, and just...the size of it all. Still soft it looked nearly twice the size his own dick was hard. What would that make it? 9 inches? 10? And the girth...it was as thick around as Jeremy&#39;s wrist.<br />
<br />
&quot;S-sorry,&quot; he said, forcing his eyes away from it and hoping Caleb didn&#39;t notice his lingering stare, &quot;Your, uh, fly is still open.&quot;<br />
<br />
He blushed, and half flinched away as he internally prepared for Caleb to lash out at him for staring at his dick.<br />
<br />
—<br />
<br />
Caleb didn&#39;t know what was going on with Evan&#39;s brother. The kid was awkward at the best of times, but for a moment there it had looked like he was about to faint. After that, though, he&#39;d just trailed off out of nowhere, and looked down at Caleb&#39;s waist. Confused, Caleb glanced down as well, and...froze.<br />
<br />
He&#39;d always been proud of his dick, five inches soft and a good eight inches hard — well, seven and a half, but none of his lays needed to know that. He liked being a shower. Now, though, his softy made his usual erections look tiny. He gaped at it, mouth hanging open as he tried to wrap his head around what he was seeing. When the fuck had this happened? He&#39;d touched his dick a second ago when he used the toilet, but now it looked like he could barely fit one hand around it. Even with Evan&#39;s brother watching, part of him suddenly felt tempted to try. The thought sent a wave of arousal through him, and he felt his dick begin to stiffen ever so slightly.<br />
<br />
&quot;S-sorry,&quot; the kid said, and Caleb forced his eyes away from his dick, &quot;Your, uh, fly is still open.&quot;<br />
<br />
Caleb reddened, and tried to sound annoyed, his mind still fixed on his slowly hardening dick.<br />
<br />
&quot;And why were you looking at it, kid? Perving out on me?&quot; he managed, and Jeremy turned red, but the words felt half hearted.<br />
<br />
In the back of Caleb&#39;s mind, a thought started to form. How tiny would Evan&#39;s bro look next to him? He wasn&#39;t about to complain that he&#39;d suddenly grown a monster cock — what use was freaking out over it? And, after all, if he had it, shouldn&#39;t he show it off? He almost felt glad the kid had been there to see it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well,&quot; he said, reading down and wrapping a fist around his shaft, &quot;stare all you like, little guy. It&#39;s not every day you get to see a cock like this.&quot;<br />
<br />
The words felt foreign in his mouth, but saying them sent another shiver of arousal up his spine. The kid — Jeremy, he remembered — glanced nervously from his face to his dick once, twice, a third time, and then turned and fled, running into his room and slamming the door behind him.<br />
<br />
Caleb watched him leave with a lopsided grin. When the boy was finally gone, he shook his head. What had come over him? What was he, some kind of exhibitionist now? He should probably see a doctor, in case whatever was happening to his junk was some kind of swelling, or a tumor, but...still. Somehow he knew, deep in his bones, that having a dick like this meant he should show it off. With that thought in his head, he somehow couldn&#39;t get too worried.<br />
<br />
Giving one last appreciative glance to his newly engorged cock, he pulled up his boxers and jeans, zipped his fly, and washed his hands. Checking himself in the mirror, he paused. Something wasn&#39;t right. Carefully, he reached down and adjusted the angle of his dick in his pants, moving it towards the middle so his fading semi bulged against the fabric in all the right places. That was better. He&#39;d figure out what had happened later. For now, he had a game to win. Evan had almost beat his high score. Still marveling at the feeling of his junk pressing against the denim of his jeans, he shook his hands dry, and walked back towards the den.</p>
