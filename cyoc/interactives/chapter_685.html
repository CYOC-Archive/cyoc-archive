<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dan was awakened by a high pitched almost kid like scream it seamed to come from somewhere close to where he was sleeping,but where was that, his mind
<br>
 wasent working with him and he was haveing trouble remembering things, his bed seemed familar to him but it was way to big. 
<br>

<br>
 Dan looked down to his covered feet they seemed real short to him, somewhere in the back of his still grogy mind he knew something was wrong here but he
<br>
 couldnt figure just what that was, poor Dan was just to dumb now to put it all together. Dans feable mind went into its now more primitive reflexes and he reached
<br>
 under his blanket to scratch his itchy balls, when he got his hand down there though he felt that the bed was soaked and so were his nuts, a rush of emberisment
<br>
 came over him as a faint memory of him as a not so young teenager of about 15 peeing in his bed while he slept crept over him, oh no i wet the bed again he
<br>
 thought, somewhere in his head he knew that he had grown out of that stage of his life but his mind was so affected by Sean that he wasent even sure of his present
<br>
 age. 
<br>
 He flung the covers off and looked down to his legs they were way to thin to be his and his arms just looked to skinny to him, deep in his mind he knew that he was
<br>
 a bigger guy than this, but what could have happened to him and how. Dan was naked as well and he didnt have that much hair down there and he also knew this
<br>
 was wrong as well, poor Dans mind just wasent coperating with him at all and his head began to ache, he put his hands against his head and applied pressure to it
<br>
 to stop the pounding in it but that didnt work, so he began to crawl out of his bed, it seemed to be way to high as his feet hit the thick carpet. 
<br>

<br>
 Dan looked around his room and noticed the pictures on the walls there was one with a big guy holding a funny shaped ball, it looked familar to him and he seemed
<br>
 to remember throwing the funny looking ball while he was dressed in some weird puffy soft padding under a colorful suit or something &quot;A fwoot bwall?&quot; Dan said
<br>
 out loud in a very high pitched unfamilare tone, &quot;Mwe a fwoot bwall stwar mwe nos dis!&quot; Dan was begging to remember little bits and peices of some past life, a
<br>
 life where he was the big guy in the picture holding the ball and he used to throw the thing around in some great big feild surrounded by tall walls where people
<br>
 were sitting and yelling and stuff. 
<br>

<br>
 Dan saw a football sitting in the corner of his room and made his way over to it and picked it up, it felt comfortable in his hands and he knew that you throw this
<br>
 thing around, he grabed it at the pointed ends and threw it under handedly at the wall, Sean had robed enough of his once genious IQ to render him both physically
<br>
 and mentaly retarded, and he knew that he had thrown the ball the wrong way, but he couldnt remember how to throw it the anymore and he got frustrated at
<br>
 himself and began to throw a tantrum, his memorys were coming back to him a little more each time he saw something familare to him, &quot;Swean dwid dis two mwe!
<br>
 MWE A BWIG BWOY MWE NO WIDDLE KWID! MWE A MWAN!!&quot; Dan screamed in his now preteen retarded voice, memorys of Sean aiming somesort
<br>
 of a ray gun at him came to his feable mind, &quot;SWEAN HWIT MWE WITA WAY GWUN AN DWOS DIS TWO MWE!!!&quot; Dan screamed again as he jumped
<br>
 up and down in another now uncontrolable tantrum. 
<br>

<br>
 Mark had walked into Jays bed area of his room and had sat down next to the sobbing Jay, he was also crying and couldnt stop, he had some how gone from stud
<br>
 to dud during the nite and couldnt remember enough about last nite to figure out what had changed him so dramaticly why did he look like a kid but still know that
<br>
 he was a man, or was he really a kid now, he certainly looked like one and he did wet himself as he slept and only kids do that. 
<br>

<br>
 Jay stoped crying and looked over at his once bigger freand, &quot;What happened to us? who turned us into skinny little kids Mark?&quot; Jay said wiping the tears out of
<br>
 his eyes, &quot;Were not kids Jay at leist I dont think we are? some one just wants us to think that we are, they shaved my face and cut my hair into this stupid looking
<br>
 hair cut!! thats all were adults and I know it!!&quot; Mark said wipping his own face and getting up. &quot;Yea and if were not kids then why are we so small then? Do you
<br>
 have a answer for that one Mark? I mean look at your self your a toothpick dude!&quot; 
<br>

<br>
 Mark tried not to think about that and went to Jays dresser to find something that he could wear to cover up his scrany emberrising body, he was ashambed at the
<br>
 way he felt and looked, and Jays toothpick comment didnt make it any better for him, &quot;Look at your self man! you aint got a lot of room to talk pencil man!!&quot; Mark
<br>
 said angerly at Jay as he rumaged thru Jays dresser for something that might fit his now smaller body, Mark found a tee shirt and threw it at Jay, &quot;Here where that
<br>
 its better than walking around naked!&quot; Mark was still looking for something that would fit him but that was the only tee shirt that Jay had in his drawers, Mark
<br>
 pulled out a pair of jogging pants that Jay had just tossed in unfolded and began to try to put them on they were hugh on him but they had a tie string so Mark tied it
<br>
 as tight as he could and rolled up the legs so he could walk in them, the crotch hung down between his nobby knees and he looked like a clown when he walked. 
<br>

<br>
 Mark had herd some noise from outside of Jays room and knew that no matter what had happened to them that they couldnt get any help crying away their day in
<br>
 Jays room. &quot;come on Jay we've got to go get somebody to help us!&quot; mark said as he tryed to open Jays now heavy door, he looked rediculuse to Jay who was
<br>
 standing up now with his great big old tee shirt that he knew at one time fit him comfortably, but now it hung on him like a moemoe and the short sleives covered his
<br>
 bony elboes and the bottom hung down past his knees, Jays jogging pants made the very skinny shorter Mark look like a kid playing dress up and his bony torso
<br>
 showed every bone he had, he was so completly muscle less that it gave him the creeps just looking at Mark. 
<br>

<br>
 Mark herd noises coming from Dans room and ran to see what it was he opened Dans door and was startled by a young teenager stomping his feet as hard as he
<br>
 could &quot;Who are kid and wheres Dan at?&quot; Mark asked without thinking about it &quot;MWE NWO KWID MWE DWANNY MWE A MWAN DWAM WIT!!!!!&quot;
<br>
 Dan screamed at the strange looking skinny kid stairing at him Jay came into the room and herd Dan trying to talk and coulnt beleive his eyes he looked like Dan
<br>
 but only alot thinner and an easy ten years younger &quot;Dan is that you?&quot; Jay asked quitely trying not to get Dan mad even though he wasent as big as he use to be he
<br>
 still now towered over the pitifully skinny Jay. &quot;MWE DWANNY MWE A MWAN SWEAN DWID DIS TWO MWE WIT A WAY GWUN!!!&quot; Dan screamed
<br>
 back at both of the smaller guys, as he went over to Mark and pushed him down. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;Dam you Dan I didnt mean anything by what I said</p>
