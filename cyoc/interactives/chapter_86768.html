In the sea beneath our ship – The Gentle Lover – a dark shadow moves, expanding and contracting, slowly pushing its way through the sea, getting closer and closer to our ship. It reaches us, now no more than 10 feet away from our stern and there it waits, watching, biding its time as the sun droops lower in the sky.<br />
<br />
--------------------------------<br />
<br />
“This is really boring!” Connie huffed, “Hurry up and learn to speak. I’ve got no one to talk to.”<br />
<br />
I wanted to tell her to just be quiet but I didn’t want to hear animalistic squeal of a voice. It also felt really lonely for us new pigs being unable to talk and share the experience. Instead we were left to dwell on the situation and the physical experience of being changed.<br />
<br />
Maedel had felt great loss early on in her transformation as her prized elf ears widened and flopped down slightly. As the changes settled and we became a little more accustomed to our temporary bodies Maedel still worried about her ears. What if they stay floppy when she changes back? Maedel, the lop-eared Elf. She could never show herself in front of other elves again! It wasn’t until after she’d spent some time worrying that she noticed the changes of her friends and how much bigger they were than her. She’d somehow shrunk the most of all of us, going from tallest of us girls to the smallest by a wide margin.<br />
<br />
Andrew was now very aware of his newly enlarged genitals. It seemed no matter how he tried to move he could feel his balls bounce between his hind legs and although he might have been a little proud of their size in a more private setting he found them to be a bit of an annoyance and embarrasment. Trying to take his mind off of how he felt he decided to concentrate on his other senses. He looked around to see that Maedel was now a red colored pig, slightly smaller than he was. Connie somehow looked very different even though she’d been a pig for what seemed like weeks. She was a very pale pink and actually quite a bit larger than the other pigs though I wasn’t far off being the second largest of the group. Apart from my brighter pink complexion and pointy ears, rather than floppy, me and Connie looked very much alike.<br />
<br />
After exploring the visible differences in his other cellmates and having little else to do, Andrew decided to lay down and try to get some sleep. He’d only closed his eyes for a few seconds before he noticed the smells emanating from us all, smells that were very musky and feminine. It wasn’t long before he could pick out a certain smell and determined it was Maedel’s. It got ever so slightly stronger as she trot toward where he lay seeking comfort. <br />
<br />
Maedel was feeling uncharacteristically meek after finding she was the smallest in our little pen, or perhaps it was that she’d become a more docile breed of pig, either way she found she wanted to cuddle up to Andrew.<br />
<br />
Maedel closeness and pheromones had an immediate effect on Andrew, bestially exciting him, making his blood began pump faster and stirring his loins. This trip was going to be hell for him -stuck in a box with naked girls practically leaking pheromones. He’d love to roll over and jack off where the others couldn’t see but as pig it was impossible! With Maedel now slumped down next to where he lay on his side he felt his now unfamiliar cock swell up to its full size.<br />
<br />
It took only moments for Connie and Maedel to notice the smell of a virile male in our cramped box. I could smell something too but unlike Maedel and Connie, there was no attraction, just a generic male stink that was easy enough to ignore and so I lay down like the others and began to drift off to sleep. For the others it was a little more difficult to put aside. <br />
<br />
It took Maedel a few moments to place the stench but she found it tantalizing and sniffed deep. Connie already knew the smell, having experienced it before when she’d been kept in a pig pen with the common swine but that familiarity just sent lurid thoughts to her head even quicker. Both Connie and Maedel were soon daydreaming about being roughly taken from behind by a strong male.<br />
<br />
The smell of females thickened and Andrew clumsily forced himself up onto his new hooves shoving Maedel aside. He’d figured standing was better than lying there with nothing but want and Maedel’s warm body so close. However, now standing Andrew could feel the weight of his heavy balls and hard boar’s phallus. <br />
<br />
Maedel was now standing and could see the object of her lust from which that sensual smell was emanating. She stood frozen and unthinking. Before her mind could form any thoughts of protestation her body had already turned around, presenting itself to the black boar who happily obliged, lifting itself atop the small red sow.<br />
<br />
“Oh shit!” Maedel  thought, a little too late, “What am I doing?”<br />
The weight of the larger boar held her down. Even if she had thought, or wanted, to escape it would be a struggle but the fact she was trapped served only to stimulate her more. In a moment, she felt the focus of her arousal invade her just as Andrew felt his maleness swallowed up. Maedel squealed In response, or to welcome, the intruder. To Andrew, the sows squeals seemed of encouragement and approval. He pulled his hips back and continued. Maedel panted, snorted and squealed at the boars continued assault that titillated tender parts of her, appreciating it, cherishing it. Carrying the heavy boar on her back was arduous and his pounding was rough and bestial but, admittedly she had allowed it, and was enjoying it, immensely so. Everything else was forgotten as the boar and sow writhed in mutual, mindful pleasure. Passionate and in the moment as ripples of euphoria entered Maedel s body and spread throughout.   <br />
<br />
<br />
A knock rang through the cage causing Connie to instantly stop rubbing her hind end up and down against the boxes wall.<br />
<br />
“Hey, guys its time to try t- What the heck!?” Hazel almost screamed, causing a couple of the sailors working the rigging to look at her dumbfounded, “Uh its nothing you guys… just pigs... doing it…” Hazel smiled awkwardly at the sailors.<br />
<br />
The sailors just laughed and joked between themselves saying Hazel must be a naive city girl and they could show her a thing or two. She did her best not to go over there and show them a fist or two.<br />
<br />
“Ugh seriously? Shall I just come back when you finish?” she asks and I squeal wanting to get out of the box, immediately. My attempt at sleep having long since been aborted, thanks to my cellmates. Hazel obliges and begins whispering, focusing her thoughts and I begin to resemble my usual self.<br />
<br />
“What about me?” Connie says, meekly. <br />
<br />
“Sorry. The only reason I knew the spell to change them into pigs and back is because I tried to change you in my timeline but it never worked. Whatever spell Morgana put on you was built to last.” Hazel sighed.<br />
<br />
I squat in the box naked with Hazel looking down on me. “Umm turn around please?” I ask.<br />
“It’s nothing I haven’t seen a million times before.” She says before commenting, “I forgot how fat my butt used to be.”<br />
“It’s not fat!” I say, sharply.<br />
“Oh please! You are literally kidding no one, not even your future self! You’ve got no muscle at all in there.” She points and my eyes follow her finger to look at my round rump, “It’ll take you months of training to get that thing into shape. Trust me, I know.”<br />
<br />
“Well, maybe I don’t want a flat butt like you.” I say adding a “Hmph” for emphasis.<br />
<br />
If a pig could shrug Connie would have, “Seriously, Sara. Both of you have issues. You need to learn to love yourself to be happy.”<br />
<br />
“Who’d love a crybaby like her?” Hazel snorts pointing her thumb at me.<br />
“Well, who’d love a shaved monkey like her?” I counterattack standing up and pointing viciously at Hazel, completely forgetting I’m butt naked in the process.<br />
<br />
“I’m not the one who smells of pig!” Hazel snaps.<br />
<br />
That last comment touched a nerve and Connie joined the argument saying “Pigs don’t smell that bad! Stop giving them a bad reputation!” whilst she stamp her trotters.<br />
<br />
“Yep, they are clearly very dignified animals as we can see-… Oh! They’re finally done!” Hazel turns to see the piggy Maedel and Andrew have “uncoupled” and begins focusing her mental energies to change them back.<br />
<br />
In few minutes Maedel is crouched down beside me and I hand her back her panties I’d had to help her take off when she first changed. She still seemed quite giddy and I was sure she’d fall over any second. “Are you okay?”<br />
“T-this is r-r-really embar-r-rassing.” She struggles to say, her voice shakey and soft but a dopey smile is plaster on her face. I hold her hand but she slips back onto the floor and lies with her thighs tightly squeezing together.<br />
<br />
“Oh umm she might be like that for a while. Pigs kind of have longer orgasms…” Connie says.<br />
<br />
“Whoa, really?” I ask sounding a little more interested than I’d have liked to. Connie tells me about half an hour and I can’t help but be intrigued.<br />
<br />
Maedel just moans and bucks her hips as waves of serotonin and endorphins wash up from her nethers and splash exquisitely through her. She squeezes my hand tightly.<br />
<br />
“We need to go inform the Captain of his extra passengers before we’re found and thrown overboard as stowaways.” Hazel says and looks at Andrew, “We might need someone to swing a sword around and since you’ve fucked Maedel silly...” <br />
<br />
He nods, guiltily and quickly finishes changing.<br />
<br />
“I suppose I’ll take care of her here while you make yourself at home below deck.” I sigh as I look down at Maedels blissful face and tease her that her tanned skin and flushed face look the exact same shade as the pig she’d been not long before. Her comeback is lost as she moans and writhes on the floor.<br />
<br />
“You dirty, piggy.” I wink at her.<br />
<br />
------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
The last rays of sunshine disappear beneath the ocean waves and no sooner than the sunk sank, a black tendril reached up out of the ocean and secured itself to The Gentle Lovers hull. Another tendril rose and reached higher, pulling a black mass out of the ocean with it followed by yet more lengthy onyx limbs. Soon the creature was silently scaling the stern of our vessel. The sea witches yellow eyes lit up in anticipation as she reached the ornate stern gallery and peered through the windows into the Captain Quarters. It was nearly time for her to reveal herself.</p>
