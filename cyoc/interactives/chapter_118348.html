<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The arrival at the center where they had been for the official welcome to the Skulk was fairly quiet, though William also found that it was a far busier place tonight than it was then. That made some sense. The official welcome for him and Martha, as well as Harry and Jenny had likely been done because of the circumstances in which they became werefoxes. There were probably many that didn&#39;t come because it wasn&#39;t a major meeting and had already apologized for Yvette Smith&#39;s actions. This was an official meeting and would include most, if not all of Moon Lake&#39;s werefoxes, and only those who had very good reasons not being there. Still William gave a small whistle at the number of cars that were parked there.<br />
<br />
&quot;There are a lot of cars here,&quot; William said when he noticed Martha looking at him.<br />
<br />
&quot;And practically all of them werefoxes,&quot; Martha commented, &quot;Though... I wonder... how many might be only honorary members, like me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Probably a fair number,&quot; William commented, &quot;I think that&#39;s partly why Professor McCall wanted to talk after the meeting. Her husband is a male werecat. She thought you and he would have a lot to talk about.&quot;<br />
<br />
They then made their way into the building and into the large room where the welcoming ceremony had been held. As they entered they found the room packed. There were large round tables with chairs surrounding them that filled the room. Each table had a large card with their respective dens written on them, allowing William and Martha to know where to go. They also noticed that nearly all the weres there were transformed already. Most of them were obviously werefoxes like William and were of some variation of the Red Fox&#39;s color phases, mostly the traditional red. William noted Jenny and Harry seated at one table, with many of the werefoxes at their den eagerly talking to them and he saw a good reason. Harry was a Gray Fox with largely grayish silver fur with tan points. Even more surprising was that Jenny was a Fennec Fox, with largely cream colored fur a shorter but still pointed muzzle and huge ears. It was something that William didn&#39;t expect, but she did look good and happy which made William feel good. Martha noted that there were a few non-werefoxes were also transformed, though all of them were also the smaller weres with nothing bigger than a weredog. There were no transformed werewolves or anything larger. She figured that since everyone was also fully clothed at the moment, that people who were larger weres weren&#39;t transformed for the sake of modesty at the Skulk&#39;s meeting.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, you two!&quot; came a voice from behind them making both of them making William and Martha turn.<br />
<br />
They found Dawn and Douglas Hale both transformed and standing there quietly holding a couple of drinks. Dawn with her traditional Red Fox coloration, like William&#39;s, stood in contrast to her husband&#39;s silver color phase. But both looked good as memories of the fun they had had the weekend after the welcome ceremony.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello, Dawn, Douglas,&quot; Martha said politely to them with a small smile forming.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aren&#39;t you two a bit under furred?&quot; Douglas teased with a small smile.<br />
<br />
Martha glanced to William, and both of them only chuckled as it was clear that Douglas was only joking. They then turned back and soon felt the now familiar and pleasurable feeling of their bodies shifting from their human appearance their were forms. The were forced to discard their shoes and socks as their feet lengthened into digitgrade paws, but that was easy enough and Martha also noted that there were shoes and socks under the chairs of those already transformed.<br />
<br />
&quot;We can obviously fix that,&quot; William answered as his eyes changed from brown to red in color and having to reach behind him to lower his pants and underwear enough so that his long brush like tail had room to grow. He glanced over to Martha and watched as his wife&#39;s brown furred cat tail grew out behind her and out through a fold opening in her own pants, clearly something she had purchased at the store &quot;Awareness&quot; that could shift with her. They hadn&#39;t had time yet for William to go there, but he figured that as some of the other events going on quieted down, he and Martha would get the time some weekend to do so.<br />
<br />
Dawn and Douglas only smiled back as William and Martha transformed into their were forms, a traditional male Red Fox werefox and a Havana Brown werecat. As their muzzles finished pushing out to complete their transformation, William and Martha both smiled back to Dawn and Douglas. It may have been something they were nervous over when they first moved to Moon Lake and Samantha Twist told the Anderson family about the town&#39;s mandatory were law, as from an outside perspective it looked at the very least uncomfortable and the result was something clearly not human. But now, neither had any reservations. Their minds were still functional in either form and the transformation itself felt pleasurable in its own right. About the only reason they&#39;d personally feel was needed to transform back was only to feel their transformation kick in again.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s better,&quot; Dawn gave a smile and came forward to give Martha a hug while Douglas and William settled for shaking hands, &quot;You&#39;re just in time as the start of the meeting isn&#39;t too far away.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Glad to be on time,&quot; William answered with a nod as he and Martha moved to follow Douglas and Dawn to the table with the words &quot;Wood Street&quot; written on it, &quot;As... I really don&#39;t know on how much I can really contribute, as this is a first for me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s okay,&quot; Douglas answered as they all sat down together with two chairs open next to the two Douglas and Dawn sat down at. William and Martha set their shoes and socks down under their chairs as they sat down while Douglas continued, &quot;We generally discuss plans for the upcoming holiday, what sort of pranks and tricks are to be acceptable and so on. How much of that we get into at this meeting will depend on how much time is spent on security issues for the wedding tomorrow. You&#39;ll catch on pretty easy.&quot;<br />
<br />
William and Martha both shrugged and were about to turn to fully introduce themselves to the other werefoxes at their den&#39;s table when a wooden banging, like a gavel hitting another wooden surface, was heard, officially announcing the start of the meeting. It turned all heads to one table with the card reading &quot;Skulk&#39;s Den&quot; on it. There, sat Akane with various werefoxes around her, many of which likely either her children or grandchildren. Akane no Tachibana looked to all of the gathered dens gave a small smile and set the gavel down as she stood up to start the meeting and move onto finishing up old business from the Skulk&#39;s last meeting and then onto new business for the present meeting.</p>
