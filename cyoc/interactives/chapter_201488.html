<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jen woke up, face still buried in her breasts, but something felt off, they felt, softer. As she woke up more, still laying face in the massive bust that was now hers things started to come to her, she didn&#39;t have implants, since she wasn&#39;t legal age for it until recently, she was just rather blessed. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well at least these aren&#39;t fake tits...&quot; She muttered to herself, rolling onto her back &quot;.... still fucking heavy though.&quot; She looked down and saw them resting naturally, &quot;At least they don&#39;t look so huge now.&quot;  Then it hit her and Jen nearly shouted with glee. Her plan had worked, the curse had altered reality so she had always been naturally busty, and given her now former aunt the same treatment, so when she begged, no, demanded that her uncle Ben pay for an augmentation, they had several arguments over her being greedy and he finally had said enough and divorced the bitch. Jen couldn&#39;t help but be exicted, she helped her uncle out of a bad marriage and gotten the gold digger out of the family. <br />
<br />
&quot;Wait.... who&#39;s Aunt Robin?&quot; Jen smirked. As it turned out, her uncle had dated shortly there after and met a beautiful woman named Robin, who instantly hit it off with the entire family. Jen knew that she would be at tomorrows cook out, and instantly decided to go, she called up her friends and let them know that she was cancelling to be with family. They were bummed out but were glad that she wanted to go. Now Jen elated with all of this, decided that there was someone she needed to visit, she pulled up her call records on her cellphone and started searching a certain number.<br />
<br />
----------------<br />
<br />
Jen had no trouble finding the adress she wanted, it wasn&#39;t to hard to find him after all, Kyle was active in certain circles on the internet, and easily tracible. She walked up the sidewalk to the place he called home, a small one story bungalow on the east side of town, it was a nice enough neighborhood, obviously not as influentual as where she was from, but still nice. Jen wondered what kind of family Kyle had, he seemed like the reclusive and abused type, her imagination whirled with ideas, maybe his family was broken, an drunken dad, an abused mother, siblings who bullied him, all this went on as she knocked at the door. <br />
<br />
A brown haired woman answered the door, she was 5&#39;4&quot;, brunette, and petite. Her features plain, framed by thick brimmed glasses and straighted hair, she wasn&#39;t busty, but she still had a noticable figure.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello?&quot; She seemed shocked by the blonde busty goddess that stood on her doorstep.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi... I&#39;m Jennifer Smith, I was wondering, is this where I can find Kyle Perkins?&quot; Jen asked in her kindest voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh.. I&#39;ll go get him.&quot; The woman said, she walked a little further into the house and shouted, &quot;Kyle! There&#39;s a Jennifer Smith here to see you!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;WHAT???&quot; Kyle could be heard shouting, she could hear him running down the stairs and nearly tripping, as he rushed down she could hear what was obviously his mom asking &quot;Is she you secret girlfriend or something?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;No, uh just someone I know from school.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You should ask her out, she&#39;s very pretty.&quot; Jen chuckled at this, if only she knew what she had planned. Kyle came to the door and closed it, then turned around and stopped wide eyed with shock.<br />
<br />
&quot;Like what you see Kyle?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How? How the fuck do you keep winning with this curse?&quot; Kyle wasn&#39;t pleased, he paused and looked at her pointedly &quot;I swear to God if you did anything to my mom I will end you. She hasn&#39;t got anything to do with...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hold on, hold on....&quot; Jen was nearly laughing &quot;I didn&#39;t do anything to your mom, let me explain...&quot;<br />
<br />
-------------<br />
<br />
&quot;So, you took out an abusive aunt with that curse....&quot; Kyle said barely able to keep eye contact, &quot;.... and turned into a goddess. I expected something far worse, or at least horrible.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, when I first got these they were implants, but the curse kinda changed that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh.&quot; Kyle seemed disappointed that his schemes hadn&#39;t worked. &quot;I see.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So, let me ask you again. Like what you see?&quot; Jen looked at him with mock lust. Kyle just stared at her and spat, &quot;Just do it, take your vengence and leave.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, Transform or dare?&quot; Jen asked, Kyle sighed &quot;Transform.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good, so... you may have been trying to screw me over this entire time, buuuut, you actually helped me help my uncle, he&#39;s a sweet guy, he didn&#39;t deserve the way she treated him, so I&#39;m going to do you a favor. For you transformation, you are going to change into...&quot; Kyle winced, &quot;....what you think the ideal male body is.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Wait what?&quot; Kyle asked stunned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, it&#39;s all worked out for me...&quot; Jen said, Kyle started feeling hot. &quot;...so I figured it should work out for you, since it all fell into place, you deserve a reward.&quot; Kyle for his part panicked a little as he felt his body start to swell, he looked at Jen, why had she done this, he was nothing but an asshole to her, he felt the heat of expanding muscle growing on his frame, he gained a foot in height, still being shorter than Jen&#39;s new form, he gained more definition as his frame filled out, he wasn&#39;t ready for the sensation of his cock suddenly stiffining and growing bigger.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ooooo, I wonder how big the little guy there is going to get.&quot; Jen said, smiling at him, he was about to say something when he heard a pop, his cock tore free of his pants, shoving through the zipper and stopping at a full ten inches stiff. Kyle felt the heat of his sudden expansion subside, if he could see himself he would see that his muscle wasn&#39;t huge, but definitly defined, his body now ripped, in ways he never imagined it would be. Jen for her part enjoyed the show, even getting a little turned on by it. Kyle looked over himself, and then back at her.<br />
<br />
&quot;So...&quot; Jen cooed to him. &quot;...are you gonna aske me out, stud?&quot;</p>
