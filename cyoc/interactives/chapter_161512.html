<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">With a gasp, Tiffany woke up. She had slept next to Mitch after dinner, she told the farmers that Mitch was so tired and she didn&#39;t want to wake up him. Then she had snuck into the hay and passed out next to him.<br />
<br />
Oh, his furry body. Oh, his muscular legs. Oh, his thick strong tail. It was exactly what she wanted right now. All of it, not just for him, but for herself.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, a black and white creature appeared.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s you!&quot; Tiffany exclaimed. &quot;You&#39;re back! I wanted to say I am sorry!&quot;<br />
<br />
Adomm didn&#39;t respond. The spirit sat in the rafters, focused keenly on a spool of thread. The end strings trailed off through the air just behind Tiffany, out to the middle of the hallway.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm?&quot; Tiffany knew that those threads meant that the creature was doing some sort of magic. <br />
<br />
Mitch was there, suspended five feet in the air, a long vine wrapped his mouth. His eyes were bugging out, practically oozing with fear.<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you doing to him!?&quot; Tiffany screamed. &quot;Stop, you&#39;re hurting him! What did he do!?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He wouldn&#39;t hold still.&quot; She said while he was still squirming.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait...he&#39;s not in pain...he&#39;s just afraid.&quot; Tiffany realized. &quot;Mitch, it&#39;s ok! Stop struggling!&quot; She pleased. &quot;I know this creature, she isn&#39;t going to hurt you! She&#39;s an artist not a killer!&quot;<br />
<br />
Tiffany rubbed his hoof. &quot;I know she seems bad, but she&#39;s magic...we don&#39;t understand magic, she knows more than us, we just need to trust her.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tiffany began to flatter her &quot;I&#39;m so glad that you come back. I think you are an amazing creature! You&#39;re magic! I did a lot of thinking after you left me, and realized how foolish I had been.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Quiet.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;... I&#39;m glad, actually.&quot; she muttered aloud, looking up at Mitch, still bound, &quot;For a while I thought I would not get any results from this little experiment.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tiffany stayed obediently silent, watching with amazment as more of the beautiful blossoms came from her magic. It was like something out of a fairy tale!<br />
<br />
&quot;See, originally, you were supposed to be transformed entirely into a donkey on the island. You would be sold off in the mortal realm to pay off expenses and damages to the island. Then, a new batch of folks are hunted and taken in, the are transformed and we repeat.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And, occasionally I choose some boys and girls, and I stop their transformation to... shall we say, have a little fun. This time, I did a simple experiment: instead of manipulating you manually, I  make you do it yourselves.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tiffany stayed silent, having not been given permission to speak.  She looked at mitch and rubbed his hooves again, trying to give him a look that said it was going to be ok. Tiffany motioned for Mitch to stay silent. <br />
<br />
Mitch had no idea what to think. How was Tiffany so excited? This was the most terrifying thing he has ever seen.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, a wealth of joy and relief exploded in his body, making him feel warm and wonderful. This WAS the same creature! Oh, how lucky were they! He was going to get turned back into a human!<br />
<br />
Tiffany saw the look of hope on Mitch&#39;s face, and frowned at him, shaking her head at him to not go there. She rubbed his ankles gently.<br />
<br />
&quot;At your age, the tranformation doesn&#39;t just... flow. We need at least 10 years old kids for it&quot; she said to Mitch, &quot;Had I left you in the island, you would have still walked on two legs, your snout would have barely developed... you wouldn&#39;t even have foreleg hooves. Maybe your air would grow and your fingernails would darken, but that&#39;s it.&quot;<br />
<br />
She reeled back a bit from the thought, floating backwards, &quot;Ugh. Hideous.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You mean he wouldn&#39;t become a cute little donkey like the ones we saw on the island?&quot; Tiffany asked, surprising herself.<br />
<br />
&quot;No.&quot; Adomm replied, &quot;He would have become a humanoid donkey. Not nearly as desirable, I imagine.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;MMM?&quot; Mitch said in shock. He didn&#39;t want to believe it.<br />
<br />
&quot;I have some work to do.&quot; Adomm sighed, &quot;... but not before I finish with you two...&quot;<br />
<br />
Tiffany turned back to her eyes wide. &quot;Finish with US??? You mean...me too?&quot; She asked trying to hide the hope in her voice.<br />
<br />
Adomm turned to Tiffany. &quot;I can tell by your behavoir that you regret our past deal. On this new deal that I propose you, you will have whatever you want... and nothing in return.&quot;<br />
<br />
She looked up at Mitch, and then Tiffany. &quot;I will grant you each one a last request.&quot; she said, &quot;One form change, partial or complete.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I want to be a Jenny ass.&quot; Tiffany said without hesitation. &quot;I want to slowly transform into a cute little jenny.&quot; Mitch&#39;s mouth dropped open.<br />
<br />
At least, he would&#39;ve if it were not already caught in a thick vine.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, you have thought about it.&quot; Adomm smiled, &quot;Well, that keeps things simple.&quot;<br />
<br />
She turned to Mitch, &quot;And how about you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;MMMM MMMMPH MMM!&quot; Mitch said, struggling.<br />
<br />
Tiffany rubbed his furry ankles with a giggle, and ran her fingers over his smooth hooves. &quot;He&#39;s excited!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Indeed.&quot; said Adomm. The vine gag did not recede.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mmm? MMM MMMMMM MMMM MMMM!&quot; Mitch struggled, unable to get a coherant word out.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve been trying to explain to him how his donkey parts were a gift, how they made him unique..he just wanted to get back home...kind of like I did before i met you.&quot; said Tiffany.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, I should probably mention that I do not CARE.&quot; Adomm said, cutting her off, &quot;Your request now, please, Mitch.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh he surely wants to be a cute little jackass with me! I&#39;m sure of it!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;MMMMPH?!?!&quot; Mitch hummed in horror. If he was not scared of Adomm before, he was absolutely petrified now.<br />
<br />
&quot;MMMM! MMMMM!&quot; he protested.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, you are not allowed to speak.&quot; Adomm pointed a finger at Mitch, &quot;Accept it as punishment for not listening the first, second, and THIRD time...&quot;<br />
<br />
Adomm&#39;s eyes narrowed as she looked at Tiffany, her white light pulsing brighter.<br />
<br />
&quot;But not worry.&quot; she smiled, &quot;I&#39;m sure your beloved friend knows exactly what you want.&quot;<br />
<br />
She floated closer to Tiffany, and the air grew colder.<br />
<br />
&quot;Choose carefully now.&quot; she said, her face deadly serious, &quot;You will NOT see me again, I promise you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He wants to be a cute little donkey with me! He wants to have fun with our bodies slowly changing into that of carefree little animals!&quot; said again Tiffany.<br />
<br />
&quot;MMMMMMMPH!&quot; Mitch screamed. The vines made loud creaking noises as he struggled with every ounce of muscle as he could.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I do hope you are correct.&quot; Adomm said somberly, looking over the spool casually, &quot;If you are wrong, I daresay he may react rather violently. You might have to convince him that this is indeed the correct choice.&quot; She said smiling.<br />
<br />
Adomm looked Tiffany in the eyes. Her colors inverted and the green glow from the pods vanished.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you absolutely sure this is what you BOTH want?&quot; she asked slowly and powerfully.<br />
<br />
&quot;MMMMMMMMMMMPH!&quot;<br />
<br />
She thought hard. &quot;I want it. I want it with every part of my being.&quot; She looked at Mitch&#39;s terrified look. &quot;But....&quot; She took a deep breath. &quot;Mitch doesn&#39;t. He wants to choose for himself. I want him to choose me. I want him to choose being a donkey.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But he has to make that choice, otherwise he won&#39;t be happy...please..let him talk, and let him choose for himself...I can convince him.&quot;</p>
