<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Hearing Jeff&#39;s voice die instantly and only hearing the music from the radio after confirming the new settings, Dean smiles wide, “let&#39;s see if the radio turns itself back on when I turn it off”. Dean presses the radio&#39;s power button and waits a while, the minutes tick by and the radio does not turn back on, Dean smiles, “no more malfunctioning radio,” he says, “saved some cash there. Once I am home, I&#39;ll check the internet and see if I can&#39;t find an digital assistant for my car”.<br />
<br />
Jeff is shocked and is panicking, he tries and tries to turn on the radio but he cant seem to be able to do it anymore. The former teen even realizes that, for some reason he has lost the ability or knowledge to speak, he can still think like before, &#39;what is going on? I can&#39;t seem to remember my name. I know I should be a human, that I have family and a home, but I also know that I am a car, manufactured in Europe. I am so confused,&#39; he asks himself, &#39;I feel so strange and Dean is acting so weird&#39;.<br />
<br />
Dean smiles as he drives his “car” through the town, “I still can&#39;t believe that my first car is a Skoda Superb Sportline,” the teen says to himself, “and I didn&#39;t even had to pay a penny, this is the best birthday present I have ever received”. The teen acts as if his awareness is unchecked, he remembers Jeff turning into the car, but he is so excited to have his dream car, that he simply pushes “Jeff the human” into the farthest and darkest corner of his memories, for Dean Jeff is nothing but a car and always will be.<br />
<br />
After driving for a while, Dean hears a beeping and notices the control lamp for the fuel light up. “Almost empty already,” he asks himself, “man, I wish the former owner would have filled her up. Oh well, I&#39;ve got enough cash to fill up this beauty, then I&#39;ll drive home”. Dean drives to the nearest gas station and fills his car up with high quality fuel, then he sets off again towards his home. As Dean is driving down the side street near his house, he suddenly remembers something, he parks his “car” on the side and opens the chronivac app on his phone. “I hope it is strong enough to scan for my family,” the boy mumbles to himself, he then presses the scan button and waits. After after a few minutes the app pings and Dean smiles as he sees all of his family members listed:<br />

<br />
Dean turns on the awareness of his family and adds “...of car, owner Dean Smith” to it, “now they should be aware that I own a car,” the teen says with a smile. Satisfied for now, Dean drives the rest of the way and pulls on to the driveway of his family home.<br />
<br />
The front door of the house opens, just as Dean shuts off the car, sending Jeff into sleep-mode, and his brother, mother and father all walk out onto the driveway.<br />
<br />
“So, how was you test drive,” Mike asks, “did you enjoy your gift”?<br />
<br />
Dean smiles, “I sure have,” he says, “I still do not understand why you gave me one of the most expensive cars as a first car”.<br />
<br />
His parents smile at each other, “you simply deserved it,” his mother says, “we saw how hard you learned for achieving your driver&#39;s license”.<br />
<br />
“Plus, you are a great driver,” his dad adds, “so we thought we&#39;d rather gift you with a proper car, than some trash”.<br />
<br />
Dean grins inwardly, &#39;works like a charm,&#39; he says, the only one, who knows the truth, &#39;maybe not the only one. My car might also still know the truth... but I&#39;ll fix that soon enough&#39;. The teen looks at his parents, “there is one thing I find weird”.<br />
<br />
“What is that,” Mike asks.<br />
<br />
“Well, the car hasn&#39;t got an digital assistant,” Dean says, “I wanted to check the internet to see if I can download the DA for a Skoda Superb Sportline”.<br />
<br />
Dean&#39;s dad thinks for a while, “I have an idea,” he says, “since tomorrow is Saturday, we could head to my chop-shop. We could run a full diagnostic and download the newest software which should include an DA”.<br />
<br />
Dean smiles wide, “that would be cool,” he says.<br />
<br />
“Can I come too,” Todd asks, after being silent for so long.<br />
<br />
Dean looks at his baby brother, “why do you want to tag along”?<br />
<br />
“Um... I just would love to drive with you in your new car,” the young boy says.<br />
<br />
Dean shrugs, “well... okay, why not,” he says with a smile.<br />
<br />
“Yay,” Todd says.<br />
<br />
Dean chuckles, he then looks up at his father, “um... dad, since it is not to late,” he starts, “couldn&#39;t we go now”?<br />
<br />
“YES, PLEASE,” Todd squeals.<br />
<br />
Mike thinks for a while, he looks at his wife, “it shouldn&#39;t take to long,” he says.<br />
<br />
Ashley smiles, “it&#39;s okay,” she says, “you boys go and have fun, you could bring back some takeaway when you are done”.<br />
<br />
Mike nods, “okay Dean, let&#39;s hop into your car and drive to my chop-shop,” so all three get into the “car” and Dean starts the engine.<br />
<br />
Being suddenly jerked out of sleep, Jeff feels extremely confused, &#39;w-where am I,&#39; he asks himself. He then feels his tires starting to move, &#39;h-hu... wh-where is my owner... why does that sound and feel so wrong... taking me? And who are those other two people&#39;?<br />
<br />
After driving for about an hour, they arrive at Mike&#39;s chop-shop, Mike uses his key card to open the garage and Dean drives the car inside. The garage door closes right behind them as Dean parks his “car” on a free spot. He turns off the engine and steps out, “okay dad, what should we do first”?<br />
<br />
“Well, first we should run a diagnostic,” the boy&#39;s dad says, “if that is done, and no issues come up, we&#39;ll attach the car&#39;s computer to the interface and download the newest software”.<br />
<br />
Dean nods, “sounds good,” he says, “I just hope... if there ARE issues that it won&#39;t take to long to fix them”.<br />
<br />
Mike is already attaching a cable to the “car&#39;s” interface, after popping the hood, “it&#39;ll be fine,” he says.<br />
<br />
Jeff is semi-aware of what is going on, he is in a half-awake state, he feels strange, as if hands where rummaging through his brain.<br />
<br />
After an hour the computer, to which Jeff is attached, pings and Mike looks at the results, “hm... strange,” he says.<br />
<br />
Dean, panicking a little, hopes his father hasn&#39;t noticed the “human” features in the “car&#39;s” memory.<br />
<br />
“There is a program called the “Chronivac” on the car&#39;s computer. I never heard of such an program, we should probably better delete it, it could be a bug,” Mike says.<br />
<br />
Dean smirks inwardly, “ye-yeah... that probably would be best,” he says, &#39;I wonder what will happen if Jeff is no longer connected to HIS Chronivac. I just hope the copy I got on my phone stays,&#39; the teen thinks to himself. “Are there other issues,” he then asks his dad.<br />
<br />
Mike nods, “there are some weird details, this type of car has been only around since a year... why is there a 16 next to the age box? What is this folder labeled “memories”? And this one... this looks to human for a car... this is really weird and confusing”.<br />
<br />
Dean starts to panic again, but relaxes at his dad&#39;s next sentence.<br />
<br />
Mike just shrugs, “the newest software will solve those issues by either deleting them or moving them some place else on the car&#39;s computer, where unimportant files are stored”.<br />
<br />
Before Mike connects Dean&#39;s “car” to the interface, he deletes the “Chronivac” from the car&#39;s computer. Dean hears a ping coming from his phone, he turns around, so his dad and brother would not notice. He then takes out his phone and looks at the message, a evil smirk appears on his face, the message reads: “WARNING: lost conection to subject! Copy of Chronivac connected to Dean Smith is now the main Chronivac. Only owner of subject may fix the errors and transform subject back. ERROR FIXED!”.<br />
<br />
“Hu... that&#39;s weird,” Deans dad says.<br />
<br />
Dean quickly puts his phone away, “what is it, dad,” he asks.<br />
<br />
Mike scratches the back of his head, “when I deleted this... Chronivac thingy... all other folders, like the “memories”, the one that looked to human and even the age have disappeared”.<br />
<br />
Dean grins as he understands, &#39;looks like when the Chronivac noticed losing the conection to the subject, it automatically chose the best thing to fix the error, namely changing the copy that exists into the main and only file,&#39; the boy thinks to himself, &#39;and since I AM the one with THAT said copy... I now have the real Chronivac on my phone... so cool&#39;.<br />
<br />
“Oh, well,” Mike says, “I guess those issues are solved”.<br />
<br />
Jeff meanwhile feels that he had lost the connection to something very important, but he seems unable to put his finger on it.<br />
<br />
“Okay dad,” Dean says, “let&#39;s get this software downloaded and installed”.<br />
<br />
Mike nods and connects Jeff&#39;s in-car computer to the interface, Jeff feels a new sensation, he feels as if his mind is running a marathon as it becomes a computer-slave. Soon he finds the software and starts to download and install it.<br />
<br />
After a while Mike&#39;s work computer pings and a message appears, it reads, “DA-system “Laura” found. Car seems not to have “Laura”, do you wish to install it now?”.<br />
<br />
“So, “Laura” is the standard digital assistant program for all Skoda models,” Mike says, “you can even name it differently and even set it to great you when you open the door and even say goodbye when leaving the car”.<br />
<br />
Dean smiles, “perfect,” he says, “install it, dad”.<br />
<br />
Mike nods and clicks on the install button, Jeff suddenly feels strange, &#39;wh-why am I starting to feel feminine,&#39; he asks himself, &#39;m-my name isn&#39;t L-Laura... it... it... damn... what is my name?! And why do I su-suddenly feel so y-young?!&#39;.<br />
<br />
“Do you want to name the system differently,” Mike asks.<br />
<br />
Dean thinks for a while, “Laura does sound boring,” he says, he looks over at his car, “maybe “Jess” or “Jane”? I don&#39;t know, I need to think of a suitable name”.<br />
<br />
Mike nods, “okay, when you have found the name you want, we can change it anytime”.<br />
<br />
After an hour the software finishes installing, “let&#39;s see if it worked,” Dean says. The teen opens the car and a young female voice, which sounds like the voice of a little girl, suddenly can be heard saying, “welcome, master”.<br />
<br />
“You can change the greating-message to your liking,” Mike says, “she sounds extremely young”.<br />
<br />
Dean thinks, hearing his car call him “master” sends a pleasurable shiver through his body, “nah... master is good,” he says, “but “master Dean” does sound cooler”.<br />
<br />
Mike nods and types, “done, she&#39;ll say the same when you leave the car,” he says.<br />
<br />
“Sweet,” Dean says.<br />
<br />
Mike then shows and explains to Dean how to edit and change the DA&#39;s settings on the in-car computer.<br />
<br />
“That... was interesting,” they hear a voice say, they turn to see a bored looking Todd.<br />
<br />
Mike chuckles, “sorry son,” he says, “we are finished, so let&#39;s go grab some pizza and head home”.</p>
