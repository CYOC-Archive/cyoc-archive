<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“I saw Casey Morgan. I’m surprised you wanted to see this, not every girl would be down to see an R-rated indie film for the first date.” Mason commented with a smile. “But if you’re into arthouse films I might just have to marry you.”<br />
<br />
It was at those words that Janette decided she would like this film, no matter how raunchy or sex crazed it was. If she was into it Mason would legitimately think about marrying her.<br />
<br />
They picked up concessions, wandered into theatre six, and sat down next to each other in a nearly empty theatre waiting for the movie to start. It was an indie flick so all the previews were weird and all the production logos were strange and unknown to Janette.<br />
<br />
But then it started, the movie she had to like for Mason to love her, and it started with a sex scene.<br />
<br />
Like full on nudity basically pornographic sex. Janette blushed from the roots of her hair down to her neck as she watched a saucy looking brunette get pounded by some nice hefty man meat. She felt flustered and awkward, gritting her teeth and feeling way outside her comfort zone. Sure she wanted to bang Mason like nothing else but watching a full on sex scene in theatres with her potential boyfriend wasn’t for her.<br />
<br />
“Focus,” she whispered to herself. “You’re going to love this film, Mason likes a girl into this sort of stuff so you become that girl.”<br />
<br />
She strained to focus, completely oblivious to the fact the neckline of her shirt was starting to dip, exposing more and more cleavage by the second.<br />
<br />
A little into the film the main character was arguing with her roommate, that roommate was pissed she’d had another guy over and if caught would get them both kicked out by their super religious landlady.<br />
<br />
“I guess the cinematography is good,” Janette admitted, eying the gorgeous way the shot was set up and actually appreciating it. Plus she liked the wardrobe, a little revealing and sexy, maybe watching something more risqué was a good thing.<br />
<br />
Her cleavage got deeper as her shirt got more revealing and her breasts grew larger, showing off a deep rift of boob to the air that would earn the stare of any guy and make her smile when their eyes followed. Her sleeves moved up until they vanished becoming simple straps holding her shirt in place. She shifted a little so her slightly larger ass was a bit more comfortable.<br />
<br />
She felt nothing but relatability while watching the lead character at work, her rocking body trapped in a frumpy uniform that did nothing for her figure. That woman’s arc was so good, all she wanted to do was be free sexually and yet the entire world kept trying to shame her.<br />
<br />
She began to feel somewhat horny, biting her lip while her hair shaved down to stubble on the left hand side of her head. Her mom hated that haircut but her mom had no say on how she loved her life. Her shirt rose upwards, her belly button becoming revealed while her jeans hugged her round ass perfectly. She shot a look at Mason and noticed that his crotch was rented by an erection. Seeing that turned her on.<br />
<br />
She kept control of her urges until another sex scene came on, Mason’s tent got larger and she was feeling good, so she slid off her chair and crawled in front of Mason much to his shock.<br />
<br />
“Janette?! Wait? What happened to you?” He demanded and she giggled, unsure what he was talking about.<br />
<br />
“Ready for a real experience?” She asked before unzipping his pants and freeing his erect cock from his boxers. He looked around all worried like they might be caught but she found that prospect kind of hot. She wrapped her lips around his cock and began to suck. Her lips slid up and down his member and he bit his lip suppressing a moan while watching the film.<br />
<br />
Piercings erupted on her skin, in her belly button, on her eyebrow, and all over her shaved down ear. The long portion of her hair got longer and started to take on a purple hue while her shoes rose into a slight heel.<br />
<br />
Mason eventually came in her mouth and she swallowed back his semon with a gulp and a giggle. By that point the lead had hooked up with her love interest and was riding him. Janette loved movies like that one, they always got her in the mood.<br />
<br />
“Janette, we really shouldn’t-“ Mason started but she just rolled her eyes and rose up, pulling her pants down and sitting on his lap, dick entering the folds of her vagina while she blocked his view of the movie with her breasts and began to ride him right in public in that theatre. Doing something so naughty made her so horny.<br />
<br />
Tattoos began to erupt on her skin in all the right places to make Mason’s dick stand at attention again. She rocked back and forth while her hair turned a deep purple colour, her shoes completed their transformation into heels, and a saucy smile crossed her face when a light shone on them and a theatre employee stared at them in shock. She came the second she was caught, finding the act so arousing she couldn’t help herself.<br />
<br />
Security shoved them outside the building and she grinned from ear to ear when that happened. Buzzkills, that’s what they were, unable to let a girl get a nice ride in public. It figured the people working at the theatre were a bunch of squares.<br />
<br />
“What happened to you?” Mason asked, staring at the girl next to him who looked like Janette combined with the type of woman he masturbated while watching porn of on the regular.<br />
<br />
“What do you mean?” Janette yawned, it was still so early and she had nothing planned for the rest of the night. The first date had ended before she could get Mason’s fine sperm all up in her vagina. “I love movies like that, they make me feel so good. Mmmm... Too bad they ruined everything. I think we might have to compensate...”<br />
<br />
She leaned towards Mason at that, pressing her deep cleavage into his arm and making him turn bright red and flustered.<br />
<br />
“C-compensate...” he whimpered and she licked her lips, turned on by his awkwardness.<br />
<br />
“Wanna do it in the parking lot?” She asked, hoping someone would catch a glimpse. Mason turned brighter red but she wasn’t hearing a no.</p>
