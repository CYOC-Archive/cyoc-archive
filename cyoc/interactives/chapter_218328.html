<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Lead Scientist: Dr. Cassandra Shaw<br />
Assisting: DT42 (Artificial Intelligence)<br />
Subject: RS-02, RS-03<br />
<br />
Project Goal: To continue the research started by RS-00 formerly Dr. Janice Smith. Studying the effects of  impregnation by a Riastrad affected entity. To insure that RS-02 and RS-03 remain in containment, and remain healthy.<br />
<br />
Initial Notes: Well, this is a right mess, at the time of writing this RS-00 and RS-01 are still unaccounted for, and their current condition is unfortunately unknown. Previously I recommend that Project Riastrad be abandoned, I had assumed that it was a dead end. To my predecessor&#39;s credit (despite the recklessness of her methods) I can&#39;t deny her results. That said I shall be refraining from using myself as a test subject moving forward. As for RS-02, she has thankfully been cooperative, RS-02 and RS-03 appear to be in good health. <br />
<br />
Project Description: Riastrad was discovered on 05/23/2018, in Ireland. In its natural form Riastrad is a herb, typically found in subterranean environments. Ingesting the herb has shown to give a temporary increase in strength and vitality at the cost of cognitive functions. In higher concentrations is was discovered that in had regenerative and mutagenic qualities. However, in previous experiments subjects exhibited undesirable mutations such as, Muscular hypertrophy, Leg Deformations, Organ Displacement (notably in the eyes), Heir Calcification, Tumor Like Growths, and other deformities. I had assumed this research was a dead end, and moved to terminate the project. To my surprise an independent scientist had continued my research, and despite their I&#39;ll advised methods, they had managed to produce remarkable results. However, the situation quickly grew out of control and I was put back on the project, do to my previous experience with the subject.<br />
                _____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________<br />

<br />
Report: Subject RS-03 appears to be experiencing cellular degradation. It seems that the subject requires an environment saturated with Riastrad to insure healthy development. Riastrad Serum injection is recommended to ensure RS-03&#39;s survival. RS-02 certainly shows no signs of mutation, however small traces of Riastrad have been detected.<br />
<br />
Note: Scans have shown that RS-03 is genetically similar to RS-00&#39;s mutated state. If their notes are anything to go by RS-00 had begun to produce Riastrad from their body. It appears that the serum has become a part of these entities biology, this is extremely fascinating I can&#39;t wait to see what a fully mutated specimen looks like. RS-02 has shown resistance to the idea of being exposed to further doses of the serum. However, after having the situation explained to her, she has reluctantly chosen to cooperate.<br />
                ______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________<br />
<br />
Date: 03/14/20**<br />
<br />
Report: RS-03&#39;s condition has improved, and they appear to be developing as expected. The bioluminescent neural tube has made its appearance emitting a turquoise light. RS-02 initially exhibited signs of distress upon being Injected with the serum, but has become more comfortable with the procedure over the last few days. Her health has also noticeably improved. <br />
<br />
Note: I have taken the liberty of improving upon the design of RS-00&#39;s insemination device, allowing me to better control the dosage, as well as improving its ability to evenly saturate The subject&#39;s womb with the serum. I have chosen to designate the device as the Gae Bolg, partly because it functions in a surprising similar manner to the mythological weapon.<br />
                _______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________<br />
<br />
Date: 03/21/20**<br />
<br />
Report: RS-03 is developing as anticipated, nothing notable to report. RS-02 has begun to experience mutations, her strength and senses have improved significantly. Her genitalia has changed slightly, the clitoris has grown 1mm, and the urethra has begun to expand. RS-02&#39;s libido has notably increased, no longer does she exhibit discomfort during the injection process. She even appears to enjoy it.<br />
<br />
Note: Who programmed DT42? I can understand the importance of having a differing opinion, but does it really need to be back sassing me all the time? This feels excessive.<br />
                ______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________<br />
<br />
Date: 03/28/20**<br />
<br />
Report: RS-03 has continued to develop as RS-00&#39;s voice logs have described. The tail has grown longer rather than recede, and the hands and feet are also developing as anticipated. RS-02 has experienced occasional discomfort due to the sifting of her internal organs. RS-02&#39;s reproductive organs have continued to mutate, no doubt progressing towards true hermaphrodism as decried by RS-00.<br />
<br />
Note: E... RS-02 has proven herself to be invaluable, despite her growing libido. Her medical experience as well as her knowledge of the experiment has been extremely helpful. <br />
<br />
Request: For RS-02&#39;s living quarters to be upgraded and made more comfortable. To help insure her continued cooperation and health. (Approved)<br />
                ____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________<br />

<br />
Report: RS-03 continues to develop as expected the second thumb has developed, as well as the digitigrade structure of the legs. RS-00 seems to have neglected to mention the structure of the feet, 3 primary digits as well as 2 opposing digits similar to the hands. RS-03 appears to be in good health, internal organs appear to be forming correctly. RS-02 is experiencing extreme pain as her muscles and bones are rapidly changing, I have chosen to administrator painkillers to help ease the transition. Bioluminescence has developed along RS-02&#39;s spine and eyes emitting a deep blue light. <br />
<br />
Note: Eli... RS-02 gave me quite the scare, I did not anticipate the pain to be quite that intense. I have to admit I admire RS-00&#39;s resilience for going through this process without painkillers. I find the development of bioluminescence intriguing, the original herb also displays this trait emitting a ghostly white light. It appears to be linked to the nervous system, I wonder if there&#39;s any significance to its location. I must also apologize for not noticing RS-02&#39;s change in eye color, to be fair it was not a significant change as her eyes were already blue. But I pride myself on being as thorough as possible.<br />
                _____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________<br />

<br />
Report: We are now in uncharted territory, do to the declining quality of RS-00&#39;s logs, much of her and RS-01&#39;s developments were left undocumented. The first of these undocumented developments to present itself is regarding RS-03&#39;s ears, or at least what I assume are ears. instead of the standard 2, 6 structures have begun to develop from the embryonic gill silts, and have slowly begun to shift further up the head. RS-02&#39;s skin pigmentation appears to be sifting to grey in some places, particularly near the spine. RS-02&#39;s genitals have almost finished their mutations, however, her new penis is not yet functional. RS-02 does not appear to be producing Riastrad as of yet, daily injections will continue until further notice. <br />
<br />
Note: I&#39;ve been doing some digging into some restricted documents, a dangerous pastime I know. But something has been bothering me about this whole situation. It appears that the Overseer Counsel were not initially aware of RS-00&#39;s research, or how she had obtained such dangerous materials, and of course my classified research. How very interesting.<br />
                _____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________<br />
<br />
Date: 04/18/20**<br />
<br />
Report: I have made an important discovery regarding Riastrad. For awhile now I&#39;ve been wondering why it has had such a profoundly different effect on RS-00 and RS-02 compared to previous experiments. Riastrad appears to be interacting with their pregnancy hormones, causing far more preferable mutations. This will require more research to confirm. RS-03 has largely continued to develop as expected, the &quot;ears&quot; have moved to roughly what I assume is their final placement. 2 have stayed on either sides of the head where the ears would normally be. The last 2 organs have moved to the top of the head siting in the area of the temples. RS-02&#39;s body is now producing Riastrad, injection has been deemed unnecessary until further notice. Her reproductive organs are now completely functional and exhibits bioluminescent properties. Her penis has grown to approximately 17cm, it doesn&#39;t posses a prominent &quot;head&quot; like a human&#39;s. RS-02&#39;s saft has a tapered tip with gill like rides on the sides, and 2 rows of spines run down the underside. RS-02&#39;s hands and feet have continued to shift accompanied by the growth of her tail.<br />
<br />
Note: Eilzabeth... I mean RS-02 has show an impressive level of restraint regarding her heightened libido in comparison to RS-00. However she is nonetheless having difficulties, it will be important to help alleviate her impulses moving forward. The recent discovery regarding Riastrad has me excited, I need to run some test to see if the hormones are truly the case for the more favorable mutations.<br />
<br />
Request: An additional test subject, preferably male (Approved). A shipment of pregnancy hormones (Approved).<br />
                ______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________<br />
<br />
Date: 04/25/20** <br />
<br />
Report: The new male test subject has arrived, I shall begin to inject the subject with the hormone treated Riastrad through the anis using the Gae Bolg. Subject will from this point forward be redesigned RS-04. RS-03 continues to develop, the organs that have been growing on their head have developed small growths on the underside. They seem to be gills, this will require more observations to confirm. As for RS-02, her body has almost finished sifting into its new configuration. She has been experiencing difficulties with hearing, upon examination it was discovered that her ears had begun to change. More than likely they are developing into the same kind of organs as RS-03&#39;s.<br />
<br />
Note: DT42 has been acting strangely as of late. They have been unusually quiet for the last few days, and they have been keeping a much closer eye on me. Something might have gone wrong, I may have to perform a system diagnostic. <br />
                ______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________<br />
<br />
Date: 04/27/20**<br />
<br />
Incident Report: DT42 had experienced a severe malfunction, becoming hostile and activating a full system lockdown. DT42 then initiated a previously unknown combat mode. Thankfully DT42 was eliminated by RS-02 displaying telekinetic capabilities.<br />
<br />
Note: Who the fuck gave DT42 combat capabilities? I&#39;d be dead right now if it wasn&#39;t for Eli... RS-02. Her display of telekinetic abilities came as a surprise to not only myself but to RS-02 as well. I wonder if RS-00 developed such capabilities. I will have to run some tests to see what the limits of her capabilities are. <br />
<br />
Request: A more simplified A.I. to replace DT42 (approved). A human assistant, preferably Emily Zarko (denied).<br />
                _______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________<br />
<br />
Date: 05/02/20**<br />
<br />
Report: Because of DT42&#39;s rampage things have been slow going. I have had limited time to run test as I&#39;ve largely been occupied with getting everything up and running again. RS-03 has reached a point in their development where any changes are going to be very minimal. That said, the organs growing on RS-03&#39;s head have been confirmed to be gills but also functions as ears. Thankfully this means that RS-02&#39;s hearing loss is only temporary. However, do to the complexity of the gills it will take awhile before her hearing returns. RS-04 has already begun to change, their skin has become softer, and they have begun to develop breast tissue. A pink ring has formed in RS-04&#39;s eyes, I wonder what decides the color, it appears to be genetic, but I have not been able to identify what gens are interacting to produce such a effect. <br />
<br />
Note: RS-02... you know what, fuck you her name is Elizabeth. She continues to amaze me with how she can stay so calm despite losing her hearing. She seems to have adapted to her new body fairly quickly, often taking advantage of her 6 foot long prehensile tail to reach things she normally couldn&#39;t. RS-04 has been difficult to work with as of late, DT42&#39;s attack as well as their own changes has made them desire to leave. However they quickly became cooperative when I reminded him of their status as a death roe inmate. <br />
                ______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________<br />
<br />
Date: 05/09/20**<br />
<br />
Report: The new A.I. has arrived, I took the liberty to do a thorough diagnostic before installing. To insure that there were no surprises hidden in their programming. RS-03 has continued to remain healthy, no major developments to report. It would appear that I&#39;ve neglected to document a number of Elizabeth&#39;s changes do to last week&#39;s &quot;excitement&quot;. Her skin has now completely adopted the grey pigmentation, their eyes have developed black sclera, and their pupils have become vertical slits. Her gills have almost finished developing and their hearing has begun to return. A few smaller changes have also begun to show themselves, Elizabeth&#39;s nails and teeth have begun to fall out scans indicate that they are being replaced with claws and new more predatory teeth. Her tongue has also begun to grow becoming tapered, and their nose has started to shrink. RS-04&#39;s genitalia has begun to change, the penis has grown and is slowly becoming tapered, and their balls have begun to reseed into their body. RS-04 has continued develop more feminine traits, their breasts have continued to grow, fat and muscle distribution has begun to shift, causing some discomfort. RS-04 has experienced a sharp increase in their libido that they have had great difficulty controlling. Elizabeth has decided to help RS-04 alleviate their desires. <br />
<br />
Note: I decided to investigate DT42&#39;s remains, I located a remote activation sensor. DT42&#39;s rampage was no accident, someone activated it&#39;s combat systems remotely. It look like the Overseer Consul is caching on to me. Janice please hurry, we&#39;re running out of time.<br />
                ____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________<br />
<br />
Date: 05/16/20**<br />
<br />
Report: Elizabeth&#39;s mutations appear to have largely finalized. Her nose has shrunk significantly now only slightly raised off the rest of her face, the nostrils have grown wide and narrow. Her mouth is now filled with rather terrifying teeth, and she has displayed a wide variety of vocalizations (largely accidentally). Her eyes have grown slightly larger, and their gills have fully finished developing. Testing has shown that they allow her to breath underwater, but their sense of hearing has proven to be more interesting. Her spatial awareness has improved greatly, and she even appears to be capable of echolocation. As for her telekinetic abilities, after long periods of testing Elisabeth was shown to be able to manipulate things in a large variety of ways. The biggest limitation of their ability is the amount of energy she requires to perform the desired action. For example moving a small ball requires minimal energy, and she can keep the ball aloft for a long period of time without growing tired. However, lifting something heavy like an anvil requires significantly more energy, causing her to tire out more quickly. As of yet Elizabeth has not shown any telepathic capabilities. RS-04 has continued to mutate as I had hoped, looking mostly feminine. There bones have begun to shift and restructure, I have begun to administer painkillers to help ease the their transition. Other notable changes have been the appearance of pink bioluminescence around the spine, as well as the grey pigmentation of the skin.<br />
<br />
Note: Damn it, why do I have to go and make things harder for myself? This would have been so much easier if I had just stayed professional. Why did I have to go and fall in love? She&#39;s beautiful, kind, and a lot stronger than I could ever be. It&#39;s time, I want to join her, I&#39;m going to start injecting myself with the improved Riastrad. <br />
                ___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________<br />
<br />
Date: 05/19/20**<br />
<br />
Note: I finally picked up Janice&#39;s signal, they finally reached my hideout. It&#39;s time for us to leave, thankfully I&#39;ve already prepared an escape route, getting out of this facility should not be difficult. I shall begin preparations immediately. I told Elizabeth everything, my plans, the fact that I&#39;m now taking Riastrad, I even told her about my feelings for her. She kissed me! I was wrong, my love for her doesn&#39;t complicate things at all. She has decided to name her daughter Eve, I like it.<br />
                ______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________<br />
<br />
Final Note: If you are reading this, than you have no doubt surmised that it was me who provided Dr. Janice Smith with my research. I did not advise her experiments, but her results exceeded my expectations. I did advise her to go to a hideout that I&#39;ve been setting up for decades, if anything went wrong. As I had hoped you reached out to me to finish her work, do to my past experience. I new from the very beginning the potential Riastrad could unlock. I only moved to discontinue the project to keep it out of your hands. But now, I realized that I don&#39;t need to, anyone you put on this project is going to realize what I have. You idiots only care about weapons, but Riastrad is so much more than that. It&#39;s the next stage in our evolution, and I for one shall eagerly embrace it. <br />
<br />
Conclusion: Project Riastrad is to be discontinued until further notice. RS-02 - RS-05 have not been located, Dr. Emily Zarko has also been declared missing, DR. Zarko shall now be redesigned RS-06. Operation Medusa shall now commence. Operation goals: to locate and eliminate RS-00 - RS-06. Overseer Hector Von Zarko of the Balor Consortium has stepped up to head the operation.</p>
