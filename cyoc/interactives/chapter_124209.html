<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You both decide to keep on exploring the funhouse. Oddly enough the sense of urgency to get out of this place seems to have faded. You realise that it&#39;s not so bad. After all you even made a friend and you both now had tails to match. You could see that Max felt the same way. He smiled as he walked, his donkey tail swinging around. He loves his tail just as much as you love yours.<br />
<br />
Eventually you reach a wide room with a giant maze made of thick and dark hedges. For a second you wonder how they managed to create a plant maze inside a building but soon enough you forget about it. It&#39;s just easier to accept it.<br />
<br />
“A maze? This can&#39;t be that difficult” Max said.<br />
<br />
In fact it wasn&#39;t. You walked side by side using the trick of turning right at every turn. But as you moved on the path became narrower. Eventually only one person could pass at a time and so you headed first through the narrow hedges, Max right behind you.<br />
<br />
“Ouch!” Max complained at one point.<br />
<br />
“What is it?” you asked. “It&#39;s the branches. My shirt keeps getting tangled in them” he said and it was true. His shirt already had some rips from having to pull it from the hedge. The path forward was even narrower and at one point the branches were constantly scraping your pants. You both considered going back but then you noticed the path behind you was just as narrow as the one ahead and so you walked forward.<br />
<br />
After a short while Max had fallen a bit behind. His shirt and pants were getting caught on the branches at every step. It seemed that the branches were only “attacking” the clothes. Your face, torso and arms had been spared. Max&#39;s torso was constantly getting caught on the branches but you also noticed that there were no cuts and scratches on his skin. That was it! They were just attacking the clothes. You consider taking them off but suddenly you remember the voice earlier “Animals don&#39;t wear clothes”. Was this a way to force you to give up clothing? The growing animal part of you wishes to get rid of them and despite any moral restraints you had the constant irritation of getting caught in the branches was forcing you to side with it.<br />
<br />
As you remove the last branch from your trousers you diced to take them off and your underwear too. By now they were mostly torn anyway. You step forward now completely naked and fearfully expecting the branches to keep poking you. But they don&#39;t. In fact they seemingly caress your brown fur patches, which begin to spread through your skin.<br />
<br />
“Haaaey Max!” you brayed involuntarily. “Take off your clothes.”<br />
<br />
“What? Why?” Max replied as he pulled his shirt off a branch, giving an annoyed bray. He then notices you as you walk fully naked, enjoying the soothing contact with the leave on the branches.<br />
<br />
“See Max? The clothes are only in the way, come on!” You yell followed by a session of involuntary braying. <br />
<br />
He stays still for a while, probably thinking but in the end he rips his already ruined clothes. Like you, Max also has a furry torso, arms and legs. Feet, hands, face and cock were still human-like.<br />
<br />
“It feels great! Heee Haaaw” Max says jubilantly as he feels the once fiendish branches caress his body. You notice that his brays seem more animalistic than before, his voice getting raspier like yours.<br />
<br />
You nod and bray as well, loving the sound.  <br />
<br />
The zig-zagging continued for a bit and further head the path began to widen once more. Your bodies are almost fully covered in fur save for your heads, hands and feet. You barely take notice, though. You keep close to the hedges, enjoying the contact.<br />
<br />
But you soon found yourselves with a new ordeal. The path ahead of you had a lot of sharp pebbles in the way. Your naked feet begin to hurt as you step on them. The both of you even attempted to dig the pebbles with your hands but underneath one pebble there were just others just as sharp. You both decided to go ahead. In fact as you look back you see the hedges covering the path you had come from. Surely this was the correct way. You went first, carefully placing your foot but the pain was unavoidable. Luckily despite the pain the pebbles didn&#39;t cut your soles. Max and you began walking carefully on your tiptoes, each gasp of pain accompanied by a short bray. It had become nearly impossible to avoid braying. Even as you  warned Max about where the smoother pebbles were  your throat automatically produced the sound.  Max had been braying as well. Was he doing that unconsciously  too?<br />
The painful walk was thankfully coming to an end. When you finally walked on the smooth floor you  discover that for some reason you kept on walking on your tiptoes and Max was doing the same. You even try to put your whole foot down but you find it oddly difficult to do so. It&#39;s as if your walking style has been permanently changed. As you proceed forwards...</p>
