<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The glare of the florescent lights forced Andrew to squint. Coming up the escalator especially.<br />
<br />
But there he was, in the men’s department of the store. It had everything he needed, Jeans, baggy sweatshirts and loose jackets. As he got off the escalator and walked over to the jeans section and looked around a bit, he spotted the changing room, it was right in front of him. Andrew could feel weight in his step, and still wasn’t used to it. All the jeans seemed fine though, and after all he just needed his clothes to fit, and he wasn’t picky. <br />
<br />
Andrew moved towards the back and began looking at the different jeans. He thought for a moment, and looked down at his waist. It bulged out a little now; he figured it was just all that food he had eaten… Andrew could feel it his little belly pushing on his stretchy sweat pants. Originally he had been a mere size 31 or so in the waist, but things had changed, and he didn’t have a clue how much.<br />
<br />
Andrew grabbed a size 33 a 34 and a 35 and headed to the changing room. He went into the little room and closed the door where a full reflection stared straight at him. He really was a big guy now, he thought. His face seemed different somehow, but he couldn’t quite put a finger on why, and his body, well, it had completely changed. He remembered his reflection in the mirror he had seen in the morning. It was basically the same, he figured. He wasn’t used to his body, so how could tell if something had changed? Andrew was just glad that his hairy stomach wasn’t visible under his thick sweatshirt. <br />
<br />
Andrew took off his sweatpants to reveal thick, hair-covered legs. Even his once-loose boxers seemed unprepared to handle his new found size. But nonetheless, He tried on the 33s, only to realize, immediately, that they were now way too small for him. He couldn’t even get them up to his waist; his legs were just too big for them. “Ok… never mind” he mumbled to himself and threw the pants into the corner. <br />
<br />
Next were the 34s. He struggled to put them on, but they at least made it past his legs, and they made it to his waist, even though they were still too constricting to be able to button up. They were just too small. Andrew ended up struggling to take them off too. But they weren’t half as bad as the 33s…. still, too small. Andrew tossed them into the corner with the 33s<br />
<br />
The 35s. They were seemed big at first, as he held them in his hand, he was impressed by their width, but was he slid them up over his boxer shorts, he realized that he had grown just that wide. It was a good fit. Not terribly small, not really constricting, and in his estimation, pretty good. They fit him well. They ‘hugged’ him, he thought. <br />
<br />
Of course, this wouldn’t due just to try on the 35s, he was going to have to see to the 36s too.  Andrew couldn’t help but stare back into the mirror, admiring his size, the snug jeans.  Andrew went closer to the mirror, and with his left hand he reached down and pulled up his sweatshirt to reveal his hairy midsection. The image in the mirror still shocked him, even though he had been like this for the whole morning. His belly was covered in thick brown hairs that were the thickest in the middle. Not only this but his stomach seemed to push out a little over his waist. Not much, but enough to make him appear thick. He lifted his shirt higher, admiring his new bulky physique. It was hairy all right, a hairy stomach. The thought crossed his mind that the reflection appeared a little more hairy than it had in the morning, but Andrew quickly dismissed it as a result of the bright lighting.  <br />
<br />
Andrew paused, let his shirt fall back down, pulled off the comfortable but close-fitting 35s and pulled his sweats back on. He walked back out into the open to find a pair of 36s. He walked over to the rack, and paused a moment. Something seemed odd to him, he didn’t know what, but he didn’t feel normal, or anyway, like he had before. He had no idea why. Well, wasn’t in any physical pain, so why would it let him be stopped? He stood up straight again and grabbed the pair of 36s. It crossed his mind that he could also get some sweatshirts too, while he was at it, ….he did have 200 dollars in his wallet.<br />
<br />
He walked from one side of the large room to the other and suddenly he was in a forest of sweatshirts and long-sleeves, of all different types and colors. Andrew carefully examined the sweatshirts. He was far pickier about these than his austere jeans. The color had to be right for his shirts- they had to look good.<br />
<br />
 Andrew wandered about this section of the clothing department for a solid 15 minutes in search for something he liked. He found one, and then a second one, he grabbed it and walked towards the back of the area to look for more. He shuffled through more and more. His stomach growled, but he took no notice of it. He found a third thick sweatshirt, hooded and red that appealed to him. He liked the hooded sweatshirts, but unfortunately, they were pricier. Andrew added them up in his head. He was good for the moment, actually, he estimated he could buy 2 pairs of pants and the three sweatshirts, and maybe some boxes with the money he had. That sounded good. After many minutes of searching, he found the boxers. It was a lucky day, they were on sale. <br />
<br />
He could get three for the price of two, and that was a pretty good deal. So Andrew grabbed the larger plaid boxers and walked back to the dressing room. <br />
<br />
Andrew walked into the room, still slightly shocked by his own reflection. He put down the clothes on the shelf, took off his own sweatshirt and tried on the “extra large” sweatshirts. They fit him surprisingly well. They didn’t feel like an extra large. That was fine. He tried all three on and then he realized that they all were perfect for him. They weren’t huge on him, but big enough to hide at least some of his sudden weight gain. His stomach growled again, he tried to ignore it.<br />
<br />
Then for good measure Andrew tried on the 35s again. As he slid them up he noticed something very wrong. They felt more like the 34s than the pant he had on earlier. They seemed ok around the legs but they seemed too snug around his belly. His belly.  <br />
<br />
Andrew looked down, it couldn’t be, he thought. He was just fine 20 minutes ago, everything was fine then… it couldn’t be. <br />
<br />
Andrew could see an outline of a little belly pressing on his big tee-shirt. Come to think of it, his tee-shirt too seemed a little less large than it had earlier. It was the biggest one he could find this morning, but now it didn’t even seem large, it fit him just fine. He wondered if he was just imagining things, but as he stepped towards the mirror, Andrew pulled off the tee shirt revealing his big hairy body and as he examined it in the mirror he noticed something.<br />
<br />
 He really did look larger than this morning. Not only that, but the average patch of chest hair was now noticeably thicker, darker looking than it was in the morning. Andrew peered down at his chest, down at his two round pecs and much to his surprise noticed that small hairs were all ready starting to spread upwards and outwards. Andrew was awestruck. ‘How long am I going to keep changing?’ he asked himself. ‘What am I going to become?’ <br />
<br />
Andrew tried to remain calm. The 35s were definitely too tight for him now, Andrew traced it back to his stomach grumbling. He reasoned that that had something to with his expanding body. Andrew was frustrated. Maybe he was just bloated? No, he thought, he was definitely changing. Well, he thought, he might as well buy and see what would happen… slightly small clothes was better than absurdly small ones.<br />
<br />
Andrew pulled on the 36s. They seemed much better. They were a perfect fit, at the moment, anyway… They weren’t tight around his waist, and better yet, there was still room around there. Andrew paused and thought for a moment…. Maybe he’d grab some 37s too… while he was at it. Andrew pulled on the sweat pants and shirt and made his way out of the dressing room….</p>
