<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Ty and Dustin wandered around the large shopping mall, they came across a new shop at the very end of the mall. The store sold auto parts! There was a retail section inside of the mall, and a garage with workshop in the back, where people could get their vehicles serviced. <br />
<br />
“Oh, look at that! A place where you can buy accessories for our car! Let’s check it out!” Dustin suggested as the boys walked in. <br />
<br />
Once inside, Dustin came up to a large Customer Service counter where he asked for a new set of wiper blades for his model of car. <br />
<br />
“One moment, let me ask Henry to get it out of the warehouse for you!” the lady behind the counter said, as she picked up the microphone and called on Henry to come to the front desk.<br />
<br />
A few moments later, a young man, around sixteen or so, came walking in, carrying a heavy box. <br />
<br />
“Here is the car battery you requested.” Henry said, as he set the heavy box on the counter. <br />
<br />
“Henry, please get two wiper blades from location D-34-76-99 for this customer, please!” the lady said to him. “Don’t forget the brake pads in C-99-76-45.” <br />
<br />
As the boy ran off, Dustin and Ty watched him as he strolled through a large door, near the back of the store. <br />
<br />
“Uhh… Poor kid is as skinny as a rail. I don’t know how he could carry any heavy car parts around here!” Ty sighed. “How much do you think that kid weighs, Dustin?” <br />
<br />
“Uhmm… Just over a hundred pounds or so, I guess?” Dustin shrugged. <br />
<br />
“Hmm…. I think Henry could use some more muscle on his frame.” Ty reasoned. “A LOT more!” <br />
<br />
Henry returned five minutes later, with two long, narrow packages with wiper blades, which seemed light and easy to carry. In the other hand, he held a heavy box containing ceramic brake pads, and these seemed a bit heavier. He struggled to carry those. <br />
<br />
“Here… Here you go!” Henry said, out of breath. He set the brake pads and the two wiper blades on the counter. <br />
<br />
As Dustin proceeded to pay for his wiper blades, Ty decided to have some fun with the little warehouse helper. <br />
<br />
“Time for Henry to bulk up a little. Let’s have his bladder fill up, so he must go to the bathroom.” Ty grinned as he whispered this quietly. <br />
<br />
Henry suddenly walked off and strolled to the men’s bathroom, with Ty following close behind. Once inside, Henry went to a urinal. <br />
<br />
While he stood there and did his business, Ty walked in and wished to be unnoticed by Henry.<br />
<br />
“I want Henry to gain fifty pounds of raw muscle, evenly distributed all over his body!” Ty said quietly. <br />
<br />
“Uhhhmm!” Henry groaned, as he was immediately overcome by a weird, abrupt tingling sensation, which just came out of nowhere! <br />
<br />
Henry’s arms bulged a little bit while his pectorals pushed outwards by an inch or so. His flat stomach began to develop abdominal muscles and his quads grew slightly wider and deeper. Finally, his biceps and triceps gained some precise definition as his calves inflated just slightly. The skinny, blond boy with curly hair now began to look like a swimmer or a beginning wrestler, sporting some muscle all over his body. <br />
<br />
Henry was still wearing his red polo shirt and his blue jeans, required for his job at the auto parts store, but his shirt and his jeans were a lot tighter on him! <br />
<br />
“Hey… What… What happened?” Henry wondered, as he looked down at his chest, arms, and legs. Henry felt slightly bigger, heavier, and stronger. Of course, he had no idea why he had suddenly gained fifty pounds of muscle. <br />
<br />
Ty was also in the bathroom, but he was invisible to Henry. He was looking over the results of his wish, but he wasn’t happy.<br />
<br />
“Naw, that’s not enough!” Ty sighed quietly. “He’s still too small. I want Henry to gain DOUBLE that amount of muscle, right now!”<br />
<br />
Just as Ty had commanded, Henry experienced a second growth spurt in the bathroom. This time, he was set to gain another HUNDRED pounds of raw muscle!<br />
<br />
That weird, odd tingling sensation struck Henry’s body again. This time, it was more intense as every muscle began to grow rapidly, all at once and all over his body at the same time! <br />
<br />
KKKKKKKRRRRRRRRRRR!!!<br />
<br />
“WHHAAAARRHHHGG!!!” Henry roared like a wild animal as his muscles exploded from his body. <br />
<br />
Henry’s pectorals grew so big and so wide, that they ripped apart the front of his red polo shirt. Next, his biceps and triceps expanded and became so large and so hard, that the enlarged muscles tore the sleeves off the remains of the torn polo shirt on both sides! <br />
<br />
CRAACKKKKKKK!<br />
<br />
Next, his quads began to grow thicker, wider, and deeper, filling out the jeans until the threads at the seams gave way. His jeans tore on both sides, exposing his large, bulging quads! The same thing happened to the boy’s calves, which had grown to the size of soccer balls, before they tore gaping holes in the back of the ripped blue jeans. <br />
<br />
RRRRRIIIIPPPPPPPPPPPPPP!!!!!!<br />
<br />
“OH NO! My clothes! What’s going ON?” Henry screamed, as his body burst out of his shirt and jeans. “WHAT THE HELL????” <br />
<br />
When the intense growth spurt finally ended abruptly, Henry’s clothes had fallen off his large, Hulking frame. Henry could only look up and gasp at his stunning reflection in the large, bathroom mirror. The short, skinny teen went from scrawny to a 250-pound teen bodybuilder within just a few minutes. <br />
<br />
Ty saw how the massive growth spurt had destroyed his work uniform, and he didn’t want the poor kid to get fired from his job. So, Ty made a silent wish, and Henry found himself suddenly standing there, wearing a much larger version of his uniform. Of course, you could see, Henry had his big, thick arms, broad shoulders, and his huge legs, that the boy was insanely strong and muscular! <br />
<br />
“What…. My uniform! How is that possible? What happened?” Henry cried out, as he flexed his arm before the mirror when Ty suddenly appeared in the bathroom before him. <br />
<br />
“Hey, are you Henry?” <br />
<br />
“Uhh… Y-Y-Yeah…” <br />
<br />
“They’re calling for you at the front desk, big guy!” Ty grinned. “By the way, thanks for getting those wiper blades for us!” Ty smiled, as he pretended to use the urinal as well. <br />
<br />
Henry calmly used the sink to wash his hands and Ty walked up and used the sink next to him. Ty decided to alter reality for the boy, so he would forget that he was a skinny guy just a few minutes earlier. He had always been a muscle man! <br />
<br />
“So, I guess you work out in a gym, huh?” Ty asked him. <br />
<br />
“Uhh… Yeah, how could you tell?” Henry asked. <br />
<br />
“Dude… You got a LOT of muscle on ya!” Ty laughed. “It’s kinda hard to miss your HUGE muscles!” <br />
<br />
“Oh, well… I guess…” Henry replied shyly as the two boys walked out. <br />
<br />
Ty and Henry walked out, chatting the whole time. For Ty, he felt satisfied that he had the opportunity to use his powers to help another young guy and make a new friend along the way.</p>
