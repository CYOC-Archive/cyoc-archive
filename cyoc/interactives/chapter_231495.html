<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Gerry did his best to wait for Ellen to fill him. Pregnancy did a lot to take the edge of craving sex and cock, but he still looked forward to Ellen&#39;s body. Gerry was alone in the office this Friday, the rest of the team were working from wherever. Chad came in this morning but already left, going home with one of the new accountants that hired on. Gerry thought it helped that the new guy could not keep his eyes from Chad&#39;s huge G cup chest. Chad mentioned the guy was divorced and was helping the new guy discover anal. That&#39;s when Gerry thought about Ellen again, and how it felt when she filled him up. Good times he thought. Gerry would find out soon if he made it to vice president of sales support, a new position he got the ownership of the company to create. The sales VP didn&#39;t fight Gerry on this since Ellen had a discussion with him at the parking deck elevator. Gerry was showing now, it was coming up on three months. He figured he would lay his soft shelled eggs in the next five days. His secretary wanted one. She had never had kids and was divorced. Ellen wanted her to move into the apartments. Ellen wanted to make sure those who raised their kids were the right kind of people. Ellen had a few candidates for the others, if there were any. Gerry&#39;s visit with the ob/gyn was uneventful, as it looked like his first pregnancy was a single egg. Gerry was going to work from the apartment until he had laid his first egg.<br />
<br />
Todd, his brother Eric, and sometimes Ellen had been busy with establishing a new business and making sure they still had some hand in their old business. The shemale brothers had dinner with Gerry and Ellen twice each week for the past month. The pair were working on a plan of real estate and property management. The trio were still working on buying our apartment complex, along with the nearby property. By night, Todd and Eric joined a couple from downstairs to spend the evening at several local fraternity houses. Ellen had been spending more nights with Gerry as his bodysuit showed the bulging egg in his womb. Ellen was quite aroused by her pregnant husband. Gerry had re-married Ellen in a small ceremony with Todd, Eric, and Gerry&#39;s work friends. Gerry was now in a trust with Ellen, Todd, and Eric. Gerry was amazed at how sharp the brothers were with business, and did his best to pay attention and learn. This helped Gerry with his client support role, as several clients were appreciative of the insight his team sought to provide.<br />
<br />
The apartment complex has changed a bit in the last three months. The on-site superintendent role was filled and the old bitter guy who started out has become a rather pleasant six foot ten inch shemale with huge breasts who stayed on top of things and actually handled all of the maintenance items in a quick manner. Trash was no where to be seen. Gerry was the last masculine looking resident. Ellen had finally got around to converting the last man. Gerry was surprised that they all consented, but I think the wives had a lot to do with pushing for it once they saw the cocks they would enjoy. The children in the complex were always accompanied by one or both parents, and the teenage kids acted respectfully and helped out with keeping the complex clean and helped clean the pool with the supervision of the Superintendent. There were four paid lifeguards from the ranks of the older teens. That pool was never open for all the  years Gerry and Ellen had lived there. The only crime was when outsiders came and broke into cars outside the gate, with Todd and Eric taking that one to fix.<br />
<br />
Gerry was about to go to bed a few nights later when he dropped to his knees next to the bathroom sink. He had felt the urge to push come and go, so Gerry went with the flow and pushed. He was sweating and was holding himself against the sink and the cabinet as he remained upright pushing down. Soon, there was a lull, and the discomfort faded. Gerry sat down and spread his legs, and tried pushing again. He felt it close, and tried pushing for a few moments, then he felt movement, and then the egg was through. Gerry pushed some more before realizing that he was done, and the one egg was out. The small size was a surprise to Gerry. He had a good size belly bump, but the egg was not big enough to explain it. The egg was long and slender, in a soft mucus covered membrane. Gerry was just watching as the tendril grew from the end closest to him and moved to his anus, where he lied down and let the tendril enter. There was a pinch as the tendril found a blood and nerve bundle and attached itself. Gerry didn&#39;t know how long he would be here, and Ellen was out, so he got comfortable and faded off to sleep.<br />
<br />
Gerry awoke later, still night, and felt light headed. Gerry&#39;s head was spinning as he barely lifted his head to see the egg. The egg was bigger, and the tendril was moving. He felt the tendril withdraw from his asshole and then nothing. Gerry was too weak to move as the egg had drained him of nearly a quart of blood that his body was working to replenish. Gerry was out, and not until well after noon did Ellen come in and find Gerry on the bathroom floor.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ger....are you ok?,&quot; asked Ellen. Ellen looked over the egg. The tendril was extending again, so Ellen watched as the tendril extended into Gerry&#39;s puffy anus and slid deeper. Several moments later she saw the blood pumping back and forth from the egg. Ellen wondered how often this would occur. The egg was attached for about twenty minutes before the pumping stopped, and after a few moments, the tendril slowly withdrew from Gerry&#39;s ass and back into the smaller tip of the egg, which was now shaped like a giant pear. Ellen was strong enough to get Gerry&#39;s relaxed body onto their bed face down, and put the egg between Gerry&#39;s legs for the next feeding. Ellen stayed at Gerry&#39;s side until he awoke hours later.<br />
<br />
Gerry whispered, &quot;Water, please.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ellen lifted a straw to a cup with mostly water and some mostly melted ice. Gerry slowly drank the entire cup. Then he whispered, &quot;More please.&quot; Ellen refilled the cup, which held about a quart, three more times. Ellen saw the flow in the tendril change to a lighter pink as Gerry drank the last two cups full of water.<br />
<br />
Ellen watched the tendril retreat back into his place on the egg. Gerry remained still and sighed, &quot;So weak, light headed,&quot; he said in a soft whisper. Gerry asked, &quot;More water please.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gerry nursed on the next two, and by the time he finished the second cup full, he sat up in the bed with Ellen&#39;s assistance. Gerry saw the egg, now much larger, for the first time since it was laid. &quot;Wow, that sucker grew,&quot; he said softly, his voice only a whisper. Gerry smiled to Ellen, who kissed him.<br />
<br />
Ellen said, &quot;It seems to feed every half hour or so. I&#39;ll take the next one if that&#39;s alright.&quot; Gerry nodded, his eyes opening wide at the offer.<br />
<br />
Ellen laid down on the bed , spinning the egg around and presenting her ass to the place the tendril would extend from. Gerry crawled out of bed and to the bathroom on his hands and knees trying to avoid emptying his bladder and bowels on the bedroom floor. Gerry heard an &quot;Ow&quot; from Ellen as the tendril attached itself inside her as he sat on the toilet. Gerry smiled, and would tell Ellen it doesn&#39;t really hurt after the first time.</p>
