<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff was staring at his newfound, massive dick. After some exploration of the options, it was very easy to revert the newfound big schlong back to his familiar 4 incher, and even better keep some of the traits from this transformation too. But if this package was truly something that created the average of a human body part...<br />
<br />
Gender was a real question. What&#39;s the average of a man and woman? He was pretty secure in his identity as a man, but the curiosity was there. How would it feel to have a hole instead of a stick down there? How would it feel to have both? <br />
<br />
He shook his head. His curiosity only focused on genitals for now. The thought of getting breasts was strange to him, especially to a scrawny boy who couldn&#39;t build fat or muscle for the love of him. He supposed that since he was so thin as a guy, it would make him perfect for this &quot;average&quot; package. <br />
<br />
He took to the web again, incognito browser being his best friend (though Jeff supposed that having a shady magical computer program that could change reality was already pretty incriminating) and looked for the juiciest cameltoe he could find. He could already feel the blood slightly rushing to his massive dick, though it was so large that getting into an erection would take it quite a bit of time. Well, it put his decision on his timer, since he should probably do this before he had to ejaculate again. <br />
<br />
This time he chose a real human&#39;s waxed pussy. Juicy, virgin, tight, (and white, it would be weird to mix races for genitals only he supposed), he cropped the photo and inputted it into the chronivac. It was another rash decision, but he was a 16-year-old teenage boy, they were a trademark for him. <br />
<br />
[ENTER]<br />
<br />
Pain shot into his balls. It hurt. Real bad. Like a football punt somehow landing on your dick. He gasped reaching for the trash can again and covering his dick before gripping the chair. It&#39;s ridiculous that his dick could even hold the large metal can, Jeff thought through the pain.<br />
<br />
Again, another kick to the nuts, even more painful this time as he gasped, the feeling shooting up into stomach. He screamed as he felt his skin tear, like hands were gripping through a hole through his skin pulling it apart. His balls felt even worse now, like being cut in half by a hot knife.<br />
<br />
Internally his balls had split into four, two remaining as regular testicles that sat at the sides of the vagina, almost ballsack-like but tight enough where it kept a regular pussylip shape. By the end of this, Jeff would have the most impressive cameltoe, folds of skin forming to make the lips of the vagina in between his displaced testicles. The other two converted into two very healthy, very fertile ovaries, the vagina put into overdrive as it compensated the genital&#39;s pubic growth. <br />
<br />
Jeff had literally grown 16 years of pussy in one go, and it was painful, blood gushing out of him. He was glad the can was there, because most of the blood seem to flow in there. Guess he knew what a period was like that as he screamed in pain, the world&#39;s worst stomach cramp hitting him. <br />
<br />
After the pain had subsided, Jeff groaned as he crawled up to the computer, his slightly blurring eyes reading the message.<br />
<br />
WARNING: Please note that different types of genitals are averaged differently. Having a dick only averages with a clitoris and testicles average with ovaries. This is a painful and arduous process, so it is not recommended to do with the [MERGE PACKAGE]. <br />
<br />
&quot;At least my question was answered,&quot; Jeff thought wincing as the residual pain still remained.<br />
<br />
He quickly went through the options to clean up the room and restore his own health. He lost a ton of blood, and he was actually at critically low levels now, so he fixed himself up before he did any experimenting or looking. <br />
<br />
In the shower, he carefully looked at his new set of genitals. He couldn&#39;t really see his new vagina, but he could definitely feel them. Either the girl he pulled it from had some uterine hypersensitivity disease, or it just averaged out the genital sensitivity with his dick, but it quivered the moment he managed to touch the inside (after a little bit of digging in between his inset balls), and DAMN did it feel good, like an instant ejaculation. <br />
<br />
He had noticed that his dick, while still pretty large, was much smaller, now 9 inches flaccid. As it said, it averaged with the clitoris, though it definitely could still pump a massive amount of cum. It didn&#39;t even take him a minute to starting shooting like a hose, his pussy also now gushing wet as he managed to both finger it and stroke his incredibly sensitive cock (even more sensitive than before? something about clits, he didn&#39;t know) at the same time, making for the ejaculation of a lifetime. It felt good. And special. He was probably the only person in the world who felt this good sexually. As he dried off, he opted to stay nude, closing the shutters and turning on the lights. He had to try more. This was fun. Genuinely. <br />
<br />
He had felt lethargic recently. Not very athletic, nor very smart, with little to no interest in any hobbies. He had a couple of very close friends, but he almost felt inferior to them, one being incredibly out going and athletic and the other being quiet but very, very smart. <br />
<br />
This was his chance to finally catch up to them. And he would do it one merge at a time, in the most fun way possible. <br />
<br />
But first. He had a decision to make. Now that he had both genitals, he was stuck between leaning on one gender or the other. On one hand, he enjoyed being a man, and looked very much to his father. Without his mother, who died when he was young, he very much looked up to his strong and charismatic dad, and kinda wanted to live up to his name. But on the other hand, his curiosity for the other gender was incredibly strong, and felt GOOD. Both were tempting. Or... maybe he tries a different package? He just couldn&#39;t decide....</p>
