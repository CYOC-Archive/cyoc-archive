<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Eventually they had decided to go through the powered door, the others weren’t as promising. <br />
<br />
4 days Later the two had fought off Bloodless Ghouls, zombies, death traps and deadly puzzles. They were running out of food and when they had just ran out of water they happened upon a panic room. Anna used the last of her strength to get the door open and the two were in disbelief as to what they found: the room was cleaner than the rest of the bunker, it’s lights were on with the occasional flicker. There was an old Christmas tree, it was beat up and a Soviet star served as a makeshift star topper, there was even a fireplace that was lit.<br />
But the two weren’t alone and they immediately readied themselves when they saw one of the Normal soldiers, the black woman, she looked like she had been through hell and most of her armor and equipment were gone. <br />
<br />
“D-don’t shoot please.” The soldier pleaded wearily. <br />
<br />
Anna and Greg lowered their guns, they were empty anyway. <br />
<br />
“So what happened to the other guy?” Greg asked sealing the door lest they be swarmed by more monsters.<br />
<br />
“…Dead, fought off a hoard of yeti so I could make it.” The woman answered.<br />
<br />
“Damn, this place is full of monsters. So you going to try to kill us?” The blonde man replied sitting next to her on the old couch.<br />
<br />
Michelle wasn’t sure if it was exhaustion or delusion but when she looked closer at Greg she couldn’t help but notice how handsome he was. She mentally slapped herself and refocused.<br />
<br />
“…N-No, fuck this place. I should be home right now.” The soldier said kicking Greg’s leg away from hers, trying to hide her embarrassment.<br />
<br />
“What? You got a Mr. Soldier waiting for Christmas dinner?” Greg said and kicked at her leg.<br />
<br />
“No, but I got a sister and a nephew…guess I won’t make it this year again.” She said solemnly.<br />
<br />
“Shit uh—sorry… that sucks, I don’t have any family worth visiting and Anna here doesn’t speak to her parents. I’m Greg Wesker, this Latina beauty is Anna Rosario.” Greg said holding out his hand to the soldier.<br />
<br />
“I-I’m Wallace—Michelle Wallace.” Michelle replied wearily taking his hand.<br />
<br />
The two looked at each other and both realized they were shaking hands for too long. Blushing they stopped and looked the other way.<br />
<br />
“Did you see this?” Anna said braking the awkward moment.<br />
<br />
The others looked to Anna and saw that there were wrapped gifts under the tree.<br />
<br />
“Y-yea, but I don’t think we should open them.” Michelle replied.<br />
<br />
“Why not? Because we can’t open our gifts till Christmas morning?” Greg said with a smile.<br />
<br />
Greg’s smile was contagious and even Michelle cracked a small smirk.<br />
<br />
“No, this place isn’t normal, I just assumed it was a trap or something.” The soldier answered.<br />
<br />
Anna threw some presents at the two, they looked at the tags and they were addressed to each of them.<br />
<br />
TO: LITTLE ANNABELLA, LITTLE GREGORY, AND LITTLE MICHELLE.<br />
<br />
FROM: S. CLAUS.<br />
<br />
THOUGHT YOU MIGHT NEED THESE. DON’T WORRY ABOUT WAITING TILL CHRISTMAS ;)<br />
<br />
“Is this some kind of joke?” Anna said in disbelief.<br />
<br />
Greg didn’t hesitate and ripped into the gifts, inside were food, water, and ammo. The two women also opened the presents to find supplies as well. Once they had retrieved the supplies and Anna was cooking in the safe room’s kitchen. Greg offered to help but Anna insisted he stay out of the kitchen. Walking back to the couch Greg noticed the tree still had something under it. Greg and Michelle found two last gifts, each addressed to The Normal and S.P.E.A.R.<br />
<br />
LADY ROSEBLOOD WON’T BE TOO HAPPY ABOUT THIS BUT NOBODY SHOULD SPEND CHRISTMAS ALONE. ONCE YOU TOUCH THEM AN EXIT WILL BE REVEALED.<br />
<br />
Inside they each found a shell-stone. The stones were small enough to fit in two hands, they were covered in archaic carvings and softly glowed with warmth. With these their respective HQ’s would be protected from teleportation or portal spells. Michelle was so excited and relieved to see that she would be able to not only return home for Christmas, but also complete her mission. She hugged Greg in her excitement and when she realized what she did she released him and adjusted her tight bun nervously. <br />
<br />
“S-sorry—it’s just it’s been a long four days and after loosing Jameson—“ she stammered but Greg put his finger to her lips.<br />
<br />
Michelle’s face went hot and she slapped his hand away. Greg moved back,<br />
<br />
“S-sorry I don’t mean to—“ the man was interrupted by Michelle slapping him before grabbing his face and pulling him into a kiss.<br />
<br />
“Was there a mistletoe or something?” Greg quipped when their kiss broke.<br />
<br />
“Don’t you ever shut up?” Michelle said, pulling her hair free from its bun.<br />
<br />
“Make me.” Greg said as he but her ear.<br />
<br />
Michelle pulled Greg to the panic room’s bedroom and started pulling his pants down. Greg pulled off the woman’s clothes and revealed her toned dark body beneath. The blonde squeezed her breasts and she let out a moan before biting her lip, not wanting Anna to hear. Michelle pushed Greg onto the bed and used her mouth to slowly pull his underwear down. She then licked her way up to his chest before Greg flipped the black woman onto her back, pinning her arms with his hands. She smiled and they kissed before she wrapped her legs around his torso and used her CQC training to get herself back on top. <br />
<br />
Anna was finishing up with the roast, the kitchen wasn’t as stocked as she would have liked but she wound manage. The only thing distracting her was her partner and the Normal soldier having sex in the bedroom. Anna wished Greg would remember that she had enhanced senses, she knew Greg was an attractive man but being a lesbian she couldn’t see the appeal. Greg always bragged about being a ladies man but he managed to seduce a Normal Soldier? This union will never work out but she knew neither Greg nor Michelle was thinking with their heads right now. <br />
<br />
When their makeshift Christmas dinner was done Anna called for the other two and pretended to be oblivious to their activities. They all sat down and enjoyed this respite from Lady Roseblood’s Catacombs and their organization’s conflict.</p>
