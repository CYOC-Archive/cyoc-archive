<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Rob awoke late that morning; it was his day off after all, and his construction job left him beat-tired at the end of the week. He yawned and stretched in bed, his big, meaty hand reaching down to fondle his enormous morning wood. Rob was proud of cock; at 18 inches long and twelve inches around, he was easily one of the most well-hung men on the yard. His heavy balls, each the size of baseballs, ached for release as they throbbed between his muscular, hairy legs. As Rob fondled his immense tool with one hand, his other drifted across the bed to find the small-dicked twink who had been sharing his bed recently. He’d met Tyler a few weeks ago while riding the bus home from his job-site. He hadn’t needed to look down the young man’s pants to tell he was a smalldick; he could tell not just by the boy’s lithe, athletic frame, but by the way he hungrily stared at the enormous bulge stuffed in Rob’s dirty jeans. It hadn’t taken much encouragement to lure the twink back home to his apartment. But lately, the boy had become something of a fixture at Rob’s place. <br />
<br />
His hand finally found the warm, firm mound of Tyler’s ass cheek. He cupped it greedily and pulled the smaller man closer to him so he could spoon him with his enormous cock. The boy moaned and giggled as he snuggled himself closer to Rob’s muscular, hairy chest. His small cock throbbed to a laughable 2 inches hard as the bigger man’s arms closed protectively around him.<br />
<br />
Tyler moaned as Rob pressed his giant cock against his backside. “Baby, you’re so hard.” He purred. <br />
<br />
Rob chuckled, a sound that Tyler could feel rumbling against his back. “So are you, boy” he said, reaching down to grab Tyler’s tiny prick with his thumb and forefinger. “Not that anyone could tell.” Tyler giggled; he loved it when Rob teased him about his little cock. <br />
<br />
“C’mon, boy. Daddy’s hard and you must be hungry for breakfast,” he growled in Tyler’s ear, nibling the back of his neck.<br />
<br />
Tyler moaned, “I thought you’d never ask.”<br />
<br />
He eagerly tore off the sheets, revealing his man in all his masculine glory. Rob lay back on the pillow, one hand tucked behind his head, the other hefting his enormous, 18 inch schlong at Tyler enticingly. It was so big and heavy it bent slightly in his grip. He released it, and it fell with a heavy slap against Rob’s firm, hairy belly, the tip creeping up almost to the big man’s nipples. Tyler climbed between his man’s strong legs and picked up the heavy schlong, savoring the way it pulsed and throbbed in his hands before taking the bulbous red head to his mouth.<br />
<br />
Rob let out a guttural moan as Tyler engulfed more and more of his cock, each inch sliding down his throat with surprising ease despite Rob’s prodigious length and girth. Tyler moaned around Rob’s cock as it dug deeper within him, assisted by Rob’s big hands pressing on the back of Tyler’s head. Tyler began to stroke the massive cock with his mouth and throat, swirling his tongue over the throbbing head and veiny shaft while his hands kneaded the big man’s hairy balls. Rob put his hands behind his head and spread his legs, letting the smalldick do the work he was born to do. He didn’t normally waste his time with smalldicks other than a quick fuck, but this boy was something else. Eager to jump on his cock at every opportunity, taking his jibes and jokes about his microdick with grace and pride. Tyler was a true smalldick; he loved pleasing greater men with his ass and mouth, and Rob was starting to want to keep Tyler’s talents for himself. He haunched forward and groaned as he felt Tyler’s tongue licking around his balls; the boy had swallowed his meat all the way up to the hilt. Both men felt a swell of pride, and Tyler resumed his efforts with gusto, fucking his throat on Rob’s painfully hard rod as fast and deep as he could. Rob moaned as Tyler snaked a hand up to tweak the big man’s hairy nipples. <br />
<br />
Rob returned his hands around Tyler’s head, so Tyler could tell he was close. Rob began to thrust his hips upwards to match the rhythm of Tyler’s sucking. His heavy balls drew close to his body and Rob let loose a loud, growling moan as he came, down Tyler’s throat. Tyler greedily drank wave after wave of his man’s nutritious cum, feeling his own tiny dicklet spasm and spurt a equally small-sized load all over the sheets. He slowly and delicately withdrew Robs softening cock from his throat, gasping as his muscles and his jaw settled back into place. He fell back onto the bed and put his hand over his stomach; it felt warm and full with his man’s generous breakfast load, but Tyler was hoping that Rob would soon feed him seconds. <br />
<br />
Sure enough, he felt Rob’s strong, calloused hands roughly grab him and pull him up to his body. Instead of being but between Rob’s legs however, he was left on his back, while the big man climbed on top of him and pressed his heavy weight onto Tyler’s trim, athletic body.<br />
<br />
“How was breakfast? Did you enjoy being fed by a real man?” he asked tauntingly, laughing when he felt Tyler’s tiny cockle stiffen and poke against his abdomen. “Nice thing about having a small dick in bed; those tiny little balls don’t make too much mess.” He flicked Tyler’s cock lightly enough to make the man moan and squirm in pleasure, his arms wrapping around Rob’s broad back. <br />
<br />
“You need a real man to help you; you couldn’t get off on your own with a tiny cockle like that.” He said, rubbing Tyler’s cock with his thumb while his other fingers probed the entrance to Tyler’s ass. “Fortunately for, smalldicked boys like you there’s other ways to make you feel pleasure.” He inserted two of his fingers into the boy’s ass and smiled as he watched his face twist and contort while Robs fingers probed inside of him. After two weeks, the boy had adjusted to his size, but it was still a tight fit. Rob tried his best to loosen Tyler up with his massaging fingers, but his churning balls and his rapidly hardening cock were begging for release again. He quickly threw Tyler’s legs over his shoulders, briefly pausing to slap his giant schlong down across Tyler’s abdomen. On the younger man’s smaller body, his giant dong crept up almost to the boy’s chin. It made Tyler’s straining, 2-inch dicklet and blueberry sized testicles look laughably pathetic, but somehow also cute. Rob dragged his cock off Tyler’s body and repositioned himself at Tyler’s ass. He teasingly ran his bulbous cockhead around the margins of Tyler’s asshole before shoving the tip in.<br />
<br />
Tyler gasped as Rob swiftly buried the first six inches of his cock inside Tyler’s ass. He held himself and the younger man in place for a moment before pushing more of himself inside. Tyler moaned and arched his back against the bed as another six inches slid inside of him. His tiny cock was hard as a pebble between his legs. Tyler looked down to catch a glimpse of one of his favorite sights: his tiny cock, pitiful and diminished next to the sight of the thick, enormous rod currently being buried in his ass just a few inches behind it. Tyler’s eyes closed and his hed fell back as Rob thrust his last six inches into Tyler’s body. He felt like he was impaled by the mighty schlong, and yet every inch of skin inside of him that it touched was on fire with pleasure. The bigger man got a strong grip on Tyler’s thighs before he began to roughly and passionately drive his enormous cock into his smalldick lover.<br />
<br />
Both moaned in pleasure as Rob continued to pound away at Tyler’s ass. The bed creaked and the headboard began to bang against the wall. Tyler held himself close to his giant specimen of a man as Rob rammed his cock home, his heavy aching balls slapping against Tyler’s ass cheeks. The two men had no idea that just yesterday, they’d been average college gay guys, out on their third date and each plotting a successful way into the other’s bed. Rob had gone to bed the previous night in a sexual haze after riding Tyler’s glorious cock, and Tyler had been looking forward to finally plowing Rob’s beautiful bubble-but with his once above-average sized dick. It was some fit of strange irony that Rob now found himself a muscular, hairy man with an 18-inch cock and a seemingly insatiably sexual appetite, while Tyler had changed to a cock-hungry, smalldicked twink who loved to be teased and fucked by greater men. Rob’s lust was all consuming as he gorilla-fucked Tyler’s ass into submission. Tyler couldn’t take it any longer, his tiny cock spurted barely anything while his orgasm radiated from his prostate, making his ass muscles rhythmically grip along Rob’s giant tool.<br />
<br />
Rob, feeling the sensation of Tyler’s ass squeezing his cock as he came, was brought over the edge himself. He roared as he came, his cock spewing another gallon of cock into Tyler’s tired body. Tyler shuddered as he felt his man’s hot load spill deep inside him. Rob collapsed on top of him as they both caught their breath. They rolled onto their sides, Rob still holding the smaller man close to him and keeping his still hard cock buried inside him.<br />
<br />
“Babydick, you really know how to treat a man,” he whispered. Kissing him on the forehead. “I’ve never met a smalldick so eager to jump on a Man’s cock before.”<br />
<br />
“Have you seen that thing?” he breathed, “Who wouldn’t want to be fed by a cock like that? Men like you are what smalldicks like me are built for.” He snuggled closer and rubbed his cheek against Rob’s coarse chest hair. A lot of the smalldicks Rob had fucked in the past always seemed to embarrassed, so reserved about their sexual practices sometimes. He loved having a smalldick who accepted his place with pride and gusto. And Tyler loved that he had found a man who knew how use him the way he loved to be used. They rested like that, in each other’s arms for a long time. At least another thirty minutes. But then Rob’s cock stiffened once again inside him and Tyler found himself on his stomach, with Rob working his cock in and out of him again.<br />
<br />
“Time for round 2, boy. Then I can feed you lunch,” he chuckled, putting his hand on the small of Tyler’s back and resuming power-fucking the young, small-dicked man into oblivion.</p>
