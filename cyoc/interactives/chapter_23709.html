<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">In a few days after the president and the afflicted were released back to their families and the media was flooded with information on the new Metas. After a night where fear caused a few deaths, between humans and Metas clashing, the president comes on to address the world.<br />
<br />
The United States government, in coalition with almost all of the other governments released this drug. Placed strategically to spread out the transformations eagerly, they hope to sow Metas where their skills will be of most use. At this, the populace begins to notice how the Metas in their own area match the animals in the area as well. Hoping to foster a connection between animal and human, the governments created the Metas, and urges all people to stifle their anger at the deception, because changed or not, the Metas are still humans, and are the forerunners for Earth's induction into the alliance they seek so feverishly. <br />
<br />
The next month is hell, riots and anger floods the world, as people don't trust their government. But rousing speeches from human figureheads and Meta-afflicted ones alike, as well as a pregnancy between a feline Meta and her husband in Mexico staunches the deathtoll, as the situation begins to simmer. Another month passes, when the Government comes on the air again to make another announcement. Voluntary meta process is now being streamlined. Now that they know what the drug does, they are working to make it less painful, more predictable, even chooseable which animal type to pick. Sparking a few heated debates, among the first to raise the flag are some 'furry activists.' An obsession of sort with exactly what the Meta-strain does, these furries always dreamed of this sort of process. Wealthy company owners, famed celebrities, and leaders soon admit to their desire to undergo the process. Soon, these Meta labs are flooded with applicants, form environmentalists, alien supporters, furries, and curious people. <br />
<br />
One of these people is a young woman named Meghan. Nothing horribly fancy about her, Meghan is an attractive young woman, she is an inch or two below six feet, with a slim build and long brown hair, bordering on black. Her body isn't a supermodels, but it is attractive nonetheless, with a well blessed bosom and long beautiful legs, she stands by the kitchen table discussing the Metas with her family. <br />
<br />
Meghan is a few years past when she needs parental approval for her life, but she wants her family to approve of this before she goes in. A contact in the lab has promised her and her boyfriend, Nick, reserved spots in the head of the line. Meghan even had her animal personal lined up. <br />
<br />
&quot;Meghan, the process has no known reversal, and some of these Metas are being murdered for being different, some people accusing them of being inhuman!&quot; Her father shakes his head, always a stickler with new processes. He refused to correct his own eyesight nor wear any eyewear, too vain for the wear and too skeptic of the corrective surgeries. He viewed a tattoo desire with disgust, let alone changing your entire DNA nature. &quot;Dad, this is my choice. I have dreamt of such a process, and it is for the good of the world! Granted, I won't be leading anything, but it is a step towards what we all want. Grandpa died of cancer, and we have a chance to make sure no one has to die like he did. Isn't that worth a few edgy decisions? You know no matter what I do I'll always be your daughter and always love you.&quot;  <br />
<br />
Her mother puts her hands around her father's neck. &quot;We have no right to stop you, but we are nervous. But we have talked about this for three hours, and you haven't budged an inch.&quot; She gazes down into her husbands shocked eyes. &quot;We have to back your decision, but please, keep us in the loop. If theres ever a problem, physical, mental, or whatever. You come to us. After all, you are going to do this with Nick, so just remember you aren't alone.&quot; <br />
<br />
Meghan moves to each of them, hugging them. Her younger brothers and sister glance at her as she puts on her shoes and jacket, and unknown to them, crosses their house threshhold for the last time as a human.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
_________----------~~~~~~~~-----------_________<br />
<br />
Later that day, Meghan looks over from her bed at her lover, Nick. He is a young man, younger then her by a few years, but it is obvious from their choice that violating norms is no problem. She smiles sweetly at himA, wordlessly reassuring him, and him her of their choice. Neither knows the animal the other picked, wanting it to be a surprise. Nick is a slim man, but no where near thin. Having kept his body in prime shape, his finely toned muscles and assertive gaze will only be enhanced by the Meta process. A few minutes before midnight, a nurse enters. &quot;Meghan, it is your turn hun.&quot; Meghan leans over to kiss Nick, and the nurse helps her to her feet as she follows her out of the ward.<br />
~~~~~~~~----------_________----------~~~~~~~~~<br />
<br />
Meghan is led to the room she will be staying in for the next week, a pair of cameras to keep watch on her as well as a mirror Meghan suspects to be a viewing window. After all, she was only the sixth person world wide to be given this animal, and hers will be the first test of a rather unique coloration attempt at how subtle their can manipulate the DNA. <br />
<br />
After she is injected with a pure dose of the serum, she is also treated to prevent the pain and such the others went through, keeping it to a minor discomforting. She even was able to talk to her younger brother on the phone rather normally during the second day. However, on the first day of her transformation, she realizes the president was not joking when he said it was a process he never cared to go through again. Feeling her very stomach seem to clench, then suddenly spasm outward, she felt as if she was going to throw up immediately, but nothing happened. For an eternally long eight seconds, her heart stopped beating, and Meghan could feel the oxygen fading from her mind before suddenly it regained its force with such moment that she blacked out for a few moments. Letting out a whimper of pain, she clutches her bedsheets as she realizes she is in for another 24 hours of this. <br />
<br />
After 24 hours, she has finally fallen into a sleep induced by some morphine administered to her when the pain exceeded her tolerance levels and she fell into epileptic seizures. She wakes up later that afternoon, woken by a call from her lover. Nick has just been taken in, and has just finished the administering of the drug. Not wanting to make him dread his first day of changes, Meghan is able to stay civil, despite her ragged voice she reassures him she is fine. Behind the mirrored glass, some doctors listen in make note of where her voice seems to show signs of arousal, as well as pheromones in the air. A sultry nature seems to be taking over Meghan's mind, despite her not noticing. Nick, having been without her for so long, notices nothing and chalks any oddities up to her missing him. Over the course of the day, she becomes a bit more aware, as well as rather clever, entertaining herself by doing things the hard but fancier way, such as pulling her meal cart over to her without moving or asking for assistance. She ended up using her sheet like a rope with the pillow tied to the end, dragging it over to her. The rather pointless effort giving more satisfaction then one would think.<br />
<br />
Finally, the physical changes on her outside began. The doctors having had her remove her clothes for comfort's sake, she laid beneath the sheets awaiting the first change, watching her body. She crooned with approval as her skin appeared to darken, passing brown to a deep ebon black, fur pushing itself from her black skin. It wasn't entirely painful, though she could be seen wincing as the hair forced itself out. She arcs her back and moans as she feels her heart quicken, rolling over onto her belly as a nub pushing itself from the base of her spine, a tail beginning for form. Her fur continued to grow, soft silky black furs with a silver undercoating, as well as her brown hair darkening to the same  hair, lengthening and lengthening until it was long enough to end just at the small of her back. Her waist began to cinch as her hips grew slightly, her thighs elongating as well as her lower legs, crying out in pain as her bones reshaped into vulpine hind paws, though her knees remained human, locked in bipedal form. Her tail billowing with fur, she twitches it wildly as the changes begin to affect her torso and head more, her ample chest growing a pair of cup sizes, as her fur thickens around her bosom and waistline, hiding her female sex and breasts modestly, while leaving little about her curves to the imagination. Cursing in all the languages she knows, suddenly her speech is robbed from her and she just groans in pain as her skull reshapes, her ears stretching into pointed tips and sliding up her head to the top and growing large, while a muzzle pushes itself out of her mouth, her teeth falling out as they are replaced with sharp fangs, but all organized and straight. Her nose twitches as her muzzle completes, and she opens her brilliantly emerald eyes, spying the last small change as long whiskers appear out of her snout, licking her muzzle's alien inside with her tongue, she clears her throat as she murrs a few words, quickly regaining use of her voice. <br />
<br />
&quot;What a rush, I am gorgeous!&quot; Her mellifuous voice rings out, as she rubs her own body with her now clawed but still womanly fingers. Her voice is much more smooth, each word eloquent and her tone just a pleasure to hear. <br />
<br />
&quot;That you are my dear.&quot; The doctor opens the door, moving to her to check on a tube still attached to her arm. &quot;You took to the change wonderfully. I apologize again for the pain you felt earlier. If it is alright with you my dear, we will keep you in here one more day for observation and rest, then after that we'll do the paperwork and get you back home to show off to your friends and family.&quot; <br />
<br />
Rubbing my hands all over my sensual body, I purr in delight. &quot;Sounds great, doctor.&quot; Little did I know, this great feeling wouldn't last.</p>
