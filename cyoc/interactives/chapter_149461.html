<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It had been a day and a half since their sleepover. Ever since then, the mutations on Janice&#39;s body developed further, until she had reached the point where clitoris and urethra had been formed into a fully fledged penis.<br />
<br />
She was given priority during her visit at the doctor&#39;s office, but that still meant she had to wait for two other people who went before her, because they had the same checkup after receiving their vaccinations.<br />
<br />
Janice had told the doctor, with her mum in the same room, to her shame, that she was growing boys parts. The doctor, a middle-aged male, checked her privates out and fondled her new part for just a moment, but the alien touch immediately resulted in her developing an erection. Upon measuring -the doctor stated it was supposed to be measured from the base of the penis, at her scrotum, but she lacked that part, so they had to make guesses-, she had already developed up to five inches, which the doctor considered reasonably normal for someone her size. He did warn her, to her fear, that the mutation might not have completed its work, so it could grow even further the upcoming few days. Janice hoped not, simply stated.<br />
<br />
A couple of x-rays showed a complete lack of testicles in her body, her ovaries having stayed the same, and Janice still having her vaginal opening. If she didn&#39;t change any further in that aspect, it meant she would have a penis, but she would not be able to produce any sperm herself, or orgasm through her male member at that.<br />
<br />
When there had not been any more changes overnight -Janice discovered that after feeling underneath her morning wood, although she had the idea it had grown even longer-, she concluded that the coast was probably clear in her case. The dizzy haze of the viral illness itself had also almost faded from her system, so she expected to be in the final phase of her mutation.<br />
<br />
_____<br />
<br />
Janice was currently standing before the toilet bowl, with only the button and zipper of her pants undone. She was holding her penis and nervously aiming at the puddle inside the toilet below her.<br />
<br />
The excitement had already given her a semi, but she really had to pee. From what she had learned, boys couldn&#39;t pee when they had an erection, and she needed to go really badly right now. So long, to the hopes of having a bigger bladder, like all the boys claimed they had.<br />
<br />
It was the first time she dared peeing while standing up. The idea had been in the back of her head for quite some time, yesterday too, but she had constantly pressed on the idea her penis wasn&#39;t long enough to aim at the bowl properly. That hypothesis turned out to be completely wrong, and now that it had grown even longer, she was capable of holding her semi with her entire right hand, holding it like a joystick. She wondered if her hands were that small, or if her new member was just that big. The doctor said yesterday that five inches was perfectly normal for someone her age and size, had she been a boy, but at least a quarter of an inch had grown with it.<br />
<br />
She hopped up and down before the bowl a couple of times, before she decided imagining a waterfall would probably work better.<br />
<br />
And it did.<br />
<br />
She felt a dam break, and a rush of liquid went through the new, alien tube and out of her body. Her aim was off though, and bad aim coupled with multiple jet streams caused a small mess on the tiled floor below her. Some even hit her sock, to her horror.<br />
<br />
She cussed. When the stream stopped, she flushed the toilet and went on to clean up after herself.<br />
<br />
_____<br />
<br />
&quot;Janice, I don&#39;t have to ask it every time from now on I hope?&quot;<br />
<br />
Her mother had entered the room with the weekly laundry basket for the two of them. She had an amused glint in her eyes, but she seemed to make an attempt at keeping a straight face towards her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ask what?&quot; Janice asked?<br />
<br />
&quot;To slide the toilet bowl back down once you&#39;re finished, dummy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Janice blushed, then looked away.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry,&quot; she muttered.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s alright, sweetie. Discovering new grounds. You- well, we&#39;ve had that talk yesterday. Just keep it in mind.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, you&#39;re right.&quot; Janice answered. Thinking back at the one time she peed standing up, she decided, &quot;I think I prefer to sit down anyway. I&#39;m still a girl after all.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mum raised her eyebrows. &quot;That solves it then. Thanks babe.&quot;<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
&quot;How&#39;s Mary doing?&quot; Mum asked after a moment.<br />
<br />
Janice picked up her phone. &quot;I messaged her again this morning. She says she&#39;s fine, and she was open for visitors.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Is she still in the hospital then?&quot;<br />
<br />
Oh, no, I didn&#39;t mean it that way. Sorry, bit of an joke between the two of us as well, and Emma probably, if Mary shared it with her.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mum smiled, &quot;I&#39;m glad to hear she&#39;s okay. Are you going to visit?&quot;<br />
<br />
Janice nodded. &quot;Hm. I was headed there. You want to come with? I heard something happened with her mother as well. You may want to talk to her if that&#39;s the case.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe later. Chores come first. I&#39;ll head over there once I&#39;m finished here.&quot;<br />
<br />
The teenager lifted herself off the bench. &quot;See you later then.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Bye-bye.&quot; Mum called after her.</p>
