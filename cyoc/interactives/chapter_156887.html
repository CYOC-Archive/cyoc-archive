<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">James tentatively began to explore the mysterious room and it&#39;s intriguing contents which could potentially either help him or makes his situation even worse in ways he probably couldn&#39;t even imagine. It struck James that there were remarkably few books and trinkets of this kind in Elspeth&#39;s full sized home. Was this where she kept her witchy stuff hidden and she had simply forgotten about it? Or did she figure there was no way James could use her magic even if he wanted to? He had to proceed with extreme caution but, as his only other option was seemingly to remain three inches tall and live in a dolls house as the property of a crazy witch, he felt he had to investigate further.<br />
<br />
As far as James could think he only needed to reverse two spells - the one Elspeth had used to shrink him and the one which was keeping him bound to her house. He had no desire to experiment with magic he didn&#39;t understand beyond those bare essentials. But was there even anything here that could help him here? He moved slowly towards a table at the side of the room that held a number of magical looking items - a rack full of unlabelled potions, a couple of creepy looking figurines that seemed to be eyeing him suspiciously and a box of carefully arranged ornate looking jewellery - rings, amulets and that kind of thing.  James picked up one of the potions, a bright purple liquid, and gave it a sniff. It didn&#39;t really smell of anything. Still acutely aware of the effects Meredith&#39;s potions had on him and Nicola earlier he put it back in the rack without even taking a sip. <br />
<br />
He next reached out and picked up an amulet from the jewellery box. To his shock it began to emit a bright light and he felt some kind of tingling sensation rising up his arm with alarming speed. He dropped the amulet back down and took a step away from the table as a further precaution. To his relief, the tingling soon subsided without causing any apparent effects to him. Deciding that the spell books might be his safest option, James then moved to the book shelf at the side of the room.<br />
<br />
To his surprise the books were labelled in plain English and seem to give a pretty clear indication of what the incantations contained within their pages were for  - a number were on transformation, others were about mind control while there were occasional tomes for self improvement or even increased sexual pleasure. James had no idea what the binding spell could have fallen under but decided to look in a book on body alteration to see if that had anything that could help his other immediate predicament. He quickly found a listing for a shrink spell which seemed no more than a few strange sounding but fully pronounceable words accompanied by a diagram of some easily achievable hand gestures. It looked very close to what Elspeth had been doing earlier while he was shrinking.  Unfortunately there was no reversal spell he could see as such though, unsurprisingly, over the page there was a similar looking growth spell. James felt a sudden wave of excitement and optimism - could this be his ticket out of here?<br />
<br />
There were still a number of questions and potential issues that prevented him from getting carried away. Firstly, he had no idea if he would be able to use any of these spells himself without some kind of accompanying magical powers. Secondly, these spells seemed designed to be cast on someone else and not oneself - that was certainly what the instructions described at any rate. Thirdly, without a spell to unbind himself from being trapped in Elspeth&#39;s house he was screwed anyway. James made a mental note of the book with the growth spell and placed it back on the shelf. There had to be something about the binding spell Elspeth had used on him in one of these books, he just needed to find it. However, before he could explore Elspeth&#39;s library any further he heard a familiar pair of fully sized human&#39;s footsteps coming from outside. He quickly switched off the attic light and made his way back down the stairs to his bedroom, arriving not a moment too soon as the front of the dolls house began to open.<br />
<br />
It was already a source of great frustration to James that any normal sized person could open out the front of his current abode from the middle at any point, and he had no way of shutting it again unless they decided to do it for him. It removed any sense of privacy he may have had (made more acute by the fact he was being forced to remain naked) and made him feel even more like a toy or an exhibit.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello Mistress&quot; James smiled as politely and innocently as he could muster. He didn&#39;t want to give the slightest impression of someone who would want to plot an escape.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello, dear&quot; the witch replied as she leered down at him in a tone that could have either been affectionate or mocking &quot;Making yourself at home?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Mistress&quot; James squeaked back &quot;I was just heading to bed actually&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, but it&#39;s so early!&quot; Elspeth responded to James&#39; dismay. She then placed her hand palm side up where James&#39; bedroom floor ended &quot;Come with me, I promise I&#39;ll have you back home before you turn into a pumpkin!&quot;<br />
<br />
Figuring it was safest to play along for now at least, James reluctantly clambered onto Elspeth&#39;s giant, withered old hand and sat down. The witch cackled smugly as she lifted him up to her eye level. It was starting to really annoy James how helpless and compliant she clearly thought he was.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well now, what shall we do with our evening?&quot; the witch asked James, as if he would be given any say in the matter.</p>
