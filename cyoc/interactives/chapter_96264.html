<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“OK,” I said, a bit disappointed that he beat me to the punch.  “What do you want to do?”<br />
<br />
“I want you to turn both of us into lions!” he said excitedly.<br />
<br />
“Lions?” I asked.<br />
<br />
“Oh, yea,” he said.  “I think it would be cool to be a lion.  And have sex as a lion.”<br />
<br />
I chuckled.  “You want to turn into lions just to have sex?” I asked.<br />
<br />
He smiled.  “Sure, why not?” he asked.<br />
<br />
“Alright,” I said.  “I’m up for that.  But let’s go to the other room and do this right!”<br />
<br />
We quickly rushed for the party room.  The party room was really just another bedroom.  It was basically another place for us to have sex down here.  We kept a few toys in here.  We’d also held a few amateur orgies in here with the other people who were allowed down here.  I say amateur because Craig and I had only ever been with each other sexually and we’d kept it that way so far.  We were both reluctant to share ourselves with others.<br />
<br />
Once in the party room I said, “Alright, first thing we need is the appropriate environment.  I wish that this room would be turn into an African savanna.”  Instantly the objects in the room all vanished and we were surrounded by what looked like endless African wild.  <br />
<br />
Craig bent down and felt the tall savanna grass.  “It feels real,” he said.  He looked behind him and said, “But I can still see outside the door.”  Indeed, the small hall that led back to the gym was quite visible.<br />
<br />
“I guess the proportions of the room are the same,” I said.  I took a few steps to my right and held out my hand in front of me the whole time.  After a few steps my hand hit what felt like a wall.  “Yep, there’s the wall.  OK, next step.  I wish that the physical transformation will not cause us any kind of pain.  I wish that we will gradually transform into two male lions over the course of the next hour.  I wish that we will remain lions for a period of two hours, and then revert to our normal bodies in ten minutes’ time.  I wish that we will retain enough of our human minds so that we do not intentionally hurt each other.  And lastly I wish that our cocks will be twice the size of a normal lion’s cock.”<br />
<br />
“Why did you make that last wish?” Craig asked.<br />
<br />
“Because lions don’t have the biggest cocks,” I said.  “You want to be disappointed as a lion?”<br />
<br />
“Why an hour to fully change?” he asked.<br />
<br />
I replied, “So we can really enjoy the changes.  And so we can enjoy each other.  Come here, big boy,” I said as I beckoned him with my finger.  I dropped down to my knees.  Craig sauntered over to me with a knowing grin on his face.  His cock was already growing hard.  I wasted no time.  As soon as he was close enough to me I took hold of his cock and shoved it into my waiting mouth.  I worked over Craig’s cock for the next five minutes until he shot his sweet load down my throat.  “Mmm.  I can’t get enough of your taste,” I said as I stood up.  I was about to kiss him again but I was stopped by the fact that Craig’s face had already started to change.  <br />
<br />
Craig’s eyes were a glowing amber color.  A set of whiskers had grown out of his face.  His mouth was full of sharp, elongated teeth and his face was pushing out into a muzzle.  “Oh, my God,” I said.  I was amazed to see his mouth and face alter.  “You should see yourself,” I said.<br />
<br />
It appeared that Craig couldn’t speak as he grabbed my wrist and held up my hand for me to see.  My nails were growing long and twisting into claws.  My hands were also reshaping themselves into paws, which meant that my thumbs were sliding up towards my wrists.  I held my other hand to see that it was altering the same way.<br />
<br />
As I gazed at my changing hands I felt something touching my cock.  I looked down and saw Craig was on his knees licking my cock.  “Craig, no,” I said.  I was afraid he might unintentionally bite down on it with those teeth of his.  But all he did was lick it and that was enough to get me hard.  While he worked at my cock, I felt a set of whiskers pushing out of my face.  Sure enough I also felt my teeth growing long and sharp as my vision changed slightly.  I determined that my eyes must have changed color.  <br />
<br />
I looked back down at Craig to see the beginnings of a tail pushing out from above his ass.  I tried to say something to tell Craig about it but all that came out of my mouth was a deep growl.  I quite liked the sound of it so I growled again, loudly, as I felt my cock explode.  Craig opened his mouth as wide as he could to catch all of my load.  He growled in pleasure as he did.  I growled back at him.<br />
<br />
By this time my hands had completely altered into paws.  I had pads on my palms and my thumbs were gone.  Craig’s tail had grown completely and he swished it from side to side in a very sexy manner.  I felt something happening in my feet.  I looked down to once again see nails lengthen and thicken into claws.  For some reason I decided to lay down in the grass.  Craig practically fell on top of me.  He ran his still unaltered hands over my chest where fur grew steadily thicker.  Fur was likewise growing on Craig’s body, including over his normally bald head.  His fur appeared darker in color than mine.<br />
<br />
As Craig teased my growing fur, I noticed something happening to his cock.  His cock had already grown erect again, but it was also becoming rapidly enveloped with fur.  I realized that a nice, furry sheath was growing over his cock.  Craig finally took notice of the change himself as he stopped rubbing his hands on me and paid attention to his altering cock.  He seemed to smile in approval, though it was hard to tell since his face was now that of a lion.<br />
<br />
It did not take long for the sheath to grow over his cock.  It took even less time for his cock to re-emerge from the sheath.  But now his cock was not his own.  It had taken on the shape and appearance of a lion’s cock.  It had the little “spikes” all over and it now had a more pointed tip.  It was also fairly large in size.  Because of the wording of my wish, I assumed it was larger than a normal lion’s cock.<br />
<br />
Craig wasted no time in sticking his lion cock directly into my ass.  I’d become quite used to the sensation by now, but this was much different.  I assumed it was going to hurt, but I felt no pain at all.  I guess my wish for the transformation to not cause pain somehow applied to this, too.  Craig was on his knees and he pulled me closer to him as his lion cock worked over my ass.  As he held me in place I felt my hips expanding.  I believe my ass was also growing larger and more muscular.  <br />
<br />
I felt a pressure building both within and just above my ass.  Craig roared loudly and I felt him shoot into me.  Immediately after I also roared in climax.  Craig pulled out of me and fell backward.  I didn’t move for several minutes.  I tried to sit up but I found I was unable to pull myself up.  I struggled to roll over.  It took me a minute, but I was finally able to do so.  When I did, I felt completely different.  I did my best to crane my neck to look behind me.  My entire body was now covered in fur that was growing thicker.  I saw that I now had a fully grown tail as well, which explained the pressure I’d felt.  I also saw that my feet had changed into paws.  I didn’t even try to stand up.  I walked on all fours, though my knees still touched the ground.<br />
<br />
As I took a few steps in this posture, something shiny caught my eye.  It was the ring.  It was still around what had been my finger.  It had grown in size and stayed perfectly in place.  The old woman was right that nothing could remove it.<br />
<br />
I walked over to Craig.  He was laying on his back and not really moving.  He looked worn out.  Fur was growing ever thicker on him, just as it was on me.  I saw that his hands and feet had now changed as mine as well.  His cock had retreated within its sheath.  I felt a little cheated until I felt my own cock starting to change.  It took a few minutes but eventually I had a sheath and fully erect lion cock to rival his.<br />
<br />
I was anxious to try out my new equipment.  I nuzzled at Craig with my face and beckoned him to roll over.  It took a few minutes for him to comply.  He rolled over onto all fours in the same posture as me.  I wasted no time in sticking my cock into his ass.  Just as when he had me, I could see that his hips and ass grew larger as I worked him over.  Unfortunately for me, just as when we were normal, I didn’t have as much stamina as Craig.  I came much quicker.<br />
<br />
When I pulled out of Craig I could see something happening to his legs.  They were growing shorter, but thicker and more muscular.  They reshaped into lion’s legs.  As his legs changed his posture did as well so that he was now truly on all fours.  I felt the same changes begin to my legs as I watched his finish.  Once his legs were done changing, I saw his cock and balls retreat back so that they rested perfectly under his tail and asshole.  I saw him swish his tail back and forth so that it touched his repositioned organs.  I heard him growl in approval.  In a few minutes I found myself doing the same.  <br />
<br />
Craig turned his attention back to me.  I could see that his mane was beginning to grow in around his head.  I also saw that his ears had changed shape to be more round and had moved up on his head.  Meanwhile I felt my upper body growing thicker and more muscular.  My arms, now my forelegs, likewise become stronger so that they could better support my large lion body.  Once finished, these changes switched between us.<br />
<br />
The final changes were our fur growing completely and thick over our bodies, followed by our manes becoming complete.  We were now two fully grown lions.  We spent the next minute or so just looking at each other in anticipation.  Then we both sprung into action.  We growled and roared at each other as if we were going to fight over a dead animal.  We slowly circled each other, as if we were feeling each other out and looking for an advantage.  This actually mimicked something we sometimes did as a sex game.  We would chase each other around the bedroom until one caught the other and made him submit.  As you might expect, Craig dominated these games.  In fact, he’d never lost.  So I was determined to beat him now.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately for me, Craig still had the advantage now.  I had a defensive reflex that always got the better of me.  Craig raised his massive right forepaw and reared back to hit me with it.  Even though I could have easily resisted or fought back, I instinctively flinched and turned my head to hopefully avoid the blow.  But Craig duped me.  He didn’t hit me at all.  He took advantage of me looking away from him.  He seized the opportunity and jumped on top of me.  I was knocked off my feet and fell to the ground.  As soon as I was able to pick myself up again, I felt Craig’s cock force its way into my ass.  I immediately whimpered, though once again it was due to pleasure and not pain.  <br />
<br />
Once he was finished, Craig freely offered himself to me.  I needed a minute to recover but I was happy to oblige him once I did.  I decided to go slow in order to make the experience last longer.  This worked only moderately.  I did end up on top of him for longer than he was on me, but only by a few seconds.  I should have wished to have better stamina, I thought.<br />
<br />
We spent the rest of our time as lions playing our game again, though not having sex each time afterward.  I stopped flinching, but Craig still beat me every time for various reasons.  Sensing that our time was coming to an end, we mounted each other once more for additional fun.  Then our time was up and we quickly reverted back to our human forms.<br />
<br />
I wished for the room to return to its normal appearance.  We both climbed up on the bed and just laid next to each other for a while.  “That was incredible,” said Craig.  “You were so good.”<br />
<br />
“You still got the best of me,” I said.  “You always do, you damned stud.”<br />
<br />
“Sorry, babe.  I just can’t let go of that competitive side, I guess,” he said.  That was true.  He never could treat anything in a manner that wasn&#39;t competitive.  “So what was your idea?”</p>
