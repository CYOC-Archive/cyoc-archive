<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Oh…Jake…wh…” Debbie was interrupted by Jake suddenly lunging forward, she gasped excitedly, smiling. “What’s got you so worked up?” Jake smirked. “How ‘bout I just show you?” He leaned forward, kissing her passionately, her legs slowly coiling around him, pulling him closer to her. Jake positioned himself and slowly inserted his new and improved member into her waiting pussy. His hands reached under the fabric of her shirt, playfully massaging them, they were perky AA-cups, but he loved them anyway, though a small part of him had wanted to see them bigger. “Later…” Slowly he began pumping in and out of her, she gasped unlike she’d ever done in the past, a look of pleasured confusion struck her face. Jake could only smile down at his fianc&eacute; as she moaned her delight for the house to hear.<br />
<br />
Debbie was always small in her chest but her body was definitely a work of art, her Grecian heritage attributed to part of that. Her skin was always perfectly bronzed which helped visually amplify her toned stomach and legs as well as her firm rear. Her face had delicate features, her beautiful cobalt eyes could melt any guys heart. High cheekbones and pouting lips made her even more beautiful. Her brunette hair was highlighted with some blonde streaks it was so luscious and luxurious, it fell past her shoulders.<br />
<br />
Without hesitation, Debbie pulled the shirt over her head and off into the darkness. She felt Jake inching himself deep within her, she knew he’d soon reach his limit, but it didn’t come like she’d thought it would. “Oh wow!” Debbie moaned as Jake went much deeper than he’d ever been able to before. Waves of desire flooded her mind as she tried her best to make him go in deeper, but Jake easily held her still, teasing her by going slow. She could make out a mischievous grin from the faint light from the hall, he was enjoying the situation completely. Debbie’s eyes begged for him to continue she made no resistance to his tongue as he snaked it past her soft lips. <br />
<br />
Jake’s right hand glided down, sliding over the soft curve of her ass, he stopped to squeeze it tightly, pushing himself into Debbie’s wet pussy. Debbie moaned aloud, she’d never felt so full and good from Jake’s cock, especially when he wore a condom. True he’d always been good in bed, but it usually took at least a half-hour for her to get even partially this excited. It was a sensation so powerful that Debbie could hardly control her moans. He felt Debbie’s pussy wrapped around his cock like a second skin, it was incredible, unlike anything they’d done before. What surprised him was how quickly Debbie started to reach her climax, he could feel her clamp down on his stiff rod. She rotated her hips, allowing the mind-blowing orgasm to rock her body, she was lost in the pure ecstasy of it.<br />
<br />
Just when Debbie was thinking it was over, her smile was once again replaced by sounds of moaning and soon she was on her way to another round of body rocking orgasms. This time Jake stopped and pulled out as she almost reached her second round of heavenly bliss, her gaze shooting to him in slight distress. Jake smiled. “Relax, time to change positions, stand up…trust me…” Debbie nodded eagerly wanting him to re-enter her aching void, she stood on the bed, keeping her knees together, she felt a little trickle down her thigh from being overly excited. Jake laid on top of the bed in Debbie’s place, he guided Debbie so she was facing with her back to him, lowering her down onto his cock in a sitting position, and they both sighed with excitement.<br />
<br />
As his hands rested on her shapely tan rear, she slowly raised up, then slammed down a little bit on his cock. Jake groaned, smacking her ass, she yelped, continuing her climbs and falls on his larger member. Her soft ass felt good in Jake’s hands and before long they were grunting and moaning like animals, both of them pulsing from their climaxes. At the start of the new position Debbie was the one raising up and down on her knees, now Jake was easily holding her bent thighs off the bed's surface. Pulling her up and down with much greater force giving Debbie even more pleasure. Jake felt Debbie milking his cock with the walls of wonderful void, making sure to drain every drop. She slowly pulled off of him, lying next to him, both panting. Debbie was still feeling the aftershocks, as she helped him off with his condom and threw it into the trash. She noticed that the condom’s tip was full of Jake’s seed, more than she’d seen before from him. Shrugging, she curled up next to him, Jake’s arm wrapping securely around her as they spooned. <br />
<br />
A little later that night, after they'd both passed out from the late hour, Debbie was awoken only a short twenty minutes after their first round, by what Debbie had realized was Jake’s thumb tracing a lazy circle around her nipple as he lay behind her, spooned into my back. The sensation immediately began to spark Debbie’s excitement, and when she moved just a little, she could feel Jake's cock, rock hard and ready to go already, resting between the soft cheeks of her ass. All it took was a slight shift of her hips to get him lined up to slide into her...the night of passion continued. Jake made sure to wear another condom, he realized that sexually enhanced didn’t just have to do with his ability to perform but his…fertileness too. <br />
<br />
Once more they embraced each other in the afterglow of their love making, this time facing each other, legs locked together. Debbie gave him a few long kisses with a big smile on her face the entire time. “Wow, I told think I’ve ever had this many orgasms before. I have you to thank for that babe, but what’s gotten into you all of a sudden.” She pondered with a cute look of consideration on her face, and her finger gently tracing Jake’s muscular arms. “Did you use viagra or something? I’ve never felt you being that big before…not that I’m complaining.” She kissed him again, waiting for his answer. Her groin felt so sore, there was no doubt in her mind that something was different about Jake.<br />
<br />
Watching Debbie stand from the bed, he knew she was getting ready to take a shower and get back to bed. “Not quite, it’s much better…wait here, I’ll be right back…don’t get dressed yet!” Jake said, smacking her playfully on the ass as he ran past her, she giggled slightly. “Fine, but be quick babe, I have to work tomorrow…” She smirked, knowing full well she didn’t really care, watching him walk out of the room, his ass was gorgeous, very firm. “He must be really working out, I can’t believe I didn’t notice.” She went to the bathroom after grabbing the nightshirt once more to manage her hair and clean herself up as she waited for whatever Jake had in store for them.<br />
<br />
Entering the study once more, Jake looked around for a few seconds before recalling the place he’d put the vial down. “Obvious…” Grabbing it off the desk, he glanced at the English instructions still in the printer, making sure he didn’t mix something up. “Doesn’t hurt to be careful, don’t want to end up like Will…” He was impressed at how much control he had and his stamina, he felt like he could command Debbie’s body much better. It seemed like he could read what her body wanted. “Another part of the magic I imagine.” He walked back up the stairs, seeing that Maxine had wondered into the bedroom in his absence, she laid in the corner by herself.<br />
<br />
Debbie walked out of the bathroom, stunningly beautiful in the light, she was equally amazed at the man before her eyes. He was really a hunk now, he even seemed a little taller than before. “So…” She was distracted by his impressive cock as it swung for the first time in the light from the bathroom. It was definitely not the dick she remembered, it sat there soft and just as big as it was hard before. “Oh god Jake, you’re huge…I mean compared to before…I mean…sorry baby, I just mean.” Debbie was at a loss for words, and Jake just chuckled. “I know, it’s alright, I’m a lot bigger now and that’s how it’s going to stay. Just don’t ask me how, it’s just magic, and I’m not exactly fluent with that kind of knowledge. What I do know is that it enhances your body, obviously.”<br />
<br />
Bringing the vial into view, Debbie just stared at him, the proof was kind of in her face to see, and she couldn’t deny it. “Um, well, what does it do exactly?” She didn’t want to end up like her fianc&eacute; in the least. Jake smirked, as he grew closer to her. “Just stand still, trust me, and watch. Promise it won’t take longer than two minutes then you can do whatever you like.” She sighed, shaking her head slightly as she thought about it. “Alright…it won’t hurt will it?” Jake shook his head as he took the topper off. “Not even a little.” He poured four drops onto her bare chest. “Okay, now rub it into your breasts then in two minutes, you’ll see. Just don’t touch me or Maxine…trust me on this.”<br />
<br />
Slightly embarrassed by the thought of Jake thinking she needed improvements on her appearance. But she had recalled telling Jake on several occasions that she’d wanted breast enhancement surgery, but Jake had never allowed it, he loved her just as she was, the thought comforted her as she waited. The two minutes couldn’t pass by any slower, Debbie decided to…<br />
<br />
The oil seemed to spread more than she’d thought it would for the amount Jake put on her. She rubbed it over her breasts and stomach, even rubbing her sore lips with the soothing oil. Sadly after a minute or so the oil absorbed completely into her skin and the soothing sensation was gone. “Well, it’s not great for longevity now is it?” Jake warmly smiled at her. “Just wait…it gets better.” Debbie nodded, she looked back to the vanity to see if there was any change, not even a little increase in the bust. But once the two-minute mark ticked passed, Debbie began to feel a tingling like goosebumps on top of goosebumps running through her body. She felt an extreme pressure building in her chest, she looked down to watch her once petite mounds pushing out further and further from her chest.<br />
<br />
Jake stared in wonder, never seeing it done to a girl and/or anyone but himself really. Debbie’s legs began to lengthen slightly, she gained an extra 2” making her 5’7” now, her legs looking sexy and slender. Her figure seemed to fill out more along with her chest, her hips widened while her ass plumped a little more. The soreness between her legs completely disappeared as the changes moved through her body, she studied her form in the mirror, a look of shock on her a changed face. <br />
<br />
Debbie had always been self-conscious of her body, but everyone’s their own worst critic, she hadn’t met a guy that hadn’t been attracted to her before. But now her face was simply gorgeous, her lips plumped slightly, giving them a sexy soft appeal. “Wow, I could be in magazines…I’m way bigger…” Her boobs were around 34D now, the white and very strained cotton top, which she had bought XS shirts, her small breasts meant she didn’t need a lot of room. Realizing the dilemma too late, her breasts pushed forward and ripped the seams apart. Debbie smiled slightly, feeling good now that her body was that of a Grecian sex goddess. Jake had an instant hard on once Debbie’s transformation had started; now he was almost ready to pounce on her, but he resisted for the moment.<br />
<br />
The unexpected softness of her hands made her feel a tingling from her groin as they explored her newfound bust. She squeezed them, causing the tingling to grow stronger than she’d felt before, as she played with her nipples. A slowly growing need filled her mind, she turned to Jake with a wild smirk; a thought crossing her mind, he’d only been one other place that night and that was to see Will. She thought it strange, but just smiled happily. “Can you believe this? I mean the potential is limitless.” Saying as she seductively walked toward him, stopped and placed her arms around his neck and placed her lips against his, launching an oral assault to his senses. She passionately kissed him with her pillowy lips, her rolling tongue explored the inside of his mouth. Rubbing her breasts against his firm chest. <br />
<br />
While continuing to kiss him, Debbie’s hands caressing his firm body as they moved down to his waist. Her fingers grasping the firm flesh between Jake’s legs, she barely grasped it, stroking it gently up and down with her hands. Jake’s mind was awash, lost in the subtle play from gentle, nimble hand and tongue. Her hand gripped his member more firmly, stroking it with more force, Jake groaned his approval, her other hand gripped his testicles, playfully massaging them. With her hands gripped in strategic places, Debbie guided Jake over to the bed, pushing him to a sitting position, legs hanging over the edge of the bed. “…you’ve given me a body I’ve always wanted. Yes, I was proud of my old body but I’ve wanted a better bust since I was a little girl…now I have to thank you.” <br />
<br />
Debbie winked playfully at him as she lowered her head down to his massive cock, she’d never him a blowjob before in their entire relationship. But she’d figured he’d deserved it, but she still had some suspicions about the vial and what it could do. She stroked his enormous member as she wrapped her mouth around it, taking in what she could, up to about 6” impressively, she thought. Jake grabbed her by the head, pushing further down her throat, at that point she thought she’d gag, but never did. She sucked expertly for several minutes. Jake finally gained his will power back and pulled her from his member a slight pop was heard. Jake smirked, pulling her up to the bed and quickly positioning his slick member between her spread legs.<br />
<br />
Pushing into her soft void, Jake felt it wrapping snuggly around his cock as he pushed into her, it was like they were perfect for one another. He felt more pleasure as he began to move in and out of her tight pussy. His strong hands gripping the soft flesh of her chest that swayed pertly as she moved. Jake had imagined her with them before but this was a hundred times better. Each nerve seemed to scream out with electricity arousing both of them further. Jake’s fingers played along Debbie’s warm flesh. “Oh…god…deeper Jake!” Debbie screamed with desire. Panting heavily while he plunged hard into her, their groins were touching as she took in the fullness of his length. They spent hours making love, having the time of their lives, before it was finally time for them to get a little sleep, both having to work in the morning. They spooned up next to each other and it was safe to say that neither of them had ever had sex like that. It was a whole other levels of passion and even giving them a closer connection to one another. <br />
<br />
<br />
The sound of a blaring alarm clock startled Jake to consciousness, though he felt fantastic, even with so little amount of sleep, he reached over to switch off the alarm. Looking around he saw Debbie still sleeping next to him, she had always been a heavy sleeper. “Babe, you have to get up for work, so do I.” He leaned over, kissing her as she stirred. Their naked forms exposed for all to see, still in the position they’d fallen asleep in. She turned to kiss him on the lips. “Last night was perfect, and that’s saying a lot.” She kissed him again. “I’m going to go to the poolhouse, Eva is about this size, at least closer than I ever was. I won’t have time to shop till later.” Debbie smiled happy with her enhanced appearance, though nervous what her co-workers would think. Shrugging off the thought, she stood up from the bed.<br />
<br />
Jake’s eyes widened, quickly jumping to his feet, he got in front of Debbie’s path. “I’ll go out there babe, don’t worry about it. You hop in the shower, you have to leave before me anyway and this will save some time.” She smiled at his thoughtfulness, Debbie pecked him on the lips. “Something practical please, nothing outrageous! I swear, I’ll give you one good whopping if it’s not something realistic Jacob!” She smirked as he did as she swayed toward the bathroom, giving him a look over her shoulder before disappearing. Jake sighed, relieved he’d just avoided Debbie discovering Will out in the pool house.<br />
<br />
Quickly he grabbed a robe and his slippers as he heard the shower starting up. Jake made his way out of the main house and toward the pool house. He opened the door, turning off the alarm as he stepped inside. Jake looked around, making sure that Will wasn’t already up and about, it was only 8AM and he didn’t want to wake him. Though he did want to get his friend back, he also wanted to have a day with him like this and he figured the magic was plenty evidence that there was a way back for Will. “Will?” He whispered the question, there was no sound, he walked up the stairs to Eva, and for now Will’s room. <br />
<br />
The room was dimly lit from the rising sun as Jake entered, he saw the figure curled in a ball under the covers. Opening one of the shades covering the windows, Jake smiled, seeing only the blonde locks of the girl could be seen peeking out. Jake strolled over to the bed, pulling the covers back to get a better view of her face. It was hard to convince his mind that this was Will, she looked angelic as she slept, her breathing was slow and rhythmic. To one side of the bed, Jake noted the ratty shirt that Will had worn last night, a thought crossed his mind. He pulled the covers further back and saw that Will was completely naked beneath, curled into the fetal position. Seeing very little response from the loss of coverage, Jake smirked, studying the aesthetically pleasing nude form of the stranger. <br />
<br />
“Man, this is too good, two of the hottest women on the planet and they’re less than a fifty yards apart.” Jake spoke softly to himself, his hands couldn’t help but touch the soft, inviting, tan flesh that was his friends. Starting from Will’s calves, he moves his hands to the soft thighs, groping Will’s plump and sexy rear. Will stirred slightly from his onslaught, Jake’s hands quickly pulled back. “Whoa, gotta control myself, he’s your friend, no matter how attractive and feminine he may be.” Jake stood, covering his friend back up. He wrote a quick note and grabbed some clothes for Debbie before walking out the door once again.</p>
