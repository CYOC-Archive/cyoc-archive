<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">There was one woman in particular who caught Jo’s attention. She was lounging on a towel in a bikini, and she had a beautiful body, though not quite as beautiful as Jo’s perfect new form. It would be easy to walk over to her and just start making love without saying a word, since her wish made sure that the woman would be in love with her at first sight, but given infinite possibilities, that seemed surprisingly boring. There had to be something more inventive she could do. Her thoughts meandered, and ideas trickled into her head. What if she were to transform the woman, too, but instead of making her simply sexier as she had done to herself, what if she made her into something that wasn’t even completely human? What if she made her into a more exotic fantasy?<br />
<br />
Her mind was made up. She focused on the woman and made yet another wish. <i>I wish the woman I’m currently looking at were a mermaid who lived in the ocean but could survive on land. As usual, nobody finds it strange that she is a mermaid or that she’s tanning herself on the beach. She, like everyone else, will believe she has always been a mermaid, and she will understand that is a beautiful thing.</i> The wish was simple to describe, but so much more complex in effect than anything she had wished for so far. Despite that, the effect was as immediate as ever. In an instant, the woman’s body started to shift, starting with her legs locking together at the heels. Jo watched with curiosity as her feet flattened and joined together, and the merging of her ankles started to extend up her calves. As her legs pressed into each other, little red scales appeared one by one, slowly at first, then picking up in pace as they swept over her skin. Her feet had completely transformed into a large, caudal fin, and her knees had disappeared completely as her thighs finished merging to form one, thick, uniform limb.<br />
<br />
The scales enveloped the woman’s whole lower body, glittering in the sun like little rubies, and they merged seamlessly with the skin of her upper body. Her bikini bottom dissolved completely, leaving her glistening pussy lips completely bare, but her bra remained, even as her bosom seemed to gain just a tiny bit of heft. Slits formed along the sides of her torso, only just barely visible after they finished appearing, but they were clearly gills that allowed her to breathe underwater, which worked alongside her lungs to deliver oxygen to her blood. She shifted slightly on her towel and flopped her tail against the sand, completely unperturbed by her dramatic transformation, and it was only when Jo took a few steps toward her that she seemed to notice Jo’s presence at all.<br />
<br />
The effect was immediate. The blonde-haired mermaid turned a shade of salmon pink in her cheeks when she realized Jo was looking directly at her, and she smiled back flirtatiously. Even before she’d become a mermaid, she <i>was</i> a very sexy woman, and she was clearly no stranger to seduction, but it was rare to encounter someone more beautiful than herself. Jo, for her part, found the effect she suddenly had on people—even fish-people—intoxicating, and she took the opportunity to stand directly in front of the transformed woman and flaunt her body.<br />
<br />
“Well you’re an awfully beautiful creature, aren’t you?” Jo said, smirking. “Won’t you tell me your name?”<br />
<br />
“Samantha.” The reply was confident, even if her face was a teensy bit bashful. “And I could say the same about yourself.”<br />
<br />
Jo kneeled down alongside the mermaid and helped herself to feel the tail she had just wished into existence. Thanks to her wish from earlier that day, there would be no problem with her getting intimate with someone in public view, and she figured Samantha was taken enough by her that she wouldn’t object. The scales were a marvel to touch, amazingly real given that Jo had just wished a completely fictional creature into existence. She stroked the crimson scales and enjoyed the uncommon curves of the woman’s body, but in truth, she had her eyes on the damp slit nestled cleanly within where the woman’s scales joined with her skin. She was overcome with need, but it was need of an odd sort… a need she couldn’t immediately place.<br />
<br />
“Well, I think the path forward is clear,” Jo said, smiling softly. “Two beautiful women meet, taken by one another… would it not be more beautiful still to make love, a human and a mermaid?”<br />
<br />
Samantha blushed a darker shade of red, and she pushed her tail further into Jo’s lap. “To be honest, I normally prefer men, but… goodness. I will gladly make an exception for you.” Her eyes sparkled as she gazed upon Jo’s gorgeous body.<br />
<br />
The comment was not especially unexpected, but it helped Jo realize exactly what about her need was difficult to place. She didn’t really want to just grind her pussy against the beautiful slit of this woman-made-mermaid. She wanted to <i>penetrate</i> her. It was a desire she had never thought much about, but now that it was within her grasp, it was tantalizing. The thought of having a cock, of being able to slip inside some of those warm, wet folds, to be able to fill her with cum of her very own… it was a sudden, unavoidable need, and she wanted to waste no time in feeling it for real. This wish would not take much thought, merely an expression of desire. <i>I wish I had a big, thick cock in addition to my pussy,</i> she thought, and she knew her wish was granted by the surge of pleasure the fulfillment immediately brought her.<br />
<br />
Her clitoris swelled, thickened, and throbbed. In moments, it had gone from the soft, sensitive button she’d grown to love into a four inch shaft that bulged awkwardly from her crotch. It continued changing: it passed six inches, then eight inches, settling into a massive nine-inch cock that was over two inches thick, a familiar, mushroom-shaped head at its tip. Unfamiliar hormones flooded Jo’s body, and she was thankful that it seemed to know what to do better than her mind did. A second later, and she was straddling Samantha’s waist, grinding the underside of her dick against the mermaid’s crotch, a somewhat more interesting sensation than it would normally be due to the feeling of the smooth scales underneath. Samantha, for her part, wrapped her arms around Jo’s body and gasped softly, staring in awe at that wonderful cock.<br />
<br />
“You have a… did you just…?” the mermaid stammered.<br />
<br />
“Yes, I have a cock,” Jo completed for her, nibbling her cheek as she rubbed her drooling shaft against her body. “I’ve always had it. It’s beautiful, isn’t it? I could tell that, from the moment you laid eyes upon it, you wouldn’t be satisfied if I left your sight without putting it inside you.”<br />
<br />
Thanks to her wish from earlier, Samantha treated everything she’d just said as absolute fact, which led to even more blushing and flapping of her tail fin. “It’s true. I’ve just never known anyone with both a cock and a pussy, and it seems too good to exist.”<br />
<br />
Jo smiled. “It kind of does, doesn’t it? Well, it exists with me.” She paused her grinding for a moment, then pushed the head of her cock against Samantha’s slick labia and slid deep inside her vagina. The feeling was electric, everything Jo had hoped it would be and so, so much more. The mermaid’s pussy was tight around her large shaft, and the instinctual thrusts of her hips combined with the gentle clenches from Samantha’s vaginal muscles were sure to make her orgasm in almost no time at all. “Mm. I’ve never fucked a mermaid before,” she said, with as much nonchalance as she could manage.<br />
<br />
Samantha moaned, and her grip on Jo’s back tightened. “Mmmmnnn. God yes. Oohh. Y–Yes, it’s true… there aren’t—ahn!—very many of us.”<br />
<br />
Jo smiled at that. It wasn’t technically wrong. There were, in fact, not very many mermaids when she was currently inside the only one in existence. “Well, I guess we’ll have to fix that, won’t we?” she said through grunts and sounds of happy pleasure. “I’m sure it would fill you with joy to help to propagate your beautiful race throughout the sea.”<br />
<br />
The mermaid slowly realized what Jo was saying, but thanks to Jo’s magical suggestive ability, she quickly found herself agreeing wholeheartedly. In truth, Samantha hadn’t ever thought too much about having children, but suddenly, she felt an intense moral and biological imperative to be impregnated overwhelm her. “Oh, please yes! I would be honored to—mmph—bear your children.” She removed one of her hands from Jo’s back to rub her right nipple under her bra.<br />
<br />
“Oh, you will,” Jo said with a smile. “I promise.” And with that, she allowed herself to climax, and for the first time, she felt something hot and sticky race up the length of her cock and spill out the tip with a burst of pleasure that rocked her whole body and made her moan loud enough that surely the whole beach would be watching by now. Samantha’s tail dug into the sand as she, too, came, flinging sand into the air with her fin and generally curling and uncurling it. Jo emptied her new balls into the newly-made mermaid’s womb, and she collapsed in happiness onto her body, rolling Samantha on top of her and passionately kissing her on the lips with her cock still buried inside her cunt. They made out happily, Samantha overjoyed to be so intimate with such a wonderful woman with the power to give her exactly what she desired, and they rested like that for a long while afterward, just casually kissing and fondling one another.<br />
<br />
After some time, however, Jo reluctantly pulled her wet, sticky cock from Samantha’s wet, sticky pussy, and she drew herself to her feet. What an incredible way to experience penetrative sex for the first time in her life: in public, with a mermaid, as the person doing the penetrating! It was exhilarating, and she felt herself flush with adrenaline. She knew all eyes were still on the two of them, but she relished the attention. She extended a hand to the mermaid in the sand and smiled down at her. “Do you want me to carry you back to the water, gorgeous?”<br />
<br />
“Oh, um… I can manage on my own.” Samantha seemed a little disappointed that Jo was already leaving, but she didn’t press the point further. It seemed strangely reasonable to her that Jo would casually have sex with her (and indeed, impregnate her!) and leave. “I guess, if it isn’t too much, it would be nice to have a bit of help, though,” she said with a weak smile.<br />
<br />
Jo returned the smile, and she bent down to scoop the woman-fish hybrid into her arms, an easy feat with her dramatically enhanced strength, and she kissed her once more on the lips as she carried her towards the waves. “Raise my daughters well, won’t you?”<br />
<br />
“Of course,” Samantha responded, then paused as a confused look spread across her face. “Daughters?”<br />
<br />
Jo laughed. “I think you’ll find that you’ll bear twins.”<br />
<br />
The mer-woman’s face lit up. What a marvelous gift, to be blessed with not one but two children to help promulgate her race. “You are a truly special woman, indeed,” she said softly. “Thank you.”<br />
<br />
Jo waded into the ocean up to her waist and bent over to let Samantha slide into the salty water, to which she eagerly jumped in and splashed with the comfort of a woman who spent all her life in the sea. It was somewhat amazing to Jo, who had brought this creature into existence less than two hours ago, to watch her swim with perfect comfort and skill. “Of course,” she said, and her voice carried a genuine warmth. “Enjoy motherhood.”<br />
<br />
“I will,” Samantha assured her, and she floated out into the depths, then turned and waved. “Maybe we’ll meet again someday. Until then!”<br />
<br />
Jo waved back, then watched the mermaid plunge into the sea and disappear into the cool, blue, rolling waves. She was gone. Jo turned, then made her way back onto the beach and sat upon the towel the mermaid had left behind. What a wild chain of events that had been! Surely, it had been fun, but was it really wise to be doing so many intense things all at once? She looked down at herself, and upon her warm, semi-flaccid cock resting against her thigh, and she grinned. What harm could it be, really? The ring was still there on her finger, and her power meant anything could always be corrected if something went wrong. It was hard to deny this was wonder. Still, it was also a lot to take in, and she felt that maybe she ought to rein things in a bit and think upon how to follow up such a beautiful, unmatchable act.</p>
