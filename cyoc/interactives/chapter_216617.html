<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“So something doesn’t make sense.”  Jeffy put a shirt on, letting it hang over the shorts he was wearing – both borrowed from Scotty’s old clothes from when he was a kid.  But they fit the now-twink perfectly.  He ran his fingers through his brown hair to smooth it back.<br />
<br />
“Yeah?” Scotty asked, ears returned to normal and tail gone – which made putting his own shorts on much easier.  The blonde football jock grabbed a tank.  Both boys were back in his bedroom, after having gone through the house quickly cleaning it before his parents returned from the store.<br />
<br />
“You.  When the Chronivac reverted me to my real body,” Jeff looked not quite askance, but his curiosity was definitely piqued.  “I mean, we both know you didn’t believe it was real.  And if I were in your shoes...” Jeff almost laughed, remembering the shoes he had put on only a day ago that got him into this current, unexpected reality, “I would have totally flipped.  So what gives?”<br />
<br />
“Oh, I totally lost it for a moment, at least on the inside,” Scott confessed.  “But my biggest fear was losing you.”  Scott got pensive.  “See, I lost someone when I was younger, someone important to me.”<br />
<br />
Jeff got quiet, listening intently.<br />
<br />
“It was years ago.  My grandfather had cancer.  He was dying.  He was so amazing, and I looked up to him so much.  I just couldn’t imagine my life without him,” Scott explained.  “I was so busy trying to figure out how to save him, that I wasted precious time I could have spent just being with him in his final minutes of life.”  Scott sat quietly for a bit.  Then he looked up at Jeff, his eyes glossy.  “I was the only one there, he knew he was dying... and that&#39;s all he wanted, for me to just be with him.&quot;  Scotty looked out the window, suddenly seeming very far away.  &quot;I always regretted squandering those precious moments… I can never get them back.  So I vowed I would never do that again.”<br />
<br />
Silence filled the room.  Both boys sat on the bed, side by side.  Jeff slowly took his boyfriend’s hand.<br />
<br />
“I understand,” Jeff said, and Scott noticed the young man suddenly looked much older than 16.  Scotty recognized that Jeff did indeed understand, like only someone who has been through loss themselves can.<br />
<br />
“When I saw you start to change… all I knew was I loved you, no matter what.” Scotty smiled, squeezing Jeffy’s hand.  The boys hugged one another.  “When the Chronivac finished restoring both our feelings, our memories, your body, I could see it in your eyes. You still loved me.   You were right where you wanted to be.”  A tear fell from Scotty’s handsome, boyish face.<br />
<br />
Jeffy rested his head against his boyfriend’s pec, nuzzling in a cuddle.  Scotty hugged the smaller boy closer.  “I felt like the luckiest man alive.  And I will spend every moment of every day doing all I can to be sure you never, ever regret that decision.”<br />
<br />
“I’m not sure I deserve you,” Jeffy finally said, soberly.<br />
<br />
“Why?” Scott asked.  When Jeff didn’t say anything, Scotty said softly, “You can tell me anything, sweety.  Whenever you&#39;re ready.  I promise it won’t change how I feel about you.”<br />
<br />
“I know.”  They looked out at the sun on the green trees around the back yard.<br />
<br />
“I love you, sweety.”  Scotty kissed him on the forehead, and they snuggled together.<br />
<br />
In that moment, in his big, strong boyfriend’s arms, Jeffy had never felt more loved.  And he knew he only wanted to be with this beautiful man forever.<br />
<br />
Scotty heard a beep.  “What was that?”<br />
<br />
“Oh, I forgot all about that…” Jeff seemed flustered, looking at his Chorivac wrist unit.<br />
<br />
“What?” Scotty asked curiously.<br />
<br />
“I… um… well…” Jeffy fumbled for words, his face flush.<br />
<br />
Scotty gave a little sigh.  “What did you do now?”<br />
<br />
“Oh don’t worry - I didn’t do anything to you…” Jeffy got a mischievous look, then added, “This time.”<br />
<br />
Scotty shook his head and couldn’t help grinning that boyish grin Jeffy loved.  “Okay.  So what DID you do?”<br />
<br />
“Well, you know how we were curious once… how it might be if I had…” Jeff&#39;s words trailed off, he was embarrassed.<br />
<br />
“The Chronivac timeline?” Scotty asked, then as it slowly dawned on him what Jeffy was talking about, his eyes went wide with disbelief.  “You didn’t!”<br />
<br />
Jeffy’s face was a bright red grin.  “I... kinda did.”<br />
<br />
“Oh my God,” Scotty said with wonder, laughing now. They had been wondering one time what it would be like if Jeffy – being a bottom – was still all man, except with a feminine opening between his legs instead of the usual male equipment. “You made yourself a pussy boy?”<br />
<br />
“Well, the straight me was always curious… and, well…”  Jeff’s words faltered.<br />
<br />
Scotty couldn’t stop laughing.  “Let me see.”<br />
<br />
“Hey, it’s not THAT funny.”  Jeff was really embarrassed now.  He could feel a tingling deep within his legs, deeper than usual.  He moaned softly.<br />
<br />
“What?” Scotty asked, trying to stop from laughing.  Then he recognized the lust in Jeffy’s eyes.  “Are you getting wet for me?”  He started laughing again.  &quot;My pussyboi.&quot;<br />
<br />
“Fuck,” Jeffy said humiliated, trying hard not to touch himself, but so turned on now he could barely think.  “You’re making it worse.”<br />
<br />
I’m sorry,” Scott said, doing his best not to laugh, and only partially succeeding.  He rested his hand on Jeff’s lap, eliciting another moan from his boyfriend.  After being donked earlier, Scotty couldn&#39;t resist teasing, “Are you my little cock slut?”<br />
<br />
Jeffy moaned again, louder, his eyes closed.  His pulse quickened, his breathing fasdter, and the words just came out without thought, prompted by his physical impulses.  “Oh God... fuck me you savage beast.  Make me your cock slut!&quot;<br />
<br />
“Since you put it that way,” Scotty grinned, then added, “Pussyboi.”</p>
