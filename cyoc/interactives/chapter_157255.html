<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;No&quot; said Derrick. &quot;As far as I can say you are back to normal, bro.&quot; Then he grinned at Tanner.<br />
Tanner wanted to beg more, but as soon as Derrick was finished speaking Tanner felt something click within him. He was confused as to why he had asked Derrick to return him to normal, if he already was and he was happy to not be this small self Derrick had created out of him. But because of the confusion he asked Derrick: &quot;What have you done with me?&quot;<br />
Still grinning Derrick replied: &quot;Oh, nothing to big, brau. You just accept what I say as the truth when it ends with a specific word. So if I say something that is different from what you think it will be overwritten by my words without question. But you won´t need to worry about it, as you are oblivious to any changes I made this way, bro. And what I just explained doesn´t concern you, too bro.&quot;<br />
At first Tanner was shocked that Derrick could so easily control him and his thoughts. He thought about his earlier begging and if what Derrick said was true that he wouldn´t realize something changed. Then that thoughts vanished as he turned oblivious to said changes, just accepting them as normal. Why worry about Derrick&#39;s doings, he wouldn´t do anything to him, his brother and owner was a good person.<br />
<br />
Seeing Tanner&#39;s face turning into an easy smile, Derrick was also happy. Tanner wouldn´t complain about the changes he made, as he wouldn´t notice them. Only one thing to add that Derrick thought about now: &quot;You also won´t concern yourself with the chronivac and won´t use or talk about it to anyone, bro. It´s my thing and our little secret.&quot; Tanner just nodded. Why concern himself with his brothers things.<br />
What Tanner also didn´t know was that Derrick had altered reality so nobody would question why Tanner had ball-joints and such. And so they met their parents inside to eat dinner without any questions to Tanner&#39;s changed physique. Afterwards they drove home. Derrick couldn´t shrink Tanner before their family, so he stopped a bit outside their normal way home. &quot;Why do we stop, Derrick?&quot; asked Tanner confused. Derrick grinned at him. &quot;I just want my toy back. I will tell mom and dad you went to a friend and I let you out there.&quot; Tanner looked unhappy at him. &quot;Please Derrick, I don´t like being that small or unable to speak.&quot;<br />
But to stop Tanner from begging more, Derrick pushed his head down and said &quot;Speech system deactivate&quot;, to which Tanner replied with a frustrated squeak. Derrick then left the car, went over to Tanner&#39;s door and pulled him out, earning another squeak. Just as Tanner stood Derrick pushed his head again, this time saying &quot;Toy Sized Mode.&quot;<br />
It was like when he had grown back in reverse to Tanner. First his clothes returned to wherever they were stored inside his body. Then he started shrinking smaller, and as he looked down he saw his fingers merge into a plate-like shape, robbing them of their flexibility. His toes did the same. He stopped shrinking by six inches again. His mind grew foggier again, as a toy he wouldn´t need access to his memories and such, another part of the toy-sized-mode Derrick had programmed in before.<br />
<br />
Derrick grabbed him, pushed him into his pocket head first again, before getting back into the car and driving home, getting more than one squeaking noise from Tanner. After telling their parents that Tanner had gone to a friend he returned to his room with his toy-brother. He enjoyed some time with him before he went to bed, placing Tanner on the pillow next to him, pushing Tanner&#39;s head again and said: &quot;Sleep Mode Activate&quot;. Tanner could do nothing as everything inside him switched to sleep, and seconds later he was out like a light, even his mind went to a dreamless sleep, more like a stand-by mode. Derrick grinned when his brother stopped moving,indicating he was asleep before turning around himself, falling asleep after a couple of minutes, dreaming of himself playing with Tanner.<br />
When Derrick woke up the next morning he left Tanner sleeping while he showered and had breakfast with their parents. As the question came to which friend Tanner went, Derrick said he didn´t asked, but Tanner had said he would be home later that day. He returned to his room, starting the chronivac again to edit one thing. As long as Tanner was in toy-sized-mode, nobody would search for the human one, except for emergencies. That way he wouldn´t need to find excuses were Tanner was and could also decide when to change him back to human again and for how long. He wasn´t missing, nor was he no longer existing as a human, they just wouldn´t ask.<br />
<br />
The rest of the weekend Derrick enjoyed having his toy-brother around, either watching tv, playing games or speaking with Tanner. Only at Monday morning he returned Tanner to life-sized-mode and activated the speech mode so Tanner could go to school with him. Another advantage Derrick had taken was that Tanner would only remember his time in toy-sized-mode as a dream, therefore he wouldn´t complain about it. On their way Derrick said: &quot;Tanner, you won´t talk about your dreams of being my toy-brother to anyone, as you know nobody would want to hear it, bro.&quot;<br />
Having said his codeword for overwriting Tanner&#39;s thoughts again Derrick was safe. Nobody would figure out what he had done, and should someone find out he would end up as another toy. It was good that the codeword was only an accent to his normal calling of &quot;brau&quot;, so he hoped nobody would notice it.</p>
