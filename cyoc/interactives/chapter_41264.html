<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Megan was fuming as she stomped her way into the office, going straight to her computer. An evil smirk crossed her face, lately Will had become more chauvinistic than when they'd met, mostly it was due to his friends. It started with rude comments and basically humiliating her in public. This was the last straw. &quot;Lets see, I could turn him into a dog...what would that teach him...I got it. If he likes to humiliate me so much...wait until tonight.&quot; She quickly reset herself to normal, immediately the swimsuit fell loosely on her body as the increased size diminished.<br />
<br />
Working over the Chronovac, she designed a program that would slowly over the next four or five days would swap her female attributes with Will's male ones. He would become the female equivalent to himself in just four days, leaving her as the strong male, she knew this was the ultimate humiliation for Will, especially how sexist he viewed women. She did make some minor tweaks to Will's final appearance, instead of her 5'7&quot;, he would wind up shorter, more like 5'3&quot;. She finalized everything and the transformation would begin tonight, starting with what was most precious to Will. Megan had made dinner plans weeks ago with some of their mutual friends, she smirked. &quot;Tonight will be a night he'll never forget.&quot; She clicked the engage button and she immediately felt a tingle run through her.<br />
<br />
They spoke very little in the car, both looking like a million dollars, as they drove up to the swanky restaurant. They sat with their friends, having round after round of drinks. After hours of conversation, Will's now macho personality surfaced, making some rude and unnecessary comment about the female anatomy, which put an end to the women's laughter, but not the guys. Finally Will excused himself and headed toward the restroom. Embarrassed, Megan did likewise and rushed to the bathroom herself.<br />
<br />
Will stood in front of the urinal, the six beers had finally run through him and he was pissing a storm. Suddenly he felt his penis slipping backward through his fingers, back into his pants and an instant later he lost his grip on it. Before he could stop himself he had wet his pants and underwear. &quot;SHIT!&quot; Will cursed, looking down at what he'd done to himself. He quickly reached into his pants to reacquire his misplaced member only to feel it shrink to nothing and disappear into his lower abdomen.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the hell?!&quot; Will yelled as he searched his crotch, desperately trying to find his lost member. As he felt for it, what he found sent a frigid chill down his spine and he nearly passed out from shock! He glanced around, fortunately there was no one to be found, then he ran into a stall, slammed the door and hurriedly unbuckled his belt and dropped his pants. He sat down on the stool and yanked his briefs down and stared at his pubic area.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh no!&quot; Will cried as he saw a sight that nearly made him black out. A small tuft of fine curly(unlike usually, more course) pubic hair, with a  featureless expanse of skin occupied the area where his penis and scrotum once was, and further between his legs, Will saw what appeared to be a, a ... vagina!<br />
<br />
He screamed. &quot;What the fuck is going on—What has happened to me?&quot;<br />
Probing with extreme caution between his legs telling himself none of this was real, it couldn’t be happening, it was just his drinking, then his index finger felt something that seemed terribly wrong, and at the same time Will felt the touch of his finger through his labia! <br />
<br />
With morbid curiosity Will probed the strange opening in his body. The insides of his cleft were pillowy soft, moist and warm, and then his finger grazed across a small protrusion above his vagina, Will felt a sudden, intense sensation shoot through his entire body. He jerked his hand away as if were scolding hot. &quot;This can't be happening to me...&quot; Shaking his head in disbelief, he began to clean himself up so he could go face everyone at the table.<br />
<br />
Back in the ladies room, Megan walked to the stall, closed it, pulled her panties down, hiked up her skirt and sat. Sitting there, she felt an odd sensation in her groin and she looked down at herself. Smirking she knew exactly what was going to happen, she couldn't have timed it more perfectly. As she did her labia suddenly began to swell and, incredibly, she felt, then SAW her clit starting to grow and expand right out of her vagina at an incredible rate. The feeling was incredible, a mix a pleasure and discomfort. She watched in disbelief as her labia kept growing and swelling until they actually began to hang downward, resembling that of a man’s scrotum. Meanwhile her clitoris kept expanding, growing in length and thickness, until it extended an incredible distance from her abdomen. In a matter of a few moments it was transformed into a perfect looking man's penis. The size was even bigger than Will's standing at over 8 1/2 inches. Confirmation that it was a completely working penis came a moment later when a stream of urine erupted from it.<br />
<br />
Megan's hands reached out and touched her new member and discovered it was actually sensitive to her touch. She gasped at how sensitive it was. From her angle it looked even bigger than it actually was, and as she held it, it grew erect, expanding to an unbelievable length and rising up until it contacted the edge of the toilet.<br />
<br />
It was extremely odd for her now, how was she supposed to function with a penis and scrotum attached to her pubis? But it was her mess and she'd figure a way to function till the transformation was complete. Megan stood up and tried to pull her silken panties over her new penis and found it difficult to manage, even though it had softened and receded. She managed to cover it but it was a tight fit , and her pantyhose also gave her a problem. When she pulled it up to her waist her penis and scrotum felt cramped and pinched. But there was nothing she could do about it and she decided the best thing to do was to get home quickly. Fortunately for her, her full, pleated skirt concealed her incredible new addition, but she knew that until she was completely male she would have problems with her clothes. She opened the stall, walked to the sink and washed her hands.  <br />
<br />
Strangely enough, as she looked into the mirror she appeared just as feminine as when she walked into the room. No sign of her new potency was visible but she felt different somehow, more alive, more ... vital, and though she was very nervous about walking out of the ladies room with her masculine equipment she wasn’t afraid of the &quot;thing&quot; itself. She even smiled slightly as she thought of the power concealed beneath her skirt. She walked into the dining area and toward her friends, taking a seat, she smirkingly waited for Will to return.<br />
<br />
Will had yet to return because he was still in shock and terrified. He was barely able to maintain his grip on reality. Aside from that he had a real mess to attend to and cleaning himself up wasn’t easy under the circumstances. When the room was clear he quickly left the stall and ran to the sinks where he grabbed two fistfuls of paper towels. After wetting one of the wads of towels he rushed back to the stall, slammed the door and removed his pants so he could pull off his briefs. He set his jockey shorts on the floor near the back of the stall and, after washing down his legs, he began to work on his pants. He dampened them then dried them as much as he could with the dry towels and put them on again. They were still damp, and they smelled slightly of urine, but there was only so much he could do. Fortunately the dark color hid the wet spot pretty well.<br />
<br />
He was interrupted in his efforts when someone walked into the room,  he sat very still while he waited for the guy to leave. When he was alone again he went to the sink, washed his hands and stepped over to the hand dryer. He chose the low mounted dryer, intended for use of wheelchair bound patrons and adjusted the air flow toward the dampness on his pants. Finally his pants were dry and he decided it was time to return to his friends before they thought something was up.<br />
<br />
Will felt an awfully funny sensation as he walked back to the table. His crotch felt &quot;empty&quot; without the familiar swinging organ, and his slacks were also too loose for comfort. He felt as though the whole room was watching him. He also sensed that there was something wrong with the way he was walking but he did not know just what it was. When he rejoined he did his best to act like nothing was wrong, but he was too preoccupied to follow the conversation and it was obvious that he was distracted. He caught Megan glaring at him strangely, as if she sensed something was wrong and he nearly panicked, barely managing to calm himself. He also did not feel like drinking anymore. He needed to think straight to figure out what was happening and more booze wouldn’t help.<br />
<br />
After a few moments she announced that she didn’t feel very well and when she asked to go home Will was eager to oblige her. Once more sitting in silence, this time for an entirely different reason. When they got back to the Mansion Megan grabbed her nightgown and robe and went into the bathroom, leaving Will by himself in the bedroom. She quickly undressed and got her first real good look at her new phallus. It looked even larger than it had in the ladies room. Both her penis and her scrotum were incredibly sensitive, and even her pubic hair looked masculine—long and thick compared to her former, short and curly hair.<br />
<br />
The more she examined herself the more fascinated she became. She’d only touched two other penises in her life, Will’s and that boy in high school, and that was always in the dark where she had felt it more than seen it. This was completely different. For one thing it was her penis, and she took the time to examine every inch of it from different angles, even looking at herself in the mirror. She discovered that it grew hard and erect with literally no effort at all, and she stared at it in fascination as she watched it quickly double in size and harden to absolute rigidity for the second time that night.<br />
<br />
The look of a stiff penis sticking straight out from her crotch was amazing and strangely compelling, and Megan was unable to take her eyes off it. The rest of her body was still the sexy smooth one she'd had all her life. A few minutes later, after it had receded, she felt the need to relieve herself and instinctively turned around to sit on the toilet, but as she did it occurred to her that she didn’t have to sit down! Now she could stand up, like guys did, and the idea intrigued her. She couldn't resist trying it out for the first of many times to follow, she turned and faced the toilet and lifted the seat. At first she held herself carefully with both hands, like little boys do, but after a moment she found she could direct the stream with one hand and soon she was tracing patterns in the toilet bowl and she giggled with delight as she moved the stream back and forth. The sound was a lot louder than when she sat down but it was also a lot more interesting.<br />
<br />
Megan turned as she heard a soft knock at the door followed by Will’s voice. &quot;Hon, I need to get in there,&quot; he said in a subdued voice. She replied, &quot;I’ll be out in a minute,&quot; and shook herself dry and began to dress. She put on her sexy black silk nightgown and wrapped herself in her robe then opened the door. &quot;It’s all yours,&quot; she said as she passed him in the hall, and Will nodded but did not look her in the eyes as he passed her and closed the door. This made Megan smirk as she knew he was already humiliated at this point.<br />
<br />
Megan waited outside the door for a moment until she heard the sound of the toilet seat being lowered. She smiled to herself once more, that was the cherry on her sundae. Megan walked to the bedroom.<br />
<br />
Will finished relieving himself from a seated position since there didn’t seem to be any other way considering his situation. He too examined himself, but unlike Megan, he hadn't been expecting this transformation and he wasn’t fascinated by what he saw, he was horrified. He spread his legs apart to get a good look at his new vagina and when he did there was no doubt that it was real, he’d seen enough of them to know. Between the labia majoris there was another, smaller pair of pinkish lips that guarded the gate to his vaginal canal, and even his masculine pubic hair had been replaced by a small, triangular patch of short, curly feminine fuzz. He already knew he had a clitoris and he shrank from any further inspection.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can't believe I have a fucking cunt!&quot; He muttered to himself in disbelief. He was mystified at how this had happened to him, outraged that it had happened, and completely mortified, all at once. He was also determined that nobody, absolutely nobody would ever find out what had happened. For one thing it would make him a complete joke, especially at his work. He could already hear the things his &quot;friends&quot; and acquaintances would say about him if they found out—and his ego simply could not stand that! The other reason this had to be a secret was Will was convinced that if the government somehow found out they’d turn him into some sort of a lab rat for experiments, if not to find out what happened then as part of some &quot;gender experiment.&quot; That would be equally intolerable. Then there was the chance that some bastard would want to rape him and Will didn’t want to have to go through life fighting off perverts!<br />
<br />
Will grabbed a fresh pair of briefs and his pajama bottoms from the dresser but before he changed he needed a shower. He stilled smelled faintly of urine and he had also noticed a strong &quot;fishy&quot; smell emanating from his vagina, which was worse than the urine as far as Dale was concerned. He checked to make sure the door was closed and locked then turned on the shower and stepped in. He had absolutely no idea how to wash a vagina and after some deliberation he decided to use soap on a washcloth and simply rub the cloth over his pubis. When he was finished Will dried himself and quickly pulled on his briefs, then pulled on his pajama bottoms and left the bathroom.<br />
<br />
After an hour of messing around with her new appendage in a separate room, Megan walked to their bedroom, and after confirming that Will was now sound asleep, she sat on the bed next to Will. She could barely contain her excitement and realized that she hadn’t felt this way since their first date. She had planned what she wanted to do carefully but there were a few unknowns and she had guessed about several important things. She wasn’t sure this would work but she was willing to risk it and there was an incredible exhilaration in being the aggressor!<br />
<br />
Will was curled up with his back to her and Megan slowly began by kissing his cheek and ear very softly while she stroked his thigh lightly. Will did not wake up but he rolled onto his back, which was exactly what Megan was hoping for, and she kissed his ear again and put her arm across his waist. Will turned toward her and she caressed his shoulder and ran her hand down his side to his hip. Then Megan moved lower. She breathed warmly on one of Will’s nipples before flicking her tongue across it while she caressed his bottom.<br />
<br />
Megan had found in her own exploration of her body that her nipples were not nearly as sensitive as they had been before, and was betting that despite Will’s overall masculine appearance he would respond to the same stimuli that a woman would,otherwise there would be no way to seduce him because she knew a guy’s sexual gratification is centered in his cock, and since he was now minus that, it would have to work.<br />
<br />
Will opened his eyes, though he was still mostly asleep. In his foggy state he felt something wonderful and after a while he realized Megan was hovering over his chest running her tongue across his nipples. It felt really nice and he smiled to himself and lay absolutely still, content to simply let her continue. The events of the previous evening were completely forgotten since he had been still mostly intoxicated and Will did not have any idea why Megan was doing what she was, but it felt so good he didn’t care.<br />
<br />
Then Megan straddled him in her nightgown, bent over him and kissed him deeply. Will responded avidly and as they kissed he felt her hands on his chests, kneading his pectoral muscles gently and occasionally grasping his nipples and playing with them. That too felt great, and Will sighed softly, wondering why Megan had never done that to him before, and why he never realized how good it felt. He'd make sure she kept this in their sexual encounters. His whole body seemed unusually sensitive tonight and when Megan bent low and sucked on his nipples he gasped as an electric sensation spread from his chest to his belly and thighs, all the way to his toes. His back arched upward and his arms found Megan’s neck and he pulled her down onto his chest. <br />
<br />
Megan was excited, she had guessed right on, and Will was responding just like a woman! She felt her new phallus grow hard as a rock and it took all her self-control to go slowly and give Will the full treatment. She wanted to savor every moment, knowing that Will had yet to realize what was happening she want this to be memorable.<br />
<br />
Will could feel Megan gently sliding his briefs down his legs, caressing him lightly as she eased them off, and he felt a shiver of delight at her sensuous touch. He looked up at her pretty face hovering over him and smiled dreamily, content to let her take the initiative. He decided to let her handle the preliminaries, then he would roll her over at the right moment and finish the job. There would be plenty of time for that—later—but for now he felt too good to interrupt her. Sandy’s touch felt heavenly, and when she traced her hands along his thighs lightly Will moaned with delight. Her fingers felt as light as feathers and it was just wonderful! He felt Megan kneel between his legs and was surprised when they automatically parted. He was breathing heavily now and as Will’s fingers inched ever closer to his groin he felt a curious sensation, almost a dampness, between his legs. His knees flexed slightly and Will was puzzled for a moment, but he was quickly distracted by his girlfriend’s hands moving to his shoulders and gliding down his chest in an erotic massage.<br />
<br />
Megan gazed down at her slightly feminized boyfriend and studied his appearance. She realized that Will’s nipples were slightly larger than normal and as erect as they could be for their size. Even his aureole were a little larger, a shade darker and more convex than they had been. They weren’t exactly feminine, and a casual observer would never notice the difference, but there was a change. She allowed her long hair to brush across Will’s miniature titties and grinned when he gasped and arched his back. She leaned forward and kissed him, holding his head in her hands while she carefully held her penis away from him. He still didn’t know what was happening, but he was about to get an education!<br />
<br />
Will was confused by the incredible, new sensations that threatened to overwhelm him. The marvelous feelings seemed to come in rapid succession, leaving him no chance to interpret one sensation before another wonderful experience took its place. He was dimly aware that something was very strange, very wrong, but he felt too fantastic to worry about it. He was completely aroused now, yet he felt no desire to take control. He was perfectly content to let Megan continue touching him. She seemed to know exactly what to do to please him, and something influenced him to remain passive.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, Will felt Megan's hand begin to caress his groin, and as she moved closer to his crotch he felt a completely unique and foreign sensation. Her fingers seemed to consciously avoid his masculine parts somehow and touch something that couldn’t possibly exist! At that instant the events of the evening came back to him in a rush and Will gasped when he realized that Megan now knew his shameful secret! Then, before he could do anything, he felt something hard pushing against the vertical slit that had magically replaced his penis and scrotum! It was hard, but warm and felt like velvet covered steel. Will tried to react, to push Megan away, but she was too fast and too strong for him! She pinned his shoulders to the bed, and before Will knew what was happening, he felt his labia being forced apart and his vagina being penetrated by his own girlfriend! Somehow she now had a phallus!<br />
<br />
Will yelped out in terror and confusion, unable to comprehend what was happening even as Megan rammed deep within him! Will felt a brief, tearing sensation and a sharp pain, and he gasped as he felt his vagina being stretched and dilated by his girlfriend’s huge phallus! Megan's face was mixed with pride and excitement at Will's sudden realization.<br />
<br />
&quot;NOOO!&quot; He cried as he felt Megan fill his void fully and completely. He tried to move, to squirm and twist away, but he was absolutely impaled by Megan’s cock, and for some reason he couldn’t seem to get enough leverage to throw her off! He gasped for air and pushed up on Megan’s hips but she ground down on him and Will felt as if she would split him in two or drive her member right through him!<br />
<br />
&quot;STOP! PLEASE DON’T...&quot; He begged, his eyes filling with tears from the pain and the shame. <br />
<br />
But Megan was relentless! She withdrew slightly only to plunge into him again, and again! Will felt the incredible, completely foreign sensation of her penis moving within him and the friction it created against his vaginal walls. The pain eased quite suddenly and Will felt a dampness develop inside him that allowed Megan to glide back and forth effortlessly. A strange yet wonderful warmth seemed to spread through him, and then Will felt an electric pulse spark from his groin and flood his entire body!<br />
<br />
Another, stronger pulse followed rapidly, then another and another, each stronger and more pleasurable than the last! Will moaned and felt his hips grind upward to meet his Megan’s thrusts! He had no control at all! Megan was the one in command and she was drilling him mercilessly, nailing him to the mattress. Will’s moans grew louder and he began thrashing about beneath Megan, yet she was able to control him easily and continue her assault on his newly-acquired vagina. Will was lost and confused, but he could not help responding to Megan. Finally he felt an incredible eruption within him and a thunderous, explosive orgasm struck like a force of nature! Will screamed with pure Ecstasy and wrapped his legs around Megan’s, completely unaware he was panting YESSS! OH YESSS!<br />
<br />
Will lay dazed and stunned, to weak to move, marveling at the glorious sensations that seemed to continue long after his volcanic orgasm. He was only vaguely aware that Sandy had withdrawn from him, and he turned onto his side and squeezed his legs together in a very feminine posture as he drifted off to sleep.</p>
