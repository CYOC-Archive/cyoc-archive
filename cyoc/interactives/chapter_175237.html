<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">In a frantic rush, four foot tall 40 something June began working harder than she had in years. She began with the trees, the tallest thing, and rushed to the garage to grab Mark&#39;s folding ladder. By the time she maneuvered it out of the garage door and into the yard, fighting to carry the long and awkward aluminum, she realized Ty&#39;s clothes were even looser on her. With a start, she cinched the waist belt again and grabbed the pruning sheers, scrambling up the ladder at a near jog and quickly snipping down the branches hanging over into the neighbor&#39;s yard. By the time she did the first of three trees, she gulped as she realized she had to snug the belt again. The shirt was hanging off of her. The pant legs were snagging her feet. She quickly rolled them up and hit the next tree, sweating hard from the exertion. Again, by the time she was done with that tree, she was smaller. A few inches? Easily. She rubbed hot sweat out of her eyes, threw back her long hair, and hit the third and final tree. She was already exhausted, but the constant threat of winding up publically naked and tiny was enough motivation.<br />
<br />
June quickly knocked the ladder down, folded it up, and put all of her effort in as she scrambled back to the garage and quickly tidied up the junk and tools Mark had left lying around. She grabbed the old metal push mower and wheeled it into the yard, satisfied the garage was done to an obvious improvement.<br />
<br />
She hiked up the pants, noticed the shirt was more like a low hanging blouse now, and whimpered as she realized she still had a lot to do. She took a deep breath, got down on her hands and knees, and started pulling weeds up.<br />
<br />
Ty watched from the kitchen window in pure delight as decreasing June gave it everything she had. Whether it was determination, fear, or something else, he couldn&#39;t quite tell, but watching his little step mom work as hard as she could even as her body dwindled down was incredibly sexy. He found himself sporting wood as he noted that halfway through the weeds she was inching closer to three foot nothing.<br />
<br />
Outside, June was shaking from the physical exertion. As she cleared over half the yard, she knew that time was working against her. With each weed she pulled up, she found it a little harder to get a solid grip and yank them up. Her strength was diminishing along with her size, making the job take longer.<br />
<br />
She cursed herself for the many cruel tasks she made Ty do. She knew he was right and payback was in order. It increased her resolve. She wanted to prove to him she could be more than his cunty step mom. She knew they could be such a great couple and have so much dirty fun together. She pressed herself harder, panting with exhaustion, dripping hot sweat, her muscles aching from the work out they never got. She saw she was getting closer to the high brown fence on the other side of the yard and with arms and legs shaking in muscle failure she made it to he old brown fence. With a cry of relief, she quickly darted to the mower, realizing she was falling below child size, and with a tremendous effort, she reached up, grabbed the mower, and literally ran at it to begin cutting down the grass. Luckily it was dry and relatively shorter than it usually was due to the lack of rain. She pushed the mower with gritted teeth, stopping only to pull up her pants and roll the cuffs up to the knee. In great panting strides, she wheeled the mower around like a demon, giving it everything her tiny body had.<br />
<br />
A rush of adrenaline kicked in and June smiled in defiance, laughing maniacally as her voice started to raise again, realizing she was close to her goal. As she mowed down the last of the grass in the yard, she pulled the mower back into the garage behind her and emerged with a garbage bag. She snapped it open, more like a tarp to her now, and frantically grabbed clumps of weeds and cut grass. Two and a half feet. She began to feel tired and lost some of her pace. As she cleared the last of the yard, she felt a little dizzy as she lugged the huge heavy garbage bag to the side gate and dragged it there, too small to reach the latch. The pants fell off completely. She gasped and kicked them away, completely naked from the waist down and startled by the warm afternoon air on her nethers and her ass.<br />
<br />
No time to stop. She glanced around and saw nobody watching, so she hit the flower beds. She picked up chunks of debris, grabbed up the last of the weeds with both hands and much struggling, and found that the shirt was now a hindrance. Fuck it. She tossed off the shirt at nearly two feet tall and let her hot naked flesh take in the breeze.<br />
<br />
From the window, Ty&#39;s jaw dropped as the little nude form of June, dripping glistening beads of sweat, continued to work to near exhaustion, tidying up the flowers, dragging over a massive watering can and drenching them, all before she got too small to do so.<br />
<br />
Finally, falling under two feet again, June took a look around the yard and stared in amazement at her surroundings. With the work done, in under an hour and half no less, she put her hands on her hips and took some pride in the job she had done, all while shrinking smaller and smaller.<br />
<br />
She turned back to the house, alarmed, and looked around in wonderment as a giant garden loomed to her side. She saw a lady bug the size of a mouse and gaped in disbelief. She paused again, taking stock of herself, and realized she was getting close to twelve inches again.<br />
<br />
The door opened suddenly, making her turn in shock, and Ty bounded out. He stepped in front of June, watching her panting, hot, sweaty, and out of breath, and offered his hand to her. With a cocky grin, the tiny woman took Ty&#39;s hand and they shook gently.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not bad, shorty.&quot; Ty smirked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not bad?&quot; June squeaked, &quot;I should get a medal for that performance!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ll see.&quot; Ty grinned, letting June keep shrinking, now *below* doll size and getting closer to the size of an action figure as he gently took her in his hand and securely wrapped his fingers around her. He walked over, grabbed the clothes from the yard, shut the garage door after a quick inspection, and grinned.<br />
<br />
When he looked back at his hand, he saw June slipping down into his closed fingers. She was now below four inches tall and looking quite startled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh... Ty?&quot; She looked up, her voice even higher, becoming so high pitched she sounded like she had sucked in a ton of helium.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, don&#39;t worry.&quot; He smiled down, walking back towards the house with his clothes bunched up under his arm. &quot;I&#39;ll stop you before you disapear.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;O-Okay...&quot; June squeaked, tumbling down into Ty&#39;s closed hand and staring up from the shade inside.</p>
