<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kent looked over the character sheet. The sheet itself doesn&#39;t seem to have any limits to it, but he still hadn&#39;t cracked open any of the sourcebooks. Although it seems like the system encourages making a character up-front then figuring out how they work in the engine.<br />
<br />
Given that this was just to explore the character creation system, Kent decided he could build an out-there character that had been in the back of his mind for a while but is definitely too fetishy for his group.<br />
<br />
Name: Lillian Cummings, the Lustbringer<br />
<br />
Lillian blinked. He must have spaced out and written his own name in the character name section. And in pen, too. Oh well, usually he&#39;d come up with some pun name but for a test character his own name would be fine. He&#39;d even added that stupid title that people keep calling him, despite his perpetual status as single.<br />
Speaking of test, Lillian thought, how about testing how the system handles a mix of an anthro race and demon.<br />
<br />
Race: Skunkfolk half-Incubus<br />
<br />
A dizzy spell swept over Lillian, and once it passed he decided to go get some water. He got up and made his way to the kitchen, scratching at a horn. The human cups are hard to use without spilling a bunch of water on himself, so Lillian filled up a bottle with a smaller opening. Catching a glimpse of himself in the mirror, he briefly messed with the longer &#39;hair&#39; fur atop his head, patting it down around his small, curved horns. <br />
Through the wall he could taste a bit of arousal from next door, a solo flavor of masturbation. Between that and the water, Lillian felt his energy increasing.<br />
His tail flicked up and he let out a small fart, glad that he lives alone as ignorant humans get really grossed out by that. It&#39;s not like he was spraying, they&#39;re two very different functions but most humans don&#39;t understand that.<br />
Sitting back down, Lillian noted that he had written down his own racial background for the character again. Weird, usually he goes for something different.<br />
<br />
Sex: Male<br />
<br />
Lillian typically played guys, no reason to change it up. He briefly considered playing a girl or even going for an intersex character, but decided against it. Besides, the orientation would be the more interesting thing to roleplay, in his mind. Pick something different from himself. He was straight, even if he&#39;ll feed off ambient sexual energy from other men, and the rare opportunities he does get with women always has him taking a more dominant role.<br />
<br />
Orientation: Pansexual, bottom<br />
<br />
Moving to a seat where he could better collect energy from next door, he savored the taste. Idly accepting a few matches on his various hook-up apps Lillian thinks over the next section of the character sheet.<br />
<br />
Personality: a bit of an airhead, he prefers to solve problems non-violently. He makes friends (and friends with benefits) easily, which is rare for a Skunkfolk. He&#39;s driven by a desire to find great treasures, the fastest way to his heart is a shiny trinket, a lead on where to find more, and a good assfucking. He sometimes gets taken advantage of, but letting the guards have their way with him keeps him out of jail.<br />
<br />
Lillian blinks, drawing his focus back to the paper in front of him and away from daydreaming about getting railed from behind. The part-incubus undoes his pants, and he begins to masturbate. <br />
Cum splashed against the bottom of his table, and Lillian took a deep breath. Post-nut clarity gave him the focus to reread the personality of his character. Very similar to his own personality, Lillian thinks they&#39;d probably be friends. But two bottoms wouldn&#39;t really have the chance to be much more than that. Actually... If the two of them were both bottoming for a group, face to face, delirious from pleasure... staring into the eyes of another skunkfolk...<br />
Another splash of cum against the floor brings Lillian to his senses again, and he decides to quickly write down the &#39;additional notes&#39; for his character while his mind is clear. <br />
<br />
Additional Notes: -His incubus heritage has infused his spray with pheromones that induce arousal and lower inhibitions. Being directly sprayed causes an orgasm that lasts until the spray wears off. <br />
-His asshole also acts as a pocket storage, where he stores the treasures and cum he collects during his adventures. The cum remains fresh no matter how long it stays in his ass. A young dragon is interested in making Lillian&#39;s ass his lair.<br />
-A magic bracelet causes his asshole to automatically suck in gold and cum in a cone-shaped area behind him. The bracelet also allows him to fire coins from his asshole as a long range attack. Because of this and his tendency to get drawn into sex, he rarely wears anything that significantly restricts access to his ass. <br />
<br />
Lillian the Lustbringer reviewed the character sheet, absently pulling a couple coins out of his ass to rub together. He really did just end up writing himself, although that&#39;s not the worst thing. After all, self inserts are tried and true in roleplay, and he doesn&#39;t know how he&#39;d play someone more focused or less friendly than himself.<br />

Setting his paper down, Lillian reaches towards the sourcebooks to finally read it</p>
