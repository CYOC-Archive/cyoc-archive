<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I started at the ceiling for what felt like an eternity.  I have a tendency to worry myself too much, and <br />
that’s exactly what I did at this point.  I wondered if Nicole would ever forgive me.  I wondered if she’d <br />
even talk to me again.  Had I destroyed our relationship?  Could either of us survive without the other?  I <br />
wanted to leap off the couch and force my way into her room so that I could literally beg at her feet.  But <br />
again I realized that I’d done enough harm.  I would just have to wait for her.<br />
<br />
At long last I heard her door open.  I did not move as I heard her walk back into the living room.  Once she <br />
was visible I slowly brought my eyes to match hers.  She had evidence of tears covering her face and she still <br />
looked very upset.  “Let me sit down please,” she said in a weak voice.  I did as she asked and moved to one <br />
end of the couch.  Rather than sitting on the opposite end, she actually sat right next to me.  She did not <br />
look at me, however.  “Joe,” she said.  “Please tell me you know why I’m so upset.”<br />
<br />
I chose not to look at her either as I answered, “Because I violated you.”<br />
<br />
“And how did you do that?” she asked.<br />
<br />
I recognized this as one of her trick questions.  There was the wrong way, the right way and the Nicole way to <br />
answer this question.  I opted for the Nicole way.  “By making you naked in public where others could see <br />
you.” I answered.<br />
<br />
She sniffled.  “Dammit,” she said.  “I was hoping you’d say something else.”<br />
<br />
“What else is there to say?” I replied.  “I did something horrible, no matter who remembers it.”<br />
<br />
“Yes, yes you did,” she said.  She sniffled again and out of the corner of my eye I saw her wipe the bottom of <br />
her eyes.  “Joe, I need to apologize to you.”<br />
<br />
I jerked up my head and looked at her.  “What?” I asked confusedly.<br />
<br />
“I mean it,” she said.  “I wasn’t just mad at you, but I took it all out on you.”  <br />
<br />
“Why…what else made you mad?” I asked her.<br />
<br />
“Just…everything” she answered.  “I’m frustrated with life.  I’m tired of going on dates and not getting <br />
anywhere.  But…”  Her voice trailed off.  She tried to say something but no words emerged.  She looked up at <br />
me.  “I’ve realized something,” she said.  “And…it’s terrified me.”<br />
<br />
I was worried.  Not only had I never seen her this emotional, outside of our parent’s deaths, but also she had <br />
never said anything like this before.  “What is it?” I asked.  “What’s terrified you?”<br />
<br />
A single tear fell out of her eye.  “This,” she said.  She leaned into me, took my face in her hands and <br />
kissed me on the lips.  But this was not a normal kiss.  It wasn’t a sibling kiss, either.  This was a full <br />
on, completely passionate kiss.  It was the kind of kiss you would give your lover.  My immediate instinct was <br />
to pull away but I could not since she held me in place.  Instead I did the thing I least expected to do.  I <br />
returned the kiss.  Soon our arms were wrapped around each other and we explored each other’s mouths with our <br />
tongues.<br />
<br />
All reason left my body and I acted on pure instinct.  As we continued to make out I put my legs back up on <br />
the couch so that I was in a prone position.  Nicole began to place herself on top of me.  She lifted off my <br />
T-shirt and ran her delicate hands over my chest.  She took hold of her own T-shirt and pulled it up and over <br />
her beautiful long brown hair to reveal her bare breasts.  She took my hands and placed them on her D-cups.  I <br />
massaged them in my hands and squeezed her nipples with my fingers.<br />
<br />
She slid her shorts off her hips to reveal that she was not wearing any panties.  I ran my hands down her <br />
stomach and toward her womanhood.  Her hands stopped me from realizing that goal and so I instead reached <br />
around and groped her tight ass.  She leaned down on top of my and we resumed kissing each other.  I groaned <br />
in slight discomfort, not because she was on top of me, but because my pants began to feel tight.  <br />
<br />
Nicole got the hint and she yanked my shorts and boxers off my body.  My cock was fully erect and it felt as <br />
if it could go at any time.  If I had been able to think normally I probably would have tried to stop <br />
everything right here.  But I was not thinking normally and so I eagerly awaited Nicole’s next move.  She <br />
crawled back on top of me and straddled my body.  She lowered herself onto my waiting cock and began to ride <br />
me.<br />
<br />
She jumped up and down on my cock in such a way that I didn’t have to do any work myself.  I took the <br />
opportunity to explore her exquisite body with my hands.  I alternated between teasing her breasts and <br />
fondling her ass.  Her moaning told me that she enjoyed everything that I did to her.  <br />
<br />
Suddenly Nicole screamed out in ecstasy even though I had not yet climaxed.  She removed herself from my cock <br />
just as I came and the result was that I shot onto her breasts and torso.  She opened her eyes and looked down <br />
at herself.  Then she looked at me.  She grabbed my by the shoulders, pulled me up and planted another hard <br />
kiss on my lips.  I noticed, however, that her face looked pained and I could swear I saw another tear roll <br />
out of her eye.  <br />
<br />
She ended the kiss and released my shoulders, which caused me to fall back down on the couch.  She got off the <br />
couch, gathered her clothes and ran out of the room.  Once again I heard the sound of her bedroom door slam <br />
shut.  I looked at myself to see if any of my lode got onto me when she picked me up.  It did not appear that <br />
any had.  I sat up on the couch and sat there for a moment, more than a little dumbfounded as to what we just <br />
did.  <br />
<br />
A few minutes went by and Nicole did not return to the room.  I gathered up my own clothes and, after turning <br />
off all the other lights, went to my own bedroom.  Just before I entered I stopped and looked at Nicole’s <br />
door.  I could not tell if the light was on or not.  I walked to the door and was about to just walk right in, <br />
but again I stopped.  I heard a soft sound coming from inside.  As silently as I could I pressed my ear to the <br />
door.  I heard Nicole crying softly.  I slowly backed away from the door and returned to my room.<br />
<br />
I cleaned myself up a little in my own bathroom.  All I could think about was what just happened.  I was not <br />
actually concerned with the physical side.  I was worried about the mental aspect.  She told me she was <br />
terrified of a feeling, then acted upon it.  I was her willing partner and the end result was just more <br />
crying.  For the first time in my life, I could not figure out what was going on inside my twin sister’s mind.  <br />
As I put on a pair of shorts and climbed into bed, all I could think was that my world would be much worse <br />
tomorrow.</p>
