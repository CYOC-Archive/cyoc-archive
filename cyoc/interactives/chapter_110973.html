<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff immediately remembered camping somewhere where there were cow pies everywhere and they were pretty big for the most part. He imagined at a farm where the cows graze and he was laying there just basking in the sun as a fresh living pie just doing nothing all day. He typed in his host to be a cow from a farm and he sat there and pondered on if he should do it. He took a deep breath and pressed the enter key.<br />
A window popped up say if he wanted to go with it. He skimmed it and pressed yes and waited for his transformation. <br />
He started to feel weak, so weak in fact that he couldn&#39;t hold his body up at all. Everything around turned to nothing and he couldn&#39;t see anything even his body. He still felt everything but nothing was there. His mind became to be filled with nothing, but only a name: Jeff.<br />
He began to be filled with new memories like the day he was born. He sprung with new life when he was inside a cow&#39;s rectum. He was not aware on what he was or that no creature tolerated his figure. Everything was new to him, a soul stuck as a cow&#39;s dung inside of a rectum where it would be a better place to manage than anything else as a lump of shit.<br />
Every other shit ever made in the entire earth only was named &#39;shit&#39; which has become derogatory. This lump was something else and special and was able to think for himself.<br />
The cow pie now known as Jeff was able to feel and started to notice something wrong with his environment. He was steaming hot, but did not know what hot or cold meant. He wanted to get out. He didn&#39;t like it all and with very little effort he wiggled around trying to panic.<br />
There was a loud noise, he was now experiencing sound, something that he wasn&#39;t able to explain it for the first time. He felt the wall around him loosen up. With a rush of the end of the cow&#39;s digestive system it did the last step was to expel the waste and that was the end. For Jeff this was his beginning.<br />
Jeff flopped down in a huge pile now looking up to the world outside of a cow&#39;s anus. He was now experiencing sight and he could look at the sky and the sunshine as he saw where he came from, and there was more coming out of the hole he was born. He was this small living thing looking up to a cow that is larger than life. He understood that this was his mother and she was suppose to take care of him. He wasn&#39;t able to understand color yet either so being brown wasn&#39;t something that bothered him.<br />
The cow was done with him now, but Jeff didn&#39;t want to see his mother go, he cried for her. The cow stopped and looked behind her not paying attention to Jeff at all but what was making that noise. Looking around she couldn&#39;t find any calves crying, though it sounded more like a bull calf. It was faint, but it could still be heard. She went back to eating the grass and doing whatever she did best.<br />
As her head was down she could hear the crying get slightly more louder. She looked around again, still not paying Jeff any attention. Jeff cried louder. The cow walked with her head in the grass looking for what was making the noise. She began to be slightly annoyed and was wanting to stamp whatever it was. She grew closer to Jeff, who was still crying, as she looked and actually saw him. She felt a little disgusted at first, but she noticed something... the patty smelled great like a new bloomed flower in the spring. She went closer to it a sniffed it.<br />
It was weird for newly born Jeff to see his mother&#39;s face and wasn&#39;t sure what to think of it. Not knowing what was a head or a butt, even though he didn&#39;t have any of those himself. He still felt his mother&#39;s affection so he stopped crying and loudly giggled not knowing of course how to use his vocal chords or whatever he used.<br />
The cow seemed to find this to be funny. Of course she didn&#39;t think that her turd had talked, that would be too crazy. She believed to think something was under it trying to get out. Although with all the laughter she didn&#39;t know what to think exactly. She raised her hoof up over the pile of crud and pushed down onto it. Instead of splattering everywhere it absorbed her impact and pushed around her hoof. A little surprised she took her hoof out of the heap and found absolutely no trace of it any where on her hoof. She began to prance over the thing hoping to solve what was going on.<br />
Jeff actually liked it. He didn&#39;t know what was going on, but it felt ticklish to him. That was something nobody could explain the first time being tickled. He felt joy spread throughout his body every time she stomped on top of him.<br />
She gave up and still noticed none of the crud clung to her hooves. She could hear laughing as she dipped her head down by the dung pile again. This time she was giving more attention to Jeff.<br />
Jeff kept giggling not knowing how to stop being happy or excited. He felt like he was missing something though. Something to touch his mother.<br />
The cow had the truth floating around in her head for a few moments, but she couldn&#39;t believe it. How could she find out if this pile of shit was actually able to laugh and cry. She breathed over the pile which Jeff giggled again feeling warmth again not sure how to describe it yet either.<br />
&quot;What are you?&quot; She said softly and looked to see if anyone noticed her.<br />
Jeff then made a bunch of giggles and coos that sounded only of a baby trying to talk.<br />
&quot;This is dumb. I&#39;m speaking to a turd that smells like flowers.&quot; She whispered hopefully to herself and turned away from Jeff not wanting anything to do with him. Jeff began to cry for help, but the cow was tuning him out. Something inside his newly functioning mind he was able to pick up new intellectual. He had no words to describe how he felt about her and he did not know what to say to her. Panicked he found a word to shout out to her.<br />
&quot;Mommy!&quot; Jeff yelled with all his might that she might notice him. The cow froze and slowly turned her head. She could not believe everything that was happening to her. The noise definitely came from the dung heap, but how? Did it call me mom?<br />
She trotted over to Jeff now looking at him with more love than she&#39;s ever given to a cow pie before.<br />
&quot;How can you talk?&quot; She lowered her head and whispered to Jeff.<br />
&quot;Mommy.&quot; Jeff cried with joy, now being able to look at his mother again.<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not your mommy.&quot;<br />
&quot;Mommy.&quot;<br />
She looked sick to even call Jeff her calf. Though she never had a calf before. She soon felt huge regret for this turd all the sudden. She thought about how no animal would want to go near him and there will be no one to comfort him or talk to him. She looked at this as a mother&#39;s duty to take care of this life and care for him like a mother should. She smiled broadly showing Jeff her complete love for him.<br />
&quot;Mommy&#39;s here.&quot; She whispered so slightly that sent a warm feeling over Jeff now making him giggle. &quot;Alright, what should I call you?&quot; She never planned on a calf of her own so she couldn&#39;t think of a name for it. She didn&#39;t even know what gender it was. As though Jeff was able to know what she was saying, the very first thought that ever went into his head was,<br />
&quot;Jeff&quot;<br />
&quot;Hmm, Jeff, does ring my bell a bit. Yes, Jeff sounds nice. Jeff, you&#39;re my cutie pie.&quot; She sung as he finally was greeted nicely in this new world to Jeff.<br />
As a cow can move and walk, it was hard to know what to do with an inanimate object that can&#39;t do anything, but sit in the sun. She then blew into him creating lots of laughter and joy from Jeff.<br />
However, the human Jeff wasn&#39;t able to set up a time to go back as a human. This might possibly make him as an actual cow pie forever. What time did the Chronivac set the time?</p>
