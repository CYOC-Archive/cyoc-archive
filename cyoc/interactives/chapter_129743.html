<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The family was worried. Jasper got dressed in human clothes and went to eat human food. He was awkward at it at first but then his memories of Jared came back. When the family was assured that Jared was completely Jared, they tried to understand what had happened.<br />
<br />
Jared explained, &quot;It&#39;s not like I ceased to exist. When I became Jasper, Jasper&#39;s mind was there but I continued to be aware of everything, even Jasper&#39;s thoughts. I was just extremely relaxed, more relaxed than I have ever been. I was content to just let Jasper be but now that I&#39;m human again, Jasper&#39;s mind is fading from me. I&#39;m not sure if he&#39;s relaxing the way I did when I was a horse or if his mind only goes with his body.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kevin asked, &quot;Do you remember the communication cards I made?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jared said, &quot;Vaguely. I was aware of them at the time but all my memories of being a horse are fading just like Jasper&#39;s mind. All I remember is being extremely relaxed.&quot;<br />
<br />
They went on to talk about whether Jared would be willing to be a horse again but since Jared couldn&#39;t remember anything negative about the experience, he said, &quot;Sure, when I&#39;m not busy with something else, I&#39;ll be a horse.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jared&#39;s dad said, &quot;That won&#39;t work son. You need to think of this like a job. You need to be a horse when we have customers that want to ride a horse or hook a horse up to a wagon.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jared asked, &quot;You mean I can&#39;t have time to do anything?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jared&#39;s dad said, &quot;No, we&#39;ll work out a compromise. Just like a job, you can have two days off, Sunday and Monday, plus additional days for approved reasons but Friday and Saturday are when we will have the most customers so expect to be a horse nearly every Friday and Saturday until 5:00 p.m. If we have a lack of customers, I&#39;ll get to ride Jasper.&quot;<br />
<br />
They negotiated until they came to a deal. Mostly the deal was about how much money Jared expected to give up his Saturdays. Jared&#39;s dad agreed to pay Jared $15.00 per hour which was still a good deal considering how much he could charge for riding lessons and how little he had to pay for horse care. Jared also agreed to be his own stable boy, that is to clean out his own stall when he wasn&#39;t a horse. Jared felt a little cheated though when he went out to the stable and found out how much he had pooped the night before.<br />
<br />
Jared&#39;s dad explained, &quot;You might as well do it since that will be your bed sometimes. Make your own bed.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jared wrinkled his nose and got to work.<br />
<br />
Since Jared had a few more weeks before graduation, school was one of the approved reasons to give Jared time off from being a horse. Jared forgot all about being a horse at school. He focused on his friends. There was a girl he liked but she was going with someone else. So Jared hung out with his friends Eric and Carl. Friday, he accidentally let it slip to his friends that he would be spending the weekend as a horse. They of course didn&#39;t believe him and challenged him to prove it.<br />
<br />
So after school, Eric and Carl went home with Jared to see for themselves. Jared&#39;s dad happened to be in the stable.<br />
<br />
Jared said, &quot;Dad, tell them that I&#39;m going to be a horse for the weekend.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jared&#39;s dad said, &quot;You&#39;re just in time. I need to take a semen sample to make sure your little swimmers are all horse.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jared said, &quot;What, now?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jared&#39;s dad said, &quot;Well as soon as you turn into a horse. I don&#39;t want any human-horse hybrids running around. This is only an examination to see if Jasper is viable for breeding.&quot;<br />
<br />
Eric and Carl found this hilarious and wouldn&#39;t let Jared escape. &quot;Come on, turn into or horse or we&#39;ll tell the whole school about this elaborate joke.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jared said, &quot;Alright but don&#39;t tell anyone that I&#39;m a horse.&quot; At least Jared knew that Eric and Carl would keep a secret. Their threat to tell the whole school was an empty threat. It wasn&#39;t fear of his secret being revealed that kept Jared there. It was the fact that his dad and his two friends had ganged up on him. So Jared stripped and prepared to become a horse.<br />
<br />
As Jared&#39;s dad gave Jared the medallion, Jared&#39;s dad started examining his son&#39;s genitals. &quot;I hope these grow, Jasper.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jared, whose arms were held by Eric and Carl, said, &quot;Dad, what are you doing?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jared&#39;s dad said, &quot;Just examining my horse.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jared would have said more but then the horse blanket was wrapped around him and he changed into a horse.<br />
<br />
Eric asked, &quot;How can we help?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jared&#39;s dad said, &quot;Just keep him calm. Also, this contains some pheromones from a mare in estrus. Hold it to Jasper&#39;s nose to help him produce.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jared tried to relax and let Jasper take over but it was all happening too quickly. Jared didn&#39;t have time to fade away. He remained aware of his dad stroking his cock.<br />
<br />
Eric said, &quot;Just relax Jared. We&#39;re just taking a semen sample.&quot; Eric kept soothing but he kept saying Jared, not Jasper. That made it harder for Jared to relax. Jared&#39;s mind kept being called to notice that Eric was completely aware that it was Jared&#39;s semen sample. Eric even moved around to stroke Jared&#39;s cock, &quot;It&#39;s okay buddy. I&#39;m here for you. You do have a big cock there Jared.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jared&#39;s dad said, &quot;His name is Jasper.&quot;<br />
<br />
Eric said, &quot;But he&#39;s Jared, your son.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jared&#39;s dad said, &quot;My son is a horse right now and when he is a horse, his name is Jasper. Jared is going to go away but Jasper will be my horse for many years to come.&quot;<br />
<br />
Eric said, &quot;No, he&#39;s my buddy Jared. Even when he&#39;s a horse, he&#39;s still my buddy Jared. We&#39;re still going to go camping together and have fun together even if he is a horse.&quot;<br />
<br />
Their stroking of Jared&#39;s cock became more aggressive as they started to argue but then they were interrupted. The girl that Jared wanted came out to the stable to witness him being masturbated by his dad and his friend.<br />
<br />
Rachel said, &quot;Um, Mr. Marshall?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jared&#39;s dad said, &quot;Yes.&quot; but he and Eric kept stroking Jared&#39;s cock.<br />
<br />
Rachel said, &quot;I saw the advertisement where you will give riding lessons. I don&#39;t need riding lessons since I own my own horse but my horse has been injured and won&#39;t recover in time for the Ascot Equestrian Festival. I was wondering that instead of lessons. May I set up a lease agreement to train your horse and ride him at the Festival?&quot;<br />
<br />
Just then, Jared let loose a load of horse cum.</p>
