<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mike walked outside onto his front porch and gazed out into the neighborhood cul-de-sac. To his surprise he saw a group of kids, mostly boys, playing around to their heart&#39;s content. He had been a kid just like them not so long ago and felt a ping of nostalgia hit him.<br />
<br />
They were five of them: <br />
11 year old Aidan who was preppy, 5th grade boy with curly blond hair and a lean body.<br />
10 year old Bradley was a 5th grader like Aidan but with beefy body and a freckled, chubby baby face that matched his auburn hair<br />
8 year old Christine was Aidan&#39;s little sister in the 3rd grade and she wore pink overalls with her blonde hair in pigtails.<br />
7 year old Daniel was Bradley&#39;s little brother and had a pudgier body than his big brother though still distinctively freckled and auburn haired.<br />
And finally there was 7 year old Elliot was Daniel&#39;s best friend and classmate in the 2nd grade, his light brown hair distinguished him over the darker and lighter haired playmates. <br />
<br />
It was clear to Mike that the older boys, Aidan and Bradley, were being forced to play with the younger children by their mothers though they seemed friendly enough to the younger kids despite their roughhousing.  Mike was amazed at what the 4 year age difference made between these kids, he imagined Aidan must have thought he was playing with babies despite only being of preschool age when Elliot and Daniel were born.<br />
<br />
Christine too seemed a bit out of place in her overalls and seemed to be ridiculed left and right by the boys. Again Mike imagined that the blonde hair cutie would be a girl next door type to the boys (except for Aidan) in the coming years.<br />
<br />
Mike concluded he wanted to grow these kids up, if only to observe how they all reacted to being adults.<br />
<br />
Looking at the ring he awkwardly mumbled at it, &quot;I wish that group of kids there were all young adults so they could get along better.&quot;<br />
<br />
And suddenly the ring&#39;s power was in play, nearly instantaneously Aidan and Bradley were leapfrogging through puberty as they grew up into adult. Their legs and arms stretched to match the proportions of the growing, muscular bodies.<br />
<br />
Right after them was Christine who blossomed breasts out of her flat chest as he overalls changed into a blouse and shorts and her pigtails unwound themselves into wavy shoulder length blonde hair. Her body gained curves and a very large ass that expanded out of her childish butt.<br />
<br />
After them were Elliot and Daniel who followed with similar transformations as Bradley and Aidan but were less muscular and kept some of the fat around their bodies. They were clearly geekier, less fits men than their older counterparts and it showed in their lack of muscles. <br />
<br />
The five children were well past adolescence at this point and it seemed like they would be stopping in their late 20&#39;s/early 30&#39;s.<br />
<br />
Aidan became 31 years old and was as lean and tall in his adult body than he was as a tween.<br />
Bradley became 30 years old and was more muscular than beefy in his pudgy tween form.<br />
Christine at 28 years old was a knockout woman with curvy body than.<br />
While Daniel and Elliot were both fairly handsome men, yet unfit at 27 years old.<br />
<br />
And there they were. Mike realized they were all older than he was now, but an age difference like that mattered very little in adulthood unlike in childhood. He was curious how they would react and approached them to find out.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re grown-ups!&quot; Aidan and Bradley chanted in sync.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t believe this!&quot; Christine said as she caressed her self, &quot;I feel so sexy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How did this happen?&quot; Danial asked.<br />
<br />
Elliot was about to respond when he saw Mike approaching, &quot;Did you do this to us mister?&quot;<br />
<br />
Mike grinned, &quot;I&#39;m technically younger than you guys are now, you can just call me Mike.&quot;<br />
<br />
As they talked about the ring and its power, it became clear that Mike&#39;s intuition was right and they were happier this way. Aidan and Bradley were now much more friendly and supportive of Daniel and Elliot unlike when they were such little kids before. The two 27 year olds for their part seemed to have crushes on 28 year old Christine who they were previous annoying to.<br />
<br />
&quot;So you haven&#39;t explained why you did this to us Mike.&quot; Bradley insisted. &quot;Don&#39;t get me wrong, I like being a 30 year old man than silly 10 year kid but I just want to know why.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I wanted to test the ring&#39;s power.&quot; Mike admitted, &quot;I was just a little kid like you guys recently and my wife Katie was a little girl herself before she got her hands on the rings.&quot;<br />
<br />
Christine piqued, &quot;So our neighbors are actually kids? This is awesome!&quot;<br />
<br />
Mike answered, &quot;Yep, and I just thinking that this could be a neighborhood where the kids are adults and the adults are all kids instead. That would help my wife and I settle into adulthood with ease along with just having some company.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mike was hopeful they would take his suggestion to turn the adults into kids seriously, he wanted to see these immature adults take over the neighborhood and he was curious if the adults would be as happy to be kids again as their children were replacing them as the adults.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s do it!&quot; Aidan proclaimed. &quot;Christine and I&#39;s parents are getting a divorce anyway.&quot;<br />
<br />
Christine nodded at her older brother, &quot;Yeah! We can all stay together as family that way!&quot;<br />
<br />
Bradley and Daniel exchanged a look before the latter said to Mike, &quot;I think our mom and dad would be pretty cute kids.&quot;<br />
<br />
Finally Elliot spoke up, &quot;I don&#39;t like my stepmom all that much, but maybe I can be a better stepdad to her than she was raising me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay then.&quot; Mike said &quot;Which of your family&#39;s should we transform first?&quot;</p>
