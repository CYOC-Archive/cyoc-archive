<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Luke and his crew waited for queen Elisa in the guestroom, to give them the status on the completion of the sea-ships, while waiting there, Avelia took small sips from her goblet while looking at her dragon enjoying the beautiful afternoon with Anija, Vaestro played around with his old pocketwatch while reading a book about a love story, Luke sat on one of the many seats in the rooms, his dragon Karyu, was laying near him, resting his great maw on his lap, and the last two drakes were, as said, enjoying the afternoon, Vrack loved watching the golden rays of sunlight gracing the mesmerizing flowers of the gardens from the castle, he also loved watching and hearing the birds that drift through the sky with elevated grace, Anija also loved watching all of those things, Vrack&#39;s enjoyment was cut short as his mind was filled with a thought, it wasn&#39;t of a lustful nature, it was about a secret, a secret that he concealed from everyone he met, including Anija, who he wanted to tell, the only person that knew this secret was Avelia, who promised to NEVER tell anyone Vrack&#39;s secret.<br />
<br />
A few minutes have passed and queen Elisa returned to the guest room, with her leviathan Hadad, &quot;I came to bring two news, one is bad and the other is good, which one do you all want to hear first?&quot; asked Elisa suddenly, &quot;The bad one.&quot; said Luke, crossing his arms, &quot;Due to the storm, your airship has been severely damaged and cannot be used for transportation.&quot; said Elisa, &quot;Does that mean that we need to wait for the sea-ships to be built and use them to take us to the kingdom?&quot; asked Avelia, &quot;Not really, the good news splits in to three parts.&quot; said Elisa, &quot;Firstly, my workers said that your airship will be repaired in just a day, also they said that they might tweak it a little, to increase the flight power and strength.&quot; said Elisa with her cheerful voice, &quot;Second, my workers almost completly finished the sea-ships, i will take them when i will visit my brother&#39;s kingdom.&quot; continued Elisa, &quot;And lastly, i&#39;ve prepared a sea-ship for you all, follow me.&quot; finished Elisa as she and Luke&#39;s crew made their way towards the port.<br />
<br />
There they saw a sea-ship like no other, it was heavily armored with an unknown metal, it didn&#39;t look like the so called &#39;Dragon&#39;s bane&#39;, but neither Luke or his crew knew about the metal, the ship also had an incredible size and width, it looked like it had two plans, this was confirmed as Vrack saw multiple windows around the center of the ship, meanwhile its combat arsenal included rifles and cannons, the ship had the flags of the kingdom of Aquaria, a rod of a mage with a snake coiling around it, resembling the &quot;Rod of Asclepius&#39;, &quot;I&#39;ve prepared some resources inside the ship, consider this as a gift from me.&quot; said Elisa with a warm smile, &quot;We thank you queen Elisa, we can&#39;t wait to see you tommorow again.&quot; said Luke immideatly, Elisa giggled a little, &quot;Neither do i.&quot; she said as she watched Luke and his crew aboard the water juggernaut, Avelia had the most experience guiding sea-ships, so she commanded the rudder.<br />
<br />
Eventually the sea-ship started navigating on the waters of the kingdom of Aquaria, in its way to reach Adam&#39;s kingdom, while Avelia was commanding the rudder, Luke,Vaestro and Karyu stood on one of the many benches, Karyu was laying his maw on Luke&#39;s lap, giving a painful expression, meanwhile Vaestro and Luke were talking about their drakes, Vaestro quickly noticed Luke&#39;s painful expression, &quot;Is your dragon sea-sick?&quot; asked Vaestro, &quot;Yeah, ever since he was a hatchling he suffered from sea-sickness.&quot; replied Luke, &quot;By the way, i noticed that Karyu dosen&#39;t really like being around other drakes or hens.&quot; said Vaestro suddenly, &quot;Karyu always prefered being somewhat near my presence.&quot; replied Luke sharply, this made Vaestro laugh a little, as he and Luke continued their discussion about their dragons, meanwhile in the second plan, Vrack stood in one of the many rooms containing the resources, he looked outside one of the windows, watching the almost endless amount of water without any sign of life, meanwhile he was still in his thoughts wondering if he should or should not tell Anija his secret, &quot;There you are! Why are you cooped up here?&quot; said a cheerful yet masculine voice, Vrack instantly recognized the voice, it was Anija&#39;s, he looked at the eastern drake swimming like a fish in the air, only to then coil close to him, &quot;Are you alright?&quot; asked Anija with a worried voice, Vrack was still in a brainstorm, he didn&#39;t know what to do, he then decided to confess, &quot;Anija, i wanted to tell you something.&quot; said Vrack with a dry tone, &quot;What do you want to tell me?&quot; asked Anija with a curious voice, Vrack took a deep breath, &quot;A secret, a secret that i concealed from everyone, including you since we met.&quot; said Vrack with a sad voice, &quot;...Vrack, you promised to be a good drake.&quot; growled Anija, becoming angry as he started to feel betrayed by his own friend and mate, &quot;P-Please just let me finish.&quot; said Vrack with a small stutter, this suprised Anija, he never heared Vrack talking like that before, &quot;I&#39;m listening.&quot; said Anija, this made Vrack take another deep breath, &quot;Many belive that i was born a drake, but in reality, i was born a dragoness.&quot; said Vrack, &quot;A dragoness with the name &#39;Valyra&#39;.&quot; continued Vrack, by just hearing his old name, he remembered the good days he had as a youthful and beautiful hen, he remembered the days when his appearance was smooth and delicate, he remembered the days when he had the gazes of multiple drakes in heat following his every move and he remembered the days when many drakes begged to mate with him, a small blush formed around the scaly cheeks of Vrack, meanwhile Anija stood there giving a stunned look, &quot;I decided to change into a drake because i believed that i could be considered an excellent dragon for a rider, i had the fear that i wouldn&#39;t be accepted by a soon-to-be rider because i was a dragoness.&quot; continued Vrack, &quot;Then i realized that it actually felt good being a drake, although some of my feminine... needs... remained.&quot; finished Vrack as he looked down in emberassment, meanwhile Anija stood there still giving a stunned look, he always believed that Vrack was born a drake, he then sighed, &quot;Atleast that explains why you love being rutted by drakes.&quot; said Anija sharply, this made Vrack blush even more, &quot;Although it&#39;s making me kinda feel a little bit angry the fact that you never told me this secret before,&quot; started Anija, as he went closer to Vrack, &quot;But it also makes me feel happy since you decided to share such a deep secret with me, signifyng that you indeed love me.&quot; said Anija, this made Vrack raise his head, looking at Anija and before he could react, Anija pressed his scaly lips on Vrack&#39;s scaly lips, while also forcing his tongue inside Vrack&#39;s maw, in a beautiful warm french kiss, they stood there for seconds, until they broke down the kiss, &quot;Now you&#39;re filling my head with imaginations on how you look like as a dragoness.&quot; said Anija with an angry growl, &quot;You dirty eastern drake.&quot; said Vrack with a chuckle, this made Anija grit his teeth, &quot;Says the drake that loves being mounted by other drakes!&quot; said Anija in anger, the two of them continued their friendly-aggressive discussion.<br />
<br />
Eventually Luke and his crew reached Adam&#39;s kingdom, who was waiting them at the port with his dragoness, Luke and his crew left the ship as they went towards Adam and bowed down, &quot;A lot has changed in the kingdom in your absence.&quot; said Adam, &quot;Your highness, the queen of the kingdom of Aquaria said that the construction of the sea-ships will be done tommorow and she will bring them to the kingdom by herself.&quot; said Luke, this made Adam smile, &quot;That&#39;s good to hear, come on, let&#39;s go in the castle to discuss.&quot; said Adam as he made his way towards the castle with Luke&#39;s crew, by just walking towards the castle, Luke saw multiple changes in the kingdom, firstly, the entire kingdom was surronded by walls of an unknown material that resembled stone but with a white coloration, Luke recognized the material, it didn&#39;t have a name but it dampened the effects of magic, some of the houses were made of the same material, Luke realized that there were more guards and dragons patroling the kingdom, while also there were many more houses in the area.<br />
<br />
After minutes of walking, Luke and his crew reached the castle, Adam and his crew were in the throne room that was almost completly changed, in the center of the room there was a map, &quot;So your highness, do you have any work for us?&quot; asked Luke.</p>
