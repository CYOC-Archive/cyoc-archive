<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“It worked!”<br />
<br />
You’re broken from your trance as your heart stops.<br />
<br />
“It said it would transform the wearer…”<br />
<br />
You open your eyes and see Paul staring at your chest which you absentmindedly cover with both arms; at least as much as you’re able. He appears to be in the process of putting his costume on as it’s been pulled up to his shoulders with his arms through the sleeves. The hood is not on yet though.<br />
<br />
As your mind comes into focus you ask, “Could you stop staring at my beasts?”<br />
<br />
Paul immediately blushes as his gaze goes to your eyes and responds, “You’re gorgeous!”<br />
<br />
The statement left you speechless as heat builds up in your own cheeks.<br />
<br />
“I didn’t think it could be real…” Paul half whispers as he steps toward you taking an arm out of his costume. He reaches down with his now-bare hand. “Mind if I touch your fur?”<br />
<br />
You nod in response as his hand nears your right ear and pets behind it. Contentment fills you as you lean your head into his hand, moaning, which causes him to giggle boyishly. He steps back again and asks with a slight amount of concern, “You’re still you right?<br />
<br />
“I mean-” You start to respond before you examine the situation further. You look down at your new feminine body and, over your numerous breasts, see the juice-soak fur around your crotch. You remember the images that filled your mind like being mounted by a male fox. New feelings of submissiveness to Paul and the comfort of such a simple gesture like being pet behind your new ears seems to be a part of you now too. With concern you add, “-what have you done to me?”<br />
<br />
“You can probably guess the answer to that question. From the description of these costumes they will merge with the wearer.” Paul walks over to your costume’s mask and picks it up. “If the wearer merges with the costume without the mask they remain hominoid. If the wearer puts on the mask while being merged with the costume they will become an actual fox; retaining their human mind of course. When we’re done we can unmerge-”<br />
<br />
You lose track of what he’s saying as you think about what he had just said. Everything matched with what had happened. You reach up with your paw-hand and feel where your human face ends and the fur begins. There is no gap where there should have been a hood; the fur was growing out of your skin. The room and even Paul’s voice sounded different, fuller. You could feel your new fox ears twitch allowing them to pick up different sounds in different directions. You concentrate on what you know to be your tail and feel it lift off the ground.”<br />
<br />
“Wow!” Paul exclaims as he watches your tail wag. “Hold on I need to try this out!” At which point he puts his arm back through the costume’s and pulls the hood over his head before you could say anything else. As he straightens his back and starts fishing behind himself for the zipper’s cord your eyes fixate on the costume’s furry sheath and balls. The sheath is large and long, nearly to his belly-button if you had to guess. You could tell he was excited by your appearance as you could see his smaller, hard, human penis filling a good portion of it.<br />
<br />
After a few moments, Paul’s hand finds the pull string and zips the costume closed. “How do I look?”<br />
<br />
“Like a kid in a fox costume,” You tease him as you try to hide your excitement. You also take the chance to get off the floor noting how your tail was countering your balance. As you look at Paul again you gasp. Paul was a good six inches shorter than you previously, now he’s a good six inches taller! “I’m so short!”<br />
<br />
“And cute,” Paul responds as he smiles. “I have to be honest there was no one else I wanted to try this with. You and I have been friends for as long as I can remember…” He trailed off before continuing slowly, “I know neither of us are gay… I thought… umm… since we’d be opposite genders…”<br />
<br />
You’re not sure if it’s the costume, or your new body, or your new gender, or the soon-to-be-male-fox in front of you, or all of them combined but you raise a finger to his mouth as you shush at him to be quite. “I would have appreciated it if you told me ahead of time; though to be honest if you had I would never have put on either of the costumes. I have never been in love with you and I know that will not change.”<br />
<br />
As you said this you could see Paul’s disappointment on his face. You smile at him before continuing. “But in this body I am not the same me. You asked me if I am the same and I’ve been considering that question. I am me... and I’m now this costume. I am her. I am a vixen.”<br />
<br />
You pause for a moment, allowing your mind to clear and confirm what you were about to say. Paul remains silent as you remove your finger from his mouth. He’s searching your eyes for any hints about what you’re going to say. <br />
<br />
Nodding, to yourself mainly, you continue from where you left off. “This ‘me’ wants to be with you though…“ Taking one final breath you finally spill your new heart’s desires out, “I do want to cuddle in your arms. I do want you to pet me fondly. I do want you to rub my breasts. I do want to make out with you. I do want you to mount me. I do want you to mate with me.’ You grab Paul’s costumed hands and squeeze them as you finish, “In this body, as this vixen, I want to have your kits!”<br />
<br />
Blushing wildly Paul can only nod as he watches your eyes. You avert your gaze down as you feel your face grow even redder and notice his penis is twitching barely reaching the top of the sheath even though it’s fully erect. Lust begins to fill your mind as you realize you’re going into heat. You look back to Paul’s face as he smiles.<br />
<br />
“Then allow me to be your mate!” At which point Paul screams as he doubles over in pain. <br />
<br />
You know the pain. You also know the pleasure. You watch as the costume seems to shift and move while Paul writhes on the floor screaming. The fabric is no longer visible through the fur as it becomes part of your friend. You watch in awe as your friend’s non-athletic body begins to transform. His abs becomes more defined, even visible through the white fur, with a visible six-pack along with his now-refined pecs. Paul straightens his back with another agonizing scream as his back arches out as the costume’s tail connects with his spine; the tail quickly starts to flutter about as its host twitches.<br />
<br />
“It hurts!” Paul yells in a much deeper tone. His hands, paws, reach down trying to comfort his penis which you can see is no longer human looking. Rhythmically his cock pushes out of then back into the sheath. Each time the cock seems to be longer and wider as barbs develop all along his cock. Licking your lips you lean down and ignore the cracking sounds coming from his feet and hands and slowly blow on his now-fox cock. As soon as you do, his pained yells begin to turn to moans of pleasure. You lie down next to him and put your mouth around his excited member and start to suck it. He continues to moan loudly as his body continues to shift. You keep sucking knowing how much climax helped you. He starts to thrust his hips as you allow his cock to fill your mouth; the barbs are both irritating and pleasant to your lips and tongue. You can feel the blood rushing into his cock’s head causing it to grow in size as he stiffens. You wait for it. Then he howls as his sweet juices fill your mouth. It takes concentration to swallow fast enough before his next climax fills your mouth again. Again and again he howls as he releases more and more cum into your waiting mouth. Final he relaxes as you lick the last bit of cum from the tip of his cock.<br />
<br />
Both of you remain motionless as you let your head relax on his chest allowing his warmth and the motion of his raising and lowering chest comfort you.</p>
