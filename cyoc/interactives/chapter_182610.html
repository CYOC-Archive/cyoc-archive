<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Nate was your average 19 year old boy, relaxing in his dorm room with his best friend Jamie. They were supposed to be studying but were rather just sitting around talking. They had known each other since the sixth grade and were now in the middle of their sophomore year of college. Both of them had been determined to attend the same college and when they managed to pull that off even requested to stay in the same dorm. They wound up in separate wings of the building though. <br />
<br />
On that day, they were both relaxing and neglecting their homework and instead just enjoying each other’s company. Jamie was decked out in a simple white t-shirt and loose fitting blue jeans whereas Nate was in his usual t-shirt and shorts.<br />
<br />
Jamie stood up and started walking around the room looking at various things when the sight of a small, white crystal on the shelf above his desk caught her eye. She picked it up and looked at it, looking shocked to have found it. She turned around to Nate, holding out the crystal. <br />
<br />
“Where did you get this?” she turned the crystal over in her hands, examining it. <br />
<br />
“My uncle found it in a cave in Montana and gave it to me for my birthday one year. He usually gives really awesome presents, but that year I dunno.” Nate leaned back against the wall. “Why do you ask?”<br />
<br />
“This isn’t just any crystal.” <br />
<br />
“What do you mean? What is it?” Nate leaned forward, curious what she was talking about. <br />
<br />
Jamie pulled out the desk chair and sat down across from Nate. “Ok, you remember how I told you in the strictest confidence that I came from a long line of witches on my Mother’s side of the family?”<br />
<br />
Nate remembered all too well when she told him when they were both Freshmen in high school. He’d always thought it was cool having a witch for a best friend, even though every time he asked her to turn him into something she routinely said no. <br />
<br />
“Well, there is a dark chapter of Witch history that I’ve never told you. In addition to Witches, there used to be a whole host of magical creatures. Mermaids and Mermen, Satyrs, Dragons, Centaurs...you name it. Well, it’s always been human nature to fear what it does not understand. So, all the witches got together and traveled throughout the world, casting a very specific spell that turned magical and mythical creatures human. Since their magic couldn’t be destroyed, it materialized in shards. Shards like this one.” Jamie held out the shard to Nate. <br />
<br />
“So, this is crystalized magic then?” Nate took the shard from Jamie, his hand shaking a little. <br />
<br />
“It’s said if a human breaks a shard, then the magic is released and that person is transformed into the creature it belonged to.”<br />
<br />
“Really? Is there any way to know what creature it belonged to?” Nate turned the crystal over in his hand. <br />
<br />
“Not that I know of. It’s the luck of the draw.” <br />
<br />
Nate turned the crystal over in his hands thinking things over. His roommate was out for the weekend, so it was just him and Jamie at the moment. He had always wanted to experience turning into something and here in his hand he held the one chance to make that wish come true. He was right before, his uncle always gave great gifts. <br />
<br />
“Oh no, I know what you’re thinking…”<br />
<br />
Nate looked up. “You know me so well. If I break this crystal, I could transform into some awesome magical beast! That would be so cool!”<br />
<br />
“Oh yeah? And how are you going to explain being turned into a centaur or a satyr or something? God help us if you turned into a dragon…” <br />
<br />
“Come on, it’s a tiny shard from Montana. I hardly think it would be a dragon.” <br />
<br />
“True. But still,” Jamie held out her hand. “We should take it to my aunts before you do some real damage.”<br />
<br />
“What, why?” <br />
<br />
“Because, they have studied these shards and have experience with them. They can help guide us with what to do. Besides, I know they’d never pass up the chance to see one in action. And then they can help us with whatever you turn into as well.” Jamie shrugged her shoulders. <br />
<br />
Nate let out a long sigh. “Alright, in the interest of preserving our friendship, we can go see your Aunts.”<br />
<br />
Soon enough, Nate found himself in the basement of Jamie’s Aunts, Beatrice and Nancy. The two lived in a large, Victorian mansion just outside of campus and their location there was one of the main motivations for Jamie to move here and by extension Nate as well. Both women were in their fifties and very independently minded. It was clear who Jamie took after as both women routinely dressed for comfort with loose fitting blouses and Beatrice wore a long skirt whereas Nancy was forever decked out in well-worn blue jeans. Both still looked radiant as ever, despite their age. <br />
<br />
“So, you got your hands on a Magic Shard, huh Nate?” said Beatrice as she looked it over. “I’ve always wondered if the stories about these were true.” <br />
<br />
“It’s been ages since I heard of one being found.” Nancy sat back in a worn chair. “Go ahead and give it to the boy. I’ve always wanted to see what would happen and if we have a willing guinea pig…” <br />
<br />
“Wait, what?” Nate suddenly felt a twinge of panic.<br />
<br />
“Well, you always wanted to be turned into something, didn’t you boy? Now’s your big chance!” <br />
<br />
Beatrice handed over the shard to Nate, who took it from her with some trepidation.<br />
<br />
“I don’t suppose there is any way either of you would know what it’ll do to me either, is there?” Nate looked from Beatrice to Nancy, who both shook their heads. Nate was about to throw the shard at the concrete floor when he stopped. “Wait, if I do this won’t it effect you all as well?”<br />
<br />
“It doesn’t work like that dear. We’re already magical so you should be the only one effected by the shard.” explained Beatrice.<br />
<br />
“Well, here goes nothing then.” Nate watched as the three witches took several steps back. Nate raised up the shard and threw it to the concrete floor as hard as he could. In an instant there was a flash of white light as dozens of bolts of bluish magical energy coarsed directly into Nate simultaneously. He cried out as the bolts worked over his entire body. He felt a warm tingling sensation radiate throughout his body. After a few moments, it stopped and Nate immediately looked over himself. Nothing was different as far as he could tell. He stood up and looked around. “What gives?”</p>
