<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The thought of taking a sedative to sleep through the remaining changes turned Kara’s stomach. Looking at Milo; she shook her head with an emphatic no.<br />
“Are you certain,” Milo taking the last bite of steak on his plate; “it’s not as if we are going to miraculously get a cure anytime soon.”<br />
“Milo,” Kara being serious; “I was first scared when the doctor’s told us that we were infected with the mermaid virus. We were still on shaky financial footing when we got our condo, when we got the news. The fact that our lives have been completely upended as a result,” Kara finishing off her juice; “doesn’t change these two facts. One we are alive and two we are together.”<br />
“That doesn’t answer the question,” Milo trying to read his lover.<br />
“I’m getting to it,” Kara pausing; “when we arrived here, I was afraid that you would become female like me. I was afraid that we would not be able to start a family. But last night,” Kara eyeing Milo’s crotch; “dispelled all those fears. I don’t want to miss a single change we take as we spend the remaining few days we have with our legs. So let us use the features that this facility has provided us as we transition to people of the sea.”<br />
“Then were shall we go,” Milo getting up from his seat within the dining room pool.<br />
Kara just smiled as she also got up and began swimming to the nearby ramp.<br />
<br />
They chose to walk in a random direction within level 1 of the facility they were. Pausing as they arrive at an observation room; they got a good view of the underwater settlement. Noting that several building were still under construction; the materials being used were more akin to a type of coral mixed with cement, they marveled at how the buildings merged with the sea floor and how they acted as a breakwater for the nearby city port. They spotted several mermaids swimming about; a couple even saw them and waved as they swam by. Kara felt a hot flush fill her as every single mer they saw was naked. A few did have bras to support their breasts, but as for clothing, they were all naked.<br />
“It’s so the gills you grow don’t get impeded as you swim and breathe in the water,” a facility attendant speaking as he was mopping up a mess. “That is one of last changes you get as you transition fully into a mermaid; or merman,” the attendant smiling and nodding at Milo.<br />
<br />
“It looks like we have some company,” Milo looking back out through the glass. Kara turned around to see several mermaids eyeing them both. Feeling embarrassed she offers up a polite wave. A few return the favor but they all had eyes on Milo. Seeing his large male physic, the various mermaids had this horny and lustful look in their eyes as they stared flashing; bearing their breasts and showing there feminine slit. Milo was naturally aroused at the display; his merman prick pushing out of his vent, making him uncomfortable as his swimsuit provides stiff resistance to its freedom.<br />
“If you don’t want your boyfriend to be mobbed as you two finish orientation in level 2,” the attendant noticing the spectacle; “then you might want to head down the hallway to the nearby chapel.”<br />
“Why there,” Milo asking.<br />
“So you two can get married,” the attendant finishing up his work; “the single ladies will still pester you, but seeing you two bonded together will get them to back off.”<br />
“We already are married,” Kara nods as she tries to shoe the horny mermaids away; “but we had to sell all our possession including our wedding rings.”<br />
“Think of it as a renewal of vows,” the attendant responding; “plus you’ll get a matching set of wedding bands to place on your wrists. Most mers have webbing up to their fingertips,” the attendant eyeing Milo&#39;s webbed fingers.<br />
“Okay,” Milo feeling flushed as his rod strains for freedom; “let’s get hitched again.”<br />
<br />
***********************************************<br />
<br />
“Please repeat after me,” the wedding officiator speaking; a man who, like the faculty staff had surgeons mask and gloves on to help stop getting contracted with the virus. He was reading a novel as Milo and Kara entered the chapel; clearly bored as he was all alone. Seeing the two enter broke him out of his distraction and he spent a few minutes stammering as what to do. It took him a few minutes to collect a box of arm bands for both Milo and Kara to choose from. Each taking a matching pair of armbands made from coral and inlayed with obsidian. They were then instructed to hand the bands to each other.<br />
<br />
“With this band,” the officiator speaking; “I bind you to me.”<br />
“With this band,” Milo repeating as he places the wrist band on Kara; “I bind you to me.”<br />
“Your turn,” the officiator looking at Kara; “speak the words as you place the band on your husband.<br />
“With this band,” Kara speaking as she places the simple piece of jewellery on Milo’s wrist; “I bind you to me.”<br />
“To love and hold,” The officiator droning; “in sickness and in health, for richer or poorer, till death do you part.”<br />
Both recite the words as they each place the second band on each other.<br />
“Now place your arms up to your elbows in the nearby water fountain,” the officiator instructing the two; “it will activate the coral and cause it to shrink and lock itself to you. Don’t worry, they will not cut off any circulation or restrict any movement.”<br />
<br />
Both did as they told and were marveled at how the coral bands shrank and became tough; the obsidian gems becoming more pronounced as they removed their arms from the pool after a few minutes of soaking.<br />
“As long as those bands are wet,” the officiator looking at the two; “they will always stay on and not come off. You may now kiss each other if you feel like it,” the officiator adding; “you are now officially bonded with each other.”<br />
<br />
They both kiss each other passionately as they enjoyed the romantic moment; saddened that no one could witness the proceedings. It was then that Kara felt Milo’s shaft demanding to be free that she got another ideal.<br />
“Let’s head back to our room and consummate this union,” Kara looking at Milo lustfully.<br />
<br />
*******************************************<br />
<br />
They both quickly had their swimsuits off just as the door to their room closed. Milo’s Cetacean like rod bouncing freely; twitching to the beat of his heart rate, he turns Kara around and views her in all her naked glory. Smiling as he bends down to kiss her; his strong hand placed on her rear end as the two locked lips and their tongues danced in each other’s mouths. Letting go, Milo looks into his wife’s eyes and sees her lustful gaze returning back to him.<br />
<br />
She leads him to the sunken bed on the floor at proceeds to lay down; allowing him to be on top. Grinning as he follows; using a hand to support himself as he has the tip of his merman shaft at Kara’s dripping entrance. Lowering himself closer he watches as Kara gasps once she feels him enter her; she instinctively wraps her arms around his torso as he begins to thrust and gyrate, burying himself deeper into her needy tunnel. Like before, Kara was a washed with intense feelings of pleasure as Milo’s tapered rod scrapes along her inner folds; tickling her cervical opening, causing her to squirm in anticipation. It wasn’t long before Milo grunted and pressed his large frame on Kara as he started unloading another batch of his baby batter into Kara’s hungry womb.<br />
<br />
Coming down from his orgasmic high; Milo embraces Kara and rolls over, ensuring she was on top but also still joined together. He mumbles as he feels his rod still twitching; Kara’s vaginal muscles clamping down as she milks him dry.<br />
“Just as good as last time,” Kara panting as she still rides her high; remembering how Milo rammed her raw last night after she woke him up to a blowjob.<br />
“I can’t wait to see your belly swell with our child,” Milo smiling as he gently brushes Kara’s silver hair from obscuring her bright blue eyes.<br />
“Let’s hope this afternoon delight,” Kara purring as she rests her head on Milo’s chest; enjoying the feel of his strong heart beating; “takes root.”<br />
“It’s not as if we aren’t enjoying the sex,” Milo sighing as he feels his rod beginning to recede from Kara and head back home to his vent; “I wonder what changes we will get after our little nap.”<br />
“I don’t care,” Kara smiling as she drifts off to sleep; “I’m with you and that’s all that matters, my husband.”<br />
“My wife,” Milo kissing Kara’s nearby hand as he slowly drifts off to a fitful slumber.</p>
