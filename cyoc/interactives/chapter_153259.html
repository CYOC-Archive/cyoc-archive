<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Both shock and embarrassment were welling up inside of me. Embarrassment, because my friends and I aways made fun of boys&#39; little wienies growing up. And even to this day, I think they are funny little things. They are also really cute in a wierd sort of way. Which is why I was so attracted to boys to begin with.<br />
<br />
I like to imagine their adorable little penis completely pointing out ram-rod strait, then turning to stone and remaining that way. With boys, you can easily tell when they are turned on, even through their clothes. With girls, you can&#39;t. And when they are turned on, they become so obviously awkward and embarrassed, which makes them all the more adorable. And to imagine them with their penises stuck as stone, always unable to hide it and forever having to be embarrassed or awkward, that would turn me on. But now with growing consternation, I have one between my own legs!<br />
<br />
Boys are funny and wierd. They try to act tough, when they&#39;re just like small children. Which makes them all more charming and likeable. Especially teenage boys. If truth be told, I am very attracted to young teenage boys. Which is why I am with my fiancee. While he is 30 years old, he has such an adorable baby face. He is built like Vin Diesel, but his body is much smoother. His hands are soft as silk. Well, his skin is anyway. But his face. He has such a baby face with warm big brown eyes. His facial features makes him look like he is still only 15. He keeps himself shaved smooth, which gives him an even more youthful appearance.<br />
<br />
<br />
But here I am, gawking in a mirror in a bathroom at the mall, and a boy was gawking back at me! The boy had decently smooth skin, if a bit on the white milky side. Not a single wrinkle anywhere  not even the eyes. It&#39;s an image of a young boy, perhaps 13 or 14, staring back at me from the mirror. This....this can&#39;t be!<br />
<br />
I raise my right hand to feel the unfamiliar face. The boy in the mirror did the same! I see the dark curly hair upon his head, and I use that same hand to feel that. The boy did the same! I go to grab my no-longer long blond lush hair, but instead, feel the course wirey curly hair of the boy in the mirror. And the boy in the mirror did the same!<br />
<br />
In unbelieving shock, I drop my arm...his arm....to my side....his side. I then close my mouth, and the boy in the mirror did the same. With eyesight sharper than ever, I just stand there, looking into the boy&#39;s big, dark chocolatey brown eyes in the mirror. I just stand there, calmly looking over his face....my face now! I stand there studying it. Looking for my own familiar face, but finding not a trace of it. <br />
<br />
Brown eyes instead of bright blue. Dark, almost black, vey curly short hair that barely covers the tops of the differently-shaped ears, instead of long blond luscious hair. Bigger, thicker dark eyebrows. Though on this more masculan face, not real thick. Lighter-colored complexion than my own tan skin. Looks all the more lighter perhaps due to the dark hair and eyes.<br />
<br />
I look down and rub my now-flat chest through the boy&#39;s white t-shirt I&#39;m wearing. It felt totally wierd. My chest wasn&#39;t sticking out. I can actually look over my now-boy&#39;s body with no boobs in the way.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, the bathroom door opened and I quickly raised my hands to pretend I was washing them. Considering these aren&#39;t even my hands, but I&#39;m now stuck with them anyway, I actually do wash them as I have no idea where they&#39;ve been. The boy could have been picking his nose or....or....jerking off....his....his.....MY?...uh....penis....for all I know! <br />
<br />
The person who walked in was a man. A big, strong man. I automatically became self-conscious. Self-conscious of my old self, that is. But this man completely ignored me, stepped into a stall, and I heard him begin pissing while standing! That&#39;s right! That&#39;s what men....and boys....do! They piss while standing!<br />
<br />
My own bladder was beginning to feel like it needed to unload, and that...thingy...in my pants...no, not my pants, some boy&#39;s pants...started growing. I quickly finished washing....these hands, who&#39;s ever they were now, and quickly exit the bathroom. <br />
<br />
I step back out into the mall, and just stand there, surveying the scene. It looked like the scene that we caused had since dispersed. I must have been in that bathroom for a little while. I look around. Looking for...well....myself, I suppose. <br />
<br />
I see a blond haired woman over by Macey&#39;s, and quickly race over there. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, kid! Watch it!&quot; someone yelled out as I rushed by a group of people. Wow! I noticed how easily I could move around. Not that I couldn&#39;t easily move around as myself before. I kept myself in great shape. But this....somehow felt different. More....energetic and....nimbler. It felt entirely different without my chest thumping up and down. I&#39;m definitely more straight and narrow in that area. <br />
<br />
Running felt more natural. Much more natural. I suppose it wouldn&#39;t too strange for a young teenage boy to be running through the mall. But seeing a rich 20 year old female business executive with high heels running through the mall would have been a strange sight to see. As a teenage boy running, people would just roll their eyes and say; &quot;ugh, kids.&quot; A mall cop would be much more likely to harrass a young teenage boy than a woman. Even if the boy wasn&#39;t running. But I was. <br />
<br />
As I approach the woman, I notice she isn&#39;t wearing the clothes I was formerly wearing. Not ever able to see my body from behind in my entire life, I didn&#39;t know what I was ACTUALLY supposed to look like from behind. But apparently, that woman&#39;s body wasn&#39;t mine, as I discovered when she turned her head to look in my direction. She looked nothing like I did. That much I was most certain of. <br />
<br />
In my haste and eagerness to catch up to….myself?....I failed to hear someone shouting &quot;SLOW DOWN!&quot; Then apparently, they shouted &quot;STOP!&quot; as I continued to run towards this lady. Hence: why she looked back towards me. But then I pulled up short the moment I realized that wasn&#39;t me...or rather my body, that this little teenage bastard somehow stole. <br />
<br />
As I stopped running, I then heard someone shouting: &quot;GET BACK HERE!&quot;<br />
<br />
I look back, and sure enough, there was a mall cop running towards me. Now, normally, I would have calmly stood there and waited for him to catch up to me and ask: &quot;is there a.problem sir?&quot; But instead, something inside of me screamed at me to &quot;RUN!!!&quot; And so I did.<br />
<br />
I ran through Macy&#39;s towards the back exit. Very athletically avoiding people, stands, and a stroller. Why was I running? I dont know why i was running. I know i didnt do anything wrong. But….perhaps the kid who i switched with did? That was definitely not out of the realm of possibility. Matter of fact, it was actually LIKELY that a dumb teenage boy did something stupid and irresponsible. I would have to be the one that would end up paying the consequences. Not whoever I switched with. <br />
<br />
None of these thoughts ran through my mind at this moment as I was running away from a mall cop for some reason or another. Those thoughts would only occur to me later on. But in the present time, I&#39;m running through the rear entrance/exit doors of Macy&#39;s. <br />
<br />
From there, I didn&#39;t know where I was headed. I was just running to get off the mall property and into the treeline where I knew the mall cops wouldn&#39;t be able to continue coming after me. <br />
<br />
I eventually did make it. It is a large parking lot, but not so large that it would take more than a minute of running. Upon reaching the woodline within about 30 seconds, I was out of breath and beginning to sweat. I bent over at the waste while my breath caught up with me. While I was able to run and was quite nimble despite a thick body build, I was clearly out of shape! I kept my old body in tip-top shape. This boy&#39;s body clearly wasn&#39;t in that kind of shape. Judging by the paler skin and the very slightly pudgy thickness of this body, this boy was probably more at home being at home. Maybe he was a loner? <br />
<br />
Speaking of which, this body! I lifted my hands….his hands….these hands….whatever….and looked at them. They looked so different! They were stubbier, bit not really shorter. Just a little rounder with more of a meaty thickness to them. But not really fat. The fingers were more wierdly rounded, as were the fingernails. The fingernails! Oh god! I kept my fingernails in perfect shape! These were all clearly chewed upon on a regular basis! They were all sort and jagged. Gross! This boy had these fingers shoved in his mouth! Which was now my mouth! Who knows how unsanitary he is!? I began to spit out whatever germs he had, bit then realized I&#39;m stuck with those germs. His germs! <br />
<br />
Sweat started leaking onto my forehead. I can feel his curly bangs, now beginning to get wet with male teenage sweat, sticking to my forehead. I reached up with his hands to brush his hair out of my face. Only to feel the wetness on my hands. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh! Gross! Its wet!&quot; I said outloud with my different-sounding voice. <br />
<br />
I pulled his hands away to look at them. They were glistening with his sweat! Nasty! I wiped them off on his shirt….his shirt! I&#39;m wearing his clothes! I&#39;m wearing the clothes that a teenage boy had been wearing all day!<br />
<br />
I suddenly started feeling dirty and gross all over. Almost like I was crawling with boy cooties. Ew! <br />
<br />
I was fine with my fiancee. He always showered and smelled good. I had no idea the last time this body had showered. It could have just been this morning. Or it could have been days ago! And how long has he been wearing these clothes? And look at these black and white basketball-styke shoes on his feet. Definitely more than broken in. I bet those feet stink like a teenage boy! The shoes felt really oddly comfortable, though. Like they were made just for my feet. No! Not *MY* feet! The feet of some boy I never met in my life. Which were now my feet.<br />
<br />
I was getting so creeped out, the scalp started itching. I automatically reached up to give it a good scratch. I forgot about the course curly sweat-wet hair! I was expecting to feel my lush, full golden hair. How quickly I forgot about that, even though I had just felt it a moment before! <br />
<br />
I looked back down at my hands and arms which I have dropped. I stand there, looking down at myself….his self….and see the boyish bare arms and hands sticking out a bit from my sides, palms open. I stare at the white T-shirt, jeans, and black and white male basketball Nikes i was wearing.I just stood there, looking down at myself. I began to get scared, worried, and most of all, sad. Sad at the loss of my pretty business executive body. My pretty clothes and jewelry. And missing my big, yet short, Italian hunk of a boy-man!<br />
<br />
I felt the tears coming. I couldn&#39;t help it. I hadn&#39;t cried in years, and here I was, beginning to sob like a little lost child in the woods by the mall. I went to sit down against a tree and curled my legs up, wrapping my arms around them. I sat there for, I dunno how long crying. Wiping my eyes, and hugging my blue jean-clad knees. I&#39;m stuck! I&#39;m stuck as a boy. I&#39;m stuck as a young teenage boy! How had this happen?<br />
<br />
One minute, I was me. Myself. A grown 29 year old beautiful woman at the top of her game. Now I&#39;m stuck at a 13 or 14 year old boy nearing the end of his MALE puberty! How? What happened?<br />
<br />
After my big crying session, I began to think over what had transpired over the past 2 hours or so. I was walking towards Macy&#39;s to do some clothes shopping. I saw this young, obviously horny teenage boy staring at me. His jeans were even tented! With his big brown chocolatey eyes, black curly hair, palish smooth skin, and broad nose. A thick-bodied kid who wasn&#39;t fat. But wasn&#39;t skinny either. Shorter than me. Oh! Great! I&#39;m also now shorter too! <br />
<br />
Anyway, I saw this kid looking directly at me as we were about to cross paths. I saw something in his hands when he stumbled into me and knocked us both over. But I got up as that kid. We must have switched bodies instantaneously the moment he came in contact with me! But how had that happened? There was no way two random people could just switch bodies like that. But. Well. Here I am! In possession of a random 13 year d boy&#39;s body.<br />
<br />
After we crashed to the floor of the mall, he got up with my body after being knocked out for a few seconds. He got up, wiped the blood off my pretty little nose, berated me for running into her. Then she just….walked away. With all of my stuff! My pocketbook! My wallet with all of my cash and credit cards. With my….driver&#39;s license. My clothes….<br />
<br />
Wait a second. Driver&#39;s license? I wonder….<br />
<br />
I got up, only now realizing I was sitting on some small lump on my right butt cheek. I slipped a hand into the back pocket of the jeans I was wearing and grabbed a wallet!<br />
<br />
Jackpot! <br />
<br />
I pulled it out to reveal it&#39;s contents. It was very flat, very light, and well-worn. It was an ugly blue Velcro thing. Great. Just great. This thing is now my property?<br />
<br />
Whatever. I needed to see what he had. The only thing he had was a couple of bucks good for maybe a bus fare or two. And an ID. A….school ID. A….MIDDLE SCHOOL ID! I was stunned, very easily forgetting for a few moments my predicament! This ID….a picture of a boy….apparently now me… on a middle school ID card!<br />
<br />
On the card was the name of the school: Curtain J. Middle School. Even more great! He&#39;s a public school kid! I was in a rich private school for girls. Could I ever have switched with someone as completely different from me!?<br />
<br />
There was the school logo.The name on the card above the picture of a now-familiar-looking boy was….Michael. Michael Bennett. That&#39;s the name. Michael C. Bennett. Half wondering what the C must have stood for, and half dreading having a boy&#39;s name: Michael: that was totally different from mine. Great. I&#39;m now a &quot;Mike&quot; instead of Tara! <br />
<br />
The picture of the boy….of me….was actually rather nice. Bright white, perfectly straight teeth with a nice deep genuine smile. Shiny black curly hair that was naturally messy without at all looking like a slob. Soft dark brown eyes. Baby-smooth facial skin. This kid was actually kinda cute, in a puppy becoming an adult dog kinda way. <br />
<br />
I then thought of all the things I used to think about strangely cute boys like these when I was this age. Well, this age last time. My first time. I used to giggle at the idea of how they all are walking around with funny little penises between their legs. How every once in a while, I&#39;d see a boy with his pants tented as he awkwardly tries to play it off. I used to laugh at their deepening voices. Not quite a man&#39;s voice, but no longer a child&#39;s <br />
<br />
Shoving the ID back into the wallet then into the back pocket of the jeans while sighing, I looked up at the trees. My, how lovely, beautiful, and sharp-focused the bright green leaves are against the clear, deep blue sky! I then look all around me, and everything has a slightly different shade of tone than I was used to. Warmer. With a lot more clarity. I inherited this kid&#39;s eyesight as well. Well, of course I did. I have his eyes! Those big brown puppy dog eyes are now mine that I fully control!<br />
<br />
That thought stirred something in my pants. Which I decided promptly to ignore. I felt I had to pee, but wanted to putt off doing so as long as possible. Besides having to pee, this thing was feeling all tingly and I actually felt it begin to grow. I decided to promptly ignore this crazy, almost debilitating feeling as much as possible. I knew what it was. II was not ready for THAT yet!<br />
<br />
So I stood there, looking all around with my newfound sharp eyesight. Did I need glasses? I mean. My body? My….old body? Because I was never able to see THIS well! This is actually pretty cool. The world was much more beautiful. The sun filtering through the trees. It was somehow softer. Even if a shade darker that normal. Not quite as glaring as I expect it to be. Wonder if that&#39;s because of the brown eyes vs. bue eyes that changes the light, or if it&#39;s because of the difference in eyesight itself that&#39;s doing that? <br />
<br />
In any case, the world looked much softer and more pleasing. I finally started feeling relaxed. Does eyesight have a lot to do with personality? Like, someone who sees softer tones of color, are they more laid back than someone with blue eyes that sees things in a much colder, harsher light like I was used to?<br />
<br />
Hhhmmm….maybe THATS why blue-eyed European cultures have been world conquerers? Are brown eyed people prone to less violence and easier personalities because of how they see things? <br />
<br />
Whatever! I had to force myself out of these random crazy thoughts and focus! Why was it so hard to focus? My brain seems to keep wandering. Daydreaming. He must be a dreamer, and this is what it must be like. Is this another trait inherited by this boy? Am I actually BECOMING this Mike Bennett character in mind as time goes on? <br />
<br />
Come to think of it, the boy who was in my body got up, cursed me out for running her over….well, kinda….and walked off with my bag. He pulled out MY cell phone, and began dialing. I heard him talking to Vin! My fiancee! Asking for him to pick him up! I remember all of this, but at the time, I was far too confused and stunned to do anything about it!<br />
<br />
That&#39;s it! I have GOT to find this person who took off with my body!</p>
