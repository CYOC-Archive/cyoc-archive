<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Another night slowly gave way to a new dawn, the sun crawled into the early morning sky. The land was painted in an almost serene tapestry of warm hues, the dew-laden grass glinting with the day’s first light. The German Shepherd stirred, raising its head and yawning lethargically. You had spent another night trapped as a reluctant prisoner in a repugnant, never-ending nightmare. The shepherd had sought shelter under a bench for the night. Your evening passed with you broiling under the dog’s tail, roasting in the body heat and the steady rhythm of farts that would occasionally disrupt your stinking solitude. The heat given off had been considerable, a lot of it radiating from the dark vulva situated just below you. In all that has happened it only now occurred to you that the shepherd you belonged to was a female.<br />
<br />
Currently your view was framed by the thick fur that encompassed you, the sun filtering in through the strands of fur of your stifling confines. A rogue tremble rippled through your puckered form; you involuntarily twitched under the canine’s tail as she started to get up from her resting place. She stretched out her long, lean body -  her muscles loosening with a light groan. Her tail lifting slightly as she started to move, the rush of fresh morning air against your sensitive skin was almost heavenly after the suffocating heat of the night had left you feeling groggy and disoriented. the sight of the park revealed to your quivering self for the first time since last evening - a wide, open field, lush green tree leaves rustling gently in the morning breeze. As much as you wished to appreciate the picturesque landscape stretching out before you, it was a mere backdrop to your current dire predicament. The shepherd started trotting away, her tail bobbing gently above you. Your “mouth” clenching with every rhythmic trot of her muscular hindlegs. Your heart pounded in rhythm with her steps, apprehension creeping over you. As far as you could tell, the park was empty. Though your eyes had degraded after your transformation into an anus, your eyesight was good enough to tell that there didn’t seem to be any people around. Nor was there any sign of a certain anthropomorphic tiger genie. Your equally diminished hearing could only pick up the calls of morning songbirds and the distant sounds of traffic.<br />
<br />
As the dog began her usual meandering about the park, a pang of hopelessness washed over you, the park&#39;s empty state a miserable reminder of your grim predicament. The day was shaping up as beautifully as its predecessor had been, a picturesque morning in stark contrast to the abhorrent situation you found yourself in. A subtle gurgle stirred beneath you, a faint rumble moving up the canine&#39;s bowels, serving as a harsh reminder of your grim reality. Your new &#39;throat&#39; was beginning to fill once again. Each passing moment you could feel the build-up, an imminent load getting ready to press against your puckered lips. The very thought made you shudder, though you were starting to become numbingly accustomed to this sensation. The feeling of something heavy and warm pushing against your lips was disgusting but equally inevitable, it was after all a part of your new existence.<br />
<br />
The German Shepherd trotted across the dew-kissed grass, each step jostling you around uncomfortably between her haunches. As much as it revolted you, being a dog&#39;s anus had come with a strange sense of security, and you hated yourself for having such thoughts. Tail wagging lightly in the cool morning air, she suddenly stopped near a tree. A familiar tension took hold of your form, the Shepherd’s tail raised up, exposing you completely to the open world. She lowered her rear slightly taking on her usual stance when she squatted. The dog started to urinate, her stream of liquid warmth arching down to the grass in a steady flow. You mentally braced yourself for what was to follow. A reeking fart erupted from your mouth before the steady push and contractions started.<br />
<br />
With a kind of dreadful inevitability, you could feel it coming. The squelching sound echoed through your being, you could feel her rectum flex slowly as it brought the dense weight right into your mouth. Just as you had feared, it was the tip of a turd. And a fat one at that. The taste wasn’t getting any easier to endure, and the warm texture made you want to gag. Suddenly, the thick turd lurched forward inside your mouth, parting your ridged lips. You were once again forced to live through another degrading spectacle, each agonizing second etched into memory forever. You squinted in pain as you stretched around the sheer girth of the log. It passed out of you slowly, your mouth had to stretch further to accommodate every centimeter that crept out. It felt like time had slowed to a crawl, but in reality the shepherd had just started relieving herself and had a long ways to go.<br />
<br />
As the poop inched out, it caused your puckered opening to stretch past it&#39;s capabilities. The muscles in the dog’s rear that weren&#39;t part of you even began to strain as you were stretched past your normal parameters, but it seemed like nothing was going to stop the dense log as it continued smoothly through you.  The turd did not pause and continued slithering out of the shepherd’s bowels. You tasted all of it from possibly every single angle, and it became clearer than ever how much more heightened your senses of taste and smell were. The dog waste was coming out so slowly that you had enough time to note the differences in the consistency, as if you could tell what foods comprised each bit. A softer segment having been the discarded cheeseburger the dog had found the last night; and the spicy peppers she had rooted out some trash. No person should be subjected to this; nobody deserved to experience something so loathsome, so revolting. You wouldn’t have wished this fate on your worst enemy. Then again, you weren&#39;t really a person anymore, were you?<br />
<br />
The tip of the log reached the ground, but still it was attached as a single piece that extended past your sore lips. You watched as the excrement slowed in its decent, gravity exerting less pull on it as it began coiling on the ground beneath the shepherd. The shepherd, she must have notice this as well because she flexed her gut to help speed up the process of nature running it&#39;s course through your mouth. The turd unexpectedly began sliding out at a much faster pace, until the end of the log slipped out of you. When it finally fell away with a heavy thud, you groaned in anguish, weakly expelling another bout of flatulence. Too tired and dazed to even close your gaping self shut, your host flexed you in and out until the next load of waste was brought to the end of her rectum, at which point you were manually forced closed again as it pressed against the inside of your lips, ready to go again. You had no ability to fight this process. It was natural the natural function for an asshole like you after all.<br />
<br />
Numbed by the pain and filth you had just expelled, you relented any semblance of opposition and relinquished full control of yourself over to your canine symbiote. Her bowel moment wasn&#39;t much different from the first, only this time you didn&#39;t try to resist. Simply observing the dog poop flowing out of your mouth, you let the shepherd control the anal muscles that comprised you. Not that you could have stopped her from doing so, you belonged to her and were merely a part of her anatomy. She had absolute control. As the dog continued to defecate, you knew deep down that there was no coming back from this. You had seen a lot of bad things in your days, but never had you before been so…violated. Even if you were able to restored to human form, you weren&#39;t sure you could ever face the world again. The overwhelming sense of revulsion, mortification and shame that had settled so deeply in your soul that surely they had been imprinted permanently upon your psyche. You don’t think you could live with yourself. Maybe...maybe your current role as a tight anus and anal sphincter for this German Shepherd was all you were any good for now.<br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
With one final push it was done. After three more agonizing bowel movements had been squeezed out of you, you lay there, completely defeated by the ordeal. Your gaze was fixed on the large, coiled pile of brown waste that now rested on the grass below, a sad reminder of the only purpose you had left in life. But as you gazed at the impressive size of the poop, a small glimmer of pride stirred within you. It was almost impressive how much waste this shepherd had excreted, and she couldn&#39;t have done it without your crucial help. After all, her regular old sphincter likely couldn&#39;t have stretched wide enough. You had stretched yourself to the limit to help this creature. Your...mistress. Wasn&#39;t that something to be a little proud of at least?<br />
<br />
As you wrestled with these conflicting thoughts, she flexed you shut and brought you back to reality, her tail returning to its resting position, the task was complete. Concealed underneath, nestled between the shepherd’s fluffy haunches, you wished for mercy, a reprieve from the unending misery. You tried to move cry out, knowing full well it was futile and instead of a voice it’d likely a gaseous discharge. It did not matter since your mouth no longer responded to your impulses even when the shepherd was not actively exerting control. Whatever connections that had allowed you a semblance of autonomy having been worn out. Your mistress flexed your lips in and out as she padded along. It was as though you were being cemented into your new existence as part of the German Shepherd. You physically already were her anal sphincter, the only remnant of yourself was your mind bound to the flesh. And you weren’t sure how long that would last before she claimed it as well.</p>
