<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Kellie, Jack and there friends now awkwardly talked, Baba and Merlin were exploring the park, marveling at what Circe had accomplished in such a short time.<br />
<br />
“Well I’m impressed,” Baba stated as she watched two anthros work on the roller coaster.<br />
<br />
“That’s all well and good Baba,” Merlin said. “But I think we have more I important things to be concerned with. The hourglass is still affecting you. You’re still growing younger.”<br />
<br />
“I know,” the 25 year old replied casually. “And I know how to reverse it. It’s quite simple really and it appears Lilith and Circe have mended their relationship.”<br />
<br />
Merlin now gawked at the youthful witch, stunned by her admission. “If you know how to reverse this than why continue?”<br />
<br />
Baba smiled, leaning in close to Merlin as she gazed up at his eyes. “Because it’s been so long since I’ve been young,” she sighed. “And I mean really young. I can feel my energy increasing. I feel so full of life, full of optimism. Besides, just looking at you I can see you like how I’m looking.”<br />
<br />
Merlin blushed slightly, fidgeting as he gazed at the young woman. “Even if that were true,” he said, trying to remain focused. “The fact is you are growing steadily younger. Soon enough you’ll be a child Baba. How do you intend to be with anyone if your a school girl.”<br />
<br />
“You could always join me,” she smirked. A sad smile now crossed Merlin’s face as he gently caressed Babas face. “You know that’s impossible,” he said sadly. “The cost of creating the Ring of Age. I am immortal yes, but I can never be young. It’s a blessing and a curse. Infinite power and wisdom, trapped in an elderly form. No magic can return my youth as long as the Ring of Age exists, and you know that ring can not be destroyed.”<br />
<br />
Baba sighed, leaning into Merlin. She hated how stoic and sensible he was sometimes. “I know,” she whispered. “Guess we can never have what we once did.”<br />
<br />
“No,” he replied quietly. “Still, it doesn’t mean that we can not have a future.”<br />
<br />
Baba perked up as she now coyly smiled at her former lover. “Had a feeling you still liked me.”<br />
<br />
“I meant as friends,” Merlin stammered quickly, trying to compose himself as Baba laughed. “Whatever you say you old coot,” she chuckled. “Now, what do you say you take me on a couple of these rides. Maybe the Tunnel Of Love? You know Circes spells won’t affect us.”<br />
<br />
“I’m not sure,” Merlin said thoughtfully. “Ugh Cmon you old stick in the mud,” she whined. “I’m not getting any older here. Before I end up a teenybopper just take me through once. Then we can reverse the spell. You already know how to reverse it yourself so even if I do end up a kid it shouldn’t be a problem.”<br />
<br />
Merlin looked at the pleading woman, still a bit uneasy about chancing a ride on one of Circes rides. True he would not be affected by the spells but that wasn’t what concerned him. Despite being hurt so many centuries before he still carried a torch for Baba. The voluptuous, dark haired Russian had always been a bit of a wild child and helped him live life to the fullest. In their youth they had enjoyed many adventures together and watched many a sunrise after some truely exciting evenings. Merlin remembered at the time that he would have been willing to sacrifice is magic if he could live the rest of his life in her arms. Those days were gone now though, Baba had broken his heart and he had spent over a millennium increasing his magic to the point that he had no equal.<br />
<br />
“Look Merlin,” Baba said, grasping his hand. “I just past my 25 birthday in reverse. This is starting to pick up speed. So before I turn into a crushing school girl can you please take a ride with me through the Tunnel of Love?” Merlin sighed, nodding as Baba squealed with joy. Taking his withered hand she now raced towards the attraction, thankful that no one was in line. Quickly the couple now stepped onto the boat as it jerked forward towards the entrance.<br />
<br />
As the couple entered the dark tunnel, Merlin could feel Baba cozy up to him. Merlin could feel the woman’s large breasts press against him as her hot breath now tickled his ear. As he gazed down at her he was astonished by her beauty. Flawless skin, beautiful eyes, long luxurious dark hair and a face that quickened his heart. Wrapping his arm around the young woman he pulled her closer as she nuzzled into him.<br />
<br />
As the ride continued Merlin could feel the woman growing steadily younger. As he ran his hands along her shoulder and waist he could feel her slimming ever so slightly. Sheepishly he gazed down at her breasts noticing they were becoming perkier while losing some of its volume.<br />
<br />
“Eyes up here casanova.”<br />
<br />
Merlin jumped, stammering an apology as he gazed at the laughing woman. Baba was now a fresh faced college beauty of 21. The woman’s face was beginning to lose its adult maturity as she inched closer to girlhood. While her curves were still quite impressive, he could see they were beginning to erode slowly. “Your so young,” he whispered as he caressed her cheek.<br />
<br />
“Just past 22,” Baba smiled. “Racing towards 21 the wrong way. Too bad we don’t have something to drink to celebrate. It seems all the kids want to celebrate that milestone by getting black out drunk. Remember in our day when everyone was drinking alcohol. Wine was as common to drink as bottled water.”<br />
<br />
“I remember,” Merlin smirked. “Those were the days. However it is a different time, so I don’t see why we shouldn’t try to blend in.” Making a small gesture with his hands Merlin conjured two goblets of wine, handing one to Baba as she shyly smiled. “About to relive my 21st birthday in reverse care to celebrate?”<br />
<br />
Merlin nodded as the two toasted, draining their goblets before looking at one another. “Goodbye 21,” Baba smirked. <br />
<br />
“So your 20 now,” Merlin asked.<br />
<br />
“Yes,” she nodded. “It’s really not that hard if you focus. I can feel the days falling away from me at an increasing rate. I’m able to pinpoint exactly how old I am. Unfortunately it’s really starting to pick up speed now. It also means I can feel my magic growing weaker.”<br />
<br />
Merlin nodded as he gazed at the woman. Baba was quickly approaching her teens now, her face losing all of its adult maturity as she began to relive the bloom of youth. A young innocent face with a slim waist and developing curves. Baba was curvy for a girl of 20 but any who saw her would know she was still a girl growing into womanhood. “How are you feeling,” Merlin asked.<br />
<br />
“Really starting to feel like a teenager,” she giggled. “I’m anxious being here with you but also full of energy. It’s...quite strange.”<br />
<br />
Baba sighed as she looked over her body, her body had slimmed down considerably while her breasts were now beginning to decrease in size. As an adult she was a full D cup, now as she became 19 she could see it was closer to a large C. What amazed her was the perkiness of her breasts. She could not remember them ever being that perky. As she gazed at Merlin she could feel her cheeks burn. She was head over heels for him yet as her age decreased she felt shyer, less confident in herself. In short she felt like a teenager on a first date.<br />
<br />
“Merlin,” she whispered, her voice young and frail. “I’m really close to dropping below 18. And there’s something I want to do before I really become a kid.”<br />
<br />
Merlin understood. Turning slightly he gazed at the beautiful teenage girl. An 18 year old girl with a curvy frame, a young innocent face, and dark hair that cascaded down her back. As they approached one another the two former lovers embraced in a passionate yet tender kiss. Baba was the first to pull away, letting out a breathless wow before looking down at herself and frowning.<br />
<br />
“17,” she sighed. “Well Thankfully the exit is right over there. How about we fix this.”<br />
<br />
Merlin nodded as the boat came to the end. Stepping out of the boat she reached out his hand, watching as the blushing teenage girl tentatively took it before looking at him like a school girl with a crush. “Thank you Baba,” he said kindly. “Maybe when this is over. We can give this a try.”<br />
<br />
The 17 year old girl nodded excitedly as Merlin now invoked the charm that would reverse the spell. Now al that was left to do is see if it worked.</p>
