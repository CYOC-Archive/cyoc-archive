<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Obviously this is a open story just use this as an outline for people to see as they fit. Enjoy! </div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After the mysterious explosion at Quark-Tek the world changed for all mankind. A new branch at the time, was testing a new sources of fuel and energy alternatives <br />
<br />
A new gene caused by the radiation of that blast was created, giving some humans few abilities and introducing new three new genders. <br />
All new genders are considered attractive to either sex. Puberty a parents genes or exposure to levels of radiation in the womb shapes their bodies. The new genders make up 15% of the population and are born that way. Slang for all new genders is called Nu-gens. <br />
New genders are resistant to most sexually transmitted diseases except for the most dangerous and life altering and have higher libido and greater sexual stamina. New genders although largely accepted by greater society can sometimes face discrimination and can often have a hard time buying clothes unless custom made or special brands which can be costly for the body-type. <br />
<br />
3rd<br />
3rd is a new gender made from the blast. All 3rd are men from a genetic stand point but all have a vagina. Only 3rds that menstruate can reproduce. They produce a hormone called testrogene.<br />
<br />
• He-femme<br />
Similar to a woman from the neck down with a masculine face or androgynous in rare cases. They grow facial hair and cut hair short to show their masculinity<br />
<br />
• Halfer<br />
A person that is identical to a female from the chest or waist down. They can have long or short legs<br />
<br />
• Cuntmen (slang term pussybois)<br />
All of their body is masculine and have no classic female area except a vagina. Some give aways are smaller feet or hands than an average man. <br />
<br />
4th<br />
4th are genetically women however all have penis. The produce the hormone Estroterone. Only 4ths with testicles can reproduce. <br />
<br />
• Dickgirl (slang Futa)<br />
Similar body to a woman, they have a penis with or without testicles. Like Cuntmen they can have larger hands and feet than a normal woman. <br />
<br />
• She-Halfer<br />
Male body type from the waist down. Narrow waist hips and strong legs. <br />
<br />
• She-masculine (She-mascule or She-mac for short)<br />
A male body type from the neck down. Their face is feminine and can grow facial hair however most shave don&#39;t grow at all.<br />
<br />
5th (scramble)<br />
5th  Are unfortunate people exposed mild or heavy amounts of radiation for a certain amount of time     <br />
except for the genitalia parts of the persons body or all of it will change to the opposite sex and increase that persons physical and sexual traits and attributes. No one is born a 5th only created by accident or sometimes purposely. <br />
<br />
Classic <br />
A term used to describe majority of the population that were not changed by the blast. Their genitalia cannot change if exposed to mild or high amounts of radiation but the reproductive hormone can. For example a woman exposed can produce testosterone from her ovaries. <br />
New genders can only make children of the same sex. For example a Classic man and a 3rd have a child it will either be a male child or a 3rd. <br />
A classic couple has a chance of reproducing a classic or new gender. The probability of conceiving a new gender is based on the genes of the parent and how much exposure in the womb to radiation. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
• PGD (Phantom Genital Disorder)<br />
A new mental disorder similar to gender dysphoria. 3rd and 4th people experience a loss of not having genitals and or body-type of the Classical gender counter parts. Classics can have it too but it is rare. <br />
<br />
• Receiver <br />
A receiver is a person that has a special gene of letting them absorb, repel or unleash radiation. They are created if a person exposed to radiation hasn&#39;t changed or naturally born with it. <br />
Since the blast all human genetic code is altered and the radiation from it can change a persons physical and sexual attributes in a minor a major way. <br />
Receivers can increase or decrease the affect of that gene like increase a man&#39;s penis size or shrink his muscles. They can sense each other. 1 out of 50,000 people can use this ability. The rate of how fast the change to a person&#39;s body determines their skill and strength of that power. Some are regulated by the government of their country to help the public by finding pockets of radiation in local areas. Others remain hidden and use the abilities for personal gain. All genders can be born with this power but new genders have a higher chance than classics.<br />
<br />
• Milker<br />
People that grow breasts have a high potential of becoming milkers. A receiver that is pregnant, a person exposed to radiation or drinking radiated human breast milk can are some of the ways a human can become a milker. The power grows a person’s physical and sexual traits if applied directly to a part of a persons body. If consumed in a food or powder or drank directly it increases a person looks. <br />
Milkers have a downside in that they only can use their ability for one sex with either blue or pink milk. The stronger the color of the more milk powerful effect it will have on the individual. If a person of the opposite sex applies contact to skin or consumes milk of the wrong type of milk a persons body-type will change to the milks sex color. Another drawback is it can be addictive because of the taste and increase a person’s libido. The effects can be contagious but will not give them sex altering abilities if another person has breasts.     <br />
<br />
All people born with breasts regardless of size, secrete a hormone that can cause other people to lactate. If exposed to radiation, abilities or not, as a side effect will begin when the individual is sexually aroused the milk is sweet and has minor healing properties (stronger healing if they are a Milker). Pregnant people are an exception to this they begin a lactate the moment the child is conceived. Similar to syncing menstruate cycles, a person lactating in small area like an office work space, can cause a “milk-flu” to breakout. <br />
Lactating individuals can effect others if the milk is consumed and have breasts or has kissed a different person if the person doesn&#39;t have breasts. For example if a lactating person kisses a classic man or a She-mascule and that person kisses another person with breasts then the receiver of that kiss will start to lactate. <br />
The effect can range from a few days to nine months but there are special exceptions. Unfortunately several thousands of these have happened across the world and has become a common part of life since the blast.     <br />
 <br />
    • Spec-Cell<br />
A Spec-Cell is a special phone with a built-in spectrometer components for detecting radiation. <br />
   <br />
 • Radiation (slang Qrads)<br />
A new element from the Quark-Tek explosion. It has the effect of enhancing a person’s physical and sexual traits and attributes. The effects are random for each person, for example if a woman is exposed she can gain beauty and have her figure enhanced or she can loose her breasts and have the chest of a man. Another side effect is the aging process slows down depending on the person and the Qrads they take. Shards of the explosion are found across the planet, either formed naturally in crystals, particulates in the air, or gathered in large amounts underground in liquid form and Qrad weather like rain and storm. Only humans are effected by the Qrads. New genders have a slightly higher resistance to Qrads that are not Milkers or Receivers, but they are effected as well and their genitals can be changed to random results. Qrads can only be detected if a person has powers or they have a Spec-Cell. Receivers can sense it and Milkers breasts start to ache or they lactate when Qrads are nearby. When around Qrads, people with become aroused and have a strong desire to stay in the area. The more attrative a person is the higher their Qrads genome is. Only silver can block the effects of Qrads. Platinum fully repels the effects <br />
<br />
    • XchangeRx or Qchange<br />
A drug that was made by radical group activists Nu-gen called “Outkast”. The drug made by an unknown process, though it is believed to be made by combining the ability of Milker and Receiver people and a mix of underground technology. In untrained hands, it can be used to transform a person’s body in varying degrees and can change genitals of all genders but is random, however if the person using it has abilities or trained, the drug can change a persons body-type to their desire. It can be made into a spray, turned into a liquid a pill or made into a cream unfortunately these drugs are also transparent and permanent. Qchange much like Qrads cause a person to become aroused, it has a euphoria effect when used. It is tasteless and odorless but can have flavor added to it. Sadly we were only able to get a few samples, we believe this can be used as a weapon eventually by the group and wreak havoc. <br />
<br />
    • Outkast<br />
A radical group Nu-gens, they are a terrorist/activist with a strong internet following. They believe that by destroying gender barriers they are making a better world for Nu-gens and can end discrimination. Unfortunately for them in recent times they have been known to use vigilantly justice to achieve that goal and have only made their message worse as they start to use Xchange and Qrad shards on often innocent people. <br />
Recently they have started to use Nu-gens with powers.<br />
The group has no political ties or leanings and a financed through unknown means, they work in cells but do have a leader but they are as of yet identified. How people are recruited is also unknown, but were working on leads  <br />
<br />
    • Husk<br />
A person that has been exposed to high amount of Qrads. An overwhelming drive of lust is left of their consciousness. They live off of a persons natural Qrads by absorbing it. All are dangerous and are prone to rape their victims. They hunt in packs or alone often found in natural deposits of Qrads if not feeding on people. They are mindless like zombies. Fast and strong only silver bullets can take stop them.<br />
<br />
    • Q-beast (Or Sexer)<br />
A Q-beast is the leader of a Husk pack. It has no head and in its place similar in appearance to a vagina with tendrils on the sides of the opening, this hole spans from neck to lower torso with a voluptuous and or muscular woman&#39;s body-type it has large breasts and large thighs with a thin waist with gray skin. It feeds similar to a Husk, however if a victim is attacked instead absorbing off a person Qrads by forced sex, it will open its hole several times wider to absorb the victim and become a symbiotic leach and the victim a host. Once assimilated the skin of the Q-beast will change to match the host pigment and enhance the beauty and facial structure of the host the victim will have all of the Q-beast abilities such as enhanced strength and agility and control over its body, however the Q-beast will drastically increase the host libido. The frequency of sex degrades a hosts mind if not careful. The host can become pregnant but only a small percentage do so. They could be used as a weapon for the Outkast if we are not careful.<br />
<br />
All Q-beasts and husks immune to stds, most stay in isolated areas but have been spotted in densely populated areas during a Qrads weather event.      <br />
<br />
Because of the Nu-gens people are either penis, vagina or body-type sexually oriented. <br />
Instead of bisexual people are now bisexual or quinsexual</p>
