<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">With all the freedom of the world at his fingers, Dillon wanted to keep up with the wild imagination he had. More people were about to be changed to his liking. His first subjects were a mother walking with her teen daughter. Dillon thought quickly about how he&#39;d change them. &quot;The daughter will have her human head over a large gorilla body. The mother will have a small monkeys body.&quot; The ring flew and Dillon turned to see the daughter gaining muscle mass. Alot of it actually. So much, that her tank practically shredded in seconds revealing her breasts ballooning out in a cartoonish *FWOMP*. Meanwhile the mother started growing brown hair all over her body. Her figure started shrinking into her dress as she now stood from 5 to about 3 feet tall as she tripped, disappearing in her clothes.<br />
<br />
The daughter who was now about 7 feet big was starting to grow the same brown hair all over her muscled body. She started hunching down on her knuckles which grew in size along with her belly and walked on all fours. Her feet also reshaped and became more hand like. The mother finally got out of her dress as her small body was now completely covered in brown hair. Her hands became slightly bigger, her feet became handlike, and a long tail sprung from her rear. The pair were still recognizable with their human heads, but now had simian body&#39;s carrying them along. &quot;Hold on Tawna! I can&#39;t keep up with these tiny legs!&quot; The mother said running to climb atop her gorilla daughters back. &quot;What did I say mom? I&#39;m not a pony.&quot; Her daughter said grumbling like she&#39;s done this before. The two continued to stroll around the park.<br />
<br />
Satisfied with the monkey lady&#39;s, Dillon continued on to his next targets. He managed to find two men in a meeting. &quot;The guy in the white dress shirt will become a bulb and his brail will illuminate through his head when he gets an idea. The man in the blue polo will get a pen for a nose as his writing utensil.&quot; Dillon looked back up to see the white shirt man&#39;s forehead started inflating like a balloon. Once his head resembled a light bulb with human skin and hair, light started emitting from inside his skin, making it look bright pink. The blue polo guy started nodding up and down as his nostrils disappeared and his nose started pointing outward. A hole engulfed his nose with a sharp tip of a pen pointing out as he started to write with his face on a paper. Dillon couldn&#39;t help but laugh. The power is so much fun to use.<br />
<br />
Dillon than saw a little kid playing with a toy dinosaur. The boy seemed to be enjoying himself, but Dillon thought of something cooler for him. &quot;The boy will turn into a dinosaur by absorbing his toy. He will remain the same size and his clothes will adjust to his new body.&quot; Dillon looked as the boys arms got skinny and grew scales all over. His tow started getting sucked into his hand as it change into a three fingered scaled claw. &quot;Woah! Cool!&quot; The kid says looking at his new arm. All the sudden, his legs started thickening and his shoe flaps opened as three toed claws emerged. Watching his wiggling toes, the boy suddenly looked back and saw something poking out the back of his pants. A hole developed and a long green tail slipped from his pants. &quot;Awesome!&quot; He says as he shakes his tail, even slamming it against a nearby tree.<br />
<br />
The boy starts standing in a slouched position as his belly enlarged changing the center of his gravity considering his tail. The scales traveled upward as his body started to take a more pear shape. Once the scales came up to his neck, the boys face started pushing forward. As it happened, he started making silly expression the more he changed. Even baring his sharpening teeth and sticking out his tongue as it thinned into a forked reptilian tongue. The scales spread from his neck, all the way to his head. Once his eyes were closed, they opened once again to reveal them as gold with black slits. &quot;This is awesome!&quot; The boy screeched. He ran around in his new body playing with his new additions (especially his tail). &quot;Huh. Kinda reminds of that Godzilla commercial.&quot; Dillon said referring to a commercial where a kid just turns into Godzilla. He was just glad he could make the boy happy. He could relate to the tail thing himself.<br />
<br />
Other additions to the park include changing a man&#39;s legs into tree stumps, giving a duck bill to a woman feeding ducks, turning a cyclers legs into a bicycle, granting a birthday girls gift by giving her wings to fly, and even giving all the kids at the basketball court giraffe necks. Dillon could go around all day making changes to people and he would never get board. As fun as it was though, he was missing out on the fun himself. All he did was get massive muscles and a chameleon tail. It was probably time for some more fun changes for him. &quot;I will grow two additional arms below my original and just as muscular. I will also grow a pair of dragon wings with a color change effect like my tail.&quot; The ring glew once again and Dillon felt pressure from under his arm pits. Two lumps from each side emerged, gaining fingers and muscle depth just like his arms. Dillon&#39;s second pair of arms ballooned full of muscle, and Dillon started flexing out of joy. Not before feeling two more bumps on his back. The two lumps grew as scales covered them and his skin started to stretch across. The two lumps now resembles large dragon wings that had turns the same color of green on his tail, and we&#39;re strong enough to support his weight. Dillon flapped his new wings with glee.<br />
<br />
&quot;Reggie, time to go.&quot; Dillon heard a woman&#39;s voice call out. &quot;Coming!&quot; Dillon heard as he saw the dino boy he changed earlier chasing after the two adults next to the car who he assumed was his parents. &quot;Yeah. Might be a good idea.&quot; Dillon said looking at the sun setting. &quot;Time to give these babies a test.&quot; He said as he flapped his wings and started soaring upward back to his apartment.</p>
