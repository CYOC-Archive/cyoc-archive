<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jim Bob Hartt had waited on bated breathe for his purchase to arrive. And by the time he heard the package get dropped off by his apartment door, he was in the throes of sitting there on his phone, checking the status of his delivery and any updates. He huffed and pulled himself up from his couch. Jimmy, he was a rather portly guy, though not excessively so. He used to play high school football, and he liked to imagine he still had his charm from those days. And indeed while Jim still had thick, strong arms from his job at the construction site, and his face hadn&#39;t gotten that chubby at the cheeks, he had a chubby little belly and his pecs were starting to look more like moobs. <br />
<br />
He used to be a studly blond guy, the archetypal handsome blond haired athlete everyone wanted to get with. Now, he was a recluse living in an apartment, working a construction job, and barely any social life outside drinks with the guys from work. The things an injury to the leg can do to a former champion.<br />
<br />
Today, he was dressed in his usual casual wear around the house - a white tank top and a pair of tighty whitey underwear. He walked over to and opened the door slightly, and then picked up his package, eagerly stepping back into his living room after throwing the door shut and locking it.<br />
<br />
It had been a long while since the last time Jim Bob had had any sex. And he distinctly remembered the days when he was a hot commodity at his school, remembered how people looked at him. The way they obviously wanted him - and the loss of that over the years had informed his descent - throwing himself into his work, and enjoying whatever he could on the weekends. What was worse was nobody believed him it seemed when he said he used to be something.<br />
<br />
Used to be somebody. They laughed when he brought up that he used to be a varsity football player. Laughed when he claimed that he used to be clean, good looking, and handsome. Because...well. Now, all you could see or smell of Jim was his greasy hair, his belly, and the distinct scent of cheap booze on his tongue after a night too long at the pub.<br />
<br />
But now, he&#39;d found something online that promised to give him at least a better time than his hand did. Perhaps not as good as Betsy and her wonderful, thick tits, but every review he found on this thing at the online sex shop was ranting and raving about how good it was. Yes, Jim was a peruser of the seedier online stores. The kinds of places you needed to do a special search to find on Amazon. Sex was not exactly bought and sold there, but pleasure certainly was.<br />
<br />
And honestly, with how Jim figured that most of the women he knew from high school would take one look at him and laugh? <br />
<br />
He figured that the only action he&#39;d be getting was by one of the sex toys he got online. But even then, the last few he&#39;d tried had all stung of disappointment. They hardly looked like what had been advertised, and the people who sold the toys always went radio silent as soon as he had any form of complaint. And it had looked like Jim Bob would be left to the embrace of the first girlfriend of any boy - his right hand...<br />
<br />
At least, until he found this lady online. She had bright red hair, a vivacious and curvy body, and breasts that distinctly made Jim feel like a young stud again getting to see them so freely advertised. Her profile picture was more or less her in a bikini top and thong, her items seeming to float around her as if she was magical or something. It was a rather charming little technique - and when Jim saw the reviews, his choice was made.<br />
<br />
Numerous men were speaking on the review channel about the item about how good it felt.<br />
<br />
Some swore it was better than sex by far. Though Jim found himself nodding along at that one and chuckling &quot;Sure buddy, sure&quot;. Still, the enthusiasm brought him around to trying it out. After all, it couldn&#39;t hurt to give it a try...right? Peeling open the box, he found himself looking at a shimmering, soft - oh so very soft - purple fleshlight. The inside looked to be ribbed or something, a bunch of little bits inside that looked made to continuously rub against a guy&#39;s dick.<br />
<br />
Before long, Jim started stripping off - throwing his tighty whities in a corner by his couch, and his tank top by the arm rest. Jimmy was not exactly a small guy when it came to his cock. Sure, he&#39;d let himself go to pot at least a little bit, but he was still pretty blessed down there. As he took his seat, the construction worker bit his lip, toying with the fleshlight and starting to angle it toward his manhood. As he slipped the head of his cock inside of it, he immediately bit his lip, blushing and looking up.<br />
<br />
Even just that much made him feel like he&#39;d slipped his cock into something he had precious little reference room for. Just that limited contact had the man half hard already, and as much as he wanted to ease it on, to really enjoy the occasion, he slid it further on to his turgid manhood. And every inch that slipped further on to him left Jim grunting and gasping - the ridges inside rubbing against him like a hundred little tongues. Somehow, there was already something like lubrication...!<br />
<br />
Jim let out a moan as he got it fully on to his dick, and he started to slowly pump the fleshlight up and down his manhood. Trying to control his use of it - so as to not just immediately fucking bust in that damn thing. His face however was red, and his eyes were flittering shut as his willpower to restrain himself was fading. The young man gasped suddenly as it seemed it was really concentrating on the head and underside of his dick - where he knew damn well he was most sensitive.<br />
<br />
If Jim had kept his eyes open, he might have seen something else happening alongside the sheer pleasure he was experiencing.<br />
<br />
As he pumped away, his belly started to deflate, fat burning away in real time - abdominals and obliques that had not been seen in some time yet were now starting to emerge again. Every pump of the fleshlight on his cock made his belly just a little smaller, the fat a little less visible. Even on his face, the bits of fatty deposit near his cheeks and jawline began to ease...but then, as he moaned, there was a slight difference in the version of Jim&#39;s face that emerged from that fat.<br />
<br />
Slightly more androgynous than usual - prettier. His lips thicker, his skin turning smoother and softer.<br />
<br />
Jim kept on pumping, his cock likewise smooth and increasingly sensitive, urging him on even further. But his chest was far from turning back into the athletic pecs of his youth. The fat if anything started to reshape, beginning to bulge and reform - growing into less of a man&#39;s pectorals and more of the bouncy, fat laden breasts of a woman. But as his small, slightly jiggly breast tissue began to grow, the sheer sensation of it if anything contributed to the distraction.<br />
<br />
Pump.<br />
Pump.<br />
Pump.<br />
<br />
His hips grew wider, his arms turned leaner and more slim. Still muscular and athletic, but less the bulky arms he might have been familiar with. Jim&#39;s hair began to grow longer, the blond hair taking on its earlier waves and curls even as it became silkier and softer. &quot;Fuuuck...&quot; Jim moaned, his face androgynous and beautiful. A perfect mix as of yet between the masculine and the feminine.<br />
<br />
Pump.<br />
Thrust.<br />
Thrust.<br />
<br />
Jim&#39;s thighs began to grow thicker, larger, taking up more room. His hands began to feel distinctly softer - his nails turning slightly longer. And Jim&#39;s breasts began to grow again - stopping at C Cup Breasts. Easily as big as those of his last girlfriend. And Jim was still thrashing around on his couch. Still pumping that thing on his cock...until he went a little too hard on it. Jim suddenly groaned, and threw the fleshlight off of his cock, which still retained most of its size - though it was slightly thinner. <br />
<br />
The young man bit his lower lip, and the orgasm rippled through him from head to toe. A man&#39;s orgasm, his cock shooting cum in the air, his balls pumping the whole load... but he felt it as intensely and across his body in the same way a woman might. His legs shaking as he ran his hand along his cock one more time. Barely even seeing the fleshlight starting to roll down toward the hallway. After all, that was the single most intense orgasm Jim had ever experienced.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoa...holy shit...mm...hm?&quot; He got up to retrieve his fleshlight after he tossed it off to enjoy his orgasm - and by now he noticed his voice sounded softer. Still masculine, but with a strangely feminine tone to it. He hoped he wasn&#39;t getting sick or---something. And as Jim walked over to grab the fleshlight,  he found himself standing at the exact right spot to end up looking in the sufficiently reflective surface of a nearby window.<br />
<br />
Jim saw his altered body. Saw his athletic, muscular but distinctly FEMININE body shape. He saw his breasts, resting on his chest where normally he had---!! <br />
<br />
The scream that ripped out from the man&#39;s throat was loud and panicked, and he reflexively kicked with his whole leg at the offending fleshlight as he fell backward against the wall in his apartment building. He felt his thick, wavy shoulder length blond hair. His face petrified with fear and realization of what just happened to him. He had no idea how it happened, just that it did - and left him something caught between the sexes - he still had his cock and the strength of a man, but the bodily shape not to mention the breasts was undeniably feminine.<br />
<br />
But then he heard something.<br />
<br />
And Jim found himself looking on as his door swung open - the fleshlight responsible for his change rolling out on to the balcony outside. For his part, the young man only whispered, &quot;I---I swear I locked my door, how---how did that---?&quot;  But as much as he was affected by these changes, he couldn&#39;t quite bring himself to go running after the sex toy. And he watched it roll right along. Seemingly on its own. <br />
<br />
Jim Bob got up from where he&#39;d slumped against the wall. He knew he would need to get some clothes on...somehow. And he figured he needed to try and retrieve that. To send it right fucking back and get his money - after all, he didn&#39;t sign on to be turned into a hermaphrodite by his own sex toy!</p>
