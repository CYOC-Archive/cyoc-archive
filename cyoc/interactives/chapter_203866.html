However, her large spherical breasts stopped her inches before she could grab her prize, her body held back by the metal shelf in front of her.<br />
<br />
&quot;C&#39;mon, almost there….&quot; She said to herself as she pushed her body further into the shelf, pushing away some of the chemicals in front of her in the process. As she further focused on her singular goal towards potential reversal, her subconscious and aura had other plans.<br />
<br />
As the pink vixen continued to push inwards to reach into the back of the shelf, her aura surreptitiously loosened the caps for some of the chemicals that were stored directly above her, with labels such as &quot;Inhibition reduction agent (Batch #3)&quot;, &quot;Positivity enhancer&quot;, &quot;Chemical affixer&quot;, &quot;General chemical aresolizer&quot;, and &quot;Handling agent&quot;. The jostles & grasps that she had made towards her target slowly rocked said chemicals forward, subsequently causing them to teeter along the edge of their shelves.<br />
<br />
The jostles stopped, however, as she was able to grab the flask before pulling her body out to inspect her reward: What she had found was instead labeled &quot;Non-acceptance reversal agent&quot;, with some notes that said that it helped with PTSD-afflicted individuals in a few drug trials. Dejected, Debra leaned onto the shelf beside her, her body slightly squeaking as she did so.<br />
<br />
That was the only motion needed to cause the few teetering chemicals above her to fall over.<br />
<br />
The glass flasks & containers smashed onto the floor around her, spilling some of their contents onto the pink fox, with the rest mixing with each other to form a potent air-transmittable concoction. Startled by the breaks & spills around her, Debra promptly took a few deep breaths to calm herself down, before looking at the flask she was holding in her paw-hand.<br />
<br />
<i>(...Am I stuck like this forever?)</i> The pink fox thought to herself as she looked down at her latex body, the fluorescent light above her a polish-like shine: The chemicals that had spilled onto her were either being absorbed by her own body without Debra&#39;s attention, or they were mixing with the aerosolized mixture around her, further increasing its potency. With each sigh & breath, the chemicals made their way into the pink vixen, making their way into her rubbery mind.<br />
<br />
As she continued to lean on the shelves behind her, her subconscious was silently guiding her mind into seeing this as a new beginning: <i><b>Shi</b> was a hot pink fox, and a drop-dead gorgeous one at that!</i> A second look at hir body showed hir inhibitions being eroded without hir noticing, as hir vulpine prick quickly became erect, pulsing with a need to be played with. The negative thoughts that were sitting in the back of hir mind were being squirreled away somewhere else, causing Debra to feel… happy? Giddy? <br />
<br />
<i>…Slutty?</i><br />
<br />
It became increasingly difficult for hir to hold on to the negativity that shi had, as hir mind started to drift towards bubbly & happy thoughts, albeit heavily intertwined with deep desires for sexual acts – Both receiving & giving. Absent-mindedly, Debra began to stroke hir erect shaft, the sensations somehow feeling even better than when shi was back in the car. Despite this, the latex vulpine didn&#39;t feel anywhere close to being satisfied: As if <i>something was holding hir back.</i><br />
<br />
It was then that hir eyes drifted to the same bottle that shi had grabbed from the shelf behind hir. <i>If anything could help hir right now, it would be the contents within that flask.</i><br />
<br />
In hir lust-addled haze, shi used hir mouth to remove the flask&#39;s seal, spitting it out before downing the chemical straight into hir maw.<br />
<br />
The first gulp didn&#39;t immediately do much: Aside from the pleasures felt from hir foot-long schlong and the translucent black latex precum that was leaking from it, shi mentally didn&#39;t feel anything else.<br />
<br />
The second gulp was when shi felt something buzzing within hir mind, as shi felt some of hir thoughts being packed away. <i>It was probably the agent doing its job: Shi just needed to keep downing the agent.</i> Hir 4 latex jugs began to leak small streams of black latex milk, while hir snatch began to leak a translucent black latex fluid as well, both further heightening the pleasures felt by the hot pink fox.<br />
<br />
Another gulp: Hir mind was starting to feel lighter, as hir thoughts became more focused on the pleasures that shi was feeling right now, along with the desire to climax. The negative thoughts that shi had in hir mind were being pooled to hir plump latex balls, while hir mind was going through some new thoughts: Thoughts about hir pack, the pleasures of being a latex herm fox, of lust-addled happiness, & the desire to <i>share this pleasure with everyone.</i><br />
<br />
By the fourth gulp, the flask was now completely empty, along with any negative thoughts that shi had in hir mind. Hir past began to feel hazier with each passing moment, as they too were being pooled down to hir spherical latex factories. Hir precum & milk were leaking more & more with each passing second. Shi closed hir eyes, trying to focus on stroking hirself to completion.<br />
<br />
<i>Shi wanted to climax.</i><br />
<br />
<i>Shi <b>needed</b> to climax.</i><br />
<br />
And with tensed-up balls, shi climaxed.<br />
<br />
Aiming at hirself, the trickle of black latex cum soon became a long series of spurts, coating hirself in thick wads of hir own ejaculate as hir spherical breasts streamed out thick latex milk from hir engorged nipples, with hir plump pussy producing a black-tinted stream of translucent latex juices. As shi climaxed, hir old memories were a thing of the past, quickly subsumed with new memories involving hir pack. Hir interests in latex & rubber were cranked up to the max, while hir inhibitions were completely obliterated.<br />
<br />
In hir lust-addled haze, shi didn&#39;t even notice that hir cum began to form 2 hot pink handlebars on the sides of hir hips, making it easier to grip onto hir for a wild ride. Hir remaining juices, meanwhile, began to pool into a sphere of latex right beside hir, increasing in volume as hir climax continued without pause.<br />
<br />
The pink fox&#39;s climax lasted for a few minutes before it began to taper off, the streams of latex soon coming to an end. When <i><b>Candi</b></i> opened hir eyes, shi found that shi was still holding onto the flask that shi had just drank out of. Placing it onto the floor, hir focus soon drifted towards hir still-erect prick, to which only one thought came to hir mind:<br />
<br />
<i>(That. Felt. Awesomee~ Everyone should feel like this all the timeee~)</i> An impulsive giggle came out of hir as a result of that thought, before hir mind wandered back towards hir lustful desires.<br />
<br />
Picking up the latex sphere beside hir, shi stuck the head of hir prick into the pooled sphere of hir own latex juices, shivering from the pleasure felt as shi did so. As shi got back up from hir leaning spot, the hot pink fox did another once over of the entire shed, looking for any other chemicals that shi could bring along with hir.<br />
<br />
Some time passed before shi exited the shed with hir box of goodies in hir arms: Aside from the toiletries that shi had picked up from the previous sheds, shi also grabbed the packet of aphrodisiac powder, along with several vials of &quot;Eternal Polish&quot;, a flask with heart shapes suspended within a pink fluid, & a flask of &quot;Follicle regrowth serum&quot;.<br />
<br />
<i>(I can&#39;t wait to show this to my pack~)</i> Another giggle escaped hir lips as shi walked out of the shed, happy & bursting with giddiness and lust.</p>
