<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Lord Richard Whitestone? Eve is confused as to why he would be standing next to her father at the altar. Perhaps as an extra security presence but there is no other man who stands at the other end of the grand, 150 ft aisle. Is he meant to be her husband?<br />
<br />
The crowd assembled all stand as the music begins to play. Eve begins her walk, but uses the cover of her mother&#39;s golden veil to examine the room. Lord Richard is not a horrible person to possibly be wed to. He is a good young man who is famously chivalrous and quite handsome to gaze upon. It just seems highly unlikely that the Great King would allow his daughter to wed the Captain of his Erotoan Knights over dozens of eligible nobles. She thought that the knights had to take a vow of celibacy while they were actively serving the King. As part of her education to be the only Princess of the realm, she had to learn every nobleman&#39;s name and assigned role. He is called Lord Whitestone only out of respect to his station, not out of actual noble blood. But hanging on either side of the large, golden crest of her father above the altar are two identical crests for the Erotoan Knights. A silver banner with white wings spread out over a central golden shield. He is standing next to the Great King in the place of the groom wearing his full set of formal armor that shines impeccably, almost like silver. He wears the white and gold trimmed tunic of the Erotoan Knights over the chain mail shirt but with a grand golden cape befitting the Captain. He holds his winged helm under his arm and is looking directly at Eve&#39;s direction. He is waiting for her.<br />
<br />
The music finishes just as the Princess finishes her walk to the altar. She curtseys to her father first of course, as King and as the officiate, and then to the man standing next to her. He bows deeply to her in return, one hand honorably on the hilt of his famous silvered sword, Silver Talon. &#39;He really is meant to be my husband.&#39;<br />
<br />
The Great King Edmond then lifts the golden veil over his daughter&#39;s head, nods to the young couple and addresses the crowd. &quot;People of Erotos, we have gathered here today to witness the marriage of my only daughter, Princess Eve, to the Lord Richard Whitestone, Captain of the Erotoan Knights.&quot; He turns to Richard. &quot;What say you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Richard bows his head out of respect and answers with a dutiful air, &quot;I accept the Princess Eve as my wife, and I will live everyone of my days serving her to the full extent of my vows to Erotos.&quot;<br />
<br />
Then both the Great King and Lord Richard turn to Eve. Finally close enough to him with his helmet off, she can appreciate just how perfectly handsome he is. Most times she had seen him in the castle, Richard had his helmet on or was a great distance away dealing with important affairs. But now she can really account for his looks up close. She always assumed he was a strong man as a knight, but his body is quite taller than she had realized. He has short, golden blonde hair neatly cut as befits a honorable warrior. He has a strong jaw that is cleanly shaven and very proud cheekbones that really define his face well. But then as if to offset his intensely good looks, Richard has these kind eyes that she did not expect, the lightest shade of blue that calm her just by gazing upon them. As he sees the Princess relax, he smiles the whitest smile she has ever seen. The Great King seems to notice this as well and allows a small smile himself. &quot;My dear Princess Eve, what say you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Eve responds just as she always was meant to, but with more hope. &quot;I accept the Lord Richard Whitestone as my husband.&quot;<br />
<br />
The King then nods and pulls out two plain silver rings from his own golden robe&#39;s pocket. He hands one to Eve and then one to Richard. Richard immediately kneels before her and holds his ring to her hand. Eve looks to her father and then to the crowd briefly, as this was not planned as part of the ceremony. But as she allows him to slide it on, he begins to say his vow. &quot;I Lord Richard Whitestone, Captain of the Erotoan Knights and Wielder of the White Wing, do solemnly vow to serve you Eve, daughter of Great King Edmond and Princess of Erotos, as your husband.&quot; Eve has worn many metal rings before, but this silver one feels strangely warm on her finger. Not like it was held close to body or pulled out of a fire, but as if it was left out in the sun and still held on to some of its radiance. Richard then stands and holds out his own hand.<br />
<br />
Perhaps out of turn, Eve then carefully kneels in her magnificent wedding gown and does the same as Richard once he removes his leather glove off of his left hand. &quot;I Eve, daughter of Great King Edmond and Princess of Erotos, do solemnly vow to serve you Lord Richard Whitestone, Captain of the Erotoan Knights and,&quot; she adds the title of his that she had never heard before, &quot;Wielder of the White Wing, as your wife.&quot;<br />
<br />
With the rings on and vows said, Richard helps Eve stand back up and the King holds his hands aloft and addresses the whole throne room with his booming voice. &quot;Then by the power of the Crown as Great King of Erotoa, I do declare you husband and wife.&quot; He lowers his hands and smiles at the new couple. &quot;You may now kiss the bride.&quot;<br />
<br />
Richard nods his head and politely leans forward and places a chaste kiss on Eve&#39;s lips. But her first kiss is quickly over as the crowd begins to applaud and cheer the new marriage and Richard turns to take her arm. She lets him and then as her father walks back to his throne, Richard leads her back down the aisle through the thundering applause with a composed stature of a disciplined warrior.<br />
<br />
Eve cannot believe it has finally happened. She is a married woman now and to such a unexpected person. But Lord Richard seems like an excellent choice so far. Where does the new couple go off to first?</p>
