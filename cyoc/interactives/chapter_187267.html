<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Willow&#39;s vision was consumed by white light, her ears rang from the sound of thunder in the distance, but as her senses cleared it was like looking into a nightmare, the wall opposite to where she was standing was no longer there, all that remained was a burning splintered hole, with shards of broken glass flung around the hallway, then her hearing came back into focus, the sounds of the world flooding back and overpowering the ringing in her ears, the cries of her people echoed throughout the forrest, the roar of wild fires leaping between the treetops, but most of all the cries of anguish and loss from inside the stables, suddenly Luna was at Willow&#39;s side &quot;my lady we must get out of here now, as far as we can, the western woods have fallen&quot; she called over the sounds of thunder and whistling in the air before earth shaking explosions shook the ground, sending birst of light along with them, but then Willow gasped as she saw what had happened in the stables.<br />
<br />
Mazy was on her knees, her swolen belly resting in her lap as she held Rose&#39;s limp body in her arms, Rose must have taken the blast for her and Trisha as she had a large shard of wood buried deep in the center of her chest, her skin now pale grey and her lips blue with trickles of blood from the sides, her nose was bleeding as well, and her left cheek was sliced up pretty badly, yet her belly was now once again flat, a blue round jem resting in her naval, but in that moment Willow didn&#39;t care, she simply got down next to Mazy, carful of her large round womb and hugged her greaving apprentice, joining her in her cries of sorrow.<br />
<br />
Suddenly Luna appeared in Willow&#39;s blurry vision, her tears still flowing as she looked up at her knights face, scrunched up in discomfort as her breasts hung free, still slowly growing in size, with clear outlines of a baby within each breast, yet Willow was in too much emotional pain to care, she only allowed herself to be heaved up by Luna while Trisha pulled Mazy away from Rose&#39;s body, but not before Mazy had grabbed the blue gem that Rose had left behind and mounted the two greasing pregnant women onto some kind of creature, Willow&#39;s tears so frequent and thick that she could not see what it was note could she muster the strength to feel anything but grief as darkness began to engulf her vision, her hands holding her belly as the caws and screeches of whatever creature they were on took to the sky, and Willow&#39;s world failed out, only the sounds of thunder and explosions failing into the darkness.<br />
___________________________________________<br />
<br />
When Willow awoke it was to the sound of the ocean lapping at the shore and the call of sea birds in the air the smell of salt in the air from a light breeze that entered the room, and Willow slowly opened her eyes, looking at the room she now found herself in, the bed she had been placed in was made of palm wood, with various pelts and furs as a blanket she had a wicker side table to her left with a copper candle holder on top, the candle inside almost melted down to the wick, the floor was made of what looked to be polished oak, with the walls appearing to be lined with dry bamboo, thick wooden pillars at every corner of the room, then turning to the left  Willow could see a open doorway that lead to the outside, the door stretching almost the entire wall, with silk curtains either side, the opposite wall had a large dresser with a mirror above it, and a door that Willow guessed would lead to some sort of wash room, then Willow saw a plant pot behind the candle and a lump formed in her throat when she saw the flower it contained in full bloom, it was a rose.<br />
<br />
Willow let forth a heart wrenching cry as her grief from last night once again washed over her and consumed her, she held her gravid pregnant belly for comfort as her babies began to stur from their slumber, but all Willow could do was cry, she had lost one of her apprentices, she jad basically lost a sister that&#39;s what it felt like but who would attack the western woods and why, and then Willow&#39;s eyes snapped open as it dawned on her, her thoughts going back to lady Dian and her crystal, suddenly the door infront of the bed opened and Willow had check twice at who was stood in the doorway.<br />
<br />
It was Luna, but her body had most certainly changed, she now wore no armor, and no clothing, not that either would fit her now, her hair looked like it had more of a shine to it, her skin was slightly darker with a light glow in her cheeks, her hips had widened and her thighs and ass seemed to have bulked up a bit, her natural muscle still faintly visible under her skin, but then there was the most obvious change was her breasts, they were enormous, each breast as big as a woman&#39;s womb when carrying twins, both perfectly round orbs attached to her chest as she cupped both hands under her enormous breats as she waddled over to Willow and sat on the foot of the bed.<br />
<br />
Between Willow&#39;s grief and shock she couldn&#39;t seem to find her voice to speak &quot;hello my lady, how do you feel?&quot; Asked Luna as she gave Willow a small smile, Willow buried her face in her hands as more tears threatened to overflow &quot;how I feel?, I feel like my heart has just been ripped from my chest&quot; said Willow sadly, suddenly groaning as her babies began to roll over, placing her hands atop her swell as the lumps of the babies bodies rolled accross her skin, Luna watched and gave a chuckle as she petted the sides of her breasts &quot;I know how you feel my lady, with the babies moving, I another begin to understand the pain of loosing an apprentice&quot; said Luna sadly.<br />
<br />
Willow then looked up from her brood filled belly and looked at Luna, she knew what had done this to her, the only question was why had the young in that crystal chosen to make their home out of Lunas breasts, watching in awe as one of the babies pressed what looked like a hand out beside her large dark nipple &quot;so....where are we?&quot; Asked Willow as she took her eyes off of Lunas large tits and began looking around once again, now avoiding the dresser and the flower, Luna then let out a groan as she stood up from the bed and spread her arms out wide as if making a declaration &quot;Welcome to Evenwood Island my lady, I would bow but I don&#39;t think I would ever get back up again&quot; giggled Luna as she ran her hands over her large breasts, an affectionate look on her face as she felt the babies moving within, Willow then gave a small chuckle as she heaved her pregnant form out if the bed and proceeded to walk into the other room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh just a word of warning my lady, the islands laws, well let&#39;s just say alot has happened while you were sleeping my lady&quot; said Luna as she drew back the silk curtain from the door....</p>
