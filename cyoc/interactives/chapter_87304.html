<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">He&#39;d been thinking about weight gain when he&#39;d come over, so maybe that was the way to go...  He looked up as Geoff came into the living room, sandwich in hand and plunked down onto the arm chair to his right.  As he watched Geoff cram a big bite into his mouth, he was sold on the concept.  His face flushed a moment and he went down to the weight tab.<br />
<br />
He scrolled through, finding the right options, hovering over the weight options. A check box. Weight to gain. Fat. Muscle. Both. Both had a set of percentage boxes... that might be interesting later, but for now he didn&#39;t want any extra muscle. He wanted pure flab. Geoff should be jiggly. At least for tonight. He checked the box for fat and then scrolled down to a box asking what he&#39;d Geoff&#39;s new weight to be. Big. That&#39;s what he wanted. A kind of big that might cause people to double take when they passed the blonde on the street. He was getting harder just thinking of it. He slid the laptop closer to hide his bulge.  His fingers hit the keys. 350. He backspaced. 400. Backspaced. It wasn&#39;t permanent... Geoff could be bigger, at least for tonight. With a wry smile he typed in 500. Stared at it... then backspaced once more, changing the number to 501. He wasn&#39;t sure why. But that extra final pound gave him a guilty thrill that the 500 just didn&#39;t do.<br />
<br />
A popup appeared, asking if he&#39;d like to alter the fitness level of his subject to better deal with excessive weigh. A sub note was below it &quot;please note that all adverse effects to health and fitness with the chronivac are merely simulation, and no harm will come to the subject should their fitness level be considered dangerous.&quot;. Aidan screwed up his face in a grimace that he was hoping Geoff didn&#39;t notice. it had been something he&#39;d worried about. He was actually relieved to know that Geoff could be out of shape and still safe.  It was because he had a scenario in his mind, and he wondered if he could actually do it.  The chronivac seemed pretty expansive and powerful...  He clicked no on the pop up and found the fitness slider, nudging it all the way down near the bottom.  He went off in search of what he really wanted next.<br />
<br />
Awareness.  There were a few standard options.  Subject aware, subject unaware, chonivac owner aware, or not.  Universe aware, or not.  He made sure he personally was the only one who would know Geoff had been a trim and muscular guy a few hours earlier.  He needed one last thing though... and with some searching, he found it.  The advanced awareness options, and just as he hoped, there was a large box for filling in text.  Hovering over it, the paper clip reappeared.  &quot;Use this field to write a specific set of memories to add to the subject.  You may use it to supply information that will be integrated into both their view of the world, as well as the worlds view on them.  All parties left unaware in the previous section will believe any info in this section to be true.  Note that this section cannot be used to force a subject to bring harm to themselves or others.&quot;  This is where Aidan&#39;s perversion would shine.<br />
<br />
Quickly, his fingers raced across the keyboard, cooking up a scenario for Geoff.  &quot;It was only months ago that Geoff was a fit and trim young guy heading out to a bar to meet some friends for a night of drinking,  He showed up early, only to find the other guys had to bail.  Not one to be shy of strangers, Geoff met a guy a little older than him and hit it off.   Laughing and telling stories into the night.  Geoff decided to go home with him for a one night stand.  The one night stand, however, became a much longer stay when he awoke the next morning to find himself strapped to some table with a tube down his throat.  The man he&#39;d fooled around with looming over him, standing next to a complicated machine.  Without a word, the man flicked it on, and a heavy, chocolatey slop pulsed through the tube, into Geoff&#39;s flat, tight stomach, causing it to quickly bow out.  Something buzzed around his cock at a low speed that became faster the fuller he got, keeping him hard, and only allowing him release when he was full.  This became routine, and over the next few months he watched his formerly muscled frame bloat out into a fat, soft blob, that jiggled with every movement.  Now, at 501 pounds and out of shape, his captor has released him, and he is slowly trying to get back to a normal life.  Except now, he&#39;s been trained.  He craves more weight, and a dominant man to help him gain it.  He hasn&#39;t shied away from telling his story to his friends, who aren&#39;t sure if they believe him.  Every night, he goes to gainer websites to see if maybe he can find someone to help him grow more.&quot;<br />
<br />
Aidan was a bit worried he&#39;d cream his own pants just thinking about it.  But he&#39;d re-read the scene and it sounded okay.  Gulping, he dragged the pointer to the accept button and sat back, staring at Geoff.  <br />
<br />
The change was almost instantaneous. Geoff looked confused as a flood of new memories poured into his brain.  Knocking out the trip he&#39;d taken to the south of France with his family last summer to a scenario where he&#39;d been force fattened by a mystery man.  His body had begun to bulk and swell as Aidan watched.  Geoff didn&#39;t seem to really notice as his flat stomach bulged over his waistband and his shirt started to tighten around it.  Or how his pecs started to soften into two dull ended bags of jell-o above his gut.  His arms and legs thickening in their constraints of clothing as Aidan realized he hadn&#39;t set Geoff&#39;s clothes to grow.  <br />
<br />
He went pale and tried to find the option, only to see that the chronivac wouldn&#39;t respond while it was working.  He watched the number near Geoff&#39;s weight quickly ticking upward.250 already as clothing strained to a breaking point.  Geoff was remembering when the restraints came off, and how weak he&#39;d felt.  His muscles likely gone into disuse as he&#39;d been strapped, unmoving on a table as his weight was forced higher.  His pants split in the seat.  Then the thighs.  Large spaces of pale skin showing between his legs as the fat swelled like bread dough out of the one open area in the snug denim. His belly spilling over his waistband as the button threatened to burst.  His shirt now hiked up all the way to under his new tits as the back split down the middle, and the arms gave way.  Soon his clothing was in tatters on the floor around the chair. 400 pounds came and quickly went.  Geoff still hadn&#39;t noticed.  <br />
<br />
He was remembering finding himself dropped off outside his apartment with just his keys and a large towel to cover himself up, and how much of a challenge it was for him to climb the stairs, unaccustomed to hauling his newly fattened body up the steps to his door.  How he panted and sweated, and got red in the face, and how it got him hard.  Aidan saw him look briefly embarrassed as that thought occurred to him, and he adjusted himself, pushing his belly aside slightly as if he was used to it.  With a few last snaps, his clothing fell to the floor in ribbons, and Geoff sat before him, rolls, bulges, dimples and some stretch marks.  501 was a lot on his short frame.<br />
<br />
He struggled to get to his feet, unsuccessfully, and waved Aidan over to help him.  Aidan got to his feet and helped heave his obese neighbor up to his chubby feet.  He wobbled unsteadily and panted. &quot;Thanks&#39; Aid.&quot;  He said, sounding winded.  &quot;Not as easy to get up anymore.  Guess trying on my old stuff was a bust huh?&quot; he said, looking down at the tatters on the floor.&quot;  Aidan nodded, looking him over.  Geoff hoisted his belly up slightly.  Aidan realized that his dick was mostly buried by flab and turned a bit red.  Geoff noticed and laughed awkwardly.  &quot;Sorry... sorry, I always forget about keeping this all covered now.  I guess with how that guy kept me naked all those months, growing, modesty kind of came a second thought.&quot;  He waddled into his bathroom and came back, towel pinned down by his hanging belly and clutched in one hand on his side.  <br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t suppose a fit guy like you could do his tubby neighbor a favor, would you?&quot; Geoff asked optimistically.<br />
&quot;Uh, sure, big fella&quot; Aidan said in a mock american accent, immediately feeling embarrassed by it. &quot;what can I do for you?&quot;  <br />
<br />
Geoff waddled again to his dining table and grabbed some cash from his billfold.  &quot;Run to that sports store down the street and buy me the biggest pair of pants and shirt you can find. I can&#39;t go to the pub naked, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
Aidan nodded with a smirk and headed off, coming back a half hour later, and having to help Geoff wriggle into a set of billowing pants and a shirt that were still a little too small on him when it was all over.  He panted and nodded in approval.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay then.  Let&#39;s hit the pub.I might need a breather or two on the way though.&quot;  He looked to Aidan, who&#39;d picked up his laptop already &quot;you can leave that here till we get back if you want.&quot;<br />
<br />
Aidan smiled and shook his head &quot;Nah, that&#39;s fine.  I have some things to do with it.&quot;  As he held open the door and watched his massive friend wobble and jiggle into the hall.</p>
