<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Now that I think of it, I&#39;m curious.&quot; Oli told Nate with a smile on her five-year-old face &quot;I wonder...just how many other people out there have been shrunk back down to Kindergarten? Hee-hee!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We could always watch the news to find out.&quot; Nate suggested. The little boy was honestly wondering the same thing as his wife.<br />
<br />
&quot;Great idea, Nate!&quot; and with that, she grabbed his tiny hand in hers, and with her other hand, grabbed the remote. They then sat right next to eachother on the bed as Oli clicked the TV on, and kept changing the channels. As tempted as she was to watch cartoons, her curiousity over what had happened to herself and her husband overrode that, so she kept clicking away until she finally got to the news channel.<br />
<br />
As they watched, they saw a five-year-old boy with light brown hair and blue eyes in a suit and tie sitting on the left side of a small news desk, with a five-year-old girl who had tan latino skin with brown eyes and short black hair.<br />
<br />
&quot;Greetings kids of the world...which would be just about EVERYONE at this point,&quot; the news boy said with a smile &quot;and welcome to the show. If you&#39;re just tuning in, then please don&#39;t change the channel. We promise this isn&#39;t a joke, this isn&#39;t a prank, and there is nothing wrong with your TV.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s right!&quot; the news girl added with her own adorable smile &quot;As of now, we are living in a world populated entirely by individuals five years of age or younger. Not a single grown-up left on the planet, and it ROCKS! Although we could be playing right now, we still feel that this story is too important...and way too FUN not to share with you all! We now go live to one of our reporters at the lab where this whole thing supposedly started. Over to you, Tammy!&quot;<br />
<br />
The scene then changed from the news room to inside a lab with a five-year-old girl in a reporter outfit with chocolate-colored skin, dark brown eyes, and short black hair in braids. A small golden nametag with her name &quot;Tammy&quot; was on the right side of her outfit under her shirt collar.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks Kelly!&quot; Tammy said with a smile as she carried her mike with her and the camera boy followed her as she walked around the lab &quot;I&#39;m now reporting to you live from the lab in which all of this started, and I&#39;m about to see if we can get the official scoop from one of the lead scientists who worked on this...ha-ha...LITTLE project!&quot;<br />
<br />
As the camera boy followed Tammy, she walked up to this other five-year-old girl. This girl was Asian, had dark brown hair done in twin ponytails on top of her head that reached to her waist, and in addition to her other clothes, wore a white lab coat, and lensless glasses with red rims. &quot;And who do I have the pleasure of speaking to today?&quot; Tammy asked her.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m Mei, hee-hee!&quot; she replied with a smile as she swung back and forth with her hands behind her back &quot;I&#39;m one of the people who run this place. I was gonna play tag with my lab friends, but...if you really wanna interview me, then I&#39;ve got time. In fact, I&#39;d be more than happy to share with everyone watching at home! Hee-hee-hee!&quot; and she happily waved at the camera, while Oli happily waved back.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know she can&#39;t see you, right?&quot; Nate asked with a half-smile and a raised eyebrow.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know,&quot; Oli replied with a smile &quot;but I still wanna.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You see,&quot; Mei began with a smile as she adjusted her glasses &quot;we were conducting an experiment to revive lost memories in order to make it so that having a perfect memory would be possible. We looked at the human brain from every possible angle, and found what we&#39;d been looking for. We were using high levels of energy in order to try and have our volunteer test subject remember his childhood more clearly, but in the process, the energy used in the experiment caused us to make contact with another &quot;Earth&quot;, one where something similar to this had happened, and the resulting radiation sent shockwaves through the lab, which then spread to the rest of the world in two huge waves. The first wave altered everone&#39;s bodies, and the second one not only resized the clothes to fit our new forms, but gave us what we&#39;d been after all along: perfect memories! It&#39;s sooo cool! I can remember all the way back to when I was born, but I won&#39;t talk about it on live TV since it&#39;s super-gross! Eh-heh-heh!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s understandable. I didn&#39;t wanna hear about all that icky stuff anyway!&quot; Tammy replied as she wrinkled her nose at the thought of it, then smiled and asked Mei &quot;So what other effects have you found that our global kiddification has had on the populace of the planet?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;After further study, and playing a few games of jump-rope,&quot; Mei explained with a smile as she adjusted her glasses again &quot;we&#39;ve found that our adult personas have fused with our kid personas, making for a wacky and fun time! Hee-hee! Sure, we still have all our adult smarts, but we&#39;re all full of childish energy and happiness. We&#39;ve also discovered that our cells, while they are still doing the jobs they&#39;re &#39;sposta do, are not being replaces with older cells as they die, but new ones just as fresh. In other words, no more aging! No one will ever grow up again, so we&#39;ll all be like this forever...hee-hee-hee...and that&#39;s fine with us! In addition, we&#39;ve found that we can stretch parts of our bodies to reach things, and make funny faces too!&quot; with that said, Mei pulled her own nose, and streched int out a whole foot in front of her face, then pushed it back in just as quickly, until it was back to a normal nose for the little girl that she was.<br />
<br />
&quot;I didn&#39;t know we could do that!&quot; Tammy told Mei with a large grin &quot;That&#39;s pretty cool! Anything else?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, since we&#39;re kids with a fusion of adult and kid memories and personalities,&quot; Mei replied with a smile &quot;The top scientists, myself included, have agreed to call us collectively by this new name: &quot;Kidults&quot;, and since we&#39;ve gotten reports of similar things happening to teenagers, they shall henceforth be called &quot;Kidteens&quot;...even though we&#39;re all five now, so aside from slight personality differences between Kidults and Kidteens, we&#39;re all pretty much the same, so we can all be friends! Hee-hee-hee!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks a bunch for you time, Mei!&quot; Tammy said while turning back to the camera with a huge grin &quot;I&#39;m gonna go play with Mei now, so...back to YOU, Kelly! Hee-hee!&quot;<br />
<br />
The scene swiched back to the newsroom as the news boy said to the viewers with a smile &quot;In other news, world leaders have decided to call off all current wars since being kids again has made them all realise just how dumb war really is. Besides, all weapons have been turned into harmless toys anyway. As for those who were already kids, an even more interesting tranformation has occured. We now go live to our man-er-BOY on the street. Take it away, Chad!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks, Danny!&quot; Chad replied with a smile. Chad had short orange hair, green eyes, and freckles on his face. He also wore a reporter outfit with his name on a golden nametag below the collar.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m here now with a young boy who has undergone a startling tranformation into an imp.&quot; he said as the three-year-old imp boy with light blue skin, short blue messy hair with short horns poking out of it, pointy ears, black eyes with yellow irises with slit pupils, small bat wings poking out the back of his shirt, and a spade-tipped tail poking out of a hole in the back of his pants came into view of the camera.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think you mean an AWSOME transformation!&quot; the imp boy added with a toothy grin &quot;I&#39;m Oliverth. I was nine before, but now I&#39;m three again, I can fly, and eat all the junk food I want without getting fat or anything else! The best part is, since my parents are five years old now, I don&#39;t havta listen to them anymore! Don&#39;t get me wrong . . . I still love them, but their authority means nothing to me when they&#39;re only two years older than me! My little sister became a fairy &#39;cause she&#39;s a goodie-goodie, and my baby sister became one of those Cherubs. I still think she&#39;s cute, but BOY is she annoying! Always try&#39;n ta stop me from havn&#39; any fun!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s not true, my dear older brother.&quot; a cute voice replied, which came from a Cherub girl with short blonde hair, blue eyes, pointy ears, white feathery wings on her back, a golden halo over her head, and wore only a pink diaper. She then smiled and said to the camera &quot;Greetings. I am Noel, and as you can see, I am a Cherub. I speak not just to this reporter with me, but to all those watching this broadcast to tell you of what I&#39;ve recieved in addition to this form: knowledge of other worlds. You see, there is another Earth where everyone became imps. They call themselves &quot;the innocent malace&quot;, and are ruled by a naughty imp girl called Princess, but she wasn&#39;t satisfied with ruling over just one Earth, so she tried to invade another one - this was one where the human population was becoming Baby Furs due to one Squirrel girl Baby Fur whose laughter accidentally trasformed others into more Baby Furs, and helped her build a sandcastle. Laughter was what spread it around. Those humans who were left - some of them became afraid, and wound of accidently summoning the Innocent Malace to their world. It was revealed by a spider that the Baby Furs were the key to stopping those Imps. However, . . . that&#39;s not the case here. The Imps of OUR world have no affiliation with Princess, and act on their own, while the Baby Furs of our world started as normal animals, and their laughter doesn&#39;t change anyone, but still brings joy. All animals are now Baby Furs, are the same size as us Cherubs, and just like us, they don&#39;t ever need their diapers changed.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Anyone ever tell you that you talke WAY too much?&quot; Oliverth told her with an annoyed look on his fiendish face, then turned to the camera with a smile and said &quot;This Princess, from what I&#39;ve heard, sounds like a real control-freak! I don&#39;t want ANYTHING to do with someone like THAT! My other Imped friends feel the same way. No one is MAKING us do ANYTHING! Besides, no one in this world can die anymore, so no harm, no foul, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks for all the info, you two.&quot; Chad told them with a smile &quot;Back to you, Danny.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks, Chad.&quot; Danny said with a smile as the scene switched back to the news room &quot;While the emergence of the Baby Furs has left some meat-lovers worried they&#39;d no longer be able to enjoy their favorite meals, it turns out that these fears were for nothing, as now thanks to the same power that transformed us all, the food in stores never runs out, and always reappears out of nowhere! We never run out of anything we need, and it&#39;s great!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And now,&quot; Kelly said with a smile on her face &quot;we go live to a word with the President on this whole matter.&quot;<br />
<br />
(click) Nate and Oli had heard all they needed to, and were very pleased.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can you believe what a cool world we live in now, Oli?&quot; Nate asked Oli with a smile on his face.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know, right?&quot; Oli replied to Nate with a smile &quot;A world of Kidults, Kidteens, Imps, Fairies, Cherubs, and Baby Furs! The best part is that none of us will ever grow up again! We can have as much fun as we want forever!&quot; and she kissed him right on the lips and told him with a smile &quot;Sorry about that, but your cootie supply was running low! Hee-hee-hee!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t mind it if they&#39;re YOUR cooties!&quot; Nate told her with a smile as he hugged her &quot;So what should we do now?&quot;</p>
