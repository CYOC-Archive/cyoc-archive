<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After being deputized by the sheriff; a anthro rhino furry, Scabs, Puss, Lankey and Slag were soon separated and assigned with a deputy. Lankey and Slag were to assist a female anthro Beaver Furry, while Pus and Scabs were soon paired with a male anthro raccoon furry. Both adult furries had several years on the police force and made it clear to the four teenagers that they were in charge and to follow orders. Scabs and Pus soon found them selves at a dirt road in the middle of the woods. The road was mostly used by logging trucks, but was frequented by locals who were avid hunters and nature enthusiasts.<br />
<br />
Being instructed to keep their glamors up despite being in the middle of nowhere, Scabs and Pus looked bored as the Racoon furry did paperwork in the patrol car.<br />
“I can’t believe skipping school forced us to become deputies,” Scabs growling as boredom began to set in; becoming a Doberman furry, Scabs did come to admire how well endowed he became. His abdomen looking cut as he could see despite the thick coat of brown fur, his abs showing through. Broad shoulders, thick muscles and a set of testicles big enough to act as tennis balls. He found the sheath keeping his new canine cock safe rather novel as he walked to a tree to relieve himself. Seeing the shaft peek out far enough for him to do his business did elicit a chuckle before he headed back to the patrol car.<br />
<br />
Pus was occupying his time by looking at social media, trying to see if there was any news of the furry virus. Despite his best efforts, all he could see in the latest feeds was the compound raid that took place in Silver Springs Montana earlier in the morning. A picture of two of the leaders posted; booking photos from the looks and brief clips of a press conference earlier. Apart from that, news has been slow; no mention of a wave of sex crazed bipedal animals running amok around the Seattle-Oregon border, no news of impending doom. Pus magically puts his cellphone away as he gets up from leaning on the police cruiser. Stretching he takes a few steps forward on his new bird like legs. The red feather covering his body ending just where his knees would be, however they were his ankles and he was walking with a digitigrade gait. His ankle down to his toes were covered in black scaly skin; the toes ending in black talons. Three toes in front while a forth toe was in the back. The Anthro Cardinal furry placed a taloned hand on his croth to marvel at the fact that his penis and balls where internal; a horizontal vent covered in a thick coat of red feathers covering his new avian manhood’s home.<br />
<br />
“Any news,” Scabs looking at his friend; “mass outbreaks, governments collapsing, humans resorting to anarchistic and cannibalistic behaviours?”<br />
“Only in your fantasies,” Pus responding; “everything is quite. All the news is focused on the crazies in Montana.”<br />
“Pity,” Scabs sighing; “I for one am itching for action.”<br />
<br />
If it was action that Scabs wanted, he was soon to be rewarded with it as a 4X4 truck riding high on a modified suspension complete with a motorized block and tackle attached to the bumper came barreling up through the dirt road. It soon came to a stop as the police cruiser blocked its path.<br />
The anthro Raccoon fury soon got out; his glamour active as he approached the truck with apprehension.<br />
“You kids stay back,” the officer speaking; “I know this guy, he can be a bit unhinged.”<br />
<br />
“Afternoon Steve,” the officer smiling as the man rolled down his window; “where you off to?”<br />
“I don’t see how that is any business of yours,” Steve speaking; “ just get your cruser out of the way and I’ll be off.”<br />
“Afraid I can’t do that,” the officer shaking his head; “road is closed; a logging truck rolled over and spilled its load,” the officer lying. “Just head back down the way you came and use the main roads.”<br />
“Like hell,” Steve getting belligerent; “Penny get daddy’s equalizer out now.”<br />
“Steve let’s not do this,” The officer already sensing trouble; “don’t do something that you will regret.”<br />
“The only thing I’m going to regret is letting you walk away if you try and impede me,” Steve getting out with a pump action shotgun and pointing it at the officer. “Now move your cruiser,” Steve cocking the weapon; “or I’ll move it over your dead bullet riddled cracass.”<br />
“Big mistake,” the officer glaring as his runes glow; dropping his glamour so the man can see the anthro raccoon furry staring him down.<br />
<br />
“Fuck me,” Steve swearing as he quickly aimed; “Penny you and your sister get out of here now!”<br />
Steve stares at the raccoon man approaching and pulls the trigger. The shotgun goes off but instead of the double aught buck striking the anthro, the shotgun backfires; blowing up in the man’s face killing him instantly. The sounds of girls screaming as they run from the truck and into the woods, made the police officer now a fury signal to Scabs and Pus to go after them.<br />
<br />
“Finally,” Scabs smiling through his muzzle as he bolts into the woods; “some action.”<br />
Pus shakes his feathered head and soon follows after. Both furries feeling surer footed with the terrain, they soon caught up with the fleeing girls. Pus using his magic runes to stop the gril he assumed was Penny while Scabs just ran into the other, dragging her down to the ground with a terrified scream. Both soon had their glamours dispelled as scab worked to rip off the clothes of the girl he had pinned down. Scab’s girl wouldn&#39;t stop screaming as he worked to get behind her, determined to mount and claim her; he soon had her pinned down and his rocket already in her as he worked to knot and climax inside her.<br />
<br />
“For fuck sakes Scab,” Pus shouting; &quot;stop scaring her. You may look like an animal but that doesn’t mean you should act like one!&quot; Pus emphasis this by approaching the girl her paralyzed with his magic runes and laid a passionate kiss; his grey avian tongue tangling with hers as he pushes his virus laden saliva into her. This had the effect of calming her down as the furry virus soon went to work; lowering her resistance to what would come next.<br />
“This will be enjoyable if you don’t fight,” Pus speaking calmly as he cancelled the paralysis spell and helped her remove her clothes. Guiding her down, Pus soon was behind her; his avain rod out of his vent and the tip pressing on the girl’s entrance.<br />
“Is your name Penny,” Pus speaking; getting a nod from the girl as he can see her already squirming to get his prick in her. He leans forward and moans as he pushes his shaft through her warm folds. Penny moaning as she felt the hard shaft invade her and then began pushing deeper as the Cardinal anthro above her began thrusting. <br />
“What is your sister’s name,” Pus moaning as he worked towards his climax; his shaft already slick with the pre cum he was excreting as well as the fluid’s Penny’s sex was leaking.<br />
“Elly,” Penny managing to stutter between gasps as sparks were dancing along her vision. The feeling of being stretched and filled was wondrous and she could do nothing to stop it, nor did she want to stop it. She was soon about to hit her peak.<br />
<br />
As the two male furries were busy rutting; the male raccoon furry soon approached, standing back at a respectable distance as he was stroking his shaft enjoying the show. The girl underneath the cardinal furry was developing a thick down of white feathers; her body becoming toned and lithe. Her face becoming bird like as her mouth and nose soon merged into an orange beak. Black feathers sprouted above her beak and around her eyes as her feet became webbed.<br />
“A mute swan furry,” the anthro raccoon moaned as he kept stroking his member. The girl under the Doberman furry was rapidly becoming a green feathered parakeet furry. Her earlier screams soon turning to moans as the furry virus did a number on her mind; her moans becoming louder as the Doberman furry’s knot soon tied the two together and caused the couple to squirm and scream in bliss as they achieved climax. It was not long until Pus and Penny climaxed as well. Runes appearing on the wrists and ankle of the two new female avian furries. The anthro Raccoon furry soon grunted as he climaxed from the show; instead of approaching them, he decided to head back to the truck and dead body; leaving the two new couples to enjoy the moment.<br />
<br />
“That was wonderful,” Penny breathing hard; her orgasm still roiling through her body as she is still on her hand talons and webbed feet. “If you don’t mind, what is your name?”<br />
“My friends call me pus,” the cardinal furry speaking; “truthfully, I hate that nickname. Please call me Rudolph. Rudolph Rot-Feder.” Adopting a new name more befitting of his furry form.<br />
“Rot-Feder,” Penny managing to crawl out from under the cardinal furry; “what does that mean?”<br />
“Its German for Red Feather,” Rudolph helping the new mute swan furry up; “my family is from Germany originally. My grandparents kept telling stories about how they escaped the East German Stazi by fleeing to West Germany in a hot air balloon. That’s scabs by the way,” Rudolph pointing to the Doberman furry who was still pumping his seed into Elly now a green feathered Parakeet furry. “Looks like your sister went avian like you.”<br />
“You done your deed. Let her up,” Penny prodding the Dobberman furry.<br />
“Not until my knot deflates,” Scabs panting; “or did you miss the lesson in animal anatomy in school?”<br />
“Dad home schooled us,” Penny answering; “he was what you called a doomsday prepper.”<br />
“I’m sorry,” Rudolph looking back towards the truck that can be barely seen in the distance; “I think he died from his wounds. And I’m sorry if we frightened you both earlier,” Rudolph adding; “but becoming a furry does have its benefits.”<br />
<br />
Penny looked into the eyes of the Cardinal Furry who was showing her kindness and smiled; feeling safe with him she hugged the cardinal furry. Her firm breasts pressing up with his broad strong looking chest as she enjoyed the feeling of his crimson feathers brushing with her white feathers. The thought of being his mate, made her swoon with pleasure as she started rolling the name Penny Rot-Feder through her mind.<br />
“Let’s head back,” Penny pulling away; “I want to say my good byes to dad’s corpse.”<br />
“Okay,” Rudolph nodding before turning to scabs; “when your done Scabs, help Elly up and escort her back to the cruiser.”<br />
“Yeah yeah,” Scabs still enjoying the moment before looking at the parakeet furry tied to him. “Elly is a cute sounding name. My name is Henry. Of course you can call me Scabs if you like,” the Doberman furry speaking softly; “I answer to either.”<br />
“What is your full name,” Elly finally speaking after the ordeal of being forcibly violated and then finding the sensation of being dominated and bred enjoyable as the furry virus began to change her.<br />
“Henry Knotlock,” he answers quickly; finding his new furry surname easier to speak coming from his new muzzle.<br />
“I think you are flaccid enough to pull out of me know,” Elly still quivering from her first furry orgasm.<br />
“I’ll try to be gentle,” Henry speaking as he slowly gets up; meeting some resistance and hearing Elly wince in mild pain, he pauses before giving a quick yank and manages to pull out of Elly with a noticeable pop and an audible squawk from Elly below. Looking down he can see her swollen feathery sex leaking his seed as his rod is still stiff. Helping her up on her new avian legs as he offers her a hand-paw; “shall we head back?”<br />
“Yes,” Elly still feeling dazed over what just happened.</p>
