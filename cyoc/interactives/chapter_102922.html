<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Barbara and Claire walked into Claire&#39;s apartment and the two decided to stick around and have some coffee and lunch, with what was left of Claire&#39;s food stores.  Claire was able to make some sandwiches and the two started to talk.<br />
<br />
&quot;So,&quot; Claire started, &quot;tell me about yourself.  Where did you come from?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well,&quot; Barbara answered, &quot;my family came from Montana.  A bit near the center of the state.  My dad got a job here in Moon Lake.  It was at that point that we found out the secret.&quot;<br />
<br />
Claire thought for a moment and remembered her own feelings when she discovered that weres were real.  Barbara continued, &quot;And, as you probably already know when a family moves into Moon Lake, at least one of those family members has to become a were of some sort.  My parents were terrified to say the least.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can understand that,&quot; Claire responded.  &quot;Why did you decide to become a werewolf?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Soon after I moved here, I started to go to school at Moon Lake High School.  Unlike in the college, most of the kids are already weres, and most of them were naturally born were.  As a normal, I stuck out like a sore thumb.&quot;  She took a bite of her food as she continued to think.  &quot;Most of the kids were nice to me, but there were some bullies.  I remember one day I was being teased by some of the weres there when I met Ryan.  He stood up for me against these bullies.&quot;<br />
<br />
Claire couldn&#39;t help notice the parallels between her and Barbara.  Barbara then continued, &quot;It was at that point that I started to fall in love with him.  I liked his blonde hair.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And his blue eyes,&quot; Claire added.<br />
<br />
&quot;And his sideways grin that looks so handsome.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And the way he always helps people.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And can&#39;t forget his hot body.&quot;<br />
<br />
Both Barbara and Claire looked at each other and giggled, as they were both talking about the same man.  Barbara continued, &quot;It wasn&#39;t long before I fell in love with the boy, and then I learned he was a werewolf.  I realized that if I wanted to be with him, I would need to be a werewolf as well, and I was prepared for that.  My parents were initially against it at first, but seeing as someone in the family had to become a were, it didn&#39;t take long for me to convince them.  It was either me or them.  So, at the next pack meeting, Ryan pulled me to the side and that&#39;s where he changed me.&quot;  Barbara&#39;s face flushed red as she remembered the experience.  &quot;It was one of the most magical times of my life.&quot;<br />
<br />
Claire thought for a moment and asked, &quot;So, are you and Ryan still a couple?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, um, no, not at this time,&quot; Barbara said, with a bit of hesitation. &quot;I mean, we did have a relationship for a while, but then we sorta grew apart.  I had my photography gig, and he wanted to be a cop.  We still see each other when the need strikes, but it seemed like he wasn&#39;t as interested in me as I was with him.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see,&quot; Claire said, &quot;Do you have any other family members that are weres?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, my parents are still normal, although I&#39;ve tried to get them to turn were as they&#39;re getting older.  My older brother fell in love with a weretigress, and he&#39;s now a weretiger, and my younger brother is still in college, and still a normal.&quot;  Barbara took another bite of her food and then asked Claire, &quot;So, you grew up in Alaska?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yup, in the middle of nowhere,&quot; Claire said with a bit of a grin.  &quot;The nearest town was about sixty miles south, and the nearest neighbor was about ten miles away.  It was just me, my parents, and my two brothers.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow,&quot; Barbara said with a bit of surprise.  She couldn&#39;t even fathom growing up with no one around.  &quot;So, what did you do for school?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I was more or less homeschooled by my mom.  I also did some internet classes so I could get grades and graduate from high school.  I mean, it was nice and all because it allowed me to do some nature photography, but at the same time, it was rather lonely.  I didn&#39;t have the same experience that most high school kids have.  Never had a group of girlfriends to gossip with, never had a boyfriend, no football team to cheer for, not even a prom to go to.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow,&quot; Barbara said with a sympathetic look, &quot;I can&#39;t even imagine.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, that&#39;s my life,&quot; Claire responded.  &quot;When I graduated high school, I decided to leave the state to find new adventures and make new friends.  I heard about Moon Lake from my friends and I decided to come here.  I had no idea what I would find here.&quot;<br />
<br />
Barbara smiled and said, &quot;Dear, no one who comes here does.&quot;  The two smiled at each other.<br />
<br />
Claire thought for a moment and asked, &quot;Um, Barbara?  Could I ask a favor?&quot;<br />
<br />
Barbara tilted her head a bit and said, &quot;Sure?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Could you, um, show me your wolf form?&quot;  Claire looked up Barbara with some puppy dog eyes.<br />
<br />
Barbara tried to stifle some laughter and then said, &quot;Sure, why not?  It&#39;s not like you&#39;re not going to see this if you change.&quot;  Barbara stood up and walked towards the center of the living room.  Barbara started taking off her clothes when Claire looked away.  Barbara saw this and smiled, &quot;Don&#39;t be so bashful dear.  If you&#39;re going to be a were, you&#39;ll need to get comfortable with a bit of nudity.&quot;  Claire turned back to Barbara and continued to watch as Barbara started to take off her clothes.  As Barbara&#39;s breasts were revealed, Claire couldn&#39;t help compare her A-cup breasts to Barbara&#39;s D-cups.  As Barbara took of her pants and panties, she said to Claire, &quot;Tip if you become a werewolf.  Don&#39;t bother shaving, as it&#39;ll all grow back when you change.&quot;  Claire chuckled at the joke.  Once Barbara was naked, she concentrated for a bit, and brown fur started to appear all over her body.  She grew in size, and not just height, but chest size and hips as well.  Her feet became digitigrade, and her ears grew into points and traveled to the top of her head.  Her nose and lips jutted out to a muzzle, and Claire noticed that her teeth were all sharp and pointy.  As Barbara finished changing, she stood up proudly as a female werewolf and looked at Claire with her brown eyes.  Claire watched with fascination and then stood up and walked to Barbara.<br />
<br />
&quot;Would it be all right if I feel you?&quot; Claire asked.  Barbara nodded her head, and then Claire started to rub her hands on Barbara&#39;s body.  She started with the arms, and she could feel the fur and muscles underneath.  Although not as muscular as Ryan, Claire could feel that as a werewolf, Barbara had some strength.  Barbara&#39;s fur felt so soft as well, and she could feel the warmth.  Claire&#39;s hand traveled up Barbara&#39;s arms and towards her shoulders.  Claire was impressed with what she felt so far, and her hands traveled down Barbara&#39;s chest.  She felt Barbara&#39;s breasts, and they had grown a bit from her human form.  She could feel the weight of the breasts, and noticed that they didn&#39;t sag for being so big.  Claire then traveled down Barbara&#39;s stomach down to her crotch.  She noticed that part of her was still a bit human-like, unlike Ryan&#39;s sheath.  She avoid touching Barbara&#39;s vulva and instead continued down her legs to her feet.  She examined Barbara&#39;s feet as she remain standing, and marveled at how the well balanced the feet were despite standing on essentially the balls of her feet.  After Claire finished examining Barbara, she stood up and said, &quot;Wow, your body is amazing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you,&quot; Barbara said.  &quot;And I&#39;d imagine that if you became a werewolf, yours would be too.  Not that yours isn&#39;t already.&quot;  Claire both smiled and blushed at the compliment.<br />
<br />
It was then a knock on the door could be heard, and Ryan&#39;s voice came from the door.  &quot;Claire?  Are you there?  It&#39;s me, Ryan.&quot;</p>
