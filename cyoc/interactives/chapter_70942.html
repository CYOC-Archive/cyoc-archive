<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Instead of taking volunteers, we will CHOOSE who will be next&quot; said Stephen with a smirk.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&quot; said Madame Illusia, pointing to the back of the room. &quot;The gentleman - and I DO mean gentleman - just <br />
about to leave&quot;<br />
<br />
Eyes turned to see a tall, very handsome, very well-dressed young man who had stopped to look in and was <br />
turning away. Madame Illusia caught his eye and he felt a sudden and irresistible force pulling him to the <br />
stage.<br />
<br />
Murmurs of amusement and envy broke out in the crowd as the young man walked up the stage, the heels of his <br />
expensive shoes clicking smartly on the wooden floor.<br />
<br />
&quot;What is your name SIR?&quot; asked Madame Illusia's son with a grin. &quot;What brings you here, what is your age and <br />
what do you want tonight?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There is nothing I want from you&quot; he said. &quot;I am a law student. I am 23. I have everything I want. My name is <br />
Timothy Porter. I was on the way to a fraternity party. I just stopped by - I have no interest in this freak <br />
show at all&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah! Freak show!&quot; said Madame Illusia. &quot;A gentleman who has everything! In that case, the question should be - <br />
what can YOU give to others! I will show you!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I am not interested&quot; said Timothy Porter.<br />
<br />
&quot;I did not ask your opinion!&quot; said Madame Illusia. &quot;You have so much, as you say! It is time to share and for <br />
us to enjoy the profits! Here is a man who has all the world has to offer! So much - and most people have so <br />
little. It's time to share the wealth - whether you like it or not.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm leaving&quot; said Timothy Porter. But he could not move his feet. His will seemed like jello. &quot;What is going <br />
on?&quot; he said, his voice shaking slightly.<br />
<br />
Stephen smiled and announced to the crowd. &quot;It's auction time! Mr. Timothy Porter, law student will auction <br />
off all of his possessions to member of the audience willing to bid. Everything he has is up for sale&quot;<br />
<br />
The unruly audience roared its approval.<br />
<br />
&quot;WHAT?&quot; cried Timothy. &quot;Let me out of here!&quot; But his feet felt as if they were glued to the floor.<br />
<br />
A cry of delight rose from the audience.<br />
<br />
Madame Illusia looked over the tall and good looking young man, from his head of thick, carefully groomed <br />
blonde hair to his very expensive upper class clothes: navy blue sports jacket, white starched button down <br />
shirt, pressed khaki trousers and her eyes rested on his gleaming mahogany colored tasseled dress loafers.<br />
<br />
&quot;A true upper crust, preppy gentleman. We will start with those beautiful shoes you are wearing” she said with <br />
a nasty smile.<br />
<br />
“My SHOES?” said Timothy. “What about them?”<br />
<br />
“Didn't you hear us? What's the matter with you boy! They are going to be SOLD! Take them off! It's time to <br />
sell your fancy shoes to the highest bidder&quot; she snapped.<br />
<br />
Timothy went white with fear and anger. &quot;Take my SHOES off? On this dirty floor?! In a CARNIVAL! No!  NO!&quot; But <br />
he suddenly felt a strange compulsion. <br />
He tried with all his might to fight it. <br />
<br />
“I said TAKE OFF YOUR SHOES!” said Madame Illusia in a voice of steel.<br />
<br />
&quot;You seriously think I am going to sell my SHOES?” cried Timothy.<br />
<br />
“I don’t THINK anything!” she snarled. “I KNOW! Now get those shoes off and SELL THEM!”<br />
<br />
Timothy’s head was light and swimming. Something strange was in the atmosphere. His willpower was under <br />
attack.<br />
<br />
“But I...I am not wearing any socks&quot; said Timothy. The audience laughed as he struggled with the demand. <br />
Finally, against his will, he very slowly slid one foot out of his right shoe and then took off the other. <br />
<br />
&quot;Now pick them up and PRESENT them to the audience of buyers!&quot; commanded Madame Illusia. “Show the soles and <br />
the inside of them! A FINE shiny pair of expensive shoes!”<br />
<br />
The barefoot preppy law student shook his head in confusion and frustration, but he picked up his $500 shoes <br />
and showed them to the cheering crowd, lifting then up and showing them from all sides. <br />
<br />
&quot;SELL THEM!&quot; Stephen yelled. “Get out there and give them a sales pitch!“<br />
<br />
Timothy, helpless and terrified, found himself saying words that were not his own at all – but they poured out <br />
of his mouth in a torrent of energy.<br />
<br />
&quot;What would you bid for these beautiful Brooks Brothers shoes, fresh from the pampered feet of a preppy law <br />
student. Brand new. The finest leather. Just LOOK at those tassels! Size ten. No wear on the soles. What would <br />
you pay?&quot; <br />
<br />
Timothy couldn't believe he was walking up and down a sleazy carnival stage on his naked white feet, selling <br />
his own shoes - the new loafers he had bought for law school. But he was under the control of another.<br />
<br />
&quot;One dollar!&quot; came a shout. &quot;Two&quot; &quot;three!&quot; The bidding went on until it reached $20 and stopped. The winner <br />
was a very old thin man in flip flops and polyester who came up and handed the $20 to Timothy- and Madame <br />
Illusia grabbed the money.<br />
<br />
“Now hand over me your shoes” The old man gave Timothy a mean grin. “I’ll pay you another dollar if you get <br />
down on your hands and knees in those fine clothes and put them on my feet for me, son”<br />
<br />
Timothy shuddered with humiliation.<br />
<br />
The old man handed out a dollar. “I always like to humble a rich man when I can. I don’t know why you are <br />
selling the fancy shoes right off your feet though.”<br />
<br />
&quot;Get down on all fours and put the shoes on the winner&quot; Madame Illusia snarled.<br />
<br />
Timothy felt himself drop to his knees against his will and put his own $500 shoes on the dirty feet of this <br />
old man. Inside he resisted and cried out in anger but outwardly he could only obey. Stephen leaned over and <br />
slapped the soles of his bare feet while he was kneeling. &quot;Get up off your knees pretty boy! Now we're gonna <br />
sell that smart sports coat you got on!&quot; Stephen roughly grabbed at the sleeve.<br />
<br />
Timothy groaned, but was forced to slide the tailored navy blue jacket off his broad shoulders and held it up. <br />
The bidding began again. Suddenly a hand went up. A young bald redneck yelled &quot;I'll give you a hundred buck <br />
for your high class coat!&quot; A buzz of surprise moved through the audience and a smattering of applause.<br />
<br />
&quot;IF...&quot; silence in the crowd. &quot;IF&quot; he continued &quot;I get all your pretty blonde HAIR too!&quot;<br />
<br />
A shocked silence was followed by a roar of applause and laughter.<br />
<br />
&quot;WHAT?&quot; gasped Timothy. &quot;My HAIR!!! That is a joke right?&quot;<br />
<br />
Madame Illusia shouted with laughter. &quot;OF COURSE MY FRIEND! Everything is up for sale!&quot;<br />
<br />
Stephen snarled &quot;Time to get rid of the hair pretty boy!&quot;<br />
<br />
The bald redneck screamed with laughter. &quot;And two hundred if I get to shave his head myself!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;We happen to have clippers right here!&quot; Stephen announced and pulled out of nowhere a pair of heavy duty hair <br />
clippers.<br />
<br />
Timothy gasped &quot;You...you CAN'T take my hair! I can't sell my HAIR. I have class tomorrow! Job interviews! I <br />
can’t leave here with a bald head!&quot;<br />
<br />
Stephen smirked. &quot;Don't you worry mister high and mighty. It will all work out. You have no CHOICE&quot;<br />
<br />
The bald redneck stepped up and smiled at the handsome, privileged preppy law student and looked at his full <br />
head of beautiful, shining blonde hair. He held a paper bag.<br />
<br />
&quot;I lost all ma hair when I was a young'un. I hate bein' bald. But it gives me pleasure to take the hair away <br />
from an uppity man like you - with a full head of nice, thick hair. Blonde too! Make you into a BALDIE like <br />
me! Say goodbye to your pretty hair boy! I'm gonna put it in this sack to keep.&quot;<br />
<br />
Timothy was helpless to resist. He put his hand to his hair for one last time. <br />
<br />
The redneck grinned. &quot;That's right boy. Next time you put your hand there it will be smooth skin. You're too <br />
tall for me to cut your hair off from where I stand. Get down on all fours again&quot;<br />
<br />
Laughter broke out from the audience as the humiliated preppy got back down on his hands and knees. The <br />
redneck couldn't resist slapping his khaki covered rear end. <br />
<br />
&quot;Bark like a dog boy!&quot; shouted someone in the audience.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good idea&quot; shouted the bald redneck. He lifted Timothy's leg. &quot;When I squeeze your toes, bark like my pet <br />
dog!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do it&quot; snapped Madame Illusia. The redneck squeezed the toes that had recently been inside $500 loafers, <br />
resting on the pedal of a Mercedes. The handsome and shamed law student let out a bark. Laughter followed.<br />
<br />
The redneck placed the clippers to his forehead. He pushed them back slowly. A curtain of gold fell away as a <br />
white path opened up on his scalp; the redneck gathered up the hair and put it in his bag. The audience <br />
shouted with laughter and encouragement. Five inches of perfectly groomed blonde hair gave way slowly to <br />
stubble. The blades were changed and the last of the stubble was cleared away. Timothy Porter, third year law <br />
student, was now completely bald. <br />
<br />
“From pretty boy to cueball! Get up boy!” The redneck held up the pile of golden hair to the cheering crowd <br />
and put it back in the bag. <br />
<br />
“Lost your uppity shoes and your pretty boy hair. What’s next?” The redneck looked him up and down and said to <br />
Timothy “I’ll give you another hundred for those nice rich-city-boy pants and that classy white shirt you got <br />
on. But I want to hear you sell ‘em to the crowd first to see if there is a higher bid” His grin was wide and <br />
wicked. <br />
<br />
Timothy whispered: “My pants. I have to take off my trousers in front of this wild crowd? I’m bald. I’m <br />
barefoot. Now I have to sell my PANTS. This is a nightmare but it’s real.”<br />
<br />
Madame Illusia hissed at him: “It’s real. You’re selling EVERYTHING”<br />
<br />
Stephen laughed. “Get goin’ mister law student! Use a real sales pitch to sell the shirt and pants off your <br />
back.<br />
<br />
The bald law student stepped to the front of the stage and cried out “How much will you pay for these Brooks <br />
Brothers khaki trousers I have on? And what will you bid for this high class white shirt I’m wearing! From a <br />
genuine, bona fide preppy law school student! I already have a one hundred dollar offer!”<br />
<br />
He was horrified by his own words – but he was being directed to say all of this. <br />
<br />
Suddenly a voice rang out. “I’ll give you five hundred for ‘em!”<br />
<br />
Timothy stared at the voice. A huge fat man in overalls appeared. “Five hundred – if you throw in your CAR.”<br />
<br />
“My car…” whispered Timothy.<br />
<br />
The fat man walked up to the stage. “I saw you getting’ out of a fine looking Mercedes Benz. I thought ‘Look <br />
at the rich preppy in his fancy car.’ NOW look at you boy! Since you’re selling EVERYTHING, I wanna buy you <br />
CAR too”<br />
<br />
Madame Illusia yelled “Of course! The Mercedes is for sale! Any other offers? No? SOLD!”<br />
<br />
Timothy desperately tried to protest, but the words would not come. This man was going to buy his state of the <br />
art Mercedes for $500! How would he drive home?<br />
<br />
&quot;Well what are you waitin' for - strip off your rich boy pants! and that pretty shirt&quot; he yelled. &quot;I'm payin' <br />
for 'em! I'll throw in $5 for your belt!&quot;<br />
<br />
The redneck who bought the hair and coat gave the money to Madame Illusia and took the expensive Brooks <br />
Brothers sports jacket and his bag of hair. “Guess somebody else got you shirt and pants!”<br />
<br />
Stephen pulled roughly at his khakis. &quot;TAKE OFF YOUR PANTS! Drop them pretty boy!&quot;<br />
<br />
Timothy, bald and barefoot and stunned, stared at the fat man. Was this really happening? He took out his <br />
wallet and keys - which Madame Illusia grabbed. He unbuckled his belt and his khakis dropped to the ground. <br />
Whistles and cheers broke out in the audience at the sight of his lean, muscular legs. He took off his shirt <br />
and the fat man took everything. &quot;Thanks for the car boy!&quot;<br />
<br />
Timothy was left in his silk shorts and tee shirt and his wristwatch. His life seemed to be destroyed. But <br />
there was more.<br />
<br />
Madame Illusia went on. “Don’t leave yet! Timothy has still more to sell! Who would like to have some of this <br />
preppy law student’s ambition? A lawyer’s ambition! THAT is something to have!”<br />
<br />
&quot;My ambition&quot; thought Timothy with horror. &quot;She CANNOT take THAT from me! Can she? NO! NO!&quot;<br />
<br />
Timothy stood on the stage in his underwear with his gold watch, bald and exhausted “Who wants to buy my <br />
ambition?”<br />
<br />
An old man grabbed a young man next to him and dragged him up to the stage.<br />
<br />
“I’ll give you fifty dollars for all of your ambition! I want it for my son!”<br />
<br />
The bored looking son just stared. “Sold” said Madame Illusia and took the money. She ran her hand across <br />
Timothy’s face. He shuddered and a current of energy moved from him into the young man. Timothy’s shoulders <br />
slumped and the young man stood up straight.<br />
<br />
“Now auction off your underwear” said a relentless Madame Illusia.<br />
<br />
Timothy said in the same salesman voice “How much will you pay for a law student’s high quality designer <br />
underwear?”<br />
<br />
The bids began. So many! The amounts kept rising. Finally, one loud voice said “ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS!”<br />
It was the same man who had bought his shoes.<br />
<br />
“SOLD” said Madame Illusia and the man came up to Timothy, still wearing the shiny tasseled loafers he had <br />
purchased. His feet clicked on the way up while Timothy’s bare feet made no noise now.<br />
<br />
&quot;I love these shoes I bought off you. Real comfortable! Now I'm gonna take off your high class underwear, son” <br />
said the old man. “It’s mine now. I never bought another man’s skivvies before. Look at you now. You got a <br />
different future. You ain’t gonna be a lawyer. You looked like you never wore a pair of shoes in your life! <br />
Now quit stallin' – and get down on your hands and knees. i want you on all fours again”<br />
<br />
Timothy got down once again. The old man grabbed the tee shirt and dragged it off him. Then he stood behind <br />
him and reached for his his shorts. &quot;Lift one leg at a time!&quot; The old man grinned as he yanked off the law <br />
student's shorts. <br />
<br />
“I want to buy something else. I want to buy your handsome nose. I'll give you a hundred, plus my nose in <br />
exchange&quot; said the old man.<br />
<br />
&quot;You can't buy my nose. That...that is impossible&quot; gasped a tearful Timothy. &quot;How can I...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sold!&quot; said Madame Illusia<br />
<br />
Timothy’s long, beautifully shaped, aristocratic nose cracked, broke and spread - growing larger and uglier. <br />
the old man's fat, ugly nose grew narrower and its shape became beautiful - he now had Timothy’s nose and <br />
Timothy had his.<br />
<br />
&quot;You ain't good lookin' anymore boy&quot; said the old man &quot;With no hair and a broken nose&quot;<br />
<br />
“What is your IQ Eric?” demanded Madame Illusia.<br />
<br />
“135” whispered a shattered Timothy.<br />
<br />
“Sell fifty points of your IQ” she snapped.<br />
<br />
Timothy was now completely broken.<br />
<br />
He took a deep breath and announced “Who will buy some of my IQ?”<br />
<br />
The  man who bought his ambition was still there with his son “Another fifty bucks. I want my boy to be a <br />
bigshot lawyer!”<br />
<br />
The son whispered something. The man added “My son wants your fancy gold wristwatch. I’ll give you twenty <br />
bucks”<br />
<br />
Stephen shouted &quot;Well, you sure ain't gonna be a bigshot lawyer now! And you won't be needing a watch!&quot;<br />
<br />
“You want to take away my intelligence and my watch and give them to your son” Timothy said in a daze.<br />
<br />
&quot;YUP!&quot; said the man.<br />
<br />
The naked law school student just nodded. He took off his Rolex. Madame Illusia passed a hand over his face <br />
again and he shuddered again and energy went from him into the young man.<br />
<br />
The young man’s eyes shone with intelligence and confidence. Timothy’s eyes went dull. His mouth dropped open. <br />
His IQ was a mere 85.<br />
<br />
Stephen sneered &quot;So pretty boy - are you gona be a lawyer?&quot;<br />
<br />
Timothy stuttered. &quot;I...don't know - I don't think I know what a lawyer is&quot;<br />
<br />
The audience screamed with laughter.<br />
<br />
Madame Illusia announced “Our young friend won’t be returning to his fancy law school or wearing tasseled <br />
shoes! Not now! The world of professional success will be closed to him. HE CANNOT BE A LAWYER! He will have a <br />
new life! Who will give our friend a job in his new life? And his name can’t be a fancy high class name like <br />
Timothy Porter. Who wants to give our bald, naked friend a new name too?”</p>
