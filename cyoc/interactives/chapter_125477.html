<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">This was fun but you still had an hour of class time to fill and you wanted to do more, so much more. &quot;Class, I&#39;m not sure I&#39;m teaching you properly.&quot; You leaned over a student&#39;s desk. &quot;Adam, describe what it feels like to surge with masculinity.&quot;<br />
<br />
His gaze was unable to pull away from the cleavage in his face.&quot;Good&quot; was all he managed to say.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jennifer, could you briefly describe the intensity of emotions tied to protecting ones family from the perspective of a woman.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Um, strong? You mean like the mama bear instinct right?&quot; <br />
<br />
You pondered for a moment on how to answer, &quot;I&#39;m glad you understand the concept but I feel I&#39;m not preparing you for the world if you don&#39;t understand how it feels. I&#39;m going to try something different for the rest of class.&quot; You said releasing the forced erections and magically reverting their balls to normal. Each male sighed loudly in relief. The tension in the room quickly abated.<br />
<br />
&quot;For this, I need a student of each gender. Mark, thank you for volunteering.&quot; <br />
<br />
Mark sat upright and looked scared, &quot;But I didn&#39;t...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Please stand in front of the class.&quot; You said. Mark was a freshmen, and looked like puberty was taking its time getting around to him. &quot;Abigail, would you join Mark in the front of the class?&quot; Abby was in a similar situation and looked quite tomboyish.<br />
<br />
With a thought, all the students in class were in their swimsuits, and you reverted to your natural form so you could partake in the fun. This all happened without anyone realizing and you ensured the students would still treat you like a teacher. <br />
<br />
&quot;Alright class, we are going to review basic concepts but will get some new insight into old material.&quot; You said loudly. &quot;Starting with Mark, what signs are there that he is beginning puberty? Colin?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Armpit hair.&quot; Colin said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Very good. We will all assume he has the same around the groin. Between now and full maturity, what other changes will he expect? Dave?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He will grow taller.&quot; As soon as he finished saying this all the boys in the room, you included, grew to adult height.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good, all you guys, walk around for a few seconds, get your bearings, then we will discuss how it feels.&quot;<br />
<br />
All the males in the class got up and walked around, after examining how it felt they sat back down. &quot;Good class now how does it feel?&quot;<br />
<br />
Chad answered without raising his hand, &quot;I thought I would feel more powerful or something but I feel basically the same. Maybe more capable, like I can reach in cabinets better.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes! It is common for height to be glorified, but unless you are a basketball player, it only matters if you are putting lots of things you need to access daily on the uppermost shelf. Very good Chad. What else?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Muscles!&quot; came a quick reply from the back which was met with laughter, then excitement as all the boys in the room immediately beefed up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Go ahead, walk around see what it feels like to be adult sized.&quot;  the boys again stood up and walked around bumping into each other and things because they took up more space. After a moment they all returned to their seats.<br />
<br />
&quot;Could someone describe for the girls how it feels to be muscular?&quot;<br />
<br />
Blake decided to chime in, &quot;I feel the same. Bigger, stronger obviously, but like height its just functional.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Exactly class, I couldn&#39;t have said it better than Blake, its just functional. strong or weak, short or tall, none of it changes who you are. A girl this time, Angela.  Mark is looking like a very tall and muscular boy, what will make him more of a man?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The book states body and facial hair appears and the sweat glands become more active.&quot; Angela said reading from the book. <br />
<br />
&quot;True, but please put the book away, I want this to be a more visceral experience for you. Look at Mark, what about him seems out of place?&quot;<br />
<br />
She looked up at Mark and cocked her head, &quot;His face still looks boyish.&quot; Before her eyes his bone structure changed as well as that of every other boy in the room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is that better?&quot; you ask<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes.&quot; she says staring intently.<br />
<br />
&quot;And you are right, hair and sweat do help distinguish a boy from a man.&quot; a coating of body hair spread over Mark and all the boys starting at their extremities and working its way to his belly and chest, finally it crawled up his neck and onto his face. The temperature in the room dropped a few degrees causing a few chuckles.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright Mark do you feel like a man?&quot; <br />
<br />
Mark pondered, &quot;I feel like I look like a man, does that count?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm,  it seems like something isn&#39;t hitting the right chord, can someone help me figure it out?&quot; you said, emphasizing the word chord by singing it.<br />
<br />
There were a few groans at the obvious pun.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?!?&quot; you said in mock offense. You followed up with a fake whisper, acting like this was a secret, &quot;I couldn&#39;t use the phrase &#39;hit the mark!&#39; It might confuse and scare our male volunteer!&quot; The whole class groaned and several people laughed and face-palmed including Mark. With a grand flourish you exclaimed, &quot;You are correct class! His voice should match his manly physique. Mark! Tell us what it feels like to surge with masculinity!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ummm. Oh! Do I sound like that now? Wow, this is so cool. la la la la la la la.....Oh! Right! How do I feel? I feel like I&#39;m deep under cover! Like I can pass for, I don&#39;t know, a college graduate or something.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you Mark, please stay up there a moment. Cassidy, you&#39;ve been quiet, could you chime in here? Mark said it feels like he is under cover and could pass for a college graduate. Does that conform with masculinity to you?&quot; She was already shaking her head no so you continued. &quot;What does it sound like to you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Cassidy pondered for a moment, &quot;it sounds like when a kid gets a new toy and is playing make believe... I could imagine him saying the same thing if he got a pretend diploma and kiddie spy binoculars for Christmas or something.&quot;<br />
<br />
You smiled a knowing smile. &quot;Very good Cassidy, very astute and specific. Does anyone know why the boys are all... Well,  boys in men&#39;s bodies?&quot; The girls were looking at you for the secret of male maturation, the boys were enthralled with themselves. &quot;As with height, all the traits you see are Secondary Sex Characteristics. They mean nothing without the primary changes in their genetalia. I&#39;ll demonstrate on Mark first, then Abigail, then we can all give it a go.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;First, set Mark back to a clean slate.&quot; Mark quickly shrunk back down to his late bloomer 14 yr old self. He looked as though someone just stole his puppy. &quot;And now for the full effect. Mark, this will be a little slower so you can walk us through the experience you&#39;re having.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mark began narrating, &quot;Okay, that was a growth spurt like the first time. Woah, that was new. Woah, Woah. Wooooooo....&quot; It was like he was stuck in a feedback loop as he reached the physical maturation he was at a moment ago. His mental vacation let the students hear the impact of his vocal chords changing but laughter began when he kept making the noise after he stopped changing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mark&quot; you said cautiously. &quot;Mark are you with us?&quot; he stopped making noise but continued staring off into space. &quot;Mark, are you okay?&quot; Mark inhaled sharply, apparently breathing for the first time in the last 30 seconds or so, and after several deep breaths he began to focus on the people and things around him. &quot;Mark are you okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
He focused his gaze on you, then he nodded, then he said, &quot;Yes, I am okay.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good! Would you be able to describe your experiences for the class?&quot;<br />
<br />
Mark looked around seeming to see the world for the first time. &quot;No.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No?&quot; You asked Mark surprised.<br />
<br />
Mark squirmed. &quot;I don&#39;t have the words to describe it in the same way I can&#39;t properly describe the ocean, it&#39;s breadth, it&#39;s color, it&#39;s waves, or its creatures, to someone who has only ever seen a glass of tap water. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm. Disappointing, but a fair and beautifully spoken sentiment. Perhaps you need a partner to help you find the words.&quot; With that you turned to Abigail who cowered in her chair. &quot;Females go through many of the same changes boys do but often to a lesser extent. They grow body hair, but usually only in the crotch and armpits and a little on the arms and legs. Its perfectly normal for it to show up other places as it does depend on your genetics.<br />
<br />
She began maturing, as Mark had, She squirmed and let out little gasps as her body changed. The whole room was focused on her, watching as her curves developed. Her expression showed that like Mark, though she tried to remain present with the class, much of her focus was turned inward. <br />
<br />
As soon as the process completed you asked her, &quot;Abigail, can you describe for the class what you would do to protect your family from the perspective of a woman?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I would do anything I could, but that&#39;s not the momma bear instinct, that&#39;s just me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh,&quot; you said feeling that you failed again in your experiment. &quot;But you do feel different as an adult, dont you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh Yes teacher! Very much!&quot; she explained eagerly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Describe it for us would you please?&quot; You ask eagerly.<br />
<br />
She bit her lower lip straining, &quot;Describe lemon if you&#39;ve only ever tasted carrots, Describe chocolate if you&#39;ve never tasted sweet. I want to help but there is nothing beyond what the book would tell you that I can share.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, that leaves us with only one option left class, firsthand knowledge for everyone.&quot; The males all reverted back to their original bodies and then everyone, you included.</p>
