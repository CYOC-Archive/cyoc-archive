<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Get down!” Nolan whispered, tugging on Daniel’s shoulder and pulling him behind a cubical wall. The commotion up front carried into the main floor as employees yelled at the inspecting intruders.<br />
<br />
“relax man, you basically made us invisible remember?” Daniel exclaimed before being dragged down.<br />
<br />
“yeah I know, but I haven’t been able to tell you everything yet! Those guys, I think they’re after the watch. They keep showing up wherever I use it and I’ve used it a lot her today.”<br />
<br />
“are they immune to it or something?”<br />
<br />
“I don’t know? I haven’t wanted to reveal myself incase they haven’t figured it out yet.”<br />
<br />
“Then what do we do?” he ask’d, slumping his back against the wall to better cover his large body.<br />
<br />
The noise on the floor was drawing closer, maybe three cubes away now. They didn’t have much time, but Nolan was working on a plan, it teemed on the edges of his mind, but he would need Daniel’s help.<br />
<br />
Nolan began to select options through the watch in a feverish pace. “Dan, I think I know how to buy some time. I’ll need your help though. Do you trust me?”<br />
<br />
Dan was silent for only a moment. “yeah! What do you need me to do?”<br />
<br />
Nolan let a grin slip from the corner of his mouth as he finished the commands on his watch. “we’re going to give them a show of force! I need you to go on a rampage!” with a tap of his finger he launched the change. <br />
<br />
Daniel felt a shiver roll down his spine and through out his pudgy body. The first change was like being wrapped in a lavender blanket, but this! It was raging inside him and building up quickly! “Nolan… what exactly did you do to me?...”<br />
<br />
“You remember those old Japanese movies where the giant robot has to fight the giant monster trying to destroy the city?...<br />
<br />
“yeah…”<br />
<br />
“well… your not the robot…” <br />
<br />
Daniel looked back at his hand in time to see his changes begin, the skin on the back of his palm began to darken further beyond he dark skin tone, thickening into a leathery hide that started to stretch up his arm and down his fingers. As the hide spread his arm began to thicken in other ways, replacing fat with muscle but most alarming was the sudden length of his arm. His hide skin wasn’t just stretching up his arm it was stretching his whole arm with it, his fingers too! It’d been terrifying if id didn’t feel so good! His fingers were now each a foot long, his arm becoming over three feet in length.<br />
<br />
He then felt his other hand brush the rough surface of the carpeted floor. He was shocked to see the same had happened to his other arm as the hand curled palm up. He also noticed that the pattern of the carpet seemed smaller... he looked over to Nolan with a troubled expression, as he was in fact looking down on his friend, who was grinning with glee up at him as Daniel now sitting against the cubicle could feel his shoulders pressing over its top. <br />
<br />
Daniel had barely noticed his chest swelling until one of the buttons popped off across his view. The supple brown flesh swelled upward against his chin as his tightening shirt shot it’s remaining buttons off like a cap gun. He raised one monstrous hand to his chest, cupping a second pair of growing breasts.<br />
<br />
his legs began to feel numb as he looked down his expanding chest. The shoes on his feet fell to the ground empty as his socks withered in odd shapes before a dark fleshy limb emerged from his ankle and began to peel it off. As the fabric was curled into a ball on the floor he was greeted by his misshapen foot. Each toe had stretched further, wiggling without bone and cartilage. They grew longer and thicker, splitting apart as they transformation spread up his leg to his knee, each tentacle sprawling out and curling around anything in its path, mostly out of his control. <br />
<br />
One reached out curling around the chair leg of an adjacent cubical. Its owner still seated in it. With a quick jerk the chair was yanked out from under him. He fell to the floor surprised, still unable to see the two tricksters. Nolan made a quick adjustment to that fact on his watch revealing the new Daniel to the office staff. Cries from men and woman screeched across the floor as the floor.<br />
<br />
Things accelerated from there. Growth struck his tentacle limbs as the one plaguing the dethroned coworker snaking around his body, squeezing of its own volition. Daniel watched in horror as his grip tightened uncontrollably. Until with a pop he vanished! Just gone, like he was never there. The tentacle snapped closed around empty air before recoiling back. <br />
<br />
He looked down at Nolan more confused then ever. “he’s safe at home. They’ll all be fine. Now cut lose and run wild. Your my show of strength, now do something to kill me.”<br />
<br />
Dan finally started to put the pieces together, and nodded to his friend. He rolled onto his stomach, his tentacles flopping behind him and slithering into other cubicals about the space, elating screams from his coworkers that served as a domino effect. Causing the rest of the floor’s inhabitants to turn their attention to the swelling monster at its center, causing more screams.<br />
<br />
Knowing what he had to do now he took Nolan in one of his monstrous hands lifting him into view of the suit’s not one row away from them. They quickly drew their guns from under their coats and in fear began firing at the creature. Dan lifted his other arm in defense by reflex, but the rounds never struck. Rather then question what happened he returned with a lout booming shout in their direction. A long snapping forked tongue lashing out of his mouth.<br />
<br />
Dan began to feel another sensation across his face and sides as he screamed a billowing howl. From his sides two warm shafts of flesh spilled out, tearing what remained of his shirt to bits and collided with the floor. It branched out into fingers and a joint formed in its middle, creating two new long, and misshaped arms hoisted his torso upwards. Still holding Nolan in the air with his original arms (him screaming for his life it seemed) he lifted one new limb forward, its elbow hitting the ceiling and its palm crushing the cubical and it’s screaming occupant, who vanished as soon as the brown flesh touched their head. <br />
<br />
The suit’s emptied their guns and drew another magazine from under their coats. Slamming them home and continuing their fire. They watched in fear as the monster’s head lost its hair, three rows of fish like fins sprouting in their place, its ears grew long and pointed feet, maybe yards at a time in length. A seam appeared on its forehead and swelled into an gigantic eye that consumed most of its head, the original pair pushed to below it’s sides . Its screaming maw filled with ragged teeth as its tongue split in two, then forked, then split again and forked. All the while growing larger and larger. It leaned forward and crushed a man beneath one of its massive breasts, the man vanishing beneath its brown supple flesh. <br />
<br />
Behind it they watched in horror as tentacle after tentacle filled the office floor, scooping up people and objects, crushing them into nothing and repeating the process. Their was a crash as one of the arms smashed into the floors glass walls. High winds poured into the space kicking up papers into a flutter.<br />
<br />
When they returned their attention back to the threat it was just in time to watch it hoist the flailing office worker into its mouth, its mangled teeth chewing him to nothingness. With a gulp and exhale it fixed its attention back onto the suit’s its free hand stretching towards them only to stop feet away, a close call considering it’s size.<br />
<br />
Their was a wrenching of metal and stone as the creature seemed stuck between the floor and ceiling. Its progress halted its hand flailing and grasping air as it struggled to reach them.<br />
<br />
They breathed a sigh of relief.<br />
<br />
Before they watched its fingers swell larger, its arm swell larger, its body swell larger forcing the floor and ceiling to bow around its growth. Dust and debris crumbled onto their shoulders as their feet shifted from the fissure that had formed between them. Through the crumbling office they watched at the creature smiled with its razor sharp teeth and giant gleeful eye and raked it’s long and colossal arm through the buildings corner wall and into them.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Nolan popped back into existence atop his apartment building. He’d chose this building for its view of the forest on the outskirts of town. That view was provided by the building height which when turned 180 faced the city. From the roof Nolan could see the city center, or rather would be left of it. <br />
<br />
He watched between the other buildings as the one he’d just left exploded from one of its floors. The long giant limbs of Daniel’s transformed arms reaching out its sides as the upper floors crumbled on top of his form as it continued to swell larger. As the top half fell down in heaps of smoke and dust clouds the monster’s from was reveled.<br />
<br />
It sat on the buckling building beneath it. Its one large eye peering out over the city, the two smaller eyes below it doing the same. Its four stretched arms braced surrounding buildings while its tentacled lower half dangled over the building edges, curling into broken windows of the floors below. Four titanic breasts bobbed with its breath, swelling out as it drew air in to unleash a terrifying howl! As it screamed the building erupted into booms an crashes as the creature that was Daniel road it down, falling out of view into the fallout and cityscape below.<br />
<br />
“that should keep the suits busy for the some time. Now, where was I…”</p>
