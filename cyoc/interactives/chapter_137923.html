<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As the sunr rose on Christmas, the Turner family sleepily made their way downstairs. The sounds of four 6 year olds happily cheering that Santa came had woken Lisa, Jason, Marilyn and Martin far too early. The four adults now tried to drink as much coffee as humanly possible, while the girls tore through their gifts. Thankfully things were beginning to quiet down as the four began to regain their maturity.<br />
<br />
Ann had been the first to notice her maturity returning. At first she was just as excited as the others, tearing through wrapping paper with reckless abandon. By the time she began opening her fourth present she paused, she was making a mess she would need to cleanup shortly, plus she wanted to admire the gifts she had been given. Smiling she realized she was beginning to return to normal, as fun as the week had been; a return to adulthood would be a welcome relief. One problem though needed to be addressed, her relationship with Jackie.<br />
<br />
As much as Ann enjoyed her time with Jackie (and a realization that she was developing some romantic feelings for the girl) she knew it couldn’t work, at least as things stood now. Jackie was a 14 year old girl while Ann was 43. While the idea of the two being together seemed like a natural fit, fate had other ideas. Glancing at the girl she sighed before turning to Lisa. Talking this over with her sister was going to be necessary.<br />
<br />
“Hey girls I’ll be back later,” Ann said. Gloria, Jackie and Stephanie nodded as they looked over their gifts. As she began to walk towards Lisa she felt someone pull her arm. Turning she could see Gloria giving her a look of concern.<br />
<br />
“Your going to talk with mom about Jackie huh,” she said quietly, to which Ann nodded.<br />
<br />
“That’s probably a good idea,” Gloria said stoically. “I know you can feel it, we all do. Our maturity is returning, meaning we probably will start growing up again soon. Don’t worry though, I’ll make sure Stephanie doesn’t know how old Jackie really is.”<br />
<br />
“Thanks Gloria,” Ann said warmly. “Wish me luck.”<br />
<br />
As the girl approached her sister, she began fiddling with her nightgown. It felt somewhat tight, looking herself over she could see it now rested closer to her knees than her shins. Ann was growing up once more, although she judged herself to be around 7 or 8, she knew hernadulthood would be returning soon. “Lisa,” she said solemnly. “Can...I talk to you real quick? In private?”<br />
<br />
Lisa happily nodded as she excused herself from the group. As the two made their way into the dining room they sat down. Ann frowned as she sat, her toes barely grazed the floor, while she was still too small to completely fill the chair. Feeling slightly embarrassed she looked at her sister. “Feeling okay Ann,” Lisa asked.<br />
<br />
“Yeah I’m fine,” she mumbled. “I’m starting to grow back up but it’s taking awhile. Hadn’t realized just how small I was until I sat down.”<br />
<br />
Lisa chuckled softly as the girl adjusted her nightgown. “Hey before we begin can you grab one of my out fits from upstairs,” Ann asked. “I’m afraid I’m going to tear through this while we talk,” Lisa complied rushing upstairs and returning to Ann with a pair of jeans, a T-shirt, and some underwear. Turning around she let Ann quickly change clothes before they continued.<br />
<br />
“Nice outfit,” Lisa giggled as she looked at Ann.<br />
<br />
A now 11 year old Ann frowned at her sister. She was still too small for her clothing. Ann’s T-shirt hung in her like a sack while her jeans went several inches past her feet. Even worse for the young girl was the fact she felt like she was swimming in her panties. “Don’t get used to it,” Ann frowned. “I’ll be back to normal soon. Besides I needed to talk with you about something important.”<br />
<br />
Lisa nodded as she gazed at the girl. Oddly she felt like she was talking with a kid sister. Ann only now beginning to grow back up. Her delicate features made her seem like any other kid, yet her eyes showed the emotion of an adult. Still it was proving difficult as Ann’s toes were only now touching the floor. “Okay shorty what’s on our mind?”<br />
<br />
Ann sighed as she looked at her sister. Lisa had the smug, your just a kid, look on her face. It made Ann feel a lot younger than she was, it was also kind of annoying. “Seriously,” she groaned. “Enough with the jokes I have something serious to talk with you about. So no jokes about how I look right now Okay?”<br />
<br />
“Okay Ann,” Lisa relented. “I promise no more jokes. Shame to cause I had some good ones lined up.”<br />
<br />
“Tell them to me later,” Ann grumbled. “Right now I have to tell you about a relationship I’m considering getting into, a very complicated relationship. So I need some sisterly advise.”<br />
<br />
Lisa straightened up as she looked at Ann. Her sister only spoke to her about her love life when things were very serious, meaning that the situation was indeed dire. “Okay Ann what is it?”<br />
<br />
Ann sighed, she wasn’t sure of Lisa would react to her news about Jackie. “Okay here’s the thing,” she stated. “It concerns me, Jackie and the ring.”<br />
<br />
Lisa listened intently as Ann spoke of the friendship the two had formed since their first meeting. Lisa nodded and listened while Ann told the tale about how the two had grown close over the last few months, exchanging text messages and hanging out every time Ann came to visit. Things began to become complicated recently though when Jackie revealed that she was falling in love with Ann. The two had shared a kiss and even a first kiss. Now Ann found herself torn, she wasn’t quite sure what to do. The two were in completely different worlds and places in their lives. As much as Ann wanted to give the relationship a try she couldn’t ask Jackie to give up 30 years of her life and she’s didn’t want to break her word to Lisa by becoming a teen once more. “So as you can see I’m kind of at a loss on what to do,” she sighed. “Was hoping for some advise.”<br />
<br />
Lisa was at a loss for words. She knew Ann was going through a bit of a mid life crisis and was even a bit lonely. She never suspected her sister had actually fallen for another woman, let alone one 30 years her junior. Looking at the 12 year old girl she sighed, slowly approaching her and flicking her in the head with her finger.<br />
<br />
“Ow,” Ann whined. “What was that for?”<br />
<br />
“Because you suck at relationships that’s why,” Lisa said quietly before smiling.<br />
<br />
Ann rubbed the sore spot on her forehead as Lisa pulled a chair up to her. Looking at the girl that was her sister she could only shake her head.<br />
<br />
“Ann,” she said warmly. “Look...I love you but you have always sucked when it comes to relationships. Remember the guy you brought home from college when I was 17. You know the one that tried to make a move on me before I punched him. You said he was a great guy.”<br />
<br />
“I know,” Ann groaned, Ageing into her early teens. “But this is different. I...I really do like Jackie. It’s the age difference that’s holding things up.”<br />
<br />
“I know you do,” Lisa sighed. “And to be honest I really like Jackie too. She’s very mature for her age and a great friend to Gloria. The problem is, she’s still just a kid. She’s only just beginning to learn who she is in the world.”<br />
<br />
Ann sighed and nodded, Lisa had a point. The two did care about one another but the idea of taking it to that level of intimacy was something they couldn’t do at this time. “Ugh your absolutely right,” she said as she became 16. “How are you So right about these things?”<br />
<br />
“Well right now I’m older so with age brings wisdom.”<br />
<br />
Ann frowned before bursting into a fit of laughter. “Couldn’t resist huh,” she laughed.<br />
<br />
“Nope,” Lisa giggled. “Still, I am glad you told me about this. Wish their was someway to make it work but I guess nothing can ever work out the way we want.”<br />
<br />
“Even when we have magic,” Ann whispered.<br />
<br />
The two sister sighed as they leaned into one another. Lisa could feel her sister slowly growing once more into the adult she knew and loved. As much as she wished that Ann and Jackie could have a fairytale ending, they both realized that sometimes things just can’t worl out the way you want.<br />
<br />
“Hey listen,” Lisa said. “Who knows what will happen down the line. Maybe in a few years when Jackie is older you two can try having a relationship. Let her grow up though first, experience what life has to offer. If you two really are meant to be together than it will work itself out.”<br />
<br />
“How though,” Ann exclaimed. “In what 10 years she would be 24 and I’d be 53. How is that any better?”<br />
<br />
“Um remember we have a magic ring Ann,” Lisa explained. “You becoming a teenager again is a no go but...I can deal with you being a young adult.”<br />
<br />
“Even if it means you being the oldest,” Ann smirked.<br />
<br />
“Age is nothing but a number,” Lisa smiled. “Especially in this house. Now come on, let’s join everyone else for Christmas.”<br />
<br />
Ann smiled as she looked herself over, she was pretty close to her original age once more. Although she wanted to be with Jackie, Lisa had a point. The girl needed to grow up and experience life. If the two were destined to be together things would work themselves out. For now though the two could remain friends and confidants. Hopefully for the two of them that would be enough for right now.</p>
