<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Troy watched TV, tail flicking idly. Rusty was coming over with Lenny today and he was bored. Housework was done and now he could only watch some soaps and reality TV reruns. Out of curiosity, he flicked on the news. And suddenly he was no longer bored.<br />
<br />
“The remains of almost a hundred people have been found in an abandoned shipping container in an old pasture in West Texas,” The well-coiffed woman on TV announced. “We must also report that the local Sheriff has passed away, sources say from a massive coronary. We believe the two are related as the Sheriff was found in the same area as the shipping container. Our condolences to his family. The killer remains at large, and a full multi-state manhunt, headed by the FBI, is now out for them.”<br />
<br />
“Dear God,” Troy whispered. He glanced at the Book of Beasts. “Is that what that weirdly judgemental albino guy was warning us about?”<br />
<br />
“The M.O. is the same as the victims of a serial killer that has been plaguing the area. Sources say they are likely one and the same. We may be dealing with one of the most prolific killers in history if he is not caught soon.”<br />
<br />
Troy turned off the TV and paced, shaking. They could deal with a creep with a fetish….but this? This was barbarism. He’d read, once, that serial killers…didn’t even think about their killings during the day. They just thought about normal things-holding down their job, paying the rent, where to eat for dinner. That’s why they passed unnoticed-killing was just a side hobby for them. Over a hundred people…he’d have built up quite a resistance to the exhaustion casting spells caused.<br />
<br />
He speed-dialed Rusty. He’d need permission to do what he wanted to do as he’d rather not pass out every time he tried casting a spell. If this was what was coming for them, a vulnerability like that would kill him. Literally. If he did pass out, Rusty would know he wasn&#39;t hurt or anything.<br />
<br />
“What? I&#39;m busy.” Rusty practically barked.<br />
<br />
“Serial killer. He’s the Book of Inanimate guy.” Troy spoke, “And he’s the guy coming for us.”<br />
<br />
There was a minute of silence on the other end of the line. “Rusty?”<br />
<br />
“I know. We just got the briefing on it. I think we can take him.”<br />
<br />
Troy moaned. “No, we can’t. We haven’t practiced! This guy experiments. What have we done so far? Fucked around? Literally?”<br />
<br />
Troy heard the sigh on the other end of the line.<br />
<br />
“I’ve got a plan. We’ll round up all the anthros for another party that day. It’ll keep them out of sight. Our little subdivision is tucked away in the middle of town. If he’s just passing through, he’ll miss us.”<br />
<br />
“And if he doesn’t? If someone is working late…I mean, we have to expect some failure here.”<br />
<br />
“You wanna run? Is that it?” Rusty snarled.<br />
<br />
“I wanna live. And I want a plan if some asshole shows up and tries to kill me.” Troy was put off at how abrasive Rusty was. Had something happened on shift?<br />
<br />
“Sweetheart, I’ve got guns. I guarantee that I’m faster at drawing and firing than he is at casting a spell. Look, for the rest of his victims, he jumped them and then used fucking magic. We aren’t like them, we know magic exists, it’s not going to be a surprise.”<br />
<br />
“We were warned. And he’s coming over tomorrow for our answer.”<br />
<br />
“It’s gonna be a no.”<br />
<br />
“Rusty, this is stupid.”<br />
<br />
“More stupid than trusting a man who can see the future with our lives when becoming fucking god is on the line?”<br />
<br />
Troy paused. “Yeah, he’s kinda suss. But he’s not trying to kill us.”<br />
<br />
“He’ll use us as a piece to move around the board and if he needs to sacrifice us to win, he will. Trust me, I talked it over with Lenny, he’s a bigger nerd than you. He says that’s how it goes in his animu or whatever.”<br />
<br />
“I’m scared.” Troy whispered.<br />
<br />
“Don’t be. We’re going to have a nice night, a three way, and then tomorrow we’ll tell the guy to fuck off and deal with this killer with full force.”<br />
<br />
Rusty hung up. Troy stared at the screen. Rusty could be right. RK could be lying and manipulating them. But Troy hadn’t detected any sense of animosity or trickery in the albino guy’s voice during his pitch. It was a fifty-fifty shot if they fought him, he remembered RK saying that. He was more skilled with his spells but they had people with guns. Balanced.<br />
<br />
That wasn’t good enough. Troy squared his shoulders, picked up the Book of Beasts and sauntered to the window. Outside, he could see a dog tied to a stake in the front yard of a neighbor’s house. Muffin. Pomeranian. A barky little shit that tied itself up all the time and wouldn’t stop barking when it realized the situation he’d gotten himself into. Troy studied it for a moment, then went back to his room and set an alarm clock. If he passed out, he wanted to wake up in an hour. He turned on the stereo and set it to his workout music. Time to get to work.<br />
<br />
“So, the familiar spell negates energy costs, huh?” Troy glanced at the pages of the book, open on the windowsill. “Maybe having a little surprise up my sleeve wouldn’t be bad. Costs a lot of energy, though. I can do that tomorrow. Today is training day.”<br />
<br />
Troy pointed at Muffin, who was barking his head off. “Control.”<br />
<br />
He felt the energy leave him and he sagged against the window. “Shit, that’s a rush.”<br />
<br />
When he looked back out the window, Muffin was shitting. “Oh. Um, Stop barking and carefully unwind yourself clockwise.”<br />
<br />
The dog didn’t respond. “I guess real dogs are kinda dumb, huh? Okay. Muffin, walk around the stake in a circle.”<br />
<br />
The dog did. Slowly, the tether attached to the stake unwound itself. Troy waited until Muffin could freely move around. “Good boy. Sit.”<br />
<br />
Muffin sat. <br />
<br />
Troy grinned. “Control. Remain sitting for an hour or until your owner brings you in. ”<br />
<br />
The energy siphon hit him again and Troy’s knees nearly gave out. “Damn. Okay, something easier.”<br />
<br />
Troy flipped through the book. Shape could take out lots of power, but maybe there was more to it. Like Half, where reality itself could shift if no one else heard the spell, he was sure there were hidden rules in every spell. Like control-if the animal didn’t understand the command, it wouldn’t obey it but at the same time, there was no way the dog heard him through the window across the street, so it must be telepathic. So what would happen if Troy cast shape on it and instead of trying to turn it into a lion or something, he turned it into another type of dog? Would the energy drain be the same or less?<br />
<br />
“Shape.” Troy pointed, thinking about a lion. The Muffin swelled, the tiny Pomeranian body shifting and popping, fur turning from flurry white to tawny, though the fluff remained around his head as a brown mane. The last use of control remained in effect and it remained sitting, however. Troy felt another huge wave of exhaustion strike him, sending him to the floor.<br />
<br />
He struggled, shaking, back to his feet. On the lawn was a lion, sitting on it’s haunches. People walked and drove by oblivious. <br />
<br />
“So the reality alteration works. Okay, time to go back to being a dog. Shape.” Troy pointed.<br />
<br />
The Tawny lion shrank on itself, mane falling away, revealing a Dachshund. Troy grinned for a moment before he collapsed. <br />
<br />
The alarm woke him up. Troy rose groggily from the floor and slammed a hand over the top, silencing it. He’d passed out for an hour and a half. In two hours, Rusty would be home and expecting dinner for three. Troy grimaced. This was just as important. He glanced out at the neighbor’s yard. They still weren’t home, luckily, and the dachshund had fallen asleep in the lawn. Perfect.<br />
<br />
“Shape.” Troy pointed. The dog bulked up slightly and fluffy fur spread over it. Collie.<br />
<br />
The exhaustion…wasn’t bad. He still felt it, but it was like doing anal, now that Troy thought about it. At first it’s painful and you feel like pooping, but when you fuck often enough, you desensitize yourself and all you feel is the pleasure. “Shape. Shape. Shape. Shape. Shape. Shape.”<br />
<br />
The dog twisted in its sleep, shifting from breed to breed. Alsatian. German Shepherd, Golden Retriever. Pomeranian again. Each use of the word sucked energy from him, and by the time he’d altered Muffin into a Bernese Mountain Dog, he was on his knees, hands pressed to the window for support.<br />
<br />
“Last one.” Troy panted. “Shape.”<br />
<br />
The dog twisted into a Borzoi. Troy had heard about them and their use as hunting dogs, stronger than pit bulls. Innocuous looking, no one would suspect them of being so dangerous. Troy grinned and passed out, belatedly realizing he’d forgotten to set the clock again…<br />
<br />
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________<br />
<br />
Rusty and Leonard, who now seemed to respond to Lenny, drove home. Rusty scratched an ear and tried not to think about Lenny, formerly Leonard. It was causing him a bit of a crisis and he wasn’t sure what to do about it.  Something was going horribly wrong.<br />
<br />
Lenny was much fatter than Rusty&#39;s own memories had informed him. Transforming Troy had somehow done something to Lenny as a byproduct. Now Lenny was an enormously fat, slobby bearman who smelled of musk, spoiled food and precum. He’d showered when they changed into uniforms for their shift, but the musk smell had increased gradually over the course of the day as sweat from the heat of the sun and the promise of sex had done its work. Worse still was that he would not shut up about anime and BattleAnvil and apparently Rusty played it too because he’d found an entire painted miniature army in the back of his personal vehicle. <br />
<br />
He shuddered. Even now, he was having vague memories of playing against Lenny and he’d almost gotten drawn in to a discussion about the changes in fifth edition, which he was against, for some reason, and worse, the longer he listened to the words coming out of his own mouth, the more he was convinced he was right, they’d totally nerfed High Elves into the ground. He’d checked the rear-view mirror after that conversation and found himself looking softer. A quick trip to the bathroom confirmed his worst fears. He had a less-defined body and a forming potbelly. And even worse, instead of freaking out over it like he wanted to, he didn’t half mind it. Troy loved playing with it and even encouraged him to get fatter.<br />
<br />
As his memories shifted to him gorging with Lenny at their many food stops, the potbelly rumbled and inched forward, sagging slightly over his waistband. Distracted with his distended gut, he almost missed his second chin swell into place with an audible *glorp*. Rusty gulped and tried to will his boner away. Lenny was literally rubbing off on him. He’d already gone from bodybuilder to ex-jock and now even his muscles diminished as he watched, leaving him with a dadbod. His rump was becoming bigger as well if his slowly widening waist was anything to go by. Fuck, if he didn’t change Lenny soon, he’d be as big as he was.<br />
<br />
His cell phone beeped. Rusty dug into his pocket for it. It was a struggle, as his fingers had gotten fatter and his pants tighter. There was a *pop* and he blinked. His phone was now on an easily accessible holster at his hip. Had...had that always been there? He finally answerd it. It was Troy.<br />
<br />
&quot;What? I&#39;m busy.&quot; He practically snarled.<br />
<br />
The conversation was short and tense. He&#39;d wanted to calm Troy down but right now he had bigger issues. Like the rising muffin top he was sporting. He grumbled and tried sucking in his belly but he couldn&#39;t hold it. Worse, a button popped off when he let his breath back out. It sewed itself back on, but his shirt had jumped a size. He left the bathroom and went back to work, hoping it would stop soon.<br />
<br />
Rusty wanted to end the shift early, but it was like reality was determined to shaft him. They got yet another call. It was-surprise!-another house call, the fourth today. He’d literally never been this busy. And they were dumb calls. Cats in trees, and owners so grateful they’d give them fresh pies and  cake. Rusty knew none of this was a coincidence. It really did feel like whatever had transformed Lenny had turned its sights on him. There was a...not malevolence, but...definitely a directed force bent on molding him into a fat nerd like Lenny.<br />
<br />
“God, it’s like whoever&#39;s doing this wants me to be fatass.” Rusty grumbled after being handed the third pie of the day. <br />
<br />
Apple. His favorite. His mouth filled with saliva but he shook away his hunger. He already had an inkling of how this worked. The more you gave in, the more reality shifted. Two more hours. He just had to hang on that long.<br />
<br />
“Nothing wrong with that,&quot; A voice rumbled next to him and Rusty felt a clawed paw pat his increasingly bulbous gut. It bounced. “You wear the weight well.”<br />
<br />
Rusty felt his heart flutter and let Lenny rub his belly, his dick hardening again. In response, he swore his belly grew even bigger and softer, fully sagging over his belt line. He glanced at the bear, whose loving green eyes were doing things to him now he only ever experienced with Troy. He found himself leaning up to kiss his fellow nerd and best friend-No! That might solidify things. And best friend? He’d literally met him yesterday. Memories, though, contradicted him. He’d fallen for Troy but he’d always played around with Lenny, who was still in the closet at the time, and now that Rusty was openly gay, Lenny had confessed his own feelings.<br />
<br />
His pecs softened and drooped as his memories changed, the muscle replaced with fat. He reached up with one paw and touched a moob. Floppy. That wasn&#39;t...he shouldn&#39;t have a moob...his paw fell away. Something was wrong.<br />
<br />
As if sensing Rusty’s hesitation, Lenny bent down and completed the kiss and Rusty&#39;s concerns flew away. He could feel his thoughts shifting, tried to push the bear away and instead found himself rubbing his belly instead, and then Lenny&#39;s paws moved up to fondle Rusty’s newly formed moobs, massaging his nipples as they swelled to the size of silver dollars. Rusty moaned into the kiss, shocked by the pleasure. He&#39;d never been this sensitive....nipple play was for bottoms and he was...a top?  The last of his muscles disappeared, either withering away or vanishing under the thick layer of chub that swelled across his body. <br />
<br />
His resistance fell the longer the groping went on. Why would he resist, anways? And when had Lenny gotten so unbelievably hot? Rusty shifted his jaw to better fit Lenny&#39;s muzzle and his normally well-trimmed chin fur grew down to his chest, leaving him with a tangled cream and brown beard. Rusty groped Lenny&#39;s belly and moobs in return and heard an answering moan from the bear.<br />
<br />
Lenny moved them into a nearby alley out of sight of the road and any onlookers and groped Rusty&#39;s cock through his tight uniform. Rusty&#39;s heart skipped in joy and relief. He&#39;d kept his foot long dick, at least, but there was a welling layer of fat that was swallowing it up. Lenny rubbed it, sending vibrations through his body that set him jiggling. <br />
<br />
Rusty&#39;s final thoughts before his sense of self was consumed completely and his new memories settled in was that it felt...good. In the squad car, two pies disappeared, leaving only empty tin pans covered in crumbs.  Rusty felt a surge of warm contentment and fullness and finally relaxed into a kiss that tasted like the blueberry filling from the pies they&#39;d just ate. His gut gave a final gurgle and lurch before stopping at beachball size and sagging lightly, as though it had been there for years. And it had.  <br />
<br />
Lenny broke off the kiss, leaving Rusty panting and dizzy. “Man, you’re such a good kisser. Can’t go farther than that in public, ha! Only two more hours until the end of shift. Then we can put that big dick of yours to work, big guy.” <br />
<br />
Rusty swallowed and nodded, giving himself a quick once over. Moobs and a huge belly with a wide, thick ass to boot. He gave a sigh of relief. Just like he always had. But he needed to be careful for a few more hours or he might get fatter. Which was strange to think, since that’s what his boyfriends liked? He shook it off and smiled. Lenny gave his cock a squeeze and patted his belly one last time.<br />
<br />
”So what were you saying about fifth edition?” Rusty asked as he wobbled to the car. <br />
<br />
His center of balance seemed off for some reason, though he fixed it when he thrust his belly out in front of him. Why would he walk all hunched over like he&#39;d been like he was trying to hide his kegger? He was proud of it. Took him year of binge eating with his boyfriends to get it. And he wore the weight well.<br />
<br />
Lenny chuckled, “Nothing we haven’t argued a million times over. Your army will be fine. It just won’t be fucking broken.”<br />
<br />
Rusty shook his head and switched topics to anime and how shit isekai was as they drove off to the next call, sharing the apple pie between them.<br />
<br />
_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________<br />
<br />
Troy was still asleep when Rusty and Lenny walked in.<br />
<br />
“Uh, is that normal?” Lenny rumbled, pointing a finger at the figure sprawled next to the window. <br />
<br />
Rusty shook his head, sending his double-chin wobbling. He hadn’t gotten a third chin, instead his second chin had bloated up like a frog. With the fur covering it, it just made him seem fluffier.<br />
<br />
“Nah, he’s usually ass up in our bed unconscious.” Rusty said, and casually kicked the Book of Beasts under the coffee table.<br />
<br />
Lenny chuckled. “You two. He’s kinda cute like this.”<br />
<br />
“Help me.” Rusty lifted Troy’s legs. <br />
<br />
Lenny grabbed hold of his arms and together, with lots of panting and straining, the two overweight anthros managed to hoist Troy onto his bed. Rusty briefly wondered why it took so much energy to do that. He used to lift Troy with one hand….he blinked. Had…had something changed? His house seemed normal enough but...something was missing. With a *pop*, a computer desk laden with snacks appeared next to the bed. His gamer station, of course. As he ran his hands over his headphones and gamer chair, he gave a sigh of relief. For a moment there, he’d worried someone had broken in and stolen it .<br />
<br />
“Don’t know why you’re so obsessed with being clean.” Lenny said, “Even your snacks are arranged in alphabetical order.”<br />
<br />
“It’s called controlling my environment. Plus, I’m not the one doing the cleaning.” Rusty jabbed a thumb at Troy. “Benefits of having a boyfriend.”<br />
<br />
Lenny laughed, “Yeah, well, let’s make some dinner before he wakes up.”<br />
<br />
They left, closing the door behind them. <br />
<br />
Troy turned in his sleep, his potbelly growing slightly and the cleft of his muscles slowly disappearing.<br />
<br />
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________<br />
<br />
Troy woke an hour later to the sounds of laughing and dice rolling. He sniffed. Delicious smells filled the house-Italian cooking, spaghetti with meat sauce. He drooled. All that training had made him hungry. He tried to hoist himself out of bed but found it harder to do than usual. He frowned and rolled out instead, landing on his feet with a meaty thump. He looked to the door and froze. <br />
<br />
Next to the door was a mirror. Troy ran his paws down soft pecs-almost moobs. Mooblets, a voice whispered in his head. Below that was his potbelly, though one could hardly call it that, as it now looked more like a wobbly soccer ball. He swore he could see the beginnings of a second chin forming. He might have checked his ass, but that was aways fat…although it didn’t seem as firm, now that he looked at it.<br />
<br />
What the hell had happened? Had Rusty done something? Punished him for liking a fatass like Lenny by ruining his figure? That was impossible. The Book of Body was the only Book that could alter one’s body like this. But was that true? He’d changed Clint into a hugely muscled horseman. He wasn’t that muscular as a human. Neither had Rusty been so muscular. He’d had an athletic form, but certainly not the steroid weightlifter look he now sported. <br />
<br />
Another quirk or undiscovered rule of the book, then. But that didn’t explain why he was suddenly fat. And…he squinted at his double chin, which seemed to grow as he looked at it…getting fatter. What had happened? Were they under attack by the owner of the Book of Body? Holy shit, did they have a fat fetish and just changed so many people reality itself was warping world wide!?<br />
<br />
Troy threw on clothes that shouldn’t fit his increasingly flabby form but somehow did...and were much less girly than his usual-it was purple with a cat flying across it on a rainbow-and opened the door. He wandered around the hallway until he reached the living room/kitchen bar and stopped, his jaw dropping.<br />
<br />
Lenny, who was now an incredibly obese bear (fatter than Troy had recalled from their last dalliance), was playing some nerdy wargame on the kitchen table. On the stove bubbled a huge pot of sauce and an unbelievable amount of spaghetti boiled in a huge pan. Troy didn’t recognize either of those pans-they never cooked that much food. But perhaps the worst thing was Rusty.<br />
<br />
For one thing, he was fat-not enormously so, like Lenny-but spherical would be a good description. Rotund. And strangely….kinda hot. For some reason, the phrase “carries his weight well” echoed in Troy’s mind. The Rusty he knew hated geek shit, as he called it, yet here he was, neck wobbling, fur messy and strangely beard-like around his muzzle. Troy swore he saw him actually smiling. Not grinning mischievously and evilly, like he used to. Happy and content, two things Rusty never was.<br />
<br />
As he took in the scene, Troy felt his mind physically being struck by memories. Ones that involved him and Lenny and Troy in a love triangle. Getting fatter and finding out they enjoyed it and geeks were fat, after all, weren’t they, so it wasn’t that big of a deal. Plus Troy was into that anyways, and Lenny becoming a literal bear had basically cinched the deal. <br />
<br />
His mind was nearly overwhelmed by the assault, he physically reeled as his belly grew two inches and started to sag, his double chin wobbling fully into existence and his pecs finally giving out and sagging into moobs. But that was normal, actually, they ate so much-Troy shook his head, and the weight gain slowed to a trickle. Pound a minute, he’d guess. He knew he was fatter in this reality, certainly not like Lenny or Rusty, but “pleasantly plump”. He probably had another 80 pounds to go, at a glance.<br />
<br />
Troy fought back, his mind having built quite the resistance. “No.”<br />
<br />
Rusty looked up, smile faltering. “You okay babe? We found you passed out.”<br />
<br />
Troy took in the scene one last time, blanking his mind from the odd whispers that were telling him to just let go and be himself, and gestured to the door. “We need to talk.”<br />
<br />
Rusty blinked. “I’m almost finished with my turn.”<br />
<br />
“Turns take half an hour.” Troy replied, wondering how he knew that. <br />
<br />
Of course, it was because he played BattleAnvil himself-he dimly heard a *pop* in his bedroom closet as his army appeared in a case-and now his breasts looked plumper, but he realized it was because his belly had grown again and they were resting on it. He steadied himself. Maybe fifty pounds left. Oddly, that thought didn&#39;t upset him. Infact, he was disappointed it wasn&#39;t a hundred-his belly gurgled and pushed forward a bit and he realized the end result had changed. He was even plumper and cuter now in the final image. A hundred and ten more pounds to go. He shook the thoughts away in panic. Jesus, whatever this was, it was fast and listened. <br />
<br />
“Now.” He put some power in the growl. It sounded more like a grumble. <br />
<br />
Because he didn’t get angry with Rusty in this reality-Troy shook the thoughts away, aware of how this worked now. The memories and changes were happening hand in hand. No thinking. No matter how hot-he shook his head again. Really slippery bastards, those memories. Almost got him again. He was aware that he was softening even as he stood there, a pound at a time.<br />
<br />
“Okay, okay, holy moly!” Rusty adjusted glasses he’d never needed earlier. “Let me take a picture of the board state.”<br />
<br />
Troy nodded and asked. “The Book?”<br />
<br />
“It…um, hold on.” Rusty blinked and thought hard, running his fingers through his beard. He snapped a quick picture and pointed under the coffee table. “Almost forgot.”<br />
<br />
“You almost forgot about that? You understand why that’s a huge problem don’t you?” Troy replied, slowly, hoping to jog Rusty’s memories.<br />
<br />
Rusty blinked, “Yeah. Kinda. Did something….”<br />
<br />
“Yes. We need to use it now. I think it’s a reality cascade. We need to fix it fast before things go permanently pear-shaped.” Troy giggled at his own pun and stopped himself. <br />
<br />
His chin tickled for a moment and when he scratched his chin and found fur there. A big tuft, which he was sure was quite cute, found himself stroking it absently and wondered if he always did this when he was nervous. He let the thought go as soon as it came. Reality was changing and if he dared dwell on it for a second he’d be whisked away in memories and end up like them. Happy and overweight nerds. <br />
<br />
That was bad…right? He frowned and rubbed a growing nipple and managed to pull away as it enlarged. Shit. It was fucking with him more subtly. Whatever this was, it had hit them both and had hit him harder…because…because obliviously it had gained momentum. Each piece of reality would cement itself, stabilize itself. He was the last domino and had the force of two other reality shifts bearing down on him.<br />
<br />
Troy grunted and had to carefully get down on all fours to get the Book out. Lenny wolf whistled and Troy blushed. Everyone loved his ass, at least that hadn’t changed. He grabbed it, hoping for the Book to offer it’s protection…but nothing happened. No nosebleeds.<br />
<br />
“Holy shit, this is really bad.” Troy whispered. <br />
<br />
Rusty walked over to him, his pawfalls heavy. Troy took him by the arm and left the house, keeping near the window.<br />
<br />
“What’s up?” Rusty asked as Troy shut the door. <br />
<br />
“You aren’t fat, you’re fit and muscular, not nerdy. I’m holding the book.” Troy added the last one as more of a bluff. Apparently, this was reality now, so obviously the book wouldn’t be able to affect it.<br />
<br />
Rusty scrunched his brow cutely, “How?”<br />
<br />
“Lenny got caught in the reality bubble we created. He’s fat and nerdy...but more so than he used to be. Reality had to correct itself, make it make sense. It hit you next, because a fit guy and a fat cop don’t make sense. And now it’s hitting me.”<br />
<br />
“But you’ve always been-”<br />
<br />
“Stop! Not another word. Reality shift. Of course you think that.”<br />
<br />
Rusty grabbed the book. And blinked. “No nosebleed?”<br />
<br />
“Right. That’s the other part. This is simply reality shifting to reassert itself. You’ve already given me the speech about choosing which reality we believe in, right? Someone is tipping the scales. I thought it was the Book of Body attacking us, but it’s clearly just…”<br />
<br />
“Natural force. Also, holding the book did do something. I see the real you. I can compare it to my old memories. Sorry to say, but you’re, like, Fifty pounds fatter than this.”<br />
<br />
“Nope, stop, reality will force memories in.” Troy held up a hand, though he felt his belly push forward another inch and wobble before sagging slightly. “No talking about that.”<br />
<br />
Rusty eyed the belly as it wobbled. “Do we.. need to stop it?”<br />
<br />
“Are you a cop?”<br />
<br />
Rusty nodded absently, still staring at Troy’s belly, which Troy realized was rising as they spoke. Like lovely soft dough-he shook the thought away. He swore he felt something caressing him, soothing him, telling him he could just be happy. His cock was hard, nestled in the warmth of his growing fat pad, yet he felt something twining around it. He breathed out, his stomach swelling-and then shut out the thoughts. Forty more pounds and he&#39;d be stuck.<br />
<br />
Let&#39;s go with fifty, the voice seemed to whisper. Rusty&#39;s hand wandered towards his belly.<br />
<br />
“What were your calls like today?” Troy batted Rusty’s hand away. “Rusty? Wake up.”<br />
<br />
“Uh, yeah, house calls, but it was mostly cats in trees. We got pies and cake though. Oh! I should bring those in-” Rusty bustled off to the squad car. <br />
<br />
His ass swayed left and right, mesmerizing. Drool started to form on the side of Troy’s growing jowls. Ass and cake, the perfect meal. He blinked and shook himself. That fucking dog would destroy them. He closed his eyes, concentrating on his breathing and nothing else, not even the softly rising chub or the creak of his shorts as the grew and resized, waited for the cakes to be put away. <br />
<br />
Rusty came back outside, wiping off his hands. Troy glanced down at himself. Fifty more pounds and he&#39;d be done. Hold on, was that right? He&#39;d thought he&#39;d said fifty last time. It was nice and warm and soft, fifty wouldn&#39;t be so bad...Troy barely managed to snap out of it. He had a mission. And that voice wasn&#39;t his.<br />
<br />
“Are you a good shot?” Troy asked.<br />
<br />
“A good shot? Nah, I don’t do that on my patrols.” Rusty shrugged. <br />
<br />
“Which means that you also won’t be capable of stopping the LITERAL SERIAL KILLER COMING TO MURDER US.”   Troy bellowed.<br />
<br />
“Uh, maybe we should take that RK guy up on his offer?” Rusty replied, oddly meek.<br />
<br />
“Really? Being fat made you smarter. Okay. Well, I actually don’t want to be fat, I just enjoy having a variety. So I’m going to save you. Get in there.” Troy pointed at the door, trying not to notice the wobble of his arm.<br />
<br />
Rusty licked his jowls. “I-I’m afraid. Of losing myself.”<br />
<br />
“You’ve already done that to me. On purpose. If we let this go, I’LL lose myself, Rusty.”<br />
<br />
“Shit.”<br />
<br />
Troy sighed. “What do you want to keep?”<br />
<br />
“My hobbies? It’s better than just non-stop sex. Although the sex is good too. And I have a best friend I never had before.”<br />
<br />
“Right. And when you’re done changing, you get out here and you change me. And we really don’t have much time. Capiche?”<br />
<br />
Rusty nodded, still eyeing up Troy. “You’re still really hot, you know.”<br />
<br />
“I’m hot in general. And so are you. But this is a matter of survival, which you just don’t seem to be getting. Get in there.” Troy pointed at the door.<br />
<br />
Rusty slunk away and rejoined Lenny at the table. Troy heard them talk and then laugh and start rolling dice again. He sighed. Speaking of rolling the dice, it was time to pray.<br />
<br />
Troy pointed at Lenny through the window. He kept his voice low and tried to ignore how handsome Lenny’s eyes were. “You first big guy. Rusty would’ve gone for a power lifter build for you if he’d had his say, so that’s what we’re going with. Shape.&quot;</p>
