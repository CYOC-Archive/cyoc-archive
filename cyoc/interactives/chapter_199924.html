<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The Maiden Mary wakes up early before the sun can rise over the mountain. She rushes to dress herself and try to make herself neat for the Hunter today, but finds she already is perfectly made up thanks to the Wizard&#39;s amulet. She then grabs the Wizard&#39;s enchanted items, wraps them in her thick winter cloak, and races outside to find Peter, her preferred champion in the tournament.<br />
<br />
She runs out of her cottage door and sprints down the mountain to the village of Buttundoa. She finds this new body of hers has the basic athleticism to make this run while she definitely would have fallen over or grown weak of breath before she reached the valley. Her sturdy and strong legs hold balance as she traverses down the cobblestone path. But with the cool morning air whipping her golden tresses behind her, she feels invigorated to find her hunter love. She races to the circle of hunters&#39; carts and wagons behind the tavern and looks for his cart. She quietly sneaks past the many sleeping men and finds Peter&#39;s humble cart with his horse tied up to a post nearby.<br />
<br />
Silently, Mary walks up to the head of the cart, and pats the sleeping horse on his neck as he lightly grazes. The horse sees her approach and does not cause a stir as he recognizes her from before and allows her to approach his master. Mary then goes over to the back of the cart to where her Hunter is sleeping. She knocks lightly on the rear of the wooden cart and calls out to him. &quot;Peter? It&#39;s Mary. Are you awake?&quot;<br />
He stirs awake and reaches for a small shortsword in defense. But once his vision focuses and he sees Mary before him, he lets go of the blade and quickly rises to his knees to look at her beautiful face up close. &quot;Maiden Mary? What are you doing here? What if someone saw you sneaking away to a hunter&#39;s camp?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry, Peter. No one saw me. Besides I have gifts for you. Follow me.&quot; Mary hops down from the cart and begins to walk towards the treeline to the edge of town. Peter quickly stumbles over himself and nearly falls out of his cart to run after her. Mary smiles at his bumbling charm and leads him away from sight of the village to show him his boon. She holds out the large wrapped bundle to him to begin revealing each piece. His eyes go wide as he sees the craftsmanship obvious with each gift and imagines them to be quite priceless. &quot;How did you come across such blessed items? This is the most beautiful bow I have ever seen.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I asked the Wizard to make them for you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, he did? Why would he do that? I&#39;m his competition in the tournament.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mary smiles sweetly. &quot;Because I asked him to. I can be very convincing and essentially told him he needed a true competitor and how could he possibly be undone by his own creations.&quot;<br />
<br />
Peter still looks unsure. &quot;Exactly. How? And I don&#39;t even know if I have the strength to pull back the string on this bow.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mary holds out the belt specifically. &quot;This belt is the key to the set. With it, you should be imbued with great power yourself. Try it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Peter takes her word for it, trusting the gorgeous woman implicitly, and takes the large leather belt. Holding it up to himself, it seems to be perfectly sized to his slim build. But when he fastens it closed, the magic takes hold. The studs in the leather flash gold and Peter quickly becomes imbued with its power. He stretches upwards and out as his frame grows taller and his shoulders widen. His jaw hardens as his face becomes much more masculine and strong with a unique sparkle in his eye. The trim & lithe muscles from his years of hunting grow heavy and bulbous as he gains pounds and pounds of raw strength. His chest & biceps become as round as boulders and his neck & back become as meaty as a large jungle cat. Through his shredded clothing, his stomach hardens and develops hard and defined abdominals with his waist remaining the same size to keep the belt locked onto his body. But then just below the belt, the hunter&#39;s hips become upgraded to connect powerful thighs to his rippled torso in the form of a tight, thick ass and quite hefty package. His legs are incredibly stacked but Mary&#39;s eyes linger on his well equipped hips. For some reason, the Wizard&#39;s gifts have some lingering effects that resembles the magic placed on her amulet. Maybe he was distracted slightly by her while he was crafting the belt or his magic was vague enough to make him incredibly attractive.<br />
<br />
At the end of his transformation, he is a heaving angel made of solid flesh colored marble. He brushes his hair out of his face to try to see what about him has changed. He grasps the bow in one hand and slides the quiver over his shoulder, feeling the magic thrumming within the wood and leather. &quot;Mary? How does it look?&quot;<br />
<br />
Her eyes are locked onto his muscles and is beginning to feel a stirring in her loins. &quot;You are beautiful.&quot; She walks up to the Hunter and places her hands on his wide meaty chest. His flesh is so warm and covered in hair: he is radiating masculine energy and she is growing drunk on it. &quot;Brave hunter, surely you now stand a chance against the Wizard.&quot;<br />
<br />
Up until this moment, she was not entirely sure who exactly she wanted to win the tournament. The Wizard could indeed grant her many boons in a life together. But this mountain of a man is currently swaying her to his end by merely standing here.<br />
<br />
The Hunter Peter is completely amazed by the new strength burning through his veins. &quot;I will never take this belt off.  Thank you, Milady.&quot; He bows his head to her in deference as he takes her hand off of his chest and kisses it. Mary goes weak in the knees.</p>
