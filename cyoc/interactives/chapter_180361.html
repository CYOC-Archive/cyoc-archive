<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The sun was falling as the day crowd left the pool area and the night party crowd began to move into focus for the staff of Encore Beach Club. The bikini-clad waitresses that dotted the bars, dining areas, and pool areas who had mustered the flow diligently throughout the day now found themselves also being let out as their shifts ended and the day crew dispersed to go home. One of the first of the scantily clad waitresses to sigh a breath of relief at the end of the day as she moved towards the card-puncher was one of their newer waitresses who had just been hired a week ago but already had the knack for the eye-candy serving nature of a veteran tease. Penelope walked normally but with an added grace to her sexy steps as the thought of the day being over and her nightmare being finished had become a reality.<br />
<br />
At no other time in my life (the time when you were actually a man) had I felt so violated and used as this day working for the club. After being forced away from your genie by your coworker who you later discovered was named Claire, you didn’t even have time to take in the situation and adjust to your new reality before you were forced into a bar-tending role at the bar with never-ending men visually violating you every second. Not once ever for a second did I enjoy my time behind the bar in fact I was forced to split my focus between mixing and serving drinks to increasingly drunk and lecherous men ogling me to fretting and panicking to the sight every time I looked down that I was in fact a girl and that I was wearing a dreaded bikini for the sole intention of attracting the male gaze. My understanding assured me that this identity Penelope Alatrosa was a well-liked addition to the day crew who liked her bubbly-style with the quests and friendly attitude to the rest of the staff especially Claire Abe who had gotten Penelope the job here at Encore and whom as roommates and best friends since high school were well-suited to work together. I must admit that the day wasn’t all bad as the friendly attitude of my fellow waitresses and the team spirit among all of us made Encore a more exciting and happier place to work then my old job as a man at least when we weren’t being flooded with orders and male eyes.<br />
<br />
Still I couldn’t stand being forced to wear this red bikini that seemed to intentionally either be a size too small as to tightly hug my body and display even fuller my ‘assets’ or it was intentionally designed that way for the same purpose. I’m thinking the latter scenario is what was going on. This before mentioned understanding of my plight and attire made me aware immediately why the staff was dressed like this was purely to make the company as much money as possible by playing human sexuality and especially the debilitating effects on the male mind to the possibilities of scantily-clad females surrounding and showing interest in them. I would probably be in the same boat as all these men loosening my wallet open to hand enormous tips and payments to a smiling beauty with nearly nothing on if I was my original self and not in the form of their desires. The stress of it all was becoming too much and I just couldn’t stand all the men at the booth or beside the pool who tried to strike up conversations with me or grab my arms and hands as I handed them their drinks.<br />
<br />
The breaking point came when a guest in a private hut on the other side of the pool asked for me specifically to deliver a drink to him. I got this message from one of the wait staff and I originally wanted to refuse but thinking that if I’m fired and my genie is still on the casino grounds I may never find her again and then be stuck as an unemployed girl. I made the drink and with a deep breath walked across the pool zone I was stationed in. The amount of lecherous cat-calls and attempted booty grabs I had to deal with as I navigated through an ocean of horny men I don’t want to touch upon or ever remember ever again. I got to the private beach hut as described and walked through the white sheets at the entrance to reveal two heavily muscled young men in swim trunks and two women one brunette and the other blonde in bikinis by the side and who all were laying in beach lounge chairs expect for the man and woman to the right who laid together in the same chair.<br />
<br />
Looking to the man on the left I immediately recognized him as one of the men from the bar earlier who was giving me more attention and stares then any other and didn’t appear to be drunk and that was saying something. Immediately I knew that this was my target of the drink order. I put on a big smile and walked over to this man increasingly eyeballing me with a sly smile. “Hey babe thanks, What’s your name?” the man cooed as I handed him the drink. Needing to keep this job until at least I found my genie again I played along “Penelope” I gingerly answered with a fake spring to my voice. The admission of my name brought an even bigger smile to his lips “Penelope huh, my names Colin and this is Tom and Alyssa” he said pointing to the couple to the side of him you said hello and waved “and this is Ashley” he said pointing to the blonde who waved but said nothing as she slightly stared and smiled at me. At that time I also recognized Ashley as she was at the bar earlier with the man but she actually treated me with respect and friendliness as I did my job. Not liking how this was turning out with the man I said with an air of urgency “Pleasure to meet you all can I get any of you anything else as I have to get back to work?” The man’s eyebrows shot up with this admission and he gently grabbed my right hand in his “Why don’t you just sit and talk with us for awhile? Surely you can spare a few minutes with paying customers?”</p>
