<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Maaya and Rexie finished dinner and were about to leave, Lilith pulled them both to the side, a stern look on her face.<br />
<br />
“I see you two have altered the forms I gave you,” she said quietly.<br />
<br />
“Well we thought,” Rexie started. “That’s the problem,” Lilith growled. “You thought. You are not here to think, you are here to assist my son.”<br />
<br />
Maaya and Rexie paled as lilith gave them a critical look. “Do you think me so stupid that I have not thought ahead or know of the plans you discussed with my son.”<br />
<br />
“We just thought that...” Maaya stammered.<br />
<br />
“Once again you say that word,” Lilith exclaimed. “Thought is the last thing you two should be doing. I bestowed those forms on you for a reason. You worry so much about things you can not comprehend that you think you know better than I. Remain in the forms I have given or I will take your gifts. Cross me and you will discover their are fates worse than death.”<br />
<br />
“But my job,” Rexie whispered.<br />
<br />
“It’s gone,” Lilith exclaimed. “I have already given that menial task to someone else. Do you truely think I would alter your form and not have a contingency plan for your former existence. DO NOT presume to know what my plans are. Follow mine and my sons lead or I swear you two shall suffer.”<br />
<br />
Maaya and Rexie nodded, transforming once more into the forms Lilith had given them before quickly returning to their homes. “Think you might have been a bit harsh mom,” Jack chuckled as he watched his friends quickly flee. “They needed to be put in their place,” Lilith smirked. “They are But pawns in this game. You, my son are the key. I can not have your “friends” thinking their opinions matter. They are to follow and assist. No more, no less. I’m not Merlin. Our word is law, there is no room for debate or other ideas.” Jack nodded as he now looked out towards the street. “So what now then,” he asked. <br />
<br />
“Now,” Lilith said slowly. “You find some more allies.”<br />
<br />
**********************<br />
<br />
Sebastian sat in study hall as he glumly looked out the window. Ever since Mary Elise began hanging out with that girl Kellie, he had found the girl seemed to have less and less time for him. While he wanted to be with the girl, he realized his love was unrequited. Mary Elise was in love Jason Turner. While he did love the girl (and even considered them to be boyfriend and girlfriend) Mary saw him as more of a brother than a boyfriend.<br />
<br />
“Hey geek,” a voice shouted. Sebastian turned quickly, placing his hands up as a rather large boy now shoved Sebastian to the ground. “Ha What a tool,” the large boy laughed as Sebastian brushed himself off. “Bite me,” Sebastian grumbled as he glared  angrily at the larger boy.<br />
<br />
“Oh look at you,” the boy smirked. “What are you going to do? I don’t see that crazy bitch your always hanging around with. Guess Misery dumped your ass loser.” Sebastian grit his teeth before delivering a swift kick to the boys groin. Sebastian watched as the boys eyes bulged as he doubled over. “Your dead,” he growled as he lunged towards Sebastian. <br />
<br />
Sebastian dodged the boys attack, backing off as he inched towards the door. He knew that the boy would most likely beat the crap out of him and would get away with it. He needed to get away. As he exited the hall he ran head long into Jack. The two teens fell in a heap as they now tried to stand. “Sorry,” Sebastian said quickly. Jack narrowed his eyes before noticing a large teen rush out of the classroom. As he stood the teen shoved Jack to the floor, knocking the wind out of him. “Out of the way freak,” the boy growled at Jack. Before Jack could respond, he noticed Sebastian swing his book bag at the boys head, knocking him to the ground. Jack gazed in confusion as he saw Sebastian stare at the dazed teen, “Cmon we gotta go,” he exclaimed as he helped Jack to his feet.<br />
<br />
As the two teens fled down the hall into an empty classroom they now caught their breath as they anxiously peered out into the hall. “Who the hell was that,” Jack stated, slightly confused. “Just some dumb jock,” Sebastian grumbled. “The kind of asshole who gets his jollies off by beating on people who are weaker than him.”<br />
<br />
Jack nodded as he looked the teen boy over. Sebastian had a sullen look to him. The teens dark hair hung down over his eyes while his grey eyes had fierceness to them. What surprised Jack the most was the dark energy that seemed to emanate from the teen, Sebastian, like himself, seemed to be attuned to the dark Magic’s that he practiced. A smirk now spread over Jacks face as he now thought about his mission, having another Warlock in the mix would only strengthen his army.<br />
<br />
“So what’s your name,” Jack asked.<br />
<br />
“Sebastian. Sebastian Kane.”<br />
<br />
“Jack Martin,” he said extending his hand. “You look familiar? Have I seen you before?”<br />
<br />
“I don’t think so,” Sebastian answered. “Maybe you saw me hanging out with Mary Elise.”<br />
<br />
“Perfect,” Jack thought. “Someone who has a connection to Kellie.” <br />
<br />
“Oh yeah,” Jack said in faux surprise. “The red head that hangs out with Kellie Pendragon. She your girlfriend?”<br />
<br />
“I wish,” Sebastian grumbled. “Lately she’s been hanging out with Kellie all the time. Not exactly thrilled about it. She’s kinda been blowing  me off.”<br />
<br />
“Girls,” Jack sighed. Sebastian smirked and nodded as he looked at Jack. “Yeah,” he said.<br />
<br />
“So you doing anything now,” Jack asked. “Beside running from a dumbass.”<br />
<br />
Sebastian gave a short laugh before shaking his head. “Not really,” he grinned. “Have a lot of free time once I ditch this guy.” Jack nodded as he extended his hand. “Well was heading out to the quad to hang out wi5 a couple of friends. Want to join me?” Sebastian pondered what Jack said before shaking his head. “Sure why not,” he said. Jack smiled as the two teens now left to meet Rexie and Maaya. It appeared he was about to add a warlock to his group.</p>
