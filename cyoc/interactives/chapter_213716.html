<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Nearby in the backyard, Jake’s younger brother was laying in the grass. Jordan was enjoying the lovely afternoon and was deep in his latest chapter book, much preferring reading outdoors in the sun to playing video games like his other 12-year-old peers. Since moving out to the countryside with his family, he discovered that occasionally wildlife would wander up while he was deeply entranced by his afternoon reading, often without him noticing. One time, a deer had even taken sanctuary in the shade, almost close enough for him to pet, but he knew better than to move and startle his forest companions away. Jordan was about to turn the page when he heard a very sudden squealing noise nearby, causing any other animals nearby to freeze and go silent for a few moments. It was then that Jordan lifted his head and was nearly nose to nose with a cottontail, frozen in fear. The creature’s dark chestnut eyes were wide with terror, and the rabbit was completely motionless save for its rapid, shallow breathing. It’s whiskers tickled Jordan’s face. For several moments, they stayed like that, but the boy was fighting off a sneeze, his eyes watery and rosy cheeks inflating until he could hold it no longer. The sudden noise caused the rabbit to erupt several feet into the air, landing exactly where it started. This caused Jordan to laugh loudly at the poor rabbit’s plight. Shockingly, the animal didn’t leave as the wildlife often dies after being noticed by the scrawny pre-teen. Instead, it seemed oddly enraptured by the boy. It’s large ears rested on its back, and it’s nose twitched in Jordan’s direction. The boy was brought back to attention after feeling a sharp and sudden sting in his shoulder. “OUCH!” He exclaimed, wincing slightly and rubbing his shoulder. His new companion lapped at his arm that lay in the grass, propping him up. “Woah, that’s never happened before. You’re not very wild, are you?” The boy spoke, basking in the animal’s affection. It’s tongue was so… hot. And it’s plush little muzzle was so extremely soft, more so than anything he’s felt before. He reached a hand to caress the rabbit, stroking the slick reddish-brown fur along its back. The rabbit stopped licking his arm, lowering its head submissively to receive his attention.   He lowered his hand to stroke the rabbit’s nose gently, now gazing deeply into the calmed animal’s eyes. This was so odd compared to his previous interactions with the local wildlife. Something was so different about this rabbit that completely entranced him. Everything was starting to feel… fuzzy. And hot… and so so ITCHY! He couldn’t take it any more, and figured nobody was around, so he threw off his shirt. Jordan got down on his elbows to get to the rabbit’s eye level, resting his chin on his crossed arms with his legs folded beneath him. The rabbit reciprocated his submissive gesture, and started lapping at his face, the gentle whiskers teasing his cheeks again. Jordan closed his eyes and let his mind drift as the wild creature groomed his face, it’s hot tongue starting to feel larger and larger. After what felt like an eternity, the rabbit stopped, and the boy opened his eyes to see his new friend was nearly the size of his huge hound dog! Attempting to sit up, he realized his arms were now covered with brown hair, and claws were forming on his fingers. Before being able to inspect himself further, a sweet, musky smell grasped his mind. Jordan turned to see the rabbit now hopping around to his rear and sniffing his butt. Something in him made him freeze, now paralyzed with this new feeling. He felt a warmth radiating from his rear, and failed to realize his pants lay in the grass at his now much larger lagomorph feet.  His heart thumped rapidly in his chest as he felt the rabbit’s soft muzzle press into him, sniffing deeply. Before he could realize what was going on, his new companion’s weight rested atop his back, fuzzy arms grasping his sides as the rabbit shimmied closer to embrace him. Jordan exhaled sharply, never having felt quite like this before. Something hot and wet prodded sharply at his rear, as if searching for something. This continued for a moment, until the boy gasped, jaw dropping suddenly, when the rabbit plunged into an opening that should not have been there. The small pointed prick of the buck rabbit rocketed away at the former boy’s new cunt. A primal need burned within Jordan’s body, telling him to relax, and causing new muscles to contract and relax methodically around this new length pumping inside him. The rabbit suddenly felt so much bigger than him, and he felt it pull his hips closer, causing the length to plunge to new depths inside him. The fast rocking of his partner lulled him into a trance, and he discovered a new pleasure when he extended his new appendages to push up into his mate. The slick fur of the rabbit’s undercarriage teased around his ass,, which was now growing wet from their love-making. It started to feel as if two hot water balloons were expanding between the rabbit and him. The two started to reach a crescendo, and he felt a pulsing inside him as the buck began to shoot a hot liquid inside him. A growing warmth exploded in his abdomen as he experienced his first female orgasm as a rabbit. He felt his… no… her… body cooling as her mate ceased thrusting. Jordan never liked boys, and a part inside her screamed with terror as she came to the realization of what had just unfolded. She felt revolted as she could still feel the rabbit’s penis twitching inside him, expelling it’s last few spurts of seed and ensuring a pregnancy in his newly minted mate. Jordan stumbled ahead a few paces as soon as she felt the make withdraw from her cunt, still unable to coordinate herself in her new form and tripping over the now giant book she had been reading.</p>
