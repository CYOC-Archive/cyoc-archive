<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">     The Maid kind of just appeared out of nowhere. No one knew who she was, where she came from, or even what she looks like. She dressed like a simple caretaker in a hospital, wearing generic teal-colored doctor&#39;s scrubs. She just appeared in front of a door belonging to a very, very large house that belonged to a multimillionaire family that consisted of a husband, a wife, and their 19 year old daughter Brooklyn. She was a fairly intelligent kid, getting straight A&#39;s through out her school life, but was a bit of an antisocial and not having too many friends. Luckily, she just finished her last year of school and was able to have a whole year by herself, especially since her parents left for a 2 year business trip. Although she wished to be left alone, her parents hired a someone to watch over her just in case.<br />
<br />
     The maid knocked on door where it soon opened. She was greeted with a young woman with bright red hair, which was surprisingly natural, wearing a white t-shirt and a red sweatpants. Her body was thin and had ample breasts, matching her pale face with dimples and green eyes.<br />
     &quot;Oh you must be that maid or something that my parents hired! Here, come inside,&quot; she said nicely helping her with her bags. The maid was a bit plump, with sagging boobs, a bit of a potbelly, some thick legs, and a chubby face. Her hair was tied in a bun and her skin was a bit wrinkled. &quot;I wonder how much she weighs,&quot; the daughter thought.<br />
     &quot;Well aren&#39;t you a nice one. I expected some sort of spoiled brat to come with this luxurious house,&quot; the maid jokingly responded bringing in the last of her stuff.<br />
     &quot;No, I&#39;m not that kind of person. Parents raised me well guess heh,&quot; she said back.<br />
     &quot;Good thing too. Hey it&#39;s almost dinner time. You just do whatever you want to do upstairs while I make something for you to eat ok?&quot; the maid said.<br />
     &quot;Sounds good to me. Oh yeah, I almost forgot, my name is Brooklyn, but you can call me Brooke for short. What&#39;s your name,&quot; Brooke asked halfway up the stairs.<br />
     &quot;Just call me Jean,&quot; Jean said smiling.<br />
     &quot;Alright then, see you soon Jean.&quot;<br />
     &quot;You too sweety.&quot;<br />
     Brooke sat in her bed just surfing the internet, sipping a can of Fanta. Normally, she would come down about 20 minutes after her parents started to eat thanks to her &quot;slight&quot; addiction to the internet. But today was different. While on the other days the food smelled pretty good, that evening&#39;s scent was absolutely divine, and Brooke noticed. She instantly shut off her laptop and walked downstairs almost wetting herself from the godly smell. As soon as she turned the corner leading to her massive dining room, she saw plates upon plates of food. Almost every inch of the table was covered in delicious food, such as pizza, whole roasted birds, burritos, hero sandwiches, and potato salad, her absolute favorite food. At that point, she really wet herself.<br />
     After running up for a quick change, Brooke came back down and exclaimed,&quot;Holy shit! You made all of this? It smells amazing!&quot;<br />
     Jean came out of the kitchen with two more plates of cheese-stuffed sausages and a stack of pizzas and responded,&quot;Well I did order a few pizzas and burgers but I made about... 97% or 98% of the stuff on the table. Well what are you waiting for? Dig in!&quot;<br />
     Brooke was still in absolute shock of the amount of food on the table. She shook it out of her system and grabbed two plates. She scanned the table as if it was a buffet meant for a 1000 people. She took a plate of potato salad, 5 types of pizzas slices that were as big as her head, a few chicken drumsticks, and the sausage that Jean just made. She stacked a couple of the bowls on top of each other so she could have more room to eat. She bit into a meat lovers pizza and wet herself once again but didn&#39;t bother to change as she was in bliss at that point. The cheese was warm and gooey, the sauce was full of herbs and spices, the meat was greasy and full of juices, and the dough had the perfect consistency. The crust was huge, as it was filled with cheese and meat. She tried the giant sausage and had cheese splatter all over her face. She merely wiped it away, but couldn&#39;t catch the globs of juice the sausage was releasing. At this point her panties were nearly soaked with her piss. Each bite caused her to shudder and lose control of bowels for a second and every now and then farted with delight. She continued to eat her sausage, but decided to add some turkey with it. As you have guessed already, it was heavenly. It was tender, fell right off the bone, and didn&#39;t even have any annoying bits of tendon or hard bits, leaving only the main bone as the only inedible part of a chicken.<br />
     &quot;She&#39;s either a magician, or *burp* she&#39;s one hell of a chef,&quot; mumbled Brooke as she was cleaning off her 4th and final drumstick. She stacked the rest of her pizzas, squished them down and bit into them, with not too much success though. Cheese, grease, and tomato sauce dripped all over her shirt. She took the shirt and wiped her mouth and hands on it as she didn&#39;t have any napkins. Brooke lifted her ass to let out a loud and stinky fart that lasted around 10 seconds and said,&quot;Damn, that was one hell of a far- Oh god, the smell is horrendous!&quot; As she waved away the flatulence, Jean came out with a large pan of 7 cheese lasagna.<br />
     &quot;So how&#39;s the meal Brooke? Are you enjoying yourself so far?&quot; she asked Brooke who was currently take knife and spatula to lift out a large, gooey piece of lasagna.<br />
     &quot;This is *fart* seriously the best *long burp* meal I&#39;ve had in my life *fart*,&quot; Brooke responded blushing a bit at the amount of gas she just released. Luckily Jean didn&#39;t seem to notice nor care about it.<br />
     &quot;I&#39;m glad to hear that! I&#39;ll be back in the kitchen if you ever need,&quot; said Jean as she walked back into the kitchen with her ass swinging side to side. &quot;Probably making even more food,&quot; Brooke that as she started to eat her square foot lasagna. After finishing her lasagna, she gave an uncomfortable moaned as she looked down at her stomach. She noticed that it had grown out by 3 inches before dinner and gave it a small poke. She felt the hardness and slight feeling of pain from it. If she ate anymore, she would probably burst, but she already had a giant plate of potato salad sitting on her plate. The hardest part was that it was her favorite food and she felt like she couldn&#39;t eat it. But eventually, she adjusted her pants, picked up her fork, and started to dig into the 5 pound plate of creaminess. She orgasmed at the first bite and could feel more liquid come down her pants. As soon as she took the first bite, everything started to go downhill. Each giant bite she took lost its flavor more and more until all it tasted like was a slimy, starchy unidentifiable substance. But the last bite was at her fork. Her hand quivered more and more as it got closer to her mouth. Her head reached for it and her jaws closed down on it. Her jaw slowly crushed up the potato and swallowed it. Brooke was done, she finally finished it.<br />
     &quot;Ngghh, *hiccup* I... *loud wet fart* *burp* finished it... *groans in pain*,&quot; she tried to say as she rubbed her stomach to try to soothe before her stomach could burst. &quot;I *burp* don&#39;t think... I could... *groans* ever eat another *louder, stinkier fart* bite... ever again *burp* *hiccup*.&quot; Brooke poked her stomach one more and found it go deeper this time. Her stomach finally grew another 2 inches, making it look like she was pregnant.<br />
     Jean happily walked out with a chocolate pie as big as one of her ass cheeks to see Brooke laying back, with her giant stomach out, an almost see through shirt with multicolored stains, and a fairly wet pair of sweatpants. She also noticed a rancid smell come from the same area.<br />
     Brooke looked up from her position and waved at her while weakly saying hello before belching loudly after that. Jean put down the pie and rubbed her stomach. Brooke started to turn as red as the tomato sauce from her pizza but didn&#39;t stop her, as she started to feel a tiny bit better.<br />
     &quot;You&#39;re looking a bit bloated there Brooke, and we haven&#39;t even had dessert!&quot; Jean said jokingly as she stood up leaning on one leg.<br />
     Brooke looked at the pie and stared at it dully, but chocolate was one of her most, if not the most, favorite thing in the world. She looked back down at her stomach to see her stomach bulge out and started to grow a few veins. She looked back at the pie and thought about it for a minute before coming to a conclusion that she probably regretted..<br />
     &quot;Jean, could you feed *burp* me and help me eat it *hiccup*? My body *wet fart* is *burp* kind of sore from eating *long burp*,&quot; she said turning even redder than before. Jean went back to the kitchen and came out with an even larger spoon.<br />
     She pulled out a chair, scooped a large spoonful of pie, placed it near Jen&#39;s mouth, and happily said,&quot;Of course sweetheart, that&#39;s why I&#39;m here.&quot; She put the spoon into her Brooke&#39;s mouth and moved her jaw around so it would be easier to swallow, then Brooke did the rest. The taste was, as usually, heavenly, but got tired of it after the 2nd bite. After 4 good spoonfuls, she said,&quot;Ok Jean, I think tha-&quot; until she was interrupted by another spoonful. She was about to speak up again until another spoon went into her mouth. Realizing that there was no hope, she stayed silent for the duration. This would&#39;ve happen already as when she just finished chewing, another spoonful went in. Two spoonfuls later, Brooke&#39;s cheeks were bloated with with chocolate and her body and around her mouth were covered in more chocolate and pie crust. Her naval was popped out all the way and her stomach increased to 7 inches. She felt she was literally going to explode. She groaned and let out multiple booming, putrid wet farts. The sad thing about chocolate was that it gave her really bad gas.<br />
     Brooke managed to clear out enough chocolate from her mouth and managed to mumble,&quot; *wet farts* Thanks... *long burp* for feeding me *gags*.&quot;<br />
     &quot;No problem sweety, I&#39;ll leave you her to digest,&quot; Jean said as she pats Brooke&#39;s bulging stomach, causing her to wince in pain. She nods and thinks,&quot; That was the greatest, and the worst, dinner I&#39;ve had in my life.&quot; She groans and falls into a food coma.</p>
