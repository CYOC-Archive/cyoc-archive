<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;You guys gonna do a makeover or somethin'?  Go all 'Queer Eye' on my buddy?&quot;  Big Jim said folding his hairy massively muscular tattooed arms over his chest and casting a threatening stare at you.  &quot;'Cause no one fucks with Waldo, he's mine.&quot;  Jim says softly.<br />
<br />
Big Jim then pulled Waldo to his body and placed a huge protective arm around the smaller man's shoulder.  Waldo, hugged the bigger man around the waist and caressed his huge mate's furry arm.<br />
<br />
Max spoke up, &quot;No, we don't do Queer Eye makeovers, but I think Waldo might feel like a new man after the six of us have given him our all.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jim looks you all over and then turns to Waldo, &quot;Whatcha say buddy?  You wanna bottom for these guys?  You know I love to watch you have a good time.&quot;  He said and gently caressed his cheek with the back of his furry paw.<br />
<br />
Waldo smiled up at Big Jim, his homely face on a larger muscular man would look brutish, the kind of a face you'd expect a convict or boxer to have and that despite it's lack of standard beauty would still be attractive for it's bestial appeal.  If Waldo were bigger, you'd expect him to be a bodyguard or bouncer with his looks, especially with his broken nose and the scar that ran across it and down one cheek.  However, on the smaller man it did him no favors.  Instead he looked gawky and gaunt and his scar spoke of his years of being bullied by bigger kids and later, bigger men.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot;  Waldo said in his thin, reedy voice, looking at us with lust in his eyes, &quot;I think I'd like one of these big furry fuckers to suck me off.  And I want  biggest one to fuck me while I suck you.&quot;  Waldo said, reaching up and running his hand through Jim's chest fur.<br />
<br />
Big Jim turned back to look at us, &quot;You guys think you can handle that?  If you make my buddy happy and I'm happy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Steve smiled, &quot;We can handle that can't we guys?&quot;  Everyone nodded.<br />
<br />
Jim bent down and gave his love a quick kiss then straightened up and said, &quot;Waldo and I gotta get the buffet ready.  We'll see you guys in a couple of hours.  Al will close the place down 'bout midnight.  Hank should be here soon to set up the bar.&quot;  Big Jim gave us all another appraising look, &quot;Don't disappoint my buddy.&quot;<br />
<br />
The pair turned and headed back into the pool room to go down into the secret basement.  Waldo stopped, lingered for a second longer looking back at us and then was around the corner.<br />
<br />
Derek and Greg came back from the restroom just in time to catch the end of the exchange between us and Big Jim.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, Waldo and Jim seem to be a unusual pair.&quot;  Jack said.<br />
<br />
Greg, taking his seat, pouring himself another beer said, &quot;Jim and Waldo go back at least ten years.  Jim used to fuck around with big bruisers like you guys, but since he and Waldo hooked up, he's been pretty devoted to him.  Not that they don't both play, but Big Jim is always there for him and is far less wild than he used to be.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So what's the story?  How'd they hook up?&quot;  Ross asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I've known Jim for a long time.&quot;  Derek said,  &quot;He was quite a loner. Bad boy biker.  Tough, mean; didn't need anyone.  Well one day Big Jim is sellin' some pot in an alley and the guy he's sellin' to decides that he can take Jim, especially with the thirty eight special he has.  Jim was really stoned, and I guess he was seriously not thinkin' straight so he didn't notice the gun.  He said it was like it came out of nowhere.  The guy shot Jim, in the gut.  Jim goes down, doubled over and the guy makes off with the pot.  Well, luckily, the shot didn't hit any arteries or anything, but Jim was still bleeding pretty bad and probably would have died.  He tried to make it to his bike around the corner, but had started going into shock so he wasn't too steady and fell over a couple of times.  Along comes Waldo who sees Jim clutching his gut, bleeding all over the place.  He calls 911 and stays with Jim while they arrive.  He follows the ambulance to the hospital and waits for Jim to get out of surgery.  A couple of days later Jim's out of intensive care but is fighting an infection.  Waldo visits him every day and I guess that's when Jim fell in love with him.  Jim, of course, got as much financial help from his bros as they could give but it was Waldo who put a second mortgage on his house to clear Jim's medical bills.  The guy who shot Jim hasn't been caught and, of course, Jim couldn't really provide an accurate description.<br />
<br />
Jim moved in with Waldo after he was released from the hospital, Waldo offered  because Jim lost his apartment when he was in the hospital.  Waldo owns a catering business.  He put Jim through culinary school and that's why the buffet ala Jim.  The business has really picked up too, Jim is a really good chef and cleans up really well.  His personality and looks have helped, especially in getting contracts for some of the Bear events.<br />
<br />
Needless to say, Jim thinks the world of Waldo and gives him all the credit for changing his life for the better.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow!&quot;  Max said after pull on his beer, &quot;That's pretty damned cool.  Those two have something very special.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll say!&quot;  Rick says, &quot;I think they're both pretty lucky.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And about to get luckier!&quot;  Steve said with a smile.<br />
<br />
Around 11 pm Hank showed up to the bar carrying a couple of boxes of liquor.  Al had been over a couple of times and the Bear Pit's patrons and members of the private club had been coming in since nine o'clock.  Soon the place was full of bears, wolves, chubs, otters and admirers.  It wasn't crowded, per se, but it was a lot more active than it had been that afternoon.<br />
<br />
At 11:30 Al called last round and by 12:05 am all but the members and invited guests, that being us and one other guy named Chuck, had left.<br />
<br />
Al gathered everyone in the pool room after locking up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Gentlemen,&quot; he growled around his cigar, &quot;Those of us who are members know the drill, however for the benefit of our extremely handsome guests, I will explain.  The Pit is not clothing optional.  The Pit is a nude zone, except for fetish wear.  Some of you guys love your leathers, and what have you, and certainly we're not going to forbid that.  However, street cloths stay up here in the pool room.  You will notice along the wall that there are many hooks on which you can hang your clothes.  The Pit is about pleasure and safety, an environment where we can satisfy our needs without fear of repercussions.  We're all responsible adults, so I don’t think I need to tell you that if someone doesn't want something done, then you don't do it.  If they voice an objection you simply stop.  To that end, tonight's safe word is aardvark.  Incase you forget, it's written on the chalkboard where everyone can see it.  Buffet is as usual, eat what you want and the wet bar is open but we will be watching so no one gets pukin' drunk.  So, let's strip and get down to The Pit.&quot;<br />
<br />
With that we all took our clothes off.  Several of the members looked us over and woofed or growled in appreciation.  Al, the huge silver furred owner came over, his thick six inch cock already standing up proud, and asked Max, &quot;You an' your boys ready?&quot;<br />
<br />
Uncle Max looked us over, Ross, Jim, Rick, Steve and me, and nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good!&quot;  Al said and then he addressed the whole group.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, one last thing, members tonight is a 'Virgin night'.  Our guest will need a little direction here and there so please be attentive and helpful.  Show 'em around and let 'em in on the in jokes, OK?&quot;  Al said with a chuckle.<br />
<br />
He then went over to the entertainment center.  He reached around the back, clicked something and the whole unit slid to the left revealing a door.  He took a key from the top of a nearby shelf and unlocked the door.  He stood aside and said, &quot;Welcome to The Pit!&quot;<br />
<br />
Soon we'd all filed down the stairs, the air was pleasantly warm and the smell of the buffet had our stomachs growling.  It was dimly lit but the stairs had strip lighting to mark the edge of each step like in movie theaters.<br />
<br />
As we descended, Max whispered in my ear, &quot;This is gonna be fun!&quot;</p>
