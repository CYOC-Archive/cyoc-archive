<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Becoming food and than getting chomped down by some gay store clerk, Mike freaked out <br />
and he swore he was dead after getting devoured by the guy, but he felt himself starting to <br />
wake up and he felt his arms and legs, it must have been a dream he thought. He got up in <br />
a dark bedroom and felt his body, everything seems to be in order but something felt odd, <br />
his usually ripped muscular arms felt slender, same for his body and legs, his chest felt <br />
toned yet hairless and his ass felt bigger than usual, same could be said for his crotch, it <br />
felt odd for some reason, the skin felt like it was covering the whole while he was cut, and <br />
his shaft felt the same length but thicker, and his balls felt like they were swollen, <br />
something was off. Mike searched the room for a light switch since it was still dark, the <br />
room felt familiar yet he knew had never been here, its just than that the place of the <br />
switch popped into his head, he went to the wall and flipped the switch. He flipped the <br />
switched but was shocked to see that his arm was not the blonde tanned arm is usually <br />
was, it was brown, dark brown and it freaked him out, he looked down to see the rest of <br />
him matched, his legs, chest and cock were all darker and he couldn't figure out why. He <br />
ran into the hall outside his room and in his head popped the location of the nearest <br />
mirror, he looked into it and was shocked, there in front of him was Jake, that gay indian <br />
guy that worked at the clothing store, how the hell did this happen, Mike thought. <br />
After a little self-reflection Mile calmed down, he figured this wasn't the worst thing, he <br />
could have stayed the banana and been digested with no return, instead he is Jake. Mike <br />
though maybe Jake had something to do with this and started trying to remember the <br />
events that occurred, he remembered entering the store, looking around, folding some <br />
things, seeing some hot stupid jocks from school entering the store, one of them was <br />
trying on a yellow top and damn was he a douche, but wow did he have a nice body and <br />
ass....wait wait wait, why thats not what happen, the jock was me, I should have been <br />
seeing things from my point of view, but i am seeing them from Jakes? Mike figured he <br />
must be seeing things through Jakes memories of the events of the day, he started <br />
remembering eating the banana, the jock(him) disappearing, the rest of the day going <br />
slow, than near the ending of the day a guy coming in hitting on him and asking for a date <br />
later tonight, Jake had said yes. Mike freaked out a little bit, he knew he wasn't gay, <br />
though from the memory the guy was pretty hot and this was causing his new cock to get <br />
hard. Mike tried to fight it and just wanted to wake up from this horrible dream, he ran to <br />
his bed and started laying down trying to pass out again thinking maybe he will wake up <br />
himself, but that is when he felt something else stirring within this body. Mike felt himself <br />
getup without his control, he could hear something in his head thinking, it was Jake. He <br />
was thinking that it was a good nap but he had to get ready for his date tonight, and that <br />
he was really horny for some reason, he figured had to do something about that soon. <br />
Mike tried to shout but nothing happen, seems Jake couldn't hear him at all and he went <br />
on with his routine. <br />
Jake was not what you would call a very reserved guy, he wanted to get laid and needed to <br />
get prepared for that, after cleaning himself up from top to bottom (large focus on <br />
bottom) he figured he needed to open himself up a bit, and since he was horny as hell he <br />
knew just what to do. He jumped into his bed and went into the side draw, that is where <br />
Mike saw him pull out a decently sized dildo and some lube, Mike though he must be <br />
kidding but Jake lubed it up and soon he was squeezing it up his ass, Mike thought it <br />
would hurt like hell but damn did it feel good, he could feel every nerve and along with <br />
Mike he was moaning, but that wasn't all, Jake started to play with himself, stroking his <br />
cock up and down, the foreskin really helped with it and Mike was enjoying something <br />
which he though was horrible a little while ago, it was than that Jake saw Mike look down <br />
at his own cock, the length of it was pretty much the same as Mikes but the shear <br />
thickness of it made it look like a monster between Jake's legs. Jake went on with jerking <br />
off and different images flickered into his head, even images of himself from the shower, <br />
It seems Jake spied a little on him after gym class. Thinking of himself nude and than <br />
Jake's strong mental thoughts clouding his, between that and the focus on jerking off and <br />
a dildo up his ass, Jake was ready to blow and for some reason it felt more powerful than <br />
normal, as if the stuff he always jerked off to and the pleasure he gave himself felt <br />
somewhat new, he arched back and blew his load all over his chest, it was one of the <br />
biggest he ever blew, thick and all over his chest. Mike suddenly had a mental thought <br />
after everything that happen how it would taste, it was just than that Jake scooped up <br />
some with his finger and tasted it, it was than that the door bell range, Jake freaked and <br />
saw the time, he pulled out a rag and cleaned himself, pulled the dildo out and threw it <br />
back in his draw, he jumped into a tight little speedo that showed off his cock, and put a <br />
shirt and jeans on in the blink of an eye, gelled his hair back and was ready for his date, <br />
Mike saw himself in the mirror, a thin, well dressed Indian guy with gelled hair, a nice ass <br />
and a full crotch that was getting bigger the more Mike thought about it. Jake just went to <br />
the door and opened it and said hey....</p>
