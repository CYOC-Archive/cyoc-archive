<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Jeff hit the enter key a bright light flashed into his eyes, once his sight return he saw that his father wasn’t there anymore. He was still in front of the Chronivac but he was now in entirely different room from before instead of his bedroom he was in some sort of mixed dinning room/kitchen with the machine sitting on the dinning table. At first Jeff thought he teleported downstairs but soon realize he was in a different house as he didn’t recognize any of the furniture or room layout. As Jeff looked around his eye caught the Chronivac seeing a loading bar taking a closer look Jeff saw it at 30% reality change. It then occurred to him that this part of his change, reality was changing to fit the new form he was to grow into. Upon this realization Jeff’s first physical transformation began as he felt all his body hair get sucked in now, Jeff was still wearing the bathrobe which he quickly threw off leaving him only in his briefs which since he saw he was alone also wanted to see his full transformation. All the hair below his brow was gone except for a small patch over his groin as for the hair on top of his head they started to grow long velvety his former light brown hair turning into a dark midnight black shine which then started to braided itself into a long singular strain that reached her upper back. Jeff then a strange height change as it seemed he grew and shrunk at the same time only to find his legs seem to have grown longer but his spine shorten into a very visible arc leaving him at a very sensible 5’9”. Jeff then felt the muscles in his arms start to condense and soften until they left soft supple limbs with smooth long fingered hands similar feeling then happened in his legs only this time large deposits of fat were left leaving thick thighs and full calves, along with much smaller feet. At this point Jeff knew he was becoming a woman as only the third option would have this much physical change to his body which meant this house probably belong to him or well future her and that the Chronivac had given him a new life to fit the reality change of him becoming a woman. It was at this revelation that Jeff’s next change started to happen much to his surprise as his skin soften up and smooth out as expected but than his skin tone started to darken to which Jeff first thought was a tan until the color pass a any meaningful sense of a tan as his skin turn into a deep dark color clearly showing a new African heritage which he soon found not too odd as his grandfather came straight off the boat from Nigeria but then Jeff remembered he wasn’t actually Nigerian which meant he was gaining new memories for woman he was turning into, Jeff just hoped this meant he wasn’t going to lose his old memories. As these thoughts ran through his head his torso went under more changes as he felt his shoulders shift into a far thinner stance while his waist compressed into itself leaving a far more fit and smooth core although this was hardly noticeable due to being 8 months pregnant Jeff’s entire upper body looked entirely female except for one or rather two features that were missing which was soon addressed as Jeff’s pecs started building pressure in them, his nipples took a far darker tone than his already black skin and grow into pretty sizable areolas as the the muscle tissue in his chest transitions into fat and increase in size exponentially. Jeff quickly grabbed his new breasts as they continued to grow suddenly feeling the increased sensitivity causing his mind to fantasize about all the positions he can do now. As Jeff’s mind finally calmed down he see his breasts have stopped growing at a hefty DD-cup although he does believe pregnancy hormones are more than likely the reasons for their size until a new memory reveal that he was an early bloomer in his teen years leading to the highly impressive rack he now sports which has only grown a small amount since the pregnancy began. At this point Jeff started thinking wether or not he should start using more feminine pronouns as he she was practically a woman only just not in the face and genitals which soon changed as the area where his/her legs and torso meet started to change first his/her ass grew into a thick heart shaped cushion of fat matching his plump thighs which lead to his/her hips to pop into a wider stance finishing Jeff’s hourglass figure then Jeff felt his little micro penis which has stood erect during his/her transformation start to get sucked into his/her body along with his/her scrotum and testicles leading to a feminine slit to form from there absence whereupon Jeff could feel her penis turn into a clitrois, her testicles becoming a new set of ovaries and the scrotum turn into walls of her new womb where the baby then firmly implants itself. As this last change completes Jeff finds herself relieved as she was wondering how she going to deliver the baby without the proper organs when Jeff then came into two realizations first she could naturally consider herself female without working too hard while the idea of being male almost seems to upset her and second she was now caring for the baby she was carrying when she started she was just curious how the pregnancy would work for man with no real thought to the baby but now half her mind seems consumed with her little bundle of joy’s well-being and happiness. At the same time Jeff’s final change began as her previous boyish face started gaining more feminine features his brow and chin become less rigid and became more rounded, her cheekbones rose into a more prominent place, her nose shrunk turning into a cute subtle feature, her lips grew more pout and thick becoming some of the most kissable lips she knew and then her eyes became larger and more rounded with a warm brown color. As the changes settled where once was young boyish face a mature womanly one full of kindness and wisdom now remained. It was at that moment her transformation was complete and in the place of Jeff the pregnant teen boy, Jasmine Owens now stood in the nude of her dinning room. Jasmine quickly tried to hold her shock as she felt completely natural except for being naked her new memories telling her she has alway been this way but she still remembered Jeff and how she was formerly him. Jasmine first act was to check the Chronivac to see how this happened where she found that when she entered to turn her into a woman the machine was missing some info for the woman she was to turn into and in Jeff’s quick action went with randomize settings turning not only Jeff into a woman but into Jasmine. Jasmine made a quick check to see that everything was in the right place. <br />
Name: Jasmine Owens. <br />
Race: Nigerian. <br />
Age: 26. <br />
Occupation: Veterinary currently on maturity leave. <br />
Mind: New memories primary previous memories secondary. <br />
Reality: change to fit form.<br />
At first Jasmine thought she should be upset with this but she felt so comfortable in the person she is and with her new memories that took president over her former memories she felt content with the current situation. She then saw that she was still completely nude and when she looked for the underwear and bathrobe that came with her only to find that they have disappeared which made sense as they were Jeff’s and she was Jasmine. She then left the dinning room to find clothes which lead her to living room where she found a nice set of furniture and a fireplace where on the mantel she found pictures of her family, an image her grandfather and mother first coming to America from Nigeria, a picture of her college graduation with her extended family and also a framed Polaroid of Jasmine’s grandmother who sadly died before her family immigrated to the US. After seeing these pictures Jasmine’s mind was overrun by her memories of her grandfather and mother working so hard to make a life for them, of how her father left her mother when things got too hard abandoning his family and how her grandmother tragically died in Nigeria due to improper medical facilities but was also reminded how her grandfather was driven to go to America after his wife’s death to improve his family’s opportunities, how her mother overcame the challenges of being a single mother and brought greater success without her dead beat boyfriend and how those lessons were taught to her which lead her to great success as well. Lessons she hoped to pass onto her own child. Once pass the living room Jasmine managed to get the master bedroom where she quickly took a sit on the bed wether she was tried from the pregnancy or the transformation she couldn’t tell. As she looked around she saw something that brought her heart to a flutter a framed wall photo of her and her husband Tyrone on their wedding day which lead her mind to only think of her handsome soulmate. They had meet in college where they took the same philosophy class as their social studies credit they had hit it off almost immediately. Tyrone was a fit 6 foot African American gentleman who thought the world of Jasmine and is just as excited for their baby as she is. When Jasmine thought where he was she soon remembered that he was at the law office working his way to be getting his own cases soon but all that would be dropped if she so much as break a nail. Their love for each other would put Romeo and Juliet to shame. After quickly catching her breathe Jasmine went into her closet to find an outfit for the day where she saw one of the very few downsides of being pregnant now being a young healthy woman she wasn’t bothered by morning sickness or cramps and she didn’t really mind the cravings as it has lead to some quite delicious combinations no matter what her husband says, what has been a hassle is finding something to wear, as months went by she found harder and harder to wear any of her favorite styles which held lots of slim fitting skirts blouses and dresses there were a few more loose fitting dresses but she wasn’t going to wear any of that for staying at home also none of the lingerie she also enjoyed wearing to surprise her husband with also couldn’t fit as well. In the end Jasmine went with a plain black sport’s bra and panties set and some gray sweats although not as fashionable she did have to admit it was far more comfortable and will probably be wearing more of this in the future to keep up with her baby. But she did make sure to go her jewelry set for although she would compromise on her fashion her jewelry wasn’t one as most of it were gifts from her friends and family. First a set of gold colored metal bangles given to her by her college roommate as a graduation gift, second a pair of feathered earrings from her co-worker from her baby shower, next her sterling silver wedding ring she was never a fan of diamonds especially after hearing all the horror stories of blood diamonds from her grandfather and the fact that Tyrone got her a ring without a diamond without her mentioning not wanting a diamond just showed how much he cared and paid attention to her, and the last piece she placed on an elegantly carved wooden cross a gift from her grandfather that used to belong to her grandmother. Once she was fully dressed Jasmine left her bedroom and saw a door directly across from her with a feeling she should enter. As she opened the door memories flooded her brain of how her and Tyrone always wanted children and getting down to having some soon after marrying each other, the heartache after each negative test result and until little over two years into their marriage a miracle finally happen, Jasmine was so happy when she saw that plus on the test and her husband basically lost his mind, her mother almost had a heart attack and her grandfather literally fell to his knees thanking god. They all went to work real fast afterwards they bought all the baby and pregnancy guides, they found only the best doctors to help Jasmine with her treatment and planned out to give this child every opportunity from choice daycares, preschools and even kindergartens but Jasmine proudest preparation was behind this door, the nursery. Jasmine had a tendency of just entering this room and impatiently waiting for her baby to be born. The nursery had everything needed for a growing baby a shifting crib that will change shape and size as the child grows, a changing table, two baby monitors just in case and plenty of toys for the little guy to play with. The nursery was also safari themed to represent the baby’s African heritage and Jasmine’s love of animals, entire wall was painted with the scene of a watering hole filled with all sorts of animals such as lions, elephants, gazelles and more, most of the toys were of African animals including a stuffed rhino and cheetah. The final touch was a picture of Jasmine’s ultrasound showing her baby at this picture she almost burst into tears although she doesn’t really know why she has seen the picture plenty of time at this point but still felt so happy. She then left the nursery and back to living room where she sat down started reading one of her baby guides she still had a lot she could do and so little time left until her baby is born. As for Jeff she figured she could deal with that later until she felt a strange feeling in her mind where she senses a feeling to go back to being Jeff after now experiencing pregnancy all he wanted but Jasmine didn’t hold the same feelings she had spend two years trying to get pregnant and she wasn’t going to give that up not when she was so close to having her child, she had already chosen names for the baby Joseph if it was a boy and Morgan if it was a girl. Jeff argued that she hadn’t even been Jasmine for an hour and that they need to return home. At the notion that she wasn’t home when every fact showed that she has lived quite the life so far was a step to far, so Jasmine went back to the Chronivac where she pulled Jeff’s profile which was saved before his transformation believing he was about to go back Jasmine surprised him by forever deleting Jeff from its files erasing secondary memories Jasmine had leaving only her and her baby alone. Now she still knew what the Chronivac was and that used it to change something she just doesn’t know what she changed. But now the question remained what to do with the Chronivac?</p>
