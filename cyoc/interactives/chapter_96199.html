<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After another couple of periods went by, Rodrick actually started to get bored.  Yes, he was trapped as a pair of underwear and he was being worn by his fat, hairy gym teacher, but there really wasn&#39;t much to do.  He could occasionally hear muffled voices and the squeaking of shoes on the gym floor, but that was it.  So he experimented with his new-found ability to control his own senses.  Perhaps he would discover some way out of his current... predicament.<br />
 <br />
He found he could look out from any position on his body.  The placement of his nonexistent &quot;eyes&quot; could be slid around, anywhere on his surface.  Though, this wasn&#39;t terribly helpful to him, as he couldn&#39;t see through Mr. Grimaldi&#39;s pants.  Maybe he could reach out with his sight and see past the nylon barrier.  Rodrick focused, trying to extend his &quot;eyes&quot; outward, past the gym shorts that currently covered him.  Then, suddenly, it was light!<br />
 <br />
At first, Rodrick thought he was either successful or Mr. Grimaldi had pulled his pants off again.  Then he realized he was too high up to be seeing things from his gym teacher&#39;s crotch.  His view suddenly swiveled and shifted around.  There was a split second of dark, then light again.  Rodrick realized he was actually seeing things from his gym teacher&#39;s perspective.  He was looking at everything through Mr. Grimaldi&#39;s eyes, literally!  Rodrick focused again, and all the muffled voices became loud and clear.  Now he could hear through Mr. Grimaldi&#39;s ears!  One by one, Rodrick piggybacked onto each of Mr. Grimaldi&#39;s senses, until he could also feel, smell, and even taste things as if he were Mr. Grimaldi.  Of course, Mr. Grimaldi didn&#39;t notice anything different.<br />
 <br />
It was very strange.  Rodrick could sense the world through Mr. Grimaldi, but he couldn&#39;t control anything.  He was merely an observer.  Rodrick could feel the weight of Mr. Grimaldi&#39;s bulk as the jogged around the gym, yelling instructions to the students.  He could pick up on a dull ache in his left knee, and soreness in his feet.  But he also felt strength under the soft bulk.  Did his fat gym teacher actually have muscle under all that dough?  Rodrick could also feel the tug of the teacher&#39;s body hair under his clothing.  It was all so strange.  As someone who went out of their way to stay hairless, the sensation was completely alien to Rodrick.  He could even feel the soft cloth of the gold banded underwear, which was currently his body.  Rodrick tried not to focus on that fact.<br />
 <br />
After the initial wonderment and discovery of his new abilities, Rodrick quickly grew bored again.  Sure, he could now see Mr. Grimaldi go through his daily routine, but there really wasn&#39;t anything interesting about it.  He taught the same lesson plan to every single class that came in.  How did the man do it?  How did he not get bored?  It must be tough getting old and fat.  Rodrick was just glad he didn&#39;t have to endure this man&#39;s boring life.<br />
 <br />
Unless he did.  It occurred to Rodrick, that if Mr. Grimaldi decided to keep him, he might have to endure this repetitive routine day after day.  Rodrick internally groaned, as he could not do it externally.  This suddenly went from being the most horrifying experience ever, to the most boring experience ever.<br />
 <br />
Eventually, the school day ended.  Rodrick was grateful he wouldn&#39;t have to listen to his gym teacher explain the rules of basketball for a fourth time.  He watched as Mr. Grimaldi collected his things, said goodbye to a few of the other teachers, and went home for the day.  As they drove home for the day, Mr. Grimaldi switched on his radio, tuning it to the oldies station.  He began singing along and Rodrick deactivated his hearing so he wouldn&#39;t have to endure that nonsense the whole way.<br />
 <br />
After about ten minutes or so, they parked in front of a nice, if small, house.  Mr. Grimaldi walked in and a little girl ran up to him.<br />
 <br />
&quot;Mom!  Dad&#39;s home!&quot;<br />
 <br />
Mr. Grimaldi scooped the girl up in his large arms.  She couldn&#39;t have been older than six or seven.  &quot;How&#39;s my little girl doing?&quot;<br />
 <br />
The girl smiled up at him.  &quot;Fine.&quot;<br />
 <br />
A woman walked up to Mr. Grimaldi.  She smiled as well.  &quot;Hi, hun.  How was your day?&quot;<br />
 <br />
Was this Mr. Grimaldi&#39;s wife?  Rodrick knew he was married, but he didn&#39;t expect to be so... hot.  That meant the girl was his daughter.  He didn&#39;t know he had any kids.<br />
 <br />
Mr. Grimaldi shrugged.  &quot;Alright, I guess.  Hey, did you check Molly&#39;s blood sugar levels this afternoon?&quot;<br />
 <br />
His wife smiled and nodded.  &quot;Yes I did.  All normal.&quot;<br />
 <br />
&quot;Good, good.&quot;  Mr. Grimaldi bopped his daughter&#39;s nose before setting her back on the ground.  The girl, Molly, laughed before running off to somewhere else in the house.<br />
 <br />
Mr. Grimaldi gave his wife a smooch on the cheek.  &quot;I think we&#39;re going to need to take that car to the shop pretty soon.  Those brakes are sticking something fierce.&quot;<br />
 <br />
His wife frowned.  &quot;Oh, Don.  I don&#39;t know if we can afford it.  Things are already tight.  With Molly&#39;s medical bills...&quot;<br />
 <br />
Mr. Grimaldi leaned in and kissed his wife again, this time on the lips.  &quot;We&#39;ll make it work.&quot;<br />
 <br />
Rodrick had no idea his gym teacher&#39;s first name was &quot;Don.&quot;  Or that he was having money troubles.  Weird.<br />
 <br />
Mr. Grimaldi, or Don as he was apparently named, grabbed a beer from the fridge and settled in on the couch, watching sports on the television.  At least Rodrick had something to watch as he waited things out.<br />
 <br />
The former jock turned underwear watched as the rest of Don&#39;s day played out.  He watched TV for a while before eating dinner with his family.  They discussed a few things which Rodrick didn&#39;t find interesting, so he ignored them.  Don played with his daughter for a bit before it got late and put her to bed.  Eventually, Don, carrying a towel, washcloth, and extra set of clothes, entered the bathroom and started the shower.  He started to undress, much to Rodrick&#39;s dismay.  He had been lucky enough to not have his gym teacher go to the bathroom yet, but now he was getting full blown naked.  Rodrick certainly did not want to see Don Grimaldi&#39;s fat, hairy, naked body.<br />
 <br />
As Don began removing Rodrick, the teen felt his connections with the teacher&#39;s senses start to snap.  The first to go was his sight, then his taste and smell, then his sense of touch.  Rodrick reverted his sense of hearing back to his own self and quickly deactivated his sense of sight.  If he could go through this day and avoid a naked Mr. Grimaldi, that would really help.  Rodrick felt himself be tossed into the corner, on top of Don&#39;s other clothes he had worn that day.  Great, now it was back to being on the floor again.  At least when he was being worn he wasn&#39;t stuck in one spot.<br />
 <br />
Rodrick listened as Don stepped into the shower and began humming to himself as he bathed.  Rodrick sighed internally.  Now to play the waiting game again.</p>
