<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jason had been sleeping for about 2 hours before being rudely awakened by his cellphone going off. His feline ear twitched at the obnoxious ring as he opened his eyes lazily to eye his phone. “Ugh… it’s been a long day… who could possibly be calling?” He sat up to look at the caller ID to see Kingsley’s name. Jason scratched his head before realizing he still had tiger claws and dug deep into the back of his head. “Ouch!” Jason looked at his paws to see if he scratched too far down. Lucky, he saw no blood. “Well, that woke me up I guess.” Jason said picking up his phone and answering. “Kingly, what is it? I was in the middle of a nap.” Jason said over the phone. “Your always napping you lazy cat. Even after what happened to Lili and Amy though? How do you sleep through that?” Jason grunted. “It’s Lili and Amy. The names themselves put me to sleep.” He joked. “Sure buddy. Anyway, I was hoping since we got that day out of our system, we could hang out tonight. Watch a movie, play video games, mess with your sister…” Jason was about to inform Kingsley it was 6:00 pm and go back to sleep, but another idea came in his head. Maybe he could do something cool for Kingsley. He eyed his journal and sighed over the phone. “Ya know what, yeah.” Jason went through his shelf of movies and found his favorite werewolf movie. “How about I surprise you with a movie you’ve never seen before? I think you’ll enjoy it.” Jason asked. “Why should I be surprised about what we’re watching? And what if I have actually seen it?” Kingsley asked. “Just trust me. I think you’ll genuinely enjoy it.” Jason assured. “Alright fine. I’ll be there around 6:30 or something.” Kingsley said hanging up. With that done, Jason got back up on his desk to start writing in the journal again. He set the movie “Moon gaze” to the side. “Kingsley as a werewolf! Having a werewolf friend is gonna be so badass!” Jason started to write.<br />
<br />
Jason heard the doorbell ring, and stared outside. He wrote in his journal that a full moon would be showing tonight which would be perfect for the sequence. It’d take some time before showing, but he was positive it would show. The journal never failed him thus far. Jason rushed to the front door and opened it to see Kingsley. “Okay, I’m here big cat. So what’s this ‘super special’ movie you want me to see?” Kingsley said with the quote on quote gestures. “You’ll see. I think you’ll relate well to it.” Jason led Kingsley to his room. Kingsley was a bit skeptical about how Jason was acting. What was he up to? And why did he feel so hot? Kingsley followed Jason into his room to look at the 40 inch flat screen in front of him. Kingsley saw Jason take out the disk with his clawed finger and put it in the DVR. Kingsley always wondered about how Jason feels to be an animal man. What having fur or a tail or higher senses is like and what not. “So, uh…” Kingsley paused himself thinking it might be rude to ask about his standout traits. “Hm? You say something?” Jason asked twitching his ears and tail. “Uh… nothing. Let’s just watch.” When Kingsley saw that Jason was playing a werewolf movie, he’d gotten very nervous. Why though? He’d never think any movie would scare him. Was it even that the movie was scary? Or was it something else? Regardless, Kingsley had chills down his spine.<br />
<br />
Jason took note of Kingsley’s behavior as his feline snout could smell the unnerving presence in his body. Jason thought back to what he wrote in his journal. “When Kingsley would see anything related to the moon or wolves, he’d get nervous and anxious and wouldn’t know why. It was as if he knew what he truly was, but hasn’t fully acknowledged the thought.” Jason took a look out his window to see the full moon being covered by thin dark clouds as he watched Kingsley going through the first change. “As the moon will set over him, the lycanthropy will set in. His ears will grow long and hairy as well as his hands and feet will grow into sharp clawed paws.” Jason saw Kingsley as his ears started to grow long and pointed as dark brown hair started spreading around them. Kingsley, still oblivious to the changes, was starting to grow hair across his hands as his nails started to grow long and thicken around his fingers.<br />
<br />
Kingsley watched through the werewolf transformation and his heart started to beat. Why was he so anxious? What could make him so tense over seeing a CGI werewolf transformation? He started to itch as he scratched behind his ears. For some reason, it felt really good. His nerves were starting to calm once he stopped watching and started to contain in urge in his body. He felt the need to exfoliate himself as he let his eyes close and his tongue hang out while huffing with the pleasure he felt scratching.<br />
<br />
“Kingsley will get an urge to scratch as his canine instincts start to show the more he changes. His nose turns black and stretches alongside his mouth, his teeth sharpen into fangs, and hair spreads down his neck to across his body.” Jason was loving what he was seeing even more than in the movie. Kingsley already looked like a mix between a human and a wolf with his muzzle and ears. He was really waiting for Kingsley to notice what was happening when the changes progressed, which in time he would figure out in a few moments. Jason watched as Kingsley’s shoes burst out revealing long black clawed toes. He sees Kingsley squatting with his knees up and hands on the ground as he starts to reach around his ear with his left leg.<br />
<br />
The amount of relief was too much for Kingsley to stand. Kingsley reached his leg around his back and started to scratch with his foot. It was the most exhilarating feeling. “Oh fuck… that feels nice…” Kingsley panted with his tongue still sticking. He could already feel the tension in his spine start to unravel. In fact, he could swear it started extending out. “Wait… that doesn’t feel right…” Kingsley realized his predicament when he not only noticed he was scratching his ear with his foot, but his foot was a hairy claw. “Arf! What the?” He fell to the floor feeling a really sharp pain in his lower back. He rubbed his back in pain until he felt some sort of bony structure hanging out his lower back. His eyes flew wide open when he felt the sensitive new growth. It had to be…<br />
<br />
“His eyes would glow beautiful gold as he slowly realizes what he is becoming. He feels the extension of his spine in a mixture of amazement and fear as he realizes he has a tail growing in. Not another moment to soon will his entire figure start to change as his muscles start to grow. His beastly instincts cause him to rip and shred off any remaining clothes that resided with his former human self.” Jason stared at Kingsley shocked at his tail as more fur spread around his body. He could see that Kingsley was getting rowdy by the expression in his canine face. Kingsley’s body started to swell with muscle, giving his clothes barely any room to breath. He started to growl loudly as his clothes started to rip and tear through his swelling body.<br />
<br />
“Too hot… grrroOOwwll!” Kingsley’s body was exerting too much heat for him to handle. He hated the thought, but his clothes had to go. With massive grips at the cloth that held together, Kingsley ripped and tore through his shortsleeved shirt as his shifting legs ripped and tore his jeans up, leaving them torn up to the knees. The pressure was too much… Kingsley couldn’t think of anything except how Jason was reacting to all of this. He sees his best friend turning into a mad beast… a… a werewolf…<br />
<br />
“Kingsley looks out the window, noticing the spherical relic in the sky. The white glow of the moon had gave him this wonderful gift of beast hood. His wild eyes could only stare at the beautiful jewel in the sky before coming to his senses. There was only one way to give thanks. To pay homage to the wonderful creature it had created…”<br />
<br />
“aaaaaAAAWWWWOOOOOOOOoooooo!”<br />
<br />
Jason shielded his sensitive feline ears to Kingsley’s howl as the fur thicker all around Kingsley’s body leaving no skin left visible. Kingsley was now in full wolf form as he fell to the floor in sheer exhaustion. Jason thought back to what he wrote in the journal. “As the beast let his call of gratitude be known to the moon, the wolf man collapsed down. Still conscious but exhausted, the beast did not forget his human side. Though his physical form changed completely, his thoughts and intelligence remained. He marveled at the creature he became. Taking in every single feel. His ears, nose, fur, tail… he could only think of what could be possible in this form.”<br />
<br />
Kingsley recovering from exhaustion and excitement, lifted himself up to his enhanced sight, and smell. Everything was so much clearer to him… especially the shock in his friend Jason’s eyes. Kingsley heart skipped a beat. How was he going to explain this? He didn’t know himself that he was a werewolf. “Jason! I… I promise… this is news to me to… I didn’t…” Jason turned his expression from shocked, to excited. “Dude… look at you… that was awesome!” Kingsley sighed in relief at his friends response. “Your telling me you didn’t know you were a werewolf? Your kidding.” Jason said patting Kingsley’s furry shoulder. “I didn’t! Believe me…” Kingsley says as his furry tail wags. “Then again, I’m not complaining. This feels awesome!” Kingsley started flexing his body. “I might even be as strong as you!” He says comparing his biceps to Jason’s. “Hm… I don’t know… pretty close I guess.” Jason teased.<br />
<br />
Jason was proud of his little act of shock he preformed in front of Kingsley. He watched Kingsley getting a feel for his body. Jason even offered to pet him or scratch the back of his pointed ear to which Kingsley welcomed. While finishing the movie, Jason took a mental picture in his mind. He turned himself into a manly tiger mascot, while his closest friend got to be a wild animal every full moon. The journal had allowed Jason to push his imagination to alter reality to his liking… he felt like a god at that point.<br />
<br />
Kingsley approached the window about ready to take a leap. “You… do know there’s a door right?” Jason teased. “C’mon. People still go to work around this hour. I’m not getting caught out like that.” Kingsley paused for a moment. “That being said… your cool with keeping this a secret right?” Jason laughed. “Of course. What kind of friend would I be if I didn’t keep a secret that cool?” Kingsley would’ve blushed at Jason’s comment if it weren’t for the fur covering his face. “We animal folk have each other’s backs ya know.” Jason smiled though his feline snout. Kingsley did the same though his canine muzzle. “Of course. I’ll see ya at school I guess.” Jason waved as he leapt out the window. Jason was glad he was already getting accustomed to his new body. But now at the midsts of midnight, the only thing Jason could think of is catching up on the sleep time his werewolf friend took off him. Jason slouched into his bed with digging his face into his furry arms, purring to sleep.</p>
