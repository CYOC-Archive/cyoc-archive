<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Andy&#39;s mornings had become a ritual of discovery. He&#39;d cleared six-feet miraculously to his still great surprise easily. The book working its magic continuously and consistently. Each day, he woke up with the sun, stretching out limbs that felt increasingly cramped in his dorm bed. Today being no different, except for the fact that his feet dangled off the edge, now THAT was a new sensation that brought a grin to his face.<br />
<br />
Rubbing sleep from his eyes, yawning a bit deeper in tone...he blinked at the realization then dismissed it away, Andy swung his legs over the side, standing to feel the cool floor beneath his feet—his noticeably larger feet he grinned. He glanced down, a chuckle escaping him as he observed how his toes seemed to have declared independence from the rest of his foot, spreading out and taking up more space than he remembered.<br />
<br />
Tristan had been quick to leave the room the past weeks, especially since Andy caught him giving him a quick puzzled glance as Andy was on the floor doing a few pushups. Andy grinned to himself again, was he doing that to show off or be healthy...honestly couldn&#39;t a guy be trying to do both?<br />
<br />
His phone buzzed, a reminder for his morning class, but Andy was too absorbed in his own reflection to care. The mirror, once a place of quick checks, had become a canvas of change. Today, it showed a young man who was not only taller but broader at the shoulders, his clothes hugging him in ways they never had before.<br />
<br />
&quot;Looks like it&#39;s time for another shopping trip,&quot; Andy mused, noting how his t-shirt stretched across his chest, the fabric thinning around his broader shoulders. A new problem for him...A good new problem to have, he figured. Andy had decided to invest in a good pair of extra large sandals. He had looked like an awkward goof two weeks ago, he heard the small chuckles behind him...but now they were looking well fit on him...which again was a great thing but also told him he was going to have to go shoe shopping AGAIN. Time to consider thrift storing he was thinking.<br />
<br />
The walk to campus was different now. Not just because of the extra inch or so that added a new perspective to his view, but because of the way people seemed to notice him more. Was it his imagination, or did heads turn a bit more in his direction? Andy couldn&#39;t be sure, but he liked the feeling.<br />
<br />
As he strode into the campus café, a familiar face caught his attention. Tristan, looking effortlessly cool as always, but today, Andy noticed something else—a hint of surprise, maybe even a touch of envy in Tristan&#39;s eyes as they quickly scanned Andy&#39;s taller frame.<br />
<br />
&quot;Should I start calling you Jack, Andy?&quot; Tristan&#39;s voice carried a mix of amusement and something else Andy couldn&#39;t quite place.<br />
<br />
Andy couldn&#39;t help but smile, a sense of satisfaction swelling within him. &quot;Depends if there&#39;s tall enough beanstalks around here,&quot; he replied, his voice steady, confident. The dynamic between them had shifted a bit, and Andy relished in the subtle change.<br />
<br />
Tristan cocked one eyebrow in bemusement then took off a bit awkwardly rushed saying he was late for his class. Andy nodded and gave a wave. THAT was weird.<br />
<br />
The day passed in a blur of classes and glances, whispers and double-takes. Andy felt like he was living in a bubble of anticipation, each moment stretching out before him, filled with potential. It wasn&#39;t just about getting taller or outgrowing his clothes anymore; it was about outgrowing his old self, too.<br />
<br />
Back in his dorm, Andy sat at his desk, the magic book open in front of him. He hesitated for a moment, pencil in hand, pondering his next move. He almost could feel at times his feet seemingly growing along the cool flooring. It wasn&#39;t just about physical changes anymore; he wanted to grow in every way possible. Tristan had made him honestly angry before at the start of all this but now seeing how he was treating Andy differently, Andy was beginning to wonder if he wanted to push the envelop more or mess around with what the book really could do. Right now he looked like a mix of an awkward student hitting a potential growth surge.<br />
<br />
With a decisive nod, Andy began to write, his words not just about height or size, but about confidence, ambition, and the kind of person he wanted to become. As he wrote, he felt a sense of purpose, a guiding force that was reshaping him from the inside out,the book...maybe the book and him.<br />
<br />
As the evening light faded, Andy started to close the book, a sense of peace settling over him before he realized maybe a little fun would be in order and he jotted a hasty line before snapping the book tight. He considered if that thrill of the moment last minute addition was too much or not.<br />
<br />
Tomorrow would tell, And Andy was eager to meet it head-on, one towering step at a time he grinned. He was hungry now though, to the cafeteria he declared aloud to himself, tossing the book atop one of the hard back comics he kept at his desk.</p>
