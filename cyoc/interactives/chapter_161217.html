<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mary leaves the tavern feeling a rush of energy. That experiment was an excellent success. The ruby amulet is truly a powerful lure for any man in town. And it seems this tournament is becoming quite interesting with how many men seem eager to sign up. But with every man that enters, the higher the odds that her Peter will not make it far into the competition. Not to mention he eventually might have to face the Wizard, a truly mysterious opponent. But the tournament is in three days: the young hunter can&#39;t possibly train hard enough to vastly improve his skills in such a short period of time. She wants him to do well, but the only possible remedy she can think of involves magic. And the only person she knows that can create magic is the Wizard.<br />
<br />
So as the sun begins to lower in the sky, Mary makes her way to the Wizard&#39;s home on the outskirts of town near the forest&#39;s tree line. As she gets close, she can see smoke rising from the tiny home&#39;s chimney in spurts of different colors. Mary knocks on the door. &quot;Wizard? Wizard, its Mary. Can I come in?&quot;<br />
<br />
The door flies open after a purple light flashes from the other side. A few steps inside and Mary finds the Wizard in the center of a fort of books on the floor. Books float around his head as he rotates his staff above a bubbling cauldron in the fireplace. He releases the staff and it miraculously keeps on mixing at the same speed he left it. The Wizard rushes around his floating books and bows to Mary. &quot;My sweet Mary, welcome to my home.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It is much larger than it appears on the outside.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, my magic allows me to pull off quite a few tricks. To what do I owe the pleasure of your company? I have been working nonstop to prepare the ultimate festival for your honor.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I appreciate the effort, Sir Wizard. But I have a favor to ask of you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What can I do for you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There is young man wishes to enter the tournament. But I fear for him. He is a good hunter, but I worry he might not fair well or get hurt.&quot;<br />
<br />
Through the Wizard&#39;s hood, Mary can feel him raise an eyebrow. &quot;You wish for me to help someone else win the tournament?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He is just young hunter. The poor boy has fallen deeply in love with me and I would feel horribly if he got hurt because of me.&quot; Mary gets a spark of inspiration from her escapade to the tavern and decides to try some more feminine tactics. She steps closer to the hooded man, close enough for her to stare directly into his hood. But she doesn&#39;t, instead looking down at her own body. She cocks her hips to one side and places a hand on her ruby amulet. She notices his hood angle downward directly looking into her cleavage. &quot;As a powerful wizard, you surely could conjure up some trinkets to help him stay alive.&quot;<br />
<br />
When she senses him thinking it over, she employs a power move. Mary throws her arms around the Wizard&#39;s neck and throws herself to him in a very intimate hug. Her massive breasts squish up against his lean body and she can feel a gasp of shock leave his body. &quot;I mean, you made me. And I am forever grateful. But how can such powerful sorcerer be bested by his own creation?&quot; Maybe if he did not have her body so tightly pressed up against his, the Wizard would point out how he clearly feel under the power of the ruby amulet he empowered.<br />
<br />
&quot;I am a very powerful sorcerer, aren&#39;t I?&quot;<br />
<br />
Mary nods and guides his hands to rest on her hips. &quot;Very powerful. I just need two or three enchanted items and that you promise not to kill him if you face him. That&#39;s it.&quot;<br />
<br />
The Wizard&#39;s shoulders slump and he calls his staff to his hand. &quot;That&#39;s it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thats it. And make them extra strong so when you face him, it really proves how superior you are to the crowd and townspeople.&quot; His staff hand is held aloft behind her back and she can feel it heat up with magical might. She can also feel a certain aspect of her Wizard friend also be raised aloft with his masculine might. But she ignores the strange sensation as he crafts the items for her.<br />
<br />
After a few minutes he let&#39;s go of her to show her the magical items her materialized out of thin air and onto a drafting table. As she turns around, they still glow with his arcane purple glyphs. The longbow appears to be a simple wooden bow made out of very high quality, light-colored wood. It also comes with a ornate brown leather quiver with a multitude of arrows inside. The Wizard seems to turn off his aroused state for the time being to explain his magical conjuration. &quot;That longbow is made of a material found only in the farthest corner of the earth called bamboo. It has been enchanted to be incredibly ranged, accurate, and easily pulled taught by the right archer. The quiver also in enchanted to never be empty of the arrows.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Incredible, Wizard.&quot; She walks over to the belt on the table. &quot;And what does the belt do?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Even I am unsure. I crafted it a bit vaguely to ensure your hunter has a physical advantage during the competition. I know many things of the world, but I am not the most versed in the ways of physical exertion. But the enchantment does seem to be quite substantial so it should suitable for his purposes. It also serves as an arcane locking mechanism for the bow and quiver. Whoever wears the belt can use the bow and quiver to it&#39;s full potential. Does this please you, Dear Mary?&quot;<br />
<br />
Mary jumps up and down with glee. and claps her hands. &quot;Oh yes, Wizard. He should be well protected now. You have done me a great service once again.&quot;<br />
<br />
The Wizard bows his head to her. &quot;I aim to please you. Do you require anything else of me Milady? I have to prepare for my victory in the tournament.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, Sir Wizard. You have helped me enough this day. I&#39;ll go ahead and retire for the night and deliver these to the hunter tomorrow.&quot;<br />
<br />
The Wizard nods his hood and escorts Mary to his door. He gives her hand a goodbye kiss, which to her feels like a strange, yet soft spectral touch. &quot;Fare the well, Dear Mary.&quot; He waits for her to walk away before closing the door and the multicolored smoke resumes its puffing out from the chimney.<br />
<br />
<br />
Mary sets off to her home as the last of the sunlight goes to rest behind the mountains to the west of Buttundoa&#39;s valley. As she walks, she beholds the gifts the Wizard has given to her. Tomorrow will be interesting when she bestows these to Peter.</p>
