<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was nearly twelve in the afternoon, and Tyler speeding down the backroads on his way to visit his Uncle Jack. He was still thinking about this morning, waking up to Colby behind him slowly guiding his massive rod into Tyler’s ass. The thought of getting fucked by a large-dick had never really crossed his mind since his transition; he’d been content so far for Colby to feed him orally. It really brought home how much his body was changing, as if everything about his anatomy was redesigning itself to receive dick. Just thinking about it made his pathetic, two-inch chode grow hard and his stomach gurgle with hunger. Tyler frowned; he’d tried to coax a second course out of Colby this morning, but for some reason the man had been sheepish and nervous after returning from the bathroom. Tyler had barely put his underwear on before Colby was dressed and out the door, off on his way to work. His father likewise had been gone before he’d stumbled into the kitchen for a drink. <br />
<br />
Tyler slowed down to turn onto a narrow dirt that led to a little bungalow perched on a shaded hill. He pulled up in the driveway and parked next to a black Miata convertible. A diesel pick-up was also parked over by a little barn. Tyler stepped out of his car and was greeted by a flock of chickens rushing up to him expecting food. He was carefully trying to pick his way through them without stepping on any chicken toes when he heard the screen door slam. He looked up to see a tall man standing on the porch, throwing fistfuls of crumbled bread into the yard.<br />
<br />
“There’s you’re treats, you spoiled bastards,” his Uncle jack tossed away the last of the bread and crossed the porch to greet his nephew. “Tyler! How’s my favorite nephew doing?”<br />
<br />
Uncle jack was a tall, athletic man with the usual brown hair and hazel eyes of his mother’s side of the family. These days his hair was peppered with grey, and while Tyler had always seen his uncle clean-shaven, he appeared to be letting it grow out now. He wore a blue shirt that clutched tight to his lithely muscled chest, and a pair of baggy black joggers. Tyler wondered despite himself if his uncle was a large-dick, but the baggy pants made it hard for him to tell.<br />
<br />
“I’m your only nephew, Jack,” he reminded him as they embraced.<br />
<br />
“Good to see you. Come in, join me! I’m day drinking, its great. I love retirement.” His uncle rambled on as he led Tyler into the house. The inside was modest; living room, dining space, and kitchen all jumbled together in one great room. Two mis-matched couches were parked under the bay window, with a coffee table strewn with random paraphernalia between them. Something was boiling in a crock pot on the stove, filling the air with a heavenly smell. <br />
“Can I get you something to drink?” he offered. <br />
<br />
“Maybe just some water.”<br />
<br />
After going to the kitchen to fetch a glass, his uncle took a seat on one of the couches under the window while Tyler took the other.<br />
<br />
“What that you’re cooking? It smells great,” Alex asked, kicking off his shoes.<br />
<br />
His uncle leaned forward to pick up his cocktail. “Oh, just a pot of chili for the man doing some work around the property. Would you like some?”<br />
<br />
“No, I’m fine,” though Tyler couldn’t deny he was feeling a little hungry. <br />
<br />
“Alright. So, how have you been? Are you excited for college?” Uncle Jack began.<br />
<br />
And for what felt like a long time, Tyler and his uncle just sat and talked, catching up. Tyler told him about his graduation, the specifics of his new college, what he planned on studying. Uncle Jack explained the circumstances of his early retirement; always the entrepreneur, Uncle Jack had opened numerous restaurants and businesses across town, nurturing them into success over the years before finally selling them all off. <br />
<br />
“So, just like that, you’re retired?” Tyler asked, envious.<br />
<br />
“Well, for now,” Jack finished his drink. “I’ve always worked, ever since I was your age. I want a break.” He set down his empty glass. “Are you looking forward to your birthday?”<br />
<br />
Tyler crossed his legs. “Yeah, I guess. I told my parents I didn’t want anything excessive. Just dinner with the fam and a few friends would be great.<br />
<br />
“And how is your transition going, if you don’t mind my asking?”<br />
<br />
“Its been, uh, different.” Tyler replied, with some hesitation.<br />
<br />
His uncle sat up in his seat and leaned over the coffee table. “I remember my transition,” he said, fishing a little plastic baggy from amongst the debris on the table, “It happened fast. At first, I thought nothing was changing. Then it all snowballed on me in the last week.” He reached for a tall glass water pipe and began packing the little chamber. “By the time the week was over, I was barely an inch long, balls like peas.” Jack took up a lighter and appreciated the surprised look on Tyler’s face. “That’s right, your Uncle’s a small-dick. Judging by the look on your face and the way you have your legs crossed, I’d say I’m not the only one in the room.” He lit the pipe and drew a deep hit, releasing his breath and filling the room with a skunky aroma. <br />
<br />
Tyler fumbled for a response. He never knew; why would he anyway. Small-dicks were so rare, Tyler supposed he’d always assumed that the men he’d encountered in his life were all just regular, large-dicked men. He was shocked, but he was also elated; maybe he finally had someone to talk to about the changes in his life. “Yes,” he finally said.<br />
<br />
His uncle smiled at him. “Well, congratulations. First step is admitting it. Now you have to come have a drink with me.” He said, standing up from the couch.<br />
<br />
“What for?”<br />
<br />
“To celebrate your joining the small-dicked brotherhood, of course.” He said, going to the fridge to pull out champagne. <br />
<br />
“You bought champagne for that?” Tyler asked, incredulous.<br />
<br />
“What?” Uncle jack paused while extracting flutes from a top cabinet. “No, I was having mimosas this morning.” He carefully poured two glasses before popping the bottle back into the fridge. Tyler joined him at the kitchen counter and took up a glass. He till hated wine of all kinds, but he decided to indulge his uncle.<br />
<br />
“So, how did you know?” Tyler asked.<br />
<br />
“Don’t take this the wrong way, but I always had a suspicion that you might turn out to be a small-dick.” He took a sip. “Your father called me.” He confessed.<br />
<br />
Tyler felt like his stomach had imploded. “Oh, fuck,”<br />
<br />
His uncle raised a hand. “Now, now. He’s not angry or weird or anything. He just…worries about you and he doesn’t know how to talk to you about it. He thought you might benefit from me sharing with you my little secret.” He emphasized little. <br />
<br />
“Still, though. Shit, that’s why Colby was acting so weird this morning,” Tyler realized.<br />
<br />
“So, you’ve got a feeder already? Good for you!” Jack said, clinking his glass against Tyler’s.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, my best friend,” Tyler said, blushing. “He’s been really cool through the whole thing.”<br />
<br />
“That’s good. Though, you’ll need to have more than one. I’m sure the man has to work.” Uncle Jack said as he walked back to his seat on the couch.<br />
<br />
“More than one?” Tyler balked. “I don’t know if I’m ready to tell anyone else.”<br />
<br />
“Well, large-dick cum is nutritious for us, but we burn that energy quick. We still gotta eat at least three meals a day,” Uncle Jack said as Tyler joined him at the couch.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, I figured. I’ve been kind of hungry all morning.” Tyler admitted.<br />
<br />
His uncle gave him an appreciative before appearing to change the subject. “Damn, look at the time! My landscaper, Jerry, he’s probably hungry for some lunch after working out in the sun all day. Would you mind going outside and fetching him?”<br />
<br />
“Uh, sure,” Tyler said, setting his glass down. <br />
<br />
“Oh, and take some bread with you; the chickens love the bread.” His uncle called after him.<br />
<br />
Tyler went out the back door and scanned around the property, ignoring the chickens that were pecking curiously at his shoes. In the distance he spied a man fumbling around what must be the chicken coop, and so Tyler set off towards him. Upon approach, he noticed that the man wasn’t all that big, but his back and arms were sturdy with muscle from years of labor. He wore a black shirt tucked into dusty green work pants, and a ball cap over his thick, shaggy hair. When he turned around upon hearing Tyler approach, Tyler saw he sported a handsome beard over his round jaw.<br />
<br />
“Can I help you?” he asked, giving Tyler a once over with dark eyes. Tyler saw them linger for a moment over his crotch. “This is private property.”<br />
<br />
“Uh, yeah. I’m jack’s nephew.” Tyler said quickly. “He said he’s putting on lunch inside?” Tyler gestured back towards the house.<br />
<br />
The man stood up, still eyeing Tyler’s crotch. He chuckled, “Looks like you are your uncle’s nephew, small-dick,” he pointed at Tyler’s crotch. “Better get yourself a falsie if you’re gonna walk around pretending to be a real man.” He laughed.<br />
<br />
Tyler blushed as his cockle became hard, but he said, “Uh, Jack’s waiting inside, and—”<br />
<br />
“He doesn’t mind waiting. You can have lunch right here,” he reached a big hand down to unbuckle his belt, pulling down his pants and underwear just enough to expose the trunk of the thick cock encased within. He pulled them down some more before fishing out his cock and balls. Tyler was fascinated by it; as a grown man, Jerry looked to be about an inch shorter than what Colby had measured as this morning. But this man’s cock was thick, Tyler thought it could even be as thick as it was long. His balls were low-hanging, and much large than Colby’s as well. The man’s pubic hair was bushy and wild, and Tyler could detect a powerful, musky scent inviting him closer. <br />
<br />
“You ever seen the cock of a real man before?” Jerry asked him. “I bet you miss being able to wrap your hand around a real shaft, small-dick,” he taunted, supporting his thick, heavy cock with slow strokes. “If you’re hungry, all you have to do is ask. That little chode you have is useless, but I can give you what you need,” he offered, hefting his schlong by the hand.<br />
<br />
Tyler was stunned, but his body almost seemed to make the decision for him. He took a step closer and got down on his knees like he’d learned, looking up from Jerry’ beautiful schlong to meet his expectant gaze. <br />
<br />
“Please, sir,” he said. “Will you let me suck your cock and feed me your load?”<br />
<br />
“Happy to oblige, Little man,” he said, lifting it so as to hold the tip before Tyler’s mouth.<br />
<br />
Tyler eagerly leaned forward, opening his mouth to let the fat cock glide into his jaw. And glide it did; with a little effort Jerry’s huge cock was sliding deep down Tyler’s throat. He took hold of Tyler’s head and began to drive himself into the boy; Tyler felt him bottom out at a more shallow depth than he would have liked, but it the sensation of his girth was a different experience for him. He felt full and tight, the girth seeming to stretch him to his limits even though Tyler knew his body could handle it. He was made for this, he reminded himself. He felt his cockle leaking in his shorts; he made to reach in to stroke himself, as much as he could anyways, but Jerry stopped him.<br />
<br />
“You can finger you’re little chode after I’ve finished,” he commanded, taking a firmer grip of Tyler’s hair as he increased the force and the speed of his strokes. Tyler just knelt there before him, enjoying the pleasures radiating from his insides before the man slammed himself home and came with a loud groan. Tyler could feel his stomach filling with the man’s seed; it seemed to go on and on, he could feel each pulse. He couldn’t help himself any longer, his hand diving down his pants to finger his throbbing little cockle. Tyler came almost immediately, moaning around the gargantuan cock that stretched his throat wide. He felt a tug, and so he relaxed his throat so the man could pull himself out. Tyler smacked his lips as the man took a deep breath before gingerly stuffing his softening meat back into his pants.<br />
<br />
“How was that, small-dick?” he asked, buckling his belt.<br />
<br />
“Perfect. Your cum is delicious, thank you,” Tyler replied.<br />
<br />
Jerry chuckled. “Yeah, I hear that a lot. And these big balls make a lot of it.” He said, gripping the heavy weight in his jeans. “Whew, I’m starving. C’mon, boy. Lets see what your uncle has got cooking for me.” Tyler got to his feet and turned to walk back towards the house, jumping when he felt jerry slap his ass playfully from behind. <br />
<br />
“That’s a nice ass you got there, boy,” he complimented. “You ever had the pleasure of getting fucked by a real man?”<br />
<br />
“Thanks,” Tyler replied with uncertainty. “And…almost. I’m still transitioning, it was…hard to get it all in,” he said, wondering why he was saying this to this man.<br />
<br />
But Jerry just laughed, “Well, I’ve been working with this tool for a long time. If you ever want to deal with a man who knows what he’s doing, well, you can get my number from your uncle.” <br />
<br />
“Are you one of his feeders?” Tyler asked. <br />
<br />
“Yup, we’ve been friends for a long time. But I didn’t know he was a small-dick until a few years ago, when he retired.” He said. “I come out here every few days or so, work on the property, feed him a load or two.” He laughed as they approached the back door. <br />
<br />
“I see you boys have met,” Uncle Jack commented with a knowing smile when the two stepped into the kitchen.<br />
<br />
“Who you calling ‘boy’, baby-dick?” Jerry said in a mocking tone, making his uncle sigh and clutch the edge of the counter-top tightly. “What do you got for me, baby? I’m starving.”<br />
<br />
“Me too,” his uncle replied before turning to Tyler. “Sorry to be unceremonious Tyler, but Jerry here has a schedule to keep. Come visit me again, sometime this week,” he said, rushing up to push Tyler towards the front door.<br />
<br />
“Wait, you’re kicking me out?” he asked, incredulous.<br />
<br />
“Unless you want to watch me fuck the brains out of your Uncle’s skull,” Jerry suggested. <br />
<br />
Tyler didn’t need to think about it. “No, you’re right. Good seeing you, Jack.”<br />
<br />
“Take care, buddy. And give your dad the benefit of the doubt. He was always good to me, all things considered.” He said, before shutting the door. Tyler went back to his car, climbing inside and pulling out his phone to check his messages. Just one from Colby saying he wouldn’t be off work until midnight. Damn, Tyler thought. He had whole rest of the day ahead of him and nothing to do. He twisted himself into his seat to check the back of car for, sure enough, his disc golf bag. Tyler grinned and turned back around, starting up the car. A lazy eighteen down at the disc golf course would be just the way to pass the time.  He backed out of the driveway, careful not to run over any errant livestock, and sped away down the little dirt road.</p>
