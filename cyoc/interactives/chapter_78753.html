<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I managed to stir Queeny awake and get her to follow me outside because I had important information to tell <br />
Morgana. I think it was her curiousness that made her listen without any fuss and soon we were outside <br />
watching Morgana prance about triumphantly in front of the fallen dragon while Maedel tied its wings down and <br />
jaw shut. She seemed to have an awful lot of rope.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the hell is that ugly thing?&quot; I pointed to the fat, half pig, half whale like creature sat awkwardly <br />
atop the dragons head.<br />
<br />
&quot;That's no way to speak about a beloved family member!&quot; Morgana shouted as she flicked her wrist and the <br />
bloated hippo shrank down into a naked, petite elf girl.<br />
<br />
I rolled my eyes, &quot;why am I not surprised? I suppose you got hit when Morgana's spell reflected off the <br />
dragon, hmm?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, it was actually quite intentional. You see...&quot; Morgana started.<br />
<br />
&quot;Arn fought bravely actually! ... aside from the part where she was running away like a sissy. She dd strike <br />
the final blow though!&quot; Maedel interrupted but now wasn't the time.<br />
<br />
&quot;Listen!&quot; I cried and stamped my foot as all Princess's are trained to do, &quot;The King has split Ariadne's <br />
dragon half and human half. You've just beaten part of her up and the other half is inside relying on us to <br />
rescue her!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, then we'd better go help. Arn put on some clothes. Do you need help getting your,&quot; Maedel paused <br />
noticing how embarrassed Arn was already, &quot;getting your underwear on?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I c-could use some fresh un-underwear,&quot; Arn stuttered, &quot;running from dragons is scary.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You could use some fresh undies too,&quot; Queeny said to Maedel, &quot;you smell like horse poo.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ugh, the dragon knocked me into the barn.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
We regrouped, washed up and put some clothes on then headed for the Kings Palace, a converted bank, not very <br />
impressive really but were soon confronted by another foe.<br />
<br />
&quot;Halt!&quot; came an unfamiliar voice and a very cute, very unintimidating one at that. We turned to see a little <br />
figure in battered brass armor. She carry sword a shield with matching saw-toothed edges that looked as if <br />
they could move. Her pink hair was singed and smelled like popcorn. Her skin had a faint blue tinge to it and <br />
she had the cutest button nose on her cute little angry face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Awr you der hewoes dat took down the King's dwagon?&quot; she asked and we nodded in unison, &quot;Wewll done, Oi was <br />
fighting it myself but then gots attacked by dis,&quot; she held up the rubber chicken with her shield arm.<br />
<br />
&quot;She did it!&quot; said Morgana and Queeny as they pointed at Maedel.<br />
<br />
&quot;What? No! I thought I missed!&quot; Maedel shook her hands and head.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, Oi should have known it would be elven archewy. You may have made a fool out of me and stole-wen the <br />
glor-wee of defeating a dwagon but the King wiwll not be as easy. He has wots of magics and you don't want to <br />
end up wike. We should work togethwer to save Awiadne.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;She's so cute!&quot; said a beaming Maedel, &quot;we have to keep her!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't take me wightly because Oi'm wittle, Oi'm a knight you know!&quot; the little blue gnome pouted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course we would appreciate the help noble warrior!&quot; I said sincerely but perhaps I sounded a little <br />
condescending and upset the gnome. I didn't mean to but I did feel like I was talking to a child.<br />
<br />
&quot;Iss not noice to make fun oth people, you know?&quot; said the teary-eyed little gnome, &quot;Nobody effer takes me <br />
sewiously!&quot;<br />
<br />
I felt so bad I instinctively got on my knees and hugged the poor little thing. Only realizing after that that <br />
could be the exact kind of condescending behave that upset her in the first place. Oh well, in for a penny, in <br />
for a pound!<br />
&quot;There, there. You can fight with us. You were very good against the dragon. We needed elven archery to hit <br />
you!&quot; I turned to Maedel, knowing she was going to protest, and put my finger to my lips. She shrugged and <br />
kicked the dirt in frustration but stayed quiet.<br />
<br />
&quot;T'anks&quot; she said to my suprise and smiled up at me, &quot;Now wets go beat up dat King!&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
We opened the door to the Kings mansion and saw him sat atop the throne. His daughter Connie stood at his <br />
side, still locked in a chastity belt and holding a tray of fruit for her father to eat from. She looked more <br />
like a slave now. There was only one other girl in the room at the time and we could tell it was Ariadne. She <br />
sat nude on her knees before the King, her head bobbing up and down as she was forced to slide her tongue up <br />
and down the his large cock..<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah you've arrived just in time for the uh... climactic finish!&quot; he laughed and clicked his fingers making 6 <br />
champions appear. A mixture of fighters and wizards. All with some magic ability. He whispered &quot;kiss it&quot; to <br />
Ariadne and with tearful, angry eyes the once mighty dragon knight, with the power to transform men, was <br />
compelled to kiss her enemies fat dick. Her already full lips, made plump and luscious bythe slavery spell, <br />
gently pressed against the tip of his penis before her tongue slid between her wet lips to gently lick at his <br />
urethra. she lapped up his precum like the good little bitch the spell made her all the while a voice in her <br />
head telling her to please her master. What scared her most is she was sure it was her own voice.<br />
<br />
Slide your tongue down masters shaft.<br />
Turn your head and take it in.<br />
Deeper, deeper, don't gag cow!<br />
Good bitch. I bet you can't wait for masters hot sticky reward in your mouth.<br />
Lock your lips tight on it. Like a kiss.<br />
Your a dirty little slave and you enjoy it don't you?<br />
Just a little more. You can feel him tensing can't you?<br />
Take it out and ask for it.<br />
&quot;Please...&quot; suck it.<br />
Talk &quot;Please...&quot; suck.<br />
Tell him bitch &quot;Let me...&quot; yes slide your lips and tongue over it<br />
&quot;drink your cum&quot;<br />
&quot;master&quot;<br />
<br />
The King looked down at his eager bitch who stared up pitifully wanting, longing for his cum. He smiled and <br />
brought his hand down on the back of her head pushing his cock head to the back of her throat and holding her <br />
there before letting her go and releasing hot sticky ejaculate all over her tongue. She licked at it and his <br />
cock like a hungry dog and he shot another load. She couldn't hide her smile or the pleasure she felt from <br />
being used.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;I must say the new look suits you, Rachel my Queen,&quot; The king continued as his face contorted from the <br />
immense pleasure Ariadne was giving him as she cleaned his cock, &quot;You really were a fool to marry me. What was <br />
it you used to call my Kingdom? Pathetic? A joke? Well, now I have the riches, power and magic of the West <br />
Kingdom under my command and you and your children are nothing but a joke that even the peasants laugh at!&quot;</p>
