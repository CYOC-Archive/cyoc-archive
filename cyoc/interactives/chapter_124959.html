<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;I want to be younger!&quot; resolutely said the female cloaked person who took off the top of the cloak so you could see her face. It was a pretty mature lady in her thirties. Long black hair, pretty green eyes, and an aging but voluptuous body. <br />
<br />
I asked &quot;Any reason you wanted to be younger?&quot;<br />
<br />
The woman said &quot;Some young bitch hoodwinked my guy... I&#39;m going to take him back!&quot; <br />
<br />
I said &quot;Ah, so he&#39;s cheating on you.... or maybe not here. He was just a friend that you want more from and now that this new girl is around... That is impossible right?&quot; The woman just nodded and I continued saying &quot;So I suppose here&#39;s the deal. I&#39;ll youthen you a year a day, as in when the clock strikes midnight you&#39;ll have 365 days taken out of your body, your id and clothes will fit you so you don&#39;t have to worry about that, and if you ever get young enough where school is mandatory... well it just wont be. You were 35 right?&quot; The woman nodded and I continued &quot;then you&#39;ll have about 35 or 36 days to get your man to show love to you. If you don&#39;t then... Well let&#39;s just say a newborn doesn&#39;t have 365 days to lose right? Either way when the man shows love to you you&#39;ll be able to be as young as you want.&quot; <br />
<br />
The woman said &quot;Sure let&#39;s go then!&quot; I spread my hands out and the woman was enveloped in a gas letting me observe her and putting my little spell on her. Now i&#39;ll tell you a few interesting thoughts I recorded from her.<br />
<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
Day 1, Age 34<br />
<br />
The woman woke up and went to the mirror and before putting on make up noticed her skin seemed a bit smoother. She then thought to herself &quot;Let&#39;s wait a week and then I&#39;ll take my guy back!&quot; <br />
<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
Day 8, Age 27<br />
<br />
The woman felt nice and youthful and sexy (breasts shrank a little but was a lot firmer so whatever). She went to a bar she knew the guy was at and he was by himself. Only to find out that he didn&#39;t recognize her... Sort of... He thought the woman was her younger sister and said to her &quot;Sorry, I don&#39;t want to go out with you. It would make things awkward between me and your older sister.&quot; <br />
<br />
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
Day 9, Age 26<br />
<br />
The woman just stayed in her apartment all day somewhat sobbing and trying to think of a way to get him to love her... as her younger sister.<br />
<br />
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Day 15, Age 20<br />
<br />
The woman started cursing herself as when she went to the Bar they wouldn&#39;t let her in because her I.D. said she was 20. Her body was starting to get less and less sexy and would soon become a minor. She then thought of something.<br />
<br />
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Day 16, Age 19<br />
<br />
The woman had texted the guy asking him to come over. When he came over he saw the woman and asked where his friend was. After the woman said that she was out and coming up with a name for her younger self the man asked &quot;Wait weren&#39;t you older a week ago... Like a lot older?&quot;. Before the woman could say anything the guy said &quot;Whatever. She&#39;s always not ready, but usually she&#39;d be preparing here. If she&#39;s not even here i&#39;m just going to go and you can tell her to call me back.&quot; then left. <br />
<br />
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Day 17, Age 18<br />
<br />
The woman cried to herself and thought about if she should do anything today. The last day of her life she was going to be an adult. In the end she just sulked trying to come to terms with the fact she was going to die in  less than 3 weeks. <br />
<br />
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Day 19, Age 16<br />
<br />
The woman decided that she was running out of groceries and she might as well use her last day of driving to buy as much food and entertainment as she could and have fun with her remaining life. <br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Day 22, Age 13<br />
<br />
Entertainment and food had not stopped her from getting somewhat depressed over her situation. The guy hadn&#39;t even thrown away  their friendship, but she had with this bet. It had stripped her of her friend, career, and sexiness. Now it was about to strike midnight soon and she thought &quot;After today my puberty will go away completely... May as well have one last orgasm.&quot; then proceeded to have one last masturbation session, but right as she was about to orgasm the clock struck midnight.<br />
<br />
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Day 23, Age 12<br />
<br />
A girl screaming into her pillow at 0:01 A.M. had just been denied the last bit of sexuality she probably will have in her life. Her breasts were just buds, her figure was boyish, and there was no sexual sensitivity anywhere. She started sulking a bit. <br />
<br />
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Day 28, Age 7<br />
<br />
Making food is getting harder and harder. The woman made more and more messes just trying to boil some water to make some mac&#39;n&#39;cheese. Not that she really cared she was just clinging on to what little life she had. She looked to her phone and typed out &quot;Thinking of just ending everything. Will be at my apartment if you want to stop me.&quot; Then sighed in her little pink dress. She opened her apartment window and just looked out it while on a step-stool. Her stomach growled a little she hadn&#39;t been able to make anything the day before and she supposed if she couldn&#39;t jump she would starve soon anyways. There was a knocking on the door and the woman said &quot;Door&#39;s unlocked...&quot; then just continued looking out of the window. The man barged in and found the little girl just on the window  and asked what was going on. The woman said &quot;Oh just thinking about what way I wanted to die.&quot; <br />
<br />
The man said &quot;I don&#39;t get it. Where&#39;s (woman&#39;s name)?&quot; <br />
<br />
The woman said &quot;Here!..&quot; <br />
<br />
The man unsure asked &quot;What did you mean about thinking about what way you wanted to die anyway little girl? You really shouldn&#39;t even be thinking about that sort of thing.&quot;<br />
<br />
The woman said &quot;Can hardly make anything to eat so I could starve...&quot; she motioned to the kitchen that the man said was really messy and continued &quot;I could just jump out the window... Or I could just let my curse kill me.&quot; <br />
<br />
The man asked &quot;Wait what curse?&quot; <br />
<br />
The woman said &quot;Oh each day I get a year younger.&quot;<br />
<br />
The man asked &quot;(woman&#39;s name) is that really you? How&#39;d that happen?&quot; <br />
<br />
The woman said &quot;Jealousy, idiocy,  misunderstandings...&quot; <br />
<br />
The man went and picked up the woman and said &quot;come on, stop saying bad things and i&#39;ll get you something to eat... After a bit of cleaning. &quot; The man proceeded to clean a bit of the kitchen and cook a meal for the woman. The man couldn&#39;t deny the girl looked like the woman and had shown her a more paternal love. He stayed with the girl for the night and the following day she hadn&#39;t gotten younger. <br />
<br />
Challenge complete<br />
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
The following day the girl realized she couldn&#39;t make herself older and really didn&#39;t want to get younger. The man called the cops and tried to  get the woman found and potentially locked up for child abuse... To find out the girl had the woman&#39;s paperwork and everything and the cops were confused with how a little girl was living alone and had a decent amount of money in savings and seemingly abandoned. <br />
<br />
The man decided to take the girl in... giving up the lease to the woman&#39;s apartment and doing a few things like freezing her assets till she was older. The man&#39;s girlfriend came in and was fine with her taking in the girl, and the woman and the girlfriend actually hit it off and had some fun together. the man and his girlfriend got married and they had a small family going with a fourth on it&#39;s way.</p>
