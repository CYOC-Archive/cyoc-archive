<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jim slammed his fist on to the table as a protest.<br />
<br />
“Guys. Wasn’t our plan to come here to drink and have fun? I think that silly mobile game is distracting us too much from this.” Jim asked and waved his hand to show the karaoke machine. “I didn’t pay my part of the hundred buck rental fee to come here and watch you two be more interested in that dinky word game. I say we order our cocktails, sip them slowly, sing couple songs and then we test that thing out. Okay?”<br />
<br />
Marcus and Evan agreed. It was too early to mess with the application and it’s powers. Marcus ordered the three sex on the beaches through the bar’s phone menu and all of them begun to sing their karaoke songs one by one. <br />
<br />
After ordering two more rounds of cocktails the whole crew was getting buzzed. Marcus went to the bar’s bathroom and opened the application once more as he sat on the bathroom stall.<br />
<br />
“Let’s see. It’s been targeting me this whole time. I don’t think Jim wouldn’t mind if I used him to generate a new sentence. He was a bit rude just a couple of hours ago.” Marcus scoffed.<br />
<br />
‘Jim is having a good time’ was the sentence that the phone generated. Marcus paused the timer and pressed on the word good to have more time to think what to replace the word with.<br />
<br />
“Gay time? No. He’s already a gay man so it would be redundant. Time? What if instead I change the time to something else. He had a good cock? Nah. Would be funny but too cruel. What would that even look like? Good piss? Nah. We would get ourselves kicked if I typed that. Damn. Evan is the word puzzle master of our group.” Marcus sulked while finishing his leak inside the stall.<br />
<br />
Marcus was getting too buzzed and begun to type on the phone’s screen. Replacing the ‘time’ with ‘cock’ but because of his butterfingers he accidentally pressed space instead of enter which the application allowed to type.<br />
<br />
“Does it let me continue the sentence?” Marcus pondered.<br />
<br />
Marcus typed on the text box something funny and made a new longer sentence that read, ‘Jim is having a good cock in his mouth’. The phone made a bell ringing sound and the application approved the longer sentence with a text ‘The sentence has been approved by our moderator team, please continue.’ Marcus was confused by what he was seeing. Who was this moderator team and did someone actually read it. Marcus then tried to write a new sentence without pressing enter and the previous longer sentence was reverted back to word ‘time’.<br />
<br />
“I see. I can write longer sentences if they are approved. Let me just be sure” Marcus said and typed on the screen, ‘Jim is having a good flbllf lfl fllbfll fllbf’. <br />
<br />
The application displayed an hourglass and after some thinking there was a similar bell ringing noise and a red cross. Under it read, ‘The sentence you tried to type wasn’t approved by our moderator team, reason: the sentence made no sense, please try again.’ Marcus was now certain that it was possible to get longer sentences if they made sense and wanted to keep this information to himself. If they ever got themselves in trouble he could always use this as his ace in the hole.<br />
<br />
Marcus then looked at the time from his phone and zipped his jean’s zipper back up. He had spent too much time with his phone and hurried back to the private karaoke room. Marcus opened the door and saw that both Evan and Jim were too glued on the TV screen as Evan was already switching gears with his pop-rock playlist.<br />
<br />
After Evan it was Jim’s turn again to sing. Marcus looked at the phone’s screen and noticed a sentence. ‘Jim is decent at singing karaoke.’ Marcus wanted to play nice and was on his way to transform ‘decent’ with ‘fantastic’.<br />
<br />
“Marcus. Welcome back. Are you still messing with that phone application?” Evan asked as Marcus closed the screen before any change could happen.<br />
<br />
“Hey! What if we turn this into a drinking game?” Evan asked from Marcus. “Give me it for a second okay? I promise I won’t do anything drastic with it.”<br />
<br />
Marcus handed his phone to Evan and saw that there was a ‘history’ tab with previous transformation listed on there.<br />
<br />
“I knew it. We can’t change the recent one but it allows me to re-edit or revert the following ones after that. It reads here ‘Re-editing or reverting the previous changes may cause a new sentence on the currently holder to be generated automatically’.” Evan read from the screen.<br />
<br />
“So it’s telling us that if the user doesn’t like the change they can always revert it but they would get punished for it? Wow. That’s brutal.” Jim laughed as he stopped singing.<br />
<br />
“It shows here that the change history can hold up to five recent changes so if we keep changing and reverting that punishment it might generate us a punishment we don’t like. So it’s either we have full control what we change or we edit only the ones we have to and suffer the consequences.” Evan continued.<br />
<br />
“So what was your game idea for it then?” Marcus asked.<br />
<br />
“We play rock-paper-scissors and the winner gets to chooses the target for the transformation. They have to either drink a shot chosen by the winner or be transformed by the phone. The other one who wasn’t picked as the loser, teams up with the winner to suggest a suitable drink and a word for the transformation. How’s that sound?” Evan explained.<br />
<br />
“I’m in, but I want to add rule where the loser gets an one lifeline to object at any time but has to perform a small thing. Like a dare?” Jim said.<br />
<br />
“Sure. That sounds fair and straight forward. Let’s try it out.” Marcus hesitantly joined the game.<br />
<br />
“Yeah. Sounds fun addition. We can add more house rules to this if we feel like it. So? Are you ready!? One! Two! Three!” Evan begun his countdown as all three of them nodded their heads.<br />
<br />
“ROCK! PAPER! SCISSORS!” All of them shouted in unison and revealed their hand.<br />
<br />
“And the winner of the RPS-game is…”</p>
