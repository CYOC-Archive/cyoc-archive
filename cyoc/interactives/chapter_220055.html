<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">When Jeff opened the door to the gym, he was immediately met with a strong scent of sweat and masculine body odor, with a small amount of air freshener mixed in, giving proof to a failed attempt at removing the stench. However, to Jeff, it felt relaxing, almost exciting. He felt butterflies fill his stomach, as his workout drew closer. He swaggered in, checking in at the front desk silently like he’d done it a hundred times and made his way to the men’s locker room, where he quickly found his locker and opened it. He took out a pair of headphones he had packed along with his water bottle, gym shoes, and sweat towel. He didn’t need some of his other gear yet, so it stayed in his bag as he put it into his locker.<br />
He made his way out to the gym floor, where he started off with a 30 minute jog on a treadmill. With his headphones on, he listened to a playlist he found on his phone called “workout jams” that was about 40 hours long and was filled with all kinds of high tempo tracks that made him feel powerful. By the time he was done, he’d already worked up a bit of a sweat, but he didn’t want to remove his pump cover yet, so he moved onwards towards the machines. He rotated between 6 different machines, each one focusing on either the chest or back muscles, putting the weight on each machine higher than Jeff ever thought possible, and yet his first sets seemed easier than he expected them to be, but when he bumped the weight up for a second set it was much harder - and much more satisfying when he completed his sets. After a couple hours of rotating between these machines, he switched to a different set, still focusing on chest and back. He continued working himself harder until he looked at the clock on his phone and finally realized how much time had passed - it was already lunchtime!<br />
Before heading to grab his lunch, Jeff placed himself in front of a mirror to check himself out. He immediately noticed the sweat that he was drenched with, leaving a damp spot across his back and down the front of his sweatshirt , dripping from where it sat on his pecs. He also noticed both his ass and crotch were wet with sweat as well, and he smirked with satisfaction. Despite the sweat, he still didn’t feel quite ready to remove the sweats, so he retrieved his lunch and sat in the small cafe the gym had to eat.<br />
As he ate his enormous buffalo chicken wraps, he decided to observe the other gymgoers. He had been so laser-focused on his workout that he’d almost forgotten he wasn’t alone in the gym. As he looked around, he noticed there were a couple other guys there who were about his size, though neither was as tall as he was. Their names flew into his mind - Henry, the older gentleman with no hair, and Kevin, the power lifter who was in his late 20s. While the three of them never talked much on the gym floor, Jeff could remember speaking with them at great lengths in the sauna when he went on Thursdays. There were a couple football players from his school, though he didn’t care to know their names. There was a couple girls there, and they seemed to be there together in a group, taking turns on each machine they used. They all looked fit, and one in particular, the brown haired one wearing a pink sports bra with matching leggings, he couldn’t help but stare at. He felt a stirring in his crotch as he did, his massive dick engorging even larger as he felt himself grow aroused from looking at this woman. She had curves in all the right places, a toned stomach that he vied to feel up, he began to imagine placing his bearded lips on her delicate face, pressing inwards until-<br />
“Yo, Jeff!” Jeff awoke from his wet daydream and looked over to see his friend Chase walking toward him. Chase was a senior in school, a couple years older than Jeff, and took care of himself. Despite not being on any of the sports teams, Chase took care of himself, eating right and working out, and in the previous reality, Chase was always asking Jeff to get to the gym with him. Guess i’m this reality, they were occasional gym buddies. <br />
“Oh hey Chase.” Jeff said calmly, trying to calm his raging boner before Chase could notice. Chase sat down across from him, wearing a sleeveless compression shirt that outlined his pronounced chest well, which, while obviously much smaller than Jeff’s own, were impressive for the average 17-year old.<br />
“What’re up to man, how was game night last night?” Jeff filled Chase in on how he’d convinced Mike to join him for game night, and expressed pride in his son trying new things. Chase was supportive, even excited to see Jeff talk highly of his son. After a bit more conversation while Jeff finished his lunch, the two boys talked for a bit about what the afternoon’s workout plan was - they decided to focus arms that day. <br />
As promised, the two men moved over to the dumbbell area, where Chase grabbed a set of 20s, and Jeff some 65s, and they began taking turns doing bicep curls for each other, critiquing each others’ form and offering encouragement. They moved through some other exercises, and after about another hour, Jeff decided it was time to remove the pump cover.<br />
From both soreness and the sweats clinging to his sweat, Jeff struggled to pull off the sweats. When they finally peeled off, Jeff breathed a sigh of relief before examining himself in the mirror. His stringer tank was soaked in sweat, as expected, and his muscles seemed engorged from the workout pump Jeff had earned. He glistened in the gym lights, and began throwing himself into several poses to examine his pumped physique. <br />
Chase was off to the side, ogling Jeff’s body as he always had. He loved the way Jeff’s muscles moved, the beauty of his massive body… he felt utterly aroused, and a deep desire to be plowed by the massive 16-year old in front of him. ‘That’d never happen, though,’ he told himself, ‘Jeff’s straight… if only…’<br />
Jeff noticed Chase staring. He took pride in knowing Chase was so into him. He may not be gay, but having the approval of a gay man really made him feel good about himself.<br />
“You gonna take some pics of you just gonna stare?” He said to Chase, who excitedly pulled out his phone and began to start snapping photo after photo of the massive bodybuilder. After several minutes of a photo shoot, they resumed their workout, but Chase was noticeably distracted by Jeff’s exposed body and frequently found his eyes migrating towards the massive bulge in Jeff’s shorts, but Jeff didn’t mind. He was happy to be eye candy for his friend.<br />
By the time 4:30 rolled around, they had finished their workout and began putting equipment away. Jeff propped his phone up against the wall and began posing for the video he was taking while Chase stood off to the side watching, his stiff rod leaking precum from the show. After a couple minutes, Jeff took off the sweat-soaked stringer tank and repeated the poses, causing Chase to nearly cum on the spot. When Jeff finally finished and collected his phone, Chase spoke up. <br />
“Can I be honest with you?” <br />
“Go for it.”<br />
“You’re really hot dude… I know you’re straight and all but damn… I’d do anything to have someone like you for a boyfriend. A great dad, hot as hell, muscles for days, not to mention…” Chase eyed Jeff’s bulge.<br />
Jeff chuckled and bounced his pecs. “Well there’s only one ‘someone like me.’” Jeff picked up his phone and saw he had a text from his son. <br />
‘Cars not starting, gonna be late picking you up.’<br />
Jeff groaned. “Hey, would you mind driving me home? Apparently Mike’s having car troubles.” Chase nodded. “Sure thing.”<br />
Just like that, without Jeff realizing, he agreed to be Chase’s boyfriend in exchange for a ride home.<br />
Jeff collected his discarded shirt and sweats. “Thanks. I’ll see you in the locker room, then.” He winked at Chase, who felt his heart flutter. Jeff made his way to the lockers where he stripped off his sweat-soaked shoes, socks, shorts and jockstrap and pulled clean clothes out of his gym bag before discarding the old ones back into the bag. He felt a hand smack his ass, and he turned to see Chase behind him, also nude, staring at him with a thirst. Jeff bent down and planted a kiss directly on Chase’s lips, and at that moment he realized the agreement he made. ‘Too late now,’ he thought to himself, as his cock began to harden from seeing his boyfriend. He pulled out of the kiss and smiled down at Chase, who looked dazed. Jeff chuckled to himself and grabbed Chases hand, leading him toward one of the showers, where he closed the curtain behind them. <br />
He turned the shower on and turned back to face Chase, his cock continuing to lengthen as it stiffened, currently sitting at a massive 14 inches. He bounced his pecs inches from Chase’s face taunting him.<br />
“They aren’t gonna clean themselves you know.” Taking that as permission, Chase stuck his face directly onto Jeff’s massive chest and began using his tongue to clean the sweat off of his boyfriend’s body. Jeff moaned in delight, the feeling of worship sending waves of ecstasy through his body. Chase continued working, using his tongue to explore every crevasse of Jeff’s massive muscled chest and stomach until Jeff finally decided he needed release.<br />
Jeff picked up his boyfriend, easy enough to do with his massive muscles, and turned him around so his ass was at the perfect height for Jeff’s fully hard 17 inch member. Jeff pushed his boyfriend against the wall, pinning him in place while he inserted his massive member into Chase’s inviting ass. Chase moaned with delight as he felt Jeff rearrange his guts as he thrust himself into Chase repeatedly. Jeff groaned loudly as he pushed in, not caring who heard the behemoth plow the smaller man, and when he eventually came, he roared loudly, announcing his triumph over his boyfriend.<br />
Chase was unable to find his footing for a few minutes, lost in ecstasy, so Jeff continued to hold him up. “Didn’t think I tore you up that badly.” He said, humor in his voice. He eventually held Chase into his body, allowing him to lay into Jeff’s massive pecs for a time while Jeff used his other hand to wash their bodies. When Chase finally felt able to stand on his own, he agreed to wash Jeff’s back, an act he thoroughly enjoyed. Finally, after finishing cleaning the sweat and cum off them both, he two of them exited the shower and redressed in clean clothes before getting into Chase’s car.<br />
When they arrived at Jeff’s son’s house, they sat in the driveway for a moment, and Jeff leaned over and pressed his lips on Chase’s once more. “Thanks for the lift home, little guy.” Jeff rumbled. Chase blushed.<br />
“Anytime, my big hulk.” He reached into Jeff’s lap and squeezed the thick stick that laid on Jeff’s lap, sending shivers down his spine. Eventually, Jeff exited the car and opened the garage, waving Chase off as he drove away. Inside the garage, Jeff could see his son bending over the hood of the car, his forearms covered in grease.<br />
“Welcome home dad, sorry I couldn’t pick you up.” Mike said, regret in his voice.<br />
“No worries son, you know Chase is always good to drive me home.” He placed a hand on Mike’s back, looking over his shoulder into the car hood. “Now what’s going on in here, and how can I help?”</p>
