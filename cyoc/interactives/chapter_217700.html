<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">[NOTE: Some of the text is from Mr.Domino]<br />
<br />
Eugene felt an enormous weight on his shoulders metaphorically, not the weight that was already present; the sizable mounds of flesh hanging off his torso. Why was it that the magical gemstone had put him into a horrible situation again? Wasn&#39;t being humiliated at the play enough? And even if being a cheerleader was a little better, if he had to be stuck as a girl every time he made a wish, why did it have to drop this kind of a dilemma into his lap?<br />
<br />
&quot;Why me? Why am I the one that has to make the decision?&quot; Eugene whispered to Emily as he stared back and forth at the increasingly agitated group of cheerleaders and a fidgeting Willow. His changed eyes once again locked on the conversation that Joanna and Gloria were having and again the silent alarm went off in his head.<br />
<br />
&quot;Because you&#39;re Eve Kazinski! Even if Joanna wants to be the sole captain of the team, she knows she can&#39;t do it without you. It&#39;s because you&#39;re nice to everyone, Eve, everyone looks up to you, even Amazons like Ingerman! Plus this is, like, sort of your fault. You did tell Willow she could try out. You&#39;ve got to make a choice, girlfriend. Either tell Willow to leave and hurt her feelings, or we watch her probably make a fool out of herself&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But I didn&#39;t! I don&#39;t remember doing any of that!&quot; Eugene protested.<br />
<br />
&quot;But you did! I was right there sitting next to you! We were working on our Algebra when she came up and asked!&quot; Emily said as her patience began to wear thin. She knew that Eve sometimes had the habit of retreating into her own superstar status when pressed with a uncomfortable decision, but this was absolutely ridiculous. &quot;Listen, if you want to sit there and claim amnesia or whatever, then fine, but this really makes you look bad, Eve. It proves that Gloria is right, that you really think your are &#39;Little Miss Perfect&#39; and can&#39;t handle it when things do go your way. It&#39;s gonna make you look bad&quot;<br />
<br />
There it was again. Those three words that instantly made Eugene&#39;s mind flip from nervous indecision to indignant anger. He wasn&#39;t even sure why they made him so angry, but somehow he found himself in the exact same situation he thought he&#39;d escaped from! <br />
<br />
He curled a tiny fist and felt the carefully cared for nails bite into the soft flesh of his tiny palm. He&#39;d been thinking about revealing everything to Emily, the weird magic gemstone, the fact that they&#39;d been trying out for a play before wishing he was here, even the fact that he&#39;d been a guy old enough to be Emily&#39;s father just a couple of hours ago! But those words, those spiteful words made something click in his brain again and made the ball of stress in his stomach melt into a lake of anger.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know what, Emily? Maybe I&#39;m not! I&#39;m tired of being a symbol of perfection. I never wanted it, but I keep getting stuck in the drama between you and the other girls. You&#39;re supposed to be a friend...my friend, and you look at me like everybody else!&quot; Eugene hissed, pointing a finger into Emily&#39;s face, which quickly shifted from annoyed to shocked.<br />
<br />
&quot;W-what?&quot; The other girl stammered, taking a step back as a flurry of unintelligible murmurs came from the nearby cheerleaders who had been watching the exchange like hawks. &quot;Eve you&#39;re...you&#39;re not making any sense!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I SAID YOU&#39;RE NOT ACTING LIKE A FRIEND!&quot; Eugene screamed at the top of his feminine voice, shoving Emily backwards with a snarl, watching the girl stagger backwards, looking at him with wide eyes. &quot;I haven&#39;t felt right the entire day, and the constant drama is too much. I saw how you looked at Willow. You want her to fail, so you look good in comparison. You&#39;re no better than Gloria.&quot; Emily looked dumbstruck. &quot;B-but I am your friend, Eve.&quot; <br />
<br />
Eugene couldn&#39;t believe it, Emily didn&#39;t even realize that she had done anything wrong. &quot;I NEEDED SUPPORT, BUT NOOO I&#39;M MISS PERFECT. I&#39;VE BEEN CONFUSED ALL DAY. I JUST WISH I COULD UNDERSTAND WHAT&#39;S GOING ON.&quot; As soon as the words left his lips, he realized his mistake. He saw the glowing stone shining through the opening of a duffel bag with &#39;his&#39; name on it, and he felt the change wash over him. <br />
<br />
Eugene cried out in pain and his head was filled with new information, he remembered Emily&#39;s friendship, Eve&#39;s promise to Willow, the relationship with the other girls, the insight into the world of gossiping teenage girls, Eve&#39;s reputation and personality traits (her grades, her athleticism, her popularity, her leadership skills, her positivity, her confidence, her dedication), and everything he would ever need to know about Cheerleading, and it surprised him to know how much effort was involved. <br />
<br />
Eugene was left reeling and was brought to her knees. She was no longer in the dark about her position on the squad, but her gender identity underwent a major change. Eugene felt more like Eve. If her prior identity wasn&#39;t already established she would have lost herself entirely.  <br />
<br />
She felt Joanna&#39;s hand on her shoulder and heard her voice say gently, &quot;Eve. Do you want to go to the nurse?&quot; She expected Joanna to be awful based upon Emily&#39;s comments, but she was far kinder than expected.  <br />
<br />
She answered, &quot;No, I&#39;ll be fine. I&#39;ve just felt an unusual amount of stress.&quot;  Eugene/Eve stood shakily. &quot;I&#39;m not Perfect, despite claims to the contrary. Hearing it from one of my closest friends hurt.&quot; Joanna was sympathetic. &quot;I would hate that too, but you&#39;ll be okay. Now get up. We need our Captain.&quot; Eugene/Eve felt better. &quot;Thanks, Jo.&quot; &quot;You&#39;re welcome,&quot; Joanne winked.<br />
<br />
She approached Emily to apologize. Not only did she feel guilty, but it also unbecoming of Captain. Her reaction while understandable, was inexcusable. As Eugene she had been the victim of bullying and verbal assaults so she knew how it felt. &quot;Emily, I&#39;m sorry. I shouldn&#39;t have shouted at you, but you hurt me. You&#39;re my first friend; you know me better than anyone. If I only cared about popularity we wouldn&#39;t be friends, and seeing you be so petty made me angry.&quot; Emily looked contrite. &quot;I&#39;m sorry too.&quot; <br />
<br />
Gloria rudely interrupted their moment, &quot;So? Are you done being such a spaz. Besides And we still have the Willow problem.&quot;<br />
<br />
The other Cheerleaders gasped at her boldness, not that they disagreed exactly. <br />
<br />
Eugene/Eve knew that Gloria was a bitch from her accidental wish, but to actually experience it was entirely different. Thankfully, she had the knowledge to handle it. &quot;I tired of your attitude, Gloria. I never judged you when you were sick or distressed, so don&#39;t judge me. Furthermore, if you continue to disrupt our teams unity you&#39;ll be off the team.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;WHAT? You can&#39;t do that!&quot; Gloria yelled. &quot;I&#39;m the Captain here. Try me!&quot; Gloria stormed off angrily.<br />
<br />
Joanna applauded Eugene/Eve. &quot;Good job!&quot; She then pointed to Willow, &quot;What&#39;s your decision about her.&quot;<br />
<br />
Eugene/Eve didn&#39;t want to disappoint Willow, but she didn&#39;t want to add a complication before their upcoming event. &quot;I think we could give her a chance, but it&#39;s too close to our next event. She will have to wait, but we could give her our handbook. If she shows potential she can try out. If she doesn&#39;t I&#39;ll turn her down.&quot;<br />
<br />
Joanna nodded, &quot;Very well. It&#39;s a good compromise. We can remain focused and we don&#39;t crush her hopes either. If we&#39;re lucky we will replace Gloria.&quot; Eve laughed, &quot;I wish.&quot;<br />
<br />
She made her way to Willow, &quot;I&#39;m sorry you had to see that drama.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s fine. Did you make a decision. Can I Join?&quot; Willow fired rapidly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Before I make a decision, I need to know why you want to be a Cheerleader.&quot; Willow looked sheepish, &quot;Well...um...you see.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know that expression.&quot; Eugene/Eve sighed, &quot;Look, if you want to join the team to impress someone that is not good enough. To be honest, most of the team wants you to fail, and as you are now you likely will. Cheerleader is not easy, like some would think. You need dedication and hard work to be on the team.&quot; <br />
<br />
Willow opened her mouth, but Eugene/Eve raised her hand to forestall any objection. That said, I&#39;m giving you a chance. I will provide you with our handbook and my personal fitness routine. If you can prove to me that you&#39;re serious about joining the team, then you can try out after our next event. <br />
<br />
Willow looked like she wanted to complain, but settled for understanding. &quot;I shouldn&#39;t have expected it to be easy, but thanks for giving me a chance.&quot; She brightened, &quot;I&#39;ll prove that I can be Cheerleader.&quot;<br />
<br />
Eugene/Eve sighed in relief. Now she had a chance to wrap her head around her new self, until now she had been on on autopilot. How much of her was still Eugene, she wondered? Did she want to give being Eve a chance? Regardless, she definitely didn&#39;t want to risk using the gemstone.  She would hide it as soon as she could. <br />
<br />
Becoming a popular and fit young woman was hardly the worst fate, honestly, manhood had lost its appeal with the previous wish. As Eugene her life was unfulfilling and miserable, maybe she could be happy here as Eve.</p>
