<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Lisa put her hand on Bridgette&#39;s head as she began to thrust her hips a bit. Part of her wanted to toss Bridgette over and take her from behind, but another part knew that this girl wasn&#39;t worth that risk. Not with how many guys had been with her that way. Besides, deep down this wasn&#39;t who she wanted to thrust this cock into. Lisa closed her eyes and imagined Kendall was the one with his mouth wrapped around her new cock, sucking away eagerly.<br />
<br />
The more into it she got, the more she seemed to shed what was left of her feminine side. Her muscles gaining a bit more tone as she gained a bit of height, even her cock felt like it was swelling in Bridgette&#39;s mouth. Even her worries seemed to be melting away as she let herself sink into her fantasy. Was this what it was like for them, feeling strong, powerful? She grunted as she felt something stirring down in her cock.<br />
<br />
Almost by instinct she pulled herself out of Bridgette&#39;s mouth and shot her load onto the party girl&#39;s face, he mouth still open to catch some. She let out a surprisingly deep moan of satisfaction as she came. But it also seemed to clear her mind a bit and bring reality crashing home. She looked around the sty of an apartment, the trashy rich girl in front of her and felt.. wrong. Guilty.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mmm... big boy.&quot; Bridgette said with a smile as she licked cum from around her mouth. &quot;How about we take this further.&quot; She was still kneeling on the ground, looking eagerly up at Lisa as she cupped one of her breasts, bouncing it to tempt &#39;Lewis.&#39;<br />
<br />
Lisa shook her head and quickly pulled her shorts back up, tugging the tank on over her torso. The clothes seemed to fit better than they had when she first donned them. They had been baggy having been borrowed from her jock of a little brother, but now they were just loose. &quot;Umm.. pass.&quot; Lisa started to make her way to the door.<br />
<br />
Bridgette grabbed her arm and by reflex Lisa pushed her away, but she wasn&#39;t used to her new strength and sent the party girl sprawling back into the couch. Luckily Bridgette was unhurt, but suddenly ashamed in more ways than one, Lisa bolted from the apartment. One of Bridgette&#39;s male friends tried to get in her way as she fled but he just wound up and decked him across the jaw.<br />
<br />
Lisa didn&#39;t know where that instinct had come from, it hurt her hand, but watching the guy go down felt good. There was enough confusion in that moment that Lisa got back on to the street. She looked down at her hands as she walked. Her fingers were thicker, and her whole hand was just generally larger, even her nails were shorter than they had been and red hair was growing in on the back of them and up her forearms. Thicker forearms with veins clearly showing along them. There would be no confusing them for a girls hands and arms.<br />
<br />
She pulled her hair back off her shoulders and into a low pony-tail, at least that still felt right to her. She had always been proud of her fiery red hair, that at least that part of her identity was intact seemed to soothe her. She slowed down as she came to a gym, it wasn&#39;t a normal gym either, not as she peered in the window. She saw two guys in a ring with gloves exchanging punches and jabs. Something seemed to draw her in, she opened the door and stepped inside, watching the bout with interest.<br />
<br />
&quot;Haven&#39;t seen you before.&quot; A deep voice said next to her. She looked over to see a powerfully built man, his dark skin sharply contrasting with the white tee and and red shorts he wore. He was grinning down at her from his height advantage of more than half a foot. Lisa wasn&#39;t even sure how tall she was at the moment but this guy definitely was.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just.. looking.&quot; Lisa said carefully, still watching the two men in the ring.<br />
<br />
&quot;Looking to take up boxing?&quot; He asked. &quot;Best sport for working out a little aggression.&quot; He nodded down to Lisa&#39;s hand, she hadn&#39;t noticed the scrape along her knuckles from decking the guy on her way out of the apartment. &quot;Name&#39;s Tyrone. I own the place.&quot; He held out a hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;Lewis.&quot; Lisa said, the name coming to her lips a little too easily, accepting the hand to shake it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, listen. I just opened the place a month back and I&#39;m still looking for members. How about I give you a free lesson on the house, and if you like it, you come back for more. Otherwise, no hard feelings.&quot; Tyrone crossed his well-muscled arms over his chest as he regarded &#39;Lewis.&#39;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why the hell not?&quot; Lisa said. &quot;I could use something to get my mind off things.&quot; Tyrone just grinned.<br />
<br />
---------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Kendall made his way home right after school. He knew he should have waited for Allison but he felt like he needed alone time. Ever since things had started going weird he really hadn&#39;t taken any time to be alone and think. He sat in the driveway for a long few moments just staring up at the house.<br />
<br />
Last period had felt strange to him. Like he wasn&#39;t supposed to be there. And coming home to his parents&#39; house felt equally odd. Like there should be somewhere else he was supposed to be. The exhaustion and stress must be catching up to him, between worrying about college applications, keeping his grades up, and Allison&#39;s near infinite appetite for their study sessions he had been running on full gear for a long time.<br />
<br />
Although he was in the best shape he had ever been in he also felt tired and out of place. He finally got out of his car and walked into the house, heading right up to his room. He dropped his backpack next to his desk and dropped down on his bed with a sigh. He looked up and caught sight of his reflection in his darkened computer screen, then frowned. <br />
<br />
There was something distinctly different about his face. He looked like himself but, different. He grabbed his cellphone and opened up the forward facing camera. He stared at his face on the screen and blinked in surprise. There were fine lines at the corners of his eyes, his cheeks were less round, his jaw a little more  angular, his brows thicker. There was a roughness to his features that wasn&#39;t there before. He looked..<br />
<br />
Older. He still looked good, but there was a maturity to it now. The softness of youth seemed to have melted away through the course of the day, leaving behind a full-grown man. A devilishly handsome and attractive man if he did say so himself, but no teenager.<br />
<br />
Some of the other students were changing, too. He&#39;d have to be blind not to notice it, but sometimes he had to concentrate to see it. Like something wanted him to just accept it, but none of them seemed to be getting older. In fact, there were teachers that seemed to be looking younger by the hour. So why was Kendall the only one going the other way? Or was he? He&#39;d have to pay more attention tomorrow, see if he was the only student looking less like a student. But for some reason the thought of going to school tomorrow felt bizarre. Not going to the building, but to school.<br />
<br />
He lowered his phone and looked around his room. It was a teenager&#39;s room, the one he had grown up in but it felt wrong. His eyes settled on the groundskeeper uniform sitting in heap on the floor and reached over to pick it up. The rough fabric felt good in his hands, solid. He could smell it, too. It smelled like fresh-cut grass and motor grease with some musk and sweat mixed in. It smelled real, it felt real.<br />
<br />
He undressed completely, underwear and all and tossed the clothing aside. He slipped back into the coveralls, feeling the canvas-like fabric right against his skin, rubbing against his cock. He didn&#39;t zip it up, instead laying back on his bed and gripping his monster cock through the rough fabric. The head of his cock rested against his stomach, past where the zipper opened.<br />
<br />
He started jerking off, one hand rubbing his cock with the rough coveralls, his other running along his smoothly waxed chest. He had never waxed it himself, but he knew it was. Knew that when the changes stopped the moment he felt stubble he&#39;d be off to get it removed again. He would be a bit furry without it. Other guys could do what they wanted, he wanted his skin smooth, to feel everything against it and to show off his muscles.<br />
<br />
At first his thoughts were on Allison, imagining the familiar sensation of her mouth on his. He lost himself in the fantasy, letting the daydream take on a life of its own. He imagined Allison was the one stroking him off, her hands on his chest. Then in a moment, jarring and odd it was Coach Mason he was thinking of, strong, sturdy, so sure of himself. He came, grunting as thick globs of his own cum splattered on his chest.<br />
<br />
What was that? Kendall rubbed at his eyes with the heels of his palms trying to work out that odd image of the coach from his brain. Maybe he just needed to rest tonight, his body must have gone through a lot the last couple of days.</p>
