<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">(author&#39;s note: I felt like I should wrap up the Dragon family story before continuing it however it happens.)  <br />
<br />
Tanya was still reeling from the fact that her brother and mother were male dragons now. due to the reality normalization vial, she didn&#39;t see them as monsters just different. glancing back into the living room she saw them fiddling with their powers. Kane the wooden coffee table and wispy smoke left his hands. the small table then changed.  <br />
<br />
its legs grew thicker as roots pierced the floor. thankfully they were on the ground floor of their apartment. the table rose to a height the two could feel more comfortable on as Kane placed his feet on it and watched it change more. Moss now covered its base as the four former legs grew into one trunk.  <br />
<br />
Tanya could even see some mushrooms on her side glowing blue. Chris then waved his hands and the fire from before engulfed the couch leaving Kane unharmed. when they dissipated the couch was now made out of a polished black stone with flecks of gold branching out like nerves in the body. blue cushions now were beneath the eastern dragon as it had grown larger, the couch that is. She looked in the case and found the very vial the others had drank.  <br />
<br />
could she really say goodbye to her female form? she did well in school but she always felt envious of boys for some reason. she thought of how the two gained powers and flight. Apart from Kane acting more manly, they seemed the same. the benefits made her crave the vial in her hands. &#39;if I want to go back there&#39;s probably a vial for that&#39; she thought.  <br />
<br />
looking down she saw there was a return vial that would flush out all changes. the only downside to it was it left through the urinary tract as cum or mammary glands depending on who you were before. shaking off a shiver of disgust she opened the vial and downed it. after putting the vial back in the case she saw it refill instantly. She suddenly moaned loudly as she felt an immense pleasure from her pussy.  <br />
<br />
Chris quickly realized she made her choice so he waved his hand. transparent blue flames covered the doors to the kitchen as well as the blinds on the windows. once they closed blue flames burned away at Tanya&#39;s clothes. at first, she thought Chris did the latter but these flames were a deeper blue than his. looking down her pussy was now a thin slit almost unseen by the human eye.  <br />
<br />
touching it caused something to grow out. it had a purple knot and a pink shaft with a pointed tip. given she drank the dragon vial like the others she knew what this was. her... no his cock was now pulsating beneath his hands. while it was the smallest of the three it was still above average.  <br />
<br />
inside Tanya&#39;s body, her ovaries turned into large testicles. never had he felt the need to cum before until now. As he pumped his cock it sent waves throughout his body. muscles grew as did his height. his breast reseeded as the second set of changes began. light blue scales caused his pubic hair to fall out as it spread up the center of his front. purple scales grew over the rest of his torso.  <br />
<br />
By now any trace of her previous form was replaced with its male equivalent. even that would not last as the scales finish covering his torso. red scales grew across his pecs in a thick half-diamond with three points up. As this was happening the scales spread down his limbs. the inner arms and legs gained the same light blue scales.  <br />
<br />
once it reached his hands and feet blue claws. he was barely able to hear a stool fall over from his new tail. glancing back for a moment he saw it was similar to his other limbs with a light blue underside. he found himself cuming during these changes causing it to paint the walls. two wings similar to his brothers were forming on his back.    <br />
<br />
the spikes were blue as was the membrane. the only thing untouched was his head but that would soon change as light blue scales spread from his neck to his chin. a short narrow muzzle grew with the upper part dipping down in jagged points near the front and base. his once medium hair fell out before burning in blue fire. the once-rounded back of his head became covered in purple spikes as his ears moved to the top.   <br />
<br />
the ears now looked like long purple spikes with three tiny red spikes at the base of each ear. three blue spikes grew from between these two giving him a bony mohawk. opening his eyes revealed red in place of their whites. with yellow-silted eyes Tyler grinned as he cumed again. he took note ha had to be 7&#39;4&quot; which made him the shortest of the three. this did not bother him at the moment.  <br />
<br />
he then decided to try and use his power. the cum he let out was covered in blue flames. once it was done a round ball was in its place. picking it up revealed it was still cum but now in ball form. &#39;if I was still female I would...&#39; At that moment his body was covered in blue flames.  <br />
<br />
he still held the ball but in a human hand. going to the drawer he pulled out a spoon. the reflection in it was his old body. he was now a dragon of form. he opened the door to show them. &quot;did you take it?&quot; Kane said. if she was a dragon of form she would&#39;ve been dressed but she was naked. Chris covered his line of sight with his hands.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Tanya, please. I&#39;m still your brother&quot; he explained gaining a familiar chuckle. said chuckle became deeper as blue flames covered his form. &quot;and I am Tyler dragon of Form&quot; Tyler said now in his true form. he then waved his hand and blue flames appeared on Chris&#39;s chest. once they left two gigantic breasts pushed his clothes apart.  <br />
<br />
&quot;dude not cool,&quot; he changed his clothes to refit him after Tyler removed them. they then experimented with their new powers. after drinking the reality normalization vial of course. turns out any change Tyler did on others changed by the vials was temporary. as evidenced when Kane&#39;s tongue turned back from being a cobra with a mind of its own.  <br />
<br />
however, when used on himself or other organic beings it could be permanent until he said otherwise. After a few changes, they now had a chandelier and a large expensive TV from Chris. the wooden floorboards were now replaced with dirt and grass. &quot;well now what should we do with it?&quot; Tyler said now in a well-tailored suit courtesy of his brother. Chris pondered this as he went over their options.  <br />
<br />
the reality normalization allows them to go out as they are and no one will be bothered by it. they could use the vials on themselves more or spread this to the still-human people outside their apartment. they could split up and handle different things. they could hit the town. There were so many possibilities. Chris decided and said, &quot;Well we will...&quot;</p>
