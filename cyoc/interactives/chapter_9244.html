<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff thought he saw everything better now in the dark, and the path that usually was very hard to pass, was much easier, and he ran like the wind around the bushes. The smells itches in his nose, the smell of tree was now even more distinct, he could hear squirrels climbing the trees. He held the CD close to his massive body, and hoped that he wouldn't be seen by anyone. He had heard music coming from his stereo in Sean's room when he tried to talk to him on the phone, so it must have gone a fuse or something at his home, he thought. Sean was his only chance right now, he couldn't sneak in to his room and change back, it was too risky. Sean had at least his room in the basement where he could slink in through the garage door without being seen, or at least he hoped that it would work. His tail swished around and he didn't trip once when he came out of the small forest, and he saw Sean's lawn and backside of his house coming into view. The house was very new, and he could smell painting that itches in his nose as he ran to the garage door and crouched with his CD in a tight grip. He put one paw under the gate and lifted it up, and closed it carefully after avoiding all the tools lying around on the floor. He walked along the car and was at the iron door where Sean's room was. &quot;Sean-&quot; His voice was back to 'normal' again! How was he going to get to his attention without scaring the life out of him? And explain it too? Jeff glided along the wall and sat down, and laid the CD to his right. Sean had a laptop in his room, which he could use, but how to explain it...Jeff scratched his back and began to think. The stereo in his room stopped without Jeff noticing it, and like the time his mother stepped into his room, Sean was standing in the doorway, looking at the furry creature sitting beside his door with razor sharp claws and teeth. Sean reacted just after a while, and fell backwards while holding his hand on the handle, and spun around with his face on the ground. &quot;Holy shit!&quot;, Sean said as he tried to stand up again. He was up again after a short second and ran to the backside of the car while holding one hand on the car and looking at Jeff with a petrified expression. &quot;Whoa whoa, Sean, I never got-&quot; Jeff swallowed hard and raised up on his two hind legs. Sean backed against the wall, fondling for something to throw at him. &quot;This can't be real...What-what do you want?&quot; Jeff looked a little loosened, at least he didn't scream. It was always a start. &quot;Sean. Weird things happen, doesn't it? Well...&quot; Jeff took a brief pause, and opened his mouth to speak. Oh, and wasn't Jeff shocked. Sean screamed. He screamed high, and Jeff just ran to him and grabbed him with his massive arms and made a run for his room. With a toss Sean tumbled on the floor and stopped at his sofa by the desk where the computer stood. Just as he closed the door behind him he heard his mom's high pitched scream for Sean. Sean looked up again and rubbed his head, while doing so, and then stood up again after the quick pause in his head. &quot;Don't shout again!&quot; Sean was scared of the growling voice and fell backwards in the sofa and looked at Jeff with a stone solid face, that was beginning to whiten. &quot;Ah...how am I supposed to tell this then...okay. Just look at this for a while,&quot; Jeff threw the CD to Sean and he just stood there petrified and didn't look at it at all, he just followed Jeff as he walked around in the room. &quot;It is a 'Chronivac' transformation CD, I'm Jeff,&quot; and Sean said with a low voice, like he didn't want to be there at all, &quot;Hi...Jeff...&quot; Jeff sighed so his rib cage expanded a lot, and he leaned forward and looked at Sean with his animal face. &quot;You don't get it, right? I-am-Jeff. This program on the CD changes the user to whatever he wish too. I need you computer to change back again, mine is out of power since the a fuse must have gone or something. I am Jeff. Okay?&quot; Sean nodded slowly and started to get a nervous smile on his face. He laughed nervously and pointed at Jeff's face. &quot;You are...Jeff? Was it you who talked to me earlier you say?&quot; Jeff pushed himself from the sofa and looked at Sean again with a slight smile, on a very weird canine way. &quot;Yup&quot; Sean adjusted himself in the sofa and pointed at him again. &quot;But...why do you sound like this now? I-I don't get it really&quot; Jeff just pointed at the CD with his sharp claw, &quot;Just push in the CD in the laptop, okay? I can explain later when I am back to normal.&quot; Sean never argued after that. He took a nervous step from the sofa and sat himself in the chair in front of the laptop and inserted the CD in the driver. It spun around for a while then the 'Chronivac' window appeared. He pushed further to install it, and was silent the whole time during the installation. Jeff was standing up, it wasn't comfortable to sit, he couldn't take his tail anywhere it didn't hurt, but he felt happy that he had persuaded him quite easy without any involvement from his parents. Sean started a nervous whistling, and looked at the reflection on the screen at Jeff. He was enormous, his head was almost touching the ceiling and the fur surely looked like real fur. And the paws was huge and long sharp claws on it. Sean felt a chill down his spine while he thought about what he could do with them. 'Pling'. The computer was ready installing, and Jeff leaned over Sean's chair, he slide a little bit further down as he did so. &quot;Good, okay, just launch the program and I'll explain how to do.&quot; Sean took a finger and touched Jeff's fur, and said, &quot;Can you back off? I can't sit properly...ehm...'Jeff'.&quot; Jeff who was wagging his tail without even knowing it, backed off again. After a short explanation from Jeff, he started the program and Sean saw everything. He explained the packages and how he did and why he needed to have his computer at the first place. Sean, who was gaining more and more confidence in him, was beginning to see the opportunities. &quot;How does it feel?&quot;, Sean said, changing the subject completely. Jeff looked at him with a astonished expression. &quot;You know, it feels very, very odd, but what would you expect for a total species change? But...well...I feel much more powerful, and you really hear and smell a lot better than before too. I don't even have bad seeing anymore!And you should try having fur, it feels better than you may think&quot; Sean looked at the same site as he gotten into, and Sean laughed a little. &quot;This is so weird...'Need some milk? Make your own!'...so fucking weird...'The Cow Association'...this thing is already a hit I can see if they make things like 'Cow Associations&quot; Jeff laughed a little too, and then something popped up in his mind. His original stats of his own body was at home! He couldn't change back! And if the computer just shut down like that...it may not have saved it either...&quot;Sean! I can't change back! We need to get to my computer!&quot; Sean who was looking at all the furry packages looked up at him. He looked at the startled wolf morph going around in his room baring his fangs as he talked quickly. &quot;Why?&quot;, Sean said. Jeff looked at him again, and looked really afraid. &quot;The stats that it had on me scanned in is at my home, and I need that fucking device too. Oh, I feel so stupid right now...how could I have forgotten that...&quot; Sean looked at him, and then the clock on the wall over the sofa.&quot;I go get the device, just where is it?&quot; Jeff looks at him with eyes wide open.&quot; Well, it is on my computer, a little box with some buttons, and a 'Chronivac' title on it. Are you going to my house?&quot; Sean nodded, and smiled. &quot;We can at least hide it from your sister, and to be honest, I really want to try this one myself! And I don't think it will be a problem, I have sneaked up to your room before, remember?&quot; Jeff with his ears against his head and tail between his legs, looked really puny, in a kind of way Sean thought. &quot;I hope you remember the last time, when you tried to climb the roof and mom saw you and tried to throw bottles at you while you ran away? You were damn lucky even to get out of there without being seen by her. I don't call that a 'succesful night raid'.&quot; Sean stood up and walked to the door (he already had his shoes on when he tried to walk out when he met Jeff). Sean showed total denial to what Jeff just said. &quot;Well, at least you are safe comparing to me, how can I ever change back?&quot; Sean opened the door, and stood in the doorway looking at him. &quot;I think the program already have saved your stats, don't you think they have thought about that when they did the program? If you look in the bottom right corner of the program it has a little 'save' bar that saves all the time. Your stats are still there on your computer.&quot; Sean walked out leaving Jeff, the wolf morph in his room, and Sean ran as fast as he could to Jeff's house, eager to try the program out. Jeff fell back on the sofa with his heavy body so something in the sofa cracked to his weight, but he didn't care, he felt so relieved. Jeff started to touch his fur a little while he sat there, and then sighed while he laid his arms lazily to his sides. Maybe he should wait or something, he had the stats saved, and he could change back. Why shouldn't he have some fun? And with Sean too...he saw all the possibilities open up in front of his thoughts, and he smiled, a very happy wolfish smile. But what where Sean doing right now? And what should happen next?</p>
