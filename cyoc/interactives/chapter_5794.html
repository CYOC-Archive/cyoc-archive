<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As the cops loaded the two offending ex-males into their squad car, we walked up the steps to Eddie's door.  Amanda was about to ring the doorbell when I grabbed her arm before she could.<br />
<br />
&quot;What's wrong?&quot; she asked with a worried look on her face.<br />
<br />
I warned, &quot;He's going to think there's something wrong, because the Amanda and Melanie he knows don't look like this,&quot; motioning over their new bodies.  &quot;So let me fix it.  I wish that everyone except the three of us, Cara, and Katie would remember that Amanda always looked the way she does now.  I wish that--&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait!&quot; Melanie interrupted.  &quot;Since you're doing this for me, can I make a suggestion?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure,&quot; I said.  &quot;What do you have in mind?&quot; I asked her, still unsure of what she might have concocted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why don't you make it so he won't recognize me until either of you tell him?&quot; she suggested.  &quot;That way we can really surprise him.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oooh, I like that idea,&quot; Amanda cooed in my ear, while she ran her hands over my groin.  With that kind of encouragement, I had to grant Melanie's request.<br />
<br />
I inhaled deeply to get the wish out in one breath.  &quot;OK, I wish that everyone besides us, Cara, Katie, and Eddie would remember that Melanie always looked the way she does now.  I wish that Eddie would not know that Melanie is Melanie until either Amanda or I tell him so.&quot;  I waited for a second.  Then I said, &quot;OK, hon, ring the doorbell.&quot;<br />
<br />
Amanda rang the doorbell and we waited for Eddie's arrival at the front door.  A minute passed and no one had answered.  &quot;This is weird,&quot; I said.  &quot;He never goes anywhere after school.&quot;  Amanda rang the doorbell again, and still we waited.  Randomly thinking, I wished I knew what he was doing.<br />
<br />
If I knew what that was going to do, I wouldn't have made the wish.  All of a sudden an image appeared in my mind.  It was Eddie sitting in his bathroom.  He was masterbating!  From what I could tell, he was trying to finish quickly.  I also noticed that he seemed to be looking at some yearbook pictures.  I saw Melanie's old picture sitting there.  At the very least, that confirmed he had a serious crush on her.  <br />
<br />
I developed another thought seeing this image.  What if Melanie wanted to try out her new body with Eddie?  It wouldn't be any good if he had already shot his load.  So I wished he would stop immediately and come answer the door.  The image ceased to exist in my mind, and I was forced to wait and see if he would come to the door.  About 10 seconds later, the door swung open and Eddie appeared.<br />
<br />
&quot;Eddie!&quot; I greeted him.  &quot;What kept you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Preoccupied with the two beauties in front of him, though he knew Amanda was Amanda, he said, &quot;I was busy.  Sorry.&quot;<br />
<br />
Amanda said to him in a sultry tone, &quot;Are you going to invite us in?&quot;<br />
<br />
He snapped out of his trance and said, &quot;Yea, yea.  Sorry.  Come on in.&quot;  I could tell that his gaze had been transfixed on Melanie the whole time.  I knew he had the hots for Amanda, too, but he wouldn't really look at her because of my relationship with her.  Eddie was the kind of friend who wouldn't screw around with your girlfriend, except on a friendly basis.<br />
<br />
We walked into his living room.  It was a bit of a mess.  Obviously he hadn't been expecting any visitors.  &quot;Sorry about the mess,&quot; he said.  &quot;I was just starting to straighten up.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We caught you off guard,&quot; I said, &quot;No big deal.&quot;<br />
<br />
Eddie briefly smiled, but said, &quot;Yea, but still.  I'm trying to keep things in order.&quot;  He gathered some magazines that were on the couch and placed them in a pile on the coffee table.  He sat down, while I sat down next to him with Amanda clinging tightly to me.  Even though there was still room on the couch, Melanie sat in an old, worn-down, easy chair.  I presumed this was so Eddie would have a better look at her.<br />
<br />
She was smart in doing so, because Eddie's eyes never drifted from her frame.  I imagined he was thinking in his mind what it would be like to see her naked, and probably even more than that.  Remembering that I saw an image of what he was doing, I wanted to see if I could read his thoughts.  I wished I knew what he was thinking about Melanie.  Another image popped into my head immediately.  I could see Eddie kissing Melanie, caressing her body.  She stripped him out of his clothes while he did the same.  Then they had sex on what looked like the floor of his living room.<br />
<br />
I decided to move along quickly.  &quot;Eddie, I was just telling Amanda and her friend here about how you have a crush on Melanie.&quot;<br />
<br />
Eddie's face made it look like he was going to explode.  &quot;Joe!,&quot; he seethed, &quot;You said you weren't going to tell anyone!&quot;<br />
<br />
I reassured him, &quot;Amanda knew as much anyway.  She just wanted to hear you say it.&quot;  I looked back at her and asked, &quot;Is that an admission to you?&quot;<br />
<br />
She nodded smugly, saying, &quot;I would think so.&quot;<br />
<br />
Still upset Eddie blurted, &quot;Fine.  Happy now?  What does this have to do with anything?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well when we told Melanie, she didn't believe us,&quot; I casually remarked.  <br />
<br />
&quot;What?!&quot; he exploded out of his seat.  &quot;You promised you wouldn't tell her!&quot;<br />
<br />
I grabbed his arm and commanded, &quot;Sit down and calm down, you overreactive pain in the ass.&quot;  He did as I forced.  &quot;Jeez, you take everything the wrong way.  Anyway, as I was saying.&quot;  I noticed that because I had angered him, his attention had finally drifted from Melanie.  I continued, &quot;Melanie said she wouldn't believe us until she heard you say it.&quot;<br />
<br />
The look of anger didn't evaporate from his face.  &quot;I don't see what good admitting my crush on Melanie is going to do when she's not here!&quot; he asserted.  &quot;So if you could ever convince her to come over, I'd be glad to tell her that I like her.&quot;<br />
<br />
I grinned widely and said, &quot;Say 'hi', Mel.&quot;<br />
<br />
Eddie's anger melted into confusion.  &quot;Huh?&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
Melanie spoke for the first time since entering the house.  &quot;Hi, Eddie,&quot; she said, doing her best imitation of Jessica Rabbit.</p>
