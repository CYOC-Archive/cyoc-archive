<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;T-Terry, I think I got turned into y-your husband!&quot; As soon as the words came out of Jake’s mouth the two men stared at each other in silence. “Jake, whatever we do next we have to be careful,” said Terry. “There has to be a way to get ourselves out of this predicament.”<br />
<br />
Jake’s pecs, massive and muscular, heaved up and down as he breathed heavily. His eyes turned to the camera resting on the table. Slowly and with a quavering voice he said, “Terry, I think that since it was the camera caused these changes that we have to use it again and hope that it can help.” With that, he being to shake and tears began to roll down his now older face.<br />
<br />
Terry rushed forward and gave his friend a bear hug. “Don’t worry, Jake,” said Terry. “I’m here for you, and after all I was the scared one after you took my picture... while you were thrilled with it!” Jake smiled, wiping away his tears with the back of his hand, now hairy and thick. “You’re right, Terry,” he said. “I’ve got an idea.”<br />
<br />
Jake then outlined his plan about how to best use the camera. He had a hunch that the camera tapped into the subconscious of each person and reflected their desires or wishes in the image that it produced. Carrying that logic forward, he explained that if an individual concentrated on a thought or wish that the camera might use that as the basis for what the resulting photograph looked like. “So you see, Terry,” rumbled Jake in his new lower voice, “If we focus on what we want the camera to see then it just might make that a reality.”<br />
<br />
Terry sighed. “I think that’s a good a hypothesis as any, Jake. Let’s give it a try. Let’s take a photo together and try to sort things out.” Terry grabbed the camera and he and Jake walked over to a full-length mirror. “Alright Jake. I think the best thing to focus on would be that everything went back to normal.” Jake smiled and said, “Yeah, getting back to normal wouldn’t be bad. If we have the same idea in mind the camera might be more likely to pick it up.”<br />
<br />
The two men took a long look at each other. “Alright, Jake, smile and say ‘cheese!’” joked Terry. He raised the camera and positioned it so that he and Jake were in the viewfinder. “Here goes nothing. Ready, set, go!” Both men grinned and Jake shouted out, “Cheese!” Both of them focused on the thought, “Make everything normal, make everything normal, make everything normal,” repeating the words in their minds. The shutter clicked, the camera flashed, and out came the photo. <br />
<br />
At first glance, the image didn’t seem to be much different. Jake and Terry still appeared much as they already did. “Hey, maybe it’s broken!” wailed Jake. “I’m not so sure,” said Terry, “but this photo certainly isn’t as much of a shocker as the first two.” Just as he said that, Jake gasped. Looking in the mirror, he watched as he butt swelled, inflating outward and upward to the dimensions of a truly impressive booty. At the same time, he felt a tingling in his crotch, as though he was losing something in front while he gained behind. Terry’s jaw dropped as he saw by contrast his underwear strain under what seemed to be a penis that was growing both in length and girth. The two men stared at each other and noticed that their viewpoint was changing. Jake lost a few inches of height and was now more or less eye level with Terry’s pecs.<br />
<br />
“What, what happened?” breathed Terry. “I don’t know,” said Jake, “but I need you to protect me.” He grabbed Terry and buried his face in the now-taller man’s chest. “I just feel so much safer like this.” Terry kissed Jake’s forehead and reached around to explore his friend’s body. “Nice ass,” said Terry as he slapped Jake’s cheeks and cupped them in his big hands. “Oh, that feels so good,” said Jake. “I feel like I’d do whatever you want. But how is this getting back to normal?” <br />
<br />
“I don’t know,” said Terry, “but let’s see what the camera had in mind.” He took Jake by the shoulders and turned him around, lowering his underwear. Amazed at the size of his penis, which was truly impressive, he run it up and down Jake’s ass through his trousers. Jake lost no time in unbuckling his tuxedo pants and bending slightly forward. “Yeah, daddy, show me that dick,” he breathed. Terry replied, “What do you mean, daddy? I’m not your father.” <br />
<br />
Jake responded by pulling Terry in close. Terry’s cock immediately entered Jake’s ass, all in one go. Jake cried out and Terry began to slowly push, in and out, all of his thick long dick. “Jake, this is incredible. It almost feels like you were lubed up and ready to go.”  Jake turned his head and kissed Terry on the mouth. “I know, I think my ass was made for your cock and might be ready for you to fuck it at any time. You know that your boy needs that, right?”<br />
<br />
Terry knew, somewhere in his mind, that something wasn’t quite right. He was, however, overtaken by desire and continued to screw Jake’s ass, bending him over and increasing the tempo and force of his thrusts, his huge balls slapping against Jake’s perfect posterior. Jake squeezed his glutes, eager to take Terry’s load for the first time. Terry began to sweat, noticing that Jake’s self-lubricating ass smelled slightly of strawberries. He could no longer hold back and cried out as he came, pumping jets of cum into Jake’s ass. The quantity was so much that it began to leak out and Jake’s stomach swelled slightly from the pressure and amount of spunk deposited inside of him. <br />
<br />
Terry turned Jake around and kissed him deeply. “What the hell happened?” he asked. “It seems like the camera didn’t understand at all that we wanted things to go back to normal.” Jake stopped for a moment, gasping for breath while looking with love at Terry. <br />
<br />
“But you see, Terry, that’s just it. The camera took our wish and made it real. This is now our new normal. What do we do next?”</p>
