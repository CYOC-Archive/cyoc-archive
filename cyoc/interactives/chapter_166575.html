<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">With that shout balloons floated down from the ceiling. There were quite a lot, but it took a little for them to get into reach. &quot;Hey guide! You forget to tell us how many we need to win!&quot; Fred reminded their weird companion. &quot;Ah, yes yes. You need 10 of the little spheres. Good job for noticing. I&#39;ll be giving you a special reward for that at the end.&quot; he chuckled to himself again after explaining their win condition.<br />
<br />
By then the first balloons came into reach and Marcia set out to get her first points. She grabed 2 balloons pressing them against each other while digging in her fingernails. Immediately she was rewarded with 2 white spheres falling to the ground. She quickly bend down and hit her bracelet against both of them. Two bell sounds rang out from the far side of the hall where a scoreboard appeared. It had Marcias red color on top with a 2 next to it, below that were the others with 0 each. &quot;Booyah! This is easy with my luck and nails!&quot; she shouted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Or you could be smart about it.&quot; remarked Fred confidently while carefully picking out 2 balloons on his own. &quot;This one&quot; he said &quot;and this one&quot; while picking out two specific balloons. &quot;Ah! Some are see-through so you can easily spot the spheres!&quot; Abel realized Fred&#39;s plan who already went about popping his bounty. To his surprise neither of the ones he picked out had a white sphere in them. Instead they had black ones that quickly floated towards his bracelet.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wh-what?!&quot; he exclaimed while his stomach which used to have a slight pouch to it shrank backwards. If you had to guess he easily lost 10kg from that. Not all of that was lost, because some of it appeared on other parts of his body. Mostly on his chest, thighs and butt adding some feminine roundness to his already petite build. His hair had already grown ever so slightly, while the few stubbles on his face he had grown through hard work vanished without a trace. &quot;Dude, you&#39;re turning girly!&quot; Simon declared when he looked at his friend. &quot;No shit! The bad ones can somehow change you. Well something magic was to be expected.&quot; Fred answered while his hands proceeded to roam around his body, the shirt and pants having changed with his body, staying form fitting. His pants nicely accentuated his derriere.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile Simon had three balloons lined up for stomping, going by the same logic of taking the ones with spheres visible inside. With 3 delightful pops they turned out to be 1 white and 2 blacks. He dreaded seeing the dark ones floating towards his arm, reaching it even quicker because he had to bend down for the white. As a bell rang out for him he already heard another 2 bells. A look at the board confirmed the other ones were for Abel. He had gotten lucky somehow and gotten off unscathed.<br />
<br />
When Simon raised his body again he was confused because he didn&#39;t reach up as much as before. He had shrunk, and not just a bit. He had easily lost 15cm in height, putting him at the same level as Fred. He hadn&#39;t just lost in height though, because he also lost most of the hairs on his arms and face. Unlike Fred though, he didn&#39;t seem to be putting on any feminine curves. &quot;I got tiny!&quot; he shouted while he checked his pants &quot;Not much lost here thankfully. How about you Fred?&quot;. Only this exchange prompted Fred to check his own privates. &quot;No comment.&quot; he replied drily, obviously not happy when he saw that he has lost quite a bit length wise.<br />
<br />
While the two were busy checking themselves out Marcia had already gotten to another 3 balloons. She didn&#39;t go for the same strategy of picking out the translucent ones, instead hitting her sharp nails against any she could reach. A bell soon rang out when she caught one of the white spheres while still in the air. Of the remaining 2 balloons one revealed a black sphere while the other materialized a blue liquid where it had been. It drenched her in a slick goo that clung to her clothes and she tried wiping it off to no avail while her first change manifested itself on her head. Her blonde hair changed color turning into the same red as her outfit, though becoming a far more natural shade. It took a while for her to notice because the slime made her feel extremely uncomfortable. It had soaked through and the area around her chest and crotch began heating up where it touched. The slime was making her feeled aroused.<br />
<br />
Fred had decided he needed to up his pace and struck out. Thankfully his newfound femininity had granted him a boon. His new nails allowed him to shred a whole 5 balloons. 3 of them even contained white spheres he collected with haste, not even caring while the styrofoam in one of them covered his body and the black ball sucked into his bracelet. He got lighter once again, though this time it wasn&#39;t fat, but muscle tone. His already slender arms became even slimmer and now looked quite frail. Fred barely noticed though, because the white plastic pebbles began their work. Far underestimating their potential his whole body now tingled with static charge. He was paralyzed for a bit before he could move again, feeling thousands of tiny electric hands crawling over all of his body and caressing his most intimate places.<br />
<br />
While the others were occupied with their misfortunes Abel had lined up a bunch a translucent balloons for himself. He stomped on the 6 of them one by one. In total he had gotten 3 whites and two blacks, the last one just popped seemingly revealing nothing. Now fearing what the black is going to do to him he looked down at his body. &quot;Dang, I had to get hit eventually&quot; he said, while he watched his chest push out. His body gained a lot more fatty tissue than Fred, who had gotten mostly androgynous due to the combined weight loss. Abel on the other hand had a synergistic weight gain that caused his breasts to reach forward into large-for-a-man A-Cups, a very plump butt and quite thick size. It seems as if the feminization effect had concentrated the weight gain in all the right places. &quot;Hahaha, I just had to turn girly too, didn&#39;t I?&quot; he laughed uncharacteristically. &quot;Th-this isn&#39;t fu-hu-hunny&quot; he giggled. The last balloon finally showing it&#39;s effect as Abel was overcome with a laughing fit making him bend over.<br />
<br />
Simon finally having gotten used to his drastic change in stature had managed to pop another 4 balloons. To his horror they came out to be 3 blacks and only one 1 white. The bell chimed when he was overcome with his changes. At first he thought he was loosing more height, but it was just some fleeting masculinity. Similar to Fred&#39;s first changes the fat on his body vanished at a rapid pace. He didn&#39;t have much of it in the first place, so the feminine curves he gained offset it quite neatly. His chest remained mostly flat, but his shoulders had rounded down a lot, his face taking on a far cuter frame. While he could not check everywhere, after checking on his now merely average Johnson, he was certain that he had lost a lot of body hair. At the same time the bit of pubes that remained changed shade. While they had been a dark black before they turned into more a light brown. This had the added effect of becoming even less visible against his similarly shaded skin. The same of course happened on his head, but he hardly noticed his very short hair becoming slightly longer and a lighter shade. All the others were naturally too focused on their own problems to help him realize.<br />
<br />
After the first 20 minutes of the game the scores were Abel: 5, Marcia: 3, Fred: 3, Simon: 2</p>
