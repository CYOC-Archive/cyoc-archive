<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mark returned to their Cabana holding two more drinks in hand. This time it was two of the same drink. &quot;I picked!&quot; He said cheerfully, hefting up both hands, each one holding a coconut with the top lopped off and a large straw sticking out of it.<br />
<br />
&quot;And what do those do?&quot; Edwin asked as he eyed them dubiously.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nothing you won&#39;t like.&quot; Mark held out one coconut to Edwin as he took the other and laid down on his lounge chair. The drink was creamy and coconut flavored, with a hint of something in the back Edwin couldn&#39;t place, just a little note of salt, and what he thought was a ton of rum.<br />
<br />
Mark sipped his drink, watching Edwin with that smile that said his friend was up to something. Edwin just tried to ignore it. Soon he found the way he was on his chair to be uncomfortable and had to shift his legs apart. Suddenly worried, Edwin sat up all the way and looked down. His balls, which were already on the big side, were even larger than they were before. &quot;Dude!&quot; It was not a pleased sounding dude either. Where before he had to chicken eggs in his sack, these looked more like a pair of lemons. Not quite twice the size they were, but close.<br />
<br />
Edwin looked over to see Mark hefting his own balls. Mark had started with a more average sized cock and balls, but was now sporting a pair that were awfully similar in size to what Edwin had before drinking this latest concoction.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fucking a...&quot; Edwin said, falling back. &quot;Clown feet and now clown balls.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mark looked over at his friend. &quot;Oh come on, big feet on a guy is kind of a plus, and think of the loads you&#39;ll shoot with those suckers. Besides... it&#39;s only for the vacation, might as well enjoy it and get a little freaky.&quot; With the coconut drinks gone, Mark was back up on his feet.<br />
<br />
&quot;No.. no more weird drinks.&quot; Edwin said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can&#39;t. Limit two per day, remember? But I can still get us plain old alcohol.&quot; And so they spent a few hours on the beach, taking turns getting drinks from the bar, occasionally flirting with other beach guests. Though Edwin found himself flirting with guys and women, especially the more drunk he got. Even to the point where he reached out and stroked Bruno the bartender&#39;s arm on one visit.<br />
<br />
Once the sun started rolling towards the horizon the pair got dressed to head back into the hotel. They were by then, both completely shitfaced. Even with their bigger bodies able to handle more alcohol, they still had topped their limits. Leaning on each other, they still managed to make it back to the room.<br />
<br />
Stumbling inside, Edwin kicked off his shoes and flopped down on his bed. &quot;Being an adult is great..&quot; He slurred his words a little, but grinned over at Mark. &quot;We should figure out how to stay like this.. I don&#39;t want to wait..&quot;<br />
<br />
Mark sat down on the bed next to Edwin, not on his own bed. He slipped his sandals off and kicked them away. He looked so different to Edwin with the beard and long hair, both in that new fiery red coloration as opposed to his old blond. He closed his eyes, just feeling the buzz of drunkenness mellowing him our.<br />
<br />
Edwin suddenly felt a hand up against his stomach, under his shirt, then up, fingers running through his chest hair. Edwin opened his eyes to see Mark leaning over him, then their mouths met. Edwin couldn&#39;t decide if he wanted to pull away, or pull Mark in closer. The kiss broke after a moment, Mark taking Edwin&#39;s shirt in his hands and pulling it over his head to toss aside. Mark stripped out of his own shirt a second later.<br />
<br />
Edwin&#39;s cock was straining the fabric of his shorts, giving away his excitement, and Mark was only too happy to let it the monster free. His hand gripped around the shaft, stroking it as he leaned down to nibble at one of Edwin&#39;s nipples, nipping it and sucking on it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Holy...&quot; Edwin shivered under the touch. All of the sudden Mark stood up and walked into the bathroom, still a little wobbly from his drink. Edwin stared after his friend, his still rigid cock dripping pre onto his stomach.<br />
<br />
He wondered if Mark was having the dame indecision that was still running through his own mind. They were friends and this was..<br />
<br />
Mark came back out of the bathroom, completely naked, a bottle of something in one hand. Without even saying anything, Mark walked to the foot of the bed and yanked Edwin&#39;s shorts off.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve wanted to do this sine freshman year.. and you&#39;re not stopping me now.&quot; Mark squeezed some of what was in the bottle onto one of his hands, then using that hand began to stroke Edwin&#39;s shaft.<br />
<br />
Edwin was too shocked to respond. His best friend had hidden a crush on him that long? Whatever Mark was rubbing on his cock was cool and slippery. His eyes went wide as he figured out Mark was lubing up his cock. &quot;What.. what are you..&quot; Edwin&#39;s mouth felt like it was stuffed with cotton. He wanted to push Mark off of him, even as Mark climbed on the bed to straddle him.<br />
<br />
Edwin put his hands on Mark&#39;s hips, fully intending to get himself out of this situation, instead, he dripped his friend harder. Mark guided Edwin&#39;s cock to his hole, as as soon as Edwin felt the tip slip past that opening, he let out a small moan.<br />
<br />
Mark, the person who understood him best in the whole world, better than any girlfriend he had. Why shouldn&#39;t they share this, too. Mark had to take his time, lowering himself onto Edwin&#39;s thick cock, wincing but not stopping.<br />
<br />
Edwin shifted one of his hand&#39;s to Mark&#39;s cock as he flt his friend&#39;s recently enhanced balls resting against him. He stroked Mark in time with Mark&#39;s rocking motions on Edwin&#39;s cock. The two lost themselves in the feelings of lust swirling with their drunken haze. Everything turned to heat, their bodies entwining until pleasure wracked both their bodies. Edwin&#39;s hot seed flooded into Mark, as Mark&#39;s splashed across Edwin&#39;s stomach and chest.<br />
<br />
Mark used his finger to scoop up his own cum, tasting the first bit himself, then holding his finger out to Edwin who took it into his mouth without hesitation. Slowly, the two separated, though Mark lay down on the bed next to Edwin, resting his head on his friend&#39;s furry chest.</p>
