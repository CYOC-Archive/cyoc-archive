<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jennifer was still stunned by her own cleverness regarding her handling with the possibilities of the curse. Now whenever she transform-or-dared Kyle, he was unable to use the curse on someone else. Just when Jennifer said ‘curse me’ he was compelled to curse her, and only her, immediately. She would answer ‘dare’ and he could always just dare her to feel blissful and sexy. Then she had the curse again and could freely use it on Kyle, him only being able to answer ‘both’ in this case. After her changes to him he would be waiting until she commanded him to curse her again, not using the curse elsewhere. A lovingly, over powerful loop lasting for all eternity for Jennifer to enjoy, or until she decided different. Perfect.<br />
<br />
After Kyle’s himbofication she first wanted to try out his loyalty, just for fun, before she went on with her still open option to dare him. <br />
<br />
“Kyle, who is more important to you, me or your friends?”<br />
<br />
Without hesitation Kyle’s answer sounded through the phone, spoken out by his new handsome voice “Of course you, Jennifer.”<br />
<br />
“That’s a good boy.” Jennifer giggled, imagining the faces of Kyle’s (former) friends, which not only had watched Kyle’s body and mind turning into a complete himbo; attentive, gentle and kind to every woman, especially Jennifer; but also now heard him say that Jennifer is much more important to him than any other single one of them; his just some minutes ago best friends, which were still sitting in his room.<br />
<br />
“Now to your dare,” actually Jennifer didn’t need it since he would do her bidding anytime even without being dared, but since she got it, she could also use it for things like this, “to come pick me up in an hour and drive me to the mall; we will pass school for today.”<br />
It was settled in Kyle’s mind. In about 40 minutes he would take his dad’s car and drive to his most favorite girl Jennifer.<br />
<br />
“But before I hang up and make myself ready, there is something left to do.- Kyle, curse me.”<br />
<br />
“Transform or dare?”<br />
<br />
“Dare.”<br />
<br />
“I dare you to feel blissful and sexy.”<br />
<br />
An amazing feeling rushed through Jennifer’s body as she closed her eyes for some seconds and let her hand fall onto her neck. Pulsing bliss ran through her spine up and down as she touched her nice D cup breasts in their pink encasement and pushed them together a little bit. Squeezing them while biting softly her bottom lip with her teeth as an erotic sensation made her feel her entire perfection of a body gleaming. About twenty seconds later she opened her eyes again and spoke relaxedly through the phone.<br />
<br />
“Transform or dare?”<br />
<br />
“Both.” Kylie responded obediently.<br />
<br />
“For your transformation I want you to become something like a contagious attentive man. When a friend looks at your body there will be something like a spell transforming them permanently. However they won’t be like you. They will become nerds. Friendly, attentive little nerds that are always ready to assist and pamper every woman around them. Politely they will ask if they can do her homework, carry her bags or do something else to serve her. They will look so nerdy though that, while not being disgusted, no woman on earth would be wanting get intimidate with them or being pleased by them sexually.<br />
The spell will first only affect about twenty of your first friends that looked at you. We don&#39;t want the whole town being nerdy and no one left that is boyfriend material. Yet, whenever any man or guy has seen you in your new form or even just a picture of you, he will be able to become a nerdy boy as well just by a woman saying to them &#39;Please be a simp for me.&#39;<br />
Since there are a lot woman out there who want to be served, also less-attractive ones, in the boy&#39;s minds there will be some priorities on which they decide who to serve if they can’t serve both simultaneously. There will be girls more important than the other ones.<br />
For example Cheerleaders, streamer girls, woman and girls  that work hard for their looks and always keep up with the newest or most stylish fashion. Girls that are so hot that they constantly are being hit on by guys, who just want them because of their body and aren’t nice to them or behaving like a gentleman. These girls have the highest priority to the new nerd boys, and they will only politely and subserviently ask if they could be of any help for her, not bothering these girls at the slightest.”<br />
<br />
When the last word was spoken Kyle’s skin, limbs, hair and clothes alighted for a short moment and then went back to a normal, but appealing sight. The boys in Kyle’s room however had just begun to transform. Glasses grew on the noses of some of them. Their hair got flat and their clothes neatly and well picked from the unmodern section of a man’s clothing store. They were trim but unattractive. Smart but absolutely subservient to any girl that wanted them to obey her. If there were more than one who demanded their attention they would simp for that girl that has it worst; being popular, bearing the burden of always dressing sharp or stylish, or being so good-looking that nearly every macho would unload their dumbest pick-up lines at them; and if the women or girls gave them a chance, would only treat them as objects, as a status symbol or as toy for their pole.<br />
<br />
Maybe these changes were not enough to canonize her, or to become a paragon of fairness and bonhomie, but still Jennifer did something for the people around her to feel better in this world. And in this case both sides would be happy. Either to be pampered and released from duties like homework and chores, or to be the one being helpful, being needed and appreciated; able to spend hours and hours around beautiful girls and even touching them, massaging them and helping them dress into their stylish clothes and sexy underwear or shoes.<br />
<br />
‘Jennifer, a secret hero to make the world a better place, but no one knowing about it, nor who that gorgeous and generous girl is. Isn&#39;t she modest? That doesn’t meant though that she couldn’t enjoy the comfort every now and then of these boys serving her as well. Also girls like her sometimes need a time off from her other admires.’<br />
<br />
Jennifer laughed, just kidding about the excessive self-adulation. But nonetheless. It was just fucking awesome to change some things around her life that always had bothered her. A life that now would become a real dream to come true for her and some other girls as well.</p>
