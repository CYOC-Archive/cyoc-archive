<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Jenny Smith, I dare you never to turn into Jennifer again.  From now on, &quot;Jenny&quot; is your <br />
only personality.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jenny put one hand to her temple as she felt 'Jennifer' compress away to nothingness.  She <br />
felt herself merge with her fundamental personality, the little girl who couldn't deal with <br />
reality...she fell to her knees, somehow keeping hold of the gun.<br />
<br />
&quot;Gah..&quot;<br />
<br />
Kyle smiled.  &quot;Still want to stay a kid?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jenny looked up at him.  &quot;Yeah.  Even now.  So what are you going to do?&quot;<br />
<br />
Kyle thought about it.  &quot;Jenny Smith, for your transformation, you will stay your current <br />
age forever, never aging.  But further, though no one will be able to tell by looking at you, <br />
you'll be four times as strong as an adult.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jenny suddendly realized she could hold the gun effortlessly in one hand.  <br />
&quot;Woah...wicked!&quot;  She got up and hugged the taller girl.  &quot;This is awesome!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;erk...my spine...&quot;  Kyle found she couldn't breathe.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, sorry.&quot;  Jenny giggled.  &quot;I dunno about the whole 'stay a kid forever' thing, but...it's <br />
fine for now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh...well, you seemed pretty sure you didn't want to get older...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What about me?&quot;  Brad whined.<br />
<br />
Jenny turned on Brad.  &quot;Kyle, find something that will fit you better.  I'll deal with Bradley.  <br />
Hey Brad, Transform or Dare?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Transform!&quot;  Brad was quick to answer.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aww, too bad.  Ok Brad.  You are going to stay the way you are forever, never changing, <br />
never aging.  And you're going to forget your old life and personality...you're better off <br />
without them.  You can keep your skills and knowledge, but that's it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You bitch, how could you....&quot;  Brad stopped.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh...miss?  Could you tell me...um...who are you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jenny grinned.  &quot;Me?  I'm Jenny Smith.  We're going to be good friends, aren't we?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh...I guess so...but....um...could you tell me...who am I?&quot;  The girl seemed a little <br />
frightened.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't know, honey, but I promise I'll help you out.  We should take you to see a doctor, <br />
huh?&quot;  Jenny's voice became softer.  The guy she was angry at was gone...no sense taking <br />
it out on an innocent girl.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please do...it's strange, I know things...like how to play football.  Isn't that weird?  I'm not <br />
strong enough for sports..but I know how to play....and I don't know my own name.&quot;  She <br />
seemed near tears, so Jenny curled up on the couch next to her and hugged the other <br />
girl...gently.  She wasn't sure about this new strength of hers, but she didn't want to break <br />
anybody...well, not by accident, at least.<br />
<br />
---------<br />
<br />
Some time later, the girl who used to be Brad Preston was asleep in Jenny's arms.  She was <br />
so innocent like this, like an angel.  Jenny kissed the girl's hair as Kyle came back, wearing <br />
an oversized t-shirt and a pair of old shorts.  &quot;Best I could do...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Took you long enough.  Enjoy yourself?&quot;  Jenny grinned.<br />
<br />
Kyle blushed furiously, and nervously ran her fingers through her hair.  &quot;um...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Kyle, it's ok.  I know you've never had a girl, and you've fantasized about them a lot.  It's <br />
only natural you'd want to test out the new equipment.  So how was it?&quot;<br />
<br />
Kyle sat next to Jenny, opposite Brad (we really need a new name for her, hm?).  &quot;Amazing.  <br />
It felt so good...I didn't want to stop.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's a good girl.  So you think you'll be happy as a girl?  Because...um...I think I overdid <br />
it with Brad.  She doesn't remember a thing about Transform or Dare.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Doesn't she still have the power?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh prolly, but I'd rather she use it on someone else...I don't think any of us has anything <br />
to complain about at the moment.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Other than the fact we don't have a home, or any place to go?&quot;  Kyle looked to Jenny.<br />
<br />
&quot;Eh, I have some money I stole from Father.  We'll be ok.  Going to take &quot;Brad&quot; to a <br />
hospital, they'll help her out.  We still have a job to do.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Victor Hughes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Got it in one.  That's why I needed you to get dressed.  Get anything you need from this <br />
place, we're leaving tonight.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What's the plan?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thought you'd never ask...&quot;<br />
<br />
---------<br />
<br />
Dr. Emily Cross wasn't sure what to think about the strange young girl they'd brought in.  <br />
She was wearing boy's clothing, and apparently had no idea who she was.  Poor thing, <br />
classic amnesia.  No signs that she was assaulted, thank God.  She was still a virgin as <br />
near as they could tell.  But &quot;Jane Doe&quot; was considerably below average height, and <br />
incapable of putting up much of a fight if someone did try to force themselves on her.<br />
<br />
And she was such a meek, innocent girl!  Emily decided to take special care of her, she <br />
needed someone to look after her.  &quot;But where did you come from, I wonder?&quot;<br />
<br />
---------<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, a pair of girls made their way across town.  After breaking into the mall <br />
(something Jenny made look suprisingly easy), both girls were sharply dressed in new <br />
clothing, along with a pair of matching denim backpacks, filled with additional clothes, <br />
and their weapons.  Kyle had taken a short sword and a dagger from his weapons <br />
collection (a hobby Jenny approved of), and Jen still had her father's Colt.<br />
<br />
And now, they were headed for a date with Victor Hughes.  It felt strange for Kyle to wear <br />
girl's clothing.  The panties were quite comfortable and soft, but he felt a little aroused by <br />
it.  A pair of capri cut jeans, and a pink t-shirt that revealed entirely too much skin <br />
completed the ensemble, along with a pair of white tennis shoes and a pink jacket.<br />
<br />
Jenny was wearing a similar outfit, but her baby-t was red and where Kyle's had a logo that <br />
said &quot;Princess&quot; (much to his embarrasment), Jenny's said &quot;Wild Child&quot;.  Further, Jenny had <br />
somehow managed to find a leather trenchcoat in her size, which made it easier for her to <br />
hide the gun.  Even though he was still taller than Jenny (by about 4&quot;, Jenny was now 4' 3&quot; <br />
and his new body was 4' 7&quot; and a half), he found himself following her lead.  She was, by <br />
far, the dominant member of their team, and it wasn't just because of her insane strength.<br />
<br />
Jenny exuded confidence in everything that she did.  Kyle found himself....falling in love <br />
with her.<br />
<br />
&quot;So...Kyle...say, I was thinking.  Think I could get away with calling you Kylie?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Um...that'd be fine, I guess.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jenny smiled at him...well, her.  &quot;Kylie it is.  It's cute, I like it.  Anyways, here's the thing.  <br />
I'm going to break into his apartment, so I need you to be the lookout.  Once I'm in, I'll <br />
unlock the door for you.  If something goes wrong, I need you to warn me, ok?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure thing, Jen.  I won't let you down.&quot;<br />
<br />
Next thing he knew, Jenny was standing tip-toe in front of him, arms around his neck.  &quot;I <br />
knew I could count on you.&quot; she said, breathily.  All Kylie could think about was how sweet <br />
she smelled, when her lips touched his own.<br />
<br />
An electric charge went down Kylie's spine.  Jenny's kiss was soft and full of promise.  And <br />
then she backed way, looking up at him with an odd smile on her face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Never kissed a girl before...I think I like it.  C'mon.&quot;<br />
<br />
All Kylie could do is follow behind, dumbstruck.  She touched her lips with her fingertips <br />
gently.  <br />
<br />
Kylie was definitely in love.</p>
