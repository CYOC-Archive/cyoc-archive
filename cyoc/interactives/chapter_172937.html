<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Vicky led you into another arena, although this one was larger and covered with a corrugated iron roof. On the far wall was a series of large mirrors that pointed back into the centre of the building. You were brought over to this wall of glass before you were tied to a ring that was affixed to the surrounding brickwork.<br />
<br />
Vicky then left briefly, leaving you staring at your own reflection. Seeing your new body clearly for the first time made you want to cry. You could see the sad expression in your eyes as you looked over your inhuman reflection. Seeing the horse in the mirror copying your movements made you despair as you remembered what you had been through over the past few days. You were an animal, and not even a male one at that. You thought about turning to look at what had become of your pride and joy but you ultimately couldn’t bring yourself to do it. Instead you looked at the floor sullenly as you mourned all that you had lost.    <br />
<br />
After a few minutes you were strangely thankful to hear Vicky return. You looked up but were instantly worried when you saw another horse following close behind her. It didn’t take you long to realise that this horse was male, which was a revelation that instantly made you back away.<br />
<br />
As for Vicky, she simply maintained her annoying smile as she studied your reaction. “Don’t worry Princess, Zach here won’t bite. He will be your study buddy for your second lesson on... Equine Anatomy!”<br />
<br />
You neighed nervously as the large dun-coloured male was attached to the wall a few meters away from you. You instantly turned to look away from him, not wanting to give the stallion any hints that you were ripe for mating. Sadly your body didn’t seem to get the message as it instinctively made your pussy moisten in anticipation.<br />
<br />
“Now, now Princess,” Vicky said with a disappointed tone, “that’s no way to greet a lovely horse like Zach. He is still shy and inexperienced like you, so he could do with a good horsey friend.”<br />
<br />
You reluctantly turned to look at Zach. As Vicky had described, the big horse seemed just as hesitant as you were. Certainly he didn’t exude the same confidence as the other stallions that you had seen. In fact, you detected a hint of sadness in his brown eyes, which told you that he was hating his new life just as much as you. <br />
<br />
“Awww why do you two look so glum.” Vicky put her hands on her hips as she looked between you and Zach. “No matter, this particular lesson has proven popular in the past. It is important for horses that have had their gender changed to familiarise themselves with their new sexuality and equipment. Both of you have already done this to a certain extent,” she said as she gave knowing looks to each of you, “but there is nothing like getting up close and personal with the subject matter.”<br />
<br />
You became increasingly disturbed by Vicky’s words. Based on Zach’s disgusted reaction you surmised that he had once been a ‘she,’ hence why you were both having the lesson together.<br />
<br />
“Right, that’s enough boring stuff out of the way. Let’s get started with you Zach.” The stallion backed away as Vicky approached commandingly. “Now, now, remember what I said would happen to your former boyfriend if you misbehaved. It would be a shame to see poor Michelle being sent to the stud farm before she’s ready…”<br />
<br />
You felt bad for Zach upon seeing his shocked reaction. Like you he also had a loved one who was being held at the Stables’ mercy. In response the stallion whinnied sadly before bowing his head and slowly trudging over to Vicky.<br />
<br />
“There we are, good boy Zach.” Vicky stroked the stallion’s mane soothingly before continuing. “Now as you can see, both of you have very similar builds. Zach you are slightly more muscular, but otherwise you differ little from Princess in terms of general biology. Of course the main area in which you differ is your genitalia, which is what we shall be focusing on for this lesson.”<br />
<br />
Both you and Zach exchanged a worried look as you feared what was in store for you.<br />
<br />
Upon seeing your nervous reactions, Vicky once again piped up. “Don’t worry, neither of you are ready for breeding yet. We are very careful to ensure that young colts and fillies like yourselves are one hundred percent ready before they are mated. However, you should both be able to do so by the end of our training programme, and learning about your bodies is the first step on this road. Now pay close attention both of you, this knowledge will serve you well for the rest of your lives.”<br />
<br />
Both you and Zach visibly shook with discomfort at the prospect of breeding with other horses. However, Vicky now ignored your feelings as she swiftly continued with the lesson.<br />
<br />
“Now then, you can see that Zach here is a rather well-endowed young colt.” Vicky made sure you were watching after which she guided Zach into looking at his side-on profile in the wall-mounted mirror. “I’m sure that both of you know what these are for” she said as she crouched down and cupped the colt’s heavy testicles in her hand. Zach grimaced in an effort to control his lust as Vicky stroked the dark wrinkly ballsack and rolled the two orbs around in the palm of her hand. “Of course they are much larger than any human pair of testicles, as I’m sure you can attest Princess, but nevertheless they perform the same basic function.”<br />
<br />
You started to feel sick inside as you stared at the two dark balls. You remembered feeling a similar pair slapping between your legs during your session with Harry. And the sheer amount of jizz they had contained made you shudder. And yet despite your disgust you couldn’t help feeling a familiar warmth rising within your loins again as your equine instincts started to cloud your judgement.<br />
<br />
“As it happens,” Vicky continued, “Zach’s testicles aren’t the only part of his anatomy that is larger than a human’s.” It was obvious what she was talking about, but you were shamefully eager to see it for yourself. There, drooping down from between Zach’s legs, was a large mottled horse cock. The dark shape visibly throbbed as it swung around beneath the young horse. To your disgust you noticed a few drops of fluid spilling from the mushroom-shaped tip, suggesting that Zach’s body was also starting to override his human inhibitions. <br />
<br />
“Normally,” Vicky announced, “this immense organ is housed within a sheath on the horse’s lower abdomen. However, Zach has been kind enough to show us what he’s got. This giant member acts much the same as a human penis, with the main difference being the flaring of the tip just prior to ejaculation. In fact, how would you like to give us a demonstration Zach?”<br />
<br />
With that Vicky began to run her hands up and down the length of the long, thick shaft. Zach did his best to keep his composure, but the building pleasure was clear to see as his balls began to tense up and a look of pleasurable discomfort spread across his face.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile you were in a similar state of barely-restrained lust. Despite wanting to, you didn’t look away as the stallion’s dick gradually began to stiffen under Vicky’s ministrations. Your thoughts returned to Harry as you remembered what it had felt to have a similarly-sized cock ramming into your tight pussy. These thoughts made you feel hot and flustered as your mind continued to wonder. In fact, you were so lost to your body’s animalistic urges that you were powerless to stop your tail from rising and your vulva from beginning to slowly open and close.<br />
<br />
Thankfully Vicky seemed to be too preoccupied with Zach to really notice your loss of control. One of her hands stroked up and down the stallion’s now fully-erect shaft, while the other had returned to massage his aching testicles. <br />
<br />
This continued for a short while before the tip of Zach’s cock began to flare just as Vicky had described. The big horse grunted loudly as his hips jerked forward in response. He then gave a loud whinny of relief as his dick began to erupt. Vicky kept pumping the throbbing organ as long ropes of semen began to shoot onto the sand-covered floor below. <br />
<br />
Seeing such a large volume of creamy horse jizz shooting from the cock’s tip gave you more flashbacks to your session with Harry. You remembered the shameful enjoyment you had experienced as you were filled to the brim with his sticky load. Seeing so much being wasted before your eyes made you feel oddly frustrated as your vagina continued to throb painfully. You knew your body wanted it more than anything, and you were finding it increasingly difficult to argue against it.<br />
<br />
Vicky finally stood back up once Zach had completely blown his load. “Good boy Zach,” she said as she patted the colt’s flank, “now it’s time you learned where you’ll be putting that impressive tool of yours…”</p>
