<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Me?! I&#39;m a fit, healthy, good-looking man.&quot;<br />
&quot;So&#39;s Ty.&quot; Dustin added, to which everyone just laughed. Mark got annoyed.<br />
&quot;That&#39;s not the point! Dustin, how about we go into that video store and let the others go clothes shopping.&quot; Dustin, clearly not happy with Ty getting so much attention, agreed, and he and Mark went to the nearby store, with the agreement they&#39;d meet at the food court in an hour.<br />
&quot;Shall we go get you some new clothes, young man?&quot; June said jovially, taking his muscular arm in hers.<br />
&quot;Yes, mother.&quot; Ty boomed. He had the urge to start flexing and strutting his stuff, and his balls seemed to get even larger and heavier. The shorts, now 4 inches longer and just as tight, didn&#39;t even try to conceal it. Ty could feel his legs rubbing together with the leg hairs that now touched and tangled as he walked, and could even hear the deep rumble of his testicles in the thick sack, as big as oranges and weighing about 10lbs each. They swung in a pronounced fashion with every step, and the weight and tightness was enough to make his cock stir in his shorts again. Ty was so turned on; his muscles, his new body, even the clothes made him more aroused than he&#39;d been in a long time.<br />
June had her arms full with shirts and jeans when Ty, wearing only an almost-transparent pair of orange shorts, approached the till. She handed the shop assistant the items and looked at Ty.<br />
&quot;Do you know how many of these clothes you&#39;ll need, son? It seems like every time I buy you a new shirt, you get taller.&quot;<br />
&quot;I&#39;d say a new pair of these&quot; he pulled at the orange fabric &quot;every few days. As for shirts, I&#39;ll let you know when we run out of shirts, seeing as you&#39;ll need them as well.<br />
The assistant was now bagging his stuff when she caught Ty in her peripheral vision. She was tall and slim, not unattractive, Ty supposed. Her dark hair was cut to frame her face. The only odd feature was her glasses, which were too big for her face, giving her an innocent air.<br />
Ty noticed that the woman was looking him over, her eyes lingering on his muscled form. He also noticed the flush of arousal creeping over her cheeks as she admired the huge, hairy man, her nipples hardened visibly beneath the light dress shirt she wore. Ty felt himself start to rise once more, the growing mass stretching his orange shorts beyond any sense of decency, yet he stood tall and proud in them. Ty stood there for a second and allowed her to stare for a minute longer before he spoke. &quot;I hope I&#39;m not in your way, I&#39;ll be done shortly.&quot; He said with a grin.<br />
&quot;You&#39;re...You&#39;re in my way. I need you to move.&quot;<br />
&quot;What, my body? Are you sure?&quot; he asked as he stretched, flexing his body, showing off his arms, pecs, and even the firmness of his legs, causing her to flush with even more arousal. Suddenly, his orange shorts had an even bigger tent in them than they did a minute ago.<br />
&quot;I... I need you to move please&quot; the shop assistant asked as her face reddened and she tried to move closer to him&#1102;<br />
Ty wishes to grow a little bit more just to impress this woman a bit more. He grew an additional inch taller as well. He now stood at a height of about 6 feet, 6 inches and seemed to be about 400 pounds. The muscles in his arms had increased in size, and so had the muscles on his chest. His legs were wider now. He was a much bigger man than he was before. The only thing that wasn&#39;t bigger was his package, he wished to be more well endowed now too, so he made a wish. His cock quickly started to expand.<br />
It got a little longer... and a little bit thicker...and it got longer, thicker again. It was a very nice looking 12 inch dick... It was good, but far too good for his shorts. With rip sound, the orange shorts were torn in two from the size of the bulging mass that now stood erect under Ty&#39;s pants.<br />
He looked down and noticed how huge his new package looked...<br />
The girl came over to him and tried to put his cock into her mounth with her both hands.<br />
&quot;Please let me do this for you. It would be an honor&quot; she said with an aroused face. She couldn&#39;t quite reach the cock so he had to help her get it to her face. Ty moved the 12-inch dick close enough so she could begin to lick and kiss it. Her tiny mouth wasn&#39;t able to handle Ty&#39;s monster. Ty moved his cock a little bit further into her mouth as the woman attempted to fit it. Her face reddened as the massive rod was now well on the way into her mouth. The 2-inch head was already all the way in the back of her throat and the length was far enough for him to start fucking her throat. The woman had never had a man of such size...she never expected one so big. Ty pushed the remaining few inches in, getting half way.<br />
&quot;Oh.... you are so big, I was  dreaming about it. I wish you were a bigger, but even your size is amazing&quot; she said as Ty moved in and out. He pushed a little more. &quot;I...I&#39;ve never felt such a large cock&quot; she managed to say in a whisper, between breaths.<br />
&quot;Oh baby... how huge should I get?&quot;<br />
&quot;My sis ...&quot; she pulled out his cock to speak and enhaled a bit &quot;... her boyfriend 7&#39;4 NBA player. But your muscles... I&#39;m so hiiiiigh!&quot; She returned <br />
&quot;7&#39;4? I wonder how that feels. You like it big?&quot; he asked her<br />
&quot;Oh yes, yes! I like it bigger and thicker&quot;<br />
Ty&#39;s wish to become a bigger and much more muscular man. The muscles in his chest increased, his biceps swelled, his back broadened and his legs became even bigger, but most of all his dick got much thicker and even longer... His head seemed to push at her mouth, trying to enter, so he had to make room for his expanding organ. &quot;I think... you should put me back into your throat, and take a big breath... I&#39;m gonna grow inside.&quot;<br />
The woman was a bit afraid to take the entire cock.<br />
&quot;Oh shit...&quot; she mumbled and grabbed Ty&#39;s hips with both of her hands, forcing him back inside. She took a breath and pushed her face deep inside his groin, his massive shaft bulging through her neck as it stretched out to be bigger than his own arms. She had no other way to look other than to stare straight up. He was now so massive that he looked like he weighed twice as much. Ty could feel that his penis was much bigger now, it had gotten about 6 inches longer. She was lucky she was still conscious;<br />
&quot;Please say when I&#39;ll be your God, dear&quot; said Ty. With every second his enormous body was getting larger, she could feel the penis expand inside of her, the massive muscles under her fingers pulsing as she squeezed them... Her neck was almost completely full of that massive cock. Ty could feel the thick meat push on the walls of the throat. Ty was feeling even better. &quot;God I hope you like this...I wish my cock was much more thicker and bigger&quot; he said to the woman. She moaned as she felt the meat inside her throat get even larger and thicker...<br />
He wished it more than ever before; he wanted her to be completely satisfied, and for that his penis had to grow.<br />
He made another wish. The muscles on his chest got a bit bigger and more defined, and the ones on his arms as well, making him look like a superhero. He was the hunk she always dreamed of.<br />
When his heas started to push the ceiling, he was a few feet bigger. The woman couldn&#39;t get used to that. Her hands moved away from his body, the weight of his cock in her mouth being to heavy for her arms to keep them there, and she leaned backwards. &quot;Please stop, you are my God&quot; She said in a whisper. The words came out muffled through her filled throat and he barely managed to catch them. He had to push back a little, but it wasn&#39;t that hard because she was on her knees.<br />
Ty was standing straight in front of the woman, he was now about 12 feet tall.  His muscles were bulging everywhere on his body. Ty wasn&#39;t able to see the woman at this point, his hairy pecs were blocking her from his view.</p>
