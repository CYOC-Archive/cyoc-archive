<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The young man/woman was gazing into a mirror watching the people who came across the note he/she created. He/she had decided to study humans to better understand them for he/she was not human. He/she had taken this form that was neither male nor female in order to interact with humans. However he/she quickly found out that interaction was awkward. Maybe it was his/her name. It was too complex for the human tongue so he/she just called him/herself El. Maybe it was El's lack of human knowledge or understanding. Whatever the reason humans would shy away from El and not have anything to do with him/her. So El created the note in order to gain insight into what humans thought about.<br />
<br />
The results were interesting so far. The first person had wished to slowly become a girl. The second wished to become a hermaphrodite over a shorter period with some things happening immediately. The third had taken the note from the second and was punished by being transformed into a girl slowly. El had made sure that the note could look into the someone's mind to grant the wish or select an appropriate punishment. The fourth person wished to be a baby and a boy. The last one was the most interesting of all the wishes so far. El did not know what an STD was but he/she gathered that it was undesirable. The wish also included a major change from the norm from what El could see, flipping the gender people were attracted to around for the majority of people.<br />
<br />
El needed some more specimens before he/she would feel comfortable trying to interact with humans again. Though with the note blowing around outside it might be awhile before it found another human. Thus El turned his/her attention to the second person to make a wish. Viki was going to be an interesting case. El had intended the note to grant one wish at a time though it apparently could do more. This led to something interesting in itself. It appears that while Viki's wish was being fulfilled she was immune to the note's effects. Jared had sought out Viki after class and ask her what was happening to him. After he had explained what the note said she smiled and said &quot;Shouldn't have been so mean then&quot; and walked away. Now El could see that Viki was entering a room with lots of girls taking their clothes off and putting something skin tight on.<br />
<br />
________________________________<br />
<br />
Viki entered the locker room of the pool where they held swim meets and practice. She was a bit occupied thinking about some of the things she noticed during her last class. So occupied that she almost didn't notice Amanda come up and kiss her. After the kiss Amanda asked &quot;Is something wrong Vik?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't know&quot; Viki said. &quot;Have you noticed anything strange during last period?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No&quot; Amanda answered. &quot;Why do you ask?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh nothing&quot; Viki said. &quot;I guess I'm still sore about Jared knocking me down and emptying my purse almost making me late for PE.&quot;<br />
<br />
Amanda looked at Viki with a quizzical look on her face and asked &quot;Who?&quot;<br />
<br />
Viki mentally cursed herself at her slip and said &quot;I meant Gina.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why would you call Gina Jared?&quot; Amanda asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm going to be honest since I love you&quot; Viki said. &quot;Today in Social Studies I found a note in my book. It said that it would grant a wish from me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok&quot; Amanda said in a tone that said she didn't quite believe her. &quot;What did you wish for?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well...&quot; Viki began and hugged herself. &quot;I had wished that I would turn into a hermaphrodite over the next two days and that I would have a hermaphrodite girlfriend. You see, I was a boy named Rick before and I was a closet cross dresser. The note seemed like a dream come true for me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So we haven't been going together before today?&quot; Amanda asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;According to my memories as Rick no&quot; Viki said.<br />
<br />
Looking around Amanda said &quot;We need to get ready for practice. Tell me more as we get changed.&quot; She hurried to her locker ad started to change.<br />
<br />
Viki did the same and continued &quot;With my new memories I know we've been girlfriends for two years now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So it's only the note that is the reason we're girlfriends&quot; Amanda said looking a little down. She must be believing what she was being told.<br />
<br />
&quot;Actually it isn't&quot; Viki said. &quot;I had always liked you because you were a decent person. I had been trying to pluck up the courage to ask you out but I was too shy and I didn't know how you would react to me being a cross dresser.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Did you know I was a hermaphrodite then?&quot; Amanda asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;There were rumors to that effect&quot; Viki said. &quot;Though to be honest I did't care if you had a dick or not. I wanted to go out with you and I was hoping that the rumors were true.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So your love for me is true&quot; Amanda said. After Viki nodded she continued &quot;But how do we know if my love for you is true?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I did not specify who would be my girlfriend&quot; Viki said. &quot;I could have met another hermaphrodite outside of school and fallen in love. I think it doesn't mess with emotions.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So you believe my love for you to be real?&quot; Amanda asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I do&quot; Viki said.<br />
<br />
&quot;So what happened during last period that you found so strange?&quot; Amanda asked as she pulled on her swimsuit.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well everyone's clothes have become more sexual&quot; Viki said. &quot;Also I found myself in a class made up entirely of girls. The girls were looking at Mrs. Barnes like they worshiped her.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course they did&quot; Amanda said. &quot;She's an alpha and a model when she isn't teaching.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know&quot; Viki said. &quot;I also know that almost everyone in school is gay now and that STDs don't exist.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;STDs?&quot; Amanda asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sexually Transmitted Diseases&quot; Viki said. &quot;Disease spread through sex. Some of them could be nasty so I'm thankful that they don't exist anymore.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I'm glad of that since I don't want to give up casual sex&quot; Amanda said.<br />
<br />
&quot;That's another thing&quot; Viki said. &quot;I know it's acceptable for that now but it wasn't before.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Vik, we're committed to each other&quot; Amanda said. &quot;That means that we'll be spending our lives together. We are both driven to have as much sex as we can and those other relationships don't mean what our relationship does.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know&quot; Viki said finally finished getting ready. &quot;It will take me some time to adjust to this new reality.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So how did this new reality come to be?&quot; Amanda asked as they went into the showers.<br />
<br />
&quot;Someone must have made another wish&quot; Viki said turning on the shower and getting wet. &quot;Though the really strange thing is I shouldn't be able to remember what it was like before the wish.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why is that?&quot; Amanda asked turning off her own shower.<br />
<br />
Turning the shower off Viki said &quot;The note said that the only one aware of the changes would be the one who wished it. Since I didn't wish for this I should not be aware that anything that has nothing to do with my wish is different.&quot;<br />
<br />
Amanda shrugged and said &quot;That is a mystery.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You believe me?&quot; Viki asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know when you're joking and when you're serious&quot; Amanda said as they entered the pool proper. &quot;Right now you're really serious so I believe you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Viki embraced Amanda and gave her a long passionate kiss. It was broken by Ms. Jones clearing her throat and saying &quot;You two may be the star athletes on this team but you won't be if you don't practice.&quot;<br />
<br />
Amanda smiled and turned to Ms. Jones saying &quot;Perhaps we need a spanking.&quot;<br />
<br />
Taking her cue Viki also smiled and turning to Ms. Jones said &quot;We've been bad girls. We'll need lots of spankings.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ms. Jones smiled herself and said &quot;You girls asked for it.&quot;<br />
<br />
The other girls looked on in awe as Ms. Jones came over and stripped Amanda and Viki out of their swimsuits. Viki and Amanda smiled as they traced their fingers down Ms. Jones skin tight clothes. &quot;Wouldn't you have more fun spanking us without your clothes on?&quot; Viki asked.<br />
<br />
Ms. Jones smiled and said &quot;Oh I would. Would you two naughty girls help me with that?&quot;<br />
<br />
Viki and Amanda wasted no time in stripping Ms. Jones. Soon all three of them were standing there naked. Ms. Jones sat down on a bench and Viki and Amanda immediately bent over one of her knees each. Ms. Jones smiled as she spanked first Viki then Amanda alternating between them with each swat. It wasn't long before juices began to seep out of Ms. Jones' pussy as well as Amanda's. Viki didn't have a pussy yet but her juices were coming out of her dick. The rest off the girls were playing with themselves and each one reached at least one orgasm before Ms. Jones was finished.<br />
<br />
Ms. Jones smiled and said &quot;I think the girls want to join in.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well perhaps we'll let them spank us if they can beat us in practice&quot; Amanda said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Though they have to do it while we're naked&quot; Viki said smiling.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good idea you naughty girls&quot; Ms. Jones said. &quot;You heard them girls. You get to spank them if you can beat them. Now the first practice will be the fifty meter breast stroke. Take your places.&quot;<br />
<br />
No one was able to beat them since they could not take their eyes off of their naked bodies. All the girls were disappointed at the end of practice. Ms. Jones looked them over and said &quot;Good practice but you need to remain focused on your goal. Now before I let you go I want to remind you that tomorrow's after school practice is canceled for a pool party at my house. I expect to see everyone of you there with no swimsuits. Anyone who shows up with a swimsuit will be expelled from the party. Now go get changed. Oh Viki, Amanda, I'll see you two naughty girls in Modeling class tomorrow.&quot;<br />
<br />
As Viki and Amanda lagged behind the others Viki said &quot;Another thing I have to get used to.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What's that?&quot; Amanda asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;School on Saturday&quot; Viki said sighing.</p>
