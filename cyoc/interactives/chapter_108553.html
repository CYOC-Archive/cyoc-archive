<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;I still can&#39;t believe I let you talk me into this,&quot; Julia Wesley said slowly as she and her husband, Thomas, returned home for the night.<br />
<br />
And a part of her really couldn&#39;t. She wasn&#39;t about to reject her daughter because of her transformation, as she did love Sarah, but a part of her was still a bit uneasy and unsure over things that her only daughter now looked like she was eighteen at the youngest, if not in her twenties, not to mention that she was a voluptuous and muscular dog woman. There was confusion and perplexity at Mary Alice, or Malice as she preferred at least others to call her, calling Julia &quot;mom.&quot; It was a surprise to hear that not only did Mary Alice consider Julia her mother because of the sisterhood bond that Sarah and Mary Alice had, but because of the fact that Mary Alice had little real memory of her biological mother but remembered the Wesley&#39;s taking care of her and being kind to her. It ended with Mary Alice telling Julia that she treated Mary Alice the way a mother should. It raised some surprise, but Julia also had to admit that she was rather touched by it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on dear, you look good,&quot; Thomas said from behind her as he shut the door, &quot;Strong and healthy... soft and kind... caring and...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s why you love me, not how I look,&quot; Julia corrected her husband with a sigh.<br />
<br />
And their marriage was a loving one. Thomas had never cheated on her and had been very attentive to her over the years. The only thing that he&#39;d really hid from her was that he&#39;d been a closet furry and that only came out when he arrived at the Animalia Police Department after she&#39;d called him to tell him what had happened regarding first Mary Alice&#39;s transformation from a pet Siberian Husky into a teenage antro-husky, then her second dose of the Animalia Virus and becoming a mature and muscular husky woman, then the accident that turned their daughter into an equally well built dog woman. That was entirely a surprise to Julia and it was even more surprising to her when her husband asked if there was a way he would be allowed to join Animalia as well.<br />
<br />
Julia had wanted to convince him to stay human, but Thomas had been fully serious and wouldn&#39;t take no for an answer. Julia didn&#39;t think that becoming an Animalian would be grounds for divorce and went along with it, despite the oddness of it. Mostly due to the fact that she knew that she and Thomas did still enjoy each other&#39;s company in a romantic way when they could. If Thomas became a male antro-Husky, that&#39;d mean she&#39;d be exposed to the virus anyway. In that, she had no other real choice but to go along with it and become an anthro-husky, herself. She remembered suckling from one of Sarah&#39;s breasts while Thomas suckled from the other, and remembered that it was an odd situation as she also remembered suckling Sarah when she was a baby. She remembered feeling her body swell with muscle, itch with fur, ache with the lengthening of her feet and the alterations to her skull (her face pushing forward into a canine muzzle) and the lengthening of her spine into a tail, and strangely the almost sexual pleasure of her breasts growing from the respectable B cup that she&#39;d been into the at least D cup that she now was, and a part of her thought she might be even bigger than that now.<br />
<br />
Thomas went through similar changes before the two of them switched from Sarah to get a smaller, but still second, dose from Malice, who was still a bit &quot;empty&quot; after Sarah had drank from her earlier in the day. It left both of them as new fit and healthy anthro-huskies. Thomas carried the same sort of black and white coloration that Sarah and Mary Alice did with strong ice blue eyes while Julia was more of a reddish-brown and white in her fur colors with brown eyes. Both wore some of the new clothing that they&#39;d also had to go through before their transformations.<br />
<br />
Julia heard a chuckle and felt a pair of strong furry arms wrap around her from behind. She looked over shoulder to see Thomas smiling to her in one of the same understanding and loving ways that he&#39;d always seemed to have. The only thing that had changed was the fact that he wasn&#39;t human anymore, neither of them were.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... I could comment that you&#39;ve got marvelous breasts, a great butt, stupendous feminine muscle, and the cutest fur that I&#39;ve ever seen,&quot; Thomas commented, &quot;but I didn&#39;t want to come off as being to sexual... especially when you clearly aren&#39;t that comfortable with this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re right,&quot; Julia answered as she turned to face him, &quot;I&#39;m not fully comfortable with this... but I do love you and am glad that none of this seems to change WHO you are.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I will always be who I am, the loving man who&#39;s always loved you,&quot; Thomas told her, &quot;and I especially love you for being so willing to go through with all this...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s not like I had a choice,&quot; Julia countered, &quot;you were bound and determined. I&#39;d be exposed to the virus anyway...&quot;<br />
<br />
Thomas held her tightly and Julia got a feel of the strong muscles underneath her husband&#39;s shirt and feeling her new and larger breasts compress against his chest. It felt good and it did turn on a part of her mind that did like the strong and muscular form that Thomas had taken when he transformed. She didn&#39;t want to admit that, but she couldn&#39;t fully deny it either, and Thomas&#39;s loving smile and the fact that he held her gently the way he always did did make her feel more willing to listen to him and go along with it.<br />
<br />
&quot;And I thank you for being so loving,&quot; Thomas said to her, &quot;and know that I will always love you and want to make this as good for you as it can be...&quot;<br />
<br />
Julia had some expectation of what Thomas wanted and even understood some of his reasoning. After they&#39;d gotten clothing that would fit all of them, they left Sarah and Mary Alice to have a sleep over with Abby for the night and let Julia and Thomas fully acclimate to all the changes that had happened in their family and with themselves. One part of Julia didn&#39;t want to consider it, but another part felt his warm touch, the soft rubbing of her shoulders and down her sides to her lower back. It was kind and gentle, the way Thomas had always been to her, and it made the part of her was growing attracted to Thomas&#39;s new form much stronger.<br />
<br />
&quot;What we are doesn&#39;t matter,&quot; Thomas said to her, &quot;This is great in letting me fulfill something I never thought would actually be true... but it doesn&#39;t change who either of us are. I love you for who you are, and I&#39;d hope that you love me for WHO I am, not WHAT I am.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I do,&quot; Julia answered, giving a small smile, &quot;and in a way... you&#39;re showing that you are still you...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dashing and buff?&quot; Thomas inquired slightly teasing as he still held Julia to him. He felt a slight stirring in his pants as he looked down to his wife, seeing her smile, not to mention seeing the now impressive valley of her cleavage.<br />
<br />
&quot;The buff part is new,&quot; Julia answered, smelling her husband&#39;s growing arousal and starting to actually feel the erection starting to form in his pants, which generated a response in her own body. It fueled the part of her that did feel strong and sexy and that began to make her feel a bit wet between her legs, &quot;I was going to say kind and caring.&quot;<br />
<br />
The two of them managed soft kiss as they held each other together. It steadily grew in passion as Julia felt her husband&#39;s hands drift down to the front button on her pants. The scent of his arousal was growing stronger and she could easily feel the outline of his erection through both his and her clothing and it was beginning to drive her on.<br />
<br />
&quot;But a good part of me is actually coming to like the new buff you,&quot; Julia managed a chuckle as she reached to pull down Thomas&#39;s pants as he did the same with hers. Doing so ended up removing both their pants and underwear, which fell harmlessly to the floor and Julia could see her husband begin to happily wag his tail. She also clearly noticed the huge erect penis poking out of her husband&#39;s sheath with a canine knot at its base.<br />
<br />
&quot;God that thing is massive,&quot; Julia thought, &quot;He&#39;d... he&#39;d split me in half if I were still... human.&quot;<br />
<br />
Her body grew more aroused and she could feel her nipples poking into the padding of the new bra she was wearing. The part of her that was uneasy with all the things with Animalia was at least for the moment going away. She was so wet, she felt she HAD to get it inside her. They pulled apart so that she could lift up her shirt and expose the bra she was wearing, though she soon undid its hooks and removed it letting her breasts give a short bounce as the bra was removed and dropped to the floor. Thomas removed his shirt as well as the two of them stood naked before each other and catching the scent of arousal from each other.<br />
<br />
&quot;That part of you must really like what she sees,&quot; Thomas smiled to her as he came forward, hugging her again and doing his best to kiss and lick at her muzzle while giving a few small and soft nibbles at the sides of her neck.  With one hand he caressed one of Julia&#39;s breasts, feeling the soft fur and the soft yet firm nature of her bosom, and gave a soft and gentle rubbing with his thumb being in a spot to tweak at her nipples as he massaged them. His other hand drifted further down to rub at her vulva and her clit, to make sure Julia would be fully ready to accept his new penis, which for the moment was still between them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ohhhhhhmmmmmm,&quot; Julia gave a half howling moan at the attention that Thomas was giving to her as they moved from the entryway to the large couch in the Wesley family living room. It felt good and got her own milk flowing a bit and was really beginning to get the part of her that initially might have been curious about Animalia more interested. They slowly moved to the couch and Thomas was very gentle in setting her on it as he continued to shower her with kisses and showing her his love. &quot;Tom... darling... please... I&#39;m... ready.&quot;<br />
<br />
Thomas nodded and moved to position himself over her and slowly beginning to push his erect member into Julia&#39;s wet and waiting folds. Both of them moaned as Thomas thrust his hips forward, but for the moment with his knot not penetrating Julia. Julia reached up, rubbing at his shoulders and holding him to her and to gain enough leverage to thrust her own hips forward to counter his own.  His penis was huge when compared to what it was, but it fit perfectly in her and her whole body seemed alive with pleasure. If this was part of being an anthro-husky, Julia reasoned she might be able to accept this fairly easily.<br />
<br />
&quot;I... love... you... Julia,&quot; Thomas moaned to her and bent down to suckle from Julia&#39;s breasts as he continued to thrust into her.<br />
<br />
The combined attention made Julia give a low howl as her body quivered in orgasm after feeling her husband&#39;s member stretching her vagina and to feel milk flowing from her breast. It felt good and there wasn&#39;t much that she felt she could do to hide that it felt good, and a good part of her didn&#39;t even want to try to hide it.<br />
<br />
&quot;I... love... you... to...&quot; Julia moaned as she felt the pleasure building in her body again, &quot;You... &#39;re... so... good... to... me...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Always will,&quot; Thomas promised her as they continued, &quot;and... thank... you... for... accepting... to change... accepting... my... oooooooooooohhhh...&quot;<br />
<br />
The pleasure was growing greater, and Thomas could now feel that his know was starting to gain acceptance into Julia&#39;s vagina. It hadn&#39;t made full penetration, yet, but it was no longer being stopped outright by it. The growing pleasure drove him on, as he could also feel himself getting close and it cut off his attempt to assure his wife of his love as he felt too good to put anything into exact words. Her returned howling moans of pleasure gave an indicator that she felt the same way. Then, it happened. His knot penetrated her and he felt himself erupt inside her with the greatest orgasm he&#39;d ever felt. Julia came again as well and held him to her, as he might try and pull out.<br />
<br />
He didn&#39;t and he fell over onto Julia&#39;s side to cuddle with her, and with his knot firmly inside her, Julia felt herself being pulled onto her side as well. She only looked to him for a moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;You are amazing,&quot; Thomas said to her after a moment and licked Julia&#39;s nose, &quot;and see... nothing bad in being an Animalian based on that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, it was good,&quot; Julia admitted, &quot;and given how big you&#39;ve gotten... I&#39;d think I could come to like this... a lot.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m glad for that,&quot; Thomas nodded, &quot;And this will only be part of what&#39;ll be good. There will be plenty more...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hopefully,&quot; Julia nodded and tried to pull back but found herself firmly tied to Thomas by his knot. &quot;What the...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ll need to wait a little while for my knot to deflate,&quot; Thomas told her, &quot;in the meantime... there&#39;s nothing wrong with some cuddling.&quot;<br />
<br />
Julia only sighed and snuggled up to her husband. His furry body felt warm and nice, and it was clear that despite both of them becoming Animalians, the love that had always been there was still there, and that was ultimately what made her accept all the changes in the Wesley family.</p>
