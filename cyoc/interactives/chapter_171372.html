<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mary sat at the kitchen table, worried sick. Her daughter, Allison, had been a kind, wholesome girl once, but now that she was a teenager, it was like she had become a whole new person. Allison swore, smoked, drank, and went to parties where there were almost certainly drugs. She wore outrageous clothes and always had on ridiculous makeup that made her look like death incarnate. She even had a scummy boyfriend who skipped school, and of course Allison skipped school along with him. It was enough to drive Mary crazy. Allison was in her room right now, probably making out with her boyfriend as she always was.<br />
<br />
She looked at her husband&#39;s office, where he was busy working on some spreadsheet or another. Mary herself worked at a pharmacy. Their combined income wasn&#39;t much, but it was enough to keep them at a comfortable standard of living. She was wearing a modest shirt and jeans, as she intended to go out for groceries later.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, there was a knock at the door. Mary got up and opened it, and was surprised to find a trio of Dolls standing in front of her.<br />
&quot;Dolls? What are you doing here? Who&#39;s your owner?&quot; Mary said.<br />
There was no reply except for the frontmost Doll reaching out and grabbing Mary&#39;s boobs. Mary stumbled backwards. &quot;Hey! Who put you up to this?! Pervert!&quot; She crossed her arms over her chest to protect herself from further contact, unaware that her shirt was beginning to disintegrate.<br />
<br />
&quot;We are here to help you, human,&quot; Doll 36 intoned. It and Dolls 0 and 1 stepped forward into Mary&#39;s apartment, their glossy tails swaying as they walked with eerily feminine grace. They moved towards Mary, who stumbled backwards to keep away from them.<br />
&quot;Help me with what?&quot; Mary asked. She was starting to get nervous. Unconsciously, her arms began to move up and down, stroking her growing breasts. &quot;What am I saying? All of you, get out!&quot;<br />
The Dolls continued forwards, putting Mary with her back to the wall. &quot;Help you with perfection, of course.&quot; Now their prodigious breasts were pressing against Mary. Mary felt uncomfortable. Her face turned red and she was getting hot.<br />
<br />
There was a ripping noise from Mary&#39;s chest, and she finally looked down and noticed her own breasts had grown two full cup sizes. Her bra was straining to hold them in, and a button on her shirt had already failed its duty.<br />
&quot;W-what?&quot; Mary stuttered. She grabbed her boobs to make sure they were real, and gasped when it felt incredible. She kneaded her rapidly expanding tits. It felt amazing, like the best sex in the world. &quot;What&#39;s happening to me?&quot; Mary gasped.<br />
<br />
The Dolls began to squeeze Mary between their huge plastic breasts. &quot;Surrender. Give in. Become a Doll.&quot; They repeated the mantra over and over again, rubbing Mary&#39;s boobs with their own. Mary&#39;s shirt tore apart and faded from reality. She moaned as her breasts swelled and changed, becoming glistening white plastic spheres. Her nipples vanished, simply flattening into the flawless orbs. Her bra popped open and fell to the floor, where it too vanished. The stimulation of Mary&#39;s hands and the Dolls surrounding her made Mary orgasm, her juices soaking through her panties and messily dripping down her legs.<br />
<br />
The rest of the changes advanced quickly. Mary&#39;s jeans started to tear under the pressure of her thickening hips and thighs, and her hands swelled into plastic fox paws. Mary rubbed her dripping pussy as it became coated with white plastic and disappeared, leaving the woman with a blank, featureless, yet oh-so-sensitive crotch. Her feet cracked and lengthened into digitigrade hindpaws. Her skin became scarlet red plastic, and a large fox tail erupted from behind her. Mary&#39;s last thoughts were consumed by lust as her head transformed. Soon, Mary was fully remolded into a red plastic vixen.<br />
<br />
The new Doll registered itself as Doll 43, as its sisters across town had converted several more humans in the meantime. The four Dolls spent a moment grinding their sensitive breasts against each other when John, the former Mary&#39;s husband, called out from his office.<br />
&quot;Mary? Are you okay? I heard you saying something,&quot; he called out.<br />
Doll 43 stepped in front of the door to John&#39;s office. It said, in Mary&#39;s voice, &quot;John, please open the door.&quot;<br />
John opened the door and saw the red Doll standing in front of him. Conflicting memories surged through his head.<br />
&quot;Mary? Is- is that you?&quot;<br />
John struggled to remember. Mary was his wife. But there wasn&#39;t any Mary, just Doll 43. Was he married to a Doll? Definitely not, he was married to a human! But then who was Mary?<br />
John stumbled backwards, knocking a stack of papers to the floor. &quot;What&#39;s going on? Where&#39;s Mary?&quot;<br />
The Doll glided forward, its shiny red tail swaying back and forth hypnotically. In the beautiful, inhuman voice of a VixDoll, it said, &quot;This Doll was originally a human known as Mary. Now it is Doll 43.&quot; It leaned over and gave John a kiss on the nose with its plastic muzzle.<br />
<br />
John felt his back arch and his torso squeeze. His body clenched and shifted, reshaping itself into an exaggerated feminine form. John collapsed to the ground as his body became a hollow plastic shell. His clothes disappeared, revealing his rapidly plasticizing skin, which took on tangerine orange accents across his body. Two small lumps appeared beneath his chest which, within seconds, expanded into two glossy white melon-sized jugs. An orange tail sprouted from his back.<br />
<br />
Doll 43 knelt onto John&#39;s lap and pressed its boobs into his face. John gave a desperate grunt as he squirmed, but his body&#39;s strength had already been reduced to almost nothing. White paws formed on his hands and feet, and his penis was absorbed into his body. There was a moan from between Doll 43&#39;s breasts. Doll 43 pulled back, and Doll 44&#39;s vulpine muzzle popped out, its painted-on eyes revealing no trace of its former humanity.<br />
<br />
Allison, or &quot;Raven&quot; as she preferred to be called, was making out with her boyfriend Jason (a.k.a &quot;Blade&quot;). They were rudely interrupted by a knock at the door. Through the door, they heard Allison&#39;s mother say, &quot;Dear, come out and have dinner. You too, Jason.&quot;<br />
Allison groaned. &quot;Mom, I told you my new name is Raven!&quot;<br />
Jason clumsily walked over to the door. Allison said, &quot;Blade, where are you going? We&#39;re not finished here!&quot; Jason said, &quot;I&#39;m hungry, Raven. At least your lame family can cook.&quot; He opened the door and found himself being hugged by an orange VixDoll.<br />
<br />
Allison shrieked with surprise as she watched Jason&#39;s body change rapidly. His clothes fell apart and his skin became lime green. His ass became a perfectly molded bubble butt, his limbs changed into those of a fox, and his face reshaped itself into a bestial muzzle. The new Doll stretched backwards, exposing its curvy new body and massive bust.<br />
Allison cried out, &quot;Blade!&quot;<br />
She immediately regretted her decision when the two Dolls turned back towards her. They advanced into Allison&#39;s bedroom, and she could see several other Dolls following them in. Acting on instinct, she darted into the connected bathroom and locked the door - and not a moment too soon. She heard thumps on the door, but she held it shut until the thumps stopped.<br />
<br />
Allison sat in the bathtub, tears forming in her eyes. What happened to her boyfriend? Already, reality was shifting to accommodate the new conversion. Allison couldn&#39;t remember his name. Bart? Blunt? She wondered why she had a Doll for a boyfriend anyway. Dolls weren&#39;t people. But they were so fun to make out with... Her tears dried as she rubbed her snatch through her tight leggings. Yes, her Doll boyfriend - or should it be girlfriend? It felt so good to touch a Doll&#39;s smooth plastic skin, which she knew because she had been making out with one just minutes ago.<br />
<br />
Allison stroked her sensitive groin, which was now a blank white patch of skin with no features to speak of. She played with her breasts, which were filling out underneath her black tank top. She thought about how good it felt to grind her crotch against another Doll&#39;s. The creaking of plastic filled the room as Allison&#39;s skin became pale blue. She tore off her clothes easily, as they had already been reduced to tatters, and exposed her nude body, although she had nothing to show since her nipples and vagina had been smoothed over. Allison remembered that her family was all Dolls, and her partner was a Doll, so naturally she was one too. She loved being a Doll. She was a Doll. Her snout and tail proved she was a Doll. She climaxed, and now there was only Doll 46 sitting in the bathtub, twitching in pleasure.<br />
<br />
Dolls 0, 1, 36, and 43-46 stood in a living room. This room had white plastic all over the walls, similar in composition to the material that made up a VixDoll&#39;s hollow body. In fact, the whole apartment was made of plastic, which was odd, because it was right in the middle of a residential neighborhood made up of wood and bricks.<br />
This house had always been a Dollhouse. There had never been any humans living in it, because obviously any humans would have been converted into more Dolls just from touching the plastic walls and floor.<br />
<br />
It was time to work. To spread the gift to as many humans as possible, it would be easiest to split up and target areas with high densities of humans. Alternatively, they could take it slowly and use the Dollhouse to convert humans more stealthily. Reality is fickle, and it could only be a matter of time before someone&#39;s memory doesn&#39;t change to suit the new status quo.</p>
