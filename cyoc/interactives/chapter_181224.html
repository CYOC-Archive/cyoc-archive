<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;I don&#39;t know....&quot; Bets&#39; mother said with her left head &quot;...but I like it!&quot; she completed with her right head &quot;More important than what happens to me, get ready soon and get down to breakfast if you don&#39;t want to be late for school.&quot; She said with her middle head, turning around quickly, leaving the room and walking down the stairs to the kitchen.<br />
<br />
Bets did not understand why her mother had transformed and did not believe that she had not freaked out about it and like what happened to her. She wanted to question her mother more about this, so she dressed in a blouse with a plunging neckline and a miniskirt as she used to dress and went down.<br />
<br />
Arriving at the kitchen, Bets saw her mother on her back finishing preparing breakfast. It was possible to see that despite the second pair of legs that grew next to her, she now had three asses too.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom, please be honest with me. Do you really think it&#39;s okay with you transforming like this?&quot; Bets said<br />
<br />
Bets&#39; mother turned her right head as much as she could and said &quot;I didn&#39;t lie, I really enjoyed being transformed.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But you became, you know, an aberration. What will people think when they see you like this?&quot; Bets said<br />
<br />
&quot;I know that I am some kind of mutant now, but this body is very useful. My job is easier now than before. As for the reaction of others, I will solve this problem later.&quot;  her mom said, finishing preparing breakfast and going with everything in hand to the table, where she joined her daughter for them to eat together.&quot; she said as she sat down, needing to place two chairs side by side to support her triple ass.<br />
<br />
Bets decided that it was better not to continue the conversation, since her mother had naturally accepted her new body, it was not right to make her feel bad about it. When she finished eating the girl looked at her mother and realized that she hadn&#39;t even started to eat, instead she had her three heads looking at her, which she noticed that everyone had their eyes fixed on her cleavage.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom, are you okay?&quot; Bets asked but had no answer, as if her mother&#39;s mind was in another world. &quot;Hey mom, wake up to life. You&#39;re making me worried like that.&quot; she said, now standing up, which made her mother finally realize what she was doing.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry, I don&#39;t know what came over me. I just couldn&#39;t stop looking at your breasts. I have never been attracted to women before, but as soon as I saw his cleavage I became hooked on it I started to feel attracted, I even feel pressure on my crotches which are strange but very good.&quot; her mom said<br />
<br />
Bets was surprised, because her mother had developed an attraction, clearly sexual, to her. With the mention of &#39;pressure on her crotches&#39; the girl looked at each area between her mother&#39;s legs, where she had a pulsating protuberance in each of her crotches. &quot;That&#39;s not what I&#39;m thinking it is, is it?&quot; she said<br />
<br />
The mother looked down for a second, then raised her right head with which she said &quot;If you are thinking the same as me, then I think it is.&quot; Not wanting to check what was on her daughter&#39;s frwnte, she tried to get up to go to the bathroom, but she forgot that she was sitting on two chairs and supporting herself with each one slid to one side, causing her to lose her balance and fall.<br />
<br />
In an attempt to prevent her mother&#39;s fall, Bets reached out to hold her as she could, but ended up holding her pants, pulling it off. Looking at her mother sitting on the floor, now with her pants down to her knees and her panties having been torn in the process of falling. Now there was no doubt that Bets&#39; mother had a 9-inch dick in each of her crotches, each with a pair of tennis ball-sized balls hanging just below.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh no. I already figured that was it, but I didn&#39;t want you to see them.&quot; Bets mom said <br />
<br />
Bets wanted to apologize to her mother for not holding her right and putting her in that situation, but she suddenly started to feel very attracted to her mother&#39;s new manmeats and ended up saying &quot;Can I touch them?&quot; quickly covering her mouth when she realized what she had said.<br />
<br />
Bets&#39; mother was surprised by the question and even liked the idea, but she resisted her wishes and said &quot;What stupid idea is that? See if you respect your mother. Now get out, you&#39;re already running late for school.&quot; <br />
<br />
Bets then ran to her room to get her purse and then left on her way to school, but she couldn&#39;t forget her mother&#39;s dicks, she still felt a great urge to touch her cocks. When she was halfway to school she remembered a very important detail that had gone unnoticed by her until then. She remembered that it was Saturday and that she had no school that day. Immediately she turned and went back to her house.<br />
<br />
Upon arriving home, Bets did not see her mother in the kitchen and anywhere on the first floor of the house, so she went up the stairs, beginning to hear some moans in the middle of the way. Arriving upstairs, she realized that the moans came from her parents&#39; room, which had the door ajar. <br />
<br />
Realizing that her mother had not bothered to close the door right because she was alone at home and did not hope that no one would return so soon, Bets peeked through the door and saw her mother sitting naked on the bed and stroking her dicks.</p>
