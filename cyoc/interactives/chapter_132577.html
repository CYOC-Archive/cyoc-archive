<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Getting through class had been a struggle for William and Dillon, possibly the hardest ones in their academic careers. Both of the raven haired theorists were practically at war with themselves as they struggled to understand what was going on. Dillon simply couldn&#39;t follow where the professor was going and became more and more fearful as the lecture proceeded. What if he started failing the class because of this? His parents certainly wouldn&#39;t have it. Why did he feel so dumb? The last question was the worst for him as somehow it turned him on to think about. It was even more terrible that this was one of their much longer lectures that lasted more than a couple of hours. Dillon was relieved when the lecture had finished so they could get out of there.<br />
<br />
William had his own issues as he was walking out of the classroom. He had to consciously force himself to not walk up to the front of the room, get on his knees and apologize to the professor for what he had done. Why he felt such a strong urge to do it, he didn&#39;t know, but he certainly wasn&#39;t going to find out what would happen if he did.<br />
<br />
The two walked in silence to the food court for dinner, lost in their own thoughts. It was only after they reached the international cuisine area that they were in for their next shock.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, Dillon, what those things called again?&quot; William asked. While quite racist, William had to admit that he did often enjoy Chinese food. It helped that he had a friend who belonged to the ethnicity, even if secretly he did wish that Dillon was more Americanized.<br />
<br />
True to his wish, however, Dillon could somehow not recall what the food was. Try as he might, the asian man was unable to even remember ever having it. He knew he&#39;d seen it before; his mother made it all the time, but he couldn&#39;t recall anything past that. &quot;I... I don&#39;t know.&quot;<br />
<br />
William looked at him with confusion as they walked away and happened to find the Italian food line. Both boys instantly locked onto the Italian sausages that were in front of them. Something deep down told them they had to have it. Instantly filling their plates with the food, they happily sat down, ready to enjoy their meal and forget about the rest of the day.<br />
<br />
After a few minutes, a lady approached the boys, and her words turned their happiness to fear. &quot;Excuse me. Sorry, but are you actually gonna eat those or just blow them?&quot; she asked, unable to contain her giggle. The other women at her table joined in as William and Dillon realized in horror what they were doing. William was licking a sausage up and down seductively while Dillon was just straight deepthroating another. In shame and embarrassment, the two boys immediately dropped their food, got up and ran, hard-ons both noticable and leading the way.<br />
<br />
They could still practically hear the laughter as they reached William and Johnathan&#39;s dorm. Dillon and William looked at each other, silently agreeing to never again talk about the incident as William opened the door.<br />
<br />
What they saw was beyond anything they could&#39;ve suspected. Both Johnathan and Nicholas were intently staring at the movie in front of them, not even noticing the raven haired boys enter the room. While them watching mainstream media was bad enough, their states of undress were even worse. Johnathan was leaning back in simply a pair of boxers that were ridden up his thighs so high that they didn&#39;t leave much to the imagination. Meanwhile, Nicholas was shirtless, shoeless and had the belt for his shorts unbuckled as he clearly displayed himself with one hand behind his head and the other reaching into his pants. Apparently, their usual shows weren&#39;t cutting it for them and as they loaded up the movie, Johnathan had convinced Nicholas to strip his shirt as well. The action was beyond pleasurable for Nicholas, who managed to strip in the most sensual way possible, which Johnathan also found oddly enjoyable. From there, two had begun taking turns taking off articles of clothing as time progressed. It was clearly Nicholas&#39; turn as they other two walked in and it looked like he was about to do it when William screamed.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the fucking hell are you two fags doing?!&quot; he yelled, completely oblivious to the irony of that statement. Dillon, on the other hand, slowly back out of the room, not wanting to be in the situation. As he quickly went back to his single person dorm, William looked as if fumes would come out of his ears in a couple of seconds. Johnathan and Nicholas could only stare at him in disbelief. The two then quickly scurried to get their clothes back on, with Johnathan tripping over himself to turn off the movie. As they finished redressing, William continued to stare at them with anger and disbelief.<br />
<br />
All that anger within him quickly dissapated as Johnathan spoke. &quot;Hey chill out, okay? It&#39;s not that big a deal.&quot;<br />
<br />
Even that small admonishment of his actions sent chills down William&#39;s spine. He suddenly felt compelled to apologize and asked to be punished. Not again, he thought to himself. &quot;Look, Nicholas, c-could you please leave?&quot; William asked.<br />
<br />
Nicholas, confused by his friend&#39;s sudden change in demeanor, obliged out of kindness. As he left the room, closing the door behind them, Johnathan looked at his friend strangely. &quot;You alright?&quot; he asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;YeahI&#39;mfine,&quot; William exclaimed a little too quickly. The sudden caring look and words that came from Johnathan sent a tingling through his body before settling in on his cock. With a half chub, William slid past Johnathan and tucked into bed so as to hide the growing erection he was facing.<br />
<br />
&quot;You sure?&quot; Johnathan asked, his blue eyes staring intently at his best friend.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yup, just great. No need to worry,&quot; William responded worryingly. &quot;I think I&#39;m just really tired. I&#39;m gonna go to sleep a little early.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Really? It&#39;s only seven. You don&#39;t even want to talk about what just happened?&quot; Johnathan countered, confused.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nah, it&#39;s fine. Maybe tomorrow. Maybe you should get some rest too, all things considered.&quot; But Johnathan was feeling anything but tired. In fact, he was feeling like he needed to release some energy. Contemplating the feeling, he decided to go out for a walk before bed and soon was out the door. He didn&#39;t even notice the slight movements coming from the groin area underneath William&#39;s blanket. And by the time he was out the building he definitely couldn&#39;t hear William&#39;s full on fap session, complete with moaning and hand roaming. The same thing went for Nicholas and Dillon&#39;s own private sessions that we&#39;re happening simultaneously: Nicholas&#39; while watching himself in the mirror of his car and Dillon&#39;s on top of the textbook he was trying to study from to no avail.<br />
<br />
It was just as Johnathan had finished his mile walk and had begun walking back that he heard the light thumping off in the distance. Curious, he followed the sound, prepared to sprint at the moment he saw trouble. Instead, what he found would be just as much of an issue for him. As he located the source of the thumping, Johnathan found that it was not aliens or government experiments, but rather a party nearing its peak. Ordinarily, Johnathan hated music. He believed to be a globalist mind control technique and regarded it with disgust. This time, however, he found himself entranced by it, and before he knew it, he was in the party with a wine cooler in his hand. He didn&#39;t know how he got it, but he somehow wasn&#39;t complaining as he began bopping to the music and dancing along.<br />
<br />
And that was how the boys first night ended. William, Dillon and Nicholas with cum all over themselves, their books or their car and Johnathan downing the first of many shots while grinding against anyone he could, lost in the music of the night.</p>
