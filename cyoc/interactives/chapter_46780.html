<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ignoring the strange feelings she was getting, she made her way to the classroom where she had study hall. She was determined to see John, and the reason was threefold. First she wanted to show him that she could do her own math homework. Second, she wanted something to keep her mind off the nonsense transform or dare curse, since it seemed that every time she thought of it she worked herself into a panic over nothing, or at least she hoped it was nothing. Lastly, she wanted the reassurance, after what she had experienced watching the girls in her physical education class, that she was still attracted to guys.<br />
<br />
Actually, the last was pretty obvious since as soon as she started to think of John, she thought of how tomorrow they would be going out on a date. Thinking like that proved to be a mistake, for the sensations returned, worse than ever and almost painful, as though her clit was straining against the tight, silky fabric of her panties.<br />
<br />
To try and kill her arousal, she tried to think of the most unsexy things she could, and thinking of what scrawny little Kyle Perkins might look like naked did the trick. by the time she arrived in study hall, she was calm cool and collected, which lasted until she saw John.<br />
<br />
He had already pulled two desks next to each other and was motioning for her to come over. She did, but when she sat down she made the mistake of crossing her legs, which sent a shiver down her spine.<br />
<br />
Seeing her shaking like that, John frowned, &quot;Are you alright?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I'm fine,&quot; her voice broke yet again, but she continued, &quot;But as you might have noticed, I've got a bit of a sore throat. I'm not going to let it get to me though, because I've got something I so need to show you!&quot;<br />
<br />
Smiling, she took out her math textbook and notebook and began demonstrating how she could solve the problems on her own.<br />
<br />
&quot;I told you you could do this stuff,&quot; John laughed, &quot;It's easy once you put your mind to it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Finishing the last problem, which was a bonus problem, worth extra credit due to its difficulty, she shrugged, &quot;I guess I just never believed you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Really, I'm just glad that I won't have to do your work anymore, I was starting to feel guilty about it,&quot; he admitted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, don't worry,&quot; she gave him a quick kiss on the cheek, &quot;You won't have to do it anymore.&quot;<br />
<br />
Then something dawned on her and her joy at what she could do turned to horror, &quot;Crap! I've got a test on all this and more  On Monday and I haven't studied at all!&quot;<br />
<br />
If John was shocked at this development he hid it well, in fact he seemed delighted, as though proud that he had managed to be such a good influence on his girlfriend, &quot;Don't worry. I can't promise any miracles, but let's see what you know. Since you managed all this so easily, I bet you get a lot more of this stuff than you think.&quot;<br />
<br />
He then took the text book from her and wrote down a number of problems for her to try and solve. While she waited for him to finish, she slipped off her shoes, which for some reason were starting to really hurt her feet.<br />
<br />
To her surprise and delight, she managed to do all of them, even the ones that had nothing to do with that day's lesson. She only made one or two simple mistakes which she caught when John had her explain to him how she solved each problem.<br />
<br />
When the bell rang for her next class, she was actually disappointed that it was time to go, she had been enjoying how happy her boyfriend was that she was finally applying herself to her math work, not to mention the way he smiled when he handed her book back and said, &quot;I'm sure you're going to pass your test. You've never actually failed before and the way you went through all of your homework and the practice problems we worked on together proves that you know what you're doing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks,&quot; she said, actually blushing, only to wince as she struggled to put her shoes back on and found that she had to loosen the laces, and even then they felt too narrow. Still, she felt pretty good about herself, receiving what amounted to a compliment on something other than her appearance was a new experience to her, one she enjoyed. It was starting to make sense why John worked to hard to keep his grades up when he was already popular because of his skill at football.<br />
<br />
She had been so caught up in doing school work with him that she had not been listening to herself speak and for that reason failed to notice that her voice had stopped breaking until she gave John a hug and commented, &quot;I'll call you tomorrow to let you know how I'm feeling so you know if our date's on or not.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Great, now I've got to hurry or I'll be late for class,&quot; as he walked away he called back to her, &quot;And once you pass your math test, let's see if we can bring your biology grade up too. It was one of my favorite subjects back when I took it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure,&quot; Jennifer laughed, then realized that her voice sounded a bit off to her.<br />
<br />
Very quietly, she spoke to herself as she made her way to her next class, &quot;Alright, I can get through the day. If I'm sick, I'm sick. If not, I've got a date tomorrow.&quot;<br />
<br />
As she listened to herself she discovered that though her voice was no longer breaking, it sounded lower, deeper maybe. Pondering whether or not she might be losing her voice, she shrugged her shoulders to make her backpack sit more comfortably, only to realize that the discomfort was due to the way her bra straps were digging into her shoulders and chest.<br />
<br />
Her next class was art, which she took only because it was an easy way to get an alright grade, and she decided to take the chance of being late to slip into the bathroom yet again, this time with the intention of adjusting her clothing.<br />
<br />
When she entered the bathroom, she saw that Tiffany was in there, leaning over one of the sinks to look in the mirror as she applied lipstick.<br />
<br />
Jennifer found her eyes drawn to Tiffany's body, admiring how good she looked and undressing her with her eyes.<br />
<br />
Noticing that she was being stared at, Tiffany turned to Jennifer, frowning, &quot;What are you looking at?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just, well,&quot; Jennifer stammered, then blurted out, &quot;You look really good today.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tiffany looked at her with intense suspicion, &quot;Really? I thought you were always talking trash about me behind my back because of how I've got a better body than you.&quot;<br />
<br />
There was no way Jennifer could deny that Tiffany had a great body, and she blushed at the thoughts she was having about it, and more out of embarrassment than anything else, she kept talking, &quot;And I'm sorry about that, really. You look great, I mean your...sense of style...&quot;<br />
<br />
Jennifer trailed off, realizing that she was staring at Tiffany's breasts and imagining what it might be like to caress them.<br />
<br />
Luckily Tiffany, throw off guard by receiving both a compliment and apology from Jennifer of all people, misinterpreted her gaze, &quot;You really think I have good taste in clothes and you like my blouse? Wow, that actually means a lot to me. I mean you know how my mom...well, ever since then it's been just me and dad, so I never really had someone to teach me about fashion. I just tired to follow all the latest trends, but I always worried I was doing it wrong. And, I'm sorry too. I guess because of how insecure I was, I'd show off, try to flaunt what I had and put other people down.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's fine, really,&quot; Jennifer said weakly, feeling like she had dodged a bullet. The way Tiffany was smiling at her gave her butterflies in her stomach and she could actually feel her clit straining against her panties, the tight confines of the silky fabric feeling so good that it almost hurt.<br />
<br />
Unable to take it any more, she all but fell into a stall, &quot;Talk to you later I hope and sorry to cut the conversation short, but I've really got to go.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's fine,&quot; Tiffany giggled, &quot;But maybe we can go shopping together some day, trade fashion tips and all that, you know, try to restart things on the right foot this time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That would be great,&quot; Jennifer said, doing her best to keep her voice even as her clit practically throbbed with urgency.<br />
<br />
As she heard Tiffany walk out and the door swing shut behind her, Jennifer let out a sigh of relief and raised her skirt to see what was going on.<br />
<br />
What she saw nearly caused her to scream, there was a visible, unmistakable, bulge pushing against her panties and thick, coarse hair sprung out from under the elastic at her legs. Knowing full well what she was going to see, she was unable to help herself and pulled them down.<br />
<br />
Terror and revulsion completely killed what she was feeling to the extent where she doubted that she would ever be turned on again. her clit had become a small, but unmistakable uncircumcised penis. It was maybe five inches long, and rapidly shrinking as fear brought an end to the raging hardon she had been experiencing only moments ago. Flaccid it was three inches, but it still looked enormous to her, especially because it wasn't supposed to be there. Fearful of what else she might discover she felt behind it and went weak with relief when she found that her pussy was still there, the same as ever, though maybe her pussy lips felt a bit larger.<br />
<br />
Trying to calm her racing heart and keep from screaming, she let go of her skirt and pulled up her panties. The curse was real and what it had done to her was horrible, but she could still keep it hidden if she made the effort. Not to mention, she had spoken with both her boyfriend and her former worst enemy, and neither seemed to think that there was anything wrong with her.<br />
<br />
After taking several deep breaths, she felt ready to leave the stall and look herself over in the mirror, just to reassure herself that her situation was not as bad as her lower anatomy suggested it was.<br />
<br />
It was not as bad as suggested, in fact, it was worse.<br />
<br />
Though her breasts were undiminished in size, her shoulders were obviously wider and her chest more muscular, which actually made her breasts look more perky, something she took no comfort in at the moment. Her arms were muscular and hairy, though clearly not as much so as a guy's would be, but her face, she had to look away.<br />
<br />
Her features had lost much of their softness, she was sure that she had what looked like sideburns growing in, and she clearly needed to shave. She had even seen an ever so slight lump at her throat, suggestive of an Adam's apple.<br />
<br />
The curse was real and like Kyle had said, it had turned her into a hermaphrodite.<br />
<br />
At the same time, in a still calm and logical corner of her mind, she was wondering if it was all some sort of hypnotic suggestion planted by Kyle during his horrible phone call since no one had commented on her obvious changes.</p>
