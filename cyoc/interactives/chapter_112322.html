<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Well Maggie,” Mike coming down the stairs; “I just finished painting the nursery. I’m going to take a shower,” Mike seeing Maggie engrossed in a game from Spencer’s console; “what are you playing?”<br />
“Oh,” Maggie putting the controller down; “just this action adventure game of Spencer’s. It has a good story and I’ve been playing it while on maternity leave. Not much else for me to do,” Maggie turning the console and tv off; “while I wait to go into labor.”<br />
“I guess with Spencer spending time with her friends,” Mike helping Maggie up; “she hasn’t spent much time on this box I got for her a few years ago.”<br />
“You spoil Spencer too much,” Maggie scoffing.<br />
“And when my grandson is born,” Mike placing a hand on Maggie’s swollen belly; “I’ll be spoiling him rotten as well.”<br />
“Go take your shower you stinky werewolf,” Maggie chuckling; “I got to get dinner going.”<br />
“No,” Mike stopping Maggie; “you rest. I’ll get supper going once my shower is done. Oh,” Mike looking at his daughter in-law; “there isn’t much of the Tardis blue paint left. So I’m not sure Spencer might have enough for what she wanted to do with her closet door.”<br />
<br />
Watching Mike head back upstairs to take his shower; Maggie growls. “I’ve rested long enough. I’m getting some cooking done.”<br />
Heading to the kitchen, Maggie pauses and sighs; feeling her son kicking within her womb, she absently purrs while cradling her taught belly, smiling as her belly button already pushing out signaling that any day she could go into labor.<br />
<br />

Ester and Lila notice the front door opening and seeing three tired looking kids entering. After having a fun day at the rec center’s pool; Cindy, Jasper and Yogi where having a hard time keeping their eyes open. Whether it was from the excitement splashing around in the pool, the greasy cheeseburger and fries consumed in a late lunch or a combination of both; Ester was happy to see her cubs home.<br />
“Did you three have fun at the rec center,” Ester seeing them slowly trudge inside.<br />
“Oh they had fun,” Frieda answering as she entered followed by Eric and Spencer; “they look about ready to have a nap.”<br />
“I see that,” Ester watching Cindy, Jasper and Yogi head to their respective rooms. With Jasper and Yogi Twin boys, they share a room while Cindy; the daughter has her own room. Hearing the doors close and the rare moment of silence; Ester breathes a sigh of relief.<br />
“I kind of figured,” Frieda looking at her mother still in the living room; “that running them ragged will give you a moment of peace.”<br />
“When Rick comes home from work,” Ester sighing; “our cubs will be up and raring to go. But yeah a chance to relax for a few hours is appreciated.”<br />
<br />
“Mom where you waiting for me,” Frieda sitting next to her mother on the coach.<br />
“I was wondering if you were going to be home for supper,” Amanda looking at her daughter; “your aunt and uncle will be over for dinner. And,” leaning close and whispering; “it would do your father some good to spend time with you. He has been on edge lately.”<br />
“But I was going to help Spencer paint,” Frieda answering; “plus there is the Labor Day picnic on Monday.”<br />
“That’s tomorrow,” Spencer speaking up; “provided there is enough paint left over from what was used for the nursery.”<br />
“Your mother finally revealed the baby’s gender,” Amanda asking.<br />
“To my grandfather,” Spencer smiling; “she intends to surprise dad when he gets home. It’s a boy by the way,” Spencer grinning.<br />
“Then it’s probably best you and Eric also come over,” Amanda sighing; “give your parents their private moment,” Looking at Spencer; “drive safe in that loud truck of yours; what with my daughter as a passenger.”<br />
“Are you coming Aunt Lila,” Frieda rejoining her friends at the door.<br />
“As soon as Lance comes to pick me up,” Lila smiling; “as well as the swag I got today. Then we will be by later,” Lila grinning; “I’m sure you and your friends will want to have a bit of fun until then.&quot;<br />

<br />
It being roughly two in the afternoon, Evan was pulling up to his home; seeing his father’s vehicle still parked at the curb, Evan was disappointed that he wasn’t going to get some alone time with his wife. Getting out of work early and picking up some fudge to share with Maggie as he hugs and embraces her while in his werewolf fursona, was his plan until supper. Hearing the heartbeat of his child as he placed his lupine ear next to Maggie’s belly, was something Evan enjoyed immensely as he growled happily. Placing his large paws on Maggie’s belly; rubbing it as the baby kicked was also a favorite during the pregnancy. Determined to make the most of those precious moments with his wife; Evan heads inside to his home.<br />
<br />
Entering his home; Evan is immediately struck by the smell of fresh paint. Curious as to what was going on as he was at work; Evan was about to head up stairs when Maggie stepped out of the kitchen smiling.<br />
“Well your home early,” Maggie looking at her husband; “were you going to try and surprise me with something?”<br />
“It seems you beat me to it,” Evan walking to his wife and kissing her passionately; “I smell fresh paint.”<br />
“Your father finished painting the nursery,” Maggie smiling.<br />
“But you said that could wait until after the birth,” Evan looking confused; “why the change?”<br />
“I wanted to surprise you,” Maggie’s grin getting bigger; “follow me love.”<br />
<br />
Leading Evan upstairs; Maggie slowly climbs the stairs. Having some difficultly; Evan helps his wife as they head up to the second floor. Purring, Maggie lets Evan enter the nursery first. Evan seeing the fresh coat of blue paint on the walls, as drop cloths are in place to protect the crib, change table and nursing chair. Evan turns around to stare at his wife as she smiles.<br />
“It’s a boy,” Evan dumbstruck and looking at Maggie; “you’re carrying my son?”<br />
“Well don’t just stand there slack jawed,” Maggie smiling; “come give your son a proper greeting.”<br />
<br />
Needing no further encouragement; Evan shifts into his werewolf fursona. Not caring that his suit rips and tears as he shifts; tearing off the ragged remnants as he growls and hugs his wife. His lupine tail wagging, displaying the joy he is experiencing. Maggie purring as she is enjoying the feel of Evan’s fur brushing along her skin; guides her husband’s paws to her belly, encouraging him to rub and massage her.<br />
“Now that you know you’re having a son,” Maggie happily enjoying the tender moment; “you want to know the name?”<br />
“You named our son already,” Evan letting his wife go and looking at her.<br />
“I’ve known the baby’s gender for a few months,” Maggie smiling; “I’ve had plenty of time to decide a name Evan.”<br />
Well tell me,” Evan crouching and placing his ear to Maggie’s belly; listening to the heartbeat within.<br />
“Evan Lawson Junior,” Maggie smiling; sighing as the baby just kicked; “and Junior just said hello.”<br />
<br />
Evan looks at his wife as she just said the baby’s name; unable to contain himself anymore; Evan raises his muzzle to the ceiling and lets out a happy howl. Mike Lawson who just came out of the shower, hearing his son’s howling races to the nursery naked and still wet.<br />
“What’s going on,” Mike looking at his son; “what happen? Is the baby on the way?”<br />
“No you naked old man,” Evan looking at his father; “put a towel on or something.”<br />
“Maggie told you,” Mike shifting into his werewolf fursona; “didn’t you Maggie.”<br />
“Yes Mike,” Maggie answering; “now get lost. Evan and I are trying to have a moment.”<br />
<br />
Mike chuckles as he heads downstairs; leaving the two parents to be alone while he see what Maggie started cooking. Grabbing his phone with his paw, Mike text’s Mindy, his were-doberman girlfriend to come over with a bottle wine for a celebratory dinner. While Maggie can’t drink alcohol for the health of the child in her; Mike figures there is nothing stopping his son from raising a glass, toasting to the inevitable birth of his second child.</p>
