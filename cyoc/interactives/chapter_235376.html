<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Would you do me a favor?” She asked “there are some guys that I want to see ducked.” Tricia explained about the neighbor boys and how they were terrible to her always spying on her and treating her like trash. Jake is interested and agrees to go to her house.<br />
<br />
Once they arrive at her house, they can see two of the boys in the front yard. Jaxon Ross is 7 and Jason Ross is 9. Tricia calls them over to her garage and Jake dicks then down. Jaxon has a long thin cock at 6.5 inches long Jason is just a little shorter at 6 inches and thin like a pencil.  Jake is impressed with the size of the boys penises.  Tricia giggles as she collects the penises “I’m going to have fun with you.” She says heading to the backyard of the house where sounds of guys are coming from.  <br />
<br />
Out back they find the other 4 Ross boys. James was 15, Jarles was 13 as was his twin Charles, and Conor was 10.  Jake dicked them before they even saw the intruders.  Tricia picked up the cocks.  James was only 2” hard and had almost no pubic hair, it was even thinner than a pencil. Tricia was laughing “your a little baby cock. Little 2 year olds are manlier than you.”  She grabbed Jar and Char they were both the same size at 4” hard and thick like a dry erase marker.  Tricia was going to tease them when she picked up Conor’s big meaty fuck stick.  “Wow” she exclaimed as she handled the 12” boner which was thicker than a soda can. <br />
<br />
Tricia couldn’t stop pushing with the huge 10 year old manhood.  Even Jake was impressed “nice one for a boy” he said teaching over to touch it.  “Yeah” Tricia said “seems like a waste not to give it to someone”. Tricia and Jake were considering it when a neighbor boy came over to see what was happening. He was so confused by what he saw.<br />
<br />
“Is that a penis” the 17 year old Kurt asked.  Kurt was small and underdeveloped.  He was only 5’2 and very thin.  He has a baby penis and tiny bb sizes nuts.  “Come here” jake orders Kurt who complies even though he is scared.  Jake pulls down the boys pants revealing his shame.  “What are you doing” Kurt pleads his 1” cock shriveling up even more.  Jake slams Conor over the pathetic little thing.  Kurt moans out in bliss as he begins to cum. Jake and Tricia watch as the cock takes root.  “What is happening”kurt screamed as the cum flows out.  When it’s over he is exhausted.<br />
<br />
“This is Conor’s cock but now it’s yours if you can tame it” Jake tells him.  “I can” Kurt Moans out.  “I want to see you rub it all over his brothers dicks” Tricia says as she plays with her wet pussy.  Kurt moves over and begins to rub his new cock on the other boys.  James Char and Jhar were hard but embarrassed by their inferior penises.  They didn’t know how big Conor was compared to themselves.  Conor was at least twice as big as they were.  James was especially pathetic.  <br />
<br />
“James bro you don’t have a real cock” Kurt said “I’ve seen baby’s with more meat than you.”  James was humiliated all his younger brothers were longer and thicker than him.  Tricia was on a mission to destroy the boys sense of manhood.  She grabbed James and took him to a nearby elementary school.  Tricia was a volunteer at the school so they let her in and she was able to get to the boys locker room with ease.<br />
<br />
There were some 7th grade boys changing clothes.  They were panicking about her presence when she started “this is the cock of a 15 year old cuck” she said as she put James boy part down for all to see “who is bigger.” She challenged.  The 7th grade boys were all in shock at the sight of a girl in the locker room and the sight of the baby cock.  Finally a boy laughed and pulled out his penis.  Karl was 11 years old and had an average size penis “I’m bigger” he said proudly.  Then Rich pulled out his wand all 4” of it and said “‘me too.”  <br />
<br />
A boy in the back laughed and came up “I’m the best” he boasted as he revealed his 8 inch cock to the crowd.  His name was Sam and he was proud of his big one. The other guys were embarrassed but Sam ordered them to pull them out and they didn’t dare disobey.  Mike was 2.5” and his brother Matt was a bit bigger at 5.5”, Aiden was only 3” and the last boy, Tyler was only a bit bigger at 3.5”.  Sam was beaming “I’m the fucking man.” The other boys just looked on in shame.  <br />
<br />
I thought twins were the same” Sam said looking mike and Matt.  “I didn’t know we weren’t” Mike said.  Tricia was going to help him out.  Sam picked up James and squeezed his balls “who’s little baby cock is this. “ Tricia told him and Sam howled with laughter “James has a little tiny clit cock.”  Tricia told them her plan to keep humiliating him.  Sam approved and gave the meat to her. Before he did he said “remember you are pathetic”. This made James hard.<br />
<br />
Tricia went to the first grade class.</p>
