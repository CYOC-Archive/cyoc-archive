<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;what&#39;s happening to me?&quot; Sei though as her body flew the magic carpet. &quot;I just became not only a girl, but a fairy princess. I need to fight!&quot; Sei  had absolutly no controlled over her body, nevertheless his mind remained intact. &quot;How are you gonna fight this if you know I will win.&quot; a voice spokes inside Sei&#39;s mind, he knew it was the fairie&#39;s. &quot;I will fight a battle of the mind, My mind!&quot; Sei thought/replied as her body took a left turn. &quot;Okay then, If you really think you can avoid inevitable doom by thinking, then go right ahead.&quot; the fairy thought, she tried to make it sound like the most un-winnable battle of all the un-winnable battles in history, but Sei knew better, he knew he was gonna win. With a good strategy and even better creativity he was certain he would win. First he knew faries we&#39;re magic so he decided to counteract it, he started thinking to himself(ish) &quot;I do not believe in magic, magic is not real.&quot; &quot;oh yeah, how do you explain the carpet?&quot; the fairy replied &quot;it is an optical illusion.&quot; he counteracted, he knew by counteracting the fairie&#39;s thoughts he would weaken her, &quot;What about flying 129 feet above the ground?&quot; She said as she did a loop as if on a rollercoaster, Sei knew he had to think and counteract fast or he would lose this battle. &quot;It is just special effects, with a green screen like they use in Hollywood.&quot; and how do you explain your body, your transformation Into a girl, your wings?&quot; The fairy princess said after taking a while to think, he knew that she was losing her energy, but he still had to act fast. &quot;It is because, because...&quot; he said as he was thinking of a way to finish his answer, he would take any logical explanation, any possible logical answer, but the first one he thought of would, although destroy the fairy, result in his doom. &quot;Because I was always a 6 year old girl,&quot; he paused to think of the answer for her second question. &quot;the reason I look like a fairy is because I am wearing a costume.&quot; he felt like a dumbass, he should have said he was wearing a costume in the first place &quot;NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!&quot; The fairy said, as every last magical question has been &#39;realisticized&#39; (a term they use in the magic world, when all ones magic has been explained with a realistic and logical answer) she left Sei&#39;s body, hopefully for good, but by amswering the first part of the fairie&#39;s question the way he did, his day would soon get much worse. &quot;Uuugh&quot; he grunted in pain as he held his head with his hands hoping to relieve a very big migraine, soon he had his mind back, but his mind was leaving him once again, probably for ever. &quot;It huuuuurts&quot; Seis said as his mind left him more and more as new memories were replacing them, his first memorable birthday- he got a set of Barbie dolls which he loved to make the boys and girls kiss &quot;ewwww  that&#39;s gross kissing is so disderful,&quot; he thought, he shook his at the last part and tried to correct himself &quot;wonderting,    WONDERFUL!!! Why wood I ever think it is disgusting.&quot; Seish  thought, trying to fight yet, another battle of the mind &quot;Because it is... NOT! In fact it is even better when I actually get kissed, it was by my first crush, Joyice, Joyrdan, Jordan, why did I think Joyice that is a girl&#39;s name, I&#39;m no lesbian!&quot; Seash tried to think &quot;because Joyice IS your first crush,&quot; but couldn&#39;t he was slowly sinking lower, even lower than when he started fighting that fairy princess, he could barely think &quot;Oh, it was so wonderful, his lips against mine! tongues touching, lips flying and minds high above the clouds, I wish I knew what those grown-ups do. I think they call it a flench kiss or something? it didn&#39;t matter if I knew that or not, all that mattered was the magic that happened that night.&quot; Seasha didn&#39;t want to think about all that but was forced to, it was torture for Sasha, the new girl. &quot;that was my name right&quot; Sasha tried to say, but it was hopeless, it doesn&#39;t matter if her name was Rainbow Sparkles now,it was all too late, he felt himself slipping, falling from his own body, well it wasn&#39;t his it was Sasha&#39;s now, but he managed to think one last thing, &quot;is this death?&quot; NO, not just think, say! Those very words slipped from Sasha&#39;s mouth, but for different reason, becase as the mind replacement progressed the magic carpet slowly became a mirror again, and right now it has been rendered completely flightless. There was screaming, crying, and the voice of someone else. Mike. When it all ended two bodies lay unconscious on the bare ground, if they were awake they would have had extreme amnesia, like mind-wiping where you forget who you were forever unless some sort of miracle happens amnesia. then they woke up &quot;Uuugh, what happened?&quot;</p>
