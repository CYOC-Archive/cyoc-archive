<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You looked to this mysterious vixen, and then into her eyes and you paused. You couldn’t quite put your paw on it, but you knew this woman, fondly almost.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm, Karther do we know this woman? I feel like I’ve seen her before, is she one of your.... harem vixens, as you put it?&quot; You stated and he paused then looked to her. You then walked up to her and poked her head, and her head turned back into flesh and fur, and Janice started looking around dazed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, but that shouldn’t concern you, you know that my heart always belongs to you my extravagantly elegant queen. Also why did you unfreeze her?&quot; Karther replied and you looked at him and growled a bit,&quot;Now is not the time for flattery Karther! What has she done that concerns us? I want to hear her word against yours, IF it is a situation that involves me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Karther paused then said,&quot;She was trying to escape, she is a traitor and a...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I am not, you manipulative perverted freak!!&quot; Janice blurted out, and you looked to her, eyes wide, and she looked back at you and whimpered a bit.<br />
<br />
&quot;The mouth on this one, she almost sounded like me when I was but 8 years old!&quot; You exclaimed <br />
<br />
&quot;Your parents were so undignified, but then again what would I expect from a prideful family of warriors.&quot; Karther commented<br />
<br />
You rolled your eyes at this then sighed, and looked back to Janice and examined her body once more. &quot;How do I know this woman, and why does she speak so ill about her own ruler, and partial mate? Ugh, I hate that Karther shares me with all of his other bitches!&quot; You thought to yourself then paused for a moment,&quot;But she had the courage to become her own individual it seems. I wonder... can that be useful? Actually, this gives me an idea.&quot;<br />
<br />
You looked over to Karther and smiled at him and said,&quot;I think I have a fitting punishment for her, just leave her to me and go about your own business.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But... Tammie...&quot; Karther began then you interrupted him and growled,&quot;Karther, you know just as well as I do how busy you are! Now I have business of my own, and I sure as hell don’t have time to indulge in... whatever the hell &#39;this&#39; is, so go about your day and let me do this on my own!&quot;<br />
<br />
Karther paused then sighed as he saw your annoyed expression. You crossed your arms over your breasts, and you watched as your husband&#39;s eyebrow twitched, which signified that he was desperate. Karther then walked up to you and he took your hands, and held them out in front of you. <br />
<br />
&quot;Tammie, I love you, you know that right?&quot; He asked<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course I do, but sometimes you bring out the bad in me sometimes, and in a way, that’s part of why I love you.&quot; You replied<br />
<br />
Karther smiled warmly and wrapped his arms around your body. You felt him cup your rear and stroke your tails, and you reached up and wrapped your arms around his shoulders. The two of you locked eyes and pulled each other into a brief but passionate kiss.<br />
<br />
Janice watched all of this and she had a shocked look on her face while you tasted every inch of your husband’s maw, and a little bit after you both stopped. You released each other from the embrace, and Karther looked back at you and said,&quot;Tammie, I trust that you&#39;ll make the right decision. But please, stay in your room, there had been an assault and because of that I have to clean up the mess. I&#39;ll send an escort when I know it’s safe.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You underestimate me my beloved, I&#39;ll be fine.&quot; You said then giggled.<br />
<br />
&quot;You heir from warriors, I don’t underestimate you, but I would rather not risk the life of the beloved queen in battle. Think of our citizens, and those that love you, okay?&quot; Karther asked<br />
<br />
You paused for a moment then sighed and said,&quot;Okay, okay, you’re right, just go and I&#39;ll wait for you in our room.&quot;<br />
<br />
Karther smiled at this and snapped his fingers, and you watched a door appear on your right. You smiled, and blew a kiss to Karther now, and he waved back to you as he left.<br />
<br />
You then turned to Janice, who’s head was the only thing that wasn’t petrified at the moment, and you looked at her and said,&quot;Okay, so tell me your side of the story. How is it that I feel like I know you fondly?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wh.... don’t you recognize me? We’ve known each other for years!&quot; Janice yelped <br />
<br />
You paused then groaned a bit and said,&quot;Of course we do, if you’re one of those whores my husband just loves to violate I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve been here for just as long.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, not like that! We were friends, best friends, my name was Jake remember?!&quot; Janice cried<br />
<br />
You paused again hearing this name and thought for a moment,&quot;Jake? That seems to ring a bell.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Jake....hmmm, you have at least part of my attention now. I also can’t deny someone losing their manhood. Has he impregnates you yet, or is that yet another &#39;privilege&#39; reserved for me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?!&quot; Janice blushed now and yelled,&quot;Don’t you remember?! We weren’t.... like this before, you weren’t well... you and I weren’t like this!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well obviously, I married Karther a few years ago, and you just stated you had a pair of balls and a sheath. Now tell me why you shouldn’t be turned into a new ring, or necklace, or something else I can’t think of.&quot; You growled<br />
<br />
Janice’s ears dropped and she sighed,&quot;I... I....&quot;<br />
<br />
You facepalmed then growled,&quot;Spit it out, a lady shouldn’t stutter, it wastes everyone’s time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I just wanted to see you and me safe...a...&quot; Janice began and you paused as a faint memory suddenly popped into your head, and you groaned feeling like you had a mild headache.<br />
<br />
&quot;and... you wanted to escape, with me... is that correct?&quot; You asked, but were partially shocked at what you said.<br />
<br />
Janice’s ears perked up and she nodded happily and said,&quot;Exactly! That’s it!&quot;<br />
<br />
You looked back at Janice and paused, thinking once more then you looked to her and smiled. &quot;Well, I don’t know what kind of fantasy you’re ranting on about, but whatever it is I.... well I believe you. Definitely does explain a few factors, however I can’t just let you be.&quot; You exclaimed <br />
<br />
Janice whined and her ears dropped to the side and you ran your hand down her body, turning everything back to normal on her, and she paused and stared at you appalled and asked,&quot;You can do that now?!&quot;<br />
<br />
You rolled your eyes and nodded to her. &quot;Obviously you haven’t payed much mind to me now it seems. But anyways I have an idea that I think we both could benefit from, and keep in mind I&#39;m being nice.&quot; You stated and Janice nodded to you.<br />
<br />
&quot;Karther, be it his pride, or perversion wants a male heir as a firstborn child. I however don’t, and if we have a daughter I&#39;ll do everything in my power to.... let’s say get rid of that harem of his, because what kind of lesson would that teach our little princess?&quot; You began and Janice started to look nervous and she gulped.<br />
<br />
&quot;And uh.... Wh-where are you going with this?&quot; She asked<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m getting to that now, so be patient. So, once his little whores are gone, no offense to you by any means, he will have no choice but to focus on his duties, his issues with the angles, and finally his wife and daughter. That daughter milady, will be you no matter what. So, you abandon the life of a fucktoy, and a possible prisoner, and become a royal child heir to the throne, or well.... you will and I will erase your memory so it’s less willing.&quot; You explained<br />
<br />
Janice’s tails dropped between her legs, and she looked at you innocently with the eyes of a distressed damsel. &quot;I-I don’t have much of a choice, do I?&quot; She whined<br />
<br />
&quot;Honestly, from what this situation sounds like, Karther probably used some of his manipulation mind spells, or whatever. I usually don’t get blindsided by such things, but if I bed him I can at least catch him off guard mentally, or maybe I&#39;ll catch him passed out with one of his whores again.&quot; You said, gritting your teeth a bit at the thought of Karther in a slumber, with his knot stuck up another woman.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your marriage sounds.... really messed up.&quot; Janice exclaimed then she mumbled something under her breath, but you decided to ignore that.<br />
<br />
&quot;Anyways, Janice, are you willing to do this, or am I going to have to erase your mind. I have to say I&#39;d like to hear more stories about our... friendship, so I hope you choose wisely.&quot; You exclaimed then extended a hand to Janice and smiled at her.<br />
<br />
Janice paused then she sighed and took your hand,&quot;It’s a deal...mother, but please listen to what I have to say, truly.&quot;<br />
<br />
You paused then you slowly nodded to Janice and said,&quot;I&#39;ll give you a motherly promise, and leave your father to me.&quot; You winked at Janice and she blushed a bit as you sent a wave of magic through the palm of her hand.<br />
<br />
Her body started shrinking, her features turning younger and younger by the moment. Her breasts and his slowly disappeared as puberty was reversing itself. You sighed as you watched this and said,&quot;The next part won’t be so happy both ways, but I&#39;ll make sure I change the room up a bit for you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Janice paused when suddenly she fell onto all fours and her teeth receded into her gums. She then slowly curled up and a glowing orb formed around her, and it shrank to the size of a mere pea and it floated into your womb. You smiled now, feeling a tingling in your womb as Janice sat in your folds. You knew that nothing would start to happen unless you wanted it to, so you took this time to enter into your illustrious room that you shared with Karther from time to time whenever he wasn’t with a harem girl, which was less than desirable.<br />
<br />
You pulled back the purple tinted curtains of your bed and looked around the room one last time at all of your fancy, and jeweled furniture before you started to make changes. First you moved the bed into a corner magically, which opened up a large area next to it. You then created a cozy royal pink crib for Janice, and a pen that took up one third of the room, and gave it padded flooring for her. You then added a bookshelf full of childish books, a bunch of baby toys, and a velvety red chair for storytelling next to the crib. <br />
<br />
Feeling content you proceeded to take off all manners of clothing from your body, leaving you perfectly nude, and you stood in front of a large mirror. You then paused and facepalmed wondering how you were going to trick Karther into thinking you were pregnant when it hit you. You approached the doorframe to the room and put a rune on the door, making it so that whoever went to open it would suddenly believe and have memories of you being pregnant for the past nine months.<br />
<br />
You now laid down on your bed and put a hand on your stomach and smiled. &quot;What better place to give birth than the place you were conceived at?&quot; You said with a small giggle. <br />
<br />
You then sighed and you sent a small wave of magic through the hand on your stomach and your breasts and stomach started swelling. As each minute passed you became another month into your pregnancy, and your breasts grew multiple cup sizes through this. Now looking six months pregnant you started to feel Janice squirming around inside of you. You rubbed your stomach and said,&quot;Calm now, you&#39;ll be out soon enough.&quot; You weren’t quite sure if Janice could hear you, but the point seemed to get across as her movements seemed more minor, and less panicked. Your spell was not only accelerated your pregnancy, but it was giving Janice the physical traits of both you and Karther.<br />
<br />
Soon you looked nine months pregnant, and you now had large E cup breasts and your stomach looked like it had a watermelon inside of it. It was then that you felt your water break, and after you wet the bed from this the contractions and pain started as you went into labor. Quickly, you spread your legs and began pushing and screaming in pain. &quot;God! This is harder than I thought!&quot; You snarled then you felt your vagina stretch and that’s when you started howling in pain.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aaaagh fuck me!&quot; You growled feeling Janice’s little body approach the exit point of your womb. You continued pushing, but contemplated if this truly was the best plan for you to deal with Karther.<br />
<br />
However those thoughts soon left as you felt the head crowning, and the pain was near unbearable and you were starting to wish that you had something to bite down on. You paused to catch your breath for a moment, and then found the strength to continue and with all your might pushed. You then felt Janice slide out of your womb, and you laid there feeling more exhausted than you&#39;ve ever felt in your life.<br />
<br />
Janice started crying, of course, after her rebirth into the world and you looked down at her, vision blurred by what you just went through for a few moments. With what little ounce of strength you had left in you, you took Janice into your arms and smiled as you saw the femininity between her legs.<br />
<br />
Moments later a large clutter of footsteps could be heard from the door, probably some guards investigating the noise, hopefully with a doctor to help her out right now. The door then swung open and swiftly rushed in....</p>
