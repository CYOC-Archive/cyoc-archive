<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The Characters: 
<br>

<br>
 Paul DeSoto – The widowed father of the DeSoto 
<br>
 family, Paul is 42, 5’10”, and weighs a burly 180 
<br>
 pounds. He is a very good-man of mostly Italian 
<br>
 descent, with dark brown hair on his head and over 
<br>
 much of his body. 
<br>

<br>
 Don DeSoto – Don, Paul’s oldest son, is 18. He is a 
<br>
 freshman at State University and lives on campus, 
<br>
 although he makes frequent visits home. Don is the 
<br>
 same height and body type as his father but weighs ten 
<br>
 pounds less. His hair is a medium brown, and his body 
<br>
 is largely hairless, although he wears a rakish goatee. 
<br>

<br>
 Bryan DeSoto – Bryan is 16 and a sophomore in high 
<br>
 school. He is 6’ tall with a more average build than his 
<br>
 older brother and father but is just as cute. Like his 
<br>
 brother Don, he also has medium-brown hair. He has 
<br>
 an after-school job at the local fast-food restaurant. 
<br>

<br>
 Brett DeSoto – Brett is the youngest brother at 13. He is 
<br>
 in junior high school, and his body has only just begun 
<br>
 to develop. He is a very cute kid but also somewhat of a 
<br>
 troublemaker. The boys’ mother died giving birth to him, 
<br>
 and he has always felt inadequate because of this. 
<br>

<br>
 Matt Laird – Matt is the DeSoto’s next-door neighbor. He 
<br>
 is as dark as they are, with very dark brown hair, but his 
<br>
 eyes are an indescribable orange-hazel color. He is 17 
<br>
 years old and one year ahead of Bryan in school. Mr. 
<br>
 DeSoto is good friends with Matt’s parents, who have 
<br>
 helped him out a lot as a single father, but the DeSoto 
<br>
 brothers have never taken a shine to Matt, who is more 
<br>
 bookish in general, as well as a closeted homosexual. 
<br>

<br>

<br>
 The Action: 
<br>

<br>
 It was a crisp November day, and Matt Laird was 
<br>
 sprawled across his parents’ bed, watching the 
<br>
 television in their bedroom. The television in the other 
<br>
 part of the house had fizzled out the night before, and 
<br>
 he didn’t want to miss his favorite after-school show, 
<br>
 “The Nanny.” While delighting in the antics of Nanny 
<br>
 Fine and the Sheffields, Matt took sips from the glass of 
<br>
 Diet Coke he’d brought from the kitchen. 
<br>

<br>
 Unfortunately, at one point, while reaching for the can, 
<br>
 he accidentally knocked it over. The soda splashed 
<br>
 across his father’s night table and dripped down the 
<br>
 side. Horrified, Matt saw that the drawer was partly 
<br>
 open and that some of his father’s possessions had 
<br>
 also gotten soaked! 
<br>

<br>
 The TV forgotten, he ran for a towel and cleaned up the 
<br>
 best he could. His father was a good man but he was 
<br>
 very protective of his possessions and his privacy. He 
<br>
 would have even forbidden Matt entry into the room had 
<br>
 he known about it. 
<br>

<br>
 The table’s surface cleaned up easily enough, but it 
<br>
 was with dread the Matt pulled open the drawer and 
<br>
 faced the soggy papers there. He tried to mop the soda 
<br>
 off the old letters and receipts, but it had soaked right 
<br>
 through them to a more battered-looking paper below. It 
<br>
 was made of a sort of parchment, and when Matt 
<br>
 moved to wipe it off, he felt that there was actually 
<br>
 something wrapped inside. 
<br>

<br>
 Curiosity overwhelmed him, and he had to move it to 
<br>
 clean up anyway, he decided to take a peek. Wrapped 
<br>
 in the parchment was a silver rod, about he size of a 
<br>
 pencil, but without a point. It was cold to the touch, but 
<br>
 there seemed to be a strange vibration associated with 
<br>
 it. Odd, Matt thought. He was about to put it down when 
<br>
 he saw that there was writing on the parchment. It was, 
<br>
 however, in an antique ink that had largely already 
<br>
 faded. The acidic soda hadn’t helped: only a few words 
<br>
 were legible. 
<br>

<br>
 But what words! 
<br>

<br>
 “Point magic wand” and “Make a wish” were two of the 
<br>
 phrases that were still visible. These made such an 
<br>
 impression upon Matt, who had always dreamed of 
<br>
 discovering such a fantastic device, that he gave much 
<br>
 less attention to the only other legible words: “Pay a 
<br>
 price.” 
<br>

<br>
 Of course, it couldn’t be real, could it? What would his 
<br>
 father be doing with a real, live magic wand hidden in 
<br>
 his bedside table. But still, despite knowing the 
<br>
 apoplectic rage it would invoke, Matt finished cleaning 
<br>
 up the best he could and whisked the wand away to his 
<br>
 own bedroom, where he assumed a greedy crouch and 
<br>
 tried to decide upon his first wish. 
<br>

<br>
 A series of bangs from outside the window drew his 
<br>
 attention. Brett DeSoto, his young next-door neighbor, 
<br>
 was in the backyard with a basketball, bouncing it into 
<br>
 some trash cans. His attention held, Matt let his gaze 
<br>
 travel across the DeSoto house. For thirteen years, it 
<br>
 had been without a woman’s touch. No plants adorned 
<br>
 the yard but a lawn of weedy grass. No curtains were 
<br>
 on the windows that faced away from the street. Matt 
<br>
 had always been able to watch his neighbors’ activities 
<br>
 as if the house were his own, private fish bowl. Brett 
<br>
 was in the backyard, Bryan was in the bedroom flipping 
<br>
 through some sort of magazine, and Mr. DeSoto was 
<br>
 just pulling into the driveway, home from his grueling 
<br>
 construction job. 
<br>

<br>
 A smile came to Matt’s face as he thought of the perfect 
<br>
 wish. In recent months, it had begun to dawn on him 
<br>
 that the bizarre fantasies he had about his male friends 
<br>
 were just not going to go away. It was only since the 
<br>
 past summer that he had decided to capitalize upon 
<br>
 those strange ideas to add fodder to his marathon 
<br>
 jerk-off sessions, which since he had decided to 
<br>
 embrace these fantasies once and for all had ended in 
<br>
 magnificent bursts of teenaged cum arcing across the 
<br>
 room. 
<br>

<br>
 Matt was not only secretly gay, he was also a closet 
<br>
 macrophile. 
<br>

<br>
 He silently made his wish, and when nothing 
<br>
 happened immediately, he noticed the time and 
<br>
 cursed. His father would be home at any moment, and 
<br>
 he needed to hide the stolen wand before the 
<br>
 tampering was discovered. 
<br>

<br>
 Matt’s first wish was:</p>
