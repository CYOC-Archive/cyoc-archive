<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The first person to wake in the house in the morning was Paul as his alarm went off. He gets out of bed with only the early morning light to see by. He goes to the bathroom to shower and shave before work. In the bathroom he finds his skin to be somewhat sticky and slimy which he rationalizes as a mix of drool and sweat not knowing he was smeared with some for his youngest son’s super serum semen that had been all over his wife. Paul went to shave but found himself without his normal stubble and skin softer than he remembered it being. Skipping his shave Paul showered and returned to the bedroom to get dressed for work. Once dressed he gave his still sleeping wife a kiss on the cheek then left the room. The kiss had left his lips sticking and left an odd taste in his mouth but Paul ignored it as he eat his breakfast before leaving for work.<br />
<br />
The next to wake up in the house was Julia when the sound of the front door closing finally knocked her out of her sleep. She tried to get out of bed but found herself stuck to her sheets as Henry’s cum had bonded the two. It took a bit of effort but Julia was able to separate herself from the bedding and get to her feet. She collected the sheets and took them to the laundry room and put them in the washing machine to be cleaned. She then realized that she was completely topless and had gone across the house with her breasts exposed. What if a neighbor had seen her through a window or something thought Julia. To cover up she tried to put on a bra from her laundry but it wouldn’t fit her breasts as they had gotten bigger due to them being saturated with super baby cum. They had to be G cups now even larger than her previous estimate. <br />
<br />
Covering her breasts with her hands Julia ran back through her house to her bathroom and into the shower. She finally washed off the last of Henry’s cum and noticed her hips were wider and her butt was bigger. Once out of the shower Julia dried her body and hair and was about to go check on her sons when she realized she had forgotten to put on any clothes. The easy feeling of walking around completely naked worried Julia but she couldn’t dwell on that now.<br />
<br />
The third person to wake up was Henry when he heard his mother gasp in shock when entering his room. Since Henry’s sexual mutation the day before, he had ejaculated 4 times and produced a great amount of cum. This strained his body making the super serum activate to improve his performance and relieve the strain. Since Julia had last seen his balls had expanded from the size of large chicken eggs to the size of tennis balls. On top of that his cock must have grown 6 inches longer. The cumulative growth had ripped his diaper off exposing his genitals. <br />
<br />
Now awake Henry crawled to the edge of his crib and looked out to his mother. Julia regaining her composure walked to the crib and kneeled down to look at Henry through the cribs bar. Henry giggled and got closer to the bars grabbing them and lifting himself into a standing position. His movement sent his dragging cock flopping forwards out of the bars and almost slapping his mother in the face. Julia gulped as the cock wobbled in front of her from Henry pressing his crotch against the bars. Thick foreskin covered the still flaccid cock and Julia found herself kneeling lower to look up into the tip to get a glimpse of the head and slit. <br />
<br />
The last to wake up that morning was Steve. He woke up ahead of his alarm which was weird for him but he forgot about it when he heard strange noises coming from across the hall. Leaving his room Steve walked to the open door to Henry’s room and stared at the sight inside. The noises that he had heard were Henry’s giggling and the wet slapping of his mother by the baby’s incredible cock. Henry had figured out that wiggling his hips would make his semi erect cock swing side to side and slap his mother in the face. Henry found this wonderfully amusing and giggled every time his mother moaned after getting hit. Steve watched his mother get cock slapped for at least a minute before Henry got fully erect and actually spurted precum across his mother’s face. The sight was too much for Steve and he felt compelled to get onto the ground next to his mother and offer himself up to be slapped and marked. <br />
<br />
Julia was a little surprised when Steve knelt down next to her but she didn’t question it when they both got slapped by her baby’s super cock. Henry seemed to laugh even louder once Steve joined his little game and he soon let off another spurt of precum marking Steve’s face. Once both of them were marked he stopped his wiggling as the two started a cooperative bow job for the mighty cock. They licked and kissed all over the shaft and both  sucked on his massive nuts trying to fix them in their mouths. When it came time for Henry to release both Julia and Steve were kneeling in front of him with mouths open wide and hands cupped to catch what was to come. The two then were absolutely painted with the baby’s impossible load  coating them in white. When they cleaned up Julia found it impossible to fit a diaper on the baby normally and hole hand to be made for his cock and balls to fit out of. Steve and Julia had to discuss what they should do. </p>
