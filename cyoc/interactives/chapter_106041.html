<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Alan Zheng never liked the traditional lifestyle of how Asian parents raised their children, always drilling them to do well in their studies like grades were the most important thing in the world. They always used harsh disciplinary measures and prided on honor , respect and authority for the sake of following an &quot;oriental Asian heritage&quot; dated back over a dynasty ago. What complete nonsense! Those are just far-fetched beliefs that only stereotypical sheep follow.<br />
<br />
Alan was a father of two adopted sons, Asian of course as he didn&#39;t want the risk of them to be adopted by one of those Asian conservative families, he already had enough when he lived with his parents. <br />
<br />
Along with his married husband, they took good care of the soon-to-be teenage boys. He was in his twenties and lacked proper experience in proper parenting, giving them the freedom to do whatever they want. Which is great except the fact that they have too much freedom, to the point whereby they&#39;ll rebel and ignore their parents&#39;s wishes, rebellion and lack of respect. The scientists knew of this and wanted to correct this issue before it gets out of hand.<br />
<br />
When Alan was out at the movies with his husband, they were disguised as movie staff carefully slipped in sedatives in their drinks without any of them knowing. They picked Alan up, and kept his old diamond wedding ring and replaced it with a jade wedding ring made from China, filled with the stereotypical serum. Twisting it slightly as needles injected the chemicals into the man&#39;s finger, reacting sternly as they began to straighten up his biological DNA.<br />
<br />
The next morning, Alan found himself waking up almost instantaneously on his king sized bed. Having a horrendous dream last night, with both his husband and himself being sedated and kidnapped. He looked to the right and his husband wasn&#39;t there. He shook his head and found it heavy, as he got up to clean himself and headed to the bathroom. His husband was probably out at work.<br />
<br />
He washed himself and looked at his reflection, being of average height with an average build with not much muscle. He had semi-long black hair at the front with sides shaved, paleish skin with a handsome face that seemed to differ him from other Asians , like he was of mixed blood. He was naked but could recall him wearing a stripped shirt and wooly pants when they were on their date last night, maybe his husband helped removed it for him?<br />
<br />
He shrugged as he headed over to the showers to cleanse off the sweat and mess from the night before, humming the song he might&#39;ve heard yesterday about the show they&#39;ve seen. &quot;Hmmm how does it go? ....Shi Zhe Yang ne? Mmmmm!&quot; He paused, briefly noting he spoke Chinese just now. He slapped himself in the butt and laughed at his silliness , before stretching his legs in the shower with a STRETCHHHH! &quot;Huh? Did they just---?&quot; Grew a few inches, yeah they did. He seemed to be able to reach the tall shower head , almost touching the ceiling. <br />
<br />
He wondered if it was suddenly growth spurt... Or that it was genetics. Although it was strange, and for some odd reason he seemed to recall always being very tall even when he was younger. He felt his toes, and began scrubbing them heavily like he knew that they needed to be cleaned throughly. Scrubbing his feet as they seemed to swell in size along with his buttocks and thighs. <br />
<br />
&quot;Huge as cousin in Mainlands.&quot;<br />
<br />
He spoke, suddenly knowing and recalling his family&#39;s history back in China. &quot;Ah yeah...my younger days? Right?&quot; He tried to recall, originally thinking that he wasn&#39;t born in China and was born in America instead. Feeling signs of dislike about his origins fade away as he recalled the family bondings he had since he was young. <br />
<br />
Bending down as his back complained about the exertion as it swelled in stature , laid with protein and protein obtained from local delicacies back in his homeland, toughening up along with his stronger and tougher thighs as he reached up and allowed the water to cleanse him, with numerous bristles of matured hair layering nicely all over his skin.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ayio! So hot!&quot; Originally warm, the water now became hot and steamy as it darkened and roughened his skin, developing a nice tan as he flexed his muscles to release the tension he developed all over his body. It was aching harder than he ever had before, and he didn&#39;t understood why, he had a proper training regime to keep himself looking fit after all, he was a male, a father even, and he had to be as dependable as one. What would the teachers say if he wasn&#39;t looking firm and in charge? <br />
<br />
He slapped his ass and gave it a little pinch, noticing the firmness in it like he really gave it his all during running. His felt the testosterone boiling amidst the heated storm, as his biceps toughened like his cousins, his pecs swelled thick and his abs layed nicely, completing his fatherly bod. He rinsed his ever-more so spiky hair, sides and back shaved to oblivion and top trimmed to a conservative crew cut.<br />
<br />
<br />
Alan stepped out of the shower and cleaned himself up, going back to the master bedroom feeling it seeming...different, more so &quot;Chinese&quot; as his mind thought. &quot;Wah! It is nice!Pretty well done!&quot; His mind appreciated the culture, an accented voice speaking earnestly with the language barrier breaking apart, in fact , he was better in Chinese than English as it is his blood, his culture and race. It would be disgraceful if he wasn&#39;t good in it.<br />
<br />
He went to the wardrobes and saw rows and rows of dress shirts and pants lined up. Almost identical to one another aside from the difference in color. Along with traditional Chinese tailored silk wear, in which he wears on occasion when he&#39;s on a day off or its during a festival, it consisted of accessories. of different varieties ,black polished dress shoes kept in mint condition, as well leather belts.<br />
<br />
Without thinking, Alan picked the closest pair of a formal attire combo. White top and black bottom and tie, the classic. He nicely adjusted his tie and slipped on his dress shoes after wearing his silky socks. As the clothes pressed against his skin, he recalled working in business for over a decade in an office situated in the USA.<br />
<br />
Being a fellow Asian and fluent in Chinese like his other co workers as he blended right in the corporate jungle, and we&#39;re thankful for the numerous opportunities and trips they provided<br />
for other Asian men such as himself.<br />
<br />
Now as he looped through the belt and tightened it, he recalled the measures his parents would take to discipline them when he and his brothers were younger. Always expecting the best from their sons--and with that train of thought, he went to check on his sons. Exiting the master bed room as he went down the stairs with CLUNK CLUNK CLUNKS.<br />
<br />
Alan peered into the living room , looking straight as he saw his sons playing video games in the living room like always, already doing so early in the morning as it were the school holidays. He smiled briefly before suddenly being hit with pangs of guilt and worry. Why are they wasting time on such useless games?! They should be using this time to do something more productive! Like studying! <br />
<br />
He felt these sensations turning into rage and anger, like a need to be dominant and take control of the house, like he wore the pants in the family. The sensations boiled within his veins as they raged with age and maturity. Wrinkles appearing over his forehead. Left hand held onto the belt on his waist tightly and firmly, mind wanting to whip it out and discipline his unruly children. Right hand swiftly pointing out with a--<br />
<br />
Alan shouted, calling out their Chinese names as expectations of his children rose through the roof like never before, strictness bursting through the roof with the will to discipline them, even harshly so that they will succeed in life.<br />
<br />
His mouth ran on and on, giving them a parental lecture as the bonds between his sons and their biological father tightened fiercely. Them bowing in respect to authority. Reality shifting so it would&#39;ve been this way all the time as games disappeared as their features and clothing became more Asian than ever.<br />
<br />
&quot;Father will not tolerate any insolence! GO!&quot;<br />
<br />
They dashed out of the living room and quickly picked up their textbooks. Dashing to somewhere in the house to study, his father knew they would because they understood the painful punishments they will receive if they disobeyed.<br />
<br />
Mr Zheng sat on the empty couch, not even affected by the changed room. Walls now completely painted red with drawers made of mahogany and oak, filled with tons of jade and strange trinkets that seem to be imported from China. In fact, Mr Zheng smirked. He felt proud of his collection and the living room&#39;s design, &quot;very traditional&quot; he remarked, as though it was his thing. <br />
<br />
The Chinese dad picked up a newspaper on the side table, like it was a daily routine of his, switched on the television as it ended up on some foreign language news show, his mind clicked , it was Hokkien, the dialect his parents would converse to him when he was younger. He smiled as he let it play, as he began to hum the tunes of olden folksongs he&#39;s heard when he was younger.<br />
<br />
&quot;My vision...&quot; Mr Zheng squinted his eyes as he tried to read the blurry words to no avail, as he peered out , his vision became messy and poor as he could barely even see the television screen, he reached out to the side desk again, like he knew something would be there to help fix his imperfection. He grabbed a pair of glasses and placed it on his eyes, thinner than ever. &quot;Much better!&quot; He exclaimed as he read the news, understanding it fluently as it was completely in Chinese --but wasn&#39;t he bad in-- &quot;Engrish...thankfully they sent the Chinese newspaper instead of the engrish one...&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;DING DONG!&quot;<br />
<br />
Mr Zheng went to the front door, and what he saw beneath his glasses was a sight for sore eyes, and for some odd reason, felt familiar. Alan kept staring at her, like she was someone that he couldn&#39;t forget.<br />
<br />
She was an Asian lady dressed in a Qi pao with her hair tied back into a flower bun. Reaching out for Alan&#39;s left arm as she attached a silver watch which made him ease all his tension. He smiled at her, as he felt her cheeks and hair with his aged hands. Familiarity resonates in him , yet, the middle aged man feels that this is very wrong, that he&#39;s gay...right?<br />
<br />
But his genes are saying otherwise, stating that he shouldn&#39;t be gay as that would be a dishonor to his family heritage and forefathers from generations and generations ago as he feels the pent up frustration and homophobia dominating the remaining bits of homo he had. His jaw broadened with handsome features that seemed to be typical of a heterosexual Asian male like the rest of his co-workers, them having girlfriends and wives of their own...wife?<br />
<br />
What a final burst of the uncontrollable serum, and groin pressing against the woman as he pressed his lips deep into hers, his dick spluttered out a show sign of love and arousal to his wife, and complete denial of his former sexuality.<br />
<br />
 An excessive homophobic mindset boomed in his head, as it grew to be as aggressive as a straight, hetero man would be, and as fierce and domineering as a strict Asian father.<br />
<br />
Zheng Ah Wen kissed his wife deeply at the doorstep, like it was the final kick to the end of his former non-Asian ways. As family photos get replaced with him and his wife dressed conservatively in dress apparel with their sons dressed similarly as well. Some photos like their wedding and anniversary depicted them in rich traditional Chinese garments which pleased his ego very much, as it was what the emperor wore over dynasties ago. <br />
<br />
The strict Asian dad gave a truly accented and hearty chuckle, as he smiled and held her hand tightly, walking towards their childrens&#39; room to check on their progress. The jade wedding rings on both of their ring fingers shone brightly, signifying the martial bond and union that is shared between the two Chinese lovers.<br />
<br />
Honor is absolute.</p>
