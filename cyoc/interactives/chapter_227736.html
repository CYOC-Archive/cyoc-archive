<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“I was actually thinking of asking you to hold onto the key Mr. Clemont.”  Rollo said, curious of how Jeff’s father, Mike, would respond to the idea. <br />
<br />
“Oh, is that so?” Mike smirked with a glint in his eye.<br />
<br />
“Well uh, of course!  I was just thinking that it would be fitting if Jeff’s father had some control over his own son.”  Rollo said as he held out the key. <br />
<br />
“Well.. if you insist.” Jeff’s dad grinned. He graciously took the key before Rollo could give it a second thought. <br />
<br />
“Now let’s just make sure Jeff is on nice and snug.” Mike then reached out and felt Rollo’s caged cock without hesitation.  Rollo briefly shuddered at the unexpected and cold touch.  Mike didn’t comment on it, he only let out a chuckle. <br />
<br />
“Seems like a great fit to me. My boy makes quite the nice accessory if I do say so myself.  I’ll give this back to you when I feel like it.”  Mike said playfully waving the key around. “I think I have a spare chain so I can wear it on my neck.  You both will make quite the conversation starter for me.” Jeff’s father winked. <br />
<br />
Rollo restfully nodded. “Me and Jeff are going to head back to my house now.  If that’s ok with you of course Mr. Clemont.”<br />
<br />
“Fine by me.  Say hello to your father for me Roland.  And Jeff, make sure to keep that boy nice and secure.”<br />
<br />
Roland let out a high pitched “yip!” as he felt Jeff tense up around his member. <br />
<br />
Mike beamed with pride, “that’s my boy.” <br />
<br />
———<br />
<br />
Roland was thankful his backyard was just one fence hop away from Jeff’s.  Sure the chronivac changes likely would save him from too much scrutiny, but he still wasn’t totally keen on streaking. <br />
<br />
Rollo entered his home from the sliding glass backdoor.  He was going to make his way passed the kitchen to the stairs and up to his bedroom.  <br />
<br />
He started to take the first step and was halted by the sound of a refrigerator door.  His father must have been home.  <br />
<br />
Rollo took a deep breath and walked at a brisk pace to his room.  He was halfway up the stairs when his father’s voice called to him. <br />
<br />
“Hey Roland, come here.”<br />
<br />
Jeff in cage form didn’t even need to do anything to make his friend tense up this time. Rollo’s father Devin had a commanding presence all on his own. <br />
<br />
Rollo did a walk of shame back down the stairs.  His father was behind the kitchen counter, and didn’t seem the least bit shocked seeing his son completely naked.  He mainly just focused in on the cage he was wearing with a bit of curiosity. <br />
<br />
“Is that… your friend Jeff?” Devin asked. <br />
<br />
“Um, yeah dad.  We sort of agreed he’d be my chastity cage for a bit…” <br />
<br />
“Hmm, figures.  Was only a matter of time before you two got curious around each other I suppose.  Objects can be a bit insatiable when it comes to carrying out their purpose.  Jeff’s father has the key I presume?”<br />
<br />
Rollo blushed and nodded.  Seems his father knew Jeff’s dad pretty well. <br />
<br />
“That’s fine with me son.  It’ll just be a bit of an annoying work day tomorrow.  Mike loves to revel in being a key holder when he gets the chance.” Devin rolled his eyes.  Clearly Mike’s enthusiasm as a key holder was notorious. <br />
<br />
“Now Roland, don’t try asking me to put in a good word for you with Mike to get you unlocked.  You’re bound to a real man’s code, and so is Jeff there.” Devin said pointing at the cage between his own sons’ legs. <br />
<br />
As Devin walked past the kitchen counter, Rollo realized— his dad was naked from the waist down this entire time!  The chronivac was definitely making people more relaxed about clothing and exposure. And there was something else..<br />
<br />
“Dad.. are YOU wearing a cage?”<br />
<br />
Devin rolled his eyes, “Well I sure as hell wasn’t planning on it, but your brother Kyle here insisted I wear him for a bit. Seems he’s a bit envious of his father’s cock by how much he’s straining me here.  There’s a reason only less endowed men and boys like yourself tend to wear these for long.”<br />
<br />
And just like that, Rollo and Jeff had more knowledge of this new world inexplicably transmitted into their minds by the chronivac.  Apparently in this changed universe, some people were just born with ability to become inanimate objects such as chastity devices and other sexual paraphernalia.  There was no clear details yet on the logistics of any of it.  It was all just how this new world worked apparently. Now it seemed like Rolland’s older brother, Kyle, was  “born” to be chastity device.  Just like Jeff.<br />
<br />
The partial nudity of Rollo’s father was also a quirk of this reality.  It’s mandatory that caged individuals keep their cages exposed at all times. <br />
<br />
“This is just until he finds a new partner, you know how clingy cages can get.” Rollo’s father continued as he traced his finger across the top of his chastity device/oldest son.<br />
<br />
Rollo’s eyes sparked with realization as he looked at the device his father was wearing. That’s right!  Prior to this chronivac world, Rollo’s older brother had been staying in the guest room after he broke up with his breadwinner boyfriend.  In this world, his boyfriend must have served as the ‘partner’ who wore him as a chastity cage! <br />
<br />
Jeff on the other hand was busy admiring Kyle’s chastity cage form.  Stainless steel metal in a crossed pattern that perfectly encased that which Jeff sensed was quite the hung package.  Guess maturity can impact chastity cages because Kyle seemed to be confining his dad’s package like a vault.  Jeff had to admit- he was impressed. <br />
<br />
“What about your- I mean- Kyle’s key?” Rollo said, curious of who his single father’s key holder could possibly be. <br />
<br />
Rollo’s father Gavin raised an eyebrow, “Nice try Roland, but I’m not telling you where I put it.  I’m only locked to placate your brother till he finds a new place.  All you need to know about that key is that it’s somewhere safe.  End of conversation.  Now, why don’t you and Jeff run along upstairs? It’s best to get more acquainted with your room if he’s going to be staying with us for an indeterminate amount of time.”</p>
