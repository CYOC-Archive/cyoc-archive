<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mike was still lying on her bed feeling very sorry for herself when the two twins knocked on her door then entered without waiting for an answer.<br />
<br />
&#39;Err&#39; said Sharon aka Michelle &#39;That haircut was a waste of money. I didn&#39;t think of that. You have reverted to how I was first thing this morning&#39;<br />
<br />
Mike looked up on hearing the voice and saw the twin Mary&#39;s. She couldn&#39;t initially tell who was who. They looked the same and had the same voice. Both were wearing a mix of Mary&#39;s and Sharon&#39;s clothes. &#39;What do you two want. Haven&#39;t you tormented me enough?&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;You need to get ready for work Mum&#39; said the Mary in the leather jacket.<br />
<br />
&#39;Yeah Mum. Someone has to go and earn the money&#39; said the twin in the white skirt.<br />
<br />
&#39;Well it&#39;s not going to be me. You tricked me. I didn&#39;t deserve this&#39; she pointed at herself.<br />
<br />
&#39;It has to be you. Your the only one who can be Sharon now and I really need that job.&#39; said Leather jacket<br />
<br />
That clued Mike into Leather jacket&#39;s real identity &#39;You should have thought of that before you changed me. Why should I help you?&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Yes I admit I didn&#39;t think this out very well. But you did tell us you didn&#39;t want to be Michelle and someone needs to be Sharon. Please do this for me&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;You have really put me into a bad situation. I have no idea of how to be a waitress. I don&#39;t even know where this stupid restaurant is&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;It&#39;s actually really close to the cinema we are going to. I could give you a driving lesson on the way there&#39;<br />
<br />
Mike realised that his Mum was desperate. &#39;Maybe I could do it but I want more than just a driving lesson&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Name your price&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;The medallion. You appropriated it even though I was the one who found it. I want it back and I want to be able to change myself back as soon as my 12 hours are up and I want you to promise to never change me against my will again&#39;<br />
<br />
&quot;So you&#39;ll do it then?&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;If you agree to my terms&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Yes. You be me for the night and attend the restaurant. It will likely just be a training night so shouldn&#39;t be hard. If you do that I will give you the medallion. You can be its custodian&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;And Mary won&#39;t take the medallion off me either or use it on me against my will&#39; Mike turned to the girl in the white skirt.<br />
<br />
&#39;Okay. But can I still use the medallion when I want? If so we have a deal&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Deal!&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Okay with that agreed we have to get you ready for work. You will need to shower and wash that hair. I will get your uniform ready&#39; said Leather jacket, who Mike now knew was his mother.<br />
<br />
Mike sat up on the bed. She wasn&#39;t sure she had obtained the best deal she could have. &#39;Okay but not until you give me the medallion. I intend to keep it in my possession from now on&#39; She actually realised she wasn&#39;t fazed about being Sharon and going out in public. She had got over any embarrassment about wearing skirts last weekend. Waitressing couldn&#39;t be too hard and like the twins said - it would just be a training night.<br />
<br />
Leather jacket returned with the medallion within a minute. Mike took it knowing that for the moment she was immune from more changes. She put it over her head and wore it as a necklace.<br />
<br />
15 minutes later a freshly showered Mike left the shower in her ill fitting Mike clothes. She found herself ushered to the master bedroom. &#39;Simpler if you use this room while you possess my body. I&#39;ll use yours. Here are the clothes you need to wear. They are all brand new. Do you need help getting dressed? If not call me when you are done and I will help you with your hair and make-up&#39;<br />
<br />
Mike had enough pride to say &#39;I&#39;ll dress myself. Do I have to wear those stockings?&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;They are actually pantyhose and yes you need to wear them. I&#39;ll be back in 5&#39;<br />
<br />
Mike needed every second of that 5 minutes to get dressed. She didn&#39;t understand why she had to wear such a lacy bra and panties but guessed maybe that was all Sharon possessed that fit her new chest. Mike was actually quite relieved to put the bra on. These breasts were very heavy. The pantyhose were much harder to put on then Mike imagined. It didn&#39;t help that Mike once more possessed Sharon&#39;s long fingernails. She was worried they would tear the apparently flimsy material. The skirt and top fit perfectly. The white top was some sort of satin and the outline of the bra was obvious under it. <br />
<br />
Leather jacket returned as Mike was doing up the buttons on the shirt. &#39;No leave the top two buttons undone. That blouse is designed to show off a bit of cleavage&#39; Mike didn&#39;t know how to respond but stopped doing up the buttons.&#39;And I don&#39;t think you should continue wearing that medallion. It doesn&#39;t go with your clothes. It might be magical but its pretty ugly&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Well I&#39;m taking it with me and these clothes don&#39;t have proper pockets&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;That&#39;s what handbags are for Mum. You take my bag. It contains everything you will need&#39; Leather jacket emphasised the the word &quot;Mum&quot;<br />
<br />
Mike then sat there as Leather jacket blow dried her hair then put make-up on her. This was no longer a new experience for Mike, she took it in her stride. By the time Leather jacket was satisfied it was time to go. Sharon was expected at the restaurant at 5. The twins were meeting their dates at the nearby cinemas at 6. They said they would spend that time exploring nearby shops.  <br />
<br />
So Mike put on Sharon&#39;s thankfully flat shoes, was given a handbag to carry, into which she had already placed the medallion and ushered out the door. She was given a driving lesson for the 15 minute trip into town, then taken to the front door of the restaurant. &#39;This is it&#39; said Leather jacket. &#39;Tony is the manager who is giving you a trial. He&#39;s about 40 and has a goatee. Remember you look good and you can do anything. Go kill&#39;em girl! Give us a call when are ready to go home. The passcode on what is now your phone is 3579. We&#39;ll go to the gaming arcade when the movie finishes. Good luck&#39;</p>
