<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Slowly consciousness drifted back to Declan and blinking slowly, he thought, &quot;What a great dream. I actually became a thirteen year old girl by finding and using the Amulet of Zulo.&quot;<br />
<br />
With this thought in mind, Declan slowly sat up and looked out the window. Noting that it was dark, he swung his legs off the bed...&quot;Why are the bed covers suddenly so soft and why is my movements different,&quot; Declan asked himself...and stood up. Beneath his feet he could feel the soft carpet and moving across the room, he enjoyed the feeling.<br />
<br />
He reached out for the switch to the light and then paused. &quot;Did I fall asleep wearing one of my outfits,&quot; Declan asked himself as he realised that he could feel the air against his legs and that whatever he was wearing was really tight against his body.<br />
<br />
Attempting to remember, but nothing coming to mind, Declan reached for the light switch and flicking it on, he nearly screamed out loud at what he saw.<br />
<br />
Before his eyes, he saw a girl in a tight red nighty, but then Declan realised that he was looking into a mirror. Taking a step forward to the full body mirror, he took in his appearance and as she did so, Declan came to the conclusion that none of what had occurred hours ago had been a dream.<br />
<br />
Before his eyes, he saw a beautiful thirteen-year old girl with pale skin, soft brown hair that fell about half way down her back, intense and intelligent green eyes, pert B cup size breast and long, smooth legs. Red lingerie covered her body and Declan suddenly realised that it was tighter, form fitting in the bodice and lifting up the skirt section, she saw a underwear like piece that fastened in the center.<br />
<br />
Reaching down, Declan undid the clasps and looked at the bare privates that now made up her genitals. &quot;I've got camel-toe,&quot; Declan thought as she looked at the slightly large lips majour.<br />
<br />
Adjusting the crotch piece, Declan looked away from the mirror and took in her room. While she had slept, the room had shifted until it looked a little like Karen's room, only the tastes were a bit different. White walls with pink hearts along the trim and on the white ceiling were several glow in the dark stars. Next to the bed, which was now had a bright, feminine looking sheets and a comforter covering it, was a nightstand with a lamp and a pink alarm clock.<br />
<br />
Next to the light stand was a dresser with five drawers, the top one open and Declan could see bras, socks, underwear and nylons inside. Squatting down next to the bed, Declan pulled the metal box out from underneath and opening it, she saw the Amulet of Zulo lying inside.<br />
<br />
&quot;But how am I supposed to return to my original form,&quot; Declan asked herself and then realised that she didn't want to.<br />
<br />
Pushing the box back under the bed, Declan stood and noticed that for some reason all the other clothes she had left out were now missing. Bothered by this, wondering what he family would say when they saw her, Declan grabbed a robe from her closet, noticed that it too had changed, shrugged and pulling off the red nighty, she pulled the robe on over her naked body and tying it shut, she prepared to go downstairs.<br />
-------<br />
<br />
In the kitchen, her mother was reading a newspaper and upon seeing Declan, she said, &quot;Evening Darla. Dinner's on the stove if you're hungry.&quot;<br />
<br />
Pausing briefly because of how her mother had just addressed her, Declan/Darla mentally shrugged and figuring it was something she was going to need to adjust to as a girl, went to the stove to get something to eat.<br />
<br />
Sitting down at the table, Darla began to eat as her mother continued to read the paper. After a bit, Denise came in and asked Darla, &quot;Ready for tonight?&quot;<br />
<br />
Unsure, Darla nodded and looking at their mother, Denise asked where Katie and Karen were. Folding up her newspaper, their mother said, &quot;They are spending the night over at their friend's house...Which is okay because they are not ready for what is going to happen to tonight.&quot;<br />
<br />
Trepidation floods Darla and she asked, &quot;What is going to happen.&quot;<br />
<br />
Denise looked at her and grinned as her mother simply explained, &quot;You'll see. It's a big honour for the females in our family. Now, eat your dinner and please just wait another hour. Okay honey?&quot;<br />
<br />
Darla nodded and turned her attention back to her dinner. Afterward, she helped her mother to finish the dishes. After that chore was complete, Denise returned and their mother announced, &quot;I think the hour is at hand. Perhaps we should head outside. Things might get a bit uncomfortable.&quot; Unsure, Darla followed Denise and her mother outside.<br />
<br />
On the back porch, Darla hugged herself and breathed in the warm night air. As she stood there, her mother and sister began to remove their clothes. Bothered by this, she asked them, &quot;What are you doing?&quot;<br />
<br />
Her mother smiled at her and replied, &quot;It's best that you are not wearing anything when it happens. Clothes are so expensive these days.&quot;<br />
<br />
The feeling of trepidation growing, Darla reached down and began to undo her robe. Disrobing, she stood naked as the day she was born, realising suddenly that she was comfortable outside like this. As she stood on the back porch, Denise started to walk toward the edge of the yard and her mother began to explain.<br />
<br />
&quot;Every girl that has ever been born into our family, for the past seven generations that is, has the unique ability to assume an animal form. In this animal form, we have knowledge that most humans never gleam in their entire lives. But, in these forms the animal is dominant...until we learn to control it. By the time we learn to control it, the second nature comes into play...immortality.&quot;<br />
<br />
A pause and Darla thought her mother looked different somehow and then her mother continued.<br />
<br />
&quot;In these animal forms, we are susceptible to a few things. At the top of the list is pregnancy because we are female and our bodies behave like an animal normally does...this includes when we are human, for we do not get a monthly like normal woman but enter a heat cycle two times a year. Once in the spring and once in the autumn. The other majour thing is that we become stuck in the animal form if we're caught and tagged, hooded, collared or shod and will remain like that until the device's  removed. There are other things, but these you must learn on your own.&quot;<br />
<br />
A smile and suddenly Darla realised that her mother was changing. Before her eyes, her mother gained pound upon pound, while a large shaggy coat began to grow in. Within minutes, Darla found herself looking at a full-grown brown bear. From within her head, Darla heard her mother say, &quot;I have been blessed with four beautiful daughters. This is rare because most of our ancestors only bore males, with daughters only coming once out of every nineteenth birth.&quot;<br />
<br />
And the Darla watched her mother lumber off. Question after question raced through her head. But all of them didn't matter as suddenly Darla realised that something was calling her. Forgetting that at one time she was a male, Darla began to move across the backyard. When she reached the edge, she dropped to all fours and began to move, feeling comfortable like that.<br />
<br />
As she moved outward into the world, knowing that for some reason she would be back before morning, Darla breathed in the night air, not realising that a thick grey coat was forming and a bushy stripped tail was pushing out of her spine.</p>
