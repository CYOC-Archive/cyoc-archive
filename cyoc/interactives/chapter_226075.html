<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Sarah is 16, has long hair that ends just above her butt which she has dyed pink, she has blue eyes, C-cups, an athletic figure and stands at 5&#39;7&#39;&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
Amanda &quot;Amy&quot; is 14, has blond hair which reach just past her shoulders and which she always styles in twin tails, she has green eyes and B-cup sized breasts. Like Sarah, Amanda has an athletic figure but is at least a head shorter than Sarah, Amanda&#39;s height is &quot;only&quot; at 5&#39;3&#39;&#39;.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After a while, Jeff decides to transfer the program onto his phone and take it to school, hoping he’ll have a chance to try it out there, maybe he could use it on someone he dislikes.<br />
<br />
The next morning, Jeff gets up and gets himself ready for school, after a quick breakfast, the teen heads to the bus stop and is soon on his way to school.<br />
<br />
When Jeff arrives at his school, he realizes that he is one of the first to arrive, “he… well, this is a first,” he says to himself, “usually I’m one of the last to arrive. Well, that gives me time to come up with some ideas what I want to try with the App.”<br />
<br />
As Jeff walks down the hallway, which leads to his locker, he notices someone walking towards him which causes him to frown. The person is none other than Sarah Jones, a stuck up rich girl, who always is mean to Jeff and his friends. Normally Jeff would ignore her, but something out of the ordinary catches his attention, for one: Sarah is usually accompanied by a short girl named Amanda “Amy” Thomas, who, like Sarah, is a rich brat, but today she seems to not hang around Sarah, which is unusual, because Amanda is like Sarah’s “lap-dog”: always doing the taller girl’s bidding. The other thing that Jeff notices is that Sarah seems to look rather upset, usually the pink haired girl is always smirking, but today she actually seemed to be rather down.<br />
<br />
‘I wonder what is up with her,’ Jeff thinks to himself, even though Jeff hates Sarah, he can’t help but feel a need to try and cheer her up a little, that is just the person Jeff is: no matter who, he always tries to be friendly and see the best in people, even in his worst enemies.<br />
<br />
Jeff watches Sarah walk by him, the girl not even bothered to insult him, which she usually does, ‘damn… she really seems upset about something,’ he thinks to himself, ‘I’d like to know what the issue is. Maybe there is something I can do that would cheer her up, but I doubt she’d even acknowledge me, but at least I tried,’ so Jeff hurries after the girl, who just disappeared around a corner.<br />
<br />
When Jeff rounds the corner, he sees Sarah walking down an empty hall, “SARAH,” he calls, “WAIT UP!”<br />
<br />
The girl, who is the same height as Jeff, standing at 5’7’’ and who has an athletic and perfect formed feminine body with C-cup breasts, turns and scowls when she sees Jeff walking up to her.<br />
<br />
“What do you want, loser,” she asks, trying her best to sound as mean as usual, but Jeff can clearly hear the hurt in her voice, “where are your loser friends?”<br />
<br />
“I haven’t seen them today,” Jeff says, as he reaches the girl, “they tend to show up late. And to answer your question: I couldn’t help but notice that you seem in some way hurt, I would like to know what’s up.”<br />
<br />
Sarah snorts, “why would you, of all people, care about how I feel,” she asks, “besides, why would I tell a loser like you? You’re nothing but a pervy nerd who just wants to get his hands on MY attractive body!”<br />
<br />
Jeff ignores her insults, “listen,” he says, “I know we don’t get along, which I honestly don’t understand, I never did anything to you. That’s beside the point, I really hate seeing you so upset, so I’d like to know what happened.”<br />
<br />
Sarah scowls, “just leave me alone,” she says and turns around to leave and starts to walk away.<br />
<br />
“What if I told you, that I have something that will most defiantly cheer you up,” Jeff says, “something, someone like you, who loves to humiliate, torture and spread rumours around, would find absolute joy in.”<br />
<br />
Hearing this causes Sarah to stop in her tracks, the girl slowly turns around, frowning at at Jeff, “what are you talking about,” she asks.<br />
<br />
Jeff walks up to the girl, “if you tell me what got you so upset,” he says, “I’ll tell you everything. I promise: it’ll be worth it… for the both of us!”<br />
<br />
Sarah still frowns, but Jeff can tell that the girl is thinking it over, “okay, fine,” she then says, “but I don’t want anyone to see us together, so follow me to the gym, no one will be there around this time.”<br />
<br />
Jeff follows the girl to the gym, which isn’t a long walk, after 15 minutes they arrive at their destination. The girl opens the door to the gym and they both enter, then Jeff follows Sarah to the equipment storage, once they are in the room, Sarah turns to face Jeff, “so, what is this all about,” she asks, her arms crossed and leaning against a pommel horse.<br />
<br />
“First, you tell me what has you all upset,” Jeff says, “then I tell you.”<br />
<br />
Sarah scowls, “fine,” she snaps, then she takes a deep breath, “where to start? First, Amy decided to fall ill. Then some old perv decided to grope my butt and finally your friend Katrina posted something about me on the internet, which is a total lie!”<br />
<br />
“Okay, damn,” Jeff says, “sorry to hear that. I can’t believe Katrina would do such a thing though. She is the kindest person in the world.”<br />
<br />
Sarah snorts at this, “that’s what YOU think, because that bitch is actually worse than me,” she says, “I should know, because… we… we were friends… a long time ago.”<br />
<br />
Jeff’s eyes widen, “she never told me,” he says, “so… that’s why you treat her the way you do, and since she hangs around with me and the others, you pull us into the… issue you two have?”<br />
<br />
“That sums it up,” the girl says, “now, tell me about this… thing you brought with you.”<br />
<br />
Jeff, wanting to know more what has happened between Sarah and Katrina, decides it’ll be best to not push it further, instead he takes out his phone, “this,” he says.<br />
<br />
Sarah raises an eyebrow, “what,” she asks, “you want to give me your loser phone? That thing is so eeeew and totally outdated!”<br />
<br />
Jeff chuckles, “no, it’s something ON my phone,” he says, ‘I might regret it, but I can’t bare to see her so upset,’ he thinks to himself, so he starts explaining everything to the girl.<br />
<br />
After Jeff is finished explaining everything to Sarah, the girl looks more than confused, “really? A program that is able to alter the reality, not only that, but also has transformation powers,” she asks. Jeff nods, causing Sarah to snort, “as if. You really should stop hanging around those sci-fi nerds!”<br />
<br />
“Okay,” Jeff says, “I guess I should show you some proof then.”<br />
<br />
“Like what,” Sarah asks.<br />
<br />
“Well, I could change my hair colour,” Jeff suggests.<br />
<br />
“Hm… okay,” Sarah says.<br />
<br />
Jeff nods and types into his phone, ‘I hope it works,’ he thinks to himself as he confirms the input.<br />
<br />
Once he confirmed the edit, Jeff feels his head tingle, then he notices the girl’s eyes widen, “so, I guess it worked?”<br />
<br />
Sarah nods, looking Jeff in disbelief, “there is no way you could suddenly have blond hair instead of black without dying it,” she says.<br />
<br />
Jeff smiles, “so, I guess that is enough to convince you,” he asks.<br />
<br />
Sarah nods, “yeah, but I still don’t know what you are up to,” she says, looking sceptical at Jeff, “you’re not planning on using it on me, are you?”<br />
<br />
“No, I had something else in mind,” Jeff says.<br />
<br />
“Like what,” Sarah asks.<br />
<br />
“Well, Amanda is ill,” he says.<br />
<br />
“So,” Sarah says.<br />
<br />
“Let me finish,” Jeff says, “what would you say if I would transform into her and spend the day as her replacement?”<br />
<br />
Sarah raises an eye brow, “why would you want to do that,” she asks, “just so you can see her naked?”<br />
<br />
“No,” Jeff says, “I want to do it, because I don’t want to see you so sad. Because, the way I judge you, you have more fun being mean to others when Amanda is with you. I never saw you being mean when she is not around, you then tend to just avoid others.”<br />
<br />
Sarah tilts her head and frowns, “and you’d be okay with being mean to your friends,” she asks.<br />
<br />
Jeff shrugs, “for one, they wouldn’t know it’s me, for two, they kinda let me hanging a lot lately, which causes me to be a little mad at them, and three: I think it’ll be nice to take my frustration out on them without them being aware that it’s actually me.”<br />
<br />
“And you are aware that it won’t be just until the school is over,” Sarah says, “because, after school Amy and I usually go to the mall with our friends. Which would mean: you’d need to stay a girl until late this afternoon.”<br />
<br />
Jeff nods, “I am aware of that,” he says, “so, would you like me to be “Amanda”, at least for a day? I mean… would it cheer you up? Or do you have something else in mind?”</p>
