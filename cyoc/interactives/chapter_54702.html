<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As sunlight came into the various rooms of Wolf Manor, those who had been resting awoke to greet the new day, and for many, to relieve those who had been up all night. In his room, Roger stretched and found Amethyst cuddled up to one side while Jasmine was on the other side. Terri and Sandi weren't there.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good morning, dears,&quot; Roger spoke politely as his two present mates began to awaken from their own slumber.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good morning, cutie,&quot; Amethyst smiled and gave Roger a few good licks, &quot;sleep well?&quot;<br />
<br />
The pastel green male nodded and hugged the amethyst colored she-wolf.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's good to see you're safe and sound and with us again,&quot; Roger told her.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know that Alpha Jensen would not rest while Kurse had us,&quot; Amethyst hugged him back, &quot;He cares for all of us.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;As I care for you,&quot; Roger nodded as he pulled Jasmine into the hug as well.<br />
<br />
Jasmine smiled at the affection, but soon turned to other matters.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is wonderful, darling,&quot; Jasmine spoke, &quot;but we'd best report in. The pups and the teen wolves missed their classes yesterday, and I'm sure the Pride's cubs need to get to school.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The joys of learning,&quot; Amethyst cheered and hopped up.<br />
<br />
For the most part, the Pack's pups were home schooled, to avoid some bureaucrat messing up the names of the pups. Amethyst, Martha, Abdul, Ryan, and Maddex all shared the responsibilities of educating the youngest pups while Whitney, Wendy, and Rose worked as tutors for the teen wolves. All of them had passed the certifications needed to accepted as educators, and Jensen and Kaylee had gone through the backbreaking legal work to insure that the pups' education wouldn't be ignored by those who preferred public schools.<br />
<br />
But, no one was opposed to letting anyone go to public school if they wished, and once they got to the college level, if any of the Pack wished to go that far, a school outside of the Pack's estate would be mandatory. And it was rumored that Bart and Jenny were expected to go to college once they were old enough, mostly to make their already brilliant business and legal knowledge official. Mostly to insure that there would be no wrinkles when Jenny took over Kaylee's practice, and Bart took over the management of the Pack's business investments.<br />
<br />
Amethyst enjoyed the teaching, despite the thoughts by some members of the Pack that she was ill-suited to the job. After all, she was far smarter then she let on.<br />
<br />
&quot;And our Pack mates and friends to look after,&quot; Roger nodded as he slowly got up.<br />
<br />
The three got up and slowly got up.<br />
<br />
+++++++++<br />
<br />
Mother Glen calmly got up in the room that she and Gillian II had been given to sleep in. She had been amazed by the quality of the beds that were at the manor. They easily supported her weight without the slightest hint of strain. A new day had begun, and with it a repetition of responsibilities that was always needed. Mary and her half sisters and Tano and her sisters needed to get to school. The fact that their parents were injured had screwed up their standard routine, but Mother Glen figured it was the least she could do to insure that some resemblance of routine was followed... and Blackie would partially help, loyal friend and determined protector that he was.<br />
<br />
&quot;Where are you off to?&quot; Gillian asked from behind her, &quot;it's early.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The cubs will need to get to school,&quot; Mother Glen told him, &quot;and since Gary, Brian, and Felicity aren't entirely able, I must step in.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What about the Pack's pups?&quot; Gillian asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;To my knowledge, Jensen has them home schooled,&quot; Mother Glen answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can I come with you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course,&quot; Mother Glen nodded.<br />
<br />
++++++++<br />
<br />
Jensen, Fran, and Kaylee slept a little later then the others but still were awoken by the warmth of the sunlight coming in.<br />
<br />
&quot;Darlings!&quot; Fran exclaimed and pulled Jensen and Kaylee into a strong hug, &quot;you're okay!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course,&quot; Jensen answered and hugged her back, &quot;all we needed was some sleep. I trust you're rested after all the major medical work?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Largely,&quot; Fran nodded as they got up, &quot;though I'd suppose Julie and Darla and the rest of the night shift needs to be relieved. Let them rest.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jensen nodded and began to make his way out. He wanted to check on those in the medical wing, and guessed that Kaylee would want to check on her sisters as well. He found Terri and Sandi still standing guard.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good morning Alphas, and Beta Fran,&quot; Terri and Sandi spoke, though not in perfect unison.<br />
<br />
&quot;You both look tired,&quot; Fran commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;Julie did not want anyone to disturb your sleep,&quot; Terri answered, &quot;so we stood guard and as a go-between for anyone wishing to speak with you while you slept.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Was there anything?&quot; Jensen asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; Sandi answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Best get something to eat and then get some rest yourselves,&quot; Kaylee offered, &quot;Most of everyone will be getting breakfast soon.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, Alpha Female,&quot; Terri and Sandi answered and then made their way toward the dining area.<br />
<br />
As Jensen and two of his wives made their way into the hallway, they came across Anne and Beatrice coming down the hallway.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good morning,&quot; they said politely.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good morning,&quot; Jensen returned the greeting, &quot;breakfast needs to be prepared. Anne, if you would get things ready for those in the medical wing... Beatrice would you get things ready for those of us that will be eating in the dining hall.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course.&quot; &quot;At once.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jensen nodded as the two hustled off and then turned to check on those in the medical wing, and made only a few steps when he came to Mother Glen coming their way from one of the guest rooms. Gillian II was behind her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good morning, Alpha Jensen,&quot; Mother Glen spoke politely, &quot;I must speak with you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm going to check on the others in the medical wing before breakfast,&quot; Jensen spoke, &quot;You can talk as we go.&quot;<br />
<br />
The snow-white lioness nodded and proceeded to walk alongside Jensen as they made their way down the main staircase. None of noticed Kaylee giving a smile to Kira as they went past the statue.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know recent events concerning the Curse has had you busy, but as the Pride's Matriarch and with the parents of the cubs here incapable of sending them to school, I must insure they get there,&quot; Mother Glen spoke, &quot;They've likely missed more then enough already as a result of the fight with Kurse.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They're not home-schooled?&quot; Kaylee asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;That's been a sort of &quot;on the fence&quot; issue with the Pride,&quot; Mother Glen explained, &quot;and since no one's made firm decision, they will go to public school until a decision can be made. As it's no excuse to ignore an education because the Pride's adults are wondering about whether or not its the best option.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm not about to stop you if you think your Pride's cubs need to go,&quot; Jensen answered, &quot;they may be under the Pack's protection while on the estate, but raising them is your responsibility. I won't tread on it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You will help?&quot; Gillian asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ulysses and Sarah will likely help the most,&quot; Jensen answered, &quot;Ulysses has been friends with Mary, despite their age difference, and Sarah looks at Ulysses as a brother... even though they aren't related by blood.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But their fur might as well be the same color,&quot; Gillian spoke.<br />
<br />
&quot;Chiyoye and Zack are not related to me by blood, and we are all some shade of black,&quot; Jensen pointed out.<br />
<br />
&quot;I see,&quot; Gillian nodded, guessing that the similarity was just a coincidence.<br />
<br />
&quot;I thank you for your help,&quot; Mother Glen told Jensen, already knowing that Sarah and Ulysses weren't brother and sister.<br />
<br />
&quot;It is no problem,&quot; Jensen nodded.<br />
<br />
++++++++<br />
<br />
The pup's room awoke with the a little more noise then most of other rooms.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's morning!&quot; Jay cheered as he jumped down from his bed, &quot;Morning! A new day!&quot;<br />
<br />
Pence was quick to join him.<br />
<br />
&quot;What will we do today?&quot; Zulema wondered from her bed.<br />
<br />
&quot;We're all likely to return to our studies now that all the chaos involving the curse is over,&quot; came Bart's voice from the bed where Jensen and Kaylee's pups slept.<br />
<br />
&quot;Awwww,&quot; came the groan from the others.<br />
<br />
&quot;I suppose this means we'll have to go to school today,&quot; Mary commented to Moja on the bed that she and her half sisters were on.<br />
<br />
&quot;I suppose,&quot; Moja commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nothing wrong with an education,&quot; Mr. P said from his place in the center of the room, &quot;helps keep the mind sharp and hopefully trains one to a productive member of society... and considering that we're balancing three sentient races, two of which being apex predators, in a fairly small area, it's important.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tano and Moja nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can't the cubs stay with us?&quot; Gretchen asked, &quot;Miss Amethyst's very smart.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Their education is not our responsibility,&quot; Mr. P answered, &quot;they'd have to want to, and their parents, and or Snow-white would have to approve of it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Awwww,&quot; Gretchen gave a low whine.<br />
<br />
They were then cut off by a startled scream.<br />
<br />
&quot;SAMANTHA!&quot; came Alice and Abbey's voice from inside the mirror in the room<br />
<br />
They all looked up to see the two nervously looking about the reflection of the room and calling for their sister, not knowing that she was listening to Marie's story elsewhere in the mirrorverse. This raised more commotion in the room, as Mr. P tried to calm his youngest great grandchildren down (even though Alice was six months older then Marcy and Kevin), which brought Martha and Whitney coming quickly into the room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Miss Martha! Samantha's gone!&quot; Alice cried as the gray furred omega made her entrance.<br />
<br />
&quot;Our sister!&quot; Abbey whimpered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is fine,&quot; Martha assured them, &quot;she woke up after you returned from bringing back the deer from the island. She has taken Maddex into the mirrorverse in search of his pups and Betty and Lawrence... though they should be somewhere in the manor.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then we must go to her,&quot; Alice spoke, &quot;make sure she's alright.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sure she's fine, dears,&quot; Martha said assuringly, &quot;why don't you get some breakfast first... and you also have today's lessons to consider.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not without our sister!&quot; Alice and Abbey vowed, &quot;she's been through so much.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;At least have breakfast then,&quot; Martha pleaded, &quot;Your mothers were likely up all night tending to those wounded in the battle. They will likely be going to bed after breakfast. I'm certain that Samantha is fine. With Kurse gone there is no malevolent presence that can invade your world.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alice and Abbey traded glances and then sighed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, Miss Martha,&quot; they replied.</p>
