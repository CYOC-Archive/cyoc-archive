<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Lina felt sore, almost in a good way for some reason, her breasts felt heavy, and tight, and sensitive to the touch.<br />
<br />
Looking to her right she saw Viki, her face painted with plesure &quot;What just happened&quot; she moaned, cupping her hands under her breasts<br />
<br />
&quot;I have no idea&quot; said said Sofia from behind the sofa &quot;but thies kids have me pined here&quot; she said as Lina herd groaning and struggling from behind her, turning to see, she had to do a double take of who lay on the floor.<br />
<br />
It was Sofia alright, but sher figure looked completely different, her one small rounded baby bump had become a full on Maternal swell, its translucent surface stretched to its limit, Lina watched as the now Six young stur and stretch, getting accustomed to their new home<br />
<br />
&quot;You know you can&#39;t be down there anymore sis&quot; said Momo chuckling<br />
&quot;Are you stuck?&quot; Said Momo trying to stifle her laughter &quot;I&#39;m not stuck, I&#39;m just getting a different view of the room&quot; said Sofia making a pout<br />
<br />
&quot;Yep she&#39;s stuck&quot; said Viki as she began to snicker. &quot;Ok fine I am&quot; said Sofia defeated &quot;is everyone just going to stair or is someone going to help me up&quot; she said, folding her hands across her chest, letting out a frustrated huff.<br />
<br />
&quot;We need to talk&quot; Lina had herd that voice before, it was the medallion, but it had never wanted to talk before<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Lina, Honey, you doing OK over there?&quot; Said Lucy, a concerned look on her face &quot;your eyes are... ummmmm.....their different&quot;<br />
<br />
Linas eyes were indeed different, under the medallions influence, had changed to resemble that of a snakes, glowing with a jade green light.<br />
<br />
&quot;Umm, just give me a moment&quot; said Lina as she rushed off into the bathroom, locking the door behind her before turning and looking in the mirror <br />
<br />
&quot;Ok I know you can hear me, since you never shut up&quot; she said to her reflection, before the medallion appeared infront of her, it looked like it was barely holding itself together anymore, small tendrils of green mist clinging on to fragmented, floating shards of gold, those tendrils were flickering, almost fazing in and out of existence, causing the medallion to continously brake appart then attempt to pull itself pack together.<br />
<br />
&quot;So we finally meet&quot; said the voice, but it sounded more solid, less of an echo to it, when Lina looked away from the medallion she saw her reflection, only it wasn&#39;t her reflection.<br />
<br />
The mirror had turned black, with green mist pooling out of the base before becoming a liquid, Lina watched as the green liquid pooled into the sink and down the drain, but it left no mark, almost like it was never there<br />
<br />
Then she saw her, a woman dressed in green, her arms and every bit of what would be exposed skin was composed entirely of that green mist, the only exception being her face, or lack there of.<br />
<br />
Her face was a simple porselin mask, bone white with a snake head on its forehead, then Lina watched as two snakes appeared out of the mist of her arms, they seemed to take the mist from her arms to form their bodies, soon once the process was completed, they draped themselves over her shoulders, their coils wrapped around the mist of her legs<br />
<br />
&quot;So who are these....guys?.......girls?&quot; Asked Lina, how was she supposed to know the gender of mystical smoke snakes!?<br />
<br />
&quot;They are without gender, as I am&quot; said the medallion, now that one caught Lina off guard &quot;well your clearly a woman, you clearly look like you have all the boxes checked for me to call you that&quot; said Lina looking the mist woman up and down<br />
<br />
&quot;I am mearly projecting an image that is best suited for this realty&quot; said the woman, her snakes looking at eachother noding in agreement &quot;but you may refer to me as a she.......being as I possess no name&quot; said the woman almost sadly<br />
<br />
Lina thought on this &quot;Well how about I give you a na-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;DONT!&quot; said the woman suddenly, her snakes rearing up and hissing, puffing out what looked simular to the hood of a king cobra &quot;to be given a name is to brake the seal&quot; she said, her snakes drooping back down, with sad looks in their eyes<br />
<br />
&quot;I am made to serve my master, until I am unable to do so anymore&quot; she said as her eyes drifted to her medallion.<br />
<br />
Lina followed her gaze, realising what was happening, &quot;your dying aren&#39;t you&quot; said Lina<br />
&quot;Yes, yes I am, in a way, upon the last wish the medallion will crack, sealing me inside untill the end of my days&quot; she sighed.<br />
<br />
This caused Lina to think long and hard, thinking of what she should do, what could she do, then she had a plan, a trick if you will, she wasn&#39;t going to alow someone to die if she had anything to do about it, that fact was relevant to everyone including magical mist reflection ladies.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok then echo what do you want me to do&quot; said Lina with a smile<br />
<br />
&quot;Well we could start wi-&quot; suddenly echo stopped as her most spiraled up her body, and she began to laugh, tears of joy streaming down her cheeks &quot;your smarter than I thought, for a mortal&quot; said Echo as her arms returned to normal<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m real.....I&#39;m finally real, and my name is......ECHO!&quot; she said, as if announcing it to the world<br />
<br />
Lina smiled, she had set her free, given her a name, given her life &quot;and she won&#39;t be the last&quot; she said rubbing her belly<br />
<br />
&quot;Well you might as well get in some practice&quot; came Echos voice, as green mist spiraled up out of the floor, and when it dispersed, there stood a eight year old girl, with a blue plastic body, covered in jade green snake designs, her hands and feet were translucent and glowing, and her hair was midnight black, exactly like Linas, she wore what looked to be a white and gold toga, it looked ancient, like it had come straight from a Greek museum, then her eyes opened, glowing and pure green, no white of her eye, no iris and no pupil, just pure jade green.<br />
<br />
Then Echo spoke, her voice several pitches higher, but Lina definitely recognised her voice, it was definitely her<br />
<br />
Linas attention was then drawn back to the medallion, its surface fusing back together and turning into jade, a golden snake formed, circling in the air and biting down on its own tail, it then floated over to Echo and placed itself around her neck, the jade medallion falling down so it rested in the center of her chest, and with that it looked like someone sent a jolt of electricity through the small girl, she suddenly jumped and her head began whizzing around the room, before falling flat on her face<br />
<br />
&quot;Umm a little help please?&quot; Came Echos muffled voice as her legs kicked up and down, Lina chuckled and scooped her up, sitting her on the rim of the bathtub <br />
<br />
&quot;Echo?&quot; She asked, the little girl who was apparently echo nodded eagerly<br />
<br />
&quot;Yep it&#39;s me, and I underestimated you mortals, I never knew that movement felt so exhilarating!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Um Lina......who&#39;s in there with you?&quot; Came Vikis concerned voice, Lina smiled at Echo and took her hand, helping her learn to use her legs<br />
<br />
&quot;Lets go introduce you shall we sweetie?&quot;</p>
