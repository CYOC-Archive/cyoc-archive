<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Chad went ahead and slipped on the sword and sorcery style Barbarian Hero loincloth. He was already reminded of Schwarzenegger&#39;s classic movie that brought him into the social consciousness. If the whole high school -> College athletics idea didn&#39;t work out, and he couldn&#39;t get work with his dad&#39;s company, he intended to become a fitness model / bodybuilder, much in the same vein as early Arnold. After all, Chad had the body for it - but that was a what if case. Sure his grades in school needed some work, but he was doing well enough to keep with his athletics program. And despite not exactly being <i>booksmart</i>, Chad was a savant on the field. Coach even went as far as saying he was one of their best quarterbacks in years.<br />
<br />
So while there might not be much chance of that back up plan, it was at least a fun idea to contemplate.<br />
<br />
The muscular young athlete flexed his quadriceps as he walked forward, feeling the dirt and the grass under his feet. He almost thought his quads looked a little bigger today, even more swelteringly powerful. He guessed it might&#39;ve been those times he put extra focus on the squats. He didn&#39;t even feel particularly worried from having his feet bare as he walked into the fieldhouse area. The door was left just slightly ajar, and Chad&#39;s smile broadened as he felt the slightest bit of warm air drifting out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yeah,&quot; he murmured to himself, &quot;I&#39;m gonna have some fun tonight.&quot; A step closer, and Chad ran a hand through his nicely thick hair. The curly blond locks almost seeming a little thicker still - making him contemplate the need to get a haircut. But he could take care of that when he wasn&#39;t getting his rocks off.<br />
<br />
Chad found that the door was perplexingly heavy, unlike any time before when he&#39;d walked into the fieldhouse for a nice long fuck after a day&#39;s practice in the football field. He tilted his head as he forced the door open - and he was only more confused as he walked in to see that the fieldhouse seemed to have undergone a substantial metamorphosis. The interior - clashing with the look of the exterior - seemed almost like some sort of old style inn. The front desk seemed vacant, and there were a number of tables and chairs resting around the area.<br />
<br />
&quot;Somebody either redecorated the place while I was out, or Diego Cruz needs to stop trying to get me to do the extra strong stuff with him. I already told ya, man, I don&#39;t do the Ayahuasca shit.&quot; Chad murmured to himself as he let the door, perplexingly heavy even still, fall shut behind him - and near on immediately he could hear the sound of a whipping gale outside. Like nothing he&#39;d ever heard from the school area.<br />
<br />
He looked around as he acclimated to the area. Getting less and less concerned as he evaluated his surroundings. Resting in the corner, near one of the chairs, was a complimentary set to what he had on now. Furred shoulder guards, a chest piece that would bare his stomach, a huge, powerful black iron sword that looked almost too big to really be called a sensible sword. Massive, thick, heavy and rough at the edges. It almost struck him like a heap of iron. A sheath for it rested by the weapon. A pair of gauntlets wrought of leather and fur rested by the sword, and fur covered boots on the floor.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the fuck...?&quot; Chad murmured. This was all getting way, way outside what he thought was sensible and in any way like the usual hook up. From the way the entire place here seemed to be restructured. To the way there was an actual, fully functional looking weapon and armor set just...laid out right where he&#39;d look... Chad contemplated just turning tail and leaving. But he remembered Karen Sinclair. Remembered her situation with her parents, and his longing for her.<br />
<br />
Chad Jones was many things, but he was not a coward. He didn&#39;t just run away. Even as he thought that, he didn&#39;t notice a slight bit more hair growing in on his usually shaven chest. Which responded in turn by if anything growing even more statuesque and built than usual. &quot;Karen? Uhh. Miss Karen Sinclair? Are you...Are you here?&quot;<br />
<br />
His voice almost seemed deeper than usual - almost older even, which made Chad grip his throat briefly. Something seemed different. He dropped his hands to his sides. This was getting to be weird...just plain weird. But he wasn&#39;t gonna give up now. Not when he was, he told himself, so close to the goal.<br />
<br />
But his confusion only escalated as he looked further. There was a staircase leading up to a number of inn rooms, marked <b>1</b> thru <b>8</b>. The rooms were definitely not there before. In fact, the Fieldhouse had never had this kind of two story environ before. It&#39;d always only ever been one story. All they needed. But someone somehow added a story, a story that had not been visible from the outside looking in. Chad was beginning to consider there was something really weird going on...<br />
<br />
His consideration was interrupted however by the sound of someone getting up and walking. Which he could hear all the way from downstairs due in part to the construction. Everything just echoed through this place.<br />
<br />
And from one of the doors walked the objective from this whole strange adventure. Dressed every bit as strangely as he was now. Karen Sinclair - walking down the steps slowly while dressed in a black fabric bikini top with long sleeves hugging her toned, busty and beautiful body. A pair of silvery spiked shoulder guards rested on her shoulders, a pair of thin silver gauntlets on her arms. Her long red hair drifted down her back. Her feet were covered in what looked like metallic heels. Her waist covered by a black, tattered skirt.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m glad you showed up today, Chad,&quot; She said as she walked down the stairs, one step at a time. Chad&#39;s eyes glued to the incredible body covered in the impossible attire. This was all getting fucking weird. Like a real version of some kind of faire. As she walked down, Chad was so focused on her beauty and odd attire he didn&#39;t even notice his glance at her was shifting - his height increasing with every step. Prior, Chad had been six foot three. Now he was inching closer to six foot eight. And in turn, his body rippled and grew heavier to compensate - keeping to his brawny appearance and if anything growing larger still. This produced a feeling that left Chad trying not to reel and show unease. He didn&#39;t want her to think he was a wimp!<br />
<br />
As she got to the floor, she immediately walked over to him, and he, confused as he was, just let her kiss him. The tenderness and sexual touch she introduced calming his nerves after what had turned into quite an unusual excursion. He heard her take off one of her gauntlets, letting it land on the ground, then the other in turn, and felt her running her hands through his hair. All of his hair. Which seemed again thicker than usual, and he could feel her hands traveling through some in the back he didn&#39;t have when he woke up this morning. Between kisses, she murmured to him, &quot;You have no idea...how vital it was...that we do this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Whuh...&quot; Chad flushed a little red in the face in the midst of the passionate make out, &quot;What are we <i>doing?</i> What&#39;s going---&quot; She then kissed him again, and he shivered and pumped his hips as he felt her hand cup and stroke his cock right through his loincloth. He moaned into her mouth, becoming more passionate about this in turn. Feeling her hands roaming his body - he found himself starting to take off her bikini top, minding the shoulder pads.<br />
<br />
Once she had him stirred up enough, she pulled back a little, smiling mischievously as he tried to follow her mouth a little bit, left standing there, aroused and confused. &quot;Karen...?&quot; He murmured.<br />
<br />
&quot;Chad, there&#39;s...a lot you don&#39;t know about me.&quot; She then moved in closer to him again, letting her hand stroke his enhanced musculature, feeling every ridge of his powerfully built form. He&#39;d ascended past simply star athlete. And as she rubbed at that large bulge in his loincloth, Karen explained, &quot;My name wasn&#39;t always Karen Sinclair. I was adopted. I&#39;m the last living descendant...of Xalodar the Ancient. A sorcerer. His blood concentrated and embodied one final time in me, granting me the whole of his mystical abilities...&quot;<br />
<br />
It seemed she figured the best way to get Chad&#39;s attention was to do so while delighting him this particular way. He was divided though in his attention between the hands on his cock, and the things the woman with those hands was saying to him. He bit his lip momentarily, and said, &quot;Karen...Karen that&#39;s <i>crazy</i>. You&#39;re...you&#39;re...&quot; He stopped as he had to let a long, ragged moan out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I know.&quot; Karen continued as she kissed his upper chest while teasing him further down there, &quot;But it&#39;s true. The whole of my time at school, none of the men I consorted with could provide what I needed. And for a long time, it confused me. But now...&quot; She pulled back, and looked Chad in the eyes, &quot;Now I understand why. Chad, I needed someone powerful already. And you were the best athlete at the school, bar none. Probably even in the whole county. So you were the best bet to receive this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But what&#39;s going on?&quot; He shivered - wanting to continue their activities, but also yearning for answers. He felt so different, but so confused. His head kind of hurt - he could feel something like a million lessons pouring into his brain. In a mere moment, it was like he could actually see how to use that sword over there. He knew somehow how to put on all that armor. Like it was second nature to him. His muscles tensed, movements he never anticipated before being woven into his experience.<br />
<br />
&quot;Chad, the way it works is simple...&quot; Lady Sinclair spoke in a somewhat wistful voice. &quot;After our rendezvous today, I&#39;ll leave this middle place, between our world and the other one. The one like the ancient world. And until you defeat my armies and many lieutenants, and take the fight to me, I&#39;ll remain beyond your grasp. Defeat my armies formed by my magic and enchantments, defeat me...and then you can have me, as long and as hard as you want.&quot;<br />
<br />
Chad&#39;s mind raced even as he watched her lick her lips and then move in again, kissing him on the lips. He had never anticipated this. Never considered the possibility. His world had seemed so grounded, so usual, so typical. There was a way things happened, and without these sorts of strange occurrences. He&#39;d lived a normal if enriched suburban life - and now he was... he was to be her barbarian hero to clash with the evil sorceress role she&#39;d so chosen.<br />
<br />
She whispered into his ear as she moved down to kiss his neck, &quot;Slay your enemies, enjoy the many women you&#39;ll find in your journey, and ally with those familiar sorts you find.&quot; Even as she kissed down his chest, Chad grunted as he felt one last bit a of muscular growth spurt that pushed him into the dimensions of a barbarian hero. <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll...&quot; Chad breathed as he looked down, &quot;I&#39;ll defeat you...&quot; He gasped as she pushed his loincloth down, taking his cock - which if anything seemed slightly bigger than usual - into her mouth. She swirled her tongue around the head, her devious ways pushing him toward the upper limits of delight. He let his arms flex and hold by his sides, his teeth grit tight as she the dark sorceress pushed him further and further. Chad managed to get out, &quot;G-Gaah...I&#39;ll defeat you. I&#39;ll fight---fight through your armies...&quot; His eyes almost rolled back from the sheer sensory delight but he managed to keep control.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll vanquish every fucking thing you set against me. And at the end...&quot; Right when he was about to say something he couldn&#39;t hold it back any longer. She was simply too skilled at this sexual game. He let out almost a roar as the pleasure rushed through his body. A few scars from the new barbarian&#39;s past etching on his upper arm, one across his back, and a rugged light scar at the jawline. His orgasm hit him harder than it ever had before. Muscles tightening and flexing...<br />
<br />
And for her part, Karen Sinclair simply swallowed everything his cock emitted. His manhood twitched and shot with a heavier load than he&#39;d ever seen before...and she just handled it like a pro. Like nothing was even at all new or challenging about this. She was a woman who could handle this kind of enormous, powerful man - and even as Chad registered the changes that came with his new barbarian past being inserted into his life, he was <i>into that.</i><br />
<br />
Once she was sure all the cum had been milked from him, she drew back and licked her lips. Still unbothered. She flicked her fingers, and her armor returned to her form on its own. A light smirk showing on her face as she looked Chad over, &quot;Oh, I do look forward to the clash, barbarian.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You know I&#39;ll be there at the end, sorceress.&quot; Chad responded. He found this...all remarkably odd but somehow becoming increasingly normal. He could both recall his usual normal life, being the top jock at the school, the most promising quarterback they&#39;d had in a while, and the popular guy on top of all that...and then there was his new life. Being a wandering warrior from a barbarian tribe that did mercenary work as he fought against the sorceress&#39; armies. Feeling the sense of ancient rivalry mesh with his affection for the woman he&#39;d known and wanted for so long.<br />
<br />
&quot;And I&#39;m counting on it, Chad.&quot; She then stepped back and chuckled, &quot;My, my polyamorous friend, what a mess of trouble you&#39;re in again.&quot; Before Chad could move forward, she snapped - and what looked like a bright red and white serpent of fire coiled around her, and she vanished in a flash of light. Teleportation.<br />
<br />
Chad somehow knew he couldn&#39;t stay in this old inn very long. The Great Plains outside beckoned, and the kingdoms beyond them were an obvious destination. The sorceress Lady Sinclair aimed to conquer the five kingdoms there, and cement her power. Of course, this was also their personal rivalry - with the promise of what came at the end. She knew he was strong enough, daring enough and bold enough. And Chad also found himself reckoning with something else. He could not only now know how to wield this sword, but fight - fight well, at that. She&#39;d given him all the tools he needed...to fight her.<br />
<br />
She wanted someone willing and able to conquer what she arrayed against him.<br />
<br />
Before long, Chad dressed in his barbarian gear. Slipping on the chest piece, feeling the interior against his chest almost seem natural. He found that putting on his shoulder guards, gauntlets, and boots were all simple and easy for him. A quick check, and he put the sword in its sheath across his back. It was a weapon that carried a natural heft - it&#39;d have been heavy for Chad the athlete, but for Chad the Barbarian Hero, he found an odd ease in its use.<br />
<br />
Chad stopped near one of the windows of the former fieldhouse to look at himself. Seeing a slightly more rugged set of facial features, complimented by a scar on the jawline he could oddly remember the story of, and long curly blond hair. She let him keep enough of himself to never lose track of who he&#39;d been, and who he&#39;d go back to once this was all done.<br />
<br />
With that, Chad left the inn / fieldhouse, and stepped out into the tall grass, long ponds and well established routes of the Great Plains. The space between the sorceress&#39; mountainous home of the Forbidden Mountains in the east, the five kingdoms to the west of him currently, and the Eld Forest to the south, which held...elves. Somehow just...normal to him now. There were elves, they were a fact of this world. &quot;Well, Karen...let&#39;s see what kind of world this is.&quot;<br />
<br />
With that, Chad left to head west, knowing the nearest kingdom - Ruthwain - was one this new barbarian hero identity had established his heroic deeds in already. What Karen said about familiar faces however bothered the young man a bit. What did she mean...?</p>
