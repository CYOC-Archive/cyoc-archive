<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;You want a bear?&quot; Tom snarled, seeing Bryan&#39;s pill sitting on the nightstand. &quot;I&#39;ll give you a bear.&quot;<br />
<br />
As Bryan was still trying to catch his breath he didn&#39;t even notice Tom grab the pill and crushed it between his teeth, swallowing the powder  before Bryan could even realize what he was doing. Tom&#39;s body began to expand even further and Bryan&#39;s eyes went wide as he registered what was happening. Tom roared as his hair continued to grow into a fur so thick barely an inch of skin was visible on his body. What was visible was six inches of fat hard cock (with at least a good three inches buried under the hair and two hairy orbs the size of tennis balls at the base). Tom growled as he grabbed Bryan by the hair and rammed his mouth back onto his throbbing bear-meat. Bryan once again began to choke, his friend penis only becoming longer and thicker with each thrust. Even with teeth scraping his thick shaft, Tom relentlessly pumped in and out with full force ignoring his friend&#39;s muffled cries and gags.<br />
<br />
Just as Bryan felt he was about to pass out his hair was yanked backwards and the fat bear cock popped out of his mouth, now at least eight inches were popping out of the hairy pelt and four were under it. With his face pulled away from the hairy crotch Bryan looked up and got a chance to see Tom&#39;s body. He had grown into a giant at least a foot taller and a hundred pounds heavier than before the third pill. Bryan could not see how large his biceps were under all the fur but they had swollen larger than any ham he had ever seen. He only caught a glimpse of Tom&#39;s majestic new form as not seconds later the pair of enormous arms lifted Bryan&#39;s pudgy body like a feather pillow and flipped him over onto the bed, bent over. Realizing what was about to happen Bryan tried to crawl away but even kicking and struggling with all his might he could not escape Tom&#39;s effortless grip holding him in place. It only took one of Tom&#39;s beefy hands to keep Bryan in place while the other literally tore off his pants and threw the tattered denim across the room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please Tom!&quot; Bryan begged &quot;Let me go! I&#39;m sorry!&quot;<br />
<br />
But Tom only replied with a growl, seemingly having lost his ability to speak. His colossal cock was plunged deep into the quivering anus. Though Bryan was no stranger to anal penetration this was more than anything he had ever taken. His howls of pain were ignored as Tom thrusts in and out with great vigor, his unforgiving fuck pole pounding Bryan&#39;s aching hole without pause. The fucking was continuous and only became more forceful and faster over the next hour. Tom never slowed down and never took a break. Just as Bryan thought it was never going to end, Tom&#39;s low rumbling grunts started growing louder and shallower. He began to piston in and out of Bryan&#39;s hole with immense speed and power before ejaculating with a roar that shook the windows. Bryan felt what must&#39;ve been at least a pint of semen pumped deep inside his rectum. At first he was relieved as the slimy cum coated his insides thinking his ordeal was over, but Tom continued to fuck and cum in Bryan&#39;s ass for at least five minutes, firing shot after shot of thick bear cum into Bryan&#39;s guts. Finally Tom slowed down and his cock began to soften still buried inside Bryan&#39;s tightening asshole. Bryan took the opportunity to try and crawl away from the gargantuan monster but even in Tom&#39;s post orgasm weakened state he easily prevented Bryan&#39;s escape just by holding him. Moments later Tom collapsed his large hairy body on top of his fuck toy, breathing heavily. Bryan&#39;s face was burried into the mattress and he could barely breathe with all the bear weight lying on top of him. Thankfully after a minute, Tom rolled over cuddling Bryan in his mammoth arms (Ironically like Bryan was his teddy bear).<br />
<br />
After a few minutes Bryan finally caught his breath. Tom had started snoring loudly and his grip on Bryan began to go loose. Bryan tried to roll out of Tom&#39;s grasp but as soon as he moved, Tom&#39;s snoring stopped. All Bryan heard was a grunt before suddenly being forcefully pulled back in to Tom&#39;s heavy pelt. Seconds later Tom was snoring again.<br />
<br />
Bryan tried to think of a way to get out without waking Tom. He wasn&#39;t sure how long he should wait until Tom was in a deep enough sleep. After while in the sleeping bear&#39;s arms Bryan briefly considered going to sleep himself to regain his strength. That was before he felt something rigid and slimy poking into his back. Realizing he did not know when Tom would wake up again and not being keen on round two, Bryan decided he had to get out sooner rather than later. He waited until Tom&#39;s snoring grew unbearably loud and over the next hour, began the slow process of trying to slip out of Tom&#39;s hairy arms without waking him. There were a few moments when Tom&#39;s snores paused, Bryan&#39;s heart felt like it was going to leap out of his chest but after Tom gave a few snuffles the snoring resumed. It took two hours before Bryan was finally able to break free. From there he carefully eased himself off the bed and onto the floor, down on all fours hoping to make less noise. He was relieved to be free but didn&#39;t dare breath too loudly as he slowly crawled towards the door. After slowly making his way for ten minutes, the doorknob was just a few inches out of reach when-<br />
<br />
*Clink*<br />
<br />
His heart skipped a beat, looking down he saw his hand on the remains of his jeans from earlier which had been torn off. Specifically the pocket where he kept spare change. Seconds after this realization he noticed Tom had stopped snoring again...<br />
<br />
Bryan slowly turned his head. A hefty rock hard and hairy cock was bearing down on him, bouncing with every stomp of the unhappy hairy beast it was attached to. Bryan could only whimper as Tom&#39;s oversized paws grabbed him by the ankles. The doorknob slipped out of Bryan&#39;s fumbling fingers as he was dragged across the floor back to the bed.</p>
