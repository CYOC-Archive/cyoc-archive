<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Min had finished her preparations for Ari&#39;s coming home with the simple moving of their former parents back to the dining room table. A small part of her echoed a desire to have had her friends present for the fun but... They were just things after all. No reason to put on a show for them. That small echo faded with a plaintive decree to the contrary before quieting down. There was really no use for the notion after all, time was running out~ Despite her previous statement she did go up to her room to retrieve one of them. Bringing the large book back downstairs under her arm, she took up a quiet spot in the living room to wait.<br />
<br />
Her reward came from the jingling sound of keys outside the front door. She&#39;d gotten to a particularly explicit picture of Kirsten losing to a group of bandits as she sat the book down beside her. The door finally opened and she heard footsteps followed by shoes dropping in place. Another set of footsteps approaching further in before she heard Ari&#39;s voice for the first time in a week.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mother! Father! I&#39;m home!~&quot; Ari exclaimed cheerily from the hallway just beyond the wall.<br />
<br />
Min watched as Ari came around the corner into view, she&#39;d come home in full makeup again... She wore her sleek black hair long with bangs swept to the left over her cocoa colored eyes. The makeup really did make her look beautiful though with the classic ruby red lips and all. She&#39;d worn formal clothes in today knowing their parents taste in attire all too well... She rested her bag next to the chair by the light switch and flicked them on before noticing Min in the corner.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh... Min. I didn&#39;t see you there. How has my little sister been?&quot; Even as she asked the question, she was obviously searching for a sign that their parents were out.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve been doing great, sister... Especially as of late.&quot; Min plastered a smile on her face learned from many years of practice. Though as Ari continued her essentially doomed search the smile that took it&#39;s place was more genuine.<br />
<br />
&quot;Say...&quot; Ari started before a brief moment of thought. &quot;Do you know if Mother and Father have got out somewhere?&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
There was the question of the hour~ Took her long enough... &quot;Hmm? Oh! I believe the last time I saw them the two of them were in the dining room together. I think they were waiting to surprise you when you got home.&quot; Min spoke thoughtfully as if she were trying to recall the nonexistent plan. &quot;Maybe they&#39;re still in there?&quot; Standing up and leaving her book carefully stowed out of view, Min made for the dining room allowing Ari to go ahead of her.<br />
<br />
Reaching the dining room, the two of them paused before the darkened doorway. Ari stepped forward into the darkened room and fished around the wall for the light switch. With a flash the lights came on without revealing the two &quot;waiting&quot; parents at the table. There was of course a carefully covered surprise waiting for Ari on the table though. A look of confusion worked its way onto Ari&#39;s face as she turned back to regard Min again.<br />
<br />
&quot;I thought you said they were in here...&quot; Eyeing the covered object in the middle of the table, Ari couldn&#39;t see the grin on Min&#39;s face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh? They&#39;re right here though, don&#39;t you see?&quot; Suspense was eating Min as she saw Ari&#39;s gaze locked onto HER surprise. &quot;Ah, why don&#39;t you just see what&#39;s been left for you then?&quot;<br />
<br />
Ari turned back to Min being met with positive encourage to do just as she said. Turning back to the covered prize, Ari got closer to the table and threw the covering off to the floor. The unfurling white cloth covered their vision for a moment before Min heard Ari gasp in surprise.<br />
&quot;What the hell... What the hell is this, Min?!&quot; Disgust and disbelief married into her voice as she turned to Min while gesturing at the lewd doll and it&#39;s accompanying horn. &quot;Did... Did you do this?! Mother and Father are going to kill you for this, don&#39;t you understand?! This goes far beyond anything you&#39;ve done before!&quot;<br />
<br />
Min just smiled passively through the tirade until it was obvious that she&#39;d been given a turn. &quot;Dear Sister, I firmly believe that they&#39;ll have a difficult time of it. Why don&#39;t you look a little closer, hmm? I&#39;m sure everything will be explained if you did.&quot;<br />
<br />
Morbid curiosity must run in the family for Ari did just that after confused hesitation. Leaning in close to the doll, Ari&#39;s face went through multiple emotions at once; confusion, realization, disgust, and finally anger. &quot;This is some sick joke... It truly is, Min... Once Mother and Father get home, I&#39;m going to tell them all of this... You&#39;ll be lucky if the only decide to kick you out instead of disowning you!&quot; Sighing into a scoff, Ari eyed Min again. &quot;You&#39;d like that though wouldn&#39;t you? To be finally free of all your difficult responsibility? You know, they had high hopes for you too. You just never lived up to your own poten...&quot; Her monologue was cut off in surprise as her gesturing right arm started receding back to her shoulder.<br />
<br />
Disbelief struck her face while she froze in place watching as her arm reached a mere foot in length and couple inches in width at the base of her shoulder. Sections down her arm shrunk in width forming ball shapes while the spaces in between thinned to the thickness of a small rope before it dropped off to the floor. There laid her arm having become nothing more than glassy red anal bead for someone&#39;s sexual enjoyment. Her eyes lingered on them while her left arm made to feel at her right shoulder. Feeling the flat skin where the arm should&#39;ve been was her first hint at another revelation... Looking down, she noted that there was no coat or blouse to cover her sizeable chest... Suddenly, the chill temperature of the air was overwhelmed by the chill sense of fear.<br />
<br />
&quot;I told you, Sister~ They&#39;re waiting in the dining room for your return, I said. There they are, right there on the table next to you. I&#39;m sure you don&#39;t recognize Father in his natural state but, surely you recognized Mother...&quot; As Min approached, Ari stepped backward step for step until she slipped on her former arm and felt the cold floor against her ass. Lifting the doll off of the table, Min held it before Ari with a sarcastic grin. &quot;Dear Mother is so disappointed in her star daughter, not recognizing her after only a week away~&quot; Feigning a croon, Min laughed as she dropped the doll in Ari&#39;s exposed lap, who in short order screamed and threw it aside as she pushed herself up. Shouldering Min aside, Ari seemed to forget her nude state and ran for the front door.<br />
<br />
Feeling a rush of empowerment at her sister&#39;s panic, Min breathed deeply before calming walking out into the hallway. Leveling her gaze on Ari was enough to enact the next phase of her torment. Watching as Ari reached for the door with her remaining arm only for it to follow the other in kind. Her head shook in denial as her left arm seemed to hollow out as her hand pulled into her wrist and up her arm. As the hollowing of the limb progressed, so too did it shrink like the other and it even turned a lovely shade of lavender. &quot;The color suits you, Sister. It always has truthfully~ But hey... Everything always looked good on you~ Looks even better off of you though~&quot; On cue the shrunken hollow lavender colored limb rolled up and popped off hitting the floor by her feet.<br />
<br />
With another scream of horror, Ari gave up on the door charged past Min, who allowed herself to be pushed aside. She kind of wobbled up the stairs banging against the walls as she lost balance. Enjoying the spectacle a bit longer, Min moved onto stage three of the act focusing on Ari&#39;s dominant leg. This time the limb didn&#39;t shrink, at least not right away~ Min wanted her to at least make it upstairs after all. Ari needed to make it to her room before the game ended first. That didn&#39;t stop the limb from changing into a milky white color up to the thigh however. Following her stumbling sister up the stairs with a cheerfully skip to her step, Min continued her onslaught.<br />
<br />
It was as Ari made it to her ajar bedroom door that her leg finally gave out on her. Crashing through the door as one leg detached and fluttered to the floor as a pure white stocking, Ari rolled into her bed. Min stepped in the doorway to find her sister upside down against her bed frame displaying her sex prominently as her last leg splayed to the side. Hearing the distraught whimpering was like music to Min&#39;s ears as she simplified the next step. With an almost cartoonish pop, Ari&#39;s left leg didn&#39;t even hit the floor before a black stocking landed in its place. Shaking her head furtively as she was now completely at Min&#39;s mercy, Ari started sobbing leaving to fall down her forehead.<br />
<br />
Min walked over to Ari and shocked her silent as she hefted her effortlessly into the air before tossing her onto her bed. Ari landed between her pillows laying directly in the cold matted blanket spot of her blanket. As one might not have expected, the room was mostly untouched as Min only bothered to utilize the bed after all. Didn&#39;t want to incriminate herself too badly, even if it wasn&#39;t likely anyone would remember Ari after this. With a mental shrug, Min climbed onto the bed and laid next to her limbless sister staring at the ceiling. She could feel Ari&#39;s terrorized gaze on her and heard her sobs clearly but, she chose to ignore her for the moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know... When we were younger, I used to idolize you too. My big sister! She could do anything and proved it every time. There was nothing you could do and I was so proud... But then it all changed as we got older...&quot; A sigh escaped Min&#39;s lips as she reminisced next to her now shrinking sister. &quot;Father became so enraptured by your success that I had to be the same... Mother never looked at me the same again either. I mean, why? I just thought so hard about what I could do to be just... like... you.&quot; A derisive frown formed as Min&#39;s eyebrows furrowed. By now, Ari was half of her original size as her body pulled toward her pillows, she merely whimpered as she felt the change.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nothing... Nothing, I did was ever good enough for any of you. At first, you tried to help me too. You did but... Then you gave up on me too. You ran off ahead to enjoy all the spotlight for yourself...&quot; Min&#39;s eyebrows furrowed deeper as the frown became a grimace. Ari laying by her side had reached a quarter of her size with each spurt of the shrinking striking harder as Min continued. &quot;You THRIVED on Father&#39;s attention, didn&#39;t you?! What you wanted, you got... It didn&#39;t matter what it was... Money, dresses, toys, makeup, all of it was yours! If I wanted a toy? I had to earn it! I worked so damn hard and got nothing!&quot; Min&#39;s anger grew with each time that Ari diminished in size. Ari&#39;s voice was barely a whisper now that her body could be gripped completely in one hand only her head left exposed.<br />
<br />
&quot;As we got older, it just got worse... Did you ever have to beg forgiveness? No! Did you ever grovel before our dickhead father? No! What about his sad excuse of a wife? No! You didn&#39;t because you never failed... Perfection in their eyes forever and always... Ah... But, it&#39;s not like you&#39;d ever listen to me anyways, would you?&quot; Finally turning her eyes to see Ari, Min sneered with a feigned sigh. &quot;Ah, well of course you wouldn&#39;t... All you&#39;ve ever been fit for truthfully is to ride father&#39;s dick just like mother...&quot;<br />
<br />
Min sat up from her spot in the bed and scooped up the small silicone form of her sister. Looking hard at her tiny face showed a surprising look of remorse frozen there forever now. Oh well~ Too late for that now~ She stuck her middle finger deep within the slit of her toy as she spoke in a mocking tone. &quot;Oh, my dearest sister, I&#39;m soooo sorry I treated you so poorly. I only hope you could ever find it in yourself to forgive me... Please! I don&#39;t want to be a fuck toy!&quot; The crude puppetry punctuated each phrase as the toy wobbled and flopped with each motion of the hand.<br />
<br />
Laughing out loud as she collected the pair of stockings from the floor, she idly noted the series of ridges and bumps against her finger. Triumphantly displaying her former sister for an empty house to see, Min walked downstairs to the door. Seeing the lavender condom rolled up and left on the floor sparked an idea in Min&#39;s head. She callously flicked the toy off her hand and watched as it bounced and rolled to a stop facing her. &quot;Wait right there, don&#39;t move... I&#39;ll be right back~&quot; She practically cackled at her own joke as she left only to return a short time later with a pair of Ari&#39;s panties in hand. The condom was picked up first and deposited in the underwear that formed a simple purple wrapper with Ari&#39;s signature on it. Once more the toy was picked up and taken this time into the dining room. Once the beads were collected, Min&#39;s feigned a small ceremony upon which she sheathed the remainder of the dildo with the far smaller form of Ari.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... I should pack my things and head off to work now...&quot; A brief pause overtook her as she digested her own words. &quot;Oh... That&#39;s right, it has been a few days now, I bet I did get hired!&quot; Min laughed pointedly at the trio of toys as she went upstairs to prepare. Into the floral bag went her black teddy gown, her cute piggy bank, and her favorite doll. The rest were to follow after she&#39;d gone downstairs. She&#39;d even changed to get ready after she&#39;d put on her new panties and her mismatched stockings, she didn&#39;t think the lady would mind. Next in her bag was her book for some casual night reading~ and the toys that were laid out on the table. The condom was almost forgotten as she opened the door to the outside, with a click of the lock she left the now emptied home for work.<br />
<br />
As she walked down the steps, she encountered someone entirely unexpected coming up them. It was a friend of her sister&#39;s or something like that... Either way this bespectacled brunette beauty was making her way toward Min. As soon as her cobalt colored eyes locked with Min&#39;s and she made to speak, Min spoke first. &quot;Ah, ah... I know just wait you&#39;re here for~&quot; As the brunette placed a calming hand on her chest, Min set her bag down drawing something from it. The woman had papers in hand that she brought up too slowly as Min pressed the naked form of her sister against the woman&#39;s cheeks. &quot;Here she is! Who&#39;s the better sister now, huh?~&quot; The proud exclamation was met with shock then those cobalt eyes widened even further.<br />
<br />
Before the woman even let that scream tear through her lips, Min had made certain it wouldn&#39;t. Soundlessly the woman grabbed her throat letting the papers scatter down the stairs. With a shake of her head and a waggle of her finger, Min grinned. &quot;Tut tut... I don&#39;t have much time to play, I hope you don&#39;t mind~&quot; Just as the brunette was puzzling together what was happening, she started getting shorter standing at half height within seconds. Her clothes bagging about her smaller frame having already lost her skirt and panties to the steps. &quot;That&#39;s it, good girl~&quot; Min chided as she stroked the woman&#39;s head having to reach steadily lower. Her head disappeared beneath the collar of her shirt as it too fell onto something within.<br />
<br />
Reaching down and throwing the upper clothes aside, Min revealing the pillow that was nestled within. A reddish-brown patch extended back from a pair of plush breasts sticking upward from the edge on the top side. The bottom side was peach colored with a similarly colored red triangle above a thin slit pocket before a plush ass formed the bottom edge. &quot;Perfect~ I knew you&#39;d understand~ Finally... SOMEONE realized what I&#39;d done!&quot; A flash in her mind and she knelt down snatching up the pastel blue panties. &quot;Don&#39;t want to forget the panties this time~&quot; She laughed as she finished her way down the stairs. Upon reaching the bottom, she twirled the panties around her finger walking down the street. Everyone already thought of her as a pervert anyways... Back on the steps, housing papers fluttered into the wind away from the for sale sign at the bottom.<br />
<br />
Min finally made it to the manor after strolling her way to the place from her own. She was let in by some cute little thing before she entered the consultation room once more. She contained herself with that one, she didn&#39;t think her new employer would appreciate her making a towel out of staff~ There sitting in the chair across from her was the spitting image of the woman from the photos online. So was she the actual lady of the house or was it the other one? Either way, she seemed to be asleep until a cold breeze blew through the room. Min settled into the chair across from her as the woman&#39;s eyes opened and her face donned a domineering expression.<br />
<br />
&quot;Welcome back, dear~ I trust you had a very interesting week?~&quot; The woman&#39;s eyes glimmered with expectation as if she already knew but, wanted Min to say it.<br />
<br />
&quot;I... Did I?&quot; Min shook her head and blinked as she saw where she was. &quot;I think I did... I remember feeling so empowered... Like everything belonged to me... I could do just as I pleased with anything... Or anyone...&quot; Recounting vaguely the feelings she had, Min didn&#39;t notice the changes as her toes merged but, not completely into one solid shape. The change continued up her ankle modifying the joint there as it crept up her calf. &quot;I couldn&#39;t help myself sometimes... I just threw myself completely into what I was doing... Sometimes even more than I felt I could&#39;ve...&quot;<br />
<br />
Throughout the slow explanation, the woman&#39;s expression never changed as she nodded with interest to Min&#39;s story. By now, the change was visible on Min&#39;s thighs as skin took a slight sheen creeping ever upward. Gasping with the change having overtaken her crotch, Min buckled just enough to bring her vision to her thighs. Staring at the change, Min paused her storytelling trying to grasp what she saw and had felt. All the while the change kept it&#39;s steady pace up beneath her breasts before Min looked back to the woman. &quot;I think... I think I know just how they all must&#39;ve felt now...&quot; Idly her brain came to an equally vague realization of her situation.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh... I get it, it wasn&#39;t me at all was it...?&quot; Rather than being beset by despair, she found herself overcome by a different emotion, disappointment. With the change now visible at her collar bone, it slowed up the neck but, traveled same speed down her arms. The joints changing internally while the skin just took a glossier tone. A hand held in front of her face, Min disconnectedly observed the change take her fingers. To her surprise, she still held it up on her own and the fingers flexed like normal. Hearing her approach, Min stared at the woman directly in front of her. &quot;Hey... What was your name again...?&quot; The change overtaking her face as she registered those familiar glowing blue eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Selicia, Dear~&quot; Selicia watched the change complete as Min&#39;s face froze in an expression of relief. It was the last surface thought on Min&#39;s mind... Relief to know the name of the person she&#39;d be working for from now on. Min sat staring at Selicia until she heard Selicia&#39;s voice giving a simple order. &quot;Stand up.&quot; Standing up as she was told, she awaited the next order to be given. &quot;Panties down, Dear.&quot; With that, she dropped her panties to the floor and waited again. There was a sigh... Had she already made a mistake on her first day? &quot;I suppose I should&#39;ve been more specific from the start... Hold still...&quot; Holding perfectly still, Min saw Selicia reach into her bag and pull something out of it.<br />
<br />
Selicia held Min&#39;s former sister in her hand as she stared at the purposeful hole left in place of her vagina. Giving the still panicking girl in her hand a coy smile, she pushed her in place until her sex replaced Min&#39;s missing one. &quot;There we are, Sweet. I just thought you two could certainly stand to be a bit closer. After all, she&#39;ll serve you now~ Call it a gift for the meal and the amusement. In fact, I&#39;m going to allow you to keep the rest of your effects as well. I certainly have no need for them. It&#39;s going to take some time but, you&#39;ll have better freedoms soon, I promise.&quot; Planting a little peck on her forehead, Selicia ordered her to replace her underwear and report to Marina for training. &quot;After all, you&#39;ve been such a wonderful little puppet~&quot;<br />
<br />
I did good... I was finally praised... Over my sister... Without realizing it, Min&#39;s hand moved in front of her face. When it left, her expression changed from relief to happiness. I&#39;m finally the better sister...</p>
