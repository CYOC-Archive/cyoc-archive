-------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
   <br />
    Before you can decide, the Hivemind have another gurgly roar and swung wildly with all six of its arms at once. It roared again, destroyed and crushing stone and fungus alike with instants. <br />
<br />
           You try and escape but one of it&#39;s Corrupted purple arms hit you square in the back, thrusting you several feet backwards into the room you had just come from. As it hit you, you have a scream of intense burning pain as it hit you with the force of several trucks. <br />
<br />
     Your body was on fire, the only reason you were still alive was because of your enduring kitsune body. You try and stand up as you see with blurred eyes the Hivemind approach you slowly, a thick bubbly foam oozing out of its mouth as it gives another moan.<br />
<br />
      You try and stand but fall limp, the mushroom corruption below you starting to try and fully restrain you, thick fungal tendrils trying to corrupt you. Your left side was bruised and bleeding and you could feel the corruption leaking into your bloodstream. <br />
<br />
     You only had mere minutes before you would be fully corrupted.<br />
<br />
      Spitting out several teeth and globs of blood, you conjure fox fire, it took a while but it soon began to start burning the grasping mushroom tendrils, releasing you and with all your strength manage to weakly stand on three of your legs, one of them completely broken. You give another cry and you limp away from the approaching hive mind.<br />
<br />
     The hive mind sees your desperate escapes and tries to increase its speed. You spit a glob of fox fire onto it, making it scream an unholy shriek as it feels the fire begin to burn, the Hivemind swinging its body in a panic as it puts the fire out. You knew the mushrooms wouldn&#39;t burn as quickly as you&#39;d like but you took the Hivemind&#39;s temporary uninterest in you and made your way through a doorway into what seemed to be a hallway with several doors on each side. The mushrooms attempting to entangle you made you lose precious time as you had to take a few moments burning them off before continuing. You hurriedly look into each room as you pass them, not finding anything of immediate interest. However in the last door on the right was something that sparked an idea in you.<br />
<br />
      Your nose smelt something... the overpowering smell of oil. An idea with its own risks pop into your mind and you head into the doorway. As you walked you looked to the floor and realized that the mushroom corruption had not spread into this room. The walls, ceiling and floor were all completely devoid of the affliction. You were glad of this but you also recoiled as the oily smell intensified tenfold as you entered the room.<br />
<br />
      You gagged before sucking it up and doing your best to ignore the stench.<br />
<br />
      The room was a large storage room, crates filled with decayed wheat and rotten remains of meats and vegetable. However what mostly filled the room were about thirty or so rusted barrels of oil. <br />
<br />
       Behind you, the sounds of the Hivemind in the hallway begin to become louder, heavy sticky shuffling beginning to encroach. You look at yourself and see that your infection was increasing, your fur was becoming purple, your visible veins were glowing a faint magenta and your vision starting to become purple tinted. Mushroom growths began developing in your back and your canine penis was strangely starting to become erect and mutate slightly as a purple ooze began dribbling from it. It&#39;s red form becoming a royal purple instead.  A strange desire to let the corruption complete itself was starting to grow in your mind. To let it happen and become one with the Hivemind, gently trying to coax you in. <br />
<br />
     You shake your head, you had to stay strong. You move up to several of the oil barrels and knock them down with a loud chorus of crashing. Black oil leaks out of them and begins to cover the floor. (You notice the fungal corruption on the edge of the doorway almost seemed to recoil as the oil touched it but you put that on the back of your mind.)<br />
<br />
        You look at the oil and the sounds of the Hivemind growing closer and closer. You take a deep breath and silently wish Master Harauphar good luck before forming a ball of fox fire in your mouth and fireing it on the oil.<br />
<br />
        It seemed like the sky itself was torn apart to your ears, a deafening explosion rocks you as the oil ignites and explodes, just as the Hivemind was about to turn right and enter the room. You didn&#39;t even hear the monsterous scream it gave off as you were knocked out. the temple was completely destroyed, along with the Hivemind and the corruption within it. You didn&#39;t realize this but the God that the temple was originally made to was the Goddess Fortuna the Goddess of Luck. You were lucky as you didn&#39;t realize that your own fox fire and the explosions created from it did not affect you in anyway. The only thing that did affect you was the force of the blast but thankfully you lived from that as well. <br />
<br />
            Covered in a layer of rubble and stone you latex unconsious, still unaware of the heroic act you did.<br />
<br />
     The Hivemind was the heart and mind of the corruption. The land around you, once previously corrupted and covered in purple mushrooms and toadstools, was now withering away in the blink of an eye leaving behind a white ash in its place. Trees that were once Corrupted collapsed, infected animals died and formed piles of the white ash as well. The entire forest was about five square miles of forest land that had been infected by whatever strange force, now it was a plain of rubble and dust.<br />
<br />
       An hour later, you weakly opened your eyes, your mind still shocked from the blast and saw what you did. You weren&#39;t quite sure what you did but you felt pride in what you had done, remorse for not seeking help and anxiety. Not to mention pain. There was a lot of pain you felt all over your broken body. It would take a couple of fresh souls to fix that. On the bright side the infection in your body had faded as well which was a plus.<br />
<br />
        You quickly managed to blash several birds unaware with your fox fire and promptly smacked on their tasty but small souls, feeling strength return to you and some of your wounds caused by the Hivemind and the explosion to heal slightly. You shook your body, shaking off pebbles and dust and realized that it was almost nightfall. If you didn&#39;t return soon Mater Harauphar would surely notice.<br />
<br />
     You were about to run off into the direction of your Master&#39;s Cottage when a shiny reflection in the rubble caught your attention. Moving towards it, you see, under a pile of rubble and rock was a black metallic chest, seemingly unscratched from the giant explosion. <br />
<br />
    Pushing the rubble off you saw it was unopened. Inside you saw....</p>
