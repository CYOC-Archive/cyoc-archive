<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Alan looked himself over in the bathroom one more time. What stared back at him was a grown woman ready for bed. Despite never getting real for bed like this before, his body basically ran on auto pilot.  He cleared the makeup from his face, changed into pink pajamas, and went to the bathroom. While he did this, he could feel his face getting redder and redder. <br />
<br />
He still couldn&#39;t believe what had happened. He thought it had been bad enough when their lives were simply messed up, but now their bodies too? Alan was stuck as a grown woman until they could figure out how this magic book actually worked. Walking out, he tried to just quickly shuffle into bed, but Megan was already there, looking at him and laughing.<br />
&quot;What&#39;s the matter honey bunches? You don&#39;t like getting ready for bed as a woman?&quot; Megan laughed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can you please stop calling me that?&quot; Alan groaned as he got into bed.<br />
<br />
&quot;What? The magic is affecting our speech! I can&#39;t call you by your real name.&quot; She responded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, well you don&#39;t have to say... that!&quot; Alan snapped back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, hey.&quot; Megan calmly said, holding Alan&#39;s chin up. Alan felt himself blush as he looked into the eyes of the rugged male face before him. He hadn&#39;t realized that adult man Megan looked so... good. Alan felt some odd warmth begin to stir in his new equipment. He had gotten a boner plenty of times as a guy, but this was way different.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry Alana.&quot; Megan apologized.<br />
<br />
&quot;It- it&#39;s okay Me-ark.&quot; Alan said, trying to hide his arousal. &quot;Let&#39;s just get to sleep.&quot; <br />
<br />
Alan quickly pulled the blanket towards himself in an attempt to just go to sleep and get it all over with, but unfortunately he forgot he was a she. The blanket pressed against his large breasts, causing them to jiggle for a moment before he realized his mistake. He covered them, rolled to face away from Megan, and blushed harder than he had all night.<br />
<br />
Megan, meanwhile, kept staring at Alan, his jaw dropped. She felt like she should be laughing at Alan&#39;s discomfort, but something about seeing Alan&#39;s new body do that made her feel, weird. She quickly realized what it was as the blanket near the groin began to lift up in a tent motion. If she was normal, she probably would have screamed, but her mature male mind knew this was a normal occurrence.<br />
<br />
Megan realized why Alan had been acting so weird, and quickly realized how awkward it was all going to be. Reality had altered so that Alan and Megan had always been &quot;Alana&quot; and &quot;Mark&quot; the loving couple, and even if they did remember, that wasn&#39;t what the rest of the world saw. Megan decided she wanted to make her brother feel better, but on her new instinct, just hugged Alan from behind.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, uh, sorry...&quot; Megan awkwardly apologized.<br />
<br />
Alan, while still facing away, was beyond embarrassed. He could feel &quot;Mark&#39;s&quot; massive dick sitting comfortably between his new massive ass cheeks. Megans hands rested on Alan&#39;s breasts, as the two both said nothing out of awkwardness. Despite this, Alan felt himself grow calmer and more relaxed. Before he even knew it, he had fallen asleep.<br />
<br />
<br />
Alan awoke to light pouring in through the window. For a brief moment, he had forgotten all about the previous night. He stretched his arms for a moment as he yawned. Only once he scratched his head did he notice something was off. He had felt a large clump of curly feeling hair. His eyes shot open as he pulled it down to see curly clumps of blond hair. Glancing down, he was confronted by two orbs protruding from his chest and he remembered everything.<br />
<br />
&quot;God.&quot; He thought annoyed. &quot;Why can&#39;t it just have all been a nightmare?&quot; <br />
<br />
He looked over to see that Megan had roles over in her sleep. Alan still couldn&#39;t&#39;t believe that this grown man used to be his sister. He of course, still remembered Megan as Megan, but if he concentrated then he could remember this life. He could see Alana and Mark&#39;s first date, their wedding, the weddings... aftermath.<br />
<br />
Alan found himself staring at &quot;Mark&#39;s&quot; morning wood as his face turned red again. He swiftly got up and decided it would be a good time to head downstairs. He quietly tiptoed downstairs, almost expecting to see his mom already down making pancakes. Of course, his mother was currently a young boy, and that meant it was his job to make breakfast.<br />
<br />
He was initially worried about messing it up, but found that his current body came with even more instincts than he thought. He was able to start cooking up scrambled eggs as if he had done it a thousand times before. He figured he probably had in this new reality, but didn&#39;t really want to think about it. As he continued to make the eggs, Janet walked in and sat at the dining room table.<br />
<br />
&quot;Morning.&quot; She said sadly.<br />
<br />
&quot;What, not even a &#39;good&#39; morning?&quot; Alan joked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry. I would say more, but that stupid book is changing my words.&quot; She sighed. &quot;Thanks for making breakfast.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s really no prob.&quot; Alan responded, handing Janet a plate full of eggs. &quot;Actually, it is sort of my job right now with this life. Plus, it&#39;s all coming second nature to me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Did you and Dad... I mean, oh you know who I mean.... have fun sharing a bed last night?&quot; Janet asked. &quot;I would have swapped beds with you but my current bed is so small.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alan didn&#39;t look back at his mother as the blush started up again. Without looking back, he simply said &quot;Let&#39;s just say I&#39;m eager to reverse this.&quot;<br />
<br />
Janet nodded before going back to eating. Alan felt even more urges arrive as he started preparing bacon and poured Janet a glass of OJ. Some stomping could be heard a few minutes later as Steve walked down the stairs. His long hair was a mess, his eyes screamed exhaustion, and he was wearing adorable hello kitty pajamas fit for a 16 year old girl.<br />
<br />
&quot;Morning... Mom.&quot; Steve grumbled before sitting down.<br />
<br />
&quot;Morning sunshine.&quot; Alan retorted. &quot;You sleep bad?&quot; He asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah.&quot; He replied as he started shoving eggs in his mouth. &quot;It&#39;s this stupid body. I stayed on my phone texting &#39;girlfriends&#39; that I shouldn&#39;t even know.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well young lady, that is very irresponsible and is your own fault.&quot; Alan sassily retorted, doing a slight impression of Janet.<br />
<br />
Janet snickered to herself while Steve just rolled his eyes.<br />
&quot;Look, it&#39;s whatever. Let&#39;s, like, just get back to normal asap.&quot; He groaned. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, your father and I came up with a plan.&quot; Alan announced. &quot;Though I don&#39;t think either of you will like it much.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What is it?&quot; Janet asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, Mark and I will stay here and do research on the book. You two, however, have school soon.&quot; He answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?!&quot; Steve and Janet screamed in unison.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom that&#39;s so unfair!&quot; Janet yelled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah Mom, you like, can&#39;t just send us off!&quot; Steve agreed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Stephanie, Jake, listen to me. I don&#39;t want to do this, but this magic book changed reality. The world thinks we have always been like this. So, we can&#39;t just keep letting you two skip school. It could have repercussions on your father and I when we get the book working. As much as it won&#39;t be fun, you have to go to work like normal.&quot; Alan calmly explained, surprised by his own maturity handling the situation.<br />
<br />
&quot;But, like, doesn&#39;t Dad have work?&quot; Steve angrily asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;He has one more day off from work, but after today yes he will also be working like normal. I&#39;m sorry but this is the safest option.&quot; Alan explained.<br />
<br />
Both Janet and Steve wanted to argue further or take the book themselves or do anything else but they knew Alan was right. This was the safest way to research the book without screwing up their lives. Steve huffed off in typical teen girl fashion to get ready for school while Janet sat angrily and continued to chew on her food. Alan sighed as he went to do the dishes, hoping this would all be over by the time they got back home.<br />
<br />
Half an hour later, Steve walked downstairs with a full face of makeup, hair done, and dressed in a cute mini skirt. Janet was dressed in a jersey and shorts, and looked at Steve with confusion.<br />
&quot;What took you so long, we&#39;re gonna be late.&quot; Janet whined. &quot;And how&#39;d you even know how to do any of that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, like, being a teenaged girl is annoying!&quot; Steve snapped back. &quot;I&#39;m lucky the books magic or whatever helped me, no thanks to you.&quot; He sneered.<br />
<br />
Alan noticed the two former adults were starting to bicker more and more like children whenever they got stressed. Alan decided not to point it out as that would only cause further stress, but he broke it up regardless.<br />
&quot;Hey, focus!&quot; He yelled. &quot;Stephanie, you have your permit so you can drive yourself and Jake to school okay?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Fine.... like, whatever.&quot; He groaned, girlishly flipping his hair back as he turned around, followed by Janet grumbling and shuffling behind him. Alan watched them leave and then sat down at the kitchen counter with a sigh. A few moments late, Megan walked down the stairs. She was wearing a wrinkled t-shirt and boxers, with a five o&#39;clock shadow and messy brown hair.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, are they gone yet?&quot; She asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yup, they didn&#39;t take it too well but they went to school anyway.&quot; Alan replied. &quot;But just where were you? I could&#39;ve used your help you know!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry. I just, felt awkward about last night.&quot; He replied.<br />
<br />
ALan sighed. &quot;Yeah, me too. Look it&#39;s not us, it&#39;s these bodies. We&#39;ll just figure out how to use the book and never speak of it again. Agreed?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Agreed.&quot; </p>
