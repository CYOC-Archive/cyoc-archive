<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Cody knocked on the dorm supervisor&#39;s door. &quot;Randall you there?&quot; Cody sighed not getting an answer. Seeing another student he called them over. &quot;Hey Paul, do you know where Randall went?&quot; Cody asked. &quot;I think he went to the laundry room,&quot; Paul said. Thanking him the teen walked down towards the basement. <br />
<br />
As he walked past the noticeboard he saw his reflection in the glass. He did a double-take to make sure he wasn&#39;t imagining it. He put his hand to his face and felt two of his upper teeth. He tried to brush it off like it was nothing but then he felt something escape his pants. Looking back he held back a scream and ran down the stairs. <br />
<br />
Getting to the basement he turned to see a rat tail with the same skin tone as him. It had to be over a foot long now and still growing. Looking around he sighed in relief that no one was around. He pinched himself to make sure he wasn&#39;t dreaming only to dig into his flesh a bit. &quot;ah!&quot; he covered his mouth. Looking down he saw his nails had gotten sharper. <br />
<br />
He then heard a thud coming from the laundry room. &quot;Randall you there&quot; forgetting his problems he walked over to the door. Pressing his ear against it he could hear a muffled cry for help. He opened the door only to jump back because of what awaited him. Two orange-furred mounds now forced the door open. The smell of sex wafted to Cody&#39;s nose.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Hello, who&#39;s there?&quot; a female voice called out. &quot;my name is Cody and...&quot; he was interrupted by the female creature. &quot;Cody Milton?&quot; she asked. &quot;how did you, wait who are you?&quot; he asked. His tail was almost as long as his torso now. &quot;well I am the dorm supervisor, or at least I was.&quot; the female said. &quot;wait Randall?&quot; Cody was shocked by this reveal. &quot;yeah&quot; Randall then went on a rant about everything leading up to this moment. On his way back from his car a small storm could hit him with strange violet and red water. Then he changed while doing his laundry and getting so massive he was stuck in his current position. &quot;my butt was starting to hurt so thanks for opening the door&quot; Randall said. <br />
<br />
Hearing no response she tried repositioning for a better angle. This didn&#39;t help her see but did show off the source of what Cody was smelling. The pheromones coming from her vagina were starting to make Cody incredibly horny. He soon dropped his pants and freed his penis from his underwear. Hearing his buckle hit the ground Randall began to get concerned. &quot;Cody what&#39;s going on?&quot; she soon received her answer. <br />
<br />
Cody then lunged toward her pussy and slammed his cock in. It was tiny compared to her but it was effective. Randall let out a moan as Cody thrust repeatedly. His tail then surged and waved around as his balls swelled. The added testosterone only heightened his need to mate. Deep green fur soon spread across his body from his balls, tail, and lips. <br />
<br />
His legs gained muscle as the fur spread down them. It stopped right at his ankles as he lost a toe. he kicked off his shoes and allowed his growing feet to rip through his shoes. Each toe now ended with sharp white claws. His cock then swelled to over a foot long while the fur finished coating his body. The only places unaffected were his hands, cock, tail, feet, nose, and ears. The latter two then began to change. <br />
<br />
His nose became pink and triangular as his ears became massive. They moved up his head as his hair grew out. The black strands soon gained a green dye job as they were cut into a mohawk by unseen hands. His mouth pushed into a rodent&#39;s muzzle causing his glasses to slip off and break upon hitting the ground. His body then surged and mutated a little more. His shirt had ripped off as a result. Around his neck a spiky choker appeared and three fake piercings appeared on his left ear. Once he cumed he found himself unsatisfied and decided to eat her out. At this point, Randall had enough and begged Cody to stop. <br />
<br />
&quot;What the heck?&quot; a voice could be heard. Paul paused at the basement door where he saw a six-foot green rat licking a gushing hole between two furry walls. He wanted to run screaming but there was something in the air. It was something that made him want more. As he stepped forward the smell got stronger. Grey fur began to grow on his arms as his fear melted away. <br />
<br />
Soon he was behind the rat and saw what made him so eager. The dripping pussy was almost calling out for him. he grabbed the greedy rodent and tossed him aside. He then began licking himself as a black mask made of fur spread across his face. His hair became a pink mohawk as a spiky choker appeared. Unlike Cody, his clothes didn&#39;t break but instead transformed with him. Cody meanwhile was too horny now to care and jacked off while the noise started bringing more guys down to investigate.<br />
<br />
------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Eventually, the head of the college got wind of this from a student. A while later men in hazmat suits approached the basement. Once at the bottom, they saw the hall was filled with transformed college boys. A snake was using his tail to jack off. A rabbit herm was getting and giving. A shark girl was sucking off a Minotaur man. These were just a few they saw. There was a common theme among them. Each of them had a punk appearance. Whether they were wearing anything or not. <br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, how does a virus change someone&#39;s clothing,&quot; one of the hazmat suit guys said. &quot;just be glad it didn&#39;t affect more than the basement,&quot; the other said as they set up the barriers. Knockout gas was then pumped into the hall. Several thuds later they shut the valve off. Opening the tent they confirmed that every victim was out cold. The source of the outbreak seemed to be the giant fourteen-foot mutant stuck in the laundry room. &quot;we&#39;ll get these people out of here then figure out what to do about her&quot; one of them said. <br />
<br />
--------------------------------<br />
<br />
In a quarantine tent, Cody began to open his eyes. His head pounded him like he was sick or something. A woman in a hazmat suit noticed him start to get up. &quot;what happened?&quot; Cody asked finding himself in a hospital gown. &quot;we found you in the basement of your dorm, along with... others&quot; she hesitated on that last part. <br />
<br />
The last thing Cody remembered was Randall talking and her voice fading out as everything became hazy. &quot;what about Randall?&quot; Cody said as the woman ran some tests. &quot;if you&#39;re referring to the mutated human in the laundry room we&#39;re working on her. Let&#39;s just say the dorm will need some new walls.&quot; the woman noticed Cody had stopped listening. He looked up from his new body to see the woman pulling off the hazmat suit. &quot;well good news is you&#39;re not contagious. You&#39;ll be sent to the hospital for further tests&quot; The woman added something as he walked to an ambulance, &quot;your friends are waiting for you, good luck&quot;. <br />
<br />
--------------------------<br />
<br />
&quot;then I saw you guys&quot; Cody finished his story. &#39;so the clouds are not the only things to change people&#39; briar typed on her laptop. &quot;yeah but there has to be some way to reverse this. I mean I never wanted piercings and now I look like a punk... well ya know&quot; Cody looked ashamed. Wynn then asked, &quot;Well if you don&#39;t like the look then why not get rid of them&quot;. This earned a scoff as Cody grabbed his choker and took it off. The second he let go it zipped back to his neck. &quot;that&#39;s why. it&#39;s not just me though, anyone who got affected can&#39;t take off their punk-style clothes, at least not fully.&quot; Cody was thankful he had taken off his clothes before the pheromones changed him or he would be just like Paul and the others. <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m truly sorry for that, but at least you&#39;re mentally unchanged&quot; Jay looked over to Wyatt as he spoke this. &quot;Wendy err... Wyatt sorry, do you have anything to say to him&quot; Gwyn looked over to the Minotaur herm. She was standing the furthest from Cody&#39;s bed. &quot;Cody I think you look cool. I mean a cool rat. I mean I like green&quot; Wyatt was flustered. The bulges on her shirt were covered by her arms but her main cock tented her gown. She shifted away but Cody could smell her arousal. <br />
<br />
&quot;hey it&#39;s okay Wendy,&quot; Cody said. Even if her name and memories were different he knew Wendy was still in there. &quot;can y&#39;all give us a bit&quot; Everyone but Wyatt walked out. Once the door shut Cody looked at her. &quot;ya know during that unfortunate event I had I ended up imagining I was with you, alone in bed, with only the blanket on us&quot; This made Wyatt turn to him in shock. &quot;really?&quot; she said. She no longer hid her erections as she moved closer to him. <br />
<br />
&quot;yeah, I mean why do you think I hang out with someone like you so much&quot; he rubbed his tail. It was becoming a nervous habit but doing this did calm him down. &quot;Why... Why didn&#39;t you say anything?&quot; Wyatt asked. Chuckling Cody shook his head and closed his eyes. &quot;Because what chance did a nerd like me have at getting the greatest woman on earth&quot; he opened them as he felt something wrap around his hand. Wyatt stared him right in the eyes. <br />
<br />
&quot;I wish you would have said this sooner. Even if I don&#39;t remember being Wendy I still remember how I feel when it comes to you&quot; Their faces were just inches apart and closing. The two mutants soon kissed each other. Wyatt wanted more but then the doctor came in. They didn&#39;t even notice until the doctor coughed. &quot;Wyatt is it, could you please leave? Cody needs some tests done before he can be cleared,&quot; he said. Cody then felt his heart ache as Wyatt let go of his hand. After she left the doctor looked over the notes. &quot;well looks like we don&#39;t have to test for contagions so this should be fast&quot; With that he began to examine him.</p>
