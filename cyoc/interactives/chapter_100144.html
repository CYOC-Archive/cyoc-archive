<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">On the way to the gate I asked if Heem wanted Regi returned to normal once we went through the gate. He asked Runt to return Regi ability to speak which he did straight away as there was no reason to keep him mute. Once he could talk Regi berated Heem for cheating on him but Heem pointed out that there was no way for him to know that it wasn&#39;t Regi. Once Regi calmed down Heem asked him if he wanted to go back to normal but Regi admitted to liking his new form and wanted to keep it. So we agreed to leave him as he was. Before we continued though Runt insisted on fixing the speech problem me and Heem had and agreed to change me to another form properly once we got to the next realm.<br />
<br />
As we walked we noticed that it was getting warmer. Heem said this was due to the heat built up by the Realm Gates power source. The heat got unbearable and those of us who were wearing clothes got rid of them. This gave me a chance to look around at our group. And thanks to Runt&#39;s aura we all had boners, but we&#39;d decided to just accept this as Runt didn&#39;t want to switch off his aura. Personally I think he likes keeping everyone perpetually aroused.<br />
<br />
Ferus was the tallest of us at roughly 9&#39; tall. He was also the most muscular, looking to have more muscle that any human bodybuilder and not an ounce of fat on his body. He also defiantly had the longest cock. It had to be 15&#39;&#39; and with testicles the size of baseballs. His minotaur features were just as attractive as before.<br />
Heem was the next tallest at about 8&#39;. He didn&#39;t has a much muscle as Ferus but he had a beer belly. And his cock was be about 8&#39;&#39; with testicles the size of oranges. Normally I would find his green skinned, pig-man appearance to be repulsive but in Regi&#39;s form I felt quite the opposite.<br />
In Regi&#39;s original form I was the next tallest at 7&#39; 6&#39;&#39;. My build was similar to Heem only smaller. And my dick was about 6&#39;&#39; and my testicles were slightly smaller than Heem. <br />
Patrick was the next tallest at about 6&#39; and had the most average build out of any of us. Like all satyrs he had a goat-like body from the waist down and goat horn poking out of long curly brown hair. His horns were short though suggesting that he&#39;s only a young satyr. But despite that his dick was the same length as Heem and his testicles were just as big if not bigger.<br />
Then there&#39;s Regi. In his gargoyle form he looked a lot like Brooklyn from that old Gargoyles tv show. His cock was no longer than 3&#39;&#39; with grape sized testicles and he was about 5&#39; tall.<br />
And finally we had Runt. The shortest of use at 3&#39; he was the leader of the group due to his ability to change any of us at will. Despite his small size he had a huge 12&#39;&#39; cock and his testicles were bigger than Heem&#39;s but not quite as big as Ferus&#39;. Other than that he looked like any other imp, red skin, horns,  and a tail ending in an arrow-like point.<br />
<br />
As I looked around I noticed the others were inspecting the group too. Heem, Patrick and Runt stole a few glances at everyone, while Regi only seemed to have eyes for Heem, and Ferus was doing his job and keeping an eye on Heem and Regi but occasionally he snuck a glance back at me. After a while we finally reached our destination. There in front of us stood the gate but it looked a little different than the last one.<br />
<br />
&quot;What is that,&quot; Patrick asked.<br />
&quot;That&#39;s a Realm Gate,&quot; Runt replied. &quot;But it not a normal one.&quot;<br />
&quot;Your right there,&quot; Heem said. &quot;I designed this one to allow us to go to any Realm we want no matter which rung of the ladder it&#39;s on. Plus unlike a normal gate this one isn&#39;t an arch you step through but a portal that moves itself and anyone on it to another realm.&quot;<br />
&quot;Well Heem you&#39;re smarter than I though,&quot; Patrick said.<br />
&quot;And don&#39;t you forget it,&quot; Heem replied proudly.<br />
&quot;Well then I guess all that&#39;s left is to decided which Realm to go to,&quot; Runt said.<br />
&quot;How many are there,&quot; I asked.<br />
&quot;Depends on who you ask,&quot; Runt replied. &quot;Some say there are hundreds, others millions. However if your like me you only pay attention to the 7 important ones. At the top of the ladder is Heaven where the angels live. Below it is the Spirit World where all those who were good in life go when they die. Then there&#39;s the Unknown Realm. When going to this realm there&#39;s no telling what you&#39;ll find. But from what I&#39;ve heard this realm changes for each individual that visits it, however I don&#39;t know what would happen if a group visited it. We&#39;re at the middle of the ladder right now in Limbo. It&#39;s just a white expanse where those who cause trouble in the Spirit World are sent.&quot;<br />
&quot;That&#39;s what happened to the Satyr there,&quot; Regi said.<br />
&quot;Really,&quot; I asked.<br />
&quot;Well that&#39;s what happens where you&#39;re a Satyr surrounded by the sexiest people from across time and space and you can&#39;t control your libido,&quot; Patrick said.<br />
&quot;I know how you feel,&quot; Runt said. &quot;Anyways beneath Limbo is the Fey Realm. Original it was uninhabited but after humans started hunting magical creatures on Earth, all of them fled to the Fey Realm and it has been the home of magic ever since. Below the Fey Realm is Earth where Hudson here comes from.&quot;<br />
&quot;So he&#39;s human,&quot; Heem said. &quot;Well that explains a lot.&quot;<br />
&quot;What&#39;s that suppose to mean,&quot; you asked.<br />
&quot;It explain why you&#39;re with Runt for one thing,&quot; Heem replied. &quot;Humans always seem to end up being manipulated by hellspawn.&quot;<br />
You were about to say something when Runt continued, &quot;And that brings us to my home. Hell, the bottom of the ladder. Home to demons and sinners. And a pretty fun place if you know where to go. Anyways we have to decide which Realm any suggestions.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ferus&#39;ll go where Hudson goes,&quot; Ferus said.<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll let Heem decide for me,&quot; Regi said.<br />
&quot;I&#39;m up for anywhere except Hell,&quot; Heem said. &quot;I&#39;ve got a few people down there that wouldn&#39;t be happy to see me.&quot;<br />
&quot;I&#39;m with you on that one,&quot; Runt said. &quot;Personally I&#39;d like to keep going up.&quot;<br />
&quot;Well I&#39;d like to get back home to the Fey Realm,&quot; Patrick said. &quot;But I am kinda curious about this Unknown Realm.&quot; <br />
&quot;Well it seems like none of us can decide,&quot; Runt said. &quot;As Hudson is the only one left who hasn&#39;t voiced his opinion why don&#39;t we left him decide.&quot;<br />
&quot;Ferus agrees with that,&quot; Ferus said.<br />
&quot;Sounds good to me too,&quot; Patrick said.<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t see why not.&quot; Heem said.<br />
&quot;If Heem okay with this then so am I,&quot; Regi said.<br />
&quot;Well then it&#39;s up to you Hudson,&quot; Runt replied. &quot;Where shall we go?&quot;<br />
<br />
This was a serious decision for me to make. One the one hand I would love to go back to Earth. On the other it didn&#39;t seem like home anymore. Ferus and Patrick were both from the Fey Realm so it might be good to take them back home. But as you ran into Angels there it might be too dangerous to go there. Heem and Runt both agreed that Hell would be a bad choice and I was inclined to agree with them. Patrick was kicked out of the Spirit World so it&#39;d probably be bad for him to return. Angels were looking for Runt and, even though it seemed like his ultimate goal was to get there, it seemed like a bad idea to go to Heaven. The Unknown Realm was a mystery to everyone there and it might be dangerous to go there but it also might be the safest choice. What would be the best choice? I had to choose quickly so I said, &quot;I think we should.....&quot;</p>
