<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><P>The changing room was unremarkable, aside from three colored buttons on the wall and the large circular panel that took up most of the ceiling. It looked like a giant light, but Oliver knew better after Alice's briefing.
<P>There was a bit more room to move around than normal changing rooms. There was a bench and a few hooks on the wall to hang clothes. On either side of the center hook were rectangular notches running down the length of the wall. Oliver noticed this only because none of the other walls matched the design element.
<P>On the wall opposite the bench, a floor-to-ceiling mirror showed Oliver's full reflection. Green, orange and red buttons were placed next to the mirror. Alice hadn't said anything about an orange button. Looking closer, Oliver saw labels for each button's function. The green said "Transform," and the red one said "Emergency," but the orange one simply said "Swap." Oliver wondered about it for a moment, but then decided it was time to get his transformation over with. He pressed the green button and braced himself.
<P>Something up in the ceiling revved up to a loud whine, and Oliver was suddenly bathed in a bright yellow light. He tried to remain as still as possible, and shut his eyes tightly. The light faded after only a couple seconds, and the whining noise slowly quieted.
<P>Oliver tentatively stepped closer to his reflection and waited. Nothing looked different so far.
<P>Then he felt an odd tingling spread up his body. It was like the dizzy feeling he got from standing up after sitting for a long time. This passed after a few seconds, and then Oliver finally noticed something.
<P>He felt his scalp crawl. It was a tiny sensation, but strange enough to get his attention. He could see in the mirror that his hair had begun to grow out. It grew to two inches, then to three. It began to sag under its own weight and became a five-inch mop upon his head. He could tell it was getting lighter in color.
<P>He also noticed changes happening to his face, most notably the disappearance of his stubble. He rubbed his chin and felt perfectly smooth skin.
<P>That's when he noticed his sleeves were longer. He dropped his arms to his sides and watched as they slowly swallowed up his hands. Soon he couldn't even see his fingertips under the fabric.
<P>"That's right," he thought. "I was supposed to remove my clothes first." He sat down on the bench and started to untie his shoes, but then noticed they were so big, he could slip his feet out without bothering. He understood now that he was getting smaller. Undressing wasn't that much of a concern in that case.
<P>Even so, he slipped off his loose pants, revealing forest green boxer shorts, and took off his socks. He saw that his hands were slimmer, almost dainty. Hair started to fall in front of his face as he bent over to pick up his socks and pants and place them on the bench.
<P>In bare feet, he padded back to the mirror to see the rest of his changes unfold. His hair had changed to a glossy blue color, and was now halfway down his back. He was surprised to see such an unusual color, but had to admit it was quite attractive. It gained a beautiful shine and a lot of body.
<P>He noticed a growing weight on his chest. Slowly, his loose shirt began to tent outward, signaling the arrival of breasts. Oliver was horrified. He was actually growing woman's breasts. He cupped them through the fabric and gasped when he felt the touch upon the new sensitive skin.
<P>With trepidation, he reached down to his boxers and patted his crotch area. Nothing. It was gone, replaced by the inner workings of a woman.
<P>"This is crazy," he whispered. He was again surprised when he heard a woman's voice come out of his mouth. He looked into his reflection and saw a real woman standing there in a man's large shirt and boxers. His...her...alluring blue hair framed a narrow face with green eyes, button nose and thick red lips. She had been given a bit of makeup as well. Blush made her cheeks stand out, while her eyes had a bit of blue eyeshadow and longer, thicker lashes. The redness of her lips was enhanced with ruby lipstick. Her fingernails were longer and had blue nail polish.
<P>She slowly started to lift her shirt, scared but also curious to see the hidden parts of her female form. A shuffling noise came from beside her, making her jump and let go of her shirt. The center of the wall with hooks was rotating between the two notches she had noticed earlier. It turned a complete 180 degrees and stopped, realigning with the wall.
<P>An outfit hung on the rotating panel's hook. It was a respectfully simple affair. Pink bra and panties, white socks, armless pink tank top with white hems, blue bell-bottom jeans, black studded belt and pink flip-flops. A tiny bag with some jewelry was pinned to the hangar.
<P>Above the hook, an orange placard said "For effortless changing, press 'Swap'."
<P>Oliver thought she had that instruction figured out. With only a second's hesitation, he pressed the orange button on the wall.
<P>In a flash, the outfit disappeared from the hangar and was replaced by her old shirt, pants, boxers and socks. She was now wearing the entirety of the new wardrobe. The first thing she thought of was how remarkably comfortable everything felt. Her pink top was high cut, showing off a beautifully trim midriff and little belly button. The black leather belt was lined with two rows of square jewel-like studs, and accented her unremarkable outfit nicely.
<P>She also noticed that she wore a necklace with her astrological sign, Aquarius, and had two pink pearl earrings dangling from her ears. On her left wrist was a silver-banded watch, and on her right were two gold bracelets.
<P>Any reservations she had about transforming into a woman were slowly vanishing the more she beheld her gorgeous body. Her hair was a delight. The blue waves looked like a shimmering waterfall as they tumbled across her shoulders and down her front and back. She enjoyed tracing her eyes along her trim, hourglass figure. She turned several times, marveling at her graceful motions and the soft bounce of her wavy hair.
<P>She stopped when it suddenly occurred to her that she had never gotten to see what she looked like naked. Shrugging, she figured it was probably best that she hadn't. The idea of having a woman's sex organs still bothered her, even if she was starting to come around to the notion of looking and dressing like a woman.
<P>Suddenly, the wall turned again, taking her boy clothes with it. On the hook this time was a red purse with a silver clasp. Taking it in her hands, Oliver noticed that her cell phone was in a side pouch and that the main compartment held everything from her pants pockets. A little note stuck up out of the rest of the purse's contents. She pulled it out and read it.
<P>"Dear Olivia, Congratulations! The staff at Body Benders wishes you a great experience in your new look. As per your request, your transformation will last for 24 hours, ending precisely at 4:37pm tomorrow. Keep this card with you to redeem your clothing upon termination of your transformation. Body Benders Order #5832002.
<P>The card addressed her as "Olivia." Seemed like a rather rudimentary choice, but she wasn't about to complain. It'd be harder to get used to a completely different name.
<P>Then came a knock on the door. A woman's voice Olivia didn't recognize called to her. "Ollie, you done in there? Everything okay?"</p>
