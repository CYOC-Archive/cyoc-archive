<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Frank was at the middle school working as the janitor. Frank ignored some of the kids making fun of him. Saying he&#39;s stupid & pathetic & all that. This has happened a lot over the years. You see Frank only has a sixth grade education. He kept failing the seventh grade over and over and over. He had no idea why he kept failing the 7th grade over and over. He always came to school and did his work. It to this day makes no sense to him still. What he has no idea about is his mom being the principal of the very Middle School that he is working at and attended when he was a kid was intentionally changing his grades to F&#39;s so we fail. She even went so far as to Mark him absent when he wasn&#39;t. So after so many times of failing the 7th grade the teacher is just gave up on him and just started marking everything as zeros and sending him out into the hall. The teachers saw no point in teaching him if he was just going to fail the grade. Then when he turned 18 his mom the principal just made him the janitor by doing the paperwork for it. Of course this is very illegal because you cannot just make someone an employee of yours. You can&#39;t just do the job application paperwork for them. Of course Frank has no idea of this. And why did his mom do all this? Because she wanted him to be a failure. His mom had seen him as a total failure from the moment he was born and she wanted to prove prove that he really was one. And to her this was the perfect way to prove it. She even played the pity card &quot;Woe is me my son is so stupid that the only job he can get is a janitor at the very school that he could not graduate from.&quot; <br />
The day ended & it couldn&#39;t be too soon for Frank. Frank headed to the janitor closet & unlocked & headed inside. It was surprisingly kind of roomy in there. Frank removed his shoes and socks revealing the fox Animal Costume footpaws. Frank had been wearing the fox Animal Costume under his clothes all day. He then removed his gloves revealing the fox costume hands. Starting to get impatient Frank began to speed up removing all his clothes. Soon the door opened & out stepped the anthromorphic fox in all his furry glory. The fox picked up a familiar scent and then it walked around the corner. It was the vulture that he had met many times before; but in anthro form. He had never seen the vulture in anthro form. She walked up to him and placed a clawed bird like hand on his shoulder and whispered to him &quot;Let&#39;s pretend we never saw each other here fox.&quot; The fox whispered back &quot;Agreed.&quot; The vulture walked by him & toward the front door. She opened it and walked out and immediately shifted into a feral form vulture. Feral form is the preferred state of this person. She took flight and had to think that was kind of a surprise to find out the fox in the school. The fox headed out of the school too & over to a well hidden cage behind the dumpster. It contained a feral rat in it. Obviously another kid he grabbed and shoved into a Sealed feral rat Animal Costume many hours ago. He opened the cage and whispered to the rat to run. Of course the rat did. The rat that he was not going to get away from the fox. That the fox is going to catch him and devour him. But by this point he didn&#39;t really care. He prefer to die then be trapped forever as a feral little rat. The fox shifted to his feral form dropping to all fours and went after the rat. Soon the fox caught the rat and pounce it giving it the lethal bite he was known for. The fox ate as much as he could of the rat and then began cleaning himself with his tongue. The vulture landed near the fox & his dead prey and shifted into her anthro form. &quot;Can we talk a bit?&quot; The vulture asked. The fox shifted to his anthro form & asked &quot;About what?&quot; The vulture responded with &quot;I&#39;ve been scavenging your leftovers for a while now. And clearly you don&#39;t seem to mind.&quot; The fox told her &quot;Not at all. Someone has to clean it up.&quot; The vulture then said &quot;I propose an agreement. A deal.&quot; Curious the fox asked &quot;What?&quot; &quot;We keep the secret that we seen each other at the same school. That we might have an idea of who each other are. And we keep doing as we have been doing. I scavenging the leftovers of your prey & you not caring.&quot; the vulture said. &quot;Okay.&quot; The fox said a bit confused of that. &quot;It&#39;s very clear that we are both animals regardless of whether or not we are wearing our Animal Costumes. That we prefer to be animals. And I want to keep our relationship that way.&quot; The vulture stated. The fox reply to this with &quot;I don&#39;t care who the hell you are. You are just a bird to me.&quot; The vulture with a slight laugh replied back &quot;I don&#39;t care either who you are. You&#39;re just a fox to me. And frankly I don&#39;t even care where you get these animals we&#39;re both eating from.&quot; The fox was pleased by that he didn&#39;t want to explain anything. The vulture then went to say their name but the fox grabbed her beak holding it shut and telling her almost in a growl &quot;I don&#39;t want to know your name. You were just a vulture to me. As I am just a fox to you. I don&#39;t want us to use stupid names for ourselves. I am a fox through & through. We animals don&#39;t have names nor should we.&quot; The fox let go of the vulture&#39;s beak and she chuckled a bit saying &quot;You&#39;re right. We&#39;re animals. Names are irrelevant to us.&quot; &quot;Good. We understand each other then.&quot; The fox said pleased. The vulture then stated &quot;I&#39;m going to feral form now so I can eat this.&quot; The fox told her being very stern &quot;I don&#39;t want to ever talk to you again. We&#39;re animals. We shouldn&#39;t be communicating like humans.&quot; The vulture chuckled at this saying &quot;No problem. I prefer to be feral when I&#39;m a vulture. You will never see me again as an anthro.&quot; The fox told her being very serious about that &quot;You and I are not going to be living together or anything. I don&#39;t want company. I don&#39;t want a friend so we won&#39;t be. And I sure as hell don&#39;t want you perched or anything around my house.&quot; She told the fox with a chuckle &quot;I have my own place to roost. I don&#39;t hang around your place. And as I stated a minute ago you will not ever see me in anthro form again and we will not be talking again. Also I won&#39;t tell anybody I saw you at the school or you&#39;re an Animal Costume  User like me. I will just treat it like we never met in the school.&quot; She then shifted to feral form & began to eat the remains of the rat. The fox then stated &quot;Agreed. We never saw each other at the school. I have no intention of telling anyone that you&#39;re an Animal Costume User. Because frankly I don&#39;t give a shit. Let&#39;s go back to just knowing each other as animals. Period.&quot; The vulture nodded agreeing to that. The fox then shifted back to his feral form and walked off. He headed back home, went around to his backyard, slipped into his little dug out fox den & went to sleep. He really didn&#39;t think anymore of the vulture. As he stated he doesn&#39;t care who the hell the vulture might be. She&#39;s just an animal as much as he is. And of course for the vulture it&#39;s the same.<br />
<br />
And as an Author Note: the fox & vulture were not caught on the security cameras in the school. Why? Because the cameras are fake cameras. Little hollow dummy cameras. They are just there to give the &#39;illusion&#39; of security. And of course only the principal (Frank&#39;s mom) knows the cameras are fake. The kids of course don&#39;t know and neither does any of the people that work there. Frankly nobody even acknowledges the cameras anyways.</p>
