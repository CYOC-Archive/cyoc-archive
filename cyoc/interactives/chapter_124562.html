<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">as you were browsing the Egyptian section While gathering everything that went with the outfit from jewelry to staffs is when it was all settled. taking the costume, along with the accessories that he was ready to check out while looking around for someone to ring up the purchase. &quot;Sharon&#39;s going to flip when she sees what I got for her!&quot; Jack said.<br />
<br />
looking around for the store owner as the thought of the owner was on lunch that there hasn&#39;t been any sign of them around. while thinking on what to do is when Jake shrugs at this and lays down a few bills on the counter to cover the cost before he leaves to Sharon&#39;s house. after heading over to Sharon&#39;s house as Jake then knocks on her door that it was a few moments later when Sharon appears while she was smiling to see her boyfriend at the foot of her front door step.<br />
<br />
he soon hands her the bag while saying his sorry. &quot;Sorry if it&#39;s not gift wrapped, I didn&#39;t have time to do it myself. I thought this could spice things up a bit.&quot;<br />
<br />
when Sharon opened up the bag to see what was inside that she was stun while also surprised and takes out the costume. her face was filled with excitement as she had a thing for Egyptian outfit to wear, but what her boyfriend gave to her made her day as a knowing smile could be seen on her face. &quot;you got me an Egyptian satis outfit?&quot; she said as she continued. &quot;but why?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jim grins as he soon explained himself why. &quot;well, I know how much you love Egyptian stuff as you&#39;re into this and all that it&#39;s our last time together before going to our new college this year. I figured we could make it an interesting night for us before we enter to our new class together.&quot; as much as Sharon knew about this as they were both selected to enter in this Egyptian college together that Jake was indeed right about one thing though, this maybe their last time together before entering to this Egyptian collage. <br />
<br />
when they both graduated from high school that they were searching for a place to go to collage together, but they were to pricey. one night when they were walking from an theaters after watching an Egyptian movie that a strange person wearing a white clock to cover whoever it was bumped into them while dropping two collage classes to Egypt. without thinking to long about it in the earlier spring that they both had agreed to remain together, despite the driving distance to this Egyptian collage school.<br />
<br />
pulling Jake into the house as Sharon was smiling that They then walk upstairs to her room. once there, she sits him down on her bed. &quot;I&#39;ll be right back.&quot; Sharon said as she walks off in her t-shirt and jeans that Jake was eyeing her with anticipation as she leaves the room. while thinking on what she&#39;ll look like with the outfit on that his thought of fantasy showed him a pitcher of what she would look like in his head. <br />
<br />
as Jake was thinking on what she&#39;ll look like in his head is where Sharon heads into the bathroom down the hall and starts to change out of her clothes that the first thing she took off was her jeans. once the jeans were off that her t-shirt as her underwear, both bra and panties, were the last to be taken off as she wanted to slip into her outfit nude. as she slips her leg into the costume with the other was followed as she then pulled it up to her waist that she felt it to be a tight fit, but keep going on.<br />
<br />
within moments as it was up to her neck that Sharon soon feels a tingling in breasts and other areas while putting on the clothing over her costume. it wasn&#39;t long as it suddenly felt a fair bit more snug on her than it used to. &quot;Strange.&quot; she said as she thought this outfit was slightly loose on her over her other outfit, but shrugs it off as she continued to finish the look.<br />
<br />
before she got the chance to put on her mask that she went over to her mirror and stroke a pose. After a few attempts of posing that she thought she looked great, even without her mask. soon Sharon groans and calls for Jake to come help her fasten with the mask piece over her head as she can&#39;t seem to do it herself. hearing her girlfriend&#39;s call for help that Jake comes over to Sharon as they were now both in the bathroom and started to help fasten her Satis mask over her easily.</p>
