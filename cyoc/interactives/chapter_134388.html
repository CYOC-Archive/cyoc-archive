<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Chad wears on?</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Chad&#39;s hooded head flopped for a moment so he could see the reflection in a mirror of the man who was putting him on.  It was Rick!<br />
<br />
His teammate Rick!   Why would he? Wait Rick was talking, Chad paused to listen.<br />
<br />
&quot;To be or not to be? That is the question?  Or what to be?  Be a quarterback or a leotard? Heh, bet you didn&#39;t think you&#39;d end up being my drama costume, Chad?&quot; he chuckled as he shoved his arms inside Chad&#39;s former arms, which were now gloved sleeves. &quot;Don&#39;t know if you can really still hear me, as you don&#39;t seem to have ears, but Professor Calligastro&#39;s Book says you should be totally aware with all your sensations and faculties.  It even says there&#39;s a way for me to hear your thoughts, or communicate with you.  But I figure you&#39;ll just try to make me feel guilty, and bitch at me for not showering before I put you on.  Sorry, but as soon as the bell tinkled on the bag, I knew you would be inside, and I couldn&#39;t wait to try you on. So skipped the shower this morning, but dude, I don&#39;t smell that bad, do I?&quot;  He raised his arm and sniffed his pit which was clad in Chad.  He half expected to smell Chad, but it all him, and the smell of Spandex in the morning.   He giggled.<br />
<br />
He adjusted his crotch, the Spandex was tighter than he expected, but not as supportive or restrictive as a jockstrap.  He adjusted himself.  He was getting hard.  Oh, yeah, he had been about to jack of his morning wood, when the little bell he attached to the zipper of his gym bag had jingled to announce Chad&#39;s arrival.  He&#39;d jumped out of bed, and run over to the gym bag, his deflating cock forgotten for the moment.  But that moment had passed, and little Ricky needed attention.   Still, Rick wanted to finish trying on Chad.  He hurriedly pulled the hood on, and finished zipping.<br />
<br />
For Chad the experience was surreal.  He was looking at his reflection in the mirror, but it wasn&#39;t his normal reflection looking back.  Rick was lankier, and less muscular - well, his muscles were less defined.  And the featureless zentai costume contained Rick&#39;s build, but Chad knew it was him.  Rick turned around, and it was Rick&#39;s narrow ass, but it was Chad&#39;s all the same?  He was trying to get his head around the smell, taste, and feel of Rick being inside him, when Rick cursed, &quot;Damn, zipper&#39;s stuck!&quot;<br />
<br />
Then Chad noticed the wet warm salty taste coming from his tented smooth crotch.  Chad&#39;s crotch was smooth now, but it was tented by Rick&#39;s boner.  Chad suddenly understood Rick&#39;s frustration with the zipper.  His morning wood disparately needed attention, and it wouldn&#39;t wait.  Don&#39;t tear me! Thought Chad.  Then when he realized what the alternative was, he thought, no not that!  Think of sports scores, take a cold shower, anything but-<br />
<br />
Rick threw himself on his bed, and started pumping his cock with his hand.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, yes! Yes, yes, yes.&quot;<br />
<br />
About ten minutes later, he sighed in relief, and dozed for a few minutes while Chad absorbed the sticky mess inside him.  Rick&#39;s collapsing cock continued to pump or ooze more salty semen as it shrank, long after Rick started snoring.  Chad couldn&#39;t believe he&#39;d been used that wait.  He had to admit it wasn&#39;t the first time, but with Rod, well, Rod hadn&#39;t known or believed, but Rick not only knew and believed, he was responsible, he planned this for Chad.  He was so angry.  He got up and started to stalk towards Rick&#39;s bedroom door, he was going to go home.  He froze as he passed the mirror.  He saw Rick&#39;s zentai clad body reflected in the mirror.  Rick snored again.  Rick was asleep?  How was Chad able to move?  Rick was sleepwalking?  Chad turned around, and checked out his reflection.  The wet spot was gone, not even dried cum was visible.   His Spandex skin vanished inside Rick&#39;s butt crack, Chad noticed distastefully. Suddenly, Rick coughed, snorted, stretched and yawned.  Chad lost control.<br />
<br />
&quot;How&#39;d I get out of bed?&quot; Rick asked himself, &quot;Don&#39;t tell me I&#39;m sleepwalking?&quot;  he shook his head, and tried the zipper on the back of his hood.  It slid easily now.  He chuckled, &quot;Here I thought I was trapped inside you, Chad, guess I was just too worked up to pull the zipper properly.  It works fine now.&quot;  He unzipped, and pulled the hood down, but continued to wear Chad, as he pulled on some shorts, and went down for breakfast.<br />
<br />
His brother Zach was already there eating his cereal when Rick walked in.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s with the kinky pjs, Ricky?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve got a part in the school play,&quot; Rick said filling his empty bowl with cereal.<br />
<br />
&quot;So why are you wearing it now?&quot; Zach said pointedly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Cause I&#39;m going to have to wear it for a matinee and evening show, not mention dress rehearsals, and the drama teacher suggested I wear it all weekend to get used to it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Shouldn&#39;t the hood be over your head?  I mean, if you&#39;re supposed to get used to wearing it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not while I eat,&quot; Ricky explained.<br />
<br />
Zach shook his head and laughed.  &quot;Is that suit sturdy?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, yeah,  made of real sturdy stuff, why?&quot; Rick asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Cause you are playing football against my team this morning, remember?  And if you&#39;re supposed to wear that outfit all weekend, I expect you will wear it for the game, right?  Unless you wanna forfeit?&quot;<br />
<br />
Rick&#39;s spoonful of cereal was in his mouth, so he couldn&#39;t answer right then.  Chad wondered too.</p>
