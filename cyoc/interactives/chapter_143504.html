<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">A wise woman once said that remembrance is most potent under the currents of dreams.  Alice Laverna, otherwise known as Alicia, the self-proclaimed greatest scientist in her time, if not the multiverse, would know. After all, that was the conclusion she made after doing immense studies on the subconscious.<br />
<br />
Alice was still sitting on the ground next to Nat’s fully healed body in the middle of the cloud forest with one hand placed on her forehead. She was still spying in on Nat’s dream through memory lane. The oracle hand mirror she used to keep track of Isaac’s progress was set to the side, laying on the swaying vapor grass. She could always catch up on Isaac’s progress later. One of the perks of having a hand mirror made of mirror ore is that it includes a rewind and recording feature for every peeping needs.<br />
<br />
She is currently waiting impatiently for the right time to... stir up the girl’s sleeping mind a little to see if she is cut out for learning under her guidance. But... For some reason, she couldn’t help but keep watching her resurfacing memories.  She can’t fathom what she’s waiting for. Perhaps she’s just waiting for the right moment to test her? But her experience is telling her that it’s more then that. She can create a nightmare at any time. But for some reason, she simply doesn’t want to interrupt this seemingly ordinary girl’s dream.<br />
<br />
She’ll test this girl... but for now she feels like taking her time. It’s not like the paladin and the other intruders can do any permanent damage to her mansion...<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
“Hey Mary? Do you plan on coming back to visit this town someday?”<br />
<br />
“...”<br />
<br />
Mary remained silent, her only answer being a conflicted expression.<br />
<br />
Their first stop on the tour was the town library. Nat was actually on her way home from the library when she met Mary. Her parents allowed her to go to the library by herself under the condition that she gets home before dark. But since she’s not sure if Mary would ever be coming back to visit, making sure she gives her the best first impression of her hometown takes priority.<br />
<br />
“This is the Town Library! I go here to work as a assistant librarian and read whatever books the library has to offer on my free time! All I know about magic comes from this treasure trove of knowledge!”<br />
<br />
The library building itself doesn’t look all that impressive from the outside. It looks like any other building in town. It’s as if someone turned their own house into a public place. <br />
<br />
“What kind of information does this library have on magic?” Mary asked.<br />
<br />
Nat’s eyes lit at the opportunity to get her new friend to open up to rant about her favorite subject!<br />
<br />
“Most of the magic related books there are fantasy novels full of made up adventures based on myths and commonly known theories about magic. Stuff like travel to other worlds and bending the laws of reality. There’s even stories of the time travel and shooting light out of your hands!”<br />
<br />
“Hmmm.... That’s interesting. What does ‘time travel’ mean?”<br />
<br />
Nat looked at Mary as if she suddenly became a newly born child. “What do you mean, “What is ‘Time Travel?&#39;! Time travel is a fantasy of every kid knows!”<br />
<br />
Mary shook her head. “I wasn’t aware that ‘time travel’ was common knowledge. Is it something like traveling by air or cloud?”<br />
<br />
Nat shook her head in pity. “You really don’t know? Time travel is as the name implies. It’s to travel through time! Imagine being able to transport yourself to a time period were your grandparents were still young, or transporting to a time period were your kids live! Many people have dreamed of having the ability to time travel!”<br />
<br />
Mary looked thoughtful. “That sounds... surprisingly enthralling. Shame that it doesn’t seem possible.”<br />
<br />
“Don’t say that!  It’s theorized that magic is capable making time travel a possibility! With magic, anything is possible! Besides, even if we can’t time travel now, we can still imagine what it might be like! And I believe that magic is the power to make your imagination become reality!”<br />
<br />
Mary nodded in semi interest. “So it’s like optimism come to life. Tell me... What would you do if you had the power of magic? Or the ability to time travel?”<br />
<br />
Nat’s eyes glowed with enthusiasm. “If I had the ability to time travel, I would go to the future and see what it’ll be like! As for magic, I want to see if there is more then just water, light and air! I been hearing legends of all kinds of super rare materials! Like a legendary type of cloud called “Earth”!”<br />
<br />
“Hmmm” Mary hummed.<br />
<br />
“What about you? What would you do with the power to bend reality to your imagination’s whims?”<br />
<br />
There was a moment of silence. <br />
<br />
“Well... If I had the power to travel to another time period, I would travel to the past to see for myself what the history books said were accurate. As for what else magic might be capable of... I don’t know what I would do with it. Time travel is the only thing I can think of at the moment.”<br />
<br />
A thought occurred to Nat, “Are you sure you haven’t  heard of time travel before? You gotta have other kids in your village talking about it. You don’t even have any books on time travel were you came from?”<br />
<br />
 “...”<br />
<br />
“...” Nat stared back into the abyss<br />
<br />
Mary eventually caved in. “I do have books... But their all about facts. Everything that is real about this world. I have heard mention of”magic”, but I was told to not believe in such a thing. Were I came from, the belief of magic was highly looked down upon.”<br />
<br />
Nat couldn’t really comprehend what she was hearing. “That must suck. Was everyone in your home like that?”<br />
<br />
Mary shook her head. “No. My teacher welcomed the possibility of magic. She said that magic was simply science that hasn’t been figured out yet.”<br />
<br />
Nat smiled. “Well I don’t know about ‘science’ and how it can possibly be compared to something as wonderful as magic, but I am glad someone else believes that magic exist.<br />
<br />
Mary simply nodded.<br />
<br />
“What’s that over there?” Mary was pointing to a nearby two-story building.<br />
<br />
Nat nodded in understanding.<br />
<br />
“That’s the town inn. It’s were people who don’t live here go to rent a room to stay in for the night.&quot; She cocked her eyebrow in confusion. &quot;Do you even know what a inn is?”<br />
<br />
Mary didn&#39;t answer. Instead, she pointed to another building.<br />
<br />
“What’s that over there?...”<br />
<br />
“That&#39;s the Mayor’s house.”<br />
<br />
The house itself is unique compared to the other buildings in town.  It was four stories tall, making it the tallest building in town. In edition, there’s a horse shoe mounted above the front door.<br />
<br />
“What’s that horse shoe doing up there?”<br />
<br />
Nat puffed out her chest in pride. “That’s to let us know that is the Mayor’s house! And that’s not a horse shoe, that’s a Pegasus shoe! The Symbol of our town!”<br />
<br />
Mary tilted her head in confusion. “Pray tell. What is the difference?”<br />
<br />
Nat gave her a ‘Are you serious?’ look. <br />
<br />
“Uh... I really don’t know. But I can tell you that really is a Pegasus shoe!”<br />
<br />
“How can you tell?”<br />
<br />
“Umm... Well it goes back to the creation of this town. Supposedly... The founder of this town was a Pegasus!” Nat puffed out her chest even further.<br />
<br />
Mary meanwhile blinked with disbelief.<br />
<br />
“How does that prove the shoe&#39;s authenticity? And are you talking about those animals delivery men use to deliver mail throughout the kingdom? How can a animal create a town?”<br />
<br />
Nat’s cheeked puffed out like the morning sun. “How dare you call Pegasus’ animals!!! They are more then mere animals! They can talk and may even be more wiser then us cloud folk!”<br />
<br />
Mary’s eyes filled with curiosity. “How so? Every book I read on the animal lore didn’t say anything on them being able to communicate with us cloud folk.”<br />
<br />
“Did any of your books had anything on Pegasus?”<br />
<br />
Mary nodded with confidence in her stride. “Yes. About their wing span, how they fly and what makes them different from regular horses. But nothing on a ability to speak. Do you have any proof on such a ability?”<br />
<br />
“Well...” Nat’s head drooped with depression. “...I never actually seen a pegasus before, much less heard one speak before.<br />
<br />
“Then how can you know for sure that pegasus can speak?”<br />
<br />
“Uh... I just know! The town legend has been told around town as a bedtime story for generations!  Pegasus is the town national animal! Pegasus are cool! Don’t you DARE insult them! I beleive-“<br />
<br />
&quot;You still haven’t answered my question. What proof do you have that pegasus are more then mere animals? A legend can be exaggerated over time.” Mary bluntly interjected.<br />
<br />
The flustered look in Nat’s eyes was on the verge of tears. “SHUT UP!!!” <br />
<br />
Nat grabbed Mary’s hand as she dragged her away from the Mayor&#39;s house. “Let&#39;s just continue the tour!”<br />
<br />
It’s getting pretty dark now. The sun setting by now, illuminating the town with a ghastly glow. Her Mom is most definitely worried by now. Heck, Nat wouldn’t be surprised if she saw her walking around town searching for her. <br />
<br />
Mary didn’t resist Nat pulling her along, but she did protest at the sight of the coming night.  &quot;I probably should get going to my destination by now. I mustn&#39;t delay any longer.”<br />
<br />
Nat was afraid she would say that. But she ain’t going to give up.<br />
<br />
“You can just stay at my house for the night. I’m sure staying one night wouldn’t hurt. Besides, if this your last time coming here, we might as well make the most of it. Now let&#39;s finish up this tour as soon as we can.”<br />
<br />
As the two walked through the empty streets, Mary did not say anything. She didn’t protest nor accepted Nat&#39;s offer. Nat kept on holding on to her new friend’s hand as she pulled her along...</p>
