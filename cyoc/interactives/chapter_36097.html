<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">On the way home Karen and Denise didn't talk much. Karen was thinking of how close David had come to raping her. He did molest her and she felt dirty. She knew she would need years of counseling to begin to deal with this.<br />
<br />
Rick's parents followed them home and when they were in the house Tom asked &quot;What was that about? Why did we need to say that this little girl is our daughter? Why do you say that these two are your daughters?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well these two girls are Denise and Karen&quot; Alice said with a hand on their shoulders.<br />
<br />
Karen jerked away and screamed &quot;No! Don't touch me!&quot; She ran to the couch and curled up into a ball while keeping her eyes on the adults.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sorry Karen&quot; Alice said. &quot;I wasn't thinking.&quot;<br />
<br />
Karen just sat there. She knew she shouldn't have done that but she couldn't help it. She was going to need some major help in order for her mother to touch her without that reaction.<br />
<br />
&quot;Poor kid&quot; Tom said. &quot;David really messed her up didn't he. I hope that he rots in hell.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm still confused&quot; Roseanne said. &quot;How can those two girls be your daughters?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We were changed by the Medallion of Zulo&quot; Denise said.<br />
<br />
&quot;You expect us to buy that story?&quot; Roseanne asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;And I suppose Rick was changed as well&quot; Tom said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I was Dad&quot; Rick said.<br />
<br />
&quot;People can't be changed like that&quot; Tom said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes they can&quot; Alice said. &quot;I know how you feel. I wouldn't have believed it if I hadn't witnessed it my self.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll prove that I'm Rick&quot; Rick said. He then started to rattle off things that only they would know. Some of these were very private.<br />
<br />
Finally Tom said &quot;Ok stop. I believe you.&quot; He sat down in a chair and asked &quot;So what do we do now?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well we can't change them back since we don't have the medallion&quot; Alice said. &quot;That means we have to go see Dr. Mezzner yet again.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Who's Dr. Mezzner?&quot; Roseanne asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;She can fix things so everyone will remember the girls as always being girls&quot; Alice said.<br />
<br />
&quot;How can she do that?&quot; Roseanne asked. &quot;I had to have my ovaries removed after Rick was born.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess she'll make it so you didn't have to have your ovaries removed until after Rachael was born&quot; Alice said.<br />
<br />
&quot;We'll need to get her some new clothes&quot; Tom said. &quot;Do you think you can handle being a girl Rachael?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can&quot; Rick said. &quot;I should tell you that this isn't the first time I've been transformed by the medallion.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean?&quot; Roseanne asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Rachael was originally Karen&quot; Alice said. &quot;They accidentally switched bodies two months ago.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How does the medallion work?&quot; Tom asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well you wear it and then touch an item of clothing to it&quot; Alice said. &quot;If the clothing had been worn before the person will transform into the person who last wore the clothes at the time they had worn it. If the clothing hadn't been worn before then the person will be transformed into someone who can wear it. If two people grab the medallion at the same time they will transform into each other.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They had transformed into us to call you&quot; Denise said.<br />
<br />
&quot;They did?&quot; Alice asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes they did&quot; Denise said.<br />
<br />
Alice, Roseanne, and Tom looked horrified. Finally Alice said &quot;I would have never known anything was wrong.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You didn't call the police?&quot; Rick asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;No I didn't&quot; Alice said.<br />
<br />
&quot;We didn't either&quot; Tom said. &quot;Why would we. We had no idea that it wasn't you on the phone. He sounded just like you. Well you as you were when you were male.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think we'll need to have a password to prevent this in the future&quot; Roseanne said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good idea&quot; Alice said. &quot;When I think of what could have happened, it gives me chills. Karen's reaction is bad enough. If they had actually been raped it would be much worse. I just thank God that the police got there when they did.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Who called them though?&quot; Roseanne asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;We may never know&quot; Alice said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alice, could Rachael stay here for the time being?&quot; Roseanne asked. &quot;It's just that we don't have anything for a little girl.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course she can&quot; Alice said. &quot;We should go see Dr. Mezzner.&quot;<br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
At Dr. Mezzner's office they were shown into an examination room and Hanna immediately came in.<br />
<br />
&quot;Back again I see&quot; Hanna said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Unfortunately we are&quot; Alice said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok you brought in three this time&quot; Hanna said. &quot;Two of your children and one other. What happened this time?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Denise's boyfriend used the medallion to change her into an eight year old girl&quot; Alice said. &quot;He also transformed Karen and Rick into eight year old girls.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm assuming that these are Rick's parents&quot; Hanna said indicating Tom and Roseanne.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes we are&quot; Tom said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok I have your form&quot; Hanna said. &quot;You want your son to legally be an eight year old girl. Is that correct?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well we don't exactly want it&quot; Tom said. &quot;We don't have a choice in the matter. He... I mean she needs to go to school in the fall. I do have a question. My wife had to have her ovaries removed a year after Rick was born. How can Rachael be our eight year old daughter?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That won't be difficult to arrange&quot; Hanna said. &quot;Once I'm done all the medical records will indicate that she had her ovaries removed a year after Rachael was born.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How can you do that?&quot; Roseanne asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm not at liberty to say how&quot; Hanna said. &quot;Just know that things will reflect you having Rachael instead of Rick. Now then, do you have the medallion?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No we don't&quot; Alice said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why don't you have it?&quot; Hanna asked. &quot;The brotherhood won't take a medallion from you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It wasn't in our possession&quot; Alice said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I see&quot; Hanna said. &quot;Well I can still see if they have been transformed.&quot; She took out some type of device and scanned Rick, Denise, and Karen. &quot;It was the same medallion that transformed Stephanie.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How do you know that?&quot; Alice asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Each of the Medallions of Zulo were hand made&quot; Hanna said. &quot;They are each slightly different physically and that means that the energy they leave behind is slightly different too. I recognize the energy signature from when you brought Stephanie in.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There's more than one medallion?&quot; Tom asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes&quot; Hanna said. &quot;Now we need to proceed with the exam. Let's start with you Karen. Please take off your clothes and lay back on the table.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mommy!&quot; Karen cried and retreated to her mother. While her mother held her she thought 'At least I can stand her touching me again.'<br />
<br />
&quot;Can we skip it for Karen this one time?&quot; Alice asked. &quot;She was molested not long ago.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's terrible&quot; Hanna said anger clearly visible on her face. &quot;Who did it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It was David, my old boyfriend&quot; Denise answered. &quot;He was going to rape us as we are now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That is just sick&quot; Hanna said. &quot;I can skip Karen in this situation. We don't want her to be harmed any more than she has been. Ok we'll check Denise first then. Will you take off your clothes and lay back on the table?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well...&quot; Denise hesitated.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think I should leave&quot; Tom said.<br />
<br />
After Tom left Denise and Rick let Dr. Mezzner examine them. Karen was going to let Dr. Mezzner examine her but as she was starting to take off her clothes she became frightened again and rushed to her mother.<br />
<br />
After each of them were able to pick out something from a drawer.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is that it then?&quot; Roseanne asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;That's it&quot; Hanna said. &quot;In a short bit Rachael will be your daughter.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you for your time Hanna&quot; Alice said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your welcome&quot; Hanna said. &quot;If you do gain possession of one of the medallions please tell me. Will you do that Alice?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course I will&quot; Alice said.<br />
<br />
With this they went home with Rachael coming with them for a few days.</p>
