<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Received no more recently than three days ago, or rather, more truthfully, created no more <br />
than three days ago, the Old Man in his impatience for &quot;the Game of Change's&quot; always <br />
lengthy return had decided to generate a simpler card version, with equally tantalizing <br />
effects.  The success of card games throughout the world had inspired this idea, and he <br />
hoped he would be able to move the game easier than a board game, which apparently <br />
had lost its once lured appeal amongst the younger generation.<br />
<br />
As the door's bell rung, a young, freshman, high school student walked in, skateboard in <br />
tow; he had spied the card game in the store's display window and thought it had looked <br />
rather intriguing. With beautifully descriptive, albeit somewhat lewd, rendered images <br />
upon each card-face, his robust teen hormones had won the better of him and with all the <br />
courage he could muster, he approached the Old Man with the intent to buy.<br />
<br />
Standing behind the register, a nearly sinister twinkle in his aged eyes, the Old Man <br />
nodded to the lithe teenager as he drew near. &quot;And what can I do for you, sonny?&quot; asked <br />
the Old Man in a withered voice.<br />
<br />
The teenager looked up at the card games stacked in their various boxes behind the Old <br />
Man, and finally, pointed to &quot;The Game of Change's&quot; box-sets. &quot;I'd like to buy six boxes of <br />
that game, please.&quot; he said, rather timidly.<br />
<br />
The Old Man reached behind him, grabbing six of &quot;The Game of Change's&quot; card boxes, <br />
which on their dark cover exposed rather graphically (i.e. anatomically correct) both a male <br />
and female anthropomorphic animal in top physical shape and with exaggerated <br />
endowments. &quot;Ah, so you want this one.&quot; says the Old Man, setting the boxes down in <br />
front of him, &quot;Well, I'm sorry sonny, but as you might guess, this game is for adults only.&quot;<br />
<br />
Shoulders sagging, the teen slightly adjusting his package as his testosterone races, the <br />
alluring images on the game's box catching his eye, especially the over-sized genitals of <br />
the male anthropomorphic animal, he nods his head slowly in response to the Old Man. <br />
&quot;OK.&quot; <br />
he says quietly, sounding defeated.<br />
<br />
With a smile still crooked on his mouth, the Old Man replies, voice slurred and slow, &quot;But, I <br />
think I do have just the game for you...stay here...&quot; Walking away, a subtle glance given <br />
over his shoulder, he leaves the young man with &quot;The Game of Change&quot; boxes in easy <br />
reach as he moves toward the store's back.<br />
<br />
Watching the Old Man as he meanders off, his baggy jeans slightly tented from his arousal, <br />
the teenager can't help but pick up the boxes. Shoving all six quickly into his pocket, he <br />
runs out the door, its bell ringing loudly, and speeding down the mall's outside corridor, <br />
through its dwindling evening crowds, he throws down his skateboard and wildly rides <br />
away from the place as fast as he can.<br />
<br />
Not stopping until he gets home, he comes to rest his skateboard on his house's small <br />
porch. Withdrawing one of the card boxes from his pocket, he eyes the almost <br />
pornographic images on the box's two sides. Smirking, he opens the box, pulling out the <br />
white instruction card shoved within. Unfurling it, he reads its first paragraph:<br />
<br />
&quot;WARNING, The Game of Change: The majority of cards within this deck will directly alter <br />
your genitals and physique, in both positive and negative ways, increasing your physical <br />
size/endowments or decreasing them (this may make your current clothing become <br />
uncomfortable or damaged). However, there are rarer cards within this deck that may also <br />
alter other aspects of you, including your species, sexual preference, and personality. <br />
Safety cards have been built into this deck capable of returning you to normal, pausing <br />
time for a single player (or multiple) for variable rounds, and permitting vocal control over <br />
another player. Please play this game with caution, once a card has been set upon the <br />
playing table, it is activated, regardless if it was the activating individual's turn or not.&quot;<br />
<br />
Laughing to himself, the skeptical teenager shakes his head in disbelief, his eyes roaming <br />
down to a  large title reading 'THE RULES.'<br />
<br />
&quot;The card deck is placed into the playing table's center. Seven cards are drawn by every <br />
player. One card is kept and the remaining six are passed to the adjacent-right player. A <br />
card is kept and repeatedly passed to the adjacent-right player until every player is left <br />
with seven chosen cards, forming their principle hand.<br />
<br />
Player playing order is from left to right. On every player's turn a card from the deck can <br />
be drawn. No more than seven cards can be kept in the player's hand at the end of his or <br />
her turn. A card must be played every turn. More than one card can be played, but at the <br />
turn's end the player must keep at least one card in their hand. To play a card, place it face <br />
down on the table, upright (image exposed). Each card possesses a picture as well as a <br />
description. The picture offers the player some hint of what to expect, the description <br />
specifies the alteration. There are cards within the game that may have a 'grouped effect,' <br />
that when forming pairs, triplicates, etc. create greater, (i.e. more exaggerated changes) <br />
than when alone. To end the game, the entire deck must be exhausted. Every card has a <br />
point value, the individual with the most points wins. The amount of points given for a <br />
card frequently correspond to the card's alteration-severity.&quot;<br />
<br />
As the teen reads, his cell-phone abruptly rings, startling him somewhat. Shoving the <br />
instructions back into &quot;The Game of Change's&quot; card box, and returning it to his pocket, he <br />
flips open his phone. &quot;Hey, what's up, man?&quot; he asks his friend, EUGENE, having <br />
recognized his caller-I.D. &quot;Hey dude!&quot; his friend replies, &quot;Not much, JASON. Me and some <br />
of the dudes are setting up a poker game. You wanna come over and play?&quot; Jason <br />
considers for a moment. &quot;Actually, dude...&quot; he tells Eugene, &quot;I just got this cool card game <br />
with these awesome pictures on it -- its suppose to be for 18 or older, you know.&quot; he <br />
chuckles as he alludes to the game's pornographic cards. &quot;Lets play that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;OK, dude.&quot; Eugene agrees, &quot;Bring it over. See you soon.&quot; Flipping closed his phone, Jason <br />
opens his door, shouting to his parents, &quot;I'm off to Eugene's!&quot; before grabbing his <br />
skateboard and taking off on his way, a slight bulge around his crotch be-telling of his <br />
excitement and eagerness to see the pictures hidden inside the game's deck...his naivety <br />
all the while unaware of the eventful, life-changing night he's about to have with his <br />
friends.</p>
