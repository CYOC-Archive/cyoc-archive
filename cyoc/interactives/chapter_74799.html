<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You were on your way back to Jenny's room, but managed to get yourself rather turned around. You paused, <br />
trying to get your bearings. While the corridors had signs, they weren't the clearest ones. You followed sign <br />
after sign that was marked &quot;residential&quot; down a maze of corridors before realizing you probably weren't even <br />
on the right floor any more, having gone up and down several staircases. Finally, you found a larger sign, <br />
this one similar to a map you'd find in a mall, with the &quot;you are here&quot; dot in the middle of a cross section <br />
of the facility. You were amazed to see it went down at least five floors below the main building on the <br />
surface. As you stood there, tracing lines with your finger and trying to memorize directions back to Jenny, <br />
you felt a breath on your neck and heard a whisper in your ear. &quot;Lost, are we?&quot;<br />
<br />
You turned to see a pretty, but not ravishing woman dressed in a sweater and long skirt. She had dark hair and <br />
even darker eyes, nearly black. &quot;Uhh..yeah,&quot; you said, rubbing your neck uneasily.<br />
<br />
She smiled. &quot;Happens to the best of us. I'm Judith.&quot; She extended her hand out to you with a warm smile.<br />
<br />
You reached out and took it. &quot;I'm..&quot; you shivered as a blast of undeniable pleasure went through you. &quot;I'm <br />
Steve..I just got hired.&quot; She massaged your hand with her thumb, and every touch sent another current of <br />
pleasure through you. You couldn't help but smile..she seemed so nice, and on second glance, she looked much <br />
prettier. Something felt off, though, and you pulled your hand away. The sensation immediately stopped, and <br />
you looked at her again. Once more she simply was &quot;cute&quot;, as though some of her attractiveness had faded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck..&quot; you said, shivering a bit as the last remnants of her energy crawled up your spine. &quot;You're a <br />
supernatural, aren't you?&quot;<br />
<br />
She paused, cocking her head slightly. &quot;And you're abnormally strong-willed for a human.&quot; Her demeanor never <br />
changed. It was outwardly very friendly though her curiosity about you was clearly piqued. &quot;I'm a succubus,&quot; <br />
she helpfully informed you, sticking her tongue out and letting you see its forked tip.<br />
<br />
&quot;That explains it,&quot; you said, nodding. Though you knew you should probably be on your way, she was just so <br />
pleasant to be around, plus you really DID need to get to know the people here, as well as how to get along <br />
with them. &quot;So, you're one of the models?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sometimes,&quot; she said. &quot;Other times, I'm a photographer, due to my unique talents. Other times, I'm helping <br />
out in research. I do a lot around here, probably more than most people realize.&quot; Her eyes focused on the <br />
needle hole in your arm. Ms. Adair had been rather rough, and there was some bruising. The wound itself had <br />
seeped a small bit, and while the blood had clotted, it still glistened, slightly fresh.<br />
&quot;Aww..&quot; she said, licking her lips slightly, which indicated she wasn't being PURELY sympathetic. &quot;Ms. Adair <br />
stuck you good, huh?&quot; She looked you dead in the eyes, and her pupils expanded until her eyes were pure black. <br />
&quot;Why don't you let me fix that for you?&quot; Her voice echoed inside of your mind, and a wave of pleasure washed <br />
through you.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure,&quot; you said with a smile, holding your arm out to her. Her forked tongue licked over your wound, and she <br />
sucked at it lightly. The pleasure built and built as your smile grew. Her breathing became stronger and more <br />
labored, and then suddenly she pulled away, breaking the connection. Her eyes stayed black for a few seconds <br />
longer, and she grinned widely at you. You could see small horns had pushed out of her skull just at her <br />
hairline, though they slowly receded, as did her elongated canines.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck..&quot; you said, wobbling a little unsteadily. You felt slightly drained, though when you glanced at your <br />
arm, there was no puncture or bruising.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry..&quot; she said with an impish smile. &quot;I...got a little carried away. I wasn't REALLY trying to feed on <br />
you..much.&quot; You found it impossible to really stay mad at her, despite the fact she clearly had taken a bit of <br />
a liberty with you.<br />
<br />
&quot;So..what WERE you trying to do?&quot; you asked, trying to focus. It was hard keeping your thoughts in line.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow..you really DO have a strong will..are you SURE you're human? Like..ALL human?&quot; Judith wasn't even trying <br />
to hide her curiosity about you now. &quot;Well..what I was trying to do was to use my own energy..which is pure <br />
sex..to heal you. It's what a succubus feeds on. Lust..love..attraction.. But we can shape it. We can use it <br />
not just to effectively be immortal, but to do other things..like heal you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So it's like magic?&quot; You asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's all energy, Steve,&quot; she said with a smile. A light blue energy crackled on her fingertips, which you <br />
noticed.<br />
<br />
&quot;So that's..what sex energy looks like?&quot; you asked, nodding to her hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;You can SEE that??&quot; Judith was clearly surprised now. &quot;That's seriously unexpected. Really..are you SURE, <br />
like a hundred percent sure that you're human?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;As sure as I can be,&quot; you replied. &quot;Though I'm not sure how I'd know if I wasn't. They don't exactly give you <br />
a test in school for it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Your parents would have told you,&quot; she said. &quot;I mean..obviously you're not a shifter. I could have smelled <br />
that on you, and even if I couldn't for some reason, I would have tasted it. Shifters and vamps have a very <br />
distinct energy and flavor. Sometimes shifters don't fill their kids in on things, for reasons I'll never <br />
understand. But the other types..it's kind of a standard thing..mom and dad explain why you shouldn't feel <br />
insane because the world stops making sense to you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I was orphaned as a kid. I ended up doing the foster home circuit til I was sixteen. I managed to get <br />
emancipated and out of that hell. I have no real idea who my parents were. Though I feel pretty safe in saying <br />
that they were human,&quot; you told her. It was easy to open up and talk to her. She was just so nice!<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, you're a lot more sure than I am,&quot; she said rather flatly. &quot;So, how's your first day been? I'm assuming <br />
this is your first day, since you're clutching that temp badge for dear life.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I never would have imagined a place like this existing, let alone all of the...different sorts of girls that <br />
are here,&quot; you told her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tell me all about it,&quot; she said, smiling and reaching out to stroke your hand. That energy went through you, <br />
and you smiled. She was so nice. You promptly told her everything, and she listened patiently, constantly <br />
stroking your hand and forearm. The more you looked at her, the prettier she got. She actually looked a lot <br />
like Jenny the more you thought about it. Wait..this WASN'T RIGHT! You pulled away from her.<br />
<br />
&quot;GODDAMNIT stop that!&quot; you snapped at her.<br />
<br />
She grinned that impish grin, and you were unable to stay upset. &quot;Sorry,&quot; she giggled, even as your anger <br />
melted away. &quot;It's a habit..and you have tasty energy..&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well..just go easy on me,&quot; you said quietly, giving her a half-smile. <br />
<br />
&quot;So, you got to score Jenny last night, hmm?&quot; she asked, giving you a nod of approval. &quot;Very nice. I only had <br />
a chance to ride that ride once. Lycan girls give the BEST oral; that long tongue and muzzle do things that no <br />
human could muster, am I right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She..actually stayed human-looking the whole time,&quot; you told her, doing your best not to be surprised that <br />
Jenny had encounters with partners besides you.<br />
<br />
&quot;She DID? Verrrrrry interesting. I must say, Steve..you certainly are FULL of surprises,&quot; Judith told you, <br />
nodding her head in thoughtful approval. &quot;So is she the only one you've been with? Like the only <br />
supernatural?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; you replied. &quot;Though Ms. Adair implied that it wouldn't be the only time, or at least not the only <br />
opportunity.&quot; You regretted saying that, but it was just so easy to confide in Judith.<br />
<br />
&quot;In case you hadn't noticed, there's a MASSIVE overload of sexual tension and energy here,&quot; she told you. &quot;I <br />
mean..simply BEING here is enough to keep me effectively immortal. But supernaturals..and their sex energy is <br />
just overabundant, and it's very tasty. A human would die or be exceedingly hurt if I REALLY opened up and <br />
fed. But the immortals..particularly the shifters..WOW...&quot; You could feel that pleasure energy reaching out <br />
and caressing you simply from Judith thinking about it. <br />
<br />
She grinned at you again. &quot;Say...how about you and me..we grab a lycan girl and have some REAL fun before <br />
work, huh?&quot;<br />
<br />
You immediately thought of Jenny. You really needed to get back to her. &quot;Uhh..I should probably be getting <br />
back to Jenny.&quot;<br />
<br />
Judith frowned. &quot;So you guys have some sort of exclusivity arrangement?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; you replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I'm sure she'd understand, Steve. It's not like you two are dating. Hell, for all you know, she's <br />
getting her wolf on right now with some other girl.&quot; Judith had a good point. Still, you hesitated.<br />
Judith's eyes went black, and her energy surrounded you. Her voice once again echoed in your mind. &quot;You don't <br />
want to disappoint her because you don't know how to please a lycan once she's shifted, do you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;N..no..&quot; you muttered, suddenly worried that the real reason why Jenny hadn't changed last night was because <br />
she knew you couldn't please the wolf.<br />
<br />
&quot;We can fix that. Just come along with me. I'll get us a lycan and we'll both have some fun, and you'll learn <br />
something, okay?&quot; she smiled and you felt better. It made sense to listen to her. Judith knew what she was <br />
talking about.<br />
<br />
The moment she turned away from you though, you hesitated, trying to sort your thoughts.</p>
