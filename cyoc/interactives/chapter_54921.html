<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">For several seconds after her comment you have no idea what to say. It Stacy flirting with you, is this just 'girl talk', or are not hearing her correctly? One thing is clear, and that's that she expects a response.<br />
<br />
&quot;Umm thanks?&quot; your hesitant words seem to disappoint her and you quickly continue hoping that you're doing the right thing, &quot;You're the one who picked out this outfit for me though so if I look good it's thanks to you.&quot;<br />
<br />
It must have been the right thing to say, because she smiles, &quot;Do you like dressing like that?&quot;<br />
<br />
She sounds hopeful and though your honest feelings about the situation are that it was fun to do once, you decide to keep playing along. Once you've had your fun you can use the light to change yourself back after all.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's different to say the least,&quot; you smile at her, &quot;But I guess it's fun.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh you two lovebirds,&quot; Jenny interrupts your conversation with a laugh, &quot;Should the rest of us just leave you so you can have some time alone?&quot;<br />
<br />
Stacy blushes furiously and looks away.<br />
<br />
Apparently she is still interested in you, which comes as a relief to you, as well as making you curious. How has your relationship with her changed due to your changes? Maybe you will take up Jenny's offer of having some alone time with Stacy, but then Stacy speaks up.<br />
<br />
&quot;You can't get rid of us that easily!&quot; she says with a laugh, &quot;This is our official girl's day out.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;True,&quot; Tammy counters, &quot;But he's hardly a girl.&quot;<br />
<br />
She points at you and you laugh, &quot;Look at how I'm dressed. If you weren't the ones who helped me pick out this outfit and didn't know me, would you think that I'm a guy?&quot;<br />
<br />
Megan nods, &quot;He's got a point you know and he's been such a good sport for letting us give him a makeover. I mean have either of you ever had boyfriends who would let you dress them up like girls? We should reward him.&quot;<br />
<br />
You're not sure where this conversation is going, but you like it.<br />
<br />
&quot;What sort of reward?&quot; Stacy asks defensively.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoa, calm down,&quot; Megan puts her hands up, &quot;I just wanted to invite him to hang out with us at my place tonight. I mean since my parents are out of town for the weekend I don't see any harm in inviting one more guest to the little pool party we planned on having.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess...&quot; Stacy doesn't sound so sure and you're ready to say that you're not all that interested in going when Jenny lets out an evil laugh.<br />
<br />
&quot;He needs a bathing suit.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I've already got - &quot; you start, but Jenny doesn't let you finish.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't you think he'd look good in a bikini?&quot; she gives Stacy a wink and after a long, thoughtful silence, Stacy nods.<br />
<br />
You start to protest, but the hopeful look Stacy is giving you, coupled with the thought of getting to hang out with her and her friends at a pool party where you're the only guy is too much to turn down.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, but nothing too crazy, okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
They agree, and in the end they don't even make you try on the bright yellow bikini they pick out for you, saying that they want to be surprised when they see you in it.<br />
<br />
Spending that much time around girls shopping is enough for you, and you excuse yourself, saying that you need to go home to take care of a few things around the house and that you'll meet with them later on at Megan's house.<br />
<br />
When you get home your father still hasn't gotten back from work, something you're thankful for since you're not sure how he would respond to seeing you dressed up as a girl. Having your mother see you this way seems risky enough.<br />
<br />
Hoping for the best, and keeping your hand on the flashlight just in case, you walk into the kitchen where your mother is preparing dinner.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi mom,&quot; you say quietly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi honey,&quot; she then turns and looks at you, &quot;I guess you were at the mall today.&quot;<br />
<br />
Her lack of response to the way you're dressed surprises you, making you wonder just how powerful the flashlight's ability to alter reality is.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; now that you're having talking to her, you've got no clue what to say, &quot;I met up with Stacy and some of her friends. We went shopping and they invited me to hang out with them later.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's nice,&quot; your mother smiles warmly, &quot;And did you pick out that outfit yourself? Because you look much better like that than in the baggy stuff you usually wear. I know you're not like the other boys, but you have a nice enough body and I'm glad you're finally dressing to show it off.&quot;<br />
<br />
Now things are getting interesting. This is the perfect chance for you to see how different things are.<br />
<br />
&quot;You're not upset that I'm dressing like a girl?&quot;<br />
<br />
Your mother thinks for a bit and shrugs, &quot;If it makes you happy I don't care if you dress that way.&quot;<br />
<br />
Deciding not to pursue the issue any farther, you head you your room. When you pass the living room your little brother turns away from the television just long enough to look at you and laugh, but you ignore him.<br />
<br />
Once in your room you look down at yourself. Dressed the way you are you look like a very tall prepubescent girl. It's kind of creepy, but at the same time it's interesting.<br />
<br />
Putting the bags from your shopping experience down on your bed you start to undress, carefully putting the flashlight next to the rest of your purchases.<br />
<br />
Once undressed you look yourself over again. Aside from you cock, which is all but lost in your downy pubic hair, and your balls which are shriveled to nothing, you don't look particularly male or particularly female. You start to pick up the flashlight to turn yourself back to normal, but think better of it. You still have that pool party to go to and if you change yourself back to normal things might change so that you're no longer invited.<br />
<br />
You think of the girls, especially Stacy, in their bathing suits, the wet fabric clinging to their every curve and gently press a finger against you minuscule cock, trying to stimulate yourself, but something's not quite right. The thought of girls doesn't really do anything for you, at least not at first. Even the feeling of pressure from your finger against your cock is different, less intense. You cup yourself in your hand, pressing and rubbing as hard as you dare, all the while thinking of your girlfriend. Just like what had happened with Gene during your first tests of the light's power, you realize that you have removed your sex drive, but the strangest part is that you're not as worried as you feel you should be.<br />
<br />
You can still remember what sex feels like and how much fun it is, but at the same time you're not all that interested in having it at the moment. You can imagine yourself with Stacy, and that thought is pleasant enough, but it's difficult to imagine actually having sex with her. The notion of entering her just doesn't seem that fun anymore.<br />
<br />
Shrugging, you stop trying to play with yourself and go back to thinking about the pool party. Just because you don't want to have sex with her right now doesn't mean that you're not interested in Stacy anymore and the thought of spending time with her and her friends is exciting enough, just not in a sexual way.<br />
<br />
That thought causes you to remember the bikini the girls got for you and expect you to wear. You take it out of the bag and hold it up, feeling more than a little silly, still, the girls expect you to wear it and after tonight you're going to change yourself back to normal, so you might as well have some fun. You did do this to experiment after all.<br />
<br />
You start with the bikini bottom since that's the easiest, just a matter of pulling it up and adjusting it a bit. Your masculine anatomy hardly makes a bulge in the front and with the way the fabric clings to you, there's no risk of falling out of the thing either. In fact the pressure and softness of the fabric is rather pleasant for your changed anatomy.<br />
<br />
The top takes a bit more work, the strings holding it up needing to be adjusted and tied. In the end you have to go to the bathroom so you can look at yourself in the mirror to get it right. Once everything is in place, you look at yourself in the mirror, the two triangles of cloth looking terribly out of place on your flat chest. At first you have second thoughts, then you get an idea.<br />
<br />
Smiling at the thought, you hurry back to your room and get the flashlight. You wanted different, so you might as well do something a bit drastic. Anyway, it will be interesting to see how the girls treat you once you show up. Already confident of the light's ability to adjust clothing from what you did to Gene and to yourself earlier, you turn the light to its highest pink setting.<br />
<br />
Your hand shakes slightly as you turn it toward your chest, then you press the button.<br />
<br />
The change is instant. One moment there's nothing, then there's a feeling of pressure and weight. The bikini top, seconds ago pressed tight against your flat chest now struggles to contain your breasts.<br />
<br />
Taking a step, you watch as your breasts move, their soft flesh shifting with every shift in your weight and rising and falling as you breath. The feeling of how they jiggle is strange at first, but by the time you walk across your room to hide the flashlight in the bottom of your sock drawer, you're starting to get used to it.<br />
<br />
You walk in a slow circle around your room, watching your new anatomy, then you head back to the bathroom, wanting to get a better look at yourself.<br />
<br />
The rest of your body is still androgynous, but with your new breasts there's no way anyone would think that you're a guy unless they got a close enough look at your cock and balls. <br />
<br />
Curious, you untie the strings of the bikini and immediately your breasts hang lower, their weight feeling even heavier. They don't exactly sag, at least not as bad as their size might have suggested, but they lose some of their roundness. Cupping one in each hand you marvel at their warm weight, each one more than a handful. You gently press your fingers into their softness, looking at the size of your nipples and how big and dark your areolas have become. You're not the best judge of such things, but if you had to take a guess, you'd say that your new breasts were a very large d-cup.<br />
<br />
It might be because the breasts are yours, but handling them is not half as interesting as you had hoped. Your nipples do perk up at the attention you give them, which is fascinating at first, but after several minutes of examination you find that your new breasts are no more interesting than any other part of your body. Taking one last look in the mirror and shifting your weight a bit to watch how they bounce, you re-tie your bikini top. <br />
<br />
Having your breasts supported once again makes you realize how much more comfortable it is that way, giving you a new appreciation for bras and what girls have to put up with. On your way out of the bathroom you grab a towel, figuring that you should bring your own to the pool party, then go back to your room to get dressed.<br />
<br />
Because the girls invited you and because Stacy seemed really excited by your being willing to dress like a girl, you put the outfit the girls bought you on over your bikini. The magic of the flashlight having changed reality, the top has changed to fit you even though it was bought when you were flat chested. The bra the girls got for you has also changed, a quick look at the tag revealing that your new breasts are a double-d.<br />
<br />
Interestingly, your examination of the bra show that the changes to it are rather drastic. Originally it was a plain, white training bra, but now it's a far sturdier article of clothing, padded and possessing under wire for added support. It's also turned pink and lacy to match the panties the girls bought for you.<br />
<br />
As fascinating as the discovery is, you decide that it can wait for later. You've got a party to go to.<br />
<br />
On your way out of your room, you consider getting the flashlight, but think better of it. The last thing you want to do is risk it getting lost or broken with you the way you are right now.<br />
<br />
You wave goodbye to your mother, then head out the door and drive to Megan's house.<br />
<br />
The girls are already in the pool when you get there, you can hear them splashing around, so you open the gate and let yourself into the back yard.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi everyone!&quot; you call out.<br />
<br />
Stacy waves to you, a huge smile on her face, &quot;You can put your stuff on one of the chairs so it won't get wet.&quot;<br />
<br />
All four of them stop what they're doing to watch you as you put your towel on a nearby chair. Tammy and Megan burst into giggles when you take off your blouse and Stacy silences them by splashing them.<br />
<br />
When you take off your skirt and turn around to face them, Jenny begins to clap and Stacy ducks her head under water.<br />
<br />
You look at the four of them with their lean, bathing suit clad bodies, and smile. This is going to be fun.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on in!&quot; Stacy laughs, staring at you, eyes wide.<br />
<br />
&quot;If you insist!&quot; you start running to the pool, the feeling of your breasts bouncing as you do so a reminder of what you've done to yourself.<br />
<br />
You splash and swim with the girls, listening as they talk about boys and fashion and other things you don't find very interesting. At first you look at them, taking in the sights, but before long you forget that you're in the pool with four gorgeous girls and it feels the same as being in the pool with a a group of friends.<br />
<br />
Eventually Stacy swims over to you and the two of you gradually drift to the side of the pool away from the others. She's silent, looking at you without making eye contact. After several awkward minutes, you realize that she's staring at your breasts, which only makes things even more awkward.<br />
<br />
&quot;So...&quot; you try to think of something to say, watching as she blushes and looks away, &quot;No, wait, don't feel bad. I mean you are my girlfriend.&quot;<br />
<br />
As soon as the words leave your mouth you worry. What if things have changed and you're not dating any more? But to your relief, she looks back and smiles.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know,&quot; she giggles and hugs you, her breasts pressing against yours, &quot;It's just that seeing you dressed like a girl...it's...I don't know, it really turns me on and...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Seriously, don't worry,&quot; you hug her back, amazed at how different it feels to hug her now that you have breasts as well, &quot;I'm cool with it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Since once you get home you'll be back to normal it's even easier to be cool with the situation, but there's no way to tell her that.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks,&quot; she frees one of her arms and cups your right breast in her hand, giving you a gently squeeze.<br />
<br />
You're about to kiss her when you hear someone surface behind you, then there's a pull at your back and you feel your bikini top taken away.<br />
<br />
&quot;I got it!&quot; you hear Jenny cry gleefully.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jenny!&quot; Stacy cries, but you can't help notice that for all her outrage, she looks at your naked breasts with obvious lust in her eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Toss it here!&quot; Tammy shouts, pulling herself out of the pool.<br />
<br />
Jenny complies and Tammy takes off running, Stacy hot on her heels.<br />
<br />
You leave the pool as well, used to being a guy and going shirtless, you completely forget that with breasts things might be a little different now.<br />
<br />
The four of you chase each other around the pool while Megan looks on with an amazed smile.<br />
<br />
Just as Stacy reaches Tammy, she tosses the top back to Jenny, and you run after her, exposed breasts wobbling wildly as you do, but she's too quick, and sends the bikini flying back to Tammy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nice try cutie,&quot; she winks and gives your breasts a playful squeeze, prompting a cry of outrage from Stacy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't you dare do that to my boyfriend!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on,&quot; Tammy giggles, holding the bathing suit out of her reach, &quot;You get to see those juicy breasts all the time and I bet he lets you squeeze them too. You were telling me just the other day about how much you'd like to suck on those big tits of his!&quot;<br />
<br />
This is a surprise to you, since before Stacy was very reserved, but you have no time to ponder than.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yeah?&quot; Stacy tries to sound threatening, but bursts into giggles, &quot;Two can play at that game!&quot;<br />
<br />
To your amazement she grabs Tammy and pulls off her bathing suit top.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey! That's not fair!&quot; Tammy laughs, but instead of trying to get her own top back, she runs away, her perky little breasts jiggling as she moves, &quot;Now I'm never going to give it back!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Watch it Stacy!&quot; Jenny grabs you, &quot;I'll kiss your boyfriend if you don't stop me!&quot;<br />
<br />
She leans in and you do the first thing that comes to mind, you pull her bathing suit top off as well.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh no!&quot; she lets go of you and tries to get her top back, but you keep it away from her.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's a stand off now!&quot; you announce, but none of them listen to you, instead they're more focused on chasing each other around, except for Jenny, who starts tickling you.<br />
<br />
You fall over giggling, &quot;Stop it! Stop it!&quot;<br />
<br />
Stacy rushes to your rescue, trying to pull Jenny away from you, but Tammy gets in the way and the two of them slip and fall on the wet grass. Before long it's a free for all, the original goal of getting your bikini top back forgotten. The four of you roll on the ground, a frenzy of soft wet skin and giggling girls.<br />
<br />
When it's all over, you and the rest of them are a mess, grass sticking all over your wet bodies. The only one who's fully clothed and clean is Megan, who never left the pool.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh wow,&quot; Stacy sits down next to you, exhausted, but smiling, &quot;My friends aren't always this crazy you know.&quot;<br />
<br />
In your opinion there's nothing for her to apologize for, since she, Tammy and Jenny are all topless and none of them seem to care.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't worry,&quot; you brush a bit of grass off Stacy's shoulders as you say this, and she responds by starting to pick grass out of your hair, which though slightly longer, is still short enough so as to not be a total mess like hers.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow is right,&quot; Jenny giggles, &quot;I'm a total mess.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No you don't&quot; Stacy scolds playfully, &quot;You started it so you'll have to wait. I get first shower.&quot;<br />
<br />
As she says that last bit she winks at you, &quot;But we can save some water if you want.&quot;<br />
<br />
You don't need to be told twice. Getting up, you follow her into the house and into the bathroom.<br />
<br />
She's definitely more assertive than she was before, you decide, as you watch her take off her bathing suit bottom. You follow suit, trying to decide how you feel about the change to her personality. It wasn't as strong at the mall earlier, or at least you don't think so. Are the changes to reality getting stronger or did you manage to not notice? It's a frightening thought, but then you remember that you gave yourself breasts between leaving the mall and coming to the party, but would that be enough to cause such a change?<br />
<br />
Stacy hugs you, and you forget about your concerns for the time being.<br />
<br />
You're still attracted to her, just not in the same way. It's kind of hard to make sense of really.<br />
<br />
Still trying to make sense of things, you watch her as she turns on the water and steps into the shower.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on, let's have some fun. Seeing you dressed like than and then wrestling on the lawn has me feeling frisky,&quot; before you can respond she grabs you by the hand and pulls you into the shower, then kisses with you a ferocity that takes you completely off guard.<br />
<br />
One hand rubs at your breasts, the other drifts lower and you feel her fingers against your cock. Again, the sensation doesn't feel as strong as it would have been had you been normal, but the situation and surprise of it all more than makes up for it.<br />
<br />
Breaking the kiss, she lowers her head and licks your breasts, flicking her tongue across your engorged nipples, &quot;Tammy was telling the truth.&quot;<br />
<br />
Not sure what else to do, you just nod.<br />
<br />
She kisses your nipples, then takes one in her mouth, gently biting it, sending chills down your spine and starting a warm feeling in your stomach. Then she begins to suck, so hard that it's almost painful.<br />
<br />
Groaning, you wrap your arms around her and press her close. Putting your hand on top of hers, you press it down harder against your cock and begin to rub against her.<br />
<br />
Taking her mouth away from your breast she gives a deep throaty laugh and pressed her hand even harder against your cock, adjusting her grip so that your cock is at the heel of her hand and her fingers are pressing against the place between your balls and asshole.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you want a kiss?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; you gasp out, not sure if there's a subtext to what's happening that you're not getting.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll kiss you, then you've got to kiss me back,&quot; she laughs again and drops to her knees, planting a feather light kiss on the tip on your cock, which has finally gotten hard. Looking down you can see its head flushed pink and barely visible though your pubic hair. Even hard it's still less than an inch long, not that you have it in you to be bothered by that at the moment, not when what Stacy is doing to you feels so good. More than that, it feels good in ways you've never experienced pleasure before. Her new, dominant attitude further adding to the excitement of the situation.<br />
<br />
She gives your cock another gentle kiss, then her tongue slips from between her parted lips and across your cock head. You let out a hiss of pleasure, then she takes your cock and balls into her mouth, which as small as they are is a very easy thing for her to do. It feels good, but all too soon she lets go.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now you need to kiss me,&quot; Stacy stands up and puts her hands on your shoulders, pushing you down to your knees, and you follow willingly, &quot;Kiss me hard.&quot;<br />
<br />
She hisses through clenched teeth as you find yourself at eye level with her neatly trimmed triangle of pubic hair.<br />
<br />
You use the fingers of one hand to part that hair, allowing you to see her clit, and pussy lips, flushed and swollen with excitement. Your other hand has gone between your legs to press against your hard little cock.<br />
<br />
Her fingers work their way through your hair, clenching and un clenching as she presses you against herself. You've eaten her out once before, but it wasn't like this, nowhere near half as exciting, because then she had been hesitant, nervous, <br />
You kiss her clit and are rewarded by a moan. Encouraged, you kiss her harder, sucking at her clit and making her squirm. Then you let your tongue slip between the warm, wet folds of her pussy lips, exploring the heat within. Her juices mix with your saliva and drip down your chin.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes! Yes!&quot; she rubs against you and presses even harder.<br />
<br />
You keep licking and kissing, listening as her breathing becomes increasingly ragged. Finally, you feel her tense, shudder and then relax as she orgasms.<br />
<br />
&quot;You're so good,&quot; she sighs, allowing you to get up, &quot;Did you have fun?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yeah,&quot; you smile, amazed at just how much you enjoyed it. Only one detail about it all bothers you, &quot;I'm still...&quot;<br />
<br />
You trail off and look down, not sure what to say, your cock is still hard, but for some reason you're not all that upset by it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm,&quot; Stacy looks thoughtfully at your cock, and presses a finger against its head, making the feeling of warmth that had been growing within the pit of your stomach intensify, &quot;I know how hard it is to get you to orgasm.&quot;<br />
<br />
She presses her hand hard against you again, encouraging you to rub against it, and you gladly comply. You spend several minutes rubbing against her, enjoying the pressure and friction but nothing comes of it.<br />
<br />
Finally she pulls away, &quot;I'm sorry. Should be getting out before the others start to complain, but don't worry. I've got an idea. Come by my place tomorrow afternoon and we can do this again.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; you're not too terribly disappointed about having to stop, especially not with the promise of getting the chance to do this all over again tomorrow.<br />
<br />
The two of you get out of the shower, dry off and get dressed.<br />
<br />
The rest of the girls wave goodbye as you get in the car and head home.<br />
<br />
By the time you arrive home it's dark and after what you've been through you're exhausted.<br />
<br />
Not even bothering to change yourself back, you get undressed and go to bed.<br />
<br />
As soon as your head hits the pillow you're sound asleep.</p>
