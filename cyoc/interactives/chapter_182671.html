<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After just one week into the quarantine, the Wilsons are beginning to see the downsides of constantly sharing such a tiny space. Matthew made his way into the bathroom with a small towel. Most of the bathroom was taken up by the bathtub, with the sink crammed into the corner. A limp shower head dangled pathetically from the wall. The room was so small, Matthew couldn’t fully stretch his arms out without one of them hitting the grey walls. It didn’t matter to him. Matthew didn’t need much space; just a door that locked.<br />
<br />
He sniffed his armpit and recoiled. <br />
<br />
As he turned the shower on, he slowly stripped, dropping his vest and shorts onto the ground. <br />
He flexed his bicep, admiring his naked self in the cracked mirror. Climbing into the tub, he sighed blissfully as the water ran along his body. It was warm at first, but gradually turned scalding hot. The heat massaged his muscles, and he gently ran his hands down his chest. He had been feeling pent over the past few days, however just as he was reaching for his manhood, he heard the handle of the bathroom shake violently.<br />
<br />
Someone was trying to get in.<br />
<br />
“Someone’s in here!”<br />
<br />
He yelled, his hands just inches away. <br />
<br />
“Can you hurry up? I really need to go!”<br />
<br />
It was Harry’s voice. Matthew sighed frustratingly.<br />
<br />
“No! Leave me alone!”<br />
<br />
Harry knocked loudly on the bathroom door again. Mathew was tempted to continue, but couldn’t with his step-brother making that racket. He grunted, reluctantly wrapping the small towel around his waist and picking up his clothes, holding them over his crotch. He met Harry with cold, bitter eyes.<br />
<br />
Harry was taken aback at the sight of his half-naked step-sibling. Wide shoulders and defined pecs over an impressive set of abs, all dripping wet. He didn’t dare look any further. He forgot to say “thank you” as Matthew stormed back into his room, leaving a trail of water on the floor. <br />
<br />
Matthew’s room looked messier than ever. Gone was the usual scent of deodorant, with the smell of sweat and musk in its place. Matthew quickly chucked his clothes aside and jumped on the bed, grabbing a large rugby sock from his gym bag. <br />
<br />
“Fuck it. I need this.”<br />
<br />
He thought as he wrapped the sock around his member, which began to harden again as he scoured the internet on his phone for porn. However, before he could even begin, he heard another knocking sound, this time on his bedroom door. He let out an annoyed shout.<br />
<br />
“What is it?”<br />
“Could you do the dishes? I can’t make dinner with all the mess.”<br />
<br />
It was Dad. “Fuck’s sake!” He thought as he threw the sock to one side and got up, using the towel to dry himself. He put on some loose joggers and a t-shirt, and briskly made his way to the kitchen. A huge pile of pots, pans, plates, and cutlery filled the large sink. Martin was sitting at the table, browsing through his phone. He smiled at his son, who was too focused to smile back.<br />
<br />
“The sooner I do this, the sooner it’s finished.”<br />
<br />
Matthew thought to himself as he grabbed one of the pots and began scrubbing. Martin chuckled lightly to himself.<br />
<br />
“Easy there! You’re gonna snap it in half.”<br />
“You said you wanted them done, right?”<br />
“Fair enough. Have you noticed anything different about me?”<br />
<br />
Matthew turned to look at his Dad for a brief moment, before returning to vigorously cleaning the kitchenware.<br />
<br />
“No, why?”<br />
“You don’t see anything new?”<br />
<br />
Matthew turned to look again, this time Martin was pointing at his head, and the short tuft of hair that lay on top. The boy’s eyes widened.<br />
<br />
“You’ve got hair!”<br />
“I know!”<br />
“But you don’t usually have hair!”<br />
“I know! That miracle cream thing works! Soon I’ll have a full head of hair! It might have some side effects too because…”<br />
<br />
Martin stood up to reveal his belly looking smaller than a week ago. He tightened his belt, looking at his apparent weight loss with delight. Just then, Harry emerged from the bathroom, quickly retreating back to his room. Martin took the opportunity.<br />
<br />
“Excuse me for a mo.”<br />
<br />
He left the kitchen, leaving his phone on the table. Matthew, as the loose yet soft fabric of the joggers rubbed gently against his crotch, was growing hornier but the second. His worked through the heap of dirty crockery as quickly as possible, until-<br />
<br />
PING!<br />
<br />
Martin’s phone received a message. Matthew didn’t pay any attention to it until-<br />
<br />
PING!PING!PING!PING!<br />
<br />
A swarm of messages. He turned to see the phone’s screen lit up, and leaned in closer to see who they were from.<br />
<br />
“Rachel?” He thought as he read through the messages:<br />
<br />
“UR SO HOT!”<br />
“FUCK ME!”<br />
“I WANT UR DICK!!”<br />
PING!<br />
<br />
Matthew’s eyes widened as he saw the latest message; a picture of a woman who appeared to be in her early 20s, lying completely naked on a bed, her mouth open and her tongue out. Matthew felt his cock instantly spring to life, tenting his joggers. <br />
<br />
“Holy shit!”<br />
<br />
Without any hesitation, he ran into his bedroom, barricading it from the other side. The sound of loud music boomed through his speakers. Martin returned from the bathroom to see the pots still unclean in the sink.<br />
<br />
“Hey!”<br />
<br />
He pounded on Matthew’s bedroom door, but the sound of knocking was easily drowned out by the music, along with the sound of deep moans and heavy breaths, which Martin dismissed as the vocals of the song. Having given up, he went to check on his phone, looking at his messages with his mouth open in shock. It was Rachel, but she looked so much younger! <br />
<br />
That was when Martin felt it; the first rush of hormones in a long while. Before the quarantine, his sex drive was close to no -existent, but he could feel his body grow warm with lust. He silently shuffled to his room, locking the door behind him. <br />
<br />
It wasn’t long until Harry came out of his room, grabbing a snack from the fridge. As he walked past his step-father’s door, he could hear loud grunts coming from the other side. Perturbed, he knocked.<br />
<br />
“Dad, are you alright?”<br />
<br />
The grunting immediately stopped, as Martin partially opened the door and leaned out, with his lower half hidden behind the door.<br />
<br />
“Everything’s alright, just stubbed my toe on the bed. Dinner will be ready in a little bit.”<br />
<br />
Martin feigned a smile as he closed his door. Harry almost jumped at the speed of which he closed it. Shrugging it off, the boy went back to his room, rolling his eyes at the music blasting from Matthew’s room.</p>
