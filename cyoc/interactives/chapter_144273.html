<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Patiently, Jacob sat as Emily removed the make-up using creams, wipes and other products on the vanity. When she&#39;d finished removing the eye shadow and mascara, he watched what she did, curious as she removed the lip gloss, the added colouring to his cheeks and nose, and lastly, after all the make-up had been cleared away, the earring in his ears, which pinched a bit when she tried to grab hold of the backings with only two fingers. Afterward, thinking he was done, Jacob was surprised when Emily said, &quot;Now we need to go to the bathroom to scrub your face.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Isn&#39;t my face clean already?&quot; Jacob asked as he stood and followed the other girl across the room.<br />
<br />
Emily, opening the door, explained, &quot;Yes, of most of the make-up. But now you need to scrub your face of oils, dirt and what make-up the creams couldn&#39;t remove. This will help so that your face, my face, whatever, doesn&#39;t break out and end up looking terrible,&quot; as she led him down the hallway to the bathroom.<br />
<br />
Inside, Jacob stood to one side as Emily searched the medicine cupboard and vanity cabinet. Setting a wash rag on the sink, she told him, &quot;Be right back,&quot; she left.<br />
<br />
Alone, Jacob idly crossed his hands over his chest and stared at his reflection. Blinking his emerald green eyes, thinking that Emily was pretty and wishing he had had the courage to ask her out, he sighed. Realising that once again he had to go to the bathroom, he turned toward the toilet, walked over to it and lifted the lid. Reaching up under the skirt he was wearing, he located the waist band of the tights and underwear and pushed them down around his ankle as he sat down. Hoping he could finish before Emily returned, he was disappointed when the other girl returned before he could finish.<br />
<br />
Embarressed, Jacob looked at Emily and stuttered, &quot;I didn&#39;t, I had to,&quot; and realising he was finished he stood and quickly pulled up the tights and underwear.<br />
<br />
A smiled crossed Emily&#39;s face and then she explained, &quot;We all have to pee. There&#39;s nothing wrong with that. And I have confidence you wouldn&#39;t do anything gross. But, you should probably know that you don&#39;t need to push the tights and panties all the way down and that girls wipe after they pee,&quot; and seeing the confused look on Jacob&#39;s face, she explained what she meant and why it was important.<br />
<br />
Jacob, the sense of crossing a boundary that shouldn&#39;t be crossed stealing back over him, watched as she set a couple containers on the sink and a garment that he thought might be a shirt. After she finished educating him on how girls peed, she reached under the sink and took out a box. Showing it to him, she said, &quot;Tomorrow, when you get dressed, I want you to use one of these. They are called panty liners.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But won&#39;t we be switching back tomorrow?&quot; Jacob asked hopefully.<br />
<br />
The smile never leaving, Emily replied, &quot;Not right away. We first have to find Kaitlyn and convince her to swap. We have no idea how long that is going to take. So, truthfully, until then, probably just for the day, I want you wearing a panty liner.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jacob, sure he was blushing, nodded. But, if he were, Emily didn&#39;t say anything and instead told him, &quot;I brought you something to wear for tonight. As I have had my period about two weeks ago, you should be okay. Plus, it&#39;s simple, so you&#39;ll feel comfortable,&quot; and handing him the garment she brought, Jacob unfolded it and saw that it was any sleeper shirt with a blue and orange owl on the front.<br />
<br />
Unsure if he was supposed to put it on now or wait, he glanced at Emily, who laughed and said, &quot;Well. Don&#39;t be shy. We&#39;re both girls. And it isn&#39;t like Kaitlyn and I haven&#39;t seen the other naked. Plus, you and I have seen each naked.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It was about eight years ago,&quot; Jacob immediately shot back.<br />
<br />
But, seeing the look on the other girl&#39;s face, which he thought made Kaitlyn look more mature, he sighed, set aside the nightshirt and fumbling, set about to take off the skirt he was wearing, with only the bra hooks causing him some issue. Afterward, fidgeting, as the night shirt only came down to his knees, he watched as Emily tossed the clothes he&#39;d been wearing into the hamper, then hung the tights over the shower door. Seeing that he was watching, she told him, &quot;Those will have be hand-washed,&quot; before beckoning him over to the sink, were she began to run the water.<br />
<br />
If he&#39;d thought having the make-up removed was a task in of itself, he was surprised how much went into washing his face. First, he rubbed something on it that Emily assured worked with the facial cleanser. After that, he applied a dollop of something to the wash cloth, ran it under the luke-warm water, then used to scrub his face. When he&#39;d finished, he began applying various creams that Emily told him would soften, moisturise, open up his pores and help his face from getting, as she put it, &quot;All icky.&quot;<br />
<br />
When he&#39;d finished that, he stood patiently as Emily examined his face, touched up an area here and there, then proclaimed, &quot;Good. Tomorrow morning I&#39;ll have to explain to you how to shower, as I take one every morning.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Um, okay,&quot; Jacob mumbled in response.<br />
<br />
Certain that his time he was blushing as an uncomfortable feeling settled over him, he looked down and shifted in place. Hearing the bathroom door open, he listened as Emily said, &quot;Good night.&quot;<br />
<br />
Telling her, &quot;Good night,&quot; he heaved a sigh, shut off the bathroom light and padded back to Emily&#39;s room.<br />
<br />
There, he shutting off the light, tiptoed to her bed, crawled in and after shifting about, trying to get comfortable, mostly because not only had the sleeper shirt had pushed up past his waist but also because it no longer felt comfortable lying flat on his back like he normally did, Jacob eventually settled for lying on his side. His legs almost drawn up to his body, giving him a semi-fetal position look, the comforter and sheets pulled up and tucked under his arms, he gazed out into the dark, thinking.<br />
<br />
He was certain that he would never get to sleep, as he always had trouble falling asleep in a strange places. Now, it wasn&#39;t just an unknown room, but he was reminded of what had happened as he could feel his breasts pressed against the shirt, the lack of his dick and nuts was obvious and he could feel Emily&#39;s ginger hair tickling the side of his face and ear every time he shifted. Wondering how long he was to be in Emily, he considered all the times before he would have loved to have seen the stuff he saw tonight, be in the position of Michael as her boyfriend or be aware of any number of the intimate and secret things he&#39;d been exposed to. Heaving a sigh, he thought that, now, he would give anything to be back in his own body, in his own room, alone with whatever random thoughts he normally had before falling asleep.<br />
<br />
After a bit, he noticed Emily&#39;s alarm clock. Reaching over, he checked that it was set, looked to see if there was any way to dim the digital readout any more, found it was already at its lowest, then set the thing back where he&#39;d gotten it. Turning over so that he was facing the wall, he snuggled deeper under the bedding, thinking as he did that Emily&#39;s bed was really comfortable. Shutting his eyes, he breathed deeply in, held it, then slowly exhaled. Repeating this, certain he would never get to sleep, Jacob soon drifted into a fitful R.E.M. sleep.<br />
<br />
Memories surfaced and he found himself confused by them. He was looking at himself, feeling as his hand placed over his own, listening as his voice explained, &quot;I think you need to hold the bat like this,&quot; then a female voice saying, &quot;Like this,&quot; and Jacob realised that he&#39;d was somehow the girl before things shifted and he was looking in a mirror. Holding his shirt up, he gingerly touched the raised area on the right side his chest, the nipple and surrounding area sensitive. Everything went weird and he heard his mom explaining to him what happens during puberty, only she was telling it wrong. Unable to reply, he started to float and after a moment he found himself lying on his bed, naked as the day he was born. Idly playing with his nipples, starting to feel aroused, he eventually slipped his hand down between his legs and, for the first time, played with the area down there, bringing himself to his first orgasm.<br />
<br />
Both ashamed and thrilled, but more so the latter, by what he&#39;d done, even more memories slipped by as the first time he masturbated at the age of fourteen left him. Finding himself recalling Hallowe&#39;en costumes, birthday parties, playing with a boy he was sure was actually him, visits to grandparents who looked both familiar and like complete strangers, he was soon overwhelmed by all the events that came and disappeared, often before he could figure out what they were. In the waking world, lying in Emily&#39;s bed, Jacob moaned and tossed and turned as he relived these memories. Something in his mind whispered that they weren&#39;t his but somebody else&#39;s, yet at a lost as to how to prove this, he drifted through the sea of the past.</p>
