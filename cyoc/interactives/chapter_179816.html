<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Despite continued soaking from his sister’s ass and crotch sweat, Jason remained underneath her as she squatted. He was becoming dizzy from the stench of rep after agonizing rep, until suddenly he realized he had stayed there for way to long. The sounds of fabric tearing along its seam reached his ears as Elizabeth’s yoga pants finally surrendered to her size and split along her underside. As her ass descended upon him for the umpteenth time he got an up close view of her ass crack, a pimple ridden valley of pungent odors caked with moisture, dried feces, and home to an anus that looked bigger than his head. Her next dip forced the tear further, freeing her rancid cameltoe and releasing a stench like a rotten fish monger’s. He saw with dismay that she apparently hadn’t shaved down there since she started growing hair. Her pussy and taint were absolutely matted with curly blonde pubes. Even though the ripping was fairly loud, Elizabeth didn’t notice at all!<br />
<br />
“How am I doing down there, coach?” she asked energetically between squats, “Is my form good?” Her titanic ass engulfed his entire field of vision, and with dismay he felt her snapped, stank stained panties fall onto his chest. With every dip her asshole yawned, and he wouldn’t be surprised if he could actually see the radiant heat its smells gave off. Jason could only let out a strangled squeak in response.<br />
<br />
“What was that, bro?” Liz asked again, “I didn’t quite catch that.”<br />
<br />
“Pants... gone...” Jason gasped without opening his mouth too much, but even that was enough for plenty of tainted air to slide into his lungs. It felt viscous and thick in his throat, and he could practically taste the rotten eggs and saltpeter. Every instinct was telling him to move, but he was held in place by his intense nausea.<br />
<br />
“Pants... gone?” Elizabeth questioned as she felt up her huge backside. Jason watched her hand spread her right cheek wide as he got a better view of her anus than he ever would have wanted for all eternity. “Oh shit, you’re right! Jeez, how did I not notice again? Hearing them rip is half the fun.” Wait, she <i>wanted</i> to rip her pants?! “Lost another pair of underwear too, I bet. Ah well, I’m still halfway through my squats... What do you think, Jason? Should I change real quick first?”<br />
<br />
“No... more...” Jason wheezed, his face as pale as death.<br />
<br />
“More?” his sister misheard, “Man, you’re gonna work my fat ass to death, bro! Is this a veiled attempt to keep staring at this beautiful thing?” She smacked her massive cheeks together, making more sweat drizzle over her brother and causing a ripple to surge through the jiggling fat that lasted for a good few seconds. “Hey, no shame here, man! Let’s keep this going! Keep your eyes on my ass, Jason!” As if there were anything else he could do. His body refused to move due to shock.<br />
<br />
Elizabeth’s bare crack bounced in rhythm overhead as she resumed her squatting exercises, joined by her grunts of exertion and a rumbling in her gut that didn’t bode well. As she came down for another squat, her asshole opened wider than he’d ever seen it before, and then the true torment began.<br />
<br />
FFRRRRRRRRRPPPPPPPPTTTTTTTTTTTTT<br />
<br />
A powerful, hot wind blasted Jason in the face as she squatted, becoming worse the farther she dips. It stoped as suddenly as it started when she started going back up, but as she descended again more gas got pushed out.<br />
<br />
FFRRRRRRRRRPPPPPPPPTTTTTTTTTTTTT<br />
<br />
Jason felt tears gush from his eyes as over and over her hot, rancid farts forced their way into his lungs. His entire respiratory system burned from the stink, but it was all there was to breathe within a 10&#39; radius. He was trapped by his body&#39;s refusal to move, being farted on in plain view of everyone in the park by his bottomless sister. The rest of her pants had since torn themselves to shreds around her gigantic legs, leaving only the struggling elastic waistband and a few tatters around her ankles, completely exposing her fat, pale thighs as well as her private regions.<br />
<br />
Just when he felt like he was due to pass out from the stench, Jason noticed that Liz&#39;s farts suddenly seemed stifled. They came out in short little (for her) poots instead of rippling bursts; it seemed like she&#39;d finally run out of pent up gas, until with abject horror as her sphincter stretched once more he realized he was dead wrong. As her body lowered down it began to force a log of thick, brown, clay-like shit thicker than his leg from the rancid hole. His skin crawled as it began coiling on his face and torso; by the time she pinched it off it felt like it weighed at least 10 pounds. At the same time his chest and lower body was being soaked with gallons of dark yellow piss, adding to his horrific situation. Plus, through it all, his dick was starting to throb from how hard his confused chub was, and it <br />
hurt like FUCK!<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh man, now I see why you had me do more,&quot; Liz panted, &quot;I can already feel the pounds dropping! I am gonna have the strongest legs in town, no doubt about it!&quot; Like a Play-Doh toy, every time Liz bent her waist to squat a little bit, more of her shit got squeezed out until her sphincter cut it off on the rise, dropping more and more heavy turds on Jason’s face until he couldn&#39;t even get up if you wanted to. He was literally pinned down by her crap! He felt like he was going to suffocate!<br />
<br />
By the time she finished her hundredth squat and subconsciously emptied both her rectum and her bladder, she’d dropped more than 50 pounds of crap on her brother’s face and the piss had soaked into his socks. How he was still breathing was beyond him at this point, but he would really like to stop.<br />
<br />
“Phew, finally done!” Liz sighed as she wiped the sweat from her brow, “How was that, Jason? ...Jason?” She stepped away to look for him and found the boy half buried in her shit. “Oh jeez, there you are! Sorry about that, I didn’t know that you were sinking into mud. Here, let’s get you up, dude.” She reached into the crap she thought was mud and pulled him out like it wasn’t even there. Jason hacked and spluttered as he felt movement return to his limbs, finally breathing in the comparatively fresh air.<br />
<br />
“Hey, you smell great all of a sudden,” Elizabeth exclaimed, “kinda like shit and piss, now I think about it... how’d that happen?”<br />
<br />
“That... is no mud,” Jason gasped as he wiped the feces out of his eyes, “You... you went to the bathroom on me...”<br />
<br />
“Oh,” Elizabeth giggled, “That makes... OH CHRIST!” She suddenly registered what he said. “That’s my ass mud you’re covered in?! Ooh fuck, I’m so sorry! You know about my loose bowel syndrome! Why didn’t you say anything before?”<br />
<br />
Jason was about to retort when suddenly...</p>
