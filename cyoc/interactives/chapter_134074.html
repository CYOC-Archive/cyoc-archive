<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After my mother finished washing me she dumped one more bucket of water over to rinse me off before lifting me out of the tub and draining the water. “Okay Jackie stand still so mommy can dry you off” she said grabbing a nearby towel and covering my head before proceeding to pat down the rest of my body.<br />
<br />
“There we go, and now to get you some new underwear” my mother said reaching under the sink and pulled out a diaper and pull-up, holding them both in front of me.<br />
<br />
“Now which one do you want to wear?” she offered with a smile.<br />
 <br />
“Diaper” I said immediately without even thinking about it.<br />
<br />
It was blatantly oblivious my parents were attempting to get me to potty train. However I really didn’t want to, I had just gotten back into diapers and I wasn’t about to give them up this second time around without a fight.<br />
<br />
“Are you sure Jackie? Don’t you want to wear the pull-up like a big boy?” she tried to convince me and I shook my head no. My mother let out a sigh before laying out the blanket on the floor and putting the pull-up away. “Oh well I guess you’re still my little baby boy it seems” I grinned at that, “Lay down so mommy can diaper you.” Not needing to be told twice I eagerly did as I was told and laid down, once again sticking my legs up in the air. I smiled as she lifted me up and slid it under me, setting my rear down on the soft padding. Since I just had a bath she didn’t need to wipe me and instead sprinkled a small amount of baby powder over my crotch and bottom, then pulled the front up between my legs and taping up the sides. It surprised me how much I loved the feeling of wearing one again, the way it spread my legs with it thickness and crinkled whenever I moved.<br />
<br />
Standing me back up my mother then led me out of the bathroom by my hand, “Alright Jackie you got two hours of TV time then its straight to bed.”<br />
<br />
“Okay mommy” I replied as we entered the living room.<br />
<br />
Pulling away from her I toddled over to and climbed up onto the couch as she turned on the TV, switching the channel to one that was playing some old looney tune cartoons. Sitting down on my padded rear end I immediately became engrossed in the show, not even paying attention to her leaving until she returned a minute with a sippy cup full of grape juice that she handed to me. Holding it with both hands I guzzled down the flavored liquid while watching the crazy antics of Bugs Bunny and Elmer Fudd. After finishing my juice in a matter of minutes I tossed the empty cup aside and laid back against the couch.<br />
<br />
An hour and a half passed when I felt a pressure in my tiny bladder. Without a second thought I gave into the urge that followed and let go as a steady stream of pee flowed into my diaper, enjoying the warmness that spread throughout the front and a bit to the back. I liked how my padding became puffy as it absorbed my accident, none of it leaking out and every drop being contained. When I finished peeing I grinned and sucked my thumb a little, thinking of myself as more of a toddler than a teenager. I was already starting to see the perks of my new age far outweighed those of my old age, I had my every need taken care of and didn’t have to worry about homework or school. But the best part was being able to go in diapers again, I could use the bathroom whenever I wanted now. I spent the remaining half hour watching TV in my soaked underwear, enjoying the squishy feeling of the padding.<br />
<br />
“Jackie, time for bed!” my mother called out as she entered the room.<br />
<br />
Turning my head to look at her I got off the couch, my padding sagging between my legs as I toddled over to her.<br />
<br />
“Uh oh seems like somebody used their diaper again instead of the potty” she told me seeing the yellow stained front.<br />
<br />
“Uh huh. I made peepee” I answered proudly, not even looking the least bit ashamed.<br />
<br />
“I guess maybe you’re not quite ready for potty training after all” my mother admitted shaking her head with a slight smile as she turned off the TV with the remote, “Come on let’s go to your room and get you changed.”<br />
<br />
Hearing that I eagerly followed her down the hall, awkwardly waddling due to the wetness between my legs. Once we were in my room she placed a plastic matt on top of my race car bed then laid me down on top of it. Untaping and balling up the used garment I watched her toss it into the pail with the others. My mother then proceeded to clean my crotch with the baby wipes, going over my genitals many times in the process which felt a little weird but also kinda good. Once she finished she placed a new diaper under my rear, powdering and then taping me up in a flash. Sitting up I smiled at the feeling at feeling of a fresh pair of padding on my bottom, wriggling my butt and listening to it crinkle.<br />
<br />
“Now that you’re clean and dry we can put on your pajamas now” she said opening my dresser and pulling out a blue shirt and pants, both decorated with colorful dinosaur designs. Growing excited at the sight of them I allowed my mom to put them on me without a fuss. Lifting my arms she expertly pulled the shirt over my head and gently pushing me onto my back my legs went into the pants with her tugging them up and over my puffy underwear.<br />
<br />
After dressing me in my comfy pj’s my mom abruptly left the room leaving me sitting there confused on the bed until she returned carrying a certain object from the bathroom.<br />
<br />
“And Jackie the potty will be right here in case you feel the need during the night. Just remember to pull down your diaper before you go” she reminded me putting the plastic potty chair in the corner. But I just ignored it, not planning to use the thing when I had something much better taped around my waist to go in. Knowing what I was supposed to do now I crawled under the covers, my mother walking over and leaning down to give a quick kiss on the forehead. Turning on the nightlight she whispered goodnight to me before leaving, closing the door so it was open just a crack.<br />
<br />
Just as I was about to fall asleep I felt that familiar pressure in my butt that told me I needed to poop. Staying right where I was I raised my legs and began to push, completely giving into the urge as I was determined to soil myself again. This one was bigger than the last one I made so I ended up grunting as I pooped out a fairly big turd along with letting out a fart, the log curling in on itself as it hit the inside of the padding.<br />
<br />
That satisfied feeling from before returned, there was just something about filling my pants with poo that felt so good. <br />
<br />
Several seconds later I was done making poopie and the back had a large bulge in it. I just lay there in my bed for a few minutes and enjoyed the sensation of my full diaper and the warmness of my mess on my butt. Eventually the built-in odor guards started to fail and a foul smell began to leak out of my padding, the covers held back the blunt force of it but it still managed to escape and began to slowly stink up the room.<br />
<br />
Lying there in my very dirty diaper I silently pondered what to do next.</p>
