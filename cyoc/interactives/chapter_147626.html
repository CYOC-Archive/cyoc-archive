<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">everyone near and far from across the lands of the enchanting beast of all kinds, to the lords and ladies from the sky, the land, and of the sea of neighboring kingdoms were dancing and setting the gifts on a table in the grand hall as they ate their fill on princess Aurora&#39;s coronation that while the toad king with his beautiful swan queen, sir John braveheart with Ciela, the jaguar, the human sized red dragon, and more of the grope were shortly making suggestions on what to do before sundown within a secret meeting is when the red dragon soon made a suggestion about her leaving the kingdom for now and train with him to become a knight. he also mention on taking in a new name by the use of Amber for a cover name to protect her against the forces of evil for the time being, until this knight dragon from another world comes to help break her curse she&#39;s now under as they were soon agreeing to this idea that this is where princess Aurora secretly rush up to her room to get the stress out about the curse while wishing her true parents were here to help her. as she was in tear and crying that she remembered earlier about the two demon dogs for they somehow had their eyes, while she was thinking deep down in herself for maybe they were really them after all.<br />
<br />
Aurora&#39;s coronation was going smoothly as things went back to the way things were like before, like it was normal. yet they now had a hint of fear for the princess as they now know what she&#39;ll be for when the sun goes down. by sunset that she&#39;ll be in a form of a dragon, yet they were lucky for it was still noon for the coronation went on while they were secretly talking to themselves about helping her out and watching her back as much they can.<br />
<br />
meanwhile, finishing up with the secret meeting that sir John breaveheart made an announcement about the princess as he stood up from the table. &quot;alright, we got to tell her whats going to happen and why. for this reason, one of us should be the one to do so that I got to know now. any volunteers as to who will be the one to tell her?&quot;<br />
<br />
when he said this that most of them back off on who should tell her for it seemed like a lost cause, all except for the red dragon. he was the only one willing to tell her the truth on what was going to happen to the young princess, with the help of both Ciela and breaveheart. leaving to head for Aurora&#39;s room by the help of asking the guest of her coronation, even the mage as to where she went off to in secret that they soon knocked on her door while remotely hearing her cry on the other side of the room.<br />
<br />
still crying in her bed that when she heard a knock on her door, she sniffed a bit as she slowly got herself up from her bed with tears and headed to the door and see who it was. she opened up the door to see both John and Ciela for this made her feel a bit happy to have such good step parents to look after her that she wasn&#39;t sure who this dragon was when she saw him, nor why he was with them. slowly entering the room as they closed the door behind them, she realized that they weren&#39;t here for pleasantries as they shortly after told her why.<br />
<br />
&quot;hey guys, glade you could... wait, who&#39;s this? is there something going on?&quot; she asked that the red dragon soon spook in terms of what will happen in the future and holds for her.<br />
<br />
&quot;my princess. you may not know me, but your father who was once king here once saved my lord of my kind in more ways then one for his name is Igneel. still, with an alliance between the two of them on neighboring lands and our kinds that with your parents and the others on the meeting we just had is where we came up with a solution in the mean time for your curse. in other words my dear, until the curse is lifted off of you to reclaim your kingdom back that you&#39;ll have to leave here and return with me back to the dragon kingdom, as our dragon knight.&quot; the red dragon said as the princess could not believe what she was hearing, but where else was she going to go when she gets turned into a mythical dragoness.<br />
<br />
&quot;please under stand my dear, it&#39;s for your own good to stay hidden against the forces of evil. we also came up with a cover code name for you, Amber.&quot; sir John braveheart said as he was taking a knee down in front of her that he was acting like he was her knight once again.<br />
<br />
talking to her while comforting her as to what was going to happen to her from there that it seemed the best move they ever made. it wasn&#39;t long when the court mage entered the room they were in, say it was impotent that leaving the room she was in is where they meet up with what looked like an old man wearing a grey, blue robe with a pointed hat while holding a bent up staff. true he was on the list of guest that he was the wise man, Merlin for with him was an owl (guest you know who this is by now).<br />
<br />
with the formal greetings out of the way as he came far and wide to get here that they both tapped each others staffs and discuss about magic stuff while catching up on things, but that&#39;s not why he&#39;s here. still though, the girl next to him had bright pink hair as she wore glasses and was wearing a similar robe, but called herself Melida Bowen that she is mostly skilled on enchanting crafts and artifacts. with things as they are now that they soon told them why they were here in their beloved kingdom.</p>
