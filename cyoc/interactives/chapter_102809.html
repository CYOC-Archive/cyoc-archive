<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;As great as that sounds, dear,&quot; Marci&#39;s voice spoke over the phone, &quot;THAT will have to wait. I have a good job as an attorney here and you have your work with the bureau. If you wish to retire to Moon Lake... that&#39;d be fine. But we have jobs that are doing well and important.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The bureau does have offices in Seattle,&quot; Theodore told her, &quot;It might be a bit of a step down for me... but I&#39;d still be able to commute to the offices there, and above all YOU would be safe to be YOU.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They&#39;d let you transfer?&quot; Marci wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;They could,&quot; Theodore commented, &quot;I&#39;d have give a pretty good explanation as to why I&#39;d want a transfer from the unit in Washington DC to Seattle... I can probably manage it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Still... I can&#39;t just close my practice and leave right now,&quot; Marci told him, &quot;I have a few BIG cases coming up. If you&#39;d to move there... that&#39;d be fine, but let&#39;s take it slow. Besides, you got your bad guy to track down still.&quot;<br />
<br />
Theodore nodded. He did have work still to do, which if he could get things done correctly would have him leaving Moon Lake with more information on Lionel Ulysses, and maybe even enough to get a plan together to catch him and bring Jeff Decker&#39;s murderer to justice. He owed the Decker family that much, and so long as the Ulysses was on the loose, he wouldn&#39;t be able to get a transfer to the Seattle office anyway. He set out to start his part to see what background information he could get on his suspect, and figured to be quiet on the were issue. He didn&#39;t know if Ulysses was one and he didn&#39;t know for certain as to how much his presence would spread through the town while he was here. He didn&#39;t want to raise a stir.<br />
<br />
And if Marci didn&#39;t want to close her practice for the moment, he would give her the opportunity to make her own choices.<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
Watching from a window, the Moon Lake Police Michael O&#39;Hara only watched. On some level he was taking a bit of a gamble, but much of the way Theodore Green had talked to him on some subjects sounded too much like coded language designed to protect something. The only logical conclusion was that Theodore Green was protecting the werecat that Chief O&#39;Hara could smell on the agent. It wasn&#39;t much, and likely only the result of being close to one, but enough to assume that the agent was protecting her. Which could mean that in his personal life Agent Green might be looking for help in that regard, and he figured it was better to let him know now where he had an opportunity to handle things properly that wouldn&#39;t involve either his forced change, his death, or the accidental exposure of were-beasts. He made a mental not to let Samantha Twist know that it seemed as though their FBI guest was an ally and might even be willing to be changed, and things could go further from there.<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
While Agent Theodore Green had gone through the necessary precautions with Moon Lake PD and the Seattle FBI field office to get the information needed to hopefully catch Lionel Ulysses, Tad Decker had awoken to another new day in a new home town. He and Jen had ultimately stayed with Jeff&#39;s parents through much of the previous day and even had dinner there. It was good and Tad enjoyed it greatly, as it allowed him to put faces to the cards and occasional phone calls that he&#39;d gotten from his father&#39;s parents over the years. The only thing came as a negative from the lengthy visit was that his mother&#39;s plan for him to met her mothers as well couldn&#39;t be met, but it was mentioned that that wasn&#39;t too much of a problem.<br />
<br />
After getting dressed and making his way downstairs, he heard his mom on the phone with someone. He wondered who it was, though the conversation seemed rather friendly.<br />
<br />
&quot;No... he just got up,&quot; Jen spoke, &quot;we&#39;ll be by after we&#39;ve had breakfast.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tad thought he heard something along the lines of &quot;we&#39;d gladly make breakfast for both of you.&quot; The voice was a woman&#39;s voice and sounded a little bit like Jen&#39;s voice but not exactly. This only lead to some further puzzlement on Tad&#39;s part, though after a moment he figured maybe Jen was talking to her own parents.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, we&#39;ll be fine and I don&#39;t want to impose on you,&quot; Jen spoke, &quot;We&#39;ll see you soon. Bye.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Who was that, mom?&quot; Tad asked as he poured himself a bowl of cereal and joining his mother at the kitchen table.<br />
<br />
&quot;That would be my mother,&quot; Jen spoke, &quot;one of your three grandmothers. You met Jeff&#39;s parents yesterday, and with today being Saturday, I figured I could let you meet my parents. They haven&#39;t seen you in just as long a time as Jeff&#39;s parents.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So we&#39;re going there after breakfast?&quot; Tad surmised while he began to eat his cereal.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Jen nodded, &quot;as we put things together and settle into the town where you&#39;ll be safe.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tad nodded and at his cereal. He knew his mom&#39;s parents were werecats, as Jen was a werecat and Jen had said she was born a werecat. Based on Christmas and birthday gifts, he knew their names were Vivian and Karen Teller, but he had never remembered meeting them.<br />
<br />
&quot;And they will just love to see you,&quot; Jen said with a smile to Tad.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay then,&quot; Tad said slowly.<br />
<br />
He also wondered a bit over what his mother&#39;s parents looked like. Jen had told him that they were werecats and didn&#39;t look that much older than Jen did, thanks to a were&#39;s slow rate of aging, but that was a pretty basic statement. Tad had only known Vivian and Karen as &quot;grandma&quot; through the mail. He obviously knew that two women couldn&#39;t biologically have a child together and that either Vivian or Karen had gotten a male were to play the role of a surrogate father in order to conceive Jen, through a donation and artificial insemination, but Jen had never fully told him which of his grandmas was Jen&#39;s biological mother. That made him wonder who Jen took after, Vivian or Karen. In that, Tad realized that he had some eagerness to meet  his grandmas as well. He&#39;d finally get to satisfy his curiosity and put faces to the names he&#39;d seen on birthday and Christmas presents.</p>
