<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Thanks to everyone who keeps adding to this, those contributions keep bringing me back</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">	Joanna’s long, slow process of standing up continued on while the rest of the group mercifully turned their attention away, wrapped up in their own conversation. She wobbled her way to her feet, doing her best not to repeat her fall from earlier where she slipped onto her breasts. Chad seeing her lose any milk from her tits would no doubt be bad for her. <br />
<br />
	“At least your attention whore of a daughter is making me rich,” Chad remarked while Joanna slipped back and fell on her ass again, involuntarily crying out his name. “Joanna’s World must be raking it in if my cut each month is so huge.”<br />
<br />
	“Well, you’re a huge part of the site, Chad,” Jennifer assured him as Joanna’s weak arms shakily tried to lift herself again. “I have to admit I feel a little guilty about all the money I’ve made from it, since I’m not really involved at all. But you know, Mom said she would only arrange to set up the site if Joanna would sign over every cent of her own cut of the profits to me.”<br />
<br />
	“Yes,” her Mom continued while Joanna got to her hands and knees, red-faced and panting, “My hope was that condition would keep her from wanting to build a whole social media site just to debase herself on, but she was single minded. She’s wearing this outfit on camera right now because she wants to, not for any sort of profit motive.”<br />
<br />
	With one final heaving motion, Joanna lifted herself back onto her feet, her back to the rest of the group. She wondered how successful she’d be at avoiding falling over for the rest of the night.<br />
<br />
	“I think it’s part of why the site is so successful,” her mom continued, ignoring her daughter. “With any other pornography you always wonder in the back of your mind if they’re just in it for the money. But with Joanna, you know she loves every second of it.”<br />
<br />
	Joanna turned to face them, but they were already walking away into the dining room. She licked her lips with a quick wink to the camera against her will, and then rushed after them. They’d notice immediately if she left them, and that would only mean trouble. She had to try and get through the rest of the evening and then see if she could find a way to access the Chronivac tonight.<br />
<br />
	When she got to the dining room, she found that the rest of the group was already seated around the table, and looked up at her expectantly.<br />
<br />
	“Finally joining us, Joanna?” Her Mother mocked her. “Well, the rest of us are starting to get hungry, so you should get started on dinner.”<br />
<br />
	“I should make dinner?” Joanna asked, confused. “I don’t know how to cook.” She licked her lips as they plumped up ever so slightly.<br />
<br />
	“Just because you’re bad at it doesn’t mean you don’t know how,” her Mom replied, and tapped her phone as it was sitting on the table. “Now get to work.”<br />
<br />
	Suddenly, Joanna’s mind was filled with an encyclopedic knowledge of food and cooking. She had new memories of being so excited on seeing her maid outfit that she immediately jumped into the role and spent hours reading about cooking and cleaning. <br />
<br />
	“Fine,” she said, clearly annoyed at her newest change, “I guess I’ll get started.”<br />
<br />
	“I picked up all the ingredients for a mushroom risotto today,” her mother reminded her.<br />
<br />
	“And Joanna, if you don’t mind, ending the meal with a cheesecake would be delightful,” her sister added.<br />
<br />
	Instead of responding, Joanna licked her lips and went through the doorway into the kitchen. She sighed, knowing she should get right to work, as a risotto and cheesecake would take a while to make. <br />
<br />
She began to get out pots and pans and all the ingredients she would need, straining to lift each. She organized her ingredients, started cutting vegetables, and measuring sugar and broth. The whole process proceeded slowly and jerkily as she struggled to move around the kitchen smoothly or lift things. She noticed a camera in the corner of the ceiling, and she guessed that everything was being streamed to her site (no, her Mom’s site, she reminded herself). She couldn’t help herself from periodically licking her lips sensually into the camera, and at one point her dildo slipped forward between her legs so she bent her ass towards the camera and adjusted it while giving her audience a full view. She would have to remember to add removing this new exhibition impulse to her list of changes she wanted to make.<br />
<br />
She was only about ten minutes into making the meal while she was cooking some onions, when she accidentally whacked herself in the nipple with her hand that was stirring. She winced in pain and pleasure, and shifted back away from the pan as best she could with her breasts sticking out as far as they were. But only a moment later, she winced as it happened again. <br />
<br />
Soon things started to go wrong all over the place. It seemed like she was constantly accidentally banging things into her enormous nipples, every time she moved an ingredient she would spill some into her cleavage, and she would drop things only to angle her ass towards the camera and moan suggestively as she reached down to grab them. It was like the meal she was making was harassing her for the entertainment of her audience.<br />
<br />
She heard talking in the dining room, with occasional bouts of laughter, and hoped that finally they were distracted from her.<br />
<br />
Her expert cooking knowledge saved her, though, and despite the mounting indignities she suffered she barely lost any time, all things finishing perfectly when she predicted them. Soon the cheesecake was on its way and the risotto was done, and she moved to take a tray of three plates to serve the table.<br />
<br />
The doorway between the kitchen and the dining room, though, was narrower than she remembered. Her breasts went first, and barely squeezed through, the doorway pushing them together and reminding her of just how full they were. After her tits, her butt and hips were next, and she had to actually pull herself forward, the frame squeezing her fat cheeks together until she popped free and stumbled into the room.<br />
<br />
“Oh, perfect timing Joanna, come here,” Chad demanded as she set their food down in front of them. A wave of horniness washed over her again as he commanded her, and she felt powerlessly drawn to him.<br />
<br />
“See, I let a lot of guys do whatever they want to her nips. But a lot of them don’t get it, they squeeze like this.” He reached over and roughly grabbed both of her nipples, twisting them harshly.<br />
<br />
“Chad!” She cried out his name, meaning to sound offended about the sudden assault on her breasts, but it came out much more like a longing moan. <br />
<br />
“See, the problem with that is that it lets some of her milk out,” he explained, pointing at the liquid leaking down her exposed tits. “It barely matters if it happens once, but when it happens all day, she starts to get some relief. It’s better if people grab them like this.” Joanna hadn’t even recovered from the first time he’d grabbed her, and she moaned his name again as he did so in some subtly different way. The difference in technique he was describing was lost on her, but she could certainly feel the difference. While before the release of even a small amount of milk had been nice, twisting them in this other way increased the pressure she felt by the slightest bit.<br />
<br />
“I&#39;ve had a lot of practice with this since she signed those udders over to me, and I don’t know why but when you do it this way,” he grabbed them a third time and she felt the pressure increase the tiniest bit more as she slumped onto the table, her ass jutting out proudly behind her as she moaned Chad’s name again, “you not only avoid losing any milk, but you stimulate her boobs to make even more.” Chad turned, and Joanna noticed a camera angled perfectly for a closeup of her slumped over face, and she licked her lips in frustration.<br />
<br />
“Everyone out there knows I own these fat teats,” he said, slapping her breasts and sending them jiggling, “But I’ll give blanket permission to anyone who sees her to play with them as much as you’d like, as long as you make sure to tweak her nipples like this.” Chad gave one last long twist, and Joanna came on the spot as her tits filled up even more, pushing her over the edge. “Chad!” She cried in a long, drawn out orgasm.<br />
<br />
Something about coming over and over on camera as a woman was so... emasculating? She hated that her new life put her femininity on display for everyone. But of course, that didn&#39;t make sense, she&#39;d always been a girl. Where was that feeling coming from? Her mom messing with her head again?<br />
<br />
It was a long time before Joanna could push herself off the table, and she looked to where her sister suppressed a laugh and her mother gave her a pitying smile. She turned, her skirt swishing to draw attention to her giant ass as she wobbled back to the kitchen.<br />
<br />
“Joanna, isn’t there something you’re forgetting?” Her mother called to her.<br />
<br />
She stopped on the spot, somehow knowing immediately what her mother wanted from her. She swished her cumbersome body around, her short body in her heels still barely taller than Chad while he was sitting. <br />
<br />
Then, hating the action with every bit of herself, she curtsied for him, looking ridiculous in her practically nonexistent petticoat.<br />
<br />
“Thank you very, very much Chad!” She said through her gritted teeth before turning around and moving back to the kitchen.</p>
