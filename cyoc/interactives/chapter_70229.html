<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">He was moving through the hallways, passing various students he knew from school, looking for somebody. Everything around him shifted and he was sitting on the bleachers outside the football field. Next to him he knew was the girl he sat next to in a couple classes. She reached over and began to rub his breasts and at first he thought, &quot;That's not right,&quot; but than she slid her hand down across his abdomen and as he felt his nipples growing hard and a warm sensation spreading in his groin, she placed her hand inside his pants and between his legs.<br />
<br />
Connor gasped and thought, &quot;That's definitely not right,&quot; as everything once again shifted and he found himself lying on his back.<br />
<br />
Grunting with discomfort, he felt press into the area between his legs and than push inward. Glancing up, he saw not the girl he sat next to in class but a boy that was a couple seats over and wanting to scream in alarm, Connor instead found himself moaning with pleasure as the boy continued to thrust his hard penis into Connor's vagina.<br />
<br />
Another shift and just as Connor wanted to scream out no, he suddenly he found himself sitting in class. Turning in his seat, he saw the girl, only she wasn't as pretty as Connor had originally thought. But at the same time, she was pretty in the clothes she wore and the way she had her hair styled, just not pretty in the way someone looking for a date would look at someone. &quot;Not like Jeremy,&quot; Connor thought as his eyes flicked over to a really cute guy a couple seats over. &quot;He's dreamy,&quot; Connor sighed.<br />
<br />
Glancing back at the girl, thinking something was wrong, unable to understand why he thought guys were suddenly &quot;dreamy&quot; Connor watched as the girl stood and walked over to him, taking up his whole view. Glancing up, thinking that she was awfully tall, Connor watched as she bent down and realising that she was holding a loofah sponge, he tried to ask, &quot;What are you doing?&quot; but found no sound coming out.<br />
<br />
As he realised this, and came to understand that when he had spoken earlier the results had been the same, Connor watched as the sponge passed before him and still staring at the girl, he felt the loofah slowly being rubbed, first against his torso, and than down until it was between his legs.<br />
<br />
Gasping with surprise as the sponge the area between his legs, Connor looked down and nearly screamed when he saw the flat, smooth skin and looking up at the girl, realising that he was naked, Connor tried to tell her that he wasn't a girl, but was pretty sure something else came out. And than the girl that was washing him was pulling a towel around Connor and realising that at some point he'd stood up, Connor glanced about, seeing vague images that he thought must be a bathroom as the girl towel-dried his hair.<br />
<br />
And than she kneeling before Connor, button up the front of a soft, white-cotton nightgown and as Connor wanted to tell her that he wasn't a girl...<br />
<br />
He sat up, looking wildly about, the dream fading from his mind as he did so. Before him he saw what at first he thought was his normal room, but than he thought that it looked much too feminine. Pushing back the sheet, he was just about slid out of bed when he realised that he was wearing the same nightgown he'd been wearing in his dream.<br />
<br />
Unsure, touching each of the buttons on the front and small, pink ribbon at the very top, he thought, &quot;What the hell,&quot; Connor started to slid out of bed, but stopped when he felt something push painfully and the wrong way against the bed and thinking, &quot;It's just my tail,&quot; he slid out of bed and than stopped as he realised what it was he had just thought. Hiking up the nightgown, Connor tried to peer around at his backside, but when he found the garment getting in the way, he let it drop and decided he would deal with it in a moment.<br />
<br />
Idly playing one of the buttons on the nightgown, Connor wondered if somehow his dream, which he was starting to think might have been a nightmare, had come true, but was unable to fully recall what the dream had been about. Staring at his room, taking in the white walls with pinkish-white trim up near the ceiling, the brightly coloured sheets and comforter on his bed, the dresser that matched the vanity and full-body mirror, and the deep, white, shag-carpet, Connor muttered, &quot;This is a girl's room,&quot; and after a moment thought, &quot;A young girl's room,&quot; and approaching the mirror, he nearly screamed in surprise at what he saw.<br />
<br />
Peering back at his was a girl, no older than nine, but no younger than seven, Connor figured. Her hair fell down past her shoulders and was auburn in colour. And sticking out her hair was a pair of ears that came to a point and when Connor reached up and pushed them flat, he saw and felt that they were covered in a soft, short, white fur.<br />
<br />
Disturbed by this fact, Connor let go of the ears and turning his attention to other things, he noted that her eyes appeared to be a brownish-shade of black. Stepping back, he figured her height was about four foot and taking a deep breath, Connor slowly began unbuttoning the nightgown, dreading what he would see, but knowing what he would see as he was coming to terms with the fact that who he was seeing in the mirror was not another person, but him. And than the last button was undone and once again Connor felt like screaming because of what he saw.<br />
<br />
Glancing down, he wanted to scream, but fearing that it would draw unwanted attention, he instead glanced back up at the mirror. From the top of his head down to about his groin region everything appeared normal for a girl. But than, marring this was clearly a very small penis and an even smaller set of testicles.<br />
<br />
&quot;I've got,&quot; Connor gasped out, unable to find words to describe what he was seeing and after a moment, as he wondered why he wasn't wearing any underwear, he sputtered out, &quot;A new-born's penis.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gingerly touching his genitals, realising that they were almost between his legs and that there was no way he could actually pee standing up and at the same time that he didn't pee standing up, Connor glanced back at his image and taking in that everything below his penis and testicles appeared normal, he shrugged off the nightgown. Throwing it onto his bed, he turned and gazed at his backside, taking in the clear fact that he had a tail jutting out from his tailbone.<br />
<br />
Thinking, &quot;I'm part dog?&quot; Connor ran a hand over the soft, white fur and than realised something.<br />
<br />
It was only a flash, but suddenly he remembered that since he had been about one or two, he'd always wanted to be a girl. And his mother had given in eventually. About the same time his father had left, stating he shan't be living in the same house as two females and a sissy.<br />
<br />
&quot;And than I was started on an experimental drug,&quot; Connor thought as he turned about.<br />
<br />
Touching the ears, feeling his tail wag back and forth, Connor knew immediately that the reason he had a tail and ears was because of something in the drug. It made him appear female and, according to his mother, when he started phase two, it would make him one hundred percent female as it would cause his genitals to slowly reform into that which was more appropriate for a girl, as well as finishing his developing internal reproductive organs and a couple more areas. The one side effect that the company hadn't been able to see was that because they used a small portion of natural bitch hormones it caused the user to slowly morph into a bitch.<br />
<br />
&quot;At least,&quot; Connor thought. &quot;Until they caught the defect and all I've wound up with was a set of dog ears and tail, nothing else canine.&quot;<br />
<br />
Shaking his head, he thought, &quot;This is not possible,&quot; as he thought about the drug, the two phases to it and how it was slowly turning him into a girl, had given him dog ears and tail, caused his father to leave and how, he was sure, it was all because of some dream he'd had. Hugging himself, Connor turned away from the mirror and wondered what other surprise awaited him and after a moment, headed for the dresser, figuring he might as well get dressed.<br />
***<br />
<br />
Wearing a pair of loose pair of shorts, a pair of loose, white cotton girl's underwear that had brightly-coloured butterflies on it, understanding that they had to be loose in order for him to comfortably tuck his tail between his legs, that his penis and testicles didn't need to be tucked back because of where they were sitting and how small they were, Connor looked down at the white t-shirt he was wearing, which also had brightly coloured butterflies on it and wondered, not for the first time, why everything had to be so brightly coloured, but also finding himself thinking that it was cute.<br />
<br />
Padding softly into the dining room, Connor wasn't wearing any socks, he found his mother already up and as she told him, &quot;Morning sweetheart,&quot; he pulled out one of the chairs and sat down.<br />
<br />
As he reached for the milk and cereal sitting on the table, he mother got up and left the room, but returned a moment later as Connor started to pour himself a bowl of cereal. Setting down two pills, one purple and one pink, she asked him, &quot;Anything odd to report, Caeleah?&quot;<br />
<br />
At first Connor didn't realise that she was addressing him and realising that his girl name was Caeleah, Connor thought about telling her about the dream and how he'd woken up as an eight-year old girl. But, realising that he couldn't remember the dream and that his mother was talking about side-effects with the pill, Connor thought for a moment and than simply shook his head as he told her, &quot;No, ma'am,&quot; and than reached for the pills.<br />
<br />
Swallowing them with a bit of orange juice, Connor began to eat his breakfast. As he did, he let his mind wander, letting new memories come in hopes that they might provide some answers.<br />
<br />
To his disappointment, they didn't. All his new memories did was to confirm that he was indeed becoming a girl, he was eight-years old, had a dog's tail and ears, and was privately educated during the school year because his mother feared that he'd been teased because of his appearance. Somehow he knew that he would begin phase two of his treatment around the age of ten and that would mean he would start getting a white pill and a yellow pill, in addition to the purple pill and the pink pill.<br />
<br />
&quot;At least its summer,&quot; Connor thought, unsure how it was that he could go to sleep in the fall of a new school year, but wake up in a different season.<br />
<br />
And than he thought how strange it was for a boy to wake up to a world where he was turning into a girl because he wanted to be one. Unsure of all this, he finished his breakfast and took his dishes into the kitchen. Returning to the dining room, he asked, &quot;Mom? Can I go swimming?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If Hadley goes with you, yes,&quot; she told him without looking up from her book.<br />
<br />
Remembering Hadley, Connor suddenly wondered what it was his sister was thinking and if she would act just like mom, acting as if there was apparently nothing off. Turning, Connor started back toward his room, deciding that at the moment he didn't want to go swimming, as it would involve waking Hadley. Changing course, he instead headed for the living room and flopping down into a comfortable position on the couch, he idly began to flip through channels. As he did so, Connor let his mind drift as he tried to find some answer as to how and why he had woken up in his current situation.</p>
