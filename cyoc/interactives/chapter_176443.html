<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jay&#39;s mind when the door was ripped open immediately went to Emma being mortified by the fact Jay was jerking off Nolan, or Terry for whatever reason getting possessive over &quot;her&quot; and freaking out...but when his eyes adjusted to the flash of light from the hallway... it wasn&#39;t what he feared. Jay let out a breath when he saw it was just another of the jocks and his girlfriend standing there. Nolan breathed and sighed, &quot;Aww for fucks&#39; sakes!&quot; Definitely some underlying frustration there.<br />
<br />
Maybe this wasn&#39;t the first time Nolan&#39;s time with a woman got interrupted. Poor guy - he was so insecure about those things going on with him AND he probably got interrupted. Well, Jay went ahead and cleaned off his hand before helping Nolan up, &quot;Sorry that that ended like that, big guy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, it&#39;s...it&#39;s fine. I was hoping we&#39;d get to fuck, but I respect your privacy.&quot; Nolan smiled somewhat awkwardly.<br />
<br />
Jay leaned over and kissed Nolan on the cheek while lightly pinching one of Nolan&#39;s nipples through his shirt, keeping up the act of flirting up Nolan, &quot;Maybe I&#39;ll see you around later. You&#39;re a sweet guy.&quot; The only response Jay got was a low moan and the sight of Nolan&#39;s cock giving an interested jerk at the contact with his nipple. So it seemed Jay wasn&#39;t the only one around here with some sensitivity to go around. <br />
<br />
As Jay walked off, Nolan not far behind, he passed by the pair of partygoers, and it didn&#39;t take long for the door to swing shut and the moaning to begin. Nolan fixed up his pants and said, &quot;Thanks for uh, doing that for me uh, to me and all. I&#39;ll see if I can muscle up some more, since you seem to like me big and buff!&quot; The formerly slim preppy then walked off to rejoin the party out there.<br />
<br />
It was so strange that Jay&#39;s cock leaked a little when he thought about Nolan buffing up more for him. Was Jay so weird because he was so turned on knowing he&#39;d just engaged like a woman would? Or was he feeling weird because here he was, a buff college jock more than half way turned into a woman...and it was turning him on like crazy...? Was that it?<br />
<br />
As he rejoined the floor, dancing with a smile on his face, it would not take long for Emma to find him. She guided him away from the throngs and asked, &quot;So...uh, what happened back there? With you and Mr. Roids. He sure looks happy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Cuz I made him a very happy man.&quot; Jay said with a bit too much ease.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you serious?&quot; Emma shook her head, &quot;Jay, you never voiced any interest in men before this. You have to admit that something&#39;s---&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nothing&#39;s going on, Emma.&quot; Jay crossed his arms in front of his chest, adjusting to be under his breasts, &quot;I&#39;m just enjoying my body and exploring where this all goes. Besides, I can&#39;t very well have sex here. And really, jerking off Nolan is just...helping the guy out and consolidating my image here as a woman...&quot; He leaned in and whispered, &quot;Even though I&#39;m all man.&quot;<br />
<br />
Emma didn&#39;t know if she believed it, but Jay&#39;s confidence was as always intoxicating. And the party was ALSO rather intoxicating.<br />
<br />
She wanted to just go and enjoy herself...and hell, maybe she could find someone here in a more masculine configuration she could temporarily get with. She couldn&#39;t very well go with Jay right now. &quot;I mean, I&#39;d like to have a date here...it feels awful lonely.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So find a guy,&quot; Jay said, &quot;And get to it. I don&#39;t mind. I mean, you don&#39;t exactly mind how I typically am, and I&#39;m not about to hold you to a different standard...&quot; Jay got a sudden rather mischievous look on his face, &quot;Challenge time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Challenge?&quot; Emma tilted her head, and she leaned in, figuring she should at least find some way to enjoy this, &quot;Go ahead. I&#39;m all ears.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;See the doorman?&quot; Jay gestured at Luis, who was just standing there, shirt mostly open. Daring anyone even slightly male attracted to give him a look over...though the message was obvious.<br />
<br />
&quot;Luis? Jaya, you heard the man. He&#39;s gay!&quot; Emma started to realize the challenge, but even she couldn&#39;t fathom what achieving it would mean. &quot;...I mean, you heard him, right? Gay as the day is long.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah I heard him,&quot; Jay started, &quot;But I remember seeing that Luis...when Luis gets worked up enough, he&#39;d be willing to give anything a try. He has exceptions. He&#39;s by and large really desperate for Terry, but...you know.&quot; Jay shrugged, &quot;Just look at him. Sweating. Listening for the other couples from his spot. Really wants to get to it, but there&#39;s not really anyone here to get him done.&quot;<br />
<br />
Emma looked at Jay, &quot;And you think...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh I more than think, Emma.&quot; Jay chuckled, &quot;And haven&#39;t you ever been curious about trying him out?&quot;<br />
<br />
Emma had never seen Jay act or speak like this with her before, and honestly, as scary as it was knowing he was changing, she was now feeling pretty excited. &quot;Okay,&quot; she grinned, &quot;Challenge accepted.&quot;<br />
<br />
And with that Jay started back off to the dance floor, &quot;See ya later, Emms.&quot; As Emma decided to bide her time and watch for the &quot;signs&quot; of Luis getting too worked up, Jay returned to the floor just in time to see Terry finally join the party on the floor. He was again impressed by how muscled and strong Terry looked, how handsome he was. Easily the more good looking of the two in the last pairing.<br />
<br />
Terry started moving alongside her as the song blaring sped up a bit. He was getting very touchy-feely, and Jay was feeling astonishingly like this was...this was thrilling. He didn&#39;t know where it was coming from, but here he was. Dancing with one of his rivals in his own party, and his rival had absolutely no idea it was Jay he was dancing alongside. Fuuuck, Jay thought as he danced with Terry.<br />
<br />
Jay felt like he could just grind all over Terry.<br />
<br />
He wanted to make out with him, writhe all over each other on a couch in the designated make out room among a number of other couples so inclined. He wanted to stick his dick up Terry&#39;s ass and feel the man up close. He wanted to feel Terry&#39;s hands on his breasts, and feel it just get so good. Jay had never really enjoyed the idea of man on man before, but here he was in the guise of a woman enjoying Terry getting all hot and heavy all over him.<br />
<br />
And thankfully with that strap and tight boxers underneath this, Terry wouldn&#39;t have any idea Jay was fucking rock hard right now. Fuck. Fuck... Jay could seriously cum just from the sensations of this dance. The athletic supporter would absorb it, but every moment Jay spent there felt like he was getting closer and closer to orgasm.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey,&quot; Terry said with a grin, &quot;I&#39;ll go get us a room.&quot;<br />
<br />
He went off to find a room in there. Jay stood there watching for a moment, and he felt his athletic supporter absorb a shot of cum that rocketed out of his dick. Ohhh fuck, Jay thought, thank goodness for athletic support. He started to follow Terry out, and he saw Emma and Luis talking already. Luis grinning a bit.<br />
<br />
As Jay followed Terry into one of the rooms not currently in use, he saw his rival standing there, shirt off already. &quot;Hey babe, thought you&#39;d like a show.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jay&#39;s mouth watered, and for some reason he felt the lust renew itself. He had never thought of Terry in this way...and now, now he could not quite help himself. Maybe it was his changed form. Maybe it was some long neglected part of himself surfacing...in part due to the change in his form. But whatever it was, fuck, Jay felt so fucking good right now.</p>
