<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">He paused and said, &quot;That's very strange, they said we're to become cow-boys.. MOOOO!&quot;  Abernathy covered his mouth when the low mooing came from him, suddenly staring at the bowl in fright.<br />
<br />
Brian gave a laugh, which quickly turned into a moo from him as well.  Soon both Brian couldn't focus on anything other than himself as he was wracked with pain.  He stared down at himself as his body began to change.<br />
<br />
Already fit, he started packing on pound after pound of muscle, his clothes stretching to their limit before with a loud rip they tore off him, revealing a physique that could normally only be achieved by countless hours in the gym.  His pecs had become huge slabs of muscle, his arms and legs were thick, veins visible right under the skin.  His firm abs began to push out into a muscle gut, hard and round.  Brian actually became aroused by the changes, gripping his now firm cock and pumping away as he rubbed his new muscles.  Inch by inch he began to grow until he was nearly seven feet tall, ripping off what little clothing remained.<br />
<br />
Another sharp pain in his legs brought Brian's attention downwards.  His thighs were becoming even thicker as he lower legs shortened in length.  His feet grew longer as his toes began to fuse together, the nails becoming thick and pitch black, until all that was left at the end of his foot was a glossy black hoof, his legs looking like the belonged on the back end of a steer, forcing him to adjust his balance for his new stance.  His enlarging hand started undergoing a similar change, his fingers fusing until he was left with two thick fingers and a thumb, the nails thick and black.<br />
<br />
Brian was having trouble stroking his still human dick with such a huge hand, but a pulsing heat on his palm told him that problem was about to change.  His cock began to swell in his hand until he was gripping a nearly two foot long piece of meat, thick around as a soda can.  Next came the tugging sensation in his balls as they swelled, stretching his sack and tugging down with their weight, like two large grapefruit they hung halfway down to his knees.  The skin of his cock began to darken, until it was a glistening ebony.  The skin of his cock began to attack to his stomach near the base, forcing his erection to point upwards as a sheath formed to hold his impressive cock.  A tugging pain from behind him signaled the growth of a long ropey tail.<br />
<br />
He moved both his hands to his cock, bucking his hips into his own hands as the pain began turning into pleasure.  His skull felt clamped in a vice as his head began to rearrange.  He could see his nose and mouth pushing away from his face, thickening into a broad bull's snout, his small human teeth being pushed out in favor of large bovine ones.  His ears became long and pointed, flopping out to the side as pain shot through his temples.  After the sharp pain it felt like something sliding from the side of his skull.  Sparing a hand from his cock for just a moment, he felt the long sharp horns that had sprouted from his head, which now felt almost completely bovine.  He looked like a mostly hairless humanoid cow.<br />
<br />
Soon his body hair began to thicken and spread.  The dark brown pubes around his cock began to grow outwards, short, bristly brown hairs pushing out on his thighs and growing down his legs until they were completely covered in the coarse brown hairs.  The hair covered his muscular ass, growing down his tail until a tuft of pitch black hair grew at the end.  Next the hair began to push upwards, first his muscle gut then his chest growing a thick pelt of brown hair, which spread to his shoulders and down his arms.  The hair on his gut began to spread around, meeting on his back and growing upwards until his entire back and torso was furred.  A thick beard began to sprout on his face, filling in thicker and spreading.  It moved up to his eyes, and down his neck to meet with the pelt on his chest, spreading until his entire head was as hairy as the rest of him.  The hair of his head remained long, darkening to a pitch black, as it grew further down, a thick black mane down to his mid back.<br />
<br />
With a loud moo and a stamp of his hoof his cock shot his first load of bovine cum, soon followed by a second and a third, his cock spurting load after load until his balls were spent.  Brian looked over to were Abernathy was, now seeing another bull man, though not as big and muscular as Brian was, he was still an impressive hunk of beef.</p>
