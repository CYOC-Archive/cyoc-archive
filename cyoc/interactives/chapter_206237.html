<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mr. Robert Huff checked his watch as the speakers droned on and on about reptiles. He’d listened to the same mini-seminar all day and it got grating after the fourth time. The large man had completely forgotten about Jeff’s cellphone. So when he slipped out to take a whiz, it was still in his pocket.<br />
<br />
He hurried, hoping to leave and be back before anyone even noticed. They weren’t supposed to leave kids unsupervised, but they were busy with the lecture.  He unzipped and started peeing into the urinal. Worst case scenario, he’d come back to find a few of them on their phones.<br />
<br />
Mr. Huff checked his phone quickly, trying to find out if he had any hits on his dating profile on WOOFr, BigDadWolf69. <br />
<br />
Who wouldn’t want to fuck a heavily muscled bear with a thick veiny cock like him.? No one in his area, apparently. He sighed. He’d never find the perfect man for him. Someone he could marry, maybe. A young man, preferably a bodybuilder. He was stuck in the middle of nowhere, so he was screwed. Well, not screwed. Lonely.<br />
<br />
A beeping sound caught his attention. He reached down to find the source of the noise and pulled out Jeff’s phone. He’d completely forgotten he had it on him. What was that kid so interested in that he’d risk having it taken away?  He must have downloaded something. He’d watched Jeff the whole time.<br />
<br />
Mr. Huff pulled out Jeff’s phone as he zipped up his fly.<br />
<br />
It was on and open, showing a very strange app. It looked like some kind of dating profile thing. He walked to an empty stall and closed it behind him, scanning the program. It had the weirdest things listed. Currently, it was displaying Jeff Davis’ profile. Even included his…well, unmentionables and orientation.<br />
<br />
<b>Name: Jeff Davis <br />
Age: 14<br />
Build: Slim<br />
Orientation: Bi-curious<br />
Height: 5’4”<br />
Relationship: Student</b><br />
<br />
He chuckled, looking at the stats. <br />
<br />
Robert, or ‘Robby’ as he was known by his friends, didn’t believe in magic. Obviously this app was some kid’s game. He read further. Apparently it could transform things into anything else.<br />
<br />
According to the app,he could turn people into animals and cars and…well, literally anything.<br />
<br />
He didn’t believe it. Robby pulled up his own stats. 52, teacher, bear-like build.<br />
<br />
<b>Name: Robert ‘Robby’ Huff<br />
Age: 52<br />
Build: Bear<br />
Orientation: Gay<br />
Height: 6’4”<br />
Relationship: Self</b><br />
<br />
Could he make a few adjustments, see if it worked?<br />
<br />
The obvious one was age. Maybe try for…forty. Nice number, he’d still had salt-and pepper hair and was old enough to be considered a daddy but not so old to have to call himself a polar bear at the gay bar or dating apps. <br />
<br />
He set the timer to…he glanced at his watch…one minute and pressed enter. An electric shock jumped form the device to his hand, making his whole body tingle. Had it actually just…? Curious, Robby left the stall and walked to the mirror.<br />
<br />
Huff stared at himself in shock. <br />
<br />
It was still him-wide shoulders, chest hair curling out of his shirt and a thick body-but..well, younger. And getting younger with each second that passed.<br />
<br />
Some of the heavier lines on his face grew more shallow-though not disappearing entirely. His muscles grew warm and slowly inflated. He knew he’d lost some definition and size as he’d grown older, but not <I>that</I> much! His hair slowly returned to a dark brown color, with gray hairs speckling it. <br />
<br />
His face itched. He scratched, feeling rough hair follicles grow beneath his fingers. It quickly grew into a short beard streaked with gray. He chuckled. Robby’d had a beard during his 40th birthday that summer. He’d shaved it when the new school year started. Looking at it now, maybe he’d keep it.<br />
<br />
Robby grinned and flexed, his muscles straining his shirt and shorts to the extreme.<br />
<br />
His grin faded as he realized that the app was <I>real</I>. This thing could definitely be dangerous in the wrong hands. And Jeff’s hands were definitely wrong. He needed to get rid of him, fast. What would he do…his eyes fell on his own phone, with his dating profile open with no hits.<br />
<br />
Mr. Huff grinned, knowing the perfect punishment. Jeff had been a pain in the ass for a while now. Maybe it was time to return the favor. He started changing Jeff to something more ‘his type’. <br />
<br />
He started adjusting sliders, sexual preferences. Even altered the name. Jeff Davis became Jeffery Lovell. Age? 25, just out of college. Occupation? Assistant Teacher. Let Jeff handle all the paperwork. Obviously if this thing actually worked, he didn’t want Jeff to know anything so turned the awareness off and checked the box for reality alteration.<br />
<br />
<b>Name: Jefferey (Jeff) Lovell<br />
Age: 25<br />
Build: Twunk<br />
Orientation: Gay<br />
Position: Bottom<br />
Height: 6’<br />
Relationship: Lover/Assistant to Robert Huff.<br />
Time to complete: Half an hour<br />
Subject awareness: None<br />
Alter Reality &#9633; Yes</b><br />
<br />
He checked over the information and hit enter.<br />
<br />
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=============================<br />
<br />
Jeff was listening to the people from the zoo give their boring lecture when he felt a shock hit him. He jumped in his chair and looked around in embarrassment. <br />
<br />
“Sorry.” He said to the speaker, who just smiled and kept talking.<br />
<br />
His body was feeling weirdly tingly.<br />
<br />
Jeff scratched at his chest, feeling itchy. He glanced down in time to see dense curly hairs pop out of his shirt collar. Even his arm hair seemed darker. His fingers paused mid-scratch as the itching spread from his chest to his face and down his belly. He pulled up his shirt and saw a thick treasure trail descending into his crotch.<br />
<br />
Had he always been this hairy?<br />
<br />
He let his shirt fall back over the heavy pelt of chest hair, not noticing his shirt shifting into a collared button-down. Jeff’s cargo shorts lengthened until they settled on the top of his high-tops, which shifted into leather loafers.<br />
<br />
Mr. Huff walked in and quietly sat down at his desk, opened it, and placed a phone inside it. He then glanced over at Jeff and an odd smile crossed his face. The speakers kept droning on about reptiles. Jeff glanced at the clock. Twenty minutes left.<br />
<br />
When he glanced over at his intimidating teacher, the man was typing something. Jeff thought it might have been his own cellphone and scratched his chest again in worry, not feeling it begin to swell thicker and more muscular.<br />
<br />
“Pay attention Mr. Lovell.” Mr Huff growled softly and set Jeff’s phone on his desk. “Here. I better not see it out again.”<br />
<br />
“Yes sir.” Jeff said, and then did a double-take. <br />
<br />
Did he just call him Lovell? Wasn’t his last name…something else? He wanted to correct the big man, but was distracted by his pants getting a bit tight. He shifted in his seat as his ass inflated, forming into a thick bubble butt.<br />
<br />
The speakers finished and wheeled out the reptile. Mr. Huff stood and turned the lights back on. He went over to his desk and began passing tests to everyone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mr. Lovell, please come sit up here.&quot; Mr. Huff said.<br />
<br />
Jeff frowned, wondering why Mr. Huff was having him sit at the assistant teacher&#39;s desk, but stood and stretched anyways. His spine popped as he suddenly grew, arms stretching higher, almost touching the ceiling. He wobbled and stabilized himself on his desk, clothes straining over his heavy muscles and straightened his shirt. <br />
<br />
He walked towards the desk at the side of Mr. Huff’s, feeling off. He towered over his peers and when he went to sit down, his thick ass knocked a piece of chalk off the blackboard. There were scattered giggles and his face reddened.<br />
<br />
“No talking!” Mr. Huff barked, making the students jump. “Your test starts now!”<br />
<br />
The student went to work.<br />
<br />
“Mr. Huff, should I be doing the test?” Jeff asked softly.<br />
<br />
“No, Mr. Lovell. You’ll be grading them.” Mr Huff….smiled at him kindly? <br />
<br />
Jeff squirmed under Mr. Huff&#39;s approving and oddly…appraising attention.<br />
<br />
“Grading them, sir.”<br />
<br />
“Yes, Mr. Lovell. That’s what an assistant teacher does.” Mr Huff smiled, staring into Jeff’s eyes.<br />
<br />
“A-assistant?” Jeff panicked. <br />
<br />
“You have to work with a teacher as their assistant before you become a full member of the faculty.” Mr. Huff said gently.<br />
<br />
Jeff was confused. He looked down at his large, strapping body. When had he gone to college? He must have, to be a TA.<br />
<br />
While he was busy having a crisis, the kids finished their tests and turned them in. Jeff thought he would have no idea what to do, but it turned out that he knew all the answers. He quickly went through the papers, one after another. It became rather rote. Most of the kids had clearly not been paying attention, lots of red marks.<br />
<br />
Mr Huff glanced over and watched Jeff give another F and pulled out his phone. He fiddled with it and then put it away. Jeff looked away when he saw Mr. Huff glance at him. He stared at the paper in hand. A+ was written in bright red.<br />
<br />
He frowned, flipping through the rest of the pile. Lots of A’s and a scattering of B’s. Hadn’t they all been doing bad before?<br />
<br />
“Something wrong, Mr. Lovell?” Mr. Huff growled.<br />
<br />
“Uh, no sir.” Jeff said quickly. “They did great!”<br />
<br />
Mr Huff smiled and leaned back in his chair. Some kids were still knowing on their tests, running out of time as the clock tipped closer to 3pm, when school got out.<br />
<br />
There was a light <I>Woof!</I> sound from his pocket and his phone lit up. He glanced up and saw that Mr. Huff seemed to have not heard anything, though his classmates were giving him glances. He waited for them to return their attention to their papers and pulled out the phone. There was a notification from an app called WOOFr.<br />
<br />
He opened it, wondering when he’d downloaded that app, and saw one message from BigDadWolf69. He clicked on it and a series of photos-no head or face shots-appeared on his phone. This guy was <I>hot</I> nice, thickly muscled body covered in dark brown body hair that was speckled with gray. Totally his type!<br />
<br />
Jeff frowned, something about that sentence felt…off to him, but he couldn’t help but drool over the thick, veiny cock this guy had. He was close by-within 1 mile, according to the app. Did he leave a message? He scrolled down to check.<br />
<br />
All it said was: <b><I>Woof</I>! Nice body SubbyPuppy! Love that chest pelt!”-BigDadWolf69</b><br />
<br />
Jeff swallowed thickly. He looked up to see if anyone saw something on his phone. No one else was paying attention to him, too busy with homework. Mr. Huff might have glanced at him, but when Jeff looked at him, he quickly went back to his paperwork.  <br />
<br />
He sent his own: <b><I>Woof</I>! Right back at you, wolf daddy! New to town. Would luv to meet!-SubbyPuppy</b><br />
<br />
He thought he heard a muffled <I>Woof!</I>  sound from nearby. Jeff glanced around. No one had looked up this time. Even Mr. Huff was studiously ignoring the sound of notifications. Had it come from the hall? Maybe it was a janitor…a couple of them were pretty swoon-worthy.<br />
<br />
Jeff shook his head. What was wrong with him today? Drooling over tubby janitors and furry  muscle daddies. This wasn’t like him. He…wasn’t gay, right?<br />
<br />
Another <I>Woof!</I>  came from his phone. Jeff quickly checked it.<br />
<br />
 <b>Stay where you are after school and close the blinds. I’ll be there.-BigDadWolf69</b><br />
<br />
Jeff smiled and looked around. His cock was getting hard just thinking about the hot time he was going to have. And it was a faculty member! He was totally going to get hired if he got a bunch of recommendations.<br />
<br />
The day soon ended and Jeff waited for his lover to join him. He closed all the shades and tidied up, then waited. Mr Huff stood up and walked to the door. Jeff waited to hear him leave.<br />
<br />
Instead, he locked the door. Jeff turned to see the heavily-muscled teacher smiling at him. Jeff wanted to slap himself. Of fucking course Mr. Huff would have a profile named BigDadWolf69!<br />
<br />
“Aw, don’t be shy.” Mr. Huff sauntered towards him, the intimidating teacher giving Jeff the strangest hard-on, his ice blue eyes glinting. “I think you’re really hot, Jeff.”<br />
<br />
“I-” Jeff swallowed, eyes darting around the room for escape. “You’re my teacher!”<br />
<br />
“Not for a while now. You had me almost twelve years ago now, when I first started teaching.” Mr. Huff stood in front of Jeff and began to unbutton Jeff’s shirt. “Let me help you out of those clothes, Mr. Lovell.”<br />
<br />
Jeff wanted to tell him to stop, but he looked down and saw his body. He was muscular, with a heavy pelt of hair on his chest and leading down to his crotch. Mr. Huff unbuckled Jeff and pulled down his pants. Jeff could see a big bulge in his underwear, like he was smuggling a banana. Mr. Huff began to undress, unveiling the heavily built and thickly muscled bull of a man.<br />
<br />
Mr. Huff’s spicy musk filled the room as he pulled down his pants and underwear, his thick, twelve-inch cock springing to attention. There was no way Jeff was going to be able to handle all of <I>that</I>. Mr. Huff&#39;s cock was beer-can-thick!<br />
<br />
“Well?” Mr Huff grunted impatiently.<br />
<br />
“Well what?”<br />
<br />
“It ain’t gonna suck itself, Jeff.” Mr. Huff pointed at his dick.<br />
<br />
Jeff found himself sinking to his knees before the hefty shaft. He stared at it, smelling the musky dick as it waved in the air just in front of his nose. His mouth was watering, for some reason.<br />
<br />
“Go on.” Mr. Huff growled. “Give it a suck!” <br />
<br />
He took the cock in his mouth and realized the taste…wasn’t so bad. Like a soft fleshy finger, savory. Jeff began to bob his head on Mr. Huff’s length. It was warm and musky and a little sweaty from the day. He began to get into the cock-sucking, using his tongue. One hand came up and began to fondle Mr. Huff&#39;s swollen balls.<br />
 <br />
Mr. Huff’s big hands began to massage his head. Jeff moaned and let the hands help him bob properly.<br />
<br />
“That’s it.” Mr. Huff softly encouraged.<br />
<br />
His teachers hands began to press his thick cock deeper into Jeff’s mouth. It hit the back of the young man’s throat, making him gag, then Mr. Huff pulled out his phone and pressed something on it and his cock slid smoothly down his throat. Jeff swallowed, massaging the veiny shaft.<br />
<br />
“Fuck you’re so hot” His teacher moaned, running his fingers through Jeff’s hair. “You like swallowing my thick cock, boy?”<br />
<br />
Jeff wanted to tell Mr. Huff to go fuck himself, but the scary thing was, he <I>did</I> like it.<br />
<br />
Mr. Huff’s hands pressed down insistently and Jeff eagerly took the huge cock all the way down to its base, nose smothered in his musky pubes. He licked around the shaft, enjoying the pulse of the veins as they throbbed. <br />
<br />
He reached out a hand and teased his teacher’s balls, making his cock twitch in Jeff’s mouth. Mr. Huff moaned and Jeff felt something sweet and sticky coat his lips. Something warm began to trickle down his throat. Mr. Huff started bucking his hips faster and faster. Jeff picked up the pace, savoring the stream of precum. It ended abruptly when his teacher quivered and pulled Jeff off his huge, turgid cock.<br />
<br />
“That’s enough.” Mr. Huff panted.<br />
<br />
“B-but you didn’t finish?” Jeff blinked, dazed.<br />
<br />
“Saving it for the main course.” Mr. Huff grinned, wiping some drool off Jeff’s chin. “You did good for your first time, kid.”<br />
<br />
Jeff nodded happily, mind returning slowly and the realization that he’d just sucked his teacher’s dick hit him. Everything about this situation was wrong. He wasn’t gay and he wasn’t even supposed to be older and muscular. Mr. Huff pulled out a bottle and squeezed some clear gel in his hands, rubbing them together to warm it up.<br />
<br />
It was all so wrong, so very wrong, so why-he groaned as Mr. Huff spread some cool lube around his needy hole-why did it feel so <I>good</I>?<br />
<br />
Mr. Huff embraced him one-handed and kissed him deeply. <br />
<br />
Jeff tried to fight off the invader with his own tongue but ended up just making out with his DILF-y teacher. He began to get into it, cock stiffening, and embraced the bigger, older man back, trailing his fingers through his back fur, smelling his skin. <br />
<br />
And then Mr. Huff slipped a finger in Jeff’s ass. <br />
<br />
Jeff gasped, going completely stiff, then moaned. The digit was stroking something in him, something that made him melt into Mr. Huff’s arms and lay his head on his teacher’s shoulders.<br />
<br />
“There we go, Jeff. Relax. Just let your big, bad daddy stretch your hole right, okay?” Mr Huff rumbled.<br />
<br />
Jeff wanted to protest but had to stifle a moan as Mr. Huff’s well-lubed fingers rubbed a spot inside him. Robby&#39;s finger was insistent, each prod lighting up Jeff’s pleasure center. He gave up trying to struggle and relaxed, his hole loosening under his teacher’s tender touch.<br />
<br />
Mr. Huff lay Jeff down on his desk and raised the twunky assistant teachers legs over his head, pulling him closer. He plopped his huge, throbbing cock against Jeff’s belly as he splayed his ass open. The huge dome of his cockhead rubbed against Jeff’s well-lubed entrance. <br />
<br />
Jeff glanced down and tensed at the sight of the twelve-inch monster knocking on his backdoor. He wanted to protest, mind finally catching up to what was happening. His teacher was going to <I>fuck</I> him!<br />
<br />
“Mr. Huff, you’re so big!” Jeff gasped.<br />
<br />
“Call me Robby.” Mr. Huff growled in Jeff’s ear, sending a thrill through him.<br />
<br />
“But I’m too tight!’ Jeff protested.<br />
<br />
“That’s alright, Jeff.” Mr Huff smirked pressing his cockhead forward like a battering ram. “I’m going to get you nice and stretched out.”<br />
<br />
Jeff moaned as the cock pressed insistently against its hole. His anal ring held for a few moments, pressure growing, then his muscles gave out and his hole stretched wide. It filled him, rubbing something that made Jeff’s toes curl in delight. He looked down as the big, bad wolf finally managed to cram his dick inside of him. <br />
<br />
The sight of his anus spread around the huge, throbbing tool, nearly made Jeff cum right there.<br />
<br />
Robby saw the look of shock and delight on Jeff’s face and bent down and kissed him. Jeff moaned into the kiss, wrapping his arms around the larger, older man, feeling  strangely hot and vulnerable.<br />
<br />
“God, you’re perfect.” Robby muttered, holding the twunky assistant teacher in his arms, the head of his cock finally in Jeff’s tight ass. He brought out a phone and tapped something into it. “That app is amazing.”<br />
<br />
“App?” Jeff asked, then groaned as Mr. Huff ground his cockhead against his passage.<br />
<br />
He saw Mr. Huff…Robby, toss the phone onto his desk. It looked awfully a lot like Jeff’s phone. Wait, had Robby used his phone on him?<br />
<br />
“Nothing you need to worry about anymore.” Robby growled in his ear, sending tingles down his spine. <br />
<br />
“Yes sir.” Jeff whispered.<br />
<br />
“Good boy.” Robby grinned and pressed harder.<br />
<br />
Robby’s thick dick spread his hole wider. The stretch had ceased to be uncomfortable, as though his elasticity had increased. It felt…strangely good, like the cock was working out all his muscles. The huge pecker glided in, rubbing Jeff’s prostate, then Robby pulled out, leaving Jeff feeling empty.<br />
<br />
“Hngh!,” Jeff moaned, his eyes locked on Robby’s.<br />
<br />
“You want daddy’s big cock in you, don’t you boy?” Robby growled. “Want him to stretch you out and dump a load in you?”<br />
<br />
He didn’t want to say yes. It was his teacher fucking him after all! He was so big and domineering and muscular and hot…Jeff moaned as Mr. Huff pressed further into his hole, stretching him out so nicely. Jeff wanted more. Wanted Robby to really take him to pound town. The big bear of a man on top of him gently pushed another inch into him, coaxing more precum from Jeff.<br />
<br />
“Y-yes, daddy!” Jeff panted.<br />
<br />
Robby pulled Jeff into his cock all the way down to the hilt in one fluid motion. His hole was stretched wide in an instant. Robby bottomed out, clapping Jeff’s cheeks.<br />
<br />
Jeff gave a strangled yelp of pleasure. His breath wheezed out of him and he gasped, feeling too full to even take a breath. He gasped and clawed at Robby’s back, the sensations overloading him. Robby grinned and pulled back to just the tip, leaving Jeff to gasp and moan. And then hilted him again, his big balls *thwapping* into Jeff’s.<br />
<br />
It hurt, but in a good way, his balls sending mixed messages. Again and again, Robby thrust inside him, balls *thwapping* against balls. Precum spurted from Jeff’s untouched cock. <br />
<br />
He moaned, tears of confused pleasure trickled down his face. His anal ring was stretched so wide by Robby&#39;s veiny girth. His teacher was so fucking hot. No, wait, not his teacher, not anymore. <I>His boyfriend.</I> The thought made his cock jump and belch another spoonful of precum. <br />
<br />
“I love you Robby!” Jeff blurted.<br />
<br />
Robby paused, panting, and kissed Jeff hard. “I love you too, Jeff.”<br />
<br />
Jeff drew Robby into a deep kiss, enjoying the rub of his beard against Jeff’s face. <br />
<br />
His teacher grunted and started to fuck him faster, pistoning his hips, his cock sliding across Jeff’s prostate with each motion. Jeff squirmed in pleasure, his tender ass oh-so-sensitive. Each thrust drew out a moan, and the idea that it was his teacher fucking him receded to the back of his mind. It stopped mattering, the only thing that mattered was the huge tool stretching him wide and the hot daddy who was pounding him.<br />
<br />
Robby slammed into his prostate again and again. Jeff’s toes curled as something built deep inside him. Daddy knew how to fuck him right. Jeff broke, giving up his old memories and surrendered himself to a blissful orgasm. The pleasure built and built until he…he…<br />
<br />
“Robby, I-I’m, I’m gonna…” Jeff gasped.<br />
<br />
“Call me daddy, boy!” Mr. Huff growled fiercely.<br />
<br />
Robby slammed him down on his cock and began to bounce him. Jeff gripped Robby’s muscular back as he thrust relentlessly at his prostate.  Robby drove his cock into him hard and deep, mercilessly. Jeff felt waves of warm pleasure radiating from his hole. His balls churned and tensed, his asshole clenching around the thick, veiny dick, and his orgasm hit.<br />
<br />
“Oh fuck, daddy!” Jeff squealed as hot, thick ropes of cum spurted all over Robby’s chest fur.<br />
<br />
Robby growled and then clutched Jeff to his heavily muscled chest and shuddered in orgasm, cock flexing and spewing a hot wetness deep in Jeff’s hole, seeding him properly. <br />
<br />
They panted and basked in the afterglow. Jeff loved the feeling of wetness in his ass, knowing it was Mr. Huff’s virile seed. He embraced Robby one more time. The big bear rocked him from side to side in his embrace, smelling Jeff’s hair.<br />
<br />
After the pleasure faded away, they stood and cleaned themselves up.<br />
<br />
“Where do you live, Mr. Lovell?” Mr. Huff asked as he slipped on his clothes.<br />
<br />
“Uh, motel for now, still looking for my own place.” Jeff said, the memories coming to him faster now.<br />
<br />
“Oh no, not a hotel. You can stay at my place. There’s a spare room.” Robby’s handsome, bearded face spread in a wide grin. “Or you can sleep in my bed.”<br />
<br />
“Only if it has you in it.” Jeff said coyly, running his fingers through Robert’s thick chest hair and kissed his new lover.<br />
<br />
“Good news, boy.” Robby rumbled. “It does.”<br />
<br />
“Are we...dating then?” Jeff asked tentatively. <br />
<br />
“Dating’s such a pain, you know? I think I’ll just put a ring on it.” Mr Huff smiled happily and tapped something on his phone.<br />
<br />
A heavy weight settled on Jeff’s finger. He rubbed the heavy gold wedding ring and waited for his husband to finish texting.  <br />
<br />
“Ready to hit the gym, Mr. Huff?” Robby put away his phone and smiled.<br />
<br />
“Can’t wait to see my ass stretch my gym shorts, huh?” Jeff chuckled.<br />
<br />
 “You know it, boy.” Robby ran his hands over Jeff’s substantial ass. <br />
<br />
They got in Robby’s sports car and drove off.</p>
