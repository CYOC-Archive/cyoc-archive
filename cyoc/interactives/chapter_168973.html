<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Later that morning the atmosphere was still gloomy. Anna  grabbed some panties and put them on, her enlarged pussy barely covered by the fabric. She tried to cheer David up embracing him and kissing him.<br />
&quot;Come on dear, it will be alright. Lets go eat something I&#39;m sure we will feel better after.&quot;<br />
<br />
They dressed up and went to the hotel restaurant. The room was really big with a lot of tables but but at that time there were only a few people. David and Anna reached a free table and took their seats. Sitting down David felt again his enlarged sensitive anus and readjusted his position to be more comfortable.<br />
&quot;What do you want to eat Dave? Let&#39;s take some meat, the steaks seems really good.&quot; said Anna<br />
&quot;Ok  lets call a waiter&quot;<br />
They ordered the steaks and some wine and started to wait.<br />
&quot;Maybe we can use some toys&quot; said David.<br />
&quot;Dave, are you still thinking about that? I told you it is not a big problem&quot;<br />
&quot;It is, for me. I want you to feel good and until I change even more I&#39;m not going to be able to do it.&quot;<br />
&quot; You always make me feel good, I&#39;m happy when I&#39;m with you dummy, but if this idea can make you happy again i suppose we can try it.&quot;<br />
<br />
The waiter approaced their table carrying two plates with their stakes.<br />
Anna started eating right away, she was really hungry and the steak looked marvellous, cooked by expert hands. <br />
David hesitated, the smell coming from the steak made him nauseated. <br />
&quot; Are you sure this isn&#39;t rotten? It smells badly.&quot;<br />
&quot;What are you talking about?It is one of the best steaks I ever had in my life.&quot;<br />
&quot;It smells i&#39;m telling you, I&#39;m calling the waiter.&quot;<br />
David explained the situation to a kind waiter that explained shortly after:<br />
&quot; Don&#39;t worry sir, it happens very often, as time pass and your sense of smell and your digestive system changes so changes your tastes.<br />
I&#39;ll bring you something I&#39;m sure you will enjoy more.&quot;<br />
The waiter  quickly walked away.<br />
&quot;He is going to bring you a ball of hay&quot; said Anna joking and David finally smiled at the thought.<br />
Moments later the waiter was back with a big plate filled with vegetables. Everything was very fresh, above a bed of salad and radish rested carrots,  little sweet tomatoes and sliced apples. The dish was completed with aromatic vinegar  and oil.<br />
&quot;It looks really good, actually.&quot; said David. <br />
&quot;I can assure you it tastes even better.&quot; replied the waiter  before leaving to serve another table.<br />
David stated eating. The waiter was not wrong, it was a really good salad and David savored it with renovated taste.<br />
&quot;I guess I&#39;ve become a vegetarian, do you want some of it?&quot;<br />
&quot;No, thank you I&#39;m fine. I&#39;ll soon join you but while i still can I&#39;m going to enjoy this great steak&quot; said Anna.<br />
<br />
They finished their meal and with full stomach returned to the hotel&#39;s lobby. David&#39;s mood was much better now and Anna was happy to see him smile again.<br />
Beside the reception was a large box with a pile of papers and a pen near it. On it, with big red letter, was written &quot; Requests&quot;.<br />
David and Anna walked near the box and took a paper.<br />
&quot;How do you think this works? &quot;asked Anna.<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know, i suppose we write what we want on this paper and up here in the corner we mark our room number.&quot;<br />
&quot;What are you going to ask?&quot;<br />
&quot;I was thinking something like - erotic toys - what do you think?<br />
&quot;Fine for me. Write that and put the paper in the box.&quot;<br />
She kissed him on the cheek, she knew that it was important for him in that moment.<br />
&quot;Done, let&#39;s go for a walk. I need some movement to digest all that salad.&quot; <br />
<br />
They started walking along the lake in the park, the sun reflecting in the blue water. A lot of young couples were resting on the grass some were kissing and others were playing more actively, protected by the vegetation of the park.<br />
As they were walking Anna started to feel her panties rubbing on her now enlarged pussy and clitoris. Her tight jeans aslo wasn&#39;t helping in stimulating her.<br />
They kept walking but soon she stopped, the front of her thight jeans was soaked from her juices. <br />
&quot;Dave, I need to stop. My panties are too tight they keep rubbing everywhere. They are driving me crazy.&quot; <br />
&quot;Do you want to get back to the hotel?&quot;<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t keep walking with this on.&quot;<br />
&quot;I can carry you if you want, or you can remove your clothes.&quot;<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t want to walk naked to the hotel!&quot;<br />
&quot;Someone once said something like this: do you think somebody care about that, here? We are on Pleasure Island! &quot;<br />
&quot;This is different David you know it.&quot;<br />
&quot;Come on jenny, show the world that nice ass of yours! If it can make you feel better i&#39;ll undress too.&quot; He dropped his pants in the middle of the streets with his bottom half naked for all to see. Some people near them cheered and clapped to encourage them.<br />
Still reluctant Anna started to drop her pants and panties. More cheering ensued as she exposed her self to the world, her pussy gleaming with juice. <br />
David picked up all of their discarded clotes and then took her hand.<br />
&quot;That is my brave jenny&quot; he said before kissing her. She blushed but was happy to have him beside her. He had always been more shy than she was but was ready to be at her side to help in this situation. <br />
Hand in hand they walked back to the hotel.   <br />
<br />
Once inside they passed again neat the REQUEST box.<br />
&quot;Just a minute dear.&quot;said David. He wrote quickly something on the paper and put it in the box.<br />
&quot;What have you requested?&quot;<br />
&quot;Nothing important, don&#39;t worry. Lets go to our room&quot;<br />
<br />
Once inside Anna jumped on the bed and rested on the fresh sheets with her legs open.<br />
&quot;Let me see what is going on down there, Anna.&quot; said David as he examinated her lower region.<br />
&quot;You have changed more from this morning, look your skin around here is almost black now, and your clitty is even bigger than before. Also your pubic hairs have changed a bit, it seems that they are much more thick.&quot; <br />
&quot;I&#39;m so horny right now, with all that stimulation from before.&quot;<br />
She started rubbing her clit as her engorged and needing pussy kept releasing juices.<br />
David looked around and finally his eyes stopped on a big box placed on the main table of the room.<br />
He walked to the box while Anna kept pleasuring herself. He opened the box and looked inside.<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry love, soon you will feel A LOT better...&quot;</p>
