<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As she was looking a potential husband, Katie spotted something going on near the playground. She doesn’t know what, but it looks like two older kids were bullying someone younger than them. She could hear the young individual in a boy’s voice getting hurt as the two bullies were having their fun.<br />
<br />
“Please stop hurting me!”<br />
<br />
“Or what? You’re going to tell your mommy on us. Sorry, but I think she’s a little preoccupied in banging her brains out.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah! No one is going to help you, which makes it easy for us to do this!”<br />
<br />
One of the bullies kicked him again as the young boy groaned in pain. Katie could see this and was getting annoyed by the two picking on the little boy. Sort of reminded her of herself when she was bullied before she found the ring. There was nothing she could do about it when she was just a kid. But now that she’s an adult, she can do something about. Feeling the anger boiling in, she got off the base of the fountain and marched her way to the playground. By the time she got close to the two bullies and said, “Let him go!”<br />
<br />
The two turned to Katie and saw her towering over them. One of the bullies looked to her and said, “What did you say?”<br />
<br />
Katie glared at them and said it again with her arms crossed, “I said, let him go…”<br />
<br />
The second bully looked to her and said, “Listen lady, I don’t know what you want, but this isn’t your concern. Now get out before we teach you a lesson.”<br />
<br />
Katie had a slight grin and said, “Oh really? And what are you going to do about it? You guys are a little too young for me. I’m also wondering if your families know where you are. I mean, if they see you torturing this poor boy, I could imagine the consequences you would have if I tell them about it.”<br />
<br />
The two just stood there and was a little quiet. Many things have gone through their heads. Questions like who is this woman? What does she want with them? Does she know their families? Is she friends with them? Does she know where they live? So many questions that need to be answered. But the last thing they want is to get on her bad side, so they decided to call it a day.<br />
<br />
“All right,” one of the bullies said, “We’ll leave. Just as long as this brat has taught a lesson.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah!” the other one said, “It’s not like we have nothing else to do. Come on, let’s hit the Arcade for some fun.”<br />
<br />
The two soon left their target and walked away from Katie. She looked to the bullies leaving and smiled, knowing that she did a good job. She doesn’t need to ring to teach them a lesson, but her older self to solve some problems. It’s not like she would need a ring to solve everything. Turning to her right she could see the young boy was crying from the aftermath of the fight and felt sorry for him. Getting close to him, she placed her hand on his shoulder and said, “There, there… It’s all right. Those bullies are long gone.”<br />
<br />
The young boy sniffed and turned to see the person that saved him. Katie looked to him and was shocked to see who she saved. It was a young boy at seven and was a little stacked on the sides. His short black hair and messy as his chubby face had a few cuts around his hazel eyes. Starring at him, she knew that he was Michael, or Mike for short, and is/was an old friend of Katie before she had found the ring. It looked like he had been through a fight and was really upset over this. But was happy that someone saved him.<br />
<br />
“Thank you for saving me, Ms.” he said to her, “I don’t know what would happen if you came to me.”<br />
<br />
Katie starred at him before blinking; trying to make sure that it doesn’t get awkward. “Oh… Don’t mention it.” She said, “I was at the right place and the right time. So, why would these two bully you? Why were you all alone? Shouldn’t your family be around?”<br />
<br />
Mike looked to her and gave a deep sigh as a tear came down his eye. “I don’t have a family.” Mike said to her, “My daddy left mommy when I was three and mommy kicked me out of the house because she was feeling naughty and didn’t want me around.”<br />
<br />
Katie heard that and was shocked by it. Katie knew that something was wrong with Mike when she was little, but she never said anything. Now that she heard it, she was shocked to see what occurred and felt very sorry for him.<br />
<br />
“Oh, you poor thing…” she said, feeling sorrow about it, “I’m sorry that you had to go through all of that. Don’t you have anyplace to go?”<br />
<br />
Mike shook his head as a response. She thought this through and decided to help him out. “Why don’t you come and stay at my house for a little while?” she asked him, “I can take care of you until things ease over.”<br />
<br />
Mike looked to her and was a little nervous. “Are you sure that I could stay with you?” he asked her, “I don’t want to be staying with strangers.”<br />
<br />
Katie smirked to him and responded by saying, “Oh, I’m no stranger. In fact, I certain I could be your friend. Besides, how are you going to go to your own house if you look like a mess?”<br />
<br />
Mike looked down and could tell that the bullies did a number on him. They were fighting him in the mud and he was drenched from his shirt and shoes. Sighing, he said, “Well I guess you have a point. I don’t want mom to be madder at me with my clothes being dirty.”<br />
<br />
“Then it’s settled. Come with me. I’m certain that you’ll feel better after staying with me.” she said to him, as she offered her hand. Mike was a little hesitant, as he doesn’t know much of this woman. Yet before she was his friend before she obtained the ring and causes her to turn into an independent, athletic, and sexy looking woman. Looking to her warm smile, it felt familiar to him, as it is the same smile she had when she was younger. So with a bit of confidence, he took her hand and the two walked out of the part and headed to Katie’s house.<br />
<br />
After a bit of walking, the two made it to her house and Katie got him into the front door. By the time he got in, Mike was amazed by the sight of it. “Wow…” he said in awe, “This is where you live? This is very cool! How did you get this house? Not even my mom has a house as nice as this!”<br />
<br />
Katie chuckled and was pleased with his reaction. “Well, since my mom&#39;s a high-end lawyer, you get to have some really good perks.”<br />
<br />
Mike quickly rushed to the living room and saw the view of the city and houses and was amazed by the sight. “It even has a view!” he said excitedly, “I can see my house from here! This is awesome!”<br />
<br />
Katie got next to him and exclaimed that it was no big deal. “Well, sometimes living in this part of town makes you think you’re at the top of the world. But I always care for everyone below me. That includes you, Mike.” She soon looked at his messy clothes and decided to tell him to take a shower. “Speaking of which, I think you need a bath badly. Let’s take you upstairs.”<br />
<br />
He grabbed his hand and guided him upstairs to the bathroom. Once they were in there, she said, “Now, take off all of your clothes so I can wash them.”<br />
<br />
Mike blinked and was a little embarrassed. “Me? Naked? With you?” he asked many questions, “I don’t know if it’s okay to see me without any clothes on.”<br />
<br />
Katie smirked to him and told him, “It’s all right. To be fair, I always walk around naked when I’m at home. It makes me feel a little natural. I’m certain that you will feel comfortable naked with me.”<br />
<br />
Mike gulped and still didn’t want to be naked in front of a random stranger. Still, there was a bit of familiarity with her as she has that same innocent looked the younger Katie had back when they were friends. So without second thought, he slowly stripped his clothes down and was down to his underwear. Katie looked on and told him to do it.<br />
<br />
“Now, now Mike. Don’t leave me hanging. Take your underwear off so I can wash it as well.”<br />
<br />
Mike remained silent, as he didn’t want to. But she won’t leave until he had all the clothes off for her to take down. Sighing in defeat, he quickly slid his underwear down and tossed it to her, quickly covering his privates. Katie still got a chance to look at him and could tell that nothing hasn’t changed much. He was completely chubby and she caught a glimpse on how small his penis is. But she pretended not to see it and told him, “There… Now wasn’t that better? Take your shower now. I’ll be at the washing your clothes if you need me.”<br />
<br />
Mike nervously nodded as he headed to the shower as Katie closed the door. Heading downstairs, she headed to the washroom and place Mike’s clothes in the washing machine. As she started to wash his clothes, she sighed and couldn’t believe what Mike was going through.<br />
<br />
“Poor Mike…” she said to herself, “I never knew that he was going through some hard times. But now, after telling it to me as an adult, I didn’t think that he has trouble with family and a mother who is a whore. He deserves better than this. There’s got to be a way to make him happy. But how?”<br />
<br />
Looking down to her hand, she could see the ring on her finger and realized something. “Of course!” she said with an idea, “Why didn’t I think of this sooner? I could use my ring to make Mike’s life better. He could be happier if I made a wish for him.”<br />
<br />
Katie pondered over what to do with Mike. The main problem is that most of the solutions she could think of involved changing Mike&#39;s mother and she wasn&#39;t sure if she could alter a person with the ring when they weren&#39;t present. She didn&#39;t want to make Mike younger and become his mother. She thought about making him older, but how old should she make him?<br />
<br />
Katie thought about making Mike into a young man and her face warmed up. She was curious what Mike would look like grown up. The other girls in her old class had teased her that she and Mike would be married someday. That idea had sounded silly then, but now it sounded very appealing. Katie admitted she wanted some companionship and Mike might be the best person to fill that role. Besides, it would get him out from under his uncaring mother&#39;s thumb. She rubbed the ring on her finger and said, &quot;I wish Mike was old enough to be my husband.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mike scrubbed himself in the tub. He was very grateful to the nice lady for driving those bullies away. His mom would probably have been angry if he came home dirty. He still wondered why the nice lady took her back to her very nice home and let him take a bath while she washed his clothes.<br />
<br />
The bathwater was so warm, Mike didn&#39;t notice the tingling at first. He was focused on scrubbing off the dirt that had gotten on him. He didn&#39;t notice the water slowly getting higher as his body was gaining more mass. Of course, everything was staying the same size from his perspective. It wasn&#39;t until Mike noticed the soap bar was smaller in his hand that he noticed something was different. &quot;Gee, I didn&#39;t use that much soap, did I?&quot; he asked. He paused a little at that. Did his voice sound different? Feeling a little uncomfortable, Mike shifted his legs. He looked down and suddenly noticed he was taking up a lot more space in the tub then when he had first got in.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s going on here?&quot; asked Mike. His voice actually did sound different to his ears, not as high as before. He grabbed the edges of the tub and tried to push himself out, though it was a little hard to get his legs under him. When he was standing, he saw that he was looking at the bathroom from a higher perspective than before. He looks down at himself and sees that he wasn&#39;t as chubby as he was before, his round middle less noticeable on his taller body. He steps out of the tub and wraps a towel around his waist before going to the mirror. Starting back at Mike in the mirror was an older boy who looked sorta like him. He had the same black hair and hazel eyes, but his cheeks weren&#39;t as pudgy as Mike&#39;s were. Mike put a hand up to his face and felt his cheeks. His face felt less round than before, straighter and less boyish.<br />
<br />
->>-<br />
<br />
Katie headed back up the stairs toward the bathroom. She wondered if she had given Mike enough time to fully grow. Of course, he was going to ask questions about what was going on. But Katie wasn&#39;t going to make up any stories. If Mike was going to be her husband now, he deserves to know the truth about her and the ring. She just hoped that Mike would be understanding about it. She paused for a moment at the bathroom door, wondering if she should knock first. But then, Mike would try to keep her out, disguising that he was aging and prolonging this for too long. Katie didn&#39;t want to bother with the farce and just opened the door.<br />
<br />
Of course, Mike let out a yelp when she came in, but it wasn&#39;t nearly as soprano as it used to be. The boy that was clutching a towel over his waist was not the same dirt-covered boy whose clothes Katie had taken down to watch mere minutes ago. At her best guess, he was now twice the age he had been before, making him 14 and at the start of puberty. His body had grown taller and lankier, his childhood fat had melted away. It might have been hard to recognize him if he didn&#39;t still have his black hair and hazel eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Haven&#39;t you ever heard of knocking?&quot; snapped Mike, his voice cracking as his Adam&#39;s apple started to grow.<br />
<br />
&quot;You don&#39;t need to be shy around me, Michael,&quot; said Katie, leaning against the door frame, crossing her arms under her breasts.<br />
<br />
&quot;H-How do you know my name?&quot; asked Mike. However, his eyes weren&#39;t locked on Katie&#39;s face now, but the breasts she was lightly pushing up. As puberty progressed, he began to notice how sexy Katie was. His hormones made his eyes look up and down Katie&#39;s body in its tight sexy workout clothes. Testosterone started filling his body as it grew. His muscles were starting to become larger and more defined, his shoulders expanding wider.<br />
<br />
Katie smiled as she noticed that something was starting to press underneath the towel around his waist. &quot;We knew each other for years when we were both kids, Michael,&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
&quot;But, how could we both be kids?&quot; asked Mike. His face was stretching out as his jaw started to become more defined, more chiseled. Black hairs were forming on his pecs and on his arms and legs. A treasure tail was leading from his navel, down between his hardening abs and under the towel which was getting more tented.<br />
<br />
&quot;Surely you haven&#39;t forgotten your old friend Katie,&quot; asked Katie.<br />
<br />
&quot;K-K-Katie?&quot; asked Mike, his eyes finally locking on hers again. Confusion was evident in his face before the altered memories of the reality changes pushed aside and he remembered his childhood friend. &quot;Katie? Is it really you?&quot; he asked, &quot;How is this possible? How have you grown up so fast?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The same way you&#39;re growing up right now,&quot; said Katie, walking towards him. He was her height by now and it still showed signs of getting taller. She held up her left hand with the ring on it. &quot;This ring gives me the power to make people younger or older and alter reality so no one would notice. If I wanted to, I could have just aged you up and you wouldn&#39;t know the difference.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then why didn&#39;t you?&quot; asked Mike, his voice becoming a soft tenor.<br />
<br />
&quot;Because we were such good friends and I didn&#39;t realize how hard a life you had,&quot; said Katie, &quot;I wanted to make it up to you for leaving you behind as I grew up. And to be honest, I was feeling a little lonely and I was wondering if you consider me...&quot; At this point, she pressed against him, her breasts in her sports bra pushing against his expanding chest. &quot;...as a wife,&quot; she said in a breathy voice.<br />
<br />
Mike smiled as a deeper attraction appeared in his eyes. &quot;Well, there&#39;s one way to find out,&quot; he said before leaning in. They closed their eyes as they kissed. A simple kiss soon became a loving make-out session. Mike&#39;s hands soon clinging the towel to his waist to trace their way up Katie&#39;s body. Katie heard the sound of the towel falling to the floor and she soon felt something hard pressing into her stomach. But she didn&#39;t care by then. She was too occupied with eating Mike&#39;s face, which since it was still gaining height forced her to lean her head back to continue. She grasped his left shoulder with her left hand and the hand attached to that shoulder reached up to grasp her hand.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, there was a feeling like a static shock between the two hands that made both Katie and Mike stop kissing. They looked at their left hands to see what caused it. The ring on Katie&#39;s finger had changed, becoming thinner, more detailed, and having a small sapphire embedded in it. A gold ring was also on Mike&#39;s ring finger, identical to Katie&#39;s ring&#39;s original shape but set with a ruby. &quot;Well, I guess that makes it official,&quot; said Mike, his voice deep and mature, &quot;We&#39;re engaged now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Katie nodded as she closed her eyes for a moment as the new reality&#39;s memories caught up. Her childhood with Mike reestablished as they remained friends through elementary school, high school, and college. While Katie excelled at athletic competition, Mike planned for a more stable job as an oceanographer. But the two of them remained attached to each other and are just about ready to tie the knot. But exploring the new past could wait, Katie wanted to focus on the present. &quot;And I want to see my future husband&#39;s big strong body right now,&quot; she said huskily.<br />
<br />
Mike only grinned before Katie grasped his hand and led him to her bedroom, soon to be their bedroom now. She indicated at the bed and Mike walked over to it before laying on top of it. Katie took the time to admire Mike&#39;s body. He had gone from a chubby little boy to a big muscular man. Her memories indicated that she had encouraged her boyfriend to stay in shape and it definitely showed. Instead of a pudgy body, his muscles were large and fairly sculpted, pecs, abs, biceps, triceps, and leg muscles all well-defined. There was a sexy amount of hair on his body as well, black like the hair on his head which remained the same. His face was very handsome too with a strong jaw and Roman nose that still held his familiar hazel eyes. But it was his crotch that drew Katie&#39;s attention. He had seen Mike&#39;s little package before and that was nothing compared to what he was loaded with now. His tiny balls, once indiscernible, were now both the size of golf balls and covered with a short, dense coating of black hair. His tiny, little penis had been greatly blessed by puberty, growing longer than Katie could grasp in both hands. Girth-wise, Mike was a bit on the slender size, but he made up for it in both length and, as her memories were telling her, maneuverability.<br />
<br />
Katie decided she wanted to give Mike a little show. She took off her running shoes and pulled off her socks. Then she put her hands on the hem of her running shorts and tugged them down, revealing the tight panties underneath. Katie hooked her thumbs on the edges of her panties and wiggled them back and she inched them down. When they felt loose enough, she let go, letting them fall and revealing her neatly trimmed bush. She then reached and grabbed the bottom of her sports bra. She slowly pulled it upwards, revealing the curves of her lower breasts. She paused as she reached the middle point before giving a quick tug. Her breasts came loose from the cups and bounced, revealing her erect nipples. Katie pulled the sports bra over her head, allowing Mike to gaze at her glorious D-cup boobs, her toned stomach, her pleasingly wide hips, and the rest of her curvy body. Once the sports bra had fallen to the floor, Katie reached up for her last piece of clothing. She pulled off the hair tie keeping her honey-colored hair in a ponytail before tossing her head, allowing her long blonde hair to fly about.<br />
<br />
Mike was watching Katie&#39;s striptease with great interest and his penis couldn&#39;t be more erect. With that out of the way, Katie sashayed her way to the bed, let her hips sway enticingly. She climbed onto the bed and sat on Mike&#39;s legs. She grasped Mike&#39;s long rod and aimed it as she got to her knees and put herself above Mike&#39;s lap. When the head of Mike&#39;s penis was touching her, she let out a sign before going down. His penis went deep into Katie&#39;s vagina as she went.<br />
<br />
Mike groaned as Katie took his long shaft into her. While neither of them had sex before in real time, their new memories told them they were far from virgins in this new timeline. So Mike knew when to thrust his hips forward and bury the rest of him inside Katie. Katie gasped before moaning as she slid back. The two of them soon got into a rhythm of Mike thrusting and Katie sliding. Katie moaned as she felt Mike get deeper inside of her. She soon started pushing back at him, making her large breasts bounce. Mike reached up and grasped her breasts, keeping them still for a moment. He soon had Katie moaning louder as he teased her nipples before putting his lips around one.<br />
<br />
At this point, Katie was completely lost in the passion of their sex. She started bouncing harder on top of Mike, feeling the head of his penis tap on her cervix. Mike was grunting louder as Katie became more frantic. He could feel his balls tightening up, getting ready to fire. To bring Katie closer to orgasm, he started shifting underneath her, making his dick move around in Katie to rub against the walls of her tunnel. This soon brought Katie to the edge and she let out a cry as she cummed. Mike let out his own cry as his seed rocketed up his penis and deep into Katie. Right after the peak, Katie laid down on top of her husband, her bare breasts pressing his muscular chest. This was certainly a better workout than just jogging. She cupped Mike&#39;s chin before kissing him. She definitely picked the right boy to make into her man.</p>
