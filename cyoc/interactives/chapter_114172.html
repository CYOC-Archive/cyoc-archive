<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Max had learned to more or less accept his situation over the last few days. Not that he at all liked it, but the shock was wearing off. They had him stay another few days after he got off his medication, just in case of adverse effects. The only effects Max could feel were boardroom and hornyness, though that might not have anything to do with the drugs. But it was a problem for him.<br />
<br />
Even if he had been able to speak, Max wasn&#39;t sure how he would be able to ask for a hand job. Not to be a pervert, but reaching his own dick was simply something he wasn&#39;t really any good at without hands anymore. When he used both his front stumps, he could sometimes catch the tip of his penis between them, but masterbating was another question all together. So he lay there, day by day, getting hornyer and hornyer and unable to say anything about it.<br />
<br />
They did wash him once every morning, but a hand-job was not forthcoming. And there wasn&#39;t really anything for him to hump. The sheets were thin and the pillow was small. The teddybear might be a good humping partner at this stage in Max&#39;s desperation, but it had been placed on a table separate from his bed together with the overly optimistic cards that read, “Get well soon.” Max was getting slight progress in his daily practice of managing to blow himself, but so far, it hadn&#39;t worked.<br />
<br />
One family member would turn up for a while every day to keep Max company and tell him about all the things he&#39;d missed while he was unconscious. They were all one way conversations. They had to be. <br />
<br />
Today it was Kenneth again. Max&#39;s little brother wasn&#39;t that much younger than him. They were actually rather similar in appearance. Kenneth had sat down by Max&#39;s bed and suddenly realized that Max had what seemed to be a large bulge in the sheets. Finally someone recognized the symptoms of blue balls. Being of similar age made Kenneth&#39;s mind jump straight to such questions.<br />
<br />
“How do you... you know... when you&#39;re like that?” Kenneth asked eventually. Max answered by shaking his head. “You mean, you haven&#39;t...” Kenneth looked around the room as if anyone else were close enough to hear them. It wasn&#39;t a private ward.<br />
<br />
“You haven&#39;t cum since the crash?” he whispered. Another shake of the head. “Is it frustrating?” Kenneth asked, his eyes staring at the humiliating bulge. Max answered with a pitiful whine, which conveyed very well how he felt.<br />
<br />
Kenneth licked his lips nervously, then checked the room again. He leaned in closer, whispering almost directly into Max&#39;s ear, so it tickled. Breathy. Excited. Poorly hiding his eagerness.<br />
<br />
“You know, I could... If you want... I could maybe help you with that...” Max looked into his little brother&#39;s large eyes. He felt his own heart racing and his blush increasing. Then, mutely, he nodded. “One moment,” Kenneth said, drawing the curtains around the bed. It wasn&#39;t much of a barrier to the other patients and visitors and nurses, but it was something.<br />
<br />
Kenneth pulled back the sheets, exposing Max&#39;s naked body. He didn&#39;t have to have him completely naked, Max thought. It would be enough if Kenneth could just rub him a little through the shirts. Or even lay him atop of the teddybear to hump it himself. But he wasn&#39;t able to say it and feared that any attempt might make his brother think he&#39;d chickened out. Truth was, he was desperately in need of an orgasm.<br />
<br />
Kenneth&#39;s hands were surprisingly soft. And he held his big brother&#39;s dick very tenderly in his hands. Moving very gently and hardly gripping at all. Max arched his back in frustration. Kenneth had to hold it properly if he was going to cum at all. Still, Kenneth just softly stroked it. Edging his helpless big brother closer and closer, but never quite there. He was so close. Max couldn&#39;t help it. He began to white.<br />
<br />
Kenneth pulled his hand back at the sound, looking around within the curtain fearfully, as he they&#39;d been discovered. Max wanted to scream at him to get him off already. His balls hurt with the need. And by the looks of it, Kenneth was getting pretty turned on himself. And boulder, it seemed.<br />
<br />
“You know,” he said, licking his lips. “It&#39;s kind of unfair, don&#39;t you think? You ruin the family car and have me jerk you off?” Max wanted to shout that this had been Kenneth&#39;s suggestion, but all he could do was whine in a begging way.<br />
<br />
“I think that if you want me to make you cum, you should first make me cum, right?” Where did that come from? Kenneth still had his hands. He could do it himself. Max shook his head. Kenneth smiled sweetly, running a finger in circles around the head of Max&#39;s cock.<br />
<br />
“But I thought you wanted to cum?” Max was way too sensitive at the tip. He gritted his teeth and fought not to cry out with desperate moans for everyone to hear. There was no way to negotiate back. This was a purely one way conversation. And Kenneth had all the leverage. Max nodded, half out of his mind with lust.<br />
<br />
Kenneth beamed, pulling his pants down and crawling up into his brother&#39;s bed. His cock was nearly as hard as Max&#39;s, and he placed it right in front of Max, startling him. Grimacing at how wrong this all was, Max reached out the stumps of his arms, catching the cock between them and masterbating it. But after only a few seconds, Kenneth frowned and said,<br />
<br />
“This isn&#39;t much of a hand job.” He stroked Max&#39;s penis just a bit too gently behind him the entire time, keeping Max on the edge. “You&#39;re going to have to do better than that, or I&#39;m leaving.” It was obvious what he wanted, but Max still couldn&#39;t believe that Kenneth had even wanted him to jerk him off, much less blow him.<br />
<br />
Max glared up at his brother who was still playfully stroking him. They both knew that Max had no choice. Clenching his eyes in disgust, Max gaped wide and felt his little brother&#39;s penis push into his wet mouth. “Come on then. Work for it,” Kenneth whispered, breathy. Reluctantly, Max began to suck.</p>
