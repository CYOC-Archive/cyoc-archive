<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Next morning Mike woke early and took a moment to reflect on the situation she was in. She was a girl, wearing a lavender nightie and was expected to perform at a cheerleading competition. At least for the moment she had a bit of privacy and explored the way her breasts filled out the bodice of the nightie. She was intrigued by the way her nipples expanded when she touched them through the patch of lace at the top of the nightie.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately she couldn&#39;t stay in bed as her bladder was bursting. At least this time she didn&#39;t try to pee standing up. She had by now urinated in this body often enough to know that she had no choice now but to sit.<br />
<br />
Sharon was up by the time Mike had done her business and suggested Mike, or &quot;Michelle&quot; as Sharon now called her, get in first and have her shower before Mary got up. Mike had spent enough time over the years to know that once Mary was in the bathroom she was very hard to remove, so she eagerly took up Sharon&#39;s offer.<br />
<br />
At least in the shower she had an opportunity to further explore her body. By now she knew exactly how to touch herself to feel a sexual thrill. It was only after she heard Mary repeatedly knocking and telling her to hurry up that Mike quickly washed her hair (Amazed how much shampoo was needed to lather up) and get on with the process of cleaning herself.<br />
<br />
She emerged to find a pissed off Mary and Sharon with another new outfit, a yellow floral sundress, that &quot;Michelle&quot; was instructed to wear to breakfast. Mike put on the dress without complaint. The dress was relatively tame compared to the outfit she had worn last night and she now only had a bit over 8 hours before this stupid competition was over and she could become her old male self once more.<br />
<br />
Mike was thankful that Tom was not at breakfast. They sat at a table with Tracey and Mina and were shortly joined by Mrs Maloney. &quot;Coach&quot; once again praised &quot;Michelle&quot; for how well she had done yesterday, even suggesting Michelle should consider joining the team full time. That made Mike feel like chucking up the small tub of yoghurt, which was all that Sharon had allowed her to eat. At least &quot;Coach&quot; didn&#39;t push the matter when Mike told her that &#39;I&#39;m planning on trying out for the basketball team, so I wouldn&#39;t have time for both&#39;<br />
<br />
They had a couple of hours between breakfast and when the competition resumed at 11. Sharon and Mary wanted to spend some of that time by the pool and suggested &quot;Michelle&quot; join them. She declined. Mike spent that time in the room watching the TV. <br />
<br />
The swimmers returned at 9.30 and Sharon instructed Mike to get into her uniform. Sharon helped &quot;Michelle&quot; with her hair and make-up and soon she was ready. They then had to clean up the room so they could check out. Mike didn&#39;t take long to clean up. Her suitcase in which she had packed her male clothes had not been touched. Sharon found room in her own bags for &quot;Michelle&#39;s&quot; clothes.<br />
<br />
So by 10.50 the three of them were back at the auditorium where Sharon left the girls in care of Mrs Maloney, and went off to find Tess who she had clicked with. She was new in town and was thankful for the opportunity this carnival had given her to make new friends. <br />
<br />
Mike spent the rest of the day in autopilot. She was good at learning cheers and seemed to have an innate ability to be able to replicate moves after seeing them just once. She was also now aware that she had not just inherited Mary&#39;s looks. She also had Mary&#39;s fitness and flexibility.<br />
<br />
They didn&#39;t win but the third placing the team achieved was the best the school had ever done. When their placing was announced Mike found herself being hugged by all her teammates. They were genuinely happy and mood was somewhat contagious. Mike found she was smiling and giggling with the other girls. She was proud that she had not let the team down. She was also smiling as her ordeal was now at an end and as soon as they were out of this place she could become Mike again.<br />
<br />
The reunited with the mothers which involved another round of hugs and kisses. Someone suggested they all meet up for dinner at a town halfway home. They had a 5 hour journey in front of them. Sharon accepted the invitation but &quot;Michelle&quot; pointed out &#39;Mom, we can&#39;t. Remember we promised we would see uncle Mike on the way home. He will be very disappointed if we don&#39;t show&#39;<br />
<br />
Fortunately Sharon got the hint and they said goodbye to everyone.<br />
<br />
Back at the car Mike demanded Sharon fulfill her promise and give Mike the medallion straight away so that he could change back.<br />
<br />
&#39;You can&#39;t change here. Some of the others might see us. Get in the car and we will stop at a rest stop somewhere on the way&#39;<br />
<br />
Reluctantly Mike obeyed. She could see Mom&#39;s logic and she certainly didn&#39;t want her secret to be discovered.<br />
<br />
Two hours down the road. They pulled over at a roadside toilet block. Sharon produced the medallion and Mike unpacked her suitcase and found some undies she had not worn since she had been feminized. However as Sharon handed the medallion to Mike they both felt a zap. To Mike&#39;s horror she found herself changing - not back to her own male body. Instead she was aging. Within 5 minutes it was clear what had happened. Mike was becoming a 36 year old woman. She was becoming Sharon.<br />
<br />
Sharon was changing as well. She was becoming a copy of her daughter&#39;s. She was becoming &quot;Michelle&quot;. They had done a body swap.</p>
