<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After a refreshing shower and night of sleep, Jennifer prepared little Tony and Emmy to go out to the &quot;All Ages and Stages Family Restaurant&quot;. She shaved a few years off of herself to add a bit of pep to her step, coming down to a respectable 34, matching the amount of time that Tony and Emmy had dropped when they&#39;d regressed from 10 to 2 yesterday. While pushing the envelope of being their mother/grandmother at 42 was somewhat thrilling, Jennifer didn&#39;t like the laugh lines or eye wrinkles that came with her forties. While they still somewhat existed at 34, they were far less noticeable and more fine than they had been when she&#39;d woken up. Despite losing the eight years of age, Jennifer still managed to keep her bodily signs of being a mother to her twins.<br />
<br />
The waiter immediately escorted them to a booth where Tony and Emmy found crayons and placemats to entertain themselves with while Jennifer was left to order. She had just placed the order when she heard someone call her name out from across the restaurant. Jennifer turned to see a an ashy blond man with a respectable Dad bod build, probably about 36 or 37 walking straight towards her with a sullen little boy who looked much like himself in miniature and about the age of four or five following as quickly as he could in tow. It took Jennifer a moment of looking at the boy and thinking she recognized him from somewhere before she remembered, and called out, &quot;Trey? Trey Parker?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;One and the same,&quot; replied the man, which took Jennifer a quick moment to adjust looking to.<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you doing here?&quot; asked Jennifer, sliding over to make room for him to join her, and encouraging Tony and Emmy to make room for the boy accompanying him, which Jennifer now assumed was Trey&#39;s overly serious and stern father, James.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, my Dad heard from your parents that this was a great resort to relax and take your mind off of things. We got into the room and switched roles and little Jimmy over here suddenly was starving,&quot; said Trey.<br />
<br />
&quot;I was just a bit peckish,&quot; retorted Jimmy.<br />
<br />
&quot;He still has his adult mind then?&quot; asked Jennifer.<br />
<br />
&quot;He can lose it?&quot; questioned Trey. To which Jennifer gestured to Tony and Emmy who were in all respects acting completely like the two year olds they were in that moment as Tony tried putting a crayon up his nose, and Emmy was getting upset that a crayon had broken in her hand.<br />
<br />
Immediately Jennifer scolded Tony for trying to put the crayon up his nose, while Trey actually jumped in and calmed Emmy a bit assuring her that now she had two crayons instead of one--and wasn&#39;t that a good thing. Jennifer watched Trey smoothly calm Emmy and suddenly that warm and wet feeling she&#39;d felt the other day returned.<br />
<br />
Jimmy meanwhile had stared in horror at how Tony and Emmy had acted and sat quietly as he plotted his escape from this awkward situation, ignoring how Jennifer was pointing out something on the menu for Trey to order.<br />
<br />
Later, the waiter returned with drinks, including a smoothie for Jimmy that Jennifer had suggested Trey order for him, all while Jennifer and Trey sipped on lemon water, and the twins on tippy cups of milk.<br />
<br />
&quot;Go on, drink up, it&#39;s not every day we get something special like this, sport,&quot; jibed Trey in a father-like manner that James would have never done to the boy. It was just too embarrassing to pretend to be that jovial all the time.<br />
<br />
Trey watched as Jimmy tentatively stuck a straw into the chocolate smoothie and sipped. It soon became apparent at the rate the boy was sipping that he found it delicious, and the more delicious he found it the faster he sipped, and the faster he sipped, the bigger the grin on his face appeared, and the bigger the grin on his face appeared, the more silly his demeanor became until the smoothie was all gone and so was the sullen attitude which Jimmy had entered the restaurant with as the boy of four or five years old now was acting like a little boy of four or five should act--kicking his dangling feet against the booth, joining the twins in coloring--in fact helping Emmy with her coloring like a big brother might.<br />
<br />
&quot;Look at the three of them, getting along so well,&quot; commented Jennifer.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;d be a shame to separate them,&quot; added Trey.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, you know, you two can come to our room tonight... for a playdate,&quot; said Jennifer.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure, a play date. Jimmy can play at being big brother, that might be good for him. Make him a better Dad when he grows up again.&quot;<br />
<br />
And so after the meal was finished, Jennifer and Trey had their bills put on their rooms&#39; respective tabs, and ushered the young children back to Jennifer&#39;s room. There she found the twins in need of changing, and excused herself as she scooped each of them up.<br />
<br />
Curious as to how well the Youthie Smoothie had worked, Trey called Jimmy over and the boy eagerly jumped into Trey&#39;s lap and cuddled up against Trey like an over affectionate puppy might.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Daddy?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you like playing with Emmy and Tony?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Kinda... but...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But what?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But but!&quot; giggled Jimmy.<br />
<br />
&quot;But what?&quot; implored Trey.<br />
<br />
&quot;But they&#39;re babies... stuck in diapers, and I&#39;m a big boy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Trey deciding to test out if the Youthie was still in effect, said, &quot;Yes, you&#39;re a big boy, but you still have accidents from time to time, don&#39;t you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nuh huh!&quot; protested Jimmy, but Trey could feel the boy starting to shrink a little in his lap, some more baby fat appearing on Jimmy&#39;s limbs and belly as he crossed the line back into toddlerhood.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah huh, Jimmy. Enough that we can&#39;t quite get you out of Pull Ups, just yet,&quot; said Trey, and it was with that said that Trey felt Jimmy&#39;s underwear and shorts merge, thicken and stiffen up slightly, transforming into pull ups, and Trey&#39;s age now was most certainly settling in on 3 years old. He now was wearing just a t-shirt and pull ups--his socks and shoes disappearing.<br />
<br />
&quot;So you may be a big boy who doesn&#39;t wear diapers, but you&#39;re still my liddle boy,&quot; said Trey as he scooped the toddler up under each armpit, and brought him closer to his face so that they could rub noses--causing Jimmy to giggle and squirm before Trey eased him back down onto his shoulder and eased the boy with a few gentle strokes to his back, which lulled the now tired out toddler to sleep.<br />
<br />
&quot;Trey, can you come and help me?&quot; called Jennifer from the bathroom. Trey put his sleeping son down on a bed and quietly joined Jennifer in the bathroom, expecting to have to hold one of the twins for Jennifer, only to find no sign of the babies at the change station, but instead when he turned around he saw Jennifer, on the ground, and looking over several months pregnant with a huge belly.<br />
<br />
&quot;What happened,&quot; asked Trey as he helped Jennifer up to her feet.<br />
<br />
&quot;I was enjoying letting the twins breastfeed when the next thing I know they&#39;re newborns and suddenly I&#39;m pregnant with them,&quot; said Jennifer in a rushed tone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can you make them younger so you can get around?&quot; asked Trey, and Jennifer thought for a moment and her belly shrank like an ice cube on a hot sunlit patio. When she looked fairly normal suddenly she seemed to shiver and opened her eyes and looked at Trey in a manner he had never seen a woman look at him before, and yet some instinct down deep inside told him that this wasn&#39;t a look to deny what was asked of him, especially with the strange feeling he was feeling down between his legs for the first time.<br />
<br />
Rather quickly clothes were flying off of Jennifer and Trey as they kissed and pushed each other into the steaming shower. Trey obeyed Jennifer&#39;s commands and even felt the instinct drive him to experiment with a few moves, but soon they both climaxed and Trey felt something sucked back into his body--his sac growing heavy and the hard feeling not yet diminishing between his legs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh... shit...&quot; said Jennifer.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; asked Trey.<br />
<br />
&quot;Congratulations Trey... you&#39;re their father now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?!&quot; asked Trey.<br />
<br />
&quot;The twins... you&#39;re their father now,&quot; said Jennifer.<br />
<br />
And Trey suddenly realized the implications of what had just happened.<br />
<br />
&quot;How young are--&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They&#39;re back before conception... which means their eggs are tucked away in my ovaries while the other half of them got sucked back into your... sac,&quot; said Jennifer as she gently lifted his full sac which ached to be unloaded.<br />
<br />
&quot;C-careful Jen... I&#39;m almost ready to blow... we don&#39;t want half the twins to go right down the drain, now do we?&quot; asked Trey nervously.<br />
<br />
&quot;No... we don&#39;t... ready for round two?&quot;<br />
<br />
Trey responded with a kiss and eagerly inserted himself into her awaiting hole. Trey did not come out until he felt a release of all the pressure from his sac and boner. And even then, he remained inside of Jen for a few moments after just to be sure all of what he&#39;d sucked up was put back in.<br />
<br />
A few moments later, Trey noticed that Jennifer had grown her belly slightly, showing that she was once again pregnant, but only slightly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now that... was fun,&quot; said Jennifer.</p>
