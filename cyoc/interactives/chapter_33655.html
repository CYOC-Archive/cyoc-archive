<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As you lie there in the hall curled up you hear a knock at the door.<br />
<br />
You pretend you aren't home but there's a second knock and a familiar 'Hello', you're not sure why it's familiar, but it is.<br />
<br />
You continue to pretend you are not at home until you hear the door handle jiggle.  Two thoughts flash through your head, &quot;Did I lock the door?&quot; and &quot;Oh, now I recognize the voice!&quot;  These thoughts are quickly banished as you realize in that split second that the door is indeed opening.<br />
<br />
You scramble to your feet and cover your genitals (or as much of them as you can cover) just in time to see the delivery guy walk through.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my!&quot;  He exclaims.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wha...what are you doing!&quot;  You rumble in a deeper than you've ever heard from your own throat voice. <br />
<br />
&quot;What am I doing?  I'm delivering another package.&quot;  The guy says holding up a small brown box.<br />
<br />
&quot;Couldn't you have left it on the front step?&quot; You say irritably.<br />
<br />
He looks at your hardening cock and this makes you realize that you are getting hard... getting hard in front of this complete stranger... and it's turning you on!<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I could have left it on the step, but it might have gotten stolen and we wouldn't want that would we?&quot;  He says knowingly.<br />
<br />
He takes a couple of steps toward you, placing the package on the mail table in the hall.  He bends and retrieves the cologne from the box, unbuttoning the front of his shirt to just below his nipples as he does so.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wouldn't...&quot; You start to say but he unscrews the cap and looks you straight in the eye as he waves it under his nose.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mmmmmm...&quot;  He says, &quot;A bit strong yes, but it has to be to work and with the right body chemistry, it mellows.  I think you'll like it if you wear it.&quot;  He splashes some on his hands, sets the now capped bottle down on the floor and rubs his hands vigorously together; patting his cheeks, neck and rubbing it on his chest.  <br />
<br />
It's really a very nice scent... woodsy...&quot;  he stares at you hungrily, &quot;Masculine...&quot;  he takes a step toward you and you want to retreat, but you don't.  &quot;Musky...&quot;  You're frozen in place and your cock is throbbing; oozing precome. &quot;Ursine.&quot;  He finishes as he begins to embrace you.  <br />
<br />
He wraps his arms around you with arms that a few minutes ago were fairly hairless.  Now, they're coated with a soft layer of downy hair.  His face is similarly coated, but not twenty minutes ago when he delivered the box he was cleanly shaved.<br />
<br />
He pulls you into his warm embrace and buries your nose in his neck.  You try to break the embrace, but the smell of the cologne IS so nice, so woodsy, masculine, musky... ursine.  You breathe in the scent deeply and you feel your body change further.  You close your eyes, dizzy from the heady scent, and you feel like you are growing taller.  You're arms and legs feel like they're expanding with muscle and you can feel the delivery guy kissing your bare chest, rubbing his new beard through your thick chest hair, cupping your balls in his warm hand.<br />
<br />
It feels so good, so right.  You open your eyes to find your are looking down into his as he licks your left nipple.  Your body shivers with pleasure.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ooooh...&quot; You moan huskily.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes...&quot;  He says in a voice a bit deeper than it was when he walked in on you naked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I've watched you for some time, admiring you, thinking just how wonderful it would be if you were bigger, hairier, more masculine than most any man...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You did this?&quot;  You say, confusing thoughts of anger and lust all overlaid with a sort of strange eager happiness at this man's touch.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, I did.  For us both.  You're a lonely man.  I've seen how one woman after another dumped you.  At first I felt sorry, then, I felt glad because it meant you weren't right for them.  You were rejected because you weren't a good fit, but I think now you know deep down that we are right for each other, don't you?  You were meant to be with another man, just as I was.&quot;<br />
<br />
You nod dumbly in agreement, but not knowing why.<br />
<br />
&quot;I would never dump you, not someone as lonely as I am.  Not someone as nice, as kind as you.  I never thought I could find anyone who would want me, but you... you want me don't you?&quot;<br />
<br />
You take a deep breath, you want to voice an objection.  You want to be gentle and not hurt his feelings.  You want to tell him you aren't interested in men, but his scent, not just the cologne but you realize the scent of his body; the sweat from delivering packages all morning, is VERY arousing and more... it makes you want to hold him, protect him, kiss...<br />
<br />
And before you can finish that thought you ARE kissing him.  Your tongue is deep in his mouth, playing with his tongue.  Your beard is rubbing into his now full beard, meshing, tickling.  You break the kiss and look into his face seeing that this man IS completely devoted to you.  This man would live with you for the rest of his life and that touches you deeply.  No one has EVER looked at you with such love and loyalty.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, you wanted a bear, so you just made me into one?&quot;  You say.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, with the help of Arctos, yes.  I gave over half of my holdings in stocks and bonds over for the items in those boxes.  I had to start working again; delivery as you know.  I've lived on beans and rice, sold my luxury car for a dinky Yotota, moved from a great apartment to the not so great place I live in now and riding my bike to save gas money... all so I could buy those things... but it was all worth it... and I'd do it a thousand times over if I had to.  I love you, and maybe in a short time you'll love me too.&quot;<br />
<br />
You are conflicted still.  You want him, you want to take him NOW, but at the same time this is all so very quick and so... strange.  You look over at the package on the hall mail table, &quot;What's in the box?&quot; you rumble.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, that!&quot;  He says moving to the table.  You notice that he fills his uniform very well now and you catch yourself absentmindedly rubbing your cock as you look at his rounder, bigger ass.<br />
<br />
He opens the box and removes the contents and shows them to you one by one.  It's a leather harness, pouch and leather gag.  It's gear like the what you received earlier, minus the gag.  There's also a plain black leather ball cap which he tosses to you.  Without thinking you put it on, brim backward and it feels so natural to you to wear it.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's all I could afford for myself and of course I had to get you the cap.&quot;  He says without a tinge of regret in his voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, do you want me to model this for you?&quot;  he says hopefully.<br />
<br />
You decide that...</p>
