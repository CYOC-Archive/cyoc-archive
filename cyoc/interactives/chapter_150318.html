<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jennifer dislodged herself from her seat as best she could.  First, she lifted the bulbous, jiggling mass to rest it on top of her desk.  Second, she slowly rotated herself out of the seat, making sure to keep the sloshing growth on the desk at all times.  Finally, she slid both hands beneath the thing, and dragged herself away from the desk.<br />
<br />
Jen had sorely miscalculated how much she could lift with her arms, as the udder immediately shoved itself downward and taking the lion&#39;s share of the space between her legs.  All four teats waggled in the open air, with two pointed in front of her and two visible from behind.  Gravity pulled the mass into an oblong shape, causing it to dangle far enough to touch even her knees.  Jen was practically squatting to give her udder enough space, but she was standing.  She carefully closed the gap until she felt less like she was riding a horse, and more like she was holding a bowling ball using only her thighs.  She took a few waddling steps, but they were so tiny they barely moved her a foot.<br />
<br />
As she practiced more, and grew more frustrated, eventually Jen figured out that she could take large, striding steps as long as she could swing her legs around the udder.  Unlike a bowling ball, this was fused to her.  The sloshing and jiggling sensations felt ten times worse than when she didn&#39;t wear a bra and she could barely control turning or stopping, but it was better than waddling at a snail&#39;s pace.  She refused to think about how ridiculous her walk looked, but tried to refine it as she moved toward the bus stop.  <br />
<br />
Using one hand to keep her pants up, she swaggered her way through the halls, this time using the space the other students gave to avoid getting near her.  After a few minutes of walking like this, she started to go back to the waddle.  Even for a cheerleader, it was a tiring amount of effort to keep up.  <br />
<br />
Before she rounded another corner, a familiar voice called out to her.  &quot;Hey, Jen!&quot;<br />
<br />
It immediately filled her with rage.  She stopped, turned around, and glared at the punk that had done this to her.  She leaned against a nearby wall to wait for him to get close enough so she didn&#39;t shout.  &quot;Fuck you, Kyle.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kyle only smiled.  &quot;As if I&#39;d care what some dumb cow has to say.  Fur, udders, and...Hooves!  Looks like a grim future for you, cow-girl!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There, you saw what happened.  Now, get out of my face.&quot;<br />
<br />
He wagged his finger in her face, only to pull it back once she grabbed for it.  &quot;Ah-ah!  I&#39;ve got so much to ask!  First one: how &#39;full do you feel?  That honkin&#39; thing is-hey!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen had started back up with walking to the bus stop.  She didn&#39;t need to deal with this gloating piece of human refuse.  Unfortunately, her unwieldy body made it very easy for Kyle to keep up, and even talk to her while moving backwards.  &quot;Take a hint, you dumbass.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kyle seemed unperturbed.  &quot;So, can I feel it?  Looks awful heavy.  Maybe you&#39;ll need that sucker milked twice a day, like a real dairy cow!&quot;<br />
<br />
She stopped once more.  She had to get back at him, and he still seemed stupid enough to fall for things.  &quot;You know what, Kyle?  If you promise to leave me alone, I&#39;ll let you not only touch it, but I&#39;ll even let you in on a secret about it.  But first...&quot;  Jennifer looked at the other students, who seemed to be actively avoiding eye contact with her.  &quot;...We need to go somewhere a bit more private.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kyle gave an enthusiastic nod, and followed her to an area behind the library.  There was a cement path surrounding the entirety of the library, but it went nowhere and there was always a more efficient way to get anywhere else, making it perfect.  As soon as they rounded the corner, Kyle took the initiative and pressed his clammy, cold hand into her udder.  Not only did it feel violating, but it was like he&#39;d punched her in the boobs deeper than any fall or asshole had done with her normal breasts.  Even he seemed to notice he went too deep, and pulled his hand far enough out that it was no longer submerged in her udder.  &quot;Woah, it feels so weird.  And full of milk!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jennifer gave him a glaring nod.  &quot;Yeah, it&#39;s pretty much a regular fucking cow udder, you sheltered boy.  All except for one difference.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kyle&#39;s ears perked up.  &quot;And what difference is that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s the secret.  You&#39;ll have to take a very close look at the teat to see it.&quot;  He got to his knees, looking dangerously close at the udder&#39;s teat.  &quot;You see, there&#39;s no way for the milk to get out.&quot;  She slowly took the second teat while he was focused on the first.  &quot;There&#39;s just no hole for the milk, meaning this thing is always going to be at least this big.&quot;<br />
<br />
Using her years of farm experience, Jen expertly prepared milk in the second teat while Kyle was studying the first.  He started to pick at the tip, which Jen exclaimed surprise and pulled away.  As she did, she rotated the &#39;armed&#39; teat and sprayed a long streak of milk into Kyle&#39;s mouth, nose, and eye.<br />
<br />
Kyle began sputtering and wiping his face.  &quot;What the fuck?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;God, you&#39;re such a dumbass.  You made the fucking virus with magic that obeyed your every word, and yet you thought it made something wrong?  Also, why did you stick your face right in front of it?  What a loser.&quot;<br />
<br />
Red-faced, Kyle muttered something and stalked off.  Jen could only pray he caught the virus from that.  If there was one person in the world that deserved it, that would be Kyle.<br />
<br />
The buf ride was far less eventful that Jennifer had initially thought.  The bus driver barely reacted to her massively-deformed body, and the bus seats were far enough apart that it didn&#39;t press her newest mammary like what had happened with the desk.  The other students avoided her like the plague, so she didn&#39;t have to worry about sharing the seat.  She&#39;d actually sat sideways so she could rest the udder on something, rather than let it continue to pull down.<br />
<br />
Of course, she had no idea what her parents would do when she got home.</p>
