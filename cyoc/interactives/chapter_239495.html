<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After a little longer, things eventually slowed down as everyone realized that they were starting to get hungry after the marathon of sex.  Although you were going to be fine because only one body needed to eat, the same couldn&#39;t be said for the rest of your housemates.  Furthermore, until one of you ate, all of yourselves would feel famished.  As you pondered how best you might be able to mitigate these issues with the app, one of Mona&#39;s torsos conjoined to you mentioned offhand, &quot;Good, she should be getting here in a little while.&quot;<br />
<br />
Distracted from your ruminations, you queried, &quot;Oh? Who did you invite?&quot;<br />
<br />
Speaking with a different head, the succubus explained, &quot;My wife, Teri.  I figured it would be a shame if she missed out on all the fun we&#39;re having here.&quot;  Winking with a few faces, she added, &quot;And we could have some fun with her too, if you know what I mean.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That could be interesting indeed,&quot; you agreed while nodding in triplicate before asking, &quot;How did you tell her to come though?  I didn&#39;t see you pull out your cellphone or anything.&quot;<br />
<br />
Letting out a chorus of overlapping giggles, she answered, &quot;I told you guys earlier, I already merged with her long ago, remember?  All I had to do was ask her with one of my mouths attached to her.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, that make sense,&quot; you agreed, pondering the implications of how limitless the range of her mental link appeared to be.  Turning your attention back to the phone, you targeted Mary, who was currently working with her numerous clones to start cooking in several of the kitchens near the front portion of the infinite house.  Generating a sentence about her, you got the following:<br />
<br />
&quot;This mitotic scylla is thinking about how much food she needs to prepare for all the multi-bodied people in the house.&quot;<br />
<br />
It was pretty easy to decide what you wanted to change, and you swapped out &quot;much&quot; for &quot;little&quot;, hoping that it would ease her burden going forward.  Witnessing reality bend, you noticed that there were now only nine clones of Mary cooking across three kitchens.  Additionally, it seemed that only a few copies of each resident had gathered to wait for the food, split across a few dining rooms because Julie and Erika&#39;s bodies were both very long, making it awkward to seat so many people in the same room comfortably.  Regardless, you were satisfied with the results and went with your bodymate to join in the conversations leading up to lunch.<br />
<br />
Not long after you finished eating, the front doorbell rang.  Turning your head to look at your succubus companion, the lavender-skinned parasite nodded and confirmed that it was her wife outside.  Walking to the door with Mona&#39;s real body and one of the Marys, you all greeted the four-armed, shortstacked hermaphrodite.  While you all exchanged pleasantries with the succubus&#39; wife, you took note of how Teri&#39;s body had been transformed by the merge with Mona.  Previously, she had four arms and a single large cock, with nothing else of note besides her ultra-curvy, four-foot tall body.  However, it appeared that she now had a rather unpredictable merge with her parasitic wife.  Beneath her original two pairs of arms, a third pair with lavender skin skin had grown in, and two purple pairs of breasts had grown in under Teri&#39;s own, slightly larger pair.  While that didn&#39;t seem that strange so far, it was the two extra heads that puzzled you.  Like with Mary, the shortstack had gained a copy of Mona&#39;s head on either side of her own, except neither of them had mouths, the area beneath their noses being completely smooth instead.<br />
<br />
&quot;I thought Mona said she asked her wife to come using her mouths on Teri&#39;s body...&quot; You mentally questioned at the sight of her mouthless heads.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wondering where my mouths are?&quot; Six copies of Mona&#39;s voice said in sync, seemingly coming from Teri&#39;s body in response to your visible confusion.  Raising the bottom pair of arms that she controlled, the succubus showed you her palms, and then her wife followed suit and raised the other four arms.  On each palm, there was a purple-tinted mouth, one of which said, &quot;Believe me, we were surprised at first, too.&quot;  Finishing with a different palm-mouth, she added, &quot;We definitely weren&#39;t complaining after we realized just what we could do with them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Honey!&quot; Teri exclaimed while blushing profusely, her dick getting hard along with the nine, lavender-colored prehensile cocks next to it.  Looking over the rest of her body, you saw that the pair of wings she got in the merge were much smaller and cuter than her wife&#39;s, and she had two spade-tipped tails instead of one.  Additionally, she had three pussies in her crotch underneath her crowd of penises.<br />
<br />
Chuckling deeply, Mona apologized insincerely, &quot;I&#39;m sorry, dear, you know I just can&#39;t help but tease you with how cute you get when flustered.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know, but there is a time and a place,&quot; Teri replied with a small pout.<br />
<br />
Smirking, you interjected, &quot;Oh, this place is definitely fine.&quot;<br />
<br />
Picking up on what you were insinuating, Mary offered, &quot;It&#39;s just up to you whether it&#39;s the time for it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Caught off guard, the shortstack looked at you, then at Mary, and then finally at her wife before raising an eyebrow.  In response, Mona just gave a wink.  Taking a deep sigh, Teri calmly remarked, &quot;Now I see why you asked me to come down here, though I kind of had a feeling to begin with.&quot;  Clearly, this wasn&#39;t the first time that her sex-demoness spouse dragged her into extra-marital affairs.  &quot;Well, mind if I rest a bit after the drive before we take things to the bedroom?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course not,&quot; Mary replied warmly, &quot;Here, follow me to the dining room and I&#39;ll get you something to drink.  Hungry, by any chance?  We just finished lunch and have some food left over.&quot;  Gratefully accepting the offer, the short hermaphrodite followed the scylla and got introduced to the rest of the house&#39;s colorful inhabitants.<br />
<br />
About an hour later, of course, everyone&#39;s attention once more returned to sex thanks to the superhuman amount of hormones coursing through their much-transformed bodies.  At Mona&#39;s urging, you prompted the app for a sentence about Teri.<br />
<br />
&quot;The shortstack wife is bashfully covering her breasts while she finishes undressing.&quot;<br />
<br />
Feeling it was only right for the succubus to make the first change since it was her wife after all, you showed her the screen to ask for input.  Tapping her chins, your conjoined partner thought for a minute before saying, &quot;This is going to sound kinky, but I&#39;ve got an idea... Change &#39;covering&#39; to &#39;detaching&#39;, please.&quot;<br />
<br />
Smirking, you responded, &quot;Kinky indeed, but I&#39;m interested to see how it works.&quot;  Entering in the edit and confirming it, you witnessed as Teri grasped her top pair of breasts and tugged on them, causing the two soft orbs of flesh to separate from her torso and leave behind smooth skin.  However, the malleable mounds of titflesh were far too large to be easily held with just one hand, and she quickly fumbled her balance as they spilled out and landed on the floor.  At the moment of impact, you noticed her bite her lip from the pleasure she felt due to the unexpected stimulation.  Lending a helping tentacle, Mary wrapped her rubbery appendages around the runaway breasts and lifted them with intent to give them back, unintentionally adding to Teri&#39;s pleasure.<br />
<br />
In the other room, Mona asked, &quot;Hey, can we make another change?&quot;  Obliging, you saw a new statement in the app.<br />
<br />
&quot;The embarrassed shortstack is holding back a moan as she accepts her detached breasts.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ooh, I have the perfect idea,&quot; the succubus eagerly stated, &quot;How about we put &#39;regrows&#39; instead of &#39;accepts&#39;?  Then she&#39;ll have a way to multiply like the rest of us.&quot;<br />
<br />
Fully on board with the idea, you followed her idea and hit confirm.  After reality bent once more, you witnessed as the multilimbed hermaphrodite shut her eyes tightly while covering her mouth and trying not to moan as the smooth area where her chest was started rapidly swelling out again.  As the twin mammaries grew back in place and reformed their nipples, Teri was helpless to keep all of her mouthpalms from voicing their ecstasy since they technically belonged to her wife.  Now that the shortstack&#39;s chest was back to normal, Mary was left wondering what to do with the detached breasts she was still holding in her tentacles, teasing their nipples with two more tentacle tips to see how the hermaphrodite would react.  Focusing the app on Mary, you let it make a new sentence.<br />
<br />
&quot;This scylla is considering where to set the short hermaphrodite&#39;s detached breasts.&quot;<br />
<br />
Wanting to take your own turn making a modification, you replaced &#39;set&#39; with &#39;attach&#39;, feeling confident that the program would interpret it a certain way you already had in mind.  Sure enough, the world changed subtly again, and after a few moments you witnessed the octopus-woman lifting the tits up to her torso before pressing them against the skin below her lower pair of breasts.  After about two seconds of contact, the flesh started to merge with her torso, and within moments it looked like she always had the third row of breasts, although they did look a little funny being so much larger that their neighbors above.  The skin tone even shifted subtly to match her own.  As Mary massaged the new mounds, she lustfully commented, &quot;Mmm, your nipples feel so sensitive...&quot;<br />
<br />
Blushing profusely, Teri replied, &quot;Y-yeah, t-tell me about it.  Please be gentle.&quot;<br />
<br />
Getting a devilish grin, Mona&#39;s real body asked, &quot;Dear, could you lend me your cock please?&quot;<br />
<br />
Gulping since she knew her wife would no doubt use it non-stop, the short woman tepidly acquiesced, pulling off her massive original penis and handing it to the demoness.  While Teri regrew her manhood, Mona attached it above her left crotch&#39;s pussies, watching with a smile as it turned lavender to match the rest of her body.  Not satisfied with just one, she asked for another, then another, and still more until she had five in each crotch.<br />
<br />
Mesmerized as you wondered what else could be possible with this new power Teri had, you...</p>
