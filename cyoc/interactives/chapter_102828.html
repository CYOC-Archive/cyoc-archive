<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mark quickly drank some of the Age(-), Height(-), and Female vials.  He wasn&#39;t sure how much he took, but he hoped it the combination was enough to make him look different enough that he would not be recognized.  He slipped the vials back into the box, and jumped into the bathroom, just as Jake entered his bedroom.<br />
<br />
Mark looked in the mirror, silently urging the changes to occur more quickly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mark?  Where are you?   C&#39;mon.  I don&#39;t have time for games.  We gotta go or we are going to be late,&quot; said Jake.<br />
<br />
Late?  Late for what? thought Mark.  Then he remembered that they were supposed to go to the game together tonight.  Jake had spent quite a bit on the tickets, and Mark felt a little bad.  But he was suddenly distracted by the changes overtaking his body.<br />
<br />
It felt much more powerful this time.  Mark wondered if it was because he had used three vials, and thought perhaps he had made a mistake.  His head tingled as his long blonde hair stretched even further down his back,  His hair became softer and seemed to shine a little.  His face became softer, with large puffy lips.  His whole face seemed to contract, as it got smaller and cuter.  His nose shrank to a button and his eyelashes grew longer.<br />
<br />
There is no way he would recognize me now, thought Mark happily.<br />
<br />
But the changes continued.  His waist seemed to contract, getting thinner and flatter, as his hips got a little wider.  Surprisingly, his breasts began to shrink to a modest B cup.  His whole body began to shrink, contracting in on itself.  His arms and legs got shorter, becoming thinner and daintier as they shrank.  His clothes now hung loosely on his body. <br />
<br />
The changes seemed to stop, and Mark saw a young teenage girl staring back at him in the mirror.  She looked vaguely related to him, but there was no way that Jake would ever think the young girl was him. He opened the bathroom door, startling Jake, who was sitting on the bed looking at his phone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, sorry.  Didn&#39;t know Mark had company.  And you are?&quot; asked Jake.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m Mary.  I&#39;m Mark&#39;s cousin,&quot; said Mark quickly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, Mary.  Pleased to meet you, &quot; said Jake, shaking her hand.  He looked at Mark strangely, and Mark realized that the large baggy male clothes must look odd on his small teenage body. &quot;Do you know where you cousin is hiding? I think he is playing some kind of game, but it&#39;s not funny.  We need to leave or we will be late.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Um, Mark&#39;s not here,&quot; said Mark.<br />
<br />
&quot;But I just heard him...&quot; began  Jake.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry, I am the only one here.  You must have heard me,&quot; said Mark.<br />
<br />
Jake sighed.  &quot;Fine.  If he wants to be that way, just tell him I left on my own.  But he still owes me for the ticket,&quot; said Jake.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait!  What ticket?&quot; said Mark.<br />
<br />
Jake explained how he and Mark were going to the big game.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, why don&#39;t you just take me, &quot; said Mark.  &quot;Might as well not waste the ticket.  And I am sure Mark will still pay you for it.  I am his cousin, after all.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jake looked Mark up and down.  &quot;I don&#39;t know.  You are a little young for me, &quot; said Jake.<br />
<br />
Mark put his hands on his hips.  &quot;Who said anything about a date?  We could just go as friends,&quot; said Mark.<br />
<br />
Jake still looked skeptical.  &quot;Look, kid.  These tickets cost a lot, and I really want to see the game.  Not babysit someone.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mark felt furious.  Babysit?  What the hell was Jake talking about?  He was younger, but he wasn&#39;t some little kid.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Now listen here, &quot; said Mark, as he stepped forward.  Jake stood up off the bed, and Mark finally realized how much taller Jake was than him now.  He had to crane his neck up to see Jake&#39;s face.  It made him feel a little dizzy.  The room seemed to swirl around him, growing and expanding.  He thought he was going to pass out, but when he felt his clothes getting baggier he realized that he was shrinking!<br />
<br />
Jake stared at him in shock.  Had he noticed that Mark just shrank?<br />
<br />
&quot;Um, excuse me.  I feel a little sick, &quot; said Mark, his voice cracking a bit.  He ran into the bathroom and slammed the door shut.  Looking in the mirror he saw that his age regressed further.  His breasts seemed smaller.  Lifting his baggy shirt he saw that his womanly curves had receded a little.  And of course he was shorter.  He now looked to be no more than 14.  Or was it 12?  It was hard to tell if he was still regressing or he was still shrinking from the Height (-) vial.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Everything okay in there?&quot; asked Jake outside.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, I&#39;m fine.  Just go to your game and leave me alone,&quot; said Mark.  His voice was shaky, much higher now.  He looked back in the mirror, and saw that he looked even smaller.  He had to stand on his toes to look in the mirror.  He had to get back to those vials, but they were still in the room with Jake.  He had to get him to leave.</p>
