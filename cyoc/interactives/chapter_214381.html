<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff was worried.<br />
<br />
The himbo polar bear butler was bleeding into his words and thoughts now. He truly didn’t know what he was anymore. Sometimes he’d recall having lovely, pliable fat, enjoying the soft flab and his nub of a cock getting off just by shaking his own belly. But Geoffrey found such acts… well, not gross. Just unacceptable.<br />
<br />
Which was why when Finn-err, Veles wandered back into camp, looking exactly like his old boyfriend, that he’d popped a boner. All he wanted to do was rub his paws over the wizard’s form, then gently rub the fox’s groin while fingering Veles’ rosebud. But the butler’s personality had bled through and he held himself back.<br />
<br />
It was clear to everyone that the wizard had fucked up. Gregory had taken one look at the obese vulpine and set off purposefully for his tent, shooting the polar bear a look. Geoffrey ignored him, wanting to understand if it WAS a fuck up.<br />
<br />
And it was.<br />
<br />
Then, Charlie had kindly informed him-too late-that he shouldn’t be going on autopilot when doing chores because he was literally ceding his mind to Geoffrey. Which he should have known, of course, or at least figured out. But his stupid tribal brain wasn’t very good at thinking.<br />
<br />
“Geoffrey!” Gregory called, “Attend me!”<br />
<br />
Geoffrey sighed and stood, giving the other two an apologetic look, then left.<br />
<br />
The mink was waiting for him with the goblyn device on the table. <br />
<br />
Around it was the jar full of the skunk’s essence, the eagle’s essence, and Jeff’s figurine. Geoffrey stared at the objects arrayed around the device and…. realized he was referring to himself as Geoffrey again. Damn!<br />
<br />
“Yes, my lo…liege?” Jeff asked, stumbling over the words. <br />
<br />
The polar bear was no longer a passive observer, he realized. If anything, he was now actively attempting to intrude even when Jeff had control. And it was so hard to look at his handsome mink and not feel so much love for the man who’d taken him in, whom he owed so much-<br />
<br />
The bear shook his head.<br />
<br />
“Stop, Geoffrey! I get it!” Jeff snarled. “He’s trying to save us both, stop snuffing me out!”<br />
<br />
There was a pause in the train of thought, then Jeff swore he felt something… nuzzle his own mind. It was odd and pleasant, and he actually popped a boner. Then the presence - and he could sense an actual presence inside of his own mind - -receded. If the bear had done that from the beginning… Jeff shuddered. He’d be done for.<br />
<br />
“Everything alright, Jeff?” The Prince smirked.<br />
<br />
“Yes, I’m fine,” Jeff snarled, then felt suddenly ashamed, “I apologize for raising my voice, my love. It’s just…”<br />
<br />
He snapped his jaw shut.<br />
<br />
“I understand,” The Prince chuckled, patting the bear’s massive hand. “Let’s press the button together.”<br />
<br />
Geoffrey’s heart rose in his chest as his lover comforted-Nope! No, no, no. Naughty fucking butler! Jeff scolded the thought in his mind. Knock it off, I’m onto your new game!<br />
<br />
He was too busy dealing with the other looming presence in his mind that Geoffrey didn’t notice a ratlike face peak through the tent flaps and raise a device of its own and pressing a button just as Geoffrey and Gregory pressed theirs.<br />
<br />
This time, the device hummed audibly, like the power had doubled, somehow, and the tone had changed into something… more… aggressive?<br />
<br />
Again, their clothes rippled as though the device itself were taking a breath. The box wasn’t vibrating, it was shaking, and the breeze built into a mild gale, static building within the room. Jeff wondered if, perhaps, the two of them pressing the button at once had somehow been a mistake.<br />
<br />
Then the static discharged through them both. <br />
<br />
Gregory immediately began to shrink, eyes growing larger, more vulnerable. His fur fluffed and his features softened. Jeff wanted to say something, but his groin had started to throb most pleasurably with every beat of his heart. The polar bear moaned, spreading his legs wide as his orbs churned and swelled.<br />
<br />
“M-my liege,” Jeff groaned, his nipples swelling, sticking perkily out of his fur. S’omething’sh wrung!”<br />
<br />
As the bear spoke, his face swelled, brows shoving even further forward until they started to encroach on his line of sight. His jaw ached and grew, jutting forward, giving the bear a massive under-bite.<br />
<br />
“Muh voishe!” Jeff slurred, his fat lower lip bouncing with each syllable, drool dribbling as he tried to form words. His voice had deepened into a guttural mutter. “I-oh!”<br />
<br />
His head hurt. The bear glanced at the mirror and saw his skull flatten slightly. His thoughts thickened even further than they had before, but Jeff knew how to fight the intelligence loss. Thinking was like walking through mud, but he could still do it. <br />
<br />
As Jeff sat there trying to retain his mind, he couldn’t help but be distracted by the feeling of a hand moving up his thigh.<br />
<br />
“You’re so, like, big Geoffrey!” The Prince giggled, stroking the bear’s package.<br />
<br />
At his touch, the polar bear rumbled out a groan. His cock engorged, plumping so much it pulled his slacks down a bit, revealing his pubic fur and the top curve of his dick. He glanced down at his lover and his eyes went wide with shock.<br />
<br />
The mink had devolved completely into a barely-legal twink, his muscles faded and replaced with lithe features and rather womanly hips. Gregory was eyeing the bear up appreciatively, licking his lips when he saw Jeff’s enormous package bulging in his too-tight slacks. His paws ran up and down Jeff’s tenting groin.<br />
<br />
“Doesn’t that feel better, Geoffrey?” The Prince asked, batting his lashes, his voice squeaky and high-pitched.<br />
<br />
Just like when he was a teenager, the polar bear slowly realized.<br />
<br />
“No-nooo, muh luhrv,” The bear slurred a little with his enlarged lower jaw, “We need tur stahrp it!”<br />
<br />
“Oh, that’s too bad, sweetheart!” The Prince squealed most uncharacteristically, “Let’s try again!”<br />
<br />
The mink leaned forward pressed the button again.<br />
<br />
“Muh leej, nur!” Jeff groaned, cringing away from the table, but he was too late.<br />
<br />
Again, the device hummed, louder and louder, and the wind rippled their clothes. Static built, sparks flying from between their teeth.<br />
<br />
Then it discharged.<br />
<br />
Gregory was hit with the brunt of the magic this time.<br />
<br />
Jeff could only watch, helpless, as the mink’s beautiful snow white fur dirtied, becoming a buttery brown color. It grew denser as the Prince’s muscular body began to change - muscles fading away, before being smoothed over by a layer of dense fat.<br />
<br />
Gregory burped and patted a belly that began to round out, bulk building over his formerly tight stomach. His growing beer gut drooped and sagged over his belt as his previously tight chest plumped into a pair of respectable moobs. The half-bear mink’s rump widened, stretching the stitching of his pants, before coming to a wobbly stop.<br />
<br />
“I feel…” Gregory’s voice began to change, deepening oddly, and his expression grew lazy, eyes half-lidded, ”kinda horny, Jeff.”<br />
<br />
Jeff blinked. Gregory would never call him that! What was happening to his Prince? Well, not his Prince, Geoffrey’s Prince, but still-<br />
<br />
Then Jeff saw his figurine. The one of the fat bear.  <br />
<br />
It was changing as well, growing a bit skinnier, muscles giving his old body a rounded muscularity, like a power lifter’s build. The device was… drawing aspects from souls within its vicinity, swapping them at random. He had to stop it before the Prince touched the button further.<br />
<br />
As the polar bear reached out a paw to cover the device, the tingles struck him.<br />
<br />
His initial reaction of jerking away had saved him from most of the shock, but Jeff could only watch as his fur began falling out. First from his hand, and then in a wave up his arm and across his body. He almost wanted to cry when he saw the furless freak in the mirror and realized polar bears had pitch-black skin.<br />
<br />
That was changing as a pale blue hue began running up his arms and across his body. It was a darker blue on his back and lightening to a fleshy white tone on his chest and stomach, like a frog or a reptile. As the blue tide washed over him it came with a change in the texture of his skin. Jeff hesitatingly touched his pec, noting how thick and leathery his new blue hide felt.<br />
<br />
that the changes seemed to stop, much to Jeff’s relief, and he remembered what he’d been trying to do. He needed to stop the Prince from pressing the damn button again!<br />
<br />
“Gregory?” Jeff slurred, drool sloping from the side of his hairless muzzle and dribbling to the floor.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, babe?” The mink said, playing with his gut and staring at the butler with undisguised lust, “Are you mad at me?”<br />
<br />
“Yesh!” Jeff grumbled.<br />
<br />
“Maybe you could spank me, ya know?” The half-bear mink pinched a swollen nipple. “Mmmf! Fuck me in my tight virgin ass.”<br />
<br />
Jeff’s huge cock twitched in his too-tight slacks. <br />
<br />
There was nothing he wanted more than to pummel that hot fat mink’s hole, ramming his cock in there until he had absolutely demolished it. But… there was something wrong with that too. Wasn’t the entire purpose of the device to fix him? He wasn’t fixed, all his fur had fallen out and all his male parts were swollen.<br />
<br />
“No.” Jeff said firmly, “Chahrlie! Call Chahrlie!”<br />
<br />
“Why?” Gregory pouted. “Aren’t I hot enough for you?”<br />
<br />
“Wrrawng, bahd…” Jeff shook his head. “Need help! Need Chahrlie!”<br />
<br />
The tent flap opened, a glowing yellow eye inspecting the two.<br />
<br />
In the chaos, neither of them noticed the goblyn raise his controller and depress the button. On the table, the device’s button suddenly depressed. Gregory and Jeff looked down at the device in shock as it began to hum again, the wind blowing.<br />
<br />
“You push buttin?” Jeff rumbled uncertainly.<br />
<br />
“No, man. Course not, you’re freakin’ out over it. Why the fuck-?” Gregory stared blearily at the device.<br />
<br />
Another flash as static energy discharged throughout the room.<br />
<br />
Jeff immediately grew taller, his head spinning as he rose, growing to almost 9 feet tall, forcing him to hunch down to avoid poking through the top of the tent. The wooziness that had struck him didn’t go away and he wobbled clumsily on too-tall and ungainly limbs.<br />
<br />
Gregory, on the other hand, was sprouting brown and white feathers while his muzzle twisted and hardened, becoming a sharply hooked beak. Despite the rather dramatic change from fur to feathers, underneath his skin things stayed pretty much the same, though some muscle was giving his form a proper shape. His face was still young and, despite the beak, his face radiated the look of someone drunk on lust.<br />
<br />
Jeff gasped as his clothes fluttered away, revealing his odd, hairless form beneath. His muscles started growing again, tensing and contracting in a process that was more like a release of pressure than something painful or unpleasant. They continued to bulk until the were huge and misshapen -  like the kind of rough muscles of a laborer rather than the honed muscles of a martial artist..<br />
<br />
His excessively hard muscles were suddenly softened by layer of lab that at first padded, then grew far beyond that. Jeff’s gut swelled into a mattress-sized belly and pillowy moobs. He desperately tried to push the fat down, get it off his hard form, but his gut grew before sagging between his legs, covering his immense groin like the sack of lard it was.<br />
<br />
“Naht… hurr...” Jeff gripped his head as a force continued constricting his thoughts, throttling them again. “Dur… too… big…”<br />
<br />
Gef flexed his arms as the flab covered them, causing the massive muscles underneath to bulge visibly under the thick lay of fatty padding. Then he began hefting and squeezing his wobbly belly with an animal-like curiosity. When had he gotten so fat? Why thinking so hard?<br />
<br />
The eagle nearby trilled a moan, stroking himself off. <br />
<br />
All Gef want was fuck little man. His cock slapped the bottom of his gut as it grew achingly erect. He grunted, feeling good. A heavy musk began to waft from his body as greasy black hairs curled along his body in a thick carpet of growth.<br />
<br />
The fat ogre lowered his head and took a sniff of his rank armpits.<br />
<br />
“Hurr… me smell good…” he mumbled. <br />
<br />
As he spoke, his brutish face began to twist and pop, round ears growing wide and bat like.  Gef’s lower canines ached as they pushed outwards and sharpened, jutting up from his mouth as massive, yellowed tusks. His brow continued to thicken and press forward, giving his face a completely inhuman, thuggish look.<br />
<br />
Last to change were Gef’s eyes, which lost their color, becoming pitch black and sunken, piggy-like into his sockets. His muzzle upturned, becoming more of a snuffling snout. The ogre reached up a three-fingered hand and picked his nostrils before flicking a green blob to the floor.<br />
<br />
“Hellooo, boys!” A goblyn said.<br />
<br />
Grey, the bald eagle, looked over at the green little monster and lazily waved a wing, stroking himself off. Gef grunted, form continuing to hunch as muscle built in his back before his gorilla-like arms touched the floor. He wanted to paw himself off, but his head still swam.<br />
<br />
The goblyn lit a cigar, “How are you two feeling?”<br />
<br />
“Me feel… weird.” Gef grunted. “Weird but gud..”<br />
<br />
“I want to someone to fuck me.” Grey said as he continued to stroke himself.<br />
<br />
“Oh, I think dat can be arranged. And you know what, Gef? I think I know exactly wat ya need. Boys, give Gef a toy for bein’ such a good sport,” The goblyn bared his yellowed and crooked teeth.<br />
<br />
“Toy?” Gef mumbled.<br />
<br />
“A good toy for a good boy,” The goblyn patted Gef’s round gut amicably, making the ogre belch dumbly and scratch his ass. “Ya deserve it, pal.”<br />
<br />
Two goblyns walked in, carrying a well-greased tube. Gef felt something cool brush his wide asscheks and bent forward slightly to give his masters better access. With a grunt, he felt to tip of the dildo pop into his strangely loose sphincter. Then the goblyns pressed a button and pleasure exploded in the ogre’s dull mind.<br />
<br />
“Ah!” Gef jerked forward, making the vibrator smack against his prostate. “Me-oh! M-mashturrrs…”<br />
<br />
“That’s it,” The goblyn smirked, blowing strange-smelling smoke in Gef’s face as he writhed around the vibrator. “In a couple a minutes, ya won’t remember a thing. I promise, yall feel great.”<br />
<br />
And Gef did feel great. His loss of intellect was starting to feel less like someone throttling and more… comfortable. The vibrator lurched and he bucked, bliss flashing in his limited mind. Yeah, no more thinking. Just let little masters think…<br />
<br />
“Hurrr…” Gef’s beady black eyes glazed over, cock spurting greenish-yellow precum like a garden hose. “Is gud toy!”<br />
<br />
The goblyns avoided the puddle the ogre’s cock was making on the floor and relieved Grey of his clothes. Then they wrapped both of their new servants in loincloths - just enough to pass public decency laws. The lead goblyn was grinning the whole time, smoking on a fat cigar.<br />
<br />
“Should we remove his limbs now, sir?” The bat-faced one shrieked, pointing at the twinky eagle.<br />
<br />
“Nah. Dey say dat da buyer wants ‘im delivered, so I say he walks his ass dere himself.” The goblyn blew a puff of smoke. “Gef, take your boy back to our wagon, capiche?”<br />
<br />
“Yesh mashtur,” The ogre drooled through his short tusks.<br />
<br />
Just as the ogre made to take the eagle out, there were two thumps from outside.<br />
<br />
The goblyns froze.<br />
<br />
“Gask, Maroni?” The bat-faced goblyn screeched, “Are ya okay?”<br />
<br />
A rat-faced goblin and a dog-like goblin’s broken bodies crashed through the tent flaps, knocking the bat to the ground.<br />
<br />
Before he could get up, a towering, black furred wolf stepped down on the bodies, pinning the goblyns to the floor. Looking up at the remaining goblyn, Charlie saw it standing in the middle of the room, a look of shock on its face as it held a controller in its hand. Charlie lifted his arm, leveling a hand crossbow its face. The  goblyn swallowed and turned to order the ogre to attack, when a paw whipped out and slapped his throat.<br />
<br />
The  goblyn choked and wheezed, dropping the controller and gasping for air.<br />
<br />
“Now, I’m only going to ask once,” Charlie said quietly. “Undo this.”<br />
<br />
“I made… a bargain…” The original goblyn gasped out.<br />
<br />
“And I promise to kill you if you don’t break it.” Charlie smiled, showing his teeth, “And I’ll do it slow. It’ll be fun. For me.”<br />
<br />
“Youse hurt da mashtur?” Gef stepped forward, cracking his knuckles.<br />
<br />
Charlie’s finger tightened on the crossbow&#39;s trigger.<br />
<br />
“No!” The original goblyn stuck his hand out, stopping the ogre in his tracks. “It’s fine. Hold… hold still, Gef.”<br />
<br />
Charlie watched as his two party members were reverted back to their original forms. Then the trio started having their version of fun, much to the goblyns’ dismay.  When all was said and done, the party had recovered its money and the goblyn wagon left the caravan, sans a few of its former members.</p>
