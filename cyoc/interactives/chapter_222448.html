<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Well it&#39;s eve already so maybe we should look someone at the near campus bar&quot; Adel said and begun to search a fitting person for their testing.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s that late already. Will I be kicked out if stay here too long?&quot; Hillary wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;No. The school is very lax this side of the campus since everyone living here is connected to a influencal people, like such as yourself.&quot; Adel coughed to their mother. &quot;Also we have this thing so I can just make it so that there&#39;s enough sleeping space for both of us.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s wonderful. So are we picking her?&quot; Hillary said and pointed a 5&#39;6 tall black haired woman named Julia. &quot;The computer says that she is 19-years-old second year student and she is spending quality time with three other students. She is shy person, but brings a more assertive persona when she is out. Interesting.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think she is a good target for our testing. She seems to be now heading to the bar to her seat. Should we make her aware of the changes or...?&quot; Adel asked as they both peered her actions from the invisible camera that was showing everything.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is it creepy that we can make any changes to her while she can&#39;t see us while we can observe her like flies in the ceiling.&quot; Hillary chuckled as she tried to contain her excitement.<br />
<br />
&quot;I make her aware of the changes, but all of them happen slowly.&quot; Adel noted. &quot;Also I put the audio on so we can hear what they talk about.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Like yall that man had some rizz up his sleeve.&quot; A girl next to Julia said.<br />
<br />
It looked like Julia wasn&#39;t that interested in the topics of men and clothes. She was a science student and was invited to the group because her cousin Erika. Erika&#39;s friends Bambi and Mika were in same class as Erika. Adel soon found out that Julia knew that Bambi and Mika were only hanging out with Erika because of her mother&#39;s monetary status, but at the same time Julia didn&#39;t want to butt in her own voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;I get bad vibe from those two. Should we also change them a little bit?&quot; Hillary scoffed. &quot;Like who would be a friend with someone just because they have money.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So what do you suggest?&quot; Adel asked as they raised an eyebrow.<br />
<br />
&quot;Make them work for their money. Like they should eat a huge fat dick for their friendship.&quot; Hillary shook her head.<br />
<br />
Adel begun to type something and watched as Bambi and Mika begun to tremble. Their both mean laughs suddenly stopped as they begun to avert their eyes from Erika.<br />
<br />
&quot;What did you do?&quot; Hillary asked.<br />
<br />
Adel told their mother to just watch as Bambi went under the table without anyone noticing. The laptop&#39;s speakers adjusted Bambi&#39;s whispering voice louder as she asked from Erika if it was okay her to earn some extra cash as she was currently broke. Erika gave her a thumbs-up to her and lowered the top of the chic navy blue short shorts revealing a massive dick with fist sized balls.<br />
<br />
Bambi made an audible gulp as her whole mouth was filled with the dick. There was enough space for her to breath but the dick was half-way in her mouth like a piston. She was only able to lubricate the tip and half of the penis. Bambi begun to sweat as it was really difficult to &#39;swallow&#39; the whole penis without deepthroating which she wasn&#39;t comfortable with.<br />
<br />
Erika only did this for the power trip and watched as Mika&#39;s hand was shaking. Julia became more chipper all of a sudden and joked that might have known who lost the rock-paper-scissors. Mika was also a bit worried as she glanced at Julia who now had a cock too.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait a minute. I didn&#39;t type that...&quot; Adel said out loud as she watched Julia hiding her average sized dick and egg sized balls.<br />
<br />
Julia was eyeing and telling Mika without saying a word that she might also get something nice if she went under the table too to suck some lollies. Mika let out a sigh and went under the table next to the Bambi who was trying her best to do something. Mika&#39;s job was easier as Julia was still a bit inexperienced and she came pretty fast on Mika&#39;s mouth before she could do anything special.<br />
<br />
As Mika raised her head under the table. She noticed Erika slumbed on top of the table gleefully smiling and Julia accross her looking pleasured. Julia handed her a two 200$ bills under her palm and Mika pocked them to her bra while watching elsewhere.<br />
<br />
&quot;It looks like that her cousin was born first and their family is known from having dickgirls and hermaphrodites.&quot; Hillary said as Adel watched this whole thing escalate. &quot;They mother is a well known porn actress, stock market guru and makes a lot of money also by working in biology research, like I do. Her name doesn&#39;t ring any bells, so I guess she an investor?&quot;<br />
<br />
Both Julia and Erika had been born with dicks without vaginas. Erika being more assertive because of her status and dick size.<br />
<br />
&quot;What else should we do while that girl is still giving a fellatio?&quot; Hillary asked as she looked Adel thinking of what to say.</p>
