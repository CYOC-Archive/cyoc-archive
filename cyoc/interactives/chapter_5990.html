<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;So why do you rob people anyway?&quot; I asked, the gun still in her face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Better than a real job,&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I doubt that,&quot; I said.  &quot;You've gotta worry about being caught, being killed.  I can't imagine that is fun.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, it's never gotten that close until now,&quot; she admitted.  &quot;This was going to be my last score for awhile.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The heat getting to you?&quot; I asked.<br />
<br />
She nodded tersely.  For a minute she didn't say anything.  &quot;So what are you going to do if you're not calling the cops?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It depends on you,&quot; I said.  &quot;I might still call the cops.  But I'm curious.  You did a number on my front door, so you're obviously athletic.  Why didn't you try and take the gun from me?&quot;<br />
<br />
She laughed quickly, almost to disguise tears.  &quot;First of all, a gun doesn't fly out of my hands by accident.  So I didn't know what to do.  And, how did I know you wouldn't accidentally shoot?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Would you have shot me like you threatened?&quot; I asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't know,&quot; she said.  &quot;I've never had to yet.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And just how long have you been doing this?&quot;<br />
<br />
She exhaled and said, &quot;Two years.&quot;<br />
<br />
She looked young to me so I had to ask.  &quot;How old are you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;23,&quot; she said.  &quot;You make bad choices when you drop out of school.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Obviously,&quot; I said.  I decided that she deserved not to feel the wrath of what I might be able to change her into, but to feel powerless like her victims had.  &quot;Take off your sports coat,&quot; I said.<br />
<br />
She looked back at me in shock.  &quot;What are you trying--&quot;<br />
<br />
I cut her off.  &quot;Do you want me to call the police?&quot; I said.  She shook her head no.  &quot;Then do what I say.  I promise you I won't hurt you.&quot;<br />
<br />
She unbuttoned the coat and slid it off her shoulders.  She was wearing a silky, white shirt.  It was slightly see-through, and I could see her white lace bra underneath the shirt.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Now the shirt,&quot; I instructed.  She unbuttoned the shirt, pulled it out of her mini skirt, and removed it from her body.  Her impressive cleavage was well displayed by her bra.  Her hands instinctively went up to her chest, trying to shield the parts of her anatomy that were exposed.  &quot;Feeling powerless?&quot; I asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; she whispered.  <br />
<br />
&quot;It isn't over yet.  Take off the skirt,&quot; I said.<br />
<br />
She stood up and unzipped the skirt in the back.  She shook her hips back and forth and let it slide down her legs.  I was feeling pretty turned on by the way she let the skirt fall from her body.  It was almost as if she was playing along and trying to entice me.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you trying to seduce me?&quot; I asked, taking notice of the thin red panties she was wearing.<br />
<br />
&quot;N-no,&quot; she stammered.  &quot;I-I was just--&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't worry,&quot; I said.  &quot;I'm not going to hold it against you.&quot;  She sat back down on the couch.  &quot;If anything it helped.&quot;<br />
<br />
She had only her bra and panties left on.  She had stepped out her high heels when she took off the skirt.  She seemed very uncomfortable.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you understand what I'm doing?&quot; I asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sort of,&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm making you feel just the same way your victims felt.  Powerless, exposed, hurt, you name it.  You're feeling the same way now.&quot;  She looked like she was going to cry.  &quot;But I can tell that you feel sorry for what you've done.  Otherwise you wouldn't be so cooperative right now.&quot;<br />
<br />
She said nothing for a moment.  I let her think about what I had said.  Then I told her, &quot;You were right about one thing.  Guns don't just fly out of people's hands.  You see this?&quot; I asked, showing her the ring.  She nodded.  &quot;Normally you wouldn't believe this, but this ring grants any wish I want.  That's how I have your gun.&quot;<br />
<br />
She seemed taken aback by what I told her.  But she didn't question the validity of my claim.  I continued, &quot;Now I don't know if I can do something for you with this ring.  But I'm willing to try.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If?&quot; she ponderously asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;If you're willing to do what I want,&quot; I replied.  &quot;I'm about to exact some sweet revenge on 6 girls in my school.  When all is said and done, they'll be worshipping the ground I walk on.  I don't want to do that to you.  But I do want you to see it.  So come Monday afternoon, I want you to come back in front of this house, wearing nothing but an overcoat and a smile.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nothing but?&quot; she asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;As naked as the day you were born underneath,&quot; I said.  &quot;You'll see why when we get there.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Get where?&quot; she asked again.<br />
<br />
&quot;That's a surprise.  You can't know it yet,&quot; I told her.<br />
<br />
&quot;OK,&quot; she said.  &quot;I'll do it.&quot;  She paused for a minute.  &quot;Is there anything else you want me to do?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Only if you want to,&quot; I said.<br />
<br />
She glanced at my groin.  I was pretty hard and she could tell.  &quot;I haven't had sex for three years,&quot; she said.  Why she told me that was beyond me.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can't imagine that,&quot; I said.  &quot;You're a very beautiful woman.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Turning to a life of crime can put a kink in your social life,&quot; she said.  &quot;And it seems that you have designs for me anyway.  Might as well do it now.&quot;  She reached behind her back and unclasped her bra.  She slid it off her shoulders and invited me to remove it from her chest.  I did and revealed her gorgeous globes of flesh.<br />
<br />
I stripped myself quickly while she took off her panties.  We made love on the couch.  Desptie her long layoff, she was very experienced and pleasurable.  I think she found me the same way.<br />
<br />
After we were done, and she was laying on top of me, I asked, &quot;Is Brittany your real name?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Brittany is,&quot; she said.  &quot;Powers isn't.  I don't know if I should tell you what my real name is.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm not going to turn you in,&quot; I assured her.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's Brittany Riegel,&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, Brittany Riegel, I wish that any loot you still have from your robberies were returned to their owners and that the owners wouldn't think it was ever stolen.&quot;  Her eyes told me she was horrified at what I had done.  &quot;I also wish that the police thought they had caught the Door-to-Door Robber, and that any and all evidence that pointed to you no longer existed.&quot;<br />
<br />
She was still horrified that I had made those wishes.  &quot;Why did you do that?&quot; she asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;To make sure no one would be looking for you, for one thing,&quot; I said.  &quot;You won't have to look over your shoulder unless you go and rob someone else,&quot; I said.  &quot;And you're not going to do that are you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; she said.  <br />
<br />
&quot;So just go home and think of how your life is going to change now,&quot; I said.  &quot;And I'll see you Monday.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;OK,&quot; she said, kissing me once more.  She dressed herself and said, &quot;I'll see you Monday then...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Joe,&quot; I said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Until then, Joe,&quot; and she walked out the front door.<br />
<br />
I wished my clothes back on as I lay on the couch.  Monday couldn't come soon enough.</p>
