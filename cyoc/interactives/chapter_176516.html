<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Karen felt like she was floating, was she dead…no she had been bitten by a strange white creature. She remembers flashes of the creature biting at her before sinking its teeth into her hips and settling in. Why had that happened, then she remembered she had started a new journey at the age of 47, she had left everything behind in the hopes or reuniting with her daughter who is the story was true had become a mermaid. <br />
<br />
She opened her blue green eyes and saw she was in some kind of room, her whole body hurt and she felt so tired. A particle floated over her and in that point, she realized that she was in the water yet she was breathing she was becoming a mermaid after all. She turned her head slightly, that movement alone hurt as she saw Kat laying on a bed/slab a few feet away from her. She had a large white fish like tail attached to her hip, it was the same thing which was likely attached to her hip.<br />
<br />
“Doctor…she is up?” said a female voice as a shadow fell over her. She looked up to see a man, for a second she almost thought it was her late husband, but the hair color was wrong, but he did have a strong jaw like her late husband and kind eyes. He had short silver beard and silver hair, silver as in pure silver like it was died not silver with age. He wore a vest which was black but with a white circle and a silver trident on it. She had to admit he was activities, she had been on a few dates since her husband died 5 years ago when a drunk driver hit him, but nothing major which was way leaving everything behind to be with her daughter hadn’t really bothered her that much.<br />
 <br />
“Please rest, you are going through the process of becoming a mermaid and everything is going great.” said the Doctor <br />
<br />
“Ta…Taylor…” whispered Karen <br />
<br />
“Your daughter is on the way, she should be here in a few hours, don’t worry.” Reassured the doctor as he placed his hand on top of hers. “Now rest.”<br />
<br />
She tried to fight it but in the end sleep took her and she passed out again. <br />
<br />
When she opened her eyes again, the room while darker was still light enough to see. Her body still felt like it had been through the ringer, it was not the worse she had felt. That had been right after labor, but it was close. She looked around, only to see a figure sitting on a chair beside her bed. The hair was brighter yellow, almost seaming to glow a bit and her features seamed a little different. Thinner waste and maybe a little more pronounced chest however sitting there, her head resting against the wall was her daughter.<br />
<br />
“Taylor…” said Karen weakly as tears began to come from her eyes, the tears felt a little differently as she looked at her sleeping daughter. She wore a top which she didn’t fully approve of it looked like a bikini top with a boob window and a collar around her daughter’s neck. It was a light blue color with purple trim. It was not the type of thing someone would wear aside at the beach, then she looked down and saw the bright yellow tail which was attached to her daughter’s hip with some scales above the hips but not much. She had some fins on the side of her tail, a small pair on her side by the hips and another smaller set by the ankle area. She could see her daughter breathing, water came into her body before exiting through a set of gills located on her side below the breasts. <br />
<br />
“Taylor…” said Karen a little stronger as she reached out toward her daughter who was still asleep. <br />
<br />
“Mrs. Campbell.” Said a voice Karen knew well as she looked away from her daughter to a new figure who had just entered the room. He seamed different as well, his hair was blacker, his eyes had changed colors to a red color which gave him a slightly creepy look if she did not see warmth in those eyes. He seamed fitter as well, more defined as he wore a loss fitting sleeveless red shirt. His tail was jet black with pieces of red mixed in but two larger bands of red on his side. His fins where slightly larger and placed in different spots but even with the changes she recognized him. <br />
<br />
“Sam…” said Karen to her daughter’s boyfriend, he was carrying two cups as he swam up. “So, this is real you are alive.”<br />
<br />
“We are.” Confirmed Sam as he shook Taylor’s shoulder causing her eyes to open. <br />
<br />
“I was asleep why did you wake…” started Taylor before she noticed that her mom was awake. “Mom.”<br />
<br />
“Taylor.” said Karen as she raised a hand only to have her daughter grab it. Karen tried to wrap her fingers in her daughters’ hand but now her daughter had webbed hands which made it hard, but none of that matter. “I am so…happy you are alive.”<br />
<br />
“I am happy you accepted to come join us.” Said Taylor with a smile as tears formed in her own eyes. “I am just sorry it cost you the flower shop you and dad made.”<br />
<br />
“Honey…you are the most important thing your father and I ever made, you not some flower shop.” Stated Karen her body hurting but she wanted to see, she tried to sit up only to find it hard until Sam helped her up. She looked down to see that the white shirt and jacket she had been wearing had been removed so she only wore her bra which now had additional covering in the form of a blanket. That was weird enough and slightly offensive that someone undressed her however where here hips started the skin turned from flesh to scales. Scales which were still white but it looked as if it was fully fused. She tried curl her toes but saw the edge her new tail curled. <br />
<br />
“This is weird.” stated Karen as the door opened and the same Doctor as before entered. Same silver hair and now she saw his eyes were also silver, his tail was silver and black with a few greys mixed in. She was half tempted to call him a silver fox but foxes didn’t have fish tail, so maybe a silver fish was the better term.<br />
<br />
“Ah…you are up early; your roommate Kat is still out.” Said the doctor as Karen looked to see Kat was still out and Amanda was sitting in a chair like Taylor had been Amanda was asleep as well only with her head resting on the bed beside the still sleeping Kat. <br />
<br />
“Doctor…why did someone remove my clothes?” inquired Karen<br />
<br />
“I apologize for that, however as your daughter will tell you merfolk’s gills are located on their sides and as such the areas around the gills need to be uncovered or lossy covered.” Explained the doctor as he turned a bit to show that the vest, he wore had open panels which showed his uncovered gills. “We judged that your cloths where too tight so to make sure your breathing was ok, we had to remove your cloths. Do not worry only female nurses where in the room when this happened.”<br />
<br />
“I understand.” Said Karen, it made sense and she would not be upset if her shirt had to be removed at a hospital so that Doctors could work on her. It made sense and her sides did hurt.<br />
<br />
“Well I need to check on your gills now.” explained the Doctor as Sam swam back a bit before the doctor leaned over and looked at her side and then up toward her beasts. Karen felt her face redden and felt a mixture of embarrassment and if she admitted it to her self-flattered by a man as good looking as him looking at her. He put on a pair of gloves and felt her side before nodding his head. He repeated the process on the other side. “Both your gills are coming in good, after they do you should expect more changes over the next few days.”<br />
<br />
“Changes?” inquired Karen<br />
<br />
“Biggest change will be the color coming in on your tail but hair, eye colors also change commonly.” Explained the Doctor “Other changes are stronger muscles, leaner bodies and other features.”<br />
<br />
“Ya…Rose’s bust grew in size, not that Nate will argue about that.” laughed Taylor as the Doctor seamed a little tense, most people would dare joke about the bust of the future Queen but smiled a bit.<br />
<br />
“I am sure the Crown Prince will not argue but we have no control over that.” Said the Doctor “Given that your daughter has gone through the process and how close you two look to each other we can assume you two will look similar minus the age differences.”<br />
<br />
“In other word you will look really good mom.” Said Taylor <br />
<br />
“I never really liked yellow.” Stated Karen <br />
<br />
“You may not get a yellow tail; your daughter may get that from her father…” said the Doctor before he noticed the sad look on everyone’s faces. “Sorry I assume he isn’t joining you?”<br />
<br />
“No…he died a few years ago.” Explained Karen as the Doctor gave her a sad smile.<br />
<br />
“I know that feeling, my wife died in an accident 7 years ago I miss her every day.” Said the doctor <br />
<br />
“Thank you…Doctor?” inquired Karen<br />
<br />
“Manius.” answered the Doctor as both of them shared a smile between each other before the doctor checked Kat for her transformation before leaving the room.<br />
<br />
“So mom…should I arrange a date between you and the doctor?” joked Taylor as Karen looked at her a mixture of annoyance and tiredness. She and her daughter had always been very open and sharing. <br />
<br />
“Not the worse idea, but first I need to sleep.” Said Karen as she let sleep take her again.</p>
