<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jennifer tried her best to find clothes that could fit her but everything were either too large or too tight. She looked all the piles and made an observation that all of them belonged to her mother. Everything she had in her room had a decade old look to them.<br />
<br />
&#39;No. How&#39;s that even...&#39; Jennifer muttered herself.<br />
<br />
Jennifer wasn&#39;t sure if her mom did buy her new clothes or that she didn&#39;t care much about it. Jennifer had to ask about it as she found an extra large black band t-shirt that she could use as a dress that went over her thighs. All the underwear wear out of the question as most of them were crusty or had visible stains in them. Jennifer winced as she had to use the ones that were clearly meant for her mother. The panties weren&#39;t a tight fit as they a little bit too large for her but the plus side was that they smelled better than the rest and the t-shirt covered them.<br />
<br />
She took a glance at herself from the half-broken mirror in her room and felt happy with the clothes she had to work with for today. She didn&#39;t know about the band but the logo was an eyecatcher as it took all the attention from her stomach. With it nobody couldn&#39;t know as the black color and bigger size made her appear slimmer. The only thing being the weird perfume stench that covered the whole shirt covering Jennifer in it&#39;s smell.<br />
<br />
After that Jennifer slowly waddled outside of her room.<br />
<br />
The house had an unique smell as a lot of thing all over the house were covered in dust or similar kind of stains left by sugary drinks and assortmen of foods. It seemed that her mom wasn&#39;t too keen on cleaning or maintaining the house. From upstairs Jennifer noticed her mother swiping on her phone and whining how much awful &quot;canditates&quot; she had for tonight.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jeez. Why can&#39;t a high value woman such as myself find a decent guy. Like, yuck, no to him and to him. Especially to him. What&#39;s this guys problem. Oh that&#39;s cutie, but NO. Also, no to him and to him.&quot; Jennifer heard her mom hissing in the kitchen.<br />
<br />
It seemed her mother didn&#39;t have any filters. When there was no-one around her mom she would say a lot of awful things out loud. She also seemed to be so absorbed on the phone that she didn&#39;t pay any attention what was happening around her as Jennifer begun to ascend the stairs. Jennifer made an audible gulp as she saw her mother just quickly eyeing on her as she slowly took one step at a time. She was quite worried why her body reacted like this as she remembered her mother being sweet and caring.<br />
<br />
As Jennifer got on the first floor Silvia was already in front of her asking why she took so long to come to kitchen. As if it was Jennifer&#39;s fault for being inconsiderate asshole. Silvia would only smack her lips as she strutted back to the kitchen. Jennifer could only shrug as this was a way different mother than she had used to lived with. It was like her mother had never learned humility and treated Jennifer like a non-player character in her own life. Silvia opened a can of tuna and placed it with a half opened box of value box poptarts on her plate with one can of soda. Jennifer was curious where her mom had gotten all this but her devilish smile told her more than she needed.<br />
<br />
Silvia was using Jennifer&#39;s seat as leg holder and looked a bit frustrated as Jennifer pulled it to sit on it. The whole kitchen looked a bit barren and trashy at the same time. Definetly not a place where you would want to invite people to come but good enough to sleep at. It gave a motel vibes as Jennifer took a sip from the room temperature sugar flavored drink. The taste was weird but passable.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey. Jenni. Like, listen to this. A guy wants me to pay half of a dinner date for HIM.&quot; Her mother said as she displayed her phone to Jennifer. &quot;Like. Wow. Talk about sheep in wolf&#39;s clothes. Acting all badass and BLAM telling me that I need to share the date with HIM. Like, christ all-mighty...&quot;<br />
<br />
Jennifer could only nod as she munched on the poptarts and gulped down the soda. It seemed her mother didn&#39;t care about what they ate unless it was cheap. Coffee maker had a big crack on it so drinking tap water was out of the question. Jennifer looked at the can she was drinking from. She noticed that it was the generic and off-brand one in which the sugar had been replaced with full of artificial sweetners.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now he&#39;s telling me how bad of a mother I am. Like how can someone be this desperate. I think I&#39;m going to just remove the small detail that I even have kids as people only harrass me with questions like, &#39;why do they need to pay for your babysitting&#39;. Like, I think you are old enough to be by yourself...&quot; Silvia sighed as she tapped on her phone.<br />
<br />
Jennifer kept nodding silently as her mother kept berating and whining how every guy in the phone&#39;s application didn&#39;t meet her standards. Jennifer didn&#39;t feel like that this Silvia was her mother, but felt a sudden heartburn followed with a  weird anxiety attack.<br />
<br />
&#39;No. She&#39;s my mother...&#39; Jennifer panted as Silvia didn&#39;t even notice how heavily Jennifer was breathing. &#39;That&#39;s odd... Why did my body react like that when I thought about it. Then again I&#39;m mentally still 18-year-old while my body is, well...&#39;<br />
<br />
&quot;Jenni? Jenni! Daydreaming already?&quot; Silvia shouted.<br />
<br />
Jennifer felt bit odd as Silvia almost threw a temper tantrum but looked at the broken watch on the wall.<br />
<br />
&quot;...wait a moment. Shouldn&#39;t you be in the bus already?&quot; Silvia asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bus!?&quot; Jennifer gasped.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, you know. THE school bus.&quot; Silvia noted and laughed a little bit as Jennifer was flabbergasted by what her mom said to her.<br />
<br />
Jennifer was almost thrown out the door by her mother with her school bag and flipflops as her only legwear as she hurried inside the bus. The driver shook his head as everyone looked at her weirdly. Every person in the bus not making eye contact with her as she finally found an open seat at the backrow of the bus. Everyone quietly letting her pass through as if she was a ghost or boogieman. No-one didn&#39;t want to sit next to Jennifer as she must have smelled awful. Not even her mother wouldn&#39;t wave her hand as a goodbye as the bus took off and Jennifer took shelter at the backseat.<br />
<br />
&#39;This is so messed up that it&#39;s not funny.&#39; Jennifer pondered as the people in the bus begun to pick-up the conversations where they left off. It was like the whole world was against Jennifer without her knowing about it. How would the teachers react if the other students were acting this cold already.</p>
