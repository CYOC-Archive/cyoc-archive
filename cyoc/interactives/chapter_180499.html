<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Ohh yeah babe, thanks for doing this for me! Fucking YES! You&#39;re so good at this!&quot; Kendall moaned outloud as he felt Allison&#39;s very talented mouth around his substantial manhood. Very few women were able to handle his very apt, large and capable hidden talent in such a capacity. He twitched and felt his shoulders tense up a bit from the sheer pleasure, not even seeing them grow just slightly larger and more impressive. Allison, between his legs on the bed, was making use of her lessons with some generously sized fruit, seeing as she knew from experience that Kendall was absolutely enormous when it came to endowment.<br />
<br />
Kendall&#39;s hand brushed over her head, and a lazy grin showed on his face as he enjoyed the blowjob in full. He had quite a surprising amount of sex for the kind of guy he&#39;d typically be assumed to be, in fact a point of pride of his was the fact that many of the jocks didn&#39;t have nearly as many lovers as Kendall. Though he always made sure to treat his lady friends well, and never acted as if they were arm candy or just something to be used for pleasure.<br />
<br />
Plus, he always tried to make sure to show his lovers a good time.<br />
<br />
Kendall spoke aloud as best he could, &quot;Ohh, the unexpected...sudden tumescence of my manhood was...certainly a surprise, but definitely a very...enjoyable one...ohh fuck babe you&#39;ll make me incoherent at this rate fuuuck!&quot; Kendall almost felt his control over his body lapse - not even seeing as he clenched his kneecaps that his biceps toned up and became slightly larger and stronger. Kendall admitted he was used to having a quite capable tool at his disposal, but something seemed different tonight.<br />
<br />
He couldn&#39;t quite pinpoint what it was, even as Kendall&#39;s pecs pushed out a little bit more than usual, his midsection seeming tighter and a little more toned. Perhaps these slight bodily changes all around contributed to Kendall&#39;s stamina being worn down by his increased sensitivity, &quot;A word of warning, babe, orgasm imminent. I can...I can hold it back for a little longer, but not...mmph, much.&quot;<br />
<br />
Keeping that in mind, Allison kept sucking, and she felt a sense of accomplishment when her determined blowjob reduced Kendall from his intelligent words to breathless moans and groans and grunts. She could feel his manhood twitching in that telltale way that suggested he was due to cum. She&#39;d had sex with him enough times to know his little tics like that. She got off of him and jerked him for a little, and Kendall had to prop himself up with his hands to avoid falling on his back as he emitted on the floor.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck!! That was amazing, truly outstanding,&quot; Kendall started, wiping some sweat off of his head, &quot;You&#39;re something else. I swear.&quot; His breathing informed Allison that most likely it&#39;d be a while yet before they could resume the study session, as it were. Even as she nudged his manhood a little bit, Kendall chuckled, &quot;Oh you minx! Give me a moment&#39;s rest at least! My, you truly are devoted to the pursuit of our scholarly demonstrations of aptitude.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I wouldn&#39;t be so eager to get this going if you weren&#39;t so good at it.&quot; Allison responded, laying back and deciding to get herself toweled off and ready for whenever their &quot;study session&quot; resumed. My, if her mom knew what these vigorous study sessions really entailed. It wasn&#39;t like Allison really needed much study in many subjects.<br />
<br />
Kendall thought back to the times that very evening when he couldn&#39;t think of a certain word.<br />
<br />
He wondered if it might be just him, having been exhausted by Allison&#39;s sexual appetite. Maybe it was just a momentary issue. It seemed to come and go - happening just often enough for him to realize when it hit him, and just infrequently enough that he barely considered it an issue. &quot;Considering you have no fondness for male stubble, I&#39;ll go ahead and avail myself of my father&#39;s razor.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nodding along, Kendall went out, not even bothering to put on clothes again, smiling as he felt his manhood swinging around. This time, as he went about heading to his dad&#39;s room to use the razor, Kendall did a few amateur dance moves on his way, and even broke into a joking flex for a nearby mirror visible through an opened door...and was actually surprised by how good he looked. Well, sex was said sometimes to be an exercise of sorts, and Allison always engaged with him in a lot of it.<br />
<br />
As Kendall found his dad&#39;s room, he looked around and noticed some of the clothes in the opened up closet. Pretty much all business clothes and stuff the older man would wear around the house. And for some reason, Kendall felt a strange sense about the room. It seemed to give him an odd vibe - almost belonging. Huh. Well, he was here on a mission, and he didn&#39;t intend to keep Allison waiting very long. Upon seeing the state of his face, he rubbed his chin and jawline. Hearing it was one thing, seeing it was something else. &quot;Well, hair, your days are numbered.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kendall started using his dad&#39;s razor, and despite having never used it once before, it took him no time at all to expertly use it with no nicks or breaks of skin to shave up his facial hair. He made sure to clean himself off with a rag, and looked himself over in the mirror. &quot;Perchance there is something odd about...but I feel good tonight. Just my mind playing tricks on me?&quot; Kendall mused aloud and turned to walk away as his back slightly thickened and strengthened.<br />
<br />
Returning to the study room, he saw her sprawled out on the bed, and once again his manhood sprung to life. &quot;You certainly do know, Allison, how to entice me to action.&quot; As Kendall walked in, readying his manhood for action, he tried to put the night&#39;s oddities to the back of his mind.<br />
<br />
---------------<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, across the town, another person was feeling the effects of the transformative wish, though not someone so involved with romance in the present. Professor Alex Clark was trying to get some sleep earlier on than most, his history being quite messy. He had once been a muscular, powerfully built man in his youth, who had married his high school sweetheart. However their relationship took a turn for the sour, and before they could at all rectify the problems in the relationship, such as Alex&#39;s obsession with his job and studies, and Miranda&#39;s need to be the perfect &quot;super-mom&quot;, Miranda died suddenly - owing to her family&#39;s health history.<br />
<br />
As of now, the 60 year old Alex was one of the oldest teachers at the local school that was also called home by Ross, Diego, Kendall, Allison, Wes and Bryan. He was more stockily built nowadays, his dark hair streaked with silver now. He mostly dressed in a dress shirt, jacket, dress pants, and corresponding shoes. He tried to act on the critiques that his departed wife had of his lifestyle, but he felt he was more or less too late - he didn&#39;t intend to let her down by falling apart, but who&#39;d want a fuddy old professor and what could he even do physically now...?<br />
<br />
He was suddenly stirred out of his sleep however by a sudden jolt of energy through his body. Leaving the older man&#39;s wrinkled face writ with confusion and wonder at the strange feeling. He tossed and turned out of bed, wearing only a pair of pajama pants, barely noticing a few blond hairs in and amongst the grey ones as he tried to consider what that was.<br />
<br />
Professor Clark proceeded downstairs - deciding to check and see if there were any household disturbances. Well, nothing wrong with all the obvious points of entry. So it wasn&#39;t something he needed to be suspicious of - at least as far as he was aware. Alex murmured to himself, &quot;I wonder what that was. It was most curious in nature. Something like a combination of a muscle spasm and something almost...erotic in nature.&quot; He shook his head.<br />
<br />
He felt a strange heat settle over him for a moment as he stood there, not noticing that his gut was slightly tighter, his overweight, stocky build looking a little less bad in the midsection. And just as he felt an odd tightness in his arms, his biceps starting to show signs of life and vitality, he looked down to see a rather embarrassing swelling in his pants. &quot;I...don&#39;t know how long it&#39;s even been since I had one of these pop up so suddenly.&quot;<br />
<br />
It almost made him feel wistfully reminiscent of his youth. My what a thing that was. He remembered being the biggest guy in his class - he was one of few people really there that took to the academic fitness initiative to such a degree. The others even called him a &quot;muscle monster&quot;, even though some of the kids these days most likely jazzed up on who knows what were bigger than he was by far.<br />
<br />
&quot;If I could only return to my &quot;muscle monster&quot; days...&quot; He contemplated, remembering how large he&#39;d been. &quot;I&#39;d still be outflexed by these instagram mutants and steroid junkies, but at least it&#39;d be a contest.&quot; He chuckled and started to head back to bed. He needed all the rest possible at his age, so he thought. But something about tonight just...kept him up. He tossed and turned again and again, but he couldn&#39;t quite fall back asleep. Maybe he&#39;d been a little fast to pursue sleep tonight. It wasn&#39;t that late after all.<br />
<br />
He needed to learn to live it up a bit. That was what his wife had always said. Maybe...maybe Alex needed to head out to the gym or something. Work off this energy. Or something...</p>
