<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">When Stacy wanted to see what creature she&#39;d be she didn&#39;t exactly imagine she&#39;d actually turn into the creature... and even then it wasn&#39;t like she expected she&#39;d be that different. Everything just felt significantly bigger, she felt very uncomfortable when walking, and trying to use human things now was awkward. Especially with her talons and claws being sharp and poking small holes in her parent&#39;s car. She ended up texting Cindy who Stacy knew must be going through similar problems. The new succubus seemed to be doing a lot better though... Those social monsters and being able to be inherently close to humans easily.<br />
Stacy was in an old shirt of hers that was stored away, and while she couldn&#39;t get any pants that fit her the nether regions were feathered enough that she could get away with a &quot;Donald Duck&quot; look. Her breasts were so small that she didn&#39;t even really need a bra, and as she thought about it... to be comfortable it&#39;d be best if she was as sleek as possible. Stacy left for the backyard where they had a decent amount of leftover space, but was cursing her legs for being closer to a hawk than an ostrich. Now finally in the backyard Stacy spread her wings and then jumped and tried flapping her wings. She wasn&#39;t expecting much, maybe a bit of lift, however when she jumped and flapped... Well it wasn&#39;t graceful or flying but he flaps seemed to allow her to move upwards. There was some weirdness about her propulsion as she felt like she was being lifted a lot more than she should&#39;ve been with her muscles... Like swimming in midair a little. On her second attempt she was more about to jump really high and then by spreading out her wings she could glide down a bit slowly.  Then on the third attempt she was able to go from tree branches to her house&#39;s roof relatively easily. The gliding and moving through the air felt great, but with relatively little space it more felt like she was pacing than going for a run or something. There was also that annoying tick in her mind that said not to go too high. Something from her humanity which rejected being so high under her own power, but she was also new to this body. It would be better to practice gliding and flying a few dozen feet off the ground before going a few hundred. Stacy debated for going for a fly across town for a bit, but what would her parents say... Actually what would they really be able to do? She was 16 and had gotten her license. Her body may not be able to drive a car, but with the power of flight she arguably had more freedom in transportation anyways. <br />
She went through her room&#39;s window, she grabbed a loose purse, figured out how to wear it without risking it falling or restricting her wings, and then left for flight. There weren&#39;t many people in the sky, but on occasion you&#39;d see some magic user on a broom or a stray harpy. This time Stacy was that harpy and was having a fun time gliding through the sky. Originally she&#39;d just glide through the air and flap a bit a little concerned something would happen if she&#39;d go too far to the ground. Then she would get a little tired and would conserve her strength a bit by lowering towards lamps and tree branches and jump upwards. The gymnast in her was getting into the rhythm and getting into the rhythm started to do a few tricks. At first it was just a few twirls as she ascended, maybe a backflip or two as she started to descend. <br />
She got herself to the boba shop relatively easily, and got herself a drink... Although the employees somewhat jokingly wondered if they should deny service due to the &quot;No Shirt, No shoes, No service&quot; sign that was on the window. Although they were worried whether her talons would end up scuffing up the floors. A quick flight up to the roof one wingedly and Stacy was able to look around the shopping center with a view all by herself. She checked her phone to see her parents had tried calling her mid-flight, and then left a text message wondering where the hell she was. She texted back and said &quot;Went out for a small flight, at the boba store, probably can&#39;t bring anything back considering I flew there.&quot; Her mother was scratching her head with stress although the readings she was able to do, and a consultant she had started to hire told her that it was perfectly normal for newly transformed to want to get closer to their more monstrous side. So of course a fucking bird would want to fly. She had contacted Josh&#39;s parents which also let her know that Josh&#39;s girlfriend had turned into a succubus. If there was one consolation prize for Stacy&#39;s mom it was that her daughter was simply moving around a lot, and hopefully not getting pulled over for some obscure flight law... Instead of becoming some sort of slut.</p>
