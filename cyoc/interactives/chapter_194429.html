<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Russel stirred awake in his bed, glancing at the alarm clock on the bedside table. It was nearing 4 in the morning, which meant that the effects of the pill Isaac had taken 12 hours earlier would soon be wearing off. Alistair, the guy that Russel had brought home from the night club after his shift, rested his head on Russel’s pecs, sleeping peacefully. Alistair was a frat bro in his early twenties that had serious insecurities about his sexuality; he’d been hanging around Russel at the club for weeks, blatantly ogling the older man every chance that he got. Russel had finally decided to throw the kid a bone, suggesting that Alistair come over after closing so they could talk workout regimens. Thirty minutes later, Russel had been balls deep in the hot young jock. Russel could feel his dick starting to harden as he remembered the pounding he had given Alistair mere hours ago.<br />
<br />
Taking care not to awaken the kid, Russel slowly slid out of bed and made his way to the bathroom. He had seen no need to put clothes on after his early morning activities, so he was fully nude as he strode through the darkened apartment. After relieving himself, Russel took a moment to flex in the mirror, admiring his muscled physique. <br />
<br />
Russel could feel a warm sensation begin to flow through his body, signaling that the changes were going to start momentarily. As much as he hated losing control of his body, he had to admit he loved how he felt while changing back into Isaac. He took his long, hard cock into his hand and slowly started to stroke it, still looking at his reflection in the mirror. The first change he noticed was that his thick, dark gray body hair started to lighten and recede back into his body, leaving him with sparse light blonde hairs on his arms, chest and legs. His large frame slowly started to shrink down, his arms and legs growing shorter as his height rapidly diminished. Russel’s chest and stomach slimmed down, first by his fat melting away, which left him with a defined set meaty pecs and abs. His muscle mass quickly started to dwindle as well, however; his abs faded into a smooth belly while his pecs and nipples continued to deflate.<br />
<br />
Russel’s shoulders were the next to change, slimming down as he took on a lither frame. His biceps, triceps and forearms also slenderized, remaining toned but at a fraction of their former size. His ass tightened up while his legs grew thinner to match his new torso. The skin on his rough, calloused hands grew smooth, his plump fingers becoming daintier. Russel let out a loud grunt, his deep sexy voice growing softer and more youthful as his Adam’s apple became less pronounced in his throat. He quickened the pace of his strokes, sensing that the changes were nearing an end. His salt and pepper buzzcut grew longer and wavier, lightening into a bright blonde. His square jaw rounded as his stubble vanished, giving him a much more boyish appearance. The wrinkles on his face were fading away as Russel regressed in age back to that of a man in his mid-twenties, his dark brown eyes brightening to a soft baby blue.<br />
<br />
Russel’s body tensed up and let out a soft moan as he came, his jizz splattering onto the bathroom mirror. As he ejaculated, his balls shrivelled down and his dick grew thinner and shorter in his hands, the last of Russel’s DNA being ejected through his cum. Isaac regained control to find himself naked and covered in cum, his softening dick still in his grasp.<br />
<br />
Isaac had a quick shower to clean up and rinse the musk of Russel off him before heading back out into his bedroom. He stopped dead in his tracks one he realized there was another naked man in his bed; Russel must have brought someone home from the club. Silently seething in frustration, Isaac crept to his closet and grabbed a pair of sweatpants and a tank top to put on before exiting the bedroom. He resigned himself to spending the rest of the night on his couch and did his best to make the lumpy cushions comfortable to rest on.<br />
<br />
A few hours later, Isaac awoke to the sounds of rustling coming from his bedroom. He got up off the couch to see the stranger from his bed exiting the bedroom, wearing an unbuttoned dress shirt and blue jeans. The stranger noticed Isaac and looked at him apprehensively, clearly expecting someone else.<br />
<br />
“Who are you? Where’s Russel?” The stranger asked.<br />
<br />
“Hi, I’m Isaac. This is my apartment, actually,” Isaac replied, trying not to snarl. He was quite annoyed that he had spent half the night on the sofa, though that wasn’t really the stranger’s fault.<br />
<br />
“Oh. Sorry about your bed,” The stranger laughed, buttoning up his shirt. “How do you know Russel?”<br />
<br />
“He’s…my uncle,” Isaac lied.<br />
<br />
“Ah. You’ve got a really cool uncle. I’m Alistair, by the way. Sorry to barge in on you like this; Russel didn’t mention a nephew last night,” Alistair looked at the ground, clearly embarrassed at the situation.<br />
<br />
“No worries. He’s a good guy, just sometimes a bit…spontaneous,” Isaac sighed.<br />
<br />
“Well, I think I’ve caused you enough inconvenience for one night. I should get going.” Alistair grabbed a pad of paper and pen from the kitchen table and quickly scribbled something down before heading for the front door. “Tell your uncle to call me!”<br />
<br />
As soon as Alistair had left the apartment, Isaac shouted in frustration, running his hands through his hair. What the hell had Russel been thinking, bringing someone back to his apartment like that? One of the rules was that no one from Russel’s life was allowed back at the apartment. Isaac had worked hard to keep his life as Isaac separate from Russel, and he didn’t want that to change. The last thing he needed was for someone to find out that he was living a double life; that would open way more questions than he was comfortable giving answers to.<br />
<br />
He decided it was time that he had a talk with Russel and lay down the law. Russel needed to remember who was in charge; if Isaac decided to stop taking the pills, Russel would cease to exist. Russel needed Isaac way more than Isaac needed Russel.<br />
<br />
At least, that’s what he told himself.</p>
