<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Ahh Jason.... I just love summer, don't you? Now that I got my driver's license and dad let me borrow the car, we can come over here to Sam’s beach whenever we want to!&quot; Rick said to Jason as the two boys walked through the gate at the entrance to Sam’s beach. &quot;Luckily we'll be able to go swimming over here since I have never seen this beach get too crowded before....&quot;<br />
<br />
Jason nodded. &quot;Yeah it's cool.&quot; he said. He always enjoyed anything to do with water. He was a good swimmer and it had given him an athletic build. He had blond hair and brown eyes and today he wore his board shorts. &quot;Hey what's that?&quot; he asked, looking at something made of stone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, we're going to have fun in the sun and... oh gee...&quot; Rick stopped and stared at the strange statue of the muscular kid who was posing in his Speedo, right by the entrance to the beach. &quot;Wow... I've never seen that before!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ditto man. Let's put our stuff up and go look at it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Look, Jason... it has an inscription on the base... It says: <br />
<br />
Welcome to Sam's Beach; <br />
where we offer sun, sand and much, much more.<br />
Touch my muscles and you'll be feeling great; <br />
you’ll leave here feeling better than you've ever felt before.&quot; <br />
<br />
Rick read out loud. &quot;What? That sounds ridiculous!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well why don't you see if it is. I'm gonna go get a spot for my towel and stuff.&quot; Jason said and dashed off to a part of the beach with a little shade and put down his towel.<br />
<br />
&quot;Naw that's dumb! Nobody grows from touching a statue....&quot; <br />
<br />
Rick said as he started walking towards the shore. After a few moments, he started to notice something about the other kids who were swimming or playing in or around the water. <br />
<br />
&quot;Jason... do you notice anything weird about the people who are swimming at this beach?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Umm, not really.&quot; Jason said. &quot;They're buff I guess.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Exactly... especially the guys... even the little ones... it's weird.... don't all the boys seem kinda... muscular to you?&quot; Rick wondered out loud. <br />
<br />
Just then one boy walked right by them. He was even younger then Jason, but his pectorals were huge! He looked like a little bodybuilder or a gymnast! His biceps were bulging and his abs were ripped. He came to retrieve a football that someone had tossed, and Rick was completely astonished by the little kid's muscularity. The boy ran right up to rick and picked up the ball. Then, he turned around, and flung the football back towards the ocean with one mighty toss, similar to an NFL player! Rick was completely spellbound. <br />
<br />
&quot;Jason... Did you see what I saw? Did you see that kid just now?&quot; He couldn't believe how far the little, muscular boy was able to toss the football. &quot;I can't even toss a football that far!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jason smiled. &quot;Well maybe he lifts weights. Wish I looked like that. Maybe it is that statue.&quot; Jason said and dashed over to the statue. &quot;You sure you don't want to be the one to test if it's real?<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't believe it, Jason, but if you want to try it, then go right ahead....&quot;<br />
<br />
Jason shrugged. &quot;Alright.&quot; he said and raised a hand and touched one of the biceps of the statue. He felt a sort of static shock, and frowned, waiting to see if anything happened.<br />
<br />
In the meantime, Rick dove in the water and swam for a bit, before he got out and dried off. Then he lay on the lounge chair, and took his favorite book &quot;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows&quot; out of the bag and started reading it. At 759 pages, it was going to take him a long time to read it all the way through. <br />
<br />
&quot;A perfect book to read on the beach...&quot; rick thought. Of course, he was too busy reading his Harry Potter book to be paying any attention to his little brother....<br />
<br />
Suddenly, Jason was overcome by a warm, tingling feeling. He gasped as he looked on, and saw his OWN biceps expand on his OWN arms! Both of them increased at the same time, until they were the same size as the one on the statue!<br />
<br />
Jason walked back to his brother. &quot;Yeah, I think it was just a gimmick.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rick just mumbled... &quot;Good... now go swimming... Shhhh I'm reading my Harry Potter book and I'm only on page 37... Hermione is sooooo cute... heheh....&quot;<br />
<br />
Jason shrugged and pulled off his shirt, threw it on his towel and ran into the water.<br />
<br />
Jason swam a bit and got out of the water and went back to the statue. <br />
<br />
He touched it again, and felt another shock. Instantly Jason was overcome by an intense wave of pleasure as his muscles began to glow! He felt as if he was struck by an electrical charge! It felt painful but GOOD at the same time, as every muscle tensed in his body! He felt great... strong... mighty.... invincible.... POWERFUL.... As his pectorals inflated a bit, bulking out and pushing forward. His arms thickened some more, giving him the look of a gymnast. His shoulders widened and his abdominals surfaced over what used to be a flat tummy! His muscles were just ripping out of his body!!!<br />
<br />
&quot;Ohhh man, this kinda feels nice.&quot; Jason said. He looked at the changes. <br />
<br />
&quot;Whoa, this is sweet!&quot; he cried. &quot;I wonder if they'd grow more if I touched it a third time.&quot; he said and touched the statue once more.<br />
<br />
Instantly, the statue started to glow a bright blue ray of light! The light surrounded the statue, and concentrated around the legs. Then, the light burst out in electrical sparks, which struck Jason’s legs as well, jolting him slightly like electrical charges of POWER! Then, Jason looked down and saw his legs begin to glow the same blue light, as they began to thicken and expand at the same time. He moaned softly as he felt his legs fill up with the power of the Olympic gods... massive layers of muscle formed on his young, short quads, with small, thin veins covering them in order to supply the blood. His calves sprang to life, vibrating and then growing on their own, hardening and inflating like balloons, while supplying power so that Jason could now run any marathon like the wind. After a few seconds, he was a true, young muscle boy. He was no bigger or taller, but significantly more muscular than before!!!!<br />
<br />
Jason gasped, at first with pleasure as his muscles grew, then with amazement. <br />
<br />
&quot;This is so sweet!&quot; he cried and flexed each muscle on his new body. He was speechless and just enjoyed the awesome power in his body. He was wondering if he should touch the statue again. He decided on yes and touched the chest.<br />
<br />
Again, the statue began to glow, and the glow lead to the same spark. Jason got jolted in the chest, and he felt the same intense tingling through every muscle in his body. His pectorals began to push out forward and sideways, growing bigger and heavier at the same time! Jason had to hold on to the statue, to catch himself from falling over, due to the sudden increase in weight. As he looked down he could only smile, when he saw his pectorals sticking out so far, that it had become nearly impossible for him to see his own feet! Not only that, but he felt the strength in his shoulders and in his arms! He knew he could lift anything! He could bench press 300 pounds!<br />
<br />
Jason shrugged. Maybe he shouldn't have added that little bit of extra muscle. He ran back to their spot and lay down on his towel, stretched out his muscular arms behind his head and tanned.<br />
<br />
Rick was still deep in his Harry Potter book, but Rick did notice that someone finally came to lie down next to him. <br />
<br />
&quot;What took you so long, Jason? Where have you been the whole time?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jason shrugged. &quot;Just lookin' at the statue.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It only takes ten seconds to look at that statue...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well it's a very interesting statue. If you look up from the book, you may see what I mean.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rick lowered the thick book and looked down...<br />
<br />
He looked down and saw Jason... &quot;Jason? Is that you? You look weird? Is that because you're in the shadow of the umbrella?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jason stood up. &quot;No way bro! It's that statue! It adds muscle to you.&quot; he said, standing up and flexing his muscles. &quot;It's so frickin awesome!&quot;<br />
<br />
Rick's mouth dropped wide open as he gasped out loud. <br />
<br />
&quot;J-J-JASON! W-w-what the HELL happened to you??? What is this??&quot; Rick said. He almost began to tremble when he saw his little brother standing before him, showing off his bulging muscles. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh God... Oh my God... Look at you! This is crazy! How does this feel? Are you in pain? Does it hurt?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No way! It feels awesome and powerful!&quot; he said happily. &quot;Go over and touch that statue, it works, it really works.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This is amazing! This can't be real!&quot; Rick said, as he slowly got up! &quot;How can your muscles grow that fast?&quot; Rick reached out and touched Jason’s pectorals with his finger. &quot;My God.... You're as hard as a rock!&quot; Rick then walked around his brother and examined his body. He looked like a little bodybuilder! &quot;You look like you must have gained at least forty pounds of muscle!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm telling you it's that statue! It is soooo cool.&quot; he said. He grinned. &quot;And by the way, you're currently the skinniest and weakest person on the beach.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm on the track team, Jason! I can't walk around with all that muscle on my body!&quot; Rick answered. &quot;My goodness... look at you, my little brother... I wonder how heavy you are now...&quot; Rick placed his hands under Jason’s armpits and tried to lift him, but he couldn't muster the strength to get Jason off the ground. &quot;My God, you're like a ton of bricks!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jason pushed Rick off, making sure to use as little force as possible for fear of sending him too far. &quot;You’ll never manage Rick.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rick stumbled back a few steps before falling backwards and landing with his bottom on the sand. Clearly, he was startled by Jason’s sudden show of force, as he sat there, stunned in disbelief!<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh I'm sorry Rick.&quot; Jason said, helping his brother up. &quot;I didn't mean to, honestly. I guess I don't know my own strength.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I bet you're strong enough to lift me now!&quot; he said<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah probably. But I dunno if I'm tall enough to lift you straight up.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, help me up, Hercules!&quot; Rick asked his little bro.<br />
<br />
Jason shrugged and grabbed Rick under the armpits and lifted him up and over his head.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks bro...&quot; Rick said when Jason set him on his feet. &quot;That was amazing....&quot;<br />
<br />
Jason shrugged. &quot;No prob. Only problem is that my clothes are too small.&quot; he said, gesturing to his bathing suit. &quot;Got any spares?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You're gonna have to wear my clothes for now... Yeah I got some spares... my goodness what is mom gonna say when she sees you like this!&quot; Rick wondered. &quot;However, everybody else seems to think all these muscle kids are normal....&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I could probably think of why, but anyways. Do you have any spares here?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah in my bag, Jason... “Rick said as he pointed to the soft bag. He was still amazed by Jason muscular body and just stared at him in complete disbelief. His little bro had transformed into a muscle man!<br />
<br />
Jason grabbed his bag. &quot;What kind of swimsuit?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I got some swimming trunks&quot; Rick replied<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay. As long as no Speedo.&quot; Jason said as he disappeared into the washrooms.<br />
<br />
Rick just chuckled.... he still had to get used to seeing his brother like that... he was amazed... even from behind, he was perplexed by his broad shoulders and his V-form and his lats... luckily they had a great relationship as brothers, now that Jason was all buff and muscular, he wouldn't need his help for little things anymore... Now Rick would need HIS help to lift heavy stuff! Rick laughed at the thought of having to ask Jason to lift heavy stuff from now on....<br />
<br />
Jason changed and walked back out of the restroom, wearing the much larger swim shorts. Still not as loose as he'd like, but loose enough. &quot;It's so cool having these muscles. So what now?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, we'll stay for another hour, and then we'll go home... we can come back tomorrow or the day after.... You can show off your muscles to your friends at home...&quot; rick said, as he got back to his book.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now that you're all buff, you get to carry all the heavy stuff to the car, muscle man!&quot; Rick laughed out loud to his little brother.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are we leaving already?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;In a bit, Muscle-Jay!&quot; Rick teased. &quot;I still gotta drive you home, no matter how strong you are!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jason sighed. &quot;Okay, I'll go get the stuff. Can I borrow one of your shirts too?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah... as long as you don't rip out of it with those huge muscles of yours.... &quot;<br />
<br />
Jason took out one of his brother's shirts and pulled it on. It only barely fit and he pulled it off, deciding to go home bare-chested. It was clear the shirt would've ripped if he'd moved. He packed up all the stuff and easily carried it to the car then got in.<br />
<br />
Rick laughed as he carried one light bag.... he suddenly felt skinny and weak, compared to his little bro.... when he saw the statue, he stopped... he was tempted to touch it, but withdrew... &quot;Let Jason be the muscle man in the house&quot; he thought to himself. Then, the boys walked up to the car and loaded up, before they drove back home. Both of them were changed for the better that day at Sam's Beach, thanks to Ty's spell.</p>
