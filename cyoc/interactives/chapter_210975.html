<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Still stunned, Lara stared at her dripping naked body in the mirror as though looking at someone else. But it wasn’t, it was her! Grabbing a towel, Lara dried herself off.<br />
“OoooOooh!” Lara moaned as the towel rubbed against her large alien sex, unaware her sex still had a clitoris, a big sensitive one. Position and hanging above her entrance, any love-making would rub her clit if taken from behind.<br />
“Mmm…. Carl,” Lara smiled with a dumb look on her face as she vigorously rubbed her swollen clit through her towel, imagining Carl taking her roughly from behind. <br />
She would have played with herself all the way into orgasm, but as she looked at herself in the mirror, she watched as her nipples lengthened into 3-inch-long teats!<br />
“Shit!” Lara moaned as her nipples throbbed in need, begging to be played with. While they weren’t as long as her Aunt Erin’s cow teats, they were bigger than any human should have.<br />
“I have to stop,” Lara said tossing the wet and slightly soiled towel into the laundry basket and bolted down the hallway to her bedroom. Her bigger curvier body bounced and jiggled freely as she ran. If anyone was in the hallway, they would see she was changing. If not her larger size. If not her tail nub. Then her swollen cow anus, sex, and clit.<br />
Reaching her room, Lara ran for her clothes and found the loosest hanging clothes she brought with her. Her much bigger tits would not fit in her bras anymore, none of her shirts would fit. Instead, Lara elected to wear a larger loose grey sweater over her larger naked upper body. <br />
Peering down at her panties, she sighed in frustration knowing if they even fit they would be extremely uncomfortable, acting like a wedgie in her sex and butt. <br />
“I have to get something to wear over my ass. I can’t let them see this,” Lara said to herself peering down at her smaller jeans. Stepping into a pair, Lara pulled them up. They were manageable around the calves, tight against her thighs. But as she got to her ass and hips, the pants stalled pulling up.<br />
“Come on, you can fit!” Lara said wiggling her butt back and forth trying to pull her pants over her massive behind. “One… two… three!”<br />
Riiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiip<br />
Ripping down the seam, Lara stood there over her destroyed pants; her ass would not be conquered. Stepping out of the jeans, Lara turned to her last resort, a pair of stretchy sweatpants. As the pants stretched and pulled over her body, the once loose pair of sweats acted like skinny jeans hugging Lara’s body as though she was a couple sizes too big for them.<br />
“You’ll have to do,” Lara said checking herself out, able to cover all of her changes. “Shit…” Lara said as she checked herself in her mirror. While her front was passable, her sweats were so tight up against her that not only was there a visible tail bulge under the sweats, but they camel toed her sex and anus.<br />
“Maybe I can hide it… just have to be in the back of the pack the whole day,” Lara blushed though part of her was now wondering what was even the point? It was only a matter of time now, right?<br />
Stepping downstairs, Lara peered in to see that Jack, Marty and Grey had already headed outside while Carl and Clarke sat at the table reading paperwork. With Erin facing away working at the sink, Lara rushed in and planted herself in her seat with a bounce and jiggle.<br />
“Oh hello, where’s the fire,” Clarke said surprised by Lara running to her seat.<br />
“So sorry I’m late,” Lara said seeing Clarke return to his reading while Carl stared at her with an odd, worried expression. After being very intimate with Lara the day prior, he was aware of her size and physique. Not only was she wearing clothes again, but she was filling them out a lot more than her body should. He could tell just how big Lara had gotten.<br />
“Ok, Lara. Here’s your—” Erin said gasping as she turned to see Lara sitting in her seat; not fooled by her niece’s attempt to cover herself. <br />
“What?” Clarke asked.<br />
“N-nothing. I just burnt my hand is all,” Erin said playing off her shock.<br />
It appeared Lara was unable to hide her changes and she knew it. <br />
“Here’s your breakfast,” Erin said before whispering into Lara’s ears, “If you want to talk, wait til the boys are gone and we can talk.”<br />
Taking a bite from her meal, passing on any of the milk on the table, she could feel Carl’s eyes on her.<br />
“What?” Lara whispered after Clarke walked out of the kitchen and joined his younger sons in the field.<br />
“You know what. What happened?”<br />
“Nothing…” Lara said unaware that in sitting there, her now 5 inch tail nub untucked itself and hung from her ass.<br />
“Nice tail…” Carl said.<br />
With Erin already walking out of the kitchen, hearing her son say this grabbed her attention, peering down to see the cute little appendage wagging behind Lara.<br />
“Oh my gosh! Is that a tail” Erin said, immediately running to her niece’s side. <br />
“I… I…” Lara panicked, blushing in embarrassment.<br />
“Sweetie. It’s okay. You’re okay. You have nothing to be embarrassed about,” Erin said silently panicking to herself. Wondering if such a small half glass of her milk could really do all this. After being tested several times each year, she was always told how potent her unpasteurized milk was. “How could this happen?”<br />
“Am I going to… change all the way?” Lara asked no longer hiding the fact something was wrong.<br />
“I don’t know. This shouldn’t be happening from so little. I don’t understand. Did you drink anymore unpasteurized milk afterwards?”<br />
“No…”<br />
“Did you. Um… do anything with my milker machine,” Erin asked embarrassed to ask the question.<br />
“Milk my milk-less tits? No.”<br />
“I’m sorry. I’m just trying to figure out how. You haven’t been with a bull man.”<br />
“I have been with everyone on the ranch,” Lara said.<br />
“No no, I mean… been, with a bull man. Sexually,” Erin said clarifying.<br />
“No. Why?” Lara lied in a silent panic.<br />
“Hybrids are infectious with sex. Kinda like an STD. Hybrid Bull on Hybrid Cow is fine. But if a Hybrid Bull or Cow has sex with a human man or woman, they’ll infect and change them.”<br />
“Oh… good to know, for the future,” Lara continued her lie. “But even that wouldn’t transform a human all the way.”<br />
“Actually, that’s the only sure-fire way to change humans into hybrids now. But you haven’t left the ranch or been with anyone, so that’s not it.”<br />
Both Lara and Carl kept silent in a panic, knowing now exactly what was causing this change.<br />
“Maybe my body is just weak and that little glass has done this,” Lara asked.<br />
“Maybe. Oh my Sweetie. I am so so sorry. I feel horrible,” Erin sobbed.<br />
“No, Aunt Erin. It’s okay. Please don’t cry.”<br />
“Look what I did to you,” Erin continued sobbing. “MARTY! GET OUT OF THE HOUSE!” <br />
Marty, who had only just opened the door, rolled his eyes and walked back out of the house. <br />
“No it’s okay. Really. I… I was kinda thinking about, turning someday.”<br />
“What? Really?” Erin asked.<br />
“Y-yeah. I mean, I had always thought it would be cool to be a cow girl,” Lara answered, not fully the truth nor a lie. It was a notion in the back of her mind.<br />
“You aren’t upset? What about your mother?” Erin asked.<br />
“Oh my mother wrote me off the second I said bye. My father and brothers are a lot more understanding. It’s okay. This changed nothing. Just accelerated everything I guess,” Lara said before Erin grabbed and hugged her; nearly smothering Lara in her embrace.<br />
“Oh Sweetie. If you need anything at all, I’m here. I’m gonna be right here for you the whole time. You aren’t alone,” Erin said pulling back before hugging her again.<br />
“I know… thanks… please… air,” Lara gasped as Erin let go.<br />
“You don’t have to work today. Carl, go tell your father that Lara is off today. If he isn’t happy, tell him to talk to me alone.” Erin said before urging Lara. “Go up stairs, Sweetie. No wonder you’re wearing clothes again. It must feel like going through puberty again, your body doing things you don’t understand.”<br />
“Maybe a little,” Lara said, not wanting to slack off, but also not wanting to work in the fields with her body still growing so foreign to her.<br />
“Go, I’ll go into town and get you some larger clothes,” Erin said understanding what Lara was going through. She also knew Lara was now going to become another resident on the ranch. Now a hybrid in the making, Lara could never return to Mars until laws changed. She was here to stay as long as she wanted or needed. She was family after all.<br />
With her aunt walking out of the house, Lara turned to Carl.<br />
“You go too. I’m not walking up that stairway for you to gawk what you did to my sex,” Lara said angerly.<br />
“What? I didn’t know this would happen,” Carl argued.<br />
“Really?” Lara said with narrowing eyes.<br />
“Yeah! I don’t see humans often, let alone… doing stuff with them,” Carl said in a hushed tone.<br />
“So… this is just as a surprise? You promise?” Lara asked, easing up.<br />
“Yes! If I did I would have stopped you.”<br />
“Really?”<br />
“Well stopped to tell you… if you continued, then maybe not,” Carl said truthfully.<br />
“So this is it huh? I’m gonna turn into a Cow Hybrid like your mom?”<br />
“I guess.”<br />
“You aren’t gonna stop… seeing me, right?” Lara asked blushing again.<br />
“Are you serious?” Carl asked. “You are transforming, and you still want… that?”<br />
“Girl’s have needs too! And besides, the damage is done. Whether we… again, or not. And I’ve been, in need lately,” Lara said batting her eyes back and forth between the table and Carl’s eyes.<br />
“Well, it was amazing. If… if you’re okay with it. Then, yeah… we can still, you know.”<br />
“Even going further?”<br />
Carl blushed, wondering in his head if she just asked about having full on sex together.<br />
“What? Needs. Is that too much for you?” Lara asked.</p>
