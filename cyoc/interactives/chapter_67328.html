<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">For Joseph Patten.  Saturday the 25th of January 2013 was a lot better than the Saturday of three weeks previous.  The cold and wind had been bad enough, but the intense snowfall was the killer.  Sadly, reports later on had showed that that last part had been too literal.  The only reason he had been able to risk using his car at all was because of its make.  Audi A4, with 4 Wheel Drive.  And even then, he had never dared to take it over 25mph on most of the roads, the only time being when he had to head into Kalipell for the shopping run, and that time, even on the long straights, 40mph was never reached.  Now, the worst of the snow had been cleared, most of the roads were now gritted.  So things were safer than they were a short time ago.  <br />
<br />
Other events, though, were much more encouraging.  He had noticed that Molly seemed to be feeling ill in the mornings at school - as did the rest of the Staff - though she never allowed the students to see it.  That would likely mean that she was now pregnant, and would likely become a mother by the Summer if the information was accurate.  That was certainly be something to look forward to.  And after everything they had been through, they deserved some real joy in their lives.  <br />
<br />
Seriously, after everything they'd been through.  Starting with attempted kidnapping of Molly and a forced change through the Animatrix Serum.  From there, she'd been rejected by her parents - or so he heard, it wasn't something he planned on bringing up - after she and George had moved to Columbia Falls to try and start their lives anew where she could have some space to herself, Pierre Beauregard began a vicious racist campaign against her for the singular reason that she refused to be his hunting dog.  When she was hired as a Teacher's Aide, he moved his racist campaign there, going all-out to try and pry her away from her job.  Next he set up R.A.M. - Ranchers Against Molly - to unite the town against Molly, and tricked herself and George into thinking that her Uncle was a part of it, driving a damaging wedge between them, that nearly worked.  It was only after a failed attempt to kill Leon - then Leona - that his true colours began to become clear.  The subsequent investigation revealed his extremist views, and that he had fleeced a lot of people of their money.  Lots of it.  His attempt to kill Officers Barnes and Wayne failed when Frank Rhoer stopped him long enough to force his arrest, the trial sending him to jail for the remainder of his life.  R.A.M.s true colours were exposed and it was put in the same league as the KKK, and it quickly fell apart.  This wasn't the end though.  Even though Beauregard was gone, his work still needed to be dismantelled.  Mainly in the school where Bill Williams and Wayne Hireman were continuing to enact Bearegard's policies, even after she saved the life of Megan Jenkins.  <br />
<br />
This was where he had blown it.  Going against every grain of common sense, he launched one hell of a tirade against George Wayne.  In retrospect, this was a massive blunder on his part, because when Tabitha Choir ran against him for the position of School SuperIntendant, Hireman revealved that he had recorded the whole thing and used it against not only George, but Molly as well.  This was what forced him to face up to his stupidity there, and try to make amends for his actions.  It began to work.  After the rocky start, Tabitha began to climb in the Polls, and seriously threaten Hireman's position.  And as the election drew closer, he became increasingly desperate, as each layer of lie and deceit fell down, one at a time.  He sank to a new low as he used a meeting between George and Amy which was supposed to be private as yet another weapon.  This resulted in Amy revealing her sexuality to everyone to dismantle that lie - at a cost.  Kicked out of her own home, and assaulted in school, requiring weeks of recuperation.  This was what cost Hireman the election as Tabitha took her new position in a Landslide Win, one that the whole country knew about, given how politically charged it had become.  And now it appeared that Hireman had cut his losses and left town, rather than complete the end of his term.  <br />
<br />
It was only now, some two years later that they could finally settle down properly and have a family of their own, which left them with some more, 'mundane', problems.  Specifically needing a new car, to carry themselves and their children in the years to come.  He'd heard about the Chevy Furtopia, which was essentially a large box on an SUV Chassis, and knew about the modified HiAce and Transit.  He guessed that having the greatest payload - up to 4,500Kg (9,900lb) - widest wheelbase and best diesel engine, a 230hp 3.0l V6 twin-turbo - one they'd actually developed for Jaguar/Land Rover back when they still owned them, but carried over to the Transit - they'd most likely go for that one, though he couldn't know for sure.  Though the nearest Ford Dealer would probably only have a showroom model available until it was released for sale in about 4 weeks time - something he only learned 10 minutes before - with advance orders available right now for a discount.  <br />
<br />
The most interesting development in regards to the Animatrix Serum - for now at least - was that enough interest had built up for a series documenting their lives to be developed.  The first one involving a couple who were now a mix of Human and Gila Monster Lizard living in Spain, a country who's economy was finally on the mend, it's structural weaknesses finally being resolved with vigour.  What really caught his attention was that the Gila woman still had size 38D breasts.  According to the info, that was primarily down to the fact that they used to be dangerously large - well into the Gs - before, and had been wrecking her back, though she apparently had other reasons as well.  But it wouldn't show until Wednesday evening with a repeat on Saturday evening.  He'd definately be watching it.  Though he wondered if George and Molly would as well.  He supposed he could always ask them later.</p>
