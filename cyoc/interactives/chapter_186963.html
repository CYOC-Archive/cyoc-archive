<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Spying on Will was something that thrilled Megan to no end. The thought of haunting Will like a ghost seemed like the perfect prank. Or, even better, watching him go through a full day at work, none the wiser that his girlfriend was watching him. She tried to think of other scenarios to try, but she knew this was only distracting herself from the real reason she wanted to spy on Will.<br />
<br />
It gnawed on her mind a lot, the thought of Will leaving her. Ever since he moved into this house bad thoughts kept her up at night. Will was now, in all respects, a wealthy man. He could afford class, he could afford luxury, and he could afford a woman better than Megan. It would be so easy for him to just leave her in the dust and run off into the sunset with a sexy rich girl. Conjuring these nightmares was enough to bring her nearly to tears. She wanted to just leave herself as is for now, to see what Will would do on a night without her around. Plus, hitting save would allow her to do a test run for a longer experience of stalking her boyfriend.<br />
<br />
Her mind was made. She clicked Save, and the count down on the screen seemed to have extended from 50 minutes to a full 4 hours. The coolness she felt before came again, but this time it felt more like a strong wind than a light breeze. A popup on the screen said, ‘Transformation extended. Automatic reversion in 04:00:00.’ Megan reached for the mouse to close the popup, only to find she never made contact. Thinking she just couldn’t keep track of where her hand was, she tried waving it up and down, but when she collided with the desk no sound was made. Sliding her hand around, her fingers finally collided with the mouse. When she tried to move it though, her hand seemed to just pass right through.<br />
<br />
Shocked, Megan pushed against the edge of the desk to get up out of her chair. But again, her hands just passed right through. Her stomach twisted into a not. The sound of her heart was all she could hear. She grew dizzy thinking about what just happened. Not only could she not be seen, she could not be touched, or heard, or felt. In her panic, she stood up, phasing right through the desk which now stood at her waist. There were no longer dimples in the carpet when she walked around. Megan fell to her knees with her hands on her head. She screamed at the top of the lungs.<br />
<br />
She could feel the vocal cords splinter, her lungs contract, the tears run down her face, but no sound could be heard. The air was unchanged, the dust unruffled, the house undisturbed. <br />
<br />
It took several minutes for Megan to put herself back together. The Chronivac said 4 hours, so the torment of nonexistence would only be for a little while. She could still walk; she just couldn’t stomp. Looking at the time left, the Chonivac said, ‘03:44:27’. Megan stood up and walked to the office door. The nob could not be turned, so Megan thought this would be the perfect time to test the extent of her curse. She closed her eyes and took a step strait though the door. When she opened them again, she was in the den, proving that her mobility was unchanged. Water was running upstairs; Will seemed to be taking a shower. Megan decided to investigate, to see how the curse affected her interactions with people. <br />
<br />
She thought it was funny that she could phase through walls to get into the master bedroom. Finally, she was able to make light of her current predicament. Entering the bathroom, she got to see Will, in all his naked glory. She tried to touch him, but once again passed right through. Megan decided to entertain herself by making suggestive moves around him, laughing at his obliviousness. His tight muscles and thick hair were just part of the reason she fell for him. She couldn’t help finding it a little kinky, the idea of getting off while completely invisible.<br />
<br />
Before she could finish her fantasy, Will finished his shower. Megan stopped daydreaming when Will got out, passing right through her. He began to dress in business casual office attire, instead of his night clothes. This came as a surprise to Megan. She couldn’t reason why he would dress for work so late in the evening. But watching him get ready was not the most concerning part. Will pulled out his cell phone and tried calling Megan. Her phone silently buzzed in her purse, still stuffed in a chair at the dining table. Megan felt so guilty watching his worried face when he no answer even after the third try. Will went over to the nightstand and grabbed something small and stuffed it into his pocket. He was so quick about it that Megan didn’t get the chance to see what.<br />
<br />
Will walked downstairs and sat in the den, staring at the clock. Megan couldn’t tell if it was water droplets or sweat, but something was dripping off Will’s sideburns. Megan sat next to him, leaving no indent on the couch. She tried to wrap her hand around his, but it just passed right through. The two sat there in silence for excruciatingly long minutes. The moment was ended when the doorbell rang, echoing through the house.<br />
<br />
Will went to answer, and Megan followed. She thought it best to stay close by, even if she couldn’t be seen. There on the doorstep stood a woman taller than Megan. Her heart sank as she looked over the proportions of Will’s guest. The curves of that woman went on for ages. Her face looked refined, clearly made up before coming here. Long blond hair cascaded into a waving stream down her back. Arm were thin like twigs, making what came between them look all the more voluptuous. Firm, hearty, colossal breasts hung from her chest, forcing her dress shirt to stretch when it pulled in towards her narrow waist. A tight pencil skirt closed tightly around her hips enclosing her ample underside in soft canvas. Her legs, much like her arms, were long and slender. Thin, tan pantyhose wrapped around her as they entered the grey heels that rested on her feet. To Megan this woman more pretty, more mature, and more sophisticated than she could ever hope to be.<br />
<br />
It made more sense for Will to be getting dressed up for a guest, but hearing Will invite her in made her feel crushed. “Hey Amy. Megan’s out right now, hopefully we can get this done before she gets back.” As Amy walked in, she passed right through Megan, still frozen in the doorway. She looked up in awe at the gorgeous interior, then turned her head sideways giving Will a seductive glare. Will looked nervous as her closed the door behind her. He lead Amy to the den, where She took a seat on the couch. All the while Megan stood there staring daggers into her soul. She was everything Megan feared in a neat little package and stuffed into a blazer that was just a little too tight. Will walked towards the kitchen, “I’ll get us some drinks, then we can begin.”<br />
<br />
He was nervous, getting caught up on which drink would be best for this event. Amy snuck in as Will wondered through cabinets looking for glasses. She wrapped her arms around him, pressing her braless chest into his back. A shiver went up Will’s spin as he turned around. His face was completely red. Amy stood back as he reached into his pocket and pulled out-</p>
