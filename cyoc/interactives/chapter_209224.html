<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Thanks to Rawr7 as well, been fun working back and forth. Done with setup on both our ends and things are going to be more direct from here.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">He’s right, humans in game are weaker than any other race. Vargruf seems like a rough guy, but dwarves aren’t too bad. I could use the extra health, natural crafting, and bonuses to my defences. But also, just looking at Martin lets me know something’s wrong. He&#39;s muttering about the clan, work orders, and glancing at his new bosses heavy gut. I don’t know how much longer he’ll be Martin, and if I become a dwarf I’ll just end up like that too. I have a sudden idea, an offer that no leader would ever refuse.<br />
<br />
“I overheard Mugrel, he’s planning to betray you all. You’re too busy crafting to put up a fight, he’ll sneak in and make a bunch of new werewolves. But if I beat him in game and break the curse, then he’s just another human you can add to the clan. Turn the tables and get a new guild member.”<br />
“Aye? So how’re ya, a level 15 adventurer, a human, goin’ ta beat him.”<br />
“I won’t need to. Just find a group of strong players that want the bounty. Party up, beat the wolf, and you’ll get first dibs on his body.”<br />
“... Still cannae trust ya, but you’re more trustworthy than a werewolf. Besides, no leader worth his salt would pass up the offer to get a rival turned into a clansman.”<br />
<br />
Was it a deal? The dwarf just keeps staring at me after saying that. My attempts to respond reduced to light murmurs. Why was I so afraid? My bracelet far tighter than before, reminding me of just how much weaker I was compared to Vargruf. Giving me the clear reason to be scared, as this dwarf could do whatever he wanted to me, and I’d have no chance to escape.<br />
<br />
“Ya still here?” I shuffled back, not expecting his rough voice. “Go! Get ya warriors!”<br />
<br />
That was reason enough for me to leave. I climbed the ladder and returned to the school. Backing out of the janitors closet and checking the clock on the far end wall. The jet black hands letting me know there’s still another 30 minutes left for lunch. I could get this done, but it had to be quick. I needed warriors, and more importantly, a way to resist the bracelet.<br />
<br />
Martin was reduced to a fat farmer and then a burly dwarf thanks to his bracelet. Plus I had already felt it trying to influence me several times. It all made sense when I thought about it, and thought about how the device had just tried to get me to accept this new reality. But while it was broken I could resist it, and now that it’s repaired that resistance is slipping.<br />
<br />
Just looking around the hall everything was off. I saw the texture of bright green grass, still fresh with the morning dew clipping past the smooth tiled floor of the hall. The classrooms a blur behind greystone structures, rugged brickwork held together by white cement. Smoke pouring out of the chimney, and shopkeep singing a merry tune. It was the town of Fielbrooke, the starter town, and it seemed so real.<br />
<br />
I thought about smacking my hand against a locker to break the device. But the mere idea was met with a sudden light-headedness. It was fighting back, and I was powerless alone. I needed a hand, and that help could only be provided by one group. The computer club.<br />
<br />
Supported by the wall, I pushed myself to their  club room. It was only a bit down the hall, the illusion of VR now fully gone as I’m treated to the rows of steel lockers and rowdy students.  Finally reaching their base, poster of Reborn Venture smack dab in the middle of the yellow door. Obscuring the window as I have no choice but to open the door and check what’s inside. They might be worse than the werewolves, but they’re also my only chance.<br />
<br />
The computer club was organised to be more like a seedy bar. The windows blackened with rows of paper. Tables pushed to the back of the room to form a single line. Computers active and running Reborn Venture, no that’s not quite right. They’re connected to the students bracelets, and it seems like they’re hacking into the devices. A few of the students running scripts on either the computers or their own laptops. Others gathered to a side corner where the IT teacher hands out drinks. One of the student’s looking over to me and  marching across. He’s a big guy, just like Sam with that barbarian build. Broad chest contained by a white and teal polo shirt. Short sleeved to show his arms which are covered in black hairs. Firm body complemented by beige cargo pants, a clear bulge alerting me to a girthy cock underneath. Black and Blue sneakers securely fitting on his colossal feet as I look up to meet his gruff expression. Brows bushy and thick, hair cut short, partially receding and showing several wrinkles on his forehead. Mouth covered in light stubble, the man easily a good three feet taller than me. <br />
<br />
He couldn’t be human, and now that I realised that, I spotted that same phasing effect around the other students. They weren’t young kids, they were adults of all sorts of races. From fairies to elves to minotaurs to  everything else. I couldn’t focus on their finer details, but I could at least get the basic idea of who they were.<br />
<br />
“You lost?” The half-giant by my side asked. I sensed curiously behind his question, and I couldn’t decide if that was a good or bad thing.<br />
“No, came here because I needed help. I’m taking down Mugrel, and to do that I need my bracelet hacked.”<br />
<br />
The half giant stifled a laugh. Holding back for a good few seconds before bursting out and starting to wheeze. The brute bending down to compose himself, trying to process what he heard, as I try to stay and look as cool as possible. <br />
<br />
“You? Really? Hold on a sec.” He grabs a VR device from the nearby bench. Popping it on as more eyes in the room turn to me. It’s starting to get embarrassing, made even worse when he suddenly puts the headset off.<br />
“Jeremy, level 15, adventurer. Poor dungeon DPS. Was infected with lycanthropy. That’s you. Right?”<br />
<br />
There was more chuckles around the room. Other students giggling at the mockery that was going on. I couldn’t just leave though. If I didn’t get my bracelet adjusted, then I was screwed.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, that’s me. I also cured the lycanthropy and have managed to stay a human. Better than all of you I think.”<br />
There was a few oohs and aahs from the crowd. The half giant’s hand resting on his chin as he deliberates something.<br />
“Got balls, I’ll give you that. Takes them to walk into the Far Seers lair.”<br />
<br />
My eyes went wide with disbelief. The Far Seers are a guild that anyone would know. Notorious for breaking the games code day 1, and datamining all the future patches up until the first planned expansion. They’ve gotten weapons that don’t even exist, ran unfinished content, and never been banned. With their power they could ruin the games economy or rule over the ordinary players, but for some reason they don’t. There’s also not many other hacking groups besides them, and any other guild that acts up and tries to ruin things is put in their place by the Far Seers.<br />
<br />
“I-I-“ He brings a finger to my lips, silencing me. “Don’t believe me? Look.”<br />
He slips over his headset. The screen displaying far too much information for me to take in. An inventory filled with the endgame gear for every class. Bright orange borders outlining each item. Admin panel opened at the side with a log of inputs to spawn in items. Exp and level overflowing, health and mana so large that they move off the screen. I manage to get a few more bits of information before the helmet is popped off. Name, class, and race all known to be as I take a step back and put on my bravest face.<br />
<br />
“Well, good to meet you Narjak. I’m guessing you had to cheat to survive the rough sex of a giant?” <br />
He smirks.<br />
“Maybe. You want to find out?”<br />
“I think I’m good, bracelet has to get fixed first. So can you help me with that or not?”<br />
“Could. But should I?”<br />
“You said I’ve got balls.”<br />
He shrugs.<br />
“Did. But we want our fun too.”<br />
I try to ignore whatever implications his response might have, glancing down at his hardening cock. It’s as thick as my wrist, and causes me to clearly blush. The half-giant leaning closer as I push back on his hardy chest. The brute smirking, giving me a cheeky wink as I look away. <br />
“So what do you want to do then?”<br />
“Nothing, just watch.”<br />
<br />
What does he mean by that? Didn’t he just come onto me? Though maybe that was a trick. Maybe he wanted to break me in or do something devious, he is a hacker after all. All eyes were on me, as I mustered up the courage to continue.<br />
<br />
“What’s just watch? You’re wanting to watch me?”<br />
“Mhm. We don’t like altering things. It’s fun watching players work out the game. It’s fun watching a human struggle.”<br />
The schoolbell rings, signalling the end of lunch as the other members of the club spill out of the room.<br />
“See me at the end of the day. You still human, I’ll hack your bracelet. Leave the school, and we’ll see if you can survive a giants cock.”<br />
<br />
Then he leaves with the rest, as I’m forced to accept this new challenge.</p>
