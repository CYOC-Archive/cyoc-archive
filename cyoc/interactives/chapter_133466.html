<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>A timeline split from <a href="/interactives/chapter_133449.html">#133449</a> </div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Sharon knew she only had a few moments to think of a way out of this situation. She knew if Ric caught, then her becoming that woman Shari was sure to follow. She wasn&#39;t going to let the voice win, but what to do? She looked around, spying a luxury car parked in front of the building and it sparked something in her mind. It was a crazy plan, but one that might work.  She couldn&#39;t get away from here, but another her might be able to. <br />
<br />
Taking a deep breath, Sharon placed her hands on the fancy car, trying to imagine what kind of straight woman might drive it. Holding onto that thought, she gave one of her breasts a firm squeeze, and sent a jolt of arousal through her body. The tingle raced from head to toe, and she could feel the change beginning....<br />
<br />
=====<br />
<br />
Now less winded, Ric started to move towards the woman that something in his mind was telling him was Shari, despite a bunch of visual evidence to the contrary. Okay, maybe this lady was wearing some of her clothes but that was it! Still, he needed to get rid of the last bit of that fag Eric, and any port in a storm would do...<br />
<br />
As he came up from behind her, the gym jock paused in his tracks, his eyes glued to her as there came a rapid and sudden expansion of Sharon&#39;s ass! The swelling buttocks strained against her borrowed jogging pants, as the cheeks grew rounder and rounder. There came a ripping sound as twin slits split the sides of the pants, revealing the longer and toned legs with thickened thighs underneath. The now torn tubes began fusing down the middle, becoming two long rectangles that joined at her widening hips, forming the lower half of a developing dress. In process, the dark lycra material gave way to lavender silk.<br />
<br />
Inside her mind, Sharon could feel herself starting to lose control to the growing persona bubbling up, and had to bite back on her fear of this.  She could feel the sense of entitlement and disdain this woman had not just for homosexuals, but anyone she considered below her status and wealth.  She might have smiled, but instead, the weakening lesbian decided to focus on making sure a part of her still existed in this homophobic socialite&#39;s subconscious.<br />
<br />
Now the changes moved upwards, and began pulling the hoodie Sharon has swiped into different directions. The sleeves rolled themselves up into non-existence, leaving her smooth and toned arms exposed.  At the end of those limbs, resting on the hood of the luxury car,  her hands became daintier as fingernails grew out by inches and gained coating of purple polish. Meanwhile, the front began to seal itself back up, with the zipper pulling itself free. One row of the teeth split into two portions that wrapped around her wrists, becoming braided gold chains.  The other row looped around her slenderizing neck, growing into a thick loop of gold. <br />
<br />
Unnoticed for the moment, the hood fell off, hitting the ground with a surprisingly solid thud. The cotton soon gave away to black leather, as gold clasps sprang out to lock it into a squarish shape. Its drawstring slid out, and began flattening into a wide strap of leather that attached itself to the developing purse.  The empty space inside didn&#39;t remain that way as a thick wallet popped into existence, joined by numerous items of make-up.  The final item was a top-of-the-line smartphone, decked out in faux jewels and gold. <br />
<br />
More and more, the mind of the socialite Charise became clearer as Sharon&#39;s attraction shifted from women to men. But she still had high standards for her partners, as someone like her couldn&#39;t just sleep with anyone. As if in response to this, various rings of gold and silver with embedded jewels popped into place on her fingers, splayed out on the hood of a car that she suddenly knew was hers.<br />
<br />
Pressure sudden built up on her chest as the vanishing lesbian&#39;s small breasts expanded outwards! The growth of her tits from b-cups into full c&#39;s caused a long v to rip down the front of her dress, revealing where the two orbs touch. As its lower hem melded with the skirt, its back vanished as the material flowed to reinforce the lavender silk holding back her impressive rack.  Nearby, Ric had to restrain himself from trying to grab them, not sure who this woman was, only that she definitely was not Shari!<br />
<br />
As the car she stood in front of began undergoing its own changes to better suit its new owner, the transformation began to make itself known all over the almost gone Sharon&#39;s head. Her short brown hair exploded into a mass of long black curls that reached past her shoulders. As an unseen force began piling them back up on top, her lips were plumping up under a coating of lavender lipstick, while her jaw rounded itself out a bit. Cheekbones rose up, while her nose shrank a bit and turned upwards.  Her eyebrows plucked themselves into arched perfection, while long, luscious lashes pushed out over eyes that flashed from brown to cool emerald green. Finally, a layer of foundation smoothed out any remaining blemishes, bringing her face into perfect alignment with the rest of herself.<br />
<br />
An annoyed Charise turned towards the oogling Ric, her full lips curled in disdain at his sloppy appearance. She did appreciate his physique but something about him screamed lower class. And that groin of his? It was so gay! She reached down for her purse, not see as her sneakers completed their twisting to a set of pumps that matched her dress. Keys in hand, she started to walk around the now all purple convertible sports car.<br />
<br />
&quot;He..hey, baby! Where are you going?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;First, I am not your baby. Second, none of your business!&quot;<br />
<br />
With that, the socialite snob Charise slammed her door closed,  and started the engine. The car lingered for a moment, before pulling away into traffic. Left behind was a gobsmacked Ric, who wasn&#39;t sure what to do now.  He had wanted to do it with his babe Shari, but now maybe he needed to find another woman...<br />
<br />
The voice meanwhile seethed at the escape of Sharon. True, she had become another homophobic stereotype, but not the one it wanted her to become! Its power was still limited, so it needed her to surrender to Shari. It would have to find her later, once its strength had grown again. That lesbian was going to be dangerous if allowed to run free...</p>
