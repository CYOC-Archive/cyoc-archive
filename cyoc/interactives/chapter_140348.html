<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Sara felt the blood rushing in her veins and she felt alive. She had lost her weapon  when she threw it at one enemy to save another first year and was using the claws she had. They were proving to be very effective, but she would have much preferred an actual weapon. Her hair was wildly swinging as she clawed at a large black furred opponent, cutting deep into its chest. It snarled and tried to bite down on her hand before she pulled away and countered with a kick to its jaw. As it staggered backwards Sara surged forward and plunged both sets into its chest, one set striking the heart, the other possibly a lung. It dropped to the ground and Sara looked for her next enemy. Through the fighting Sara saw a lone figure in gold and red armour fighting frantically with a grey and black werewolf. The figure lost its footing and fell backwards. Sara rushed to the elf guard&#39;s aid, dodging the fighting she passed. She full on tackled the beast to the ground with both claws striking vital organs as they hit the ground. As Sara tried to pull her stuck claws out she saw another jumping in the air towards her prone body. She swiped with her tail as hard as she could, knocking the werewolf aside, but feeling one claw rake along a section of her tail as it hit. She sensed something and felt a presence approaching, something massive and dangerous. A loud howl rang out across the battlefield, followed by the cracking and splintering sounds of wood breaking. Sara and many others looked to the northern tree line. The trees were pushed aside to make room for the bulk of a massive white werewolf. The creature stood close to 15 feet tall hunched over. Its claws like swords slashing at a tree in the way, sending splinters flying in all directions. She heard Gorg&#39;s bellowing voice above the sounds of battle, &quot;KILL IT! KILL THE ALPHA!&quot; Arrows began to fly through the air from above and the flanks toward the towering monstrosity. In retaliation it grabbed a nearby tree it had knocked over and threw it in the air hitting 3 flyers at once. The tree and the flyers hit the ground in the midst of the fighting, killing or injuring both defenders and attackers indiscriminately. She turn to see the claws begin to swipe down on her front the werewolf that had snuck up on her. She braced herself for the impact, closing her eyes in defense. When the pain never came she opened her eyes. There was Jack standing tall. He had removed the monster&#39;s head with the kopesh he had bought. &quot;You 2 alright?&quot;<br />
The female elf only nodded and got to her feet, &quot;your timing is fortuitous, thank you,&quot; she half bowed.<br />
&quot;Thanks for the save Jack,&quot; breathed Sara. <br />
&quot;No problem. Well except for that thing,&quot; he pointed to the giant werewolf stomping into the fight. <br />
&quot;We&#39;ll make due. Jack! Your chest,&quot; Sara pointed to the deep bleeding gouges in his chest. Jack just shrugged. &quot;How can you be so calm...when...you....&quot; Sara noticed the cuts beginning to knit together, closing the wound.<br />
&quot;Surprise,&quot; said Jack halfheartedly.<br />
They heard more werewolves approaching them and readied themselves.<br />
<br />
Vect was rushing through the melee in a blur, cutting monsters down before they knew he was there. True the blade was cumbersome at times, but it was cleaving through the attackers like butter.  He was sure of it now though, through the blood and gore Vect could see the blade was shinier than before. The viscera had begun to smoke as though  being burned off, like what silver does to a werewolf. &#39;Its changed from steel to silver. The rune on the back is glowing dimly. So that&#39;s what it does.&#39;  Vect spotted the merchant from the east weaving into and out of the battle with twin scimitars flashing in the moonlight. What caught his attention was the pair flanking him on either side. Vect poured on the speed, closing the distance. He called out for the merchant to duck and tightened his muscles as he threw the large sword in a horizontal spin. The merchant must have heard him because he dropped prone just in time for the blade to half one at the waist and embed itself in the gut of the next. It staggered and fell backwards, leaving the handle sticking up in the air. A few moments later Vect arrived to wrench it free. Panting, Vect offered a hand to the merchant. The merchant began to laugh as he was helped to his feet. &quot;Many thanks to you, my savior. Faran Rakin at your service my....&quot; he was interrupted when Vect pushed him aside to swing his weapon one handed at the ambusher, removing its head in the process. &quot;Perhaps I should thank you after we kill these curs,&quot; suggested the merchant. They nodded and resumed the battle.  He saw a pair of veteran students get overwhelmed, &quot;this has to end now, but how?&quot; Just then Vect caught something hurdling through the air at the alpha werewolf. <br />
<br />
Lelu was enjoying testing out Jack&#39;s gift on an actual battlefield. She had somehow edged her way over to where Gorg, Salazar, and another dragon druid was fighting. She witnessed Salazar grab a werewolf by the throat in one large hand and breathe a thick cloud of poison gas on its face, practically melting half of it from the sheer toxicity. The other&#39;s horn was crackling with electricity, then they let loose a series of lightning bolts at the werewolves, flash frying 5 and dropping 3 more. Gorg was laughing maniacally as he waded through the battle, clearly enjoying himself. In the distance Lelu saw the alpha werewolf swinging down at the battle, sending both friend and foe flying off in either direction. <br />
&quot;Gorg, we&#39;ve got to kill that thing.&quot;<br />
&quot;Ah know that. But we can&#39;t get near it through the fight.&quot;<br />
&#39;If I can get on it, it might not be able to fend me off.&#39;<br />
&quot;How far can you throw?&quot;<br />
&quot;Enough.&quot;<br />
&quot;Toss me.&quot;<br />
&quot;Kay.&quot;<br />
&#39;Didn&#39;t have to convince him&#39;<br />
Gorg dropped both weapons and grabbed Lelu&#39;s feet suddenly and began to spin faster and faster. &#39;This was a bad idea&#39;, thought Lelu repeatedly as the spinning got faster and faster. Then he let go and Lelu was sailing through the air towards the alpha. She held out her bracers and when she reached the target, used both to keep from sliding off. The creature tried to look at her but couldn&#39;t turn its head downward enough. Lelu began to use the bracers like climbing tools and scaled the beast quickly, dodging the claw that tried to scrape her off. She soon reached the neck and began to tear into it. Cutting deeper as fast as she could. A massive paw nearly crushed her, but she scrambled to the opposite side. Now she had it&#39;s full attention. She jumped up and jabbed both into its eye, causing it to grab its ruined eye in pain, missing Lelu again. Casting a shrink spell, she then lept into the ear and worked her way down striking anything that might be important. Nearing the skull, she picked a spot and hammered away at it repeatedly, using mana to boost the impacts like she was trained. Howling could be heard outside her haven, as well as desperate scratching trying to get to her. Lelu heard a crack beneath her, the bone had been broken where she had cut away at the flesh. She opened it wider and then, with all her might pushed inwards to reach the brain. Once inside, Lelu returned to her normal height and proceeded to let loose on its brain. Blood was everywhere, she was pretty sure she had accidentally drank some from the coppery taste in her mouth. Her world tilted suddenly and Lelu felt the impact. She gathered what mana she had left and sent a blast of magic into the bone near her, breaking it apart to reveal the first light of day.<br />
<br />
Everyone saw the alpha fall to the ground dead and cheered. The wolves began to fold, their attacks drastically lessened and slowed. But they were still deadly as one first year could see as it bit down on his shoulder. Sara made a mental note to clean her nails thoroughly after this was over. Suddenly a burning in her leg caused her to look down to see one she thought was dead sink its teeth into her leg. She lost her footing and stumbled backwards. Another heavily damaged werewolf raised its claw to finish her but a flash of movement blocked the strike. His sword was missing, but Sara couldn&#39;t mistake the outline of Vect. He stumbled sideways and fell. Vect heard an ear piercing scream and then saw a bloody pulp fall a few feet away. The burning in his chest ebbed away and then ceased. Then all he saw was darkness.</p>
