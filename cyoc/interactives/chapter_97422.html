<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Nate took his show and Eric laid in bed, staring at the ceiling and doing some heavy thinking, his cellphone rang.<br />
Taking it out of his pants pocket, there was a smile on his face. Caller ID said it was Julie. &quot;Hello,&quot; he said, unable to keep the happiness out of his voice over talking to her again.<br />
&quot;Hi yourself,&quot; said Julie. &quot;How&#39;s it going?&quot;<br />
Eric thought about that for a second and replied, &quot;Not bad, all things considered.&quot;<br />
&quot;Yeah. I bet you&#39;re worried with Yvette still being on the loose.&quot;<br />
&quot;Kind of,&quot; admitted Eric, &quot;but I&#39;m sure the police will arrest her again in time.&quot;<br />
&quot;Last I overheard from my dad&#39;s side of the conversation when they called him earlier with an update, she&#39;s been leading them on quite a chase around the shores of Moon Lake, but no luck yet.&quot;<br />
&quot;That&#39;s too bad, but like I said, I&#39;m sure they&#39;ll get her in time and then they&#39;ll make sure she pays for her crimes.&quot; <i>Especially those against my family,</i> thought Eric. Then he paused before saying, &quot;I was wondering about something.&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes?&quot; said Julie, not knowing what could be on his mind.<br />
Eric paused again before asking, &quot;How do you feel about me?&quot;<br />
<br />
The silence before Julie spoke again seemed a lot longer than the few seconds it actually was, and every moment it continued made Eric fear her reply would not be favorable. Then Julie said, &quot;I like you.&quot;<br />
Eric didn&#39;t realize he had been holding his breath until he let it out at hearing her response. &quot;I like you too.&quot; Then there was another awkward silence before he asked, &quot;I was wondering if maybe, that is, if you don&#39;t have any other plans that is...&quot;<br />
&quot;Eric Anderson, are you trying to ask me out on a date?&quot; asked Julie in return.<br />
&quot;Err, yes,&quot; said Eric, keeping his fingers crossed.<br />
&quot;I&#39;d love too,&quot; replied Julie, to which Eric could not help smiling about again, but his mood was shattered when she added, &quot;However, I do think we should wait until that stupid werevixen is back in jail.&quot;<br />
&quot;Why?&quot; asked Eric.<br />
&quot;Nobody&#39;s explained things to you?&quot; asked Julie in disbelief.<br />
&quot;Explained what?&quot; Eric asked in return.<br />
&quot;There are three ways a normal human can become a were. Sex is the most pleasurable. Normal stuff like holding hands or kissing won&#39;t do it, but a bite or scratch from a were can change a person too.&quot;<br />
&quot;Meaning?&quot; asked Eric, sitting up and wondering what was going on.<br />
&quot;From what I hear, this Yvette is crazy for your dad and will do almost anything to get him back with her,&quot; said Julie. &quot;You already know that becoming a werefox wasn&#39;t his idea. Whether accidentally or on purpose, Yvette scratched him while trying to rape him in the campus parking lot. That&#39;s when your dad started becoming a werefox, although he didn&#39;t complete the process until—&quot;<br />
&quot;I get the idea,&quot; said Eric, interrupting her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, the authorities are afraid that, as part of whatever scheme she might come up with in a stupid attempt to try to win him back, Yvette might try to kidnap you. One bite or scratch and...&quot;<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll become a werefox too,&quot; realized Eric.<br />
&quot;I&#39;m afraid so,&quot; confirmed Julie.<br />
Eric thought about it for a moment, and then asked, &quot;What if I become a were before she attempts anything?&quot; remembering part of the reason why his mother became a werecat.<br />
&quot;Well...&quot; began Julie on the other end of the phone, wondering exactly how to answer that, &quot;once you are a were, that&#39;s it. You can never become another were, even if a different were wants you to. And if you&#39;re thinking what I think you might be thinking, <b>don&#39;t!</b>&quot; said Julie sternly. &quot;I like Eric Anderson just as he is right now. Whether or not we ever become something more than just friends, let alone weres together, is a question that can only be answered in time. Becoming a were is a pretty big step and a lifelong commitment. Besides, I promised my mother that I&#39;d stay a virgin at least until after high school graduation.&quot; <i>Unless the right boy came along... Eric,</i> was the part of her feelings that Julie never said aloud.<br />
&quot;Oh... wow...&quot; was all Eric could say, as he laid back down on the bed again.<br />
<br />
Julie and Eric talked for almost another two hours, until his cellphone started beeping its standard warning that the battery was in need of being recharged.<br />
They discussed many things, including the possibilities of where they might go on their first date once Yvette was in jail again.<br />
Eric even got up the nerve to tell Julie about his dreams concerning the two of them. The only detail he didn&#39;t mention was the sticky mess the most intimate dream sequence created in his pajama bottoms.<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve never had anyone tell me they&#39;ve had such thoughts about me before,&quot; admitted Julie, &quot;and the town <i>does</i> hold a community dance every Halloween. It is kind of funny seeing everybody in their were-forms trying to wear a costume too. But I do like the idea you had for us, although I would like us to have our first date <i>before</i> the Halloween dance.&quot;<br />
&quot;Me too,&quot; agreed Eric. &quot;I hope they catch that werevixen soon.&quot;<br />
&quot;I can guarantee you, it isn&#39;t from a lack of trying,&quot; said Julie. &quot;She committed a serious crime turning your father against his will, and she will be punished to the fullest extent of our laws,&quot; she promised.<br />
<br />
Just as the battery warning beeped again, Eric said, &quot;Well, I guess I&#39;ll see you at school tomorrow.&quot;<br />
&quot;You better believe it. You&#39;re the only reason I look forward to lunch period now. In the past, I would just sit in the lunch room eating with my head buried in a book.&quot;<br />
&quot;Me too,&quot; said Eric, over a more persistent beep. &quot;Gotta put my phone on the charger, so bye Julie.&quot;<br />
&quot;Goodbye, landboy,&quot; Julie said with a giggle, before hanging up.<br />
After hanging up with Julie, Eric just laid in bed, staring at the ceiling, until Nate came in saying, &quot;Hey Eric. Didn&#39;t you hear mom calling? Lunch is ready.&quot;<br />
&quot;Okay Julie,&quot; said Eric as he got up and finally put his phone on the charger.<br />
Nate was about to say something, but saw the huge smile on his younger brother&#39;s face and let it slide as he went back downstairs. <i>I wonder if I have a big goofy look on my face whenever I think of Alex?</i><br />
<br />
MEANWHILE, Julie Stovall was laying on her waterbed, staring at the ceiling, when her mother came in with a basket full of her daughter&#39;s clean clothes.<br />
&quot;I know that look,&quot; said her mother, while setting the basket down.<br />
It was all Julie could do to keep from screaming as she said, &quot;Eric likes me!&quot;<br />
&quot;That&#39;s good, right?&quot; asked her mother, wondering exactly how Julie felt about the boy.<br />
&quot;You better believe it!&quot; replied her daughter. &quot;He even wants to go on a date, but—&quot;<br />
&quot;The werevixen,&quot; realized her mother, sitting on the bed next to Julie.<br />
&quot;Right,&quot; she said, sitting up to make room. &quot;Would you believe Eric didn&#39;t even know the danger he was in?&quot;<br />
&quot;Being the only normal in a house of new weres, the rest of his family probably didn&#39;t want Eric to worry,&quot; guessed her mother.<br />
&quot;Probably,&quot; agreed Julie.<br />
&quot;You know your dad and the rest of the town authorities are doing every thing they can to get her, right?&quot;<br />
&quot;I know,&quot; said Julie, leaning in and hugging her mother. <i>I just hope they do it soon. And heaven help that bitch if she hurts my Eric!</i></p>
