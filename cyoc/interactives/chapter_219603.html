<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Morgana yawned as she left her bedroom. Building up a portal to take people instantaneously across an ocean and keeping it open certainly took a lot out of you. She really needed that long power nap. She was glad her daughter kept anyone from disturbing her slumber. Which would not have ended well for the waker at all. As drained as her magic reserves were, she could probably still have called up enough power to turn the disturber into a frog.<br />
<br />
But fortunately, Morgana was left undisturbed and now she was going downstairs to see what all has happened in her absence. A cursory look around the shop showed nothing out of place. So her apprentices didn&#39;t enchant the brooms to clean up and lost control of them. Presently she saw her daughter looking over one of the spellbooks. &quot;Ah, Vivienne, has everything gone well today?&quot; asked Morgana.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mostly yes,&quot; said Vivienne.<br />
<br />
Morgana raised an eyebrow, &quot;Mostly?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, the werehyenas arrived from Oklahoma,&quot; said Vivienne.<br />
<br />
&quot;And was there a problem with that, Kibibi didn&#39;t immediately challenge Selena for leadership, did she?&quot; asked Morgana.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, she has to work with Selena for a year before she can challenge her,&quot; said Vivienne, &quot;However, one of her party did cause some mischief.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t tell me, let me guess,&quot; said Morgana, &quot;It was their little stowaway, Asha, wasn&#39;t it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Only she&#39;s not so little anymore,&quot; said Vivienne, &quot;She got into one of the Fountain of Ages potion and made herself into an 18 year old.&quot;<br />
<br />
Morgana sighed to herself. She should have suspected something like this would happen. Asha was half-werefox after all. Which made her wonder... &quot;What kind of werebeast did she become?&quot; asked Morgana.<br />
<br />
&quot;A werehyena, but with vulpine fur and a matching tail,&quot; said Vivienne.<br />
<br />
&quot;Interesting, and what did you do with her?&quot; asked Morgana.<br />
<br />
&quot;We didn&#39;t make her a child again, but I put a geis on her. Until the sunrise of her sixteenth birthday, she will feel a strong repulsion if she ever tries to have sex with anyone. And it did hold on her,&quot; said Vivienne.<br />
<br />
&quot;Very good,&quot; said Morgana, &quot;I&#39;m glad your first geis worked well. However, I&#39;ll need to learn the exact wording and double-check its hold on her. Considering her mischief-seeking nature, she will be looking for a loophole to escape her geis.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, that&#39;s why Selena&#39;s making her the pack&#39;s trickster,&quot; said Vivienne. The role would suit Asha quite well. But it meant more than just being the pack&#39;s prankster or court jester. The trickster is also the pack&#39;s problem-solver for particularly difficult tasks, using their wily cunning to find a solution that the rest of the pack can&#39;t figure out.<br />
<br />
&quot;And she&#39;ll also be a good ambassador to the werefoxes,&quot; said Morgana, &quot;Though Renata&#39;s skulk will hopefully be more willing to work alongside Selena&#39;s pack. Which reminds me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Morgana went to her purse and fished out a compact mirror. To normal people and others, it may seem like just a simple part of a makeup kit. But a witch or wizard would recognize it as an enchanted mirror. Ages ago, such mirrors were usually much larger and the oracular spirits inside them were used to find out all kinds of information for their masters. Quite often, the questions that they asked were &#39;Who is the fairest of them all?&#39; or &#39;Who is the greatest threat to my rule?&#39; But nowadays, the enchanted mirrors are much more downsized and are used as Personal Magic Assistant. Like a PDA, they can be used to plan and arrange one&#39;s schedule. But the bonus of having an oracular spirit bound to them was that they can predict events coming at times. &quot;Show me who will be coming here today,&quot; said Morgana to her PMA.<br />
<br />
The mirror clouded before an image of Summer appeared alongside an image of an African-American girl. Her mirror told her that the other girl&#39;s name was Kaylee and both of them would want to change their werehyena forms from warriors into breeders. Sometimes the PMAs can tell their owners what another person&#39;s intentions are. It was one of the ways that magic shop owners like Morgana can maintain their mysterious mystique by knowing shoppers&#39; names and what they were seeking before they came into the shop.<br />
<br />
The mirror clouded before revealing the oni girl, H&#333;k&#333; Jigokumoto. That&#39;s right, she wanted to continue her magic lessons in America. Morgana wasn&#39;t sure if she could take her on as a full-time apprentice since she already had two. However, she could see if she could provide H&#333;k&#333; with some lessons to help continue her sorcery education.<br />
<br />
Then the mirror showed an image of Renata. The PMA revealed something surprising. The werevixen was wanting a love potion. No, more than that, a fidelity potion. It was one thing to make yourself fall in love with a person. It was quite another to want to love only that person and not wish to betray them, especially for a werefox. Morgana was quite certain she had some fidelity potions in storage.<br />
<br />
The PMA next showed her the tanukis Humiya and Asuga. That was simply a reminder that Morgana will need their semen in order to brew the potion to heal Enzi and Abbie&#39;s missing testicles. She&#39;ll also need to contact Enzi after the potion is ready in order to transport her here for treatment.<br />
<br />
The PMA showing her Dracona and Tatiana was more of a surprise for Morgana, especially when it told her what they wanted. Though they admired werehyenas, they were too attached to being vampires to considering changing. However, they were interested in becoming herms themselves. Undead flesh can be a little harder to work with, but it shouldn&#39;t be that hard to accommodate them. The PMA also revealed that Naomi wanted something similar; to retain hir dick in human form as well.<br />
<br />
The last one made Morgana frown, Tori Vordenburg. Morgana knew what she wanted; to interrogate her about her cousin&#39;s activities. Fortunately, Beck was already in Japan, but Tori was going to pry anyways. Strictly speaking, Tori wasn&#39;t a bad person. There were some supernatural creatures who really are the monsters that humans think they are and hunters like Tori were needed to put them down. The problem is that monster hunters can have a very narrow view as to what&#39;s acceptable or not. Tori would probably be less willing to believe that Beck became a werehyena by hir own choice. Hopefully Morgana might be able to talk Tori about going on a slaying spree, but she was definitely saving her for last.<br />
<br />
And that was one of the benefits of having a PMA. Not only could Morgana know which people were coming, but she can also change the order of when they will come. She couldn&#39;t make them change their minds about coming or postpone them indefinitely, but she could delay them. It would appear as minor things: forgotten things they have to go back for, letting themselves get sidetracked, even a small befuddlement to make them temporarily lose their way. Though these delays can usually last no longer than a day and the stronger the magical being being effected, the more likely they&#39;ll be able to resist. Still, at least Morgana will be able to see to the other girls before Ms. Vordenburg shows up.</p>
