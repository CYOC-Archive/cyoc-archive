<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jake had tried to think of something, but his stomach began to rumble. He remembers he skipped lunch today to do some make-up work for his math class. Jake thought it&#39;d be interesting to see how he handled eating food with his big snout. Jake hurried to the cafeteria before he could watch his step. Jake found himself tripping over a concrete incline, causing his egg to fall out his bag. It hit him in the head before landing on the ground. &quot;Damnit! They really need to fix this fucking sidewalk!&quot; He heard the aggression in his voice and tried to cool down. Jake hadn&#39;t lost his temper that easley before. Then he remembered. &quot;My egg!&quot; Jake hurried over hoping it wasn&#39;t cracked due to landing in the grass. Unfortunately, his egg cracked in one small area. &quot;Damn... Well, might as well taste test.&quot; Jake pealed some of the egg open. A clear goop slid out of it. Jake was hesitant, but jammed his fingers into the goop and licked it with his reptilian tounge. &quot;Huh... It&#39;s actually sweet. Like honey.&quot; This surprised Jake. He would of thought it tasted more like an actual egg. But it would be an alright snack nonetheless. Jake finished what was left on his finger and walked towards the cafeteria, holding his egg in his arms.<br />
<br />
Jake could smell the macaroni and cheese and the hot dogs from a mile away. His new dino senses seem to help out alot with identifying foods. Jake waked through the hallway to the cafeteria, until he was knocked over by a student from the right corridor, crushing his egg in between them. Jake tried removing the goop from his clothes before looking up to see who had ran into him. He saw a black haired girl in a ponytail, wearing a white and red striped tank with jeans. &quot;Hey, want to watch where your going?&quot; Jake asked the woman covered in egg goo. Standing up, wiping shells and goop of his shirt, Jake started to notice something different in the girl from when he first looked at her. He saw her mouth was pushing forward. &quot;Hm?&quot; Jake was confused. What was happening to her. She tried to speak &quot;Wait... Aren&#39;t you one of those... Ugh... Dino kids that lay eggs?&quot; Jake blushed slightly when she refered to him and Adam. &quot;Yeah. What about... What the hell!?&quot; Jake finally noticed that her face was extended even further, her nose dissappearing into her face leaving only the nostrils. Her jaw grew bigger and sharp teeth began to grow. Jake looked at her panting with her new forked tounge out.<br />
<br />
As her face reshaped, Jake also noticed the bulge in her lower back. Her spine extended behind her, shredding her pants, and growing thicker and fatter until it reached about 4 feet. Jake finally realized that it was just like his own tail. She was turning into a T-rex girl. However, something was still persisting even after her change was done. &quot;Oh God... It&#39;s happening!&quot; She screamed in a lower pitch than Jake first heard. The girl&#39;s vagina was open freely, causing it to spread apart her butt. An orb started pushing out, becoming bigger as she pushed it out. After a few seconds of pushing, the orb finally fell out, turning out to be an egg. Jake was shocked. It looked just as big as his did. But why did she change into an egg laying rex? Than it hit Jake. It was the egg goop. It appears making contact with regular humans caused them to turn into T-rex people like Jake.<br />
<br />
The girl started panting in relief, as Jake approached her. &quot;Um... Are you okay?&quot; Jake asked reaching his hand out to help her up. The girl accepted his offer and grabbed Jake&#39;s hand pulling her up. &quot;Actually... I... I feel great!&quot; She shouted nearly screetching . &quot;Thanks for that experience. I knew what was coming when I say you with an egg, but I didn&#39;t think it&#39;d feel so nice. My mouth and tail growing, my egg pushing out of me...&quot; Jake couldn&#39;t follow why she was acting this way, but as long as she weren&#39;t upset about being changed into a partial dinosaur. Although he did wonder why she knew about his eggs effect. &quot;Oh! My names Eva by the way. Sorry for bumping into you.&quot; Jake had already forgot to be honest. &quot;Jake... So, your cool with all this?&quot; Jake asked. &quot;I&#39;ll admit, I didn&#39;t look forward to it when I saw who I bumped into, but after the whole change, I could get used to it.&quot; Eva started swishing her tail around. &quot;In fact...&quot; Jake saw Eva pull out a paper, trying to look over her big snout. She grabbed a pen and started writing something down. It was a phone number. &quot;Here. Call me if you want to do something this weekend. Hope to see you later Jake.&quot; Picking her egg up, she walks past Jake, swiveling her hips to add to her tail movement.<br />
<br />
The whole situation seemed very strange. &quot;Okay, so I made myself an egg laying male T-rex, bumped into a girl with my egg to turn her into my equal, and she asked me out on a date because of it.&quot; Jake tried to make sense as to why his egg transformed her in the first place. Did the Chronivac basically make it&#39;s own rules at times? It wasn&#39;t just the egg though. It was also his temper, and the taste of his egg. He didn&#39;t predetrmine any of what had happened. It just happened. &quot;This might get too unpredictable. Oh well. I&#39;m sure it won&#39;t go too crazy.&quot; With that being said, Jake made his way to the cafeteria, ignoring the egg mess. He thought the janitor would clean it, probably changing him too.</p>
