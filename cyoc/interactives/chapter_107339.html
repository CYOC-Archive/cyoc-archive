<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">{{THE FOLLOWING JUST ADDS MORE DETAILS TO OUR PREVIOUS CHAPTER, WITHOUT CHANGING THE RESULTS...}}<br />
<br />
The were-panthers also known as Eric Anderson and Frieda Knight were walking through and enjoying Tachibana no Akane&#39;s garden. They held paws and talked, although each could smell the scent of arousal emanating from the other. However, it would not have been right to indulge their pleasures right then and there, especially not with the leader of the Skulk trying to negotiate a peaceful accord between their respective fathers.<br />
Just as they stopped to stare at a koi pond, a werefox approached them.<br />
&quot;Miss Knight, Master Anderson. Tachibana no Akane requests the honor of your presence back inside, but you will need to resume your human forms and be properly dressed first.&quot;<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; agreed Frieda, before the teenagers walked back to where they left their clothes.<br />
As they defurred and shifted back, Eric could not help thinking how beautiful Frieda was in either form.<br />
Frieda smiled at the thought, in part because of the special bond the two of them and Spencer Lawson shared, and partly because she could see what was on Eric&#39;s mind as he struggled to get his underwear and pants back on.<br />
&quot;Later, if the opportunity presents itself. Otherwise, I&#39;m sure Spencer will take care of that for you,&quot; said Frieda, before kissing Eric on the cheek.<br />
<br />
Back inside the Tachibana residence, the teenagers found themselves standing before William Anderson, Tachibana no Akane herself, and Benton Knight.<br />
&quot;Eric,&quot; began Akane, nodding to the boy as the formal proceedings resumed. &quot;Mister Knight wishes to make amends for the unfortunate incident of Friday night. What are your feelings on the subject?&quot;<br />
Eric looked around the room between his other girlfriend, his father, the leader of the Skulk, and Frieda&#39;s father.<br />
Frieda smiled at him. William Anderson seemed calm, waiting to hear what his youngest son had to say before commenting. Akane had a similar disposition, but Benton Knight looked like he was on the edge of his seat.<br />
Eric considered his response before answering the question. &quot;I do not understand Mister Knight&#39;s position regarding myself and his daughter, let alone our association with Spencer Lawson. Although Frieda has answered my next question the best she could, I would like to hear in his own words why Benton Knight lashed out at us Friday night. In regards to the matter of amends, besides answering my questions himself, I feel Benton Knight owes myself and Mike Lawson a formal apology for his actions, as well as replacing the shirt he tore and repaying the hospital expenses both my parents and Mike Lawson incurred from that incident. I also feel that Benton Knight should make a solemn vow on behalf of himself and his wife that he will leave my family, the Lawsons, the Twists, Alex Ramsey, and his own daughter Frieda alone to live our lives in peace the way we see fit without any interference from him and/or his wife.&quot;<br />
<br />
The room grew silent as the adults contemplated what Eric said. He could feel Frieda&#39;s agreement with his position through the special bond they shared. One look at his father simply nodding his head affirmatively showed Eric that he agreed.<br />
Then Akane spoke. &quot;Your words hold wisdom, and your requests are not unreasonable, but I do not understand why you included Samantha, Frances, and Benjamin Twist; along with this Alex Ramsey within them.&quot;<br />
&quot;The Twists are our friends and next door neighbors. Before my family moved to Moon Lake, Benton Knight tried to have Samantha Twist fired from her job as Town Chancellor and Doctor Frances Twist&#39;s therapist license revoked after he learned they are a married lesbian couple. I shudder to think what undeserved consequences their continued association with my family might bring, especially in light of the fact that their adopted son Ben has started seriously dating another boy,&quot; explained Eric.<br />
&quot;This Alex Ramsey, I presume?&quot; asked Akane, to which Eric simply nodded his head.<br />
<br />
Then Akane turned in her seat to question her other guests.<br />
&quot;William Anderson. You have heard the wishes of your son, but since he is a minor in the eyes of Moon Lake and Skulk laws, you as Eric&#39;s father still have say in this matter. What is your opinion and wishes?&quot;<br />
William stared at Eric and smiled. &quot;My son is far wiser for his years than I or his mother ever suspected. If it is in agreement with the Elders&#39; Council and your own feelings Tachibana no Akane as my Skulk leader, I shall stand with you and my child and honor everything we have previously discussed as well, provided Benton Knight and his wife do the same.&quot;<br />
Akane simply smiled and bowed her head to William. Then she turned to face the man who&#39;s answer would affect everything.<br />
&quot;Benton Knight,&quot; she began. &quot;You have heard the requests of the one you injured that are needed to make amends. Most of them are in alignment with what has already been imposed upon you by the Elders&#39; Council and what was agreed to earlier. None of them are unreasonable and all more than just. How say you?&quot;<br />
Benton just stared at his daughter and the boy standing next to her.<br />
Replacing the shirt and paying the hospital bills were no problem. A few hundred dollars at most.<br />
But the other stuff?<br />
Amanda would never go for the part about leaving the families and Frieda alone, but what choice did they have?<br />
Yet apologize, let alone explain his actions? How could he?<br />
And there were still the problems of trying to hire back the household staff, the impending lawsuit from Jeffery the butler after Benton hit him...<br />
But remembering the fate that awaited him if his bi-polar disorder remained untreated, he knew what had to be done.<br />
<br />
Benton Knight said, &quot;I shall do my best to honor all my commitments. Those previously imposed by the Elders&#39; Council as well as those made here today between William Anderson, his son Eric, and myself. Neither I or my wife shall ever again interfere with our daughter, nor any member of the Anderson, Lawson, or Twist families, as well as this Alex Ramsey; although I would like to point out that I was totally unaware of the boy and his relationship to Ben Twist before today. I will also make full financial restitution to the Andersons and Mike Lawson for any recent hospital expenses because of my actions, as well as personally buy Eric a replacement shirt.&quot;<br />
With that, Benton Knight swallowed his pride and apologized to the boy. At times the words caught in his throat, but he managed to say what was needed.<br />
&quot;You and Spencer Lawson are also more than welcomed to join our pride,&quot; added Benton, which made his daughter smile. &quot;The next meeting is this Tuesday night, provided your parents allow you to join.&quot;<br />
&quot;I cannot speak for the Lawsons, but Eric has our permission to both attend and join, provided you remember what we said earlier concerning it&#39;s a school night,&quot; said William. He was talking to Benton, but looking at his son.<br />
&quot;Agreed,&quot; was all Benton said.<br />
Eric simply smiled and nodded, then both he and Frieda got out their cellphones to text Spencer with the news.<br />
<br />
Then Benton turned and looked at Akane, who studied him for a moment before saying, &quot;You have done well so far, but your amends of the moment are incomplete. While Mike Lawson is not hear to apologize to, you still need to answer Eric&#39;s questions.&quot;<br />
&quot;I—&quot; said Benton Knight, wondering if even he knew the whys and wherefores. Discovering he was bi-polar might explain more recent events, but how much of the past was it responsible for? Certainly not dating back all the way to childhood, and his hatred of a brother who had not even been born yet when a ten year old Benton was told he would soon have a sibling.<br />
