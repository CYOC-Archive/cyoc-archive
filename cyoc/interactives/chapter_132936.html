<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Of the choices, it was the fair doe that caught your eye.  Perhaps the resemblance to Bambi  or just the innocent look on the doe&#39;s face that comforted you.  The choice made, you&#39;re presented with a short list of questions.<br />
<br />
The first was simple enough.  &quot;Name your doe.&quot; With no experience in naming deer, you went with something simple, and typed &#39;Sara&#39; in.<br />
<br />
Next appeared to be a difficulty meter.  It ranged from standard in the middle, to hard on the left and easy on the right. Not really understanding what this could even mean, you play is safe and go towards easy.  At least you would be guaranteed a reward for this, you would figure.<br />
<br />
&quot;Agree?&quot; was all that remained and with little reason to second guess, you touched the button. &quot;Thank you!&quot; appeared followed by a pixelated version of a forest setting.  Other than that, you were left wondering what this whole arc experience was about. It was getting on a three minutes with not so much as a peep.<br />
<br />
You stepped towards the door to bang to be let out, only to trigger a small jet of gas.  You briefly smell something earthy, while your tongue waters for something, leaving you licking your lips.<br />
<br />
Taking a couple steps back and giving your head a shake, things seemed a bit clearer again.  You were wondering what that smell was about when the strangest sort of electric tingle spread out from your stomach to your chest, hips, arms, legs, neck and finally ending at the tip of your nose which, unseen to you, began to blemish dark spots until it actually looked to be your very skin, if a bit... bestial.<br />
<br />
You take just one step forward and when your foot hits the ground is reverberates through your legs like a tuning fork.  Your breathing starts to become more erratic as your heart rate began to go up. You feel every hair on your body stand up on prickling skin. Every inch of your body seemed to suddenly become alert and sensitive all at once, shocking your system and distracting from odd sensations.  Like the faint tugged at your ears that had them starting to point while also starting to grow the slightest hint of tan fur. Or the wiggle at your ass that you passed off as beads of sweat until you felt an odd ache at your tailbone that you couldn&#39;t ignore.<br />
<br />
Giving the slightest of glances around, you undo your belt quickly and quietly, and tug the back of them down just to see what it is.<br />
<br />
Your pants fell to a heap around your ankles as your hands lost their grip in a sudden nervousness. You were slack jawed and trying to process what you were seeing, even as it continued to change before your eyes.<br />
<br />
The tail was only a few inches, but was already starting to point back and take on a fluff of fur. Your spine now sore, you bent forward somewhat, pull your underwear down somewhat to give yourself room but it only causes a series of pops and cracks in your hips, shifting the muscles somewhat and hardly relieving your discomfort. It was then, when trying to think of anything but the pain in your pelvis, that you noticed your ears felt strange.  Almost flopping somewhat.<br />
<br />
You take your right hand to investigate but upon feeling the more cervine shaped ear, you pull it back, just in time for a massive shooting pain in your gut, hips, ass, and entire pelvic region to grip you.  Bending over further, hoping for relief, there is some to be had.  However, it&#39;s fleeting, as two shifts in your hips forced your feet apart oddly while also spreading your ass to the air and world.<br />
<br />
You moaned as a timely gush of wind wafted over your newly present rear end.  The tickling you feel is the beginings of a white fur that&#39;s spreading from the base of your new, perky tail , down and over your ass and taint. Oh and that tightening sensation you feel around your asshole is sort of your asshole, as it&#39;s darkened and puckered, leaving your rear end looking decided deer. Now you suddenly have the feeling you&#39;re peeing yourself when in reality it&#39;s just the water remains of your manhood leaving your body.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, off in the dark end of the room, you heard the sound like a door being opened followed by some loud clattering noises.<br />
<br />
Your attention soon turns to the dark color that&#39;s taken your nose and started sticking out more until it was over your mouth.  You were left with the start of a muzzle when it hit you hard; your cock feeling like it was being hammered down into you.<br />
<br />
Desperate and unable to keep yourself on just two feel, you let one hand hit the ground while the other tugs your underwear down around your knees.  Your teeth start to chatter and your eyes dilate, and you watch your cock shrivel in thickness and size, your balls already gone from view. What you felt next was something even you couldn&#39;t describe, as your back end underwent drastic changes. Your bowels and insides felt like they were being tossed in a rock tumbler ass your muscles tensed and relaxed on their own. When it finally started to finish, a more gentle warmness came over your lower half at last. That last kick of energy through your system is actually the opening of your new doe cunt; the &#39;Easy&#39; one.<br />
<br />
Your choice for an easy experience made your sex almost guaranteed to bear fruit, to the tune of 99.98%.  Not only does that result in a permanent change, but with a gestation cycle of 30 days, you would be well equipped from the arc to repopulate the forest.  If only you had...<br />
<br />
While watching four budding teats taking shape at your thinned waist, a shadow quickly came over you.  Then two large hooves were behind your feet, which had been caught in a hazy cramp for some time that you had gone to the tips of your toes to try and relieve.  Lifting your head and looking back- your ears now flopping more freely astride your thinner, balding head.<br />
<br />
It was the massive antlersyou notice first, then the sensation of something wet at your backside, followed by a snort of hot breath against your virgin, but quickly coming of season, sex. When the massive buck lifted it&#39;s head, there was little consideration of you as a human in his eyes. He only knew your scent and that you were in season. With no more thought, he leapt onto your back, nearly causing your legs to buckle.  Your shoes were not so lucky, ripping to reveal why your feet had felt to odd. You had a perfect pair of doe back legs, growing fur quickly as your knees changes and entire back side was taking on the complete look of a young doe.<br />
<br />
With a buck scrabbling up your back, his long red cock taking aim at the bullseye of your new gender. You go to cry out when tightness gripped your hands. The buck still working, you had to watch your thumb and pinky tug up your thinning forearm while your remain fingers split into two hardening hooves.<br />
<br />
Then the buck found his mark, and buried twelve inches of buck into your cunt, forcing a noise out of your mouth that was hardly human at all, and more animal.  Like most of the rest of you, including your face starting to finally push out, taking away more of your old face with every inch.<br />
<br />
It didn&#39;t take long for the buck to do the deer, finishing in you and forcing you into what was your first orgasm as a doe. He dismounted and trotted off back towards the other end of the room.<br />
<br />
You were left 75% doe at this point, with your shirt rolled up under your arms and underwear still around you ankles.  You could feel the excess from the buck dripping down you but you couldn&#39;t see the sight, a somewhat swollen udder the new hanging thing between your legs.<br />
<br />
While you tried to tense and resist the- inevitable- change to doe, your body started acting against your wishes.  Starting by lifting and fluttering your tail before dumping a load of round, dark droppings into underwear.  When you became aware of this, you spread your legs, causing your underwear to finally rip and your droppings to spill between your hind legs.<br />
<br />
As you stepped away from that shame, at the far end of the room, there was a sudden light that for a moment blinded you but, unable to shield your eyes, you were blinded for a moment.  As the haze cleared, you could see two large doors had been swung open and a forest&#39;s edge lay just fifty feet beyond.  The buck trotted out before leaping into the dark of the wood.<br />
<br />
Jaw stiffening against your will, you&#39;re finally left with a doe&#39;s snout and with a rounding of your eyes, year, and a nice coating of fuzz, you had a doe&#39;s head.  <br />
<br />
It was getting harder to think as the remains unchanged parts of you- the neck and shoulders- succumbed liked the rest; shifting, cracking, and always the prickling of fur.<br />
<br />
The flickering of the screen where you made your fateful choice had you lifting your head to read.  It was difficult, but you made out, &#39;You&#39;re a winner, Sunny!&#39; and had some vague understand of what had happened.  Turning around to the the bright light of the outdoors, your legs quivered. Glancing down you see the tatters of your old clothes which only twenty minutes prior, fit perfectly.  Now there were in pieces, and soiled with the buck&#39;s leavings and your own turds; a pile that grew again, as if to remind you how an animal should behave.<br />
<br />
You slowly start to walk towards the light, your mind growing more tired, while your body kept functioning on instinct. Your belly was even starting to sag with your first three fawns, and your legs seemed to work themselves into a gallop.  Some part of your mind, maybe the last human bit, tried to stop but was overpowered but instinct as you bounded into the sun and over the grass. Soon you were in the forest, but it wasn&#39;t you anymore.  Just the doe, and soon to be mother.</p>
