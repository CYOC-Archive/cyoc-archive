<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The car pulled up to the little house, and Markus found himself recounting the days he&#39;d spent there with his friend as a kid, and what he was about to do to his friend&#39;s sister...wondering for just a moment on whether or not this was the right thing to do. Was he using the power of the Chronivac irresponsibly? Probably... As he was considering driving away, he saw another car approach. As it parked, a woman exited, a beautiful woman whose face was unmistakably his old friend&#39;s sister&#39;s. All thoughts of whether it was right or wrong didn&#39;t really matter anymore, and his dick got hard as a rock, as if to confirm that morality was thrown to the wind at this point. He leaned forward and gave the driver a couple bucks for his trouble and hopped out of the car, looking to Chelsea as she walked up into the house. Another person also exited the car, a man Markus assumed was her boyfriend. He gave a mental shrug, knowing it&#39;d be easy to get him out of the way, and began his approach. With his phone in hand, he watched the selection options expand. Chelsea, her parents who were apparently inside, and even...even his old friend. That&#39;s going to make this interesting, he thought with a smirk before heading up the steps and knocking on the door.<br />
<br />
An hour later, he sat on their couch, a part of him actually glad for the small talk and catching up he&#39;d done with people it&#39;d been so long since he&#39;d seen, but the itch in the back of his mind knew what was to come. He made himself keep some emotional distance, and made sure to keep glancing at his phone so he remembered why he was there. After all, nobody&#39;s here to read that, people want the visceral detail of passion, and so did he to be honest. &quot;Well,&quot; he said, looking around the room at his friend&#39;s family with a devious smile &quot;time to get down to business, I suppose.&quot; His friend&#39;s mother, let&#39;s call her Josie, raised an eyebrow in confusion as she asked &quot;What do you mean?&quot; Markus didn&#39;t even bother to answer, taking his phone and selecting everyone in the room. Changing their mental stats was all he really had to do, obedience was all he really needed here. As he finished, they all seemed to blink at once, but otherwise nothing seemed to change. Made sense, he figured, considering he hadn&#39;t really changed anything obvious. He was nervous, however, so he had to test it out. &quot;Josie,&quot; he said, making sure to use her first name to see how he could do &quot;could you clap for me?&quot; His friend&#39;s mother went right to clapping, not even asking why. &quot;Perfect&quot; he said, his dick hard as a fucking diamond.  He then had a messed up thought, and looked his friend&#39;s Dad, let&#39;s call him Jack, right in the eyes and said &quot;I&#39;m going to fuck your daughter on the couch now, alright?&quot; The man just gave a nod, and kept staring at Markus as if it were part of a normal conversation. He then looked to Chelsea and beckoned her over, to which she immediately obeyed. Markus looked to her boyfriend and said &quot;Well, you alright with that?&quot; The man just gave a nod. <br />
<br />
&quot;Chelsea, suck my cock.&quot; Markus said as the woman approached. She immediately got down on her knees and reached for his zipper, pulling it down with a quick ZIIIIP and fumbling with his underwear before pulling out his cock. Almost like lightning, it was in her mouth and she got to work, the whole of his newly increased size disappearing into the woman&#39;s mouth and from what he could feel...down her throat. &quot;J-Jeeesus....&quot; was all he could say as the feeling overwhelmed him. Seeing her, doing that, in front of her boyfriend, her father, and her mother was just...wow. This Chronivac page was a dream come true. She slowly worked herself along his shaft, cradling his balls with one hand, and almost subconsciously starting to play with herself with the other. It wasn&#39;t long before Markus released himself into her throat, his cum trickling down inside her. The thought of that alone almost made him cum again, but he needed a moment to collect himself. &quot;Chelsea, stop.&quot; he said, and she obeyed, popping his dick out of her mouth and licking her lips as she sat down. <br />
<br />
Markus wiped some sweat from his forehead and looked around the room, his cock still out in the middle of their living room, not a single one of them looking like anything had happened except Chelsea, who was a little red in the face from the...uh...workout. Markus wondered what he should do next, looking around...</p>
