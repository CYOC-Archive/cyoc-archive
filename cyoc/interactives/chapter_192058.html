<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">There is a moment of silence. Just long enough for you to fear that she&#39;s going to ignore you. Then,<br />
<br />
<i>-Are you done?-<br />
<br />
...Y-Yes...</i> It&#39;s hard to think through the mixture of arousal, shame and guilt you feel right now.<br />
<br />
<i>-You <b>really</b> need to learn to control that mouth of yours -- if you ever want to use it for something other than pumping us vixens full of Karther&#39;s cum.-</i> You feel Janice sigh. <i>-But... I guess this time, at least, I can forgive you. It must be hard... to be a cock.-<br />
<br />
Yeah... really &quot;hard...&quot;</i> You wince, and try to keep yourself from moving. You sense Janice&#39;s amusement at what was meant as bitter irony, and snap, <i>It isn&#39;t funny! This morning, I was a normal guy. Now I&#39;m a fox cock, and it&#39;s YOUR fault!<br />
<br />
-No, it isn&#39;t. You think I asked Karther for this? All I did was beg him not to make you an asshole -- I mean, literally. I think he might have, though he&#39;s not usually cruel. But you really insulted him -- both directly and in insulting us. Which, by the way, I&#39;m <b>still</b> angry about.-<br />
<br />
I...</i> You have to stop to process that. <i>You just asked him not to do... that?<br />
<br />
-Yes.-</i> She pauses, thinking something over. Unknown to you, she&#39;s debating whether she should tell you that Karther also promised that this would not be permanent. She decides it isn&#39;t her place to tell you -- unknown to her, Karther already told you himself.<br />
<br />
So you are the one who eventually breaks the ensuing silence. <i>Look...</i> You do regret calling her a whore. But you also think you have every right to be angry at being jerked from your life and expected to become this &quot;prince&#39;s&quot; concubine without being asked. <i>I didn&#39;t <b>mean</b> to insult you. But you <b>did</b> pull me into this. If not for you asking Karther to bring me into his harem -- which I DON&#39;T RECALL ASKING FOR -- I wouldn&#39;t be here at all!<br />
<br />
-That&#39;s... technically true,-</i> she admits with some reluctance. <i>-But... we were afraid if Karther tried contacting you first, you would refuse. We thought, once you were here, once you met me, saw how happy we were, saw how <b>amazing</b> Karther is...-<br />
<br />
I&#39;d just fall down and worship his cock?</i> you ask sarcastically, momentarily forgetting the irony. Janice giggles though, the vibrations running into you from her and reminding you of your place. You also feel your knot tugging as Karther shifts, and Janice stills herself.<br />
<br />
<i>Why not? Kitsune <b>are</b> worshipped, on Earth as well as here. I guess I&#39;ve forgotten though just how a &#39;typical&#39; human male would react.-</i> Another sigh. <i>-Oh Tommy... maybe we messed things up, but if you&#39;d only given it a chance! If only you&#39;d been <b>polite!</b> Karther <b>is</b> royalty after all, and it did cost him some effort to bring you here. Also, Kitsune value their promises greatly, so after promising me to make you a concubine he couldn&#39;t just accept &#39;no.&#39;-<br />
<br />
Sure he could have. Why shouldn&#39;t <b>I</b> have a say in what happens to me!?<br />
<br />
-If you&#39;d been respectful, you could have! But no. Your pride and prudishness just <b>couldn&#39;t</b> see anything around you but &quot;stupid whores&quot;.</i> The anger, the <i>hurt</i> comes back into Janice&#39;s voice. <i>-All these years I&#39;ve continued to think of you as a friend, Tommy. I wanted to see you again. I wanted you to share the happiness and freedom I&#39;ve known as a concubine. And I did what I could to save you from your own stupidity, and you <b>still</b> think I&#39;m just some mindless sex slave?-</i><br />
<br />
Now she&#39;s made you feel guilty again. <i>You&#39;re... right about that. I&#39;m sorry... I&#39;m sorry I called you a stupid whore.</i><br />
<br />
Janice suppresses a giggle, so as not to disturb her mate further, but it still comes loud and clear across your link. It&#39;s somewhat wry, given that she&#39;s not entirely mollified. But it&#39;s some progress, even if you don&#39;t get the joke. She soon explains.<br />
<br />
<i>-Mm... You know, if you hadn&#39;t <b>meant</b> it as an insult, I wouldn&#39;t take being called a whore as an insult. I have nothing against girls who lift their tails for coin. But that&#39;s not what I am. We concubines... I guess you could call us permanent live-in girlfriends? We share some of his meals, and attend formal receptions so he can show off his virility, and of course give him sex when he wants. Sometimes he also asks us to service important guests.-<br />
<br />
What!?</i><br />
<br />
Another silent giggle. <i>-Oh Tommy, you&#39;re so innocent. It&#39;s just considered hospitality here to share your concubines with friends or dignitaries. And we are <b>asked</b> beforehand, we&#39;re not slaves -- though why say no? Sex is sex.-<br />
<br />
It still sounds... I don&#39;t know. Wrong. Like you&#39;re being passed around like some kind of... toy.<br />
<br />
-I think of it as part of our job. We&#39;re here to provide sexual entertainment for Karther and whoever he thinks is worthy of us. In return, we live like royalty and get a nice allowance on top of it. And...</i> She deliberately ripples her muscles around you this time. <i>-The sex is <b>ample</b> reward in itself!-<br />
<br />
H-Hey!</i> you protest. <I>S-Stop it!</i><br />
<br />
&quot;Mmm.&quot; Again the soft sound sends vibrations shivering through you. <i>-I need to keep you knotted to me, right? To continue the conversation? If you go down and slip out -- we might not get to talk again for days.-</i><br />
<br />
You can tell she&#39;s teasing, but also right. <i>This sucks. How can you love a guy who would... <b>do</b> something like this!?<br />
<br />
-Because he loves us. You may have a hard time believing it, but it&#39;s true -- that&#39;s a big part of <b>why</b> this happened, remember? We&#39;re his lovers, his confidantes, his comforters when ruling gets to be too much for him. And you were acting like we were trash. And there&#39;s a bit of poetic justice, you know -- you were acting like a dick, so you became a dick.-<br />
<br />
Ha ha.</i> But your metaphorical heart isn&#39;t really in the sarcastic laugh. You&#39;re really starting to regret what you did, and not just because of the horrible consequences. If what Janice is saying is true, then you really were being kind of a dick. And you don&#39;t doubt her. She&#39;s too recognizable as your friend, just feminine and maybe a bit more cultured. Even her not completely thinking this through reminds you of Jake,<br />
<br />
<i>-And... Tommy...-</i> You sense her struggling with the best way to say this. <i>-You <b>are</b> a dick now. I think you should stop resisting and... embrace it.-</i><br />
<br />
She squeezes around you again. <i>A-aaahhh! Stop it!<br />
<br />
-Sorry, didn&#39;t mean to this time. But well... you&#39;re a cock stuffed in my cunny. It&#39;s kind of hard for me to ignore that.-</i><br />
<br />
You sulk for a bit in silence. Then, <i>I don&#39;t want to be a cock. How can I accept it?<br />
<br />
-What good does it do you to fight? You&#39;re certainly not strong enough to break Karther&#39;s spell. And I&#39;ll be honest, I&#39;d join the other concubines in helping him suppress you if you somehow COULD.-<br />
<br />
What!?</i><br />
<br />
Another sigh. <i>-I guess there are some dynamics of our relationship I can&#39;t really convey, other than to say that I love him and won&#39;t see him hurt for the sake of an estranged friend. But it doesn&#39;t matter, you have no way of fighting back. So just enjoy it.-</i><br />
<br />
You shift uncomfortably, and Janice lets out a soft moan.<br />
<br />
<i>-This time it&#39;s your fault,-</i> she points out with a mental laugh as her passage clamps down in response.<br />
<br />
<i>Urrrgh...</i> You compose yourself, focusing on her presence to block out the stimulation and your inner turmoil. But then, feeling her sympathy, you decide to make an admission. <i>Janice, I... I&#39;m afraid. Afraid I&#39;ll lose my identity completely if I... give in.<br />
<br />
-Oh.-</i> For once, it seems she doesn&#39;t have a response. Apparently this had never really occurred to her, despite how obvious it seems to you. How could being another man&#39;s dick NOT mess with your brain? -- well, your mind; you no longer have a brain.<br />
<br />
<i>-Well... you have me to talk to. We take turns warming Karther&#39;s bed, so it&#39;ll be a while. But the other girls are nice too; even though you made a bad first impression, I&#39;m sure they&#39;ll be willing to give you another chance. And anyway...-</i><br />
<br />
She falls silent a bit, gathering her thoughts -- or her nerve, to tell you what you don&#39;t want to hear. <i>-Whatever happens, the important thing is to be happy. And you&#39;ll be a lot happier if you &#39;give in&#39; as you say and enjoy what you can. Don&#39;t tell me you don&#39;t love how my insides feel. That it doesn&#39;t feel great to handle Karther&#39;s sweet load, and pump it into my hot body.-<br />
<br />
J-Janice!<br />
<br />
-Too lewd? Get used to it, Tommy!-</i> Again a tremor runs through you from her mirth. But then, <i>-Seriously, Tommy, try to get used to it? I... I don&#39;t want you to lose your mind, but I feel like that&#39;s a lot <b>more</b> likely if you try to fight against what you are.-</i><br />
<br />
Silence. You&#39;re not at all ready to concede to her. But you&#39;re very uneasy. She&#39;s made some valid points. At last you feel her yawn.<br />
<br />
<i>-Well, I really am quite worn out by that amazing fucking... Good night, little Tommy.-</i> She gives you one last squeeze, and this time you don&#39;t protest. <i>-Before I drift off... I accept your apology. And I&#39;m sorry too... I should have been more considerate of how you&#39;d probably react.-<br />
<br />
...I... forgive you, Jake. Er, Janice. Good night.</i><br />
<br />
She gives one final, tired laugh at your slip, then her presence withdraws, leaving you alone in the hot, wet darkness. Contemplating her words, and your fate. You certainly aren&#39;t happy... but, it does feel good to have reached some kind of understanding with your former friend. Maybe... as WEIRD as all this is... you can even become close again.<br />
<br />
You decide that, whatever your long-term attitude will be, you&#39;ll take her advice for now, and relax in the torrid embrace of her flesh. The beating of Janice&#39;s heart around you, and Karther&#39;s in you, becomes soothing. Eventually your knot softens and you slide back into your sheath, getting some rest in your own way.</p>
