<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The restaurant was sparsely populated. There were only 3 other tables occupied. Two by couples and the third by a business group of mixed genders. Jordan was relieved that Sam was unlikely to get hit on. <br />
<br />
Sam was quiet as Jordan asked if they could have a table by the far window as far as possible from the other patrons. His first words were “Thankyou” as the waiter pulled out a chair for at a table which overlooked the shopping strip. It had been a nerve-racking experience exiting the elevator and feeling eyes watching him as they made their way through the lobby to the restaurant. Walking in the heels wasn’t a problem at all, but he wasn’t exactly sure how he was meant to carry the handbag. <br />
<br />
Once seated he began to examine the menu and the wine list. He needed a drink to clam his nerves. On Jordan’s recommendation they ordered a bottle of champagne. Jordan explained that she knew what the blonde girls body liked.<br />
<br />
Sam did catch the waiter checking out his breasts. But rather than feeling embarrassed, he actually found it quite endearing the way the man tried to hide what he was doing. Sam felt sorry for him, knowing first hand what effect this body had on male minds.<br />
<br />
Normally Sam enjoyed a good steak but with his smaller frame he took note of Jordan’s recommendations as to what to eat. She suggested that a small linguini pasta was probably all that Sam needed. Sam went with that suggestion. He could always just order desert if he was still hungry. <br />
<br />
Jordan was right about the champagne, it went down very smoothly and after a couple of glasses Sam was starting to relax. When the waiter was out of earshot he once more rebuked Jordan for turning him into a woman. “Why did you have to say that this blonde was going to be part of the presentation tomorrow? Couldn’t you have just told your contact that your male colleague Sam Colson was going to be here”<br />
<br />
“It was already too late. I answered a video call from Angus, he saw me looking like you. I explained that I was a colleague of Jordan’s and that she was currently busy and had asked me to take her calls. He asked my name and I just gave him the first name that came to mind. Yours”<br />
<br />
“So how well do you know this man. You just called him Angus”<br />
<br />
“Only via phone calls and emails. He is the head of the IT department and seemed impressed with the information on our system that I sent through. He seems very nice and very keen”<br />
<br />
“Well we do have state of the art software. We are better than anything else out there” Sam admitted. “So is this Angus the decision maker?”<br />
<br />
“I think so. He is an executive vice president. He is also the nephew of the President” <br />
<br />
“And have you done your homework on him? What are his likes and dislikes? Does he have a family?”<br />
<br />
“It’s all in here” said Jordan as she passed a folder across the table to Sam.<br />
<br />
Sam opened the folder. This was familiar territory for him. He was the company’s tech guru and worked with the sales people who located and wooed potential clients. Sam would participate in the final presentations leading to hopefully a signature from the new client. He would tailor his presentations depending on the likes and dislikes of the decision makers.<br />
<br />
He opened the folder and began to read what Jordan had put together. He knew a little about Sanguine enterprises from his own enquiries made once Jordan had pencilled them as potential clients. They were a conglomerate that had grown rapidly in the last 5 years. Grown by buying out failing enterprises and turning their fortunes around. Sam was impressed that they were not a typical buy and dismantle conglomerate. It seemed that someone in Sanguine industries had an eye for businesses that had good foundations but were poorly run.<br />
<br />
Sam flicked through the first few pages, once more noticing his long fingernails. They actually made opening the pages easier. He read of Vincent Sanguine the President and founder of the company. A 65 year old, balding man who was a keen golfer and confirmed bachelor. It seemed his business and golfing were his life. For it’s first 30 years Sanguine industries was a small engineering firm that made car parts.<br />
<br />
He then read about Angus Henshaw, 29 years old and a graduate of MIT. Angus had come to work for his uncles firm 7 years ago after graduating with a masters degree. Sam checked the dates. That didn’t really make sense. Surely he could not have graduated with a masters degree from MIT at 22? He pointed out the error to Jordan “I don’t think this is right”<br />
<br />
“Oh it is. Evidently Angus is a bit of a prodigy”<br />
<br />
Sam went back to reading the profile. There was a picture of Angus receiving some award. He looked the typical stuck up preppy boy, tallish with a neatly trimmed brown hair. He went on to read Angus’s likes and dislikes. There was a list of multiple sports, he evidently played football at college and was a major sponsor of the local basketball team. He was on the board of two charities, one for cancer suffering children and the other for providing shelter for the homeless. This profile was too good to be true. Under marital status it said “Single” At the end though was a single word, written in by hand. “Blondes”<br />
<br />
“What’s this?” asked Sam pointing to the word.<br />
<br />
Jordan did seem a bit embarrassed. She was actually squirming a little as she replied “Angus isn’t married. All his former girlfriends have one thing in common. They are leggy blondes”<br />
<br />
Sam just stared at his colleague for a full minute. She wouldn’t meet his eye.<br />
<br />
“Did you have this planned all along?”<br />
<br />
“No….. Not really….. I mean sort of”<br />
<br />
“Please explain?”<br />
<br />
“I found that girl and manipulated her body to become what you are now. The intention was to seduce Angus and sign him up” <br />
<br />
“You set me up totally! I wager even that bet we made was part of this!” Sam was aware that his voice had risen in pitch<br />
 <br />
“No it wasn’t. My intention was always that I would be the blonde. She was going to be Jordan Chambers. Only Angus does like making video calls and I answered a call when I was in my own body with my own name” <br />
<br />
“So you were Jordan and you needed a female blonde Sam? Hence I became the patsy?”<br />
<br />
“Well someone had to be the blonde and he was already expecting Jordan and Sam to give the presentation”<br />
<br />
“Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! And Fuck!” Sam wasn’t happy. <br />
<br />
“I’m really sorry. I didn’t set out to do it this way. It’s just …… imagine the commission we could make. I’ll make it up to you I promise”<br />
<br />
“Hell Jordan! You have gone too far!” Sam stood up and paced around the table. <br />
<br />
“Calm down Sam! You are making a scene!” Jordan hissed at him quietly.<br />
<br />
“This is not my fault!” Sam replied under his breath</p>
