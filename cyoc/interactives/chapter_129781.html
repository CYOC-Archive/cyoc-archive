<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">While Daniel and Elena were pre-occupied by mistaken spell-casting, Alex and Ryan were playing football in the moonlight. Ryan, formerly 99.9% heterosexual, was strangely intrigued by Alex, who claimed to be the brother of his absent girlfriend Alexa. Little did Ryan know Alex really was Alexa, who had transformed into a wereman (or to be more accurate, a wifwere) under the full moon. That was why Alex was dressed in torn women&#39;s jeans (with lace panties underneath!). All Ryan knew was that Alex was the mostly manly man he&#39;d ever met. And certainly the strongest, judging by his tackles...  <br />
<br />
Since it was a hot night, Ryan had removed his shirt and shoes while they threw the ball back and forth. He was dressed only in shorts and  very sweaty. His ball catching had suffered because he could barely tear his eyes away from Alex&#39;s bronze, impossibly handsome face. In a moment of distraction he was tackled and fell on the cool grass. Alex lay directly on top of Ryan before spreading his arms to push up his upper body. His lower half was still atop Ryan&#39;s. <br />
&quot;Like I told you bro, I&#39;m stronger,&quot; said Alex, gazing with his dark brown, almond-shaped eyes.<br />
&quot;Ohhh yesss&quot; Ryan said breathlessly. He could feel Alex&#39;s hard groin on top of his and knew he was seconds away from complete arousal.<br />
&quot;But don&#39;t feel bad bro,&quot; said Alex, &quot;maybe you&#39;re better at wrestling. I REALLY wanna wrestle with you.&quot;<br />
&quot;Fuck yes&quot; replied Ryan, twisting his pelvis so his groin would grind against Alex&#39;s. Within seconds they were practically frotting. <br />
Alex gave a wicked smile. &quot;Let&#39;s do this.&quot;<br />
<br />
Their limbs were quickly in a shifting tangle as they writhed and rolled across the back yard. Once again Alex&#39;s strength prevailed, as he wrapped his legs, and then arms, around Ryan&#39;s. Gripped tight, Ryan let his body go limp, feeling Alex&#39;s skin against his. <br />
&quot;You win, stud&quot; he panted. <br />
&quot;Damn straight! Look me in the eyes when you say that.&quot; <br />
Ryan turned his head and found his lips millimeters away from Alex&#39;s. He brought them closer. Their lips met and opened for their tongues. The long, sloppy, wet kiss seemed to last forever, but as last Alex broke away and whispered into Ryan&#39;s ear:<br />
&quot;On all fours bitch.&quot;<br />
&quot;Anything you say, stud.&quot; Alex was on his knees behind him and yanked down Ryan&#39;s shorts and boxers to expose two plump buttocks. Alex&#39;s hands went to his jeans and lowered them just enough to free his monster cock. Rigid and jutting into space, it hoovered before  Ryan&#39;s asscrack... <br />
<br />
A bit of spit later, they were fucking in the moonlight. Ryan could feel Alex&#39;s pre-cum leaking into him. It was Ryan&#39;s first time being penetrated and the pain was delicious. It became more so, albeit in a different part of his body, when Alex bit his lower neck in a fit of animal passion. The bite, situated near the shoulder, was deep enough to draw blood. It felt wonderful.<br />
&quot;Harder&quot; he moaned, &quot;fuck me harder!&quot;<br />
Never had he encountered such pleasure. Every inch of Ryan&#39;s skin tingled as Alex&#39;s precum and saliva infected his bloodstream. He lifted his head to gaze at the full moon and was hit by the first stages of transformation.<br />
<br />
The hairs on his arms and legs began shrinking in the moonlight. His limbs followed suit, losing girth but gaining curves. His hips widened and an additional layer of fat plumbed his jiggling buttocks, whose hairs seemed to retract into softer skin. A slight feeling of weakness signalled the contraction of muscles in his upper body. But while his pectorals deflated, the nipples crowning them grew swollen, their areolas inflamed. <br />
All the while Alex&#39;s penis continued jackhammering away inside Ryan, whose groans and shouts became squeaks and shrieks as his voice broke. His testicles dangled less and less as his scrotum, seemingly pulled by an invisible hand, sucked itself into his groin. Ryan&#39;s penis went limp as its blood vessels thinned. Losing hardness, it also lost length and width with every twitch. Fatty tissue collected over his pecs, carrying the nipples away from the once-flat chest. With a squelch, his testicles disappeared into his body,  traveling upwards to begin their mutation into ovaries. His penis was still shriveling away, the mushroom head rounding into a clitoral hood. Soon the entire organ was little more than a nub steadily treating toward the crotch. Below it, the central seam of flesh in his now retracted scrotum began to split open. Ryan was feverish. Sweat dropped from the softening curves of his face and streamed past his puffier lips. His once light-brown hair lightened to blonde and flowed past his ears and shoulders. The hard angles of his face were lost as the cheekbones and forehead curved to give the face a pleasing softness. <br />
The new opening between the legs, in the gap between the now vanished testicles, resembled a mouth with two pairs of thin lips. Ryan was no longer a man--estrogen flowed through her hourglass torso as she entered womanhood.  Alex&#39;s roving hands cupped her still-bloating breasts and tightly cupped them. As he did, he swiftly removed his penis from Ryan&#39;s asshole and guided it to Ryan&#39;s fresh vagina. He ventured past the labia and penetrated the newly formed hymen. From then the fucking resumed, as Ryan bucked like a creature possessed while Alex rammed away like a rutting beast. They continued copulating doggy-style until both went into orgasm...whereupon they howled at the moon.</p>
