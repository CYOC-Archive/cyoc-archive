<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Ty walked through the woods, he heard strange sounds all around him, the most unusual being the chitter and chatter of small voices and tiny laughs coming from seemed to be every direction.  The further he waded into the thick forest, the more numerous the sounds became until finally Ty had to take a moment in a small clearing to gather himself.  The clearing had a little sunlight shining down, as well as small creek burbling next to it.  In the darkness beyond, he could see small sparks of light flit about, just visible to see but not enough to make out what was causing them.  It was as he was watching the lights flicker about, that he felt something whiz past his ear.  Looking around suddenly, he saw nothing.  Another flew by, lightly smacking his head, followed by a cacophony of shrill cackling.  Whirling around, Ty’s vision was filled with greens and purples as something small but strong smacked into his face.  <br />
<br />
He suddenly felt immense vertigo as his head told him he was moving rapidly, but oddly enough his body felt completely stationary.  After a moment, the colors moved to the sides of his vision and he saw the cause of his motion sickness.  His view had changed drastically, and now it seemed as though he was floating high above the clearing, able to see even above the trees.  More concerning, however, was that it seemed only part of him was above the tree line, as his view down showed him a sight he was having some trouble understanding.  Several meters down, a monk, headless, was swatting at various bright colored spots that flickered around her body, swatting at them uselessly.  His body.  His body was down there, and somehow he, or his head, was up in the sky. <br />
<br />
Ty screamed, only to head vicious laughter in both of his ears.  From the sides of his vision, two faces appeared.  They were small, slender humanoid faces with wide, sharp toothed smiles and insect like black eyes, with wild tangles of hair and a set of antennae.  To Ty, the looked like some depictions of faeries he had seen.  The giggled, patting his head as they flew him around the clearing, coming closer and closer to his body, only to fly back up at the last moment.  “H-Hey!  Put me down this instant!” Ty sputtered, not sure what else to do.<br />
<br />
One of the little critters cackled and slapped his nose, “Heehee, the stupid head wants to go back!,” it tittered, “Stupid head is too fun, no give!” They said and begin to twirl him around and around.  After a bit of this, Ty began to truly feel sick, and it was not long until his guts came back up with a roiling fury.  Thankfully it didn’t seem to land on his body, but the faeries immediately became disgusted with his head, chucking it from the sky like a discarded toy.  Ty screamed as his head plummeted to the earth, but was caught t the last second by a handful of faeries. <br />
<br />
“Gross head!  Dick head!  Dick head!  We make you one!  We make we make!” They sang as they floated his head over to his body.  His head swimming, Ty was barely able to register that somehow the little bastards had managed to strip his headless body, which itself was wobbling around lamely, suffering the same vertigo his head was.  A couple of flashes of light around his arms, and suddenly they fell to the forest floor, flopping about like caught fish.  A moment later, his legs went out from under him, landing about a foot away from his tumbling torso.  It crashed to the ground, stomach first, causing him to wince as his tits slammed into the grass.  <br />
<br />
“Pussy?Pussypussypussy?  Where is cunt?  Need big cunt for dick head!” Cried out on the creatures.  A few seconds later and a vagina came flying out of the darkness and slammed into the faerie, knocking them to the ground and landing on top of them.  The faeire got up wuickly, shaking her head and picking up the cunt that was bigger than herself.  It was an odd looking one, violet purple in color, with larger even darker purple lips and vulva, along with a large throbbing clit and an unshaven crop of dark black hair.  It was sopping wet and twitching,   The faerie cackled madly as they flew it over to the blank spot in Ty’s shoulders and slapped it on Ty’s body, clit facing towards his chest and taking the spot of his neck.  Immediately Ty felt it, and also felt the raw sexual lust exuding from the large pussy.<br />
<br />
“Peepee!  Needitneeditneedit, need it now!”  Once more from the woods flew a cock, a massive purple thing that flopped about wildly as the faeries just barely caught it, spinning madly in the air before correcting itself.  It was ridiculous, easily the length of Ty’s forearm and almost as thick, with a ballsack that looked more like a pair of oranges in a bag than real testicles.  It seemed to be the same color as the vagina, but Ty could not tell.  Without much time to process this, Ty’s head was spun around as something slammed down onto the blank side under his neck, hard.  Immediately his head began to feel flush and his lust rose to unbearable levels.  He felt something on his neck become hard, while something behind his head hung heavily, jiggling. <br />
<br />
The faeries, now so loud their laughter was the only thing he could hear, brought his head over to his torso, giving him a perfect view of the fat cunt that now called the spot between his shoulders home.  Suddenly, his vision was flipped so he was looking at the sky, and then the fey rammed his dickneck into his upper cunt.  He cried out in ecstasy and was quickly consumed by lust as his brain faded from consciousness.  <br />
<br />
Some time later, Ty was not sure how long, he awoke to the worst feeling of a sore groin, several of them in fact, and found his nose smashed against something gross and musky.  He let out a groan, then sounds of disgust as he tried to wiggle his head away from the heady smell.  His arms and legs seemed to fail him, unable to assist, but eventually he was able to roll his torso over, letting his head fall away from the big red ass that had been smothering it.  Ty looked around in shock, seeing his limbless body roll away from his head.  Then the previous few hours slammed back into him:  the faeries having their way with him, using the cock attached to his neck to assault each and every one of his holes for hours, and him, ashamedly, enjoying it while lost in the thralls of lust.  Thralls he felt even now, although to a much lesser degree.  Most likely the genitalia he had been fused with were the culprits of this.  However, there was time to think about that later.  Currently, Ty figured, eh was totally fucked, and not in the way he had been just a little while ago.  He was stuck, in the dark magic woods, without any limbs or a head attached to his body, he had an extra pussy between his shoulders, his neck was now a huge prick, and worse yet, he was starting to feel like it needed release again.</p>
