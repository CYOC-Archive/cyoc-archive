<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Who am responsible for this?” Kyl-Kyl asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;The orgy happened spontaneously little masters,&quot; said the hobgoblin football player. <br />
<br />
&quot;No, gobbo mean who gobbo hogobbo?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh... when two hobgoblins love each other very much...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ugh! Right! Gobbo retcon, forgot gobbo say anything, that order.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Master.&quot;<br />
<br />
While Jen was being plowed from the front, Kyl causally joined in the rear. <br />
<br />
&quot;Asking that waste of gobbos time,&quot; Jen Jen said without missing a beat. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes it was. But best know if gobbo use retcon or not.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Me figure it make things simpler,&quot; said Sam Sam, where she was being screwed by multiple hobgoblins at once. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh! You do this Sam-Sam?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I figured hobgoblins make good minions to goblins. Dragons have kobolds, why not we goblins have hobgoblins?... Though I see you&#39;ve been busy.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Kyl-Kyl be busy, gobbo grandparents and grandparents of other gobbos... and gobbo make trash-stain humies treating elders like house plants into golems!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;... I can&#39;t say I feel sorry for them,&quot; Samantha admitted. <br />
<br />
&quot;What does Master speak of?&quot; Max asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hobgobbos not think about what gobbos discussing, not remember, not speak about,&quot; Jen-Jen ordered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mistress, we hear and obey,&quot; echoed the hobgoblins.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jen-Jen impress, and think, Jen-Jen worried Sam-Sam not real gobbo because gobbo remember old world and not talk like gobbo.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, I have to say what I&#39;ve become is an improvement. And because I like you guys, I&#39;m going to warn you. When the witches placed the curse on the town, they never intended the &#39;game&#39; to end. That&#39;s why new versions of the curse will pop up even when people order others to never use the curse on anyone ever. But it also means that they&#39;ll sometimes twist fate to brute force reality base to a &#39;baseline&#39; if things begin to change the world passed the point it&#39;d be recognizable and make the changes no longer strange... Though it&#39;s theorized that it could just branch off and create a new timeline where the curse serves it purpose and fizzles out while the baseline continues.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Gobbos smart, gobbos figure out how avoid quantum reversion trigger... erm, parents do... Jen-Jen not quiet that smart enough to alter fate with science yet.&quot; <br />
<br />
The goblins causally chatted as the hobgoblin flesh was jabbed into their bodies with all the passion and love of a piston. Neither so much as looked at the goblins that sated their endless lust. <br />
<br />
Jen-Jen realized the fertility among goblins must have been downright awful if they were all such nymphomaniacs and their population hadn&#39;t exploded as was. Their constant sex wasn&#39;t just a pass time, it was downright necessary for survival! <br />
<br />
Kyl also chose to show off his wand. The wand was carved to resemble a particularly shapely goblin holding up the glowing green emerald.  &quot;Gobbo create wand after chat with Kobold who have wand too.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You chatted with a Kobold?!&quot; Sam asked alarmed. <br />
<br />
&quot;Kobold not bad, just want to fix up world too. Jak-Jak make other humie elders into baby draccos.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;The magical power contained without me puts your magic to shame,&quot; telepathically spoke to Samantha.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wand speak?!&quot; Kyl asked bewildered. <br />
<br />
&quot;You never commanded that I not be able to communicate with you Master,&quot; said the goblin wand. &quot;You also did not implement this change retroactively. I am completely at your service in my new state.&quot; The wand said nothing about having a brother to support, after all, with the goblin public service system, he&#39;d be taken care of by every possible need anyway. <br />
<br />
+++<br />
<br />
Goblins had gone from fantasy, to the privileged elite in one day, thanks to Kyle Perkins&#39;s revenge on Jennifer Smith. <br />
<br />
Jen even saw goblins riding on motor bikes with built in dilos and similar &#39;inserts&#39; for males. <br />
<br />
Across the street was a giant Japanese household, filled with an entire community of naked fox people. Jen had never thought about it before, but now knew they too were a direct or indirect result of the curse. <br />
<br />
Her family estate was now a love sonnet to the tribal, the technological, and the disgusting. While being hammered by the hobgoblins had been one thing, she hadn&#39;t gotten her dream of being objectified by everyone around her as an exchangeable sex object. A glorified flesh and blood sex doll. And with the stripping away of restrictions on goblins, Jen knew no one would judge her for her fantasy. <br />
<br />
Jen-Jen did note the letter from herself of this native reality was gone... that made sense... being completely surrounded by goblins her entire life, she was no reason for her to suspect the curse was directly connected to her. <br />
<br />
Though it did leave Jen-Jen so existential questions, if reality really had been retroactively changed so she&#39;d always been a goblin... what happened to the Jen who had existed before her? The one who had lived her life up until today? It actually made Jen shiver. <br />
<br />
Pearl and Martha worked in perfect sync, unphased and indifferent to the wild sex going on around them. Pearl knew she&#39;d stolen Martha&#39;s life from her... but her new undying loyalty to Jen-Jen was greater than any enchantment or brainwashing, she hadn&#39;t been lying when she said if Jen had ordered her to set the world on fire, she&#39;d have done so without hesitation. <br />
<br />
After the whole day, Jen was happy to go straight to bed, her room now half science lab, and one half kink dungeon, she realized she had a big objectification fetish... devices for turning herself to stone, gold, plastic, rubber, glass, a wooden puppet. She was going to use them when she remembered, <br />
<br />
&quot;OH CRUDE! TOMORROW THE GAME AGAINST FIVE-FLAMES HIGH!&quot; Jen went straight to bed. Even if she was now a super genius nudist goblin nympho maniac, she was still a cheerleader and determined to fulfill her duty! <br />
<br />
++++<br />
<br />
Kyl-Kyl&#39;s great-grandmother was not in a rest home... she was in hospice. She over a hundred years old. But time it seemed had gotten tired of waiting. <br />
<br />
&quot;So she is become the first goblin born Master?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re aware of the change?&quot; Kyl asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;They are transformed by my magic Master, of course I am aware of changes in reality.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kyl wanted to tell the wand to be quiet, but, it felt good to have a neutral companion somehow.<br />
<br />
Kyl-Kyl knew he&#39;d remade the world a lot today. But there was one last change to make today. <br />
<br />
His family house was filled with the latest technology, and several fetish material out in the open. It was a Warriors of Worlds style goblin house, filled with Star Traveler style technology, mixed with a sex crazy teenager&#39;s fantasy world. <br />
<br />
But Kyl-Kyl ignored it, and he ignored whatever his new goblinfied parents were doing, he went upstairs and hearing the noise of life support equipment, he found his grandmother. At least her comforts were far better than they&#39;d been this morning. She was in no condition to respond to &#39;transform or dare&#39;. Getting out of bed was already beyond her. <br />
<br />
Kyl simply used the wand. And in a flash, it was done. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hello Great-Grandson, nice of you to come in person to see your Matriarch.&quot;<br />
<br />
She was huge. <br />
<br />
Her head at two three times the size of any human. she had electrodes connected to her bald head in various places. A huge belly flopped forward along with similar giant breasts that obscured a lot of her figure. Her rear and crotch were fused with a device built into her chair. Kyl-Kyl realized on top of providing biological needs, it also functioned a tireless double dilo, his great-grandmother was being stimulated every moment of her life. Her skinny arms and legs rested on a throne that was one part savage barbarian, and one smooth part technological wonder. <br />
<br />
Too eager to wait, Kyl-Kyl material his phone out of quantum storage space and check news and history related to gram-gram and goblins in general. <br />
<br />
Kyl-Kyl noticed that gobbo architecture had continued its theme of combining the high tech, tribal and lewd. The vulgarity of some of the figures were enough to even make his goblin eyes bulge in shock! <br />
<br />
His Great-Grandmother&#39;s formal title was now &#39;Goblin Queen&#39; even if she wasn&#39;t technically royalty, none was going to argue with her. <br />
<br />
The population of Gobbos world wide ... was 63,459,781. Spread out over the entire country. <br />
<br />
Kyl-Kyl&#39;s grandmother&#39;s maternal-gobbo robots had in fact been invented decades earlier! In the 1970s!<br />
<br />
Kyl-Kyl&#39;s great-grandmother had been a passionate conservative as a human, and it seemed even now as a sex-happy goblin leading an entire species of sex-happy goblins, some of those traits remained. <br />
<br />
Women came from all over the country to &#39;donate&#39; to their country&#39;s miracle workers who had ensured their country&#39;s technological and economic dominance.<br />
<br />
Gobbos also now retroactively had a power base in Los Angelas, New York, Austin, Miami, Topeka, and this tourist trap tiny town in Oregon surrounded by redwoods for miles for some reason. <br />
<br />
Instead of this goblin population boom resulting in a depleting of resources, every goblin brain was treated as a precious treasure. Education was given top priority, mental health issues were thoroughly checked for and given the greatest professional help money could buy. As for genetic deformities or disabilities, the goblin transformation had taken care of that by itself. <br />
<br />
All these genius level goblin brains had resulted in leaps in technological progress compared to the old reality. Cold fusion was safe, affordable, and common. Breeder reactors were fully tested and implemented. <br />
<br />
Nanite/bacteria &#39;cyborg&#39; microbes were the latest creation in the news, devouring plastics and only the plastics they were implemented to consume. <br />
<br />
The oil industry had switched to plastics rather than gasoline, and the coal industry was now a niche market for people who liked a real life fireplace in their home. <br />
<br />
Fully functional AI, given thousands of years of ethical and moral testing in the span of a few years in a quantum computing state, and now happily served humans, dragons, kobolds, and goblinkind in overseeing their logistics and countless other tasks. <br />
<br />
Synthetically grown meat was cheap and available, with game farms reduced to a niche market for those who enjoyed killing their own food. Not to mention the algae farms on the ocean. <br />
<br />
Oh, and they&#39;d cured cancer. <br />
<br />
Needless to say, Glendale was now the state capital in this reality. Of course, the Draconian Harem Pleasure Palace was still the tallest building in the city, taking up multiple city blocks, it was practically it&#39;s own self-contained district. <br />
<br />
The entertainment media was as cutthroat as ever, but trying enforce copyright laws had become almost a joke, ACTUALLY forcing companies to churn out new and better products rather than mindlessly rehashing the same ideas over and over again and hoarding them to themselves. <br />
<br />
Also, as these &#39;rescued pregnancy&#39; goblins grew older and learned of their origins, many formally joined the Catholic Church, strengthening their alliance. <br />
<br />
As a &#39;gift&#39; for ending the &#39;silent genocide&#39;, the Catholic Church had given &#39;special dispensation&#39; with goblins&#39; interaction with themselves and humans. And laws had, as they will, eventually followed suit. <br />
<br />
So while humans were in fact even more conservative when it came to such things in this new reality, they didn&#39;t bat an eyelash at a goblin banging each other on a public bus or in someone else&#39;s home, let alone say a goblin taking a dump on their neighbor&#39;s front yard. A goblin looking for action among humans, well, no one was going to stop them or claim what they were doing was wrong. <br />
<br />
Kyl-Kyl realized he kinda liked this, it meant toying with them would be all the more satisfying. <br />
<br />
None of these applied directly to hobgoblins, if only because they were subservient to goblins anyway and didn&#39;t seek such things among humans anyway. <br />
<br />
The goblins owned countless patents, they had huge market shares in the technological and energy industry, and gigantic economic and political clot. Humans still invented the electric car however. (Not surprising, the first electric car had in fact been invented over a century ago! They&#39;d simply not been practical due to battery life.). <br />
<br />
And while goblins had invented plenty of creative airborn drones, kobolds and dragons still held the lion&#39;s share of the military market (with amazon dragoness mercenaries being a must for any modern army), along with oil, coal, and mining operations.<br />
<br />
Some things never changed, while there there less than 1% the number of dragons compared to gobbos (with a large entourage of kobolds for every dragon), the dragons still held onto roughly half the country&#39;s wealth.  Gobbos by comparison, held about one third. But you wouldn&#39;t know it from the insane rise of public welfare including free entertainment and creature comforts and basic nessities, no one was in a rush to complain about the grotesque wealth inequality. <br />
<br />
And Kyl-Kyl&#39;s great-grandmother was at the center of all of it, every goblin knew her word was law, and her desires were mandates. They were all her loyal pawns who willy did her bidding, efficient cogs who worked tirelessly to increase goblin control of the world, and beloved family she&#39;d do anything to ensure the future of. <br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah! Ze-Ze see. This when Ze-Ze was gobbo&#39;ed. Interesting.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;ACGHG! Great-gram-gram know already!?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Of course Ze-Ze knows! Ze-Ze spent entire life calculating quantum point gobbos &#39;actual&#39; came into existence and retroactively cascade through history after examining and experimenting with Transform or Dare Curse. <br />
<br />
&quot;Imagine if Ze-Ze use quantum &#39;message in a bottle&#39; to little Ze-Ze over a century ago and gobbo ZE-ZE&#39;S parents and grandparents... gobbos could be living in perfect harmonious world where gobbos control everything and hummies are gobbo playthings. And the best part being that gobbos providing hummies such easy and happy lives that hummies will be THANKING US for the honor of being gobbo playthings OF OWN HUMMIE FREE WILL!<br />
<br />
&quot;But Ze-Ze know this Kyl-Kyl and Jen-Jen&#39;s project, great-granny not take it away from you. Just be sure to conquer world before Ze-Ze need to merge soul with Ze-Ze clone or upload brain patterns to super-adding-machine, Ze-Ze not decided if Ze-Ze should do one or both.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Uh... thanks great-gram-gram.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Be sure Kyl-Kyl write down all memories of former reality, be great research material for quantum experimentation.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, sure Gram-gram, Kyl-Kyl do his best.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ze-Ze always know you do sweetie,&quot; his great-grandmother smiled warmly. <br />
<br />
Kyl-Kyl off handedly noted at one of the many holographic displays surrounded his great-grandmother... it showed she was in fact playing five games of online chess at the same time. The players were &#39;RedQueen, BlueQueen, GreenQueen, WhiteQueen, and BlackQueen.&#39; <br />
<br />
Kyl-Kyl wondered what that was about. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ze-Ze imagine Tia&#39; be aware quantum distortion too. She higher dimensional-state, not &#39;entity&#39; in sense of thing that begin existing and stops existing, after all. It  be fun see which of us comes out on top.&quot; <br />
<br />
+++++<br />
<br />
What no one really thought about, was how if the Transform or Dare curse could retcon reality... then couldn&#39;t in this retconned reality, someone use the Transform or Dare curse in a different way? <br />
<br />
Decades ago, long before Greg would use the Transform or Dare on -himself- to become reality&#39;s first dragon, Lord Drakor noticed the rise in the power of goblin kind, their numbers, and their superior charm. <br />
<br />
Kobolds were way smarter than anyone ever gave them credit for, and their fanatical devotion to dragons made them perfect servants. <br />
<br />
But Drakor wasn&#39;t interested in a war of escalation of the kobolds offering the naked apes fancier toys, he wanted an advantage that was all his own. One that dragon kind could hold sway that others would. <br />
<br />
So in the past, the Drakor of the retconned reality, oblivious to Greg who&#39;d use the curse to give himself the life he&#39;d wanted, would use the witch&#39;s curse in a way few had, heh, dared. <br />
<br />
He&#39;d held a fake contest with a &#39;five for free&#39; at one of the restaurants he owned. Then he used the Transform or Dare when they were distracted. <br />
<br />
&quot;You will retroactively become five quintuplet dragon sisters who are blindly loyal to me and will obey me in all things.&quot;<br />
<br />
The family aged up and down, until five beauties stood before him. <br />
<br />
The knelt down and lowered their heads, performing what for them was a daily ritual. &quot;Master, command us.&quot; The five identical dragonesses said. <br />
<br />
&quot;Transform or Dare each other, to retroactive become devoted worshippers of Tiamat, you have prepared your whole lives to become her ideal vessel, it&#39;s what you want more than anything, it&#39;s what you desire more than anything, more than life itself.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Master, we obey.&quot; The five said, and added another layer to the transform or dare. <br />
<br />
Now five priestesses to Tiamat stood, each a different color, their bodies covered in runes and tattoos, their every breath, their every thought, from the moment they&#39;d hatched, had been in preparation for their moment. They had no concern for themselves, or each other. They were but raw material to bring into bring the goddess they&#39;d swore their lives to. <br />
<br />
And their pointed at each other saying, &quot;Transform or Dare!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Both!&quot; They echoed. <br />
<br />
&quot;Become Tiamat&#39;s vessel, be fuel to her fire, you have always been her, who you are now never existed, in this or any other life, there is only Tiamat, has been only Tiamat, will be only Tiamat. It is your only existence.&quot;<br />
<br />
And in that moment, the five dragon priestesses fused together, their former lives, all of them, wiped away, there was only Tiamat, had been only Tiamat, would be only Tiamat. <br />
<br />
Tiamat, a primordial goddess whose name was original meant &#39;chaos&#39; but had evolved to refer to the ocean until it had become the name for the ocean itself, maybe that was were the idea of the &#39;ocean of chaos&#39; people often spoken about had come from. <br />
<br />
She&#39;d been bested by Marduk, god of the city. Civilization had beaten back the chaos of the world. <br />
<br />
But in modern time, people had begun to grant her also the title of &#39;mother of dragons.&#39; <br />
<br />
And before Drakor now stood a towering five headed dragoness, wearing only a simple gold crown on her five heads. She didn&#39;t need to flaunt her wealth. Her power was the only thing she needed to show her glory. <br />
<br />
The heads examined their body, looked at each other, then they turned towards Drakor. <br />
<br />
One of the heads said, &quot;Even when you were human in the old reality you were hungry for power and status... you must have been beyond desperate to warp reality three times in succession to call forth me from beyond the veil.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Queen Tiamat, what do you mean the old reality? When I was human?&quot;<br />
<br />
Another of the heads said, &quot;Ah! I see, you aren&#39;t caught yet with the moment in the old reality where you shaped this reality into existence. This means you won&#39;t remember this conversation, because this line of consciousness of yours is going to end. But don&#39;t worry, that you will continue on as you&#39;d want. Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;ll make sure my children, including you, will be Masters of the world.&quot; <br />
<br />
+++++<br />
<br />
<br />
Ruth Doe, the nine-tailed Kitsune, sat in her lavish mansion across the street from the massive Smith estate. She was on her couch munching popcorn, a flat screen TV displaying the antics of Kyl-Kyl and Jen-Jen, as well as the dragons retroactively summoning an ancient goddess. <br />
<br />
One of her naked, buff, and incredibly handsome anthro fox butlers asked calmly, &quot;Mistress finds this conflict to her liking?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;And I was worried he goblins were gonna expand without any meaningful opposition! Now they actually have someone to play again! This is where things get good!&quot; Ruth giggled. <br />
<br />
&quot;You planning on meddling trickster?&quot; The central head asked even though it was a vision from decades ago. <br />
<br />
&quot;Mother Tiamat who are you speaking to?&quot; Drakor asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just a greek chorus,&quot; said another of the heads to him. <br />
<br />
&quot;Are you kidding?!&quot; said Ruth, not shocked at all that the goddess could sense her observing her from the future. &quot;I thought I&#39;d have to go find another anime convention to turn people into stuff. This is WAY more entertaining! Queen of the Dragons, Queen of the Goblins, Kyl, Jen, little kobolds, I know you&#39;ll give me a good show!&quot; <br />
<br />
+++++<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah crude,&quot; Sam-Sam said.</p>
