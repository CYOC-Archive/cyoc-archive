<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Oh ok&quot; Kyle turned away from Mark to look once more at the new Jason. &quot;So did you do anything else to her? Or should I say him?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Erm.. I made one or two mental changes as well&quot; came the reply. <br />
<br />
Kyle turned back to Mark, looking amused. &quot;What sort of thing do you mean? Anything interesting?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;She, or rather he, is totally under my control and I can make him do anything I want, and even change back to a girl if I call him Jennifer, and back to a guy if I call him Jason&quot;. At the sound of his name the new Jason groaned once more, bending forward slighting and moaning provocatively, making Mark grimace with the effort of not succumbing to his own true feelings. <br />
<br />
Kyle smirked. &quot;Really? That's kinda cool&quot;. Mark was slightly taken aback by the odd look on Kyles face; almost hungry. Mark still didn't know that he was under Kyles control whenever Kyle said the work &quot;Pinocchio&quot;. But now he was drawn to Kyles deep brown eyes and starting to drift off into a fantasy. <br />
<br />
&quot;So let's see&quot; Kyle was speaking again, and Mark was shook out of his reverie, &quot;What shall we do with Jason&quot; - who moaned with pleasure once more, mumbling something about &quot;Again, again, once more!&quot; - &quot;now we have control over him?&quot; continued Kyle grinning at the response Jason was giving each time his name was said. <br />
<br />
&quot;I dunno&quot; lied Mark, who was starting to form an idea, but didn't want to tell Kyle, after all he was afraid of scaring Kyle away and destroying their friendship. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well&quot; Kyle turned back to Mark &quot;we'll need to get the curse back off him at some point&quot; Mark grinned. Things were starting to go his way. &quot;I could get him to use the curse to cure you of the erection thing whenever you lie. Even though its not wood anymore, it must still be annoying to get so hard and have to jack off each time you lie&quot;. Kyle looked thoughtful, Mark had spun the suggestion just right. <br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, it would be good to get rid of that&quot; Kyle was hooked, Mark was leaping for joy inside, but on the surface looked faintly concerned for his friend. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ok, you're sure?&quot;. Kyle nods, and Mark smiles, barely containing himself. &quot;Jason, come over here&quot; Mark commanded, ignoring the gay teenagers bucking hips and moans of pleasure as his name sent waves of pleasure up and down his body. &quot;Now I want you to use the curse on Kyle&quot; Mark and Jason turned to Kyle, barely arms length away. Jason looked at Kyle and said &quot;Transform or Dare?&quot;, and turned back to Mark, awaiting instructions of what to do with the curse. <br />
<br />
&quot;Trans... *mumph*&quot; Kyle started, but Mark had leapt forward, forcing his hand across Kyles mouth. &quot;Sorry mate, but this is for the good of our friendship&quot; he whispered into Kyles ear, with a true look of understanding and wanting to help in his eyes. The colour had drained from Kyles face, his eyes wide with shock. When Mark said his bit, Kyle looked slightly confused, narrowing his eyes slightly and looking back at Mark with those deep brown eyes that Mark loved so much. Mark held his struggling friend for a minute, feeling sorry that he had to do this to the one guy he truly liked, but knowing that it was the only way for them to both be happy. <br />
<br />
&quot;Jason say the following; Because you didn't reply for one minute you get both Kyle. For your transformation your cock will stop getting hard whenever you tell a lie, and you will not need to jack off as soon as it does. For your dare, you will become bisexual&quot; - Kyles eyes widened at this but he could do nothing against Marks embrace - &quot;and be completely cool and understanding of my love for you, and even return it&quot;.<br />
<br />
 Jason, who looked mesmerised by the two guys, blinked and repeated to Kyle what he had been told. As the curse hit him Kyle shuddered, then went limp for a moment, his eyes glossy over and his penis hardening and softening as the curse takes effect. Mark released his friend and laid him on the floor, looking seriously concerned at the lack of movement Kyle was displaying. Kneeling down on the floor next to him he looked into Kyles blank, beautiful brown eyes, for some flicker of life. &quot;What have I done!? I have hurt him!&quot; Mark exclaims, a tear escaping his eye. He moves down and places a kiss on Kyles lips, dreaming of what could have been. <br />
<br />
At that moment Kyle's mind cam back, his eyes sparkled and he realised he was being kissed by a really cute guy. Returning it, Mark suddenly sat up &quot;You're ok!&quot;. &quot;Apparently&quot; replied Kyle moving up onto his elbows and staring into Mark's face. &quot;Your choice of curse surprised me, but I can understand why you did it, it's all so clear and wonderful. You did it for our friendship, for all those times you have been with me and I haven't realised that you wanted to be more than just friends. I'm so sorry mate.&quot; <br />
<br />
Mark stood up looking surprised; he hadn't expected his dare to work so well. &quot;Give us a hand up&quot; Kyle called to him, breaking the moment of realisation. Reaching down he grabbed Kyles palm and pulled him upright.<br />
<br />
 &quot;So what shall we do now?&quot; asked Kyle, looking from Mark to Jason, who was gazing at the pair with obvious lust on his face. <br />
<br />
Mark grinned. &quot;Well we could...</p>
