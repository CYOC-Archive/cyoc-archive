<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jasmine came out of the door with a fair number of things on her mind, though she also had to admit that math was never her strong suit. She took what she needed to get by, but she never figured she&#39;d have to worry too much about many of the higher aspects of the subject, which was a big part of why she&#39;d nearly nodded off during the first period lesson. To some degree, things with Rachel were doing better as Rachel seemed almost chipper when she came back from her meeting with the werecat pride that she went to, at least from what Jasmine was told in the morning. And while a part of her wanted to get her teasing in regarding Rachel and Cynthia, but in noticing the blushes from both of them that morning at breakfast, Jasmine couldn&#39;t bring herself to do that... and on a private level, it gave Jasmine some optimism that Rachel would be okay.<br />
<br />
Though, the thing that kept her a bit groggy and slow was a combination of some private frustration that she wasn&#39;t getting the sort of attention that she enjoyed in Florida. The boys at Moon Lake High were all fairly attractive and well built, and there were only a small handful that were more &quot;normal.&quot; They were often a bit more attentive to her, but they also seemed hesitant at times, which only added to some of Jasmine&#39;s greater attention on the boys that she figured were weres, as she had observed they could be quite confident when they wanted to be, and it was a sort of attention that Jasmine felt could help her win things over and maybe find something worth keeping. But they often didn&#39;t respond as openly to her as she wanted, and that was frustrating.<br />
<br />
The other thing was the memory of the dream she&#39;d had. Being older and enjoying a party with lots of male weres in their human forms and eying her with love and adoration, just as she was used to in Florida, and in a way that let her feel in control while looking around for the proverbial &quot;Mr. Right.&quot; Only to run into an old boyfriend from Florida, William Abernathy, and the only boyfriend from Florida, that was anything more than a date, some flirting, and then moving on. Some of that she couldn&#39;t explain. She found Bill attractive and athletic and fun in many ways, but she just figured a lot of things weren&#39;t that serious while in high school. After all, her parents hadn&#39;t been high school sweethearts, and her father bolted after Rachel was raped and over Rachel&#39;s sexuality. So, to Rachel, why would anyone be super serious while in high school? And while Bill&#39;s attention and staying in touch with her, was... touching, Jasmine had no expectation of ever seeing him again. <br />
<br />
Thus, there was the decision to move on, and yet she&#39;d had that kind of dream about him and the memories of that were still on her mind as she left her math class, though she skidded to a stop as a flash of plaid came in front of her. She skidded to a stop as she looked up to a guy in a sort of plaid button-down shirt that would look more like someone dressing up like Paul Bunyon or a stereotypical lumberjack. He had short red hair and a relatively square head, and was someone that Jasmine actually shared her second period class with. His broad shoulders and obvious muscle mass, even for a teen was intriguing, but Jasmine wasn&#39;t necessarily into the fashion sense he had.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey there, be careful!&quot; the male teen commented as he took a step back and raising an arm, as if to shield him, &quot;no were here will go out of their way to hurt you... but running into one by accident wouldn&#39;t always have good results.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry,&quot; Jasmine managed, &quot;just thinking over things...&quot;<br />
<br />
She didn&#39;t think his answer was aggressive, but that didn&#39;t mean she wanted to do anything that would be antagonistic or dishonest. She then watched as he gave a gesture of one arm to usher her forward. Jasmine slowly did so and moved along with him.<br />
<br />
&quot;And thinking on what?&quot; the male teen asked, &quot;if I may ask.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Look...&quot; Jasmine began and then realized she didn&#39;t know his name.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tim... Tim Beaverbrook,&quot; he answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tim, I&#39;m sorry for not paying attention,&quot; Jasmine spoke, &quot;that was dumb of me...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And I get that,&quot; Tim nodded, &quot;but you have to be thinking of something big to be that... zoned out. And that&#39;s never a good thing to hold all that in. You got trouble at home?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jasmine sighed and got the sense that she wasn&#39;t going to avoid it, particularly as the two of them had the next class together, &quot;it&#39;s not really trouble... my sister is doing better.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s good to hear,&quot; Tim spoke in a friendly tone.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s more frustration with not getting attention or attention returned,&quot; Jasmine answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ve gotten plenty of attention, trust me,&quot; Tim answered, &quot;it&#39;s not every day that a normal human family moves in, with a werecat with them and the rest of the family is already built like a were and one with the personality of a werefox.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Personality of a werefox?&quot; Jasmine asked as they went into another room for their English literature, an AP class, was.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is going to be pretty general, as I&#39;m a werebear,&quot; Tim answered, &quot;but werefoxes tend to be pretty flirty and openly so. Often because if you talk to one... you&#39;ll find they boast about how hot their females are and how wonderful their males are and how great they are in bed. Or how open and even eager they are for sex, which says something for a were...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Is it wrong to want a boy&#39;s company?&quot; Jasmine asked with narrowed eyes, but noting that Tim actually looked calm, understanding, and in some ways friendly. She may not personally go for the &quot;Paul Bunyon&quot; look he pulled off, and the sound of his work boots thumped on the tile floor, but she could respect a friendly tone.<br />
<br />
&quot;There&#39;s nothing wrong with that... just as there is nothing necessarily wrong with my interest in women,&quot; Tim answered, &quot;but there can be time where a lot of that flirtation on a werefox&#39;s part can be annoying to some weres, and particularly non-werefoxes. Particularly when they also enjoy nights for pranks and so on... and at the same time, as a normal human, many weres, regardless of whether or not they might be into you... will be careful.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why? I can&#39;t hurt them... at least not physically anyway,&quot; Jasmine countered as they sat down in the back of the classroom and watched others take their seats.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not physically... but emotionally, could be something different,&quot; Tim countered, &quot;and while werefoxes may be flirtatious, supposedly when they find someone, they truly bond with... that bond is unbreakable and lasts forever. It&#39;s like they go from being open flirts to deep romantics in an instant. To a great degree, I like the bonded werefoxes.&quot;<br />
<br />
That&#39;s something that made Jasmine think of William Abernathy and how he changed after she gave him a hand job. It made her wonder more things, as maybe Leslie wasn&#39;t the only secret were out there. But Bill was still in Florida, as he&#39;d actually shared some things on what was going on there the previous afternoon.<br />
<br />
&quot;And then there is the obvious concerns over the fact that you&#39;re a normal human,&quot; Tim spoke, &quot;for as I&#39;m sure your sister can tell you... becoming a were is lifetime decision. If you want to become a were... that&#39;s one thing, but no were should fall for something that could lead to you becoming a were against your will or the wrong were... or becoming pregnant because you don&#39;t have the birth control pill for that were species.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... I&#39;m not opposed to it,&quot; Jasmine answered, &quot;as there is a lot to like about you male weres... I just wouldn&#39;t know for sure what to go for. But I&#39;d just like some attention.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tim chuckled, &quot;attention is one thing... but don&#39;t try to push things. Particularly when many weres are also looking for lasting relationships, and that probably includes the werefoxes.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jasmine blinked and nodded as she looked over to him. She wasn&#39;t necessarily interested in him from the &quot;romantic&quot; side of things, but he was calm and understanding, and that at least made for good conversation as the teacher began to take attendance for the class.</p>
