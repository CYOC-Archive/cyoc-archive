<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Xeniko stood in front of her bedroom mirror, fiddling with the hem of her new outfit—a snug hoodie that clung to her smaller frame and a pair of jeans that fit her widened hips perfectly. She sighed, her delicate hands brushing through her jet-black chin-length hair, which she’d trimmed to avoid dealing with the full cascade it wanted to become.<br />
<br />
“I can’t believe this is me now,” she muttered, her voice soft and unfamiliar. It carried a melodic lilt, an alien sound to her ears compared to the rougher tones she’d grown up with. Her bright purple eyes, magnified by her new, stylish glasses, narrowed as she examined her reflection. The petite, busty Japanese girl staring back at her was surreal, like she’d stepped into someone else’s skin.<br />
<br />
Her phone buzzed on the desk, breaking her self-reflection. She glanced over at the screen and saw the name of her best friend, Greg. For a moment, she hesitated, her new emotions stirring a strange mix of nervousness and excitement. Greg had always been awkward around girls, and now Xeniko...well, now she was one.<br />
<br />
Taking a deep breath, she picked up the phone and dialed him. After a few rings, his voice came through, hesitant and muffled.<br />
<br />
“Uh, hey, Xenom. Or, um, Xeniko now?” Greg sounded unsure, his words rushed.<br />
<br />
“It’s Xeniko,” she replied with a small smile. “Don’t worry, I’m still me. Just...different.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, I, uh, I saw your texts. I didn’t know what to say,” Greg stammered. “Are you okay? I mean, is everything okay?”<br />
<br />
Xeniko chuckled softly. “It’s weird, Greg. Like, super weird. But I’m figuring it out.” She hesitated before adding, “Hey, why don’t you come over? We can talk. I promise I don’t bite.”<br />
<br />
After a long pause, Greg agreed. An hour later, Xeniko found herself pacing the living room, her nerves bubbling up. When the doorbell rang, she took another deep breath and opened the door to see Greg, his face flushed, shifting uncomfortably as he held a box of cookies.<br />
<br />
“Hey,” he said awkwardly, his eyes darting anywhere but at her.<br />
<br />
“Hey,” Xeniko replied, smiling warmly. “Come in.”<br />
<br />
As Greg stepped inside, he kept stealing glances at her, his cheeks growing redder by the second. Finally, he blurted out, “You look...different. I mean, not bad! Just, uh—”<br />
<br />
“Relax, Greg,” Xeniko interrupted with a laugh, motioning him to sit down. “It’s still me. The same nerdy person who beats you at every game we play. Except now I look like this.”<br />
<br />
Greg’s laugh was nervous, but he managed to meet her gaze. “It’s just—girls make me nervous, and now you’re, like...a girl.”<br />
<br />
“Well, we need to fix that,” Xeniko said with a sly smile, leaning forward slightly. “You’re my best friend, Greg. I need you to not freak out every time you look at me. And honestly...I could use some support.”<br />
<br />
Greg nodded quickly, his hands gripping the edge of the couch. “Okay. I’ll try. I mean, I’ll get used to it.”<br />
<br />
“Good,” Xeniko said. She hesitated, then added teasingly, “Because I’ve been thinking... I need a boyfriend before school starts. I’m not going back without one. Maybe you can help me practice, so I don’t embarrass myself.”<br />
<br />
Greg’s face turned scarlet, his eyes wide. “Uh, p-practice?!”<br />
<br />
Xeniko laughed, shaking her head. “Relax, Greg. I’m kidding. Mostly.”<br />
<br />
As they both laughed, the tension in the room eased, and for the first time in weeks, Xeniko felt like things might actually be okay.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
As Greg shifted nervously on the couch, Xeniko watched him closely, a mischievous smile curling on her lips. She leaned forward, her chin resting in her palm, her ample chest pressing slightly against the edge of the table between them.<br />
<br />
“You know, Greg,” she said, her voice playful, “you’re kind of cute when you’re flustered.”<br />
<br />
Greg’s face turned an even deeper shade of red, and he stammered, “I—I don’t know what you’re talking about.” He averted his eyes, but Xeniko wasn’t about to let him off the hook.<br />
<br />
She slid onto the couch next to him, closing the distance with an ease that made Greg’s breath hitch. “Come on,” she teased, her tone light but laced with something more. “You’ve been staring at me like you don’t know whether to run or—”<br />
<br />
“Xeniko!” Greg interrupted, his voice cracking.<br />
<br />
Before he could say another word, she leaned in, her lips brushing against his. It was a fleeting kiss at first, soft and tentative, but when she felt him freeze, she pressed a little more, her hand resting lightly on his arm.<br />
<br />
Greg’s reaction was instant—and completely chaotic. He jumped back, almost tumbling off the couch, his eyes wide with panic. “What are you doing?!” he exclaimed, his voice a mixture of shock and bewilderment.<br />
<br />
Xeniko tilted her head, a pout forming on her lips. “What?” she asked innocently, though the glimmer in her eyes betrayed her. “I’m just...experimenting.”<br />
<br />
“Experimenting?!” Greg practically yelped. He scrambled to his feet, his hands shaking slightly. “You can’t just—just do that!”<br />
<br />
Xeniko sighed dramatically, leaning back against the couch, her arms draped lazily over the backrest. “Greg, relax. It’s not like I’m asking you to marry me.” She paused, her playful smirk fading slightly as a more honest thought crept into her voice. “I just...I don’t know. This body—it’s different. I’m different. I guess I wanted to see how it feels. But hey, if you’re not into it—”<br />
<br />
“I—I gotta go,” Greg stammered, grabbing his backpack and heading for the door like the couch had caught fire.<br />
<br />
“Greg—” Xeniko called after him, but the door slammed shut before she could finish.<br />
<br />
She sat there for a moment, staring at the door, before letting out a long sigh. Her hands moved instinctively to her hips, where the snug fabric of her jeans emphasized every curve. A part of her had hoped Greg might...well, might have reacted differently. Not necessarily with love or passion, but something more than the panicked retreat he’d just made.<br />
<br />
Her fingers drummed idly against the armrest as she muttered to herself, “This body...this stupid body. It just wants things.” She bit her lip, her mind flitting uncomfortably to the heat that seemed to linger in her chest and lower, the same heat that had made her push boundaries with Greg.<br />
<br />
Letting out another sigh, she flopped onto her back on the couch, staring at the ceiling. “Great. Now I’ve scared off my best friend.” Her voice softened, a hint of longing seeping into her words. “I just...need someone who can handle this. Someone who can...keep up.”<br />
<br />
She let her eyes close, her mind drifting as her body thrummed with a restless energy she wasn’t sure how to handle.</p>
