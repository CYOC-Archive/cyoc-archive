<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">(Back at the poolhouse the next morning)<br />
<br />
Throughout the night, Will was having strange dreams. They went in and out of focus, he stirred around atop the massive pillow top California-King mattress. Fears of being stuck in the body of a twenty-something ‘jogger’ filtered through his subconscious mind. Having to adapt to the body and adjust his life accordingly and all that entailed. That thought and the gleaming light smacking him in the face, caused him to sit up with a slight gasp as he suddenly awoke. “Oh shit…” His hand went to his bare chest…he felt around his nude torso. He’d lost the sweatshirt some time last night, it happened from time to time, he’d shuck all his clothing throughout the night. Will looked down at his nakedness. “I never looked this hot though, and that’s a fact.”<br />
<br />
 His hands swept back his long strands of hair, pushing it behind his ears, Will slowly jumped to the floor which was a foot or two down for him. The force caused his breasts to sway seductively, he had to cup them to steady himself, another tingle of excitement warmed its way through his body. “I’ll never get used to this…I’m really okay with that, heh.” Briefly he looked for the sweatshirt, but it had to be lost somewhere in the large mass of covers. Will walked over to the closet and grabbed the closest thing he could find to normal in there, a pink satin robe. Begrudgingly he quickly donned it. Tying the sash in a loose knot, Will sighed, seeing it covered just down to mid-thigh. “Damn girl! She has to buy some clothes that “cover” something…ah hell, who am I kidding, if Megan wore all this stuff I wouldn’t mind one bit.”<br />
<br />
Something caught his attention on the dresser, he walked across the room to it. On top was a letter from Jake; “Hey buddy, saw you sleeping, I tried to wake you before I went to work. Obviously that didn’t work, but I got a nice view. Haha. Well, Debbie will be gone until 8 o’clock tonight, she’s got a big project she’s working on. I managed to translate some of the bottle, call me when you get the chance. Left the shade open, I figured that would probably do the trick, hope it worked.” That part kind of made Will chuckle that it in fact had worked perfectly. “I’ll be home around 5:00, try to entertain yourself, I figured we could head to the shop after work, then to Megan’s for your keys. Give you some quality time with yourself and all that.”<br />
<br />
Will looked around as he put the note back down. “A mansion with a million and one things to do in, I think I can manage.” He smiled, walking toward the stairs, he kind of liked how light he was now as he walked, almost gliding. He didn't hear the normal rough thud of his foot on the ground. Will made his way to the kitchen to find something to make, he was hungry, not having eaten since the whole thing happened. Studying the kitchen, Will decided the thing that sounded most appealing right now was the fruit. Which stuck him as slightly odd, he’d never craved fruit before, but he was soon chopping them up into a nice fruit salad. “This body just comes with more and more mysteries.” <br />
<br />
After finishing his refreshingly healthy breakfast, Will decided it was time to for once have some fun in this adopted body of his. “I think I’ve earned it, don’t think I really deserve to be here in the first place…but I may as well enjoy the perks while I have them.” As Will walked back toward the stairs he saw the clock reading it was nearly 11 AM, he had six hours to burn before Jake got back. “Plenty of time to see this body for all it’s worth…” He walked in front of the mirror on top of the dresser, as he strolled upstairs. As he got closer to the mirrored beauty, he slowly opened the front of the robe, seeing the hints of his tanlines on his supple breasts. It was too much for Will to resist, he pulled the robe off quickly. The triangle patches of ivory skin where the bikini hid them from the sun, it only enticed Will more. He saw the same with his rump and groin, it looked sexy, but he preferred girls with all over tans.<br />
<br />
<br />
Looking over the various products on display in front of him, Will seemingly picked a few random items and began to apply them. With what Will momentarily assumed was blind luck, he managed to make himself look all the more attractive with the blush, eyeliner, and lip gloss. They all said the same thing; non-smear and/or no mess, a damp heated cloth was needed to remove it. “Eva really knows her make-up, it’s kind of scary that I used them so easily. I guess it came with the body, I hope not a whole lot more came with it…” Before he went to riffle through Eva’s dresser, Will ran a brush through his hair, making it soft and beautifully flowing once again.<br />
<br />
Will wanted to see this body dressed in anything and everything the sexy little Eva had hidden in her drawers. First he opened up all the shades to let in all the light, he wanted the perfect view. Will scoped out the windows to make sure no one was around. “There’s not a house for miles, fantastic!” He said he was rather excited by the free range he’d just been granted. “Worth a little sacrifice to have some freedoms.” Will walked back over to the dresser, opening the top one first. A bunch of bras and various panties, all were ranging in style and sexiness. As much as he hated to admit it, he'd always dreamt of controlling a girls body like this, but always chalked it up to fantasy. Now he was finally able to live it out and he was going to embrace it for now.<br />
<br />
 “Lets see what the little chica’s got…” The first thing Will found that wasn't an undergarment, it was a stash of belly button rings in a small rectangular box, he looked through the lot of them. Laughing as he found one that had a little cock and balls on it, he continued looking through them, there were so many. “For any and all occasions…” A few of them were cheap looking but the majority looked like they cost a little something extra, one even said “SLUT” in gleaming stones. He grabbed one that wasn't too gaudy looking, quickly unscrewing the ball, the odd sensation of the cool metal being inserted into it’s piercing made Will shudder. Yet, the sight of the twinkling flower made of gems and white gold sitting in the middle of his firm tanned belly was perfect.<br />
<br />
Looking around for a few more minutes, Will found a small ring with a ball in the center of it connecting to ends of the ring, there was no mistaking what it was. “What the hell, why not.” He argued to himself as he took the ball off and once again felt an odd, yet more intense than the previous one felt. It was made slightly easier by his nipples becoming erect from his own touch, looping the ring through tip of his right nipple, Will replaced the ball in it’s proper place. He gently pulled on the ringed nipple, it was definitely a tad more intense with the piercing in. A damp feeling coming from Will’s exposed crotch drew his attention to that area. He'd tried his best until that moment to keep his hands from lingering too far south. But now with the nipple ring, it made him realize there might be another piercing on his sensitive new lips. It seemed like the perfect excuse to investigate, Will’s delicately small hand reached toward his moistened slit.<br />
<br />
The small fingers slipped down past the landing strip and simply grazing the soft lips had sent a chill through him, not overly intense just something he’d never experienced. It scared him, he didn’t want to like it too much. Soon though his fingers searched the delicate folds for any sign of a hole piercing there. Will sighed in relief, “Wouldn’t know how to handle that.” Though he’d finished his exploring for the piercing, Will found his left hand was lingering, massaging the folds of his lips and his new clit. A smile crossed his face as he watched the girl in the mirror playing with herself, her opposite hand was teasing the little ring that hung at the tip of the supple flesh. Shaking his head from the exciting feeling that was becoming very evident, he thought silently for a few moments.<br />
<br />
Finally Will thought that it was time to continue, he had one day to enjoy being a girl and he was going to do as much as he could with it. For the added affect of dressing the body completely up, Will added some diamond earring studs of Eva’s he’d found in her normal jewelry box. Along with a necklace that had a heart hanging from it, it hung neatly between his cleavage. A smile crossed Will’s face, the jewelry didn’t do whomever this girl was, justice. “Alright, she’s got to have a camera around here…” Will looked around for a few minutes through various other drawers, he pulled out some sexy clothes he’d found along his search. He had to hold his breasts as he bent over, soon figuring out it was just easier to bend at the knees. Also finding some regular clothes he could wear when he was done with his fun. “Thank god, I thought the girl had a one track mind…”<br />
<br />
Placing what clothes he’d gathered onto the large mattress, Will dropped once more to his knees to look under the bed, he could feel the weight of his breasts swaying slightly. His face blushed slightly at the thought of seeing the girl in that position and with the realization that it was actually him, was kind of exciting to him. Looking under the bed, he felt around with his hands, coming upon something rubbery, it was long and hard and had a crease at the tip. Will’s eyes widened, he pulled the object out from its hiding place. It was exactly what his thoughts had imagined, he dropped it to the floor, his face contorting slightly. “Ew…gross…little vixen has her toys just sitting out.” Once more picking it up from the ground, this time with two fingers, holding it as far away from him as possible. Will placed it on the nightstand next to the bed, it was harder to judge the size of things now because of his dramatic decrease in mass. But the sex toy looked so large between his small fingers, he shrugged it off and continued looking under the bed, this time more cautious.<br />
<br />
 Finally he found a digital camera, it was a little older, but it was more than sufficient. He turned it on. “Yes, batteries still work.” It had a half charge left on it, the memory card had images on it, so Will decided to take a quick look. They were of Eva’s beautiful body, she looked a little younger than he’d remembered her. &quot;Wow, these must’ve been from a while back.&quot; He nodded, she looked around sixteen when they were taken. He figured he could just take the pictures, get them onto his computer and have it back before anyone knew it was gone. “Wow, I have to admit, Eva is one gorgeous girl. Debbie and her both have some good genes in them…holy shit.” <br />
<br />
There was one picture of Eva going down on some guy with a seemingly gigantic dong.  Will was mesmerized by the sight, he was both shocked and rather turned on by the sight. After realizing his sudden fascination, Will shook his head to clear his head, though he was enticed by the sight of Eva in such an act it was the cock that seemed to hold his gaze. Will dismissed it. Taking the time to set the camera up on the dresser, checking it to make sure it was at the perfect height and place to take pictures. “Alright, now…what would I like to see myself in first. I’m the luckiest guy in the world! Who else gets a chance to do whatever I want with this body and then go back to being me…this is great!” He thought excitedly. He’d completely forgotten to call Jake, in his mind he only had the one-day as a girl meaning he didn't want to waste time.<br />
<br />
 First, he took a couple pictures of him posing with his birthday suit on, he winked and cupped his ample cleavage as the self-timer would go off. Will even did one with his butt sticking out toward the camera as he looked over his right shoulder in a mockingly shocked look on his face as the flash went off. Next, he looked through the pile of clothes for something sexy to dress up in, Will found something that had peaked his interest. “This can’t really be called clothing…but hell it’s hot.” Will said aloud to himself as he stepped into the red boy shorts that hugged his lovely soft bottom as he pulled them up. Then slipping a white cut off cotton tank top shirt, it was cut in a way so that it only covered up the top half of his breasts and the very edge of his nipple could be seen. It also showed off his firm belly very nicely. <br />
<br />
He snapped a few photos of himself in the outfit in various poses, all sexy, the first of many that he would quickly change and go to the next one, each one having their own sexual flare. Will always liked it when Megan went out of her way to make herself up, she was so sexy and now Will could control his fantasy. Will managed to resist any kind of self pleasure, though with each sexy outfit he began to weaken in that area. Will dressed as a nurse, a secretary, and a farm girl. Each pose showed off how sexy Will's body was and had begun to feel more confident in his it’s form. Even noticing how many he's liked how some of the fabric felt on his delicate skin. “Some of these look like they're from Halloween…but there’s a lot, this girl must get around or she really likes to dress up.”<br />
<br />
Will had to admit he was kind of liking it himself, he just kept wanting to see what the next thing would look like on ‘her’. Will had found the French Maid’s outfit from earlier, this one was a tad more intricate than everything else was. First he put on a pair of black thong, shrugging off the feeling it gave him. Stepping into the dress, he pulled it up his body, slipping his arms through the white ruffled short sleeves that barely covered his shoulders. The outfit was black say for the lace-trimmed skirt that dropped above the middle of his thigh. There was a built in bra, which hugged and displayed his breasts perfectly. He pulled two stockings up his legs and felt a shudder, it was such a strange sensation, he knew what it'd been like to rip them from Megan’s legs, but to wear them, he'd never imagined it.<br />
<br />
Pointing his toes to check out the stockings as they moved, he smiled slightly. “Kinda sexy, this is the one outfit that could somewhat pass for real.” Will chuckled, he put the choker on around his neck along with the finishing touches, the apron with a pink bow in front, and the maid’s hat to finish it off. “But, something’s missing…” Will thought about it carefully as he studied the reflection, nodding finally, he looked around in Eva’s closet briefly before finding them. He slowly stepped into the black polished heels, he felt unsteady in them, grabbing onto the armor. Will walked around, trying to get used to at least standing in them, ultimately he decided to ditch them, he couldn’t get used to walking. “Maybe next time, heh.” <br />
<br />
Will set the camera up in a different spot and pretended to be cleaning as the flashes went off. Making sure he bent over to give a good view of his bare bottom, pretending to clean the nightstand. A few more sexy poses and he once more was naked, getting ready for the final one before taking a break. Will pulled up some jean shorts that could barely be called that, they’d been hacked up all the way up to the waist band and crotch line, providing a very nice denim thong look. Next putting on a fishnet shirt that hid absolutely nothing of his upper body. Setting up the camera once more, he took a few more photos, this time as he turn to give the camera another view of the back of his body, he looked out the large windows he’d been in front of pretty much the entire time.<br />
<br />
What Will saw made him blush furiously with embarrassment, there were two guys standing across the yard, staring directly at him. “Oh shit!” He just froze, he didn’t know how long they’d been there or who they even were, noticing they had pool gear, he realized they were there to fix it. The flashes had drawn their attention and as soon as they saw the reason they had a great show before them of a gorgeous girl running around in skimpy clothing, not to mention he was naked periodically as they watched. Will embarrassed as all hell, covered his exposed chest and got to the floor to avoid their leering. “Bastards, how long did those dicks stand there…course I couldn’t blame them.”<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh shit...what should I do now...&quot; Will said sitting on the floor, feeling the carpet on his exposed ass cheeks. He decided to...</p>
