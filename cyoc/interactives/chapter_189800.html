<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Suddenly a log comes speeding towards you from out of the leaves. You are slow to react due to sheer disbelief of the ridiculous attack and end up taking it in full to the stomach, sending you backwards a good 10 feet and onto your back. Thankfully though, there wasn&#39;t any follow up attack.<br />
<br />
You check your status and are shocked that this one attack dropped you down 550 HP even with all of your newly acquired resistances. If it were not for you gaining the extra few thousand health from the evolution of your class, you would be dead right now. <br />
<br />
The other issue though is that you now also are stunned for 5 seconds. You can look around with your 360 degree vision still though. So you can watch out for who or whatever threw that log. <br />
<br />
The leaves start shaking once again and you prepare to move the second you can. Then out from the leaves walks an enormous woman. She has to be at least 8 feet tall, and had the physique of a world class bodybuilder. And yet there is still a distinct femininity to her. This is definitely, and without a single shred of a doubt, an amazonis.<br />
<br />
She takes a few steps towards you, but seeing as how you are still not moving, she  incorrectly assumes you died and begins a gleeful celebration with a voice that does not match her body. It is way to girly and high pitched, and you know exactly why it is like that. <br />
<br />
&quot;Brenda? Is that you!&quot; You say, as you sit up. Brenda turns to you and lunges at you with a fist readied. However a split second before she connects with you, she redirects it to just miss your face and smashes the ground behind you. You actually tried to guard against her attack but as you were not prepared to suddenly begin fighting, yet again you were slow to react and nearly took another huge attack.<br />
<br />
You watch behind you as Brenda stands up and comes back over to where you are sitting. You shake your head and grin as you watch her as her personality and mannerisms do not match her body at all. She is way to bright, curious, and cheerful for the intimidating, strong, and tough appearance of an Amazonian warrior. When she gets to where you still are sitting down, she kneels down next to you and begins to look you over curiously. <br />
<br />
&quot;Um... what are you doing, Brenda?&quot; You ask, fully confused by her sudden weird investigation of your body. <br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s so weird! I can hear you, but its like the words are coming out from all of you. And... is that a bikini? Oh by the way, my name is Brenda and sorry for hitting you with a log earlier. I thought you were a monster, well I still kinda do. But you can talk, and have a cute voice, and you seem nice. Oh yeah, how do you know my name already?&quot; Asks Brenda. <br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s a bit of a story. But for starters, believe it or not, its me, Lucas.&quot; You continue to explain how you got turned into a woman, then had your class forcably evolved. And why you currently are coated in a permanent layer of slime.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow, that&#39;s so amazing! Hey, when I hit you with the log, how did it feel? Did your slime protect you or something? Because you are the first creature to survive that attack.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Please don&#39;t call me a creature... call me a woman if you must, but at least keep me human. And about that other thing... umm, well you see... the thing is.... all sense of physical feelings is directly translated by my core, and well, turned into pleasure.&quot; You admit embarrassingly. <br />
<br />
&quot;It translates into pleasure? Wait what core are you talking about? I wanna see it! Is it cool looking?&quot; Asks Brenda excitedly. You just want to change the topic to anything else, but you know full well that she never would let you. So you point to your crotch. <br />
<br />
&quot;The core is here.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, so like, it&#39;s in your ass then? That must be uncomfortable.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;No, its not in my ass. Its in... the other spot.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Other spot?... OhhhhOHH! That spot?! You put the core in your pussy? Why the hell did you shove it up there?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I didn&#39;t do it, it went their on its own. And now it is stuck inside it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Spread your legs ,I wanna see it.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;What? NO! No no no no no no. You are not looking into my pussy just to see the core.&quot; You say defiantly while closing your legs up tight. But compared to an amazonis&#39;s strength, you put up little resistance. Next thing you know, your legs are spread wide in a horizontal split that even you are shocked by how flexible you are now. Brenda is head down inbetween your legs trying to see into your pussy. And thanks to your slime keeping your pussy always gaping like it does with your mouth, she has a pretty clear window to see it from.<br />
<br />
&quot;Woah, it looks so cool! Its all shiny and pink. It looks really wet too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How can... mmm, you tell its... mhmmm, wet?&quot; You ask while doing your best to not moan. But it feels so good to have her holding your legs out like this that you have to keep your focus so that you do not moan. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, aren&#39;t you holding back moans right now? So obviously it would be wet, duh.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Wait what?!? Ulghhhh Brenda! You were supposed to have been looking at my core, not just my pussy!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;He he, whoops.&quot; Joked Brenda. She then went back down to look again, or so you thought until you see her stick out her tongue and give you a lick. This of course sends you over the edge and you instantly cum. She then tries to touch the inside, but your slime prevents her at least. But it still makes you come a second time though. <br />
<br />
You are helpless to free yourself from her as she continues to make you cum again and again and again as she tries out different things with you. Anything from kissing to a full blown punch, and all of it is turned straight into pleasure, and all of it makes you cum. <br />
<br />
When she finally satisfies her curiosity, you are exhausted from cumming so many times. &quot;Sorry, I got a bit carried away.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Haha, fuck you. I&#39;ve never cum so much all at once before&quot; you say. You are not mad at her so much as you are annoyed by how helpless you are against her curiosity, and how easily you are able to cum. And the only reason as to why you are not mad at her is because you were already planning on doing what she did to you anyways. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, at least we know that I am momentarily useless if I get hit by some big attack and end up cumming. I guess it is a way to balance my evolved class. I can tank a lot of hits, but I can&#39;t do much else while doing so.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That makes sense I guess.&quot; Brenda says as she helps you get up to your feet. &quot;You are a very pretty woman you know, so you should be extra careful when we meet unknown people. If they figure out that they can basically make you incapacitated from cumming by doing physical things to you, then they may try and capture you and keep you as their sex slave or something. But, I will protect you from them. So just stay near me okay.&quot; <br />
<br />
You have not thought about that risk before now, and immediately agree to her offer. It would be bad if things got out of hand like she described. You realize how fortunate it was that you met up with her and not some unknown people. &quot;Anyways, do you know where we need to go next, or are we just going to continue walking in a random direction and hope to find something?&quot;</p>
