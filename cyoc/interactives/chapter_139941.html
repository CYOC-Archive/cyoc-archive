<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It had been a quiet day at the Magic Shop for Merlin. Although a few customers had entered and made purchases he had found himself for the most part examining various timelines to pass the time. Merlin was interested in the timeline that involves Katie’s mother Kellie. Things seemed to be going quite well for his doppelgänger and her daughter, even though it only appeared that they were able reach only one of the usual “authors”.Merlin hoped that the other “author” didn’t have a block as he always enjoyed him.<br />
<br />
What was even more interesting was a current timeline that was playing out that involved a evil doppelgänger of himself who was in the process of transforming four women into talking animals. Merlin had to admit that the story was quite interesting and was looking forward to seeing how things played out. The sound of the shop door bursting open drew his attention away from his timeline viewing. Looking towards the woman and teen Merlin was surprised to say the least. “Lisa, Gloria?”<br />
<br />
Lisa and Gloria raced to the front desk, Lisa quickly outpacing a very pregnant Gloria. As the 14 year old now caught her breath she looked anxiously at the ancient wizard. “Hey Merlin,” she chirped. “We’re having a bit of an issue that we could use your help with.”<br />
<br />
Perplexed Merlin looked between the two. Age changing he was used to, that wasn’t new, but the fact that somehow Gloria had become a very pregnant adult was indeed intrigueing. “I would certainly say so,” she said. “Gloria, Lisa, please have a seat.” Waving his hands he quickly produced a pair of comfortable chairs for the two to sit in. Lisa sat down, bouncing with nervous energy while Gloria groaned, leaning back exhausted.<br />
<br />
“Ugh thanks Merlin,” Gloria sighed. “My feet are killing me and Lynne is pressing down on my bladder again, just glad I peed before we left the house.”<br />
<br />
“I see,” Merlin said quietly. “So your sister is now inside your womb. That’s a very interesting spell you’ve conjured Gloria, one with a very unique outcome.”<br />
<br />
“This wasn’t Gloria’s doing,” Lisa said. “Lynne somehow cast this spell. First Gloria became preganant with me, then we started getting older and younger, now Gloria and me are having our minds altered too. I’m forgetting what it’s like to be an adult while Gloria is gaining a whole bunch of experience. It totally sucks.”<br />
<br />
Merlin could only nod as she peered closely at the waifish young teen. Lisa was obviously younger having lost the curves of adulthood as well as a couple of inches from her last growth spurt. What puzzled him was how Lisa was losing her adult memories. Gloria’s knowledge could be explained as a natural part of her magical progression but the loss of experience for an adult was slightly alarming.<br />
<br />
“Merlin I tried useing my ring but Lynne won’t let me,” Gloria said. “I think she’s trying to have a closer relationship with us, she’s just going about it in an odd way.”<br />
<br />
“It would certainly seem that way,” Merlin stated. “However there is very little I can do. The unborn Magic is always quite chaotic in nature. If I try reversing it I could do some permanent damage to the both of you.”<br />
<br />
“I’m willing to chance it,” Lisa exclaimed. “Lynne is trying to turn me into her twin sister! In case you haven’t noticed that means I’m going to end up sharing a womb with her inside Gloria.” Lisa shivered again as she grew younger once more. The 14 year old was now a girl of 13. Lisa’s breasts shrank once more as she lost another inch or two, the cuffs of her blouse sliding over her wrist. As it completed the girl looked herself over in shock.<br />
<br />
“Dang it now I’m not even in high school,” she moaned. “I don’t want to have to repeat the 8th grade all over again.”<br />
<br />
Merlin rubbed his chin as the teen let her head hang dejectedly. He was intrigued by what was happening yet he had no desire to draw this out, especially seeing how distressed Lisa was. As he watched he noticed Gloria place an arm around Lisa’s shoulder squeezing her tightly.<br />
<br />
“Sweety  it will be okay,” she soothed. “No it won’t Mom, I mean Gloria,” Lisa cried. “The last memories I had of high school just vanished. I know it’s the magic but now all I can remember is being in eighth grade. I don’t want to be in eighth grade again.”<br />
<br />
Merlin was shocked at Lisa’s physical and emotional regression. The confident woman he had grown to know was now just a young teen, complete with teenage emotions. Lisa was rapidly losing her adulthood and becoming the child she appeared to be. “I believe I have an idea,” he said.<br />
<br />
Lisa and Gloria looked anxiously at the ancient wizard as he stroked his beard carefully. “Lisa, Gloria,” he stated. “If I interfere in Lynne’s magic I may permanently trap you two as you are. My suggestion is that you two need to talk with Lynne about ending the spell.”<br />
<br />
“We tried that Merlin,” Gloria sighed. “It only seems to speed things up.”<br />
<br />
“I’m not talking about that Lynne,” Merlin smirked. “I’m talking about the other Lynne, the one you know.”<br />
<br />
Lisa and Gloria gave Merlin a curious look as they let his words float around in their minds. “Merlin are you saying what I think your saying,” Gloria asked. Merlin nodded as he now stood dramatically.<br />
<br />
“Yes,” he exclaimed. “We are going to send Lisa BACK....to the future!”<br />
<br />
“You Seriously didn’t just quote the movie did you Merlin,” Lisa groaned.<br />
<br />
“Well it’s not like I can use that line very often,” he shrugged. Lisa sighed in exasperation. “Fine,” she sighed in typical teenage fashion. “It’s either that or I’m reliving junior high AGAIN!”<br />
<br />
“Why can’t I go,” Gloria asked. “I don’t think I’m very comfortable with my 13 year old daughter traveling into the future by herself.” Lisa shot Gloria an annoyed look, causing the woman to blush crimson. “Sorry,” she said meekly.<br />
<br />
“It’s best you stay here,” Merlin said. “Time travel may not agree with you in your current state Gloria. That and their is the possibility that your presence with Lynne could very well alter the future Lynne.” Gloria sighed as she sadly looked at the 13 year old Lisa. The Magic was affecting her in a way that made her want to protect the girl til her dying breath. As she collected her thoughts she realized Lisa was a grown woman, yes she may have lost some experience, yes she was merely a child now but Lisa was resilient. If anyone could do this, she could.<br />
<br />
“Okay let’s do it,” she said quietly. “ it please Lisa, just be careful.”<br />
<br />
“Don’t worry mom, um Gloria,” Lisa said confidently. “I got this and hey who knows could be fun.”<br />
<br />
“Excellent,” Merlin smiled. “It should only take a moment to cast the spell and as a bonus you shouldn’t grow any younger while your in the future. Just find Lynne, but be careful Lisa. Things may change their with your presence, especially in your current state.”<br />
<br />
Merlin now went about casting the spell that would send Lisa to Lynne’s time. As a portal slowly began to grow around  the teen she smiled at Gloria and Merlin, trying to ease their fears. Now hopefully she could find Lynne and reverse the spell, especially considering she was now her daughters little sister.</p>
