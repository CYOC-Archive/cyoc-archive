<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The next class on Teddy and Jack&#39;s list was P.E. Both of them were fairly athletic,  they were both on the Track Team. For the most part, they didn&#39;t foresee any trouble depending on what they would be doing today.<br />
<br />
They arrived at the gym and headed off into the locker room to get changed. As they started to undress, they once again couldn&#39;t help but notice the two sides to their body. Teddy ran his hand down the front of their body with a bit of a smirk. &quot;You know Jack, I don&#39;t think I&#39;d ever get used to this if we were really stuck.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know what you mean.&quot; Jack had to look down as they took of their pants. &quot;We line up fine, we just don&#39;t look the same.&quot; They worked together and put on their gym clothes which were Jack&#39;s original. Everyone around them had finished and they all headed back out to the gym. Teddy and Jack stood in line with the rest of the guys, beside Noah, who they hadn&#39;t noticed in the locker room. Jack looked at him with a smile, &quot;Hey, where&#39;s your other half?&quot;<br />
<br />
 Noah chuckled and shook his head, &quot;That jerk? He had to go off to English, so we parted ways.&quot; The three of them laughed as the teacher walked in. He explained that today was just going to be a fit test day, and that they&#39;d be going for a little run to warm up. The whole room groaned, so he added on ten push-ups when they&#39;d get back.<br />
<br />
Teddy, Jack and Noah walked outside with everyone else and waited for the signal to start. Teddy turned so he could see Noah, &quot;I bet we can beat you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Bull shit!&quot; Noah spat, &quot;You guys are fast, but I&#39;m faster!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, I don&#39;t think so Noah.&quot; Jack teased, &quot;Everyone knows I&#39;m the fastest.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Um, excuse me?&quot; Teddy brought his hand up and smacked themselves on their chest, &quot;Wrong! I&#39;m the fastest.&quot; Jack looked at Teddy like he was an idiot and shook his head. &quot; Afraid so, I&#39;m way faster than you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh you think so?&quot; Teddy nodded at Jack&#39;s sarcastic question. &quot;All right... last one at the finish line has to do all the homework.&quot; Teddy&#39;s eyes narrowed as he brought a fist up, and Jack bumped it with his own.<br />
<br />
The bet was set, and  just Noah stared at them, &quot;Um, isn&#39;t it sort of impossible for one of you to beat the other?&quot; Jack and Teddy waved him off, and a moment later their race started.<br />
<br />
The pair were running as fast as they could. They had easily taken lead over everyone else, and the person behind them was Noah, who was still a good fifteen feet away. Their chest was heaving from the heavy breathing, and their heads would bump together, making their cheeks rub. They rounded the final corner and made a mad sprint for the finish. As they got closer, Jack tried to twist them so his side would finish first, but Teddy was trying to do the same. It was causing them to weave back and forth as they ran. They ran across the finish line and came to a quick stop. They were bent over, hands on knees, and their cheeks glued together with sweat.<br />
<br />
They were heaving and Jack could barely speak, &quot;Fuck... I think... it was... a tie.&quot; His head moved up and down with Teddy&#39;s as he nodded.<br />
<br />
They stood up tall, and Teddy took a deep breathe, &quot;See who can do the most push-ups?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jack gave a short laugh and patted them on the chest, &quot;You&#39;re on!&quot; They went inside and took a spot of the hard floor and started to do their push-ups. They were at about twenty when Noah came in to do his. He asked them who had won, but they didn&#39;t answer back, lost in their competition. They had done another ten when the rest of the class showed up. Jack and Teddy had been counting out-loud, and could hear some of the other boys.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s not even close to fair, they&#39;re like two people in one, it&#39;s crap.&quot;<br />
&quot;Ya! How are us normal people suppose to beat someone who has twice the stamina and shit.&quot;<br />
&quot;Exactly! Just because they&#39;re two-headed freaks, doesn&#39;t mean they should be setting OUR bar?&quot;<br />
<br />
Teddy could feel the heat building inside Jack, and quickly got them off the floor and back into the locker room. He closed the door behind them and took a seat on the bench, &quot;Jack...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck them!&quot; Jack stood up and kicked someones bag across the ground.<br />
<br />
The door opened and Noah walked in. He had seen them angry before, and judging from what they had said about last night, knew that things could get bad. &quot;Hey, guys. Don&#39;t listen to that crap, ok?&quot; Noah walked over and put his hand on Teddy&#39;s shoulder, &quot;Their just jealous.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of being a freak?!&quot; Jack snapped at pulled them away. &quot;You heard what they said!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s not what I meant and you know it Jack!&quot; Noah grabbed them both by the shoulders but was speaking to Jack. &quot;You guys, BOTH of you, are better people then they are.&quot; Teddy could feel Jack calming down, and mouthed the words &#39;thank you&#39; to Noah. He smiled and gave them a hug. &quot;Now come one, let&#39;s go out their an kick their asses at everything!&quot; The three of them returned to their testing, and managed to beat everyone else in the different categories. Noah would come in second, and much to Teddy and Jack&#39;s frustrated enjoyment, the pair always tied for first with smiles on their faces.</p>
