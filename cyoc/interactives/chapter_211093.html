<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Luna headed for the bathroom, followed by Selena. She reluctantly took out her bottle of shaving cream and began to lather up her regrown body hair. &quot;Ugh, sucks that I have to shave these beauties off immediately after regrowing them,&quot; Luna groaned. &quot;But yeah, we can&#39;t risk Mom finding out that you helped me. May Mother Night and Lady Moon strike me down if this isn&#39;t the last time I shave in my life!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom really shouldn&#39;t know that we&#39;re in cahoots now,&quot; Selena nodded. &quot;And then there&#39;s the fact that you used witch magic.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t think <i>that</i> part would bother Mom too much,&quot; Luna shrugged. &quot;She actually visited Morgana herself just today.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What for?&quot; Selena asked, raising a red eyebrow. &quot;She&#39;s always bragging about how self-sufficient our pack is.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She bought some kind of salve or ointment that turns humans into werewolves when they rub it into their armpits and crotches,&quot; Luna answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s good,&quot; Selena sighed in relief. &quot;If we can find new packmates with magic, then maybe Mom won&#39;t mind how lesbian our pack is getting as much.&quot;<br />
<br />
Luna&#39;s expression grew dark. &quot;Yeah, that&#39;s true, but that isn&#39;t the only reason she wants Di and me to recruit new pack members. Like you were saying, she&#39;s getting really paranoid lately... more than usual, I mean. There&#39;s her obvious obsession with booting the von Karnstein vampires out of Stokerville, but there&#39;s also that damn werefox skulk that set up camp on the edge of town a few days ago. Oh, and a trespassing werehyena pack recently came to her attention.&quot;<br />
<br />
Selena&#39;s eyes went wide with horror. &quot;She knows about that?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Luna said as she ran the razor over her lathered legs, thick clumps of red leg hair clogging the blade. &quot;She wants to find out who they are so she can force them to turn themselves into humans. I think she asked Morgana to sell her something that could do that, but she hasn&#39;t gotten it yet.&quot;<br />
<br />
That was it; now or never. &quot;Luna...&quot; Selena began. &quot;There&#39;s something you have a right to know if you&#39;re protecting me. I... I&#39;m the alpha of that werehyena pack.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;WHAT?!!&quot; Luna screamed as she dropped her razor in shock.<br />
<br />
Selena put a finger to her lips. &quot;Shh! Not so loud; Mom&#39;ll hear you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry,&quot; Luna said in a quieter voice. &quot;But how the hell did a useless wolfborn human like you become a werehyena, and an alpha, no less?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Morgana,&quot; Selena said. &quot;How else? I was sick and tired of putting up with Di&#39;s juvenile teasing, your contempt, and Mom&#39;s borderline hatred. I was scared of being exiled from the pack when I turned 18. You know how much Mom likes to threaten me with that. Well, my girlfriend Tatiana... don&#39;t you dare roll your eyes at me!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ugh, fine,&quot; Luna grumbled. &quot;Well, what did your little undead girlfriend do?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And don&#39;t talk about her like Mom,&quot; Selena added sternly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, at least I&#39;m not calling her a fang or a leech to your face like Mom does,&quot; Luna retorted. &quot;I&#39;m honestly trying to be civil here. It&#39;s not easy, but I&#39;m trying. Well, what did you and Tatiana do about your crappy life?&quot;<br />
<br />
Selena decided to overlook the insult, largely because her life <i>had</i> been pretty crappy back then. &quot;Tats took me to Morgana Faye&#39;s shop, swearing that Morgana would have something to kickstart my first shift. Morgana determined that I was a wolfborn human and had a recessive gene, but she had something that could turn me into a first-generation werebeast. It was an enchanted brush that could transform me if I brushed an animal and then myself on the night of the full moon. It&#39;s called the Werebrush. I was going to brush a wolf, but then I thought about starting my own pack. With that goal in mind, I could be anything I wanted. I settled on a hyena from the zoo, partially because Tats figured we&#39;d never need a strap-on again.&quot;<br />
<br />
Luna raised a hand to interrupt. &quot;Wait. You said that this Werebrush of yours only works on the night of the full moon. There&#39;s no way this werehyena pack&#39;s been around for more than a month. Are you telling me that you built up an entire pack in a single night?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course not,&quot; Selena said. &quot;When I wanted to recruit some packmates, I asked Morgana if she had anything that could help me. She found a magic cock ring called the Ring of Embraces. If I wore it on my werehyena form&#39;s dick, anyone I cummed inside would be turned into another werehyena. I&#39;ve been building up my pack ever since.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sounds like you might be a cooler person than I thought, Selena,&quot; Luna said as she lifted an arm to remove her freshly grown armpit hair. &quot;So, where do you intend to live? There&#39;s no way Mom would let your pack live here on our homestead, and an alpha can&#39;t really live apart from her pack.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Carmilla von Karnstein plans to help me pick out a spot in the wilderness to build my own homestead once I graduate from high school next year and my pack&#39;s grown large enough. I&#39;m pen pals with the alpha of a werehyena pack from Oklahoma, and shi sent me some blueprints for a self-sufficient, off-the-grid homestead.&quot;<br />
<br />
Luna nodded approvingly as she shaved off the last of her armpit hair. &quot;Smart. I&#39;ll try to slack off a bit while recruiting for my own pack. Hell, maybe I&#39;ll send a few recruits <i>your</i> way. Incidentally, I should really know who&#39;s in your pack if I&#39;m gonna be protecting it from Mom. I need to know who&#39;s gonna be on her radar.&quot;<br />
<br />
Selena, knowing that Luna was right, decided to risk everything and trust her. &quot;Okay, I&#39;ll tell you. But I want you to know that you&#39;re fucking dead meat if you rat us out to Mom!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d fucking deserve it if I broke a solemn vow to Mother Night and Lady Moon,&quot; Luna nodded as she shaved her hairy forearms. &quot;I&#39;m a bitch, not a traitor.&quot;<br />
<br />
Selena nodded. &quot;Good. Well, my first recruit was my friend Beck Hamilton. They joined because they&#39;re non-binary, and becoming a werehyena was the only way they could get the penis they wanted. After that, we recruited their girlfriend Brianna Dixon. Only natural, right? Just after we finished turning Bri, Tatiana&#39;s clan-sister Liesel sent me a little present: a Wiccan girl she found in the woods who was interested in becoming a werehyena. Her name&#39;s Taylor Wagner, and she&#39;s my pack&#39;s shaman now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Taylor Wagner?&quot; Luna repeated as she reluctantly sheared off her treasure trail with the razor. &quot;I used to babysit her when I was twelve.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good, then you have some incentive to not sell us out,&quot; Selena said. &quot;Sorry, that came out harsher than I meant it to. After welcoming Taylor into the pack, Beck told me that Stella Bentley of all people might be interested. I take it you remember that name?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How could I not?&quot; Stella laughed. &quot;Ever since she started high school, Diana hasn&#39;t been able to shut the fuck up about how much she <i>hates</i> that girl. Her dad&#39;s the retail chain tycoon, right? All my sorority sisters shop at Bentley&#39;s.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s right,&quot; Selena nodded. &quot;Only Stella isn&#39;t a girl, not really. Shi&#39;s non-binary like Beck, and she answers exclusively to shi/hir pronouns. Shi was in the closet before we recruited hir, and Beck was the only person shi&#39;d told. We agreed to recruit hir, and we changed hir best friends Ashlee Kline and Zoey Guthrie at the same time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Isn&#39;t Ashlee that blonde airhead who succeeded me as captain of the cheer squad?&quot; asked Luna. &quot;By Lady Moon, that girl may be good at gymnastics, but she is DIM! I hope you gave her a job in the pack that plays to her strengths.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I made her Queen of the Dance,&quot; Selena answered. &quot;Ashlee may not be a brain, but she&#39;s got what it takes to lead my pack&#39;s sacred dancers. Oh, I should probably tell you that Stella transitioned after I turned hir and hir friends. Shi goes by the name &#39;Skyler Bentley&#39; now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Noted,&quot; Stella said as she trimmed her massive curly red bush short with a pair of scissors in preparation for the dreaded shaving.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then I decided to recruit this new girl at my school, Harper Browning. She&#39;s in the furry fandom, so I figured life as a werehyena would be paradise for her. While I was at it, I turned her girlfriend, Ellie Rubenstein. Unfortunately, werehyena metabolism kicked in and turned poor Ellie from soft and chubby to lean and toned.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And that&#39;s a <i>bad</i> thing?&quot; Luna asked incredulously as she shaved off the stubble of her bush. &quot;I&#39;d hate being fat almost as much as I hated being hairless!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not Ellie,&quot; said Selena. &quot;She loved her soft, doughy body just the way it was... and I kinda mutilated it. We went to Morgana for help, and she suggested that Ellie go to Japan and join a sumo heya run by a kappa who has a recipe for a magical chankonabe that can overrule our heightened metabolisms. She&#39;s leaving tomorrow morning. Beck actually decided to go with her after realizing that they had a latent fat fetish. Bri and Harper are going, too. Not to gain weight, mind you; they just wanna support their mates. Oh, and a werevixen named Kristi and her girlfriend Joelle are going with them. Long story.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I still can&#39;t wrap my head around wanting your jiggly-ass belly back once you get lucky enough to lose it,&quot; Luna shrugged as she carefully shaved off the halos of twisting hair that ringed her nipples. &quot;Wouldn&#39;t Ellie, Beck, and Kristi rather be hot?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Everybody has a different idea of what &#39;hot&#39; means, Luna,&quot; Selena said. &quot;After all that chaos died down, I focused on recruiting the girls&#39; basketball team: Abbie Peterson, Layla Kowalski, Naomi Miller, Kadie Brennan, Chloe Stewart, Hailey Wallerstedt, Cassidy Werner, Sofia Rivera-Lopez, Riley O&#39;Connell, Jazmyn Washington, Maddison Kaufman, and Katelynn Andersen. That all took two sessions. Summer Vogel from the cheer squad dropped by the first session to get turned alongside her girlfriend Riley, and Hannah Dershowitz, Jenna McSweeney, and Lily Nichols dropped in on the second session for some fur of their own. I think that&#39;s everybody, not counting Bailey.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Who?&quot; Luna asked as she shaved off her sideburns and the faint dusting of fine hairs on her chin and upper lip.<br />
<br />
&quot;You see, Ashlee and Zoey are mates,&quot; Selena explained. &quot;Ashlee got Zoey pregnant, and Bailey&#39;s what they&#39;re naming the cub once shi&#39;s born. I know it sounds crazy, but Zoey&#39;s got super-permissive parents and a ton of money from her budding career as a social media influencer.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okaaaaaaay...&quot; Luna said bemusedly as she ran the razor over her lathered-up ass and lower back. &quot;Not a bad start to a pack. Who knows about them besides me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Morgana Faye and her daughter, for starters,&quot; said Selena. &quot;Also Taylor&#39;s Wiccan friends Dani Romero-Marquez and Alyssa Bennett. Dani&#39;s apprenticed to Morgana as a proper witch now, and Alyssa joined Clan von Karnstein and changed her name to Jinx von Karnstein. On that note, Clan von Karnstein knows all about us. They&#39;re sort of our patrons and protectors while we&#39;re establishing ourselves. Taylor also told me a girl who wants to start up a werefox skulk found out when she tried to recruit her.&quot;<br />
<br />
Luna rolled her eyes. &quot;Just what the world needs... another fucking werefox skulk to rob, seduce, and harass us.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Taylor says this girl&#39;s on the inhibitor potion,&quot; Selena promised. &quot;Apparently she wants to ally her young skulk with my pack. I guess I&#39;m open to it if she&#39;s telling the truth. Also, we&#39;ve told the cheer squad since we&#39;re changing them tomorrow. They&#39;ll be the pack&#39;s sacred dancers. Oh, and... and I might&#39;ve also told... Diana...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?!&quot; Luna snapped. &quot;You told Di first?! You trusted that cocky, wisecracking, irresponsible jock bitch more than <i>me</i>?!&quot; She punctuated her words with shakes of a razor stuffed with massive bunches of red hair.<br />
<br />
&quot;What did you expect?&quot; Selena said dryly. &quot;You&#39;ve been nothing but an imperious, sadistic bully and Mom&#39;s loyal minion for as long as I can remember. Di hasn&#39;t. She hasn&#39;t been perfect, but I think she&#39;s always sorta liked me. <i>You</i> gave me the impression you hated me... assuming you considered me <i>worth</i> hating.&quot;<br />
<br />
Luna slumped her shoulders in defeat. &quot;Yeah, I guess that&#39;s fair. Sorry about being such a monster.&quot; She stared glumly at the used razor, its blade crammed with tangles of the body hair she&#39;d only just gotten back. Her eyes then sadly moved to her smooth, hairless skin, now bereft of its hairy plumage once again. &quot;I guess I&#39;m done shaving. Back to square one.&quot; She grimaced. &quot;Shit. Now I just have to grow it all back the old fashioned way. That way, nobody has to know I lasered it off like an idiot in the first place; it&#39;ll just look like I got tired of shave and let it all grow back. Can&#39;t wait till it gets long enough to be noticeable. Mom&#39;ll probably be happy to see I&#39;m finally wearing my body hair proudly like a proper werewolf.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I bet Lucy will, too,&quot; Selena smiled. &quot;It looked gorgeous on you. Never think you have to shave to be beautiful. That&#39;s a human delusion, and not even all humans share it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks, little sis,&quot; Luna smiled. The lovely werewolf raised an eyebrow. &quot;So, are we... friends now?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If you... want us to be,&quot; Selena said warily. &quot;I&#39;d certainly prefer it if we could be friends.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I... I think I&#39;d prefer that, too,&quot; Luna said, her voice cracking with embarrassment. &quot;I&#39;ve focused so hard on being a future alpha, I forgot to be a sister. Let&#39;s... let&#39;s change that going forward, okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
Selena happily shook Luna&#39;s hand. &quot;Deal!&quot;</p>
