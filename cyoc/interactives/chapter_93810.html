<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Well there were certainly a lot of doors to choose from in this hall. So many that you started to wonder just how big this house was. It didn&#39;t look all that big from outside but then you hadn&#39;t seen much of it. You&#39;ve been exploring for some time now and you haven&#39;t seen anyone. The only thing that had given you any reason to believe someone was here was the sound of a door opening when you were staring at that painting. Sighing you look down the hall wondering which door to try when you notice one that&#39;s slightly ajar. You decide to see what&#39;s in that room as it might have been left like that on purpose.<br />
<br />
As you open the door you notice that it barely makes a sound so this wasn&#39;t the door you hear opening. Once the door was open you step inside and find yourself in what was clearly a little girl&#39;s bedroom. You know you should leave immediately since anyone seeing a forty year old man in a little girl&#39;s bedroom would jump to the conclusion you were a sick pervert but your curiosity got the better of you. This bedroom might be able to tell you a little something about who lived here. With that in mind you looked around the room. It had soft pink carpeting and soft white walls. There was a canopy bed with sheer pink curtains with gold stars on them, the bedding was the same. There was a white dresser with pink rose knobs on the drawers and a sliding white door which had to be a closet. A dollhouse sat in one corner of the room. A white and pink toy chest, the kind that also had a cushion on top so you could sit on it, was at the foot of the bed. On one wall there was a couple of windows with light pink curtains tied back with pink bows.<br />
<br />
You were a little surprised to see that night had fallen through the windows but you figured you shouldn&#39;t be. You had been wondering around for quite awhile and it looks like you had lost track of time. Shrugging you went over to the closet and looked inside. There were a bunch of dresses hanging up in it, most of them pretty casual with the remainder being more suited to parties and other events. You guessed that the dresses would fit like a six year old girl. At the bottom of the closet there were a few shoes, sandals, and flip flops. You closed the closet and went over to the dresser pulling out the drawers and looking at the contents. There were a variety of little girl&#39;s panties, shirts with various sleeve lengths, some shorts, some pants, lots of socks, tights, one and two piece swimsuits, and pajamas and nightgowns. There was a box in the top drawer which turned out to contain some jewelry and hair accessories.<br />
<br />
Closing the last drawer you think about the clothes you had just seen. None of the clothes looked cheap so it was probably a good bet that whoever lived here had quite a bit of money. Of course it should have been obvious from the maze garden outside. The clothes looked new so they weren&#39;t hand me downs which means there&#39;s no way to tell if there are older girls here. Having satisfied your curiosity you turn to leave when you notice that the door is closed. You know you had left it open when you had come in so you wondered how it closed without you hearing it. A feeling of dread came over you and you quickly hurried to the door to open it only to find out that you couldn&#39;t open it. You backed up and sat on the bed thinking that whoever lived in this house had caught you but instead of confronting you they locked you in and then went to call the police. There was no doubt that you were in some major trouble now. Maybe you could get out through one of the windows though before you could get up off the bed exhaustion swept over you. You had been tired before you came into this house and now you couldn&#39;t keep your eyes open. Without really meaning to you laid down on the bed and drifted off to sleep. As you were drifting off though you thought you heard someone say, &quot;The others will be so happy to have another housemate.&quot;<br />
<br />
As you slept something strange happened. Your clothes just disappeared off of your body leaving you naked. If you had been awake you probably would have thought that you were in even bigger trouble than before. As it was you slept on as your body underwent some changes. At first nothing really seemed to happen except for a few fine lines disappearing. Then your body started to firm up and lose the fat it had accumulated looking like it had when you had been in your late teens. From there your body slowly began to shrink as your body hair also shrank like you were going through puberty backwards. Then the shrinking sped up and your pubic hair was the next to disappear. Your balls pulled in a bit tighter to your body as you reached 3&#39;9 1/2&quot;, the height you were when you were six and you even look like you did at six. The changes didn&#39;t stop there though as your penis and balls continued to shrink until they would look normal on a newborn but not on a six year old, then they pulled into your body leaving you with a smooth groin. Your body then shrunk half an inch so you&#39;re now 3&#39;9&quot; as your hair grew out to armpit length and changed to a sandy blond color. Your nose became a little smaller as your face rounded a little more and your ears became pierced. Finally your transformation finished with a baby vagina forming between your legs and growing until it was a normal size for a six year old girl, for that is what you are now. With your transformation done a pair of panties and a light nightgown appeared on you. Then the covers on the bed raised up through your body and then settled over you.<br />
<br />
When you woke up you noticed that sunlight was streaming through the windows and you were surprised that you were allowed to sleep in the girl&#39;s room. Another surprise came as you realized that someone had pulled the covers over you last night like you really were a little girl. As you moved to get out of the bed you felt strange things on your body. You pulled the covers off of yourself and see the nightgown that had appeared on you last night. As you did that some hair fell into your view and you wondered if anything else had changed. Standing up you noticed that you were shorter now and you took a moment to think about what that meant. After a bit you lifted the hem of the nightgown up and saw that you were wearing panties now, also noticing the lack of a bulge in the front of them. Reaching a hand into the panties you discovered a flat space where a penis and balls should be. Going a little lower you found what you were kind of expecting, a girl&#39;s vagina. You pulled your hand out dropping the hem of the nightgown then you let out a little breath before quietly saying, &quot;Well I guess that explains why I&#39;m not in jail right now.&quot; You figured that the room had turned you into a little girl last night as you slept though you were surprised by how calm you were. Maybe you wouldn&#39;t be so calm a little latter when you had fully woken up but right now that&#39;s how you felt about it.<br />
<br />
There was a bit of pressure on your bladder and you realized that you needed to pee really bad. Since there was no other door you went over to the one leading out into the hall and hoped it would open. This morning you were able to turn the handle and open the door much to your relief. You began to wonder where the bathroom would be and how long it would take to find it. Well you might as well start with the one directly across from the bedroom. You quickly crossed the hall and opened the door. To your relief and surprise you found that it was a bathroom. You heard a door open somewhere, possibly upstairs, but you couldn&#39;t worry about that now. You slipped into the bathroom closing and locking the door behind you. You barely took in the bathroom as you went over to the toilet and lifted the lid. You knew you had to sit to pee so you pulled up the nightgown again and dropped your panties before turning around and sitting down. You seem to have made it just in time since as soon as you sat down you started to pee. It felt different having the pee come out a bit deeper into your body and it passing over your vaginal lips. As you sat there you noticed that the bathroom had a tropical decor with the walls painted a light blue with a few palm trees painted on one wall and the floor was a light tan tile that had a pattern resembling sand. The toilet, tub, and sink were also a light tan. You finished peeing feeling the relief of an empty bladder and automatically took some toilet paper to pat you vagina to get the little bit of pee that would have gotten trapped there.<br />
<br />
After you flushed and washed your hands you exits the bathroom wondering what to do. You could go back into the bedroom and change into some clothes or perhaps try to find another bedroom where you could transform back into yourself. Maybe you could go see where the sound of the door opening came from. Of course one of the logical things you should do is find the kitchen and get something to eat and drink since the last time you ate or drank anything was before you entered the park.</p>
