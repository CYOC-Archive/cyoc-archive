<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Just then there was a loud knock at the door.  Dan heard Sarah&#39;s voice, &quot;I&#39;ll get it, you guys stay here and finish your coffee.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dan saw Sarah rush past him through the dining room, open the door and accept a box from a delivery man.  She closed the door, set the box on the table, in Dan&#39;s view, and opened it.  Dan felt a slight tickle in his side, as Sarah reached into the box.  He was confused.  He watched as Sarah pulled four seat cushions out of the box, set them on the four dining chairs, and tie them in place.  They appeared to be topped with a soft looking suede leather.  Dan felt more tickles now in both his sides, as Sarah did this.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, everybody,&quot; Sarah said loudly, &quot;Bring your coffee and come out here, I have a surprise!&quot;  Kat, Jack and Steve came out to the dining room and Sarah said, &quot;Check this out, guys!  I never told anybody what I did with my buck&#39;s hide, but I sent it off and had it made into four seat cushions!  These are supposed to be super comfortable, cushy and supportive.  And they&#39;re a nice soft suede deerskin leather.&quot;  Everyone went and looked at their seat.  &quot;No more sore butts, haha!&quot; said Sarah, &quot;We&#39;ll be so much more comfortable now than when we were sitting directly on the wood chairs for long meals and visits.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow, they&#39;re beautiful,&quot; said Kat.  Even she didn&#39;t know this was coming.  &quot;Nice,&quot; said Jack.  &quot;Looks good,&quot; said Steve.  &quot;Well, whose gonna try it first?&quot; Sarah asked.  &quot;I will!&quot; said Kat.  As she sat down, Dan felt a super heavy weight pushing into the full front-right quadrant of his skin.  &quot;Oh,&quot; thought Dan, &quot;feeling...&quot;  He felt a stretching and pulling along with the pressing as Kat adjusted herself on her seat and said &quot;Oh Sarah, this is wonderful.  So comfy!&quot;  Then Jack sat down next to Kat.  As he did, Dan had a similar feeling, but this time all over the full front-left quadrant of his skin.  Steve sat on his chair, and Dan felt an enormous pressing all over his right-rear quadrant of skin, which was relieved for half a second as Steve lifted himself up, then returned in a major way as he plopped back down and settled in to his seat.  &quot;Well, what do my guys think?&quot; asked Sarah.  &quot;Good,&quot; said Jack.  &quot;Much better,&quot; said Steve.  Dan would have cried if he was able, but nobody knew, not even Kat.  The mistaken spell was truly an accident.<br />
<br />
As Sarah topped off everyone&#39;s coffee cups, she said &quot;You know, why don&#39;t we all go out to breakfast today?!&quot;  Everyone smiled and nodded in agreement as they sipped their coffee.<br />
<br />
Sarah placed the jar of jerky on the table, in case anyone wanted a piece, then sat down on her seat.  This time Dan felt a heavy weight pressing all over his rear-left quadrant of skin.  Sarah kind of twisted and adjusted herself on her cushion, and Dan felt a similar feeling to when Kat did this.  He felt a slight relief as she briefly lifted herself up, and it returned as she sank into her cushion.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, that is so nice,&quot; said Sarah.  My buttocks are pleased!&quot;  Everyone giggled as they adjusted and settled further in to their seats.  Dan felt all of it.  As everyone settled in and relaxed, he felt like he had an overwhelming force pressing across the entirety of his skin.  The force, the stretching and the pulling, however, he only felt on his skin.  He didn&#39;t feel it any further into his body, as the cushions were backed with fabric and filled with a special foam.<br />
<br />
&quot;So,&quot; said Sarah, &quot;breakfast out today,&quot; But first, let&#39;s relax and enjoy another cup of coffee, shall we?&quot; Dan just kind of watched and observed, feeling his entire skin being tortured more and more and increasing in soreness the longer they sat.  But they sure looked comfortable and happy.  And he knew they had no idea about his new dilemma, so he tried his very best to be happy for them.  It hurt though.<br />
<br />
Dan saw Kat reach over and pull a strip of jerky out of the jar on the table.  Dan thought he felt a little tickle deep inside his right thigh, but he wasn&#39;t sure... until she took a bite.  As Kat took a bite off the end of her jerky strip, Dan felt an excruciatingly sharp pain deep in his right-rear thigh.  It subsided as he watched her slowly chew and swallow.  &quot;By the way, Steve,&quot; asked Kat, &quot;where did you have this jerky made?  It&#39;s amazing!&quot;  Steve answered, &quot;Oh, you like that, huh?  Yeah, it&#39;s pretty good.  While the head of the deer was at the taxidermist, I took a good chunk of it&#39;s right-rear thigh over to that little meat market in town, had them make it for us.  &quot;I see,&quot; said Kat.  &quot;Well, they did a great job.  Super tasty.  Just tickles my taste buds!&quot;<br />
<br />
Kat took another bite, and Dan felt the same crazy sharp pain, but about an inch up from the last.  Once again, it subsided as she chewed.  As Kat took more bites and ultimately finished off her piece of jerky, Dan realized that the pain that came with each bite was following the path of the meat strip location from where that particular piece of jerky came from.  He immediately started to dread what he would be feeling whenever a new meal was cooked from his meat in the freezer.<br />
<br />
Dan dealt with the full skin torture for another hour as everyone visited and enjoyed their second cup of coffee.  &quot;Steve,&quot; said Sarah, &quot;What do you think of the lights?  Don&#39;t they make my buck look cute?&quot;  &quot;Yes, you&#39;re a good decorator, hun,&quot; Steve answered.  &quot;Aww, thanks Babe,&quot; Sarah said.  &quot;And good idea with the seats, that was nice,&quot; Steve said.  Sarah smiled.  &quot;Crazy comfy!&quot; said Kat, as she bounced a little on hers.  &quot;Yeah, good job Mom,&quot; said Jack.<br />
<br />
And with that, everyone got up and pushed in their chairs. Dan felt immediate relief.  &quot;Well, thanks for the seat, and thanks for the treat, my &#39;deer&#39; friend,&quot; said Kat as she smiled at Dan, &quot;Those lights just make you look so happy!&quot;  &quot;Yeah, and thanks for the meat, buddy,&quot; said Jake.  &quot;Haha,&quot; Sarah laughed, &quot;And thanks for stopping by to see me on opening day, my cute little Christmas deer head.&quot;  &quot;Good stuff,&quot; said Steve, &quot;by the way Sarah, I&#39;ll grill up some venison burgers tonight for dinner.   Sound good?  I set some meat out to thaw already.&quot;  Sarah answered, &quot;Sounds great, thanks babe!&quot;  &quot;Sounds awesome,&quot; said Jack.  &quot;Oh my mouth is watering already!&quot; said Kat, as everyone walked right past Dan and out of the room.</p>
