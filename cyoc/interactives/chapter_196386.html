<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Amy woke up to hear her phone ringing.  It was her Mom!<br />
<br />
Paige stirred but remained quiet as Amy answered.  &quot;Hey Mom.  Oh wow, sorry, I stopped by a friend&#39;s house after the movie and I must have dozed off.  I could probably just spend the night and be back in the morning.  I know, you worry.  Love you too.&quot;  She hung up.<br />
<br />
The bright eyed little girl sat up and smiled.  &quot;In trouble?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not too bad.  I rarely misbehave, so I get a free pass...this time.&quot;  Amy shook her head.<br />
<br />
Paige looked at herself.  &quot;Uh, shit, I&#39;m sorry.  I hope you didn&#39;t freak out when I got smaller.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not really, you seemed to enjoy yourself more.&quot;  Amy grinned.<br />
<br />
Paige blushed.  &quot;Well, yes.  But I should have talked to you before doing something like this.&quot;<br />
<br />
Amy smiled at the small girl.  &quot;No harm no foul.  I can&#39;t get over how cute you are right now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Aw.  Hey, I could use a shower, care to join me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sounds good to me.&quot;  Amy got out of bed and picked up Paige, who seemed to weigh almost nothing, before setting the little girl on her feet.  Paige seemed to concentrate for a moment, and she became a little bit older.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, that&#39;s about all I can get until the pendant charges.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well it doesn&#39;t bother me.&quot;  Which it really didn&#39;t.  &quot;I never realized I was a lolicon.&quot;<br />
<br />
Paige laughed.  &quot;Well just as long as you stick to girls who look like kids, it&#39;s fine.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;All I want right now is you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Paige seemed happy with that answer.  Leading Amy into her bathroom, she started the water.  Paige&#39;s shower was fairly small, but at her current size, it was no problem, since they didn&#39;t mind being cozy anyways.  They did a little more than just get clean, but nothing too serious.  Paige offered an unused toothbrush to the older girl, and she was happy to brush her teeth.<br />
<br />
Afterwards, wearing nothing but towels wrapped around their drying bodies, Paige went to her fridge.  &quot;I can heat up some leftover pizza if you&#39;re hungry.  Fair warning, it&#39;s pineapple, pepperoni, ham, green pepper, and extra cheese.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not afraid of pineapple on pizza.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think I&#39;m in love.&quot;  Paige grinned.  <br />
<br />
Soon they were both dining on warmed up pizza, and it was delicious.  They went back to the living room, and sat back on the bed, with Paige getting comfy in Amy&#39;s lap.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, I have a few questions.  Your pendant can only do so much at a time, and then it has to recharge.  Is that because it can make people older too?&quot;<br />
<br />
Paige shrugged.  &quot;Each timepiece has it&#39;s own rules.  The Retro should be fine unless you overuse it.  A few transformations a day should be fine.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So you said you would tell me how you ended up stuck as a 13 year old.&quot;  Amy prodded, gently.<br />
<br />
&quot;I did, yeah.  Well, needless to say, I kind of got addicted to the power.  I changed a whole bunch of people.  Then I told a friend...a woman I really liked, but had been afraid to approach...she didn&#39;t know I was a lesbian.  We had a lot of fun.&quot;  She sighed.<br />
<br />
&quot;I thought it would never end.  The one night, she admitted watching me use the pendant turned her on.  She asked if it did the same for me, and I admitted, yeah, it did.  Then she kissed me, and I was totally floored!  We...were intimate.  And it was...good.  At first.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What happened then?&quot; Amy could tell the story made Paige sad.<br />
<br />
&quot;I found out that she had a boyfriend.  That she was only pretending to be my girlfriend so she could take the pendant from me.  She took it and said she was going to turn me into a little baby.  I could feel myself starting to get smaller, but I surprised her.  I wasn&#39;t a tall girl, but I&#39;d taken some martial arts when I was younger.  To deal with bullies.  I got it away from her, and then I turned her into a baby, just as she&#39;d planned for me.  She&#39;d had a baby carrier and everything set up, and had told her boyfriend to bring me to a couple that wanted kids.  He didn&#39;t even recognize her when he came to pick up the baby.<br />
<br />
I was...really upset.  I thought I was in love with Jessica...and she betrayed me.  I wasn&#39;t thinking straight and I tried to use the pendant to regress all the way...before I was even conceived.&quot;<br />
<br />
Amy gasped.  &quot;Oh no...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah.  Luckily, the pendant can&#39;t actually do that, and the owner had set a contingency.  I don&#39;t know how long I was stuck as a newborn, until he was able to make me old enough to talk.  He was sympathetic though, and said he&#39;d help me.  But the pendant was never the same after that, and it couldn&#39;t make me older than half my original age.  The owner says it will eventually regain it&#39;s full powers, but for now, I can&#39;t even use it on anyone else.&quot;<br />
<br />
Amy hugged Paige tightly.  &quot;I&#39;m sorry.  You didn&#39;t deserve that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks.  And no, probably not, but, what&#39;s done is done, right?&quot;  Paige sighed.<br />
<br />
&quot;So what happened to Jessica?&quot;<br />
<br />
Paige laughed.  &quot;She&#39;s three years old now, and wants to be a ballerina.  Unlike the Retro, only the person using the pendant remembers how things should be.  Technically, her parents should have believed they had a two month old daughter, but the owner fixed it so now they never had Jessica at all.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What about her boyfriend?&quot;<br />
<br />
Paige shrugged.  &quot;She didn&#39;t tell him much, he was big, dumb, and handsome.  Last I heard he was engaged to be married to some other woman.  My beef wasn&#39;t with him anyways, he was just a pawn in Jessica&#39;s plans.  I&#39;m sure the minute she found a guy with more money, she&#39;d have infantilized him too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, I just thought of something.  What if I used the Retro to switch your age with someone else?&quot;<br />
<br />
Paige frowned.  &quot;From what the owner said, something like that would only be temporary, I&#39;d start to get younger again almost immediately.  I&#39;m not sure what happens to the other person.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh.  I was thinking to switch us.  I know I&#39;m not that much older than 13, but it&#39;s something, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
Paige smiled.  &quot;Well we should ask the owner about it.  Otherwise, I&#39;d be 15, and you&#39;d be 7.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know, that could be fun too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, what do you want to do?&quot; The little girl asked.</p>
