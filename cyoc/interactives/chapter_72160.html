<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">A cry from upstairs reminded Jeff of his mother, lying in a crib, doubtlessly confused about what was going on. She tried to compose herself, and quickly pulled on her clothing (which once belonged to her mother) as she trotted upstairs. As she passed by the windows that flanked the front door, she could see that dusk had arrived and the stars were slowly making their appearance in the sky. She climbed the steps and made her way to the darkened room that she left her mother in. Thankfully, Jeff's sisters hadn't taken notice of their mother's cries.
</br>
</br>
Jeff turned on the lights and saw her mother resting just as she had left her. His mother, the real Grace, let out another cry as the lights came on. "Hush, hush," Jeff cooed. She lifted her mother up gingerly and began to carry her back downstairs.
</br>
</br>
"Mom?" came her sister's voice from down the hall. <i>It's Nikki! Shit!</i> Jeff tried to think quickly. <i>If she sees me like this... Oh, fuck!</i> Jeff began to hurry down the stairs, hoping that Nikki wouldn't leave her room. "Mom?" Nikki asked again. "Is that you?"
</br>
</br>
"Uhh...," Jeff tried to sound older than she was. "Yeah, Nikki, what is it?"
</br>
</br>
"What's for dinner? I'm starving."
</br>
</br>
Jeff spared a glance back upstairs, praying that her mother didn't take the opportunity to start crying again. Nikki's door was open and the light of her lamp flooded into the hallway. <i>Thank god you're a lazy bitch who never leaves her room,</i> Jeff thought. "Oh," she said, masking her voice as much as possible, "your father and I went out to eat. Fend for yourself tonight." Jeff waited, hoping that Nikki bought it.
</br>
</br>
There was a long pause before Nikki responded. "Whatever. Jenn did you hear that?!" she shouted.
</br>
</br>
"Yeah," came the response from farther down the hallway. Jeff slunk back into her room while her sisters began to plan their meals.
</br>
</br>
Jeff strode into her room, the smell of sex still heavy in the air. Paul turned over lazily in his sleep and Jeff didn't dare to turn on the lights. The only light in the room came from the florescent light of her computer monitor. She took a seat in front of it, cradling her mother carefully, who stared up at Jeff innocently. His mother's hands pawed at her shirt weakly. "I know what you want," Jeff whispered with a smile. She enjoyed doing this. Jeff lifted her shirt and guided her mother to her breast. It didn't take long for the real Grace to begin suckling on Jeff's breasts. Well, it was her own breasts Grace was really drinking from, even if they were twenty-two years younger than she last remembered them.
</br>
</br>
Jeff tabbed through the panels of the Chronivac. <i>Nikki, Jenn, dad, mom... They're all here,</i> she mused. She paused as she stared at her mother's window. <i>Oh, my god. This can't be right.</i> The display read that her mother retained her mind and her awareness. Jeff pulled her mother off of her tit and held the baby up to stare at. "You're still in there, mom?" Jeff whispered. Her mother only stared, but there was a hint of a smile on her baby face. <i>This changes everything,</i> Jeff thought. A thrill of power surged through her. Jeff lowered her mother back down to her breast, savoring the feeling of the milk draining from her perky young tit.
</br>
</br>
"Do you like that, mom?" she whispered to the baby. "Do you like feeding from your own boobs? Much younger and sexier boobs, too. Don't you miss being a sexy bitch? You could have had this." Jeff's free hand roamed her new shapely body. 
</br>
</br>
Grace tried to stop sucking from Jeff's breast, but she couldn't tear herself away. Her baby body needed that sustenance. Her situation was beginning to sink in slowly. Her son was flaunting her own younger body in front of her! And she needed him! She needed to suck at those lovely, milk-filled orbs! At least the change was only for the weekend. When she changed back, she was going to give Jeff the punishment of a lifetime!
</br>
</br>
"Y'know what, mom?" Jeff asked as she spun the computer chair around to give Grace a view of the sleeping Paul. "Dad really knows how to fuck. And what a cock he had on him back in the day!" Her husky voice dripped with desire. <i>Holy shit,</i> thought Jeff, <i>I'm dripping wet just thinking about it. Is it dad's cock that's getting me this horny or having mom be my little baby-bitch?</i> Jeff reasoned that it didn't truly matter, so long as she was getting off on it. Her free hand roamed to play with her clit, allowing a moan to escape from her lips.
</br>
</br>
"Oh, fuck, mom. What a body you had. I came in this thing twice already." She then whispered to herself, "And dad did once, as well." Jeff continued to explore her cunt as she gloated to her mother who could only drink in Jeff's milk. "I'm going to hold you just like this as a cum again, mom. Wouldn't that just burn you up? A sexy bombshell like me, like you used to be, writhing beneath you, a helpless baby?" Jeff's laugh was cut short as an impending orgasm began to take hold of her. "Oh, fuck me, mom. Suck my tits. Suck them dry. I wanna feel your lips sucking while I cum!"
</br>
</br>
Jeff rocked back in forth in the chair as her fingers dug deeper into her pussy. The electric feeling suffused her being as her ass heaved out into open space, her back falling into the seat of the chair. All the while her mother sucked hungrily at her chest. Jeff's muscles tensed and she felt her legs flailing out in front of her as the orgasm held her in thrall. For a moment, all of Jeff's thoughts jumbled together in her mind as she tried to hold steady against the intense rush.
</br>
</br>
A few minutes passed and Jeff began to regain her composure. "Well, mom, it looks like dad hasn't woken up yet. Kind of a shame, because I'd love to ride that cock again." Jeff laughed at this, knowing how enraged her mother must be as she helplessly depended on her. "Of course, I can't make any more changes to my body. Not that I know of at least. You can thank dad for that. Looks like I won't be able to change him, either. That doesn't mean I can't change someone else, however..."
</br>
</br>
Jeff smiled down at his mother, who stopped feeding long enough to understand the implications of her son's words.</p>
