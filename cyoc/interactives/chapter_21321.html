<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The boys started chatting to me. Boy they were gorgeous. The really fit one who had first spotted me on the stairs was called Neil, and if I'd found it hard in Mark's presence it was impossible in his. With a chiselled jaw, winning smile and toned body I couldn't resist his offer of a date that night.<br />
<br />
Having seen the drama master about the play I smiled cheerfully as I skipped down the stairs from the old drama room, feeling incredibly cheerful for some reason. I even giggled absently when I <br />
looked down at my big tits.  They didn't feel nearly as strange or alien on me as they had, but they were still a little unusual, and very interesting.<br />
<br />
Since school was over, I didn't pass more than a couple people in the halls as I made my way out of the building to the dorm. However, I could feel their eyes on me as I walked by, which oddly enough, made me feel sort of nice.  I grinned to myself.<br />
<br />
When I got to Roger's old room, I hurried in to the bathroom, locking the door and immediately turning to face myself. I smiled, feeling rather proud at the pretty girl that stared back. &quot;You are definitely hot.&quot; I told myself with a giggle. &quot;Damn.&quot; I whispered, <br />
practically drooling at the sexy girl.<br />
<br />
For several minutes I just stood where I was, rubbing at my breasts through my shirt, amazed at how nice they felt. Then suddenly feeling a little embarrassed, I got out of the bathroom and went to my room instead.<br />
 <br />
Once I was safely inside, I locked the door, noticing as I did so that there was a full length mirror on the back of it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Damn hot.&quot; I whispered to myself, beginning to get turned on.  Hell, I was already more than a little turned on. My insides felt warm and mushy, unlike anything that I'd felt like in my body or Simone's real one.<br />
<br />
I continued to stare at myself for several more minutes, making poses that I'd always wanted to see my step-mom in.  I grinned even wider as I remembered the time I'd spent with Enrique. My mind drifted to his toned body, his beautiful tanned and curving back and the strength of his girth as he'd entered her. This body would practically EAT Enrique at that point. Then I started to undress, slipping out of the sexy cheerleading outfit into the regulation underwear. It was still very cute on this gorgeous body. Those curves were actually me, my skin was actually as smooth as it felt as I ran my hands over it.<br />
<br />
Once I was completely naked, I was nearly in heaven.  &quot;God I'm sexy.&quot; I whispered to myself, posing even more and getting even more turned on. My nipples were so hard that they poked right out, feeling intense when I touched them. And my crotch....  My new slit was so wet that it was dripping down my thigh.  &quot;Holy shit.&quot;<br />
<br />
It didn't take me long before I was rubbing at my nipples and crotch, absolutely loving the sensations that they provided.  They were so much like what I normally had when turned on, but completely different as well.  As I played with myself, I felt even better and better.  It was so good that I moaned to myself, finally coming in a massive orgasm that was unlike any that I'd ever had before. It seemed to explode throughout my entire body rather than just from my crotch. And even better, I was able to keep at it until I came again.<br />
<br />
Suddenly remembering the date, I suddenly gulped, feeling nervous and scared. &quot;What am I going to do?&quot; I whispered to myself, seriously playing with the idea of canceling it. However, I knew that I couldn't do that now.  Sighing, I muttered, &quot;I might as well get this over with.&quot;<br />
<br />
I smiled absently as a fantasy of a big cock, Enrique's, fucking me filled my mind. I shuddered at that slight, but only slightly. At the moment I was too filled with the beauty of this body I was trapped in but which felt one with me and my soul to feel as disgusted as I thought I should<br />
<br />
Over the next hour, I went and took a long bubbly shower, even going so far as to shave my legs and under my arms with my old razor. I hadn't even really thought about it much as I did so, only doing what felt natural before a date.  Afterwards, I went about getting dressed and ready for the date.  Neither did I feel embarrassed about them. Instead, I actually started to get turned on again. I felt sexy and loved that feeling.<br />
<br />
When I was finally ready for my date, I stared at my reflection in the mirror and smiled, feeling incredibly proud of my looks.  &quot;He doesn't stand a chance.&quot; I told myself firmly.  &quot;Not a chance in the world.&quot;  Then I blew myself a kiss before going to wait for my date. Forgetting all about Mark.<br />
<br />
Neil arrived a short while later, and as soon as I saw him, I smiled to myself, absently wondering about how good he was in bed.  The thoughts bothered me a little, but not nearly as much as I would have expected it to. Instead, I  just shrugged it off, telling myself not to worry. To just relax and go with it.<br />
<br />
	I felt so sexy when I walked to Neil's car with him nearly drooling all over me in just that short distance. &quot;Here, let me.&quot; Neil insisted, opening the passenger side door for me. I smiled, feeling flattered at the motion. &quot;God you look gorgeous.&quot; he told me quietly, which only made me smile even more.<br />
<br />
	After we arrived at the restaurant that Neil was taking me to, I actually felt rather impressed. It was a pretty  nice one and a lot  more expensive than any that I'd ever taken a girl to.  Throughout the whole dinner, Neil was extremely polite and I loved the constant attention that he gave me. <br />
 <br />
Not just him either. I noticed that lots of guys in the restaurant kept looking at me and a couple of the girls as well.  It was more attention than I'd ever had before and I loved absolutely every second of it.<br />
<br />
Once we had finished with dinner, Neil and I went to Zippy's, one of the local teen hang-outs and danced. I knew that he'd mostly just wanted to show me off to some of the other kid's who'd be there, but I really didn't care. I was definitely in the mood to show off myself.<br />
<br />
	Eventually, we left Zippy's and I was still feeling giddy and excited. In the car, I giggled to myself, looking down at my generous breasts and telling myself that it wasn't just a dream. It seemed so...impossible.<br />
<br />
	&quot;I had a great time.&quot; I told Neil, wishing that it wouldn't end quite yet.<br />
<br />
	&quot;Who said the night was over?&quot; Neil asked me with a grin, pulling into the driveway of a small house, almost a cabin really that sat down the end of one road. When I looked at him questioningly, Neil just winked and got out of the car. Curious, I got out and followed him to the door.  &quot;It's my brother's place. It's right by college, don't worry&quot; he told me with a smug grin when he opened the door. &quot;He's out of town for a couple weeks though so left me the keys.&quot;<br />
<br />
	I felt a little uncomfortable for a moment as I went inside, looking around somewhat curiously.  &quot;Nice.&quot; I said, exaggerating slightly. The house was so small that it could have almost just been a shed.<br />
<br />
	Then before I could really think about what was going on, Neil caught me by surprise, grabbing hold of me and kissing me.  However, what surprised me more was the fact that I stared kissing him back just as passionately. My nipples, which had already been hard for half the night, started to poke out even harder. And I was so wet that I half expected that my crotch had to be leaking through my skirt.<br />
<br />
	&quot;You are such a hottie.&quot; Neil told me quietly when he pulled away.<br />
<br />
	 I just stared at him for a moment, burning with desire. I was so horny at that moment that it didn't take more than a couple more words before I'd started undressing.  Several minutes later, we were on the bed and making out passionately. Somewhere deep inside, I knew that what I was doing was wrong. That small part kept telling me to stop.  To think about what I was doing. However my hormones had different ideas and were much more insistent. This was better than even Enrique inside me. I felt far too good to even seriously consider stopping. The feel of the muscles all around Neil's body, gripping his firm butt, fondling his powerful arm muscless and stroking the stubble on the back of his powerful head was all too much. Our tongues sent each other into bliss as his girth penetrated me again and again. He took control of me and treated me as the gorgeous young girl I was. I wanted to be possessed and he took me, filling me with him and making me long for him more and more. He found time to gently lick my nipples with his tongue, caressing my breasts and fondling them. Sometimes he gripped my waist, his large strong hands guiding me and controlling my wide hips. Still they felt too wide, still they felt slightly odd, but his touch felt so right. I held his body tight to mine, and honoured his athletic tight curves with my small, soft hands. He was so much more than I was, so much greater in this small frame yet he longed for me, I longed for him to be in me and we gave each other such pleasure.<br />
<br />
Shortly afterwards, as he nibbleed at my slim neck I lost my virginity as a girl, loving absolutely every unbelievable moment of it.  I'd  exploded with not one, but 4 orgasms, each at least three times more powerful than any that I'd had as a man.  When I was finished and laying in bed next to Neil, my head nestling in the crook of his shoulder and those arm muscles I couldn't help smiling smugly to myself, thinking that if it felt that incredible as a girl, could I ever go back. I grinned at the thought of getting back into Stonewood just in time for the curfew after that.</p>
