<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Alright, Charlie-boy. We&#39;ll see ya later!&quot; Said the Anthony imposter from the front passenger seat<br />
<br />
&quot;Bye, Charlie,&quot; said his son, Gino.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, cya,&quot; Anthony said as he climbed out of his brother&#39;s vehicle.<br />
<br />
For the very first time, Anthony walked up to Charlie&#39;s front door. His friend and his family say there, curb-side, to make sure he wasn&#39;t locked out and could get in. He was very self-conscious and nervous, which wasn&#39;t like Anthony. Of course, he wasn&#39;t like himself as it is. <br />
<br />
He walked up the ramshackle front steps to the door. The house was a pretty sad state of affairs. He reached out to grip the doorknob, and turned it. The door opened. It was dark inside. No lights were on. He proceeded inside, but he took one last look towards the street. Vin beeped the horn twice in rapid succession, and saw as it drove off. He waited until the tail lights disappeared around the corner, and all was silent and dark. <br />
<br />
Sighing, he turned back around to proceed inside. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hello?&quot; He called out. It didn&#39;t seem as though his parents were home. He cautiously walked further into the house. Hands in pockets. <br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, I&#39;m.....home?&quot; He said, with a bit of trepidation to call this &quot;home.&quot;<br />
<br />
He was in a living room, and kitchen was to the left. Kitchen and living room were only separated by a bar. Already, he could tell the place was a mess despite the darkness. A slight musty smell, as well. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I gotta get out of this situation and find where Charlie sleeps,&quot; he thought. Straight ahead through the small living room, was a narrow, short hallway. He walked towards it. Just three doors. One on the right, one on the left, and one straight ahead. He tried the one on the right first. He opened the door, and was greeted by a messy bedroom in the dark. He felt to his left, and found the lightswitch. He flipped it on, and a bright, dull yellowish light came from a yellow foggy dome in the middle of the ceiling. Yup. The room was a complete mess alright. <br />
<br />
The bed was completely unmade. Clothes thrown about the room. Some old dirty dishes lying on the floor and on a desk that had a laptop and a headset. Bingo! He just hoped this WAS Charlie&#39;s room, and not some older sibling or something. <br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck it,&quot; he said. &quot;Figuring this thing out is top priority.&quot;<br />
<br />
He proceeded to the laptop to turn it on. He was greeted with a password protected screen. &quot;Great.&quot;<br />
<br />
He then saw a fingerprint scanner thing on the bottom on the laptop.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hhhhmmmm....&quot; He spread his new strange hands upward and looked at them. &quot;Might as well try.&quot; He placed his right forefinger on the pad. The screen changed, and said &quot;welcome, Charles Bennett.&quot;<br />
<br />
Seeing that name after his fingerprint worked, brought home to who he is, for now. Even computers thought he was a 14 year old kid! Born in....2005. 4 years after 9/11! He was a HIGH SCHOOL SENIOR on 9/11. He was now occupying a body that wouldn&#39;t be born until 4 years AFTER that!<br />
<br />
He had to shake those thoughts from his mind and get to work. Finally sitting down on the small wooden chair, he brought up the internet browser. There were already several tabs open, and one of them was a popular social media sight. He was looking at.....his own profile! A picture of him and his twin brother were up, both cute young boyish-looking Italian men with perfect, smooth olive skin, build like Vin Diesel. Vin with the wider, more prominant chest. Those arms! Those heads! Bald, and shaped a bit like the Ninja Turtles. Soft brown eyes. Despite the bald heads and built physiques, they were cute, in an innocent puppy-dog sorta way. Despite their builds, they didn&#39;t at all look like &quot;tough guys.&quot; <br />
<br />
Anthony started getting a hard-on. A raging hard-on!<br />
<br />
&quot;Wtf? Uh!&quot; He reached down to grab his little pole the the fabric of his sweats. Sweat began to bead on his straight light brown hair. The moment he touched himself, electricity flew through his new, younger body! <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh god.&quot; He stood up and stripped off his shirt to reveal his thin frame. Then took off his pants. Looking down at his pale shrunken body, his package was tenting his perfectly form-fitting boy&#39;s boxy-briefs. He touched himself through those boxers, and he was struck, yet again, by the electricity. <br />
<br />
Looking at the photo of himself, his boner became more raging. He HAD to beat off! It was like a horrible need to piss. He looked at the door to his room, and there was a mirror hung on the inside! Staring back at him, was a nearly naked, boxer-brief-clad 14 year old Charlie squeezing himself. He thought about his old body, and suddenly, his entire teenage body was wracked in ecstacy! He felt the thick, hot liquid burst out of his penis, as his boxers began to absorb the stuff. The remnants of the orgasm lasted another couple of minutes, but the shock of how quickly, easily, and hit intense that was, kept him motionless for those couple of minutes. <br />
<br />
Finally, he decided to get up and start moving. He had to clean himself off. He had to strip the now-dirtier boxers off, and reveal himself to himself. Wondering if this counts as pedophilic. Or the thoughts of his or Vin&#39;s bodies counts as incestuous. <br />
<br />
Getting naked for the first time, he stood up and looked down. His little penis was unimpressive. It was long and thin. But it wasn&#39;t really all that long. It was smooth. He checked his body. Not a wisp of hair to be found. His armpits only with the slightest beginnings of light brown dust. The tops of his ankles also with a slight dusting of very light, fine hair. He&#39;s definitely a teenager! A teenager just starting out! <br />
<br />
He walked over to look at himself in the full-length mirror on the door. While he was thin, he wasn&#39;t boney. He had a good shape to him, with his chest ever so slightly prominent. His arms were thin. He tried making a muscle, but barely a bulge popped up. He was used to his 15 inch diameter biceps. Now, the ones he currently possesses, could not be more than 7 or 8 inches! All of those hours and hardwork at the gym for the past 20 years when he first started working out at his current age. Gone! He&#39;s a scrawny little 14 year old kid again. But this time, without his best friend in the entire world: his twin brother, Vin. But he was determined to fix that. To regain his proper place in the world.<br />
<br />
Sighing, he decided to find a clean towel and a bathroom. There was nothing clean in or about this bedroom. He did find a towel lying on the floor. He was dirty anyway, so he used that to wrap around his thin frame before stepping out into the hallway, naked. <br />
<br />
The house was still dark. Nobody had come home yet. So he crossed over the hallway to the door across from his. Bingo! A bathroom! But this one, unlike the rest of the house, looked like it wasn&#39;t used. It was just a shower stall with no door or curtain. No toilet paper.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wtf? Do these people not take showers? He&#39;s got to, as he never stinks.&quot;<br />
<br />
He decided to go to the last door at the end of the hall. It was the master bedroom, and it, too, was a mess. There were clothes everywhere here as well. Turning on a light then picking up a pair of jeans, they were something someone his current age and size would wear. Matter of fact, all of these clothes looked fit for a thin 14 year old boy. Matter of fact, the entire room looked like it was for a teenage boy. Where we&#39;re his parents&#39; things? He saw a couple of trophies with &quot;Charlie Bennet&quot; on them. They weren&#39;t much. Mostly baseball participation trophies. One was a peewee football trophy for winning a local championship from several years ago. There was sporting equipment. A soccer ball. Baseball glove. Bat. A couple of baseballs. Baseball cards were out on a desk. On a shelf hanging from the wall, was a model rocket. There were no pictures anywhere. Just looked like a kid&#39;s room. <br />
<br />
Puzzled, he continued looking around. There was were two doors in this room. He opened one, which was a decent walk-in closet. None of the clothes were hung up. Just mostly lying on likes on the floor and on the shelf lining the closet. He closed that door, and walked over to open the other. Here, there was another bathroom. A proper full-sized bath. And it was definitely in use recently. <br />
<br />
He proceeded inside, as it was apparently the bathroom that Charlie just also use. There was a closet in this bathroom, and he saw a bunch of wadded up , unfolded towels just hastily thrown in there. Picking one up, he smelled it. It smelled clean and fresh. So he deposited the dirty towel he was currently wearing around his thin little waste into the empty hamper. Folded the new one up, and placed it on the radiator. <br />
<br />
He got the water running so it would get warm. Then turned around to pee into the toilet. The toilet was dirty. Of course! But he had to go.<br />
<br />
Taking hold of his much reduced penis (which irritated him looking at it and touching it,) he aimed it at the toilet and took his piss. By the time he was done, the water was already getting hot. <br />
<br />
He jumped in to take a shower. The water quickly wet his hair, and it was long enough to drape down into the upper part of his vision. He has to wash his hair. Something he hasn&#39;t done in over 20 years, as he always kept his head shaved. It was wierd to hair in the first place. In the second place, the hair he had was long, straight, and smooth. Not what his hair used to be: thick and wavey. And finally, it was wierd having to wash someone else&#39;s hair from whatever dirt and sweat that person accumulated throughout the day before the switch!<br />
<br />
But, wash himself, he did. He even used the conditioner. Satisfied, he turn the water off, grabbed the clean towel from the warm radiator, and dried himself off. He didn&#39;t bring anything clean with him to put on afterwards, so he wrapped the towel around his waist, and went back into the master bedroom. He went over to the closet to pick through the clothes in there. Found a pair of shorts and a T-shirt that smelled clean. Put them on, and they were a perfect fit! <br />
<br />
&quot;Does this kid not have any parents?&quot; He thought. &quot;Does he live alone?&quot; It was a sad and lonely thought.<br />
<br />
In any case, he went back to the room with tbe computer, and got to work.</p>
