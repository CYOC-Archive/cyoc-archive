<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><Br>You watch with wide eyes as the family changes right before you into furry, 
uncontrolled snarling beasts. You just stand there in a bit of shock and awe, unbelieving 
of what was happening right before you. You stand there and stare at the two who were 
just children or pups and see how defined they were even though there was barely any 
muscle on either the boy or girl. Laura, the wife was just licking her chops, foaming at the 
mouth and wanting to get her teeth into you for her sustenance. Just like Laura, Will was in 
much the same position, but he seemed to become a little bit more controlled and 
reserved.</Br>
<Br>In a very guttural voice Laura yells out "Time for dinner children! Dig in!" and just as 
they were about to leap to pounce on you, Will calls out while raising his clawed hand in 
the air rapidly to stop what they were about to do.</Br>
<Br>Unfortunately, they were right on top of you, waiting to make their blow before Will 
even had time to stop them. Laura and the children looked at their patriarch, wanting him 
to make the kill they felt that they were so deserving of. However, what they saw was not 
something that they had thought they would see on his face. Laura stared at her werewolf 
husband, noticing that there was a look of intrigue.</Br>
<Br>"What is it husband? Why do you not join us and make a meal out of him?" She says 
while looking you over now in close up. "Oh and what a fine meal he would be lover." She 
added last minute.</Br>
<Br>"There is something different about this one. Let me have a moment to figure it out 
before you render this creature to bits!"</Br>
<Br>"I grow tired of your interest in these creatures. You think that there is a link between 
us, some sort of ancestry to say where our race came from. We are all hungry and it is time 
to eat!" She bellowed as she rose her clawed hand, inches and moments from ending your 
life in a bloody and very messy swipe.</Br>
<Br>"Wait!" Will shouted as he charged over to Laura, grabbing her wrist and held her in 
place very firmly and with a previously unseen amount of authority.</Br>
<Br>They looked into each other's eyes and battled fiercely between themselves in look 
alone, as if their souls entered into a death match. Several growls and snarls ensued, but 
inevitably, Will won out as you hoped he would since he had a keen interest in your 
survival. Of course, you weren't too sure of the outcome down the road, but at least you 
had gained a little bit of breathing room. This of course would be used to your advantage, 
allowing you to think out your survival.</Br>
<Br>Laura backed up, ears lowered and tucked in, then snapped in Will's direction while 
she and the children retreated elsewhere to wait for their next meal that would now be 
provided to them by those who ran this place of "amusement". Once the three were gone, 
while you and Will remained, Will approached you.</Br>
<Br>Wanting to gain your composure, you move to at least sit up, but Will quickly snapped 
at you much like Laura. You knew that meant not to even move, so you paused and 
composed yourself in a way that was a bit more comfortable and non-threatening to the 
werewolf that temporarily spared your life. Will then slowly moved around you, looking you 
completely over, seeking any sort of minute detail that would give him something further 
to go on.</Br>
<Br>"Human!" Will snapped, "Tell me... why should I not kill you, please my wife and feed 
my two children?"</Br>
<Br>"Sir, there is no reason that I can think of. I am but at your whim and mercy, for there 
is not much else standing between life and death for me at this moment."</Br>
<Br>Will snickered "You are very wise human! I wonder if this alone is what I sense within 
you and what keeps me from eating your entrails for dinner this very minute with my 
family. No, there is definitely more that I sense from you, something I have never sensed 
from any of the other humans that have been our meals nightly. Tell me, what brought 
you in here?"</Br>
<Br>"Honestly, I was just wandering through several doors within this place."</Br>
<Br>"Do you feel as though you were drawn here, to me... perhaps?"</Br>
<Br>"Slightly, the doors that I chose to get here felt right to me, unlike the others that 
were cold and had no feeling at all to them."</Br>
<Br>"Very interesting! What do you think of me human, do you find me interesting as well 
or are you frightened of me?"</Br>
<Br>"Well... I have always been interested in the myth of the werewolf, especially the 
transformations process. Honestly, seeing your well muscled body, your massive sack and 
thick sheath, I am getting very aroused as well."</Br>
<Br>"Yes, you definitely are!" Will observed while he drew in closer for a deeper breath. 
"MMM... your arousal is like a fragrance I have never smelled before. Get up and sit on that 
sofa over there. Do not think about even trying to run since I will kill you before you even 
get the chance to get away from my grasp."</Br>
<Br>You did as Will said, not wanting to lose your life while interested in where things 
may go with this. Once you were situated on the sofa, face forward, Will walked over to 
you and stood with his crotch almost in your face.</Br>
<Br>"Tell me human, do you smell anything?"</Br>
<Br>You take a whiff and smell nothing. You look up at him and he stares at you sternly, 
then you take in another whiff, longer and more filling.</Br>
<Br>You begin to shake your head no, but stop as something you noticed was there. "At 
first, I didn't Will, there was nothing. Now, I smell something wonderful and erotic, like 
slightly warmed cherries from a cherry pie."</Br>
<Br>Will looked at you more intently, thinking that he may have found something he 
hadn't expected ever to. While he continued watching you, his eyes grew wide as he 
noticed that you were now smelling him, getting to know his scent while you were 
oblivious to the whole thing.</Br>
<Br>"Tell me, human... what do you think of me... a werewolf?"</Br>
<Br>Almost losing yourself in a bit of ecstasy you regain your focus and answer his 
question. "I think you are interesting. I think just being a werewolf is extremely interesting 
and up till now, I thought it was something that was impossible. Your kind didn't exist 
except for in movies or in the imaginations of those who thought the creature that you are  
is an exceptional concept."</Br>
<Br>"Interesting. I wonder, if you could be a werewolf... like me, would you take the 
opportunity?"</Br>
<Br>Your ears perked, your eyes widened and your heart raced faster from hearing that 
question. "Yes, I would! I would do whatever it took to be like you!"</Br>
<Br>With your answer, he looked even more intrigued... but was it solely from your 
answer or did he see something else you weren't aware of?</Br></p>
