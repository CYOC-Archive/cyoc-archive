<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Paulo Saul was not your average Brazilian... or at least not your average Brazilian man, and a part of that was what brought him to Las Vegas Nevada to look into the International Furry Convention that was being held there. It was something that was interesting and intrigued him greatly, particularly with the inclusion of Animalia and Horizon into it. Not every person that had come had become an Animalian before coming or even became one at the convention, but to a degree, it was part of what drew him to the convention. After all, some of what Animalia had brought out had appealed to him in other ways and that brought about some of his opinions as he interacted with some of the Animalians that were there.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll say that it&#39;s interesting... if not... well... flashy?&quot; Paulo commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, Hyenas aren&#39;t a flashy species,&quot; Vita spoke as shi looked to Paulo with Akia beside hir, &quot;in fact most mammalian predators aren&#39;t super &quot;flashy.&quot; It&#39;s something that would make them stand out.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not that there is anything wrong with having flair,&quot; Akia added, noting Paulo&#39;s attire.<br />
<br />
The shirt was a bright blue with a popped collar, and what stood out the most was the glittering sequins that ran along the edges of the collar and around the shirt&#39;s seams. They glittered as the room&#39;s lights came down on them. Paulo also wore pants that looked rather tight to both herm Hyenas.<br />
<br />
&quot;You don&#39;t like it?&quot; Paulo asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I was an uplifted Hyena... among the first herms Animalia and Horizon put together, after the Anacondas,&quot; Akia answered, &quot;So... to a degree, I&#39;m more curious about things than interested.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And I mostly converted to be with Akia,&quot; Vita answered, &quot;I was one of the keepers and caregivers for hir at the zoo she was in... and well... while, I&#39;d never considered myself gay or bi or trans... once Akia was uplifted, there was a part of me that missed hir. Finding out shi missed me... and well... I was more than willing to go all the way to be with hir, and I can&#39;t complain about what I&#39;ve become. Shi makes me happy and hopefully I make hir happy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So, you changed for love... or because of love,&quot; Paulo gave a small smile, &quot;well... I&#39;ve been trans... and most everyone I&#39;ve known knows. It&#39;s where I&#39;ve been a bit jealous on all things that come around regarding Carnival and what many of the women there wear.&quot;<br />
<br />
Paulo then paused as he looked to the two Spotted Hyena Animalians, as they wore fairly simple clothing that wasn&#39;t fairly flashy. Vita wore a pair of shorts while Akia wore a skirt, though the bulges in both gave him the indication that both of them were herms. It confirmed to Paulo what Vita had already admitted to, and that gave Paulo a bit more confidence as the three walked along toward the conversion centers that had been set up.<br />
<br />
&quot;And that&#39;s partially why I had filled out my information to go more in an... avian direction,&quot; Paulo explained as he held up the paperwork he&#39;d gotten back from Horizon. He&#39;d filled out the information for a herm Peafowl conversion online and had been hoping to meet with someone else that had converted into a similar animal, at least avian in nature. After all, he figured the male side of thing with the bright blue feathers and the long and brilliant tail feathers would look great paired with the generous curves that Animalian females had. Herm Animalians weren&#39;t quite as curvy as female Animalians and their shoulders weren&#39;t as broad as a male Animalians. For Paulo that seemed like the best option, as he could become closer to being the female that he&#39;d wanted to be and would retain the brilliant and flamboyant feathers that the Peafowl was known for. And Horizon did note that his provided understanding on the Peafowl&#39;s instincts and preferences were understood.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I&#39;m sure things will work out well,&quot; Vita commented as they escorted Paulo to that conversion area that had been set up, with a member of Horizon&#39;s staff being there. Vita was also there to help in the sense that while shi didn&#39;t work for Horizon, her own medical experience and working as a Horizon Light nurse. Akia was here more as an ambassador for the various herm Animalians, while Vita was also here to assist with the conversion process. Shi wouldn&#39;t be involved in the injections but would be able to provide some of the screening and logistics work... and provide some muscle if someone was disoriented.<br />
<br />
&quot;I hope so,&quot; Paulo spoke, &quot;I&#39;m just hoping that I don&#39;t come out looking entirely like a Peahen with its more drab coloring...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You want the male&#39;s coloring,&quot; Akia noted.<br />
<br />
Paulo nodded as they arrived at the area that was set up for the conversions. It wasn&#39;t huge, and was largely a series of temporary walls that were on stands. Paulo knew they wouldn&#39;t hold up to any serious contact, and there were improvised metal latches at the edges that helped hold them into the large squares that were set up for conversions, and some were at varying sizes, and all of which made sense. He presented his paperwork to the man at the reception desk to handle the official bit of things.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course,&quot; Paulo answered, &quot;it&#39;s more attractive. It&#39;s a shame that in so many bird species the male looks better and more attractive. While the female has nothing that says, &quot;hey look at me!&quot; But as a herm... I&#39;d have both.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... the point for female birds is in part to protect eggs, nests, and offspring,&quot; Vita commented, &quot;if they had the male&#39;s bright colors, predators might find the nests and either eat the female or the eggs.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;True... thankfully, Animalians won&#39;t have that issue,&quot; Paulo answered, &quot;and I&#39;ll see you on the other side... and maybe be friends.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We can be friendly,&quot; Akia answered, &quot;being friends will take time... though also keep in mind that this isn&#39;t Horizon&#39;s offices.&quot;<br />
<br />
Paulo answered and then went through with the last bits of things. The shot didn&#39;t hurt, and he was soon seated on a relatively tall stool inside that improvised conversion room. And for the most part, the transformation was relatively painless. The only things that were a little bit, uncomfortable related more to his clothing. It had some room to give, and Paulo did pull the back of his pants and underwear down a bit as his hips widened and his butt grew a bit bigger, but this was more for his growing tailfeathers. They itched a little at first as they came in, but Paulo did get some confirmation that the specific nature of his conversion would go the way he wanted it. As he managed to turn his head, which seemed a bit easier, he could see the long bright tailfeathers that Peacocks had that were largely green and had the brightly colored spots on them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes...&quot; Paulo spoke, though finding his voice rising a bit and leaving the male tenor voice he&#39;d always had, which would give some indication of the herm part of the formula kicking in, though his shirt soon provided another sign of that.<br />
<br />
There were some other changes inside his pants, as Paulo felt &quot;his&quot; equipment be pulled inside himself, which gave him a bit more &quot;room&quot; as his hips and butt altered. That was all part of fact that he&#39;d selected to become a Peafowl, and the reproductive organs on all birds was kept internally. The real thing that showed that he was becoming &quot;shi&quot; was as hir breasts began to grow on hir chest. They grew large, firm, and soft, and coated in bright blue feathers, and to a degree, Paulo felt they were what was causing hir shirt&#39;s buttons to pop and fly across the conversion room, but there was another issue and one that was actually bigger than hir growing breasts. Hir wings were starting to grow on hir back, and shi felt a bit constrained in them. Paulo felt trapped by not being able to spread hir wings, and soon began pushing back against hir shirt with them.<br />
<br />
&quot;But I liked this shirt!&quot; Paulo protested and gave a Peacock&#39;s calls as shi finally flared out her wings, which, when combined with hir growing breasts destroyed hir shirt. The only part that remained on hir was the sleeves, and it was that that actually hurt hir feelings. It was something that helped keep hir from getting too interested in hir new breasts and shi then called to gateway, &quot;excuse me... would you have something nice I could put on... I fear my wings have destroyed one of my flashier shirts... and... well... while I like my new chest... I&#39;m not sure I want to be THAT flamboyant on my first day as an Animalian.&quot;</p>
