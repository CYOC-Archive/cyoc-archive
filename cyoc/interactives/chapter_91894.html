<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">They woke up early the following morning very alert and refreshed, and while Ashlee was in the bathroom, Dave was preparing breakfast, chiefly a choice selection of meats on the grill.  <br />
<br />
“Breakfast is ready.”  He spoke up as Ashlee entered with a towel wrapped around her torso, but practically held in place by her immense mammaries.  <br />
<br />
“Thanks.  I think.”  She looked at what Dave had made for them.  <br />
<br />
“As you are, you’ll be needing a carnivorous diet now.”  Dave explained.  “I learned that one when I checked yesterday’s lunch.”  <br />
<br />
“I…see.”  Ashlee seemed to accept the explanation, taking her seat and beginning to eat, noting that her ability to chew was now limited.  <br />
<br />
“By the way dear, I have to ask, why?”  Dave began once they were finished.  <br />
<br />
“Why did I go for this?”  Ashlee pressed, pulling away the towel and letting out her breasts.  “You wanted this, then you’ve got it.”  <br />
<br />
“Is that, the only reason?”  <br />
<br />
“I never said that.”  Ashlee coyly replied, not being very subtle about it.  <br />
<br />
Dave came in closer, feeling them press against his bare scaled chest.  Their size meant that he was still a distance from Ashlee’s new face, but he could work around it.  <br />
<br />
“I suppose, I could get used to this, if you want.”  He finally admitted as he moved to her back and pulled her in that way, his head rubbing against hers.  <br />
<br />
“Hmm, you’re not the only one who can.”  Ashlee teased as a free hand took hold of his exposed cock, playfully fondling it.  <br />
<br />
“Hey hey!  The day’s just started.”  Dave exclaimed in mock protest.  <br />
<br />
“So?”  <br />
<br />
“Aren’t you…rushing things?”  Dave offered.  <br />
<br />
“Tch.  Fine, there’s a few thing I need to check anyway.”  Ashlee faked hurt as she left Dave in the kitchen.  <br />
<br />
Once Dave had cleared the morning dishes and was in the lounge, he had time to properly think.  True, after Ashlee’s remarks about his own use of the Pen, he was perplexed as to why she’d be so willing to use it herself, in much the same manner as Dave himself had.  But then, it did mean it would keep being used and that was alright by him, just so long as things didn’t get too out of hand.  He started flicking through the channels for a while before Ashlee came to sit next to him, now in a pair of leopard-pattern heels, three inches, with her favourite bracelets on her right wrist, four copper/brass rings.  <br />
<br />
“Any ideas yet?”  Ashlee enquired, the Pen and paper on a pad in hand.  <br />
<br />
“Perhaps.”  Dave replied.  “But there’s something that needs to be done first.”  <br />
<br />
“And what would that be?”  <br />
<br />
“To make sure nobody freaks out, after all, I’ve only set it so I can make them without people noticing.”  Dave explained as he gently took the Pen and let Ashlee see what he was writing:  <br />
<br />
All changes made by Ashlee to date, and all subsequent ones, will only be noticed by myself and Ashlee.  All changes made by myself will only be noticed by myself and Ashlee.  Conditions I’ve set to myself now also apply to Ashlee.  <br />
<br />
“There, that should take care of everything.”  Dave leant back and wrapped an arm around his now-feline girlfriend.  <br />
<br />
“Thank you.  Now what about them?“  The station jumping had paused on a rolling news channel, where a group of five were talking about something.  <br />
<br />
“Them first then?”  Dave asked, knowing the answer already.  <br />
<br />
“Them first.”  <br />
<br />
“Then, I’ll take one, and you another?”  Dave offered.  <br />
<br />
“That works with me.”  Ashlee agreed.  <br />
<br />
“Then, I’ll begin.”  Dave took his time to pick a target, who, and into what.  “I know.”  He wrote down:  <br />
<br />
The woman on the far right of the group on the TV, will become an anthropomorphic alligator woman, what she wears will be her footwear, any accessories she might have one, and her jacket to hold her microphone.  <br />
<br />
Like all the other times, her skin was the first thing to change as it became rough and darkened, becoming hard scales.  The clothes vanished save for what Dave had chosen for her to retain while a long thick tail emerged, her face become longer to create a snout filled with sharp teeth with the new claws she had completing the transformation.  <br />
<br />
“Typical you’d do that.”  Ashlee commented with a snicker as the other presenters paid their reptilian co-worker no mind with regards to her new form and distinct lack of clothing.  “Though I see her bust is quite normal.“  she was right, they were still about C-Cup size.  <br />
<br />
“I didn’t specify a change to them, so they’d stay as they were.”  Dave clarified for her.  “So?  What did you have in mind?”  <br />
<br />
“Something along those lines.”  Ashlee answered as she took the Pen and Paper for herself:  <br />
<br />
The presenter in the centre of the group will become an anthropomorphic snake, who’s clearly been on a recent eating binge as his stomach will be swollen out to his knees.  His clothing will be whatever accessories he has and his shirt with only the second-from-top button closed and all others open.  <br />
<br />
Now like the one before, his skin was replaced with scales, smoother and patterned like a diamond while his face elongated to form a snake’s snout.  As his clothes disappeared, his stomach swelled outwards, not stopping until the farthest pint from his torso was level with his knees.  And just like the other presenter, this too failed to attract attention from the still human presenters with them.  <br />
<br />
“You know,”  Ashlee spoke up as she leaned into Dave.  “I think I’m going to like this.”  <br />
<br />
“I’m glad you do.”  Dave confessed as he put his arm around her again, as they drew up plans for what to do next.</p>
