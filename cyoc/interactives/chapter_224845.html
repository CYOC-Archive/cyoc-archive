<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Scott sat down on a chair next to the table, feeling himself slipping further into the wizard persona. If he wanted to restore the business, there&#39;d be a lot of paperwork involved. Drawing unto his knowledge as a sales wizard, he reached into his robe and began pulling out stacks of blanks and forms.<br />
<br />
Might as well get comfortable. He transformed the chair into a much more expensive, comfortable model. He adjusted the height of the desk, conjured up some tea... he noticed Ruby was looking at him, confused. Ah, right, their tryst probably wasn&#39;t done after the kobold&#39;s ejaculation. Well...<br />
<br />
Pulling down his boots and socks, he tossed them away and stretched out his legs, wiggling his toes a little as he grinned down at the insignificant kobold.<br />
<br />
&quot;If you want more, why not help out my feet with a bath, Ruby?&quot; Scott said casually, a hint of mischief beneath...<br />
<br />
Ruby was in charge of his body. It was kind of confusing, this wasn&#39;t a DIRECT order, but it was an implied one, so he would probably get shocked if he thought of disobeying, right? F-feet are gross, he wasn&#39;t-. FUCK.<br />
<br />
Scott saw the kobold squirm as the collar shocked him. Got him. Still, as fun as this is, he had work to get to. Pulling out his wand, he pointed it at the kobold, casting a significant personality altering spell that would help John become Ruby, before looking at the first form in front of him and reaching for a pen.<br />
<br />
Ruby felt a wave of vertigo wash over him as his eyes focused themselves on the pair of feet before him. He was a kobold. He spent many years serving Master. Kobolds loved worshiping their masters. His Master was right there, toes on full display. Ruby loved feet. He would love to give his Master&#39;s feet a wash. He did so regularly.<br />
<br />
He moved willingly, his claws digging into the cold floor of the storage unit with each step and leaving behind scratches. As he stepped below the table, Master&#39;s body seemed positively radiant. It needed to be worshiped. It needed to be polished. The obsession took root within the very core of Ruby&#39;s mind. He laid down, positioning himself right under one of the feet. So plump, soft, fleshy... smelly... Kobold feet weren&#39;t like that at all. Ruby couldn&#39;t imagine having one of these sensitive, vulnerable things instead of his strong kobold paws. But he could imagine stuffing his face with that cold, soft...<br />
<br />
It seemed Ruby was taking too long admiring the feet. Without a word of warning, the massive foot shot down his muzzle, pinning him to the ground. The other pinned down his chest, rendering the kobold motionless as he instinctively reached out with his tongue to begin washing his Master.<br />
<br />
Scott gave a content sigh as he finished up one of the papers. Making the kobold a feet slut was a good idea. The lizard instinctively knew when to lick the rest of his feet, and when to come down towards the heel to tease the more sensitive spots. The forked tongue didn&#39;t cover much surface, but that made it all the more tickle as the two tiny prongs completed another circuit. The papers were going to be done in no time like this...<br />
<br />
Ruby was in heaven. Not sensually - his body wasn&#39;t being stimulated much beyond his cock standing fully erect - but his mind was beyond content. This was where he belonged. This is how he was made happy. The anxieties of his mind, unsolicited voices, everything was gone when he was like this. He was here alone, with Master, able to dedicate his entire being to making Master feel good. His nose told him stories about Master&#39;s body, about the room they were in as the smell of Master&#39;s feet grew familiar and began to fade into the background.<br />
<br />
The hour went well. Scott was nowhere near done with these papers, but this was a good start. John, - Ruby - seemed happy too. Stepping away from the tired kobold, he put on the socks and boots before standing up. This made Scott kinda erect, actually. He should probably finish up inside the kobold, and then the two of them could go home without the costumes.<br />
<br />
Conjuring up some lube, he picked the kobold up and put him on the chair, ordering him to bend over. They could probably do away with lube completely, that seemed primitive. Pulling out his wand (not the other one), he cast a quick spell on Ruby before opening up his robe and letting loose of his underwear.<br />
<br />
Ruby felt heat rush over him. He needed to be fucked by Master. Now. He felt his body relax as his pucker stretched out on its own to accommodate the insertion, his insides seemingly lubricating on their own.<br />
<br />
&quot;You can&#39;t cum until I order you to, whelp.&quot; <br />
<br />
Ruby heard the dominant voice of his Master say from behind him. His penis twitched as it seemingly locked itself up, the ability to cum vanishing from his being. Soon after, he whimpered in bliss as he felt Master&#39;s cock slide inside of him. First, slowly all the way in, then... out, and over and over again. Pounding him, edging him without release. It felt like it lasted forever, each second for the kobold stretching into tens as he longed for nothing more than release. He didn&#39;t dare disobey, not that he could anyway. He wanted to be given the command. He was ready to go at any moment. <br />
<br />
Even though it seemed like it took a long time to Ruby, it wasn&#39;t long at all. Maybe two and a half minutes at most. The wizard didn&#39;t have much stamina, and he would&#39;ve finished sooner but he felt like it would be too embarrassing so he took a brief pause, leaving the kobold whimpering needily. Shoving his dick in completely, he grabbed unto Ruby&#39;s shoulders as Scott arched his back, ejaculating inside the loyal kobold, thrusting a few more times to help get the cum out and into. God, it felt so fucking hot… this slut was HIS to do anything with. He&#39;d leave him like this forever if it wasn&#39;t John. <br />
<br />
Ruby felt Master&#39;s warmth coursing through his body. He didn&#39;t notice Master pulling out his magic wand and casting another spell as he happily laid splayed out on the chair. He still longed for his own release, of course, and that had him on edge, but he was very happy to satisfy Master. Master pulled out, leaning onto the table, washing them both off with a quick spell.<br />
<br />
&quot;Stop laying in my place, slut.&quot; He heard Master aggressively say behind him. Gods, he loved it when Master called him derogatory things. He stood up and climbed down the chair.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now, you little cocksleeve probably think you deserve another release today, don&#39;t you?&quot; Master loomed over him menacingly, looking down at Ruby like he was the most pathetic thing he&#39;d ever seen. Ruby nodded hesitantly.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t think you do.&quot; With a flourish of his wand, spectral chains appeared in the air, shackling Ruby&#39;s arms and legs as they pulled him into the air, putting him just below eye level with Master. Master pushed his forehead into Ruby&#39;s.<br />
<br />
&quot;Beg.&quot;<br />
<br />
The urge to beg came to the forefront of Ruby&#39;s mind. He couldn&#39;t move, held in bondage by the chains. He couldn&#39;t cum, ordered by Master earlier. He couldn&#39;t say anything else, ordered by Master to beg now. So he begged. His uneducated kobold mind couldn&#39;t come up with any eloquent pleas, instead resorting to demeaning himself in front of Master, saying how Ruby is so inferior, how he would be made so much happier if Master allowed him to cum… p-please… The heat was getting too much for him, making his mind ache as he longed for nothing more but a swift finish.<br />
<br />
He really reduced John to something pathetic. Oh, the two of them would have such embarrassing conversations about this later. He had been recording this the whole time, so once John was in a clearer state of mind he&#39;d show this to him. Well, enough was enough. Propping the phone up with magic, he walked over to the shackled kobold, whispering something into his ear. The camera had the kobold in full front view as Scott arched his arm and gave Ruby&#39;s butt a strong slap. The kobold came on the spot, his red barbed dagger releasing large streams of hot liquid, a streak reaching the camera. With another slap, another came out as the kobold yelled in a combination of pain and happiness. This happened again. And again.<br />
<br />
Scott actually enjoyed making someone cum on command. Perhaps he&#39;d somehow make it a quirk John normally had. He gave another slap, arm getting tired and hot as he watched his friend release another load. This was probably enough.<br />
<br />
Letting him stew like that for another few minutes, Scott began to remove the kobold&#39;s costume. He wanted to keep John shackled, though, so he worked out a quick magic solution to finish getting Ruby out of the suit.<br />
<br />
Ruby felt weird. His flesh was being pulled from him, like he was shedding his skin, but more. As it was completely removed, he felt himself quickly stretch, fill, crack and thicken as he morphed into a large, human form. Gods, the room was so much smaller like this… and his cold, fleshy hairy body felt wrong. He liked being a kobold better. Why was Master turning him human?<br />
<br />
He didn&#39;t have long to contemplate as Scott-. Scott?? Took off his collar. Still bound in chains, completely naked, memories of his old life returned to him, mind regaining it&#39;s faculties and booting up all the usual functions, now mixed in with the personalities of Spot and Ruby… Did Spot even have a personality? It felt like only Ruby had a distinct one. His brain couldn&#39;t quite put a finger on it, but decided to run a simulation of Spot&#39;s personality as well, contributing to the weird mess of John&#39;s mind. <br />
<br />
John was really happy with how this went. Actually, he was hard again. And &quot;flustered&quot; doesn&#39;t even begin to describe how he felt as he was propped up by chains in mid-air, stewing on all the memories of the last hour and a half.<br />
<br />
Scott, his dominant persona subsiding, leaned on John and looked up at his face, grinning as he smugly said: &quot;So, puppy, did you like that?&quot;<br />
<br />
John swallowed. &quot;Y-yeah…&quot;<br />
<br />
Scott stroked John&#39;s shaft. &quot;I recorded quite a bit, you know… you look fantastic naked, Ruby.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ruby&#39;s part of John&#39;s brain was excited, taking over a little bit of John to come to the forefront.<br />
&quot;T-thank you, Master…&quot;<br />
<br />
Scott chuckled. &quot;Now, John, do you want to go home? We can change roles tomorrow, you know.&quot; He booped John on the nose, releasing him from the chaining spell as John fell down on the floor.<br />
<br />
&quot;N-no, i-it&#39;s f-fine… L-let&#39;s go home…&quot;<br />
<br />
Ah. A stammering mess. He loved to receive that compliment. Helping John put on some clothing, the two of them left the storage unit as Scott removed the wizard suit, his regular-human personality returning to him. Holy fucking shit. Scott did a lot of things he normally wouldn&#39;t otherwise, now he got why John was acting the way he did before… well, he&#39;s glad it didn&#39;t get out of hand. And the two of them were very satisfied, too…</p>
