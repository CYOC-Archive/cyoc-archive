<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Nora slowly woke up. Still drowsy, she felt herself snuggled up against something warm. It felt comforting, and so she snuggled up even closer. His warmth was nice. That was right, she was sleeping next to a boy. Yesterday came back to her, how she went home to this guy, how they fucked. Heh, she let him have his way with her, cute little her. She smiled.<br />
<br />
She was waking up more, so she opened her eyes. Aman was right there, eyes closed and a dopey expression. Cute! He looked so peaceful and content. Another thing, his arm was around her, keeping her safe and secure in his embrace. How nice. It emphasized how she&#39;d become oh so much smaller. They were laying together on the same couch from yesterday, having almost collapsed there after their fun. Also, they were still naked, something Nora was reminded by by her sensitive chest brushing against Aman&#39;s. And, something very interesting, something particular was poking the front of her thigh. Hehe. Was he thinking of her perhaps?<br />
<br />
Nora felt Aman shifting around. Was he waking up? It did seem like it. His eyes opened and his sleepy gaze met hers. &quot;Good morning,&quot; she chipperly greeted.  &quot;Uh, good morning,&quot; he replied. They then looked at each other in silence for a bit. As much as Nora enjoyed snuggling up against Aman, she felt a little sticky from all the sweat from yesterday. &quot;Can I borrow your shower?&quot; she asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yeah, sure, bathroom is right there,&quot; he pointed at a door.<br />
<br />
Nora stood up from the couch and left for the bathroom. She entered the shower and there she noticed something. There was a bunch of feminine hygiene products there. It reminded her of something. Aman used to be a girl. What about his wardrobe? Could she perhaps raid her closet? Nora smiled. It would be perfect. It&#39;s not like she could afford a whole new wardrobe, or at least one as expansive as she desired. She quickly finished her shower, grabbed a towel and tied it around her modest chest.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Aman?&quot; she started. &quot;Could I borrow some clothes?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, sure.&quot; He didn&#39;t seem to mind.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yay! Thank you!&quot; she cheered, maybe seeming a little overtly positive, but she was in fact very giddy at the prospect of dressing up.<br />
<br />
Aman showed her his room. It wasn&#39;t particularly girly, but Nora did eye some makeup and a mirror. She wanted to try makeup, though she&#39;d never even touched it before, and as a jock, it&#39;s not like Ben ever had any affinity for arts and craft. Nora did need to learn, but first clothes! She pulled out various drawers, revealing stuff from blouses, pants and what not.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ooh, can I try some out?&quot;  she asked Aman.<br />
<br />
&quot;Go right ahead,&quot; he answered, still just standing here.<br />
<br />
Nora waited a few seconds before she said &quot;Could you leave? You&#39;re a boy remember?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, right,&quot; he said and left the room. &quot;I&#39;ll take a shower, take your time,&quot; he said from outside the door.<br />
<br />
Nora had a few thoughts about Aman. He seemed kind of timid. Nora did maybe want her potential ideal boyfriend to be a little more assertive, maybe even possessive of cute little her. Though, on another hand, Aman seems pretty agreeable, and cute, very easy on the eyes. Maybe with some influence from her, he could become what she wanted in a boyfriend, but enough of that. Regardless of if Nora and Aman can be a thing, it was time to take advantage of her situation and dress herself up.<br />
<br />
Nora started with underwear. Panties fit. She tried a that looked cute bra. She tried getting it on. And, she tried again, and there. It&#39;s on. It did fit, or at least Nora thought so. She didn&#39;t have that much experience in what made an ideal bra, but this seemed like it worked? It felt alright enough. She hoped she was right, that would save her a lot of money.<br />
<br />
Next were blouses and shirts. She slipped a few on. They were a little loose and long on her, but some of them worked.  Though the ones that were designed to be a tight fit like this crop top didn&#39;t work on her, her torso too narrow and shirt. Another reminder how small she&#39;d become, and she loved it.<br />
<br />
She also tried pants. Pants did not fit at all. They were simply too long. The problem was solved by shorts and skirts where length is less of an issue, but the selection was a little disappointing. Like two denim shorts and one, no two, skirts. Her ideal wardrobe would have way more skirts, short ones showing off her knees, long ones for an innocent modest look, and dresses. How did Aman not have a single dress here? Well, he did choose become a boy after all. Not a grand surprise the selection is not outright super girly, but nevertheless Nora was still happy with what she got. She couldn&#39;t consider it hers to own just yet, but she hoped she could soon.<br />
<br />
For now she settled on wearing one of the skirts, it was of loose fabric, just covering her knees. It was a soft blue specked with small illustrations of orange slices. On top, she had a light pink shirt with a cartoon teddy bear on it. It hung loosely off her. A somewhat casual outfit. She looked in the mirror. Adorable! She was so cute! She was ready to go out back to Aman, that is if he was done with his shower.<br />
<br />
She stepped out. &quot;Aman?&quot; she cooed. She saw him. &quot;Hey!&quot;<br />
<br />
He looked over her, checking her out. &quot;Hmm. It suits you, but it&#39;s weird seeing someone else wear my clothes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hrmph,&quot; Nora scoffed. &quot;You&#39;re not supposed to call a girl weird!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I didn&#39;t,&quot; Aman defended himself. &quot;I said it&#39;s weird that-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Whatever!&quot; she interrupted him. &quot;You&#39;re supposed to be all ooh and aah about how cute I am!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, you&#39;re looking very cute!&quot; Aman immediately complimented.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks!&quot; she smiled from ear to ear. &quot;Gee, it&#39;s difficult to think that you were a girl with how little you know of how to treat one,&quot; she giggled. But don&#39;t you worry! I will teach you!<br />
<br />
Inside of her head, Nora wondered if she was maybe coming off a little too strong, but if this was going to be a relationship, she wanted to properly define its premises, and she wanted it to revolve around herself being cute. Self-centered? Maybe, but Aman would get the privilege to enjoy her cuteness too.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now,&quot; Nora continued. &quot;I want you to do my makeup! Also,  you have to teach me! She walked right up to Aman and looked him in his eyes. &quot;But after that, we can do whatever you want,&quot; she said slowly, putting on her best attempt at a sensual seductive tone.</p>
