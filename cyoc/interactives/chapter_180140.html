<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Randy contemplated for a little while before stating, &quot;Let&#39;s try and get some new clothes. Like it or not, we&#39;re gonna be like this until these tattoos fade away.&quot; Tell the truth, Randy was conflicted. 45 was a long way away from how old he was before, but at the same time, he was now much more heavily built and impressive looking, like a guy who&#39;d been bodybuilding most of his adult life. And the effects of aging weren&#39;t overwhelming on him. So maybe with a little bit of work on himself he could at least make it not quite so obvious.<br />
<br />
Eli on the other hand was not quite so ready to accept what he&#39;d become. As far as most people could tell, he was now a woman. At least while they couldn&#39;t see his groin. And while Randy was willing to work with what he had, Eli felt like it would get in the way of how he preferred to live. &quot;...Long as I don&#39;t get any female clothes. Boobs or not, I&#39;m a guy. I&#39;ll dress like a guy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;ll be pretty difficult, Eli,&quot; Randy said as the two of them started moving away from the now closed nightclub. &quot;You&#39;re...well, pretty developed. Maybe we could find some unisex clothes for you. I&#39;m sure there are stores that have those.&quot;<br />
<br />
Eli adjusted his shirt, noting how uncomfortable his usual attire was with these weights on his chest. &quot;Yeah...yeah! Unisex clothes! I think there&#39;s a mall nearby.&quot;<br />
<br />
True to his words, there was - but Eli was not looking forward to getting hit on by any horny college guys who assumed he was a woman. Maybe he&#39;d be able to find some sort of tight fitting sports bra that&#39;d make his bust a little less obvious.<br />
<br />
It did not take long for the two of them to make their way on over to the mall, which was even at the evening hours still thrumming with activity. Eli and Randy stopped near the entrance, seeing numerous college students they probably knew heading in to hang out and or buy things there. Eli gulped and thought he heard some jocks - former friends of his - start whooping and pointing him out. Seemed at least some of them liked &quot;muscular chicks&quot;. Eli restrained himself and looked at Randy, &quot;You sure about this?&quot;<br />
<br />
The two store mall was a local hub of activity, and whether they liked it or not they were gonna be reintroduced to their peers like this.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, it&#39;s either this or we make due with what we have at home.&quot; Both shook their heads at this. Eli didn&#39;t have ANY clothes that would fit him now, and Randy&#39;s own clothes were chafing on him badly and he needed clothes fitted for a man easily 70 lbs heavier than he had been going into that nightclub.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, meet you back out here.&quot; Eli said as he looked at one of the various sports apparel stores.<br />
<br />
&quot;See ya.&quot; Randy nodded, heading off toward the larger clothes store in the back.<br />
<br />
Eli walked into the sports apparel store and was immediately greeted by a young woman. Red haired and with green eyes, Eli was immediately impressed by how athletic yet thin she was, and the way her outfit flattered her body. He had to control himself though and not make it too obvious he was into her. At least while he was like this. Soon as the tattoo wore off, though, he was gonna head back and try and go out with her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Welcome to Mercury Sports Apparel. I&#39;m Emma. Looking for anything in particular, miss?&quot; Of course seeing as she took Eli for a woman...<br />
<br />
Eli bit his lip a little, but figured that he should at least roll with it for now, &quot;Uhh yeah, I&#39;m looking for unisex sports apparel. I&#39;m trying to find something to show off my gym body.&quot; He grinned somewhat awkwardly. Yeah, she was entirely his type, but he couldn&#39;t well act on it or make it obvious without her seeing what was going on with him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, okay, Aisle 3 in the back. Then a bit further back we&#39;ve got some changing rooms for you to try what you like on.&quot;<br />
<br />
Eli thanked her and then quickly kept moving so she wouldn&#39;t notice that he was growing erect. Eli just couldn&#39;t help himself. Much as he&#39;d changed so far, he was at his core a college jock with a libido to match. And he was really feeling turned on by this store clerk woman. He just had a thing for busty redheads. Ask his last three girlfriends.<br />
<br />
Eli headed back and started looking at the unisex gym gear. He was impressed by the tops - in particular some black and blue short sleeved and sleeveless upper body suits, shorts, and shirts. While he was there he started looking around and found a few sports bras as well. Figuring he might as well, while he was here, make himself more comfortable, he picked up a few of them as well. He wasn&#39;t REALLY getting used to his new body at all, he told himself.<br />
<br />
He was just making sure he was comfortable.<br />
<br />
With that, Eli headed into the changing room, stripping out of his party clothes and trying on the new clothes. As he did so he looked at his nude reflection while he was in there. Seeing the mixture of masculine and feminine present in him yet again, now in a less heady, addled party atmosphere. Eli felt at his manhood, still as large as ever and the slightly wet pussy behind it, nestled near his balls. He felt a sense of curiosity about that. How...how would it even feel to try that new sex organ out?<br />
<br />
He thought about Randy and wherever he was.<br />
<br />
Remembering Randy, his newly heavily muscled figure and aged countenance, Eli started to feel himself growing more aroused, curiously enough. He never considered himself a bisexual or anywhere close to queer in sexuality, but as he thought back to it, he really could see Randy as being kind of sexy. He shook his head and groaned. He...really needed a good fuck tonight. But how was he gonna do that when he was...like this?<br />
<br />
Once he had tried on everything, Eli got dressed again and took another minute to calm down. Thinking of baseball games and such things as lampreys to get himself down from a sexed up state.<br />
<br />
As he got dressed in his old clothes and headed out with the clothes, he was surprised to see the clerk, Emma, waiting out front for him. He tilted his head a little bit at her, &quot;Is there anything up, Emma?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I was just feeling a weird connection with you...&quot; She almost seemed troubled by it. &quot;I&#39;ve never felt this kind of an attraction to a woman before. But seeing how built and strong you are...would you mind if we used the changing room a little bit more?&quot;<br />
<br />
Eli gulped, wondering if she would be so eager if she knew the truth about him. And at the same time, his libido was reignited right then and there. She was exactly his type, and here she was coming on to him like this. Fuck, exactly what he needed. Maybe Randy could wait and do whatever the hell he was doing off in his own store... Eli contemplated. He could take a chance, or he could just keep going on his way...</p>
