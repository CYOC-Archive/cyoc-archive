<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Once back in the yard, Missie and a couple of the other girls immediately bounded forward and began playing again with wild abandon. Jen wanted desperately to join them. The morning&#39;s playtime had been so much fun, but right now she had a mission. Amelia had excused herself after dropping them off in the yard, but Betty had arrived shortly after she left with Mina in tow. Jen approached her and tried to figure out how to best communicate her need like a dog would. She settled for crouching into a half squat and whining.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, is it that time already?&quot; Betty asked, cluing in instantly. &quot;Glad to see you&#39;re still keeping a regular schedule. Give me one moment to tie up the miscreant and then I&#39;ll lend you a hand.&quot;<br />
<br />
Betty tied Mina&#39;s leash to the ring again and followed as Jen made her way over to the grass in front of the trees. Once Jen had picked a suitable spot she looked up at Betty for direction. Betty knew what was needed. She reached into her pocket and pulled out a pair of latex gloves.<br />
<br />
&quot;Lower your shoulders and stick your tail out.&quot; Betty commanded, pulling the gloves on with a snap.<br />
<br />
Jen obeyed, arching her back and presenting her hindquarters. Betty knelt down and gave her tail a careful tug. Jen tried to relax, but the plug that held the tail in place was quite large. At least it was from Jen&#39;s point of view, having never had anything up her ass before it. She whined softly as she felt it stretch her asshole.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just breathe.&quot; Betty soothed. &quot;You&#39;re doing fine.&quot;<br />
<br />
With a slight popping sound, and a grunt from Jen, the plug came free. Jen quickly squatted down and let nature take its course. When she had finished her business Betty bagged it up and wiped her clean. Jen assumed the position again. She was expecting Betty to replace the tail, but she let out a surprised squeak when she felt gloved fingers begin to probe her instead.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t mind me.&quot; Betty said. &quot;I&#39;m just giving you a quick exam. The plug was designed with long-term wear in mind, but we still have to be careful. There&#39;s always a risk of infection or tearing. You seem to be doing okay, but I think I&#39;m going to have the trainers remove your tail before you go to sleep from now on. We need to give you proper rest, and that means all of you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen held still while Betty inspected her pucker. Once she had satisfied herself that Jen wasn&#39;t beginning to develop any medical problems she quickly sanitized and lubed the plug again. Jen found that in went in easier than it had the first time. Once it was firmly back in place she turned to face Betty and wiggled her hips so the tail wagged back and forth just like a happy dog. The plug shifted inside of her more forcefully than it had while she was walking. Jen gasped from the sudden pleasure. Betty laughed and ruffled her hair.<br />
<br />
&quot;Go play now.&quot; She said. &quot;And try not to let that tail of yours carry you away. Get too frisky with the other girls and you may find yourself joining in on Mina&#39;s punishment.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen gave a short bark and turned to go and play. She stopped short when she saw that she had gained an audience. Missie, Emily, a few of the other girls, and several of the trainers were all watching her. She could tell by their expressions and the sudden air of nonchalance that many of them gained that they had been watching her this whole time. She blushed a bit, but shook it off quickly. She was just a dog here, and so were they. At least the ones who weren&#39;t trainers. What she had done was normal for a dog. The others would have to do it too, eventually. The special diet they had all been given would make sure of that.<br />
<br />
Missie seemed to understand that. Just like that morning, she trotted forward and squatted. It didn&#39;t take anywhere near as long as expected. She almost seemed shocked at how easy it was. Her trainer hustled over and quickly cleaned up before giving her another treat. The blonde teen ate it with a look of satisfaction on her face.<br />
<br />
Since the show was over, for now, Missie and the other girls went back to playing or staring forlornly around the yard. Jen was about to go join Missie when she spotted Emily still sitting over by the door. Her sister was trying not to look at Mina, who was being lead through a rather odd looking yoga routine by Betty, while simultaneously trying to not look interested in the other girls playing. Though she was hiding it well, Jen could see just a hint of longing as the younger teen watched the others play tug-of-war and fetch or just romp around with glee.<br />
<br />
Jen decided that Emily needed a bit of encouragement to join in. She raced over to her sister at a surprising speed. Her month of training had given her quite a bit of skill at running on all fours and while a real dog would forever outpace her she could still take another human by surprise. Emily was completely unprepared when her sister bowled into her and sent her tumbling. When she regained her footing she turned to cuss Jen out, but was struck speechless by the sight of Jen in the shoulders-down, paws-out pose of a dog that wants to play.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wha-&quot; Emily started, but quickly caught herself before her collar could activate.<br />
<br />
Jen leapt forward and licked Emily&#39;s face. It was a proper doggy-lick. One big slobbery slurp up her cheek. Emily lurched backwards in confusion and disgust. Back home she had taken Jen for a walk. She had watched as Jen obeyed her commands. Just that morning she had been shocked to see Jen play with actual dogs as if she were one of them. But in this moment Jen seemed even more dog-like than ever before. It scared Emily a little, watching her once uptight sister sink so easily into the role of an animal at play. It also made her heart swell with jealousy. Her conflicting feelings distracted her at just the wrong moment. She was once again knocked head over paws, this time by Missie.<br />
<br />
Missie was a big girl. Not overweight, but tall and broad. If she was standing upright she would easily be over six feet tall with broad shoulders and hips to match. Recollection finally dawned on Jen. She had seen Missie before, at a track and field event with several rival schools. Melissa Bankman had blown away the competition and won first in both shot put and hammer throw, almost breaking the state record in the latter. Jen remembered how her and the other cheerleaders had made snide comments about how the blonde athlete&#39;s muscles made her look like a man and wondered how she hid a penis in her tight track shorts. Like many things in her recently former life, Jen now regretted that.<br />
<br />
Emily found herself pinned down under the much larger girl, her face uncomfortably close to Missie&#39;s bare b-cups. Like Jen, Missie was truly getting into the spirit of being a dog. She began enthusiastically licking Emily&#39;s face like an over-excited puppy while Emily struggled to get away.<br />
<br />
&quot;Missie, heel!&quot;<br />
<br />
Missie&#39;s trainer ran over, the remote for the teen&#39;s collar in her hand. Missie let out a squeak of pain and Emily took advantage of the distraction to pull herself free. The trainer grabbed Missie&#39;s collar and began pulling her away.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bad girl! Either you play nice with the younger girls or you don&#39;t get to play at all.&quot; Jen heard the trainer admonish as she lead a contrite Missie to the other side of the yard.<br />
<br />
Jen heard an angry growl and turned back to her sister. Emily was tugging at her pads, clearly trying to remove them. Betty had designed them quite well, thanks to Mina and Kyle, and they weren&#39;t budging in the slightest. Jen padded closer, but stopped when Emily growled again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Stop pulling at them.&quot; Jen whispered. &quot;You&#39;ll get punished if one of the trainers sees you.&quot;<br />
<br />
At Jen&#39;s words Emily growled even louder and began pulling at her collar. Jen knew what was about to happen and rushed forward to stop her, but was too late. With a strangled cry of pain Emily&#39;s entire body convulsed and she collapsed to the ground where she lay still. Jen knew that the collars would deliver a heavy shock if you tried to remove them. All the girls had been told this when Betty had put their collars on. This was so they could be removed in an emergency without having to wait for someone to find a key. Sure they might get a shock, but better to be shocked than strangled to death if the collar got caught on something.<br />
<br />
Jen panicked. She had never experienced the shock collars before. Thanks to Kyle&#39;s twisted curse she had behaved herself the entire time she had been here and never needed one. She carefully placed a gloved hand on her sister&#39;s shoulder. Emily was shaking, but not with pain. Jen realized that she was quietly sobbing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tried to take her collar off, huh?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen looked up to see Betty standing over them. The older woman had a concerned look on her face. She knelt down and carefully examined Emily&#39;s neck.<br />
<br />
&quot;She&#39;ll be fine.&quot; Betty said. &quot;The shock she got was painful, but not harmful. I&#39;ll want to take a good look at her later though. Both of you, actually. I was in a hurry to get you prepped for the special training and never gave you a proper intake exam. I&#39;ll have the two of you brought to my office when afternoon classes are finished.&quot;<br />
<br />
Betty went back over to Mina, who was waiting patiently for her next command. Jen watched the redhead for a moment, then turned back to her sister. She knew she needed to convince Emily to relax and enjoy herself. It was the only way to get through this. She briefly considered trying to use the curse on her, but it was too crowded here. If she was going to use the curse she wanted to do it in private where she could control things better. No, she would have to do this with words and actions alone. She leaned closer so she could whisper in Emily&#39;s ear.<br />
<br />
&quot;Remember what I told you this morning?&quot; she said as quietly as she could. &quot;About just going with it? Fighting this will only cause you more pain. Just let yourself go and enjoy it. Look at Missie.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen looked over at the big blonde girl. She had recovered from her punishment and was already back to playing.<br />
<br />
&quot;See how she&#39;s enjoying herself? She doesn&#39;t care other people might think, she just wants to have fun. Now look at the other girls over in the corner.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen nodded towards the knot of girls sitting stiffly off to the side. These were the ones who clearly were not here by choice. They glared at the other girls who were, in various stages of apprehension and embarrassment, playing with each other and the real dogs. Only two or three of them still had the look of iron resolve on their faces. The rest looked like they could break at any moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t they look miserable? Which would you rather be? I know I would prefer to be over there having fun rather than sulking around dreading the next punishment. Come on, stand up.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen pulled Emily up onto her hands and knees again and wiped the tears off her cheeks.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s go and play for a bit. Just run around. In no time you&#39;ll be having so much fun that you won&#39;t care about anything else.&quot;<br />
<br />
It took a bit more coaxing, but Jen eventually got Emily to start crawling around the yard. They started out slow, Jen whispering encouragement the whole time. After a few minutes they began to pick up the pace. Emily&#39;s shorter limbs and lack of experience meant that she couldn&#39;t hope to keep up with Jen at her top speed, but Jen kept her own pace slow so she could stay by her sister&#39;s side. When she thought that Emily was finally beginning to shake off her negative feelings Jen introduced her to the rope toy. She showed Emily how to toss it around with her teeth, just like a dog would, then she grabbed the other end in her own and gave a few tugs. It took a few tries, but the young teen soon got the hang of it. She was genuinely smiling by the time they were all called in for afternoon class.</p>
