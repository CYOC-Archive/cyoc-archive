<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Tyler gulped when his hand brushed past the handsome hunk&#39;s hairline, to feel a subtle bump protruding out of his forehead. He bolts upright and peers over Hank&#39;s shoulder to see the start of a bony protrusion coming out of the other man&#39;s forehead. They didn&#39;t push through the skin, not yet, but they were clearly visible in the morning light.<br />
<br />
The Bull&#39;s sudden movements must&#39;ve jostled the bed, because Hank began to wake. The hunky rugby player&#39;s eyes flitted open and he smiled as he took in the sight of the biggest, strongest, hairiest guy on campus, and hopefully, his new boyfriend. They had gone at it like wild animals last night and Hank felt full of energy, like he had a bull of his own raging through his veins. He usually worked out in the afternoons after class, but he felt like he could spend the whole day there!<br />
<br />
Hank leaned up and grasped at the back of his Bull&#39;s neck, coaxing the giant bodybuilder-sized football star to lie back down. He reached down and played with Tyler&#39;s sheath, the opening already pooling with the hirsute hulk&#39;s pre-seed. Tyler&#39;s massive bull-cock springs out between the two studs, planting itself firmly between Hank&#39;s developed pecs and Tyler&#39;s even heavier pair of pectorals.<br />
<br />
Hank looked at Tyler, a little perplexed at the way the handsome, musclebound freak was looking back at him, his gaze fixed somewhere above Hank&#39;s eye-level. &quot;Something wrong, sexy?&quot; Hank chuckled, expecting the Bull&#39;s expression to soften, but no such thing happened. Hank&#39;s jovial demeanor fell and he slowly, almost terrified, brought his hand up to where Tyler was looking, the big bull of a football player cringing as his hand reached higher and higher...<br />
<br />
&quot;What the...&quot; Hank coughed as he felt something sticking out of his skull. &quot;What the FUCK?!&quot; he roared as he grasped at the nubs growing out of his forehead. He pushed the Bull off of him and bolted to the ensuite bathroom. When he saw what was growing on his head, he let out a scream that the entire dorm could hear, maybe even the people in the next dorm building could hear too.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you d-YOUUOUOUO to me?&quot; Hank bellowed. The hunky rugby player covered his mouth, scared of the sound he made, like a deep bull&#39;s moo. &quot;Oh my god, you&#39;re turning me into a freak!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;H-Hank,&quot; Tyler said sheepishly, taking a step forward, his arms open, trying to pull Hank into a hug.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, s-stay away from me!&quot; Hank cried, holding his arms out to keep Tyler at bay. The rugby player dashed to his clothes and bolted out the door, covering his crotch with his briefs and his new horns with his shirt. Tyler ran out, the whole floor shaking with his thuds. Heads peeked out of their doors, watching a naked hunk running to the elevator. Tyler wanted to chase him, but his enormous bull-cock was still hard.<br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
Tyler&#39;s day was miserable. He barely paid attention to the subjects in his classes. He ate, grazed, at his lunch, piling on more and more food as he sighed, thinking of his &#39;one.&#39; He had lucked out, the curse that was passed onto him giving him the man of his dreams as the one he&#39;d be bonded to for life. He idly daydreamed of Hank throughout the rest of the day... It was when he went to the gym to workout that it him... He was aroused... more than aroused, he was horny. Yet his cock was completely flaccid. The terror began to take hold of the big Bull once more, the dull ache in his balls coming back. Without his &#39;one,&#39; he wouldn&#39;t be able to release.<br />
<br />
Tyler powered, snorted and growled through his workout, pushing the weights around, half in frustration and half in a desperate need to get his mind off the beautiful man that haunted his every waking moment. His pump was insane, his muscles engorged with blood. Before he knew it, several hours had passed by, the evening crowd dissipating. Tyler didn&#39;t even realize that people all around him were staring at the way his bloated muscles strained at his a-shirt and shorts. It wasn&#39;t until late, maybe after 8PM, that his cock began to fidget.<br />
<br />
Tyler&#39;s eyes lit up... he just felt a jolt in his loins. &quot;Hank,&quot; he grunted under his breath. Like a wild animal, his eyes darted around, looking for his &#39;one.&#39; He needed him. Tyler stood up, his back taking up more space than ever before, the beast having put on a couple pounds since this morning, fueled by rage and passion to grow, desperate to be reunited with his &#39;one.&#39; But with his severe pump, he looked even heavier, his arms, legs and pecs so full of blood he waddled with his arms stuck out at an angle, bending his joints a chore.<br />
<br />
Tyler saw him. Hank wore a big hoodie and a ballcap over his head. The hunky rugby player looked around and froze when he saw the swollen bull looking right back at him. Tyler stomped his way over, sweat pouring off the great beast.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hank, please,&quot; Tyler said with a hushed tone. &quot;I&#39;m sorry.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just stay out of my way, Tyler,&quot; Hank said with a pained expression.<br />
<br />
&quot;I need you,&quot; the great big bull whined.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just... look at what you&#39;ve done to me,&quot; Hank hissed. He pulled the hoodie up and over his head before taking off his ballcap. The nubs were still there, though, it didn&#39;t look like they had grown anymore, the flesh still covering them.<br />
<br />
Tyler&#39;s huge chest heaved as he breathed in heavily. &quot;I&#39;m sorry, okay. I never meant for that to happen!&quot; Uncontrollably, Tyler&#39;s cock was about to make things inextricably worse. It popped out, and punched Hank in the abs. The rugby player stepped back and gulped, gawking at the circular shaped pre-cum stain on his hoodie.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shit!&quot; Hank swore, swiping at the slimy mess that Tyler had made. The rugby player huffed and stormed out of the gym, back to the changing room. Tyler whimpered and slipped his huge cock into his shirt before chasing after him.<br />
<br />
The big bull bowls his way into the men&#39;s changing room and sees Hank peeling off his hoodie, revealing his muscular body. The big beast winces as he can feel his balls roiling with seed. Tyler huffs and leans against the lockers, his hands moving down to play with his oversized bull-junk.<br />
<br />
As Hank gets his head out of his hoodie, he sees the big beast stroking himself. &quot;You fucker, I said leave me alone.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t,&quot; Tyler whimpered in response, a puppy-like look on his face, enough to melt even the hardest of hearts. Hank sighs, groaning to himself. He couldn&#39;t help but look at the big guy and feel sorry for him.<br />
<br />
Hank knew he&#39;d regret this, but he took off his shorts and let his own respectably big dong hang loose, beads of pre-seed dribbling out of his hardening shaft. The innocent, happy look that overcame the hulking bull-boy  almost made Hank swoon. Tyler followed suit, pulling his shorts down and then struggled to get his shirt off.<br />
<br />
Hank shook his head and helped the overgrown freak. He held his breath, soaking in the sheer magnificence of Tyler&#39;s overly built body, every muscle screaming red with an extreme pump. For Tyler, Hank&#39;s mere touch was electrifying. He&#39;d been denied release for almost a whole day, and his overproductive bull-balls were aching for release.<br />
<br />
And release they did. As soon as Hank got Tyler&#39;s shirt off, the Bull&#39;s cum-factories pulled up and unleashed a huge load coating the two hunks.</p>
