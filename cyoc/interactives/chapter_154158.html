<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Feeling a rumble in her stomach, Charley braced herself, unsure if she was going to grow larger or not. To her relief, a small burp escaped her mouth, taking Marcus and Daniel off guard. “Excuse me,” said Charley. Relaxed, the giant woman noticed the fire escape balcony next to her appeared to be moving upward. Looking down, she found herself slowly shrinking toward the ground. While Daniel and Marcus watched in awe, Charley looked over to find the two thieves were also shrinking. As she approached half her previous height, Marcus had run over to his squad vehicle to fetch some blankets for the three women. Once they were small enough, Daniel was in the process of restraining the blonde thief with zip-ties. She remained unconscious while her accomplice was having her rights spoken to her by Officer Daniel. Charley’s diminishment ended just as Marcus arrive to wrap a blanket around her. He still looked at Charley in amazement much to her confusion until she stood. That is when she realized she was standing taller than her original height.<br />
<br />
Still having to look down at Marcus, who was just under six feet, she had to guess she now stood just over eight feet tall, possibly nine. Another aspect of herself she observed is how physically stronger she appeared. Raising her left arm, she flexed her bicep, which formed into a solid bulge of mass. Lastly, and much to her surprise, her breasts had grown to roughly the size and shape of watermelons. Yet she felt no weight from them, presumably due to her increased strength.<br />
<br />
“I guess this isn’t all bad,” said Charley, admiring her new form. She looked to Marcus once more to find his mouth agape. She instinctually returned to her modest demeaner and wrapped the blanket around herself. Looking back toward the suspects, they, too, appear to be similarly enhanced following their recent size change. Not to the same degree as Charley, but she made sure to remain on her guard as the other officers readied them for pickup. Charley had not noticed the sizable crowd watching from outside the alleyway, which led to her feeling more self-conscious about her predicament. It would not shock her if a few people had recorded the entire encounter on their phones.<br />
<br />
Sometime later, Charley was waiting from within her captain’s office. Her fellow officers provided Charley with the largest sweats available, and even then, they were too small on her amazon form. She looked as an adult would while wearing kid’s clothes. Given her large size, she dared not to sit on any piece of furniture for fear of destroying them and opted to sit on the floor. The blinds had been closed to help Charley feel less like a sideshow freak. The door opened and Captain Linsey Miller walked in, accompanied by a petite Asian woman with short hair, who carried a large, silver case.<br />
<br />
“Captain,” Charley said addressing her supervisor.<br />
<br />
“Officer Charlene,” started Captain Miller. “This is Dr. Abigail Matsuoka. She’s on loan from our benevolent government and is here to provide you with some appropriate attire for you current… state.”<br />
<br />
“I just hope it fits, doctor.”<br />
<br />
“Not only will it fit,” said the petite woman as she laid the case on the floor. “It’s specially made material designed to stretch and conform to any figure.”<br />
<br />
“Like spandex or something?” asked Charley.<br />
<br />
“Sure, we’ll go with that.” Dr. Matsuoka unlocked the case and opened it to reveal a navy-blue pile of clothing. “If you don’t mind putting this on.”<br />
<br />
With a heavy sigh, Charley did as she was told and proceeded to disrobe. Which took little effort as she simply tore the clothing off her body like it was paper. Her captain stared at her disapprovingly. “What?” asked Charley. “I nearly tore them as I dressed myself.” As she began to redress herself, Charley saw that Dr. Matsuoka did not appear phased by her presence. “I take it this isn’t anything new for you, doctor?”<br />
“Considering you and several other civilians have ingested my life’s work, no, Officer Charlene,” said the doctor bluntly. “And while I was able to reverse the effects done to those affected, your situation is different.”<br />
<br />
“You mean I’ll be stuck this way?”<br />
<br />
“I believe so, yes. Not only that, but your physiology bonded with the mutagen in such a way that any attempt to undo it will likely kill you in the process.”<br />
<br />
“How did your little science project wind up in a diner?”<br />
<br />
Dr. Matsuoka let out a long sigh before answering. “Human error in shipping and handling, believe it or not.”<br />
<br />
“I believe it,” said Captain Miller. She sat on the edge of her desk during this exchange. “I must have had five or six packages show up to my address when they were meant to go twelve doors down the street.”<br />
<br />
Charley finished dressing herself and looked at her reflection in the window. Both short-sleeve top and long bottom fit her like a glove and left little to the imagination regarding her privates. Looking back toward her supervisor, she then asked, “So what now, captain?”<br />
<br />
“Now, Dr. Matsuoka will be overseeing your development for the foreseeable future as you adjust to this new lifestyle. Hopefully, God willing, you are let go and allowed to return. Although, I need to meet with the chief and the mayor about what to do with you.”<br />
<br />
“I don’t mind being benched until then,” said Charley. “But what’s this about my ‘development’? Am I going to sprout new arms or something?”<br />
<br />
Fighting back a smirk, Dr. Matsuoka responded. “We can talk more about my ‘science project’ once we arrive at my facility out of the city.”<br />
<br />
“Will I be allowed to pass by my apartment for some personal affects?”<br />
<br />
“We’ve already taken the liberty of acquiring your things, though clothing will be out of the question,” said Dr. Matsuoka.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know. I bet that bikini I bought a year ago will look amazing on this new bod.&quot;</p>
