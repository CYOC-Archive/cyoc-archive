<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Cassie rocked back and forth on her new bed. Little more than a few pieces of wood and a handmade blanket. Not that she needed it, the <br />
tropical heat made it warm even at night. <br />
<br />
For everyone being three years old, and Kiki's advertisement that they all played all day, Cassie had seen some of the cub tribe sowing, <br />
building, and carpeting. <br />
<br />
&quot;And they were all smiling, they're all happy.&quot; <br />
<br />
It had all happened so fast, it was all a blur. She didn't know if it was shock or some sense of passiveness, but she had along with the flow <br />
without a peep of complaint. <br />
<br />
They had stripped her naked, now just past a toddler's form with nothing to show. And had given her the same leaf-dress the other girls <br />
wore that was nothing more than a vine and a series of leaves sticked through it She had put it on without question. <br />
<br />
She watched again not questioning as they took her clothes and put them onto a pile of straw and Mo handed her a lit torch.<br />
<br />
&quot;Welcome to our family sister.&quot; Mo said proudly as Kiki gave her a slight push foreword. Like she was walking in a dream Cassie (as she <br />
couldn't resist thinking of herself now) had set her own clothes on fire, and had joined in the cheering and 'whaos' as they caught flame and <br />
burned to cinder. <br />
<br />
Finally alone, Cassie had time with her own thoughts. The cub tribe had worked with the team work and diligence of worker ants as they had <br />
constructed a small hut for her, bare of anything except the bed. <br />
<br />
&quot;What did I let them do that?&quot; Cassie asked herself. She thought of Cassie's Little Sister back on the shore with the beacon still going. &quot;Is <br />
anyone going to find this island? Won't they search the island for me when they find the boat but not me? But how could this island not be on <br />
any charts? I just went out for a single person pleasure cruise on my own little ship! But a mountain like this island has should be visible <br />
from the mainland!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You aren't going to figure out sis'. I tried, and so did Mo, but we couldn't figure it out. Eventually we decided the gods themselves must <br />
have created this place for us. Many of us have figured out maybe we're all dead and this is Paradise.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cassie turned her head, seeing the half naked bare footed wild child. Her tail flicked back and forth. Sat up from the bed. 'It didn't hit me <br />
until now that they're all, we're all the same size. Even the boys and girls.'  &quot;You were listening in?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You're new sis, new borns have done some silly things. When I first came here, I left the village and tried to swim out to somewhere, but I <br />
only ended up back at the island. I hide for a long time and made a raft then. I sailed in one direction, thinking I'd find home, but I came <br />
back here. I finally decided this life was better than being a slave.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Slave?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The tribe my people had a war with sold me and my brothers to foreigners as slaves. Seeing my brothers slowly starving to death, being <br />
crushed so tight with so many other, and many others dead . . . I decided I'd rather die. So when I got a chance, I managed to jump ship and <br />
swam . . . when I almost sank, I washed up here.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cassie stared at her, Kiki had orange hair and tanned skin, but Cassie realized, so did Cassie. It struck Cassie her own hair had turned white <br />
without her noticing. Not old age white, but a strange pearly white.<br />
<br />
Cassie's head was swimming more from what Kiki had told her however. &quot;Kiki, how long have you been here?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A really really really long time. Since none of us grow older, and the 'season' as Mo describes them never changes, we really don't have a <br />
need to keep track of time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What about birthdays?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We don't grow older or bigger, we realized a long time ago they were . . . meaningless.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What . .  what about Mo?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He and his friends say they were 'Vikings' searching for a new land . . . they got lost from the rest of their fleet and ended up here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And they turned into Cubs when they drank that coconut drink?&quot;<br />
<br />
Kiki laughed and clapped her hands, &quot;Oh no! That happened on its own! Something about this island -causes- it to happen. The 'trigger' <br />
seems to be different for all of us. I became a cub when I washed myself when I first came here.&quot; <br />
<br />
Cassie just nodded. &quot;So anyone who comes here can't leave? What about becoming how you used to be?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why would we want that? Why would I want that? We're a family. We'd never want to separated from each other.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I have a -family- that's worried about me by now!&quot;<br />
<br />
Kiki slowly and sadly shook her head, &quot;So did Mo. I did too. So did almost all of us. You can cry if you want Cassie. Most of us do. There two <br />
of our tribe here that were very very 'rich' apparently and liked that. Apparently they were married before. They were very unhappy about <br />
being stuck here at first. But they accepted it. We all do in the end.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But . . .   but . . . but how can you all be so HAPPY? If everything just stays the same except for new arrivals?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's funny, the island seems to get just a tiny bit bigger whenever new arrivals come. This place -wants- us to be happy, even if we can't <br />
leave. The jungle seems to be always changing, along with the mountain, there's always something new to explore. And the mountain always <br />
seems to be bigger on the inside than the outside. And . . .there's something that makes it all very easy for us all to be happy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What's that?&quot; Cassie asked rather confounded.<br />
<br />
&quot;We have each other.&quot; Kiki hugged her. <br />
<br />
Cassie shuddered, feeling doubts and fears melt from her now three year old brain, thoughts of playing, exploring, or just sitting and <br />
thinking filled her mind to the brim. She grinned. It would be so much fun. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hold on!&quot; Cassie said suddenly.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; Kiki asked, the concern clear as crystal for Cassie both in her voice and three year old face.<br />
<br />
&quot;I left the beacon on in my ship! They'll bring others here!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Cool! New arrivals are always fun!&quot;<br />
<br />
Cassie's head swam. Yes, new arrivals, are always fun.</p>
