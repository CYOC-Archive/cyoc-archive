<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Alright, Dan, I'll tell you what, since it is a bit unfair to make <br />
you horny with now place for you to stick your nose, I will give you a <br />
place to stick it.  Now pick a letter,&quot; Dylan ordered.<br />
<br />
&quot;A letter?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You know A to Z?  Pick a letter,&quot; Dylan ordered.<br />
<br />
Dan had no idea what Dylan had in mind, but he was so horny. He <br />
glanced at Elaine and decided against E, he almost said D for Dan, but <br />
he could imagine Dylan elongating his body, so that with a penis on <br />
his face he could in fact fuck his own ass. He knew Michelle was a hot <br />
chick, and Dylan knew her too, so he said, &quot;M?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;M it is, Dan,&quot; Dylan said picking up Dan's cell phone and scrolling <br />
through the address book. &quot;Ah, Mark A., Mark C., Mark N., Max, Maxine, <br />
Maxy, Michael, Michelle... my, my quite a lot of M's. We'll start with <br />
Mark A.&quot; He pushed the dial button after plugging a jack from the <br />
Chronivac into the phone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mark Addams?  But what has he done to you?&quot; asked Dan.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, nothing yet, I'm just calling him.  Depending on his answers, we <br />
may move on to Mark C. and maybe we'll work our way down to Michelle,&quot; <br />
Dylan said watching Dan's tail start to wag at the mention of <br />
Michelle.<br />
<br />
Elaine and Dan listened to Dylan's one sided conversation.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello? Is this Mark Addams?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, you're a friend of Dan right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, I'm calling you on his phone.  No, he's not himself at the <br />
moment. So I don't think he'll be able to come into work.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, Dan's staying at Elaine's, ah, yes that Elaine.  Could you <br />
bring those files by tonight?  I'm sure he'll be able to work on them <br />
tomorrow.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dylan whined uncertainly. Elaine just trembled confused as to what <br />
Dylan had in mind.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you, 6 PM will be fine.  I'll let Dan know. Good bye.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You'll let Dan know what?&quot; Dan said panting with precum dripping from <br />
his dick nose.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, in just over an hour and fifteen minutes, Mark Addams from your <br />
work will be by with some files for you to work on. Mark's stats came <br />
through over the cellphone jack - man, I love smart phones.  If he <br />
didn't have a smart phone it wouldn't have worked. Now he's got a <br />
Chronivac app on his iPhone that I control remotely. He was quite a <br />
stud.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Was?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, he still is, but he's going to change at 6:01 PM tonight.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, please.  Mark's a nice guy, he doesn't deserve whatever you have <br />
planned for him,&quot; Dylan pleaded in a nasally voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess your cock is using mucous instead of semen,&quot; laughed Dylan, <br />
&quot;Since I don't think you'll be turning your attentions to Elaine, I <br />
think maybe I'll connect your balls and prostate to your sinuses. Heh, <br />
heh,&quot; chuckled Dylan.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, honey, I can see you punishing me and Dan, but really involving <br />
strangers?&quot; she said in a concerned voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, come now. He cannot be a total stranger.  He knows about you and <br />
Dan, and he knows where you live.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh?&quot; Elaine turned and looked at Dylan.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry, Elaine, Mark's my workout buddy, and I kind of told him all <br />
about you. He's dropped me off here a few times. You remember when my <br />
car was in the shop, and you met him at the office party. I introduced <br />
him as Mr. Addams - he's actually my supervisor,&quot; Dan fessed up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aw, well here's the bad news, Dylan.  Mark's profile shows he's 65% <br />
gay, and 35% straight, and when I mentioned you, his heart rate <br />
increased.  I'd say he's got it bad for you. I'm leaving him male, but  <br />
making some other changes.  His ratio will be 99% gay 1% straight, and <br />
he'll be versatile, which means he'll expect to fuck your ass or at <br />
least get a bj from you.  Oh, and his awareness will be altered.  <br />
He'll just accept everything he sees and hears here as normal.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Normal, I've got the body of dog with a 14 inch cock where my nose <br />
should be, and he'll think that's normal?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, yes, but I don't want you and Elaine coming up with any bright <br />
ideas before he gets here, so...&quot; he said hitting the execute key.<br />
<br />
Elaine and Dan both yawned and lay down where they stood. They'd be <br />
hibernating for an hour and fifteen minutes.  In silence, Dylan <br />
returned to fine tuning the new Mark Addams profile, and chuckled <br />
again as he watched Dan's erect nose shrink as it became flaccid. He <br />
typed into Dan's profile and a new foreskin appeared on Dan's cock. <br />
The sheath fold over his glans and it gave Dan's face an elephantine <br />
appearance. &quot;Maybe I'll make your ears more dumbo-esque too,&quot; said <br />
Dylan, &quot;Maybe later. First things first. Mark's make over must be <br />
perfect, so no one at work notices my improvements.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dylan packed up the Chronivac, after first typing in subroutine <br />
command that would immediately induce hibernation in Dan, Elaine or <br />
Mark if any of them got within 24 inches of the Chronivac. He then <br />
stowed the Chronivac in a cupboard, and went upstairs to get a drink.<br />
<br />
At 5:45 PM the door bell rang.  Dylan cursed under his breath that <br />
Mark was unfashionably early. Now he needed to occupy him for 15 <br />
minutes before escorting him down to the basement where Dan and Elaine <br />
slept peacefully.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello, you must be Mark,&quot; Dylan said opening the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, I'm sorry to hear Dan is under the weather.  Is it flu or <br />
something else?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You might say it is an STD, he got it from fucking Elaine,&quot; Dylan <br />
said testily. He could see Mark was taken aback, and he laughed, &quot;Just <br />
joking. Would you like a drink?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I don't have that much time.  Here are the files,&quot; Mark said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, come on. Just one drink?  I don't get to use my bartending skills <br />
that often. I worked my way through college as a bartender. So how <br />
about it?  Whiskey sour? Manhattan? Appletini?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A Manhattan sounds good, but just one,&quot; Mark said stepping in and <br />
following Dylan over to the bar.<br />
<br />
Dylan grinned and prepared the drinks tossing the mixer in the air <br />
like Tom Cruise did in that old 80's movie. Two minutes later, Mark <br />
was sipping the Manhattan that Dylan had made him.<br />
<br />
&quot;So how's your sister doing?&quot; Mark asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;My sister?&quot; Dylan asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, Elaine. She is your sister isn't she?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, no, far from it. What exactly is your relationship with Dan, <br />
Mark?  You seem far too attentive to be just a colleague.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, Dan's my workout buddy at Gold's Gym. We've been working out for <br />
over five years now. When I heard he was looking for a job, I told him <br />
there was one at my company.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, and you hired him.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, yes.  He's a good worker, and nice guy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you think of Elaine?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She seemed lovely when I met her at the Christmas Party.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Indeed?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Is there a problem?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not any longer.  Come with me, I think you'll find that you'll like <br />
the changes Dan has undergone since you saw him last.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Changes? I thought he was ill?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, his nose is stuffed up, but I think you'll help him drain his <br />
sinuses.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm not a doctor. This whole thing seems a bit out of-oh,&quot; Mark said <br />
with a start.<br />
<br />
&quot;Six Oh One PM,&quot; Dylan said tapping his watch, &quot;Come along, Marky. <br />
You've got a date in the basement with Dan.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mark was licking his lips and staring at Dylan's ass as he followed <br />
him downstairs.<br />
<br />
Elaine and Dan were just waking up. They yawned and stretched as Dylan <br />
and Mark entered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dan!&quot; Mark exclaimed running over to the dog man of his dreams.<br />
<br />
Dylan just chuckled, and hit record on the remote for the video camera <br />
that was mounted on a tripod focused on Dan.</p>
