<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Benton headed back to his estate after the press conference. Not wanting to risk having something happen to his precious Lamborghini Veneno; He decides to head back to the hospital in a different car. While his wife’s BMW was totaled in her accident last night, Benton noticed the town car that John would drive parked by the side entrance. Deciding that he would rather risk the town car getting keyed or worse at the hospital; Benton chooses to use that as his vehicle. Heading inside to grab a few items for what could be an overnight stay in the hospital; Benton walks into the kitchen and realizes that he hasn’t eaten since Frieda made breakfast. Starving he opens the fridge door looking for something to eat; seeing nothing but wilted lettuce and condiments, Benton slams the fridge shut.<br />
“Great,” Benton talking to himself; ”Now I have to shop for food; how pedestrian.”<br />
 <br />
Benton decides to deal with that later and heads to hospital. Jumping into the town car; he drives off. While the town car didn’t need fuel; Benton however was hungry. Pulling into a gas station he goes inside and grabs a convenience store hotdog of questionable freshness as well as a bottle of soda. Paying for it all, Benton eats the hotdog quickly; clearly not enjoying the taste, he tries to wash it out with the soda. Not liking the quick meal, Benton gets back in the town car and continues driving to the hospital.<br />
<br />
*****<br />
<br />
Benton is with his wife Amanda as she recovers from her injuries. After finishing her treatment for hook worm infection; the reason for her passing out while behind the wheel, her condition stabilized enough to have her moved from the ICU unit to another room. The good news was this room was closer to the visitor’s entrance; the bad news Amanda was restricted to an I.V. drip and jell-o for sustenance. Despite her heightened ability to heal for being a were; Doctor Tora wasn’t going to allow solid food for at least another two days. Benton just had to put up with Amanda’s venting for the time being.<br />
<br />
“The gall of these,” Amanda huffs; “these people to say I’m not allowed to eat.”<br />
“Amanda,” Benton sighing; “you must remember. You are a patient; you must allow them to do their jobs.”<br />
“It wouldn’t kill them to get me toast and coffee,” Amanda glares.<br />
“What’s next,” Doctor Tora entering the room; “Fluff my pillow? Get me a manicurist?” Tora Tachibana looking at Amanda, “I told you before; the nurses are not your personal servants. You are not the only person they are charged with caring for.”<br />
Amada just keeps glaring; looking around she doesn’t she her daughter anywhere. “Benton, where is Frieda?”<br />
“She is with her friends,” Benton remembering the text she sent him earlier; “But she promises to call later.”<br />
Amanda getting further irritated as doctor Tora continues his examination; she barks at him, “Are you done with your prod and probe? I’m awake and I’m lucid. What more do you need?”<br />
“Amanda I’m not a big fan of doctors either,” Benton sighs; “but even I know better than to snap at them for doing their job.”<br />
“Ha!” Amanda retorts; “If that was the case you wouldn’t have punched Jeffery and we would still have servants at our house.”<br />
<br />
Doctor Tora doing his best not to listen in on the Knight’s problems tries to do his best to leave but is stopped; not by Amanda but by Benton.<br />
“Doctor Tora, is there something that Amanda can safely eat,” Benton asking; “Like soup or perhaps oatmeal? I’m sure my wife will be in a far better mood then having to settle for jiggly goop in a cup.”<br />
“Not for at least another two days,” Doctor Tora answers; “Hospital policy.”<br />
“Then buckle up doctor,” Amanda growling; “I’m going to be one surly patient.”<br />
Doctor Tora grins, “The nurses dealt with worse. But don’t be surprised if they ignore you as you keep pressing the nurse call button.” Looking at Benton; “let me know when you are ready to begin testing for Bi-polar disorder.”<br />
<br />
Benton nods as doctor Tora leaves the room. Turning around to see an angry wife; Benton tries to choose his next words carefully.<br />
“Frieda told me about a little note book detailing grievances and accusations from the staff. She said she gave it to you.”<br />
“Did she also tell you that John and Ethel are getting married today,” Amanda handing Benton the notebook.<br />
“Yes. She also said,” Benton looking over the notebook; “It would be a good show of faith to change if we offered them some form of congratulations.”<br />
“Smart girl, your daughter is Benton.” Both Amanda and Benton look up to see Lance at the door; Amanda pursing her lips in anticipation to an inevitable fight between two brothers; a fight that never comes.<br />
<br />
Benton and Lance spend a few tense minutes staring each other down. Benton who usually goes thermonuclear when his younger brother is in the same room as him, is surprisingly calm; Lance notices this and takes a seat closest to the door. Neither Knight taking their eyes off each other. Amanda getting tired of this speaks up.<br />
“If you two intend to fight, then take it outside!”<br />
“Amanda,” Benton still looking at his brother; “I asked Lance to come over here.”<br />
Amanda looks like she swallowed a bug. Lance seeing her shocked impression responds; “Yeah I was surprised to, when Benton contacted me.”<br />
“Alright,” Benton doing his best to remain calm; “I’m sure you know why you’re here, Lance.”<br />
“I have an ideal,” Lance answers; “Frieda did give me a rundown with your out of left field decision to get some medical tests done for bi-polar disorder. What she wasn’t able to tell me was why you chose to agree without so much as being asked by the two of you.”<br />
“It’s what Doctor Tora showed me,” Benton recalling the site of the feral were’s locked up in the hospital’s sub-basement; “Let’s just say it was un-nerving.”<br />
“Fair enough,” Lance answering; “but you do realize that as the temporary were-panther representative of the elder council I must tell you that whatever the results of the test might reveal, I will have to inform them. You are effectively on their radar. All of them are quite concerned that you could expose our existence to the world.”<br />
<br />
Benton is silent for the moment. “We can deal with that later,” Benton states; “but first, where is Frieda?”<br />
“With her friends,” Lance remembering what Frieda said earlier; “Suffice to say, she intends to stay the night with them.” Lance pausing before deciding to add the nail to this topic; “she also said that if you tried to give me grief regarding this, for you to ‘shut up and shove it’. Her words not mine.”<br />
Benton sighs; not in the mood to get into an argument right now grabs his briefcase and pulls out a large envelope and hands it to Lance.<br />
“What’s this,” Lance looking at the envelope.<br />
“A just in case thing,” Benton looking serious; “Look, just keep it safe for the time being.”<br />
<br />
Lance opening up the envelope is surprised at what he sees. Looking up at Benton; “why give this to me? Why not Amanda?”<br />
“It has to be a Knight by blood. Not by marriage,” Benton looking thoughtful; “that’s why I want you to look after it in case I’m unable to for various reasons.”<br />
“What,” Amanda; “Getting involved; “what is this about you two?”<br />
“See for yourself,” Lance hands the documents to Amanda.”<br />
“It’s a living trust fund,” Amanda looking confused; “why are you so concerned out over this.”<br />
“Read further,” Lance states; “Names me the executor of the trust instead of you.”<br />
“Oh I see,” Amanda putting down the document; “still she can’t access it until she is eighteen. I don’t see what the problem is.” Amanda signing the witness line on the document.<br />
“Fine then,” Lance getting up to grab the papers. He signs the documents and hands them back to Benton; “If that’s all, I have a diner date with a rather lovely looking were-tigress.”<br />
“Just bring Frieda here in the morning,” Benton taking the documents, signing them and handing them back to Lance; “I’m sure she would like to know what the results of my tests are as well as see how Amanda is.”<br />
“Have her bring coffee as well,” Amanda demands; “It would certainly improve my mood greatly.”</p>
