<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Sheriff Cooper was clearly in a grumpy mood. With a week as brutal as the one he had to deal with; it’s a surprise that he hadn’t decided to leave his badge and gun on the desk and tell the town itself to find someone else to do the job.<br />
<br />
First he had to deal with an alcoholic were that committed auto theft. While Cathy Shafer did bring her ills upon herself; having to inform her son John Jr. about his father and his legacy was something he was hoping to wait until the kid graduated high school. Telling a fourteen year old six foot werewolf that we he will be filthy rich when eighteen was a highlight. However the rest of the week was all downhill afterwards.<br />
<br />
Investigating a possible statue 1A violation; a were turning a normal against their will. Having to arrest Julie Stovall for assaulting Eric Anderson and Frieda Knight on a Tuesday. Finding his cousin has been harassing the Stovall’s; even having to physically drag her away from their house. That was a Wednesday he’ll never forget.<br />
<br />
Thursday was a treat that could not be beat. Having to head over to Tachibana’s head office. To see Daisuke with a katana in hand keeping a very mad and nearly naked Benton Knight from continuing his assault on the employees. That scene did bring a smile to his face; but knowing that he had shifted into his were-panther form meant that to charge Benton would risk exposing the town’s secret. So instead he just escorted Benton back to his estate and let the were-council deal with him in their own way.<br />
<br />
And now today; Friday. His morning started with and Anonymous email informing him that his cousin Alyssa Cooper was seen picking up a fourteen year old were-otter by the name of Brian walker from school. Not once, not twice, but thrice.  While he suspected Julie Stovall was the author of said email; running a search warrant on her computer turned up nothing. And now he gets a report of a suspicious vehicle and woman prowling about the Anderson home. It’s clearly not Sheriff Cooper’s week.<br />
<br />
Looking at the three sitting before him; the sheriff knew none were and agent of Benton Knight; despite Frances Twists suspicions. While Sheriff Cooper did not recognize the chauffeur from the town car; he did know the man as Jack Crawford; A wealthy playboy currently living in Seattle. While the sheriff and Jack never traveled in the same social circles; Sheriff Copper did regularly read the Seattle Times. And then there is the striking woman sitting next to him in a red dress. Sheriff Cooper knew her well. Kenya Adaeze.<br />
<br />
Sheriff Cooper knew Kenya was an escort for were-clients; he did see pictures of her with various individuals in the society pages as the “date” for the evening. What confused him was why she was seen peeking into the windows of the Anderson house hold earlier. Trying to question each of them; all remained silent. Except for Jack Crawford; all he said was ‘give me my phone call so I can contact my Moon Lake lawyer’.<br />
<br />
That was twenty minutes ago. While the sheriff at best; could charge Kenya with trespassing at the Anderson house. The voyeurism maybe; but that would be a stretch. But since no one was home at the time and the only person who witnessed to whole event was the next door neighbor; Sheriff Cooper knew that the lawyer Jack called would get them off and released shortly.<br />
<br />
Sheriff Cooper just sat on the other side of the table; popping aspirin as if they were tic-tacs. Jack Crawford’s lawyer comes in and all get up to leave. The Sheriff is sure something is up and knows that his plans for a peaceful Saturday and Sunday fishing are going to be shot to hell. He heads backs to his office and sighs “as if I don’t have enough to deal with.” Sitting down he goes back to his paperwork for the day.<br />
<br />
****<br />
<br />
Kenya was waiting by the front doors of the police station. The only thing on her mind is finding Nate Anderson. She looks at Jack and her lawyer having a heated conversation; despite being a were, Kenya couldn’t hear a word they were saying. Yet she sees Jack Crawford’s face run cold. It was clear that something happened; with the lawyer giving Jack a consoling tap on the shoulder, Jack heads out of the station and back to the town car with his chauffeur waiting already.<br />
<br />
Kenya close behind gets in and all three drive off.<br />
“Jack what’s wrong?” Kenya asks.<br />
“You picked a bad time to come to town to talk to Nate,” Jack answers; “My lawyer told me that yesterday there was a big row at Tachibana’s office involving Benton Knight. Suffice to say the town is on edge and the were-council are on full alert.” Looking at Kenya, “Also the mayor’s daughter is facing assault charges for attacking Eric Anderson and Frieda Knight.”<br />
<br />
“So?” Kenya responds; “What does that have to do with us?”<br />
“Nothing,” Jack answers; “and it’s going to stay that way.” Placing a hand on Kenya’s arm, “I know you have your reason for wanting closure with Nate, so I’ll have my driver drop you back to your place. But I am heading back to Seattle. I do not want to be in the cross hairs of Benton. When you’re done here, call me. I’ll have my chauffeur come back to pick you up.”<br />
<br />
Kenya looks disappointed that Jack is not going to stick around. But still she does understand that there is bad blood between his family and Benton. She gives him a kiss and hopes out of the town car. Looking at Jack; “When I get back to your condo; bed, naked and nothing else” Kenya states.<br />
Jack just smiles and nods approvingly. Kenya closes the door and sees the Town Car drive off. She opens up her door and heads inside. Seeing no messages on her machine she heads to the shower to freshen up. For tonight she intends to hang out at the place she and Nate first met and wait until he shows.</p>
