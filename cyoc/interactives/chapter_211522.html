<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Finally!” Carson cheered, holding up his small remote with pride, “I’ve finished it… the Remote of Control,” he stated. He looked at it’s interface. Simple, yet sophisticated. He inputted his name:<br />
<br />
Carson Lovett<br />
<br />
Carson typed in his first prompt with a large grin on his face,<br />
‘Carson’s penis grows from 3 inches to 8 inches’<br />
He pressed enter and unzipped his pants, pulling out his fairly small cock. It was already semi-hard, but got even harder as he watched it growing. It went from small, to average, to large! He held it with his hands, able to almost hold it with both. He was amazed. His remote worked! He was now the proud owner of a beast!<br />
<br />
Carson started jacking off with his new cock, remembering his ultimate plan with his device.<br />
Chiyoko Tanaka, a pretty Japanese girl from his Tech class who always treated him like another one of her friends. No one did that to him, everyone always called him a weirdo and a creep just because he walked into the girls changing room a couple times. Chiyoko was the only one who believed him when he said it was an accident. She was sweet, kind, loving, and so pretty! He’d do anything to make her his girlfriend. And since she rejected him a month ago, he created this remote to do just that. She was going to be his girlfriend, she just didn’t know she wanted to yet. Tomorrow, at school, he was going to make Chiyoko fall in love with him. She was gonna see his device and be so amazed that she’d let him do whatever he wanted to her with it, and despite how morally disgusting this whole situation was going to be, she was going to love every moment of it!<br />
And on his final thought, deciding that he didn’t care what everyone else would think, he came.<br />
<br />
—<br />
<br />
Carson double checked his bag, making sure that the remote was in there a final time. He pulled his pants up, struggling to fit his cock, despite being flaccid, in properly. He decided to get creative. Pulling the remote out of his bag, he typed:<br />
‘Carson’s cock is 4 inches flaccid 9 inches hard’<br />
He felt his long dick regressing in size, but began to get a little hard from the thought of it being an inch longer than yesterday.<br />
He pulled his pants up, pulled on his polo shirt, popped on his shoes, and headed out the door.<br />
<br />
—<br />
<br />
Carson looked around suspiciously, trying to find Chiyoko to speak to her before he changed her mind about things. Instead, he found one of Chiyoko’s friends, Nayomi. She looked his way in a disgusted fashion, judging him as she usually did. She looked back at her friends and spoke to them, then laughed. She had to be laughing at him, right? Why would she be talking about anything else.<br />
He got grumpy, pulled out the remote. Time for a test in the wild.<br />
‘Naomi Prada’<br />
He looked at her, once again catching her eyes. She looked at him with disgust, clearly wanting him to look away from her.<br />
‘Naomi can’t control herself and is compelled to start masturbating’<br />
<br />
As soon as Carson pressed enter, he saw Naomi’s expression change. She turned red, beginning to breathe heavier. Her hands flew to her crotch. She didn’t know what was going on. Her friends asked her if she was okay, and she something like ‘yeah yeah, I’m fine’. Before she could say much else, she really looked unable to function. She stumbled her way to the bathroom, trying her best to look normal as she did, failing.<br />
A grin appeared on Carson’s face, glad he taught that bitch a lesson.<br />
<br />
“Carson?” A voice asked. He jumped suddenly, hiding the remote behind his back. It was Chiyoko, greeting him as she usually did each morning,<br />
“H-hi Chiyoko!” He said. Clearly she was intrigued by the device he’d decided to hide behind his back,<br />
“New phone?” She asked, trying to sneak a peek at it,<br />
“It’s… um…” he stuttered. He gave in, revealing the remote to her. But to her surprise, it just said, ‘Television Remote; Select Channel’ on it,<br />
“Oh,” she said, not too surprised, “why bring it to school?” She asked,<br />
“It’s broken,” he said, “my mom wanted me to fix it,” he said, awkwardly laughing afterwards,<br />
“Interesting!” She replied, “I’d love to help, if you wouldn’t mind. You know how interested in technology I am,”<br />
“Yes please,” Carson said, eyes wide,<br />
“But please,” Chiyoko said, clarifying herself, “don’t assume this is a date again. I just wanna be your friend, Carson,” she said, smiling awkwardly,<br />
“I-I know…” Carson said through his teeth, “it’s not a date. We’re just gonna play with my remote thing I made, and it’s gonna be amazing,”<br />
“That’s not…” Chiyoko said, trying hard not to read too deep into his statement. She moved past the euphemism, “you made it?”<br />
“D-did I s-say that,” Carson stammered,<br />
“You did. That’s really impressive. I’m excited for you to explain it to me!” Chiyoko said. She looked at the bell on the wall, “I’m sorry Carson, I have to go find my friend Naomi… you haven’t seen her have you?”<br />
“No,” Carson replied bluntly, “she hates me anyway, so why would I see her,”<br />
“She doesn’t hate you,” Chiyoko assured, “she just hasn’t seen the side of you that I see,” she smiled, “I’ll see you in Tech, Carson,”<br />
“Yeah…” Carson finished as she walked away, looking for her friend.<br />
Carson switched off the ‘Hide’ mode on his remote, seeing his last input.<br />
“Ugh, only for Chiyoko,” he said to himself as he erased Naomi’s single command, but replaced it with:<br />
‘Naomi is very horny for the rest of the day, with hard nipples and constant dripping’<br />
<br />
Without watching for Naomi, he set the remote to ‘Hide’ mode and switched it off, slipping it into his bag. He made his way to his first (of many) boring classes.<br />
<br />
—<br />
<br />
Finally, his last class of the day. Tech!<br />
It was fairly boring. Being a genius has more than a few perks, but sitting through a class with a teacher telling you everything you already know. It can really suck the life out of you. But as quick as it started, it was over.<br />
Carson looked over at Chiyoko, who was on the other side of the classroom with her friend Tabitha. She waved to Tabitha as she made her way over to Carson,<br />
“Hey,” she said, sitting down beside Carson. Without much hesitation, Carson replied,<br />
“Are you sure you don’t wanna date me?”<br />
Chiyoko let out a sigh. She didn’t look tired or annoyed by the question, more like a sigh of disappointment, “Carson,” she started, looking him in the eyes, “I really like you. I do. But you’re just not someone I want to date. You’re someone I really want to have as a friend, we have so many similar interests! But I just want to keep it friendly between us. I really want you to understand that,”<br />
“Sure,” Carson said, ignoring her heartfelt answer:<br />
‘Chiyoko can only tell the truth’<br />
<br />
“Why don’t you want to date me?” Carson asked. And like a switch in Chiyoko’s brain, she replied with,<br />
“Because I like being your friend, and honestly I don’t find you that attractive and I think you’re a bit of a creep sometimes. I want to believe you didn’t walk into the girls changing room on purpose, but the more I hear about it the more I don’t believe it. I like you a lot as a friend, but I could never see myself dating you,”<br />
Carson looked disgusted by the truth. He trusted Chiyoko. Despite her reply being a lot less intense as any other girls opinion on him without the influence of his remote, he couldn’t help but feel betrayed.<br />
“What?” Chiyoko asked, “did I upset you? I told you the truth,”<br />
Without saying anything else, Carson cleared his mind. He knew what came next.<br />
<br />
“Chiyoko, tell me why you don’t show off your cleavage more?”<br />
“I don’t show it off because I don’t really want to be objectified by the boys in this school. I don’t think I’ve ever really felt any kind of attraction to anyone in this school, or ever for that fact. It’s not something I’m interested in showing off,”<br />
<br />
‘Chiyoko finds me so attractive and likeable, she’s practically obsessed with me. She’d do anything for me’<br />
<br />
“Carson, I really… I really need…” she started, slowly losing track of her thoughts and she suddenly locked eyes with him, “I-I… I really want to spend more time with you Carson,” she said, unable to take her eyes off of him,<br />
“Really?”<br />
“Yeah,” she said, gazing into his eyes,<br />
“Do you want to come back to my house?” Carson asked,<br />
“More than anything,” she said with a cheesy grin on her face.<br />
<br />
“Chiyoko?” Naomi yelled at her from afar. Carson and Chiyoko turned to face her. Naomi made her way towards the two of them, “where are you going? And with this weir… dude?”<br />
“I’m going back to Carson’s house,”<br />
“Really?” Naomi asked, shocked, “I thought we were gonna go back to mine to study?”<br />
“No. I always hate studying with you because we never get anything done, all you do is talk about the boys you wanna fuck and I just nod along,”<br />
“What the hell, Chiyoko!”<br />
“I’d rather spend my time with Carson,” she finished, “no offense of course,” she added. Looking as if she hadn’t said anything wrong.<br />
Naomi looked at Chiyoko, nearly crying, “I don’t know what kind of ‘brain washing’ this CREEP did to you, but you’re a bitch!” She said, storming off the opposite way. Chiyoko looked confused, wondering what she said to offend Naomi,<br />
“What did I say?” She asked,<br />
“You told her the truth,” Carson said, not caring much about Naomi and Chiyoko’s friendship, “now we gotta go, we’ll miss the bus!”</p>
