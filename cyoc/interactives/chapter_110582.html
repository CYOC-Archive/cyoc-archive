<br />
Julie’s Saturday morning and early afternoon was far less enjoyable than Spencer’s or even Eric’s. While she had enjoyed her late night with Brian, she was beside herself for letting Eric catch them together. She wasn’t sure if he would be willing to forgive her. And if not, then this would be the first time Julie was ever dumped. <br />
<br />
“I’m not going to let that nerd tarnish my perfect record.” she thought. <br />
<br />
“Julie, did you hear me?” Melissa asked, The Stovall family was seated in their kitchen eating breakfast. Julie seemed very preoccupied, very unlike her. Normally she was very much a part of whatever conversation they were having. <br />
<br />
Martin was still in the doghouse with his wife, but the two were slowly returning to that point where they could talk to each other without one accusing the other of something lewd. Thus far, Martin had remained quiet for their meal. But after Melissa pointed out Julie’s strange behavior, he perked up. <br />
<br />
“Julie, your mother is talking to you.” Martin said. Julie snapped out of her daze, looking between her parents. <br />
<br />
“Oh, sorry. I didn’t realize you were speaking to me. What did you want Mom?” Julie asked. <br />
<br />
“Nothing too important. Is something wrong? You were in some deep thought just now.” Melissa asked. <br />
<br />
“Uh, it’s… I’m just thinking about Eric.” <br />
<br />
“Oh, how so?” Martin asked. <br />
<br />
“I dunno, just thinking about him in general I guess. I mean, he’s smart, and sweet, and just an all-around nice guy but…”<br />
<br />
“Are you thinking about breaking up with him?” Melissa asked, concerned. The two had grown so close since the Anderson’s move. To end things now, it was unexpected and awfully sudden. Melissa wanted her daughter to be happy, and at the same time didn’t want Eric’s heart to be broken either. Eric was, as Julie had said, one of the sweetest, most gentlemanly teenagers Melissa had ever met in her sixty some years of living. <br />
<br />
“I don’t know. I just don’t feel the same way I used to about him. You’re not upset are you?” Julie asked.<br />
<br />
“Now why on Earth should we be upset?” Martin asked. <br />
<br />
“I… you two are so fond of Eric, and I didn’t want you to be disappointed.” Julie said. <br />
<br />
“Julie, there’s nothing to be disappointed about. If you don’t feel anything towards Eric, then that’s that. We can’t change that. I’m sure you’ll find another young man who is just as nice as Eric.” Martin said. <br />
<br />
“And a were already.” Melissa thought, but refrained from saying. She did like Eric, but wasn’t very keen on the fact he was still normal. That brought about all sorts of issues. And Melissa did not want to see Julie’s heart broken if Eric chose to be a land were rather than something more compatible. <br />
<br />
“Thanks. I’m going to talk to him later.” Julie said before dashing off to her bedroom to organize her thoughts in private. Which left Melissa and Martin alone to glare at each other. Neither knew what to say to the other. Martin shrunk back into his seat and tried to look small. Melissa was no werecat, but when angry her claws would come out. <br />
<br />
“Maybe if I just keep a low profile around her things won’t be so bad. No more screwing around, I don’t want my marriage to end. Melissa would make good on her promise to divorce me if it came to that, I have no doubt.” Martin thought. <br />
<br />
He rose from the table, cleared his plate and went to his office to do some work. And left the door open so that anyone could plainly see that he was actually working. Melissa sighed and went to the kitchen. She needed to get away from this madness. Swimming to the Caribbean sounded good right about now…<br />
<br />
----------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Once upstairs, Julie only remained there for an hour or two. Both her parents were preoccupied with work. Martin in his study, Melissa working in the kitchen. So Julie took the opportunity to message Brian. <br />
<br />
“HEY UP 4 ROUND 2?”<br />
<br />
“ALWAYS. MEET ME AT THE LAKE IN 15?” Brian texted back.<br />
<br />
“SEE YOU THERE.” Julie felt herself grow wet at the thought. She knew that, even for a were, she thought about sex more often than most people. She’d been a “good girl” and held herself back as long as she could. Dating Eric was certainly a test to her willpower. But after two months of dating him, Julie had to do something about the fire burning in her gut. <br />
<br />
Julie was naked from the waist down, and while she packed her backpack for her trip to the lake, she rubbed her inflamed sex. Julie moaned as pleasure spread to the ends of her nerves. Julie was quickly brought to an orgasm, and her wetness was sprayed all over the floor. After she was finished, Julie saw that she had shifted to her Stage 2 form. <br />
<br />
Bright orange scales coated her legs, and her feet were now flippers. Julie smiled and patted her sex once more before dressing. Knowing she would just be taking it off later, Julie threw on a bikini and a pair of loose shorts. Once she was convinced the coast was clear, Julie proceeded to sneak back downstairs as quietly as she could. Slipping out the back door, Julie shifted her backpack and broke into a brisk jog to make it to the lake to meet Brian. <br />
<br />
The man in question was already waiting, having finished his HW and then left for another afternoon of relaxation. He wasn’t keen on being marked by Eric as the guy Julie cheated on him with, but then again Eric didn’t know Brian. There was little chance he’d find out. Brian was a were, but he was also a year older and Eric wasn’t exactly in the same social circle as him. <br />
<br />
“Besides, it’s Eric. It’d be another story if it was Nate. I can’t hold my own against a werewolf. Eric’s normal, for now.” Brian thought. He stripped off his clothing, and waded into the cool water of the lake. His clothes folded into a neat pile, Brian submerged himself and waited for his transformation to start. <br />
<br />
Since otters were small animals, Brian remained the same heigh after he shifted. As his otter form was based on the North American river otter, his tail was on the short side, but much thicker, and his ears were closer together. His muzzle is short, more like a cat’s than a dog’s, with long, thick whiskers. His neck thickens some, and he hands and feet gain webbing and short claws.<br />
<br />
Brian’s fur is made of short, dense guard hairs, keeping him warm in cold water. Light brown fur covers the backside of his body, while gray and cream colored fur covers his front. Brian’s eyes adjust to the dark, and he dives further into the lake. His ears and nose close up instinctively, so he can swim without worrying about sucking in water. The bottom of the lake is full of fish and turtles. All of whom seem a little bewildered by the wereotter currently doing laps around the lake’s perimeter. <br />
<br />
Swimming is, in Brian’s book, the second best way to exert energy. Surfacing, he hopes to find Julie but there’s no sign of her. So Brian sinks back down and decides to pleasure himself for now. His otter-cock slides out of its sheath. Much like a canine’s, it was a darker shade of pink than a human’s. The head was larger than the rest of the shaft, and a small knot was housed inside his sheath. <br />
<br />
Grasping his cock with his webbed paw, he starts pumping himself. A series of bubbles float up above him as he sighs in pleasure. Now in the need of more oxygen, Brian allows himself to float upwards, while still stroking himself. His muzzle breaches the surface to breath. His whiskers twitch as pleasure flares deep inside him. Brian arches his back, pushing his cock above the water. The afternoon air tickles him, and Brian pumps faster. <br />
<br />
“Just a little more.” he said to himself. Brian felt himself on the edge of release, when something warm suddenly enveloped his cock. Brian sat forward, sicking his lower body below the water. And with it, Julie’s mouth. Brian was so wrapped up in pleasuring himself he didn’t notice Julie swim up. She’s full transformed, her orange tail lashing about under the water. Brian can see she has one hand stroking her own sex, while her mouth greedily sucks his hard cock. <br />
<br />
“Hey there stud. Couldn’t wait for me huh?”<br />
<br />
“Sorry.”<br />
<br />
“Don’t be, I’m glad you’re ready. I am. I didn’t nearly get enough last night.” Julie said. She licked Brian’s length from top to bottom, causing another wave of pleasure to roll through him. Julie digs two fingers deep into her snatch, her own body igniting with pleasure. Wrapping as much of her tongue as she could around Brian’s cock, she then cupped his balls with her free hand. Hefting them in their furry sack, Julie felt them spasm at her touch. <br />
<br />
Soon her mouth was filled with hot seed, and Julie plunged as much of her hand into her slit as she could. Julie felt her own body shudder from the orgasm. It wasn’t nearly enough for her though. Brian took a breath before allowing Julie to push him under, and effectively mount his cock. Grinding her hips against his, Julie waited until the blunt head of Brian’s penis met the the outer folds of her vagina. <br />
<br />
“Oh yes, fill me up Brian!” Julie cried out, though her words were lost underwater. Brian was unable to speak underwater, as he still needed air to breath. He merely nodded and rammed himself up. His cock penetrated Julie’s folds, sliding deeper and deeper until his foot long cock was completely inside. The two lovers locked their lips as Brian’s thrusts speed up. His furry scrotum bounced against Julie’s scaled torso and thighs. Using a hand to fondle her larger breasts, around a DD cup rather than her usual C, Julie felt her pussy tightening in anticipation for her climax. <br />
<br />
The feeling only intensified Brian’s own arousal. He could feel Julie’s fuck hole clamping down on his cock, and he needed more. He was close to another mind blowing orgasm. It was so much better than just pleasuring herself. <br />
