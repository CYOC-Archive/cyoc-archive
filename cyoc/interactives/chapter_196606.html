<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Toby marveled at his newly acquired powers as he soared across the skies. He could see the cities, the woods and the ocean from high above. He felt like a superhero as he flew high above the air in his new godly form. Then, it dawned on him that he needed to return to his humble origins so he could make an impact on his friends using his new abilities. <br />
<br />
“Alright! Enough flying around. Time to get back to school!” he grinned, as he soared back to his school, landing near the woods were his bag lay on the grass. As he looked on, he realized that he had grown to over twenty feet tall, way too big to be seen by any of his classmates with causing a scare. <br />
<br />
“I need to hide who I am for now.” He thought, instantly shrinking back to his ordinary height of 5-foot-6 inches tall, quite average for a high school senior. He was even on the shorter side, but it didn’t matter. He didn’t want to stand out. <br />
<br />
Once he stood on the ground, he changed into his clothes, which were much too small for him now. His muscles had gotten so big that he had completely outgrown his clothing. So, he used his powers to transform his shirt and shorts into a nice, warm, big, black hoodie and black baggy pants with basketball high tops on his feet. “Nobody will see anything different about me now.” <br />
<br />
He scanned the athletic facilities before him, looking for any members of the football team, when he discovered that one of the guys was in the locker room. They had just finished their practice and only one boy was sitting on a bench in the locker room. He disappeared and popped up in the locker room, seeing the lonely boy sitting there in the corner between the wall and a row of lockers. It was Preston, one of the weakest and smallest guys on the team. <br />
<br />
“Hey, Preston…” Toby said to the boy, who had just removed his gear. His helmet and pads were on the floor, and the jersey was on the ground. He was only wearing his underwear. Preston was short and skinny. No wonder he was a benchwarmer. <br />
<br />
“Toby? What are you doing here?” the nerdy boy replied. “I though you got kicked off the team!” <br />
<br />
“So? I can still come and visit my old teammates, can’t I?” <br />
<br />
“Nobody cares, Toby. And I’m just a benchwarmer, so it doesn’t make any difference to me because I won’t ever get to play in a game. I barely get to touch the ball during practice! I should have been kicked off the team, not you!” Preston sighed. “We need you on the team. I wish Coach would take you back!” <br />
<br />
“Hey! Listen. You need to step up to the plate, dude. You can do it! All you gotta do is have confidence.” Toby said to him. <br />
<br />
“Easy for you to say! At least you got to play! I have been sitting with my butt on the bench all year long! I’m clumsy, slow and weak. Coach doesn’t want me here!” Preston spat back. Tears began to roll down his cheek. <br />
<br />
“Preston, listen. Things are gonna change. Right now! First, you’re gonna become very sleepy!” Toby ordered. <br />
<br />
“I’m not tired! What are you talking… “then Preston let out a deep yawn before he leaned back against the row of lockers and rested his head and shoulder against the side wall. Within moments, the boy dozed off to a deep sleep, just as Toby ordered. <br />
<br />
Toby stood before the sleeping boy and then he squatted down before him. <br />
<br />
“Preston, you are the biggest and the strongest player on our football team! You are very talented, and you have the best skills in football. You will grow in muscle and in height and you will have a strong desire to constantly work out in the gym. You can catch the ball from anywhere and you can run faster than anyone else. Coach will come begging for you to play in every game from now on!” Toby said quietly.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, everything that Toby said, came true. <br />
<br />
Preston’s arms bulged with raw muscle, with his biceps and triceps filling out dramatically. His shoulders doubled in width while his pectorals exploded in size. His flat stomach suddenly showed a twelve-pack of ripped, well-defined abdominal muscles only the biggest bodybuilders could have. <br />
<br />
Preston’s legs grew to twice their width and depth as well as his quads transformed from stick figures into large, long mounds of muscle which resembled tree trunks. Massive, solid quads filled out with thick cords of muscle fibers, with big teardrops showing on the front beneath the knees. His calves grew so large that they resembled soccer balls covered in veins sticking out from the back of his legs. Finally, Preston grew to an astounding height of 6-foot-6 inches tall, making him bigger than most guys on the team. <br />
<br />
“Preston. Yo, Preston. Wake up, big guy!” Toby smiled, as he placed his hands on the boy’s broad shoulders and shook him awake. <br />
<br />
“Uhhhmm?” the sleepy boy groaned as he opened his eyes. <br />
<br />
“You fell asleep in the locker room!” <br />
<br />
Preston woke up and looked around. Then, he stood up, towering over Toby by a whole foot. <br />
<br />
“What… What’s going on, here? What happened?” he wondered, looking confused. <br />
<br />
“You look great, big guy!” Toby grinned widely. “Flex those arms for me, so I can see how strong you are. <br />
<br />
Preston raised up his arms and flexed, showing off his two massive biceps. <br />
<br />
“Whoa! Thanks for the gun show, dude!” Toby giggled. “You’re so much bigger and stronger than me now!” <br />
<br />
“Awww… Sorry for scaring you, Toby. I mean, we’re still friends, right?” Preston said, walking up to Toby and embracing the smaller boy with a big bear hug. Preston and Toby had always been friends. <br />
<br />
“Of course. I’m just really happy to see how big you’ve gotten!” Toby smiled. <br />
<br />
“Well, these muscles won’t grow on their own. I need to get to the gym and then I gotta eat and go to sleep!” Preston said, as he put on the bigger clothes in his soft bag. All his clothing changed to fit his larger body in this new reality. <br />
<br />
Just then, the door swung open and the football coach walked in. <br />
<br />
“Preston! I was looking all over the place for you! Meet us here on the field for early morning practice at 6AM. You’re playing wide receiver this weekend. Be ready!” the coach said before he walked off. <br />
<br />
“See that? You’re not a benchwarmer anymore! You’re actually playing!” Toby cheered. <br />
<br />
“Whoa! I better get ready! I need to hit the gym!” Preston sighed. <br />
<br />
“Have a good one, big guy! You’ll do great!” Toby smiled as Preston left the locker room. <br />
<br />
“One down, many more to go!” Toby thought to himself as he wondered where to go, next.</p>
