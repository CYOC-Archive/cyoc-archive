<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff awoke on his stomach, with his hooves curled up underneath himself. He remembered everything. His life as a normal human, getting the Chronivac and changing the entire world. He also remembered his new life. Born in a barn, being raised by his mother, when he hit puberty and his breasts came in... wait. Jeff looked down and realized something had not gone exactly as he had planned.<br />
<br />
He, or rather she, was a girl. Reality changed and in this world, she was not only a human in the role of a horse, but was also born as a female! A human mare to be exact. What was worse, was that unless she was mistaken, she could feel 4 distinct masses protruding from her torso, meaning she would definitely be becoming a designated breeder by her owners today. Today was the day her masters would distribute the fully grown humans into their life roles. Soon she just knew that she would be given over to the breeders, just like her mother was. Luckily  at least she liked it here in the nursery barn. Everyone was so nice and the horses had always treated her well when she was growing up. Maybe becoming a breeder wouldn&#39;t be so bad afterall? <br />
<br />
&quot;No! This isn&#39;t right. Why is breeding so appealing to me?&quot; thought Jeff to herself. She wanted to be the one doing all of the fucking, not the one being fucked by so many wonderfully attractive cocks! Especially the big one her best friend Mark had! He was by far the most manliest human she had even seen. 24&quot; of pure human dick. Just thinking about it made her pussy quiver nonstop while soaking itself in anticipation. Jeff onew she shouldn&#39;t be thinking like this, but her human instincts and horniness were diluting her own thoughts. Was it really so bad that he became female? I mean, sure he doesn&#39;t get to fuck many different mares, but now so many hot stallions get to fuck her. Plus they come to her! She can have anyone of them, or all of them, as long as her owners approve of course. Who knows, maybe this is all for the best?<br />
<br />
&quot;Lady, come on girl. Its time to go!&quot; Came a voice from above Jeff. Looking up, a horse girl was looking into her stall. Lady, as Jeff was apparently now called, knew this girl to be Sarah, her owner&#39;s youngest daughter. The owner had gifted her over to this horse girl as a birthday present earlier this year. Sarah was a great caretaker. She often would even sneak her a few extra sugar cubes after she finished her brushing. Lady liked Sarah, so she listened and got up. <br />
<br />
Even though Lady had experienced being a human in this world, Jeff was still new, so while relying on Lady&#39;s experience, she managed to quickly balance herself on her 4 legs. If felt kind of awkward though. Her 4 admittedly large breasts hung below her in 2 rows, with a teat extending another 3 inches below each of them. They were only about 3 feet off the ground, where as her torso was easily 3.5-4 feet off the ground. Her black tail was even happily swishing back and forth as Sarah gently stroked her head. &quot;That a girl. Easy now, let me get your harness on first.&quot; <br />
<br />
Lady simply stood there obediently and let Sarah place the harness around her head. The bit forced her mouth open and she couldn&#39;t help but start to drool everywhere, which apparently was considered normal now. Taking the reins, Sarah opened her stall door and lead her out as Lady followed behind without a fuss. Lady looked over into the adjacent stalls and saw that they were empty. Only a few humans were actually in the barn besides her, and that was mostly just her mother. She was off in another stall, nursing what was Lady&#39;s 3 newest brothers and sister. They were born just recently too. She even vaguely remembered being in her sister&#39;s spot, hungering for her mother&#39;s teat as she wobbled on her legs. As she pass her mother&#39;s stall, her mother leans her head over and gives her loving a lick on the face. &quot;You have grown up to become a fine young mare, Lady. Now go out and get your official position&quot; encouraged her mother. <br />
<br />
Lady guessed that since unlike human males, human females had different roles based on many different factors. Specifically though, breast count weighed a huge amount towards the final decision. Any mare with 4 breasts like her, were almost guarenteed to become breeders. But if someone specifically requested something, or a mare showed more tallent elsewhere, there was always a chance to not be designated as an official breeder. One of Lady&#39;s older sisters had that happen. Her owner had her become the main show horse for the ranch&#39;s advertising agency. Occasionally Lady would see her being ridden around the ranch showing off the various facilities to investors, while demonstrating how promising the ranches breeding program was that even what normally was hands down a guaranteed breeder could be used instead as a show mare. She seemed to like the role too. Lady/Jeff just hoped that she would come to love whatever role she was given.</p>
