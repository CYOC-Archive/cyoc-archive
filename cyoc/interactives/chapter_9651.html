<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Luke had been having the strangest day.<br />
<br />
He had been walking down the street, then for some reason, he had this undesirable urge to go into the Surf Wear Shop and try on a tight red Speedo. Upon wearing it, he had changed into some kind of muscle fag though, as he had started having sex with the men surrounding him almost immediately. Then, an hour or so later, he suddenly had gained control of his senses and came to on the shop floor, beneath another man who was tonguing him. Within seconds the other man had gotten off embarassed, and Luke, feeling just as awkward, quickly scrambled upright, grabbed his clothes that he had shed when he joined in the orgy, and ran back to his hotel room.<br />
<br />
Sitting on his bed in his bath robe after having two extremely long showers, Luke began wondering what had happened. He had never heard of...well, anything like that before. He couldn't figure out why he put the Speedos on either; he wasn't the type to just &quot;parade about&quot; in nothing but a tight Speedo, and definitely not one in that color. Still, something was stangely accomodating about the whole experience...<br />
<br />
No, Luke told himself. &quot;You're still a &quot;swinging bachelor&quot;...&quot; he muttered with a laugh. &quot;The Tiger...&quot; he exclaimed; Tiger being his nick name all the girls gave him. He got up and moved across the room to the mirror and looked at his reflection. Luke stared at himself, as if trying to decipher his own face. There was no possible way he was a homosexual, he though. Not a chance...<br />
<br />
After a short while, Luke spotted the clock in the reflection. It was past 10:00 PM and he hadn't even had dinner yet! He turned around and moved to the phone...maybe he could still order room service or something.<br />
<br />
As he reached forward, his hand lurched strangely. He held it in front of him, examining for something he couldn't quite see; the full moon silhouetted around it, giving his skin a blue tinge around the edges. The white bath robe's sleeve slid down his arm of its own accord. Gazing upon it, he watched in amazement as the hairs across his arm faded into his skin. Quickly pulling back the sleeve of his left hand, he watched on as the hair vanished across it too. This whole thing seemed strangely familiar. He pushed these thoughts to the back of his head as he went to the balcony of his room for some fresh air. Luke leaned against the hand rail and began to breathe heavily, a small sweat breaking across his fore head. Suddenly, his whole body felt like it was fire. The light faded away as some clouds passed over the moon. Standing back, he began to air out his chest by flapping the collar of his bath robe back and forth. His temperature appeared to be returning to normal…<br />
<br />
He had better call a doctor or something in the morning, he thought to himself as he turned to go back inside. Before he had fully turned, the clouds smothering the moon disappated, revealing its eerie yellow surface. Luke's entire body began to shake. The sweat passed over his entire body; it was getting unbearably hot...Luke felt dizzy as he gripped onto the hand rail of the balcony. Panting, he looked downwards to calm himself. His eyes trailed over his arms...the sleeves were still stuck up at his shoulder and were being halted by a muscly bicep. <br />
<br />
&quot;Huh?&quot; Luke gasped. Gripping his bath robe, he attempted to tug it down, but instead he managed to tear it clean off his shoulder. On his other arm, the pressure of his muscle was building, popping through the other side. Shivering slightly, Luke’s hands passed over the front of his bath robe...he was getting too hot...he couldn’t take it any longer. He gripped the middle of the bath robe and flung it backwards. He sighed happily, the heat was gone. Scratching his chest clumsily, he looked down at himself, but stopped. His chest had grown abs to match his arms. His legs were now tighted and muscular, and for some reason, a familiar looking red Speedo was on him where nothing should have been. He poked it gently with a finger, and was surprised at how well he filled it. Wearing a tight Speedo wasn't that bad, he though. And the red looked pretty good against his tanned body...he could live with this...then he stopped suddenly, his mind whirling.<br />
<br />
Before he could regain his sense, pure Speedo Fag lust filled him. He stood there, a muscle god immersed in the brilliant moon light, hungry for another man to join him...</p>
