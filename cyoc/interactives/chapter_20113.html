<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Peter just stared at the pool, even though it was difficult, because of his huge pectorals. Allen realized that he was struggling to see what was happening, since Allen could see through Peter’s eyes. He had control over all of Peter’s senses, feelings, thoughts and emotions, and he could change them whenever he wanted to.<br />
<br />
“Okay, I’ll shrink your pecs back to normal, until Steve says something…” Allen’s voiced boomed, inside of Peter’s head. Peter was the only one who could hear Allen’s voice, since it was coming from inside of Peter’s head.<br />
<br />
Peter’s huge pectorals quickly shrunk back, until he looked like the tall, lanky swimmer once again. It was just in time, too, for Steve had made his way out of the pool and marched right up to Peter. He was furious, and he began to scream right in Peter’s face.<br />
<br />
“You think that’s funny, boy?” he shouted at the boy. “You think you can pull these lame tricks on me, your coach? You’re nothing but a weakling! You’re a tall, skinny kid, who just knows how to stay afloat when you’re in the water. Whatever you’ve accomplished so far, is all because of me, me, and only me! Do you see that, boy?”<br />
<br />
“Skinny? He called you SKINNY? Wait, I’ll grow some muscle on ya!” Allen said to Peter, inside of Peter’s mind.<br />
<br />
“No, Allen! Please! My muscles are big enough…” Peter thought to himself, as he continued to stare at the coach, who was busy yelling at him for not working out enough.<br />
<br />
“I want to pack some muscles on you. Oh, I know. Not only am I going to grow your EXISTING muscles, but I’m going to grow you a SECOND SET of NEW muscles as well! I’m gonna double the muscles on your body! That’ll show Steve who you are…” Allen replied angrily.<br />
<br />
Peter gulped when he heard what Allen said.<br />
<br />
“I want you to spend hours in the gym and then hours in the pool, do you hear me?” Steve yelled at Peter. “I want that State Championship - got that?”<br />
<br />
“S-S-Sure, Coach… What… Whatever you s-s-say, Coach…” Peter replied sadly.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, Peter’s body was frozen in place. Peter’s mouth dropped wide open, when he felt an incredible tingling sensation over his entire body.<br />
<br />
“Let’s add new quads and calves to those skinny legs of yours…” Allen ordered.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, Peter’s legs grew twice as wide as before! A new set of quads formed on each leg, causing his leg to swell up considerable. Large layers of muscles formed on his legs, making them freakishly thick! Veins covered them completely, as he now sported TWO quads on EACH leg!<br />
<br />
Next, a new set of calves swelled up on his lower legs, neatly positioned next to his original muscles. Now, there were TWO large calves on EACH LEG, making his legs incredibly wide and muscular.<br />
<br />
“Whoa!” Peter exclaimed, as he looked down and noticed that he had begun to grow muscles which weren’t there before!<br />
<br />
“Alright! Yesssss! Let’s do the upper body next! I want you to grow a whole new set of muscles on your body! Whoohoo!!” Allen cheered, as his mighty powers immediately began to transform Peter’s upper body.<br />
<br />
Next, Peter’s torso began to widen considerably, forcing Peter to adjust his stance by shifting his legs a little to one side.<br />
<br />
A brand new set of duplicate abdominals formed over his newly widened stomach, allowing him to have TWO six-packs of abs on his torso!<br />
<br />
Then, two new pectorals grew besides the original ones, making him look like an incredible muscle freak! Peter now had four large spheres of big, hard, round muscle above his abs! This widened his shoulders considerable, since he had TWO sets of pecs on his chest!<br />
<br />
“Wowww….” Peter moaned softly, since the new muscles allowed a huge surge in strength to flow through his entire body. Peter loved every minute of it, as he closed his eyes and tilted his head upward. The feeling was awesome!<br />
<br />
“Now, the finale…” Allen chuckled. “You will be the only person on earth with FOUR BICEPS!”<br />
<br />
Suddenly, Peter’s armed doubled in width. Next, brand new biceps began to swell up on each arm, neatly placed right besides the original muscles! They grew until they formed two large humps of solid muscle, which were placed side-by-side.<br />
<br />
“Flex those babies, dude!” Allen commanded.<br />
<br />
Peter turned to face his right arm. He made a fist and raised up his arm. Two large balls of muscle appeared over his huge python-arms! He had two biceps on each arm, and the feeling of strength was awesome!<br />
<br />
Steve just continued to yell while Peter’s body was growing a second set of muscles. When he had finally run out of things to say, he turned to face the boy, who just remained there quietly, while listening to his coach with a sad expression on his face.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, Steve gasped when he saw how Peter had transformed into a body of muscle!<br />
<br />
“I… I… I just had… another growth spurt… Coach…” Peter whispered to him.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, Peter’s FOUR pectorals began to expand all at once!<br />
<br />
As Peter’s pecs grew bigger, they started to jut out further from his body! As they continued to inflate, they pushed forward, coming closer and closer to Steve’s face!<br />
<br />
“Oh my God…”<br />
<br />
Steve saw this WALL OF PECS coming towards him as the muscles continued to swell up and become the size of basketballs! The giant muscles forced Steve to take a step back…<br />
<br />
“Whaaa! Get away from meeee!” he screamed, as he stepped back and lost his balance.<br />
<br />
PLUNGE!!!<br />
<br />
Steve had fallen back into the pool once again!<br />
<br />
Peter’s growth stopped right away, but Allen decided to allow Peter to keep his second set of muscles for a little while longer.<br />
<br />
Peter stepped up to the edge of the pool, looking down at the water, where he could admire his reflection.<br />
<br />
“Wow… I look awesome…” he chuckled; as he flexed his arms and delighted in seeing TWO biceps pop up on his monster-arms!<br />
<br />
Steve quickly climbed out of the pool and ran away. He was scared to death of the large muscle-man, which Peter had suddenly transformed into…<br />
<br />
Over 80% of Peter’s body now consisted of muscle! He looked and felt awesome!</p>
