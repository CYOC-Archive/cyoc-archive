<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The next day Park walked into the school with Jace by his side.  Park was now the same size as Jace.  Like Jace, Park had two sets of memories but he knew what he had to do.  They went through the school day as normal, playing the role he was dealt of the dumb jock.  He had his last period free so he made his way to the athletics department.  He entered the corridor where the coaches had their offices.  At the end of the hall two linebackers stood outside the office, like they were standing guard.  He recognized them immediately and it filled him with anger and sorrow.  Because he memorized the files, knew he was looking at Jacob (Luca) and Mark (Marco).  They both looked at him with contempt.  They tried to intimidate him but he just looked at them and said &quot;sleep boys&quot; and they collapsed to the ground.  He looked at them sadly and whispered &quot;I&#39;ll fix this.&quot;<br />
The office he needed was through the locker room.  Park had been in here many times for soccer, crooks country and football.  He had memories of being the team&#39;s kicker on top of his old memories.  He&#39;d been in here many times but it was the first time he&#39;d been creeped out.  He could hear voices talking, deep voices.  He got to the row where his locker was and saw two guys talking.  He could immediately tell that it was the twins, except they were the size of a small house.  They were too involved in their conversation to notice Park.  In the last row Park was shocked and a little turned on by what he saw.  Two football players having a threesome with one of the cheerleaders.  They both had a tattoo of the school mascot.  The guy getting his cock sucked definitely resembled Ty, but what shocked him was he saw Jace fucking her.  Park then wondered if the longer they were all like this, the quicker they would lose themselves to the new persona.  Whoever was responsible didn&#39;t care about the consequences.<br />
As Park walked into the football coach&#39;s office, he heard the girl moan in pleasure.<br />
&quot;Come in Park...I&#39;ve been expecting you.&quot;  The coach said.  Before he could react, he was pushed in by the twins, followed by Jace pulling up his shorts and standing next to the coach.<br />
&quot;Hello...&quot; Park said eyeing his surroundings.  &quot;Why have you done this to my friends?  Give them back!!  I want my be back!&quot;  He yelled.  To his surprise, he could have swore he heard Jace mumble fag under his breath as he smirked.<br />
Jace then growled, &quot;Watch how you talk to the coach faggot!&quot;  Park looked at him with sadness in his eyes, realizing that this was no longer an act.<br />
The coach eased Jace back, &quot; I&#39;m only helping these boys realize their full potential.&quot; <br />
&quot;How are you helping them reach their full potential?  They were already well on their way to that.  You&#39;ve changed their identities, ethnicities and the sexuality!  What&#39;s the point?&quot; Park asked. <br />
&quot;Everyone knows that straight men have better opportunities, especially if they are certain...well you know&quot; the coach smiled wryly. <br />
&quot;That&#39;s just bullshit!  But you know coach...I wonder what they would do if they knew your secret coach?&quot;  Park had a thin smile.<br />
&quot;Enough!  Everyone out!  Leave me alone with Park.&quot;  The football players looked confused but heeded their coach.  Jace snarled at Park as he walked by, so Park grabbed his ass, causing Jace to give Park a dirt look.  <br />
As soon as the door closed, &quot; So tell me...when did our soccer phenom Kenji Nakamura become this misogynist, racist, homophobic fuck?&quot;  <br />
&quot;You better watch it boy!&quot;  The coach spat back.  &quot;You really want to know...fine, I&#39;ll tell you what I remember.  He had gotten this program in the mail.&quot;<br />
&quot;He who?&quot; <br />
&quot;Kenji.&quot; <br />
&quot;Who don&#39;t you use &quot;I&quot; since you are the same person?&quot;<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t press your luck.  I&#39;m nothing like that little chink bastard.&quot; He said clearly pissed off.  &quot;As I was saying HE got this program in the mail.  A sims like game, he thought, and the box said &#39;see what would happen if your dreams came real&#39;. It downloaded some update and then it showed everyone in the area.  Because the football team liked to pick on him, even though they were all pathetic, he thought it would be fun to to create a character to get back at them.&quot;<br />
&quot;Ahhh so that&#39;s how your cracker ass was born...&quot;  Park said.<br />
&quot;What the little idiot didn&#39;t realize was that the changes are real.  So I decided to take my football team and improve it. And while was at it, definitely make this school...more American.  Then one day I saw this groups of faggot soccer players and decided that you people would be perfect to start.&quot; He smirked, which made Park want to hit him.<br />
&quot;I see and you thought you would fix things?  You&#39;re ridiculous.  Your like a caricature from some shitty movies.  It looks to me like you were created on accident all because a poor kid was sick of getting bullied.  You&#39;re plan has been done in a million bad movies.....and your poems....your poems are terrible.&quot;  Park scoffed.<br />
&quot;That&#39;s it...I was going to make this easy on you and let you join the team voluntarily but maybe I&#39;ll make you the water oh or better yet, the cheerleader that everyone on the team passes around.  Regardless, I hope it&#39;s a painful change.&quot;  He then hit a button on his computer.  Thirty seconds passed and nothing happened so he hit the button again...nothing &quot;What the fuck is wrong with this thing?&quot;<br />
&quot;Are you having problems?  Do you need help?&quot; Park taunted<br />
&quot;No!  Sit your ass down!&quot; He barked <br />
&quot;And if I don&#39;t?&quot; <br />
&quot;Boy get your asses back in here!  He roared.  The door opened and in walked Tristan, Silas, Luca, Ty, Marco and Hakeem, followed by 16yo versions of Solomon and Kai, followed lastly by a very pissed off Jae.<br />
&quot;What the hell....you?!?  You did this?   How the hell did you...I&#39;m going to...&quot; The couch panicked <br />
&quot;Your not going to do anything or go anywhere.!&quot; Jae yelled<br />
&quot;How did you do this?  How did you unchange everyone?&quot; <br />
&quot;The same way I&#39;m about to unchange you, because I know this program better than you...better than anyone.  I learned about what happened to Kenji and about you...I also learned how to set up triggers.   For example as soon as I touched someone they would start to change and if you couldn&#39;t see them, they would change even faster.&quot;  Park reached over and flicked the coach between the eyes and he froze in his seat.<br />
The coach&#39;s age slowly melted away from being in his 50s to his 30s then 20s and finally settling at 17.  As this was happening the large gut that was apart of his 5&#39;4 frame disappeared.  He spine grew as his legs and arms grew longer until he reached 6&#39;2.  His weight settled at 175.  The musculature in his legs developed into the legs of a soccer player and cross country runner.  His midrift revealed the 6 pack of someone who took care of his body.  His 18 inch biceps and well developed pecs demonstrated this as well.  His skin took light tan as his turn black and spiked itself, blue highlights appearing.  His nose flattened and eyes shifted from a pale blue to orange-brown.  His clothes changed to a pair of green spezials, a pair of black adidas shorts, and tight black tank top.    He looked up at the room, smiled while saying &quot;sup guys where ya been?&quot; And he passed out.</p>
