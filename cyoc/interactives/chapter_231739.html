<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Hwan didn’t think this could get any better. Sure, it was weird, but to have her crush not only notice her abut take a real interest in her - she would have taken any sort of weird circumstances to get that.<br />
<br />
After riding her for a while, Brad looked like he was getting a bit bored. Hwan was disappointed to see that, not wanting this moment to end. But he had an entirely different idea in mind.<br />
<br />
“What do you say we go back inside, and I can take you to my bedroom?”, Brad propositioned.<br />
<br />
As sudden as it was, it didn’t even occur to Hwan to say no. All she had to say was “Okay!”, and she was being lifted up into the air. A guy as strong as Brad could probably do that with a lot of girls, but it was effortless for him when the girl weighed - as of the last time Hwan checked, since she hardly needed to watch her figure now - about four and a half pounds. So she was carried like it was nothing, deeply envious eyes following her through the doors and inside the house.<br />
<br />
Brad’s bed was covered in bags and purses left behind by the various party guests. Without much thought, he held up Hwan easily in one arm as he brushed all of that stuff aside with the other. Once it was reasonably clear of clutter, he laid her down on top of the covers, and not too gently - the force with which Hwan hit the bed would’ve definitely hurt if she was still flesh and blood, but instead it produced only a soft squeaking noise.<br />
<br />
Brad eagerly pulled down Hwan’s bathing suit, only to find a smooth surface of plastic where her crotch should have been. Hwan recognized the problem as soon as she saw the look of confusion on his face. “Sorry,” she said sheepishly, “I’ve never done this before.” She hoped he would take that to mean she had never done it in this form, and hated to admit the reality - after all, what self-respecting young woman would make it most of the way through senior year and still have her virginity intact?<br />
<br />
Brad didn’t seem to pick up on that. “Neither have I,” he responded, still looking puzzled. Then his expression changed. “But I have an idea.” He reached for the nozzle just above her smooth crotch and started to fumble with the clasp that held it tightly closed.<br />
<br />
Hwan panicked when she realized what he was about to try to do. She knew that other floaties had done stuff like this before, but it sounded terrifying to her, and she definitely wasn’t ready to go through with it herself. “Wait!”, she cried out. “You can’t-“<br />
<br />
But that was all she could get out before everything changed. If she still had lungs, it would be as if all the air had just been violently sucked out of them. With a harsh, high-pitched whine, her very innards were escaping, and Hwan felt like she was drowning.<br />
<br />
Brad didn’t seem to care that her protests had just been suddenly silenced. He was busy figuring out whether his penis would fit inside the hole that he’d just created. It turned out to be pretty much the perfect shape and size, and he wasted no time inserting himself in there. The experience of being penetrated like this was far more painful than pleasurable for Hwan. But she couldn’t speak, and could barely even move, as the air rushed out of every part of her body. There was nothing she could do to stop him.<br />
<br />
With every thrust, Brad pushed himself down onto Hwan’s helpless form. With every push, she deflated a little more. She was trying to raise her arms in the most basic form of self-defense, but whatever magical force replaced her muscles was growing weaker and weaker with every passing second. Soon, she couldn’t lift anything above the wrist, having just barely enough strength to lift her fingers off the surface of the bed. Another moment passed and she couldn’t even do that.<br />
<br />
Just as the last bits of air started to leave her body, Brad finished his motions with a grunt, leaving a glob of semen inside her flattened torso and a sticky trail that followed his penis on its way out of the hole. He seemed completely apathetic to what he had just done, yawning a bit as he wandered off to the bathroom to clean himself up.<br />
<br />
Hwan, meanwhile, was left completely deflated, her nozzle still hanging open as Brad had left it. Her torture was by no means over now that he had satisfied himself. She was completely immobile, unable to move any part of her body even the slightest amount no matter how hard she tried. She couldn’t believe that she had put her trust in someone who would just... <i>use</i> her like that. It occurred to her that she was completely at the mercy of Brad or anybody else who happened to come by. She was literally just an inanimate object now, and the only way she was ever going to do anything ever again was if somebody was willing to inflate her back up first. Alone in Brad’s bedroom, all she could possibly do was wait.</p>
