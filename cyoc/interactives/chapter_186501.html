<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Yelena was breathing a bit heavy, and I was just about to ask if she was okay when she spoke up again, wringing her wrists. &quot;I uh... I-I sort of have... this uh... f-fantasy... see...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You want to be a lesbian mermaid.&quot;<br />
<br />
The blonde blushed. &quot;H-how did you...?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s a lot more common than you think.&quot; Mindy kissed me on the cheek before pushing me off, rolling over to pull our new friend closer. &quot;I was actually gonna do this to hot lips here,&quot; she said, motioning towards me with her head and instantly making me blush too. &quot;But I can do it for you both. Trust me, I think both of you girls are going to love it.&quot;<br />
<br />
I wasn&#39;t so sure about that, but Yelena looked over the moon. &quot;Really? W-what do I have to do?&quot; She leaned in closer to Mindy, as I silently wished for her to be invisible and unheard just like the two of us were. &quot;Do I uh... do I have to... kiss you? M-maybe... maybe... drink your milk?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;...okay, not even gonna address the milk thing,&quot; Mindy muttered before shaking her head. &quot;We don&#39;t have any magic seashells, so it&#39;s not that simple. First, you&#39;ll have to become unified with the sea; the only way to do that, really, is for you to be nearly drowned and rescued at the last second. I can handle that - if you don&#39;t mind a little pain, then it shouldn&#39;t actually be that difficult.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Mindy?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;One sec, Jo,&quot; she replied, waving dismissively at me. &quot;The next thing will be to sacrifice some artifact of your time as a land-dweller. This could be something sentimental, or something with a lot of value... if you&#39;re really desperate a foot will do, but I don&#39;t think we&#39;ll need to be that extreme.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mindyyyyyyyy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Now the part after that is the really hard one. We&#39;re going to need a vessel for mystical sea essence, which means finding a particular type of pearl, and some seaweed from-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mindy!&quot;<br />
<br />
She growled at me. &quot;-from the waters of a place untouched by men&#39;s follies. Hard to find, but I&#39;ve been to a few places where-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;MINDY!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;WHAT?!&quot;<br />
<br />
I held up my hand with the ring, and it pulsed with energy as I skipped us over about an entire young adult novel&#39;s worth of mucking about the ocean in six words. &quot;I wish Yelena was a mermaid.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mindy&#39;s face got almost as red in that moment as the scales that instantly began to form over Yelena&#39;s legs. She squealed and tore off her swimsuit, marveling with glee at the feeling of her legs fusing together into a tail, and gills opening up beneath her chest as it swelled up to match Mindy&#39;s impressive rack. I spent about ten seconds focusing on how her face was suddenly a whole lot prettier before Mindy got my attention, flopping over and glaring at me like I&#39;d just pissed in her cornflakes. Or seaweed. Or whatever it was mermaids had for breakfast.<br />
<br />
&quot;Kiiiiiiinda was hoping for a big adventure there, not gonna lie,&quot; she muttered.<br />
<br />
I shrugged. &quot;That&#39;d take way too long.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe.&quot; She glanced down at my legs. &quot;Not gonna wish yourself up a tail too?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I uh...&quot; I trailed off, rubbing the back of my neck. &quot;You are... you are super hot, like... the hottest mermaid ever-&quot; I paused and looked over at Yelena. &quot;You&#39;re tied with her!&quot; She squealed and went back to feeling up her new tail. &quot;But... I don&#39;t... I don&#39;t know if I&#39;m ready for... all that...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So you&#39;ll make out with a mermaid, but you won&#39;t be a mermaid?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, no, I mean... I just... I like walking, and I don&#39;t want to lose that...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You can literally wish your legs back at any point.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alright, I didn&#39;t have a comeback for that one. &quot;Maybe later, okay? This... this is all really freaky.&quot;<br />
<br />
She sighed. &quot;You&#39;re lucky you&#39;re so goddamn cute, or the shit you do might get me mad.&quot; She leaned over to kiss me on the nose, getting some more redness out of my cheeks before she was flopping on over to make out with Yelena. They... they really went at it, too. Just straight for the french stuff, and then... well... well I didn&#39;t ever really think about sticking a tailfin in the places they were sticking a tailfin, but... they did it. I ended up not joining just because I was too amazed by the sight of it... and I may or may not have had my hand halfway into my own crotch...<br />
<br />
And y&#39;know, when you&#39;re watching two super hot mermaids making out, and one of them moves on to motoroboarding the other&#39;s gigantic rack... well... you start to do stupid things, and say stupid things that you end up regretting saying. &quot;I wish I was those boobs.&quot;<br />
<br />
Didn&#39;t even get the chance to cover my mouth. A single poof, an instant, and suddenly my perception of the world was completely different. My whole body was gone - and instead of my own humanoid shape, I felt my mind diffused over two gigantic tracts of land. I had fantasized about Mindy&#39;s boobs a lot, just... never about BEING them. It was freaky, but... but a really nice kind of freaky. Because those tits? Yeah, they were pretty goddamn sensitive, and Yelena wasn&#39;t exactly taking it slow or easy. I think my brain was fried in about five seconds flat.<br />
<br />
I still had the ring, was the funny thing. It was a nipple piercing now, a fact that Mindy was keenly aware of once she realized there was another voice in her head emanating from her breasts, but it was still the same ring. I could&#39;ve mentally wished myself right out of that situation, but once I was in it? It just turned into one of those things that wasn&#39;t so bad once you tried it. Yelena didn&#39;t really have any idea anyway, and Mindy seemed not to mind - my own arousal and hers sort of got into the same central nervous system, and girl let me tell you - you haven&#39;t had an orgasm until you&#39;ve had a mental feedback loop orgasm.<br />
<br />
Of course, after a while, I did want hands back. And now that I&#39;d been something far more freakish than a mermaid for a while, even sharing one&#39;s body... yeah, my next wish made Mindy pretty happy. Because with another poof and a thought, I was back to being an actual person again - with a long purple tail extending out instead of legs. Mindy had hers wrapped around mine before I could blink, and pretty quick Yelena was wrapping both of us up. And y&#39;know what? Mindy was right - I loved it, the feeling of the water on my scales, the sensation of this big long limb writhing around... it was magical.<br />
<br />
Magical and awkward. Mindy and I, we still didn&#39;t know what the hell to actually do in something like this. It was pretty lucky then that Yelena was there - after another few minutes of watching us fumble through this thing, she stopped us, and started giving us pointers. Tips on how best to please a woman - apparently, just being a girl wasn&#39;t enough to know that. Go figure. It kind of cut the sexy times short, as the lesson evolved into a full on crash course in lesian sex options for women who couldn&#39;t scissor - but it felt valuable, at least. Like I was really learning some important things, stuff that&#39;d come in handy in the future.<br />
<br />
It ended up going on so long that, eventually, Yelena had to cut it short to go home and try to maintain her normal life on land. I stepped in again before Mindy could offer her some ovewrought glamour spell, just making a simple wish that she could shapeshift between human and mermaid - and throwing in the same ability for myself and Mindy. She rolled her eyes hard, but as soon as Yelena was gone, I looked over to find her taking on a pair of legs and a humanoid form - probably the first time she&#39;d had that in years.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, not entirely dedicated to the mermaid thing, then?&quot; I asked with a coy smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, shut up,&quot; she muttered back, reaching out to feel up her very long, very smooth, very sexy legs. &quot;You were my boobs for five minutes. Of all people, you don&#39;t get to criticize the forms other people choose.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe not. But you know what I do get to do?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I get to wish those sexy legs were wrapped around me-&quot;<br />
<br />
I&#39;m not sure if it was the ring getting snarky with me or Mindy just being sick of my shit, but in about three seconds I had those legs wrapped around... my head. And my face in her crotch. And y&#39;know, laying back on the sand, breathing in Mindy&#39;s arorma as the sun set around us... I decided this had been a pretty great day.</p>
