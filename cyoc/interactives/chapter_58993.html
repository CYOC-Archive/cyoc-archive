<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">He had his redheaded Patrick on the brain as he fired up the Chronovac.<br />
<br />
He went into the global settings and... got creative with his commands. He explained to <br />
the program that he wanted all redheads in the world to be *at least* as big as his <br />
massive Patrick... if not bigger. He shivered again as he programmed that. The thought <br />
that there might even be a beast out there bigger than the current alpha on campus made <br />
his dick rock hard yet again. He also told it that although redheads were natural-born <br />
Alphas... they'd be complete submissives in bed. Not to mention that all of them would be <br />
hopeless romantics. <br />
<br />
Dan was perspiring with all the changes he was planning to make. Maybe if he wasn't so <br />
horny, he'd have thought this through further...with ALL REDHEADS still selected, Dan <br />
entered into the sexual characteristics section. <br />
<br />
Across all races, sex drive was about the same, &quot;not for long,&quot; Dan rubbed his crotch, <br />
doubling the sex drive for all redheaded men. He hesitated, &quot;Oh, might as well,&quot; and <br />
pushed it up to four-times the average. Worried they might exhaust themselves, Dan made <br />
them recover instantly from orgasm, with balls that refilled quickly and would ache with <br />
intense pain for release. &quot;Perfect,&quot; he hit save.<br />
<br />
The air rippled as his change took effect.  He heard a muffled bellow from out in the <br />
dining room shortly after. &quot;Oh no fucking way, it couldn't be...&quot; he gasped, hearing some <br />
splashing go with the masculine sound.  Dan switched the Chronovac off and pocketed it, <br />
quickly exiting the stall and bumping into the belly of a hulking blond powerlifter, too <br />
big to see Dan as he sidestepped around and exited the restroom. It sounded like Patrick's <br />
Alpha Roar...maybe he had gone too far?<br />
<br />
The red giant was coming down off of his orgasm, his cock still shuddering and spurting <br />
out orgasmic aftershocks that would put the most voluminous porn stars in the old world to <br />
shame! Bus boys were scurrying around, attempting to clean up the mess. Whenever a redhead <br />
showed up, they always had to have extra staff ready to deal with the mess they made.  Dan <br />
approached the panting Patrick, the air thick with his musky, intoxicating scent, <br />
<br />
&quot;You okay, big guy?&quot; he reached out to touch Patrick's swollen gut, <br />
<br />
&quot;mmmfff, S-Sorry, Dan...&quot; the giant groaned, his cock stiffening again, &quot;You know us <br />
Redheads...&quot; He stood up, upending the table with his throbbing four-foot cock, &quot;...always <br />
horny.&quot; Dan stepped back, looking over the mess, &quot;I'm really sorry, cub...you know us <br />
redheads don't do well in public. So much stimulation...but I wanted to do something <br />
special for you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dan looked up over Patrick's incredible shirt-covered chest to see that the red-bearded <br />
giant was incredibly embarrassed to have done that on their date. His pale skin was flush <br />
with blood. Patrick's cock slowly settled down into a half-hard state... seemingly the <br />
least-horny state that Patrick had anymore. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, babe, it's okay! I know that redheads have... challenges to going out. But it just <br />
makes me like you more,&quot; he smiled, reaching down to adjust himself.<br />
<br />
Patrick's mood did a 180--&quot;R-really? Oh...Dan...&quot; His cock snapped back to hard as he <br />
reached over and picked Dan up into a bracing bear hug kiss. Dan shuddered, creaming his <br />
pants, <br />
<br />
&quot;Let's just go back to the dorms. I still want to learn all about you,&quot; Dan smiled as he <br />
was set down.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, sure! Anything you want, Dan!&quot; Patrick beamed. His heart was fluttering and he had to <br />
force himself not to just beg Dan for his cock right there in the restaurant. That <br />
wouldn't be very cool, even though he knew he wanted to spend the rest of his life with <br />
Dan. He'd slept around during high school and college, unlike his uptight brother, but <br />
he'd always held out hope that The One for him was out there. Now that he'd met Dan... he <br />
knew that he had been right! Of course, all redheads thought like that...  Patrick dug his <br />
meaty hand under his kilt, his wallet (and what looked like an iPad) were strapped to his <br />
thigh. Dan gaped at Patrick's churning balls...visibly swelling larger by the second, they <br />
would be full again in less than an hour... <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, got a text from my brother...I gotta get my book from him tonight, mind if we swing <br />
by?&quot; Patrick, laid down a handful of bills on the table, casually thumbing his iPad-sized <br />
cell phone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your brother's in town? Does he go to our university or somewhere else? I mean, if he <br />
went to our school, he would've joined in the Alpha Bear contest, right?&quot; Dan asked, still <br />
watching those enormous balls on his boyfriend swell larger and larger, inch by inch. It <br />
wasn't a slow process in the least.<br />
<br />
Patrick tucked his wallet and phone back under his kilt and started waddling towards the <br />
exit, his steps wider because of his semi-hard cock, &quot;Marcus is my twin brother, so he's <br />
also a redhead and naturally very alpha and aggressive,&quot; Patrick stopped as they neared <br />
the restrooms, turning to Dan, &quot;but he asserts it differently. He takes after our dads, <br />
tramples the competition when it comes to academia.&quot; The big red giant smiled down to Dan, <br />
&quot;I'll be just a moment, need to use the relief-room,&quot; he pushed through the door, his <br />
shoulders gracing the sides of the frame.<br />
<br />
Dan heard Patrick's voice bark &quot;SERVICE&quot; when the door closed...  Hearing that bark made <br />
his legs quiver. What came after was some rustling sounds, some thumping, another muffled <br />
roar that all the patrons could hear as the giant shot off. He refilled so easily, it <br />
didn't make sense for him to hold back his orgasms. He could just have another whenever he <br />
felt like it, practically. Dan thought about this brother Patrick had... another huge <br />
redhead, but a diligent student instead of a cocky lifter? This could get interesting...<br />
<br />
&quot;Is that your redhead?&quot; A bulky bear walked up to the reliefroom door, waiting for his <br />
turn.<br />
<br />
&quot;...mine?&quot; Dan blinked, &quot;This is only our first date, but, you never know...&quot; The bear <br />
grinned, his beard was trimmed into a short chinstrap that connected with a fauxhawk of <br />
dirty blond hair.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just treat him good, alright?&quot; He sighed, &quot;Redheads fall so easy and hard, combined with <br />
their naturally submissive nature, they get into a lot of trouble if they meet the wrong <br />
kind of man.&quot; Dan's eyes widened at that. He hadn't considered that giant, sexy bottoms <br />
that fell in love so easily would get taken advantage of. Maybe he could make things safer <br />
for them later. <br />
<br />
&quot;I'd never do anything to break that man's heart,&quot; Dan said firmly. &quot;He's special to me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Another wet, muffled roar came from the relief room, followed by Patrick sauntering out, <br />
&quot;Sorry, bud...they'll need a moment to recover after that.&quot; The bear furrowed his brow, <br />
rubbing his painfully-tented package. &quot;Ready, Dan?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, let's go meet this Marcus guy. If he's anything like you, I'm sure he'll become one <br />
of my favorite people...&quot; Dan grinned. Patrick offered his massive arm to Dan, who <br />
accepting it, gripping onto it as they strode out of the restaurant, Patrick having made <br />
his alpha mark on the establishment in record time that evening.</p>
