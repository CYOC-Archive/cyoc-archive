<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ty didn´t move too far. The neighbors of the elephants were the rhinos, and Ty was reminded that Jason had the nickname dickhead. He was hard-headed as well, fitting for a rhino. That he had been friends with Dustin, even when he was not remembering him anymore now, was an interesting detail when they would now be neighbors. And he could let them remember each other if he wanted to. They only needed to forget the changing one, if they later remembered when being changed themselves it was no problem. They couldn´t do anything afterwards anyway. Smiling Ty entered the building and started his wishes regarding Jason.<br />
„First, I wish that my class came here next, with Jason entering last. The moment he is inside he will drop down on all fours without him noticing and be unable to leave on his own again. Everyone beside he himself and me, will see a young rhino in his place, which will be snorting instead of speaking for only us two to understand. He can´t hurt anyone and after he is lead into the enclosure he will slowly change into a young rhino in body, which the other rhinos accept as family, but won´t come nearer until he is fully changed. Nobody will remember the human Jason but me after he is inside and I´m able to telepathically talk to him, sounding like him so he will think I´m his inner voice.”<br />
<br />
Shortly after finishing Ty heard his class coming over to the rhinos, still talking about Dustin&#39;s cuteness. Ty laughed, if only the old Dustin had heard that comment about himself. Jason held open the door for the class before entering last. He dropped down on all fours the moment he was inside, but nobody noticed him. They walked further in, Jason trotting behind them. Only when the group reached the viewer lounge Jason asked: „Why do you hurry so much? The rhinos will not run away.”<br />
He was sweating as walking on all fours was harder for him. The class turned to the snorting behind them and took in the young rhino with interest. Nobody moved to pet him like they did with Dustin, but Jason got no answer until a girl squealed „How cute”. Not knowing what she meant Jason stood there, still waiting. A caretaker came over, having seen Jason standing there. „How have you got out again, Jason? You will only scare the visitors away.”<br />
Jason didn´t like being pushed away by the caretaker and said so, but all snorting didn´t stop him from being pushed inside the enclosure after Ty moved in fast.<br />
<br />
Jason was too surprised to be inside the enclosure to pound on the door. Like with Dustin, Ty took his time to talk with him. „Hey Jason. Why so surprised? You didn´t think a young rhino like you would get far away from his enclosure and family, do you?”<br />
Jason glanced around to find the source of this voice, saying: „What are you talking about? I´m human and not a rhino, and I need to get out of here again before the other rhinos attack me.”<br />
But while he had looked around and snorted his arms and legs had already started to change, swelling a bit. The skin on the swelled parts turned a similar type of grey Dustin&#39;s had before, the same as the other rhinos in the enclosure. Because Jason had worn shorts and a t-shirt with nearly no sleeves there wasn´t anything to rip while the swelling continued towards his hands and feet. Jason slowly moved back to the door, having landed a bit in the enclosure when he was pushed inside. The couple of steps went really slow for him, and by the time he reached the door again his hands cramped together into cloven-hooves, making pounding on the door impossible. At the same time the sandals he wore had snapped open and had fallen off, leaving his feet bare as he hadn´t worn socks. Jason looked down at his hands turned hooves in shock while they were covered in grey, rough skin.<br />
<br />
Ty used this to speak again to him. „Human? You a human? A human has hands with fingers and walks upright, other than you, young rhino. You walk on your four legs with cloven-hooves and can´t grab anything with them. You are clearly a rhino and no human, Jason.”<br />
Jason replied, snorting loudly in panic: „No, help me. I´m human and something is happening to me. Help! I´m not a rhino, so help me, please.”<br />
But nobody came as nobody understood his snorting. Like Dustin his body started to swell bigger, stretching his shorts and t-shirt until both got tears first before bursting open, leaving him for a couple of seconds in his stretchy boxers. It was uncomfortable for his growing tail in the boxers until they too ripped away, freeing the tail. His mass grows not as much as Dustin&#39;s had; a rhino was smaller than an elephant after all.<br />
<br />
When the swelling and growing stopped, Jason looked like a young rhino with a human head, his cock and balls hidden through his body mass. When his head started to change his blond locks fell to the ground first, leaving him bald. His nose and mouth grow outwards into a big snout, the nose itself growing upwards at the end into his majestic horn. His eyes grow a bit while his ears turned into long, flat ones at the side of his head.<br />
With his head finished Ty spoke loud in his mind again: “There, young rhino Jason, do you still believe you are a human? No human has a horn like that or is as grey and thick skinned as you are. You are a rhino and have always been one. So, let that dream of being a boring human go with the cum you will shoot out now for the first time in your life, young rhino.” Ty then added his next wish out loud but unheard by anyone while Jason snorted a fit again, crying for help. “I wish that Jason will shoot his cum out while his cock and balls change. While the cum leaves his body so does his humanity, but his mind will stay intact. He will gain new memories for his life as a rhino as well as new instincts, but his old ones will remain at the back of his being. The shreds of clothing will vanish from the enclosure now that they weren´t needed anymore.”<br />
Jason could feel the pressuring need to cum grow inside his groin until he shot the full load out. He instantly lost any control of his body as the rhino came into existence. Unbeknownst to Jason the shreds of his clothes faded away, leaving nothing behind. He fought back against the rhino-mind, screaming mentally at it: “Let me go, I´m not a rhino, I´m human, please. Just let me turn back.”<br />
The rhino-mind was calm and strong as it replied: “We are a rhino and finally old enough to mate. We need to let go of that desired dream of being human, Jason is a strong rhino.” He snorted happily as his family came nearer, moving towards them himself.<br />
<br />
Jason was slowly being pushed back by the new memories and instincts of his new rhino-self, which also resulted in part of him accepting being a rhino now. But he didn´t let go of his human self, even as it is buried deep down in his mind. Ty smiled at the happy rhino Jason had become and as he engaged his new family, while Ty moved out of the enclosure, already looking for who to change into what next.</p>
