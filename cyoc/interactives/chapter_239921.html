<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;This creature has uprooted the lives before us. It must be stopped before it&#39;s too late,&quot; Milo said. &quot;Well said, my lord,&quot; Elixar replied. The tiger then began to use his magic to attempt to lactate the hippo man. &quot;Wait, what has uprooted lives?&quot; Claire asked. &quot;I&#39;ll explain on the way,&quot; Kemo said.  <br />
<br />
As they left, they ran into a lizard in a knight outfit. Milo explained that they needed the horse, to which the lizard agreed. Elixar then used his magic to seal the building, Claire was amazed she technically owned it. The vixen then hopped on the lizard&#39;s horse as they rode down the street. &quot;okay I know we need to stop this maniac but how do we even find him?&quot; Claire asked. Elixar then responded as his eyes glowed. &quot;when I first saw him I blasted him with my magic. The spell I used allows me to track every time he switches locations. he is not far off&quot;. The four adventurers then came across an interesting site. It was a bridge that was halfway changed. &quot;I take it this is the edge of the dream,&quot; Milo said. The sorcerer nodded and the four of them rode across the bridge.  <br />
<br />
Everyone but Elixar felt amazed when they got to the city on the other side, apart from some glances they were treated like they were normal. The glances did make Kemo a little uncomfortable. However the curse made it look like he was enjoying it. &quot;well, Elixar, where to next?&quot; Kemo asked. Raising his hand Elixar found it difficult to narrow down. &quot;he is transporting rapidly to find a dream he can exploit&quot; The tiger&#39;s eyes widened as he whispered &quot;No&quot;. Curious Milo asked what was wrong. &quot;he&#39;s at a college, the college your brother attends&quot;. Milo realized the horror that could befall his brother. While Milo had been an only child, Melody had an older brother, Simon. &quot;we need to hurry, if we lose him now there is no telling where he&#39;ll go&quot; Milo shouted. The four raced across the streets. Narrowing avoiding vehicles, except Kemo. With his Grimmboar being bigger he was stuck in traffic. To make matters worse several girls were taking pictures of him. &quot;I hope this can be undone,&quot; he said.  <br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Professor Andersions&#39;s lectures because they were so boring. While it was important to learn history, her voice made it hard to stay awake. For Simon, it was too much. He hadn&#39;t slept well last night because some idiots in the next room over had an all-night jam session. As a result, he was now drooling on a textbook and having a wacky dream.  <br />
<br />
In it, he was at some kind of rave. In it, he was dancing with the head cheerleader he had a massive crush on. She then led him to another room. To his confusion, it looked like a bedroom. Then in a blink of an eye, he was bound to it and naked. Around the bed, several male creatures grinned, including a hippo with a dream catcher necklace. His crush then walked toward him. With each movement, she became more like the creatures even changing genders. The male creature then touched his chest and he saw breast form on him as wool surrounded it. That was when he was jolted awake by the girl next to him. Looking down he saw the hippo man in the reflective surface of his drool. Turning his head he saw nothing. Looking back at the drool he saw nothing there. However, he did feel his chest becoming irritated. <br />
<br />
In the door&#39;s glass window, the hippo man grinned. It had several dreams it had made come true, with some alterations. However, this was its first nightmare. This boy had such fear about being dominated. &quot;Euret moc maerd a otni raef s&#39;yob sight ekam ot emit,&quot; he said. <br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Simon couldn&#39;t help but feel disturbed by his dream. He tried ignoring it but it kept popping up in his mind. As Miss Anderson continued her lecture he suddenly got a sniff of his crush&#39;s perfume. Confused at this he looked around but didn&#39;t see her. he did however feel his chest getting wet. Looking down he silenced a gasp about to come from his mouth. Two damp patches were on his chest. Panicking he ran out of the class and straight to the first bathroom he saw, without knowing it he ran into the girl&#39;s bathroom by mistake.  <br />
<br />
Inside a stall, he pulled off her shirt. To his horror he saw beasts growing from his chest and wool surrounding them. he touched them and found them incredibly sensitive. He let out a moan as they squirted out milk. His body began to transform rapidly as he groped them. White wool covered him head to toe causing him to become uncomfortable in his pants. With lust clouding his mind he took them off to see an interesting sight. His cock was separating into two as it merged with his testicles. Their functions were mutated from cum to milk as they became teets like an actual sheep. Behind them, a new opening came to be. Above her ass a small lamb&#39;s tail grew. Her fingers and toes soon became hoofs, with a smaller hoof acting as her thumbs.  Finally, her head changed from a young male to a sheep. His ears elongated as they moved to the top of his head. His hair turned white and merged with the wool. Finally, she gained a muzzle as she bleated like a sheep. Simone stopped herself when she smelled her crushed perfume. Hearing a door close she peaked through the stall. There was her crush. However, she didn&#39;t look as appealing as in the dream. Thankfully this would soon pass. <br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Megan rushed into the bathroom as her vagina hurt for some reason. It felt too soon for her period yet she couldn&#39;t think of it as anything else. As she went to the mirror she swore she saw a humanoid hippo in the reflection and quickly turned around. Finding nothing she looked back and saw the figure was gone. &quot;I must be sick or something,&quot; she said.  <br />
<br />
Sniffing the air she suddenly smelt her dad&#39;s grilled chicken which couldn&#39;t be. Feeling a tickling sensation she looked at her arm and gasped. Black hair the same color as her hair was sprouting across her arm. She then saw it appear on her other arm. She was so confused she didn&#39;t notice one of the stalls open. What she did notice was a bulge forming on her crotch, as she reached for her dress her nails on all four limbs sharpened into claws. As she lifted her skirt his ears also lifted as they became pointed. By now the hair on her arms had become a nice coat of fur. Once she lifted it she was horrified to see a bulging cock straining her panties. Her mind became filled with lust as she accidentally ripped the front of her skirt apart. Her muscles grew as fur covered her legs. Seeing a sheep anthro in her reflection made her think of putting her pointed cock into its mouth.  <br />
<br />
However, she still had enough consciousness to freak out when she saw her. Her cock on the other hand surged at the sheep&#39;s sight tearing through her panties. Simone was pleased to see Megan had grown a cock. Deciding she&#39;d be a perfect mate the sheep groped its breasts to help Megan&#39;s transformation. &quot;do you like what you see?&quot; she said. This made Megan&#39;s cock throb as it became more canine-like. Her new paws broke out of her high heels, yet they stayed in the same position. Her face began to push out as her resistance began to cave. &quot;no, get those... wonderful things... closer&quot; Megan said. Her resolve quickly changed as her torso began to expand. Her tank tore a bit as her cock gained its knot. Her clothing continued to rip as her tongue hung out of her mouth. The sheep took this time to tease her as she rubbed her hand over her cock. From her behind Megan gained a tail slowly. Her clothing was barely hanging together. The remains of her skirt now lay on the floor as the last trace of her panties was spread out by a growing sack filled with two orbs. Her tank broke apart in ribbons as Simone dropped to her knees and breathed on his cock as his testicles broke the last article of cloth. By now Megan&#39;s legs had fully changed along with his crotch.  <br />
<br />
Megan then demanded the sheep to lick her to which Simone obliged. His beasts began we almost gone and a row of nipples ran down his front. He could feel himself about to come as a male for the first time, with his changes almost done Simone decided to make his first organism as a dude memorable. She presented her dripping pussy to him and the wolf was eager to reply. He plunged his cock into her and began humping. The last of his breasts disappeared as his hair tie broke. His head quickly gained fur as his muzzle finished growing. His nose became triangular and were as his teeth sharpened. He howled as she bleated. Thankfully his knot hadn&#39;t gone in so they got up separately.  <br />
<br />
&quot;that was amazing,&quot; Magnus said. &quot;well mate what shall we do now?&quot; Simone felt a bond with the wolf and would follow him anywhere. Grinning he said, &quot;Well an alpha needs a pack and I know just who to join&quot;. The two grinned as they left. Appearing in the mirror again the hippo man smirked. &quot;redaerps gnilliw a ,yllanif&quot; he said. He then disappeared to follow the two.</p>
