<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Hey, buddy, you okay?&quot; Steve&#39;s gruff voice pierced the chilly night air as he stepped out of the shadows. The college guy stumbled, his eyes half-lidded and bleary from one too many drinks. He&#39;d stumbled out of the neon-lit gay bar, the bass thumping in time with his unsteady heartbeat.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m fine,&quot; the college guy slurred, waving Steve off with a shaky hand. He stumbled forward, his legs unsteady as if he were navigating a sea of jello. The scent of his arousal mixed with fear wafted towards Steve, setting his senses on fire. The moon above was a mere sliver, but it was enough to make Steve&#39;s fur bristle with anticipation. He licked his chops, his teeth sharp as knives.<br />
<br />
Steve took a step closer, his massive, hair-covered body looming over the college guy. The poor soul had stumbled into the wrong alley, but Steve wasn&#39;t about to let him go without a little fun. With surprising agility for his size, he pounced, grabbing the college guy around the waist and hoisting him into the air. The guy yelped, his heart racing like a wild rabbit caught in the jaws of a predator. Steve&#39;s cock grew harder at the sound, standing tall.<br />
<br />
&quot;Looks like you could use some help getting home,&quot; Steve said with a predatory smile, his teeth gleaming in the dim streetlight. The college guy squirmed in his grasp, his breath coming in shallow gasps. He could feel the heat of Steve&#39;s body, the fur brushing against his bare skin making him shiver with a mix of terror and excitement. He hadn&#39;t signed up for this kind of adventure when he left the dorm that night.<br />
<br />
Steve&#39;s eyes glowed a fierce amber, his pupils narrowing to slits as he took in the college guy&#39;s delicious scent. The guy&#39;s eyes widened when he felt Steve&#39;s cock, thick and hot, pressing against his thigh. &quot;What the fuck are you?&quot; he managed to get out, his voice trembling.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s just say I&#39;m more than meets the eye,&quot; Steve chuckled, his breath hot and pungent with the scent of his inner beast. He didn&#39;t bother to hide his true nature; the college guy was too intoxicated to put up much of a fight, and Steve was too horny to care about the details.<br />
<br />
He slammed the college guy against the brick wall of the alley, his cock now fully erect and pulsing with need. The guy gasped, his body sandwiched between Steve&#39;s rock-hard abs and the unforgiving surface. Steve&#39;s fur was coarse and warm, a stark contrast to the cold air that surrounded them. The guy&#39;s heart hammered in his chest as he felt Steve&#39;s clawed hands roam over his body, tearing away the fabric of his clothes as if they were mere tissue paper.<br />
<br />
&quot;P-please,&quot; he stuttered, trying to push Steve away, but his strength was no match for the werewolf&#39;s. Steve chuckled darkly, his tongue lolling out to lick the college guy&#39;s neck. The salty taste of sweat and fear only served to excite him more. &quot;You&#39;re going to love this,&quot; he murmured, his breath hot against the guy&#39;s ear.<br />
<br />
The college guy&#39;s body quivered as Steve&#39;s claws traced the contours of his ass, the sharp tips of his claws digging in just enough to make him yelp. Steve&#39;s massive cock pulsed, eager to claim its prize. With a powerful thrust, he tore through the last barrier of fabric and skin, burying himself to the hilt in the college guy&#39;s tight, unprepared hole. The guy&#39;s scream echoed through the alley, a mix of pain and shock. Steve didn&#39;t slow down; he fucked him hard and fast, his hips smacking against the college guy&#39;s ass with a rhythmic intensity that seemed to shake the very walls around them.<br />
<br />
The college guy&#39;s eyes rolled back in his head as Steve&#39;s cock stretched him wider than he&#39;d ever been before. The werewolf&#39;s thick shaft was unlike anything he&#39;d ever experienced, a deliciously painful intrusion that seemed to fill him up completely. His own cock, hard and leaking precum, slapped against his stomach with every thrust. The pain was intense, but there was something else there, a spark of pleasure that grew with each powerful push.<br />
<br />
Steve&#39;s fur ruffled with the exertion, his muscles bulging and flexing as he claimed his prey. The sound of their bodies colliding, the wet slap of fur on skin, filled the air. The college guy&#39;s nails scraped at the bricks, leaving trails of blood as he tried to find purchase. His mind swam with a confusing mix of fear and arousal, the alcohol in his system doing nothing to dull the sensations.<br />
<br />
With a feral growl, Steve reached around to wrap a fur-covered hand around the college guy&#39;s cock, stroking in time with his thrusts. The college guy&#39;s body jerked, his moans now a blend of pain and pleasure. He couldn&#39;t believe what was happening, but his body was responding in a way that was undeniable. His cock grew harder, his orgasm building like a volcano about to erupt.<br />
<br />
The alley was a cacophony of Steve&#39;s grunts and the college guy&#39;s gasps, their harsh breaths mixing with the scent of sex and fear. The werewolf&#39;s grip tightened, his claws digging into the guy&#39;s hips as he pounded into him with a ferocity that seemed inhuman. The college guy&#39;s eyes watered, his body a canvas of pain and ecstasy.<br />
<br />
Steve felt his climax approaching, his balls tightening, the base of his cock pulsing. He increased his pace, each thrust more powerful than the last. The college guy&#39;s whimpers grew louder, his body trembling as Steve brought him to the edge. With a final, bone-rattling roar, Steve released his seed deep inside the college guy, his hot cum flooding his insides. The feeling was overwhelming, a mix of pain and pleasure so intense it was almost unbearable.<br />
<br />
As Steve&#39;s orgasm subsided, the college guy&#39;s body began to convulse, his own climax ripping through him. He shot his load onto the alley floor, the white-hot pleasure of it making his vision swim. Steve&#39;s cock remained buried inside him, the two of them locked in a moment of primal connection.<br />
<br />
The college guy felt something strange happening to him, something more than just the aftermath of a brutal fuck. His skin began to itch and tingle, and he looked down to see dark hairs sprouting from his body. Panic set in as his eyes widened, and he tried to pull away, but Steve&#39;s grip was like a vice. &quot;W-what are you doing to me?&quot; he gasped, his voice barely above a whisper.<br />
<br />
Steve chuckled, his cock still buried deep. &quot;I&#39;m giving you a little something extra,&quot; he said, his voice a low growl. &quot;A taste of the nightlife, if you will.&quot; The hair on the college guy&#39;s body grew denser, his muscles began to ache as they stretched and bulged.<br />
<br />
With a final grunt, Steve pulled out, his cock glistening with cum and blood. The college guy slumped against the wall, panting and trembling, his body now considerably hairier.  Steve stepped back, admiring his handiwork. &quot;Looks like you&#39;re going to fit right in,&quot; he said, his voice a mix of amusement and hunger.<br />
<br />
Panic shot through the college guy&#39;s veins like a bolt of lightning. His eyes darted around the alley, searching for an escape. The itching and tingling had become unbearable, and he could feel his body changing in ways that defied explanation. With a snarl of terror, he pushed himself away from the wall, his newfound strength surprising even himself. He bolted down the alley, his legs moving faster than he&#39;d ever thought possible.<br />
<br />
David&#39;s mind raced as he sprinted through the deserted streets, his heart hammering in his chest. His clothes clung to his newly muscular body, which was now getting hairier. He didn&#39;t know how any of this was happening. The werewolf&#39;s grin and the feel of his monstrous cock inside him were burned into his memory like a brand.<br />
<br />
Finally, David staggered through the door of his apartment, slamming it shut and locking it behind him. He dashed into the bathroom, the only place he could think to hide. The cold, harsh light from the bare bulb above the sink washed over him, and he looked into the mirror. His reflection was a horror show. His beard had thickened like it never looked before, ie even grew down his neck that reached his chest, and his previously smooth skin was now a canvas of coarse, curling hair. Even the back of his neck had a dusting of hair.<br />
<br />
But it wasn&#39;t just his face and body that had changed. His cock, already thick and hard from the traumatic encounter, looked...bigger. The shock of it made him stumble back against the sink. It hung heavy and thick between his legs, the shaft a deep red from the intense fucking he&#39;d just endured. He reached down to touch it, his hand shaking, and felt the hair that had grown around the base, matching the new hair that covered the rest of his body. It was a surreal, terrifying sight.<br />
<br />
He tried to ignore his new hair and focused on the way his muscles felt different, stronger, more primal. The way his senses had sharpened. He focused on his cock, now standing tall and proud, the head glistening with pre-cum. It was as if Steve&#39;s seed had changed him, made him more like the monster that had taken him. The thought made his stomach churn, but he couldn&#39;t deny the strange thrill that coursed through him as he took in his new form.<br />
<br />
With trembling hands, David reached down and began to stroke himself. It was almost as if he was in a trance, his mind a whirlwind of fear and excitement. His hand glided over the thick, hairy shaft, feeling the power pulsing through it. He couldn&#39;t believe what was happening to him, but he also couldn&#39;t ignore the growing need deep in his gut.<br />
<br />
He stroked faster, his eyes glued to his reflection in the mirror. The hair on his body grew denser with each pass of his hand, spreading from his cock up his stomach and chest, swathing his body in a furry blanket. His nipples grew hard, surrounded by dark hair that matched the carpet that now covered his chest. His abs rippled with each stroke, the muscles seemingly carved from granite beneath the pelt.<br />
<br />
The sound of his hand on his cock grew wetter, his strokes more frantic. He could feel his orgasm building, a beast waiting to be unleashed. The hair on his arms grew thicker, reaching down to cover his hands, making the motion more erotic, more animalistic. He was no longer David, the college student, but something else entirely. Something feral and powerful.<br />
<br />
With a roar that echoed his inner transformation, David came. Cum shot out of him like a geyser, painting the bathroom in thick, ropy strands. It landed on the sink, the mirror, even the ceiling. His body convulsed with the force of it, his cock pulsing with every spurt. And as he came, the hair grew faster, spreading down his arms, up his neck, across his back. He could feel his body swelling, his muscles bulging as if they were about to tear through his skin.<br />
<br />
But when the orgasm finally passed, leaving him gasping for breath, the hair growth stopped. He looked into the mirror and saw a man who was still himself, but with a hint of the beast that now lurked within. He was hairier than any man he knew, his body a canvas of fur that made him look like a creature from a dark fantasy.<br />
<br />
Exhausted, David stumbled into his bedroom and collapsed onto his bed, the thick hair on his body tickling the sheets. Despite the horror of what had happened, he felt...amazing. The adrenaline rush of the encounter and the transformation left him feeling more alive than he ever had. He closed his eyes, the events of the night playing on a loop in his mind, and fell into a deep sleep.<br />
<br />
When he woke up the next morning, the sun streamed through his window, casting a warm glow across the room. For a moment, he thought it had all been a drunken dream, but as he sat up, the hair on his chest brushed against his face, and he knew it was all too real. He swung his legs over the side of the bed and stood up, feeling his newfound strength in every muscle. His cock hung between his thighs, heavier and longer than he ever remembered. It was still covered in the remnants of his transformation, the hair around the base thick and curly.<br />
<br />
David&#39;s heart raced as he took in the sight of his new body. He had to get to the university, had to get answers. He stumbled into the bathroom, the hair on his legs brushing against the cold tiles as he stepped into the shower. The hot water cascaded over him, steaming the mirror, and he scrubbed himself clean, trying to wash away the memories of the night before. But the scent of Steve&#39;s fur lingered on his skin, a constant reminder of his new reality.<br />
<br />
As he dried off, he stared at his reflection, the water droplets sliding down his furry chest and stomach, and his gaze fell to his cock. It was true, it had grown even bigger overnight. He was both repulsed and fascinated by the transformation. He had to find a way to reverse it, to become human again.<br />
<br />
But first, he needed to get to class. He threw on a loose sweatshirt and sweatpants, hoping they&#39;d be enough to cover his new furry frame. The fabric clung to his muscular thighs, and he felt the extra weight of his cock as he walked. Each step was a reminder of the monster that now lived inside him.</p>
