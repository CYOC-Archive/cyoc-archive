<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">With Jack scared into silence, Kellie was thankfully able to quiet things down. Tatsu and Shizen, while unhappy to see Jack and his demon compatriots, were willing to allow them to remain at the campground if only for the sake of the children they guarded.<br />
<br />
After a tense meeting Kellie called Katie, Gloria and all of their friends together as Lisa and the other adults enjoyed a blissful day on the shore of the lake. Kellie was taking no chances, especially if Merlin was correct. As the groups now gathered Kellie went through the introductions, introducing not only Gloria and Katie’s friends to hers but Jack and his companions to those from the other timeline. Needless to say tension mounted as Sasha and Ayami immediately seemed to be at one another’s throats.<br />
<br />
“How the hell could you transform a sick kid into a freaking werewolf,” Sasha exclaimed as she jabbed a finger into the succubus chest. Ayami growled, her fangs bared as wings sprouted from her back. “Zack was going to die,” she yelled. “But don’t think I can’t kill you kid. Suck the life from your skinny ass like you were a freaking soda.”<br />
<br />
Sasha growled, holding her ring up as she conjured two hands from the floor that now firmly grasped the succubus ankles. “You don’t scare me demon skank,” she snorted. “I’ve been getting pretty good with this thing. Wouldn’t take much magic to snap you in half.”<br />
<br />
“Okay enough you two,” Kellie exclaimed angrily as she stepped in between the two. Sasha and Ayami continued to glare at one another as Sasha magic dissipated. Kellie could only sigh as she now looked between everyone. There was enough magic in this cabin between all of them that they could easily devastated the surrounding forest without much effort. “Look whether you like it or not we are ALL going to have to work together here.”<br />
<br />
“Merlin’s daughter speaks the truth,” Shizen stated as she and Tatsu now gazed down at the sleeping infants. “A greater threat than any of you may have considered is lurking in the shadows.”<br />
<br />
“So mom and dad what exactly does that mean,” Katie asked as she looked between her teenage parents. Jack shrugged from his spot towards the rear of the cabin, he had been keeping his distance from the two divine Kitsune since his arrival. “Your Guess is as good as mine,” he grumbled. “Ask your mom, she seems to be running this show.”<br />
<br />
“Quit being a dick Jack,” Kellie frowned. Katie and her friends could only shake their heads, it seemed Katie’s parents weren’t going to make things easy. Surprisingly it was now Gloria who stepped forward, a determined look on her face. “If I could say something real quick,” she said quietly. Everyone paused as they now looked in the teens direction. Gloria gulped, she had never been very good at public speaking, it was only when Katie and her fiancé stepped forward that she was able to gain some confidence. “Go ahead Glo,” Kel said. Gloria smiled up at the college age woman before looking over the large group.<br />
<br />
“Look I may not know a lot about the other timeline,” she said. “And I may not know what exactly the issue is between Kellie and Jack. Regardless we’re going to have to all work together. Do you two think you can burynthe hatchet and try to get along?”<br />
<br />
Kellie crinkled her nose as she gazed at Jack. The teen had a smug look about him as he gazed at everyone. “What do you say Ms. Pendragon,” he smirked. “You think we can be friends?”<br />
<br />
“How the hell am I supposed to get along with him,” Kellie exclaimed. “One he’s an asshole. Two he’s Morgan LeFays freaking replacement. You realize he’s trying to bring about my destruction and strengthen the darkness right? I mean his mom and Circe already have a park full of anthros.”<br />
<br />
“Don’t tell me your still hung up on anthros,” teen Claudia groaned. <br />
<br />
“Or Kitsune,” the teen Mika added.<br />
<br />
“No of course not,” Kellie exclaimed quickly. “It’s just. I mean. It’s....” Kellie trailed off her shoulders slumping as she let out a loud sigh. “Crap I’ve become what I’m worried about. I’ve freaking turned into Jack.” Shaking her head she now took a breath as she strode towards Jack, a determined look on her face. Jack for his part gave her a look of surprise as Kellie extended her hand. “Listen Jack,” she said firmly. “From now on we work together. All the light and dark stuff. All the scheming. All the plans to take out the other side it ends now. We all work together to balance the powers that be.”<br />
<br />
Jack gave Kellie a curious look before a small smile spread across his face. “Deal,” he said as he now shook Kellies hand. “Does this mean you’ll go on a date with me?”<br />
<br />
“Don’t push it,” Kellie grumbled through gritted teeth.<br />
<br />
“Hold on,” Ayami exclaimed. “In case you haven’t noticed, me and Rexie are freaking demons. We do evil. We’re not trying to play nice here.”<br />
<br />
“Don’t play nice then,” teen Katie responded. “But know this. For every evil thing you do. Well do something good. None of us are going to let you two cause too much mischief.”<br />
<br />
“And if they don’t stop you don’t think I won’t have any problem coming here to stop you,” Sasha bellowed. Ayami and Rexie gave the teen girl an odd look before looking at Gloria. “Is she always like this,” Rexie asked.<br />
<br />
“Only when she thinks someone is up to no good,” Gloria said. “And from the sound things you two are definitely up to no good.” Rexie smirked as the imp turned to leave. “Fair enough,” she smiled. “Now if you excuse me, Mia and Zack are going on a hike in the woods, can’t let anything happen to the girl. What kind of familiar would I be without a master.” With that the imp changed once more, shrinking down into a small tabby cat that proceeded to bound out of the cabin.<br />
<br />
As the meeting concluded Kellie, Katie, Gloria and their friends seemed to reach an agreement. All sides would work closely with one another. While they may not all get along, they would look out for one another and continue training. As Kellie finished casting her protective spells on the infants she looked towards her daughter Katie. “So interesting day huh?”<br />
<br />
“That’s putting it lightly,” Katie giggled as she looked at her mother. “Never would of expected to have a meeting with a succubus, an imp, and a Kitsune god.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah my timeline has its moments,” Kellie smiled. “Still, it’s good that we’re all going to be looking out for one another. Your sister Gloria certainly seems to have a a way of talking with people.”<br />
<br />
Katie smiled as she thought of her step sister Gloria. “Yeah she has a good head on her shoulders,” she said happily. “She continues to amaze me with how mature she is.”<br />
<br />
For the last night of the vacation Kellie and the others now found themselves gathered around a campfire. The groups huddled around it for warmth as they talked of the coming year. Katie and her fiancé would be marrying in the winter while Gloria and her friends would be Sophmores in high school. Kellie, Jack and there finds would also have an interesting year ahead of them. The group would be upper class men now, high school would be a distant memory in only two years. Kellie now gazed at Jack, the warlock smiled as he now watched the others talk. What would become of Kellie and Jack now that their hostilities had ended? The two warring factions would be working closer together now. Could it be possible that Kellie and Jack might actually have a friendly relationship? <br />
<br />
Kellie chuckled softly as she shook her head. That didn’t seem likely. Whatever the year held for her though, she realized that things would most certainly be interesting.</p>
