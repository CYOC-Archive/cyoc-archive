<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The girls, led by Melissa, surrounded Jennifer giggling at the jiggling cheerleader.<br />
<br />
If you want to be slim once again you have to get the hottest boy to make out with you. <br />
<br />
Derry McClaine?<br />
<br />
He didn't like me when I was hot he will never make out with me now!<br />
<br />
Well that is what will make you slim once again.<br />
<br />
Now Derry was a hot muscle stud. Not overly pumped but he had a nice six pack, long flowing hair in somewhat <br />
of an updated mullet. He would get 5 o'clock shadow at 10 am. His chest was as furry as a bear but thank god <br />
his back was as smooth as a new born baby. He had deep penetrating baby blue eyes and if old wives tales were <br />
true his size 14 shoes would make him very well endowed.<br />
<br />
Jennifer started to cry.<br />
<br />
She was going to be this big fat pig forever.<br />
<br />
The girls had planned on this event and took out one of those Hawaiian print moo moo.<br />
<br />
It was the only thing that would fit over her now voluptuous form.<br />
<br />
She ran and hid in a janitor closet and sobbed for hours when she was exhausted she fell asleep and was <br />
wakened by the janitor who caressed her gently to waken her.<br />
<br />
Are you ok Miss?<br />
<br />
Yea.<br />
<br />
His touch really made her forget her sorrows for a bit and as she and the janitor sat and talked he started to <br />
feel up her dress and caress her ample folds.<br />
<br />
This made her body tingle with anticipation and it wasn't long before this stinky fat man and Jennifer were <br />
making out in the closet. He had locked the door to keep anyone from slipping in on them. When he came so did <br />
Jennifer. She had never cum simultaneously with her lover and the sheer passion of their embrace was more <br />
intense than any she could have imagined.<br />
<br />
When she got her breath back and realized what she had done she looked at the janitor grabbed her moo moo and <br />
threw it over her head and ran out the door.<br />
<br />
Sobbing and not knowing exactly where she was headed she rounded the corner near the equipment room in the gym <br />
and there she ran straight into Derry.<br />
<br />
Holding on to each other to keep from falling to the floor he asked, what's wrong?<br />
<br />
I am just so upset. <br />
<br />
Why?<br />
<br />
I just did something I shouldn't have and I already regret it.<br />
<br />
What did you do?<br />
<br />
It's too embarrassing.<br />
<br />
The embrace between Derry and Jennifer had already become way too long and Jennifer could feel his hands <br />
moving their way over her back.<br />
<br />
Are you ok? Jennifer asked Derry.<br />
<br />
Yea why wouldn't I be.<br />
<br />
Just wondering.<br />
<br />
His hands were moving in and out of her folds and Jennifer could feel his muscular chest pressed against her <br />
massive mamories.<br />
<br />
Was this foreplay with Derry?<br />
<br />
Jennifer was so confused. Was Derry a chubby chaser? Was that why you never saw Derry with a girlfriend just <br />
with groups of girls?<br />
<br />
Oh Derry your my hero, Jennifer blurted out and gave him a kiss right on his lips.<br />
<br />
His tongue shot into her mouth and they squeezed their way into the equipment room.<br />
<br />
Now twice in under an hour she was making out with a man in her new form. She had never had this much action <br />
when she was a hot cheerleader and their climax was as intense as the one she had just had with the janitor.<br />
<br />
As they  sat naked in the equipment room, Jennifer nestled in his rugged arms she notice her chest becoming <br />
flatter. Her booty becoming flatter. Her belly becoming trim and her double chins and her rounded face <br />
slimming down.<br />
<br />
Oh no she screamed in her head. She now was getting slim just like the girls had said but it was the tingling <br />
that she was feeling that was unlike her first transformation into the blubbery butt.<br />
<br />
Between her legs her vagina was becoming a long penis and her chest was growing hair. She felt her face grow <br />
rough and begin to itch against Derry's chest. She got rock hard abs and was soon the mirror image of Derry.<br />
<br />
But Derry was changing as well. He was rounding out. His chest blew up to massive tits. His belly shot out and <br />
his hips rounded. Soon Derry was the mirror image of what Jennifer had been.<br />
<br />
They had switched bodies. But their minds were still there. Fully conscious of the changes they had gone <br />
through.<br />
<br />
What happened Derry screamed in his now feminine high pitched voice.<br />
<br />
Jennifer started to cry in her new body this was just as bad as when they made her fat. She didn't want to be <br />
a boy. She liked men and couldn't see herself making out with girls.<br />
<br />
Jennifer tried to explain the transformation that had happened to her and the change that Melissa had said <br />
would happen if she and Derry would make out. She hadn't thought that would mean they would change bodies. <br />
Jennifer thought it meant that she would get her old body back.<br />
<br />
Derry put on the moo moo and Jennifer put on Derry's clothes.<br />
<br />
What were they going to do about this now? They thought about making out again and seeing if that would change <br />
them back but they decided to go back to Melissa and see if she would change them back.<br />
<br />
But Melissa was not very nice and her conditions she made were next to impossible but Derry and Jennifer were <br />
going to try to make it happen.<br />
<br />
It wasn't long before the found out that Derry was pregnant with the Janitor's baby.</p>
