<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Now after i Danillignatious had turned the mortal human James <br />
<br />
Peabody into the fearcesome dragon beast Jamignatious,it had come as<br />
<br />
a pleasant surprise to me to discover that she was eager to remain in<br />
<br />
a dragon form,rather then return to her former pitiful human existance.<br />
<br />
Thus i had remembered a isolated bog where she could sleep as safely<br />
<br />
as a dragon can these days.While she curled herself up in  the cool muck,and <br />
<br />
her eyes dimmed as she dreamed,i had some thinking to do.<br />
<br />
       I had become Lady Gywnes dragon familiar after i realize Sir Mortimer,the<br />
<br />
Kings son was iin love with her.I myself had once been a guard dragon of the <br />
<br />
realms treasury,and after i had been slain by a neer do well named Siegfried, had<br />
<br />
found myself unemployed and without a body.Thus when Gywne had called me up <br />
<br />
during one of her rituals i found myself in her employ.Knowing the contents of the<br />
<br />
treasury and Gywnes choice of lovers,i felt we would go places together.It was a dirty rotten <br />
<br />
trick she played on me by bonding me to James Peabody.Listening to his inner thoughts<br />
<br />
on Planks theorems made me want to hurl myself on the nearest sword to end the torment.<br />
<br />
            However he did have a good selection of alchemy scrolls on the human<br />
<br />
anatomy and after a while i realized i could remake him in my image.The problem was <br />
<br />
it was her body and Jamignatious got final say on what it did.I could force the issue <br />
<br />
if she were sleepy  or by other trickery,but ultimately i would have to find a new home.<br />
<br />
The simplest method would be to get her pregnant and claim the forming infants <br />
<br />
body for my own.Thus while she slept that first night i thought about where the nearest grouping <br />
<br />
of males could be found.<br />
<br />
             The next morning i woke her up early with a clamouring in her head.I wanted her up in<br />
<br />
the early light and high up in the sky where no human arrow could reach her.She was an<br />
<br />
eager trusting thing and was more then happy to fly to the mountain range i<br />
<br />
directed her to.Along the way she practised her rolls and her flamebreathing,so<br />
<br />
that by the time she swooped into the lair of the Greensparrow boys she<br />
<br />
greeted them like old friends.<br />
<br />
        Now dragons have a different reproductive cycle then humans and the ratio<br />
<br />
of males to females in the population is 25 to 1.This has led to a different culture<br />
<br />
amongst our race.There is much male to male bonding,male macho and harems consist <br />
<br />
of males waiting on the sexual needs of the female.Being a male dragons world,there<br />
<br />
isn't too much maternal love or concerns for a females needs.<br />
<br />
              The Greensparrow clan had spotted this lone female from miles away and<br />
<br />
couldn't believe one of the richer clans had let her go.They just stood there in shock <br />
<br />
as she swooped in.Perhaps she was playing a trick on them and had merely wandered off<br />
<br />
from a vast and powerful clan to the south.If that was the case,they'd have to be careful<br />
<br />
around her.They snarled and grunted their questions and were surprised when she spoke<br />
<br />
perfect latin,which no dragon could do.They slowly got the picture that she wasn't under<br />
<br />
anyones protection and wasn't quite the beast she appeared.That meant of course she<br />
<br />
knew nothing about mating rights or their less then honourable intentions.Slowly they <br />
<br />
primed her with mead and draped gold chains around her neck and poured jewels<br />
<br />
along her scaly hide.<br />
<br />
             Meanwhile they were sealing off the escape routes and posting guards.<br />
<br />
There really weren't any rules of rape,so the biggest male growled at her sweet nothings<br />
<br />
just before he rolled her over on her back ,spread her legs apart and plunged his barbed shaft into <br />
<br />
her vent.Jamignatious screamed and roared,but the boys held her slashing legs,wings,tail and head <br />
<br />
down while grampa released his dragon seed into her.Then the rest of the boys had a go at her<br />
<br />
and did their darndest to make sure she'd keep their line going.<br />
<br />
         As her rape continued her voice grew more incoherent and she snarled and growled more<br />
<br />
as the night went on.Her former human mind was breaking up and reforming into that of a <br />
<br />
snarling roaring dragoness.By the time they were finished with her her eyes blazed with <br />
<br />
the fury of a savage beast,not that of James Peabody the alchemist.It would be much better<br />
<br />
that way.I wanted a mother who could defend me and find prey,not one who could teacher me letters.<br />
<br />
                I  entered the only fertilized female egg within her and went to sleep.Nine months later<br />
<br />
i slid out of her birth canal along with the others and Jamignatious roared at the others as<br />
<br />
she placed me protectively under her chest,where i found a nipple swollen with milk.She <br />
<br />
still remembered her forced mating and wanted to keep an eye out for her daughter.<br />
<br />
The years flew by and Jamignatious learned the basics of mammal noisemaking,or at least <br />
<br />
enough to scare away the mammals or trick one into coming close enough so that she could<br />
<br />
lash out and snatch it in her maw.<br />
<br />
            When one of her sons Dansallignatious fused with a evil human wizard we were <br />
<br />
happy to adopt the human into our clan,and King Lothar changed his name to King <br />
<br />
GreensparrowlOur clan would finally have access to a realms treasury and we kept a close watch <br />
<br />
on our adopted clansmens well being.We thought he did an excellent job reigning over the mammals<br />
<br />
but there was a revolt and he had to flee.We were waiting for him in the bogs  and arrived just in<br />
<br />
time to view a human hero plunge a sword through his chest.<br />
<br />
                We had seen that the mammals were dangerous and waited till they were well away<br />
<br />
from my injured brother.Then i scooped him up in my arms and flew him to the clans<br />
<br />
lair as quickly as possible.I didn't want him ending up as a dragon familiar in Lady Gywnes employ.</p>
