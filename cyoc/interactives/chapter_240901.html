<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Content warning: mention of farts</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Lace turned the key in the door to Ash&#39;s apartment pushing his way into the abode. The smell of weed and leftover pizza hitting him like a brick as he stepped in. Lace had learned pretty quickly both Ash and her roommate Kiana were pretty big stoners. Not that he minded, he even joined them from time to time. Walking into the living room he found Kiana lounging on the sofa wearing nothing but an oversized t-shirt with some pink panties just barely peeking out into view. With a pipe in hand and her face glued to the tv Lace could tell she was already high as a kite.<br />
<br />
He liked Kiana; she was nice enough, even if she did have trouble remembering his name. She usually struggled for a bit before just settling on calling him Ash&#39;s panties. Her and Ash were close, close enough to share most things including him. Kiana had already borrowed him twice now, but Lace had no complaints; he found her quite cute after all. Although he was pretty sure he was a few sizes too big for her.<br />
<br />
She was a petite girl a full foot shorter than him, or at least she was when he met her. The more he transforms the more inches he seems to lose off his “true form”. She was mixed race; her skin being a darker caramel color, and her hair kept in loose shoulder length locs. Her Bloodshot eyes made contact with his and she yelled out to her roommate. “Ash, your panties are home!”<br />
<br />
“Nice to see you too, Kiana.” He threw both of the manila envelopes down on the coffee table. “I need a shower. Can you make sure Ash reads the folder with her name on it.”<br />
<br />
Before Ash had time to come greet him he was already in the bathroom. It had been a few days since he was last here but the place was already a mess. The hamper was already overflowing; Lace&#39;s eyes zeroing in on the number of discarded worn panties amongst the heap. He sighed to himself. The girls were putting off a trip to the laundromat again. Ash would probably want to wear him soon then. <br />
<br />
If she waits until laundry day to do it he&#39;ll probably have to spend at least a week in that same hamper. Ash isn&#39;t going to make a trip to the laundromat without a full load after all. He could turn back beforehand, but without being washed any lingering stains or odors will be carried over to his human form. <br />
<br />
Lace&#39;s shower was quick; with it mostly just being an excuse to scrub his face of any lingering essence of psycho professor ass. Nowadays showers could never really make him feel clean, not like the way a trip through the laundry machine does. Even so Lace takes them anyway if only to cling to that human side of him.<br />
<br />
Stepping out of the shower Lace made his way to Ash&#39;s room clad only in a towel. He had stashed some spare clothes there a while ago. He had been spending more and more time here after all. Not only was he excited to hang out with Ash and Kiana both as panties and their friend, but his own apartment was becoming hostile. Lace&#39;s own roommate Jordan was not only an incel but a raging male supremacist at that. Every time he went home he was met with another lecture about how he was the “Ultimate Cuck”, or that Men were supposed to be the ones who owned “females”. <br />
<br />
Opening up her closet He picked out a pair of shorts and his favorite band tee-shirt. Lace took in a deep breath of the scent of the shirt: It smelled like her, just like the rest of her clothes. It was strangely comforting to Lace. He knew he was the same way both in his panty and even his human form his scent had been changed. Permanently branded by Ash&#39;s choice in detergent, in fabric softener, in body wash. He knew it should be disturbing to him along with all the other slow creeping changes his life with her was bringing, but the sense of peace it brought him was becoming just too addictive.<br />
<br />
Lace checked Ash&#39;s underwear drawer and as he thought it was mostly empty. Sure enough his turn in the rotation would be up soon. There were a few of his older “sisters” whose elastic had mostly worn out and were starting to sport a few holes but it was otherwise mostly empty. Those pairs were like elders to him in a way. Some of them were pairs Ash had owned since high school. She had been talking about needing to go through and replace them and Lace silently admitted to himself that it upset him a bit. But when he looked at them now he could have sworn he felt a feeling of contentment in them.<br />
<br />
Lace walked out into the living room where Kiana and now Ash both were. Kiana is still fully engrossed in watching her cartoons although now she had a plate of nachos she had door dashed. Ash meanwhile is busy reading through both her and Lace&#39;s envelope. Lace plopped down between the two of them and happily took a few chips when offered. “So what did the professor have to say to you?”<br />
<br />
“There&#39;s a lot. She included a summary of your visit. It says here you underwent flatulent exposure therapy?” Her eyebrow arched.<br />
<br />
“Yeah she sat on my face almost the entire time. She said she was testing whether or not I was actually ready to be your panties.” Lace replied his stomach turning as he remembered the torture he endured earlier that very day. <br />
<br />
“That&#39;s hilarious.” Ash and Kiana both giggled. “So you had to just sit there while this lady ripped farts in your face for an hour?”<br />
<br />
“Ugh yeah it was disgusting.” Lace pouted as his face grew red. “She kept going on about how being panties isn&#39;t about sexuality or whatever.”<br />
<br />
“Well she&#39;s not exactly wrong you know.” Kiana managed to squeeze out between chuckles. “I mean don&#39;t get me wrong bro you&#39;re quite cute but you&#39;re still more of the everyday comfort style of panties rather than the seduce a man style. Taking farts is a pretty major part of your job.”<br />
<br />
“I know that.” Lace responded defensively. Truly he was well aware that his primary function as underwear was to help keep the rest of Ash&#39;s clothes clean. It still embarrassed him to talk about it out loud though. “It doesn&#39;t mean I like huffing some strangers farts though.”<br />
<br />
“Well don&#39;t worry I&#39;ll put in a request with her so you don&#39;t have to do that anymore.” Ash grabbed Lace&#39;s shoulder to comfort her underwear. “The only farts you have to take from now on are mine okay?”<br />
<br />
“Alright.” Lace replied having already accepted that reality weeks ago. “What else did she send?” <br />
<br />
“Instructions for the use and care of human clothing, mostly stuff I already knew.” Ash paused as her eyes scanned the documents. “She does recommend that we no longer turn your mind off though. She says its stifling your development as panties.”<br />
<br />
“She does?” Lace responded with a tinge of hopefulness in his voice.<br />
<br />
“Yeah…” Ash responded with a long sigh. “I had been putting it off because I thought you&#39;d get grossed out, but if you can tank an hour of face farting and still want to be panties then I guess I&#39;ve no excuse. From now on you&#39;ll get the complete experience okay?”<br />
<br />
“You were hoping to get me to the point where I was addicted to you first so I couldn&#39;t run away then?” Lace half accused already having figured out the answer months ago.<br />
<br />
“Ya got me.” Ash admitted. “I&#39;ve wanted a human object since I was a little girl. When I first found you in that basket I decided I wouldn&#39;t take any chances with making you mine.”<br />
<br />
“Did it have to be panties then?” Lace asked curiously.<br />
<br />
“No actually. Originally I wanted a whole house filled with human furniture; just like my mother.” Ash admitted. <br />
<br />
“She&#39;s not lying.” Kiana chimed in. “I&#39;ve been there every seat in her mom&#39;s place is someone&#39;s face.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah” Ash confirmed. “All ex lovers or volunteers she met at conventions. but when I saw you in that basket, well it&#39;s hard to think of you as anything but my underwear.”<br />
<br />
“Well it&#39;s nice to be wanted.” That was the truth. Maybe the entire underlying reason he ended up going along with Ash. Lace grew up with seven siblings. His whole life he always felt like a spare; just one more in an already overcrowded group. Ash asking him to be her panties was probably the first time in his life he felt needed, wanted, useful.<br />
<br />
 He loved feeling useful. He loved being told he was comfy, or cute, or hers. He loved the way Ash looked at him possessively; the way she introduced him as her lucky panties. Yeah he still felt embarrassed about all this. He knew even if Ash wanted him as soon as his symptoms advanced most people would look down on him. They would ignore his value as a man and regard him solely as a possession.<br />
<br />
 A part of him knew he should have put a stop to all of this months ago and walked away the day he turned back. He&#39;d be on his way to getting a degree, finding a wife, settling down and having kids. It was too late now though. His future was in that laundry hamper, in that underwear drawer, and in this pothead’s sweatpants. <br />
<br />
“I&#39;ll sign the custodianship release form if you want.” He said it without thinking, and the look on Ash&#39;s face told him she could tell.<br />
<br />
“You&#39;ve still got a while before your R.T.F.S symptoms prevent you from living a normal life. We can sign that paperwork then.” Ash comforted him. “In the meantime I&#39;m still going to wear you whenever I feel like, but you still need to live the life of Lace the human while you can.” <br />
<br />
“Well then speaking of wearing me I&#39;ve seen you&#39;re putting off laundry again aren&#39;t you too.” Lace changed the subject as he felt he might cry if he lingered on it any more.<br />
<br />
“Busted.” Kiana joked sheepishly.<br />
<br />
“You better not have plans tomorrow.” Lace chastised his owner. “The both of you are going to the laundromat.”<br />
<br />
“But tomorrow&#39;s Saturday.” Ash sarcastically moaned in protest. “I was going to spend the day out.”<br />
<br />
“You can do that in the evening. Tomorrow morning after breakfast it&#39;s laundry day.” Lace doubled down knowing the love for procrastination these two shared<br />
<br />
“Ugh fine but I&#39;m wearing you just so you know.” Ash pouted as if they all didn&#39;t already know that would be the case.<br />
<br />
“That&#39;s fine by me.” Lace admitted secretly, really excited for the chance.<br />
<br />
The trio spent the rest of their night playing games and watching movies together. Ash and Lace both trying and failing to catch up to how high Kiana already was. Lace had come to love nights like these more than anything. He didn&#39;t have too many friends before he met Ash, and the ones he did weren&#39;t exactly of the highest quality either. So the level that both Ash and Kiana both seemed to enjoy his company surprised him.<br />
<br />
The tiny loveseat eventually proved too crowded when Ash decided to pull Lace into her lap. It surprised Lace but he didn&#39;t fight it. More than anything though it reinforced to him just how much size he had lost. When he first met her the two of them were about six feet tall; if anything Lace was probably an inch taller. Now however he must be a full six inches shorter than her. Six months from now and he&#39;ll probably drop below four feet. Another six months after and he&#39;ll finally stop shrinking to six inches at the absolute tallest.<br />
<br />
Kiana watched her roommate pull Lace into her lap and groaned out in annoyance. “Ugh it&#39;s not fair Ash why are you the only one who gets their own human object.”<br />
<br />
Ash rolled her eyes. “Kiki, you&#39;re like a sister to me. You know I&#39;m always happy to share my things.”<br />
<br />
“That&#39;s not what I mean and you know it. I want what you have.” Kiana ranted. “I want a guy who literally gives up being a man to be mine.”<br />
<br />
“Oh, I see…” Ash hummed in understanding.  “Lace, do you know any guys she can have?”<br />
<br />
“My roommate I guess?” Lace struggled to think of anyone else. “He&#39;s kind of a piece of shit though.”<br />
<br />
“Ugh gross no. The only thing that creep would be good for is toilet paper.” She wasn&#39;t wrong, thought Lace. “Why are you even still rooming with him anyway?”<br />
<br />
“We were paired together freshman year. Then there just wasn&#39;t a better option afterwards.” Lace answered. “It was either him or one of my siblings and we&#39;ve all kinda needed the space from each other.”<br />
<br />
“Oh that&#39;s right you have a twin brother don&#39;t you?” Ash wondered aloud between sips of beer. “What about him, Kiki?”<br />
<br />
“Hmm maybe?” She weighed the option. “But I was hoping for some shoes. If he&#39;s your brother he&#39;s probably only good for underwear. No offense of course.”<br />
<br />
“None taken, you&#39;re probably right anyway. underwear is what runs in the family.” Not even just Lace and his father actually. Apparently there&#39;s a vintage pair of bloomers out there that were once his great grandfather too. “You could see if there&#39;s anyone for sale at a thrift store then.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah no I&#39;ll pass on the second hand old guys.” She shot that down. “I want to do to someone what Ash did to you.”<br />
<br />
“what does that mean?” Lace asked, puzzled.<br />
<br />
“Oh you know. I want to take a guy who has no desire to be an object whatsoever and watch as he slowly gives up his humanity to devote himself to being my property.” She said it all so matter-of-factly that it took Lace aback. <br />
<br />
She was right of course; before meeting Ash Lace had never actually given the idea of tfs much of any thought. Even in the early days He would get so annoyed at having to cancel plans every time Ash needed him. Nowadays he doesn&#39;t even question it. Hell before everything about being panties would have him turned him off. Breathing in farts, soaking in sweat and God knows what else, spending weeks at the bottom of the laundry hamper; all of these things disgust him even now, and probably always will. But he&#39;ll endure it not because he wants to, but simply because he&#39;s a pair of underwear and that&#39;s underwear’s purpose. Fuck he hates that that bitch Professor was right about him.<br />
<br />
“It&#39;s kind of predatory, but If you&#39;re dead set on someone who doesn&#39;t want to be an object why don&#39;t you look into fostering someone with spontaneous transformation syndrome?” Ash brought up the same phenomenon the Prof Winters mentioned earlier that day in tf counseling. “Most of those people start off hating what they become. They&#39;re going to spend their whole lives transforming they need someone to teach them to love their new place in life”<br />
<br />
“That could be a good idea actually.” Kiana seemed pleased at the suggestion. “I think there&#39;s a shelter in town. Maybe we can stop by tomorrow after the laundromat?”<br />
<br />
“Sounds good to me, how about you Lace.” Ash asked.<br />
<br />
“I don&#39;t care either way I&#39;ll be in your pants the whole time anyway.” He replied sleepily as exhaustion started to take its toll on him.<br />
<br />
“Alright it&#39;s settled then we&#39;ll go tomorrow.” Ash yawned out as they set the plan in stone. “Now in the meantime I think it&#39;s time for the two of us to go to bed.”<br />
<br />
“Ah sure goodnight you two.” Kiana responded as her roommate shuffled off to bed; practically slinging the exhausted Lace over her shoulder. <br />
<br />
Ash threw Lace on the bed before making her way to the bathroom to practice her nightly routine. Lace was content to browse his phone while he waited for her to do her business. She&#39;d let him brush his own teeth before breaking out the Tfrm app. Here he always slept in her underwear drawer after all.<br />
<br />
Sure enough once he himself was done he walked back into the room to find Ash sitting there phone in hand messing with his transformation settings. “Today&#39;s the big day. I hope you&#39;re ready.”<br />
<br />
Ash didn’t give Lace any time to respond before he was enveloped in her phone&#39;s flash. Then everything happened as it always had except now Lace felt his consciousness stay completely intact. The print on his wrist spread out and darkened as it covered his entire body. His skin slowly turned into a soft lavender as he watched the texture morph into that of cotton fabric. The world around him grew rapidly as he shrunk down to his proper size.<br />
<br />
He wasn&#39;t even done transforming as Ash casually picked her friend up off the ground. She watched as she always did as the features of his face flattened and melted into their true form: the gusset of her favorite panties. She giggled to herself as his cock and balls withered away and reformed into an adorable little bow. Lace&#39;s arms and legs then fused and flattened together, as they formed leg holes that she&#39;d slip her titanic thighs into. Finally his waistband appeared a beautiful strip of elastic lace fabric that she knew always hugged her hips perfectly.   <br />
<br />
Lace for the first time now remained fully conscious as a crumpled ball in his owner&#39;s hands. He felt helpless, pathetic, owned. He felt right. Ash wasted no time pulling the drawer open and unceremoniously plopping him down inside. He landed alongside the rest of the drawer&#39;s occupants. Those same old worn out undies he saw earlier that day, and once more he felt the same sense of welcoming contentment radiating off them.<br />
<br />
He wanted to say good night but was cruelly reminded that speech was something reserved for people. Something Ash reinforced by shutting him inside without a word. She had never bothered speaking to him when he was like this before and wasn&#39;t about to now. Lace did his best to settle in for the night, and couldn&#39;t help but nervously dream about his future strapped to Ash&#39;s fat ass.</p>
