<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff hurried back to his room. He wanted to see if the latest Chronivac changes had caused other realities to shift. He couldn’t bring up his father who was getting himself cleaned up in the master bedroom, but he was able to find Becky who was using the nearby shower. Becky was still Becky Ashmore but she was still 15, too old to be Jenny’s daughter. Jeff had to assume she was now Jenny’s sister. At least it was a step in the right direction or so he told himself. <br />
<br />
Name: Becky Ashmore<br />
Age: 15<br />
Gender: Female<br />
Height: 5&#39;4&quot;<br />

<br />
He then checked on his Mum’s stats. She was doing something in what used to be Rachel’s room. <br />
<br />
Name: Irene Hansen<br />
Age: 40<br />
Gender: Female<br />
Hair Colour/style: Redhead shoulder length<br />
Eye Colour: Hazel<br />
Weight: 120 pounds<br />
Build: Hourglass<br />
Relationship Status: Single<br />
Social Status: Popular<br />
Sexual preference: Straight<br />
Bust size: C-Cup<br />
Occupation: Physiotherapist<br />
<br />
He decided to make the same change he had made earlier. It had been successful for himself. It should work for Rachel as well and make her Irene’s daughter. Against Irene’s Relationship status he added the sentence “Mother of Rachel Hansen” <br />
<br />
He also he decided to alter Irene’s hair once more deciding her haircut didn’t work when she was a redhead. He changed the description to &quot;Redhead, long and curly&quot;. He imagined Debra Messing in the movie “The Wedding Date” that he had watched with Jenny only last week. He thought his Mom would like that look.<br />
<br />
His finger paused over the enter button. Earlier when he was reading the manual he had read how changes could be delayed. He decided to pause this change for 60 minutes. Rachel would become Irene’s daughter again just as the guests started to arrive. Irene should suddenly grow long red curls. If he kept an eye on the time he would be able to watch the changes himself. Meanwhile if he changed his mind he could always cancel the changes.<br />
<br />
He had to wait for Rachel and Irene to vacate the bathroom. The caterer had arrived back, this time with the food that was to be cooked. Irene was with her in the kitchen showing her how to operate the oven. Jeff decided to check out who this Trish was. Maybe she would like a change of hairstyle as well?<br />
<br />
Name: Trish Buckley<br />
Age: 41<br />
Gender: Female<br />
Hair Colour/style: Brown pixie cut<br />
Eye Colour: Blue<br />
Weight: 140 pounds<br />
Build: Curvy<br />
Relationship Status: Single<br />
Social Status: Shy<br />
Sexual preference: Gay <br />
Bust size: D-Cup<br />
Occupation: Caterer<br />
<br />
Jeff had not realised his mother’s friend was a lesbian. Was she still in the closet? She had short hair but didn’t look butch. He wondered if he should make Trish straight? She was single so that change shouldn’t affect anyone else. As far as Jeff was concerned there could never be too many straight women in the world. He made some changes to Trish.<br />
<br />
Name: Trish Buckley<br />
Age: 41<br />
Gender: Female<br />
Hair Colour/style: Blonde, pixie cut<br />
Eye Colour: Blue<br />
Weight: 130 pounds<br />
Build: Curvy/Hourglass<br />
Relationship Status: Single<br />
Social Status: Flirty<br />
Sexual preference: Straight <br />
Bust size: D-Cup<br />
Occupation: Caterer<br />
<br />
He set the delay for this change to 30 minutes. Thinking he would then still have time to stop the changes to his mother if this didn’t turn out.<br />
<br />
He stayed in his room hoping that either Jenny or his father would come within range of the Chronivac and he would be able to break off their engagement. However, that wasn’t to be. Becky’s stats appeared for a moment, but as he was considering changing her name to Rachel, she must have moved to out of range. He wasn’t too worried about that. A name change was easy. <br />
<br />
There was a knock on the door. It was his mother. She was in a dressing gown and still with shoulder length red hair. ‘I’m finished with the bathroom. You had better hurry and shower before the guests start to arrive. I’m about to iron my dress. Do you need a shirt ironed?’<br />
<br />
‘Sure thing Mom’ Jeff was glad of the reminder he had lost track of time. He shut the Chronivac down and turned off his computer. If he got the chance to change Jenny later he would take it, but for now he was resigned to attend the party to celebrate the engagement of Jenny and JJ.<br />
<br />
Jeff showered and dressed. On his mother’s suggestion he wore a tie. His Dad appeared with a tie on as well. Evidently Jenny had returned and had booted him out of the master bedroom so she could change and re-do her make-up.<br />
<br />
‘Change? I thought she looked great’ <br />
<br />
‘She bought a new dress from the boutique next to the hairdressers. I haven’t seen her in it yet’ <br />
<br />
Jeff noticed Trish the caterer. She was now a blonde and gave a wolf-whistle as she saw Jeff and his Dad. ‘Looking good you two!’ It seemed that change had worked as planned.<br />
<br />
Jeff looked at the time. It was 5 minutes until the changes to his mother would come into effect. He really wanted to watch as her hair grew. She appeared to be still in her room. <br />
<br />
Irene appeared just as the there was only 1 minute to go. She looked great in a black cocktail dress. She wore a brighter lipstick than what he was used to seeing her wear. She asked Jeff ‘Do I look alright?’<br />
<br />
‘You look great Mom. How about we go and get a drink and get this party started’<br />
<br />
10 seconds to go and the doorbell rang. Irene answered. Her hair was suddenly long and curly. There were two couples outside. Irene invited them in. ‘Welcome, I’m Irene, JJ’s sister. This is Jenny’s sister Becky and my daughter Rachel. Come in and make yourself at home’<br />
<br />
Irene then turned to the former Jeff ‘Rachel will you tell Jennifer and JJ that the guests are arriving’<br />
<br />
Rachel lifted the hem of her long gown so it didn’t drag on the ground as she made her way to her uncles bedroom</p>
