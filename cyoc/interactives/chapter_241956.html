<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The pain was unbearable this time. The magic energy from the witch&#39;s curse was jerking around their insides and threatening to rip their furry torsos wide open. The thieves flopped forward again, and this time, they didn&#39;t even catch themselves. They fell right onto the bellies they were clutching, rolled on the floor and ended up in the fetal position, facing away from each other. The witch smiled a bit, watching them suffer for stealing from her, but also looking forward to getting her new cat and dog.<br />
<br />
Chris and John curled tighter as their gets kept swirling, radically altering their diets for the foreseeable future. Their new tails curled inward with them as though seeking shelter from some unseen storm. John reached for his tail it was a life preserver. It was still aching from when he had pulled on it. &quot;It can&#39;t be real, I can&#39;t be turning into a cat,&quot; he thought. But his own hands on his own soft fur soothed him in a way that had to be real.<br />
<br />
The magic left their bellies and surged outward into their arms and legs. Chris, holding his knees, had to watch his feet stretch longer and thin out even as four of his toes grew thicker. He tried to say something when his big toe shrank back into his foot, but he stopped and whimpered when his toenails worked their way to the front of his toes and got pointy.<br />
<br />
John screamed loudly when pointy things started digging into the squirmy cat tail he was clutching. He let go of it to look down at his hands, just in time to see sharp objects vanishing inside his hands. Where the fuck were his fingernails?! He clenched and unclenched his empty hands and saw his new retractable claws coming in and out. &quot;Oh, shit,&quot; he managed to slur out. &quot;Oh, SHIT!&quot; he yelled when his thumbs cracked and shriveled into dewclaws. He couldn&#39;t seem to make a fist, wiggle his thumbs, or even move his fingers very much. Pads began to form while yet more fur emerged elsewhere. Then feline forepaws were completed.<br />
<br />
As for Chris, he was holding his big floppy ears closed, pushing them against the sides of his face. John was being too loud. Everything around him was too loud! But Chris was forced to let out a fairly loud shriek of his own when the magic formed a hardened spear inside him and shoooooved it slowly down into his flaccid cock. Looking down there just above his canine hind legs, between his tucked up dog tail and his belly, he watched his penis standing straighter, rounder, thcker. It felt like his dick was getting sliced apart from the inside! It looked like he was getting biggest boner of his life. In reality it was the formation of his literal penis bone. Chris lost his mushroom cockhead but gained a ball-like knot at the base. &quot;Eew, no, make it stop,&quot; he whined as the decreasingly human organ turned a humiliating shade of dull fuschia. He didn&#39;t want John or the witch to see this on him!<br />
<br />
For better or for worse, though, Chris was given a new way to hide his large pink organ. Part of his foreskin was fusing right up into his furry belly, making him shiver. The rest was sprouting a corresponding layer of dark fur. Before he knew it, his shaft had sunk all the way down inside it, and Chris was then left looking at the bulbous furry sheath of any canine male. He tried to reach for it, but he had already begun losing his thumbs like John had. His fingers rapidly lost their dexterity but gained new thick pads and claws. Unlike John, Chris didn&#39;t have to deal with his claws retracting back inside him or sticking out again. But he did have to deal with the fact that he couldn&#39;t grab things any more.<br />
<br />
Speaking of John, the nearly feline former thief was still behind Chris. John had moved a bit, too. He was stretching out onto his belly with his ass and tail in the air, crying out, &quot;OOOOW! NOOO!! My BALLS!!!! Let go of them, oooooooohhh---&quot; But in fact, no one was even touching his balls. Still, it felt like someone was grabbing, squeezing, and yanking them back, maybe even ripping rip the things off! The pain didn&#39;t stop until John&#39;s scrotum was tucked up tight against his anus right at the base of his lengthy twitching tail. If not for the agony of his repositioning gonads, he might have noticed his rear paws forming or his elevated ankles forming into hocks.<br />
<br />
After this tsunami burst of changes, the magic tapered off again, if only for a moment. Their furry limbs relaxed. Their torsos heaved deep breaths. Chris and John tried to get their bearings and wait for whenever their end would come. The witch leaned against a wall for a moment; she was getting old and the energy of transforming Chris and John would mean that she wouldn&#39;t be able to transform anyone else until morning. But Damon would still get his due.</p>
