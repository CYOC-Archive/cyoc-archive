<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dustin walked briskly to the customer service counter, trying not to notice Bubba’s stare and desperately hoping the guy wouldn’t point and just turn him into some fat trucker instantly. It was possible, and he probably wouldn’t hear him if he whispered. This was so dangerous, but…if they wanted those cars dealt with, they needed to broker a deal, which meant figuring out where their Book was.<br />
<br />
He wasn’t 100% one board with Troy becoming a god. Troy might be his best friend, but…well, it was like ever since he got the Book of Beasts, something inside of him snapped. Maybe it was the idea that he could do anything and if someone upset him…well, there was an order for a stallion for 10 grand.<br />
<br />
On the other hand…Book of Body added to Beast meant that they could, theoretically, simply make money by transforming people into perfectly accurate representations of their OCs. And furries had a ridiculous amount of money for a group of weirdos, that was for sure. Maybe he’d feel more comfortable if they only changed bad people into feral animals.<br />
<br />
The entrance to the customer area forced him to walk through the open garage bay. A couple of large, older truckers eyed him as he walked by like he was prey. A mechanic he passed bumped into him and winked when Dustin looked back at him. Dustin swallowed and hurried to the customer service door. Was there something else that had changed that Troy hadn’t told him?<br />
<br />
He opened the door and a little bell rang overhead. Dustin looked up at the counter and saw a rather handsome, if a bit husky, young man. Maybe a little older than he and Troy were…28 or 30, perhaps? He had a full head of black hair in a short, stylish haircut and a chinstrap beard on his face that outlined his roguish good looks and gorgeous green eyes that glittered strangely. His mouth lifted into a smirk when he saw Dustin eyeing him up.<br />
<br />
The man wore a greasy shirt over an equally greasy muscle-tee. The name on the shirt was SAM. Now that he had a better look at the guy, Dustin saw he really was built. He was a good four inches taller than Dustin with heavy, swollen muscles, a small belly, and thick chest hair. Sam may have some pudge on him, but he was far leaner than any of the other mechanics and truckers here. <br />
<br />
That thought gave Dustin pause. <br />
<br />
Why, exactly, wasn’t Sam as fat as all the others? They all looked like big bears of men in various states of obesity except Sam. Which meant…either Sam was the true Book owner, or Bubba was his…friend? Lover? Creating a world for themselves that mirrored their desires. A similar relationship, he supposed, to Troy and himself.<br />
<br />
Which meant he could be manipulated.<br />
<br />
Dustin mirrored Sam’s smile and walked up to the counter. “Hello. Sam, I presume?”<br />
<br />
“Ya presume right!” Sam grinned, green eyes dancing. “And how can I help you today?”<br />
<br />
“Well, I was kinda hoping to find a junker or a tow, maybe?” Dustin asked.<br />
<br />
As they were speaking, he surreptitiously eyed the back of the counter for any clipboards or a Book. There was the Blue Book, but that was just a car pricing guide. A couple of auto mags, some Men’s health magazines…nothing really stood out as possible items that they could use. There was a notepad…but it was just normal notepad paper, yellow dyed with the little blue lines like any other notepad.<br />
<br />
Maybe Bubba had it on him or kept it somewhere hidden? Like…say…a safe in the back? Dustin kept up the conversation, talking about this and that. Inwardly, he was furious. He didn’t know how to crack a damn safe! Sure, with acetylene torches and half an hour he could maybe break it, but…he didn’t have that kind of time.<br />
<br />
“Ya know, I toldja my name, but you never told me yers.” Sam asked.<br />
<br />
“Oh, it’s Dustin.” Dustin replied. <br />
<br />
“Really? And this car you need to get rid of, where’s it at?” Sam inquired.<br />
<br />
“Abandoned lot near my apartment. A whole bunch of them just rotting away.”<br />
<br />
“Ya don’t say?” Sam’s eyes gleamed.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, my next door neighbor inherited them or something and he said they would be gone soon…but they’re still sitting out there.”<br />
<br />
Sam frowned. “Really? Yer neighbor, he, uh, got a semi and a big red truck?”<br />
<br />
Dustin licked his lips. “Yeah, Troy or Buck or whatever he calls himself. I told him to take care of it, and he said you promised to remove them?”<br />
<br />
“I believe I did. And yer sure they’re still sittin’ out there?”<br />
<br />
“I went out back not twenty minutes ago.”<br />
<br />
“Huh…” Sam looked puzzled. “Ya know…did your neighbor ever tell ya who gave him the cars?”<br />
<br />
“Uh…” Dustin was stumped. Troy had left that little nugget out of the conversation. “I think it was his uncle or something.” <br />
<br />
“His uncle?”<br />
<br />
“I dunno man, he’s just a neighbor, like I was saying. He said he talked to Bubba? Is that who I need to talk to?”<br />
<br />
“Nah, don’t go botherin’ him.” Sam waved Dustin off.<br />
<br />
“Are you sure? I just want to get this thing resolved as fast as possible. Is he in his office? Maybe I should just-” Dustin went to walk around behind the counter.<br />
<br />
“Hey hey, now. It’s not like that.” Sam was serious. “I am definitely your man in this. Don’t go involvin’ Bubba.”<br />
<br />
“Are you sure?” Dustin asked.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, no worries!” Sam winked. “I gotchu boo. Ya know, I got my truck just over yonder, let’s take a quick ride and have a looksy.”<br />
<br />
“Oh, man, that’d be just fantastic!” Dustin grinned.<br />
<br />
“Now you wait here, I gotta go get something, I’ll be back in a jiff!” Sam hustled into the back.<br />
<br />
Dustin’s heart thudded. He waited for a couple minutes. That was more than enough time for Sam to retrieve the Book or Clipboard in Bubba’s office. Could he keep a level head through the reality changes? Dustin saw a ballpoint pen sitting on the counter and snatched it up.<br />
<br />
On his arm, he wrote: ‘I have been reality shifted, trust no memories except the following: Not a trucker. Need cars in abandoned lot moved. Book of Body may be in safe. Also, I hate fat guys. Not joking.’<br />
<br />
Satisfied, Dustin pulled down his shirt and wrote ‘trust the note on arm’ on the back of his left hand. If reality shifted, it likely wouldn’t target the pen and ink. Though, maybe it would. Who the fuck knew how this stuff worked?<br />
<br />
“Alrighty!” Sam announced as he walked back in. <br />
<br />
Dustin put down the pen and his left hand. “Oh, you ready?”<br />
<br />
Sam adjusted his crotch. “Ayup! Let’s get to my truck. Follow me.”<br />
<br />
They walked to the back of the garage. Mechanics were working on cars, but would occasionally grope each other or begin kissing. He was pretty sure two fat bears were fucking in the long-bed of a dualie. He shuddered and was happy to leave the shop and the smell of musk and oil and metal behind him.<br />
<br />
Sam paused in front of a rather handsome truck. Dustin took the moment to check him out, but saw no irregularities in his clothes where he could possibly hide the Book. If he was using pieces of the Book, just the paper, then he could have it folded up in his pocket, for all Dustin knew.<br />
<br />
“That beauty yours?” Dustin asked, trying to stay charming.<br />
<br />
Sam grinned, lighting up his beautiful eyes. “Aw, yeah, she’s real pretty, ain’t she?”<br />
<br />
Dustin nodded. <br />
<br />
“Alright, hop in.” Sam unlocked the doors and entered his truck. <br />
<br />
Dustin quickly did the same. The air of the cab was interesting, to say the least. It smelled of leather and whiskey and cigars and money. Once Sam was settled in, it also smelt like musk and oil. The smells didn’t clash at all, in Dustin’s opinion. Sam smelled really good for a dude, despite being sweaty and musky.<br />
<br />
They drove back into town. The smell was growing stronger and Dustin was getting kinda uncomfortable. The AC was blasting frigid air, though, so it wasn’t like he could just ask to roll down the windows. Sam’s musk had a strange note to it, one that had Dustin’s cock rigid, tenting his slacks. <br />
<br />
“So, uh, Sam.” Dustin coughed, adjusting himself. “I couldn’t help but notice everyone at your shop was kinda big.”<br />
<br />
“I mean, Whaddya expect?” Sam looked over at him and winked. “They are truckers, after all. Stay on the road long enough and ya make bad dietary choices, what can I say?”<br />
<br />
“I guess.” Dustin adjusted himself again. No matter how much he shifted his cock in his pants, it was still making a visible bulge. “It’s just that you aren’t.”<br />
<br />
“Heh, thanks, I guess?” Sam glanced at Dustin when they came to a stop at a light. “You doing okay there, hoss?”<br />
<br />
“I-I’m fine.” Dustin swallowed, trying to ignore how hard his cock felt.<br />
<br />
“If you say so.” Sam’s smile stretched into a grin when he saw Dustin’s thick bulge as it slowly grew down his thigh. “So what’s Troy like?”<br />
<br />
“He’s okay. Super into trucks and likes to be called Buck now.” Dustin said, happy to concentrate on something other than the cock straining his pants. “Don’t know what that’s all about.”<br />
<br />
“Oh, I give all my trucker friends names like that. Buck, King, Bear. It’s just easier fer me n’ Bubba ta remember, ya know?” Sam replied, throwing his arm behind his seat, his musk growing stronger. <br />
<br />
“It’s just…so many truckers, where are the jobs coming from? I didn’t even think a community this size would have enough of them to have their own club, you know.” Dustin said, beginning to lean towards that inviting pit. <br />
<br />
“That’s…a good point, actually.” Sam scratched his jaw in thought. “But I think Bubba’s plan is to get our own trucking company. I wonder if it’ll happen naturally or if we’ll actually have ta form the company ourselves.”<br />
<br />
Dustin nodded, leaning further towards those lovely pits, his mouth watering. His cock was so hard, half down his thigh, tenting slacks that were slowly shifting into jeans. Wait, halfway down his thigh? Had his cock always been that big?<br />
<br />
He briefly panicked, checking to see where Sam’s hands were. One was firmly on the steering wheel, where it had been the entire time they had been driving. The other was behind the seats. As he considered checking if Sam was holding anything in it, like a piece of paper, he felt the light touch of Sam’s rough fingers on the back of his neck..<br />
<br />
Dustin glanced at Sam, who looked over at him and winked.<br />
<br />
“Ya just look so tense. Relax, man.” Sam&#39;s fingers firmly rubbed Dustin’s neck.<br />
<br />
“It’s just…the cars…” Dustin moaned, wishing the hand would go lower to something hard and needy. He scratched his chest, not noticing the thatches of hair peeking through his button-down. <br />
<br />
“They ain’t even gonna be there.” Sam smiled as they stopped at the next light, his hand beginning to press more firmly on Dustin’s head, pushing the younger man towards his pit.<br />
<br />
Dustin tried to pull away, but it was a half-hearted attempt. The mechanic was so hot and smelled so good, like a proper working man with a spicy, demanding musk. All Dustin wanted to do was snort that delicious musk. The fingers gently scritched the back of his head, pulling him ever closer, and soon his face was inches away from Sam’s armpit.<br />
<br />
“It’s okay, bud, I ain’t gonna bite.” Sam smiled, pressing Dustin’s face all the way in to his pit.<br />
<br />
Dustin moaned, tongue tasting the salt and sweat of the mechanic. He lapped it in long, loving licks, taking his time to taste it. The hand on the back of his neck drifted lower, coming to rest on his thigh, fingers softly stroking Dustin’s hard cock through his jeans. Dustin’s cock twitched and a spot of wetness appeared on his jeans.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, like that. What’s your favorite animal?” Sam asked.<br />
<br />
“Dog,” Dustin replied, finishing the pit and licking Sam’s neck. “You’re so hot.”<br />
<br />
The truck came to a stop outside the large abandoned lot. It was filled with overgrowth and vision was limited after a couple yards. From this angle, Dustin could see the glint of the sun off a side-mirror far off in the lot.<br />
<br />
Sam chuckled. “Heh, thanks Alpha. This the lot?”<br />
<br />
“Yes.” Dustin paused. “Alpha?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, it’s yer nickname.” Sam smiled.<br />
<br />
“But I’m not a fat hairy trucker!”<br />
<br />
“No?” Sam pulled Alpha into another kiss, then pulled away, green eyes shining. “We’ll see. Where’s the cars?”<br />
<br />
Alpha blinked and licked his lips, “Come on, I’ll show you.”<br />
<br />
“Show me?” Sam frowned, eyeing Alpha oddly.<br />
<br />
“We hid them behind the overgrowth. Come on!” Alpha got out, enjoying the fresh air. <br />
<br />
It had been so weirdly stifling in the truck, despite the AC. He stretched, feeling his joints and spine pop pleasantly, Then walk towards the first car they’d hidden, weaving his way through the dense bushes and small trees that filled the big lot. Apparently, it had been the parking lot of a K-Mart. <br />
<br />
Sam joined him, and he noticed they were the same height. For some strange reason, he’d thought he was shorter than the handsome muscle bear. Which was silly, because he’d already established that Sam was safe and if he had been turned into something, Buck would have swooped in and saved him. It was frustrating to have conflicting memories, because, like, was he just imagining he had conflicting memories because he was paranoid, or had Sam and Bubba somehow gotten him without a Book?<br />
<br />
If Sam and Bubba could change people without a Book…well, he was just fucked. And judging by the way things were going, maybe literally? It didn’t matter. If they had the ability to change people with their thoughts, Alpha had no idea what to do. Be a fat trucker like Buck, he supposed. They’d still have their Books, so at least they wouldn’t lose that.<br />
<br />
They found the first car that Alpha had pointed out.<br />
<br />
Sam stared at it, dumbfounded.<br />
<br />
“Something wrong?” Alpha asked, his voice lowering an octave as it grew deeper.<br />
<br />
“...Uh, no. No! Nothing wrong at all, Alpha!” Sam stumbled at first, then regained his usual cheeriness. “Are there others?”<br />
<br />
Alpha showed him the others, all parked behind large bushes and trees. Sam grew increasingly agitated. Alpha figured the mechanic expected them to have disappeared when reality shifted, and now he was wondering why they weren’t gone.<br />
<br />
Sam popped the hood on one and bent over, exposing his jockstrap and his hairy, globular asscheeks. A breeze carried his musk into Alpha’s nose, causing his cock-which had grown flaccid with the walk-to harden again. He leaned forward, sniffing the air to catch a whiff of Sam’s scent again, his back gently popping again.<br />
<br />
“Strange, everything looks in working order. Even has the keys on the dash.” Sam straightened up and looked behind him, then frowned. “What? Oh, right. Help me check out the back of this van, need to see if I can move them out, since they don’t seem to be, uh…since they weren’t picked up already.”<br />
<br />
Sam walked back to the rear door and opened it. He crawled into the rather spacious trunk. The back seats had been removed and were nowhere to be found. Sam turned and gestured for him to follow, the mechanic’s ass waving in the air, musk filling the back of the truck.<br />
<br />
Cock hard, Alpha crouched got int behind him.<br />
<br />
“W-what are ya lookin’ fer?” Alpha asked, trying to keep his mind off that beautiful ass and his aching hard cock. He leaned forward, smelling the mechanic’s tantalizing odor.<br />
<br />
“Ya really need ta relax, Alpha.” Sam backed up his ass, pressing it against Alpha’s face. “Let the cars go. I’ll take care of them if they don’t…take care of themselves.”<br />
<br />
Alpha backed up, though the musk followed him. He scratched his growing beard and one of his thick pecs through his opened shirt.  <br />
<br />
Sam unbuckled his pants and lowered his jockstrap. He looked behind him and winked, shaking his thick, bubbly ass. Alpha swallowed thickly. Sam was just so fuckin’ hot!<br />
<br />
“It ain’t going to eat itself out, Alpha.” Sam said, grinning from ear to ear.<br />
<br />
Alpha shuddered and licked his bearded lips, staring at the cub’s enticing globes. Sam wriggled his hips again and Alpha found his cock twitch in his pants. He growled, the sound deep and rumbly, chest widening and pecs growing heavy with muscle as he crept forward and shoved his face into the boy’s ass. <br />
<br />
Sam yelped as Alpha buried his scratchy bearded face between his asscheeks, huffing the musk from the source. Alpha snuffled, his hot breath washing over the twitching pink flesh of Sam’s hole. Sam moaned wantonly as Alpha ran his tongue over his puckered entrance. The new bear firmly licked the boy’s hole, coating it with saliva. Sam moaned again as Alpha’s tongue breached his ring and wriggled inside his passageway. <br />
<br />
The mechanic panted heavily, cock throbbing, the air of the van filling with musk as Alpha thoroughly ate him out. <br />
<br />
With a lustful snort, Alpha began to bob his head, thrusting his tongue in and out of Sam’s ass. Sam groaned, pressing his face against the floor as his asshole swelled and parted, yielding to the tongue-fucking the large bear was giving him. He pushed his beefy rump back into Alpha’s mouth, eagerly grinding his hole into his thrusting tongue.<br />
<br />
Alpha gripped the boy’s muscular butt cheeks with large, calloused hands, not noticing the sudden glint of gold as a wedding band appeared on his ring finger. He kneaded those fleshy mounds before pulling them apart, spreading them. He grunted happily and sloppily gorged on Sam’s delectable hole. His tongue reached deeper, ensuring that the cub’s ass was thoroughly covered in drool.<br />
<br />
When Alpha finally pulled away, he did so with a contented gasp. He panted, face reeking of Sam’s hole, mouth full of his musky flavor. Drool hung from his bearded lips and he ran his tongue around them, gathering up the mess before swallowing. Sam was moaning and writhing below, ass wobbling to and fro. Alpha smirked.<br />
<br />
He burped, tasting as and beer and fast food as his belly softened and grew into a wobbly gut. Alpha hefted himself up over Sam’s ass, using his back as a shelf for his beer-belly. His arms wrapped around the mechanic’s waist, muscles bulging thicker with muscle and fat, a bear claw tattoo needling itself into his skin. He unbuckled his jeans and dropped them to the floor, his huge, foot-long fuck stick drooping free, his pelvic muscles unable to keep the heavy dick vertical. Then, gripping Sam tight, he rubbed his cock between the cub’s luscious ass cheeks, hot dogging him, coating his cock with saliva from the lubed-up hole.<br />
<br />
Sam gasped and writhed as Alpha slowly penetrated him, the bear’s saliva easing the passage somewhat. Then he whined as the thrusts began. Alpha pressed himself forward, enjoying the warmth that gradually enveloped his cock, Sam’s hole squeezing and teasing his shaft. He could feel the boy’s inner walls somehow milk him, muscles that shouldn’t have been there moving rhythmically, pulling his cock deeper. <br />
<br />
Alpha moaned, gripping Sam’s waist possessively. He’d wanted to fuck him for months now, ever since he started trucking with his husband, Buck. The boy’s ass was a top’s wet dream, smoothly flexing, his cock sliding deeper and deeper. It almost felt like it was growing thicker and longer. Which was ridiculous, because he’d always had a fifteen-inch fuck stick. He thrust hard, fully hilting inside Sam.<br />
<br />
The mechanic groaned breathlessly, wheezing as the air was forced form his lungs. Alpha’s cock stretched the boy’s hole wide, and he found he enjoyed Sam’s shivers and moans. The big bear ground into him, eagerly humping the mechanic’s stuffed hole. His light, quick thrusts elicited more shivers and moans from the boy beneath him. <br />
<br />
Alpha pulled out until his cock head reached Sam’s convulsing ring, then with a grunt, thrust in again, burying himself to the hilt again. Sam huffed and panted beneath him as Alpha slammed into him again and again, his muscles rippling with the force of his thrusts. Alpha built up his pace, the sound of flesh slapping against flesh filling the air of the sweltering van.<br />
<br />
Sam’s hole quivered and pulsed as Alpha thoroughly fucked him, rutting him like a beast. Alpha jack-hammered away, the mechanic clinging to the front seats to keep his ass up. Sam’s moans were growing higher and higher. Alpha could see the boy’s red face beneath him, felt the hole he was inside spasm, and smelled the scent of fresh seed fill the air. Alpha groaned and buried his shaft deep and his heavy, swollen bull balls drew up and thick white streamers of cum surged into the boy’s ass. Sam groaned as Alpha filled him to the brim.<br />
<br />
Alpha finished, slumping over the boy, completely satisfied. They were both breathing heavily. Alpha saw the note in pen on his hand. He frowned and pulled up the sleeve of his leather jacket. Had he written this? It kinda looked like his handwriting. He read the notes and frowned.<br />
<br />
Somehow, the naughty cub had gotten him.<br />
<br />
“You were real good, boy.” Alpha growled, slapping the boy’s ass.<br />
<br />
“Thanks daddy.” Sam breathed, clinging to the bear’s thick chest, playing with the leather harness that crisscrossed his furry torso.<br />
<br />
“Now tow these fuckin’ cars and chop them.” Alpha pulled his cock out of the mechanic’s thick ass, cum dribbling onto the floor. “I better not have ta ask twice.”<br />
<br />
Sam was silent, only the sound of his breath filling the air. “…Okay, Alpha.”<br />
<br />
They walked back to the cub’s car, Alpha adjusting his leather jacket and harness, pulling up his jeans and buckling them. Sam glanced behind him, studying the bear, then at all the cars. Alpha smirked. The slutty little cub had no idea why the cars wouldn’t disappear. Turning him into a top had been a mistake. Slutty bottoms like Sam didn’t question a dom’s orders.<br />
<br />
The ride back to Bubba’s was uneventful. Alpha was still trying to figure out how to deal with knowing much of his life was a complete lie, thanks to the reality shift. He concealed his left hand, knowing Sam would likely catch on if he saw the message there. Alpha was also frustrated that he’d gotten the cub naked and hadn’t seen any Book or parchment that would have set off the change. How the hell were he and Bubba pulling it off? And why go to such lengths to conceal it when they had no idea a Book user was living in the same town? It smacked of paranoia…or experimentation.<br />
<br />
If it was experimentation, what had they done? Book of Body…could they have…no, they couldn’t tattoo it on themselves, that was probably something the Book of Transmutation could do. Wait, so If they couldn’t change the Book, maybe they’d done something to themselves that caused the transformation?<br />
<br />
Like…their musk! What if it had trans formative properties, shaped whoever smelled them into their desires? That would explain why he was a big, mostly muscular trucker top and Buck was a thick assed fat trucker bottom.God, just thinkin’ about Buck, big hairy ass in the air on their bed, made Alpha’s cock hard. <br />
<br />
“Got somethin’ on yer mind, fella?” Sam asked, smirking at the tent Alpha was pitching.<br />
<br />
“Ya. Thinkin’ about plowin’ my husbear’s hole when I get home.” Alpha grinned.<br />
<br />
“Atta boy. Here,” Sam tossed his musky jockstrap at Alpha, who caught it. “Somethin’ for you and Buck to share.”<br />
<br />
Alpha sniffed it, reveling in the masculine odor. His muscles throbbed warmly, scratching his jacket tight. He leaned back in the seat, jockstrap to his nose, and stroked himself through his jeans. His mind felt a little foggy, bits and pieces being replaced by trucking and weight lifting with Sam. His mind shifted to Bubba and his ass swelled into two firm cheeks, jeans stretching to accommodate them. Alpha might be a top, but he’d bottom for that big bear any day!<br />
<br />
“There ya go!” Sam encouraged. “Ya think too much.”<br />
<br />
“God ya smell so god!” Alpha moaned. “Wish I could bring ya along with me on the road with my cub.”<br />
<br />
“Never say never!” Sam giggled as they pulled into Bubba’s Body Shop.<br />
<br />
Alpha got out, adjusting his leather jacket, cock still hard and sauntered back to his car. “See ya later, Sam!”<br />
<br />
“Good luck Alpha!” Sam waved and went inside.<br />
<br />
Alpha walked back to the car…and found Buck snoring in the driver’s seat. The windows were open, so at least he had a cross-breeze. He unlocked the door and lowered himself in. Buck snored.<br />
<br />
“Cubby, wake up.” Alpha said, shaking Buck’s shoulder.<br />
<br />
Buck jerked awake. “What? Huh? Didja get shifted, Alpha?”<br />
<br />
“Do I look like I did?” Alpha brought up his left hand. There was no ink there, no writing.<br />
<br />
“No, but-”<br />
<br />
Alpha kissed his cub, their beards rubbing against each other.  They groped and squeezed, growing more aggressive, Buck finding Alpha grabbing Buck’s leather harness under his wifebeater. Alpha always made him wear the harness.<br />
<br />
“Where’s the Book?” Alpha murmured.<br />
<br />
“Here, daddy.” Buck popped the glove compartment open with one hand and touched the Book of Beast.<br />
<br />
His eyes went wide and he pulled away. “Dude, what the fuck?!”<br />
<br />
“What did you say to me, boy?” Alpha growled.<br />
<br />
“Put your hand on the Book, you changed, man!” Buck said.<br />
<br />
Alpha grumbled but did as Buck asked. His eyes flew open. They’d really changed him after all!<br />
<br />
“Those sons of bitches. You didn’t tell me they turned you gay as well!”<br />
<br />
“I...didn’t wanna say anything.”<br />
<br />
“Of course you didn’t, you always leave thing sut-”<br />
<br />
There was a gentle rapping on their window.<br />
<br />
Buck and Alpha turned.<br />
<br />
Standing outside was Bubba and Sam. Bubba was glowering, staring at the Book that sat between them on the dash. Sam was grinning, eyeing the two up. He mimicked a window rolling down motion.<br />
<br />
&quot;So what’re you two boys doing at my shop with a Book?” Sam asked.</p>
