<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kellie Pendragon smiled, she didn&#39;t get a chance to work at her father&#39;s shop as much as she wished. Today though, the young woman was asked to assist, Merlin finding himself busy and needing some assistance in running the day to day operations for the next couple of weeks. Finishing the inventory, she paused as she now heard the bell ring announcing customers. The young sorceress pausing as she noticed a large group now enter the shop.<br />
<br />
&quot;So this is where Merlin is,&quot; Sylvia asked, still somewhat shocked to learn the ancient wizard resided in this mundane shop.  &quot;Its where we found him the first time we came here,&quot; Spark stated. &quot;Mind you I kinda snuck in with Jacob that time.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kellie gazed at the group of teens that were now milling around the store. She could sense some magic coming from them, yet did not recognize the group. Part of the problem with the Magic Shop was that it was a Nexus point in the universe, meaning the doors lead to numerous other timelines. &quot;Can I help you,&quot; she asked.<br />
<br />
Nat and the others now turned, gazing at the young woman. She looked familiar, yet they couldn&#39;t quite place her face. It was Akira who now stepped forward, the kitsunes features shifting from human to anthro as he stood before Merlins daughter. &quot;Kellie Pendragon.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Akira,&quot; Kellie asked in confusion. &quot;What are you doing here? Also, who are these guys? Are they friends of Mia and Zack? I&#39;ve never seen them before.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve been training this one,&quot; he stated, pointing towards Nat. &quot;And no, they are not friends of Mia and Zack. They actually reside in your daughter&#39;s timeline.&quot; Kellie nodded, muttering under her breath about timelines before taking a deep breath. &quot;So care to introduce me?&quot;<br />
<br />
Akira now introduced Nat and the others, Kellie offering a polite wave in response. &quot;So who are you,&quot; Spark asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is Kellie Pendragon,&quot; Akira replied. &quot;Merlins daughter.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Merlins daughter,&quot; the group exclaimed loudly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah it&#39;s a long story,&quot; she blushed. &quot;So what brings you here today?&quot; As Akira looked to speak, it was Sylvia and Tanya that now pushed themselves to the front.  &quot;Well we wanted to see you dad about something,&quot; Sylvia said quickly. &quot;We needed his help in finding Lancelot.&quot; Kellie balked,, she of course recognized the name but her father rarely talked about the old times. To her knowledge, Lancelot had been dead for centuries. &quot;I&#39;m pretty sure he&#39;s dead,&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
&quot;We believe he&#39;s alive,&quot; Tanya stated. &quot;We think he&#39;s with the vampires. Do you think your dad can help us?&quot;  Kellie nodded, asking the group to wait for a moment as she retrieved Merlin. <br />
<br />
&quot;You think Merlin can help,&quot; Miranda asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think it&#39;s our best shot,&quot; Nat stated. &quot;Duke wasn&#39;t sure when I asked him.  With Miro gone, Lancelot is our best shot at stopping Kane.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;True but didn&#39;t Duke say that even if Lancelot was alive he would be imprisoned somewhere,&quot; Amara added. <br />
<br />
&quot;He did,&quot; Connor said. &quot;And according to Duke, the only ones that might know where he was being held would be the vampires Donovan or Hannibal. Let&#39;s just hope Merlin can help.&quot; The group nodded, anxiously gazing at where Kellie Pendragon had gone.<br />
<br />
After what seemed like an eternity, Kellie returned,  this time with an ancient looking man adorned in grey robes. It didn&#39;t take the group long to realize they were staring at Merlin. The ancient wizard giving them a warm smile as he approached. &quot;My daughter says you are looking for an old acquaintance of mine.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nat and the others nodded, the group now talking over one another as they explained everything that had occurred since Ezekiel Kanes arrival. Despite the dizzying amount of information thrust upon the ancient wizard, he seemed to take it in stride, nodding slowly as they finished. &quot;Yes it is possible that Lancelot is alive,&quot; he said softly. &quot;I lost track of him some time ago. After he fell in with the vampire nation he became difficult to track.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So the stories were true,&quot; Sylvia said excitedly. &quot;He did become a vampire.&quot; Merlin nodded, sad look etched across his face. &quot;He did as penance for his betrayal of Camelot,&quot; he sighed. &quot;He was an immensely proud man. He could never quite forgive himself for lusting over Gweneveire and betraying Arthur. Even if it wasn&#39;t his fault.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dad what do you mean it wasn&#39;t his fault,&quot; Kellie asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Morgan Lefay bewitched him,&quot; Merlin stated. &quot;A love potion she slipped to the pair. She was always jealous of Arthur and Camelot, as well as myself. Her jealousy eventually led her to topple the Kingdim of Camelot.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So what happened to Morgan Lefay,&quot; Rei asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;She was adopted by my daughter,&quot; Kellie blushed, Nat and her friends jaws dropping at this bit of information. &quot;Morgan kind of tried to destroy me and my daughter Katie. It resulted in her being reduced to infancy and starting over from scratch. She goes by Morgan Carlson now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hold on back up,&quot; Amara exclaimed. &quot;Are you telling me your Morgan Lefays grandma now?!?&quot; Kellie simply shrugged, the group trying to wrap their minds around this nugget of information.<br />
<br />
&quot;Regardless,&quot; Merlin stated, trying to refocus everyone&#39;s attention. &quot;There is a distinct possibility that Lancelot is alive. We just don&#39;t know where.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well we could always try looking for him,&quot; Sylvia stated.<br />
<br />
&quot;That means going to the land of the vampire&#39;s,&quot; Miles replied. &quot;Thats probably a really bad idea.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I believe I have an idea,&quot; Merlin stated. Slowly the wizard turned to his daughter, a smile now cracking across his ancient face. &quot;Kellie can you ask your daughter to come here? We&#39;re going to need her help.&quot;<br />
<br />
Thirty minutes later, Nat and her friends watched as a young woman now entered the Magic Shop with her 3 year old daughter. Kellie smiled, bending down to hug the excited 3 year old. &quot;Grandma,&quot; Morgan cheered happily as she squeezed the young woman. <br />
<br />
&quot;Thats Morgan Lefay,&quot; Sylvia asked, casting the adorable child a dubious look.<br />
<br />
&quot;We don&#39;t bring up the L word with Morgan,&quot; Kellie said firmly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay how about the fact your daughter looks older than you,&quot; Tanya stated.<br />
<br />
&quot;Long story,&quot; Katie sighed. <br />
<br />
Katie now straightened herself, gazing at the group of teens before her. She didn&#39;t really know the group well, having only met Spark when she had attacked Draculas castle last year. &quot;So what exactly is going on mom,&quot; she asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;I can answer that,&quot; Merlin stated. Katie nodded, the group following the ancient wizard as made his way towards the rear of the store. Throwing back a curtain the group noted a small coffee table surrounded by half a dozen chairs. &quot;I usually don&#39;t entertain this many guest&#39;s,&quot; Merlin said. &quot;However, please make yourselves comfortable.&quot; The group did as asked, now watching the wizard attentively as he began to speak.<br />
<br />
In the time of Camelot the knights of Arthur swore fealty to not only the realm to their rightful king. The magic, which Merlin had imbued in Arthur, allowed him to summon his knights by simply holding Excalibur aloft. &quot;Okay so how does this involve me,&quot; Katie asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Excalibur recognizes you as it&#39;s true owner now Katie,&quot; Merlin stated. &quot;I theorize that if you were to summon Lancelot he would come.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you sure that would work,&quot; Miranda asked. &quot;I mean didn&#39;t he turn his back on Arthur.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He did&quot; Merlin stated. &quot;However, in the end he did return in Arthur&#39;s final moments. The magic of the blade and Lancelots noble nature should allow us to bring him here from whatever prison he resides in.&quot; Katie nodded, the group watching anxiously as the young woman stood. Taking a breath she now summoned forth the mystical blade Excalibur, holding it aloft as she spoke.<br />
<br />
&quot;Lancelot of Camelot. I summon thee to once more serve Excalibur and the realms.&quot;<br />
<br />
For a moment all was quiet, the group waiting with baited breath. &quot;Did it work,&quot; Rei asked. Before anyone could answer, they could see Excalibur glow brightly, forcing them all to shield their eyes. Blinking, Nat&#39;s vision now slowly began to clear. The young dhamphir gasping as she beheld a figure standing before them.<br />
<br />
The man, while pale, was extraordinarily handsome with flowing bonde hair. Adorned in silver armor, the vampire blinked before studying everyone surrounding him. &quot;Where am I,&quot; he asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;My shop Lancelot.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lancelot paused, the vampiric knights eyes going wide in surprise as his vision fell upon his ancient ally. &quot;Merlin?!&quot;<br />
<br />
Merlin smiled, slowly approaching his old friend as he placed a hand upon the knights shoulder. &quot;It is good to see again old friend. We have much to discuss.&quot;</p>
