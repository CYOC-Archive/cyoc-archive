<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It wasn´t even two minutes after Dean was out of Mark´s door that Luke came up to him, which meant Mark´s guess about the time he had for the two had been fitting. Luke was slightly frowning at something.<br />
Mark looked at him. “What´s wrong, Luke?”<br />
Luke hadn´t want to say what was irking him, but as Mark had before forced him to answer truthfully, he couldn´t stop himself from answering: “I just have a feeling that something changed about your brother´s friends while I cleaned up my rooms.”<br />
Mark was a bit surprised by that. Then he remembered that while he made sure nobody would notice the changes, Luke had a bit of knowledge about him changing others. “So, you think I changed something about them? Only the two that have been with me a few minutes ago or others as well?”<br />
Luke couldn´t stop himself from saying his thoughts out loud to that. “Now I have the feeling for just the two, but even before I thought that you have changed your brother and his other friends, and I also think you are responsible for Aidan´s situation, even if I remember him being so since I have first met him.”<br />
“Luke isn´t dumb, that I have to acknowledge.” Mark thought. And while he made sure Luke couldn´t mention things he noticed if asked, he never forbid him from saying theories. “Okay, I must say you are clever and imaginative with your ideas. Yes, I´m responsible for Aidan´s situation, as well as my brother´s and his friends. Only I change them in another way than you, and they themselves are unaware. All six of them were normal before I started. Now, to make sure this stays confidential between us, you can´t say that to anyone beside me, and never if anyone could overhear us. If someone asks you about it, it’s the same as with my control over you, you just can´t. You will find an excuse that gives nothing away. And theories like that about what I can do are the same, you can only explain them if I ask you alone.”<br />
Luke looked surprised that Mark would somewhat explain this much to him, shocked what power he had over others. But then he was again made muzzled about the topic, unable to talk to anyone when asked about it.<br />
Mark grinned at him. “Now, about changes to you. Have you anything you want to change about you? Any animal you would like to have something from?” While he forced the others, their changes didn´t need to be permanent. Luke would get something more in that category, so he was allowed to at least say his part, maybe get a wish fulfilled that way.<br />
Luke was surprised that Mark would ask him this and not just decide, but maybe he did so to just use opposites to his wishes. Or he was honestly asking and would fulfill a wish or two? Needless to say, when he answered, he was forced to be honest. “As maybe you know I´m wearing contacts as I hate wearing glasses. My eyes are miserable without help. I always dreamt of having eyes like a eagle, easy to spot even fine details without help. If I had to choose a kind of animal I would like to be, it would be something feline, I adore cats, even if I´m allergic to their hairs. And what child that isn´t afraid of heights wouldn´t love to be able to fly?”<br />
Mark nodded at him. “So, if you could change your own body, it would be mostly feline, but with wings, most likely on your back, and sharp eyes. And as you mentioned your allergy, you would want the feline´s fur, so you would need to lose your allergy, right?” summarized Mark from Luke´s wishes.<br />
Luke nodded. That sounded fitting to what he said. “Yeah, sounds good.” But deep down, Luke still worried Mark would twist it.<br />
Mark turned to the laptop, ordering Luke to take a seat on his bed for now, while looking at Luke´s profile. He had erased his “Mark rules” comment before, as he would make the changes manually instead. If needed, he could still reapply it.<br />
Name: Luke Jackson<br />
Form: Human<br />
Age: 29 years, 1 months, 16 days <br />
Height: 5ft 8 inch<br />
Weight: 167 pounds<br />
Personality: Talkative (suppressed by Mark Romano), curious, kind, helpful, active<br />
Changes made: 	Can´t talk freely, only when asked <br />
Forced honesty, exception – Changes made to him and others <br />
Forced to obey Mark Romano<br />
Forced to follow Mark Romano, no running away<br />
Hearing Mark Romano´s orders, even when not near him<br />
Raised skills for household chores<br />
Raised skills for cooking<br />
<br />
Mark first changed the form from “human” to “anthro tiger”, with opened up more specific options in that direction. He gave Luke fur all over his body, beside his head and hands, erasing his clothes in the process. The fur would be soft and bushy, and its pattern would be like a normal, African tiger, including the colors. That erased Luke´s allergy, as he couldn´t be allergic to himself. A long tail would also grow on him, long and flexible enough to wrap around his waist. His feet would be paws, but his hands would still be mostly normal. If not, how would Luke work as a servant? The only change were the retractable claws he got, which he could grow from his finger nails. They would be sharp enough to replace knifes in the kitchen. He would be able to walk on just his paws, reflecting on being an anthro tiger, but he added that his hands wouldn´t be hurt if Luke decided to run on all fours. If he lowered himself to all fours, he would gain paw-pads on his hands, which would vanish again if he stood back up.<br />
On Luke´s head, Mark only added the tiger´s ears instead of human ones, and that his black hair would gain a few orange stripes, fitting to his fur. While the rest would stay as it was, Mark edited Luke´s senses. His ears and nose would be more sensible, raising his hearing and smelling a good bit. His eyes were healed, and given the sharpness of an eagle, just as Luke had asked for.<br />
Also, liking Luke´s idea of flying, Mark gave Luke wings on his back. They would be like dragon wings, but with the tiger´s fur and coloration. He would be able to fold them in completely, making them vanish from sight. He would be able to fly with them easily. But Mark made sure that Luke would be strong enough to fly at least three other people around, so he could fly him around, and even take Aidan with them.<br />
Reading his selection over, Mark nodded to himself before saving the changes with a password, just to stay safe. Then he turned to look at Luke.<br />
Luke had sat on Mark´s bed, waiting silently for whatever Mark was typing at the computer. Was Mark really able to change him with the computer, or was he just looking things up? Would he respect his wishes or not? Just as Mark turned around to face him again, Luke felt a sudden chill run across his skin. He gasped as he noticed he was naked suddenly.<br />
Mark grinned at him. “Don´t worry, you won´t need them any longer. They would be rather uncomfortable very soon, and at least your socks and shirt wouldn´t have survived what´s coming.”<br />
Luke looked at Mark wide-eyed, but a sudden itch let him look down again. He was growing hairs on his arms and chest. It took a second for him to realize it wasn´t just hairs, but fur. He was getting fur all over his body. A small gasp escaped him when he felt something growing above his ass, and he watched in fascination as he got a long, stripped tail that twitched behind him in his excitement. He felt his feet twist and grow more sensitive to the carpet below them, and saw them becoming paws before his eyes.<br />
All of the sudden, Luke could hear the game Mark´s brother was playing with his friend´s downstairs, and he smelled something stinking from the next room. Another gasp escaped him, when he felt his contacts jumping out of his eyes, only for his sight to sharpen even more than with them before. He had only felt a small tingle in his ears as they changed position and form. His back tingled terrible for a minute, but he couldn´t see any change happening there, as his new wings, that he didn´t realize he had gotten, were still folded in completely.<br />
After a minute or two in silence, in which Luke watched his changed body all over, Mark asked: “Are you satisfied with your new body, Luke?”<br />
Luke beamed in happiness, as he answered: “I love it. You were right, the clothes would have been uncomfortable. Only, why do I still have normal hands?”<br />
Mark smiled at him. “As you still are my servant, you would need normal hands to work, right. But like a cat, you can extend your claws from your finger nails easily, so you can use them instead of knifes in the kitchen. They are sharp enough for that, but at the same time, can´t even scratch human skin, so you can not cut yourself or others with them. But your hands will grow paw-pads if you decide to move on all fours, even if your body supports walking on only your legs, as you are an anthro. I also didn´t change your face beside your ears and hair-color, only your senses are better now, including your eyes.”<br />
Luke´s happy expression dimmed a bit as being reminded he was Mark´s servant, and still would need to obey any command he gave him. But he tried to extend his claws and found it really easy to do, as long as he knew he could do so.<br />
Mark still smiled when he continued: “For your other wish, I also fulfilled that for you. You have wings on your back, fitting with tiger fur and all, but you can hide them by folding them in. Right now, they are invisible, because they are folded in completely. You should be able to unfold them as easily as you extend your claws.”<br />
That brought back Luke´s beaming look, and seconds later his new wings unfolded with a whoosh sound behind him. He marveled over them for some time, and Mark let him do so.<br />
A few minutes later, however, Luke send a questioning look to Mark, as he couldn´t voice his question without being able to talk. Mark guessed what he wanted, and with a small sigh asked: “Anything you want to ask?”<br />
Luke looked unsure, but asked: “You gave me my wished changes, without anything for you in return. Why?”<br />
Mark laughed at that a bit. “For one, as you are my servant, you will somewhat work your debt away. And I made you strong enough to fly me around if I want you to, so I will also profit from your wings in a way. You also fit into my other pets, if I call them that, as there is no cat with them. Also, the reason I asked what you would want was that I didn´t really had an idea what to do with you. I toyed with giving you an extra set of arms, to make your work easier, or if you would be my ride around in a way, be it as a mount or something flying. The last one, as I said, I got from you with your own wish. At least one time I can be somewhat generous. I forced you into servitude for me, after all. Are you satisfied with that?”<br />
Luke nodded. “Yeah, thanks for the explanation.” He still didn´t like the whole servant situation any better than before, but hey, he got his wishes fulfilled, and maybe Mark would get bored of having a servant and release him, right?<br />
