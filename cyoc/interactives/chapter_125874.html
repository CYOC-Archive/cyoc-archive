&quot;_&quot; speech<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
Isaac woke up with a jolt.<br />
<br />
He was sweating hard. That dream felt so real.<br />
<br />
But just to make sure... &#39;Ilivir? Dark Isaac?&#39; Isaac mentally spoke.<br />
<br />
...no response. <br />
<br />
Isaac let out a sigh of relief. Maybe it really was a dream... <br />
<br />
&#39;NOPE!&#39; Dark Isaac shouted in Isaac&#39;s head. Giving him a headache in the process.<br />
<br />
 &#39;Good morning Isaac.&#39; Ilivir greeted.<br />
<br />
So he really is hearing voices in his head...<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I forgot to mention something while you were dreaming. Remember that black and red crystal that represents your soul? The black part is me.&quot; Dark Isaac said with pride.<br />
<br />
Having two other people share his halo is going to take some getting used to...<br />
<br />
Isaac thought about the visions he saw. A couple of them showed that old witch who offered to take his cock away. But why did she need his cock. Then a thought struck him. He recalled that lab filled with disembodied cocks. Did they trespassed on that witch&#39;s mansion? But why would she be here on the cloud plane! The last he saw of her, she was on the material plane. But how could she live here? But then again, that would explain all that stuff from the material plane. Maybe she has the ability to transport to other worlds? The best he can do for now is speculate. <br />
<br />
As Isaac looked around the front porch, he saw that it stopped raining and it is now morning. Mary was putting away the nap sacks.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good morning Mary.&quot; Isaac greeted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good morning Isaac. Help me pack up. I don&#39;t want to be around when the owner of this mansion returns.&quot; Mary seems a lot more relaxed this morning. Sleeping really helped.<br />
<br />
Once Isaac finished packing up, he noticed that his oracle hand mirror was missing!<br />
<br />
&quot;Mary! Were is the hand mirror!&quot; Isaac shouted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nat borrowed it while you were asleep. She&#39;s out practicing her magic as we speak.&quot; Mary was busy packing up her bag but she spared enopugh effort to point the general direction she went.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you!&quot; Was all Isaac said when he ran into the forest looking for Nat.<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
As Isaac ran in the general direction Mary pointed, he heard familiar voices in his head. &quot;Well would you look at that! That girl had the balls to steal your mirror! You better punish her!&quot; Dark Isaac encouraged.<br />
<br />
&quot;That girl&#39;s magic is no match for my high paladin magic! I will show her what it means to steal from a paladin!&quot; Ilivir quipped.<br />
<br />
Isaac has no intention of losing control of his body yet.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shut up you guys&quot; He muttered to himself.<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
Eventually, he saw Nat crying next to a tree. When he came closer, he saw that she was holding the oracle hand mirror. <br />
<br />
As Isaac stepped closer, Nat saw him coming. &quot;You! You didn&#39;t tell me this thing could show me what could happen!&quot; She accused.<br />
<br />
&quot;I-I didn&#39;t know of it&#39;s power until I found out while I was asleep!&quot; Isaac defended.<br />
<br />
Nat looked skeptical but then she looked defeated.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wanted to know if I would be able to save the town if you didn&#39;t came... And the hand mirror showed just that.&quot; Nat turned to Isaac with tears in her eyes. &quot;If you didn&#39;t came... Me and my entire town would be completely erased! No one survived! I... was killed by lighting...&quot;<br />
<br />
Isaac was shocked by what Nat saw, but he also wasn&#39;t surprised. He remembered the vision were he, Mary and Ilivir went straight into the mountains. Nat was nowhere to be seen in that vision.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s done is done. No mater what path we take, not everybody is going to be saved. The best we can do is cherish what we do have. It&#39;s a good thing I came. Otherwise, you and Mary wouldn&#39;t be able to evacuate the survivors.&quot; Isaac reassured Nat. <br />
<br />
Come to think about it, if Isaac hadn&#39;t fought Azaviel, then Ilivir wouldn&#39;t have regained his humanity. Sure, he doesn&#39;t have a body anymore but at least he doesn&#39;t have to obey Isaac&#39;s commands anymore. Ilivir was free and Isaac is happy for that.<br />
<br />
Out of pure emotion, Nat passionately hugged Isaac. &quot;Thank you for bringing Marry. You saved my life.&quot;<br />
<br />
The two shared the embrace for only a few more moments.<br />
<br />
As the two let go, Nat regained her composer. &quot;Isaac? can you keep a secret?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What is it?&quot; Isaac asked curiously.<br />
<br />
&quot;I also took something from the mansion. A pen.&quot; Nat admitted.<br />
<br />
&quot;A pen? Where is it?&quot; Isaac asked. That pen could be be magical.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s in my pocket.&quot; Nat pulled out a normal looking ink pen. Except that it&#39;s obviously from the material plane. <br />
<br />
&quot;Keep it safe.&quot; Isaac said.<br />
<br />
Nat nodded and put it back in her pocket. She then preceded to give back Isaac&#39;s mirror.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry for taking it without asking.&quot; Nat apologized.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s okay.&quot; Isaac couldn&#39;t help but smile. Nat is starting to feel like a little sister to him. Maybe it&#39;s because she looks like a little kid? <br />
<br />
&#39;When are you going to make her your spawn?&#39; Dark Isaac taunted. <br />
<br />
Isaac chose to ignore him.<br />
<br />
While Isaac was distracted, Nat decided to shoot some fire balls at some trees and vent some emotion.<br />
<br />
The trees evaporated upon impact.<br />
<br />
&quot;That was impressive. Not the most creative use of magic I seen though.&quot; Isaac observed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whatever do you mean?&quot; Nat inquired.<br />
<br />
&quot;I mean Nathan the human sorcerer could do more then just shoot fireballs at trees. He would explore different different methods in using his magic.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;For example.&quot; Isaac touched a tree and started chanting. In a few moments, the cloud tree started steaming. until it burst into flames. &quot;See what I did there? I summoned the fireball inside the tree.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nat&#39;s eyes were wide open with awe.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let me show you another trick.&quot; Isaac held out a ball of magical light. &quot;This is standard paladin magic.&quot; Isaac explained.<br />
<br />
Nat was about to burst with excitement. But then she had a thought.<br />
<br />
&quot;Um, Isaac? Can I ask you something?&quot; Nat asked shyly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes. What is it?&quot; Isaac asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can you train me to be a Palidin and teach me all the magic you know? With Nathan gone, I&#39;ll need another teacher to substitute for him. You&#39;re the second best person to be my teacher. Can you also train me in using a sword? I understand I can&#39;t rely on my magic everything.&quot; Nat explained.<br />
<br />
Isaac couldn&#39;t be any more happy. &quot;I&#39;ll be glad to.&quot; Isaac accepted. <br />
<br />
Nat jumped for joy. &quot;Yipee!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
&#39;I hate kids.&#39; Ilivir commented.</p>
