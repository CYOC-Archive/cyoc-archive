<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Frightened, panicking, his voice barely coming as squeak, Dylan thought about trying to clear his throat and try again. Swallowing, the door starting to swing open a little wider, the panic he was feeling getting the best of him, Dylan grabbed the first thing nearest to him, dropped to the floor and rolled under the bench. Finding a small clearance between the floor and the partition wall, watching as the door opened some more and a voice he was sure he&#39;d heard somewhere called out, &quot;Don&#39;t wander out of my sight,&quot; Dylan rolled into the next changing stall.<br />
<br />
Barely fitting, hearing someone entering the next changing room over, he realised that what he&#39;d grabbed was the plush unicorn. Thinking, &quot;Dammit,&quot; and cursing that he hadn&#39;t thought to grab his clothes, he turned back to wall, thinking that, if he could, he&#39;d grab his clothes the first chance he got.<br />
<br />
To his dismay, he found only a solid wall going all the way down to the floor. Pressing a hand to the wood, feeling the splintery surface, Dylan thought, &quot;What the hell. I just came through there.&quot;<br />
<br />
Confused, rolling out from under the bench, thinking this would give him a better view, he set the plush off to the side. Expecting at any moment to hear someone complaining about someone leaving their clothes, Dylan stared despondently at the wall. Outside the dressing room, he could hear someone moving about, going through a nearby rack of clothes, whilst in the next stall over he could hear someone moving about. Wondering what he should do, scared about being discovered, Dylan slowly sitting up, he looked in the direction of the mirror hanging on the back of the door and confirmed that he at least looked like his normal self.<br />
<br />
&quot;Albeit, my normal self wearing clothes that should not fit me and are totally inappropriate for a boy,&quot; and standing, the familiar voice calling out, &quot;Try on this one, okay,&quot; Dylan tried to sort out what was going on.<br />
<br />
After a couple seconds, the familiar voice saying the person in the next dressing room should try on something else, Dylan decided that he must have somehow been mistaken. Looking at his reflection, he reasoned, &quot;I probably just hit a loose chunk of wall that flopped back into place after I crawled through,&quot; and looking down at the front of his pants, hating how much the area looked like what would be normal for a girl, Dylan concluded his logic by thinking, &quot;And I must have been really panicking, as there is no way for boy parts to disappear. I just missed something when I stuck my hand down my pants.&quot;<br />
<br />
Unaware that he&#39;d started thinking of the clothes he was wearing as his, Dylan nodded and deciding that was he was thinking made the most sense, he took a deep breath and reached down for the button. Undoing the button, the familiar voice saying, &quot;You&#39;re going to look really pretty when you start the first grade,&quot; Dylan paused a moment, took a couple more deep breathes, then as quickly as he could, pushed down on the waistline of the pants.<br />
<br />
The jeans puddling down around his ankle, Dylan ignored it as he stared at the front of his bodysuit. Thinking that it was way to flat and that he couldn&#39;t even see the familiar bulge of his boy parts, he almost giggled nervously. The familiar voice calling out, &quot;Diane? Oh! Where did that girl wonder off to now,&quot; Dylan reminded himself that it looked the same as when he first did up the snaps and that with how well he&#39;d tucked himself back, there wasn&#39;t any bulges. Reaching down, breathing heavily through his nose, Dylan was about to undo the snaps when, to his horror, the door of the changing room started to open.<br />
<br />
Hastily pulling up his pants, thinking, &quot;Oh for crying out loud,&quot; he buttoned the front and prepared himself to explain what he was doing.<br />
<br />
To his surprise, Dylan found himself looking at a very worn out looking woman who he recognized as Andrew&#39;s mom. Wondering why she looked the way she did, Dylan was caught unaware when the woman said, &quot;Dammit, Diane. What did I tell you about wandering off. Bring your plush and get out here,&quot; reached in and grabbed his hand.<br />
<br />
Baffled and overwhelmed by what was happening, Dylan had enough to squeal out, &quot;My Unicorn!&quot; in a voice he thought sounded suspiciously feminine and snatching up the plush, he was pulled out of the dressing room.<br />
<br />
Andrew&#39;s mom hauling him over to what looked like a car seat, complete with an infant girl, Dylan struggled to figure out what was happening. Being told, &quot;Wait here with Andrea whilst I go and check on Erica,&quot; Dylan was about to look down at the baby when out of the changing room he&#39;d started in stepped a six-year-old girl he realised was Erica.<br />
<br />
The perplexed feeling growing, noticing how fresh and young Erica looked, Dylan also found himself admiring the dress she was wearing. Trying to tell himself, &quot;You&#39;re a boy. You should think dresses look cute and pretty,&quot; he listened as Andrew&#39;s mother announced, &quot;You look gorgeous in that, Erica. And if we can get Diane a matching, the two of you will look adorable when you start the first grade in the fall,&quot; which only seemed to confuse him even more. Clutching the plush close, Dylan heard himself saying, &quot;You look very pretty, Erica,&quot; as he attempted to sort out when reality had taken a holiday and why he was being treated like a girl who was about six-year-old.</p>
