<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jennifer decided to explore towards the reptile section. She quickly galloped with her hooves as they take her to the room, where they contain snakes. Jennifer gently opened the door to find a mass array of snakes all coiled up and slithering against each other as if they are felling cold. Jennifer tentatively stepped into the room and grabbed a few snakes with her bare hand. The snakes didn&#39;t not react to her and continued their slithering and writhing. She found a large anaconda, that was the same width of her waist, which wasn&#39;t really wide. She yanked the anaconda out of the room and slowly plucked its head off. It fell lifelessly against the cement floor, as Jennifer detached her own body from her stallion. She signed in discomfort, she had grown accustomed to it. She gingerly snapped her waist onto the snake, and as if a lock ,it met and she was electrified with new found energy as she slowly supported herself with the tail, swishing about it the air. She carefully slithered along the floor whilst maintaining her body upright, like a naga she thought. <br />
<br />
Her lower body stretched at a long distance, almost 8 meters long. Yet Jennifer wasn&#39;t satisfied with this length. She went in the room and grabbed a few more snakes that were long in length that had a smilier pattern. She plucked their heads and tips off, and attached them to her tip until she managed to lengthen her tail up to 30 meters long. She slithered back into the room, and longed within the coils of snakes, and she mimicked them, slowly spiraling on the floor until she achieved a mound of her tails with her upper body perched on top. She marveled at her body, whilst gently stroking her scales, with a emerald green sheen, and a black diamond pattern along the back of her tail. She rubbed at her crouch and found a seam, and opened it up to find a vagina that was much more sensitive than hers. She gently tapped it, and she was rewarded with a mind shattering orgasm. She decided to do this later, and slowly uncoiled her snake body. She pondered over what else she could add to her body that was snake-like. She racked her brains, until she though of the trademarks of a snake. The tongue and fangs! She got the fangs and tongue from the anaconda head she started with, and replaced it with her teeth and tongue. She closed her mouth to get used to it, and opened wide. Her teeth were tipped, and her tongue constantly flicked out of her mouth to taste the air, with a 1 foot long tongue. She complained that she can&#39;t open her mouth wide enough, and replaced her jaw with a snake&#39;s. She carefully ripped the skin of her own jaw off, and took off the bone. She replaced it with the snake&#39;s jaw, and added her own muscle and skin on top. She widened her mouth and sure enough, it widened. Yet still she wasn&#39;t pleased with her own body. She looked in the mirror within the room full of snakes.<br />
<br />
She carefully examined the head of her anaconda snake, and plucked its eyeballs out, and replaced with her own. She blinked several times, and started to see in the infra-red spectrum. But surprisingly she could interchange between her normal vision. Maybe her body does need a strand of human left. She muttered whilst pondering on what else to do. She decided to replace her whole torso into a snake, but retaining her skin color and breasts. She removed her snake tail, and added another snake section on top of her body. She then exchanged their skins so that there are now 2 sections of skins, one human the other scales. She detached her head and put it on top of the new torso, and reattached her breasts and arms. She felt nothing different at first, but when she bended her back, she managed to use her head and touch the middle of her back, which was an incredible display of flexibility. She duplicated this method with her arms and neck, until her head was the only thing that was truly herself. But that was about to change when she replaced the bones and ligaments of her head by replace it with those of a snake. She originally had a head of a snake that has a human skin, but she added more bits and pieces so that it resembled a human head. She is now able to flex into any position she wants, since her body is connected by backbones, which means insane flexibility. She curled herself into a ball, and rolled around the room. She could twist her body around for more than 360 degrees, which also applies to any other joint and appendage. She even managed to squeeze herself through a pipe located around the sides of the room, which was no wider than 10 cm. She squeezed through the opening, and with slight maneuvers, she slipped like an eel into the pipe, slowly coursing through until she met the exit, which was the outside of the zoo, and met her car. She quickly squeeze out of the pipe like toothpaste, and slithered back into the room to recollect her own body parts. <br />
<br />
Suddenly an idea popped into her mind. She really liked this snake body, but she couldn&#39;t possibly go out like this. But she could retain her insane flexibility right? She quickly repeated her procedure to her legs, and quickly plopped all of her owned body parts into the car. She slithered back into the zoo to find more body parts to toy around with.</p>
