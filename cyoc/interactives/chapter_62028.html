<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">In front of the boys was a park map showing all the attractions and shows that are inside. The ocean front park was divided into four main areas. There were fast rides for the thrill seekers, slower rides for those that are not so adventurous, and carnival show. The forth was the beach side area of the park. It had all the amenities for a beach visit, changing rooms with showers, clothing store for those needing swimwear and its own refreshment stand.<br />
<br />
&quot;Look at this place.&quot; Jake says looking at the map. &quot;There are so many rides here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm not a big fan of fast rides.&quot; Eric said.<br />
<br />
&quot;A big guy like you is afraid of a few &quot;kiddy&quot; rides.&quot;<br />
<br />
Eric puts his hand on the map covering the rides. &quot;I didn't say I wouldn't ride them. I said I'm not a fan of big rides. I like the carnival games better.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well if you say so, but I'm still going to try to get you on every one of these rides before we go home&quot; Jake told his friend in an authoritative tone.<br />
<br />
&quot;You and what army?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You'll see.&quot; Jake said as he looked at the map again. &quot;Now let’s go find these carnival games of yours.&quot;<br />
Throughout the evening the boys tried all the games. They found out that the tickets they had were VIP passes entitling them free access to everything. As young boys often do they got bored very quickly and seek other forms of entertainment.  Eric still didn't want to do any of the fast rides even with Jake's constant name calling. The only thing they hadn't done yet were the side shows of oddities.<br />
 <br />
Most of the shows were performers dressed in costumes depicting human deformities. Most everyone viewing the shows knew that that were fake.  But there were a few performers that were good at their trade and left people wondering.<br />
<br />
&quot;What kind of prosaic do they think we're on?&quot;  Eric said pointing at one of the performers.  &quot;You can clearly see the seam on the costume, and look at that strongman. He has more fat on his body than a slab of bacon.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I see what you mean. If they are going to have a freak show strongman then he needs to have freaky muscles.&quot; Jake says to his friend. <br />
<br />
The boys didn't notice the necklace around Jake's neck begin glow.  As the boys walk away from the strong man the rest of the crowd noticed something strange was happening to the performer. In the middle of his power lift the strongman's expression changed from that of strain to one of bewilderment.  He drops the two hundred pound barbell to the padded platform, narrowly missing his feet. The crowd watched as the strongman began to sweat profusely. Beads of perspiration trickled down his body. As the fat liquefied and exited the body the skin began to closely hug the muscles underneath. <br />
 <br />
The remaining crowd stood dumbfounded at what they were witnessing. The once three pound strongman was quickly losing over a third of his body weight to the exiting liquid. His sweat soaked unitard hung off the trim body like a Roman Toga. No matter how many times he did it the strongman could not keep the one shoulder from falling down. But before anyone could react to what they just saw the strongman's body began to change again. <br />
<br />
When all the fat left the body, the strongman's skin had shrunk wrapped itself around the remaining muscles. The closest ones to the stage could see the network of blood vessels under the skin pumping blood throughout the body. Than the oddest thing started to happen the circulatory system began to pulsate.  It all started in the central area of the chest with the blood vessels exiting the heart. With each beat of the heart, pulses of blood surged through the veins. The blood gorged veins radiated throughout the body feeding the muscles with nourishment. The more the muscles feed the larger they all got. <br />
 <br />
It was a slow process but the strongman’s body began to expand larger. The skin still hugged the growing body, never showing any signs of tearing. Just like the muscles it covered, it too was nourished and grew in size.  <br />
<br />
Pictorial muscles grew bigger creating a shelf jutting out six inches from the rest of the body. Shoulders muscles grew higher as the neck muscles grew thicker. Soon it looked like the strongman didn’t have a neck at all. In a comical way the strongman’s head now look to small for his larger body. The growing lat muscles pushed the arms upwards away from the body. The higher the arms went the bigger they got. The growing biceps and triceps muscles fought for dominance to be the bigger muscle of the upper arm.  Neither would relinquish its status but conceded to combine their size to be as big as their owners head. The forearm, though not as impressive, did grow bigger. Just like its northern neighbor, it increased in size. The one thing it shares with the upper arm was the impressive vascular system that lay just under the skin. Each huge arm was forced to hang at a forty five degree angle away from the body.<br />
<br />
The abdominal muscles started off well defined for a normal fit person but soon grew well beyond that. Each protrusion was slightly offset from its neighbor and there were eight such protrusions forming a well defined, rock hard waist. The sight of the external oblique muscles that framed the waist, along with the latissimus dorsi muscles only hinted at what changes occurred to the back.<br />
<br />
Although the crowd could not see the changes the back went through it turned out to be an impressive back. The upper back was now as wide as two normal men. It looked like the strongman was in a constant &quot;most muscular&quot; pose. The classic &quot;V&quot; look could not describe the cobra hood of a back the strongman now had. It only helped accentuate how small his waist line was. Just below the &quot;Christmas tree” of the lower back two fleshy globes formed a hard striated ass that was soft to the touch. The material of the unitard dove deeply into his ass creating two distinct globes.<br />
<br />
All the muscles of the body grew larger at the same time but none of them showed as little change as the legs did. The years of lifting heavy weights had built up the strongman's legs bigger than any power lifter.  The legs may have only shrunk down a few inches in diameter when the fat melted away but their transformation was just as dramatic.  The growing abductor and adductor muscles increased the width of the leg, while the flexion and extension muscles increase its thickness. The calf muscles completed the leg transformation by growing larger than a football.<br />
<br />
Throughout the body the network of blood vessels had pumped nourishment to every muscle of the body. Every muscle had grown to freakish proportion by doubling in size. Even the network of blood vessels kept their larger size. The one blood vessel that grew the biggest was hidden under the strongman's tight unitard. <br />
<br />
It did not start out as an impressive bulge but it did end up as one. All though the strongman's transformation the crowd watched him grow, only a select few saw how much he enjoyed it. At the beginning of the transformation his cock only grew a little larger. The years of drug induced growth had taken its toll his family jewels.  Quarter inch by quarter inch it grew back to the size it should have been, but the growth didn't stop there. The flaccid size of six inches gave way to seven than eight than nine finally stopping at ten. A smile of enjoyment appeared on the strongman's face as the growth continued. His almost non-existing testicles returned to life as they grew. The sudden infusion of testosterone pushed the strongman's body over the edge. The already larger than life muscles slowly doubled in size creating a true freak show strongman. The material of the unitard could not hold back the growing bulk for long. Tears began to form all over the unitard. There was a long ripping sound followed by a collective gasp and the unitard was no more.<br />
<br />
Before the crowd stood the epitome of man, his larger than life muscles were on display for all to see. The strongman never felt more alive in his life. His ten inch cock sprang to life. The bigger it got the longer it got, the longer it got the harder it got. Before his second chance at life the strongman's minuscule three inch cock pointed downward, but now its ten inch predecessor had grown to an impressive twelve hard inches. It proudly stood straight as a flag pole for all to see.<br />
<br />
Some of the ladies in the crowd fainted while others lusted after what they saw. Even the men were affected by what stood before them on the stage. Many of them were in envy at what they saw. Being in close proximity to the freakishly large strongman had an effect on them.  Quite a few of them were enjoying what they saw to the point of sporting a boner in the crowd. The pheromone level the strong man was giving off was too much for many in the crowd to handle. They jumped up on the stage and began to caress and fondle every part of the strongman’s body. It didn't take long for all the attention he was getting for the strongman to lose what little control he had over his body. Like a hot springs geyser the strongman shot his load high into the air.<br />
<br />
Elsewhere in the park Jake and Eric were oblivious at what they had just missed, but the wake of changes was close behind them.</p>
