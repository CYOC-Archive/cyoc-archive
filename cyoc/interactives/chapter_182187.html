<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Merritt had several more dates with beautiful Etta and he couldn&#39;t help but notice how any room she was in, she caught the eye of everyone present.  They didn&#39;t all just gawk at her, though some did.  But they all did double takes or snuck additional glances at her.  Most reflexively smiled.  There was an inherent power to being a beautiful woman.<br />
<br />
Merritt knew that a standard feature of spycraft was the honeypot, the beautiful woman who reeled in an agent of the other side pretending to have found him attractive or irresistible no matter how dumpy his appearance.<br />
<br />
He thought back to when he was a 12 year old boy being mocked for taking ballet class by being called &quot;Mary&quot; by other kids at school.  He sighed.  His new female name wouldn&#39;t be hard to choose.  But the rest of this transformation was hard to decide on.  Merritt went back and forth between wanting to give himself huge breasts or average size ones, a bigger, fuller ass or a smaller, tighter caboose.  There were so many other choices possible, too, eye color, hair color, wavy, curly or straight, how long, eyelashes, lips, legs etc etc.<br />
<br />
Merritt felt overwhelmed by all the choices but then saw that he could just transform into a female version of himself and set the attractiveness of his new identity from 1-100 and that the Chronivac would decide about the shape of his eyes, how full his lips would be etc etc.  He decided to make the female him the 100th percentile of attractiveness of a transgender him.<br />
<br />
Merritt set the transformation to take two minutes instead of the one minute he&#39;d mostly used.  And he set the context of the transformation that everyone would think he&#39;d always been female.  He left his mind unchanged and he set the time of the transformation at 24 hours.  Etta was seeing her parents in another state so this was a good time to try this.<br />
<br />
Merritt took off all his clothes and gave a deep sigh.  &quot;Here goes,&quot; he said looking down at his epic penis before pressing START on the laptop and answering the ARE YOU SURE? prompting by clicking it again.  An electromagnetic wave passed through Merritt from the emitter.<br />
<br />
He felt . . odd sensations here and there but saw no significant change right away.  &quot;When&#39;s it gonna kick in?&quot; wondered Merritt aloud but the voice was not his masculine bass.  Instead it was a high, sultry feminine voice.<br />
&quot;Oh!&quot;<br />
Merritt felt his shoulders losing muscle and his already thin waist getting narrower and narrower.  <br />
&quot;Oh!&quot;<br />
Merritt reached down with hands that were shrinking and felt his widening hips.  In front of those hips, his huge penis got shorter and shorter, thinner and thinner till it and his balls simply disappeared and were replaced by the lips of her pussy.  At her chest, perfect round breasts had sprouted, getting larger and larger till they were C cup size bordering on D cups.  Lastly, Mary felt her face changing shape and her chestnut brown hair growing to shoulder length and getting slightly wavy.<br />
<br />
When it was all done, Mary marched into the bathroom and weighed and measured herself.  She found that she now stood five foot ten and weighed 120 pounds.  Mary, just a few minutes ago Merritt, gawked at her reflection.  She was gorgeous.  She had startling bright green eyes and full round lips, her breasts were fantastic, especially for a slender girl like her.  Mary gave her own surprisingly full, round ass a spank.  <br />
&quot;What a fantastic rear I have!&quot; she cooed, surprised again at how feminine her new voice was.  Mary, still mentally Merritt, could not resist.  &quot;I look like a Victoria&#39;s Secrets model,&quot; she gasped wetting one finger and tracing circles around her lips before reaching inside and gently then firmly rubbing her new clit at a gradually increasing pace.<br />
<br />
“. . Oh!”<br />
<br />
The tingly waves of pleasure amazed her.  She could feel them all over.  This was fantastic.  Mary pleasured herself three straight times before sighing.  &quot;Okay, okay . . gotta . .  gotta get used to being this outside.&quot;<br />
She went into her bedroom which was now decorated in a style featuring  pinks and flowers.  In the dresser drawer which had had Merritt&#39;s black speedo on top of some board shorts, there was now a small black bikini.  Mary shrugged.  Why not?<br />
<br />
She also noticed that the collage picture of events of Merritt&#39;s childhood on the dresser was now a collage of pictures of . . Mary&#39;s childhood.  There she was on her first day of school.  There were several of her in a tutu performing ballet  There was another of a boy pinning a corsage onto her dress before prom, one of her taking ballet in college, another of her graduating.<br />
<br />
Like I&#39;d always been a girl, marveled Mary.  <br />
<br />
She decided to dive right into the pool metaphorically, even if she probably wouldn&#39;t literally.  Mary pulled on the skimpy bikini.  As small as Merritt&#39;s speedo was, it covered nearly all of his spectacular track star and ballet dancer&#39;s ass.  This was different.  The top could only cover half of her wonderful breasts but this seemed much more adequate, somehow, than the 50% of her great ass that the bottom covered.  <br />
<br />
Mary kept trying, to no avail, to stretch the bottom to cover more of her.  Eventually, she just shrugged and a few minutes later marched over to the apartment complex pool in Merritt&#39;s male track star glide.   <br />
<br />
As she entered the fenced in area, she saw everyone gawking at her.  She lay down in the sun to work on her tan.  But every minute or so another guy came up to make a pass at her.  God, they were pathetic and Mary, still Merritt inside, had no interest in any guy.<br />
<br />
That night, she went out to a  club.  It was crazy.  It seemed like every male in attendance, and 10% of the females hit on her.  It was actually quite a burden to Mary, being unaccustomed to such attention.  As Merritt, she&#39;d met beautiful women who were expert at fending off all this attention with only the slightest effort.  Mary wasn&#39;t quite sure how to handle it and somehow this sent out the wrong signal till she was nearly swarmed.  <br />
<br />
She went home and watched a little TV then went to bed.  She woke up in momentary shock at her gorgeous female body but quickly remembered.  She changed into a sports bra and some shorts and went running, just curious how much less athletic she was like this than as Merritt.  The answer was a lot.  But she was struck just as much by the way everyone gawked at her.<br />
<br />
She had never quite appreciated how beautiful girls had to fend off all the attention they got.  Even somebody&#39;s 11 year old son had stared and stared at her breasts in the apartment building elevator.  As Merritt she&#39;d just been one more guy trying to make it with those beautiful girls.    <br />
<br />
But, other than the issue of dealing with everyone&#39;s reaction to her beauty, it wasn&#39;t a bad first test drive.  Female orgasms had been wonderful and the Chronivac had done a fantastic job of filling in a back story.  All her neighbors really believed that there had never been a guy, Merritt, in that apartment.  So, when the 24 hours were up and Mary turned back into Merritt, he was happy to be his real self again but it wasn&#39;t a tremendous relief at escaping an ordeal.</p>
