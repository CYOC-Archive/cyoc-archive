<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Monday morning meant going to work for Brooke. She worked as a check out chick at a local supermarket and was on her feet all day. Without thinking she put on her uniform and her usual work shoes leaving her magical shoes still in their box in her wardrobe. It wasn’t until lunchtime that with aching feet she realised what a fool she had been. She could have just turned her magical shoes into a more comfortable copy of the black flats she was wearing. <br />
<br />
Brooke arrived home with stiff legs and sore feet. She immediately changed out of her work clothes into an old sundress and lay on her couch with her legs up. She ruefully wished she had an “Air leg massager” like her Aunt Caroline who had circulation problems.<br />
<br />
Then the idea hit her. She could have her own massager all she had to do was open her magical shoe box. She rushed to her room and wardrobe where from the shoe box she pulled out a “Air Leg Massager” identical to her aunts. She returned to her lounge and spent the next 5 minutes assembling the foam pads around her legs. She plugged it into the wall and immediately her legs felt so much better. She was very pleased with her magical shoes and told them that tomorrow she would wear them to work.<br />
<br />
However Brooke eventually had to get up to fix herself dinner, so she had began to dissemble the apparatus when another thought came to her. She recalled what the wizard had told her about her shoes. She only had to think about them and she could change their form into whatever she wanted. That is what she had been doing yesterday when she was wearing the various celebrity shoes. She didn’t have to disassemble the “Air Leg Massager” all she need to do was to wish it’s form changed.  She wished the shoes would become a pair of massaging sports tights. <br />
<br />
But nothing happened. Her shoes remained the assemblage of foam pads and electrical wires that was a an “Air leg Massager”.<br />
<br />
Concerned for an instant Brooke sat in shock and tried to recall exactly what the wizard had said. Of course! It hit her. Her shoes were shoes! They had to encompass her feet! The massage tights she had in her mind were leggings that finished at her ankles. Feeling clever once more Brooke wished “That my shoes become long massage socks”. <br />
<br />
She smiled with satisfaction as the “Air leg massager” shank into itself and morphed into knee high black compression socks. Feeling very clever Brooke then wished that “My massage socks extend up to my thighs”  <br />
<br />
Brooke watched as the socks grew up her leg only stopping midway up her thighs. Pleased with the result Brooke thought in her head “I want my massage leggings to continually massage my legs so they feel like the “Air Leg Massager””<br />
<br />
She immediately felt the pleasant pulsing as her legs were gently massaged. Thinking “This is fantastic” Brooke decided to go further “I want my massage leggings to feel and look like silk stockings” <br />
<br />
She had to correct herself quickly when the leggings changed into silk stockings but the massaging stopped “I want my silk stockings to massage my legs like a “Air Leg Massager” Immediately the pulsing resumed.<br />
<br />
Brooke went to the kitchen and made herself an omelet in her stocking clad legs. The whole time she was cooking her legs were being gently massaged by her stockings.<br />
<br />
As she was cooking she thought to test further what her shoes could do. “Okay shoes can you remain as my massaging silk stockings but I want the part of you surrounding my foot to become the silver Jimmy Choo shoes you were on Saturday. You will be one piece of clothing”<br />
To Brookes delight the silk encompassing her feet morphed into the silver Jimmy Choo shoes, with the added the extra inch to the heels. She still felt the gentle massaging of her legs. It was wonderful! Her legs looked fantastic and felt fantastic!<br />
<br />
Brooke ate her omelet then rushed to her room. Her shoes and stockinged legs deserved a dressier top! There she changed out of her sundress into the sky blue gown she had worn to her school formal 4 years ago. The dress had a split all the way up to her waist and as she walked her stockings and shoes would became visible. She teamed the outfit with matching sky-blue panties. <br />
<br />
Another thought came to Brooke as she admired herself in her mirror “Shoes. Can you stay as you currently are but also extend further up my legs and become a suspender belt in the same shading as my panties” Brooke squealed with delight as sky-blue straps began to grow from the top of her stockings and wrapped themselves around her waist. Within 30 seconds they had become a suspender belt with lace that matched that on the front of her panties.<br />
<br />
Feeling turned on Brooke made up her face as if she was heading out then went to her lounge. There she opened Netflix and looked up movies with the same actor she had seen last night. Jim Sturgess was his name. She found him in another movie “Across the universe” made herself comfortable on the couch and lay down to enjoy the movie. All the time her stockings gently massaged her legs. Her shoes looked great and were so comfortable it felt like she wasn’t wearing any. She also loved the way the satin of her dress felt against the silk of her stockings. <br />
 <br />
As Brooke watched the movie she was again reminded as to how much the actor resembled the footballer she had danced with the other night. They shared many facial features including their smiles. Brooke found it very easy to imagine she was the actors love interest. When the two leads had a kissing scene Brookes imagination drifted back to dancing with the footballer the other night. She imagined that he had clasped her in his strong arms and was kissing her just like the actor on the show. Unconsciously Brooke’s hand had found the slit in her dress and her fingers found her clit beneath her panties and were giving it a gentle rub.<br />
<br />
Her former boyfriend meantime, now a combination of shoes, silk stockings and a garter belt was losing himself in bliss. Even though he didn’t possess eyes he was aware of Brooke gently stimulating herself. He was dying to volunteer to help her out. If only she had asked him to become her panties as well – It could have been him gently massaging Brooke’s clit. It’s not as if he wasn’t enjoying massaging her legs and feet but he just knew there was more he could give.<br />
<br />
However all things must end. The movie ended and Brooke reluctantly took herself to bed. She undressed and put her shoes back in their box and back into the wardrobe. In bed alone Brooke shut her eyes and imagined the footballer come movie star was in there beside her and that it was his fingers massaging her clit, not her own.<br />
…………..<br />
Her shoes were sad to be put back in the box and tucked away in the wardrobe. The former boyfriend had the feeling that he had returned to being a shapeless blob, it had actually felt great to be made of silk. Now after hours of bliss he was alone in the dark and reflected on what had happened. It felt to him the Brooke had forgotten who he was. She had not un-muted him and his unspoken pleading to be remembered and changed back to himself had not been heard. Not that he had helped himself. When he was in physical contact with Brooke he knew he became a quivering mess. He needed to learn how to control his emotions and somehow communicate with Brooke. How? He didn’t know. But he did know that was what he needed to work towards and he had a lot of idle time in this box to think about it.</p>
