<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Nate and Aidan&#39;s dreams were an emotionally psychedelic cacophony of infantile imagery. Nate was dreaming that he was surrounded everywhere by thick, crunchy, diaper material. It was soft, and plasticky, and perfect. The smoothly polished surfaces seemed to grab at his naked skin as he moved. The material was practically alive with contradictory behaviors, sometimes it was impossibly slick and other times aggressively grabby with seemingly infinite amounts of friction. His feet sank deep into the endless padding beneath him. He couldn&#39;t lift his legs high enough to free them the material was so deep and accommodatingly soft... Aidan on the other hand, found himself floating in a sea of individual diapers. As far as he could see there was endless sparkling white. He was bobbing joyfully atop the expansive diaper ocean in his own pair of extra jumbo inflated diapers. They were so overly padded that his legs were forcefully splayed apart. His giant diaper kept him from sinking into the diapery deep, but he was so top heavy he couldn&#39;t keep his face above &#39;diaper level&#39; for very long. Both men felt an inexplicable, and deeply penetrating euphoric elation as they dreamt. The feeling was heavenly, like a buzzing tickle all around their diapered waists... It seemed to go on for hours...<br />
<br />
Nate awoke slowly with a groggy cloud over his mind...<br />
<br />
&quot;What happened?&quot; He wondered...<br />
<br />
It was as if their pseudo-sexual playtime had culminated in some kind of post-orgasmic drowsiness that they just couldn&#39;t shake, but there hadn&#39;t been any orgasm... Just nap time. Neither of them had been able to stay awake... It was impossible... But the dream was so sensual and perfect, maybe that WAS the orgasm... Nate wanted to do it again... He felt the urge to get right back to crinkling Aidan&#39;s adorably swaddled buns but his attention was suddenly drawn to a strange foreign object he felt wedged oddly between their lovingly nested pelvises.<br />
<br />
Readjusting himself and jostling Aidan awake, Nate reached down between them and fished out a heavy, stinking, vaguely triangularly shaped wad of used diaper...<br />
<br />
&quot;My GOD, the dream I was having...&quot; Aidan moaned... It was incredible...<br />
<br />
&quot;I know what you mean.&quot; Nate replied, his eyes bulging at the thought... &quot;But have a look at this...&quot;<br />
<br />
Nate held up the mysterious dirty diaper for Aidan to inspect; slightly put off, but oddly allured by the powerful odor it was broadcasting.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is there... Poop in there?&quot; Aidan asked dumbly, looking strangely enchanted...<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s definitely a poopy one...&quot; Nate replied, suppressing a giggle...<br />
<br />
Nate tossed the soiled nappie towards Aiden who caught it happily, despite it&#39;s foul content.<br />
<br />
&quot;Woah, it&#39;s heavy! A lot heavier than I expected.&quot; Aidan exclaimed with developing excitement and wonder...<br />
<br />
&quot;Is it, uh.. Yours?&quot; Nate asked slyly.<br />
<br />
&quot;No! it&#39;s not mine!&quot; Aidan protested. &quot;See, I&#39;m still wearing mine...&quot;<br />
<br />
He demonstrated the fact by tugging at his crotch in an adorably overeager display.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well so am I&quot; Nate replied &quot;But I found that in your bed with us just now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nuh-uh.&quot; Aidan said with a smile.. &quot;It&#39;s yours... Has to be.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why do you say that?&quot; Nate asked, his smile fading away, becoming serious.<br />
<br />
&quot;Cuz I really gotta go to the bathroom right now...&quot; Aidan replied with a jovial, teasing smile. &quot;And guess what? I&#39;m holding it in just fine... I&#39;m afraid you were the only deuce dropper in that bed...&quot;<br />
<br />
Suddenly Aidan heard the voice return to the back of his head &quot;I want to USE diapers...&quot;<br />
<br />
Aidan stopped smiling and gasped... his eyes going wide as a he stood frozen in place...<br />
<br />
He bit his lower lip in discomfort as the front of his diapers darkened and yellowed. They began to sag and bulge taking on a mealy, gloopy consistency with visible voids and air pockets adding to the unique and one-of-a-kind result...<br />
<br />
Nate&#39;s eyes were big, his jaw practically to the floor. He was totally mesmerized by the event... He wanted to do that too...<br />
<br />
&quot;I wanna use diapers&quot; Nate whispered to himself...<br />
<br />
Aidan experimentally pulled at the pieces of tape at his sides. But they were still totally fused with the diaper. He tried getting his fingers under the waistband but that was still sealed too.<br />
<br />
&quot;How did you get yours off?&quot; Aidan said in frustration...<br />
<br />
&quot;I didn&#39;t...&quot; Nate replied honestly. &quot;It was just there when I woke up... Maybe it wasn&#39;t mine after all. Maybe it was... like... your teddy bear in this reality or something.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I want it off!&quot; Aidan said growing upset. &quot;I mean... Sure I want to wear diapers... and... OK I do want to use them too... but I&#39;d like a fresh one when I&#39;m done...&quot;<br />
<br />
Aidan grabbed at the front of his squishy soiled diaper and pulled as hard as he could but it was no use. The gooey compacted contents just sludged around disgustingly, slurping and sluicing over his confined body parts. The smell was starting to fill the room... Aidan couldn&#39;t live like this... What happened when he had to poop again? Would it just keep getting dirtier and dirtier?<br />
<br />
As if in answer to his question, Aidan&#39;s diaper began to expand. It was filling up more and more by the second... It looked like it was about to pop!<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s going on? Are you pooping again already!&quot; Nate cried with mixed alarm and excitement.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know. I don&#39;t think so... It&#39;s different. It&#39;s just growing...&quot; Aidan replied with bridled fear.<br />
<br />
&quot;OOHh... It feels amazing, though!&quot; He bellowed, his knees going weak and buckling from the euphoria.<br />
<br />
Just then the diaper stopped expanding and there was an audible *POP* as the tape on either side of the diaper released and the diaper instantly bound itself up into a tight, tidy diaper ball that fell on the ground between Aidan&#39;s legs with a *Schlorp*, revealing a new and pristine looking diaper proudly hugging Aidan&#39;s waist and crotch completely.<br />
<br />
Aidan reached down and experimentally tested the new diaper for any weakness in its defenses. He grabbed and pulled at it in every direction, even attempting to tear the thin material but it held completely firm to him, just like the old one.<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess that answers that.&quot; Aidan said, finally satisfied.<br />
<br />
&quot;That was awesome! I can&#39;t wait to try that!&quot; Nate shouted, beaming a brilliant, adorable smile and shaking with excitement.</p>
