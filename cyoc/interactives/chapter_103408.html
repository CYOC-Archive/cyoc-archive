<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">During a hot summer day, 11 years old Patrick and his best friend, Ryan, were playing in Patrick&#39;s backyard. They&#39;re enjoying their vacations since Ryan&#39;s parents had taken a trip to Bahamas and he was living in his best friend house for a week.<br />
Patrick lived on the edge of a small town where a lot of people used to have farms, stabbles and stuff like that. Patrick&#39;s family had a grocery store in the downtown where they sell some things that local people produced like meat, milk or vegetables. They used to be too much time in the store that Patrick and Ryan had full house just for them.<br />
Patrick&#39;s house wasn&#39;t too big, but it had a big backyard where Patrick liked to play with his bike or with some animals that his parents bred, a couple of pigs and a few chickens.<br />
<br />
That day Patrick and Ryan had played all day under the sun and run around the backyard for some hours. At noon, both felt tired and thirsty, so they decided to go inside the house and look for something to drink. Ironically, the fridge was almost empty and the only thing to drink in the house was some juice cans that Patrick&#39;s parents had said were to sell in the grocery. Ryan tried to convince Patrick to open just one, but Patrick wasn&#39;t sure about it. It was a unusual juice that his parents had never allow him to drink, he thought that they could have alcohol inside, so he was scared of drinking something like that.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, if you&#39;re not going to open a juice can. Can we drink some water at least?&quot; Ryan said, but Patrick explained that water in that town needed some process to become drinkable. The only way to do it its by a machine that just his father knew how to turn on. Ryan was becoming impatient, he really wants something to refresh him. Patrick tried to look for something to drink in a cupboard but it was useless. He proposed to go to his parent&#39;s store and ask them for some water, but they were too far from the downtown and the heat wasn&#39;t helping too much. Finally, Ryan said that he prefered to wait until they arrive, but Patrick said that his parents used to come back very late.<br />
<br />
Both kids were almost to give it up when Ryan remembered something that he saw in the backyard. &quot;Over the bottom wall, I saw some apples, maybe we can take a few to eat. That&#39;s better than nothing!&quot; But Patrick told him that those fruits were on his neighbor&#39;s yard and that man didn&#39;t like to share them. &quot;He won&#39;t notice two apple are missing.&quot; After some insistence, Patrick finally agreed to take the fruit.<br />
<br />
They crossed the backyard until they were right in front to the bottom wall and under some apple tree branches. Unfortunately, they were too high and both kids were too small. They tried to take one by climbing over the other one shoulders, but it was useless. Their only option was to climb the wall which had some slots that they could use to reach the top. A few minutes later, both kids were over the wall which was two times their sizes. They became amazed of the magnificent sight of the neighbor&#39;s yard. A very vast field full with all kind of fruits, apples, pears, bananas, grapes and cherries. It was like the garden of Eden. Ryan thought that taking a couple of apple was a waste of this incredible opportunity, so he pushed Patrick to descend to his neighbor&#39;s field. Patrick agreed just to look the amazing trees.<br />
<br />
Patrick was looking at the beautiful grape vines which shined because of the sun, the big watermelon fields that looked like a perfect photograph and the interesting banana trees with colorful flower. Meanwhile, Ryan was trying to take some apples, oranges and pears from the trees on the other side. He had taken a couple of each one and a big honeydew melon he had found nearby. Then, he go to where Patrick was in order to share the fruits.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s unbelievable. I had heard these trees grow on different environment. I wonder how my neighbor was able to make these to grown here.&quot; Patrick said while he was touching a watermelon.<br />
<br />
&quot;It doesn&#39;t matter. Look, I have enough fruit for both.&quot; Ryan said while he was offering an apple to his friend. Patrick was too distracted that he didn&#39;t even look at Ryan. He was lost in the watermelons in front of him, their shinning green skin and the healthy vines around them. He was using his hands to touch the fruit, hold the vines and even grab some ground under them. Ryan knew that his friend loved all this kind of things, so he didn&#39;t bother him. Instead, he took an apple and gave it a big bite.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Patrick had felt something weird under the watermelon&#39;s ground, something hard. He thought it could be some device that let the plants to grow up, so he started to remove the ground. While he was digging, Ryan had finished his apple and had started to eat a pear. When Patrick finished, he saw a unusual thing similar to a nose, it was soft as a nose too and had two holes like nostrils. He squeezed it and a sudden pain reaction came from the ground, it was like if an alive person was lying down there. Patrick jumped in fright and kept a few steps of distance.<br />
<br />
Amazingly, the nose place started to shake and produce some noises, similar to human groans. Patrick was expecting to look a zombie, and how they were popular in nowadays, he wasn&#39;t scared about but excited. When the ground stopped shaking, Patrick slowly moved forward until he was able to see what was lying there.<br />
<br />
A face, a human face, was shaking like if it was awakening, but it wasn&#39;t the one of a zombie. A young man, maybe around twenty years old was moving his face like if he had slept for years. He looked very normal besides of being buried and when he saw Patrick he just smiled. The kid bent to see who was there.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi, I&#39;m Wyatt. Who are you?&quot; The strange man said to Patrick, but the kid wasn&#39;t able to speak because of the surprise. Wyatt kept talking of how amazing was to awake and how fresh was the ground that day. Meanwhile, he was moving like if he was emerging from the ground. When he finally surfaced, Patrick was able to see the man who was in front of him.<br />
<br />
Two times his height and with a lot of muscles, Wyatt was like a superhero from the movies or a wrestler from the tv. He had an amazing look but he was definetely naked. Patrick tried to apart his sight, but at the moment he noted that Wyatt didn&#39;t have genitals.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I bet you&#39;re wondering why I don&#39;t have balls or a dick. Well, I could tell you but I think it&#39;s better that I show you instead.&quot; Wyatt said as he walked to a banana tree. Patrick saw how Wyatt&#39;s ass was big and green like a watermelon. &quot;Oh, my ass was a... seed... if you want to call it in that way, for those babies that you had seen in the ground. It&#39;s a little bit complicated to explain, so I ask you to wait until I show you the process.&quot; Wyatt took a banana and peeled it. &quot;By the way, who are you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My name is Patrick, I live next door...&quot; He said while he pointed to the bottom wall. &quot;Me and my friend Ryan crossed the wall to take some fruit and...&quot; But Patrick stopped talking when he wondered that he hadn&#39;t seen his friend since a while.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, where he is?&quot; Wyatt asked but Patrick made a gesture indicating that he didn&#39;t know. &quot;Ok... and have you eat any fruit yet?&quot; Wyatt said grinning.</p>
