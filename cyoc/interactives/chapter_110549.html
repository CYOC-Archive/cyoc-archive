<br />
Tom Herald left Alice Stevens place and headed home, with mixed feelings.<br />
On one hand, he enjoyed having a lively debate with someone, especially someone who could hold their own in the discussion.<br />
Yet on the other, he wasn&#39;t quite happy with himself for mentioning childhood dreams.<br />
<i>WHY did I bring up that old fantasy about that cartoon version of Maid Marian, let alone mention that I have a DVD copy of that movie?</i> he asked himself. <i>Then again, Alice still appears to have some cherished childhood dreams of her own if she thinks such creatures do exist, so I guess it all balances out since we&#39;re only human,</i> he figured, not knowing that Alice Stevens was actually a werevixen from Moon Lake!<br />
When he got back to his place, for some reason he could not quite explain if asked, Tom went over to the shelf of his bookcase where he kept his DVDs. Although the collection was in no particular order, he pulled out the stack in the corner and paused to pull out one hidden behind the rest.<br />
He stopped and stared at the cover to the Walt Disney version of <i>Robin Hood</i>, featuring an all anthropomorphic cast of animated animal characters in the classic cartoon traditions.<br />
<i>Just what was it about you that attracted me as a kid?</i> Tom asked himself, while staring at the image of a vixen dressed in medieval pink. <i>And why do I still treasure this movie?</i> he wondered, before hiding the DVD behind the others again.<br />
Tom could not help noticing once more the echo chamber like reactions every little noise he made had in the small, relatively empty apartment he called home.<br />
It was late, and Tom had to get up early in the morning to cover the Seattle Seahawks scrimmage as part of his promise to his editor to cover the big football game scheduled for that weekend.*<br />
Plus, he still wanted to try to figure out who killed Lionel Ulysses, if he could.<br />
AND he still had to find a Halloween costume if he was to keep his date with Alice that Saturday night.**<br />
<i>Maybe I&#39;ll go as Robin Hood, but she&#39;ll have to settle for the Errol Flynn version,</i> realized Tom, as he got ready for bed.<br />
<br />
Considering how late it was to begin with, Tom was happy to finally find a costume in time as he drove over to pick up Alice for their date.<br />
The crotch was a little tight, while the tunic and matching hat were actually for a much larger man, but Tom managed to find a Robin Hood costume.<br />
When he knocked on her door, he had a fake British accent and a line all prepared to say, but totally lost it when Alice Stevens opened her door.<br />
Somehow, she had not only managed to find a Maid Marian costume just like the one worn by the character throughout most of the movie, but beyond all expectations she actually looked like the foxy lady from Disney&#39;s version of the film.<br />
Despite being a star reporter, Tom Herald was totally speechless and just stared at her.<br />
Those eyes, the mutli-colored fur, that cute black nose and the smile on her muzzle, the big fluffy tail sticking out from behind...<br />
&quot;Tom?&quot; asked Alice, noticing the dumbfounded look on his face.<br />
Without another word Tom closed the door behind him and passionately began to kiss her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh... Tom,&quot; moaned Alice, knowing how long it had been since she was last with anyone, considering what would happen to a normal human being if she...<br />
&quot;Alice,&quot; said Tom, finally finding his voice between kisses. &quot;I... I want you. I <i>need</i> you.&quot;<br />
Alice moaned again, as his hands began to roam across her body. &quot;If we do this, there&#39;s no turning back.&quot;<br />
Tom figured she was just referring to taking their budding relationship to the next level, which was okay with him as he gently removed the pink outfit off her shoulders and began to kiss his way down her furry neck.<br />
&quot;Oh, Alice. I can tell you want me as much as I want you,&quot; said Tom, feeling her hardened nipples underneath the bodice of her medieval attire. &quot;Please...&quot;<br />
&quot;It&#39;s a lifetime commitment,&quot; she warned him, despite wanting Tom as much as he wanted her.<br />
Tom&#39;s only response was to kiss her again, directly on her muzzle as they hastily began removing each other&#39;s clothing.<br />
<br />
The excited and anxious couple never made it to her bedroom.<br />
Among all the strewn pieces of costumes, Tom took Alice right there on the living room floor, her furry body rubbing against the carpeting as he entered her wet cunt and began thrusting.<br />
While she was now completely stripped of the pink Maid Marian costume, Tom never gave a second thought to the fact that Alice still looked like a female fox as he continued to plunge his penis rapidly in and out of her.<br />
As he held on to her furry hips, watching her bountiful bosom move in time with their bodies&#39; rhythms, all that mattered to Tom was &quot;claiming&quot; Alice as any man would a woman at a moment like this.<br />
Feeling the burning heat between them rise, it wasn&#39;t long before Tom and Alice climaxed together, each shuddering in unison as his seed flooded her cunt while her fluids christened his cock.<br />
Spent, Tom collapsed on top of his lover, holding her close as he resumed kissing Alice, but now more gently than before.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh Tom,&quot; began Alice, rubbing the black nose of her muzzle against his human one. &quot;We will have a wonderful life together my love!&quot; she promised, already seeing the first changes start.<br />
&quot;Alice, I—&quot; but whatever Tom was going to say was destined to be unspoken as he felt a heat flash spread across his whole body as his skin began to itch.<br />
Tom looked down and saw orange and brown hairs begin to grow on each arm, even as his hands began to stretch and the fingers altered their shape.<br />
It was now Tom&#39;s turn to moan as the hairs, no—fur began to spread across his entire body as his feet started to change.<br />
Soon Tom felt a mixture of both pleasure and pain as the stub of a tail began to grow outward from his rear even as his ears started to climb closer to the top of his head and grow longer, forming points before gaining their own fur coating.<br />
&quot;The first transformation is always the hardest, but all the rest will be much more pleasurable,&quot; promised Alice, even as she felt his now much longer fox penis penetrate her deeper than his old human cock ever could.<br />
&quot;I—&quot; Tom started to say, but stopped as his nose extended and his jaws shifted to form his muzzle for the very first time.<br />
Moments later, a new (were)fox was born.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tom?&quot; said Alice, staring at him, while he stared at his new paws and what he could see of his new fursona.<br />
&quot;Tom?&quot; she said again, when no answer was forthcoming.<br />
Then he looked down at her.<br />
&quot;Alice Stevens, I feel... I feel something very special towards you,&quot; admitted Tom.<br />
&quot;That is the life/soul mate bond forming between us.&quot; <i>There is much I need to explain to you darling, but not now at this most crucial moment.</i><br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; agreed Tom, shaking his vulpine head. &quot;Alice Stevens, I love you. Now and forever. Will you marry me? Be my vixen and help raise our kits?&quot; he asked.<br />
&quot;Yes my love!&quot;<br />
Soon they were having sex again, but this time with a more vital goal.<br />
The top knot of the new fox&#39;s penis sank deep into his vixen as both yipped in pleasure, looking very forward to all the years of happiness and love that awaited them.<br />
<br />
Then Tom Herald awoke in the darkness of his Seattle apartment.<br />
Alone, lonely, and wondering just what the hell that weird dream was all about.<br />
