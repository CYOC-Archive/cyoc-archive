<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After being carried inside, Jess first noticed just how spotless and spacious their home was. The interior was a large &quot;open concept&quot; style living space. About 1/2 of the area was walled off, making the bathroom, kitchen, and a few other rooms seperate. Above them was a loft where instead of a wall, a railing was set up. The cathedral style ceiling made the whole place seem even larger. Not to mention the large fireplace and floor to ceiling windows. It was abundantly clear that they didn&#39;t mind being seen by the public, or did they perhapse get off to the thought of possibly being watched? <br />
<br />
While taking her up to their loft, she found that on either side, was a walled off room. One was a full bathroom, with a large jacuzzi bathtub, and the other was a walk in closet, which Jess was finally set down inside of. <br />
<br />
Ashley wasted no time and began finding a set of clothes for Jess to wear. Sizing up various mini dresses, pencil skirts, etc. Finally, she settled on one of the most obscene articles of clothing that Jess had ever seen. <br />
<br />
The custom made top fit her body like a glove. The skin tight black material hugged her every curve, accentuating her hips, and showing off her legs and possibly pussy, since the hemline didn&#39;t even reach that far down. If Jess bent over, her ass would be completely exposed. If she leaned back, then her pussy. She would have to keep her posture perfectly straight in order to hide both of them. Her shoulders were left completely exposed by the halter neckline style of the top. The sleeves actually were more like gloves too.<br />
<br />
The midsection was actually a corset too, which Selina tightened around her waist. Her waist narrowed slightly, already being fairly thin to begin with in the first place. However the added corset really helped define the arch of her back.<br />
<br />
However the real main focus was on the breast section, or lack thereof. Where normally, the tight top would either create cleavage or cover her boobs entirely, instead, 2 holes had instead been cut out, which just barely fit around Jess&#39; large tits. The corset created a platform underneath them too, helping to keep them together and also pointing forward. <br />
<br />
Her arms, which had been slipped into the top&#39;s sleeves, had been pulled together and bent behind her back, with each hand cupping the opposite arm&#39;s elbow. The sleeves didn&#39;t end in openings either. Instead, they formed into black gloves which even though they had all of the fingers, they were all stuck together, forcing the fingers to curl slightly. <br />
<br />
Ashley began lacing up the sleeves, which bound them together, as Selina did the same to the heels. She had fished out a pair of ballet boots for Jess to wear, colored black to match the top.<br />
<br />
Jess was thankful that she no longer was required to breathe, having quickly made the change the moment Selina tightened the corset. While she was at it, she made sure that she had removed her need to eat, drink, as well as relieve herself since doing any of them in this corset would be a struggle she didn&#39;t want to deal with.<br />
<br />
Lastly the both of them helped her into a very tight, transparent pencil skirt, which restricted her maximum stride greatly. At best, Jess could take steps of maybe 1-2 feet at maximum. Seeing that, the lesbian couple began inspecting every inch, making sure all of the bindings were secured. <br />
<br />
After they were satisfied, they pulled out a suprisingly normal looking, white long skirt. This may be the most normal thing they put on you this entire time. This fit well enough, and fully hid the underlying hobble skirt, save for a long slit on the right side. If Jess remained still, then the slit would disappear. But any tims she walked, the slit eould show off the transparent material of the hobble skirt, and if she wasn&#39;t careful, then possibly her pussy too if viewed from the right angle.<br />
<br />
Finally they were done, or so you thought. But you realized there was a lot more to go to this, when each girl pulled out a different colored 10 foot leash. Ashley&#39;s was maroon and Selina&#39;s was light blue. They both placed their hand loop around your nipple dicks and pulled each of your balls through their respective loop. Finally tightening up the loop enough that until someone undid the knot, you would be unable to remove them. <br />
<br />
Both of them quickly shed their clothing. If you had to juddge them, then Ashley would win for best ass, while Selina would win for best boobs. Ashley&#39;s B, maybe C cups at best were no match for Selina&#39;s natural D&#39;s. However her years of gymnastics had given her an amazing ass. You could watch it shake and jiggle all day. It was hypnotic. Especially with how her brown hair fell just inbetween and slightly above her cheeks whenever she put it into a ponytail, like she did today.<br />
<br />
Selina wouldn&#39;t lose out either in terms of beauty though. Having very long blonde hair patnered with her slightly shorter height and large boobs was a dangerous combination. Add that with her naturally seductive nature, and it made perfect sense why every year for Halloween she went as a succubus. However, what captured Jess&#39; attention was her tattoo. A pair of feathered wings had been tattooed above her ass, appearing as if the came out from her hips. Jess had seen her in a bikini before, and she had never had this tattoo. She even was openly against them. Apparently, the new reality had changed her opinion about them though. Not that Jess minded. She felt that it was sexy as hell.<br />
<br />
Even though Ashley was just as kinky, her brazen and &quot;straight to the point&quot; manner of speaking completely failed at setting the mood. She didn&#39;t have any tattoos either, being forbidden by her gymnastics group.<br />
<br />
Something that they did share though, was a matching clitoris ring piercing, as well as matching nipple ring piercings which they had just put on. Ashley opened a drawer and picked out a collar for both of them. Next, they slipped thsir respective leashes through their clit ring and clipped it to their collar while both dropped down onto their hands and knees. <br />
<br />
Lastly, Selina pulled out tail plugs from the same drawer and handed the brown haired one to Ashley, while lubing up and sliding the blonde haired one into herself. Ashley didn&#39;t plug herself though. She instead licked the plug all over and crawled over to Jess with it in her mouth. With Jess&#39; arms bound, she didn&#39;t know how she could help Ashley, but her concern was unnecessary, as Ashley put the tip into her ass, and backed herself into Jess&#39; right leg, pushing the rest in with a moan.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ughhh! OK Jess, now take us for a walk around the area&quot; Ashley instructed excitedly.<br />
<br />
&quot;You couldn&#39;t have said that even just a bit sexier Ash? Maybe like, your loyal bitches are ready for their walk Mistress. Could you please walk us to the park if we are good girls perhaps? ... Or something like that at least.&quot; Selina complained. She was right that her way was way sexier than Ashley&#39;s, but Jess didn&#39;t mind. Either way, she would be walking the both of them shortly as she hobbled over to the door, only to need one of her new &quot;bitches&quot; to open it for her since she couldn&#39;t grasp the handle.<br />
<br />
The moment it opened, both &quot;bitches&quot; took off on all fours into the yard, pulling Jess along by her nipple dicks as she struggled to keep her balance. Immediately after Jess regained her balance, Ashley and Selina squatted down and began peeing, while sticking a leg up and out to the side. Both girls were barking to each other, having banned human speech completely until the finished their walk. Jess would just follow behind them, letting them lead her around town.</p>
