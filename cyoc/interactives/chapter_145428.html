<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff stared at his screen and considered his options. He had read stories online of people using the Chronivac, changing their appearance, changing into other people, even some of people changing into animals. But changing into a non-living entity, an inanimate object, just seemed impossible. Change cells into cells is one thing, but cells into wood, or metal, or fabric; not a chance. Still though, the idea intrigued him. He decided that he wanted to become a piece of clothing, if it would work at all. He browsed this list of potential transformations, when one caught his eye.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fur hood coat?&quot; He said out loud. &quot;Well winter is just around the corner, and I don&#39;t have a set of clothes.&quot; He chuckled to himself. His curiosity overcame his skepticism and he clicked on the option. His screen filled up with all sorts of information. What color he wanted the coat to be, size, fur color the list was extremely detailed and initially to complicated for him to figure out. &quot;I think I&#39;ll just go with a teenagers with a white coloring and brown fur. He paused &quot;That&#39;s only if this works.&quot; He decided to modify the transformation time length, and the time transformed length. &quot;I think 10 minutes should be good for transforming, and I&#39;ll stay transformed for....3 hours. Don&#39;t want to be a fur hood coat for too long.&quot; He couldn&#39;t believe he just said that. &quot;Anyways, let&#39;s see what this baby can handle.&quot; He pressed the transform button.<br />
<br />
Jeff waited intently. It took a few seconds for the transformation to take effect. &quot;Welp, I knew this thing was full of sh-&quot; he said as he attempted to stand up, only to find that both of his feet had disconnected entirely from his body. &quot;Oh my god!&quot; Jeff exclaimed laying on the ground. He maneuvered himself over to pick up his detached feet. He picked up one of his feet and was completely caught off guard by the fact that he could both feel the foot in his hand, yet still feel as if it was attached to him. He event tried wiggling his toes and too his astonishment the toes responded accordingly.<br />
<br />
The movement did not last for long though, as he noticed a slow wave of brown begin to fill his feet starting at the toes, moving up to his ankle. The brown was forcing the toes to take on a new shape, as if they where all melting together into one appendage. The top of his feet began opening up and molding to the sides. Jeff realized that his feet where becoming a pair of boots. The brown continued up the base of his feet, altering the shape and material, turning it from flesh to leather, and Jeff could feel it all. Every minute change brought pleasure to his body. His feet which had just opened up started to get fuzzy on the inside slowly turning into a fur like material and he realized his feet had turned into a pair of uggs. <br />
<br />
Jeff went down to pick up his former feet when he noticed his freshly amputated legs began changing. &quot;Well I might want to get somewhere a little more comfortable&quot;, he said as he crawled his way on top of his bed. He began to take off his clothes until he was butt naked. &quot;Don&#39;t want those to get in the way of the show.&quot; He said as he tossed them aside. The base of the nubs of Jeff&#39;s legs had begun to open up, similarly to how his feet opened. Only this time instead of the edges of the opening turning into a hard material like the shoes, they began to take form of a smooth, white fabric. The fabric crawled up his leg at a faster rate than the shoes, but still not enough to alarm him, he did only set the transformation time for 10 minutes after all. The cavity within his legs-turned-coat continued to grow up his calf. Jeff basked in the feeling, he reached an hand down to touch his appendage, finding the material to be slightly heavy and smooth. The bottoms of his former legs, now two separate holes of a long coat began to merge together. <br />
<br />
About when the fabric got up to his knees, Jeff&#39;s dick began to get hard. At first he couldn&#39;t explain why, but thinking about his body&#39;s transformation made it even harder. He started thinking about a hot girl wearing him outside, how it would feel to be completely wrapped up in a person, head to waist. After he started getting aroused he noticed a change occur in his groin. His cock and testicles outright popped off of his body, similar to how his feet fell off. His nuts seemed to deflate down to just the testes. They soon began to undergo a change as well, the material turned from flesh to metal and gemstone, Jeff soon discovered that his family jewels had actually become literal jewels, taking the form of a pair of small diamond studs. His dick in the meantime appeared to have flattened out about 8 inches wide and shortened to about 4 inches long. His urethra began to expand along the width of his flattened penis while two smaller holes seemed to be forming on the opposite side, Jeff quickly realized that his member was being converted to pair of women&#39;s panties. He would have had a raging hard on, had it not been for the recent loss of his junk. Soon enough, the penis had been fully converted to a pair of frilly white underwear with a small bow on the front. Jeff&#39;s senses where overloaded, having his most sensitive part of the body be converted to a pair of soft and light undergarments gave him some heavy thoughts. <br />
<br />
By now the coat had made it&#39;s way all the way up to his waist. It appeared that Jeff was just wearing a women&#39;s coat so long as you ignored to obvious blend between flesh and fabric at the edge of his belly and hips, and the fact that Jeff did not have any legs under the coat. He bent forward to move the newly formed earrings and panties off of what was formerly his thighs, so as to watch the transformation continue without any obstructions. Accidentally brushing his &quot;skin&quot; sent a wave of pleasure to his head. Jeff had never felt such surreal feelings before. He did not feel like he was touching a smooth fabric, but that he was a smooth fabric and things where touching him. He was very pleased with how the transformation progressed, when suddenly he noticed his hand.<br />
<br />
His hands then too began changing material. His once tan hands had begun to take on brown coloration. The fabric that his hands where becoming was far more softer than the coat’s fabric, but not as smooth, he believed it was yarn. His hands seemed to be deflating right in front of him, they looked like a pair of  gloves at this point and they disconnected from his arms.<br />
<br />
By the time Jeff looked back at his torso his belly button and bellow had all been converted to coat. He prodded the edge of his stomach and other internal organs only to discover that they too, unsurprisingly, had also been converted to smooth fabric. Jeff got concerned as to what would happen when it reached vital organs. &quot;This machine better not suffocate me. No they wouldn&#39;t have this as an option if it suffocated you, that&#39;s just ridiculous.&quot; He said to try to comfort himself, yet some stress still remained.<br />
<br />
The fabric on both his torso and arms kept crawling their way upward, hollowing him out in the process. Slowly but surely he could feel his insides unravel into sheets of the smooth fabric. By the time it reached his heart and lungs, Jeff braced for the worst. He soon discovered that nothing happened. He was still alive just not breathing. He physically could not breath. The changes to the torso stopped right on Jeff&#39;s pectorals muscles.  Though he couldn&#39;t see it directly, he could tell that padding was forming all over his body. The changes on his arms also appeared to have stopped. The sleeves starting just where armpits began, going all the way down to where his former hands were. The gloves had disconnected from the sleeves of the coat.<br />
<br />
By now Jeff was just a pair of shoulders, a neck, and a head. He had no idea how the rest of the transformation would continue, It seemed like it was already done, but he clearly wasn&#39;t fully changed. Almost immediately there-after, Jeff&#39;s shoulders began deflating into themselves until their was nothing left. He thought the same would happen to his head as well, but something far stranger happened. Though Jeff could not directly see it he could tell exactly what was happening. His lips then began to convert into a similar fabric as the rest of the coat. The fabric spread outward onto his face as his tongue, teeth, and throat too turned into the smooth fabric. Jeff lost vision as the fabric enveloped his eyes along with the rest of his head, but leaving his hair. He seemed to have immediately regained it, but it was different. It was as if Jeff could see in every direction from every stitching of his fur hood coat body. He could now actually see the final changes occurring. His former mouth opened up along with the rest of his face to form a hood while his hair thickened and softened up moving to cover the rim of the hood. Then his body split in two as a zipper ran its way up his body. <br />
<br />
The transformation was complete. Jeff felt complete. All he could do was sit and wait for the time to be over. Sit and feel his new body. Though almost immediately Jeff felt as if he was transported to a new location. In less than a split second he was no longer on his bed, he was now somewhere dark. At first he thought he lost his vision once again, but that was not the case. The more Jeff concentrated the more he could tell he was just in a dark room of some sorts. Jeff felt a sort of weight holding him down, and that all the weight was being held by his once known shoulders. Jeff could tell he must be on a hanger in someone&#39;s closet. But who&#39;s closet?<br />
<br />
Just then a wave of light filled in the closet, as a hand reached in to grab the hanger Jeff was on. &quot;Today I’m going to wear my new coat!&quot; she said to someone on the phone. &quot;Alright see you then!&quot; She hung up the phone.<br />
<br />
Jeff had become a fur hood coat a pair of yarn gloves and a pair of ugg boots.</p>
