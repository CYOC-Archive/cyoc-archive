<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Lian decided to take a straight walk to the east hall. As he did he saw several of the mutants he had changed and some humans. while he could make all the humans in the food court monsters as he did earlier he decided not to. he had already done so when he got here and didn&#39;t feel like repeating himself, at least not today. he couldn&#39;t help but eye the ten-foot tiger woman he had made as she and her boyfriend were ordering from one of the restaurant stalls.  <br />
<br />
As a result, he didn&#39;t see the caution sign as he pulled out his remote. he soon found himself slipping on the wet floor and fumbling with the remote. he caught it only to slip again causing his hand to brush against the remote seemingly never-ending buttons. Eventually, Lian used his hat&#39;s powers to turn his pads into suction cups like an octopus. this stopped the slipping. he left round marks with a pop as he stepped out of the slick area. <br />
<br />
a loud bellow made him turn around and let out a brief gasp. he wasn&#39;t sure if the janitor who was mopping was a woman before but that wasn&#39;t important. what was is the fact that her arms were covered in tan scales and ended in triceratops&#39; heads. both of which were the same size if not bigger than the woman&#39;s human head. her shoulders also had tan scales with bumps covering them. the woman seemed to sigh as she switched her mutant hands. &#39;wait! I fumbled twice,&#39; Lian realized and looked around for any mutant that was nearby. he then saw the mutant that didn&#39;t match his artistic style. <br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Leah sighed as she waited for her friend. Haley was supposed to be here five minutes ago. She was about to give up and go home when she froze. his clothes vanished as her body changed. her breast receded as flesh grew between her pelvis and abdomen.  brown fur spread across her lean and muscular torso and spread down her arms.  <br />
<br />
the fur stopped around her neck making it look like he had a furry shirt on. As his face pushed into a slight muzzle two large bumps appeared where her legs used to be. the originals were now well behind her. her face now looked like a mix between a teen boy and a goat. her new ears and horns only emphasized that look. her once long red hair was now short unkempt hair. blond hair now covered her lower body as the two left legs became feline paws.  <br />
<br />
the front right leg however gained brown feathers and yellow scales as the digits became talons. her right back leg gained jet-black fur as all the toes reformed into a hoof. between her legs, her pussy reformed into a sheath along with an empty sack. the latter soon filled with fourteen different testicles of varying sizes. his cock realizes itself from its home and now pokes its head from between Leah&#39;s front legs.  <br />
<br />
it looked like a mix of feline, horse, goat, and dog. two bumps appeared on his tailbone. both grew into two tails. one covered in brown fur and the other in green scales. in the end, different things topped their tips. the first one had thicker black fur while the second one ended with a snake&#39;s head.   <br />
<br />
Finally, two wings grew from his lower body. the right one matched his front right leg and had the markings of a bald eagle. the other looked similar to a bat but covered in green scales. lea felt himself cumming again. the janitor bellowed with her unoccupied triceratops hand as she moved the bucket and mop to the cum.  <br />
<br />
Lea sighed as he hoped he&#39;d find something at enchanted looks to help with his condition. he&#39;d never get a job if he didn&#39;t find something to help his libido. he then heard the voice of an angel. &quot;hey there you beast&quot; Haley said. the two of them locked lips as they hugged. he was so lucky to find someone like Haley.  &quot;ready to go?&quot; she said. the two passed by a tanuki with a conflicted expression as they did.  <br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Lian had let them pass. he didn&#39;t know how he&#39;d be able to fix that change. he did works of art. that were like someone threw a paint bucket on top of a staircase and called it a sculpture. instead, he aimed at the woman with the triceratops hands and hit Enhance over and over until he was satisfied.  <br />
<br />
her body got bulkier as he had changed. horns grew from the tan scales of her head. her face kept changing until it was identical to those that made up her hands. her shirt faded away as her breasts became triceratops&#39; heads. her shoes and socks did the same as her feet changed into triceratops heads too. horns pierced through her pants as her butt cheeks began breathing.  <br />
<br />
It was clear she now had a total of seven triceratops heads. her original was the largest as the rest of her body wasn&#39;t heads looked like an anthro triceratops. figuring that was enough Lian walked into the service store. he had brought his phone here so he wondered if it was gonna change after these people became like him. he then aimed at the three people and fired. this time they had become his art, not some catastrophic mess.  <br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
&quot;here you go the brand new...&quot; Mike was handing the phone to one of the two girls in front of him when all three froze. dark blue scales began to cover his hands as his nails became manicured and sharp. these changes spread up his arms. his bare chest then surged outwards as light blue scales covered them. they grew to such a size that any woman who would have them would have back issues.  <br />
<br />
his back seemed to strengthen to make up for this. his ears began growing until they were as large as his head and neck. they then connected to them while leaving the ear holes where they were.  on top of his head between his hood his hair gained a blue tint. his eyes became slit as they glowed with a light blue light.  <br />
<br />
most of his teeth vanished except for his upper canines and those in between. the canines became long fangs as the remaining teeth became smaller versions. his face pushed into a slight snout as his tongue shifted. it didn&#39;t become forked like one would expect. instead, it thinned considerably as it grew long enough to touch the edges of his breasts.  <br />
<br />
the inside of his mouth became as light blue as the scales on his jaw and down the front of his neck. his legs bulked up as his feet became malformed with pointed toes. his cock and scrotum inverted into her her vagina. a long tail grew above her large ass. while dark blue it wasn&#39;t covered in scales. instead, it was comprised of tar-like goo. &quot;...mutant cellphone or Mutcell for short&quot; Medusa said as she handed the goat boy his new phone. <br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
 Gina watched as her sister reached out to grasp the phone when they all stopped. while summer&#39;s changes were beginning with black fur Gina&#39;s attention was demanded more by a certain tanuki. Several glowing red triangle eyes with even brighter yellow pupils appeared on her butt. her skin became green with camouflage-like styles on it. a small tail grew, its appearance looks similar to a lizard or a plant. this made it hard to deduce if she was becoming a plant mutant or a lizard mutant.  <br />
<br />
down her legs, the green grew lighter as her feet took on a deer-like appearance. long rounded bumps grew on the sides of them like wings. it was unclear if this was their actual purpose. between his legs, two testicles fell into their green sack as a cock grew above them. it too looked like a vine and was even prehensile. three markings appeared on it with a similar appearance to his eyes.  <br />
<br />
Interestingly his torso didn&#39;t change too much other than thinning and gained a green tint. His nipples and belly button vanished as his hair became even longer and more wild. two dark protrusions grew from his face. at first glance, they looked like his hair just darker. on closer examination, they seemed to be like a insects mandible. Glenn&#39;s face was now permanently in a shadow even with his three glowing red eyes running down his face.  <br />
<br />
after his goat brother got his new cell the two began to leave. their clothes now the male versions of themselves. &quot;so where do you want to go&quot; the black-furred goat said. Glenn looked at Sam with an unreadable expression. &quot;food&quot; he said. Sam simply smiled at his brother as this was the most talkative he could get him. &quot;all right the food court it is.&quot; Sam said. <br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
as the two passed Lian felt his cock tent his pants like crazy. the green mutant&#39;s new eyes seemed to squint from the holes in his pants like they were happy with Lian&#39;s uncertainty. Ignoring this he left the service store and tried to find a way to distract himself from his lustful thoughts. he briefly looked up to see the new name. it went from being a well-known phone company to &#39;serpent calls&#39;. Lian noticed how this seemed to be a recurring event.  <br />
<br />
with a few exceptions each person he changed seemed to alter reality as well. being an artist he was this made him feel even hornier just thinking about it. he then decided to...</p>
