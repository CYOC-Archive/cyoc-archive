<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">David’s toe rubbed a hole in the end of the size 25 sneakers the first Friday in the 14th month. Coming home that evening, Jason saw the Yoshida’s bag and the size 26 Nike box in the recycling bin.  Jason’s dick stirred. <br />
<br />
After setting down his bag, Jason walked to their bedroom to find his naked fiancé sprawled across the huge bed stroking his inflating cock. David had positioned himself so that his enormous feet were at the edge of the bed, ready for worshiping. <br />
<br />
“Hey little man. Did you see the box by the backdoor?”  David asked. <br />
<br />
“Yes sir,” Jason replied stripping his clothes off slowly down to his jockstrap and gingerly touching David’s feet. “Giant feet like these deserved to be worshipped.  Sir, may I?”<br />
<br />
“Do you think you can, little man? They are awfully big compared to you.” David said while placing his foot on Jason’s torso, almost filling the length between his waist and shoulders. <br />
<br />
“I’ll do my best,” Jason replied as he began to lick the toes of the giant’s foot. Kneeling down, Jason stared at the meaty soles before him. With lust and resolve, he began kissing and licking as David slowly jacked off. Looking down on Jason working on his big feet, David realized how small Jason looked compared to him and that sent David over the edge. He came with such force, one massive glob of cum hit the wall above the bed. Jason stood up and shot his own load on David’s toes and then licked them clean. <br />
<br />
Jason had filled out nicely. At 6’2” and 220 lbs, he was muscular by old reality standards and was very muscular compared to non-Asians in this  new reality. His flexibility was  extraordinary. David loved how Jason could contort his body and accommodate his giant cock.  Jason loved the way David would eat his ass when he spread his strong legs into a wide split. <br />
<br />
Steven’s natural growth spurt came to an end. He now stood 7’2” and weighed 350 lbs with the muscle he added. But his favorite stat was 18.5 inches. Mark was taller and more muscular and Steven like that. However, his giant (mostly) bottom of a boyfriend’s meat wasn’t quite as long as his and Steven really liked that. <br />
<br />
David, Jason, Mark and Steven had all become very close by the 14th month of David’s growth. Besides working out, David and Mark would golf together when they could find time. They both loved golf and went overboard in keeping it fun. The giants would look ridiculous (but also hot) in their obnoxiously loud and tight golf pants and polos. <br />
<br />
Jason and Steven enjoyed Jazz and attended as many live shows as they could. Occasionally, they would drag Mark and David along, but eventually grew tired of their boyfriends’ chatter during the sets and quit asking them. They also enjoyed fishing and would often be at the lake while Mark and David golfed. <br />
<br />
The four usually met at the gym Saturday mornings and would enjoy a long lunch afterwards. <br />
<br />
Pushed to his limits at the gym by David, Mark was making steady progress. Through his efforts and diet, Mark was able to add another 10 pounds by the end of the 14th month. Still standing 7’3”, he now weighed just over a staggering 420 pounds. <br />
<br />
David continued to grow per the edits in the book. He was amazed at how he continued to get stronger unabated. He was racking way more weight than Mark at this point. Looking at the incredible weights he was lifting would sometimes cause his dick to stir. <br />
<br />
At the end of the fourteenth month, David stood 7’4” inches, was hung with a 19 inch penis that draped heavily over softball sized testicles, and  he weighed a breath-taking 454 pounds. He was now the biggest man in the gym in all respects.  On measurement day, both David and Jason were so turned on that they had sex for hours, both cumming multiple times. Exhausted, Jason laid on David, enjoying being completely enveloped by his fiancée’s huge arms. <br />
<br />
The guys couldn’t escape the rumors of John’s bad behavior. Mark and David never saw John, as he never worked out in the evening and he actively avoided Mark. John would even sneak out the back of their mother’s house if Mark came to visit. <br />
<br />
Jason was usually at the gym before John, but saw him there occasionally. A couple of times, John had tried to subtly intimidate Jason. Once by standing too close behind him at the water fountain.  Another time, he shadowed Jason’s workout and, not quietly, noted how much more weight he could push.  Of course, John was not dumb enough to lay a hand on David’s fiancé. <br />
<br />
Steven was often at the gym at the same time of the morning as John and had witnessed his cruelty.  He saw John threatened to slap a small white boy and he had seen him use his size to push around the other guys in the gym.  Since Steven had outgrown John, he had intervened when John was bullying a handsome black man that Steven knew from the cafe. After that, Steven suspected John hid is worst behavior from him. <br />
<br />
But still the rumors swirled and David convinced the other guys that John needed to be taught a lesson.  After he formulated a plan, he talked it over with Jason to get his approval. David then approached Mark and Steven with the plan. Mark was reluctant, but Steven reminded Mark of how cruel John had been to him and said “you were big enough to take of yourself, imagine how he treats the littles when no one is watching.” After that, Mark was on board. <br />
<br />
They planned to change their Saturday workout schedule, they knew John worked out and lounged in the locker room on Saturday afternoons. On the second Saturday afternoon the guys were there, Jason saw John head for the sauna in the locker room. He told David, Mark and Steven and they all headed to the locker room to carry out the plan. <br />
<br />
After putting their things in lockers, the guys headed for the showers first. Jason was used to feeling small next to David, but being next to 3 giant East Asian men was a new experience. Jason was eye level with their pecs, and while Steven wasn’t as big as Mark or David, he out weighed Jason by more than 100 pounds. All three had flaccid dicks that were bigger than Jason’s erection. As the soap suds flowed down their beautiful brown skin to their big Asian feet, Jason became a little self conscious about his small body and fair skin. David recognized the look on Jason’s face and whispered to him, “I love you and we can stop if you are uncomfortable.”  Jason kissed him and told him that they could move forward. <br />
<br />
David was the first one to walk in the sauna. He didn’t bother to wrap a towel around his 454 pound frame. John was against the wall at the far end of one the benches being serviced by 2 small twinks. He didn’t open his eyes until the wood creaked as David sat down bare assed on the bench next to him. Not wanting to seem intimidate, he closed his eyes as the twinks continued to worship his feet and calves, but both were looking at David.  Jason slipped in quietly and sat in the corner. Then Mark and Steven made their entrance, sitting next to each other on the other bench with their huge cocks laying over the edge. <br />
<br />
With everyone in place, David began. “Hey little men,” he said “wouldn’t you rather worship men with big feet? You should go over to my friends, now.”  Being used to compliance, the little men abandoned John and kneeled in front of Mark and Steven, worshipping their size 24 feet. <br />
<br />
John’s face soured and he made a move to get up, but David placed a big hand on his chest and pushed him back. “No little johnny, I think you want to stay for bit.” David said menacingly. Knowing he was overmatched by David alone and not sure what Mark and Steven might do, John settled back as David put his big arm around his shoulders. <br />
<br />
David put his size 26 foot next to John’s 23, “hey Mark, you never told me that John had such delicate feet. Look how cute they are.” <br />
<br />
“He has always had pretty little feet.” Mark replied.<br />
<br />
Leaving his leg and foot next to John’s for a bit, he allowed John to process how much smaller he was than David. David, being turned on by the size difference, started to get hard. John was 340lbs, but David had over a hundred pounds on him. <br />
<br />
“Hey baby,” David said turning to Jason, “do you remember when little Johnny asked if you wanted a real man?” <br />
<br />
“I do,”’ Jason replied. <br />
<br />
“Little Johnny, I need you to smell this,” David said raising his arm from around John’s shoulders and offering his hairy pit. John leaned in a little, but David pushed John’s face into his pit with his other hand, “you can do better, now that’s a good boy, take a deep breath “ David taunted, “now tell me, do I smell like a real man?”<br />
<br />
“Yes” John replied. <br />
<br />
“Yes, what?” David asked. <br />
<br />
“Yes sir.” To everyone’s surprise, John started to get hard. <br />
<br />
“Good boy” David smiled, “it’s nice in here, but I’m starting to sweat a bit,” he said as a line of sweat started to run from his pit down his rippled side.  “Now Johnny, you are going to need to lick it.”  Before John could protest, David said, “do it now.” When John licked David’s musky pit, David asked “do I taste like a real man?”<br />
<br />
“Yes sir.” John was fully erect. <br />
<br />
Grabbing John’s hand, David brought it to his raised arm, “try to squeeze. Try harder, I can’t feel anything.” David shaking his head, “feel my pecs now, hard aren’t they. I bet you wish you had big full muscles like that.”  He continued, “now my quads, they are probably bigger than your waist. You can’t imagine how powerful it feels to have huge legs like this. I know my muscles are hard, but are you even trying  squeeze them boy? Pathetic.”<br />
<br />
David, Jason, Mark and Steven were all fully hard. The twinks at Mark and Steven’s feet were whimpering and had already cum little drops on the sauna floor at David’s display of dominance. <br />
<br />
“Hey Mark,” David called, what was it your little little brother used to call you?”<br />
<br />
Steven piped in grabbing Mark’s huge cock, “baby dick” he said, “he called this prime cut of Asian beef, baby dick.”<br />
<br />
“Goodness,” David chastised, “but John, you are smaller.” Grabbing John’s prick David continued, “Mark is longer and way thicker. In fact all the Asian studs in here have much bigger cocks than your sad little prick. Here, put your hand on mine. See how nice that feels in your hand. So thick and hard. I bet you’d like that thick cock in your ass.”<br />
<br />
At that comment, John twisted away from David and ran from the room.   <br />
<br />
David smiled as Jason and Steven laughed, but Mark looked serious and said “give me a minute” as he followed John. <br />
<br />
“John wait,” Mark called. <br />
<br />
“What the fuck Mark?” John snapped. <br />
<br />
“You deserved everything you got in there, if not more.” Mark said, “you need to learn that being cruel hurts people. Mostly it hurts you.  You have to stop treating people so badly, especially the littles - they can’t help how small they are. John, please try a meditation group or something spiritual. Being kind is a much better way to live.”<br />
<br />
“You may have gotten huge Mark, but you’re still pathetic. Fuck you. Go back to your faggot boyfriend and leave me alone.”<br />
<br />
Mark closed the gap between them with surprising speed for a man his size and grabbed John’s face with his powerful hand. “You are my brother and I love you, but if that word ever comes out of your mouth again, I’ll break your jaw.” Mark said as he pushed John away and walked back to the sauna. <br />
<br />
John was not seen at the gym again after that Saturday. Mark heard that John was at one of the small chain gyms and that he kept to himself. Mark hoped that maybe John was reflecting on his bad choices. <br />
<br />
David’s incredible growth spurt had come to an end. While he was happy about being so huge, he missed growing.  <br />
<br />
Life for the guys fell into a happy routine. David and Jason had planned their wedding trip and asked Mark and Steven to be their best men. <br />
<br />
About 3 months after David’s growth spurt ended, Jason’s birthday was approaching. David had arranged a surprise party and was snooping through Jason’s things looking for old pictures to put on a slide show. He came across an old book in the back of Jason’s desk drawer. Intrigued, David opened the book and read “ask me anything you want to know, pick up a pen to make changes”. David blurted out sarcastically “oh okay, why does Jason hide such a weird book in his desk?”  The letters on the page swirled and the read “the book is hidden to hide the edits Jason made.”  David wondered and said, “show me the edits Jason made.” David read all that Jason had done. After reflecting for a while, David took out his pen and began writing in the margins.</p>
