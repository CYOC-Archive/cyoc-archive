<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mr. Valhilly was speachless. He just watched his worst female student suddenly turn into the most beautiful thing he had ever laid his eyes upon. Everything about her was more or less perfect. Maybe 1 or 2 things were not ydt ideal, but those didn&#39;t matter since the rest was simply flawless beauty. The way she was helpless without the use of her arms, how her boobs laid upon their platform made them look even bigger than they were, how because of the tight dress, every curve of her body was outlined, even how the noticable trickle of a clear fluid down her legs indicating her hornyness was devine to his eyes. And the icing on the cake was her subservient way she addressed him, coupled with the implied submissiveness she held towards him. <br />
<br />
Simply put, she was his dream girl. The girl he has been searching for his whole life. He instantly fell in love with her on the spot. &quot;Ms. Filly, I will gladly take a drink, and may I add that you look simply immaculate today without your arms.&quot; Garry blushed and proudly pushed her breasts forward, completely emphasizing their presence above the rest of her body. In her head, she was in pure euphoria. &quot;Master has just complemented me! I can&#39;t  believe it! I don&#39;t know if I can even contain my giddiness for much longer. And Master wants to drink from me! He actually wants my milk! I could even just die right now and have no regrets! This is the happiest moment of my life!&quot; Garry thought to herself, all while doing the best to not show her emotions on her face, which she was only bairly not managing to do. Her face already had turned completely red and she couldn&#39;t stop herself from smiling. <br />
<br />
It was then she suddenly felt an odd sensation, or better yet, she no longer felt  something she should still be feeling. She couldn&#39;t feel her arms at all. Slowly, she turned her head to give herself a look and was surprised when she no longer could see her arms outlined behind her. It was almost as if-! Suddenly Mr. Valhilly grabbed ahold of her left shoulder, putting his hand right where her arm should be, confirming that she now no longer had arms. Her shoulders simply ended and went straight into her sides, she didn&#39;t even have armpits anymore, just smooth skin.<br />
<br />
Garry knew that she should be going insain at the loss if her arms, however contrary to her expectations, she was feeling extremely happy with their absence. The thought that she no longer could do almost anything made her very, very happy. The idea that from now on, she would be completely dependent on her Master was making her pussy dripping wet with excitement. She could feel the warm liquid trailing down her thighs and calves, first forming a pool inside of her heels, and then finally overflowing them once the souls had filled up to their limit. <br />
<br />
Finaly her Master pinched her right nipple, preventing any milk from shooting out and brought his mouth right to it. His lips then quickly wrapped around her teat as he began suckling the milk out of her. It was like the flood gates had opened as a torrent of milk began to flow out of her right breast into his mouth. However he expertly was able to handle it and could swallow it just as fast as it entered his mouth. Most people wouldn&#39;t be able to handle her flow, but Master was different than most. He could easily handle her, and never once spilled even a single drop of her milk. <br />
<br />
Garry just watched in extacy as her Master continued to drain her breast of milk. Interestingly, she found that even though he only was using her right boob, her left was matching her right&#39;s shrinking size. It was as if their milk storages were shared between them, and that sucking out her milk would drain it from both boobs equally, reguardless of which nipple was being used. She was quite thankful for this as it kept her balance centered.<br />
<br />
Mr. Valhilly continued to suck for several minutes, and finaly stopped when she only had a pair of H cups remaining. Of course this was not an issue though, since all of her drained milk would be fully replenished within the hour. &quot;Ms. Filly, I wish to express my desire to dominate your entire existence. I want you. No, its more like, I want your tits. They are the most elegant, beautiful, boobs that I could ever imagine. And as such.&quot; Mr. Valhilly dropped down on one knee &quot;Ms. Filly and Ms. Filly&#39;s tits, would you both marry me?&quot;  <br />
<br />
Garry found it odd that her tits were co sidered a selerate entity from her, but likely that was just master&#39;s kink. However the idea of becomming Master&#39;s bride was too much for her to handle. &quot;Yes, I will become Master&#39;s bride!&quot; She managed to say before her breasts began shooting out 2 solid, unemding streams of milk. She had to have looked like a fountain as the unending flow was quickly forming a large puddle underneath the both of them. <br />
<br />
Garry watched as her Master and now fiancee stood back up and took out a ring box. She was a bit confused as to what a ring would do for her, seeing as how she didn&#39;t have a finger to put it on. However when he opened it for her, she found that unlike normal engagement rings, this ring had a different style band than the normal rings for fingers. The back side had a small split it it. Her Master then pulled out a special device that looked like a thin pair of scissors, and stuck it inside her nose. Garry didn&#39;t struggle and simply let her Master do whatever he was wanting to do with her nose, while closing her eyes. Suddenly a sharp pain erupted from her nose, as a metallic rod felt like it had just been pushed through her septum. Now all the dots had connected. She was given an engagement nose ring, which would now be dangling forever from her septum, with the gemstone resting right above her upper lip. Her eyes were overflowing with tears from the pain, however she chose to think of them as tears of happiness.<br />
<br />
When he was finished, Mr. Valhilly stepped back and admired his work. And then felt for the first time how soaking wet his clothes were. He had forgotten entirely about the milk fountain that her breasts had become and had stood right infront of them like an idiot. He could only laugh at it since it was his own fault for being careless. &quot;How does it look, Master?&quot; Garry asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;A little bloody, but otherwise you look stunning Ms. Filly&quot;. Garry recoiled a bit but quickly regained her posture. &quot;Master, I no longer will be Ms. Filly soon, could you perhapse call me differently?&quot; Mr. Valhilly smiled brightly at this sudden realization. &quot;Of course I can. You are my wife! Hmm, just using Mrs. Valhilly sounds way too distant and formal for a happily married couple. I guess I could just use you first name, Grace. But you still must call me Master when we are alone. If we are in public, and not amongst our close friends, call me Dear or Darling, understand?&quot; Grace nodded her head enthusiastically while internally she felt ashamed of her parents for naming her Grace of all things. &quot;Grace Filly? Really? You both are such idiots for choosing my name just to make a joke&quot; she thought to herself. <br />
<br />
Grace&#39;s milk finally settled down as her cupsize had been reduced even further, now only an E cup at best. She was thankful for her how naturally elastic the skin on her breasts were, as even though they were now several sizes smaller, her breasts still looked perfect, and not a sign of sagging or a build up of loose skin. <br />
<br />
Master took her by her shoulder with his hand a began kissing her. She as well returned his kiss gleefully, using her full extent of her mouth, including her tongue to please him. She now fully understood that from now on, she wouldn&#39;t be able to do anything without this man. And that no matter what it was, if this man asked it of her, she would do it to the best of her abilities without question or hesitation. His orders became her law. She would only ever listen to what this man requested from her from now on. While she would still listen to others, she only cared about what her Master would say. She desired to devote everything she had to serving him as his greatest milk maid wife for the rest of her life. Even if that meant changing her own appearance to fit his desires. &quot;Oh, should I probably let him know I can freely alter my appearance?&quot; Grace thought to herself.</p>
