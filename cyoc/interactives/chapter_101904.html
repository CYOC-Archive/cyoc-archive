<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">AUTHOR&#39;S INTRODUCTION<br />
As a fan of both science fiction and DC Comics (at least until they started that &quot;New 52&quot; mess) I can comprehend and appreciate what Blackjack88 is trying to accomplish here.<br />
There are now <i>THREE</i> different versions of Moon Lake on CYOC.net, each varying at a different continuity point.<br />
<b>EARTH-1</b> is the original where, among other things, William and Martha Anderson are a happily married but mixed species were couple while their son Eric just recently declared his love for Julie Stovall while becoming a were-merman in the process.<br />
<b>EARTH-2</b> totally started off differently and went from there, with William and Martha Anderson being a happily married werefox couple and fellow werevixen Yvette Smith never went rogue.<br />
<b>EARTH-3</b> deviated from Earth-1 history the night William Anderson died protecting his family from Yvette Smith&#39;s attack in hope of claiming &quot;her fox&quot;, although I&#39;m honestly not sure whether or not Samantha and Frances Twist already have or will ever change Martha Anderson into a sister werecat.<br />
WITH THAT IN MIND...<br />
<br />
They watched the ambulance carrying Julie Stovall drive off, with her mother by the unconscious daughter&#39;s side.<br />
The medics managed to restore Julie&#39;s pulse, but it was weak, with no prognosis of the outcome as the sirens and flashing lights faded into the night.<br />
Martin Stovall looked at Eric Anderson, the newest werewolf of Moon Lake, and said, &quot;None of this is your fault. Understand me? NONE of this is your fault.&quot;<br />
Eric just raised his muzzle and stared at Julie&#39;s father as he added, &quot;Julie has always been an emotional girl, but I for one can understand and appreciate why you decided to become a werewolf, let alone the path you want your future to take. I lost my father at a relatively young age too, although to cancer. One of the few things that weres are still as vulnerable to as normal humans. Anyway, it&#39;s your life Eric and in the end, you&#39;re the only one who can make the decisions. Now then, if you will excuse me...&quot;<br />
As Martin turned to leave, he spotted Ben Twist and Nate Anderson standing nearby. &quot;Could one of you boys please tell your Alpha I&#39;ll call him sometime tomorrow to apologize for all of this.&quot;<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t think there&#39;s any need for you to do so, but we&#39;ll pass the message on to Austin,&quot; promised Nate.<br />
&quot;Good. Take care,&quot; and with that, Martin Stovall went to find his family&#39;s car and drive to Moon Lake Hospital to await word on his daughter&#39;s fate.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; said Ben Twist once the four of them were alone. &quot;Eric, you may not be aware of this, but your hormones and other body functions won&#39;t be fully rebalanced until morning. So why don&#39;t you and Cassie find a nice quiet spot somewhere and...&quot;<br />
Before Eric could say something about wanting to go to the hospital and check on Julie himself, Cassie had grabbed Eric by a paw as the she-wolf started dragging the new werewolf off into the forest.<br />
Nate stood by his best friend and neighbor, waiting until the others were out of were hearing range until he spoke. &quot;If you don&#39;t mind me asking, why her?&quot;<br />
&quot;Well, I knew Eric sticking to his decision to become a wolf would cause a rift between him and Julie Stovall, although I&#39;ll be the first to admit that I wasn&#39;t expecting such a BIG scene, let alone all that other stuff,&quot; began Ben. &quot;But if things don&#39;t work out between Eric and Julie now...&quot; he added, as a smile crossed his muzzle.<br />
&quot;Oh!&quot; replied Nate, as the realization of Ben&#39;s thought process dawned on him.<br />
&quot;Now let&#39;s go rejoin the orgy ourselves. I need to find a she-wolf of my own to work off some tension, and I know Alex Ramsey&#39;s been asking about you*,&quot; said Ben, putting a furry arm across his friend&#39;s shoulder. &quot;IF my moms&#39; do call, I&#39;ll let you know,&quot; he said, pointing to the cellphone on a large lanyard around his neck.<br />
<br />
MEANWHILE...<br />
Cassie had led Eric back to &quot;their log&quot;, where she not only took his virginity, but made him a fellow werewolf in the process. But now she just sat by his side, letting him lean his weary lupine head on her furry shoulder as she gently stroked his back with one paw while holding him with the other.<br />
&quot;I just don&#39;t understand all of this,&quot; were Eric&#39;s first words when he finally spoke again.<br />
&quot;Like what?&quot; tenderly asked Cassie, still holding him.<br />
&quot;Julie&#39;s reaction for one. While I hadn&#39;t decided what kind of were I&#39;d be at the time, I did mention to her after my father&#39;s funeral that I was thinking about being something stronger than a were-mer, but she just looked at me like I had grown a second head or something.&quot;<br />
&quot;She probably doesn&#39;t understand your conviction. When I graduate high school and go on to college, I want to be a doctor and help people,&quot; revealed Cassie, looking down at him. &quot;Then maybe there will be less people and weres dying in car accidents like my father did.&quot;<br />
&quot;That&#39;s why I want to join the police department after I graduate,&quot; said Eric, sitting up and wiping his tears with his paws. &quot;I was stuck upstairs, helpless, while everyone else was facing off against that rogue werevixen when she attacked my family. If I had been a were too and down there...&quot;<br />
&quot;Eric, I completed grief counseling long ago. You can&#39;t play the IF game. That gets you nowhere. All we can do is move forward.&quot;<br />
He simply nodded and sat silently next to her for awhile. Then Eric asked, &quot;How are your grades?&quot;<br />
&quot;For my first semester of high school, pretty good,&quot; said Cassie. &quot;I&#39;ve got a 3.9 GPA at the moment.&quot;<br />
&quot;Me too,&quot; replied Eric, looking at her.<br />
&quot;Pre-Algebra is kicking my tail though. &#39;Find X&#39;. What if X doesn&#39;t want to be found?&quot;<br />
Eric actually smiled at that before saying, &quot;Pre-Algebra is easy. I- I&#39;d be willing to help you out with it if you need a paw, or hand,&quot; he offered.<br />
&quot;Maybe we can be study buddies,&quot; suggested Cassie. &quot;I&#39;m sure high school has more serious stuff to throw at us besides Pre-Algebra.&quot;<br />
&quot;Gym is what&#39;s keeping me from a solid 4.0,&quot; revealed Eric.<br />
&quot;Afraid you&#39;re on your own with that one,&quot; confessed Cassie. &quot;My first transformation was only earlier this year, but I can assure you that you will NOT have that problem any more,&quot; she said, thinking of how Eric looked now as a werewolf and what his human side would be like by dawn.<br />
&quot;One of the reasons I picked lupine,&quot; replied Eric, before forgetting himself and trying to flex an arm muscle.<br />
&quot;WOW!&quot; both Eric and Cassie said, watching the results.<br />
&quot;You know...&quot; began Cassie, choosing her words carefully. &quot;You weren&#39;t bad looking as a human, and you&#39;re quite dashing as a werewolf.&quot;<br />
&quot;Really?&quot; asked Eric, feeling himself blush under his facial fur. Then he paused before saying, &quot;Listen, I want to thank you. For... everything. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll be having any more sex tonight, but if you want to stay and just talk...&quot;<br />
&quot;That would be nice, but I wouldn&#39;t write having more sex tonight off your agenda just yet,&quot; said Cassie, as she looked downward.<br />
Eric looked down and saw his new lupine red rocket fully extended out of its sheath and eager for action.<br />
&quot;Listen, Cassie, I—&quot;<br />
&quot;Ssshhh,&quot; she said softly, before kissing Eric gently on his furry muzzle. &quot;There are still hours to go before dawn. I&#39;m on the werewolf birth control pill, so I&#39;m protected until about 9 tomorrow morning, and you need the comfort and physical release. Besides, Ben did warn you that your hormones and other body functions are still trying to realign themselves. As a natural born were and a future doctor, I concur with his diagnosis.&quot;<br />
&quot;I—&quot; Eric started to say again, but was cut off by another, but this time more passionate kiss.<br />
Soon Cassie was teaching Eric the more intimate secrets of being a werewolf. Lessons he would easily master and want to practice more until the rising sun of the next morning forced them to call a halt to their activities, for now.<br />
<br />
As they changed back into their human forms and went in search of their missing clothes, Eric grew to appreciate his new friend a little more than he had. She wasn&#39;t bad looking for a budding 14 year old girl, but her kindness at seeing him through a difficult night was what stuck with him the most. For now.<br />
Cassie O&#39;Sullivan** looked at the more muscular and handsomer 14 year old Freshman by her side, with his wisp of new chest hair starting to sprout, and wondered if someday, provided things worked out between them and he was willing, she might become Mrs. Cassie Anderson?<br />
_______________________________________________________________<br />
*I&#39;m presuming at this point in the alternative universe, while Alex is still the one who transformed Nate into a werewolf, Nate is still &quot;in the closet&quot; as far as admitting to his family that he prefers men instead of women, while Ben has yet to acquire a steady girlfriend, let alone hasn&#39;t met the werepanthress Kenya Adaeze yet.<br />
**Unless I have the surname wrong, and I have freely admitted that I&#39;m a hopeless romantic at heart, so if things aren&#39;t destined to work out between Eric and Julie on Earth-3...<br />
AND FOR THOSE INTERESTED, while unfortunately I&#39;m a day late to celebrate Leap Year; the episode title is a song on the <i>Quantum Leap</i> soundtrack, from the QL episode &quot;Piano Man&quot;.—tmw.</p>
