<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“During the rite of transformation it is traditional but not within the Palace itself. ” Explained Lilith as she summoned another portal and walked through. Rachel and Maisy followed suit.<br />
<br />
They found themselves in another rather large room, this one full of a mixture of different size demons and even a few humans to Rachel’s amazement and confusion. <br />
<br />
“Queen Lilith.” bowed a human which caused Rachel’s eyes to widen in amazement.<br />
<br />
“Aren’t you that famous designer who died a couple of months ago?” inquired Rachel.<br />
<br />
“I am indeed, I designed clothing worn by the richest and most famous people on Earth and now I have the honor of doing so for a new set of clients.” explained the designer. <br />
<br />
Maisy leaned over a bit to whisper into Rachel’s ear. <br />
<br />
“We don’t temp humans while on Earth, that is part of the treaty with heaven but once they are down here if they have certain skills, we find useful we hold off on their punishment in return for their services.” explained Maisy “Some of the statues in the great gallery was done by some of the best human hands in history.”<br />
<br />
“I see.” confirmed Rachel. <br />
<br />
“Yes, my daughter has chosen a mate and we need a set of cloths for her to wear to meet my husband and of course we will need dresses for their wedding and the like.” explained Lilith to the designer.<br />
<br />
“A royal wedding, right away.” Said the designer as he began to take measurements of both Rachel and Maisy. <br />
<br />
“Maybe something slightly more modest then normal for Rachel.” Advised Lilith, she had noted how Rachel had been covering herself up a little bit more than a normal demon would. “She is a former human and isn’t used to our clothing style yet.”<br />
<br />
“Of course, my Queen.” stated the Designer as he began his work calling out orders to the other humans and the demons who followed them. The demons seemed slightly upset at following the orders of a human but did it anyhow.<br />
<br />
“Well, I will be back, I need to get dressed myself. I will meet you both in the garden.” Stated Lilith as she headed out of the room leaving Rachel and Maisy alone for the first time as demons. Well alone wasn’t totally true, both sat in the back of the room, the designer hard at work on Rachel’s clothing while a servant had been sent to fetch some for Maisy.<br />
<br />
“How are you doing?” inquired Maisy as she grabbed Rachel’s hand and gave a slight loving squeeze. “I know this is a lot to take in at once, once we meet my folks we will get some rest.”<br />
<br />
“Thanks, I nerves of course but I am ok.” admitted Rachel “Question, what is going to happen to our stuff in our apartment…my God what about Shadow we forgot all about him.”<br />
<br />
Maisy laughed a little.<br />
<br />
“Don’t worry about Shadow, our cat was actually a hell cat in hiding, I have had him since I was ten. He will be waiting for us in our room.” explained Maisy “As for our stuff, most will be replaced with fakes before they fake our death.”<br />
<br />
“What?” inquired Rachel<br />
<br />
“Well, they can’t have humans just go missing, so they fake their deaths, summon some flesh husks to burn in a fire is what they normally do.” explained Maisy “A horrible accident, a house fire killing a couple in their bed, tragic but forgotten in time.”<br />
<br />
“That makes sense, there are some stuff I would like from our place, some of our toys for example.” stated Rachel before giving a slight laugh. “I guess we will not need that strap on if one of us is going to grow a dick at the wedding.”<br />
<br />
“Oh.” Laughed Maisy “That is only a temp dick anyhow so we will need some anyhow.”<br />
<br />
“A what?” inquired Rachel as Maisy gave a slight laugh shaking her head. <br />
<br />
“Sorry I should have been clear, yes at the ceremony one of us will be granted a dick so that we can have a child but once a child is seeded the dick goes away and you or I return to normal only with one of us having a kid growing within us.” explained Maisy “Then in a couple of years or whenever we want another one, we go back and have that part of the ceremony repeated and boom the dick is back. Hell, one of brother&#39;s and his husband have switched back and forth to grow their own pussy and they are on their fifth kid.”<br />
<br />
“I think I understand, how many brothers and sisters do you have anyhow?” inquired Rachel.<br />
<br />
“8 older Sisters, 10 big brothers and more nieces and nephews then I know to count.” Answered Maisy as Rachel’s eyes widened. “I am the youngest currently, but I wouldn’t be surprised if in a hundred years or so I am a big sister to the new youngest child of my parents.”<br />
<br />
“Lady Miasma.” said the servant as he returned with some clothing, it wasn’t a lot.<br />
<br />
It only took a few minutes but soon Maisy was dressed in something that reminded Rachel of something an ancient Egyptian would of worn. Two red gold necklaces held up two pieces of black cloth which wrapped around Maisy’s breasts, it was slightly thicker around her nipples, but it was still very thin. Another red gold band, this one thicker formed a sort of corset bushing up her breasts while keeping her mid drift totally open to everyone. A couple pieces of jewel also of red gold, on her arms one of which showed the classic pentagram shape on. She wrapped more black cloth around her deer like lower body but stopping at upper calf on either side with a longer piece hanging down between her legs. A belt of red gold with a large red ruby in the center finished the clothing.<br />
<br />
“You look amazing.” Said Rachel as Maisy leaned over and gave her a tender kiss. <br />
<br />
“Thank you.” Said Maisy as the designer came forward with Rachel’s clothing.<br />
<br />
It covered a lot more of Rachel’s body than Maisy’s covered her. <br />
<br />
Rachel felt much more comfortable now that she was in some clothes, even if she knew that if her father had seen her in anything like this while a human she would have been beaten until she was black and blue. She flinched a little from the memory of the childhood beatings her father had given her before looking back at herself. <br />
<br />
A demon was busy doing her hair, putting it into a braid that went around her horns before going down her back. However the dress was killer, it was strapless and started about half way toward her shoulders before going down in a deep V to show a lot of cleavage but in a tasteful way. It was a neon blue color which really stood out against all the blacks and reds but went great with her white skin and neon blue scales. A white corset held everything extra tight and upright before the dress became loser around her hips going down to about ankle high but with a high cut to one side. The dress was open back for her wings and was cut in such a way to allow her tail to be free. Some arm bands and a necklace with the pentagram shape in gold soon arrived as well to grace her neck.<br />
<br />
“Well, I think we are ready. I was told my parents will be waiting in the garden to dine with us.” Said Maisy as she took Rachel by the arm and headed out of the room. <br />
<br />
They got a few looks as they moved through the Palace, everyone knew of Maisy of course but none knew who this demoness who was with her was. <br />
<br />
Rachel gulped as they passed through another door and into the outside of air. She expected to see fire and brim stone and that was there, but it actually felt like a warm spring day to her. <br />
<br />
The gardens surprised her as well, sure the trees were white bark with blood red leaves and red sap coming out but there was what appeared to be flowers growing around them and paved walking paths. Then she noticed that one of the trees had a human face and that the sap looked a lot like blood.<br />
<br />
“Are these people?” inquired Rachel. <br />
<br />
“Yes, it is one of the more common punishments, they are frozen in place all the while they can see and hear everything. Those flowers have thorns which grows into their tree body and the insects that feed on them….well they are horrifying even by our standards. They feel everything too, punishment for what they did in life.” explained Maisy, this was normal to her but would have been horrifying to any normal human, Rachel&#39;s new demonhood meant she didn&#39;t feel as uneasy as a human but it was still uneasy at first glance. “The first circle of hell has whole forests full of trees like these, however the souls in those trees have a chance to go to either heaven or be reborn on Earth after a few years of punishment for their sins on Earth…these here, will be here forever not moving unless my dad wants to punish them personally.”<br />
<br />
“And what did this one do?” inquired Rachel, then spotted through the bark that the man was wearing an arm band she knew all too well from her history books and suddenly all possibly pity she had hearing the punishment went away.<br />
<br />
“Here, mostly genocide and the like, my father likes to take care of them personally but come on, time to meet my parents.” explained Maisy as they moved toward the center of the garden where her parents and possibly others would be waiting.</p>
