<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The nearest strip club to campus had made a grave marketing error. The establishment in question, The Mammary Maison, had thought this would be a good week to recruit some hot young college students who were desperate for cash, but as it turned out, having that kind of stall at a student fair went down like a lead balloon. <br />
<br />
So Paulie, the sleazy 30 year old manager, was packing flyers into a box, resolving not to bother for the rest of the week when Princess Zuri walked up. Inside her head, her thoughts were roiling. The princess was sheltered. Very sheltered. As in, did not know what a strip club was, sheltered. James was not... but he was feeling how Zuri would act subsuming him, until he was struggling to bring to mind what a strip club was.<br />
<br />
&quot;Excuse me,&quot; he found himself saying in his thick African accent. &quot;What is &#39;strip club&#39;?&quot; Paulie turned, ready to laugh at some kid, but he could only find his jaw drop, his hands instinctively moving to adjust his hair, making sure it was slicked back. This chick was HOT. Clearly from the middle of nowhere, dressed up a little too formally so probably not too &#39;with it&#39;.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, doll, I think it&#39;s something you&#39;d be great at!&quot; he laughed, slipping one hairy forearm around Zuri&#39;s slender waist. James hated this sleazebag instantly, but weirdly, Zuri was finding the older guy charming, enjoying his attention. <br />
<br />
&quot;But what is it?&quot; Zuri cocked her head, giggling at this strangely charming man&#39;s behaviour.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... what it is, girls who are pretty like you.&quot; She preened a little; it seemed Zuri had a thing for older white guys. &quot;You wear pretty lingerie, and dance for men, and take some of that lingerie off. The men even give you money to show you how happy you&#39;ve made them.&quot;<br />
<br />
Zuri&#39;s jaw dropped, even as James rolled his eyes. Was he really meant to believe she didn&#39;t know how bad that was? And she did have some doubts... &quot;Wow! That... is that allowed in this country?&quot; she asked incredulously.<br />
<br />
Paulie made a face. &quot;Well... a lot of people disapprove, but a lot of people love it. Tell you what. How about you come try it out, huh? Don&#39;t like, you don&#39;t need to do it again. You do like it, well... I think we&#39;d give you as many shifts as you liked.&quot;<br />
<br />
Zuri pursed her lips. This seemed unusual, but well, if it was totally unheard of, why would it be at the university? &quot;Alright. What harm is in trying new things?&quot; And so it was she let this sleazy strip club manager lead her off to the other side of campus. It was very close, just a couple of streets away. And all the way there, Paulie was so attentive, asking about her home country and her major and how old she was. Zuri had resolved to not reveal her royal status, but it was fun being chatted up like this.<br />
<br />
The outside of the club was a little dingy, a neon sign with the silhouette of a woman, &#39;THE MAMMARY MAISON&#39; in big letters. The red front doors were locked shut, but Paulie had the key and soon she was inside. It was dingy inside too, but not everywhere was a literal palace, Zuri tried to be charitable. A bar went against one wall, a couple of platforms with poles on them surrounded by chairs. To the other side of the club were a couple of narrow hallways, one marked with &#39;OFFICES&#39;, the other &#39;PRIVATE ROOMS&#39;.<br />
<br />
Paulie led her to another side room, behind one of the stages, the dressing room. Underwear and make-up and other accoutrements were strewn haphazardly everywhere. &quot;Well, uh... How big are you? Up top?&quot; he asked, rummaging through a pile.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh... 34F,&quot; Zuri giggled. Paulie let out a wolf whistle, miming large breasts with his hands before resuming his search, and she giggled. James was furious at how naive she was! <br />
<br />
Finally, he turned, handing her a leopard-spotted bikini. &quot;OK, so stage is just up there, come out once you&#39;ve got changed. Grab a pair of high heels too.&quot;<br />
<br />
Which is how Princess Zuri, heir to the throne of Katanga, found herself wobbling along the stage towards the pole, in a tiny leopard print bikini that showed every inch of her dark skin but barely contained her wobbling, bouncing breasts. She held onto the pole, looking out at Paulie who was leaning forward in a chair. &quot;You look gorgeous, baby doll, really gorgeous. Do you think you can dance around the pole, you know, make yourself look good for the men who come in?&quot;<br />
<br />
In no time, Paulie was able to gently coach Zuri into a incredibly sexy, if basic routine, twirling around the pole, bending to show off her pert little butt and her big knockers. James wanted to tear his hair out, she was enjoying this! &quot;Now, if men are enjoying it, they&#39;ll give you money,&quot; Paulie told her, showing her how to accept bills in her thong, in her bra, cupping her breast briefly as he did so. &quot;You don&#39;t mind a quick touch there, just to show you how pretty you are, how nice you dance.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I... I guess not,&quot; Zuri said, a shy smile on her face. &quot;But, Paulie, this feels like sex thing. Is it... ?&quot; she asked, and he chuckled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, in the private rooms, men will ask you to go, and maybe ask you to do stuff. Now it&#39;s technically not allowed, but so long as they don&#39;t touch you if you don&#39;t want them to, what&#39;s wrong with taking some money if they want to have some fun.&quot; Paulie laughed. &quot;What kind of boys do you like?&quot;<br />
<br />
Zuri turned away, giggling. &quot;I... I... Well, I like older white men,&quot; she confessed, feeling ashamed of herself. Paulie only laughed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, you&#39;re gonna be a heartbreaker, you are. Shame I&#39;m married. Tell you what, you&#39;re interested in it, we can find you one of those. But... well, you&#39;ve tried it, do you like it, do you want the job? We&#39;re opening tomorrow night, y&#39;know, to celebrate the start of the fall semester. Some of the rich seniors around here, well, they like a good night out.&quot;<br />
<br />
James howled internally as Princess Zuri of Katanga became a stripper.</p>
