<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I went straight way to Kevin's house nad there met with his dear wife Joan. She had long since felt her husband was up to something, but was one never to look a gift horse in the mouth. She and I went upstairs and searched the bedroom for those special &quot;lucky&quot; specticles.<br />
<br />
The ambulance driver must have taken them from Kevin and of all places laid them on the mantle over his bedroom fireplace. They were found and then it was time for some truth between brother-in-law and his sister-in-law.<br />
<br />
Joan asked me why the glasses were such a lucky thing for her husband? I stood there wondering and then suggested we go downstairs to the family room. Once there I did as had Kevin with me accept Joan was a little more difficult about believing me than I had with Kevin.<br />
<br />
Once she had seen things through the lenses and almost reached out to touch a person passing in history, she felt the drain on her life and removed her hand to be tight to one's body.<br />
<br />
As she then having experienced the workings of the old and gold specticals she was like I of a mind to hide them away from small hands.<br />
<br />
I reported back to Kevin the next morning as he lay there upset and filled of worries. <br />
<br />
He asked me many questions of which one about me having shown Joan anything of the specticles, I denied, he need not know it for now. He was very talkative about them having tried and toyed with the things often.<br />
<br />
The thing was as much magic as it was strange since Kevin told me how on occasion the glasses would tell of those who owned them in the past. He mentioned Ellen Whinthrope and her untimely demise. His telling of her use of the glasses and the accidental removal by her new husband had her lost and entwined with a stallion horse named, &quot;Seashore Run.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kevin's accounting of her exploits when sharing the body and mind of the steed, were to say quite explicate. Her sensations over having become an animal and a male one at that were most sensual, actually a little too personal! <br />
<br />
I had to ask it, I wanted to know how he could tell what the lady felt like when being as a stallion and horse. He I was almost sure could not have reached that far into history to effect a connection between his mind and that of stallion and lady. <br />
<br />
Kevin informed me that by asking the glasses to venture to that point in her life and then as he saw her body die and her soul slipped from body into horse he moved the glasses to just about falling from off his nose.<br />
<br />
The specticals warned him of such a foolish move, but he thought himself careful enough not to move his head or look down which might make them fall, and he along with her would live as a stallion too.<br />
<br />
Often when late at night or at times when alone and wanting for something to give him a thrill he'd venture to visit her and the stallion horse she had become. Kevin found himself more and more drawn to her as from her soul he could actually feel what she felt as also what the stallion did and he felt.<br />
<br />
The act of mating had his mind and senses captured, as Kevin had found a several points in time where the stallion was put to stud. The raw bestial act of procreation was for the horse a simple instinct. Yet Elen having been a human felt this from a different realization and conveyed her sensual sensations to Kevin.<br />
<br />
The sensing of the beast in the act of mating was almost beyond his ability to discribe. He told me his own penis became so erect he thought it might burst once and stopped the scene before he was injured.<br />
<br />
This only wet his sensual appetite for more physical contacting the animal world and that's when he became distracted almost to his own death.<br />
<br />
Having seen his funeral and then the act which caused his death leaving him to live in the 1700's as an Irish Woldhound he visited his own soul's final repose.<br />
<br />
This was worse than feeling the sexual life of a horse and stallion. He told me that after spending long hours finding those points where the big dog body was in the act of mating, he returned to those times often. It was when he as seeing himself this large and tall dog being dragged around by the Govenor or his beautiful daughter on a leash, he came upon a time of incest.<br />
<br />
Inside the daughter's bedroom he saw himself curled up and licking his sheath clean as does a dog. The daughter being as young and beautiful had many who would come at night and toy with her sensual body. It was on one night she saw him cleaning himself and came to him naked as the day she was born.<br />
<br />
The dog self got up sensing the scent of female and nosed his, their snout into her groin, Sniffing in the wonderful scent of female it made the girl have an orgasm and thus got the dog all upset and thrilled.<br />
<br />
He felt as much as saw his Irish Wolfhound's red pointed cock emerge out past the long and large furry sheath. Out it came a good ten inches and as the girl stood there gawking at it and licking her lips the dog got up on his hind feet.<br />
<br />
Fawning on his master lady the Wolfhound cock was an almost perfect match in height to the girl's vaginal opening. As he taunted her with his prick she felt the lusty desire to try something really new.<br />
<br />
A slight rise on her toes and then lowering herself down let the point of the Wolfhound's prick enter her sexy lips. Once past the point of no return it was kevin as the human tickled to delight that guided the Wolfhound into a sexual display with the girl. Thrusting up and bouncing on hind feet the doggy red shaft moved higher and higher into the girl's vagina. <br />
<br />
It was then the girl began to realize she was about to have actual sex with her dog. She tried to push him off her and in so doing ended up falling backwards onto her bed.<br />
<br />
This made things even more easy for the Wolfhound as he began to pump and ram themselves deeper and deeper into the girl. It was as Kevin was sweating himself and feeling the sensual moment that the doggies' knot slipped up into the girl's tight vagina.<br />
<br />
Now the real act of mating commenced and dog was in urgent desire to give his bitch what she and he both longed for and wanted intently.<br />
<br />
The girl moaned and groaned her vagina being stretched to the breaking point as the dog and pet was having the best sex and the biggest hard on of his life.<br />
<br />
Feeling this all Kevin could think of his own life and the relationship he had with Joan. He reflected on their sexual sensations and was of a mind one of the time to remove the glasses and become part in part with that sex minded Wolfhound.<br />
<br />
It was of his own wretchid experiences with the glasses that he knew they could be the doom of anyone in his family, most of all one of the children.<br />
<br />
Kevin made me swear an oath of promise to keep all he'd told me in confidence, as if I did tell anyone and they would believe me!</p>
