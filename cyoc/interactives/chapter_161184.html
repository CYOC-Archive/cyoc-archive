<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">For the last nine Earth months, or forty something magical years, Victor Roshkovich remained behind bars at the once seemingly inescapable Fallen Island Magical Correction Facility. He was returned to the cell that had kept him safely secured for twenty Earth years, more than a thousand magical years. Before he did what no inmate had done before him and broke out, it was thought to be impossible. To ensure he would remain in place this time, the magical world did their best to fortify the facility. Unfortunately, as their apprehension of the wizard came so soon after his escape, the preparation time was not what it should have been.<br />
<br />
The wizard had already figured out how to break through the new defense system the prison put up. The structure of the facility remained the same, so that was not something he needed to study again. He didn’t have to worry about a lack of strength, as he had stocked up on energy regenerators, before he was brought back to this place he despised so much. He wasn’t going to make the same mistakes he made the last time he escaped, either. All he had to do was figure out what kind of new traps they had placed on his cell, so he’d be careful to avoid setting them off. It took much less time than the period between his first imprisonment and his subsequent escape, but he had finally managed to crack the code. <br />
<br />
“I’ve finally figured it out” the wizard thought to himself, as he completed his meditative study of the various spells on the facility.<br />
<br />
If the magical world had wanted to make sure Victor would stay in his assigned, high security cell this time, then they should have stopped him from meditating, by any means necessary. Because of this crucial oversight, the wizard regained his strength and had a keen awareness of anything that could stop his desire to break out of his cell. It confined him and suffocated him. It prevented him from fulfilling the mission he tried to start many Earth months ago. He needed to get back the ring first, but then he would be ready to finish what he had long set out to do.<br />
<br />
“Kill Freddy Benson” the wizard thought to himself. “Michael Scavolini, too.”<br />
<br />
After many months of preparation, the wizard was ready to escape. Gathering his strength together in his cell, the wizard repeated what he done the first time he managed to flee. He broke the walls off of his cell and crushed two correction officers to death underneath it. Levitating up into the air, the sirens immediately blared and a red alert was sent throughout the entire facility. <br />
<br />
“Red alert!” a voiceover blared from the speakers. “Victor Roshkovich has broken out of his cell! I repeat! Red alert! Victor Roshkovich has broken out of his cell!”<br />
<br />
The wizard levitated down the hall, but this time, he did not plan to just bolt out the front door. He wanted some assistance first, in the hopes of preserving his energy and strength.<br />
<br />
“I’ve learned from my previous mistakes” the wizard thought to himself, as he sped off to the other holding cells by flight.<br />
<br />
Approaching the various cells that held some of the most dangerous criminals in the magical world, the wizard, one by one, opened the gates and freed the various wizards, witches and warlocks locked up behind them. They cheered and cried out in joy, as they fought off magical correctional officers and pushed their way to the exit. The wizard managed to fight off the guards coming after him with ease, as he released every single prisoner in the facility; 5000 in total.<br />
<br />
When they were all let out of their cells, the wizard ordered them to bust down the exit door. Congregating together, the evil wizards, witches and warlocks made their way to the exit, with the intention of making an escape. The remaining correctional officers, the ones that hadn’t been killed, all formed a blockade with the intention of pushing the evil army of magical beings back inside to their cells. They managed to stop some of them, but the force of their evil was too overwhelming for them to overcome. Finally, after a valiant effort, the correctional officers were trampled to their deaths, as the prisoners busted down the door and escaped the prison. <br />
<br />
Fleeing out in droves, a sense of darkness fell across the magical world. It was as if a war was about to begin, a war of the forces of good versus the forces of evil. These evil wizards and witches had been locked away for magical millenniums. In their minds, it was time to seek revenge on those who had imprisoned them there. This mattered not to the wizard, who was completely disinterested in his cellmates quest for vengeance. <br />
<br />
“I have a priority of my own” the wizard thought to himself, as he surveyed the dead bodies of the magical correctional officers below him. “I have no time for this war of theirs. I have other business to attend to.”<br />
<br />
The wizard sped out of the prison at a speed faster than light. Soon, he opened up a portal to Earth and quickly made his way inside, before anyone could stop him. The journey could be a strain on a magical being’s body, especially one that was done without authorization of the magical world. However, he had developed enough strength to withstand the pressure, as he made his way back to Earth. <br />
<br />
When the wizard landed, he crashed into the road below him, leaving a huge dent in the pavement upon impact.  Moaning quietly, he got up and surveyed the scene in front of him. It was the same neighborhood he had landed in all those months ago. He recognized the spot immediately. It was the same one he landed in last time. He had been delayed for nine Earth months from completing his mission, but with the magical world now distracted by the war that raged across the land, he had no worries about being apprehended this time.<br />
<br />
Using his powers of psychic surveillance, the wizard began to track down Freddy Benson. When he found him, he could see that he was no longer human. He had become a dog again, something that Victor knew could only have been brought about by one thing.<br />
<br />
“The Ruggeri ring” the wizard thought to himself. “I dropped it when those damn officers took me back to that horrible place. I know I said I’d never go back there again, but I mean it this time. I’d rather die than be stuck in that god awful place ever again. Hopefully, with the mess they’re going to need to clean up now, that won’t be a problem for me any longer.”<br />
<br />
The next piece of business was finding out who currently possessed the ring he so desired. Scanning the town, he found the person who currently held onto its magical power.<br />
<br />
“The mayor. Of course. A man with a great ambition for power would naturally be attracted to an object of such mystique. But why, I wonder? And how did he get his hands on it?”<br />
<br />
The wizard levitated up into the air and floated quietly to the center of town. The streets at night were deserted, so he managed to avoid detection. Even the dent he made in the pavement did not attract the notice of the sleepy neighborhood residents. When he tracked down the source of the ring’s energy, he came across the town hall building.<br />
<br />
“I should probably get a feel for what’s happening here, before I make my grand entrance.”<br />
<br />
The wizard used his energy to pull up all the information on the mayor that he could. He found that he was facing a tough race against Freddy Benson, who was vying for his job. He found that Freddy had been wanted by the police for murder of their fellow officers, but that was of no concern to him. Freddy needed to be killed and the mayor could be of assistance to him in achieving this goal.<br />
<br />
“He’s tried to kill him twice now. He’ll find that the third time is the charm.”<br />
<br />
When he gathered up all of the information he needed to make his case to the mayor and the others that stood inside the building with him, the wizard quietly levitated himself inside. Mary, the mayor’s secretary, stood guard at the front desk, as the wizard entered the building.<br />
<br />
“Can I help you, sir?” she asked with an irritated tone in her voice. <br />
<br />
The wizard cast a spell that made her fall asleep on the desk. Quietly floating his way down the hall, he took note of the locked offices and the chamber where legislation was enacted. <br />
<br />
“No one else is in the room where the sausage gets made” the wizard thought to himself “except for me on this very night.”<br />
<br />
The wizard approached the door of the mayor’s section of the town hall building. Finding it was locked, the wizard worked with his sense of telekinesis to unlock the door and turn the knob with his mind. When it was opened, the mayor floated inside and took note of the various cubicles of the mayor’s advisors and staff. <br />
<br />
“Interesting” he thought to himself. <br />
<br />
“Who is out there?!” the mayor shrieked from the other end of his office door. <br />
<br />
“An observant one, I see.”<br />
<br />
“Somebody’s following me! I can sense it!”<br />
<br />
“Or just paranoid. Either way, a valuable asset to have on my side, once I’ve successfully made my case.”<br />
<br />
Inside of the mayor’s office, the room was bunched up with all of the mayor’s advisors, save for Adam and Dennis, along with two police officers standing by the door. The mayor looked increasingly agitated and nervous, as his advisors feared for the deterioration of their boss’ mental health.<br />
<br />
“Somebody is out there!” the mayor yelled. “Mary?! Who is out there?! Mary?!”<br />
<br />
As if to answer his question in that moment, the wizard used his mental prowess to unlock the door and turn the knob with his mind. In response, the two police officers standing guard drew their weapons, as the wizard appeared to them, levitating in the air as he did so.<br />
<br />
“Who the fuck are you?!?!?!?!” the mayor shrieked. “Get the fuck out of my office right now or my men will shoot!!!!!!!”<br />
<br />
“Who are you to threaten me?” the wizard asked with a snort. “You greatly underestimate my skill and strength.”<br />
<br />
“Shoot him, boys!!!!!!”<br />
<br />
The police officers tried to fire their guns, but found that they were not working. <br />
<br />
“Son of a bitch” one of the officers muttered to himself nervously. <br />
<br />
“Is that how you treat visitors?” the wizard asked with a chuckle. “How discourteous.”<br />
<br />
The wizard used his mental powers to take the guns away from the officers and bunch them up into balls that looked like cannons. Slowly moving them back, the officers looked on in fear, as the wizard then shrunk them into the size of bullets. With one last snicker, the wizard shot the bullets into the officers heads, killing them upon impact. <br />
<br />
“Holy shit!!!!!” the mayor shrieked, as the two officers fell onto his desk, bleeding from their heads, before they slunk onto the floor. <br />
<br />
The mayor tried to pull out his communication device, but the wizard crushed it with his mind. The other advisors tried to pull out their own devices, but the wizard crushed theirs as well.<br />
<br />
“Mary!!!!!!” the mayor tried to scream, before the wizard closed the door with his mind and locked it tightly.<br />
<br />
“You’re not going anywhere, Mr. Mayor” the wizard said quietly. <br />
<br />
&quot;Help!!!!!! Somebody get this man out of here!!!!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
“Not until we’ve had a little chat first.”<br />
<br />
“You don’t get to threaten me!!!! I’m the boss of this town!!!! I make the orders around here!!!!! Now get out of here before—“<br />
<br />
“Before what? You call someone with a device you can no longer use? You try to escape your room with no windows and with a door that is entirely in my control? How do you plan to escape me now, Mr. Mayor? You are effectively held hostage. You have no means of escape.”<br />
<br />
The mayor’s advisors crouched onto the floor, in fear of the evil man hovering in the air of their boss’ office. The mayor looked panic stricken, before the wizard levitated himself back onto the floor. <br />
<br />
“I’m not here to hurt you” the wizard continued. “Not if it isn&#39;t necessary for me to do so. I’m not here to kill you, either. I am here, if you would have allowed to say this earlier, without the unwanted interruption of those men you ordered to shoot me, to help you.”<br />
<br />
“Help me?!?!?! You killed my officers!!!!!! Some help you are!!!!!!!!!”<br />
<br />
The mayor pointed at the bleeding dead bodies of the officers, who had been ordered to protect the mayor from the threat of the wizard. <br />
<br />
“They tried to kill me first” the wizard replied defensively. “You could have ordered your men to stand down and that wouldn’t have happened.”<br />
<br />
“Son of a bitch!!!!! I’ve had almost thirty officers killed today! At this rate, we’re going to lose our entire police department by sunrise!!!!!!”<br />
<br />
“That doesn’t have to happen, if you agree to help me.”<br />
<br />
“Help you?!?!?!?! Why the fuck would I want to help you?!?!?!?!”<br />
<br />
“Because you and I have a common enemy.”<br />
<br />
“Who?!?!?!?! Freddy Benson?!?!?!?!”<br />
<br />
The wizard chuckled in response. <br />
<br />
“That’s the one. You’re quite observant, Mr. Mayor. I could sense you weren’t just the typical pathetic mortal. You have a better understanding of things than your fellow peons give you credit for. You have vision and an understanding of things that can’t be explained by science. You also have something in your possession that I want.”<br />
<br />
The wizard walked up to the mayor&#39;s desk and signaled him to pull out his hand. When the mayor held it up, the wizard smiled at the sight of what he had been desperately seeking.<br />
<br />
“There she is. There’s my beauty.”<br />
<br />
“Beauty? What beauty?”<br />
<br />
“The ring on your finger.”<br />
<br />
“What about it?!?!?!&quot; the mayor shrieked, as he pulled his hand back down into his lap. &quot;I’m not giving it to you!!!!! It’s the only thing stopping Freddy Benson from coming after me!!!!! I won’t let you have it!!!!!”<br />
<br />
“How about we make a little deal, Mr. Mayor?” the wizard offered.<br />
<br />
“Deal?!?!?! No!!!!! I don’t make deals with terrorists!!!!!”<br />
<br />
An advisor tried to stand up, with the intention of attacking the wizard, but he was aggressively pushed back to the floor with magic.<br />
<br />
“Let me explain something to you, Mr. Mayor. I have been following your race very closely. You are now a mere four points from losing to your rival next week. You have a lot on the line here and have not been successful at removing Freddy Benson from this Earth so far. I can help you make that possible and then some.”<br />
<br />
“How? How can you help me?!”<br />
<br />
“You and I both want that communist Freddy Benson dead.”<br />
<br />
The wizard’s eyes turned green, as he began to hypnotize the mayor. <br />
<br />
“You and I both hate that scumbag” he continued. “You and I both have a personal animosity towards that man.”<br />
<br />
“Yes” the mayor replied, almost under a state of hypnosis. “Yes I do.”<br />
<br />
“Sir” Marley tried to call out quietly.<br />
<br />
“You and I have both tried to kill this man in the past” the wizard went on “but neither of us alone have been successful.”<br />
<br />
“No” the mayor replied in a trance. “No, we have not been successful.”<br />
<br />
“Instead of trying to kill him by ourselves, why don’t we join forces? Unite together to kill our common enemy?”<br />
<br />
“Kill our common enemy. That ratfucker Freddy Benson.”<br />
<br />
“Sir” Marley tried to say again. <br />
<br />
“You hate that man as much as I do” the wizard continued. <br />
<br />
“That I do” the mayor replied in a trance. <br />
<br />
“You see him as a threat to your political ambitions.”<br />
<br />
“That I do.”<br />
<br />
“You want to remove him from this Earth by any means necessary.”<br />
<br />
“That I do.”<br />
<br />
“So join me, Mr. Mayor. Call up your remaining forces and let us team up together to kill Freddy Benson once and for all.”<br />
<br />
“Wait.”<br />
<br />
The mayor snapped out of his trance and angrily glared at the wizard. <br />
<br />
“What do I get out of this?!?!?!?!” he asked angrily.<br />
<br />
“The satisfaction of eliminating your rival” the wizard replied with a stone faced stare. <br />
<br />
“That’s not enough! You want this ring on my finger? Then you’re going to have to pay up! I don’t give stuff like this away for free! That’s not how power works in this town!”<br />
<br />
“I see. I’ll tell you what.”<br />
<br />
The wizard walked around to the back of the mayor and gently placed his hands on his shoulders. The mayor fell into a deeper trance than the one he was in before. Marley began to sweat profusely, as the other advisors looked up in horror. <br />
<br />
“I can feel you are a man of great ambition” the wizard said. “Someone who has aspirations for higher office.”<br />
<br />
“Yes” the mayor replied with a smirk. &quot;I do.&quot;<br />
<br />
“You want to eliminate Freddy Benson so you can win reelection handily, so you can go on to bigger and better things from here.”<br />
<br />
“Yes. Yes, I do.”<br />
<br />
“I’ll tell you what. If you give me the ring once we’ve killed Freddy Benson, then I will use my magic to give you an easy sailing to a bigger seat than this mere small town mayorship.”<br />
<br />
“Yes.”<br />
<br />
“You could become a US senator.”<br />
<br />
“Yes.”<br />
<br />
“You could become the governor of this state of California.”<br />
<br />
“Yes.”<br />
<br />
“You could even become President of the United States.”<br />
<br />
“Yes!!!! Yes, that’s what I’ve always wanted!!!!!”<br />
<br />
Marley gulped nervously, while the wizard continued to play with the mayor’s emotions using his magic.<br />
<br />
“If you give me back the ring on your finger, then I will get you any office your heart desires. Just say the word and I will deliver it to you on a silver platter.”<br />
<br />
“Sir” Marley said. “I think you’re making a mistake here. You’re making a deal with the devil. You’re—“<br />
<br />
Marley saw a zipper appear on his mouth, which was then shut tightly. Marley tried to pull it off, but found that it was bound tightly to his lips. He let out a series of muffled moans, as he tried to warn the mayor against agreeing to the wizard’s demands.<br />
<br />
“What do you say, Mr. Mayor?” the wizard asked seductively. “Do we have a deal?”<br />
<br />
The mayor’s eyes turned green with envy, as the thoughts of power and money filled his brain. All of his rational thoughts flew out the proverbial window, as he became consumed by his desire to become the most powerful man in the world. He didn’t think through the possibility that the wizard would renege on any deal he made later. He didn’t think through the possibility that this was some kind of trap. He didn’t even think through the fact that the wizard just killed two of his officers. None of that mattered to the mayor. In that moment, he made a fateful decision that would change his life forever. <br />
<br />
“It’s a deal” he decided. <br />
<br />
“Good” the wizard replied with a smirk, as he let go of the mayor’s shoulders. <br />
<br />
Walking around to the front of the mayor’s desk, the wizard ordered that the mayor’s advisors stand up. <br />
<br />
“Now that you’re on board with my plan” he continued “let’s track down where Freddy Benson is right now.”<br />
<br />
“I have a feeling I know where he is” the mayor replied, as the wizard fixed his communication device with his magic. “Just let me make a quick call to someone first.”<br />
<br />
At Tom’s house…..</p>
