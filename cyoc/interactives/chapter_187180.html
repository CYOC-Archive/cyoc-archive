<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">A window popped up.<br />
<br />
YOU HAVE BEEN MATCHED WITH ROBERT.<br />
ITEM REQUESTED: USB DRIVE.<br />
DURATION: 60 HRS.<br />
<br />
What? Matt thought. A USB drive? Those things old people used instead of the cloud? <br />
<br />
Before he had a moment to react, suddenly his room was turning hazy and flickering out of existence. It was replaced with a sterile, Spartan office interior. A corner office of a nearby high rise building, all decorated in cool grey and blue tones. Matt shivered, and looked down to realize he was naked, his bare feet on the cold floor. There was large desk closer to the window, with a figure sitting in it, holding a phone up to his ear. The figure spun around in the chair, revealing a very attractive businessman in a cool grey suit. He looked about 30-35. Definitely older than the type of guys Matt usually went for, but it was clear this man took care of himself. The fitted suit hinted at the still physically fit body underneath. Matt chewed on his lower lip, feeling both horny and deeply awkward.<br />
<br />
“I’ll call you back,” said the man. Robert, Matt supposed. Robert set the phone down, then stood up and looked Matt over appreciatively. <br />
<br />
“You’ll do just fine,” said Robert. He took his jacket off and hung it on the clothes hanger, then walked over to the closed door and locked it. “Don’t worry about anything, you’re in good hands. I put myself on the app on weekends and on vacations. There’s nothing like being used as an object, right?”<br />
<br />
Robert walked up to Matt, the removed jacket revealing bulging muscles barely restrained by the dress shirt. Robert put both hands on Matt’s shoulders, and Matt looked up at the man’s salt and pepper stubble, his cool blue eyes. Matt breathed in and smelled cologne. He felt warmth as the man kissed him on the mouth, and the warmth spread throughout his body. Robert kissed Matt for a few moments more, then a gurgling sound came from Matt’s torso and Robert stopped. <br />
<br />
“Guess you’re starting,” said Robert. He walked over to a small fridge and pulled out a beer. Popping the cap off, he walked over to a set of chairs and sat down. <br />
<br />
“I hope you don’t mind if I watch,” he said.<br />
<br />
Matt didn’t know how to respond to this question, but the strange twisting sounds suddenly grew louder, and a wave of pleasure streaked through Matt’s naked body, making him groan audibly with pleasure.<br />
<br />
“Fuck,” said Robert, taking a sip of his drink.<br />
<br />
Matt looked down at his feet, and saw that the floor was slowly getting closer. Looking up, he realized he was shrinking. He held up his hands, and saw his fingers starting to pull into the pads of his hand. His toes were doing the same thing. He wiggled them one last time before they sunk into his feet. A crunching sound began, and Matt’s legs began to condense, slowly shrinking and simplifying. His legs and arms were getting shorter, and had the effect of lowering him even closer to the ground. He was barely as tall as the coffee table now, and as his head passed the top of it, the coffee table was moved away. It pulled to the other side of the room, and Robert sat back down to continue watching. Matt was getting smaller, each burst of pleasure coinciding with his body diminishing with a crack. His arms only went to above his elbow now, and the stubs began to press into the sides of his torso. <br />
<br />
Matt was a strange sight, his fit, 23-year-old body the size of a large shoe, with no arms and stubs of legs that were finishing their drawling up into his torso, but otherwise fully human. The only other change he noticed is that his penis, contrasting with the rest of his shrinking body, had stayed the same size. Matt watched as his legs finished their changes, pulling up completely into his torso, and his still regular-sized cock and balls gently pressed onto the floor. Suddenly, with no legs to support his body, Matt felt himself falling back. He was now on the floor, facing the ceiling. Robert was suddenly in his field of vision, standing over him. A hand was reaching out, and when the fingers made contact, gently gripping his diminished torso and cock, the wave of pleasure was too great and Matt’s atrophied body shivered as he came. Matt’s cock gently expelled semen into the man’s cupped hands, slowly pooling around his small body. Robert smirked, and didn’t seemed bothered by Matt’s indecency. <br />
<br />
“That’s so fucking hot,” the giant whispered, setting Matt down on the coffee table. Matt felt something rough wrapping around his body and cock, wiping the cum away. His sensitive penis stiffened as the rough paper towel rapped around his cock, and a droplet more of semen squeezed out of Matt’s cockhead.<br />
<br />
“Messy boy,” Robert said with a smirk. Matt stared up at the giant; he tried to nod or make some acknowledgement, but his neck was stiffening. Crunching sounds filled the air as his back flexed, his bones expanding with cracking and squelching sounds. He was feeling colder now, his body shrinking slower. He was hardening too, as human flesh began to change into cold blue transparent plastic. Matt felt his balls begin to draw up into his hardening torso, but his shaft remained. His nipples and abs were flattening against his changing torso, until they no longer existed physically, merely flat marks on the surface. Matt’s ears and hair pulled into his head, which with a wet crunching sound was starting to sink into his torso. Matt’s shoulders cracked as the torso began to round itself, flattening and taking on a rounded rectangular shape. The giant fingers, now even larger, were suddenly in front of Matt’s diminishing face. As Robert’s index finger playfully touched his face, his nose sunk into his body. Matt’s tiny mouth opened in an erotic gasp one last time, groaning as the finger playfully traced along the length of his tiny body. Matt closed his eyes with pleasure, and they were gone. With a wet crunch, his head began its final decent into his rounding plastic torso. Matt’s brain began to harden and stiffen as it sunk.<br />
<br />
Matt’s cock began to stiffen again, shrinking as well but showing as it was now almost the size of the entire rest of Matt’s body. He cock began to deform, flattening and stretching. Matt’s glans flexed when his pisshole opened, gently and pleasurably stretching his glans as it opened, and began to grow the interior receptors that would allow Matt to connect to any computer. Matt’s brain was his cock (or was his cock his brain) and was now the centre of his being, sending more waves of pleasure as it compartmentalized into his new drives and oscillators. His almost fully-formed memory chip was rocked with an alien human pleasure as his hard plastic former torso began to pull his cock inside his torso, morphing the hard blue plastic as Matt’s former penis slid inside of it. Robert watched through Matt’s transparent blue torso as the metalicizing and flattening shaft slid up and up and up, until it stopped with just Matt’s former cockhead sticking out of his torso. It made one more squishing sound as it condensed into metal, and fully opened up into a hard rectangular shape. Robert watched as tiny visible ridges finished forming inside the former cockhead. The USB drive shivered once more as the flat nipples, pecs and abs rose slightly against the hard blue transparent plastic, then separated from it entirely. They were now on the surface of a sticker casing that wrapped around the blue case of the USB drive. On the other side of the sticker, tiny letters rose up. Matt’s name appeared, written in a slanted tech company logo font, with smaller letters, reading “VERSION 2.3 500 GB USB DRIVE.”<br />
<br />
The USB drive lay on the cold coffee table counter, the last of its body heat leaving it. Suddenly, the electric touch of giant fingers gripped it, and it was soaring through the air, completely unaware of where it was headed. The movement slowed, and suddenly its cockhead was being pushed into what felt like a vagina or asshole. Matt was being plugged in to Robert’s computer. All of his receptors and jacks began to send waves of pleasure to his memory chip. There was a pause, and then Matt began to process millions of waves of information, his entire body warning up as he enjoyed the feeling. His memory chip began to fill up with the new financial reports for Robert’s hedge fund, but it felt to Matt like he was simultaneously being fucked, fucking and sucking a cock. The very human feelings of pleasure contrasted with the indescribable feelings of information processing and data storage. The data filled him like a cock filled his human asshole, and when he was full, strong fingers gripped his plastic torso and pulled him out. He was flying through the air and then was falling. He landed inside a dark space with cool paper on both sides. The light disappeared, and Matt was alone in this alien environment. The paper began to collapse over him, but since he was made of hard plastic, it didn’t hurt. He waited.<br />
<br />
Robert scribbled Gary’s address on the envelope, then placed it in a small shipping box with a ore-written note, explaining the nature of his birthday gift to his business partner. Gary was also gay, and would find a big surprise when he finished transferring the financial statements to his laptop. The young man had been very cute, just Gary’s type. The financial statements would certainly be needed for Gary’s presentation to the shareholders on Monday, and once the young man changed back, Gary would have a companion for the long weekend.</p>
