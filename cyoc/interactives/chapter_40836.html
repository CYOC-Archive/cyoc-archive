<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Katy opened the door back to the pool area, she saw Cal and Mark standing close together. &quot;Come on in&quot;, she asked. The two just stood there. Katy sighed and walked over to the two naked 'ladies'. Katy held up the bag, &quot;I got the clubbing clothes here, didn't you hear me?&quot; When Mark moved and Cal whimpered softly, she put the bag beside them and said, &quot;When you two untie from each other, bring the bag in so we can change.&quot; Mark and Cal just looked at Katy, not saying anything and Katy turned and walked back into the house.<br />
<br />
Mark smiled, &quot;If you stop squeezing my knot, I might be able to slide out of you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cal shook his head, &quot;Not unless I get the dildo for the club.&quot;<br />
<br />
The two saw Katy looking at them from the other side of the glass door. Mark grabbed Cal's hips and pushed hard, slowly sliding his engorged knot from Cal's vagina, his scream of pain growing louder the longer he pushes. Mark stops pushing, his cock throbbing in pain and his knot as big as ever, and Mark grunted &quot;Fine. I just won't wear the collar.&quot; After a couple of minutes, Mark slid out of Cal painlessly. Cal grabbed the bag while Mark picked up their wet swimsuits and went to join Katy.<br />
<br />
After changing and looking in the full length mirror in the bedroom they were using, all three were in awe of how the clothes clung to their forms. &quot;I'd fuck all three of us.&quot; said Mark, trying not to drool. Katy, now wearing the collar, &quot;Let's fuck now.&quot; Both Cal and Mark nixed that. &quot;We should leave soon before we can't control ourselves again.&quot;<br />
<br />
Once at the club, the three split up, having agreed to some time apart. Cal was at home, enjoying the festive party atmosphere. The three re-united after last call for drinks as the club was closing, the clock said it was almost 4am. Cal and Katy looked almost the same as when they walked in. Mark, was suffering from having his clothes not in the right place, his silver tube bra twisted and his shorts riding up, leaving a clear outline of his canine vulva bulging, and the his cock pushing the front of his shorts out like a tent, and he was staggering...clearly drunk. Katy and Cal helped Mark to the car, with Cal getting in the back seat with Mark. Katy drove home, helping to get Mark in the house, and close to a bathroom, he was sound asleep in the large shower. Cal brought Mark a large blanket and fell asleep in the shower stall with Mark. Katy took off the collar, having enjoyed the night of frequent sex, and fell asleep in her own bed.<br />
<br />
Mark woke up, hung over, and vomiting. Cal was glad he was in a shower stall. Both Cal and Katy were up before Mark, having made breakfast,counted the remaining money from last night, and both Cal and Katy took turns with a human Buster, who was still walking around with Katy. Cal told Mark that his mom called. Cal told Mark, &quot;Your hungover dude, rest and dry out, we can spend tonight at your house.&quot;<br />
Mark was still not with it, and fell back asleep. After lunch, Mark woke up with Buster and Katy having sex in the bathroom where Mark was. Katy yelled, &quot;Mark's awake again&quot;. Mark noticed Katy's cock was tied in Buster's human ass, and his own arousal started to grow his cock. Cal came in, and got the blanket from the shower stall, &quot;If you can stand, take a shower&quot; Cal told a naked Mark. Mark didn't notice he was naked, and grabbed for a bra that wasn't there. &quot;I took care of our clothes&quot; Cal told Mark. Mark nodded to Cal, and started the water to clean himself. He also masturbated to Buster and Katy, who were still playing on the bathroom floor.<br />
<br />
Mark toweled off after his shower and wondered into the kitchen, where he found Cal, &quot;Hungry?&quot; asked Cal. Mark shook his head. Cal handed Mark a plastic cup of coffee, &quot;Here you go. I have a whole pot&quot; declared Cal. Mark eagerly downed cup after cup until Cal had to make another pot.<br />
<br />
Mark laughed, &quot;I don't remember much. That was wild.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cal grinned, &quot;You were something of an item last night.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mark put up his hand in a 'stop' motion, &quot;It's better you don't tell me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cal added, &quot;I told your mom we would be at your house for supper. I'll bring the stuff.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mark thought, and groggily spoke, &quot;I would like to leave my family out of it. I need to look like me before we go. You can stay as you are.&quot;<br />
<br />
The rest of the afternoon, Buster got quite a workout between Katy and Cal. Buster seemed to be getting tired when he would fall asleep while his knot was buried in either Cal or Katy. Having enough fun, Buster was restored and allowed to rest. Mark restored the upper part of his body, he liked the bottom half too much to change.<br />
<br />
As Mark and Cal were preparing to leave, Katy handed Cal a few hundred dollars and the collar. &quot;Where's the dildo?&quot; Katy asked Cal.<br />
<br />
Cal smiled, &quot;I got it earlier.&quot; <br />
<br />
Katy reached down and felt the dildo through the shiny spandex shorts Cal was wearing. &quot;If it were not for the large t-shirt you were wearing, I'd swear you were a slut.&quot; remarked Katy.<br />
<br />
Cal quickly responded, &quot;Only to Mark and Buster.&quot; Cal beamed a proud smile to Katy.<br />
<br />
After Cal pulled into Mark's driveway, the realization hit Mark, how will he explain the girl who is Cal? A now nervous Mark tells Cal, &quot;If my mom asks, your name is Kay.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure&quot; nods a calm Kay.<br />
<br />
After walking in, Mark's mom was all over this new girl and very curious about her life, where they met, and why Cal didn't come over.<br />
<br />
Mark's mom said, &quot;Your father will be home tomorrow. You should bring your little friend here over tomorrow night to meet him.&quot; Mark shook his head, knowing if his mom knew it was Cal, her reaction would be very different. After dinner and helping to clean the dishes, Kay got a strong dose of Mark's mom that he never got before as normal Cal. Kay was having enough of this. As Mark's mom sat down to watch her shows, Mark told his mom the were going to his room.<br />
<br />
Once inside Mark's room, Kay let Mark have it. &quot;What in the hell is wrong with your mother? I can't believe treated me the way she did.&quot; grumbled a very unhappy Kay.<br />
<br />
Mark sighed, &quot;Sorry dude, my mom is like that when I bring girls over. That is why only two have ever been here. She thinks I spend too much time playing video games. My dad is worse.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine, I need relief.&quot; declares Kay as she strips down to nothing. Mark follows suit. Soon, Kay was smiling, her knot buried deep inside Mark's ass. &quot;Thanks dude. I needed that.&quot; Kay said, savoring her orgasm throbbing from her tightly squeezed shaft. Kay continued softly, &quot;I'm ready to party tonight with you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mark's mom smiled in her bedroom, imagining what her son and the new girl were doing to each other.</p>
