<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Kathleen drove, Jeff watched out the window at the extent of his changes. Everywhere they passed, he noticed how men were all wearing bottoms that either showed off their legs, or were tight to their skin. And just like himself, many were carrying around purses or hand bags, as none of their outfits had pockets anymore. Many guys wore heels, or sandals, and it was beyond rare to see a<br />
Guy without cleanly shaved legs. <br />
<br />
On the other hand, it was the polar opposite for women. Many wore jeans, though not skinny jeans, and none of them wore heels. In fact, it was eithet shoes, sneakers, sandals, or the occasional work boots for them all. And while some were carrying bags or purses, they clearly were only doing so as a show of politeness for the man whom they were accompanying. <br />
<br />
Another thing Jeff realized after some time, was that men now were on average, about 4-6 inches shorter than their female counterparts, and additionally, were much thinner and dainty. In other words, it seemed that men had the more feminine figure now. He figured that this likely was due to men now having ovaries, and women now having testicles. It didn&#39;t explain everything, like why women always had breasts, while only some men did, or why some men even had breasts to begin with. But Jeff figured that was all thanks to the program maintaining a pretty clear gender distinction between the upper and lower bodies. <br />
<br />
Jeff&#39;s pussy was twitching with excitement at the thought of the new human anatomy he created. It was such a turn on now that he almost couldn&#39;t contain himself. He wondered if pronouns changed as well, or if there were some new logic behind gender distinction. <br />
<br />
Looking down at himself, Jeff blushed seeing his naturally crossed hairless legs and cute high heeled feet the skirt was also growing quickly on him, and just the thought of being a woman from the waist down was making him super wet. He looked out the window to try and distract himself, but then felt a gentle hand grab onto his left thigh as Kathleen parked the car. Jeff looked over and his jaw dropped when he saw the large penis poking out from Kathleen&#39;s pants. <br />
<br />
Kathleen smiled and pushed her seat back invitingly, and Jeff couldn&#39;t refuse. He crawled over the center console and straddled his girlfriend, who helped him remove the rather sexy pair of string panties that he only now realized he was wearing.<br />
<br />
But Jeff didn&#39;t linger on that thought as Kathleen used one hand to dug around his purse, pulling out one of the condoms that she knew he was keeping inside it. Jeff&#39;s eyes widened when Kathleen slid it on her cock, finally realizing that this was actually happening for real. But as shocked as he was, he couldn&#39;t resist lowering himself down onto her cock. <br />
<br />
He felt his lips part, as her shaft slowly filled his insides. It felt incredible, and any thought of stopping vanished as Jeff felt Kathleen grab onto his wide hips and ass as she helped lower him down onto her. Jeff felt her balls contact his ass as he removed her pants for her, and was then lifted up by her. <br />
<br />
Jeff placed his hands on her shoulders and they both worked together to bounce him up and down on her cock. As they increased speed, Jeff began moaning in time with his movements as Kathleen fucked him. He arched his back, pushing Kathleen down into the seat as they carried on, with Jeff feeling better and better with every second. <br />
<br />
Finally after about 2 minutes of this, Jeff climaxed, clamping down on Kathleen&#39;s cock as he came, moaning and panting as Kathleen also finished. Jeff could feel her spraying her load inside of him, though he knew she was wearing protection. Despite that however, the <br />
nuanced feeling of her cumming inside of him made him cum once more. <br />
<br />
Kathleen the surprised Jeff by giving his ass cheeks a not so gental squeeze, causing Jeff to clamp down once again. He wasn&#39;t ready to feel good by having his ass cheeks groped, but here he was, once trying to lock down on Kathleen softening rod to no avail as it finally slipped out from his soaking wet folds.<br />
<br />
Jeff quivered a bit as Kathleen gave her cock one final pump, causing it to flick against Jeff&#39;s pussy before it finally went fully flaccid. Jeff leaned over and kissed Kathleen, still panting tiredly, though thoroughly satisfied with what just happened. <br />
<br />
Jeff wasn&#39;t sure what came over him all of a sudden, but he slipped down off of Kathleen and squeezed himself down between her legs. He took her flaccid cock into his mouth, and cleaned off every inch of it, making sure to clean off her balls as well, before he poured the contents of the condom into his mouth and swallowed. Kathleen just watched in surprised as Jeff had never done this before. <br />
<br />
When Jeff finished, he looked up at her shocked, grinning face and was a little embarrassed. &quot;W-what?&quot; He asked, turning a bit red because of her stare. &quot;Dibs,&quot; was all Kathleen could say. <br />
<br />
&quot;What the fuck? Dibs?&quot; Asked a confused Jeff as he crawled back into the passenger seat. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yep, I&#39;m calling dibs on you. You are mine now.&quot; She declared.<br />
<br />
Jeff started to laugh. &quot;What the hell, haha. Was I not yours already? I clearly remember you telling my sister that you were taking your bitch, in other words, me, out for a walk. Or am I no longer your bitch?&quot; teased Jeff.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ungh, damn that&#39;s hot. You should call yourself my bitch more often,&quot; replied Kathleen, who then gave Jeff a kiss on his forehead, as while she loved him, she didn&#39;t want to kiss a mouth that just eagerly devoured her own cum. <br />
<br />
The two then left the car, with Jeff almost forgetting to put his panties back on, and headed inside to start on their date. Neither of them had realized it that Jeff&#39;s top now had a slight V-neck shape to it, displaying the top of his still quite small B cup breasts. Nor how his straight hair now reached down to just an inch below his chin and had a rather feminine looking style. </p>
