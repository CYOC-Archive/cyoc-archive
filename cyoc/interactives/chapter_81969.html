<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You awoke to the familiar sensation of your boyfriend's morning wood pressing up against your back, but with the equally unfamiliar sensation of your own erect cock rubbing against the sheets.  You turn your yes once more to the mirror, stunned by what you see looking back at you.  For a moment you could have almost imagined it was a dream, but a light touch on the hard cock between your legs, and the shiver it sends up your spine is enough to disabuse you of that particular notion.  You slide your way out from under the limp arm of your boyfriend, causing him to stir slightly and roll over in his sleep.  You run your eyes slowly over his nude form as he lays there atop the covers.<br />
<br />
He really is quite a catch.  His lean athletic body with its light coating of body hair is a pleasure to just stare at.  And you're amazed he feels the same affection to you now as an effeminate man as he did when you were a woman.  You lean over the side of the bed and pick up your jeans, sliding the small flashlight out from the pocket.  True, you do like him this way, but what's the harm in a little play, and you can fix it later.<br />
<br />
You adjust the light to a medium-high blue setting and point the light directly at his cock.  Carefully as not to shine the light on anything other than his manhood, you switch on the light, bathing his shaft in bright blue light.  The hair around the base of his shaft noticeably thickens into a dense curly bush.  The light amount of hair over his balls increases as well, giving them a furry coat.  The sac itself begins to swell as well, the skin stretching out to make way for his increasingly large testicles, growing to half again their previous size, looking like a pair of hairy chicken eggs.  His already hard shaft stretches longer, the veins along its length pulsing as his cock suddenly gains about two inches of girth.  Three more inches stretch out along the length of his shaft, curling the plump head of his cock back up towards his navel.<br />
<br />
Switching off the light, you admire the thick ten-inch shaft your boyfriend was now sporting.  Too bad he would simply think he was always that well hung, never knowing you were the one that prompted the growth instead of his own genetics.  You let your eyes wander over him again, wondering what else you could do to him, your eyes coming to rest on his face.  You know that he has always wanted to grow out his beard.  He's tried a few times with less than impressive results, usually ending up with something slightly sparse and scraggily.  His family just didn't seem to be the type prone to thick facial hair.  Well, you could certainly fix that now, couldn't you?<br />
<br />
Leaving the light on its medium-high setting, you run the blue glow slowly along the lower half of his face, carefully avoiding going too low on his neck or too high on his cheeks in an effort to keep the beard contained.  As soon as the blue light passes, his chin, jaw and upper-lip darken noticeably, the slight stubble of light brown beard pushing past his skin.  His chin starts to broaden, his jaw shifting shape slightly, becoming squarer and more defined.  You didn't even think of that part, but it certainly does give him a more rugged, masculine appearance.  His stubble keeps growing in as he continues to develop a strong lantern jaw.  His beard grows out from five o'clock shadow, right past morning stubble, past two-day stubble right on into a short trimmed beard that his some of the sharpness of his jaw, but also seemed to make him appear a few years older than his 21.<br />
<br />
You notice from the corner of your eye the picture he keeps of you and him on his nightstand.  No longer is he clean shaven in that picture, but is sporting a good amount of stubble with thick sideburns.  As far as the world is concerned, he's had a scruffy face from shortly after puberty hit him.  You reach out and run your hand along his jaw, feeling the coarse hair rasp across your palm.  The contact makes his eyes flutter open, his lips curling into a small smile as he sees you.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mornin', babe.&quot;  Even his voice seems a touch deeper and raspier.<br />
<br />
You respond by kissing him slowly, feeling his rough beard tickle against your smooth face.  He pulls you atop him, his long thick shaft nestled against your ass, making your semi-erect cock once more spring to full attention.<br />
<br />
Your mind wanders for a moment back to the flashlight, wondering just how much it changes the world around you.  &quot;Answer me a question?  You only dated girls before me, right?  So why change?&quot;<br />
<br />
He laughs, a deep rumbling in his chest.  &quot;Yeah, but why ask now?  Wanted a change, wanted to try something different.&quot;  He doesn't even seem confused, he provides the answer without hesitation.  His hand wanders up your stomach to your chest, his fingers running across your nipples again in his typical foreplay action.  You even feel a small rivulet of pre leaking from his cock and sliding down between your ass cheeks.  You can't help but wonder if you could get away with making a few changes to him even as he's getting ready for a repeat of last night.<br />
<br />
You distract him with a slow kiss, using your hands to dial the light back a little bit to just above medium.  With the flashlight still hidden in your hand, you shine the light in a quick sweep across his chest and stomach.  His eyes glance down at his chest, his face confused for a moment as if he saw something.  But it seems he soon forgets as he gets right back into the pace of things.  His pectorals and abs plump up slightly, gaining a bit more definition and more tone.  His treasure trail thickens below his navel, and spreads up past it, towards his light dusting of chest hair.  Though its soon moving past light dusting, spreading across his pectorals, slightly thicker in the middle and around his nipples.<br />
<br />
You run your fingers through his shaggier chest hair, which doesn't slow his play with your own chest one bit, acting as if you've played with his chest fur a dozen times before, which in this new reality you may have.  Perhaps a few more adjustments are in order..</p>
