<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;So, you see, this programme I was sent, it makes changes to people, to the world around them,&quot; Patrick explained as he let his friend in, and seeing she didn&#39;t believe him, he sighed, &quot;It&#39;s the truth. You might not believe it, but at one time I wore glasses.&quot;<br />
<br />
A sceptical look on her face, and as she kicked off her shoes, Tammy commented, &quot;You&#39;re right, I don&#39;t believe you, especially when you say you used to wear glasses,&quot; and following her friend upstairs to his room, she listened as he filled her in on how you could set such parameters like the alterations to be permanent, only you being aware, even a time limit.<br />
<br />
Never before had Patrick ever teased her about her situation, but as she listened to him, she couldn&#39;t help but wonder if he was having a go at her. Trying to tell herself he wouldn&#39;t, he accepted her for who she was, she thought of her own parents, who only grudgingly went so far to acknowledge who she was, but still insisted on calling her Justin when she was at home, using male pronouns to describe her, and demanding she dress and act like a boy when they went to church.<br />
<br />
&quot;Give them the chance, they&#39;d probably even deny me from seeing my doctors,&quot; she thought waspishly as she recalled the fight they&#39;d had a few years back when, having had enough, she flat out refused to go to church with them, which had led to her refusing to do almost anything with her parents.<br />
<br />
Patrick, who taken a seat at his desk, cut into her thoughts by saying, &quot;So, you see, I don&#39;t know what I ought to change about myself, beyond what I already have. But then I thought about you, and how you might want to use it,&quot; and turning her attention to her best friend, still finding the notion of a computer programme capable of not only transforming a person, but also changing reality highly unlikely, Tammy watched as he woke up the computer. Stepping closer, thinking about the one thing she wanted more than anything in life, and how she would never truly get it, she couldn&#39;t help herself as she asked herself, &quot;So how does this work.&quot;<br />
<br />
New memories telling him enough to know he&#39;d hooked her, Patrick explained, &quot;First you need to let it scan you so you can have a profile,&quot; and wheeling his desk chair out of the way, he instructed her where to stand and what button to click.<br />
<br />
Still leery, Tammy stood where she’d been told to. Reaching out, she moved the mouse, tapped the icon she&#39;d been directed to, and standing straight, she waited a moment. When Patrick informed her it was done, she peered at the screen, and was surprised to see a detailed layout of herself present. Moving the pointer on the mouse, she clicked on a few things, brought up menus, saw things she kept secret from everyone, including her best friend, and listened in a distracted way as Patrick said, &quot;You probably want to secure your profile and make sure none can access in but you.&quot;<br />
<br />
With a distracted nod, Tammy did this, then looked over at Patrick. Whispering, &quot;You&#39;re not pulling my leg, are you? This thing can do like you said.&quot;<br />
<br />
A smile crossed his face, and Patrick invited, &quot;Why don&#39;t you try something out?&quot;<br />
<br />
Unsure what, Tammy almost asked what he recommended, but, at the last minute, turned her focus completely to the Chronivac. Scrolling through the options, noticing some happened to be greyed out and she couldn&#39;t access them, she decided after some time to try a small experiment. Navigating to the section about her breasts, she clicked and from the drop-down menu, switched them from pitiful A cup with a need for an insert and padding to fill them out, to a firm, rounded B cup, with no insert of padding needed. Exploring the other options, she lowered her androgens, upped her female hormones, made it so she didn&#39;t need pills, clicked on the option to make both herself and Patrick aware of the changes, set the discomfort as low as it could go, and making it so it would be permanent, she clicked on the options to save and apply the new details.<br />
<br />
Exactly what she expected to happen, Tammy wasn&#39;t prepared when, without warning, her bra began to grow tight. Gasping, she fumbled for a moment before getting a hand up and under her shirt. Taking out the inserts she had in, she thought this would offer her some relief, but was disappointed when, instead of relief, she was overcome with the worse horniness she&#39;d ever experienced. Embarrassed when her tiny penis grew erect, she backed away from the desk. Her male junk rubbing pleasurably against the soft, cotton gusset of her underwear, she dropped the inserts on Patrick&#39;s bed, and feeling as if she was about to explode, she tore out of the room, down the hall and into the bathroom.<br />
<br />
Patrick, taken aback by all this, looked at the things she&#39;d tossed on his bed. Tempted to look and see what it was Tammy had altered, he instead stood and followed after her, stopping a few steps from the room she&#39;d ducked into. Inside the bathroom, Tammy had just barely enough time to get her pants unbuttoned and pushed down. Hating the sight of the bulge in her underwear her penis was causing, she gasped, stumbled forward, and gripped the sink to keep herself from falling over. The erotic lust she was experiencing growing, she tried to spread her legs and squat down, but her pants making it difficult for her to do so, she used a trembling hand to roll down her panties.<br />
<br />
Her tiny penis exposed, she hated herself for what she was about to as she waddled the few steps over toward the toilet. Taking a wad of toilet paper, she proceeded to use her other hand to rub her erect shaft until, with a gasp and a sigh of relief, she blew her load into the toilet paper. Embarrassed, disliking what she&#39;d done, she tossed the toilet paper into the toilet. Using some more, she cleaned herself up a bit more, threw it also in with the rest and flushed. Turning away from the toilet, she awkwardly bent over and looked under the sink until she located the wipes Patrick&#39;s mother kept there. Taking a couple, she used them to finishing cleaning herself up. Tossed the used ones in the trash, she tucked her cock and balls back between her legs, pulled up her underwear and pants, made sure she was presentable, put away the wipes, then turned toward the sink.<br />
<br />
As she ran the water, then lathered her hands with soap, Tammy&#39;s eyes drifted to her reflection. Looking at her chest, she turned one way, then the other. Unsure if anything had changed, she finished, dried her hands on the towel hung next to the sink, and before she could change her mind, she proceeded to shuck off her shirt, then her bra.<br />
<br />
Nude from the waist up, she stared at her exposed breasts.  Seeing the way they now looked, recalling how they&#39;d been when she&#39;d put on the bra hours earlier, Tammy was stunned by the sight of the two B cup breasts she now had. Touching them, cupping them, jiggling them, doing everything she could to imprint on herself they were real, she soon put back on her bra. Liking how her appearance now looked, how she had a decent cleavage, she turned one way, then another as she posed before pulling back on her shirt. Convinced now what she’d been had told her was the truth, she cast one last glance at her reflection before opening the door. Seeing Patrick was waiting some ways down the hall, Tammy took a deep breath and stepping toward him, she said, &quot;Okay, you&#39;ve convinced me.&quot;</p>
