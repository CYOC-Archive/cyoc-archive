<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Matty was vigorously jacking off when John came in his room. The young man his brother had become and he had seen on screen was now in front of him with a huge erection covered in fluids and moaning like in a porn movie. The noise Matty that was making was getting louder and louder. John knew he had to stop him somehow but before he can do anything, Matty reached his climax and shot a huge load of cum directly to John&#39;s face.<br />
<br />
Almost immediately, he fainted and fell to the ground with a big thud. John saw his brother&#39;s body deflating like a balloon until he became an innocent child again. There was any trace of the hunky guy except for the insane amount of sticky goo in John&#39;s skin. He sighed in relief, it seems that Matty was now deep sleeping and it won&#39;t be hard to convince him it was all a dream. As a kid, it was easy to put him on his bed and covered his nude body with briefs and pajamas.<br />
<br />
After taking off any evidence of what happened, John carefully left Matty&#39;s room and returned to his own. It was pretty late, so he immediately returned to his bed despite he can&#39;t take out of his mind the unbelievable thing that he had just watched. He was getting new ideas of how to get fun of his new toy and who will be his new star. Matty was a good candidate, but John wanted to take a time before he tried it again on his little brother.<br />
<br />
The next morning was awfully normal for John. At least, he was glad Matty didn&#39;t suspect anything except for his missing pajamas that got tattered and John hid in his room. They took breakfast and went to their respective school. Before they leave, John noticed that his little brother was scratching his little thingy more frequently that he had done it before. Maybe it was a side effect, but John didn&#39;t give it too much importance.<br />
<br />
In school, John meet his friends talking and he joined the conversation. They talked for a while about videogames and movies before classes started. During his first period, History, John sat behind his friend Kyle who was more focused than him on what the teacher was saying. Curiously, when John glanced at his friend for an instant, he noticed that Kyle quickly scratched his crotch and he remembered that Matty did it as well during breakfast.<br />
<br />
It was unlikely that the same thing had happened to Kyle, but it gave John an idea of who will be his next target. Kyle was a good choice because despite he was a few years older than Matty he wasn&#39;t too much developed in comparison. John had seen him in the lockers after PE and he didn&#39;t look particularly big or strong. He wasn&#39;t a tall guy either and his body hair was almost non-existent except for a few hairs on his pits and maybe on his crotch. Being a blonde guy didn&#39;t help him to make it more notorious.<br />
<br />
When classes where over and John returned to his home, he noticed that Matty was already in there and eating a snack. It wasn&#39;t too weird, except for how Matty was dressed. Practically nothing but his briefs. It wasn&#39;t normal that Matty do that and John wondered if it was another side effect of the transformation. He watched his brother going to the living room and turning on the tv before he left to his room. He turned on his PC and run the BIG Baskin software.<br />
<br />
The last time he used on his brother, he had set it on random, but in order to transform Kyle he had to go to advance options. First, he entered his target&#39;s name and after a few seconds s long list of guys with the same name appeared on screen. He reduced the options by entering Kyle&#39;s address giving him way more less options. He picked his friends name and a new window popped in with Kyle&#39;s information, weight, height, skin and hair color, etc. John was surprised that it also had so many specific info like his dick&#39;s girth and shoe size. Above these data there was Kyle&#39;s age and a kind of meter.<br />
<br />
When John moved it, Kyle age changed along with it stats, John can&#39;t believe it, this thing has information from the future and knew exactly how Kyle will look during his whole lifetime. John was a little curious if it knows when he will die but he was afraid of looking at it. Returning to Kyle, he set the meter on 20 and he noticed that Kyle&#39;s stats didn&#39;t change too much, so he kept moving forward until he sets Kyle&#39;s age on 30. Definitely there was a change, but it didn&#39;t look as drastic as he had watched on his little brother. Being a little bit disappointed of it, John picked Kyle&#39;s dick&#39;s length which had barely increased two inches from 3 to 5, and wrote a 1 before the five and turning into a 15.<br />
<br />
John realized that he can changed more than just Kyle&#39;s age and began to play with his friends data, making sure his small and puny friend will turn into a behemoth of a man. When he was done he saved the changes and closed the window. However, he didn&#39;t know that by doing that he had started the transformation on his friend. He was astounded of watching a new window popped in with a camera sight of Kyle&#39;s bathroom. John was desperately trying to turn it off, he didn&#39;t want it happens immediately, but it was too late. The software was already working.</p>
