<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was a warm, sunny day in July, and out in the suburbs sat a little girl. She had a curly Afro, dark ebony skin, and an adorable round face. She had a pink bow in her hair, a long pair of overalls and a pink shirt beneath. Currently, she was currently playing with dolls, happily enjoying the summer day.<br />
<br />
One doll was a cartoon dog of some kind, while the other was a Ken doll. She was happily speaking for them, enjoying her day in the sun. <br />
&quot;Ha, thank you Dylan.&quot; She said with the dog towards the Ken, unaware the random boy named she picked was once hers... or rather his before reality was altered. &quot;I think this tastes great.&quot; She added before making the toy fake drink something.<br />
However, her joy turned to confusion when a large shadow began to cover her. She scowled, looked up, and began to smile.<br />
&quot;Hi Emilia!&quot; She squealed in delight.<br />
<br />
Standing over her was her big sister, Emilia, who had just walked up to her with a large suitcase in one hand and a backpack slung over one shoulder being held up by the other. She was wearing a tank top, and a dark black bra barely visible through the tank top, being pushed out by her large breasts. Her hair was in dreadlocks, but looked like they needed to be re-knotted, and had no makeup. She wore jeans, but they were somewhat tight on her, as she seemed to have recently gained a little weight.<br />
&quot;Hey Dana, so good to see you.&quot; She greeted with a meek smile.<br />
<br />
Emilia had had a rough few years. She graduated from university with a degree in mathematics, putting it to good use by becoming an accountant. She had moved in with her boyfriend, Charlie, but after a few years, the two had started to grow apart. This culminated in the two deciding on taking a break, leaving Emilia with little choice but to move in with her mother again, at least temporarily.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mommy will be so happy to see you!&quot; Dana laughed before she hopped up, then ran inside, leaving Emilia to herself.<br />
<br />
The woman sighed, then clenched her luggage, frustrated that, at 26, she&#39;d have to move back in with her mother and step-father. She would&#39;ve moved in with her real dad, but he was living too far from her current job, and she couldn&#39;t afford to lose that. After slowly crossing the lawn, she entered the house, yelling out to anyone nearby.<br />
&quot;Hey, I&#39;m here!&quot; She called out. &quot;Momma? You home?&quot;<br />
<br />
They did, in fact, hear this, but it wasn&#39;t good news for all.<br />
<br />
There on the foot of the master bedroom sat Rachael, dressed only in an oversized bathrobe, her ginger hair tied with a scrunchie into a messy bun. Her tiny hands covered her mouth as she glared across the room.<br />
&quot;Olivia.&quot; She whispered with a hiss. &quot;I thought Emilia was coming home TOMORROW.&quot; The woman said with some panic.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, really? Did I say that, sugar?&quot; Olivia asked with a chuckle. She didn&#39;t even turn back, as she was too busy checking her satin bra on her D-cups, turning back and forth to see how she looked in the large mirror. &quot;I coulda swore I said today.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You did this on purpose!&quot; She said in a louder whisper. &quot;Liv please baby I thought we talked about this! I can&#39;t see her yet, what would she say?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;d just tell her hon.&quot; Olivia laughed as she searched for a top.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, oh the truth.&quot; Rachael scoffed. &quot;Ha, um, hey Em! Long time no see! So anyway, I&#39;m in a polyamorous relationship with your mother and step-father! How&#39;s work?&quot; She hissed sarcastically.<br />
<br />
&quot;See you&#39;re a natural.&quot; Olivia said with a smile, only turning briefly to kiss her on the cheek.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ugh, I can&#39;t deal with this right now.&quot; Rachael whined as she walked for the bathroom, only stopping as a large, naked black man walked out of there, scratching his beard.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey baby.&quot; He laughed, giving her a kiss on the lips that she reluctantly accepted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello... can you PLEASE tell your wife that I&#39;m not ready to tell Emilia about all this yet?&quot; She asked with a pout.<br />
<br />
&quot;Woah now, that&#39;s soon to be OUR wife? When were you thinking of telling her anyway? At the wedding?&quot; He laughed.<br />
<br />
Rachael&#39;s pale face flushed with even more color as she stormed off, mumbling something as she kicked Tyrone from the bathroom. He chuckled, then walked over to Olivia. Wrapping his large, strong arms around her, he held her close and gave her a kiss.<br />
&quot;God, can&#39;t wait to marry that beauty.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know sugar me too.&quot; Olivia sighed. &quot;I do feel bad for putting her in this spot though.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She&#39;ll get over it... tell you what, let&#39;s surprise her with a ginger lover&#39;s night? You get the strap on and we&#39;ll make sure she&#39;s feeling both holes filled.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oooo baby you so naughty, she&#39;s gonna go wild.&quot; Olivia laughed.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Rachael stared at herself in the mirror, sighing. She tried dating men AND women for years, but none of them felt right. For some reason, right here, with this family, THAT felt right. She couldn&#39;t know that her own self-conscious kept her close, and that the real reason she loved this family so was currently downstairs, and it was what was worrying her.<br />
<br />
After getting dressed, applying makeup and doing her hair, she walked out to see Olivia and Tyrone gone, though there was a strap-on sitting on the bed with a note that read &quot;See you later&quot; on it. She blushed, smiled, then walked downstairs to find it busy. Dana was sitting on the floor, playing with some barbie dolls. Meanwhile, Tyrone sat on the couch, drinking from a red solo cup. Olivia was chatting nearby, talking with Emilia, when she spotted Rachael and gestured her to head over.<br />
<br />
Rachael started to walk over, but was so nervous she let her fat left tit bump slightly into a wardrobe. She held in her pained yelp, and had to focus instead on something that was falling from the wardrobe. It was some old camera, covered in dust from years of lying there, untouched. <br />
&quot;Oh no no no!&quot; She called out, trying to catch it, but only managing to throw it into the air.<br />
<br />
Emilia gasped. &quot;Auntie Rachael, look out!&quot; She called as everyone looked up at the camera.<br />
<br />
Everyone turned to see the device fly into the air, and begin to descend. It was about to fall onto it&#39;s top, and potentially transform all of reality yet again with a FLASH.<br />
<br />
That&#39;s when...</p>
