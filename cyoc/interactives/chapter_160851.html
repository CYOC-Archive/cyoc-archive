<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Not wanting to give up such a perfect worry free life Mike decided to make his time traveling regression indefinite by not selecting a duration at all. The thought of being never having to grow up brought the biggest smile to his face.<br />
<br />
Sticking his thumb in his mouth Mike began toddling about his nursery of a room and inspecting. There was everything he needed dresser, crib, changing table and toy chest. Peeking in the small closet he found a vacuum cleaner and a econ box of the old fashion brand of Pampers. He smirked at the image of the happy baby on the side of the box feeling the same to be dressed in on of the garments. His exploration came to an end as that point the door to the room opened and in stepped a younger version of his mother.<br />
<br />
&quot;There you are Mikey, I&#39;ve been looking everywhere for you little rascal&quot; she said with a warm maternal smile.<br />
<br />
Upon seeing her Mike made a beeline for her, waddling over as quickly as he could and hugging her leg.<br />
<br />
Laughing at his cute display of affection his mother picked him up and held him in her arms, &quot;How about you come play where mommy and daddy are. Doesn&#39;t that sound fun?&quot; she cooed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Pway&quot; Mike babbled after pulling his thumb from his mouth, too shy to say more than that one word.<br />
<br />
It did the trick however as his mother&#39;s smile widened, &quot;Ah but first does somebody need to be changed? Let me see&quot; she said not really expecting her little boy to answer. Rather then remove his overalls she lifted the young toddler up and gave both his crotch and backside a tentative sniff pressing her nose against the fabric of the denim. Meanwhile Mike felt on top of the world at the diaper check, the invasion of privacy making him feel excited rather than uncomfortable.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nope, all clean&quot; his mother announced before carrying him out of the nursery and down the hallway. She then took him into the living room where his father was seated on the couch watching TV. His old man, who like his mother was also young now acknowledged him with a smile as they entered and said, &quot;Ah, there&#39;s my boy!&quot;<br />
<br />
His mom then set him down in a large playpen set up in the corner of the room. As soon as his feet touched the ground he toddled to the edge and grabbed it with his hands looking out at the large room he was now cut off from. He did this for a moment before taking notice of the various toys within the pen and started to play with them.<br />
<br />
After a half hour though the thing Mike had wanted to happen the most finally did. It just occurred without warning, one moment his diaper was dry and the next it was rapidly growing warm and wet as he emptied his bladder uncontrollably. The moment he realized he was peeing he rolled onto his back so as to better enjoy his accident. When he finished Mike was disappointed that his accident was over. However that sadness quickly turned to joy as he felt something else happening on the other end.<br />
<br />
Grunting quietly he unconsciously pushed out two fairly big large turds, effectively loading the seat of his diaper with a decent amount of poo. The back of his padding now bulging a little Mike rolled back onto his front. Now feeling like he was on cloud nine after pooping his pants he returned to playing with his toys, now being mindful to not sit on his rear.<br />
<br />
Mike could have made a fuss or announced to his parents that he now needed to be changed but thought it&#39;d be more fun for them to find out from the smell. Plus he really wanted to stay in his dirty diaper for a while longer.<br />
<br />
Turns out it only took about 10 minutes for the smell to escape and reach his father&#39;s nose.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hon, Mikey needs a fresh diaper&quot; he called out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Could you do it? I&#39;m busy in the kitchen came his mother&#39;s response.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine&quot; his dad replied as he got up from his seat on the couch and approached the playpen, &quot;Hey there Mikey. Did you make a boom boom?&quot; he asked in a friendly tone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Boom boom&quot; Mike repeated not even bothering to hide his grin.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s what I thought&quot; his father said with a half frown, &quot;Come on then&quot; he said lifting his son up and carrying him to the couch where he was made to stand up as his dad took off his overalls, &quot;Don&#39;t know why your mother puts you in these when your home. Makes it harder to change you&quot; he grumbled.<br />
<br />
Once it was off Mike was able to get his first look at his diaper, which at the moment had a large yellow stain on the front. Before he could make anymore observations his father laid him down on his back while pulling a bag out from somewhere. Sucking his thumb Mike watched with undivided attention as the tapes were ripped free and the garment opened up. A giggle escaped his lips when he saw the face his dad made upon seeing his mess.<br />
<br />
With a quick lift of his both his legs by his ankles he dragged the soiled diaper off to the side, allowing him a view of the number two he had made. The sight renewed his excited as to what was currently happening to him, Mike wriggling and squirming around in delight.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mikey please stay still so daddy can finish changing you&quot; his father begged while still holding his son&#39;s ankles.<br />
<br />
Even though that statement only excited him further Mike granted his dad&#39;s request and forced himself to calm down. Though it was especially difficult as he could see him reaching for the baby wipes out of the corner of his eye. The second the moist wipes made contact with his bottom Mike could only describe as pure heaven.<br />
<br />
While he was in the middle of being wiped down...</p>
