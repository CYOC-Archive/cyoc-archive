<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Nick walked across the college campus. He was coming from one of his late night classes and trying to get back to the dorm. He just wanted to nuke some noodles, curl up in front of his laptop and stream some mindless television. It had been a hell of a week. At 5&#39;6&quot; Nick wasn&#39;t the most impressive guy on campus. His build was lanky, and his brown hair was in a style most people would call a messy mop.<br />
<br />
The campus was mostly quiet this time of night, except for what was coming up. Nick steeled himself. He hated this part of his walk back to his dorm. He had to go right by one of the frat houses, and on Friday nights the place was usually hosting a party of one sort or another. This particular frat also housed some of the most straight, homophobic jocks on campus. And Nick was.. well he wasn&#39;t open about it, but he wasn&#39;t closeted either. Sometimes he could get by without issue, sometimes he had to deal with some bullshit going by.<br />
<br />
He considered cutting around the house, but that would take longer and he just wanted to get home. With a sigh he decided just to risk it and tried to briskly walk by the frat house. Almost everyone was inside, just a few hanging out out front, maybe he&#39;d be lucky today.<br />
<br />
&quot;Little Nicky!&quot; Nick winced. He knew that voice. Jason Maxwell. Hockey player, douchebag, and the bane of Nick&#39;s existence since middle school. He was usually the one to get the others on his case. It was hard when your school bully followed you even to college. Nick looked over to where Jason sat in the front yard, drinking beer with his pals.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just keep walking.&quot; Nick muttered to himself. But Jason was quick despite his size and was soon in Nick&#39;s path. A 6&#39;2&quot; wall of blond muscle that wasn&#39;t going to just let him go. &quot;Jason.&quot; Nick said, trying to keep his voice even.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just going to walk by and not say hello?&quot; Jason slurred his words slightly, though the hand he put on Nick&#39;s shoulder was firm. &quot;You know, not enough girls showed up to this party. We might need a little cocksucker like you to liven things up.&quot; Jason&#39;s breath smelled heavily of beer and other stronger liquors.<br />
<br />
&quot;Leave the guy alone, Jason.&quot; Came a voice Nick didn&#39;t recognize. The guy looked a little older than college age, mid-twenties maybe. With olive skin and black hair that was slicked back. He was as tall as Jason, but far leaner. Still he didn&#39;t seem intimidated by the hockey jock when he stepped up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck off, Anthony. Nicky and me, we&#39;re old friends.&quot; The others in the front yard slinked inside like they didn&#39;t want to get caught in this, leaving just the three of them on the poorly lit sidewalk. Nick felt another hand on his shoulder, Anthony&#39;s, but this one was reassuring and strangely warm.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jason. You&#39;re a dick. I was going to do something about you myself, but I think Nick here should have the honors.&quot; Anthony beamed at Jason and Nick just shrunk in on himself.<br />
<br />
&quot;The fuck you talking abo..&quot; Jason didn&#39;t have a chance to finish the words. Anthony&#39;s hand moved to Nick&#39;s back and shoved him forwards right into Jason. They didn&#39;t collide, no, he was shoved INTO Jason. As he got close his body turned to mist and sank into the jock. Nick stumbled backwards a step or two, suddenly feeling heavier than he was used to, taller too. He was looking at Anthony now and blinked a few times.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wha..?&quot; Nick blinked, his voice was deep and sounded kind of like Jason&#39;s? &quot;What did you do?&quot;<br />
<br />
Anthony shrugged. &quot;Made you possess the dumb jock. His body is yours now, as long as you want it. I was going to do it myself to teach him a lesson, but this seems more appropriate.&quot; The man took a swig from his beer and eyed Nick up and down.<br />
<br />
Nick patted at himself, felt at his meaty pecs, his thick arms and then down between his legs with a start. Jason had always been gifted down there. &quot;How...?&quot;<br />
<br />
Anthony sighed. &quot;Uhg, I forgot I&#39;d have to mentor you if I did this.&quot; The man rubbed the back of his neck as if this was going to be a pain in the ass but finally sighed. &quot;Follow me.&quot; He started walking towards the frat house, stopping to stoop over and pick up a backpack and a pile of clothes sitting on the sidewalk. It was what Nick had been wearing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait! I can&#39;t go in there.&quot; Nick took a couple of steps back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Um, you can. You&#39;re Jason Maxwell, that&#39;s where you live.&quot; Anthony smiled and motioned for Jason to follow. &quot;Trust me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nick sighed and headed after Anthony. A few people did call out to him as he stepped inside, well, they called out for Jason. He just waved and followed Anthony up the stairs and into an empty bedroom before closing the door. There was hockey gear piled in one corner, posters of scantily clad women all over one of the walls, and an odor that Nick could only describe as musky. &quot;This is Jason&#39;s room?&quot;<br />
<br />
Anthony nodded and sat on the desk chair, dropping Nick&#39;s clothes and backpack on an empty spot on the pretty messy floor. &quot;Your room for now. Sit.&quot; Anthony motioned to the bed. &quot;I&#39;m going to make this lesson quick and dirty. I&#39;m a possessor. I have the ability to possess people and now you do, too. You can stay in that body, or move to another one, your choice, but I think you should learn your new powers in that body.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You can just give people this power?&quot; Nick asked as he sat down, the bed was messy and the sheets needed to be washed.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can. You&#39;ll probably be able to eventually, too, in a few decades. I&#39;ve been doing this hundreds of years, it&#39;s easy for me. You&#39;ll need to learn how to use your powers. Like building muscle. You&#39;re going to be weak to start, but you have a few things you can probably do now. Speed and power will come with practice.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Powers?&quot; Nick was still dazed just being in this body. He had powers.<br />
<br />
&quot;See. This is why I don&#39;t make new ones. I hate teaching and now I have to keep an eye on you, too. Oh well, I was intending to stick around a while anyway. Yes, powers. Taking over someone else&#39;s body and mind is the obvious one. You have his body, now focus. You should feel a little bundle of thoughts and emotions. Those are his. You can read his memories and everything.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nick did focus on that, prodding the bundle lightly. It was annoyed, angry, and horny. He pushed a little harder. Memories of Jason&#39;s night started to come to him, then more. He could focus on certain events he figured, looking for times Jason bullied him and remembered them from Jason&#39;s side. He shook his head to clear the thoughts. &quot;He&#39;s going to kick my ass if I ever leave.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He won&#39;t know. The weird stuff like our conversation here and you taking his body will be blurry. He&#39;ll remember normal things you did, but as himself doing them. It&#39;s really convenient, actually. The other part is you can influence his personality and body while you&#39;re in there. And I don&#39;t just mean going on a calorie binge and quitting exercising to make him gain weight. Though that is fun as a petty revenge. And they&#39;ll keep doing it once you&#39;re out, not knowing why.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nick gave Anthony an odd look. &quot;Right. Anything you do while you&#39;re in there, they think they&#39;re doing. You can change habits, thoughts, personality quirks. I was going to possess him and go on a homoerotic binge, watching gay pornos and doing any guys I could get my hands on. By the time I left he&#39;d be craving those things and continue. Same as the binging cupcakes, it&#39;s a new habit you gave them. They might eventually break it, but the ones we leave are pretty strong.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So. I can just turn him gay, just like that?&quot; Nick asked, still prodding at Jason&#39;s body. He lifted up the shirt and got a look at his toned abs, a short layer of trimmed hair going up the middle.<br />
<br />
&quot;The more you do it the easier it will be. I could do it in a day or two, for you it might be a week or more, but you&#39;ll get him there. You can also do the same physically, start pushing their bodies. Nothing drastic, you can&#39;t make him a woman, or shrink his height, but, here let me show you.&quot; Anthony closed his eyes, his clothes started getting tight as some more muscle grew on his frame. His face darkened as his clean jaw sprouted stubble and then grew a beard. &quot;Ahg, that itches.&quot; He scratched at his chin. &quot;For you, that trick will take days.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I could grow a beard in days anyway.&quot; Nick said as he concentrated, fingers on his jaw, it did feel a little stubbly.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;ll grow faster at least. Be careful how much you change though, people will notice. Next. We ourselves don&#39;t age while possessing a body. If we leave it, we start aging like normal, but most of use just hop from one body to the next. I wasn&#39;t kidding when I said I&#39;ve been doing this for centuries. Don&#39;t push to hard, you have all the time in the world. Even if your host dies you&#39;ll just end up ejected and can take a new body.&quot; Anthony grinned. &quot;Finally, you&#39;ll always know when your around another of us. There&#39;s no obvious sign, you just kind of know. And you can&#39;t take a body that&#39;s already possessed, but we can swap if so inclined. Got it?&quot;<br />
<br />
Nick just sort of nodded, dumbfounded. He&#39;d be thinking this guy completely insane if he wasn&#39;t sitting in Jason&#39;s room, in Jason&#39;s body. &quot;So, just, do what I want in his body until I get bored of it?&quot; He took his shirt off and tossed it aside. Like his stomach, Jason&#39;s chest was covered in trimmed blond hair.<br />
<br />
&quot;Pretty much. I like to find assholes and teach them a little humility, some of us just bounce around having fun, others like to find those who need help and give them a push in the right direction. Do what suits your fancy.&quot; Anthony was smiling as he watch Nick explore Jason&#39;s body, then grinned even more when Nick dropped those jeans and gripped Jason&#39;s thick cock in his hand.<br />
<br />
When Nick was younger and first realizing his sexuality he had fantasized about this cock. Dreamed of turning Jason into his gay fuck buddy. A little prod of Jason&#39;s memories and he dug out a bottle of lube he kept in his nightstand, he held it out to Anthony. &quot;Do you want to do the honors?&quot;<br />
<br />
Anthony grinned. He stood and stripped down, the added muscle and beard making him look a little older. He wasn&#39;t as hung as Jason, but he had a decent tool between his legs, one that was going to stretch out Jason&#39;s virgin hole. &quot;Thought you&#39;d never ask.&quot; Nick bent over and presented his ass to Anthony, grinning as he felt a few lubed up fingers enter him. He was already forming a plan to get back at Jason</p>
