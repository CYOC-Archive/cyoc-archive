<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Sometime later, James stood in front of an unassuming apartment building as the sun moving towards sunset. He&#39;d made it here, unchanged. Now all he had to do was get inside, get to his apartment and things would be fine. Well, not exactly but he&#39;d be safe from the curse for at least a little while.<br />
<br />
He made his way inside, thankful that he still had his keys after his recent changes. James walked past the empty security desk, happy to see that the usual guard off somewhere else. But in his eagerness to get out of the lobby quickly, he opted to take the elevator instead of the stairs. This would prove to be his undoing, as he might&#39;ve avoided the encounter with one of his neighbors.<br />
<br />
=====<br />
<br />
Meanwhile elsewhere in the building, one of James&#39;s other neighbors, a short and somewhat mannish lesbian named Sarah was about to indulge in her guilty pleasure. Dressed casually in a wife-beater and a pair of cargo shorts, she lounged on her recliner and pulled out her smartphone, flicking open her Instagram app. The short lesbian scrolled through the various collections she had of lovely ladies of all varieties. Whether they were queer or straight, she had an real appreciation for the female form.<br />
<br />
One of her favorites was the model Jae Bang. Something about her was irresistible to Sarah, even if she was supposedly best friends with that homophobic actress Jessica Bling. But that didn&#39;t mean Jae was a hatter too, or so she hoped. And to her delight, there was a new video from the Asian bombshell, which she clicked on immediately.<br />
<br />
In the video, Jae was walking in a parking garage and speaking into her phone. Her dazzling smile was framed by dar crimson lips, and her light green eyeshadow matched her jade earrings perfectly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, &#39;sup to all my followers! Just wanted to make a quick thank you! We did it! Thirty million of you are following me now!&quot;<br />
<br />
Sarah almost blushed a little but what came out of her favorite&#39;s mouth next crashed that feeling right quick.<br />
<br />
&quot;Howevah&#39; if any of you queer bitches are listening, you should know that all of this beauty is for the men! You ain&#39;t evah gonna get to touch this! Bang OUT!&quot;<br />
<br />
The lesbian was in shock. Had she&#39;d just heard right? Was Jae really another homophobe? She numbly clicked over to a picture of the model from the very first beach shoot, which had been Sarah&#39;s go-to image for getting off. A bit of the old lust welled up but it now seemed to be muted. She chalked it up to shock, but in truth, the &#39;were-breeder&#39; curse was about to claim another victim...<br />
<br />
=====<br />
<br />
Back in the elevator, James unfortunately found himself standing next to an devilishly attractive man in business attire. The man&#39;s suit clung tightly to him, revealing a well built body beneath. The attempts at small talk went nowhere, as James was doing his best to try and ignore his attraction to the man. However, he was ultimately betrayed by his own body, with the uncontrolled rising of his dick. Thankfully, the other man got off the elevator just before the first wave of changes hit James&#39; body. <br />
<br />
All of his muscles started to ache as he staggered to one side, and he felt that now familiar sense of swelling. James leaned against the wall of the elevator as his arms and legs gained the mass of a regular gym goer. This was followed by the chiseling of a six-pack across his abdomen, which was joined his pectorals surging outward to pull his shirt tight.<br />
<br />
And speaking of his clothes, their alterations began with the Vans on his feet, which had burst through them with a growth spurt. But now, the material was darkening and gaining a sheen in the process. Soon enough, his size 12&#39;s were encased in a pair of bespoke leather shoes, polished to a mirror shine. The black leaped from the leather onto his white socks, and shifted them from cotton to silk. <br />
<br />
As the socks rose up, the cargo shorts James was wearing started to descend in a swirl of threads. Some of the pockets sealed up while others shifted to other locations. Pretty soon, the tan color had given way to deep blue, crisp creases snapped into place down the legs of the new trousers. A black leather belt slithered around his waist and connected with a large buckle plate that had the image of a bull on it.  His wallet, now in his right front pocket, grew wider and thicker as it now had to accommodate his new top-of-the-line smartphone and the various credit cards he now possessed.<br />
<br />
James clutched his head with his hands, struggling against the new persona starting to form in his mind. Images of a life of wealth and plenty bombarded him.  Furthermore, he could feel himself losing ground to its aggressively hetero nature, as images of sexy women climbing in and out of his bed flooded his brain. His dick rose in response, gaining quite a bit length and girth in process. After all, how else was he going to please the ladies night after night, if his cock wasn&#39;t a piledriver? <br />
<br />
Amid this struggle, James&#39;s shirt had been pulled tighter, but soon it was gaining more layers. One of them became a well-pressed sky blue dress shirt with a wide and very starched collar. Another became a clean wife-beater that tucked itself into the boxers his briefs had become. Finally, the last layer extended outward to become a deep blue blazer that matched his trousers. It was tailored to fit his new body. A maroon silk tie slid down and tied itself perfectly.<br />
<br />
Another wave of memories washed over an increasingly weakening James, this time of a certain woman. His lusty feelings seemed to grow stronger as she faded into view crushing any attachments he had to his old sexuality. As he began to outgrow his playboy ways, and slipped into something much more monogamous, the new man could feel that his inner hate switch had flipped from hetero to homo. It is amazing what a good woman can do for a man. <br />
<br />
Now the changes began to affect his head. His hair grew darker, shifting to black as unseen hands slicked it back with hair gel. His chin widened while a perfect goatee grew in. His blue eyes were swallowed up in brown as his teeth straightened and whitened themselves. The cocky attitude of a man of wealth and influence settled upon him, any remaining traces of his gayness drowning in a morass of hyper-heterosexuality and arrogance.<br />
<br />
Stopping to check his face in the metal doors of the elevator, Jimmy winked at his reflection. He was handsome and damned if he didn&#39;t know it. He then looked down at the gold-plated watch that wrapped itself around his wrist, and realized that he still had a little time before his date was ready. A fleeting thought of how he knew that vanished as he turned to admire his good looks again...<br />
<br />
=====<br />
<br />
Still in her seat, the first signs of Sarah&#39;s transformation into a new woman began to show. Her short and somewhat stumpy legs grew longer and toned, causing her to kick off the sandals she&#39;d been wearing. Any hair that had been on them disappear with the wave of tanned skin that flowed up from her now petite and manicured feet As the tan reached them, her thighs grew thicker and started to split the seams of her shorts. This shredding of clothes was aided by the sudden swell of her buttocks, as fat and muscle caused her cheeks to round out several inches into a nice shelf. <br />
<br />
Adjusting her position, Sarah was surprised to find she&#39;d been clicking through a series of pictures of men in various states of undress. The disgust she&#39;d expected didn&#39;t come, instead she felt a sudden attraction to them. A bit confused by these new...hetero leanings, she didn&#39;t notice that her always trimmed fingernails had grown out and gained a layer of deep purple polish. Likewise, she failed to see that her somewhat mannish hands had slenderized to become way more feminine as she felt compelled to click on more images of men. <br />
<br />
Another wave of tanned skin flowed down from her hands, transforming her arms as it did. The flab that existed on them was replaced with toned muscle. At the same time, there came changes to her torso, beginning with her back. With a series of loud pops, Sarah&#39;s spine both lengthened and curved inwards, giving her increased height while also causing her already ample ass to jutt out even more. Her wife-beater, meanwhile, was being assaulted on two fronts. A sudden surge from her breasts pushed it tight, and as it stained to contain the two orbs of tit flesh, it pulled up to reveal that her stomach had become much more taut. The muscles contracted into a feminine equivalent of a six pack, even as her sides curved in to emphasize her womanly features. <br />
<br />
Now came the changes to the strained and shredded clothing. The remains of her shorts started to knit themselves back together, the khaki giving way to a deep purple as a new skirt formed around her ass and thighs. The wife-beater twisted and warped to become a bra made of black lace that perfectly held her ample bust. Nearby, just within reach, a lovely silken blouse that matched her skirt materialized.<br />
<br />
Unseen to her, the app opened had switched to a dating one. Her lovely fingers flicked from man to man to man. She now seemed to be looking for someone, as his face came into view deep in her still turbulent mind. A small voice questioned why she was so interested in a guy, but it quickly was silenced by a swell of lust as Sarah found him!<br />
<br />
The smile at the sight of her Jimmy brought a smile to her lips with their boysenberry lipstick. The rest of her makeup quickly covered her face, and in the process altered it. High cheekbones were now prominent as the fat in her chin wicked away until it was perfectly tapered. Blemishes vanished under foundation, as her nose shrank down. The eyeshadow that matched her lipstick only emphasized the green eyes she now had. <br />
<br />
As her hair began to gain volume and pulled itself up into a dark mass of curls, Sarah reached for her blouse and pulled it on. With each button she closed, bits of jewelry appears. Earrings in each ear, a few gold bracelets on her wrists and some rings on her fingers. Her hands reached up to pull down a few of those perfect coils of hair just as someone rang her bell. In that moment, she knew it was Jimmy, just he knew that his beloved Sienna was ready for him. She stepped into her heels, that may have once been sandals before moving towards the front door. Opening, the now fully heterosexual woman almost leapt into her man&#39;s arms.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, baby. I missed you~&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Same, sugar. Are you ready to have some fun tonight?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Always, lover. Always~&quot;<br />
<br />
And with that another &#39;were-breeder&#39; couple was stepping out into the world, unknowingly spreading the curse to any of the homosexuals they both despised now....</p>
