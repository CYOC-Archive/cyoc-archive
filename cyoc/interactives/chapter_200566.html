<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It had been an hour or two since Rei and Nat had been left with Kari, Aaron, and Haley who were being very good with them. Since the last time they had babysat for them, the three had gotten excited to see them. Although Nat didn&#39;t like to use her vampire powers often, she used them when playing with the children like giving them piggy back rides. Rei also found that Kari wanted to learn a little Russian from her that her father had taught her. Soon, the kids were making some drawings in front of the TV while Rei and Nat watched a movie they all could watch together.<br />
<br />
&quot;So....I heard that Gloria and her friends are going to prom tonight.&quot; Nat said to Rei.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I can&#39;t wait for our prom night.&quot; Rei said as Nat blushed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you...do you think I&#39;ll be a very pretty senior when I grow up?&quot; Nat asked as her face turned a deep red.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nat, you&#39;ll be very krasivaya.&quot; Rei complimented.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I love it when you compliment me in Russian.&quot; Nat said as she almost kissed Rei when there was a knock at the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Weird, I wasn&#39;t expecting anyone, were you?&quot; Rei asked as Nat shook her head.<br />
<br />
Rei and Nat headed towards the door and opened to fine two older, yet very beautiful women on the other side of the door. The two of them had never seen these women before in their lives.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can we help you?&quot; Rei asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello girls, we&#39;re friends of the Harris&#39;s. They called us and asked to have a get together with some of our own kids and asked us to come over and pick up the kids.&quot; The younger of the two women explained.<br />
<br />
&quot;Funny, they didn&#39;t call us first.&quot; Nat said thinking this was pretty suspicious.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, that&#39;s because we only live a couple of houses down and they knew we&#39;d get here faster than they could get back.&quot; The slightly older one said as she looked at Rei almost intensely.<br />
<br />
&quot;Believe us girls, we&#39;re just being good neighbors.&quot; The younger woman said as Nat looked at Rei.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah Rei, they&#39;re only being good neighbors. It wouldn&#39;t hurt to just invite them in, would it?&quot; Rei asked her friend as Nat looked carefully at Rei&#39;s eyes to see them dilated a little. <br />
<br />
Nat immediately slammed the door on the women and locked it behind them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Rei, go get the kids and take them into the other room.&quot; Nat said worryingly as Rei snapped out of what seemed like a daze.<br />
<br />
Nat watched as Rei took the kids into the next room and made sure they were out of the way before Nat put a chain on the door and then opened it again to see the women looking a bit irritated but still smiled through their teeth.<br />
<br />
&quot;That was quite rude young lady, you shouldn&#39;t slam the door on some good neighbors.&quot; The older woman said to Nat.<br />
<br />
&quot;Really? What kind of neighbor is that? The one that needs to be invited in? The one that can make humans susceptible to requests? Or the ones that are vampires?&quot; Nat asked as the women&#39;s faces now turned to scowls.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shit. Force it open, damn it!&quot; The younger woman said to the older one as Nat slammed the door shut and locked it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nat! Can&#39;t you do something?!&quot; Rei asked worryingly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Against them? I&#39;ve barely fought in my life. I can&#39;t go up against them.&quot; Nat said trying not to panic as the kids looked like they were about to cry.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve got to make a quick phone call.&quot; Nat said as she pressed a number on the phone. &quot;Mom, I&#39;m at the Harris house, where Rei and I are babysitting. But we&#39;ve got a Code: Fang! I swear to god mom I&#39;m not making this up, it&#39;s a Code Fang!&quot; Nat said into the phone as she hung up and then waited.<br />
<br />
&quot;YOU! OPEN! THIS! DAMN! DOOR! You filthy little brat, when we get in there I&#39;m going to...&quot; Nat could hear one of the women say from the other side before she stopped and she could hear them talking with someone. Nat then heard voices from outside and what sounded like a fight going on. It continued for a few more minutes before Nat couldn&#39;t hear anything. <br />
<br />
Nat then heard a knock on the door in code and knocked back in code as the other side made a third coded knock before Nat opened the door to see a very tall, beautiful woman in front of her, her mother.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom!&quot; Nat said as she ran into her mother&#39;s arms as she gave her daughter a hug.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you okay? Did you get hurt? Is Nat okay? They didn&#39;t get a hold of the children, did they?&quot; Nat&#39;s mother asked worriedly.<br />
<br />
&quot;No mom, we&#39;re all fine. But they wanted to take the children with them.&quot; Nat&#39;s mother looked at the children who all still had worried looks about them. Nat came over to them while holding her mom&#39;s hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;Kari, Aaron, Haley, it&#39;s okay. This is my mommy, she&#39;s a vampire, but she&#39;s a good vampire, she&#39;s also a good mom.&quot; Nat introduced her mother as the children started to look less worried.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s nice to meet you children. You don&#39;t have to worry about me, I only hurt bad vampires, like the two ladies outside.&quot;  Nat&#39;s mother, Marissa told the children.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mrs. MacGregor, I think these kids and their parents are in trouble, we have to help them.&quot; Rei said as Mrs. MacGregor shook her head.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, we get these children back to their parents, I&#39;m taking you home Rei, and Nat, we&#39;re going back home.&quot; Mrs. MacGregor said.<br />
<br />
&quot;But Mom....&quot; Nat began to argue before her mother cut her off.<br />
<br />
&quot;No buts Natalia Belova MacGregor, we&#39;re...&quot; Mrs. MacGregor was about to say something when little Kari wrapped herself around Mrs. MacGregor&#39;s legs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Miss Nat&#39;s mommy, please help my mommies and my other friends, we&#39;re all magic and those bad ladies want to hurt us. Please Miss Nat&#39;s mommy, don&#39;t let our mommies get hurt.&quot; Kari asked trying not to cry.<br />
<br />
&quot;Her mommies are magic?&quot; Mrs. MacGregor asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, these kids are kitsune kids, kind of, and their mom&#39;s and some of their friends can do magic.&quot; Nat replied.<br />
<br />
Mrs. MacGregor took a deep breath and exhaled.<br />
<br />
&quot;We help these kids out while we can and then we head back home.&quot; Mrs. MacGregor said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom...there&#39;s something else. These kids have an aunt who&#39;s a friend of another damphir.&quot; Nat explained.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s good Nat, I&#39;m sure they&#39;re a good person.&quot; Mrs. MacGregor said as she began leading the kids out of the house.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mrs. MacGregor, his dad might have been behind this. He&#39;s like the big bad of vampires.&quot; Rei said to Mrs. MacGregor who was making sure the kids were dressed alright before they left.<br />
<br />
&quot;Any bad vampire is just a vampire looking for attention.&quot; Mrs. MacGregor said shrugging it off.<br />
<br />
&quot;He&#39;s the son of Miro Tepes.&quot; Nat finally said making Mrs. MacGregor snap to attention and looked at her daughter who was deadly serious.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tepes, Vampires sent to collect children....Nat, this little one said she had other little friends with magic?&quot; Mrs. MacGregor asked worriedly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah they do.&quot; Nat answered as Mrs. MacGregor when out to where the two vampire women were trying to pull themselves back together after getting part of their legs and arms torn off so they couldn&#39;t run away.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello young lady. I&#39;m a mother, a vampire, and someone who doesn&#39;t like to see children hurt. Now you&#39;re going to tell me what I want to know, or I&#39;ll show you how bad brain damage can be.&quot; Mrs. MacGregor threatened.</p>
