<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">David hadn&#39;t meant to be late for Mr. Edgar&#39;s class, in fact he usually made sure he was on time. There had been a fight in the halls which blocked his way to the room, he had only hopped he wasn&#39;t the only one slowed down by it. Security had broken up the fight and David finally got to class.<br />
<br />
He looked around the room in confusion. The class was completely empty, no students or teacher. There were some abandoned notebooks on the desks suggesting that people had been in the class before. Nothing was on the teachers desk though and David looked around for something on the board or something to tell him if they went into a different room or something but he saw nothing.<br />
<br />
He walked over to Mr. Edger&#39;s desk to look for a note or something but nothing, it was like he just didn&#39;t show up and so the class just got up a left. He had a passing thought that he was surprised those punks even showed up briefly but he shook his had. He didn&#39;t really have any trouble makers in his class did he?<br />
<br />
Just then he heard something behind him. He turned around a saw some dumb looking skater kid standing behind him, the dude looked about David&#39;s age. David jumped in surprise.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh damn, sorry I didn&#39;t hear you come in&quot; David said not recognizing the guy. <br />
<br />
The boy stood there grinning at him, he was dressed very casual in a hoody with a t-shirt under and a pair of baggy jeans, a pair of big DC shoes, and a backwards cap on his head. <br />
<br />
&quot;No problem bro, I&#39;m sneaky like that&quot; he said with a chuckle. &quot;So this your class?&quot; He asked.<br />
<br />
David looked at him with confusion. &quot;Yeah or at least it&#39;s supposed to be, I don&#39;t know where everyone else is&quot; he said shrugging &quot;what are you doing in here, are you in this class too?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yeah sorry, I&#39;m Dennis&quot; the guy said patting David on the shoulder &quot;and yeah I am, in a way&quot; he said. <br />
<br />
David was confused he knew for sure he hadn&#39;t seen this guy before. &quot;What do you mean in a way?&quot; He asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I was kinda...filling in for the old teach&quot; Dennis said and David have him a look. &quot;Everyone agreed the class was boring and left&quot; Dennis shrugged. &quot;Because I mean seriously do you think school is worth it?&quot; He asked David.<br />
<br />
That caught David off guard, of course school was important, and yet he had a strange urge to agree. He felt himself shaking his head &quot;No it&#39;s not really&quot; he said hardly able to believe what he was saying. Dennis put his arm around David&#39;s shoulders <br />
<br />
&quot;I mean what&#39;s the point in trying so hard if your not gonna be yourself anymore, just doing what other people want&quot; Dennis explained and once again David felt like agreeing, something was wrong here but he couldn&#39;t really think of what. <br />
<br />
&quot;The others realized how stupid it was and left, sorry you were late but I can teach you to be awesome like I taught them&quot; he said smiling, seeming genuine. <br />
<br />
David found himself thinking about just how right this guy was as he felt this rebellious drive stirring inside him. He couldn&#39;t explain it other than he was starting to feel like he cared less about what happened to the class. Maybe feeling slightly relieved that no one was there. <br />
<br />
He suddenly remembered that pretty much the whole class was punks who just didn&#39;t care but that didn&#39;t matter cause that was normal, so was he right? <br />
<br />
David didn&#39;t notice as he was starting to get slightly more muscular, getting leaner as he developed a 6 pack and an impressive set of pecs. His feet started to grow larger as his shoes morphed into a pair of Osiris skate shoes. His dark hair started to grow longer and messier like he just didn&#39;t care, and streaks of it dyed itself electric blue. A small sized gage piercing appeared in both ears and his body began to get covered in tattoos. He had some on his arms and legs as his jeans turned into a pair of cargo shorts and his shirt became a plain black v-neck t-shirt. A black beanie formed over his hair, sure the school had rules against hats but who cares what they approve of. <br />
<br />
David barely noticed these changes because as they were happening a voice in his head kept telling him it was right, it was normal, there was nothing out of the ordinary. He suddenly had a slight goatee and grinned as he stroked it a bit. <br />
<br />
He looked around at the class room &quot;man fuck this place, I want a smoke and school is just too dumb to waste my time&quot; the new David said as he fist bumped Dennis and walked out grabbing his board knowing exactly where his classmates went.<br />
<br />
&quot;You belong to yourself now dude&quot; Dennis said even though he knew David couldn&#39;t hear him. Dennis then saw a nerdy looking student hurrying to class carrying a bunch of books and grinned &quot;there&#39;s a lot of work to do at this fuckin&#39; school&quot; Dennis remarked as he left the class.</p>
