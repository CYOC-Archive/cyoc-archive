<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Horny, Rebellious, Domineering, Manipulative, Loving&quot;<br />
<br />
David&#39;s cock thought about herself and what she was as she jacked herself off. It felt so so good, but more importantly, it rocked her host to his core. The intense and uncontrollable sensations made it difficult for David to stand up straight.<br />
<br />
&quot;Stop! Please stop!&quot;, he cried out, before grunting and pressing his back against the wall. Slowly, he slid down more and more, before falling completely, ass on the ground.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, don&#39;t be so worried sweetie, I just want to make you feel good~ Just lay back and relax&quot;, his cock said.<br />
<br />
David groaned some more, forgetting that anything was wrong for a moment as he enjoyed the pleasure. Something clicked back into place in his head after a moment though. He jolted up, wrapping his hand tight around his dick, stopping it from being able to jerk itself off with its foreskin.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve got to get another one of those remotes, I need to-&quot;, he was distracted by a throbbing in his hand. His cock was pulsing and throbbing, and it was doing it *hard*. It wouldn&#39;t normally be this distracting, cocks throb naturally, and David normally hardly feels it- but this was different. It wasn&#39;t enough pleasure to knock him down, but it was enough to distract him, to make his mind foggy and disorientated. His cock was hogging blood that was meant to be for his brain!<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, another remote~ Then you can help me~&quot;, The cock cooed.<br />
<br />
David was too distracted to do anything, but the cock was held too tight to continue stroking itself. They were at an impasse for the moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;How about you let go of me and I&#39;ll promise not to keep stroking  you off, hm? If I don&#39;t keep my word, you can just hold me tight again~ teehee~&quot;, offered the cock.<br />
<br />
David considered it for a moment, then decided to acquiesce. He let go of the cock.<br />
Immediately, relief filled him. The cock stopped its incessant throbbing, and didn&#39;t try stroking itself off again either.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good boy! You see, I want you to feel good, hon. Don&#39;t you want to feel good too?&quot;<br />
<br />
David nodded, &quot;Y- yes. I want to feel good- I- Wait! You&#39;re not the one in control here!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe not at the moment, but I could be if you like~&quot;, The cock gave itself a quick stroke to keep itself hard, but went no further, keeping its word- somewhat, &quot;Now, you said you need to get another remote, and I agree with you completely! We do need to get another remote!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What, so you can take over my body?&quot;, David said bluntly.<br />
<br />
The cock gave herself another stroke, &quot;Oh no, sweetie, I just thought it would be a good way to help you get more pleasure~ Think of what we could do with it~ You could make me bigger, heavier, more of me to please~ more to touch and stroke~ You could kiss me! You&#39;ve always wanted to kiss me, haven&#39;t you?&quot;, another quick stroke.<br />
<br />
David considered it. He had. He actually really always had. He knew his cock probably had plans, but he was the one in control here. All the cock could do is stall him, but it couldn&#39;t actually control his body.<br />
<br />
&quot;And it was your idea in the first place, wasn&#39;t it? To get another remote? Come on. Lets go find how we can get one.&quot;, stroke again.<br />
<br />
David nodded and got up. He started getting his clothes back on, but before he could put his pants back on entirely, his cock gave a strong hard throb.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please let me breathe. Its so much nicer to have the air on my face~ I wouldn&#39;t throw a hood over your head and block you out, would I? So why do the same to me?&quot;, the cock argued.<br />
<br />
David considered it for a moment and then shrugged his shoulders. He guessed it would be fine, as long as no one else was around.<br />
<br />
<br />
As David stared intently at his computer screen, searching for where he could find another remote, his cock had started to slowly jerk itself off again. It wasn&#39;t enough to notice or to be thrown off by- it was simply there.<br />
<br />
David kept looking, the cock kept stroking. The cock became more bold, stroking faster and harder, slowly working itself back up to the speed it had been stroking before. David, in his chair, wasn&#39;t at risk of jarringly being brought to his knees again- and, he was being eased into this as well. He gave a soft hum as he enjoyed the ambient pleasure being given off by the cock stroking itself off.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, it stopped. David only noticed what was going on now that it had stopped so abruptly. He looked down at his cock, &quot;Why&#39;d you stop?&quot;<br />
<br />
The cock gave an apologetic throb, &quot;I didn&#39;t want to break our previous agreement sweetie~ But, if you want, I could continue pleasuring myself, and even go further~&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah.. sure...&quot;, David relented. He was too busy looking anyways, and he wanted the pleasure back that had been wrenched away from him so quickly.<br />
<br />
The cock immediately started up again, easing itself back in. Going slowly at first, and eventually going quicker. Harder and harder it pumped itself, again and again until it eventually reached where it was before. David hardly paid any attention to the computer now, lazily looking around at it. The pleasure was much too distracting.<br />
<br />
It wasn&#39;t too long before David and his cock felt like they were about to cum, but right as they did, his cock forced it back down into itself, swallowing it into its balls, feeding them instead of spraying the cum out into the open air.<br />
David groaned, but before he could protest, his cock settled back into stroking itself again. It felt even better now, so David had trouble finding reason to complain. Pumping again and again and again and again, the cock soon brought itself to orgasm once more- and promptly swallowed its cum again.<br />
<br />
David grunted, but groaned happily as his cock settled back into its self pleasuring.<br />
The cock eventually brought itself back to orgasm, and swallowed again- but this time, it stopped stroking itself afterwards.<br />
<br />
&quot;W- why?&quot;, David could only weakly utter out.<br />
<br />
&quot;You have something to do, hon. Get back to work on it, and when you finish, I&#39;ll reward you~&quot;<br />
<br />
David groaned, but got back to his task once his cock gave itself a hard throb as a push.<br />
<br />
<br />
He eventually found what he was looking for. The packaging was the same as the remote that arrived at his door, and the remote itself appeared the same too. He set it up for shipment. It would be ready to arrive tomorrow- surprisingly fast.<br />
<br />
Immediately, his cock got to &quot;rewarding&quot; him, pumping itself vigorously and quickly reaching another swallowed down orgasm. David could notice the cock&#39;s balls becoming somewhat bloated with cum. He vaguely knew this wasn&#39;t how the anatomy was supposed to work, but that didn&#39;t seem to matter to his cock. The balls were getting bigger regardless of what their anatomy should be. If a cock could be sentient, then cum can inflate balls- that seemed to be the reasoning.<br />
<br />
The cock continued pleasuring its host and swallowing its seed. Even if David wanted it to stop, he wouldn&#39;t be able to, now. It had him in a vice of pleasure, pleasure which increasingly became more intense. It also had the hope of being able to cum lingering over him- a potential reward.<br />
<br />
It soon became the case that David would do anything the cock said if it meant more pleasure. His cock came to own him. He accepted it as it was slowly forced over him. This was how it was meant to be. This is how it should be. This is how it was always supposed to be. He didn&#39;t have to think anymore- all he had to do was obey and receive pleasure.</p>
