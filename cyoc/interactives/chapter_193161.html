<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Sam had to admit to her pervy reptilian self that her friend’s total helplessness and state of near constant orgasm was deeply attractive. She had been on the deer’s side of things before, completely at the whim of whoever was altering her body and features, and being the one in control of absolutely everything was intoxicating.<br />
<br />
The iguana let an aroused smirk cross her jaws. Slightly playful. Slightly sinister. Her lizard brained dominancy was starting to assert itself, though Sam herself was quite meek in general. She had her long time crush exactly where she wanted her, reduced to a plaything to control, and she had all the control in the palm of her hand. She glanced over at the clock on the night stand. 12:45. The night was still young.<br />
<br />
The deer, despite her state of panting cum spattered exhaustion, was still rational enough to see the way her best friend was leering down at her. It was an ominous stomach sinking look.<br />
<br />
“Samantha...” Brooke managed, in a warning tone, mustering as much severity as she could with her comical high pitched voice. “Come on, we had our fun. Don’t ruin this. Change me back.”<br />
<br />
The iguana couldn’t resist. Her predatory and sexual urges were in control now. She had discovered how good it felt to be dominant for the first time in her life and she wanted more.<br />
<br />
“Of course, Brooke. Of course,” Sam said gently, voice lusty. “I’ll change you back to your normal size now.”<br />
<br />
The deer felt resignation as she saw the giant iguana girl staring down at her like the helpless pet she had become. Merely shifting on the bed was enough to stroke her still fully aroused vaginal lips and nearly send herself into spasming again.<br />
<br />
Sam raised the PTFD, typed, and grinned mischievously as Brooke laid back on the bed still hot, still turned on, and staring at the ceiling with her tongue hanging from the side of her muzzle panting wildly. When she tapped the green start button, she glanced down with delight and saw poor Brooke’s shocked expression.<br />
<br />
“NNNNGHHHH!” The deer grimaced, eyes clenching shut in tears, gritting her teeth, hands closing to fists, ankles contorting tight. “FUUUUCK!” She began to pant desperately, writhing. She tensed even more. And then, the biggest and most powerful orgasm of her entire life. So strong that it made her scream uncontrollably. Her little vaginal lips were pulsating wildly and a clear froth had begun to pour from between them. Poor Brooke was having a wet female ejaculation.<br />
<br />
Constant ever increasing orgasm. So strong that the deer was completely senseless. Her initial cursing turned to pained crying. Tears streamed down her face. After a minute, those whimpers turned to moans. After two minutes, her ejaculation ran dry and her ass sat in a thick oily substance under her ass, tail, and thighs, soaking into the bed sheets as she kicked and strained.<br />
<br />
The moans soon turned to excited squeaks as she kept cumming. The sensations were only increasing. The pleasure only rising to greater and greater heights. The deer finally broke the ceiling of painful oversensitivity and crashed into the world of complete sexual delight. Her grimace turned to utter joy. She began to laugh hysterically, uncontrollably. She began to convulse wildly. Her entire existance became pure concentrated sexual bliss.<br />
<br />
Sam kneeled close and watched her tiny friend with shock and delight. She looked at the clock and gasped. Five minutes! Brooke had been cumming for a solid five minutes! She was almost tempted to do this herself just to see how it felt. Ever rising. Ever building.<br />
<br />
The deer was now in violent convulsions, throwing her head from side to side, every muscle being hammered by electric sensations down every nerve. She was so wet that even just her normal fluids were drooling. Her body was soaked in sweat, pouring hot cervine scent from every pour. Her pheromones wafted through the air to the lizard’s nose, intoxicating her with the scent of a mammal so aroused and so completely pleasured that she had lost all ability to think.<br />
<br />
Brooke began to convulse steadily as if possessed. Her eyes rolled back into her head. Every muscle spasmed. Every inch left of her tiny body gyrated and tensed over and over again in helpless mind blanking delight.<br />
<br />
Sam stared in slack jawed amazement as Brooke bucked and mmmphed and gasped in sharp breaths over and over. She let her keep going for minutes. For the deer it felt like hours of unending and ever escalating orgasm. Eventually, at it’s maximum possible peak, Brooke had begun to foam at her mouth, completely lost to pleasure to such a degree that she was having a steady orgasmic seizure.<br />
<br />
Sam carefully picked up the flailing doe in her hand and stared. She was completely unresponsive. Completely unaware. She kept spasming tightly. Her entire existance and mind had been reduced to nothing but sexual pleasure. She had transcended into the perfect female orgasm.<br />
<br />
Sam gulped as the helpless deer continued to shake in her hand and reached for the PTFD at her side. She gaped at Brooke’s breasts. She was so aroused they had grown by more than 25% and her nipples, had she been full sized, were as long and as thick as the tip of her thumb. Sam opened her hand, carefully examing her friend’s genitals, and was startled to see the same engorgement between her legs, the lips so red and so puffed up they were distended and disproportionately big, the butterfly shapes pressing out from their furry surroundings obscenely. This was to say nothing of her clit, which had grown so big and so obvious that it jutted from the bottom of her clitoral hood. The sight reminded Sam of a little erect penis and fuelled more strange and perverted fantasies.<br />
<br />
Eventually, carefully, after nearly a half hour of constant shattering orgasm, Sam set Brooke, still trembling violently and boiling to the touch, back on the comforter. She raised the device, lowered the deer’s libido, sexual excitement, sensitivity, and other modified sexual parameters back to their normal state.<br />
<br />
Very slowly, breathing ragged, the doe stopped trembling. She was utterly exhausted, dripping oily sweat from her fur, and nearing unconsciousness. Carefully, Sam observed her friends and checked her vital statistics. Her exhaustion had redlined to dangerous levels.<br />
<br />
Sam decreased the exhaustion to nothing and watched as Brooke gradually started to come out of it, her body relaxing, her heart rate and breathing normalizing. The doe’s breasts slowly returned to their normal swell, her nipples decreased, and little by little her extreme sexual arousal began to reduce to normalcy.<br />
<br />
Brooke sat up, holding her head, and stared up at her giant reptilian friend with trembling fear.<br />
<br />
“S-Sammy...” Brooke said hoarsely, even her tiny voice audibly rough. “P-Please... change me back. I-I don’t like this anymore.”<br />
<br />
But Sam the iguana had no intent to lose her new and exciting toy. Something deep and menacing that had been supressed for years began to boil over into the iguana’s heart and soul. Her practiced gentle demeanor began to crack. Her bubbly giggly personality began to grow as cold as her blood.<br />
<br />
“Hmmm...” Sam smirked. “No.”<br />
<br />
“W-What?” Brooke gaped, starting to tremble again, clutching her arms to herself and curling up as small as she could make herself. She felt disgusting, caked in oil, cum, and the twinge of her drying sweat. Her own juices began to dry below her tail and in her ass crack. She was completely and utterly helpless, exhausted mentally, and on the verge of a panic attack.<br />
<br />
“No.” Sam grinned, showing her teeth. “I’ve let you push me around for too long. God dammit, Brooke, you’re telling me you never saw the way I looked at you? The longing glances? The way I’d check out your rack? You must have known.”<br />
<br />
“S-Sam!” Brooke gasped, mortified. “I-I... this isn’t you! Something has happened! Please, please, stop! This has gone too far! Make me big again and we’ll... we’ll talk about it.”<br />
<br />
“No...” The iguana grinned a sidelong glance, licking her lips. “No, there’s nothing to talk about. You’re mine now. Mine.”<br />
<br />
“S-Sam!” Brooke drew back quickly in horror. “No, please! Don’t do this!”<br />
<br />
The iguana raised the device again, grinning, and tapped something in. She hit the button.<br />
<br />
Brooke gasped as transformative energy began to ripple through her...</p>
