<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Earlier in the day, as Richard and Rose went about handling some of the other issues that related to Richard&#39;s accidental induction into were society the previous night, the pair were visiting Leon and Regina Talbot, the &quot;King and Queen&quot; among Moon Lake&#39;s werelion community. It had grown a bit bigger than what it would have been originally, as Rose had gotten overly curious into what her husband had developed into in his human form, which in turn lead to Rose becoming a werelioness as well. A part of Rose really didn&#39;t mind that, particularly with Richard being the one to turn her, but it also doubled the things they needed to do and likely complicated dealing with some of those issues that related to both Richard&#39;s induction and then the mundane Mountain Lion attack on her. Thankfully both Leon and Regina had seemed rather accepting, particularly after the statement that Richard wasn&#39;t out to challenge Leon for his throne, and that was a good thing for both of them.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re sure you&#39;re feeling alright?&quot; Regina asked to Rose, and scooting her chair closer around the table to sit closer. In a sense, the other woman sounded like a big sister, which was also nice... as Rose had been an only child growing up and thus never had anyone besides her parents to look out for her in that way and no one to look out for as a big sister.<br />
<br />
&quot;All things... considered, yes,&quot; Rose answered with a weak smile, &quot;I mean... some of Richard&#39;s response to the Mandatory Were Law was frustrating and that prompted what ended up making him a werelion as I tried to get him to... see sense, as it were.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It can be tough for people that are new... and that can raise its own issues at times,&quot; Regina commented, &quot;which is partially why Moon Lake gives new residents the time to learn things and be fully aware of their choices...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And we ended up rushing into things,&quot; Rose commented, &quot;Richard tripping onto Sheila, me running out and getting attacked by a Mountain Lion, and then getting overly curious about Richard&#39;s new form...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, and normally given your condition, Moon Lake would have advised you to wait until after you&#39;d full healed from those bruised ribs before becoming a were,&quot; Regina nodded and spoke in a calm voice, &quot;mostly to make sure those ribs don&#39;t break as you grow and change... but you did survive and make it through, and there lycanthropic regeneration will accelerate that healing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;While dealing with all sorts of other new issues,&quot; Rose nodded, &quot;starting with making sure our affairs with the city were closed and making sure that we aren&#39;t challenging you or your husband. That&#39;s not what we came to Moon Lake for.&quot;<br />
<br />
Regina let a small smile cross her lips as Rose continued.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then there will be getting clothes that will fit us,&quot; Rose managed, &quot;I mean... I can just squeeze into my regular clothes right now, but they are rather tight... and for the moment, I&#39;m not wearing a bra. And all the growth that Richard has gone through... that was kinda what got me interested and well... we&#39;re still young enough for it and...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That can be handled,&quot; Regina commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Rose nodded, &quot;Mrs. Twist told us about some local spots. But we came straight here as we didn&#39;t want to interrupt anything  family oriented or pride oriented for you and your husband...&quot;<br />
<br />
Regina didn&#39;t say anything, but merely nodded. From the story that the two new werelions had told her and her husband earlier, it was fairly clear that both were juggling their human plans and new werelion instincts as well. While she could hold the &quot;power&quot; to be judgmental, that wouldn&#39;t help anyone.<br />
<br />
&quot;And then there will be the combined issue of explaining things to our younger children and then organizing our own little pride here in Moon Lake and staying out of trouble,&quot; Rose then finished, &quot;the former will be the biggest one...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure things will be fine,&quot; Regina commented, &quot;weres may have their own issues and hurdles to over come at times... sometimes it&#39;s between different were species. Weretigers and werelions over who is the &quot;King of Beasts&quot; as it were. Werebears over their perceived &quot;space&quot; and so on... but like society outside Moon Lake, many of these issues aren&#39;t really that different from some of the same arguments that are had elsewhere. The details are different, but the basis of the argument is the same. And Moon Lake has managed them fairly well over the years, and if your children make friends that live here... it&#39;s likely their friends will be weres and they will understand some the details about weres and our unique drives. Some may even fall in love with a local... and may become weres themselves.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not ready for that,&quot; Rose practically blurted, &quot;Frank... he&#39;s in college, so I really can&#39;t complain. But Rachel and Rob... they&#39;re younger. And well... I&#39;m not ready for either of them to be sexually active. And I especially don&#39;t want them being abused by an adult...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Weres over eighteen wouldn&#39;t turn normals under eighteen,&quot; Regina assured her, &quot;if something like that happens, the age between the two will be the same... and that would then mean that issue would then be best left up to you and your children. Talk with them and be honest about it. As if they&#39;re in high school now... they&#39;ll have all the puberty driven hormones going through them... they could well want to join in. Talking with them and reaching an understanding will be better than just mandating things... particularly as other things move forward.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rose looked over to the other woman with a nervous frown on her lips. Regina&#39;s eyes were soft and understanding, which relieved some pressure on Rose, but the other woman wasn&#39;t smiling either.<br />
<br />
&quot;For you&#39;ve also said you hadn&#39;t taken any werelion birth control pill before you got curious with your husband,&quot; Regina then said slowly, &quot;and as a were, your reproductive system will now work differently. Once a month, for a week, you will go into heat and will only ovulate if you get enough sexual stimulation. And while this doesn&#39;t happen in every case, a new were will have their first heat cycle when they become weres. The transformation from human to were triggers that start. In this... you could be pregnant as we speak, and if so, in fourteen years, your youngest child will take on his or her werelion fursona for the first time. And there, were society has found that sex helps ease that first transformation in relieving any possible pain or discomfort coming from the physical transformation.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I...&quot; Rose began, &quot;I had the sense that could happen... and if I am pregnant, I could easily accept that. As I&#39;ve been pregnant before.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure,&quot; Regina nodded, &quot;but you&#39;ll need to find out for sure... Now, it&#39;d probably too early, even for a were, for a pregnancy test, but the hospital can test for the specific hormones that would be associated with a were in heat. If you aren&#39;t in heat, you can then pick up the birth control pills you&#39;ll need while there. If you are in heat... you could then assume that you are, or will be, pregnant.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This is all happening fast,&quot; Rose admitted, &quot;I wouldn&#39;t know who to call... and the only doctor I met was in the emergency room.&quot;<br />
<br />
This was where Regina smiled and then leaned back in her chair to one counter and picked up a cellphone that was laying there. Rose watched as she dialed a number and then put the phone on &quot;speaker.&quot; There came an answer a moment later that Rose listened to.<br />
<br />
&quot;Moon Lake Hospital, Gynecology and Obstetrics Department, how may I help you?&quot; said the voice, sounding professional.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is Regina Talbot, I have a rather NEW friend visiting me at the moment,&quot; Regina spoke politely, &quot;she is new to Moon Lake and new some of our ways, so she doesn&#39;t have your number to schedule an appointment at this moment, so I&#39;m offering to help her schedule one. Would you have time to at least schedule a lab test to detect for h-hormones?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A new member of the Lion&#39;s Club?&quot; the voice asked back in a way that struck Rose as coded language, though likely protecting the were secret.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why, yes, I have her here and will let her talk with you,&quot; Regina answered and then held the phone before Rose. She could see on its screen that the speaker function was still on.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello,&quot; the voice asked, &quot;may I get your name, ma&#39;am?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Rose Van Direstag,&quot; Rose answered, &quot;my husband I... well, we joined recently, but I hadn&#39;t been able to get my new birth control pills yet. So I would like to see if I am to be pregnant and if not pick up the new pills.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course, Mrs. Van Direstag,&quot; the voice answered, &quot;Doctor Jones&#39; slate is actually full for today, BUT we can fit you in to come into the lab. They can run the h-hormone tests and then report them to you. You can then fill out the appropriate paperwork while waiting for those results. The lab can then bring them back to you. Do you know where the hospital is?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, actually,&quot; Rose said nervously, &quot;I was admitted into the ER last night after being attacked by a Mountain Lion... a mundane one... and was discharged this morning. I think the hospital as a whole should have my information on file. Though after that discharge, well, my husband had become a &quot;Lion&#39;s Club&quot; member last night and I got in a bit of a rush to join him...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see, we can then check with those records or for them, which will make things easier for you, less paperwork, as it were,&quot; the voice answered, &quot;when are you free to come in?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How long would you be open for this lab visit?&quot; Rose asked, &quot;my husband and I are finishing up some business with the Talbots and we&#39;ll need clothing that will be more fitting...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The lab will be open for another few hours, but the pharmacy will close at four,&quot; the voice answered, &quot;it would be best to do this as quickly as you can. That way you can get fitting attire without worrying about having to make it in for an appointment.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then in about an hour,&quot; Rose spoke, &quot;just to give my husband and I time to conclude our business with the Talbots and then come over to the hospital and get directions to your lab area.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, we have an appointment with the Lab at 2:30 PM, please have your insurance card or numbers ready, thank you,&quot; the voice answered, &quot;see you then, Mrs. Van Direstag.&quot;<br />
<br />
With that the phone call ended and and Regina then set it down on the table.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you,&quot; Rose said to her, &quot;a lot of this has gone by so fast... in that while it&#39;s not really bad... it&#39;s just quick.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Happy to help, particularly as while yours and your husband&#39;s entry into werelion society wasn&#39;t how most would join us, you are trying to make up for it, and that shows responsibility,&quot; Regina answered, &quot;and shows that ultimately, you may have actually succeeded in getting your husband to stop and think.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just not in the way I envisioned,&quot; Rose commented, &quot;and coming to grips and realizations with some things that I thought I&#39;d put behind me when Richard and I married. After all, I promised myself to him... and a part of me wants to stay that way... but...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The instincts to be part of a pride are natural,&quot; Regina nodded, &quot;and is a part of being a werelion, and why we&#39;re often considered to be something of a swingers club. But love and loyalty remain. I&#39;ve been with men other than Leon... and he&#39;s been with women other than me, but we both know that we love each other and that much of this is more &quot;pride bonding&quot; than anything else. So, wanting to bond with Shelia is perfectly natural now, and if your husband wants to let you indulge in that... that&#39;s also natural. It may not be the same as a werefox&#39;s bond... but it is something that&#39;s there with werelions. We may swing, but it&#39;s often with the consent and approval of each partner.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rose nodded, though she also noted that from the tone of voice that Regina gave, it was quite possible that Regina might have also been with other women as well, but Rose couldn&#39;t confirm that. &quot;I&#39;m just hoping not to get too overwhelmed by things... or come off as too irritating to Shelia. As there was a part of me that was fairly tempted by her offer when she made it... but...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You wanted to remain loyal to your husband, which is understandable,&quot; Regina nodded, &quot;and the rapid introduction was going to be a surprise in pretty much every way. It&#39;s also where being open with whoever you and your husband take into your pride will be important. While a fair number of werelionesses may be bi, not all of them are. And those that aren&#39;t may not want to join a pride that would have that as its basis. As for Shelia, I&#39;m sure if you explain some of your uncertainties at the time, you&#39;ll be fine.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I hope so...&quot; Rose answered, &quot;with all the stuff that&#39;s gone on... I would like the ability to make and hold friends in the area. In a way, you could say it&#39;d be... normal.&quot;<br />
<br />
Regina chuckled at that, &quot;and I&#39;m sure it will. Just give it time. Your husband may have to spend some time in coalition with a werelion near you... learn more how our prides operate and are to be defended, and so on. And once you&#39;re fully healed from your injuries in a few days since you&#39;ve become a werelion... Shelia and your husband&#39;s coalition partner&#39;s females will help you learn to hunt. In the meantime... we can check on your husband and see if he and Leon have settled things out.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And let Richard know of my appointment,&quot; Rose nodded, &quot;then from there... getting measured and getting clothes that will fit us.&quot;</p>
