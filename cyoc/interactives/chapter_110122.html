<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The pain gone, Todd was exultant.  He flexed the muscles of his new form, felt the raw power rippling its way from the base of his skull all the way to the tip of his tail.  He experimentally open and closed his hands, noting the scything claws located at the end of each digit.  He could feel the cold floor through the soles of his feet and felt the air move through the room as it rustled the tiny hairs all along his thick hide.  He had changed, but he was definitely still himself.<br />
<br />
A dim alarm cut through his revelry.  He had a job to do.  He sighed and took his new bulk outside.<br />
The campus was empty, everyone having been evacuated.  He found his new form could easily track the path that Cowgirl had taken, and he loped off after her, his tail holding him balanced, his feet thundering the ground as he walked.<br />
Her path took her into the woods, and he followed.<br />
<br />
He walked through the forest, feeling the power in his form and his connection with nature.  When this was all over, he may never change himself back.  He was a monster, but he found he liked it.  He almost missed the change in the trail, when he heard the call of Cowgirl floating through the air, a haunting call.  His nostrils flared as he caught her scent.  Bent low over the trail, he breathed deep and drew her into his lungs.  His new senses processed a lot of this his still human brain didn&#39;t understand; but he caught little glimpses.  Heat, excitement?  Lust?  He followed the trail as easily as if it were glowing and found Cowgirl in a clearing.<br />
<br />
She hadn&#39;t noticed him yet, and was knocking down trees and building what looked like a nest.  The wind blew his way and Todd watched, unsure what to do.  The wind changed and blew towards her.   At once she froze, her head lifted to the wind.  A growling roar as she whipped around and scented Todd.  She charged forward, eyes full of hate and slammed her body into his, sending him sprawling to the ground.<br />
<br />
A line of dirt is furrowed by his fall, and he lays there in fear.  They were apparently more saurian than mammal for she was bigger than him by quite a lot. Snarling, her claws reach for his throat in a deathblow.  Unable to move in time, he takes the hit.<br />
<br />
Both Cowgirl and Todd are surprised as her claws rake across his hide but do not break the skin.  She looks at him, and for a moment he glimpses the human girl still inside.  Roaring his own battle cry, he leaps up and slams his fists into her, knocking her aside.  Her spines glow and she fires one of those Kaiju beams straight into his chest.  Grunting, he looks up in time to see her charging him, and he whips his tail into the side of her head with a thunderous crack.  She takes a step backwards, and he lunges forward, biting the curve of her neck and sinking in his teeth.  Blood flows in rivulets into his mouth as he growls.  She drives a knee into his midsection, attempting to dislodge him from her neck, her tail wraps around his leg to try and trip him up as she seeks to choke his windpipe with her hands.  Screaming, she slams her body into him and into the makeshift nest, breaking the grip of his jaw and pinning him on his pack.  She seeks to rip out his jugular, biting and sucking at his neck.<br />
<br />
They writhe around each other, and Todd, grunting grabs at the udder still attached to her and gives a hard pull on two of the teats.  She grunts in surprise, then anger.<br />
<br />
He felt it, a throbbing between his legs, and a pressure beginning to mount.  As the throes of their violent lust began to build, more and more of his rational mind began to fall away.  A massive member, bigger than he had ever had as a human, was sprouting from his crotch.  Small and away a part of him was amused.  Now he knew where the remote had gone.  The delicious spicy smell of her pheremones filled his heightened senses and he felt her respond in kind.<br />
<br />
She crashed to the ground, her massive bulk before him.  Her wide wide hips where presented to him, and her tail moved to the side, revealing her vagina, throbbing as the juices flowed.  His mind blank with lust, Todd mounted her as he was bid and began to thrust deep inside her.  She cried out in pleasure, her tail wrapping around him, her hands leaving great claw marks in the ground and trees around her.  Faster and faster they thrust together, his hands reaching down and grabbing her teats, giving great pulls of thick beast milk on the forest floor.  Heat and power flowed from his body to hers, and a dim part of his human mind felt the danger there and tried to pull away, but with his instincts engaged he could not.<br />
<br />
The orgasm built to where he could not take it any longer, and he came inside her.  Her vagina clamped onto his penis like a vise, and wouldn&#39;t let go.  He kept coming, and couldn&#39;t take the pleasure, her vagina rhythmically squeezing and draining him dry.  At his limit, he couldn&#39;t take it anymore, and with a final explosive blast, He felt her come, screaming his name, in an orgasm that shook the world.  Exhausted he felt his whole world go dark and collapsed on top of her.<br />
<br />
The magical energies exploded outwards from that orgasm, and as both fell asleep, their bestial features faded as they reverted to their purely human forms.  Laying in a pool of cum and sweat, Todd was still on top of the girl Cowgirl originally was, as his penis fell away from his body.  The will of the Magic Remote done, it started to shrivel then melted away in the pool between their legs entirely.</p>
