<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Madame Wisteria was an old lady who had been single her whole life. She made enough money from being a very successful business leader, but that was her past life. Now she was retired and ran a little &quot;magic shop&quot; where she sold little trinkets and fortune telling and other weird advice. She lived above the store, and her primary income came from her pension, stocks, and other investments. As the store was more something Wisteria did as a way to pass time and entertain herself her prices were basically on the margins and the fortunes and advice were free. Most people who came in came for the experience and less actually believing in her powers. Then Ty&#39;s power manifested in her. Not much happened after. It&#39;s not like she had many strong desires in her day to day life, but her predictions as vague as they were had been getting... 100% correct. Now usually the predictions were usually correct thanks to their vagueness, but now they were coming true without having to say they &quot;technically&quot; came true. Wisteria had considered this to be just a coincidence and then came Stephan some teen romantic who was looking around and then asked Wisteria to give him a prediction of where he&#39;d find a girl to date. <br />
Wisteria brought out the Tarot cards and pulled out a fool card... always good for starting out on something new, Death which just kinda meant change, and then the Stars so he&#39;d be guided by something. <br />
Stephan sighed and said &quot;I mean that&#39;s good, but couldn&#39;t you just give me something more concrete?&quot; <br />
Wisteria said &quot;The Tarot deck can only do so much. If you trust my gut then why not take out the trash and you&#39;ll definitely find a girl you&#39;ll like.&quot; <br />
Stephan chuckled a bit and looked at the waste basket and said &quot;Know what sure.&quot; the basket wasn&#39;t that full so he went out to the trash bin and found a pretty looking girl with flawless pale skin, blue eyes, and long brown hair. Stephan put the trash bin down and introduced himself and that he didn&#39;t work for Wisteria, but was just helping out the little old lady. They chuckled a bit and the girl seemed to like that he was helping out the old lady, they exchanged contact information and that was that. At least for now. <br />
Wisteria was on an ipad checking the news when Stephan barged in with an empty waste basket and said &quot;You were right!!!&quot; <br />
Wisteria wide eyed asked &quot;About what?&quot;<br />
&quot;I took the trash out and there was this cute girl named Olivia, we exchanged information, and it seemed that she liked me helping you out with the trash!&quot; <br />
Wisteria said &quot;Well... ain&#39;t that a coincidence...&quot;<br />
&quot;I know... got any charms or pendants for love luck... or maybe some clothes for a date or something?&quot; <br />
Wisteria looked around the shop and said &quot;There&#39;s a small wardrobe if you can carry it out yourself. Hasn&#39;t been moving so it&#39;d be a bit of a help. Lady I got it from says that if you think about your love under a full moon and place clothes in it then the clothes and even yourself to some extent will change to be physically irresistible to your love. Turns out the issue is that if you aren&#39;t emotionally or mentally compatible there&#39;s only so much lust can do.&quot;  <br />
Stephan grinned as he approached the small wardrobe and said &quot;No problem! Thank you very much...&quot; then he tried to get it out and said &quot;I&#39;m gonna go borrow my friend&#39;s truck for a second.&quot; Wisteria opened up a little bit of shop space for something else, and was happy. She got the story from some lady in Europe somewhere, but the wardrobe was bought from some company that produced hundreds of them. Still the boy could use all the self-confidence he could get. <br />
The day after the next full moon Wisteria saw a panicked young lady with a rather stacked bosom who said &quot;Madame Wisteria! Your wardrobe... Something must&#39;ve went wrong!&quot; <br />
Wisteria stared and asked &quot;Um... Who are you?&quot; <br />
She said &quot;Stephan, the man who helped you with the trash and got a girlfriend in return!&quot; <br />
&quot;You put the clothes in the afternoon and thought about the girl right?&quot; <br />
Stephan nodded and said &quot;Then when I woke up I was this woman and the clothes in the dresser turned into this dress. I&#39;ve got a date with her really soon, we&#39;re meeting in front of this shop actually and... do you have something for this?!?!&quot;<br />
Madame Wisteria said &quot;I don&#39;t know what to say kid. I didn&#39;t personally believe the story from the lady I heard it from, and that&#39;s just a factory produced dresser. Nothing magical about it.&quot; There was something going on, but one doesn&#39;t just placebo themselves into changing gender. <br />
A bit later Olivia came in and when she saw Stephan she blushed a bit and said &quot;Excuse me, um... Did you see a young man with short blonde hair, some freckles, and may have been working here previously? We were going to meet up and wanted to be sure he wasn&#39;t inside or something.&quot; <br />
Wisteria looked to Stephan who was holding her breath thinking and said &quot;That&#39;s him, the buxom lady you look like you have a small lust crush on.&quot; <br />
Olivia said &quot;Please, don&#39;t joke with me. She does look like she could be a sister but-&quot; <br />
Wisteria said &quot;She got cursed by some magic artifact I had here. didn&#39;t even know I had magical artifacts. Go on give your boyfriend a call.&quot; <br />
Olivia did and then a ringing came from Stephan&#39;s purse and as the call connected the two didn&#39;t know what to say. This type of thing just didn&#39;t happen in reality at all. <br />
Wisteria said &quot;Just go on a fun date, i&#39;ll figure out something, and a skip hop and a jump to my shop will get you right back to normal Steph.&quot; <br />
<br />
The two young woman figured they could do that at least for now and had a great time. Both found they enjoyed each other&#39;s company a lot this could be the start of a new relationship. Olivia had asked what happened and Steph responded that she had put her clothes in a special dresser last night under a full moon, thought about her, and then his body had changed into this woman and the clothes had changed as well. Turned out the dresser was normal and that something weird had happened. Feeling happy the two were walking back to the store when Steph had a random thought as she said &quot;Looks like it&#39;s just a skip, hop, and a jump left to the store.&quot; <br />
Olivia chuckled and said &quot;I don&#39;t think it was literal Steph.&quot; <br />
&quot;Hey her predictions were 100% correct so far. With finding you, with the dresser, why wouldn&#39;t a skip, hop, and a jump actually turn me back to normal?&quot;<br />
Olivia chuckled some more and said &quot;Well let&#39;s do it then&quot; having a bit of fun. The two held hands and did a skip, did a small bunny hop, and then did a long jump to the store&#39;s door and then Olivia noticed the person next to her wasn&#39;t a woman whose breasts were jiggling from all the up and down motion, but the tall young man who had contacted her. <br />
&#39;It worked!!!&quot; the two said as a bewildered Wisteria just looked at the two. <br />
&quot;I guess it did?&quot; Wisteria asked &quot;Didn&#39;t really work for your clothes though.&quot; and then the two looked a bit further down to his torso where the dress still was, and the bra was still there as well... <br />
Stephan laughed and said &quot;Still a relief than being stuck like that with no way back though right?&quot; Olivia chuckled a bit more although she kinda preferred Steph over Stephan. Although she&#39;d keep that her little secret for a little while. <br />
<br />
Wisteria closed her shop leaving the two love birds to whatever they&#39;d do and went to her apartment above her shop. She wondered what had happened and then wondered if her words had actually done anything. In her full length mirror she looked at herself and saw the old woman, many wrinkles on her face, and nearly white hair... plus the garb that looked more like a witch&#39;s outfit than a gypsy&#39;s. She chuckled as she said &quot;Then when I say by the power of pure love I become magical girl love love.&quot; she remembered seeing some old 90&#39;s magical girl animes once or twice and thought it may be a little silly. Then she said &quot;By the power of pure love.&quot; somewhat softly and then blinding rainbow lights blazed and what was left in the place of an old lady was a little girl who just looked in the mirror. Wisteria was astonished as she went to the mirror and saw a very small girl in a frilly red dress who couldn&#39;t be more than 4 years old. &quot;Weren&#39;t magical girls a little older than this?&quot; she wondered but had to admit she was full of energy and could really move around again. She could run, and jump and... ok maybe she&#39;d jump a bit too far and maybe she was a bit super human with her agility as she really bounced off the walls. Was Magical girl Love Love that mature? Maybe not but she was loving her return to youth with everything she had... if only she could go out and do anything in this form.&quot;</p>
