<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It should have been a great year for Sarah. The director had just celebrated her 38th birthday, her beloved Lions had finally won a playoff game, and the agency under her control was surpassing the expectations of her superiors. Everything was moving in a positive direction. As New Years approached, she was anticipating a great year. Then everything went south.<br />
<br />
It started with Wren and Knox&#39;s death, the veteran agents were in the process of apprehending the vampire queen Vanessa. What should&#39;ve been a great end to the year turned into a blood bath. Sarah was devastated, losing two veteran agents she had personally recruited. Worse, Vanessa had escaped with her sources saying that the Normal had formed an alliance with her. Things only got worse when she received word of turmoil in the vampire realm.<br />
<br />
A civil war had broken out. Wyatt Tepes barely escaping as Vanessa usurped the throne. Getting him in wasn&#39;t easy as Sarah had to deactivate the shell stone to allow entrance before sealing the gate. This only exacerbated the issue as Wyatts family was cut off. Needless to say, things had been tense as Wyatt fumed over Sarah closing the portal but, what choice did she have? If the portal remained open Vanessa&#39;s forces could have overrun S.P.E.A.R. Sarah shuddered at the thought. What if that happened and the Normal took control of S.P.E.A.R? Since then, she had been in contact with the vampire realm through cellphone.<br />
<br />
From what Sarah could gather, the vampire realm was chaos. S.P.E.A.R though though was doing their level best to offer safe passage to refugees but it was a time sensitive operation. She could only leave the portal open for so long before reseaaling it. It broke her heart watching refugees beg to leave the portal open just a moment longer because their loved ones were in the way. She couldn&#39;t take that chance though, leading to more heartbreak. After talking with several of the minor lords through secure channels she learned Vanessa wasn&#39;t stopping with just the Tepes line. Old Bloods were in danger as well, those who had worked closely with S.P.E.A.R and their allies fighting for their very survival against the Mad Queens forces. From what Sarah understood, Vanessa ess hell bent on their destruction and those not involved in thw battle were staying out of it, waiting to take a side when the other seemed certain to again victory.<br />
<br />
It also meant that S.P.E.A.R was current home to around 500 displaced vampires. Cole and Jacob had setup housing in the lower levels before sealing off the area. The last thing they needed was a hungry vampire roaming the corridors of S.P.E.A.R offices. Although they were providing rations and housing, the atmosphere was tense. Blood supplies were low and S.P.E.A.R began useing its media contacts to put out the notice for blood donations. Thankfully it was still close to the holidays and the blood banks were able to rally enough support to fill their needs. Still, it was a delicate situation only made worse with the arrival of more vampires.<br />
<br />
&quot;Director McMillan?&#39;<br />
<br />
Sarah glanced up from her mug, noticing Hailey lurking in the doorway. This was another problem she was now dealing with. When Wyatt and the Five arrived, they were separated from his wife and children as well as their hand maid. That hand maid just so happened to be Haileys mother Cheyenne. &quot;Come on Agent Meyers,&quot; she stated. &quot;And close the door.&quot; Hailey did so, now standing before Sarah with a stern look in her campiric face. &quot;I&#39;m requesting to be on the mission to rescue the Tepes family!&quot;<br />
<br />
Sarah sighed, Hailey had made this request everyday, nearly every hour since learning of her mothers capture. Sarah of course said no, Hailey was too emotionally involved. She could jeopardize the mission and get herself killed. Still, she was relentless, offering different plans, different scenarios, always arguing her point. &quot;The answer is still no Agent Meyers.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why,&quot; Hailey exclaimed, slamming her fist down on Sarah&#39;s desk. This was different, the young agent seemed to have finally reached her breaking point. Sarah raised an eyebrow, ready to discipline the young agent before noticing bloody tears streaming down her face. She had seen that type of grief before. In herself many, many years ago. &quot;Have a seat Hailey,&quot; she sighed. &quot;I need to talk with you.&quot;<br />
<br />
As Hailey sat, Sarah studied the young woman carefully. She knew Haileys family history, how it was just her and her mother since before Hailey could remember. Haileys mother was everything to her and it was a pain she could understand completely. &quot;Did I ever tell you I was a Lions fan,&quot; she began. Hailey shook her head no. She was aware of Sarah&#39;s Fandom but the director had never mentioned anything to her.<br />
<br />
&quot;My dad was a huge Lions fan,&quot; Sarah continued. &quot;I was actually at their last playoff win. It was an early seventh birthday present. My birthdays January 10th and he was able to snag a pair of tickets. Best birthday present of my life.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hailey nodded, realizing Sarah&#39;s birthday had just passed and she hadn&#39;t said anything. &quot;Happy belated birthday ma&#39;am,&quot; she said softly. &quot;I&#39;m surprised you didn&#39;t say anything.&quot; Sarah shrugged, a small smirk spreading across her face. &quot;After about 25 or 26 birthdays become just another day,&quot; she shrugged. Hailey nodded, still anxious about her mother to really want to listen to Sarah&#39;s story. &quot;I&#39;m sorry but is their a point to this Director?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m getting there,&quot; Sarah replied softly. &quot;I was daddy&#39;s girl growing up. Mom was a secretary at the elementary school. Dad was an iron worker, he used to work long hours but he always made it a point to spend every minute of his weekends with me. Introduced me to football, took me to all the games both pro and college. I think he wanted a son but my folks only had me. Guess he said the hell with it and did all the things he would&#39;ve done with a boy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sarah sighed heavily, her shoulders slumping as she stared at her Lions mug. &quot;Dad died when I was 15,&quot; she said softly. &quot;Nothing crazy. A heart attack at work and boom, my world was turned upside down. So before you start, just know I get what it&#39;s like when you lose a parent.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And that&#39;s why I have to go Sarah,&quot; Hailey exclaimed. &quot;Think about it. If you thought you had a chance to save your dad wouldn&#39;t you want to go too?&quot; A silence now lingered, Sarah&#39;s face darkening as she glared at Hailey. &quot;Low blow Hailey.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hailey offered a meek apology, her face turning crimson as Sarah continued. Despite bringing up her deceased father, Sarah remained calm in how she spoke. &quot;To answer your question yes I would want to go,&quot; Sarah continued. &quot;And I would hope my superiors would stop me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why,&quot; Hailey asked, her eyes wide in shock.<br />
<br />
&quot;Because I would be too close,&quot; Sarah said. &quot;I&#39;d be emotionally invested in the mission. Let me ask you this, what happens if your mother is dead? Are you going to be able to think with a clear head? Rescue everyone else and keep your team safe? It&#39;s more than just your mother whose a hostage, there&#39;s at least seven other vampires, most of whom are children. Can you keep a cool head if the worst happens?&quot;<br />
<br />
Hailey paused, her shoulders slumping as fresh bloody teats rolled down her cheek. &quot;No,&quot; she sniffed. &quot;No I probably won&#39;t.&quot; Sarah sighed, gazing at the young vampire. Hailey was rapidly becoming one of her most reliable agents but she worried this assignment would be too much for her. &quot;What I&#39;m about to do goes against my better judgement,&quot; she sighed. &quot;But my options are limited. Right now Deshp and Henry are prepping a rescue mission into the realm of the vampires. I can&#39;t risk sensing a human agent, so I&#39;m sending you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sending you with them Hailey,&quot; Sarah stated. &quot;That you were honest enough to admit some emotional bagge with the request tells me something. Most agents would&#39;ve lied and I would have said no. Honesty goes along way in my book.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So I&#39;ll have a chance to rescue my mom?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Rescue the hostages,&quot; Sarah corrected. &quot;This mission isn&#39;t just about your mom. We have a duty to protect the innocent and from where I stand Wyatt&#39;s kids are the innocent ones in this. They&#39;re the priority. You get them and if you can save the others that&#39;s bonus points but the safety of your team comes first. If they&#39;re in trouble you abort no matter what. Is that understood?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes ma&#39;am,&quot; Hailey replied, standing at attention. A small smile now spreads across her face as she wiped the tears from her cheeks. &quot;Thank you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dont thank me yet,&quot; Sarah replied. &quot;This mission isn&#39;t going to be easy. Meet up with Geshp and Henry in conference room A. I&#39;ll be joining you shortly to brief you on thw operation.&quot; Sarah nodded, the young agent awkwardly hugging Sarah before sprinting out of the room. Sarah could only sigh, hoping thw risky mission her agents were about to undertake was a success.</p>
