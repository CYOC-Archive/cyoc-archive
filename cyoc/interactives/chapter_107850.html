<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Monday Morning<br />
<br />
Jeff was feeling better on this day. Still experiencing his period as he slowly changes into Alice’s twin sister; he wakes up to see Alice already naked and doing her hair. Normally Jeff would feel aroused at the sight of a naked girl inform of him; but seeing Alice naked all he feels is nothing. No arousal, no shame, nothing. Getting up, Jeff notices that the room looks different; He sees that is bigger than before and that there are two beds, two night stands, two dressers and a bigger closet then yesterday.<br />
<br />
“Morning Jeff,” Alice answers; “feeling better? I know menstrual cycles can suck but, that the cross we girls bear.”<br />
‘Girls?’ Jeff thinks to himself as he heads to the bathroom. Once again he strips to get a better look at himself in the mirror. Noticing that his hips are exactly like Alice’s he sees his legs are already looking like Alice’s as well. Seeing his feet are looking smaller; Jeff can’t help but smile.<br />
“I’d be enjoying this a lot more if I wasn’t experiencing a girl’s period,” Jeff says to himself as he once again grabs the Midol to deal with the bloating and cramping. Not as severe as yesterday; Jeff however was still feeling unwell. Knowing he can’t blow off a day at the beach for the second time, he hopes into the shower to clean up.<br />
<br />
Turning on the faucet, he lets the water cascade all over his body as he bends over to grab his shampoo and body wash. Noticing that both products are clearly feminine in nature he shrugs his shoulders and begins to wash up. <br />
<br />
Minutes later Jeff is out of the washroom and back in his bedroom with Alice; removing the towel the he wrapped around himself like a girl, Jeff looks at himself in the full body mirror the he shares with Alice, he notices that his legs are far more shapely and curvier than they were earlier.<br />
“Alright,” Alice grining; “enough ogling at yourself Jeff. Get yourself ready for our day at the beach.”<br />
“Fine, fine,” Jeff answering; he turns around to his side of the closet. Grabbing a one piece swimsuit for flat chested girls, Jeff lays it on his bed and starts picking a wardrobe to wear overtop.<br />
“Don’t forget the tampons and pads, Jeff;” Alice commenting as she is finished fussing with her hair.<br />
“I know,” Jeff responding; “I’m just torn between these two outfits.” Turning around to model them in front of Alice, he displays a light blue top with matching capris and a pair of shorts with a white shirt displaying Girl Power in pink letters.<br />
Alice smiles, “Girl power. You can never go wrong with that.”<br />
<br />
Jeff nods and proceeds to get dressed. Putting on the swimsuit; he then throws on the shorts and shirts. Modelling himself in front of the mirror; Jeff can’t help but notice that from the waist down it is clear that he is one hundred percent female. Quickly combing his hair deciding to not style it like his sister; Jeff puts on a bracelet and a clip on earring on each ear. It is clear Jeff is starting to think more like a girl; yet still using male pronouns.<br />
<br />
“Alice,” Jeff asking; “do you think of me as your brother or your sister?”<br />
“Why are you asking that Jeff?” Alice asking as she grabs her purse.<br />
“Because I look female from the waist down, yet you keep calling me Jeff,” Jeff responds.<br />
“Your my sister Jeff,” Alice answers; “you’ve just were born a little different. But you are all girl where it counts. Now come let’s go to the beach make some hot looking boys horny and eager to meet us.”<br />
<br />
Jeff thinks on what Alice said as she leaves the room; noticing a purse on his night stand, he opens it up to look at his i.d. On it says his name Jeffery, but his sister calling him Jeff; his address which was Alice’s address and his gender. The age listed as 15. Alice was 16. Jeff figured aging a year was soon to come since he set the cronovac to slowly turn him into Alice’s twin sister. And the gender listed on the card clearly said female.<br />
“But I keep identifying myself as male,” Jeff talks to himself. Putting the I.D away; Jeff grabs a few spare tampons from his night stand and head to the front entrance where his sister Alice is waiting. Putting on sandals and taking a towel that Alice grabbed for him.<br />
<br />
At the beach, the two share a locker and quickly strip down to their swimsuits. Alice taking the locker key and securing it in between her ample breasts; Jeff can’t help but feel a sense of jealousy as his sister was blessed with a bosom any boy would love to rub their face in and he was as flat chested as a boy. Breaking out of another shift to his personality; Jeff follows, Alice as he like her sways her hips seductively as they walk by a group of tall strong teenage boys playing beach volley ball. The cat calls and wolf whistles both receive did lift Jeff’s spirt some as she too was being noticed by boys that brought a stirring in her loins. While dealing with a menstrual cycle; Jeff can’t help but feel turned on at the sight of the boys bulges growing behind their speedos.<br />
<br />
Before Jeff could approach the older men; his sister grabs him and drags Jeff to where their friends are at. Jeff sees his male friends Rick and Joey. Before he would have felt no arousal from the two boys in front of him; but now with his body becoming more female each day, he couldn’t help but want to become closer to the two.<br />
<br />
Rick, Joey; “Alice speaking up; “you remember my sister Jeff.”<br />
“Hi Jeff,” both say in unison. “Up for a game of beach volley ball?” Joey the first to speak up.<br />
“Sure, Jeff answers; ”but who is going to be mine and my sister’s partner?”<br />
“Dibs on Rick,” Alice says before anyone could respond.<br />
“Guess I’m your partner Jeff,” Joey smiling; “you want to serve or shall I?”<br />
<br />
After several hours of volley ball where the four teen agers swapped partners and eventually did boy’s verses girl’s; Jeff and Alice say goodbye to the two as they head back to their locker. Collecting their clothes but not even bothering to put them one, the two just head back into the car and Alice drives them home.<br />
<br />
Arriving home both Jeff and Alice feeling tired form their day eat a light supper that their mother prepared. Regaling their day at the dinner table; their father was being his usual over protective self by insisting that his daughters be mindful that the only thing boys want is to get access to what is in between their legs. Both feeling embarrassed; Jeff and Alice rush to their room as their mother scolds their father for being crass.</p>
