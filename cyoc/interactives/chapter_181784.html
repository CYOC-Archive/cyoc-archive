<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;How is her rider, or is she still bouncing solo?&quot; Rachel asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;He is doing just about as good as you can imagine. Suddenly his best friend swells up, he becomes her rider and instantly she becomes the center of his world, only to have to be knocked into a coma just to make sure that she doesnt inadvertently kill herself due to the madness. So yeah, he isn&#39;t doing very well either, but at least he is at the hospital along with her.&quot; Spilled Kyle, seeming to find himself a bit of peace after telling someone about his worry.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s rough. Well, you said she should be perfectly fine when she comes around to waking up, so there isn&#39;t much for you to worry about.&quot; Bluntly stated Jen. She wasn&#39;t being mean or anything, she just didn&#39;t want to sound overly giddy while speaking about this kind of topic and risk laughing/neighing at possibly one of the the worst moments to do so. So it did come across as a bit cold and blunt, but at least it wasn&#39;t as disrespectful as the alternative. Kyle just took it in stride and agreed with her thinking.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know that, but she also was a friend of mine too. So it is hard not to be at least somewhat concerned. But thanks, I guess.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen nodded and went back to enjoying her candy which somehow was able to use almost her entire focus while doing so, blocking out just a out everything else besides a few key phrases and signals from her rider. Mainly her name, being redirected by the strip of skin between her shoulderblades, and/or being spured along by Rachel&#39;s dick heels. Aside from that, almost nothing could break her focus on enjoying the lollipop in her mouth.<br />
<br />
Rachel also didn&#39;t want to keep the truck waiting, so she ended the conversation by telling Kyle where she would be living for a while, if his friend ever wanted to hang out or something. But made certain to tell him never breath a word about the curse to her, as it was currently only being used for more, &quot;suggestive reasons&quot; at time moment, and wouldn&#39;t be used externally from the closed group of trusted users anytime soon. Kyle got the hint after piecing together what she was implying, and the several unique traits the duo sitting in front of him had to their bodies. Sure, he felt that all of them were normal, but how likely was it that 2 girls somehow got the mutation jackpot that has never been in existence before, and keeps developing more new traits as time goes on? On the other hand, if he didn&#39;t already know all about the power of the curse, he would have readily believed everything simply at face value. He thanked them for the offer and said he would put in a word with his sister as well to see if she can make some time for a house call, as she lives near the sanctuary.<br />
<br />
After loading Jen and Rachel up into the back of the truck, Jen&#39;s Dad drove them both back home to pack up what limited stuff they had available to be moved, and move it over to their new house in the sanctuary. On the way, Jen finished her lollipop and was getting a bit bored, so she did what she had come to know to be a fun way to pass the time. &quot;Hey Rachel, Transform or Dare?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, we are playing right now? Well, we are the only ones in the back, so I guess it is fine, as long as it isnt too crazy. Dare.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I dare you to never wear any kind of clothing anymore unless I say otherwise. Jewelry isnt included in this. Only you will be allowed to be fully naked in public, but it won&#39;t stop people from noticing. However, they will just accept it as normal, and won&#39;t harass us about it, although some may want to take a picture, which is fine because you now also like to be naked, and have fully embraced the nudist life, and it doesn&#39;t hurt that you are somewhat of an exhibitionist too. Weather can&#39;t bother or impact you negatively either. Lastly only me and you, plus Sam and Chiffon will know the difference.&quot; Said Jen as she turned 180 degrees around to watch what happens next.<br />
<br />
Rachel sighed and began to disrobe entirely, simply tossing her top onto the floor. &#39;I won&#39;t be needing it afterall, so why should I bother keeping it&#39; was her thought. Jen did however pick it up to keep for herself though. She liked the smell it had, as it smelled like Rachel. Although it would never fit her, as even with it&#39;s extra room for Rachel&#39;s third boob, her boobs were still far too big for it to fit around them. She did the same with the discarded thong and skirt too.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok, now that I am completely naked forever, we do not have quite as much to pack I guess.&quot; Rachel shrugged. She liked being naked even before this curse, so this wasn&#39;t a huge change for her. Sure being naked in public felt a bit intimidating, but that was more from excitement than fear. Jen leaned forward and began suckling out the delicious milk from Rachel&#39;s center breast. Rachel didn&#39;t stop her and just readjusted herself slightly to give her a better angle, while she began to run her fingers through Jen&#39;s hair. While this was happening, Rachel was thinking about how she could curse Jen back.</p>
