<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kelsey walked behind her sister, following her to her room. Ally said that she should find a pair of panties that woulf fit her properly, or at least she could afford to have expanded a bit. Entering her room she asked Kelsey to strip, and tossed away her underware, shirt, and pants. <br />
<br />
She handed him a pair of string panties, since of all the pairs she had, these were the only ones who could be made to fit Kelsey&#39;s larger body. She also handed her a nightgown, which on her, was a few sizes too large, but was snug on Kelsey, looking closer to a minidress than a loose nightgown. Although the fabric and design obviously didn&#39;t express that the outfit was a dress, if Kelsey were to wear it in public, Ally was sure it would be seen as just a comfortable dress. It actually was once a sundress, but now was fairly worn and faded.<br />
<br />
Reluctantly, Kelsey put on the clothes. She did have to admit that they were more comfortable on her slowly changing body. While you couldn&#39;t watch the transformation happen, you could see the subtle differences as time went on. For example, from the time their Mok had left until now, Kelsey&#39;s arm hair had almost entirely all fallen off. She also gained a quarter inch in her hips, while lost half an inch at her waist.<br />
<br />
Ally also tossed Kelsey a pair of dark shaded tights which were semitransparent that she had borrowed from their Mom one time, but had forgotten to return. Kelsey also put them on without much resistance simce she didn&#39;t know what was considered &quot;properly dressed&quot; for girls. She didn&#39;t realize that Ally was now just playing &quot;dress up&quot;, and that now she may even be a bit over dressed for cleaning out her closet and removing her bed. Plus it was the middle of summer too. Ally would have given her sister a pair of heels if she had them in her size, but sadly Kelsey neither was Her&#39;s or their Mom&#39;s show size.<br />
<br />
Looking in a mirror, Kelsey thought she looked really ridiculous. She still looked practically the same, with just her hips being bairly wider and her waist bairly thinner. If anyone came in and saw her, she would be mistaken as crossdressing.<br />
<br />
Ally all of a sudden lifted up the dress and began inspecting Kelseys crotch. &quot;Ally, what the fuck are you doing!&quot; Shouted Kelsey, quickly pushing her dress back down.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry sis, Mom just texted me asking to check how along you dick is to disappearing so she can decide on whether or not she should get normal panties or some string ones which can be adjusted. Trust me. For 1, we are both girls, and 2, I don&#39;t think of you like that. But if we don&#39;t let her know, we both won&#39;t hear the end of it.&quot; Answered Ally in a monotone voice. Clearly she was just as annoyed as Kelsey was with their Mom&#39;s requests.  <br />
<br />
&quot;You could have just asked me, you know. You didn&#39;t have to look for yourself.&quot; Kelsey pointed out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom said she felt you would lie about it because of your manly pride or something. So she told me to check for myself, see.&quot; Ally held up her phone showing Melsey their Mom&#39;s text. It was as she said, Mom didn&#39;t trust that she would be honest about her shrinking dick. To be fair, Kelsey felt that she most likely would have exaggerated its size just like her Mom thought she would, so she couldn&#39;t really fault her too much for having Ally confirm.<br />
<br />
She always had been hardheaded about getting her way concerning a few things. One of them was naming children, another was getting answers while she was shopping. The only other thing she really was strict on was she has final say concerning sudden family affairs. Their dad mostly was fine with that, as were the both of them since it never really became much of a concern very often. But now she is using every single one of them to her fullest extent.<br />
<br />
She also was a bit out their in terms of decency. But that made a bit more sense since Kelsey learned her family was part chicken. But she worry that her mother&#39;s habit of always going commando may eventually rub off on her in the future. <br />
<br />
Now that Kelsey was fully &quot;redressed&quot;, the both of them moved into Kelsey&#39;s room. However Kelsey made a quick stop by her sister&#39;s garbage to fish out the coin from her old pants while Ally wasn&#39;t looking. But, now a new issue arose. Where could she hide it while she figured this whole thing out? She no longer had any pockets. And her bed was being removed, so under her pillow or in one of her pillow cases was not an option anymore. Maybe she could sneak it into her desk drawer while Ally wasn&#39;t paying attention?<br />
<br />
As Kelsey pondered this, she once again felt her stomach cramp. She knew internally, her body was undergowimg drastic changes. They were not in the least bit comfortable though. On the plus side though, her dress allowed her lower torso to not be constrained as much, and allowed her body to expand as it needed to without any additional discomforts. Plus she felt that the light colored dress looked really good contrasting against her dark tights. And they made her legs look great.<br />
<br />
Kelsey wasn&#39;t fully aware of it, but because of how her changes were effecting reality, her own mind was also slowly altering to be inline with her new female self. This was because she as well was under the effect of her own hypnosis, by accident. When she hypnotised Ally to lay an egg, the coin was reflected in the glass behind her. Which delayed the command&#39;s activation. She also got it again when she undid the other commands. But since she still was commanded to lay eggs, her body had to adjust in order to do so.</p>
