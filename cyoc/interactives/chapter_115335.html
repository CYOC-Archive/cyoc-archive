<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><br />
     Sitting gently on a fine couch was what you could only describe as an majestic large wolf. Your senses excitedly told you that it was female. It&#39;s fur was a deep sky blue and well groomed. Every movement it made naturally flowed like pure water and even the soft rising and sinking of its chest as it breathed seemed beautiful. Not to mention her sweet ocean scent that could&#39;ve driven you mad if you didn&#39;t have any self control.<br />
<br />
         You stared at her awkwardly, your mouth slightly gaping before realizing her electric blue eyes were straight on your deep green orbs.<br />
<br />
           If you could blush you would and though back in your own world you had never really liked wolves or any animals in general, you felt as small stirring in your groin as you felt your red canine member begin to push out of its captivity. Realizing that fur alone wouldn&#39;t hide it, you immediately use two of your four black tails to cover it as best you can.<br />
<br />
        The blue wolf does not seem to notice your struggle at all, her blue eyes examining both Master Harauphar and yourself with keen interest. Thankfully your Master finally breaks the small moment silence that felt like an eternity.<br />
<br />
   &quot;Ah, Organa, it has been months since I last saw you. Where is your Master? I believe I have much to share with him.&quot; He says matter of factly.<br />
<br />
    Organa&#39;s voice was like running water, soft and calm and you quickly decide to use another tail to cover yourself. You&#39;d never expected your constant animal nudity to become an issue.<br />
<br />
    &quot;Ah, Warlock Harauphar, Master Garthur has returned to his quarters in the castle though he wanted me to stay behind and wait for your arrival myself. He wished me to tell you that along with your report, Lord Hugenstore will also request to send you on another.... errand shall we say.&quot; Organa says, her voice so delicately soft and reserved.<br />
<br />
            Channeling your soul sight you saw that her soul was not what you expected either. It&#39;s icy power nearly blinded you with its glowing light as you peered deep into Organa&#39;s spirit.  Her soul was of a dark blue, emitting wisdom and knowledge continuously. You briefly thought how tasty her soul would be but shook that thought out of your mind, unless Master Harauphar ordered you to, Organa was likely to be off limits in terms of soul eating.... though another part of your mind wondered if the limits also covered a different kind of ravaging... even if there was a size difference between you two...<br />
<br />
     Organa giggled.<br />
<br />
     &quot;Thank you for the information Organa, if your master is still awake tell him I offer my hellos. However I believe you may or may not be wondering about my new familiar beside me. I will let him introduce himself.&quot; Master Harauphar said, gesturing towards you.<br />
<br />
<br />
    You stutter for a bit before speaking, making your voice as confident as you could. <br />
<br />
   &quot;Thank you Master Harauphar, I am Wraith, as you can tell I am a kitsune with the ability to consume souls, though I will admit my knowledge and skills in magic is at best inadequate. It is a pleasure to meet you Organa and I hope that our relationship in the near future will be cooperative.&quot; You say, giving a slight nod to your head as you do so.<br />
<br />
      Organa nods before introducing herself &quot;Likewise Wraith, I myself was curious what type of familiar Master Harauphar would create though in hindsight I will admit it was fairly obvious given Master Harauphar&#39;s profession. I am a ice wolf, a wolf from the northern lands descended from frost imps. In order to properly serve my master I have trained in various types of the arcane arts though I will say that my own speciality is frost magic.&quot; She explains. Now that she had said that you did notice a drift of cold air in the room You thought that the frigid temperature was from a lack of proper interior heating though you quickly realized that Organa herself was emitting the icy cold itself. <br />
<br />
   Was it a passive effect that she instinctively produced or was it intentional?<br />
<br />
   Organa smiled at you. As if pleased somehow.<br />
<br />
    &quot;Now that introduction have finished I will return to my own quarters, Wraith you may converse with Organa if you wish, once you are done, meet me at my quarters using your soul sight to track me down. Afterwards we will begin your training, we have about five hours left of nighttime before morning comes, so you&#39;ll only have a single hour at maximum, understand?&quot; Master Harauphar asks sternly.<br />
<br />
    You nod &quot;Understood Master Harauphar, after my conversation with Organa I will immediately  come to meet you.&quot;<br />
<br />
     Master Harauphar without saying a word, readjusts his bag and heads off into another room at the side, closing the door and leaving you two alone, his heavy footsteps ringing out loudly until they finally grow softer and eventually fade away. Several servants wander in and out of the lounge though they seem to pay no attention to you two. <br />
<br />
         Not wanting to be rude you walk up to the massive couch Organa herself was sitting on and gingerly jumped onto it, making sure to distance yourself for Organa before sitting down. By now your erection was at its full force and leaking but after some concentration and deep willpower you finally manage to make it shrink down, back into its sheath. Once again, Organa made no visible indication of noticing it. <br />
<br />
     Now up close to her, you could really see her massive size, while you were possibly the size of a average German Shepard, Organa easily towered over you with the mass of a dire wolf to the point of taking up most of the space on the large couch (which was the size of a queen bed for some strange reason, were large living beings common in this city?)<br />
<br />
     &quot;You told me you were novice in magic, so tell me Wraith, what magic do you plan to learn first, after all if you decide to pursue the magical arts, after your service to Harauphar is complete you could theoretically learn every type of magic if you do wished to.&quot; Organa said, a controlled curiousity in her voice.<br />
<br />
    &quot;Good question Organa, I myself am new to this world and do not know much about it and magic though I naturally plan to study fel magic to properly aid Master Harauphar as much as I can.&quot; You reply casually, not looking at Organa directly for fear of your erection coming back.<br />
<br />
      &quot;Fel magic is a very dangerous energy to harness Wraith, while I guarantee someone with skill like Harauphar will surely do his best to aid you, do be careful with experimenting with souls.&quot; Organa warned.<br />
<br />
      &quot;I am aware, though thank you for your concern, Master Harauphar already taught me its dangers and even had me read a book filled with dark magic to show me it&#39;s addictive effects.&quot;<br />
<br />
   &quot;Really? Now... that is dangerous, to show a fel book, even one with relatively low power is quite a massive danger even to a kitsune like yourself., are you sure you are feeling alright?&quot; Organa asked, this time with serious concern in her eyes.<br />
<br />
     &quot;I assure you I am mentally and physically fine Organa, Master Harauphar oversaw the whole process and said the effects would wear off in a day, since then I have not read the book nor any magical book since. Do not worry, I am sure that my Master has everything under complete control.&quot; You assured Organa, though deep down a paranoid fear deep strike your stomach. Harauphar wasn&#39;t the sanest of men, but would be really be as wreckless to do something like that? No of course not. You told yourself. You shouldn&#39;t make worried assumptions out of nothing, especially when you have no real in depth knowledge of magic itself.<br />
<br />
       You and Organa have a conversation for about another thirty minutes and slowly you see the worry cease in her eyes, soon you share jokes and laughs as if you were friends. You both talked about the city, about Lord Hugenstore who apparently was a greedy pig whose only upside was his intelligent mind, according to Organa atleast. Lord Hugenstore was the second oldest brother in a trio of three and is known for his interest of magical research and his intense rivalry with his older brother who was the King of the nation and was able to ascend to the throne first due to his age.<br />
<br />
     Lord Hugenstore takes every opportunity he can to embarrass his brother and show off his own skills. However despite these flaws and his obvious weight problem, and his lazy attitude in general, Hugenstore is said to be one of the most intelligent minds in the country and because of his talents the country&#39;s economy managed to increase drastically within a decade. <br />
<br />
         You also talked about the city itself and its inner workings and factories, you learned a lot about the automation process of magical items and several magical discoveries as well.<br />
<br />
   Eventually you say your goodbyes to Organa, telling her you&#39;d have to meet with your Master soon and gave her a warm goodbye before leaving the room. Using your soul sight like Harauphar instructed, you pinpoint the ominous dark green of Master Harauphar&#39;s soul and begin to head your way there.</p>
