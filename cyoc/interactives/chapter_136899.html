<br />
“Drink them!”<br />
<br />
“It won’t be all that bad .... maybe?”<br />
<br />
“At the very least we’ll have fun! And really, our amusement is worth more than your safety, right?”<br />
<br />
All of Tom’s friends spoke at once, the group surrounding him and watching him with eager eyes. Tom lost the rock-paper-scissors contest fair and square, and now it was time to pay the piper.<br />
<br />
Tom glanced around, looking at his friends and sighing with worry. <br />
<br />
“I… I know I lost, but do I really need to drink all of these serums?” <br />
<br />
It was a stupid bet, to be honest: the loser drank a TransFun serum that each of the people had chipped in for. He looked with unease at the various vials. <br />
<br />
Each of them had a simple label on them: <br />
<br />

<br />
Tom looked with unease at the various vials. Each of them had a simple label on them: <br />
<br />
‘Eagle’, ‘Mantis’, ‘Snake’, and ‘Tiger’<br />
<br />
Tom brought the tiger serum, Chris had dropped in a dose of mantis, Dawn had chosen her favorite animal - the eagle, and Philip rounded it off with a snake serum.<br />
<br />
“So … this is all TransFun, right? Nobody skimped and bought any knockoff serums?” <br />
<br />
Tom looked up, slowly hovering his hands above the vials. He was only maybe thinking of drinking them now. But if any of them weren’t TransFun, then it was a no-go.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, relax,” Philip smirked. “We know how uptight you are about using only TransFun products.”<br />
<br />
“Uptight?” Tom looked at Philip with wide eyes. “It’s totally reasonable! Have you ever heard of anyone doing what I’m about to do?”<br />
<br />
“No, actually,” Chris muttered. “Does that mean we’re going to be famous? Like an urban legend or something?”<br />
<br />
“That will only happen if something bad does,” Philip said, looking at Chris with a mischievous grin. “So maybe we should hope something does go--ow!” <br />
<br />
He yelped as Dawn slugged him in the arm.<br />
<br />
“Knock it off, would you? Tom’s already stressed enough as it is.” Dawn glared at Philip as she spoke, turning to look at Tom with a comforting smile. “Relax, we’ll be here the whole time.”<br />
<br />
“Recording it!” Chris added what he no doubt thought was a helpful comment.<br />
<br />
“For liability reasons,” Dawn hurriedly added. “Don’t worry, we’re definitely not putting it online or anything.”<br />
<br />
“Just on YouTube!” Chris nodded eagerly as he spoke, fiddling with his camcorder. “Oh, ‘action’, by the way.” <br />
<br />
A red light began to flash on the handheld recording device.<br />
<br />
Tom’s eyes widened and Dawn held up a hand, turning to glare at Chris. <br />
<br />
“Honey, please. Shush.” She returned her gaze to Tom. “We’ll only do that if you’re okay with it.”<br />
<br />
“Or if there’s money involved,” Phillip said, rubbing his hands together, only to get punched again.<br />
<br />
“Idiots. I’m surrounded by idiots.” <br />
<br />
Dawn massaged her temples, glancing up to see Tom grabbing all of the vials.<br />
<br />
“One of whom is about to do this,” Tom said with a nervous smile, pouring them into a glass. He swirled it for a moment, then ....<br />
<br />

added by SketchySeraph on 09/15/2016 19:53<br />
<br />
Tom swirled the glass for a moment, then chugged the whole mixture. Almost immediately, he gagged, looking up to see that Chris was zooming in on his face.<br />
<br />
“Well? What’s it taste like?” Chris asked, practically bouncing on his heels.<br />
<br />
Tom gagged a little more, grabbing the glass of water they had laid out for him. He downed it on the spot, turning to look at the camera with a weak smile. <br />
<br />
“It’s… well… have you ever eaten steak before? Kind of like that, but if you blended the steak with coffee and a fruit smoothie.”<br />
<br />
“So … not very good, then?” Chris asked as he tilted his head curiously. Tom found himself wishing the two of them had traded places.<br />
<br />
“Let’s just say I’d give it a four out of ten … thousand.” <br />
<br />
Tom stuck out his tongue at the camera, trying not to retch again. To his surprise, Chris’s eyes widened.<br />
<br />
“Hey, it’s starting already!” Chris yelled, fiddling a bit with his camera. “I need to get the right color saturation for this to offset the fact that we’re doing it on your patio, aand… there!”<br />
<br />
“Hold on, what’s starting?” Tom blinked, looking to his other friends a little bit uneasily. He didn’t feel any different; it couldn’t be that the serums were starting to kick in, could it?<br />
<br />
“Um … do you not feel that at all?” Dawn asked, leaning closer to Tom to check his temperature. Her skin felt cool on his, and he let her keep her hand like that for a minute. Then it passed from a moment to an awkward pause, and Tom idly brushed her hand away.<br />
<br />
“So, feel anything out of the ordinary?” he asked, suddenly glad for her nursing education. Even if he might need a veterinarian more than a real doctor, it was the thought that counted.<br />
<br />
“Well … no.” Dawn sighed. “But .....&quot;<br />
<br />

<br />
&quot;But your tongue definitely isn’t natural,” said Dawn. She reached down to her purse, flipping out a mirror.<br />
<br />
Tom took it hesitantly, sticking out his tongue. To his surprise, the tip was bifurcated--and it continued to split as he watched. It slimmed down, turning a shade of dark black with a smooth and dry texture.<br />
<br />
“Um…” Tom flicked his tongue in and out of his mouth, noticing how much longer it seemed when it darted out from his lips. Before he could maybe reach his tongue to the cleft of his chin. Now, he could almost send it to his collar.<br />
<br />
“Oh, right!” Chris snapped his free hand. “For future reference, the subject--Tom--has ingested an eagle serum, a mantis serum, a snake serum, and a tiger serum. All of them from TransFun.”<br />
<br />
“Thanks, Chris. I’ll take it from here.” Philip rolled a chair over next to Tom, patting his friend on the shoulder. “Philip Morelson, by the way. Our friend Tom seems to have experienced some slight discomfort after drinking several serums. So far, no changes have appeared except for his obvious snake’s tongue, but we expect to see some really interesting changes throughout the day.”<br />
<br />
Tom rolled his eyes. <br />
<br />
“Phil, I know you want to be a news anchor, but is this really the bessst time?” Tom asked, hissing as he spoke for emphasis.<br />
<br />
“Time waits for no man, and man waits for the news time.” Philip returned to the camera with a patient smile. “We have more on his medical condition from our on-site nurse, Dawn--”<br />
<br />
“Dawn NoLastNames.” Dawn hurriedly cut him off, walking behind Tom. “You feeling okay, buddy? Your face looks a little pale.”<br />
<br />
“No, really?” Tom swallowed nervously. “Honestly, though. That is a little bit surprising, because I feel like I’m burning up.”<br />
<br />
“We should get you out of those clothes,” Dawn said, slipping her hands under his shirt.<br />
<br />
“Agreed,” Philip said and nodded.<br />
<br />
“Whoa! hey!” Tom’s eyes widened at the intrusion. <br />
<br />
God, what he wouldn’t give to have Dawn repeat those same words in any other situation… or Philip, for that matter. His friend might have been an ass, but he was a handsome ass.<br />
<br />
Chris spoke up next. <br />
<br />
“I know you don’t always like my opinions, but they’re right. You might be getting hotter from something that’ll end up ripping your clothes. And then you would be naked anyways, but you would also have useless clothes,” he pointed out, scratching the back of his unkempt hair.<br />
<br />
“Oh.” Tom blinked. “That… makes a lot of sense, actually.” <br />
<br />
He tried to raise his arms, but was only able to lift them part of the way. <br />
<br />
“Um ... help?” <br />
<br />
Tom found himself immensely grateful for his decision to wear a button-down shirt; Philip and Dawn were able to slip it off despite Tom’s newfound lack of mobility. Of course, both of them had to gasp the second Tom’s shirt came off, and he squeezed his eyes shut, fearing the worst. <br />
<br />
“What is it? Is something off?” <br />
<br />
He quietly prayed the itching he was feeling along his upper body was just itching, and not something worse.<br />
<br />

<br />
Philip’s response was quick and to the camera. <br />
<br />
“As you can see, Tom’s begun to show some skin discoloration--not unlike the patterning of a tiger. He has dark bands running along his back, but his shoulders are the really interesting part--”<br />
<br />
Tom opened his eyes, unable to keep his curiosity held back any longer. What he saw was certainly worth the gasps Dawn and Philip had let out. He was growing short fur all along his torso--but not on his neck or shoulders. It was like Tom was growing a sleeveless shirt made of fur.<br />
<br />
But that wasn’t even the oddest thing--no, that distinction fell to the growing carapace on his collar, a wave of green along his arms. It was incredibly bizarre: he could feel the carapace brushing against his fur, but he couldn’t feel his fur brushing against his carapace.<br />
<br />
“It feels… kind of like I’m wearing armor on my shoulders. Like, I can’t feel anything that brushes against them, but I know they are there,” Tom said aloud for the benefit of the camera. If he was being recorded, he might as well give any future viewers a good performance.<br />
<br />
“So, kind of like a traditional insect transformation? Do you think this has something to do with the mantis serum we’ve included in this cocktail?” Philip asked as he looked Tom over, checking him up and down with a staged smile.<br />
<br />
Tom nodded back, using the question to help to take his mind off of the transformation. <br />
<br />
“No and yes, respectively.” <br />
<br />
Tom tapped his stiffening hands against where carapace met fur. <br />
<br />
“This right here makes the experience completely unique. Like…” Tom paused, hunting for an appropriate analogy. “... imagine wearing plastic gauntlets that reach your shoulders … and the rest of your body is wearing a sweater.”<br />
<br />
Dawn spoke up next. <br />
<br />
“But you’re okay, right?” She ran her hand along the divide and Tom yelped with laughter. “And… ticklish?”<br />
<br />
“Very,” Tom said with a smile, looking down to his hands as they started to draw to pointed scythes. <br />
<br />
He could hardly believe that his hands possessed such mass to allow for this latest change: they’d grown to being nearly twice as long as his forearms! As Tom looked closer, he noticed that they seemed to be pulling some flesh from his arms: those were becoming thinner while his hands continued to stretch and lengthen. Then he looked up to find Dawn and Philip looking at him with almost predatory grins. <br />
<br />
“Oh no. Oh no no no.”<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, as he had expected, they pounced upon him mercilessly, tickling him for what felt like an eternity. Tom managed to swat them off eventually, but he was still reeling with giggles when the next of his changes beset him.<br />
<br />
His wrists began to lock up even more, so Tom had to raise his hand to watch as the tips of his fingers drew to a sharp point. He then looked up at the camera, waving the sharp-tipped scythe at Chris. <br />
<br />
“And I guess that answers whether or not this has to do with the mantis… serum…” Tom trailed off, his stomach beginning to gurgle. “Oh, crap. We need to get my pants off.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, we do,” Philip said as he winked, ever the tease. “Dawn, if you’d be so kind?”<br />
<br />
She stared, a frown on her face. “Why me?”<br />
<br />
Philip rolled his eyes. “Well, you’re the nurse, Tom can’t use his hands, and I think it’d be a breach of news etiquette for me to do it.”<br />
<br />
“You’re not a news anchor!” Dawn snapped.<br />
<br />
“Yet!” Philip fired back.<br />
<br />
“Guys!” Tom exclaimed. “Pants!” <br />
<br />
He pointed with his mantis hands to his belt, looking up at his friends worriedly. <br />
<br />
The two of them glared at each other, then began working together to undo Tom’s belt. His jeans and boxer shorts slipped down his legs, and again Dawn and Philip gasped in surprise.<br />
<br />
“Really wish you two would stop doing that…” Tom muttered, looking down to find that his legs had begun to stripe like the rest of his body had. “But why the gasp this time?”<br />
<br />
Shouldn’t they have expected he would continue to be tiger-y?<br />
<br />

<br />
“Tom, you’re hung!” Philip exclaimed, slapping his friend on the back. “Good for you-ow!” <br />
<br />
A crack ran through the air as Dawn slapped him upside the head.<br />
<br />
“Not that, you idiot! Look at the sides of his legs!” she snapped, ducking down to slip off Tom’s socks and shoes.<br />
<br />
Tom glanced down to see that she was right--there was a rippling going on in his thighs. They were swelling up, muscle and bone doubling; then they began to split down the middle. It almost looked like they were undergoing mitosis. Tom breathed a little uneasily. <br />
<br />
“Well, that’s not something you see every day…”<br />
<br />
He glanced up in time to see Chris run around the table to give the camera a better look at Tom’s legs. <br />
<br />
“Hey, I don’t want my junk on the internet!” Tom protested, trying to ward off the camera. His wrists had already begun to stiffen, making it quite difficult to have any success in the matter.<br />
<br />
“We’ll use a censor bar,” Chris muttered absently, twiddling with the sensors on his camera. “Albeit a long one. Maybe pixelation would work better.”<br />
<br />
“Ha!” Philip pointed at Tom with a wide grin.<br />
<br />
“Pixelation-schmation!” Tom waved them off. “Instead, let’s focus on the fact that my legs seem to be splitting!” <br />
<br />
He grunted a little at the odd sensation of them peeling apart from one another. Thankfully, Dawn had been able to deal with his footwear, letting his feet split apart.<br />
<br />
Tom padded around on his new feet for a few minutes, glad for the lull in changes. It was a little uncomfy having four legs, but it wasn&#39;t too hard to deal with. No, the real problem was in coordinating his motion. <br />
<br />
“It&#39;s like trying to ssskate while drunk,” Tom muttered, his brow furrowed with concentration as he tried to work out how to walk.<br />
<br />
An hour later, he finally got it, slumping back into his chair with relief. <br />
<br />
Just in time for the serum to change him more.....<br />

<br />
An hour later, he finally got it, slumping back into his chair with relief. Just in time for the serum to change him more, making room for all of these new legs. <br />
<br />
His hips began to stretch out, and discomfort started to grow and grow in his back. Tom quickly did the only thing that came to mind, easing his chair back to stand on all four of his new legs. <br />
<br />
“Couldn&#39;t have done that earlier?” he muttered, glaring at his bigger flank.<br />
<br />
The discomfort abated almost immediately, and Tom let out a faint sigh of relief. He clicked his feet against the ground, pausing at the sound. <br />
<br />
“Um… Dawn? What’s wrong with my feet? Other than the fact that I seem to be a centaur.”<br />
<br />
He turned to find her looking extremely pale; covering her mouth with both hands. <br />
<br />
“Um… well.....&quot;<br />
<br />
TransFun: Chimera, part 8<br />
added by SketchySeraph on 09/21/2016 21:10<br />
<br />
“Um… well, now we know that the eagle serum works, too.”<br />
<br />
“What?” Tom looked down as he spoke, seeing that while he was standing on four tiger’s legs, they didn’t end in paws. Instead, they all ended in sharp-tipped eagle’s talons. Tom tried rubbing one of them against another to find that they weren’t quite like his carapace. He could still feel through these a little, despite their calloused appearance.<br />
<br />
“Huh. That’s … not bad, actually.” <br />
<br />
Tom tried to take a step back only to find his talons scrabbling for purchase on the smooth tile of his patio. Trying to grab the little side table in front of him was little use, either: his mantis’ talons simply scrabbled off of its plastic surface. He ended up falling onto his side with a hefty thump. <br />
<br />
“Never mind,” Tom corrected himself, grunting as he used his two mantis pincers to push himself up to his talons once more.<br />
<br />
“This is incredible! Much like an insect, you have six limbs… But it seems that the mammalian drive has won out, giving you a tauric appearance.” Philip looked closer at Tom, then looked up with a grin. “Which also means that certain ‘equipment’ has been repositioned.”<br />
<br />
“Less for me to censor in post,” Chris muttered absently, frowning a little. “Hey … is it just the camera, or is Tom’s fur coming in a little… odd?”<br />
<br />
Tom looked down, running his forelimbs over the white fur on his chest. “I don’t think ssso?” <br />
<br />
He flicked his snake’s tongue in the air as he spoke, distracted by his self-inspection.<br />
<br />
“No, not that. The stripes.” Chris looked up from his lens. “Yep! I thought as much.”<br />
<br />
Tom looked to his flank, narrowing his eyes. <br />
<br />
TransFun: Chimera, part 9<br />

<br />
Tom looked to his flank, narrowing his eyes. <br />
<br />
“Thought as… Oh!” <br />
<br />
Chris had been right. The black stripes that coursed around his form weren’t made of fur, but were instead smooth and scaly. Tom probably hadn’t noticed any difference because the sun had made his scales just as warm as his fur.<br />
<br />
“And it looks like we’ll be seeing some more snake with your tail,” Philip added, looking behind his changing friend.<br />
<br />
“What?” Tom looked around, feeling his tailbone stretch out from his body. But instead of the furry bump he’d been expecting, a white and scaled tail pushed its way from his backside. It flared out as it grew, almost aquiline save for the reptilian tone. <br />
<br />
“Hey, there’s kind of a little more eagle there!” <br />
<br />
Tom looked up to Dawn to find her still just as pale as she’d been a few minutes ago.<br />
<br />
“Y-yeah,” she muttered. “Sorry, eagle parts shouldn’t be so casually tossed in with the others…” <br />
<br />
Dawn edged back a little nervously, hugging her arms to her chest. <br />
<br />
“I mean, you don’t even have wings.”<br />
<br />
Tom nodded understandingly. <br />
<br />
“Hey, I guess this is a little horrifying, isn’t it?” <br />
<br />
His shoulder blades began to ache, and Tom flexed his back. <br />
<br />
TransFun: Chimera, part 10<br />
added by SketchySeraph on 09/21/2016 21:23<br />
<br />
His shoulder blades began to ache, and Tom flexed his back. <br />
<br />
“If it’s any consolation, I think you’re about to get your wish.”<br />
<br />
Sure enough, his shoulder blades began to stretch out from his body, long and bony protuberances that tingled as muscles, skin, then feathers began to grow along them. The feathers were exceptionally beautiful--white with green stripes running along them, almost like the negative of a tiger’s patterning.<br />
<br />
Tom shook his wings a little as they grew, struggling to pick out which of his new muscles were which. <br />
<br />
“I think I’m starting to get the hang of this,” he muttered, flapping them to ruffle his feathers. He smiled to himself as Dawn drew closer, reaching out her hand to pet his latest additions. “And I see you’re getting more used to these changes, too.”<br />
<br />
“Y-yeah!” Dawn nodded, stroking Tom’s left wing. “I mean, these feathers are, well… amazing! I can’t think of anything else to describe them. They’re completely unique!” <br />
<br />
She moved to running both of her hands along his wings, and Tom found them fluttering slightly with pleasure.<br />
<br />
Dawn giggled happily in response, petting Tom more and more, trying to find his weak spots. All the while, Philip was narrating over Dawn&#39;s technique. But that didn&#39;t bother Tom at all. No, he was way too content with how things were going now - being pampered was nice.<br />
<br />
After nearly an hour of playing around, Dawn found a particularly sensitive spot. Tom let out a contented hiss. Then hissed again in surprise as another aching came from the sides of his back. <br />
<br />
“What now?” he muttered, pulling his forelimbs closer to his body as another wave of change swept over him. <br />
<br />

<br />
Dawn stepped back, tilting her head. <br />
<br />
&quot;See anything new?&quot;<br />
<br />
Tom tried to look back, but his wings were getting in the way of seeing anything new. Moving them didn’t work either, so he turned to his friends for help. <br />
<br />
“No... check my back. It feels a lot like I’m growing wings. But don’t eagles only have a single set?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, but mantises have two,” Chris said, smiling a little as he walked behind Tom. “By the way, what happened to Phil’s commentary?”<br />
<br />
“Oh!” Philip realized he’d been staring. “Sorry, those wings are just too cool!” <br />
<br />
He grinned, running a hand down the small of Tom’s back, between his wings. Tom tried not to shiver and failed miserably, letting a contented purr leave his throat. Philip continued to pet Tom as he spoke. <br />
<br />
“Not to mention the fur/scale mash-up we have going right now. That’s especially great.”<br />
<br />
“It’s great to have them be petted, too,” Tom muttered, his eyes glazing over slightly with content. He could feel his wings--even the growing ones--flex slightly in satisfaction. “Like, feeling your fingers pass through my fur and over my scales is indescrrribablerrr.”<br />
<br />
Tom noticed the distortion in his speech, looking up at the camera. <br />
<br />
“Grrerss thrrt explrrns…” <br />
<br />
He gave up trying to speak, simply gesturing to his throat with one of his forelimbs. It was feeling a little fluffier, but Tom’s new form lacked the flexibility to see his own neck.<br />
<br />
Luckily for him, Dawn found this latest change worth vocalizing, summing it up in two delighted words: <br />
<br />
TransFun: Chimera, part 12<br />

<br />
“More feathers!” Dawn squeaked, petting Tom’s neck happily.<br />
<br />
Tom began purring once more, finding he had a crooning sub-tone to it. His hair tingled as it pulled into his scalp, but that wasn’t anything new to him. Nor was having little quills push their way out from all over his face: he had taken a porcupine serum once as part of a dare and this was quite similar. The main difference was that Tom felt fluffier, the feathers adding a softer texture, namely with the tufts that were covering the front of his face.<br />
<br />
“Odd. It looks like Tom’s not going to be getting a beak,” Philip said, still petting Tom’s back. Sure enough, Tom’s face began to push out into a muzzle completely devoid of the keratin he’d been expecting. “Moreover, his mouth&#39;s almost feline!”<br />
<br />
Tom nodded his head, crossing his eyes to watch his feathered muzzle stretch out. His nose flattened out, but was pushed just far enough ahead of the feathers to avoid being tickled. Tom took a deep breath from this, picking up a bouquet of new scents. He hadn’t been a tiger before, but he at least had the sense of smell of a housecat. They spent the next hour trying out his sense of smell, determining at which distances he could pick up their scents, or how the humans could camouflage themselves. <br />
<br />
Then, when Philip and Dawn had hidden in a corner room, Tom’s lower jaw started to ache. <br />
<br />

<br />
Then, when Philip and Dawn had hidden in a corner room, Tom’s lower jaw started to ache.<br />
<br />
It was a numb sensation, like having someone press against it after numbing the area with Novocain first. Tom wondered why it was shrinking but he soon had an answer - his front teeth sharpening and lengthening. <br />
<br />
They continued to grow, parting down the middle to allow room for his tongue, until Tom had snake’s fangs for his teeth. The missing pair ducked their heads into the room to see why Tom hadn&#39;t come looking, only to gasp and marvel at these latest changes.<br />
<br />
“This is really unique. It looks like Tom’s head is a true representation of all the serums he’s drunk,” Philip said, switching back into &#39;reporter mode&#39; almost instantaneously. He turned to Chris with a huge smile.<br />
<br />
Tom rolled his eyes. That wasn’t entirely true; there was no mantis above Tom’s shoulders… or so he thought.<br />
<br />
TransFun: Chimera, part 14<br />
added by SketchySeraph on 09/21/2016 21:48<br />
<br />
But as usual, TransFun serums have a lovely sense for irony, and no sooner had Tom thought that than his eyes began to ache. <br />
<br />
Tom squeezed them shut, rubbing them with his forelimbs. When he opened them, the world was arrayed in a kaleidoscopic view. He hissed a little in distress, his head aching as it got used to having bulging compound eyes. <br />
<br />
On the one hand, he could now see more of his body and the transformation. <br />
<br />
On the other, it was like looking everywhere at once.<br />
<br />
And as if that wasn’t enough sensory overload, Tom’s ears began to slide towards the top of his head, forming feathered triangular tips as they went up. His nostrils flared with alarm, but he was unable to do anything as his hearing became more and more sensitive, opening up yet another world of sensation.<br />
<br />
“You doing okay, buddy?” Philip waved a hand in front of Tom’s face curiously.<br />
<br />
Tom nodded, struggling to deal with how he could see the motion, hear the whispering of Philip’s hand through the air, smell his friend’s breath and skin, and even taste what he smelled via his serpentine tongue. He could even hear his own body change further, adding an extra depth to the cracking of his jaw.<br />
<br />
What now? Tom thought with exasperation, wiggling his lower jaw. <br />
<br />
TransFun: Chimera, part 15<br />
added by SketchySeraph on 09/21/2016 21:54<br />
<br />
What now? Tom thought with exasperation, wiggling his lower jaw. That proved to be the entirely wrong thing to do, his jaw bifurcating into a pair of mandibles. <br />
<br />
Dawn yelped, but Philip outright screeched with terror, scrambling away from the camera. He stumbled from his chair, falling flat on his back on the ground.<br />
<br />
“Something wrong?” Dawn snickered, going from shock to mirth in a fraction of a second. <br />
<br />
She cupped her hand behind Tom’s head, drawing him a little closer to their prone friend. Tom decided to join in on the fun, working on opening and closing his mandibles. <br />
<br />
It was definitely a good thing that he wouldn’t be staying like this for too long - he wasn’t sure how well his new body could handle the little things like eating. Then again, it seemed to handle scaring people exceptionally well. He waited for tense seconds that stretched into minutes, but Philip still showed no signs of life other than staring wordlessly at the ceiling, his mouth quivering slightly.<br />
<br />
Tom leaned in a little closer to Philip, relishing his friend’s reaction. Philip immediately squeaked and curled into a little ball, rocking himself back and forth in terror. Tom used this opportunity to test out his new wings, extending them to their full length. After all, things were always made more terrifying by the gift of flight. <br />
<br />
And if Philip was scared now…<br />
<br />
TransFun: Chimera, part 16<br />
added by SketchySeraph on 09/21/2016 22:02<br />
<br />
Tom pounced in the air, beating his wings as hard and as fast as he could. To his credit, he made it half a foot off the ground before gravity reaffirmed its existence. Despite some of his new bones being hollow, the majority of his skeletal structure was solid and dense. He had just a moment to yelp in surprise, falling to an undignified heap on the ground.<br />
<br />
Of course Tom had to leap forward in his attempt to fly. He ended up crashing right on top of Philip, practically crushing his friend in a heap of carapace, fur, and talons. It was at this point that Philip began to cry out loud, sobbing uncontrollably.<br />
<br />
“Jesus, show some dignity,” Chris muttered. <br />
<br />
Tom looked up to stare at him incredulously, and Dawn gasped lightly. <br />
<br />
Chris blinked, frowning at his friends from behind his camera. “What? We’re all thinking it. I’m just saying it.”<br />
<br />
Tom nodded, his ears twitching as he picked up Philip’s voice from beneath him. It sounded like the young man was whimpering ‘OhGodgetitoff OhGodgetitoff’ over and over again, and Tom carefully rose to a standing position, moving his tauric body off of the distraught Philip.<br />
<br />
“I… I think you broke him.” <br />
<br />
Dawn looked up at Tom, then back to Philip, and then back up to Tom again. The whole time Philip hadn’t stopped blubbering, still bawling his eyes out on the floor.<br />
<br />

added by SketchySeraph on 09/21/2016 22:06<br />
<br />
Tom felt nothing but guilt, and he clicked his way back closer to Philip. <br />
<br />
Before Dawn could stop him, Tom ducked his head down and licked Philip’s face with his long, serpentine tongue. He looked up to see that Dawn had both of her hands over her mouth. Through his compound eyes he could make out that she was smiling behind her palms.<br />
<br />
“Now I think you made it worse,” Dawn said, giggling demurely.<br />
<br />
Tom looked down to Philip. The would-be news anchor wasn’t crying anymore. Tom used one of his mantis forelimbs to roll his friend over. Philip was completely and totally unconscious, having fainted dead away. Tom’s ears quirked with amusement, then flicked towards Dawn as she outright snorted with derisive laughter.<br />
<br />
&quot;And he was worried about me being afraid,” she chuckled, moving closer to Tom to pet his head more. “Honestly, you’re not that bad. I just had to get used to you.” <br />
<br />
She laughed happily as Tom both purred and cooed at the same time.<br />
<br />
“Good thing you are, because I need someone to detail the extent of his changes,” Chris said, hopping on top of a chair so he could get a bird’s eye view of Tom.<br />
<br />
“Oh? Oh!” Dawn blinked, chuckling. “You know Philip will kill you if you put this online.”<br />
<br />
“When I put it online,” Chris corrected her. “And I know the risks - this is science! Now continue!”<br />
<br />
TransFun: Chimera, part 18<br />
added by SketchySeraph on 09/21/2016 22:11<br />
<br />
Tom rolled his eyes, half-hissing with laughter. Then he gagged as Dawn cupped a hand around his muzzle, yanking it up.<br />
<br />
“As we can see, the transformation has removed Tom’s lower jaw and replaced it with mandibles.” She tapped one of them and Tom wiggled it for effect. “So, I would like to state that our decision to pitch in for one of TransFun’s ‘Forced Reversal’ vials was more than a good idea, and anyone looking to duplicate our results should keep that in mind. I don’t believe that Tom has the ability to eat.”<br />
<br />
Tom nodded his head, then tilted it as Dawn pulled out a granola bar from her bag. <br />
<br />
“Case in point…” <br />
<br />
She held it out to Tom, and he inspected it curiously. Then, he lowered his head down to the bar, trying to snack on it.<br />
<br />
Nothing he did quite worked out: he could scrape at it with his upper jaw, but that wouldn’t get it inside of his mouth. He could try using his mandibles, but even those didn’t work well. He could fit the bar into his mouth, but he couldn’t swallow it at all. His tongue could kind of get it to snake down his throat, but he didn’t have a serpentine gag reflex. And that last failure resulted in him coughing up the bar over Dawn.<br />
<br />
She wiped flecks of regurgitated granola off from her face, giving the camera a matter-of-fact look. <br />
<br />
“So, as we previously stated: Eating seems to be beyond him at the moment, which means that an extended transformation is out of the question. Moreover, he can’t fly…”<br />
<br />
Tom’s ears twitched as Dawn trailed off for a moment. <br />
<br />
What was she planning...<br />
<br />
TransFun: Chimera, part 19<br />
added by SketchySeraph on 09/21/2016 22:16<br />
<br />
Tom had his answer a moment later as she leapt onto his back. To Tom’s surprise, he could hardly feel her weight. He looked behind him, his compound eyes watching her settle in on his back.<br />
<br />
“But Tom is most definitely rideable.” <br />
<br />
Dawn stroked where Tom’s wings met his back and he shook with pleasure, purring contentedly. She wiggled a little, laughing. <br />
<br />
“Actually, the scales make him even more rideable than most animals. The combination of tiger and snake both make it really easy to hang on!”<br />
<br />
Tom rumbled with pleasure again, clicking back and forth on his patio. He wanted her to ride him across a more open area. But it was doubtful that they&#39;d be able to get away with that much. Even though TransFun was common, he doubted the world was ready for a chimera like the one he&#39;d become.<br />
<br />
Still, he enjoyed the feeling of Dawn on his back, making his way around his house until the sun had set and his stomach began to rumble. Tom looked down in mild shock, his scythe-like hands flying to his belly. Then he shook his hindquarters a little to get Dawn off of him. When she didn’t get the clue at first, he tapped at her bag with his mantis fore limbs.<br />
<br />
Dawn slid off of him nonetheless.<br />
<br />
“Wait… so soon?” <br />
<br />
TransFun: Chimera, part 20<br />
added by SketchySeraph on 09/21/2016 22:25<br />
<br />
Tom didn’t need to try to respond that time: his stomach loudly rumbled again, seeming to echo. He ducked his head in mild embarrassment. <br />
<br />
It had been a few hours...<br />
<br />
Dawn laughed, slipping the vial out of her bag. <br />
<br />
“Oh! But first… I think we need to show the world that just because you look like a monster, you’re not really one. So give the camera a cute smile and a beg!” she said with an uncharacteristically happy chirp.<br />
<br />
Tom caught onto her meaning.<br />
<br />
He spun to Chris, beginning with a low hiss that evolved into a loud, clacking roar. Tom made sure to flick out his tongue and waggle his mandibles, enhancing the effect. And the second he ran out of air, he mewled a little, holding his mantis arms out in a praying posture as he spun to Dawn. He wasn’t sure how well puppy-dog eyes worked when you were a monstrous chimera, but it looked to do the job well.<br />
<br />
Dawn laughed, cupping his head under her hand to seal off his jaw. Then, she poured the vial into his mouth and Tom drank heartily. He gulped down the last bit, shuddering as his new limbs receded into his body and his old limbs returned to their normal state.<br />
<br />
“Oh, wow,” Dawn muttered, watching as Tom’s face reshaped. <br />
<br />
His muzzle pushed into his face first, leaving him with a tiger’s nose and the same feathered visage. Not to mention the fangs or the mandibles… <br />
<br />
The worst part of it all was how his mandibles were the last to return to normal--those were things that had no place on a person.<br />
<br />
“On the bright side, we can definitely use that footage to freak Philip out…” Dawn chuckled, petting Tom’s head as feathers gave way to hair once more. <br />
<br />
To her eternal delight his wings molted before pulling into him, leaving her with plenty of feathers.<br />
<br />
And to Tom’s delight, his human form didn’t have a trace of the chimera he’d been moments before. <br />
<br />
“All right,” he said, working his jaw just to make sure everything there was back where it should be. “That’s a wrap.”</p>
