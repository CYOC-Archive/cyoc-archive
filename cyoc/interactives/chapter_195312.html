<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Hey, I’m getting the hang of th-WOAH WOAH WOAH FUCK!”<br />
<br />
<b>THUD</b><br />
<br />
Todd awoke with a jolt at the sound of something heavy hitting the floor. Panicking, he began looking around the room to see if anything had fallen and broken…but everything was…fine? <br />
<br />
“Mornin’ Todd…”<br />
<br />
The young man looked down to see Sam sitting there, rubbing his side. <br />
<br />
“S-Sam? Wh-What are…what are you d-doing?”<br />
<br />
“Put your glasses on and see for yourself.”<br />
<br />
Todd reached for his glasses on the nightstand and slipped them on his face. He blinked a few times to get the sleep out of his eyes before looking back down at Sam. <br />
<br />
Sam’s lower body had <i>drastically</i> changed overnight. For starters, his “feet” were no longer feet; they were massive, four digit paws, complete with thick, black paw pads. His legs, meanwhile, had shifted into a digitigrade structure. His entire lower body was covered in snowy white fur with black stripes along the outside of his legs. <br />
<br />
“Woah…y-your legs…”<br />
<br />
“Pretty neat, huh?” Sam asked. “They’re a bit weird to walk on at first, but it’s honestly not too much different from walking on your toes.”<br />
<br />
“That’s not all. Check this out!” Sam seemed to curl the digits of his paws, and Todd watched in amazement as claws came out of them. He unflexed them, and the claws retreated back into his paws. “Retractable claws!”<br />
<br />
“Th-Those are…so c-cool,” Todd said. “You…you think I’ve ch-changed at all?”<br />
<br />
“Totally man! Let’s see what’s different!” Sam hoisted himself up off the ground and stood by Todd’s bed, his tail flicking occasionally. Todd grabbed his comforter and gave Sam an affirmative nod. <br />
<br />
“On th-three,” he said. “One…two…three!” Todd threw back his covers on three. It didn’t take him or Sam long to figure out what had changed. <br />
<br />
Just like Sam, Todd’s lower body had changed over the course of the night. His feet had become four digit canine paws with thick, black paw pads on the bottom. His legs had shifted into a digitigrade structure, and his entire lower body up to his waist was covered in midnight black fur. <br />
<br />
“Woah…”<br />
<br />
“Oh! Check down there!” Sam pointed at Todd’s boxers, which made the young man blush. Taking a small peek, Todd was surprised to find a furry black sheath in place of his cock. He was tempted to see what his new equipment looked like, but he wasn’t going to do that with Sam right next to him.<br />
<br />
“Well?” Sam asked. “Anything different?”<br />
<br />
“Y-yeah…a sheath…”<br />
<br />
Sam’s face lit up. “Dude, that means you’re caught up with me! We might finish transforming around the same time!”<br />
<br />
“Th-That would be…p-pretty cool…” Todd said. “W-Wait…I’m n-not caught up with y-you…”<br />
<br />
“What do you mean?”<br />
<br />
“M-My hair…”<br />
<br />
A grin appeared on Sam’s face. “Are you sure about that?” Confused, Todd grabbed his phone and turned on his camera, only for his eyes to widen at what he saw. His hair had grown the slightest bit thicker, with a few bits of it sticking up in a way that made it look like a stylistic choice. He turned the camera and stared in awe at how it continued growing on the back of his head, moving down his back, and connecting with the fur on his lower body. Todd reached up and felt his hair, only to realize that it wasn’t technically hair anymore; it was fur. <br />
<br />
“Looks pretty good, huh?” Sam asked as Todd admired the new fur on his head. “Now come on! We’ve got to get you walking on your new legs so you don’t fall like I did. Here, let me help you out of bed.” Sam took Todd’s hands and the mostly-transformed-wolf moved his legs over the edge of the bed. When Todd was ready, Sam gently helped him down onto the floor before letting go.<br />
<br />
“Okay, now walk over to me.” Sam moved to the other side of the room and gave Todd a reassuring smile. Todd nodded and took a step forward, wobbling a little bit. <br />
<br />
“Just like walking on your toes,” he told himself. He took another step. Then another. Then another. Then another. <br />
<br />
“Hey that’s it! You got it!” Sam exclaimed encouragingly. However, almost as soon as he said that, Todd began to wobble and fall forward. Seeing this, Sam lunged forward and caught Todd before he could fall. His head found itself resting on Sam’s pecs as Sam wrapped his arms around Todd to keep him from falling. <br />
<br />
“Whew, that was a close one,” Sam said with a sigh of relief. “I would’ve hated myself if you fell…to…the floor…” The young man found himself staring into Todd’s beautiful blue eyes through his glasses. Those shy, innocent eyes…they made Sam go nuts. He wanted to keep holding Todd close like this and never letting him go. <br />
<br />
“Could…could we stay like this…?” Todd asked softly, laying his head back down on Sam’s left pec. <br />
<br />
“As much as I want to say yes, we can’t unfortunately,” Sam replied. “We have classes.” Todd sighed and began to pull away to get dressed, but Sam grabbed his arm. “But if you’d like…we could…I dunno…hold hands on the way to class?”<br />
<br />
Todd’s face turned bright red as he nodded his head, his tail wagging happily behind him. Sam smiled and let go of his arm so the wolf could get himself dressed, and so he could do the same. Moving over to his dresser, he picked out a tank top and shorts to wear and quickly slipped them on. When he turned around, he was a bit surprised to find that Todd was already dressed and ready to go.<br />
<br />
Sam shook his head and laughed. “I swear, if I didn’t know any better, I’d say you’ve been wanting to hold hands with me for a long time.”<br />
<br />
<i>”So much more than that…”</i> Todd thought to himself. The two young men grabbed their backpacks and phones before walking out of their dorm room. As Todd closed the door behind him, he felt Sam’s strong hand grab his own. Blushing, Todd locked hands with Sam, and the two walked down the hall together.</p>
