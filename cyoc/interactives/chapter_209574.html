<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Gentlemen, I think I know what you might be interested in,&quot; Merlin said, stepping in. &quot;I have a splendid centaur costume which can be used by two people if you want. For the one in front. the thing is a real beauty. Come with me and see.&quot;<br />
Arthur was immediately taken by the proposal. He frowned and looked around, demanding wordlessly for any volunteers to take the rear end, the least noble part. Few wanted to leave all of their chances to become part of the fraternity, even for someone as obviously popular as Arthur. Arthur wanted to check out that costume that promised to be great but he needed someone else. Someone no one would really care about. Perhaps not his friends, or those supposedly so. But he had already selected someone to bully. No one would defend that Mark guy. But he had to coerce him to come with him. And for that, nothing was worth a bit of a reward and some threats mingled with it. He went up to him.<br />
&quot;Listen. We&#39;re going to go check that costume. If I like it, then you will be the end of it. If you refuse, I destroy any chances you might have to pledge successfully to that frat. Compared to me, you&#39;re nothing. You&#39;re poor and you&#39;re a dweeb. You&#39;re nothing. If you do as I say, I&#39;ll put in a good word for you. But if you don&#39;t do as I say, then I make sure no one accepts you at the frat. Got it?&quot;<br />
Mark nodded and Arthur smirked. Perfect! That was just too easy. He could make that idiot obey his every whim. And if all went well, then he&#39;d say he was cool and the other frat boys would decide. Or he wouldn&#39;t say anything. Or maybe he&#39;d forget. It would depend on his mood. Arthur just cared about himself, after all. And when he saw the costume, he could only think about himself in that gorgeous outfit. He could show off his abs fully and the bow, arrows, and wreath of laurel were just amazing! Even the fur was soft and realistic and the hooves incredible platforms. He had to impress girls , frat guys and everyone in that suit! And that shop owner in that ridiculous bathrobe asked a measly 18$ for it. Sweet! So he ordered Mark to get in the rear end and he obeyed, like the moron that he was and that he was only good for. It was really too easy! Little did he know that Merlin was thinking precisely the same thing about him.<br />
<br />
Once inside the costume, Arthur felt great. The horse legs were comfortable and realistic. His abs were the pride of the suit and he carried the accessories extremely well. Even the brown fur of the equine body matched his hair perfectly! And Mark was making himself virtually not there. Just as he should. Perfect! All was perfect!<br />
&quot;And you say it&#39;s eighteen bucks?&quot; he asked Merlin.<br />
&quot;Indeed. But I&#39;ll get more out of it later.&quot;<br />
Arthur did not listen, fascinated as he was by his own reflection in the full-length mirror. He was so handsome! Handsome as a god! All chicks would fight over him, just as they normally did! He was assured entering that frat! He would be a pledge the least amount of time! As anyone would guess, considering his looks and popularity. Yes, he&#39;d be great. Perfect. He was perfect, after all. And then everything stopped being perfect for him, precisely.<br />
<br />
Intense pain gripped him. So sharp, so intense that he could barely breathe, let alone scream or move. It was as if he was paralyzed. Then he felt the costume press against his legs. He could feel the fur fusing into his epidermis and the hooves melt into his bones, altering his anatomy. Even his intimacy was not spared, oh no. With horror, he felt his testicles recede into his groin as did his penis, the tree becoming part of his skin and flesh. They disappeared with two ridiculous &#39;pops&#39; rom his testes and a whistling sound from his penis, as if he was part of a comedy. But he wasn&#39;t! He had just become sexless. Sexless! His precious privates! But these changed were only the beginning. He felt his muscles, flesh, nerves and organs below his waist extend backwards. They became fused with another set of organs. Mark&#39;s. If he could have, Arthur would have shouted all of his revulsion. Fused! With that loser! No! No, no, no, no, no! It was a nightmare! A total nightmare! New nerves and flesh and organic tissue spread, entangling itself intimately and irreversibly to Marl&#39;s lower waist. Adjustments were made, of course, to make the two halves of the horse coherent. But they mingled successfully, sprouting a tail at its very rear end. Organs shifted and rearranged. Arthur was fully aware that his rear end was a remnant of Mark and the simple notion made him want to hurl in disgust. Ugh! It was vile! Foul! Completely sick! He was sharing part of Mark&#39;s body mingled with a horse&#39;s! He had Mark&#39;s balls and dick! Ew! That dweeb&#39;s penis and testicles! On him! Him! It was an absolute humiliation! What could be worse? He soon got the answer and it revulsed him even more because such a thing was possible. <br />
He felt Mark&#39;s upper half become imprisoned inside of his new body. It did not disappear. Oh, no. It changed shape, becoming smaller, rounder but it stayed there. It was there to stay, that much was clear. And if he was grossed out to the extreme at having Mark&#39;s privates attached to a horse&#39;s body, it wasn&#39;t going to stay that way for long. Except it was going to get worse. Arthur felt little pinches under his belly and they become numb. What were they? But soon his more immediate concerns were elsewhere. His new set of genitalia, as much as he scorned them and wished them gone, actually vanished. With another two comical &#39;pops&#39;, the testicles he had barely gotten accustomed to as belonging to his own body and nervous system, followed by his new penis with the same whistling sound as before. This made Arthur terrified. The dick and balls of a dweeb was better than none at all! Except this time his new privates did not simply vanish. His penis folded itself into a mirror of itself, leaving the empty space where another, real, penis could insert itself. Its rim folded itself further to allow labia to form. As for his scrotum, they rearranged themselves above that, above the lump that had been Mark and became ovaries. All three former privates connected with each other to become a very normal mare privacy. A privacy including a womb holding the zygote that was Mark, himself to develop into a perfectly normal, formed, male centaur. Arthur felt the zygote slowly expanding into an embryo until the feeling disappeared, as it settled fully into the womb and its natural environment, becoming a normal part of his female body. Mark had become a future centaur foal to develop naturally within this female anatomy. Arthur, freed from his paralysis, saw with horror his worst fears confirmed: his upper body was male but his centaur&#39;s horse body was female! He had little breasts, meant to allow foals (or was that babies?) to suckle and his privates, whether formerly Mark&#39;s or not, was a cunt! A cunt! A horse cunt! Enormous and meant to receive horse dicks! And to expel Mark, which he was still carrying! He was a male pregnant centaur! Him! The horror of his situation made him stay on the floor, panting and exhausted. <br />
<br />
Merlin was overjoyed. This spell was tricky but it had worked perfectly. Yep, he was that good. Arthur was a perfectly heathy expecting centaur. His upper half was as male as before, and his lower part completely female. An attractive female as that, even if he did not yet have the eye for that yet. His upper body was still handsome so that bully would fetch a pretty price on the fay market. Plus he was pregnant, showing that he was fertile and strongly healthy. As for Mark, his mind was slumbering. He was back to being an embryo, waiting for his time to be expelled from the womb. He&#39;d be the same as he was before, with as brown horse&#39;s body, with white patches, similar overall to his mother (or was it father?). He would reclaim his past memories when he&#39;d be around four years old, as he would become aware of his environment. In the end, Mark was the winner. He&#39;d stay fully male, while Arthur would be punished with dealing with a female body, something horrific for him. And he had no idea of how centaurs dealt with their male urges, obviously...<br />
&quot;Get ready for your journey,&quot; told Merlin to Arthur.<br />
&quot;Wh... What?&quot; stammered Arthur.<br />
And without a word  and a snap of his fingers, they departed to the fay world.<br />
<br />
When Arthur had come out of his confusion and his world had stopped turning, he was lying on a pile of hay, his wrists shackled to the wall and his front legs shackled together, limiting his movements. He could see other centaurs looking forlorn, shackled like he was. Outside these stables, Merlin was laughing with a short green creature resembling a goblin, who handed Merlin a few pouches containing gold coins and gems. Merlin then left, without one look fore Arthur. <br />
A few hours later, he was brought on a stage, where mostly male centaurs were the onlookers, accompanied by a few other creatures Arthur could not place. The other slaves on sale looked at him with curious looks, no doubt wondering how a male centaur could have a female lower body. Or the reverse. But mostly they were too preoccupied with their own misery to really notice. All centaurs for sale were bought, the females in particular. All the buyers had strong muscular bodies and irradiated virility. The male centaurs were bought for bringing variety in the leaders&#39;s harems, for servitude and for becoming part of bandit groups. Arthur just hoped he&#39;d be bought for the last two reasons. But naturally, his female body made that impossible. When it was his turn to step onto the front of the stage, whistles and awed exclamations greeted him. <br />
&quot;A rarity indeed!&quot; yelled the seller. &quot;A fine young man&#39;s body with the superb body of a mare. Have you seen a sweeter or more appealing slit and cunt? Perfect for those who would love a unique mate in their harems. And besides,&quot; he added with a wink. &quot;He&#39;s pregnant. A proof of his fertility and good health. Nothing beats obedience and good education as a foal raised in your own home!&quot; <br />
Cheers and clapping followed this little discourse, along with lustful leers. Arthur felt himself go cold. Oh no... He had always prided himself on being extremely attractive, but this was so not the admirers he wanted! His buying price mounted and mounted until he was sold for 12,000 gold coins. His buyer was an enormous muscular guy with a big black horse&#39;s body and a short tail. He was hung like... well, like a horse, but a humongous sheath concealed a very scary monster, and testicles as large as a bull&#39;s certainly. Oh, Arthur prayed that his internal reproductive organs were made of leather, and not crepe paper. His chest was hairy and his beard was very short, but thick. He grabbed Arthur&#39;s chains, paid in ingots of a sort of precious metal and took his new prize back to his home. It was in the countryside, in a large, very large mansion. He took Arthur through several corridors and they passed through rooms with female centaurs, either engaged in domestic or calm activities, to lock him in a sort of boudoir. <br />
<br />
Several hours later, he come back, explaining he had to be broken and learn to be a part of his harem. Arthur protested that he was a man but the huge centaur, called Crow, laughed it off. He had a mare&#39;s body, did he not? He was a freak, yes, but a beautiful one. The best of male and female in one body. He was a marvel of nature. Crow claimed Arthur was perfect and that he smelled delicious. He kissed him and though disgusted, Arthur could not do anything to prevent him. As a last resort, he yelled that he was pregnant (much to his utter shame) but Crow said he quite liked pregnant sex, and that he knew what to do and no what to do. Besides, he knew what he could do to make Arthur more comfortable. And he was good. Much to his indignation, shame and horror, Crow was very good with Arthur&#39;s privates. He kew how to tickle and titillate his cunt, allowing for him to caress both the inside and outside of his labia, kissing lovingly his slit. Almost in spite of himself, his sensitive nerves allowed for his vulva to become receptive and its muscles constricted, already anticipating the virile member of the owner of such sweet tickles, brushes and caresses. Arthur was helpless to stop relaxing under the expert ministrations of Crow, his caresses and massages making his muscles become akin to putty. In spite of his appearance, Crow was so delicate and gentle. So loving. Arthur&#39;s mare body was feeling incredibly receptive and it transmitted this heat and urges to the male upper body. It made things confusing for Arthur, who could feel heat and anticipation pooling in his groin. He wanted very much something inserted there, even if the idea of a horse&#39;s penis did repulse him. A simple dildo would have sufficed but Arthur had no say in what he desired. For Crow, the mare&#39;s body had sent signals of being enthralled by his foreplay and its receptiveness, coupled to its intricate and complex beauty mingling two sexes. This meant his own groin was demanding urgent attention. His enormous testicles were already producing semen extensively and it was pumping into his penis along with blood. His virile member emerged from its sheath, erect and in its full glory. In front of that monster, Arthur&#39;s eyes bulged. Pre-cum was already dripping. And he was supposed to take in that... thing... into himself? His fear was barely alleviated by the sudden dripping that splashed out of his uterus and in full view. Disgusting! Sick! Vile! Did he just... lubricate himself?... Ugh!!! But Crow was overjoyed. His eyes sparkled and he said that he knew Arthur was not insensitive to his sexual prowess. The sight made his penis even more engorged and he slid into Arthur, mounting him from behind. The love juice meant that it went in easier but the thrusts were foreign and painful. Crow just said that the baby was proof enough that he loved taking penises in. Arthur was too scared and the subject of too strange sensations to argue or explain anything back. Just as Crow ejaculated and pulled out of him, leaving an enormous load that dripped out of his womb and vulva to the floor, Arthur felt the walls of his uterus constrict and relax, unhappy not to hug Crow&#39;s penis anymore, while a wave of pleasure shot through his reproductive organs, hitting his brain and leaving him exhausted, happy and thinking that his intense shame would come later. He slumped on the ground sweating, embarrassed to the last degree, while Crow showered him with compliments and kisses.<br />
The next weeks, Crow broke him. Remolded him. Made him into something else. He patted the growing bulge of Arthur&#39;s belly, kissing it and predicting a strong handsome little foal that he could raise a a son. He kissed him and bestowed his sexual prowess upon Arthur, whom he renamed Feisty because of Arthur repetitive but fruitless attempts at resistance. But Crow was good and a few pokes, kisses and tickles in the right areas of his labia and vagina got Arthur&#39;s body receptive, no matter what his male brain wanted at first. Crow said he was perfect and his cunt was the most beautiful he had ever seen. Arthur&#39;s cunt in question did seem to have the hots for Crow, responding with lubricating fluids out of Arthur&#39;s control. Crow kept telling him to accept his fate and Arthur felt himself getting catatonic and listening to Crow more and more. What choice did he have? Besides, he had a foal in his womb to think about. Crow was slowly grooming him and he was powerless to do anything and soon care. However, the other mares in the harem welcomed him and taught him to do interesting things like embroidery and painting or sewing. He indulged with them in lesbian sex, which Crow encouraged and liked to watch. And even during the days in which Feisty felt like doing nothing, well, he could rub his body in scented oils, take sexy poses and lying upon soft pillows. So by the time his baby was nearing his term, he had fully begun to forget his past life and be a gentle female-like male. Being a bully or a frat pledge made absolutely no sense anymore. Useless goals to forget. The other centaur girls were a lot more interesting than any girl he had known in the boring human world. This one was a lot more liberated, interesting and with less ridiculous taboos.</p>
