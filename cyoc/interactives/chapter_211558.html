<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">They pulled in to the parking lot of the fast food restaurant and parked. Jeff and Ryan got out, walking towards the counter. Richard let them make their orders. Jeff and Ryan walked back while Ryan’s dad paid and got them some ketchup.<br />
<br />
“So, uh, Ryan.” Jeff cleared his throat. “Your dad seems…nicer than I remember.”<br />
<br />
“Oh?” Ryan looked at Jeff in surprise. “You remember him different?”<br />
<br />
“Meaner.”<br />
<br />
Ryan looked down at the table. “Yes, well…things have changed.”<br />
<br />
Jeff glanced over at Richard as the big man started filling up their sodas.<br />
<br />
“Didn’t he used to beat you? And now he’s taking us out for ice cream.” Jeff said.<br />
<br />
“Stop.” Ryan’s shoulders hunched. “My dad is better now, okay? Just drop it.”<br />
<br />
Jeff pulled back. “Alright. Touchy subject. Literally.”<br />
<br />
“Pfft, you fucking ass.” Ryan snorted and rolled his eyes. Then he looked at Jeff, eyes steady. “Just don’t bring it up again.”<br />
<br />
“As you command.” Jeff winked.<br />
<br />
“So what was bothering you earlier?” Ryan asked.<br />
<br />
Jeff opened his mouth to say something, then paused. <br />
<br />
What had been bothering him? He looked down at himself, past his heaving pecs and the lewd bulge of his crotch. Something about all this had been wrong, but for the life of him, he couldn’t remember what. Jeff scratched his beard and shrugged.<br />
<br />
“Dunno, just out of it today, I guess. Glad it didn’t show on the field.” Jeff said finally.<br />
<br />
Palpable relief spread across Ryan’s face. “Oh, good. Just wanted to make sure everything was okay, is all.”<br />
<br />
Richard came back with their trays and set them down in front of the both of them before assuming his place at the edge of the booth. They dug in, Jeff finding himself famished and eating more than he remembered ever being able to eat. When they were finished, Jeff found he was still peckish, which was mind-blowing, because he never recalled having ever finishing off a whole meal.<br />
<br />
“That hits the spot, eh boys?” Richard winked at them. “Alright, let’s get you two home.”<br />
<br />
“Dropping me off?” Jeff asked as they made their way to the car.<br />
<br />
“Dropping you off? Aren’t you spending the night?” Richard asked.<br />
<br />
“Oh. Well, yeah. Sorry, must have spaced out there for a second.” Jeff gave them both a nervous smile.<br />
<br />
“Another weird bout huh?” Ryan whispered as they drove to his home.<br />
<br />
“It’s all a fog, really. I can’t remember working out with you, but I know I do.” Jeff shook his head. “Maybe I just need some rest and some water.”<br />
<br />
“Staying hydrated is a good idea.” Ryan agreed, smiling to himself. He picked up his phone and played with it a bit. “You find anyone yet?”<br />
<br />
“Hmm?” Jeff raised a brow.<br />
<br />
“You know what I mean. Are you dating?” Ryan asked.<br />
<br />
“Nope. Guess my new football stardom hasn’t gotten around to the rest of the school yet.” Jeff smirked and kissed a bicep.<br />
<br />
“Huh.” Ryan nodded to himself. “That’s fine then.”<br />
<br />
“Here we are!” Richard announced, pulling into the driveway of a nice split-level in a cul-de-sac. “Home sweet home. Everybody out!”<br />
<br />
Ryan and Jeff got out. <br />
<br />
Ryan ran straight to his room, Jeff following along uncertainly. He’d never been in their home before, and yet…he seemed to know exactly where everything was. Instead of surprise at the home, it was more like unlocking an old memory, like returning home after a long trip. Ryan’s room was large and covered in poster’s of football players and sports trophies. Ryan waited for him on his personal couch in front of his TV.<br />
<br />
“Dad’s got a few calls to make for his job, so we can hang out and watch TV up here.” Ryan explained.<br />
<br />
“Oh, sure,” Jeff grumbled, turning to make sure he wasn’t going to sit on anything and lowering his heavily muscled form to the bed. He scratch his furry chest and pointed at the movie stand. “We watching it on DVD or is there a series or something you wanna watch?”<br />
<br />
Ryan smirked and put a recording of his football plays on, turning the sound up. Jeff watched avidly as Ryan ran the ball down the field. He was so athletic! Beside him, Ryan took of his shirt, revealing a forest of chest hair. Jeff stared at Ryan’s fur-covered pecs and licked lips. When Ryan glanced over, Jeff quickly looked away.  Strong hands gripped his own shirt and pulled it off.<br />
<br />
“Ryan!” Jeff gasped when his head was freed.<br />
<br />
“What?” Ryan cock a brow, “I’m just helping you get comfortable.”<br />
<br />
Jeff scratched his chest hair. “Yeah, but, like, ask permission first.”<br />
<br />
“Whatever you say big guy.”<br />
<br />
“I’m not that big.” Jeff blushed. “I’ll never be as big as your father.”<br />
<br />
“I wouldn’t be so sure.” Ryan muttered, pulling out his phone and typing something. “You might end up even bigger.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, whatever,” Jeff said. His legs ached and he rubbed them before settling back into the couch. He saw Ryan catch another pass and run it to the goal. “I could watch you play for hours.”<br />
<br />
“Me?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah. You’re really good, you know.” Jeff smiled at Ryan.<br />
<br />
“Thanks.” It was Ryan’s turn to blush. “Hey, uh, Jeff?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah?” Jeff turned and Ryan leaned over and kissed him.<br />
<br />
Jeff was shocked for a moment, but as their tongues wrestled in each other’s mouths, he found himself relaxing. Ryan was so hot…he ran his hands across the other jock’s hairy muscles, embracing him. Ryan’s hands roamed over his body, fingers ruffling Jeff’s chest fur before going lower, down past his abs, and alighted on the hem of his pants.<br />
<br />
A few gentle tugs later and Jeff’s beercan-thick cock bobbed free at full mast. Jeff groaned happily as Ryan’s hand encircled his cock. His own hands gripped the hem of Ryan’s shorts and pulled them down, and he saw how stiff his best friend was.<br />
<br />
<i>Boyfriend,</I> his mind corrected him, <I>his boyfriend.</I><br />
<br />
Not bothering to pursue that thought, he kissed Ryan with renewed hunger, his own hand playing with the other jock’s big dick. They made out with passion, dicks slick with pre. He swore his dick was swelling larger in Ryan’s hand, though it must have been his mind playing tricks on him. Jeff couldn’t get enough of his boyfriend, his heart was pounding out of control.<br />
<br />
Jeff bucked in Ryan’s big hands, feeling himself growing close. Ryan broke off the kiss and laid his chin over Jeff’s shoulder. Jeff embraced him, rocking his boyfriend in his arms. He sniffed Ryan’s hair, enjoying his boyfriend’s scent. Ryan pulled away and stood.<br />
<br />
“Come on, let’s get to bed.” Ryan smiled.<br />
<br />
Jeff stood and wobbled unsteadily, his head swimming from sudden vertigo. Had he gotten taller? He glanced at a mirror that hung on the wall by Ryan’s dresser and saw a huge young man, almost as big as Richard Huff, staring back at him. His body was heavy with bulging muscle, a dense carpet of body hair covering him. Ryan took hold of his arm and steadied him. Jeff stared down into his ruggedly boyfriend’s amber eyes and smiled.<br />
<br />
“Thanks,” Jeff rumbled in a deep baritone.<br />
<br />
“No problem big guy.” Ryan pat him on the back.<br />
<br />
Jeff made it to the bed and carefully set himself down on it. When you were as big as he was, you couldn’t afford to just sit anywhere without looking! Jeff chuckled, waiting for his head to stop spinning. His boyfriend got on his knees between Jeff’s muscular thighs and spread them apart, exposing his incredibly large cock. He swore it throbbed larger, a thick vein worming its way up the shaft to the big mushroom-tipped head, but ignored it.<br />
<br />
“Is the Big Bad Wolf gonna blow me?” Jeff chuckled.<br />
<br />
“I’m gonna huff and puff and blow your wad with my mouth.” Ryan grinned and gave the head of Jeff’s cock a lick.<br />
<br />
Jeff shivered and gasped as his handsome boyfriend’s tongue ran around the head of his shaft and then, with some effort, took it in his mouth and bobbed. Ryan couldn’t take all of Jeff’s dick in his mouth, but his licks were enough to nearly send Jeff over the edge right there. His boyfriend seemed to sense that and backed off while Jeff cooled down. Again and again, his boyfriend brought him to the edge of orgasm before backing down.<br />
<br />
“Ryan,” Jeff gasped, sweat beading across his body, “I wanna fuck you.”<br />
<br />
“Fuck me?” Ryan smirked bemusedly. “With that big monster?”<br />
<br />
Jeff glanced down at the veiny fist of a cock between his legs. His balls sagged heavily over the edge of the bed, testicles bigger than oranges. Ryan leaned down and gave it a lick, making his cock jump and pre to dribble onto the carpet below.<br />
<br />
“Then what-?”<br />
<br />
“Lean back big guy.” Ryan firmly pressed on his chest, hand wedging between Jeff’s bulging chest.<br />
<br />
Jeff flopped onto his back, using a pillow as a head rest. Ryan picked up some lube from the top of his bedside table and lifted Jeff’s legs up over his head, letting them rest on his shoulders. Jeff could feel cool air against his hole and shivered. Was Ryan going to-?<br />
<br />
“Wait, Ryan, I-Oh!” Jeff moaned as Ryan applied cool lube liberally to his clenching pucker. A finger wriggled it’s way inside him, touching him in places he’d never felt before, slathering lube around the inside of his hole. The probing finger rubbed a sensitive spot that made Jeff gasp and his cock twitch. “Oh, Ryan!”<br />
<br />
“It’s alright Jeff. Just relax.”<br />
<br />
Jeff’s breaths came in heavy pants as more of Ryan’s fingers entered him. Then, once Jeff was properly relaxed, he pressed his whole fist into him. Jeff moaned, his pucker twitching involuntarily as Ryan filled him, splaying his hand wide, stretching the muscles, loosening them properly. His cock remained inexplicably hard, drooling pre onto his balls and down onto the carpet.<br />
<br />
Ryan slowly pulled his fist out, and Troy felt the muscles down there were slack. Then his boyfriend drizzled lube onto his cock. It was big, almost as long as Jeff’s but not nearly as thick.  Ryan took his shaft in hand and guided it towards Jeff&#39;s rear entrance. Jeff felt himself tense as it brushed his hole.<br />
<br />
Ryan sensed his boyfriend’s discomfort and leaned down, kissing Jeff and rubbing his cockhead against his pucker. Jeff felt himself relax and, as if on accident, the cock slipped into his hole. He moaned as Ryan’s meat slid right in, gliding against his prostate.<br />
<br />
“You’re gonna be perfect, even bigger than my dad.” Ryan said, hilting his dick deep inside Jeff.<br />
<br />
Jeff just groaned, enjoying the fullness. Bigger than Mr. Huff? Yeah, that’d be so fuckin’ hot. Ryan eased his way out and Jeff found himself clamping down on that thick dick, wanting his boyfriend to stay inside of him.<br />
<br />
“Oh Ryan,” Jeff found himself begging as his boyfriend fully withdrew. ‘Fuck me.”<br />
<br />
Ryan played with something on his phone. Then he tossed it aside, onto the bed, and pressed his cock back against Jeff’s hole. Ryan’s dick felt bigger, swelling the farther into Jeff that he thrust. Jeff writhed and moaned as it lit up his pleasure centers, clenching rhythmically, drawing the cock deeper inside of him. That strange stretching feeling, all over Jeff’s body, along with a pins and needles sensation came over him. He felt his head bump the baseboard.<br />
<br />
Jeff looked down past the cleavage of his heaving pecs and his mighty cock as Ryan thrust faster and faster, stretching his hole. He gasped for breath as his boyfriend’s beer-can thick shaft rearranged his insides so pleasurably. Ryan’s cellphone jostled about on the bed, coming within Jeff’s line of sight.<br />
<br />
He blinked at what he saw on the screen. <br />
<br />
Was that…the Chronivac? But he couldn’t concentrate on that right now. Didn’t want to. All he wanted to do was lay back and enjoy the feelings as Ryan’s cock destroy his hole. His muscles bulged thicker as he lay there, moaning happily.<br />
<br />
Ryan hilted deep and kissed Jeff hard on the lips. “You’re absolutely perfect.”<br />
<br />
“So are-Ah! You.” Jeff groaned as Ryan’s cock hit his prostate again, lost in the feeling. <br />
<br />
Ryan kissed him harder, and Jeff embraced his boyfriend, losing himself to the buck of Ryan&#39;s hips. He was getting closer and closer to orgasm. Waves of warmth were radiating from his hole. Jeff gasped and groaned as his former teacher fucked him properly. That was such a weird thought that he began to forget it immediately. They’d been dating for years now, Ryan wasn’t some stodgy old teacher!<br />
<br />
The headboard clunked against the wall as Ryan began thrusting into him in a frenzy. Jeff moaned as the waves of pleasure built and built and then gushed out of his violently twitching cock in a hot gush. Ryan thrust deep and his own cock flexed and emptied his balls into Jeff’s bowels in a wave of warmth and heat.<br />
<br />
They panted together, Ryan still buried deep inside Jeff’s hairy ass. Then, with a sigh, he slowly withdrew, leaving Jeff feeling empty and rather sore. He held out a hand and Jeff engulfed it in his. With a grunt, he stood up, tottering dizzily at the edge of the bed and spotted the mirror near the dresser.<br />
<br />
Jeff stared woozily at the massive young man in the mirror. The rather dumb looking guy had a glazed expression on his bearded face and was absolutely covered in fur and muscles. He towered 6 inches higher than the incredibly muscular and athletic young man with amber-colored eyes besides him. The young jock next to the behemoth glanced at the mirror, smiled, then  embraced the behemoth.<br />
<br />
With a start, Jeff realized Ryan was hugging him, he was the impossibly muscled guy in the mirror. He drew Ryan closer and smiled back at his reflection.<br />
<br />
“Like what you see?” Ryan said softly.<br />
<br />
“Why wouldn’t I?” Jeff rumbled deeply.<br />
<br />
“Ryan! Jeff!” Richard’s voice boomed from downstairs. “Game’s startin’!”<br />
<br />
“Come on, get dressed.” Ryan said, tugging Jeff to his clothes.<br />
<br />
As Jeff put on his clothes, he noticed Ryan’s phone on the bed, the screen blanked from disuse. He gave Ryan a sidelong glance and considered going for the phone. Would he even notice? Or he could just check any changes with his own Chronivac.</p>
