<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff wasn&#39;t sure what to do yet so he went down stairs to help his mother Ashley with the groceries.<br />
<br />
“Hey mom, how may I help?”<br />
<br />
“Oh great sweetheart, I hope that little gift hunt on yours went well, if you could help me put away some of these groceries and I am way too tired to cook and I thought I would save us from dishes tonight so I got some pizza from Angelo’s” Ashley said handing some things for Jeff to place in the pantry.<br />
<br />
”Thanks mom! How was work today?” Jeff said going into the pantry<br />
<br />
”UHH, don&#39;t me started, I am not a fan of my new team. I mean don&#39;t get me wrong, I love the promotion and the increased pay is amazing , but I got stuck with the absolute most annoying people in the office!” Ashley said with her hands in the air out of frustration<br />
<br />
”Wow that sucks mom, I&#39;m sorry your day was stressful.” Jeff said getting some plates ready for dinner<br />
<br />
Jeff and his mother had dinner in the living room watching some home improvement shows and cable news. 40-year-old Ashley Harwin has been raising Jeff all by herself since her dirt-bag husband left long before he was even born. She has been working hard to provide a good life for her and Jeff. It has been her and Jeff against the world, Ashley isn&#39;t much of a social person, to begin with, so her only friend is Jeff and they are practically attached to the hip. Once she and Jeff headed to bed, Jeff started to think of what to do. He thought back to a couple of hours ago, and he realized now since he promised his mother a gift, he must get her something. No big deal though, he could give her anything with this new Chronivac that was mystically given to him. But what could he get her and then like that an idea sprung into Jeff&#39;s head.  <br />
<br />
Jeff really loves his mom, to a point where he obsesses over her. To him, she is perfection, a hard-working caring person, and Jeff pushes himself to make his mother proud. He looked to the Chronivac and he started to type away.<br />
<br />
Ashley never dated anyone since Jeff was born and Jeff was tired of his mom not having a lover. He started to think of who would be a perfect lover for his mom. After an hour or two of thinking, Jeff decided the perfect lover for his mother would a copy of his mother. He looked at his mother’s stats and copied them over to his. Jeff was always a good son to Ashley and now in order to be the best possible son, he would have to become a copy of his mother Ashley. The thought of becoming his mother gave Jeff an erection. He finalized the transformation and hit confirm.<br />
<br />
Jeff quickly took off his clothes and looked at himself in the mirror. He noticed that he lost about 5 inches of height making him 5’6” like his mother. He felt some cracking happening as his face morphed into his mother&#39;s and he got her hazel eyes. Then his blonde buzzcut morphed as Jeff’s hair became longer and thicker growing to his hips. Ashley took pride in her long hair and makes a great deal of effort to take care of it. His bones cracked a bit as his hips grew and his waist became smaller. A toned flat-stomach greeted Jeff next, before nice C cup breasts formed, giving Jeff his mother’s hourglass figure.  Ashley loved to workout when she had the time and it maintained her killer figure. He then felt his reproductive system morph into the same one that gave birth to him 16 years ago. He felt his mother’s memories come in and soon Jeff Harwin was now a copy of his mother Ashley Harwin and she couldn&#39;t be any happier.<br />
<br />
The new Ashley looked at herself in the mirror and smiled as she was perfect. Ashley2 then looked around the room and noticed her past self’s room was changed to accommodate the shift in reality. It looked like an at-home office, which either Ashley probably won&#39;t need considering the Jeff made them rich so they won&#39;t have to work another day again. The only thing the remained the same was the Chronivac on the desk where Ashley2 saw her new profile. She turned off the program and unplugged the device. Before she put the device in the closet, Ashley2 kissed the Chronivac before thanking it. <br />
<br />
Ashley2 decided to sleep on the couch as she didn&#39;t want to wake Ashley1 up. The morning came soon after and Ashley2 was still amazed that she was a copy of Ashley. She noticed the original was still sleeping, Ahsley2 carefully put on some clothes and put her hair up with one of her numerous hair claws. She started to make breakfast and then near the end, she felt a smack on her butt<br />
<br />
”Morning sleepyhead!” Ashley2 said with a bit of moan<br />
<br />
”Sorry for waking up late... babe, I don&#39;t know why I was so sleepy.” Ashley1 said as she was walking to the table<br />
<br />
”Don&#39;t feel bad at all babe, you deserve it!, I made us our favorite today.”<br />
<br />
”Muffins,” They said in unison<br />
<br />
Ashley2 enjoyed breakfast with herself. It was so hot talking to herself and Ashley1 could sense her copy getting horny too.<br />
<br />
”Hey Ash, I was thinking how about you go to the living room and I wash the dishes since you made such a nice breakfast.” Ashley1 said feeling up Ashley2’s body.<br />
<br />
”Sounds terrific Ash!” As Ashley2 walks over to the living room. Ashley2 let&#39;s her long hair flow before taking her clothes off knowing what both of them want. Ashley1 comes back, she doesn&#39;t say a word before taking off her clothes and pounces on her copy. They admire that they are perfect mirrors of each other and they look into their identical hazel eyes. It is perfect having a lover that understood her, as they started to make out. Ashley2 got down on the ground and started to pleasure the original by licking her pussy. Because she was a perfect copy of the original she knew just where to strike with her tongue, giving the original Ashley multiple orgasms. Ashley1 then got her copy and started to run her thigh against Ashley2’s pussy getting her very wet and making her orgasm multiple times as well. Ashley1 and 2 kept going at it. Ashley1 brought out all the sex toys she&#39;s been using for years and pleasured her new copy with them. It had been so long since she has ever been with a lover. After a while Ashley1 and 2 are tired and cuddle on the couch streaming some movies.<br />
<br />
The little bits of Jeff left inside Ashley2 are at peace. His mother doesn&#39;t have to work anymore and she has a perfect lover to live the <br />
 rest of her life with.... herself.</p>
