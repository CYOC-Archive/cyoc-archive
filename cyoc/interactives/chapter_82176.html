<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Will hesitated at first but then realized it was only a matter of time before he won this challenge and he had <br />
nothing but time and an alternate reality universe to explore, and really, how often does he get to be a <br />
direction kiosk in a game?<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; Will said, &quot;Ill cover your shift, when will you be back?&quot; Apparently the question triggered some auto <br />
response in the guard as she seemed to go into auto pilot for response.<br />
<br />
&quot;To encourage realism and player faction interaction, the cities in the World of Supers have guard rotation. <br />
This means at random times throughout the day, some Non-Player characters (NPCs) will not be doing their <br />
normal jobs and could be found elsewhere in the city. These rotations last for an hour but on special events <br />
may last for up to a day.&quot;<br />
<br />
The guard blinked for a few seconds, then smiled and said, &quot;Oh, I'll be back within the hour.&quot;<br />
<br />
Will nodded, &quot;Oh, well then that's fine, what do I need to do when covering your shift?&quot;<br />
<br />
The guard smiled, &quot;I'm sorry to have to be formal about this but you know the rules. Will you cover my shift? <br />
Please state &quot;I Accept&quot; or &quot;I decline.&quot;&quot;<br />
<br />
Will, thinking he had made his willingness to cover the shift clear, was confused but said, &quot;I accept but you <br />
didn't tell me what exactly I'm actually supposed.....&quot;<br />
<br />
A loud voice from nowhere boomed &quot;NPC to NPC transfer initiated. Please stand by!&quot;<br />
<br />
Will was suddenly rethinking his acceptance of the offer when a sharp pain shot through his skull. It radiated <br />
through his spine and out to the rest of his body. He screamed out but didn't hear himself over the ringing in <br />
his ears. As quickly as it came the pain was gone and he immediately had his senses back and noticed he was <br />
surrounded by a strange swirling cloud of sparkling something.<br />
<br />
He recognized the appearance of that cloud as an in game character transformation, his avatar was about to be <br />
changed, unfortunately HE was the avatar.<br />
<br />
Will tried to speak, and move, and run, and scream but couldn't do anything. His eyes could move and he tried <br />
to look above himself for the progress bar but couldn't see it, or move his head to look. He could feel the <br />
changes occurring but couldn't tell what exactly was happening. He did notice when he shrunk three or so <br />
inches and he either got significantly thinner or his clothes grew huge.<br />
<br />
A few seconds later the swirls stopped thereby signaling the transformation was complete but he still couldn't <br />
move freely. Suddenly Will spun around three times (counter clockwise for those who care,) and then had <br />
control of his body again.<br />
<br />
Looking down he noticed his outfit had changed to that of a guard and he was carrying a gun. He normally would <br />
have given that much attention but he also noticed his legs and torso had doubled in size and his arms had <br />
quadrupled, and it was all muscle. He was all muscle.<br />
<br />
Shocked by the transformation he looked above his head at the nameplate floating above his head <br />
Will of City Guard<br />
   Level 12<br />
<br />
Level 12? Level 12! Will was shocked until he thought about it, the town guard has to be the toughest thing in <br />
the area in order to 'keep the peace' and this area was for level 5-8 characters. Will didn't get the usual <br />
level up 'Advancement' screen but that made sense as he didnt advance but was more so, reprogrammed.<br />
<br />
He was now one of the strongest entities in the area, done sending the package, and had time to kill. The <br />
program seemed to have changed who he was to the rest of the game so he doubted he would have any problem with <br />
his former villain status. <br />
<br />
Out of nowhere a player was flying up to him full speed, on a hover-scooter. A millisecond before impact the <br />
scooter disappeared and the player hit the ground and stood still with an eerie emotionless look on his face.<br />
<br />
Face unchanging the player said, &quot;Um, do you know where the tavern is?&quot;<br />
<br />
Beside himself with his near death experience Will went off on the guy for scaring him, &quot;WHAT THE HELL is <br />
WRONG WITH YOU?? You almost Killed me!! You scared the bejebus out of me and all you can say is where is the <br />
Freaking Tavern!?!?!&quot;<br />
<br />
Well, that was what Will had intended on saying, really he said, &quot;Ah, yes. The tavern, one of my favorite <br />
places! You can find several taverns in the city. My personal favorite is in the slums district, but you can <br />
also find one near Hero's Hall on the north side of town or by Vigilante Crusher's Corner to the south.&quot;<br />
<br />
All this while smiling.<br />
<br />
The player immediately mounted the hovercraft that appeared again from nothing. Gone as quickly as he came, <br />
Will caught a glimpse of his reflection in a nearby window, he didnt look much like himself at all! <br />
Humongously proportioned, almost comical, and he looked older than before. No longer 20 but more so 35 with <br />
heavy stubble that turned into a goatee. Being 15 all of 2 hours ago he liked what he saw and smiled, he <br />
looked charming. Experimenting with his reflection he glared and actually scared himself as he did not yet <br />
naturally recognize the face as his own.<br />
<br />
Not having expected to loose control of his body randomly upon player interaction, maybe this transformation <br />
isn't all THAT great, Will thought to himself as he realized the other guard was gone. Where did she go off to <br />
Will wondered, but that line of thinking was cut short when he realized that he was in the wrong location. He <br />
NEEDED to cross the street and go up a block! He is currently out of formation!<br />
<br />
Will's mind went blank as he was called to the task of City Guard...</p>
