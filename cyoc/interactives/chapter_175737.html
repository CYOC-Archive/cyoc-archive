<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It took a few moments for the call to go in, and Brandon bit his lip lightly.<br />
<br />
He knew that Jannes was probably going to be aiming to get something more out of him. Maybe even sex, considering how the developments were coming. Brandon looked at his tight ass and toned thighs and quivered a little, rolling his eyes in the process. He hated how his new body reacted to things. Just thinking of it gave him these lewd daydreams. And the worst part? He knew he could still perform for women, knew he could still get it up like he used to, but now his body just vastly preferred the company of men.<br />
<br />
The call finally went through, and by now it seemed Jannes knew it was him, &quot;...Brandon, what happened this time? Did you have any further unusual changes---&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, Yes that I fucking did!&quot; Brandon paced back and forth, feeling like he could cry from both how intense his emotions were and the rollercoaster ride this turned out to be. &quot;Your drug regressed me all the way to 18 or so, but it took away most of my bulk, and---and I&#39;m suddenly feeling so...submissive.&quot;<br />
<br />
A sigh on the other end followed by a surprisingly conciliatory tone from Jannes, &quot;There&#39;s nothing wrong with being---oh, never mind. Wrong tack to take. Look, Brandon, if you&#39;re honestly bothered about the way your body has been developing this much, how about you come by my laboratory again. I might have something else that could help you. But there&#39;s going to be a price tag on this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Whatever you want, I can pay.&quot; Brandon responded.<br />
<br />
&quot;It won&#39;t be to me per se,&quot; Jannes stated, and then continued after a pause, &quot;I want the Whyte Foundation to make a charitable donation of two million dollars to an LGBT rights organization of your choice. Stating that you have come around and believe in---&quot;<br />
<br />
Brandon felt like he was going to throw the phone at the mirror, but looking at the mirror first reminded him of what was at stake. &quot;...Fine. Fine. That all?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes. Looking forward to seeing you there, Brandon.&quot; With that the phone call ended. Brandon promptly got dressed in Jake&#39;s old clothes, noting he felt young, cute, and yet still somewhat strong as he put on the clothes. Any guy so inclined would go gaga for his pretty face, his tight, toned abs, generous ass and strong legs. Brandon did admit that even as he wanted to get back to trying for women again, there WAS some satisfaction to be had in knowing he was so desirable.<br />
<br />
&quot;Be back soon, Jakey!&quot; Why the fuck did Brandon call him that? Oh never mind. He just went ahead and let Jake stay. It sounded like he was preoccupied with his new body - Brandon only heard a groan and a loud, porn star moan from the bedroom. Yep, seemed like Jake was distracted.<br />
<br />
Thankfully as Brandon went out and got in his car, it seemed his knowledge of driving and use of vehicles was not regressed with the rest of his body. He calmly drove out to go to the laboratory, eager to get this situation resolved. Jannes was one way or another going to make him a masculine, strong man again. And all it required was making a sizable donation to an organization. Really, Brandon couldn&#39;t see why he wouldn&#39;t. He was after all seeing the fringe benefits of this kind of thing.<br />
<br />
As he drove he found himself pulling up and looking at a group of young women dressed somewhat showy on what he guessed was a daily run.<br />
<br />
Yep, this more than proved that while his body would say yes to an available man more than an available woman, the attraction was still there. The borderline twink gulped and felt his manhood stiffen in Jake&#39;s pants. &quot;H-Her...Her boobies...boobs...why why am I---&quot; Brandon indulged in a moment of fantasy as the traffic had slowed down.<br />
<br />
He imagined himself sucking on her tits, letting her touch his smooth body, letting her jerk his dick and choke down a moan as he--- &quot;HOLY FUCK!!&quot; Brandon gasped and then felt his dick let out a load in his pants. &quot;F-Fuck...&quot; He was way too sensitive. He needed to get to the fucking laboratory posthaste.<br />
<br />
By the time he got there he had a sizable stain on the front of his pants from his cumshot, and Brandon didn&#39;t even care. He marched out and, seeing Jannes waiting for him with a new item on hand, asked in a furious tone, &quot;Do you have any idea of what your fucking serum did to me, Jannes? Do you!?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re...looking a little smaller than you actually---&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No shit, sherlock.&quot; Brandon choked down some tears, and looked up at the doctor. It was that moment that really impressed on Jannes the depths of the changes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright,&quot; Jannes started, &quot;I managed to isolate at least a few of the isotopes which seem to be involved in the transformative properties of the serum, and with some work I managed to track one sort of change or metamorphosis to each new serum.&quot;<br />
<br />
Brandon responded, &quot;So...each of these has like, a new change in it for me. That&#39;ll like, get me feeling manlier and all.&quot; He looked excited and eagerly started moving toward the container.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not yet, Brandon. Make that donation.&quot;<br />
<br />
Brandon sighed, and took out his phone, putting in the code and went ahead with a banking app to make a donation of  2 million to the LGBT Youth Fund, showing Jannes the post-donation screen and notice of withdrawal on his phone. Not long after that, Jannes handed over the serum container, and promptly stated, &quot;Now, a word of warning before you go on. Only use one of these new serums. Mixing and matching them all could result in unpredictable and continuous transformations beyond the scope of my expertise. You could be yourself one hour, and an Asian woman the next hour, then a black man the hour after that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Brandon contemplated, and then nodded, &quot;So your serum&#39;s capable of all of that...?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, that it is. I&#39;m still debating whether it is a worthwhile cure.&quot; Jannes contemplated aloud, &quot;Is it worth losing your identity and preferences, implicitly some of your free will, in order to regain health and youth? What price will be asked going forward? What happens if someone manages to alter or abridge the formula for---and he&#39;s gone.&quot;<br />
<br />
Indeed, even as Jannes contemplated these things, Brandon was already headed back to his car. As soon as he was there, he opened the container and looked at the serums. Each one had a small descriptor by it, but by themselves they just looked like some kind of party punch or something. Yeah, it seemed &quot;masculinization&quot; was just about right. He noted there was another new injector to use with these.<br />
<br />
Brandon drove for a while until he was close by his retreat. Once he was stopped, he loaded the injector with the muscle growth serum, pulled up his sleeve, flexed his tight and toned, muscular arm and then injected the serum. Brandon wondered when he was going to start feeling the effects...? Maybe it&#39;d be a similar duration to how it felt earlier. He finally drove back to the house, noting Jake&#39;s shirt felt a little tighter on his chest.<br />
<br />
Which reminded him...<br />
<br />
As Brandon entered the house not too much later, he couldn&#39;t hear Jake around any more. Huh, he honestly hoped he could impress him with a new and improved Brandon. Eh, well, Brandon figured this would give him a reprieve. He set the serum container down and went ahead to go look for Jake. All the while, Brandon&#39;s arms were starting to feel a little stronger, tighter in the shirt sleeves. &quot;Hey, Jake! Jake! Man, are you around?&quot;</p>
