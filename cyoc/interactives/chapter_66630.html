<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jen heard heavy foot falls on the stairs, knowing only one person in the house walked like that.  Jen's older brother Justin walked into the kitchen, yawning and scratching his lightly stubbled jaw.  The nineteen year old was living at home while attending a local college, smartly taking afternoon classes so he could sleep in.  He was wearing only his boxer shorts, having just crawled out of bed, his blood hair a mess on his head.  He didn't even say anything to Jen, instead going about pouring himself a cup of cereal.<br />
<br />
As Jen watched him move about she felt an electric tingle pass through her.  She realized she wasn't just looking at him, she was staring, watching his back as he took a few bites of cereal.  She had never noticed before, but Justin was kind of cute.  He kept himself fit, his skin tanned, just the lightest dusting of blond hair between his pecs, a treasure trail peeking out from the waist band of his boxers up to his belly button.  &quot;What are you staring at squirt?&quot;  Her brothers admonishment brought Jen back to reality.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nothing, just thinking.&quot;  Jen shook her head.  She hadn't just been looking at her brother, she'd been admiring him.  Lusting.  She could feel the warmth between her legs at her arousal.  Luckily, Justin just shrugged it off and went upstairs to eat his breakfast in his room.  Jen quickly ran back to her own room, freaked out about what had just happened, and disturbed by the need that still flushed her sex.<br />
<br />
She sat down on the edge of her bed, trying to clear her thoughts.  But the more she tried not to think about it, the more images of her brother flashed through her head.  She could see his face, his lips pushing roughly against hers, his light stubble tickling her cheeks.  Before she knew it she was laying back on her bed, skirt pulled up and panties pulled down, her fingers running along her slit.  She pressed the tips of two fingers inside her, slid them in a little and then stopped.  She couldn't get more than a bit of her fingers inside her, and it seemed like less and less by the moment, until her fingers were touching unbroken flesh between her legs.<br />
<br />
She jumped off her bed, running the the full length mirror on her closet door, her skirt lifted so she could see her crotch.  Sure enough nothing was left, just a smooth mound of flesh, and her clit which looked oddly large and swollen.  She lifted her gaze to look at herself, and the image in the mirror shocked her.  Black streaks marred her blond hair, and a faint shadow on her upper lip, when she took a closer look, turned out to be more dark hair.  &quot;What the hell?!&quot;  She began to strip off all her clothes, checking for any other changes to her body.  Sure enough, when she cupped her breasts, they were smaller than they'd been in three years, or else he hands were bigger.  Or both.  Even her nipples were getting smaller as he breasts sunk back into her chest.<br />
<br />
As she looked at her image in the mirror, she noticed her skin was darker too.  She kept a nice tan, but it was getting noticeably more pronounced, her skin taking on a rich mediterranian olive complexion.  The still darkening hair on her head was retreating back into her scalp, but was also creeping down past her ears, long sideburns growing in.<br />
<br />
Her face wasn't the only place hair was growing in.  Black hair had sprouted on her crotch and legs, something she had just shaved yesterday, but know was thicker than anything she had ever had, and darker.  Her legs even looked.. meatier.  Her hips seemed to have shrunk, but her calves and thighs were taut with new muscle.  The same was true for her arms, all slenderness gone and replaced with muscle, her hands were larger as well, as well as black hair growing on her hands and forearms.  Almost fearfully she lifted an arm to confirm a batch of dark black hair had grown under there too.<br />
<br />
A flush of arousal from her groin brought her hand back down there, where her swollen clit was now sticking out from the bush of dark pubic hair she now had.  No longer where it once was, it stuck out in front of her almost an inch, and seemed to be growing by the second.  Growing as he breasts shrunk back into her chest, disappearing completely, except for two much smaller nipples showing her arousal in their own way.  The changes in her arms and legs reached her torso, her feminine frame vanishing as he shoulders grew ever broader, lean muscle now defining her stomach and chest, sleek pecs resting now where her breasts used to be.<br />
<br />
The hair on her head stopped pulling back in when she had less than an inch of black hair in a close cropped buzzcut left.  The hair on her face has continued to sprout, stubble now covering her chin, and thicker on her lips and sideburns.  Hair was growing up her stomach as well, a dense treasure trail moving up towards her stomach.<br />
<br />
Without thinking she reached down and wrapped her hand around her swollen clit, now large enough to hold in her hand, she looked down at it.  It looked like a four inch long cock.  She gave it an experimental tug, gasping at the feel of it.  She wanted to pull her hand back, but she stroked it some more as she looked at herself in the mirror.  Dark hair had sprouted in the middle of her chest and was spreading along her pecs, and downward to meet the treasure trail that was growing up from her crotch.<br />
<br />
Even her face was beginning to look alien.  All traces of her face were vanishing under a square jaw and heavy brows, her blue eyes darkening to a rich caramel color.  Her beard finished growing in, a day or so of stubble along her jaw and cheeks.  She let out a small gasp as beneath her swelling cock a scrotum she hadn't noticed filled as her two heavy balls dropped.  Now with a thick eight inches of hard cock in her hand she began to stroke the organ with eagerness, head rolling back at the new experience.  She backed up and dropped back on her bed, pumping away at her cock, and it didn't take long.  With a deep moan her new cock emptied spray after spray of thick cum into her dark black chest hair. She let go of her softening cock, a foreskin sliding up the shaft and over the head.  She rolled her head to the side, peering into the mirror.  Where she would have expected to see herself, there was instead a nineteen year old Italian stud.<br />
<br />
Even the room was different.  Gone were all the personal touches she had made to it over the years.  It looked more like a guest room, as if her old self had never existed.  She heard a cough from the door and turned to see Justin, still in just his boxers, leaning against the door frame.  He had his cocky grin on his face, a grin she used to hate, but now she loved the way it made his blue eyes almost twinkle.  He took a few steps into the room.  &quot;C'mon, Gio.  I know we couldn't have fun last night with my parents here, but couldn't you have at least waited for me?&quot;<br />
<br />
Gio?  Jen shook her head, but no, memories of a Gio were flooding into her mind, sitting right next to the old ones of Jen, which were seeming more and more like a dream.  He was Gio.  He went to the same college as Justin, they had gone out partying last night, and he decided to crash here.  Of course, Justin's parents thought they were just friends, but they were actually.. lovers.<br />
<br />
Gio grinned slightly.  &quot;Sorry, Justin, I was just thinking of you and it got all out of hand.&quot;  His voice was deep, a slight hint of New York in his accent.<br />
<br />
Justin grinned back, &quot;Well, how about we have some fun?&quot;</p>
