<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Andrew decided to rather head home and try to remove the diaper then risking to many people seeing him in it. While the diaper was beneath his jeans, it still expanded so much it was clearly visible to a knowing eye.<br />
Within the arcade, Andrew was lucky nearly everyone was distracted by the games, and the few who weren´t still had other things to do then notice him. He made sure to walk as normal as possible, because running would get more attention to him anyway. Only though the diaper, his legs were further apart, making him kind of waggle his ass even more.<br />
Once outside, Andrew had more attention on him. While he hadn´t to go far to go home, it was still a couple of streets, and there were no short-cuts he could take. Just outside was a group of six teens, who were pointing and laughing at Andrew, who got red in embarrassment, but didn´t fall to their taunting. It wasn´t the only group, and by the time Andrew reached his flat, he would put a tomato to shame with how red he had become.<br />
<br />
After a few minutes to calm his emotions down, Andrew stripped of his jeans to have easier access to the diaper. He tried again to simply open the tapes, but they still didn´t move. When he tried to cut them open with scissors, he noticed the diaper sat tightly on his skin, making no room to put the scissors between to cut it away. As he tried to cut a hole into the side, he dropped the scissors with a howl of pain. It had felt as if he had tried to cut his skin away. Maybe he had cut too far?<br />
But when he looked down there was no hole in the diaper, and also no red spot, as he was sure if he cut his skin, he would be bleeding. “Weird” he thought, before cursing the diaper again. He tried again, this time pulling the diaper´s soft material a bit away before trying to cut it, but it had the same result. It felt as if he had cut himself, but no hole was in the diaper.<br />
This time, however, there was a small flash of light next to him on the table, and when he looked, there laid a folded piece of paper that hadn´t been there before. A bit spooked out by this, Andrew carefully slow reached for the paper, as if it would bite him. The paper did nothing, so he unfolded it. It seemed to be a letter, addressed to nobody in particular, but Andrew knew it was meant for himself somehow.<br />
<br />
To the wearer of our special lifetime diaper,<br />
as we got a warning of someone trying to damage the diaper you are currently wearing, we want to inform you that after putting it on, our diaper is connected to your body like a second skin. Therefore, each try to damage it will only be painful to the wearer.<br />
Maybe you didn´t get an explanation for how our product works, so let us say the following.<br />
The lifetime diaper can´t be removed from your body anymore, as it is connected to your skin after the tapes are closed. You will never part from it until you die. The diaper is self-cleaning, without any waste to throw away for you. If you are still growing up, don´t worry, the diaper will grow with you.<br />
We hope you can enjoy our lifetime diaper in the future. Have a nice day and life.<br />
<br />
There was no signature of whatever company had developed the diaper. Andrew read the letter about five times before everything sunk in. “I´m … stuck like this? Oh God no, I can´t be forced to wear this forever.” Andrew screamed in horror. How would he be able to hide this mess?<br />
Just as he had calmed a bit, he noticed the front of the diaper turning a bit yellow, and was shocked to notice he didn´t even feel that he needed to go to the toilet. While he watched, the yellow slowly faded again, as the diaper cleaned itself again. That freaked him out again. Had he now also lost what little control he had over his bladder? Does that mean, even if he somehow could remove the diaper, he would still need it?<br />
<br />
After another hour spend in cursing the diaper and fate for being so cruel, and tearing up while trying to figure out what to do, Andrew remembered the card the arcade game had spit out to him. Maybe there was a way who that could help him. But as he pulled it out of the jeans pocket, it still only read “Wish granted” on one side, with the other being blank. “Great, that´s also no help.”<br />
As if saying the word help activated something, the card glowed a bit, and a question mark appeared on the blank side. “What´s happening?” Andrew said, having dropped the card onto the table.<br />
The question mark vanished, and words appeared instead. “This card reacted to the word “help” of its winner. Do you have any other questions?”<br />
Andrew didn´t know how to react. This card would be able to answer his questions? Maybe there still was a way out. “How can I remove the diaper I wished for before?”<br />
His hopes were crushed, however, when the card answered: “You can´t remove it. As of your wish, you won´t ever need to think about the toilet again. You will always be safe to not have an accident, as it will vanish on its own.”<br />
“But I can´t be seen wearing a diaper all the time. And it will limit my movements as well.” Andrew exclaimed, now near crying. For all he was a man, this was too much for him.<br />
Even if it wasn´t a question, the card replied to his statement. “As you are unhappy with your current situation, we will need to find a solution. Hide it with roomier pants. Let´s see if you are happy than.”<br />
Andrew was a bit confused. What did the card mean by that?<br />
<br />
While Andrew had no idea of what help the card could be, or how the idea would help, the magic of the card got to work. Andrew´s jeans, as well as any other pair of jeans he had, slowly got wider, making room for his diapered butt. At the same time, his other clothes also altered a bit. His shirts and such got wider as well, to fit with the wider jeans. That way, his clothes would hide the diaper from view, and when he looked bigger all over, the diaper wouldn´t be noticed.<br />
As the wider clothes made bending forward even harder than just the diaper, his shoes changed from laces to Velcro, so it would be easier to put them on.<br />
All Andrew noticed was his widening shirt, as his jeans laid on the ground, on top of his shoes. “What the hell? What happened to my shirt? Why is it so wide?”<br />
The card answered to his questions with a simple: “Your clothes now can hide your diaper. It´s an added effect of your wish now.”<br />
Andrew, looking alarmed at that, pulled up his jeans again, noticing how wide it was on his legs now. He also saw his shoes had changed under his jeans. “Now I look even more ridiculous than before. I look like I have lost a least half my weight in these tents my clothes have become. And what happened to my shoes?”<br />
“Your shoes changed for easier changing into them. Maybe we need to tune the wish a bit again. Please wait.” The card answered.<br />
Andrew looked at the card, slightly panicking. The last attempt to fix this mess wasn´t really any good, what would it try next?<br />
As if to answer his question, he felt pressure building inside his stomach. Before he could really guess what was happening, his flat stomach inflated outwards, quickly making his shirt fit him perfectly. As the diaper didn´t expand outwards with his stomach, but stayed in place like a tight belt, there wasn´t even an edge to be seen. His legs also thickened, and soon his wide jeans also fit him perfectly. If you didn´t know that Andrew wore a diaper, you wouldn´t guess between his now fat build underneath the clothes.</p>
