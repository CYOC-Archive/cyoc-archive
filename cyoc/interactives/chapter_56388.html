<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Hearing the other guys laughing in the showers, he grew jealous again. As he picked up the medallion, his thoughts were full of his want to be as strong and well-liked by them, and his want to humiliate them as they always did.<br />
<br />
He put his fingers between the twine, and spread it over his head. The medallion grew brighter. Almost by a force not of his own, he slipped the medallion slowly over his head, then his neck, and laid to rest there. The medallion, cold, sat on his chest. He put his arms to his side. He would have reached back into his locker to grab his boxers but he felt a slight tingling on the medallion. He looked down and noticed a short, gold, spark erupt from the medallion and onto his chest. Once. Then twice. The tingling began running through his skinny, pale chest. He reached for the medallion, wanting to inspect it more, but the third shock erupted from the medallion and held him paralyzed. “Argh!” Nathan exclaimed to himself.<br />
<br />
He was paralyzed. He couldn't move! Slightly hunched over from the forced muscle spasms caused by, he assumed, the medallion, he noticed his body beginning to change. His pecs starting growing outward. Muscle started to envelop over itself first at his pecks, then between them. “Holy shit” Nathan whispered, still slightly hunched over. He snapped his shoulders back, they were tense, “argh!” he screamed. As he bent his shoulder muscles back to their relaxed position, he noticed muscle growing over them, over his shoulder blades, protruding out, then down to his biceps, they were becoming refined, strong, and assured. He laughed a little to himself” Jesus!” he said. Looking down at his lower arms he saw veins begin to protrude and additional muscle warp itself. His hands grew.<br />
<br />
At the same time he noticed his abs expand. They contorted and slimmed, then began to grow outward: even, defined muscles forming an eight back. “Ahh!” Nathan exclaimed. “What's happening to me” he whispered as he began laughing. The experience was pleasurable! As the muscle growth began hitting his waistline, he could feel it growing, enveloping more as his waist grew. The growing waist caused his towel to become unhooked and it fell off, but Nathan didn't care at that point. He wanted to see what was happening. And he saw his expanding waist. He grabbed it. “Yes!” he said, he wanted more.<br />
<br />
His butt, formally small and flabby, began to renounce the fat, almost as if it was immediately turning it into muscle. He grabbed it and noticed it forming hard muscle on itself, growing outward, strong, and protruding. Hair also starting growing on it, and as the side ass muscles flexed in, he noticed the hair wrapping around and onto his legs. His thighs snapped and grew, becoming refined and strong. They began pecking outwards and matching the growth of his ass. Hair also began to grow on his legs, up and around his  man package. His pubes began to grow up and over his waistline, wrapping itself around his belly button and up, in a thin line toward his chest. There, hair began growing, slightly but evenly, over his new man-pecs and chest, where the medallion still rested. His arm hair grew and darkened and his arm pits tuffed a more hair underneath.<br />
<br />
“Yea, this is what I'm talking about!” He exclaimed. Happy at the new body, his body, that was forming, he noticed a huge source of adrenaline and sex-hormone erupt from his package. His balls were growing. As the semen inside him started duplicating and growing inside him, so too did the two balls become as they grew down, his package stretching with it.<br />
<br />
“Oh yes,” he said, has he reached his hands to feel it. As he did, his cock began growing too, not hardening, but matching the new size of his balls. His whole package now became proportionate to his growing legs, which were still refining. He grew a muscle crevice between his thighs and his pelvis, and began laughing as the hair finished growing on his legs, ass and feet. His lower calves grew and became defined. <br />
<br />
As the transformation ended, Nathan looked at his new, muscular, toned body. His endurance and stamina was unlike anything he ever had before.<br />
<br />
He heard the showers turn off. “Uh oh,” he said, He quickly reached in for his boxers, ready to throw them on, but one last spark from the medallion caused him to double-over again. “Argh!” he exclaimed. <br />
<br />
He knew the other guys heard him that time. “What was that” one of them asked. “Nathan? Is that you, turd?” Craig asked. <br />
<br />
But at that point Nathan didn't care, he was gaining something else. He was gaining...powers.<br />
<br />
The power of transformation, the power to turn into anything he wanted, the power to read or control other peoples minds, to leave them at his will. The power of immortality and invisibility. The power to spread the medallion's—his own—power to others, if he wanted, or to enslave them. He began laughing as he gained the knowledge of all of this, looking forward to forcing his will upon anyone he wanted. <br />
<br />
As the sparks stopped and Nathan regained his stamina, now with the knowledge of all his powers, Craig, Chris and Cameron rounded the corner of the locker and saw Nathan standing there naked. <br />
<br />
“What the fuck?” said Craig. In front of them stood a toned, fit, muscular, hairy body with just a medallion hanging around its chest. With his new body and powers, Nathan turned to the three of them and smiled an evil smile unlike any of them had ever seen.</p>
