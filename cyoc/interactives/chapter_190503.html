<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As you were out the second time by Ty that you were in a state of dream, but something was wrong when he produces a syringe and injects it into your neck. after tossing the syringe away that he tightly strapped on a collar as he was evilly laughing on to the point of satisfaction for what he was doing to you. This was no dream for it was more like a nightmare now.<br />
<br />
Quickly Looking to your right as there were doctors and a lab table, ready to be tested like some bad experiment that one was holding a drill while the docs were wearing blue robes and hats with white face masks. Rushing your Direction towards the left that you saw your parents as you began to run to them, calling even. However, they were looking at you in fear as you were running in place that they seemed to be moving away from you.<br />
<br />
As this was scaring you now to cry that The next direction made want to pee your pants for it was the dog catchers, tightly fastining a muzzle on over your face while being leashed around your neck by their pole catcher. Whimpering as they were treating you like a pet slave as they were laughting like TY was that you turn to see yourself in a zoo for everyone was laughing and pointing at you, evilly. It was then that you dreamped up to be halled away in cuffs an drive away to a facility as you were then shoved into a padded holding cell, while wearing a straitjacket.<br />
<br />
This was crazy for everyone was now in your dream laughing at you, even your own partner. This was making you want to cry as tears were falling out, but being a hyena that you are as this body wanted to laugh yourself like crazy. with that, the dream shortly ended as you were slowly gaining your barings back for you felt disorientated.<br />
<br />
You weren&#39;t sure how long you were out as you were soon awake, struggling to get your barings back from the disorientational dream. As you tryed to move your arms out that they wouldn&#39;t move for something was restraining them. Desperately struggling to free yourself now as you were somehow in a straitjacket that when you called out for help, it came out muffled for you soon realized what happened to you while also wearing a muzzle strap over your face.<br />
<br />
Remembering now as to what happened to you that you first tried on this hyena mask, went over to Ty&#39;s place for help, and... TY! You soon realized that you&#39;re still a laughing hyena who&#39;s also wearing a straitjacket while being muzzled by the strap as you remembered everything from the past events, especially Ty. All you know is that if you ever find Ty again, he&#39;d wish to reverse you back to normal again as you grunted while struggling to break free of your restraints.<br />
<br />
Struggling as you moaned that you squirmed your way out, but to no use for this was making you so frustrated to almost at the point of laughing like a hyena you now are. It was just a small laugh you let out when shortly more were soon let loose that you couldn&#39;t stop yourself from laughing anymore. You continue to laugh for you were this hyena who was laughing while looking crazy in a straitjacket while a muzzle on that this was somehow driving you crazy at this point, until you heard a door being ready to open up.<br />
<br />
You didn&#39;t know who it was as this did helped you stop laughing, but opening up the door was a brightly colored person that was wearing over sized red shoes, baggy blue overalls, white gloves, amd make up on the face with a honking red nose. Feeling as you were moving somewhere as a clown was with you at the time, you were in a clown&#39;s caravan for this clown was crazyenough to sit by you while on the road to who know where you might be at next. Well, you can&#39;t say that you ran off with the circus with a clown as you later find out there were more than just one clown for this caravan.<br />
<br />
So what now, your still restrained to move to actually run away. Even if you gotten yourself freed, where would you go? Forevermore, where were you at now? Thinking this through that you decided to wait it out and see where things take you.</p>
