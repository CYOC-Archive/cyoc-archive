<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mark awoke to semi darkness. Looking at the clock on the nightstand, he noted that the time was about five forty five. Looking over at Jessie, he silently kissed the girlish looking boy on the top of his head. Reminding himself that this was still his girlfriend, Mark got up to go use the bathroom.<br />
<br />
On the way there, he remembered something Jessie had said about there being two suits and going to locate the bag, he found that she was correct.<br />
<br />
Pulling the suit out of the bag, he noted that there obviously was more to putting on these suits than Jessie had let on to. Putting it back into the bag, he took it with him into the bathroom. Removing all from the bag, he began to figure out how all this went on.<br />
<br />
First it was what he thought might be sealer of some type with a special skin rub. After that was a body suit that looked like a fifteen year old girl, with some tomboy looks. Pulling that on, he looked at it and then tucked his penis and testicles between his legs.<br />
<br />
The slime like goo was the most confusing and after a bit, Mark figured that he was supposed to rub this on his penis, scrotum and chest. Tucking his manliness back between his legs, he moved onward.<br />
<br />
Seeing the pills and the odd electric do-dad, Mark was confused. After looking at it for a full fifteen minutes, he got the gist of it and taking the pills, began to hook himself up to the small machine and then sitting down on the toilet, proceeded to turn it on.<br />
<br />
At first he felt nothing and then his whole body went numb and when feeling returned, it felt like his whole body was shifting about. Weirdest of all was how at first he could feel his penis and testicles and then they started to drift away until he felt nothing. A slight pressure on his chest momentarily distracted him, but was soon pushed aside as he felt something wriggling about in his groin and abdomen.<br />
<br />
When all this had pretty much ground to a halt, Mark removed the clamps and stood up. Putting it back into the bag, he looked first down at his body and then into a mirror hanging on the back of the door.<br />
<br />
Looking back was a fifteen year old girl with small B cup size breasts and neatly shaved, except for the medium length red hair on her head. She stood about five foot three and could just as easily pass as a small boy. Thinking of herself as Marina and not Mark, curious about how far this all went, she raised a hand to her breast and began to gently massage her left nipple.<br />
<br />
The feeling was exquisite and the skin felt real. As she became more and more aroused, she let her hand drift down until she began to massage her swollen clitoris. Suddenly she remembered why she had come into the bathroom.<br />
<br />
Not liking to be pulled away like this, Marina lifted up the toilet lid and sat down to pee, marveled at how realistic this suit was. Finishing her business, Marina left the bag in the bathroom and began to head back to the bedroom and her waiting bisexual transgender boyfriend.<br />
<br />
Walking down the hallway, the memories floated in and she new that this one of the many things that had drawn them together. She was a tomboy, had been since she was about eight years old. It was when she  to started exploring her own sexuality, which had turned out to be bisexual, that she had met Jessie. <br />
<br />
He was a bisexual as well and had started exploring something new about himself; that he was a transgender, a woman born into a man's body.<br />
<br />
The wonderful thing about their relationship was when it came to sex, either one of them could easily be the other sex and gender. Or if they wanted it to go that way, there was no sex and gender when they made love.<br />
<br />
Plus it was fun to hang out with Jessie either dressed as a girl, something Marina helped with, or dressed as a boy, something he helped Marina do.<br />
<br />
In the bedroom, Marina climbed back into the bed and snuggled closer to Jessie. Her lover shifted and she purred in his ear, &quot;Good morning.  That was the best evening I've had in quiet awhile. Shall we give it another go.&quot;<br />
<br />
Giggling like a girl, Jessie rolled over and kissed Marina. Nodding, the girlish boy said, &quot;Yes. But I want to try something.&quot;<br />
<br />
Giggling back, Marina asked what. Holding up a strap-on, Jessie said to her, &quot;I want try using this. So, how about it lover? Will you explore new territories with me?&quot;<br />
<br />
Giggling at the way Jessie was talking, Marina nodded and then asked, &quot;But who will wear it?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jessie shrugged and laying the strap-on down between them, said, &quot;I figured we could each take turns wearing it, if that is all right with you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Marina liked that idea and then asked how they would decided who would wear it first. As both began to loose themselves in their new identities, hormones and chemicals rising, a general sense of horniness taking over them, Jessie made a suggestion on who gets to wear the sexual device first.</p>
