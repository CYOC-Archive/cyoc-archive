<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;I don't feel right,&quot; I said through throes of pain.  I managed to look at her and see that her look of shock had not faded.  I think she was more concerned now with what was happening to me.<br />
<br />
My arms were folded over each other, and clinging tightly to my stomach.  Then I felt a prick on each arm where my hands were resting on them.  As I fell to my knees I was able draw my hands out in front of me and see what had happened.  My nails were growing longer!  Not only that but they were turning pink!<br />
<br />
I felt a tickle on my neck and swung my head around to see what was the matter.  While I couldn't see what was happening, I felt it hit me right in the face.  A wave of hair smacked my cheek.  Before it could return to its position, my long-nailed hands grabbed it, holding it in front of my face.  The hair was lengthening in my hands!  It was sprawling down my neck and back.  <br />
<br />
I released my growing hair in time to see my fingers thin and my hands get smaller.  They were starting to look like girl's hands!  Holy shit, I thought.  I must be turning into a girl!  I tried to concentrate enought to wish myself back to normal, but two things stopped me.  One, I was in too much pain to really think clearly.  Second, something in my mind stopped me from doing so.  It was telling me that I had to have this woman, even if this is what it meant.<br />
<br />
I felt my jeans getting baggier in the legs.  I yanked them off as best I could without having unbuttoned them.  My legs were totally hairless.  They were also thinning, and starting to look much like Tabitha's.  I tried to stand back up but could not.  Something told me they were shrinking in size, and that I would be shorter.  My socks and shoes were hanging loosely off my feet.  I kicked them off and was greeted by the sight of pink toenails and feminine sized feet.<br />
<br />
I felt my shoulders and waist start to crunch in on me.  The pain was excruciating.  It felt like every bone in my body was stabbing my internal organs.  My shirt started to hang off me like an oversized T-shirt.  As I foudn the ability to stand once more, my boxers decided to slip off my narrowing waist, leaving me totally exposed below the waist.  I saw that my penis was still the same size.  Not for long, I thought.<br />
<br />
My arms were now hairless, as well as my chest.  My arms had already thinned to feminine size.  I felt a bulging in my hips.  I was not surprised to look and see that they were expanding.  I clutched my ass in my hands and felt it filling into them, growing soft and plump.  Plump in the female sense, not in a fat sense.<br />
<br />
A wave of pain hit my face now.  I could not see what was happening there, but I sure could feel it.  I felt my jaw push back while my cheekbones pushed out.  I could feel my ears and nose grow smaller, all while my lips started to pulsate and remain big.  I put my hands against my eyelashes and felt them grow longer.  To top it all off, my face started to contort in weird ways.  It was as if my face was silly puddy and someone was molding it to their liking.  I guessed that the power that was changing me was making any hint of maleness in my face wash away.<br />
<br />
Then I felt the tugging in my groin.  Here we go, I thought.  I looked down to see that my testicles were emptying.  The sack itself separated into two halves and pulled towards my body.  They reformed themselves into what would become the lips of my vagina.  All of the hair on my groin retracted into my body.  Evidently, that was why Tabitha's pussy was hairless.  I turned back to look at her and saw that her face was still covered in shock.  I looked back down to see my penis start to fold itself and push into my body.  I felt like I was being fucked during all this.  In a way I was.  The pain had now subsided from my body and I felt only pleasure.  I began to moan softly and heard a very feminine sound emanate from my lips.  My penis quickly found its way back into the vagina that had formed.  I let out a loud moan as it disappeared from sight.  I could feel it tucking itself away inside my body, forming my new clit.<br />
<br />
Then I felt a tugging in my chest.  The last stage of the transformation was happening.  I was growing breasts.  I could feel them pushing against my shirt.  They grew quickly, stretching my shirt out in the process.  The fabric strained and soon it gave way, ripping all across the lines of the globes that grew on my chest.  The tattered rag fell to the ground.  I felt incredibly pleasured during their growth.  They stopped growing at D cups, just like Tabitha's.  <br />
<br />
As I felt the change end, I ran in front of a mirror in the apartment's living room.  I was stunned by what I saw.  I was a knockout.  I mean, drop dead gorgeous.  The curves were where they should be, there were no blemishes on my skin anywhere.  What really stunned me was that my hair was now blonde.  I had been so caught up in the other changes to notice.  When I had looked at my hair when I initially felt it grow, it was still my natural brown color.  I just stared at my reflection, admiring what I saw.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm-hmm,&quot; I heard the sound of someone clearing their throat.  My attention returned to Tabitha, whose look of shock had faded.  But what bothered me most was that she was holding the ring in her hand!  &quot;Mind telling me what this is?&quot; she said.  &quot;And why I'm naked?&quot;</p>
