<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Under Bobby&#39;s feet appearead a huge golden glowing grandfather clock&#39;s face with the pointers. The pointers were making a audible ticking noise as the seconds slowly got slower. Suddenly the ticking stopped and the whole world begun to spin. The two glowing pointers begun to spin backwards and as they did the events that Bobby had encountered were played in reverse. Only Bobby was able to witness everything as he floated in the air like a surfer on top of a raging sea. The 360 degree rewinding felt weird as it displayed Bobby&#39;s movements and people around him walking backwards in rapid pace. The morning sun went back to the horizon and suddenly Bobby was back at home. The weird physical changes were gone as he was now back at his bedroom at a moment where he turned his sister older.<br />
<br />
Bobby could feel that the glowing grandfather clock&#39;s pointers were stopping and just like that he was back on the bed. His sister Amber was staring at him and asked if everything was okay. Bobby replied that he just spaced out and asked if she felt fine. Amber was confused and explained to him that he was going to show how old she was going to be once she grow up. Before Bobby could do anything he said to his sister that they should be quiet and the change was going to be slow.<br />
<br />
He then went to his window. Looked outside behind the curtains to check if there was somebody outside their house and went back to his bed as he felt safe that everything he just had experience was a bad dream.<br />
<br />
Bobby wasn&#39;t sure how old he wanted his sister to be. So he just pointed the ring finger and thought her sister to be old enough to drive a car. This time the 9-year-old Amber&#39;s growth was much slower. Amber asked from Bobby if it had to be that slow and bobby explained to his sister that she should have plenty of time as growing might make her clothes too small. Amber was pretty confused what her brother meant by this.<br />
<br />
In couple of minutes she was now 10-years-old and still growing older. Bobby tried to explain to his sister that he didn&#39;t want to alert their parents. This also spooked Amber a little bit so she asked if she could come next to Bobby so she wouldn&#39;t feel so scared. Bobby nodded his head and both of them were now under the same planket.<br />
<br />
Both of them whispering in the middle of the night as the now 11-year-old Amber had lot of questions. Bobby asked from her sister if she felt any different as she had clearly grown bigger. She explained that she wasn&#39;t sure. Everything around her got smaller but she couldn&#39;t tell if it was because of aging or something else. To Amber everything felt pretty much the same and she expressed jokingly that growing up must be a scam. Bobby laughed and explained to his sister that he felt pretty much same when he grew up.<br />
<br />
Suddenly as Amber was now two year shy from Bobby&#39;s age. She explained how her body felt different just now. Her sense heightened as she felt this nagging feeling in her head. Bobby explained that it might the puberty as her body is experiencing a lot of changes. Before Amber could open her mouth her face begun to fill with small zits and pimples and she felt a weird pushin inside her chest. Amber expressed how her body suddenly felt more hairier than moment ago and how she felt dirty.<br />
<br />
Bobby explained that those are the hormones that are now produced in her body. Amber was pretty anxious about the changes but felt safe as her brother had been there for her with all the explanations. Amber joked to her brother that she could touch his feet without bending and that she might be only a head smaller than him. Bobby was amazed to see how Amber was now looking more like a classmate than a sister. Bobby had seen Amber once as middle aged but felt happy that he got to see her sister being only a year younger than her.<br />
<br />
Then Amber asked Bobby a silly question: &quot;Could you make me &#39;the&#39; older sister?&quot;<br />
<br />
Bobby was a bit confused by her request but ...</p>
