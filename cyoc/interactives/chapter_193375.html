<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Pulling into the parking garage of the hospital, Nina Moreland couldn&#39;t help but chuckle. Connors dance had gone great, what wasn&#39;t expected was the fact her youngest wanted to date a fairy.<br />
<br />
After telling her husband, as well as her eldest, the three of them said that while they didn&#39;t necessarily disapprove of Connir and Spark, he would have to wait until he was older. Connor, for his part, understood. Spark on the other hand wasn&#39;t exactly thrilled.<br />
<br />
As Nina now made her way inside, she couldn&#39;t help but shake her head and laugh. To say Spark was pouting like a sullen teen would be putting it mildly. Over the past week Nina had grown accustomed to dreary music blaring from Sparks glass room, the fairy going full on emo teen on her. &quot;I wonder if this is what its like having a teenage daughter,&quot; she mused.<br />
<br />
Entering the lobby of the hospital, Nina was pleasantly surprised to see Dr. Harris. Waving to the leggy blond, Nina now approached, a polite smile on her face. &quot;Evening Nina,&quot; Julia stated. &quot;I wasn&#39;t expecting to see you again today.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I needed to talk with Jacob about something,&quot; she said. Julia nodded as the two now made their way towards the elevator. &quot;Well I just saw Jacob a few minutes ago,&quot; she said. &quot;Claudia is outside his room as he speak. You mind if I come with you? Forgot to ask her if she wanted anything for dinner.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nina nodded, the two stepping onto the elevator as Julia hit the floor. As the elevator ascended, Nina couldn&#39;t help but thank the Harris family for their help. Between Julia&#39;s care and Claudia pulling guard duty, the Morelamds were gaining a great appreciation for the family. Nina would even say she was beginning to see the younger Julia as a friend.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your welcome Nina,&quot; Julia smiled. &quot;I know how crazy things can be, especially when Katie and her sister are involved.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Crazy I&#39;m used to,&quot; Nina chuckled. &quot;I&#39;ve known Jacob since high school. I&#39;ve seen plenty of crazy in my day.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You two were high school sweethearts?&quot;<br />
<br />
Nina nodded, her mouth forming into a warm smile. &quot;Yes mame,&quot; she said. &quot;I was a freshman, Jacob was a junior.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Look at you dating an upper classman,&quot; Julia teased. Nina blushed, giggling softly. &quot;My folks had the same reaction,&quot; she smiled. &quot;To be honest, us getting together was completely by accident. We happened to meet at a Youth rifle league.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Rifle league,&quot; Julia asked, raising an eyebrow. &quot;Doesn&#39;t exactly sound like a place for romance.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It isn&#39;t,&quot; Nina chuckled. &quot;Jacob and I happened to be paired together one day during practice. We started talking and well, one thing led to another.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Out of curiosity whose the better shot?&quot;<br />
<br />
Nina smirked, holding her head up high as she glanced at Julia Harris. &quot;Youth league champ four years straight,&quot; she laughed. &quot;Its a bit of a sore spot for Jacob.&quot;<br />
<br />
The two women now laughed as they exited the elevator. Both women finding they had quite a bit in common. Both were the eldest children in their family, both had fathers who were incredibly intimidating, and both were underestimated by those around them. Despite the 12 year age difference between them, they could easily see themselves as friends. As they now approached Jacobs room, the pair gasped.<br />
<br />
&quot;Claudia!&quot;<br />
<br />
Claudia Harris lay face down outside the room. Julia now sprinted towards her sister, checking her pulse. &quot;Shes out,&quot; she sighed as she now examined her sister. &quot;I think she&#39;s been drugged.&quot; A pang of fear now began to well up inside of Nina. Sprinting past Julia, she now flung open the door, gasping in fright.<br />
<br />
A nurse now held a pillow over her husband&#39;s face, Jacob struggling to free himself. Unfortunately his hand was cuffed to the railing, effectively neutralizing him. Nina snarled, grabbing a bed pan that she now swung full force at her husband&#39;s attacker. The sound of bone on metal echoed through the room as her husband&#39;s attacker crumpled. Nina now tossed the pillow away, allowing her husband to breath as she glared at his attacker.<br />
<br />
&quot;Who are you,&quot; she yelled as she stomped down on the womans chest. &quot;Start talking!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A servant of Lord Miro,&quot; she said. &quot;One trying to prove herself worthy to receive eternal life.&quot; <br />
<br />
Nina rolled her eyes. &quot;A familiar,&quot; she groaned. &quot;Perfect just what we need.&quot; Nine now turned to her husband, Jacob having caught his breath as he looked to free himself. &quot;Honey are you okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll mange,&quot; he grunted, snapping the cuff as he now slowly made his way out of bed. &quot;Are you okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m fine,&quot; Nina said. &quot;Unfortunately it looks like we have a familiar problem.&quot; Jacob now gazed down at the woman dressed like a nurse. They would need to restrain her and interrogate her before they made their next move. &quot;Jim!&quot;<br />
<br />
As Julia now entered the hospital room with her unconscious sister, she gasped in fright as a living skull now appeared on Jacob Morelands hospital bed. Nina now turned to the skull that gazed at her with its burning eyes. &quot;Jim I&#39;m going to need a quick exit,&quot; she said. &quot;We need to get Jacob home. Can you get my Winchester?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll have Daphne get it,&quot; Jim stated. &quot;She knows how to use the teleportation rune.&quot; Nina nodded, placing the sole of her shoe on the familiars throat. &quot;How many?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll tell you nothing.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nina pressed harder, the familiar choking and gasping for air. &quot;How many!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Twelve,&quot; the familiar choked. Nina thanked her before knocking the woman unconscious. &quot;Jacob,&quot; Nina asked. &quot;We need to move. Do you think you can carry Claudia?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; he groaned. &quot;But honey I would be more help in a fight than as a pack mule.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Were not leaving Dr. Harris and her sister here alone,&quot; Nina stated. &quot;Their coming with us and you&#39;re alot stronger than I am. I can handle the fighting.&quot;<br />
<br />
Five minutes later, Nina was loading her lever action Winchester as Jacob now dressed himself. The plan was simple, make their way to Dr. Harris&#39;s car and get back to the Moreland home. As Jacob now hoisted Claudia over his shoulder, Julia fearfully looked down at the living skull. &quot;You want me to carry that?!!?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Jim can&#39;t stay here,&quot; Nina stated. &quot;I&#39;ve got my hands full and Jacob has your sister.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He doesn&#39;t bite does he?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Only if I&#39;m insulted doc,&quot; Jim stated, causing Julia to pale slightly. Nina now peaked out into the hallway, hoping to have a clear path to the parking garage. &quot;Julia is their a back entrance?&quot; Julia nodded, pointing towards a door that said employees only. Nina now cocked her rifle, holding it at the ready as the group followed slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;How you holding up Jacob,&quot; Nina asked as they descended a set of stairs. &quot;The girl is heavier than she looks,&quot; Jacob grunted. &quot;But I&#39;ll manage.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nina this is crazy,&quot; Julia hissed. &quot;Have you done anything like this before?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She used to be a hunter,&quot; Jacob stated. &quot;The two of us made quite the pair until she retired.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I wasn&#39;t going out hunting pregnant Jacob Moreland,&quot; Nina stated. &quot;Besides since I&#39;ve been home I&#39;ve given you a chance to shine.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I thought I shone pretty bright when it was just us Honey,&quot; Jacob smirked. Nina turned, a wry smile on her face. &quot;Thats what I wanted you to think,&quot; she said coyly<br />
<br />
Entering the garage, Julia now beckoned towards the rear of the garage. As Julia went to move, she could see Nina and Jacob pause and stare out into the darkness.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nina you see them?&quot;<br />
<br />
Nina nodded, leveling her rifle as she fired three quick shots towards the other end of the garage. Julia&#39;s ears were now ringing as she saw three human sized fireballs erupt before vanishing. &quot;What the hell was that,&quot; she exclaimed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Vampires,&quot; Nina said softly as she cocked her rifle. &quot;We need to move.&quot;<br />
<br />
Julia and the Morelands now quickly made their way to her car, Nina providing covering fire as they looked to make their escape. As Jacob now buckled an unconscious Claudia into her seat, he gazed back at his wife.<br />
<br />
Nina had dispatched at least 8 vampires so far, a look of both pride and undying love on the old hunters face as he watched his wife. &quot;My girls still got it,&quot; he thought. Jacobs admiration though began to turn to fear as he saw the lead vampire.<br />
<br />
Jacob didn&#39;t recognize him but could already tell he wasn&#39;t the run of the mill vampire. Carrying a claymore, the vampire simply scowled at the group as he marched forward. As Nina began to fire, Jacob was caught off guard as the vampire deflected her shots. &quot;Nina?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see it!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nina,&quot; Jacob exclaimed. &quot;Get in the car!&quot;<br />
<br />
Nina brushed a stray sandy brown hair from her eyes as she leveled her rifle at the approaching vampire. No way was this guy fast enough to deflect bullets! Another shot now rang out, the vampire seeming to cleave the bullet in two as he now growled at the woman.<br />
<br />
That was all it took for Nina Moreland. Realizing she was in over her head, the hunters wife jumped into Julia Harris&#39;s waiting car as the doctor now slammed on the brakes making a speedy getaway.<br />
<br />
Duncan now grumbled, lowering his claymore as he furrowed his brow. He had received news late that a group of familiars and some lesser vampires were making a move against Jacob Moreland. By the time he had arrived, the Morelands had already made their way to a waiting car. Now, with the Morelands escaping Duncan would delve out a sever punishment to those that had foolishly attacked this hospital.</p>
