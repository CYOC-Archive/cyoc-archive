<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Hear me out. I have a very good plan. I&#39;m going to go gambling in this body. I&#39;m gonna make so much money. I can magically change the doohickeys around so I can make some money. I&#39;ll lose every now and then and pretend that I&#39;m falling behind for a while, then I&#39;ll stop at a few thousand dollars. Nothing more than $3,000. My brother came up with the idea.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Of course he did.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah. So...I&#39;m gonna swap Ramsey with one of the other teachers. Lucky we&#39;re going to the same school, huh!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s a small town,&quot; Principal Petrucchio sighed. The middle school and high school had to share the same building due to budget cuts and lack of students. He rubbed the middle of his nose in a very grown up manner, indicating he was tired and stressed and that was a great gesture for a man in his 50s nearing retirement. But it looked a little ridiculous on his barely teenage frame compared to the goofy grin the grown man next to him was wearing. <br />
<br />
&quot;What? That&#39;s why you took my body?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Well yeah. We can make a ton of dough as grownups. And then I&#39;ll have enough money to...do things.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;What things?&quot; Martin narrowed his eyes, suspiciously. Even at the age of 13, he looked intimidating. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well...I just want to make friends. I can take people out to eat and I can buy some cool designer clothes. And then, I can get Randy&#39;s friends to hang out with me and not him. Then if everyone likes me, he has to like me, too.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Okay...that&#39;s actually not a terrible strategy but...you shouldn&#39;t have to buy friends. How do you know they&#39;re actually your friends if you&#39;re always buying them things? When you run out, they might stop being friends with you.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah. I should go for five thousand instead.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;No! No, you could get arrested if they think you&#39;re cheating. Do NOT go to jail in my body, I am warning you, young man!&quot; He pointed a tiny finger as he stood up, forgot his new size and then looked way, way up at Logan&#39;s now adult face. His face was now arrogant, grinning, with an impossibly handsome face. HIS handsome face, which he missed having! He didn&#39;t even have any stubble he could shave every morning, for crying out loud! He rubbed his baby smooth cheeks. None at all. It made him feel so...small and un-masculine. <br />
<br />
&quot;Alright. You know what? I want a cut. I want 50% and I&#39;ll pretend to be you for a few days. Just make sure to lose a lot as well as win and bring home $5,000. Tell them who you are, make a big deal out of never winning this much while gambling before. Make it look natural, like you just had one hell of a weekend. Tell them what you do, and tell them you served in the military if they ask any questions. Make sure my cut is at least $500 for every day I&#39;m in your body. That&#39;s how much I&#39;m charging you. And I won&#39;t say anything to your father.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;30 percent,&quot; Logan tried to negotiate. &quot;And I don&#39;t give you detention...young man.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll tell your parents,&quot; Principal Martin said bluntly. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yeah. I forgot about that! I shouldn&#39;t have told you about them being wizards! Stupid! I should have listened to Ramsey more. He came up with this idea.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;500 bucks a day. Deal?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Deal. I&#39;ll go to the casino Saturday night and give it back Sunday.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;What are you going to do Friday night? Why not just go tomorrow night and swap back Saturday?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Ramsey is doing something else with his grownup body tomorrow. Don&#39;t worry, it&#39;s nothing bad,&quot; Logan assured the small teenage boy. <br />
<br />
&quot;Who is he swapping with?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I um...can&#39;t remember. Someone...anyway, um...you can go back to class, young man!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, I&#39;m having my kids come over this weekend!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh. Well...I can babysit for you!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yes, you are,&quot; Martin said in his juvenile body, adopting the dad pose when speaking up to his young charge. Hands firmly on hips. &quot;My little Brayden is six and he needs a lot of attention. You&#39;ll play board games with him and play make believe with his stuffed animals and make all his meals for him.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Um...maybe I should say I can&#39;t do it this weekend.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;And give my ex wife leverage over me? Oh no, you are babysitting or I am going to your parents and I will ruin your plan. Now, my older kid is your age, so you have to act as mature and adult as possible, okay? No antics. Just pretend you&#39;re me and make sure Owen has lots of time to himself. He&#39;s been sulking lately. He&#39;ll probably spend the whole time in his room reading comics or watching horror movies. I&#39;ve been trying to teach him there&#39;s more to life. I was going to drive him out to the lake to take both my boys rowing, so you&#39;ll just have to say it&#39;s gonna have to wait until next weekend.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;No...no, I can do that. I can take the boys rowing.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;No, you can&#39;t. It requires driving and you are NOT driving MY car.&quot;  <br />
<br />
&quot;Can you remember how to drive??&quot; Logan asked smugly, fishing his new keys out of his pocket and grinning like he&#39;d just won the lottery. This kid is having way too good a time in my body, thought Martin. <br />
<br />
&quot;I...sure. You...there&#39;s the ignition.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Okay but you have no actual memories of driving. It&#39;s like you&#39;re me when it comes to driving.&quot; Logan snickered smugly and jangled the keys in front of Martin&#39;s face. &quot;I got that, too. So now I&#39;m just as good a driver as you so...I will drive us out to the lake. And you can walk home. I&#39;ll give you directions. So, do we have a deal, YOUNG MAN?&quot;<br />
Logan tried to make his new adult voice sound even lower and delighted at the tone of it, lower than he could have ever made before! He sounded like a total stud now! Bet girls were going to go wild over his new voice! <br />
<br />
Girls? Women. Girls in bikinis. Women in bikinis. Bikinis everywhere. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey. Um. That&#39;s um...weird. Thinking about girls. Boobies.&quot; He thought about breasts and how much he loved to caress him. &quot;No way, I&#39;m thinking about boobs!&quot; Logan tried to keep his voice down but he was now definitely panicking. He had a horrified look on his face and he wrung his hands, then bit his nails. &quot;Oh, this is weird. I&#39;m supposed to be gay. I&#39;ve never liked girls.&quot; He clamped his mouth shut. &quot;Shit. Don&#39;t tell anyone, okay!?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Logan, I would never divulge that about...wait, so that does that mean....&quot; Martin concentrated on the handsome stud of a DILF in front of him, perfect in every way. And that package of his. Wait, that used to be his package! Wonder what it would be like to suck on a big juicy dick, he thought. No! &quot;No way. This is beyond messed up. We have to switch back, young man. I do NOT want to...be gay.&quot; he whispered the last two words.<br />
<br />
&quot;No way. This is beyond messed up. We have to switch back, young man. I do NOT want to...be gay.&quot; he whispered the last two words in a hushed tone. &quot;This is too weird. I don&#39;t want to walk around thinking of other men that way.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Think of it...think of it this way. You&#39;re always talking about how like, we should learn to respect each other and stuff so....like...maybe you can learn what it&#39;s like to be gay and then...you could understand gay kids better and and...um...stuff.&quot; <br />
<br />
Martin sighed. &quot;Alright. You&#39;re not going to change us back. Three days. You have three days before I go to your father and mother.&quot; <br />
<br />
&#39;Yes!!! Thank you! See, you should always listen to your elders. Isn&#39;t that right...son?&quot; Logan clamped a big friendly hand on his body&#39;s tinier shoulders. &quot;Now...off to class with you. I&#39;ll just give Randy detention.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;NO. You were both at fault.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Okay...than I&#39;ll give you BOTH detention! You can stay here after school today. Less time for you to spend with my family, right? Right? And you like school! You like being here! You even got a job here!&quot; <br />
<br />
Martin gave him as dirty a look as his 13 year old face could muster. <br />
<br />
&quot;Fine. I&#39;ll serve your detention. You owe me real big and not just the money. You&#39;re going to be a VERY well behaved boy after you get back in your own body. And you and Randy are going to work together on school projects from now on. I want you two working on decorations for the winter dance together. That&#39;s what we call a real bargain, son.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t want to, though!&quot; Logan whined. <br />
<br />
&quot;STOP. Acting that way,&quot; Martin warned, with a cold frozen stare. Logan gulped. Even in his new big body, he didn&#39;t like that look at all. It reminded him of his dad. &quot;Men do not whine and complain like children. So man the fuck up, and start acting like a mature, responsible adult, or I will make your life a living hell over the next few months. Man up. Act mature. You got that?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes...yes, I...I got it.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Say that you understand and call me Sir,&quot; Martin folded his 13 year old arms. <br />
<br />
&quot;I understand...Sir,&quot; Logan mumbled. &quot;Ugh. FINE. You win. I&#39;ll be really super duper good and be as grownup as you. It&#39;s not like it&#39;s hard.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh really. Well I expect you to be courteous and encouraging and listen attentively to anyone that comes through that door. Now, a few things you need to know about the job...you have to evaluate a stack of paperwork. I don&#39;t remember how to do my job.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I think...I do,&quot; Logan grimaced. &quot;I do know how to do your job,&quot; he said, disbelieving as he went through the paperwork on his new desk. He wasn&#39;t sure he liked this part. &quot;These are requisition forms. For school supplies. And...and these are class evaluations. You evaluate all our classes?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;To make them better. What do you think I do all day?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I dunno. Yell at innocent kids who didn&#39;t do anything?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t try and be a victim, Logan.&quot; <br />
<br />
The grown man in a suit rolled his eyes dramatically back and forth, looking very immature. Martin told him immediately to stop rolling his eyes. <br />
<br />
&quot;No drama. Behave yourself. Best behavior. Three days and then we change back. I want at least $1,500 if not more.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Okay. Deal.&quot; <br />
<br />
Man and boy shook hands. <br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, now let&#39;s exchange some info. Who do you live with?&quot; Principal Petrucchio and the young man impersonating him exchanged basic info, and addresses with directions. <br />
<br />
The boy was about to leave. &quot;Mr. Petrucchio&quot; cleared his throat to get attention. &quot;I...think you&#39;re forgetting something, young man! Fighting in the hallways is a detention!&quot; He made his voice sound authoritative. &quot;No more of that nonsense, and I don&#39;t want to hear any more excuses. Understand me...Logan?&quot; Logan raised his eyebrows with a huge smirk on his face as he wrote his first detention slip, and held it out for his principal. <br />
<br />
The boy took it and left, gritting his teeth as he did so. Imagine the humiliation of a principal having to go serve detention for the student he wanted to serve it to! Hahahahaha! Logan was overjoyed. Serves him right! <br />
<br />
After he left, the new Martin Petrucchio asked his secretary to send in Randy to tell him a few things about bullying... <br />
<br />
He frowned. And then he had a TON of work to do! He had so many people that wanted to talk to him on the phone. He was supposed to get back to about seven parents that wanted to talk to him that day alone. Not to mention the schoolboard told him to expect a call at 3 PM. Then he had to drive himself home. Drive! He got to drive! <br />
<br />
Logan had mixed feelings. He didn&#39;t want to work and this was unexpected work. He thought he would just coast impersonating as Mr. Petrucchio. He looked in his mirror and grinned. Irish and Italian looks combined into one hell of a handsome man. It&#39;ll be hard to give up being this good looking, he thought. Ever since he had become this tall, handsome adult man, he couldn&#39;t help but feel the thrill of it, the big muscles now attached to him, the lowered voice, the...the fact that he could do things that boys in high school only dreamed of doing...<br />
<br />
He hardened himself. Man up, he told himself. You wanted this, now you have to prove you can be every bit as grown up as Mr. Petrucchio. That way you can tell him so later, he thought, tackling the stack of paperwork in front of him with renewed vigor.</p>
