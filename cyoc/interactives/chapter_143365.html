<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">as you were serving up their drinks that you quickly bent down to fetch some more glasses, but You suddenly hear a whistle for you then stand back up to notice an anthro hyena man while also with him was an anthro skunk man. obviously drunk from having too much beers to drink is where both of them reek of it as they were looking at you from the bar with big dopey smiles. if it wasn&#39;t for the fur you have on you now that they would see you blushing as it was making you feel uncomfortable, even if they were giving you strange looks to give you the creeps.<br />
<br />
&quot;hay there doll face! *hic* such a fine ass you got there!&quot; The skunk cheered that even the hyena man joined in.<br />
<br />
you then looked to the group from before as more came in. offering a big tip for their drinks that the female anthro you just served drinks to were a rat, a lynx, and a ferret soon left the bar, with an evilish grin on their faces. picking up the tip and putting it away while cleaning up the girls area that soon after is when you walked up to the drunks as they still looked at you with smiles on their faces.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aw, did we upset the *hic* pretty doll face now?&quot; the hyena said. it wasn&#39;t long after before the skunk man chugged his beer down and joined in on the hyena man&#39;s fun.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah! besides, Those knockers you have there really do liven up the mood around here. do you ever get guys who ask for milk from those jugs you’re carrying?&quot; the skunk man said as you not only smell him drunk, but also the way he smiled for that&#39;s what you expect from a drunk skunk.<br />
<br />
One of the animals who just came in from before rolled his eyes at them that the one who did this was actually a lion. he groaned from his group table and said softly for only his table could hear.&quot;Ugh, more drunk bastard. just what we need before daylight.&quot;<br />
<br />
once fully a the drunken table they were sitting in that You sighed at the men as you then you facepalmed them at once while seeing your black paw like hand in fur. well, you kinda know what you were now as you narrowed it down to just a few animals with black fur At least. yet still, you had to deal with these idiots first.<br />
<br />
&quot;excuse me Sirs, but I’m going to have to ask you to...&quot; you began to say to them, but it wasn&#39;t long as they both then started to busted out laughing. one even looked at your breasts and said that You’re rack were looking nice for He then lunged forward and grabbed onto your breasts with his claws as you screamed by this action he made on you. &quot;Gah!&quot;<br />
<br />
The lion slammed his fist on the table as he then stood up from his stool and growled. &quot;ok, That’s it! You guys are out of here!&quot;<br />
<br />
it was shortly after that He and the another animals stood up and went over to their drunken table as they grabbed them by the arms and dragged the drunks out. they all include an anthro cheetah man, a wolf man, a bear man, and an anthro tiger man. while they all did this that both equally hurled up and vomited the bar floor as they left out of sight.<br />
<br />
You groaned as you took a moment to compose yourself. sighing in distress, you then thought about cleaning the boys mess up. &quot;well, Guess I better clean that up.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;i&#39;m afraid that’s my job. I&#39;ll take it from here. still though, thanks for the offer newbie.&quot; said an anthro opossum man in a janitor uniform as he came out from the kitchen door to your right that of all things, You watched him grab a mop and a wet floor sign for he quickly start to clean up the puke on the floor.<br />
<br />
&quot;ah, lesion. if any one asked where i am, tell them that i&#39;m in the bathroom. there&#39;s something that i need to do.&quot; you said as the opossum man nodded.<br />
<br />
You walked off into a restroom and you quickly saw what you were in the bathroom stall mirror that was over the sink. with a bit of black fur in most areas that you found out what female anthro you were, an anthro female raccoon girl as you remember reading a comic called the realm of kaerwyn while looking almost like niixa the raccoon.<br />
<br />
You had become an anthro raccoon girl, and a damn hot one at that Your breasts were C cups as your ass was nicely plump and rounded. Your uniform consisted of multiple pieces of clothing that a white sleeved shirt was under a black v vest, which showed off a bit of your ample sized breasts for it wasn&#39;t to revealing as it was only visible for all to see on the top side. The revealing top area also left open a large enough to reveal almost all of your cleavage of your stomach and hips that it felt as if the only areas of your breasts were only covered by the sides, the fronts, and the bottom of them for you also weren’t wearing a bra.<br />
<br />
you noticed that you were also wearing a black collar bow tie around your soft furry neck. looking back at the mirror that your upper half looks like someone who works at the casino while Your lower half of the uniform was covered by a small black leathery mini-skirt around your waist. should you to bend over enough is where everyone would most likely see your glorious ass as you were wearing white panties that your outfit kinda looks like Rio&#39;s from the tv show &#39;Rio rainbow gate.</p>
