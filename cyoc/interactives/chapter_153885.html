<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">THEN (the story so far)-you received some free passes from work to visit the zoo, but back At home that you misplace your two tickets someplace as you were able to only could find one. you weren&#39;t planing on going in a group anyways as you decided for The best time to go was at nightfall that You did manage to get to the zoo, however the roads were packed for it was almost close to closing time. you later hand the lady your ticket and walk in.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve drove all the way out here that I&#39;m not leaving here, until I see some attractions!&quot; you say aloud as it looked like any other normal zoo. There were hardly any people around at the time, so why was this place so special that this starts to get you a bit nervous about it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe they&#39;re someplace else.&quot; you say as the answer shortly after dawns on you when something happened. The lights begin to go out in the zoo that you ran back to the entrance, but only to find it locked tight that there was no way you could climb the gates with nothing much to grab onto.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh no.&quot; you say for this was Just great as this was your day off, and now you&#39;re locked in...a zoo. You later decide to wander on a dark pathways while hoping to find another way out, or at least meet someone who can help you and let you out that Something glints in the moonlight from below a bush caught your eye as you then take a closer look to only find an old lamp.<br />
<br />
&quot;well, at least it&#39;ll give me a bit of extra light here. Even if there&#39;s no genie in it.&quot; you mutter as you begin to rub some of the dirt off that Suddenly, a plume of golden smoke rises from the lamp.<br />
<br />
it would Seem that there really was a genie in there after all as The smoke solidifies into a large 7-foot tall anthromorphic tiger. the djinn is very muscular, but wore only a pair of puffy shorts, a turban, and several items of jewellery. he was intimidating compare to you, even by height as he seems nice enough.<br />
<br />
&quot;Greetings, mortal.&quot; he said. showing off his sharp teeth that he was actually smiling at you.<br />
<br />
&quot;Y-you&#39;re not going to eat me. are you?&quot; you gasp at this creature that The tiger genie laughs loudly by this.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course i&#39;m not, Master. Not unless you&#39;re into vore and request it, but my powers are mostly limited to transformation. yet I am here to grant you three wishes. Are you ready for your fist wish, Master?&quot; the tiger djinn said as you tell him that you&#39;ve been locked in here accidentally overnight while trying to wish to transport yourself out, but he couldn&#39;t for he only deals with transformations spells.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry master, but I don&#39;t do transportation magic. I could however grant you wings for you to fly out.&quot; the tiger djinn replies as you asked why he couldn&#39;t just give himself wings that his form must always be a tiger, Not even a winged tiger.<br />
<br />
saying his sorry about it that you then asked if he had a magic carpet or something, anything. going through his pockets that the djinn said there&#39;s No carpet. this was just Terrific as you soon lost your patience is when you then told him off that if you wanted to be transported out, then he had to do it.<br />
<br />
&quot;But Master, I&#39;m not skilled in transportation magic. even if I manage to transport us, I cannot control as to where we end up. let alone on what we might end up for We might not even make it out of the zoo.&quot; the tiger djinn replies softly to you.<br />
<br />
&quot;Look, I&#39;m your master as I&#39;m prepared to take that chance. now then, I WISH FOR YOU TO DO IT NOW.&quot; you say.<br />
<br />
&quot;alright, your wish is my command. just so you know, it&#39;s on your head.&quot; the genie replies as he swiftly starts hopping around you on one paw while murring strangely that he was waving his arms around, until suddenly the two of you vanish with in a poof of smoke!<br />
<br />
as the poof of smoke cleared that You did got teleported out of the zoo, but you felt really weird while having trouble moving around in a dark area for you manage to feel what appears to be your room. yelling for the djinn as to what happened to them and where was he that you Suddenly start putting the pieces together for what came out wasn&#39;t your voice, but his for you didn&#39;t even see him anywhere nearby. starting to get scared of knowing what happened to him while You were very confused that you heard a voice, your voice as you turned around to see, you.<br />
<br />
&quot;I was forced to change you into me while changing myself into you. in other words, we switched bodies.&quot; The genie responded with the use of your voice that not wanting to believe what was going on is where you began looking yourself over to see if he was lying, but truth be told in horror as you look back in the mirror to see your the new 7-foot tall large anthromorphic tiger for you were now very muscular while wearing only his pair of puffy shorts, turban, and several items of jewellery.<br />
<br />
still not wanting to believe the out come of what has just happened that you wished to be back in your own bodies, but nothing happened as fear ran down your furry spine on what this meant. not only did he now had full control of your two remaining wishes you once had own as you hadn&#39;t used them up just yet, but this made you really think about what you had done. desperately panicking, yelled out to switch you both back now as it did no good.<br />
<br />
&quot;silly little djinn, I see you&#39;re starting to realized what kind of mistake you just made now. still though, what kind of wish it would be if you&#39;re now trap in a body of a Djinn and could just wish your way out of it. still, you brought this upon yourself as I warned you that I was no good at transportation magic. looks like it&#39;s just you and me now genie, but not for long.&quot; you, he said with an evil like grin.<br />
<br />
&quot;and what&#39;s that suppose to mean?&quot; you asked in anger, but it was soon turned into fear when he shortly lifted up the lamp as you started to get the idea of putting two together that he then sat the lamp down and slowly walked closer to you.<br />
<br />
&quot;oh, you&#39;ll see-.&quot; the genie started to say gently, while in your body. &quot;you see my furry djinn, I know what makes people tic to go the extra mile on there greatest sins. their darkest impulses to a force they have an urge for, and their greatest fears as to what their afraid of that I know your greatest fear has just come true! you may of had a friend or two, someone to lead a hand. when times were tough as you look to them to get out of a jam, but now no matter where you turn that there&#39;s now one here but you for your alone. yet, now as a genie that you must carry on what I was put through for we djinns have but one code to live by. to follow our master&#39;s wishes for they carry our lamps, our life, our home. still though, you must know a thing or two about the genies in the bottle of old. right?&quot; he said that you, now as a tiger djinn knew what lies ahead of you.<br />
<br />
&quot;if I remember right, genies can only grant the power of three wishes to their masters. however, djinns can&#39;t make anyone fall in love, can&#39;t kill anyone, nor bring anyone back from the grave. the djinn also fear of their lamps being destroyed for if you destroy it, you destroy the djinn themselves. such a thing is greater then all the magic, then all the treasure, then all the world that is like having the ultimate cosmic power, in a tiny little space! that right?&quot; you asked the once genie as he was now in your body, as you were in his.<br />
<br />
&quot;that&#39;s mostly part of things. the only thing is though that most of the djinns were created, and granted these powers by king Solomon himself. other then the lamps to hold us genies in that as long it&#39;s made of metal and something you hold dear to, then the djinn can be place into those items with our seal mark. still though, most djinn can also be equip to a partial, to a full body djinn equip. with that though, only the master can carry up to seven genies as each djinn has a special power they command over.&quot; he said as this stuns you to the core.<br />
<br />
&quot;and let me guess at a whim here, i&#39;m in command over the power of transformation magic?&quot; you said as you were a bit uneasy to here this through his tiger ears while having it coming out of your own lips that the answer came next was a yes. crying as you fell and sat down onto your knees that your human life was now his for the life of a genie was now yours, unaware he was digging through your memories and adding them to his own while you were somehow doing the same with his.<br />
<br />
within about 5 to 10 minutes after, you each remembered someones else&#39;s memories for you remembered his as he did with yours. still wanting to switch back to what you were once before that something told you what lies ahead of you, knowing your in the body of a tiger genie now for he was your master at the time. it wasn&#39;t long after till he soon started on something, but what?<br />
<br />
NOW (back onto the story at hand)-&quot;you know, i can understand why you want to switch back to your own body. still though, I can&#39;t wait to try this out.&quot; you, or rather genie said in your body that you kinda knew what to expect was coming up next as the djinn returned back for the lamp.<br />
<br />
you wanted to switch back and end this nightmare, but how could you as he was the master now that you even pleaded to the genie while crying in tears. &quot;p, please... change us back...now! please, i&#39;ll...i&#39;ll do as you ask of me that i&#39;ll even do anything you want. i&#39;m bagging you please, anything.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;anything? hmm, maybe I can use you for something after all. if you play your cards right, then maybe we&#39;ll both switch back to our original bodies in no time at all. until that time comes however, I want you to stay out of the lamp and stay as our very own tiger butler while having you doing the chores of one in the outfit you&#39;re wearing now. still, you&#39;ll need a few things to show that you belong to us.&quot; the genie said while heading to your closet, looking for what appears to be your box of kinky stuff that was inside it.<br />
<br />
pulling out a ball gag, cuffs, rope, a collar with a tag and leash attached to it, and a leather strap harness that it wasn&#39;t long till the genie strapped everything on your tiger body and displayed you out to show. feeling two things happening right now that thirst the thing going on was feeling embarrassed to be displayed like a toy on a self while struggling to break free from your binds, but the more you did is where you felt scared....and pleased. the second feeling was this was turning you on so badly that there was even a butt plug, up your ass for it didn&#39;t even help when the genie was grabbing your furry balls which were under the outfit.<br />
<br />
this continued for you soon came with sperms as it was like a flower blooming its flower petals, untill there was a knock on your bedroom door. struggling as you didn&#39;t want anyone seeing you like this that your imposter stopped with the fun and headed over to the door and see who it was. once there as the imposter opened the door that it was.....<br />
who could it be at the door?<br />
<br />
(this is where you decide who&#39;s at the bedroom door as the imposter you answers and opens the door. feel free to add your very own ideas as there are a few down below. beware though, it could be someone that might case harm and spill secrets to the both of you as it could also be someone you know which might help you with your bondage situation while getting away from your imposter. again, thank you and happy readings readers.)</p>
