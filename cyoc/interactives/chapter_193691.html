<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was time for them to hit their first stop. They had past nothing but farmland and cows recently, but Route 66 had more to offer than that. Henry managed to get a motel for the family just a few minutes from the highway. Judging by the uncomfortable squeezing they had to do, he figured now was the best time for the family to get some R&R outside the car. They had the whole week, there was no need to rush. More than just the family would change on this trip though…<br />
<br />
Henry got out of the car and walked up to the office to get checked in while Linda ordered a few pizzas for the family. Just as he got to the concierge, he had a thought that just pushed out of his head without any filter. “A room for 5 please, and do you know where I can find some beer?” Henry had never really had beer around his family, he was a light-weight with the guys or the designated driver. What was even weirder was the concierge, who never took her eyes off of him. They were eyeing him like a predator on the hunt, undressing him with their eyes. He thought it was his outfit, which he swore fit loose this morning, that now didn’t even hide his gut or ass. His whole body started to grow thin brown hairs that were getting thicker by the minute, making him attempt to pull his pants up and his shirt down. <br />
<br />
Walking outside of the office led to an area that looked completely different than when they had first arrived. There was a convenience store and gas station, an arcade, a jewelry store, and a massage parlor. The air that hung around the area smelled strongly of manure, but he had no idea why. The thing that really made Henry concerned was that all the people were cows. From overly muscular to morbidly obese, all of them were big, gassy cow anthros. He kept thinking that it looked wrong, but his body actively did nothing to question it. Walking back to the family’s ride, it had expanded into a souped up RV with door wide enough to fit someone twice his size an a seating area the size of a small room. He picked up an internal radio and pushed a few buttons before speaking into it, “This is our first stop, I’m grabbing some beers from the convenience store and unpacking our stuff for the night, y’all have fun and come back when you’re ready.” With that, he hung up the radio and walked off to the convenience store, thinking he sounded a little cold and harsh. All he had in his mind was getting some beers and relaxing in the room after a good day’s drive. <br />
<br />
Henry walked into the convenience store and saw a few bull anthros inside, some muscular, some chubby, all barely clothed with just some overalls or a flannel button-up and some ripped jeans with the buttons undone, their musky dick bulges not passing Henry’s notice. His mind would constantly be bothered by it, but he just shrugged it off as normal as he walked to the beer section. None of the normal brands were stocked, only cattle themed ones like Red Eyes, Horn’s Premier, Heifer’s Ass, and Moo Moo Beer. He picked up two cases of the least offensive looking one, still wondering why everything was so weird and wrong in his mind, but he just took it as a desperate need for a beer and moved to check out. He also picked up a few bags of dessert cakes while at the checkout line and took a look at the cashier. Unlike the concierge, this anthro actively flirted with him. “Getting all squared away for the night big boy? You’re wife’s a lucky one to get a stud like you.” The cow looked just as masculine as he was, but maybe he was just being nice. Henry took the compliment and told the cashier, “Once I get one of these in my belly, I’ll finally be rid of this headache, it’s been bugging me all day.” The cashier grabbed a tall can from behind the counter, “Well, how about one in the house? Moo Moo is my favorite.” Henry wanted to question it, why this slightly chubby bull was hitting on him, why he felt like his mind and body were fighting each other, why his vacation was making him so fat, but he accepted the beer and chugged it down letting the rest of his change take place right there. With each gulp of beer, he grew taller and wider, his brown body hair thickening into fur and his hair taking on a reddish blonde color. His shoulders stretched out wide enough to be a bodybuilder’s, though Henry was never that built in his human form. His pecs swelled up and popped this shirt open, showing the cashier his impressive bod. His gut swole up a bit, becoming a muscle gut, while his thighs and ass followed suit. His feet destroyed his shoes as bark brown hooves replaced them. His jeans ripped and tore to shreds trying to contain the newly forming bull’s mass, and especially his newly formed package. His tail shot out as his dick stretched out and changed shape into a more bovine look. Lastly, his face and ears changed as he finished chugging the tall can of beer, his horns being just as prominent as his dick. Crushing the can against his head, he tossed it into the trash without looking s Henry let out a monster belch right into the cashiers face, making him and the cashier simultaneously cum in their undies. The new Henry was now a 7’ 5” brown bull with reddish blonde hair and a bit of fat but a lot more muscle. He thanked the cashier and carried his beer and cakes over to his motel room, turning the key and letting himself inside. He turned the TV on and watched some sports as he chugged beer and ate dessert cakes, letting some putrid beer farts out into the room before his family got back.</p>
