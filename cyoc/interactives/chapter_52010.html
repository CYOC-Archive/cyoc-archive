<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was a day after Kurse died and Rick was standing at the railing of the yacht. Maylene and Dennis came to the railing too Maylene asking, &quot;What are you thinking about?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just what happened to us on the island,&quot; Rick said sighing. &quot;How we became a bear, you a pig, and Dennis a chimera. How we came so close to losing each other.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you trying to say?&quot; Maylene asked looking a little hopeful.<br />
<br />
&quot;We're saying that one of us wants to marry you,&quot; Rick said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yes I'll marry you,&quot; Maylene said throwing her arms around Rick and kissing him. Once she was done she asked, &quot;So when should we get married? I would like it to be as soon as we get back. Or I think the captain has the power to marry us. We could get married today.&quot; She was obviously very excited and missed Rick's use of us when referring to himself.<br />
<br />
Rick sighed and said, &quot;It's not that easy. There's a secret we need to tell you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What secret?&quot; Maylene asked looking forlorn.<br />
<br />
&quot;Have you noticed the words we have been using?&quot; Rick asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I know you didn't ask me properly about marrying me but other than that it's been a normal conversation,&quot; Maylene said looking very confused.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then you haven't noticed that we've been using we instead of I,&quot; Rick said and sighed. &quot;There's a reason for that. You see there are two souls in this body.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Two souls?&quot; Maylene asked. &quot;You mean like those wolves who had been split into two?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not like them,&quot; Rick said. &quot;We've been in the same body since the age of five. Since that time we've been able to work together most of the time so no one knew there were two souls in this body. Now being transformed by Kurse that unity has been torn.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So you're actually two people?&quot; Maylene asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Rick said. &quot;One of us is Rick and the other is Hanna. Rick does want to marry you but Hanna sees you as a mother. That's why we haven't asked you to marry us. Maybe we could have before eventually but we can't ask now with both of us in the same body.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So what are we going to do?&quot; Maylene asked. &quot;How will I know when I'm talking to Rick and when I'm talking to Hanna?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hanna is a child so it would be easy to tell,&quot; Rick said. &quot;However we have an idea. Before those eight lion cubs disappeared we went to talk with them. They told us that if we chose they could transform us into two separate people. We wanted to talk it over with you first and have been trying to think of a way to start.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Will it change you from who you are now?&quot; Maylene asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Only some minor changes,&quot; Rick said. &quot;In personality at least. In body might be different.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;In what way?&quot; Maylene asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well Hanna wants to be a little girl,&quot; Rick said. &quot;She thinks it would be neat to be a glass wolf pup though without the ability to transform others she takes through mirrors. Like we said she sees you as a mother but she also wants to be with the wolf pack.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So she wants us to become wolves?&quot; Maylene asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Only if you want,&quot; Rick said. &quot;Rick will become a wolf if you do.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What about Dennis?&quot; Maylene asked looking at him.<br />
<br />
&quot;He'll need to choose on his own,&quot; Rick said. &quot;If we do this he'll go from being an only child to having a sister who's a glass wolf pup. What do you want to do Dennis?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I liked being with the wolves,&quot; Dennis said. &quot;They have a huge library will thousands of books. I want to stay human but I liked being naked with the wolves.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well we also talked to the two betas,” Rick said. “They believe that there could be a place for some humans at the Smith estate. It would be a new start in a new town. However if we’re to use the game we have to hurry as they do plan on removing the turns from Glendale. Which is why we asked the cubs to come back for us. We also think that Marie and her family should come with us.”<br />
<br />
“Why is that?” Maylene asked.<br />
<br />
“The other passengers may be nice to them right now but that may not last,” Rick said. “We all had our very souls twisted by Kurse and that will leave a scar that just won’t go away. We’re afraid that if Marie stays on the ship that the constant reminder of what we went through will make some of the other passengers snap.”<br />
<br />
“If they come with us wouldn’t it be the same with them around the wolves?” Maylene asked.<br />
<br />
“Perhaps but we think it won’t be as bad,” Rick said. “We should go talk to them though. It will be up to them if they want to come.”<br />
<br />
Maylene nodded and they went off to find Marie and her parents. They found them in their cabin Candice playing with her new sister. Mark was playing a video game he had brought along. Their parents were watching over them with a mixture of joy and worry. &quot;Mr., Mrs. Thorton,&quot; Rick began, &quot;we need to talk to you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What about?&quot; Mrs. Thorton asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;We've asked the lion cubs to come get us today,&quot; Rick said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why would you do that?&quot; Mr. Thorton asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;We need to go to Glendale and as soon as possible,&quot; Rick said. &quot;We need to be in separate bodies.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Separate bodies?&quot; Mr. Thorton asked looking thoroughly confused.<br />
<br />
Rick quickly explained the situation and the Marie said, &quot;So you'll be a glass wolf pup too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Only Hanna will be a glass wolf pup,&quot; Rick said. &quot;This body will remain human along with Maylene and Dennis.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You must do what you feel is right,&quot; Mrs. Thorton said. &quot;Why are you telling us though?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Because we believe that it would be a good idea for you to get off this yacht too,&quot; Rick said. &quot;The other passengers may be nice now but that may change.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We've been thinking the same thing,&quot; Mr. Thorton said. &quot;And Marie insists that we stay even if we get a chance to leave.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Now why's that?&quot; Maylene asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Because they need help,&quot; Marie said. &quot;I need to help them with what they've been through.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So much responsibility on a little girl's shoulders,&quot; Rick said.<br />
<br />
&quot;No more than what was put on Amy,&quot; Marie said.<br />
<br />
&quot;That's true,&quot; Rick said.<br />
<br />
&quot;So we won't see each other again?&quot; Dennis asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;We may,&quot; Marie said, &quot;sometime in the future.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then we should get ready for the cubs,&quot; Rick said. &quot;Take care.&quot; With that they left the Thortons and went back to their cabins to pack.<br />
<br />
++++++<br />
<br />
Madam Serenity woke with a feeling of loss. As soon as they ended the turns she wouldn't have anything left to do. She had spent most of her life fighting the curse. Trevor's idea of it being used out of love instead of spite was a nice dream but she had seen too much of humanity to really think that would come true. No the only way to make sure that it wasn't used in spite again was to end it.<br />
<br />
The door opened and Trevor asked, &quot;Madam Serenity are you up?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes I am Trevor,&quot; Madam Serenity said. &quot;Do you need something?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well breakfast is almost ready but I wanted to talk to you,&quot; Trevor said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well come in and talk,&quot; Madam Serenity said.<br />
<br />
Trevor came in and sat on the bed. After a moment he said, &quot;I've been thinking about the game since I got up.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It needs to end Trevor,&quot; Madam Serenity said. &quot;It's the only way to save people from the misery they could have because of a transform or dare. I know what you're going to say but think about this. The boy who transformed you did so to get your spot on the team. Now do you think he would have still done it if the witches weren't part of the curse?&quot;<br />
<br />
Trevor had to think it over a bit and finally said with a sigh, &quot;He still would have transformed me. But maybe it wouldn't have been in a way that made me so miserable.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Perhaps but he still would have done it out of spite,&quot; Madam Serenity said. &quot;You'll always have those that will use the power they have to make others as miserable as possible. It's just their nature. Do you want to see more people be as miserable as you were?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; Trevor had to answer truthfully.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then the game must end,&quot; Madam Serenity.<br />
<br />
&quot;That's something else,&quot; Trevor said. &quot;I don't think the game will ever end.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Once the turns are eliminated from people the game will end,&quot; Madam Serenity said.<br />
<br />
&quot;But what about those outside of Glendale who may have a turn?&quot; Trevor asked. &quot;You said yourself that we can't track all of them down. What if one or more of them come back to Glendale and use their turn? Wouldn't the game then continue?&quot;<br />
<br />
Madam Serenity had to think about that for a few moments. What Trevor said was true. It was impossible to find everyone who had a turn and there was the possibility of them coming back to Glendale in the future. She sighed and said, &quot;Then all our trouble would have been for nothing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not nothing,&quot; Trevor said kicking his feet. &quot;The witches are dead. There's no intelligence to the game anymore so it shouldn't be able to twist anyone's words. I've learned to make the most of life while I have it. I'm not going to make the same mistake with Mary as I did with Queen. You've gained skills that you can use even if a case has nothing to do with the game. The police have gained several lions who can smell things humans can't.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's true,&quot; Madam Serenity said. &quot;But what do we do? You're right that the game won't end anytime soon.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think we keep going like we have been,&quot; Trevor said. &quot;You keep up with the private investigations. Maybe find some people to help you. I'll help when I can but that won't be as much as before. My parents won't allow it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Just then a cub that seemed to be a bit older than Trevor was now and was colored like him came in and said in a clearly female voice, &quot;Breakfast is ready. Mom said to hurry up or you'll miss out.&quot; She left and Madam Serenity and Trevor followed.<br />
<br />
++++++<br />
<br />
Penny went into the police station with Kirk. She had to know something and that wolf pup was the only one that could give her the answer. She was glad to see that she was awake. Though she wasn't glad to see her not locked up.<br />
<br />
As she went up to the wolf pup she said, &quot;I have a question for you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What is it lioness-san?&quot; Amy asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;At the museum you didn't transform some statues,&quot; Penny said. &quot;Why is that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Because they were connected to you,&quot; Amy said. &quot;Even though it pained me not to set them free I left them.&quot;<br />
<br />
Penny nodded and asked, &quot;Why did you leave them if you were there to free?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The were connected to you by a red ribbon,&quot; Amy said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I see,&quot; Penny said nodding again. &quot;That must have been the packs true love power.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It is said that your true love is connected to you by a red ribbon,&quot; Amy said.<br />
<br />
&quot;How do you know that?&quot; Penny asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I was a Shinto priestess during World War Two,&quot; Amy said. &quot;Even though Ami is gone I still have some knowledge.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I have to thank you for not taking Kirk from me,&quot; Penny said and smiled up at him. &quot;Now I need to go see how something went.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If you're referring to the assault on the estate it didn't happen,&quot; Amy said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then every wolf is still brainwashed,&quot; Penny said quietly and in horror.<br />
<br />
&quot;No wolf is brainwashed,&quot; Amy said. &quot;That ended when I killed one of the three witches.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think I need to hear this story,&quot; Penny said.<br />
<br />
Amy happily obliged her and told her everything about it that she knew.<br />
<br />
++++++<br />
<br />
Rick, Maylene, and Dennis were packed and waiting for the cubs. They didn't wait long before three of them appeared in front of them. &quot;Are you ready to go?&quot; Saba asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;We are,&quot; Rick said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then take our hands,&quot; Saba said holding out a hand.<br />
<br />
Once they had taken their hands the cubs took one step. On the second step everything blurred. On the third step everything came back into focus and they were no longer on the yacht. &quot;Welcome,&quot; Jensen said. He looked at Rick and said, &quot;I've been told that you wish to be transformed.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We do,&quot; Rick said. &quot;That is the two of us that are in this body.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So you want something like what the cubs did?&quot; Jensen asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Rick said. &quot;Rick wants to keep this body while Hanna gains a body of her own.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Is Hanna sure that she wants to be a glass wolf pup?&quot; Jensen asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;She is,&quot; Rick said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Very well,&quot; Jensen said. &quot;Moja, would you please read what Alice wrote after he answers transform.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course,&quot; Moja said then turned to Rick. &quot;Transform or Dare?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Transform,&quot; Rick said without hesitation.<br />
<br />
&quot;For your transformation you will transform into two bodies,&quot; Moja said reading from the paper. &quot;The soul known as Rick will inhabit the body as it is now. The soul known as Hanna will inhabit the body of an eight year old glass wolf pup girl. She will have the ability to enter the mirrorverse through mirrors or any reflective surface. To the people outside of the mirrorverse she will look like a ghostly flesh and blood wolf pup girl when she appears in a mirror or other reflective surface. Inside the mirrorverse she is a flesh and blood wolf pup girl with all the needs of one. She can move between mirrors or any reflective surface in three steps while in the mirrorverse. If she is entering or leaving the mirrorverse via a mirror or reflective surface and that mirror or reflective surface brakes she will continue to enter or exit with no harm done to herself. She can take anyone into the mirrorverse with her and they won't be transformed. Outside of the mirrorverse she is a glass wolf pup girl made of one piece of glass and is able to move, talk, see, hear, and feel. She will have no physical needs outside of the mirrorverse and is indestructible.&quot;<br />
<br />
As soon as Moja finished Rick felt that he was the only one in the body. His jeans were starting to get a bit tight and looking down he saw his stomach swelling out. Then he felt something kick from the inside. &quot;Oh my god,&quot; Rick said with wide eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;What is it?&quot; Maylene asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm pregnant with Hanna,&quot; Rick said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come to our medical wing,&quot; Jensen said picking Rick up and running to the medical wing. Fran had just finished patching up the wolves that had returned when Jensen came in and said, &quot;We have an unusual pregnancy here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I'd say,&quot; Fran said as Jensen sat Rick down. &quot;I never heard of a male pregnancy before.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's due to the game,&quot; Jensen said sighing. &quot;Even after Kurse's death it seems like it's going to make people miserable.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh I'm not miserable,&quot; Rick said watching his expanding belly. &quot;I'm excited by this. I'll be the only guy to know what it's like to carry a life.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well lets see how the baby is doing,&quot; Fran said getting the sonogram equipment.<br />
<br />
Rick jumped a bit as Fran put the cold gel on him. Fran searched for the baby and it finally showed up on the screen. Hanna was growing at a pretty good rate. &quot;Well I think she's going to be ready to be born in a minute or two. And it looks like it's going to hurt.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why's that?&quot; Rick asked as Maylene and Dennis came in.<br />
<br />
&quot;She's going to be coming out your urinary tract,&quot; Fran said. &quot;And there's no time for a cesarean. I really feel sorry  for you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well it can't be helped I guess,&quot; Rick said smiling a bit. Then he felt a little pain in his belly.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's time,&quot; Fran said as muscles contracted on the screen. &quot;He's going to need a hand to hold.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll hold his hand,&quot; Maylene said and took Rick's right hand in her's.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok your water has just broke,&quot; Fran said as a liquid came out of Rick's dick. &quot;Soon you start to feel the need to push. I want you to resist it as long as you can.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok,&quot; Rick said through clenched teeth as a contraction hit. It wasn't long until he felt the need to push. He did resist pushing as long as he could but eventually he had to push. He felt Hanna's head start to enter his urinary tract. It was very painful but he grunted and bore the pain. Hanna's head entered his dick and it bulged out in an approximate shape of a wolf head.<br />
<br />
&quot;Her head's crowning,&quot; Fran said as Hanna's head started to emerge from Rick's dick.<br />
<br />
Rick let out a very loud cry of pain as Hanna's head came out. This was quickly followed by the rest of her. Fran quickly cleaned her up and cut the umbilical cord. She then handed her to Rick who smiled down at his daughter. She wasn't glass but he figured glass couldn't grow. And grow Hanna did. Over the next several minutes she grew until she was eight. It was then that she turned to glass. She looked at Rick and said, &quot;Hi Daddy.&quot; Looking at Maylene she said, &quot;Hi Mommy.&quot;<br />
<br />
It was at this point that unexpected changes occurred. Well they shouldn't have been unexpected as reality had to adjust. It started with Maylene growing. Golden fur erupted from her body. Her ears moved up to the top of her head and became wolf ears. Her face pushed out into a muzzle as her teeth became canines and her original canines became longer. Her muscles bulked up without losing the feminine form she had. She ripped her clothes off revealing her changing legs. feet lengthened and she shifted so she was standing on the balls of her feet. Her thighs did shorten some making her legs wolf legs. Her nails became claws and a tail grew from her spine. Her eyes became golden wolf eyes. In moments she was a wolf.<br />
<br />
Dennis was also undergoing a change. His was like Hanna's change and he just turned to glass. He looked at himself in amazement and then he took off his clothes with glee.<br />
<br />
Rick had new memories flood into his mind. He had met Maylene nine years ago. She was a lone wolf but Rick didn't care. He married her straight away and soon after they found Jensen's pack. He accepted them into the pack and that night they had gotten pregnant. It wasn't so odd that they were able to produce a child seeing as the wolves evidently had some human in them. What was so odd was that Maylene had gotten pregnant with Dennis while Rick had gotten pregnant with Hanna. It was found that Rick had three X chromosomes and one Y. The XY pairing was the dominate but the XX pairing evidently made it possible for him to get pregnant. Both of them had decided to give birth naturally. Rick was even able to breast feed their children same as Maylene. Now they were both five months pregnant again. As for Dennis and Hanna they had appeared normal until their fifth birthday when they both turned to living glass. Rick gave a little chuckle and said, &quot;I guess women aren't the only ones that can give birth anymore.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rick and Hanna looked at Maylene and Dennis and both said, &quot;We're sorry,&quot; at the same time. Rick continued, &quot;We know you had wanted to remain human.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It doesn't matter to me as long as I have you,&quot; Maylene said licking Rick's face. &quot;And Dennis is still human. Or at least a living glass human.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You're really ok with this?&quot; Rick asked holding his breath.<br />
<br />
&quot;We're together with two beautiful children and two more on the way,&quot; Maylene said. &quot;Besides it looks like Dennis is enjoying himself. We're happy and that's what matters.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rick let out the breath he was holding and smiled. He moved his hand down to his stomach and rubbed the bulge there. &quot;That is what matters,&quot; he said. &quot;And I can hardly wait to give birth again.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well we have the memories of me welcoming you to the pack but I'll say it again,&quot; Jensen said. &quot;Welcome to the Pack.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hanna, Dennis,&quot; Rick said. &quot;Go play with the other pups and cubs.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok,&quot; Hanna and Dennis said. Maylene picked Hanna up and set her down. Together Hanna and Dennis ran off while their parents smiled.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think things will be alright now,&quot; Rick said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe,&quot; Jensen said. &quot;There's still some things that I need to figure out.&quot; With that he walked away.</p>
