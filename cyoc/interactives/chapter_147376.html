<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Let’s go to my amusement park,”. Rice exclaimed excitedly. Lilith frowned slightly, after having one of her demons kill Vixi and considering she had sacrificed another version of Circes followers to the Kitsune, it didn’t sound like the greatest of ideas. “I don’t know,” she said quietly. “I don’t think they’ll like me.”<br />
<br />
Circe took a breath as she looked at the sullen girl. “Look,” she said. “I promise nothing bad will happen. Besides do you really want to stay here with all the stinky mean people?”<br />
<br />
Lilith shook her head, despite her misgivings staying here did not seem like a good idea. While the two grown down witches were feeling more childish by the moment, they still maintained some semblance of their adult independence. “Okay,” Lilith sighed. “But what about our clothes? They’re way too big.”<br />
<br />
Circe glanced down at the dresses the two girls currently wore. While they were able to keep them on their small bodies, they would either bunch up around their feet or trail behind them. “I think we have enough magic to make them fit,” Circe smirked. “You want to try?” Lilith nodded as the two girls now tried to summon their magic.<br />
<br />
Changing their outfits would usually be no issue for the two witches when they weren’t adults. Now though the girls had to concentrate to perform this simple form of magic. Focusing their energies the girls watched as their dresses began to grow smaller. Slowly but surely the dresses began to shrink down, the hems retracting to fit their bodies. Lilith and Circe watched as the bottom of their dresses rose up, no longer trailing past their feet. As the magic completed the two witches smiled at their child sized dresses. Happily the two girls now left of the bed as they examined themselves.<br />
<br />
“Much better,” Circe proclaimed as she looked at the childish long dress that now fit her. Lilith nodded as she looked herself over, a small frown now forming on her face. “We still need shoes though,” she grumbled.<br />
<br />
Circe gazed down at their feet, noticing the two witches were both barefoot. The girls small toes now poked out from their ankle length dresses. “Dang it,” she grumbled. “We need shoes.”<br />
<br />
Lilith smirked as she now began to concentrate. Circe watched as colorful sneakers and socks began to appear on the girls feet. As the spell completed the two witches smiled. They were ready to have some fun.<br />
<br />
Sneaking out without being noticed was harder than the two witches thought. As adults teleporting out of the house was usually no problem. Now being reduced to 6 year old children, Circe and Lilith would need to concentrate to leave without being noticed. Quietly they now focused on the spell that would take them to Circes amusement park. In a flash of light the two witches vanished from their home, appearing in the parking lot of Circes park. “Cmon Let’s go,” Circe exclaimed excitedly as she sprinted towards the front entrance.<br />
<br />
Lilith trailed behind timidly as Circe bounded into the park, thankfully her followers had no knowledge of Liliths actions against them in the other timeline. Still, they were aware of her actions against Vixi and may not take to kindly to her presence. Circe now hoped that them being children would curb any aggressive actions against them. As Circe entered her park she could see Franklin supervising some of the construction taking place. Circe now excitedly waved at the anthro fox who turned towards her his mouth hanging open as the child sized version of his goddess approached.<br />
<br />
“G...goddess,” he stammered.<br />
<br />
“Yeah it’s me,” Circe said, blushing slightly. “It’s kind of a long story. Me and Lilith wanted to come though to see how things were going.”<br />
<br />
Franklin turned from Circe to Lilith, frowning at the timid girl that now hid behind Circe. “Why would you allow her to enter your kingdom goddess,” he frowned. <br />
<br />
“It’s okay we kind of made up,” Circe said. “Now, maybe you can help find something for someone...of my size to do.”<br />
<br />
Franklin raised an eyebrow as he gazed at the two children in front of him. Circe seemed to be acting odd, but he would abide by his goddesses wishes. “Yes of course,” he said still unsure of what to make of this. “Follow me.”<br />
<br />
As Circe happily skipped forward she turned back towards Lilith. The girl appeared frightened by the numerous anthro people walking around, gawking at them. “Lilith come on,” she called. Lilith remained in place though as she timidly gazed at the anthros, noting the disapproving looks on their faces. Circe sighed as she now trudged to where Lilith stood. <br />
<br />
“They don’t like me,” Lilith whimpered. “And everybody&#39;s naked.”<br />
<br />
“Well you did kill one of them,” Circe pointed out. “And So what if their naked. I mean they have fur so it’s no big deal.”<br />
<br />
“I still don’t like it,” Lilith grumbled. Circe groaned as she gazed at the grown down demon. The childish tendencies inside of Circe made her want to run and have fun like any kid at an amusement park. Still, she couldn’t just leave Lilith by herself or make her feel uncomfortable. “Ugh What will it take to make you feel comfortable?”<br />
<br />
“Can I bring a friend,” Lilith asked. Circe shrugged, if Lilith having someone with her would allow Circe to go on the rides at her park she would agree. “Fine,” she groaned. “But they can’t hurt any of my friends.”<br />
<br />
Lilith smiled, nodding as she began to concentrate on summoning one of her followers. Circe screamed as 7 foot demon now appeared in a puff of smoke in front of her. “What is that,” she yelled fearfully.<br />
<br />
“He’s a foot soldier demon,” Lilith said, surprised by Circes shock. “He may be scary looking but he’s gentle as a puppy.”<br />
<br />
Circe raised an eyebrow, looking up at the beast. The demon had red leathery skin with dull eyes and a mouth full of razor sharp teeth. Bulging muscles covered the creatures body as it gazed dully around the park. Circes anthro followers were taken aback by the monsters appearance, quickly turning and walking quickly away. Lilith smiled up at the monster, taking his hand as she began to hum and skip like a child out at the park.<br />
<br />
“So,” Lilith asked, feeling slightly more confident with her demon chaperone. “What should we do first.”</p>
