<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kevin Sparks couldn’t believe how his two little twin brothers managed to talk him into going to the carnival, let alone visit the tent of this old woman who claimed to do magic tricks. Seventeen-year-old Kevin was utterly bored out of his mind, but his two little brothers were thoroughly enjoying the show. <br />
<br />
“Did you see that? How she changed the chicken in the cage?” Andrew uttered. <br />
<br />
“Yeah! That was like way cool! I wanna see more!” Mark responded. <br />
<br />
Mark and Andrew were both just thirteen years old. Both boys were seventh graders and just young enough to help on the dairy farm, located just a few miles from the beach where the carnival was taking place. <br />
<br />
“Okay, you guys. One more act and we’re going home!” Kevin warned. “I got a boatload of homework to do and you guys have soccer practice to go to and I gotta chauffeur you around again so I wanna get moving. Plus, I can think of other, more fun things to do on my Sunday afternoon than THIS!” Kevin grumbled. <br />
<br />
“Oh, come on! What are we gonna do at home? Watch TV?” Mark sighed. <br />
<br />
“We always have to leave early because of you!” Andrew complained. “Why can’t we enjoy something fun for a change?” <br />
<br />
“Okay! You guys wanna take the bus or walk home instead?” Kevin threatened. <br />
<br />
Just then Stephan motioned for any volunteers in the audience to come on the stage, especially if they still doubted the Madame’s great magical powers. <br />
<br />
“Ohhh my God… This is SUCH a freak show. You can just tell that this lady is a total fake. What a complete rip-off and a royal waste of my precious Sunday afternoon…” Kevin sighed. <br />
<br />
“Come on! Let’s get on the stage!” Mark stated cheerfully.<br />
<br />
“Yeah! Let’s see her do her magic up close! Maybe she can make us as big as Kevin! Then, we don’t NEED him to give us rides anymore!” Andrew shouted. <br />
<br />
“Wait. What? What are you guys--?” Kevin moaned just as his two younger brothers leaped from the chairs and started running down the steps towards the stage. “HEY! Where are you going? NO! STOP! Mark! Andrew! Come back! I said STOP!”<br />
<br />
Kevin got up and started running after the two brothers just as the boys made it to the stage. <br />
<br />
“Oh my! What have we here?” the Madame exclaimed when two preteen boys came running onto the small stage. <br />
<br />
“Hi!” <br />
<br />
“Hello! Can… Can you help us?” Andrew said, almost out of breath. <br />
<br />
Before the Madame could answer, Kevin came running towards them.<br />
<br />
“OKAY You guys. We are going home RIGHT NOW! Enough of this!!!” Kevin shouted as he reached the stage. <br />
<br />
“Oh my! Who… Who is THIS?” the Madame asked, feeling rather shocked. <br />
<br />
“This is Kevin!” Andrew replied as he rolled his eyes. <br />
<br />
“Yeah… Our mean, big brother!” Mark added. <br />
<br />
“Alright! Let’s all calm down!” the Madame shouted as she motioned with her hands for the three boys to calm down. <br />
<br />
“OKAY! We are all going home, RIGHT THIS MINUTE!” Kevin yelled at the boys. <br />
<br />
“Why do we ALWAYS have to do what you want, you BIG BULLY?” Mark shouted back. <br />
<br />
“We wanna see her show! Why are you being a dick, AGAIN?” Andrew added. <br />
<br />
“Because I’m OLDER than you, I’m BIGGER than you, I’m TALLER than you, I’m STRONGER than you AND because MY DICK is BIGGER than BOTH of your dicks combined! SO THERE!” Kevin shouted back angrily for all the people in the tent to hear. “WE’RE LEAVING!” <br />
<br />
“My, oh my, oh my! Boys! BOYS! Can we all just remain calm for one moment, PLEASE?” the Madame Illusia shouted at the three brothers. <br />
<br />
Finally, all three boys remained quiet as they glanced at the woman in the long, red robe. <br />
<br />
“Now, what are your names?” the Madame asked. “And, how old are you?” <br />
<br />
“We’re Mark and Andrew and we’re thirteen!” Andrew replied. <br />
<br />
“Oh, good. Nice to meet you two. I can tell that you’re twins!” Illusia remarked, noting the resemblance. “And this is your big brother?”<br />
<br />
“I’m Kevin! I’m taking them home, thank you very much, lady…”  Kevin said, feeling annoyed.<br />
<br />
“He is such a BIG BULLY!” Andrew shouted. <br />
<br />
“Ohh! Okay! I see where there is a problem in this family of male siblings!” the Madame replied as she looked over the three young men. “Two twin boys are at the cusp of entering puberty while the third, who happens to be the oldest, is dealing with an abundance of testosterone which is raging through his big, muscular, male body, leaving him with the strong urge to enforce his will and dominance over his younger, helpless, weaker brothers!” <br />
<br />
“Yeah! It’s SO unfair!” Mark uttered. <br />
<br />
“SHUT UP, twerp!” Kevin shouted. <br />
<br />
“BOYS! I think I have a good fix for this problem!” the Madame suggested. “Since the oldest brother is bigger in every way…. The two younger, twin siblings need to be bigger in just one area for the relationship to balance out. So, this is what I will do for the three of you in order to make things a little more even: I will increase the size of the male organs for the twins while decreasing it for the oldest brother. I will swap your penis sizes!” <br />
<br />
“Ohhh, COOL!” Andrew blurted out.<br />
<br />
“Say WHAT?” Kevin shouted. <br />
<br />
“Now, boys, please remove ALL your clothes and set them next to you on the stage!” the Madame instructed. <br />
<br />
Both Mark and Andrew started to take off their shoes, socks, their jeans and t-shirts right away, ;eaving them buck-naked on the stage. <br />
<br />
“What… What are you knuckle-heads doing? Wait… What? No… No WAY am I taking off my clothes in front of all these people! Forget IT!” Kevin yelled out loud. <br />
<br />
“Very well, then!” the Madame said as she snapped her fingers, making Kevin’s clothes disappear in an instant. His clothes appeared in a pile right next to him, neatly folded, on the stage floor. This left him standing there, completely naked as well. <br />
<br />
“HEY! WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?” Kevin screamed as he was naked in a blink of an eye. <br />
<br />
“Now, you will experience the magic of the Madame Illusia!” the Madame spoke as she waved her hands around while mumbling a few verses out loud. <br />
<br />
In an instant, Kevin felt his 11-inch-long cock and balls shrink before his very eyes while the twin boys saw theirs grow from 4 inches to 11 inches in length, all within just a few seconds. Kevin now had just a 4-inch cock, like his little brothers had a few moments before. <br />
<br />
“Ohhh man! Look what WE GOT, bro!” Mark giggled as he grabbed and held on to his bigger manhood.<br />
<br />
“Wow! We’re the big dudes now!” his brother cheered.<br />
<br />
“No! NO! NOOOOOO!!” Kevin screamed as he realized that he just lost 7 inches of penis-length.  “WHAT THE HELL????” <br />
<br />
“Okay, Stephan, please lead the three to the dressing room backstage so they can get dressed!” the Madame instructed. <br />
<br />
“Wait a minute… You can’t leave me like this! What did you do to my dick? YOU OLD HAG! I’m gonna KILL YOU! CHANGE ME BACK, NOWWWW!!” Kevin started screaming when two armed security guards approached him and grabbed him by the arms and dragged him to the entrance of the tent before they pushed him out. They stood there, just to make sure Kevin wouldn’t walk back in again. <br />
<br />
“Uhh, Kev? You better put your clothes on, bro!” Andrew said. <br />
<br />
“Yeah, you’re standing out in the middle of the carnival, totally naked, bro!” Mark giggled.<br />
<br />
“You guys are gonna be SO DEAD when we get home!” Kevin growled as he slipped into his jeans and t-shirt. “You guys are gonna paint the fence, mow the lawn, wash all the dishes and then round up and milk ALL the cows on the farm! Yessir! I’m gonna put you two TO WORK!!” <br />
<br />
The twin boys just laughed and giggled, constantly looking down at the big bulges in their jeans while Kevin didn’t have a bulge AT ALL anymore. <br />
<br />
“Bro! We’re the BIG brothers now!” Andrew whispered to his brothers as they sat in the back seat of the truck on the way home.<br />
<br />
“Yeah! This is so awesome! I wonder what would happen if we were to work out with these bigger dicks and balls? Mark replied. “I wanna try and orgasm with this monster!” <br />
<br />
“Ahh…. Life is gonna be great from now on, big bro!” Andrew laughed.<br />
<br />
“You better believe it, big bro!” Mark giggled quietly. “I can’t wait to show off my bulge at the beach!” <br />
<br />
The only person who wasn’t laughing right now was their 17-year-old brother, Kevin. He was going to hang out with his girlfriend, Stacey, while the twins were going to soccer practice. How was Kevin going to explain the fact that his cock had shrunk to a measly 4 inches in length?</p>
