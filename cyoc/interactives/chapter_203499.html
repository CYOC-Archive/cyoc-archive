<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;I&#39;ll help Kylie, but only on two conditions&quot; Greta said. <br />
<br />
&quot;The first condition is that I want Kylie to spend her days making up for all of the damage she caused. Help the people that she hurt, ease their pain, and to expect no forgiveness or gratitude or acknowledgement in return from any of them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Like community service?&quot; Aziza asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes. It&#39;s the least that she can do. The bare minimum, really.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;OK&quot; Aziza said. &quot;That sounds fair, and I think she&#39;d be willing to do that. Kylie is really a sweetheart once you get to know her.&quot;<br />
<br />
Greta&#39;s eyes looked dubious at that last part. <br />
<br />
&quot;The second condition is that after she&#39;s all better, I want her to turn herself in her original reality and accept responsibility for what she did.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But she&#39;ll be killed!&quot;<br />
<br />
Greta shrugged. <br />
<br />
&quot;If that&#39;s what has to happen. Her victims deserve justice.&quot; <br />
<br />
**<br />
<br />
Aziza ran around with Kylie, the two women innocently playing tag in the tall grass near their encampment. They were both barefoot because they both loved to feel the soft ground beneath their soles. Kylie&#39;s blonde hair had turned curly because the climate they were in was much more humid than it was back home, and Aziza found it pretty. She momentarily got distracted by her breathtaking (Even in post Great Change world) beauty. <br />
<br />
&quot;Caught you!&quot; Kylie giggled, tackling Aziza to the ground. Aziza joined in her tittering.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes. You did!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;And you know what happens when It catches you, right?&quot; Kylie grinned. <br />
<br />
Aziza shook her head, grinning back. <br />
<br />
The blue eyed bombshell started tickling Aziza on her tummy. <br />
<br />
Aziza laughed uncontrollably, her body temporarily a prisoner to Kylie&#39;s fingers. <br />
<br />
She enjoyed the distraction of playtime. She knew that Kylie did too. <br />
<br />
It sure beat being sad all day. <br />
<br />
&quot;And you know what else happens to people who get caught?&quot;<br />
<br />
Kylie kissed Aziza deeply.<br />
<br />
But all good things must come to an end. <br />
<br />
Later that night...<br />
<br />
&quot;Kylie, we need to talk&quot; she said seriously, around the campfire. <br />
<br />
**<br />
<br />
Aziza took a deep breath. <br />
<br />
&quot;Here we go.&quot;<br />
<br />
Casually, she walked inside Glendale High, avoiding the bizarre chimeras and monsters inhabiting the building, silently blessing them with spells to help ease the trauma that the evil witch had put them through. <br />
<br />
She watched as one of them, a horned beast that looked like a demon from someone&#39;s nightmares, suddenly ceased its furious compulsive masturbation of its gigantic penis in the hallway, and looked up at her with sad puppy dog eyes. <br />
<br />
Aziza cast a spell, and the demon now found itself in the arms of its parents two towns away, transformed back into the teenage goth girl Arkady Rose she had been years earlier. Her mother, now over a decade older, erupted into tears of joy and smothered Arkady in hugs. Her prayers for her daughter to be returned to her from that monster had been answered.<br />
<br />
Aziza entered the gym of the former high school, the large door slamming shut ominously behind her, and at the center of the gym, she saw Kylie Perkins standing alone. <br />
<br />
Only it wasn&#39;t *her* Kylie. <br />
<br />
This woman was an Alternate.  Essentially identical to her Kylie, with an almost identical history barring small differences, only she was from a different timeline.<br />
<br />
Just like how there are an infinity of fractional numbers that exist between 1 and 2, there are infinite potential timelines that can be accessed without having to cross dimensions. <br />
<br />
Alternate Kylie Perkins whipped around, sensing the presence of a rival sorceress. <br />
<br />
Like her own Kylie had been when Aziza first met her, *this* Kylie was emaciated and dirty and clearly didn&#39;t take good care of herself or her hygiene. Aziza wondered if she even realized how bad she looked. <br />
<br />
She too had the same telltale appearence of insanity in her eyes that her own Kylie once had. It was sad to witness. Depressing. <br />
<br />
Seeing someone become so cracked always felt like such a huge waste to Aziza. Nine months of a mother&#39;s love thrown down the drain forever. <br />
<br />
Jennifer Smith getting one last trick over on Kyle, the clever cheerleader twisting his words and turning him into a witch, had destroyed whatever precious little sanity the former boy had once possessed.<br />
<br />
It reminded Aziza of an old friend from pre-Great Change days, Jamal, who in 2016 had gone all fundie and had flown to Syria to join ISIS. <br />
<br />
A part of Aziza was still sad at the thought, as how Jamal, and many of her terrorist comrades, had committed suicide shortly after becoming women in the days following The Great Change, believing that Allah had cursed them to live as the inferior gender. They couldn&#39;t live with being people that they thought of as just broodmares, as property.<br />
<br />
But regardless of how good of a person he had once been, Jamal had made his bed, and Aziza had learned to live with that. So too had Kylie the Sorceress. <br />
<br />
With a smile on her face, Alternate Kylie blasted Aziza with a spell that would have easily overwhelmed a lesser sorcerer, transforming them into something vile, but the Sorceress *Supreme* with only moderate effort blocked it with her own spell. <br />
<br />
After a few more failed attempts, Alternate Kylie cackled. <br />
<br />
&quot;This is fun!&quot; she yelled from across the gym. &quot;I haven&#39;t had a good fight since they tried dropping napalm on me last month. I turned it into a mountain of Hershey&#39;s Kisses. And I haven&#39;t had someone to talk to in forever. And I&#39;m so horny.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Kylie Perkins, please give up&quot; Aziza said, ignoring the non sequiturs. &quot;I don&#39;t want to hurt you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t want to hurt you either! You&#39;re gorgeous! What are you, Mexican?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Arab.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, let&#39;s have a 1,001 nights in my pussy, then, Princess Jasmine! Why fight when two hot awesome ladies like us can fuck? And hey, I guess you&#39;re a witch too. I know that we just met, but do you want to be girlfriends? We can rule the world together!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You destroyed most of the world.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Well maybe I wouldn&#39;t have if those assholes at the United Nations had just made me Queen of the Earth like I asked them very nicely for!!&quot;<br />
<br />
Alternate Kylie paused after her sudden tantrum, her echo reveberating across the vast gym, lost in her own thoughts. Aziza said nothing. <br />
<br />
&quot;And maybe I wouldn&#39;t have done all this if that cunt Jennifer hadn&#39;t fucking pantsed me in front of everybody! Ever think of that, Princess Jasmine? None of this would have happened if I hadn&#39;t been humiliated by that awful bitch!&quot;<br />
<br />
Alternate Kylie started to ugly cry into her dirty cheerleader top uncontrollably for a minute. <br />
<br />
Aziza didn&#39;t say anything. <br />
<br />
She guessed that Kylie had been wanting to tell *someone* about her feelings for over a decade, but just never had a chance to. Being a supervillain kind of makes people unsympathetic to what emotional problems you&#39;re going through. <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m so lonely! Everyone hates me!&quot; she cried, snot in her nose. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well yeah...look at everything you&#39;ve done.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why can&#39;t they just accept me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Because you hurt people. Innocent people.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They&#39;re weren&#39;t innocent! They were all terrible to me. This entire goddamn town treated me like shit!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Is that why you transformed a six year old into a bowl of chicken noodle soup and swallowed him because you had a cold that day?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Jennifer fucking Smith took my body away from me! My identity!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry&quot; Aziza said. &quot;Having your gender changed against your will was wrong, and I know that it must have been traumatizing. The bullying you went through must have been traumatic as well. You deserved better, Kyle. That&#39;s still no excuse for all of the evil things you&#39;ve done though.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, thanks for at least acknowledging that I have feelings!&quot; Alternate Kylie sniffled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Anytime.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alternate Kylie stopped crying. Her green eyes became cold and hard. <br />
<br />
&quot;You know what? Forget it. I know you&#39;re just playing good cop to get me to leave with you. Who are you anyway?! I&#39;m not leaving home with some stranger. You think that I&#39;m a fucking idiot? The offer to be partners is off the table. You&#39;re just like the rest of them. I don&#39;t even think you&#39;re pretty anymore. You&#39;re a fugly looking bitch. You probably blow hobos behind the 7/11 your uncle manages.&quot;<br />
<br />
Aziza shrugged. <br />
<br />
&quot;6/10. I&#39;ve heard worse insults before.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;When I&#39;m done with you, I&#39;m going to make you a hermaphrodite. I&#39;m give you a giant cock and make you my sex slave! Yeah! How&#39;s them apples? I&#39;m getting kind of bored with this guy&quot; Alternate Kylie said, picking up a large pink dildo off the floor and forcefully throwing it against the wall. <br />
<br />
The dildo moaned in pain despite having no nervous system, no body at all. It had once been one of Kyle&#39;s classmates. <br />
<br />
&quot;How&#39;s that sound?!&quot; <br />
<br />
She pointed a slender hand at Aziza and began to work her magic. <br />
<br />
Behind her, Regular Kylie pointed the Wand Of Wonder at her doppelganger, the wooden rod trembling in her hands. <br />
<br />
**<br />
<br />
The night before before they had left their camp on Empty Earth, Aziza had told Kylie about Greta&#39;s terms for being her therapist. <br />
<br />
Kylie and Aziza had held each other tightly, both deeply upset at the thought of what it all meant. <br />
<br />
Kylie had done monsterous things. There was just no escaping that. <br />
<br />
But Aziza couldn&#39;t let her be put to death. <br />
<br />
Aziza knew that it was selfish decision. She didn&#39;t care. She loved Kylie. She was the best thing that ever happened to her.<br />
<br />
Aziza felt deep down that Kylie *was* capable of being good, she just needed someone who supported her, watching her back and keeping her from falling over the edge. Someone who cared about her. <br />
<br />
Maybe there was another way, a third option, to make things right and for her victims to get justice? <br />
<br />
**<br />
<br />
Aziza had told Kylie that she wasn&#39;t strong enough to do any heavy duty sorcery on her own yet, and she needed a tool to help her focus. <br />
<br />
The Wand Of Wonder was one such tool. <br />
<br />
It was ancient, used by sorcerers since the Bronze Age to help amplify their powers. According to trivia, the occultist John Dee had once owned it. And now it belonged to Aziza. <br />
<br />
In a normal person&#39;s hand, it would have been an ordinary wand, no different than the kind you&#39;d find in any children&#39;s magic set. <br />
<br />
The moment it touched Kylie&#39;s hand though, she felt a surge of something interface with her body, like she had been struck by lightning. Holding it a second longer, she then felt something *other* course through her body. Something elemental. Something like pure creation. <br />
<br />
Aziza had gently instructed Kylie before arriving that when Alternate Kylie was about to strike, wish as strongly as she could to transform her counterpart into a normal human. Someone without magic powers.<br />
<br />
So she did. <br />
<br />
Alternate Kylie found that she could no longer do magic. It was as if that part of her being had just been turned off like a light switch. <br />
<br />
She was no longer Kylie the Sorceress, just Kylie Perkins. <br />
<br />
Alternate Kylie screamed in impotent rage as Aziza handcuffed her, and with a simple teleportation spell sent her to the nearest police station with a note attached to her shirt that she had surrendered and was powerless. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well that&#39;s one variant Kylie down, many more to go&quot; Aziza said, kissing her Kylie. &quot;You did a wonderful job, honey.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah&quot; Kylie said, dazed. &quot;This is so trippy.&quot;<br />
<br />
One thing Aziza had paid attention to and was happy to see was that this reality&#39;s version of the Glendale Curse didn&#39;t seen to be affecting Kylie at all.<br />
<br />
She had been really worried about the potential of that happening, and was fully prepared to retreat back home to Empty Earth if Kylie showed any signs of being possessed, but Aziza sensed that this Glendale demon had just decided to go back to sleep. <br />
<br />
Thank Goddess for that. <br />
<br />
Aziza and Regular Kylie used the wand to transform all of Alternate Kylie&#39;s victims back into who they had once been. Some of their former bodies were unfortunately unrecoverable, and so they had been turned into handsome young men and beautiful young ladies.</p>
