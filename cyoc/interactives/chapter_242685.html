<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Its hot today!&quot; Theo said. &quot;Why don&#39;t we hang out by the pool?&quot;.<br />
&quot;Thats just what I was going to suggest!&quot; Emily grinned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Great! Go get changed and, i&#39;ll get my stuff.&quot; Theo said, disapearing upstairs.<br />
<br />
Emily went into the bathroom, taking her swimsuit out of her bag and exitedly stripping down.<br />
She slid into the swimsuit, the tight lycra pressing agains her soft skin.<br />
<br />
Emily timidly stepped out the back door onto the poolside, where Theo was waiting for her. Theo was in a pair of blue swimming trunks, and Emily admired his athletic body and toned muscles.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow... you look... realy good!&quot; Theo said nervously.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m glad you like it!&quot; Emily smiled. &quot;You are welcome to come look at it closer.&quot; she flirted, walking to the edge of the pool and sitting down, her feet in the water.<br />
<br />
Theo slowly stepped towards her, sitting down next to her. He reached out his hand and toucked the back of the swimsuit with his hand. He was suprised how smooth it felt. Emily shuddered, and Theo quickly pulled his hand back. &quot;Sorry&quot; he said quickly. &quot;No, no...&quot; Emily said, &quot;I... I liked it&quot;.<br />
<br />
Emily pulled her legs out of the pool, and turned to face Theo, streching her legs out infront of her. &quot;You can keep going, if you want&quot; she said, lying back on the smooth tiles.<br />
<br />
Theo nelt down next to her and once again, reched out to touch the swimsuit, this time with both hands.<br />
Theo&#39;s hands glided over the smooth, tight fabric of the swimsuit. Slowly, he traced the contours of Emily&#39;s body. He leaned in close, his breath warm against her skin, and gently cupped her firm breasts, marveling at how tightly the swimsuit wrapped itself around Emily&#39;s curved form. Slowly, he moved his hands accross her breasts, his fingers teasing her nipples through the thin, form-fitting material.<br />
<br />
Theo&#39;s hands continued their languid exploration of Emily&#39;s form, each stroke over the sleek swimsuit sending shivers through her. The lycra clung to her like a second skin, and he could feel every curve, every contour, as if the fabric were an extension of her own body. His fingers danced along her waist, tracing the narrow dip before rising again to meet the full swell of her hips. Emily&#39;s breath caught as his touch grew more insistent, his palms pressing against the smooth material, the heat of his skin mingling with hers.<br />
<br />
Theo&#39;s fingers lingered on the sleek fabric, marveling at how the smooth lycra seemed to glow under the light. His gaze followed the white racing stripes that ran along the sides of the swimsuit, tracing the perfect curves of Emily&#39;s body. He couldn&#39;t resist the urge to run his hands over the stripes, feeling the subtle texture against his fingertips. &quot;The way these stripes hug your curves,&quot; he whispered, his voice low and filled with admiration, &quot;it&#39;s like the suit was made just for you.&quot; His touch was gentle, yet deliberate, as he followed the lines of the stripes from her hips up to her shoulders, emphasizing the flawless shape beneath.<br />
<br />
His hands drifted upward again, gently cupping the firm curves of her breasts through the sleek lycra. The fabric was so tight, so smooth, that he could feel every contour, every subtle shift as she breathed. His thumbs traced circles around her nipples, the friction of the material heightening the sensitivity of his touch. Emily&#39;s eyes fluttered closed, her lips parting slightly as she let out a soft sigh. Theo leaned in closer, his mouth brushing against her ear. &quot;You look incredible,&quot; he whispered, his voice low and husky.<br />
<br />
Emily wrapped her arms around Theo, the warmth of his skin contrasting with the cool tiles beneath her. She pulled him closer, her firm breasts pressing against his chest as their lips met in a deep, passionate kiss. The lycra of her swimsuit clung tightly to her body, the smooth fabric enhancing the sensation of their embrace. Theo&#39;s hands continued to explore her form, his fingers tracing the curves of her waist and hips through the sleek material. The world around them melted away, leaving only the sound of their synchronized breaths as they moved together. In that moment, nothing else mattered but the connection they shared, their bodies speaking a language that words could never express.<br />
<br />
In the midst of their love, Emily noticed that it had started to rain, there was an oncoming storm.<br />
The drops of water fell on the two of them, soaking into the lycra of Emily&#39;s swimsuit. She knew there was only so mutch time left before she started to transform.<br />
<br />
Theo broke out of the kiss, looking up at the sky, but quickly looked back down as he felt Emily slowly reach her hands up to his waist, clutching the strings of his swim shorts. She looked at his deep blue eyes, looking for a nod of approval. Both of them were still virgins, but Theo nodded. Emily&#39;s soft hands gripped the shorts and pulled them down. Theo stepped out of them and discarded them, his eret member standing upright and to attention.<br />
<br />
Emily gently pulled him back down, and Theo straddled her, wrapping his legs around her slim waist. Theo&#39;s hips began to move against her, the heat of his erection pressing through the thin layer of the swimsuit as he ground slowly and deliberately. The wet lycra clung to her skin, creating a friction that heightened the sensation as he moved. His lips never left hers, the kiss deepening as his hands gripped her hips, pulling her closer. The smooth fabric of the swimsuit seemed to melt between them, the warmth of their bodies mingling as they moved in perfect rhythm. Emily&#39;s hands tangled in his hair, her breath steamy and sharp, catching in her mouth as the pressure built.<br />
<br />
Theo&#39;s legs wrapped tighter around her wet waist as emily pulled him closer, her firm lycra breasts pressed against his bare chest. He marveled at how her slim, wet body seemed to morph to fit his body ontop of her perfectly, eliminating any space between them, as they pressed together as tightly as possible. He had never felt such a deep connection with anyone before, and the impossibly tight, smooth lycra swimsuit only heightened the experience. It glistened under the light, clinging to her curves like a shimmering second skin. The warmth of his thighs pressed against her hips, and the smooth fabric seemed to pulse with the rhythm of their breaths. His hands slid down her back, tracing the outline of the swimsuit as it molded to her body, every contour accentuated by the tight material. The world around them faded into the sound of their synchronized heartbeats, the only tangible reality the undeniable connection between them.</p>
