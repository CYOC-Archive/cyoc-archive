<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“I wish that your family was rich and that this is your house not the Brockman’s. Also I wish that despite the fact your family is rich, you work part time as a model.” Monique look to me at shock for my wish. As much as I enjoyed the look she was giving me, I remembered that Brad was still one of my friends and despite how much of a bitch Mrs. Brockman was; our families still now each other. Even my dad was friends with Mr. Brockman.<br />
<br />
“I wish that the Brockman family was still rich and your families are friends. They also lived in another mansion near here.” I said with a sigh. Monique look like she was about to be disappointed. “However I wish Julie Ann Brockman is not a stuck up rich woman but your head maid.” This improved Monique’s mood so I decided to make one more final wish. <br />
<br />
“Finally I wish as reality adjusts, you can shape your life and relationships with those who matter to you how you like it.” I said with a smile and just like that Monique smiled too. She then close in and gave a surprise passionate kiss. I close my eyes as I kissed back just as the wishes were granted and reality changed.<br />
<br />
I open my eyes as the kiss ended and my eyes bulged as I look at Monique. She was still the same person but her clothes have change and it made me blush. Gone was the barely there and down right pornography French Maid uniform and in its place was a two piece white bathing suit however the bottom piece was more of a thong. On the back was little angel wings and on her head was a head band with a little halo above it. Yeah this wasn’t helping the erection I was having.<br />
<br />
I search my new memories of her and was happy at the change. Her full name is Monique Beaumont and her beauty match that last name. She was 24 years old and graduated college two years ago with a major in business and a minor in performing arts. Despite her family being rich and having multiple homes around the world, she worked part time as a model which she has the body for; heck her breast were D cups. <br />
<br />
I blushed even harder as I went through the memories about our relationship and now somewhat questioning my last wish. No more was she an acquaintance through my best friend. She is my girlfriend and our relationship started out like it was a romance novel. She was introduced to my family a year ago when my uncle became one of her agents in America which boomed his status in the industry.<br />
<br />
She was taken in and a smitten by my shy and kind nature. She downright came to see me often and when she start showing advances towards me, I happily return them. When my parents found out our growing relationship, dad was okay with it however mom was more apprehensive about an older woman perusing her son. It wasn’t until one day they had a talk and now mom was 100% on board with the relationship.<br />
<br />
On my 18th birthday, she attended my birthday party and later she lead me to my room where she proceeded to take my virginity. It was then she reveal what agreement she reached with my mother, that we would take our relationship slowed and wait until I graduated college and have a job before we marry. In my mind it was for the best and our relationship is known between our families, we had not announce it to the public yet.<br />
<br />
Thus leading to the costume party we’re at now. She was hosting it in anticipation for a classes graduation and all of the classmates invited believe it was because of Brad which was mostly true. After all he pick the dress code it was obvious he pick out Monique and his moms costumes. Makes me wonder why my girlfriend agreed to this.<br />
<br />
“Joey?” Monique asked in her accented voice which knock me out of my thoughts. Looking at her as she smiled she asked “Do you enjoy our new life M’sieur Joey?” I only nodded my head in approval. She smiled at that.<br />
<br />
“Good. Now please excuse me I have to deal with this.” As she let me go and head into the room. She approached Mrs. Brockman who was now wearing the pornography French Maid costume.<br />
<br />
“Julie Ann Brockman!” Monique called out getting both Mrs. Brockman and everyone’s attention. I snickered at all the men in the room as they shifted uncomfortably at the two sexy dress women in the room.<br />
<br />
“M…M….Ms. Beaumont!” Exclaimed Mrs. Brockman who was obviously scared. Oh how the shoe was now on the other foot.<br />
<br />
“What is this?” Monique asked in a heavy French accent as she gestured towards hers and Mrs. Brockman’s costumes. “I allow your boy to have free rein over our costumes and he picks these?” Mrs. Brockman look down in shame before Monique continued. “Where is that boy?”<br />
<br />
“It seems he had a wardrobe malfunction, Ms. Beaumont and is now running around naked.” Answered a shamed Mrs. Brockman. How scary was Monique to Mrs. Brockman? Monique gave a sign and put a hand on Mrs. Brockman’s shoulder.<br />
<br />
“Look Julie.” Monique calmly said as Mrs. Brockman looked at her. “I honor your husbands request to offer you a job after you got into trouble so much that it could hurt your family. You even work yourself to be my head maid. I even allow M’sieur Brad to hang out here.”<br />
<br />
“However.” Monique’s tone now more stern. “His unwanted advances towards me and perverted nature has really disturbed me as well as reflected poorly on you. This party is the last straw, he obviously has no respect for women especially his mom. Now he makes a mockery of himself.”<br />
<br />
“Now he is big trouble. Find him, clothed him, and send him home. And if you want to keep your job and position here; he is no longer allowed here. He is banned; understand?” Monique finished harshly. Boy that minor in performing arts degree is really serving Monique well.<br />
<br />
“Yes Madame Beaumont.” Responded Mrs. Brockman submissively. Monique soften when she heard that.<br />
<br />
“Good.” Said Monique. “Now go change into your proper uniform and have the staff that is not attending to the party find Brad.” </p>
<hr/><h3>
With that Mrs. Brockman began to leave the room. What happens next?</h3>
