<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jake&#39;s father Paul a 41-year-old construction worker. Jake had heard how despite being on a constant movement his bad habits from drinking and occasional smoking had landed him a bit of a gut. Paul was build like a bear as his muscles were underneath that self-made chunky body. Jake had seen his father skinnier in the old photos but over the years as the wallet got bigger so did his father&#39;s bad habits and belly fat. He rarely has seen his father at the same dinner table as him. As Paul usually opted to take out food near the place he worked. He would rather eat at work and do overtime to get more money. Jake&#39;s mother had always commented how in the past Jake&#39;s father Paul had no inhibitions when it came to drinking and smoking. Telling Jake how Paul would spend most of his time with boys at the strip club or be at the dive bars until they were closed. Money wasn&#39;t an issue for him as Jake&#39;s mother would lament how the money had corrupted his father&#39;s lifestyle. In the past Paul used to be a different man according to Jake&#39;s mother. Which raised the question.<br />
<br />
If his father&#39;s fat wallet and work were his only defining features? What would happen if both of them were taken away from him? What would be left of Paul if he had no money to spent and no workplace to go at? Jake looked at the collar in his hand and a little upward curve formed near his cheek.<br />
<br />
Jake&#39;s mother admitted at the dinner table that she had grown tired of her husband&#39;s antics and Jake knew that his mother was already looking for a different husband in her life. She hadn&#39;t told this to anyone but by the context clues Jake knew that it was the case. Things like swiping the smartphone in front of Jake or asking at the mall if he had a different father what type of he prefered. It was a bit somber to think that his 38-year-old mother would seek out for another husband, but hey, this was their father he was talking about. A workaholic money hungry bum who cared about his career more than his family.<br />
<br />
A perfect target for the slave collar.<br />
<br />
That evening when Paul got back home. Jake put his plan in to a motion. Thinking that maybe when he was watching a football game he could sneak the collar on to him and assert his dominance over his dad. There was enough space between him and Jake as Paul was watching the game on the sofa that had a small blind spot if you walked in from a right spot. Jake looked at his father once more and then stared at the collar. The moment had to be precise and well-timed as one slip up would cause the belt come off from his father&#39;s trousers. Jake got behind his father and-<br />
<br />
*SNAP* *SWUUIIRRRRLLL* *CLICK*<br />
<br />
The collar was locked and loaded on his father&#39;s neck. Jake saw how the big man turned around and tried to remove it. Shouting angrily at his own son what kind of a fucking prank he was pulling here. Not sparing on the curse words at all as he struggeled to remove the slave collar from his neck. The belt was coming off and Paul was jumping over the living room bench to give a earned beating to his son.<br />
<br />
&quot;Stop right there! Dad! Put the belt back where it came from.&quot; Jake commanded his father.<br />
<br />
Paul felt shocked how he couldn&#39;t resist the command and reinserted the belt back on to it&#39;s proper place. Cursing at his own son what type of dark magic was he had gotten himself into.<br />
<br />
&quot;Stand there for a while for me. Don&#39;t move an inch.&quot; Jake commanded again and the man stood there like a tree trunk.<br />
<br />
Jake searched his father&#39;s pockets and found the infamous thick wallet on his back pocket.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you dad. I&#39;ll be spending my afternoon with this.&quot; Jake maniacally cackled at his own father as he emptied the wallet and threw it with no money to the floor. &quot;Here. You can have this old thing back.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jake fanned the fat stack of benjamins on his father&#39;s face. His father was seething as he gave a death stare back at his own son who had just emptied his wallet from it&#39;s contents.<br />
<br />
&quot;What kind of robbery is this? Stealing from your own father!? Shame on you... you... you fucking accidental piece of cum and sperm!&quot; Paul shouted without thinking.<br />
<br />
Jake felt no sympathy for his own dad and that last comment made his think even more. No wonder mom never wanted to see him. He was just pretending to be happy for his family. This was his father&#39;s true nature and Jake saw it as a good opportunity to punish him for his sins. He had the power over his dad.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dad. Go to your bed and sleep until 7am. Also, you can&#39;t touch me, harm me or intentionally come five feet near me until you hear the sentence, &#39;chocolate apple pie&#39; coming out of my mouth twice in same sentence.&quot; Jake commanded his father once more who forcefully begun to walk towards the master bedroom while cursing the whole way there. The muffled cursing soon stopped as his father passed out on top of his own bed with clothes still attached on his body.<br />
<br />
Jake sat on the living room sofa, on the same spot where his father was sitting, and tried to think what he should do with his own dad. He had his pocket money and knew that his bank account should have even more cash. It was still afternoon and there was nobody in the house beside him and his father.</p>
