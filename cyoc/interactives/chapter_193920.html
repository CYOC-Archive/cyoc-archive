<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Wish? How many do I get?&quot; Jake could practically hear the greed in the thief&#39;s voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;As many as you want. I might need to rest between wishes, but, there&#39;s also a cost.&quot; Jake finished lamely, he could be better at this, but he hoped he didn&#39;t have to get better at this. The thief was busy examining the mirror though. Over six feet tall with a heavy wooden frame it was a big piece.<br />
<br />
The part about the cost didn&#39;t even seem to register to the thief. All he could hear was wishes. &quot;I&#39;m not going to be able to get this thing out of here without waking up the whole house.&quot; The thief muttered to himself. &quot;How&#39;d you get in there anyway?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I was trapped.&quot; He shrugged, as if the answer was obvious.<br />
<br />
The thief rubbed his chin as he stared at Jake from the other side of the mirror. He could make out some features in the dark. The man was younger, maybe only in his early twenties, and strands of blond stuck out from beneath his black beanie along with blond sideburns. Lean, but fit. &quot;Can you be let out?&quot; <br />
<br />
Bingo. Jake just nodded his reply.<br />
<br />
&quot;Perfect. I wish you could leave the mirror, but you have to stick with me. No running off.&quot; Jake grinned and snapped his fingers.<br />
<br />
He felt that same strange tugging as before, and a moment later was stumbling to catch his balance. He looked down at himself, then around the attic. A grin spread across his face as he turned to meet the gaze of the shocked thief on the other side of the glass. &quot;Thanks for that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What? What did you do?&quot; The thief pressed against the glass of the mirror, trying to get out.<br />
<br />
&quot;I warned you there was a cost to the wishes. Someone has to be in the mirror so wishing me out sucked you in. You&#39;re the wish granter now, until you can get someone to get you out.&quot; Jake spread his hands in a &#39;what are you going to do?&#39; gesture.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wished you had to stick by me! You can&#39;t leave!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, except, now I&#39;m you so I can&#39;t leave myself. Pretty hard thing to do otherwise.&quot; Jake picked up the sheet and tossed it over the mirror, shoving the thief back into that grey bleakness he had just experienced. He needed to get out of here, and quick before he woke up his no longer family. He creeped down the ladder, then down stairs, only to hear someone rummaging in the kitchen. What was the guy&#39;s name? &quot;Mike.&quot; He hissed, &quot;We need to go.&quot;<br />
<br />
The other thief, a stout man with curly brown hair stared at him. Memories were beginning to seep into Jake&#39;s mind from the thief&#39;s, but it was slow going. He knew this man was a cousin though, and they both lived down in the trailer park.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why?&quot; Mike whispered back, then looked down at the bag in his hands.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just.. trust me. I think I woke someone up. The might be calling the cops.&quot; It was the best lie Jake could think of but Mike cussed. He made for the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Leave the bag, if they catch us with it, we&#39;re fucked.&quot; Mike glared back at Jake but dropped it and the two scurried out the door and of to a waiting car. Jake climbed in the passenger seat as Mike almost dove into the driver&#39;s side and sped off.<br />
<br />
&quot;Idiot. I told you not to go upstairs.&quot; Mike chastised him, and Jake felt color rising in his cheeks. Memories told him this Mike was like an older brother to him. His distaste for the robbers was getting mixed with the blond haired thief&#39;s own emotions. He pulled the beanie off his head, letting wavy blond hair fall to his shoulders. &quot;I&#39;m sorry, Dylan, but I told you when you got in on this you needed to be careful. One bad job and we&#39;re all screwed.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dylan. That was his name. They rode in silence the rest of the way, pulling up to a trailer park. Mike headed towards one, but Jake-now-Dylan knew his home was a different one. Just his, left to him when his parents died. But he was having trouble making ends meet, hence getting into business with Mike. &quot;I think.. I might need to quit this.&quot; Dylan said to the retreating Mike.<br />
<br />
The stocky man shrugged. &quot;I told you it&#39;s not for everyone. I know I guy down at the local auto shop, maybe I can get you a job there.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dylan ran a hand through his longish hair then nodded. He turned and headed back to his trailer, stepping inside to what was both a completely unfamiliar sight and a well known one. He headed to the tiny bathroom, stripping out of his clothes on the way. The place was a bit of a mess as it was and a few clothes he could deal with in the morning. He leaned on the sink and peered into his face in the medicine cabinet mirror. He wasn&#39;t a bad looking guy, he had worried seeing Mike and knowing they were cousins. That man looked a bit like a bull dog. Dylan had a sharp nose and angular jaw, with bright green eyes and fullish lips. Handsome, but he also looked haggard and sleep deprived. His body was lean and fit, with a light dusting of reddish-blond body hair.<br />
<br />
This was the first time he really could explore an adult body. He had lost his grown up Jake one before he had a chance to experience it. He ran a hand over his chest and down his abs, the body hairs almost tickling as his fingers ran through them. Turning on the shower, he stepped in. At least this place had some hot water and decent pressure. He continued exploring his new body, his hand coming to rest on his cock. That felt different. Even in hands bigger than he was used to it felt big, and had a weird bit of skin going over the head he didn&#39;t have before.<br />
<br />
Instead of yanking on it like he figured out a few months ago, he began to thrust into his fist, tolling his hips in smooth, even thrusts that came from Dylan&#39;s experience. But those memories of his female conquests didn&#39;t so much for him, instead his mind drifted to one of Jake&#39;s memories, kneeling on the floor as his reflection stood over him in his newly adult body. The firm muscles, the cocky look, Dylan gasped as his cock throbbed in his hand, shooting spurts of white cum that filled the air with a musky scent. That was new for Jake, but comfortingly familiar to Dylan&#39;s memories.<br />
<br />
He soaped up and rinsed himself off, then stepped out of the shower, giving himself a quick pat down with a towel. He headed toward the bedroom and sat on the bed. Dylan&#39;s.. his phone sat on the nightstand, screen cracked but otherwise still working. He had left it behind so it didn&#39;t go off and give him away, not to mention the GPS on the stupid thing. He picked it up and entered the unlock code without even thinking, then froze.<br />
<br />
He stared at the date. &quot;Three years?&quot; He muttered. Well, two days short of three years. He had been in the mirror for almost three years. It had felt like minutes. Wait, this might work. It was almost the holidays and his family always spent that with his grandparents. They&#39;d be here soon if they weren&#39;t already. Then he sighed and flopped back on the bed. And he was in the body of some trailer park thief, they&#39;d probably have him arrested if he went up to them claiming to be Jake.<br />
<br />
After all this, he just wanted his old life back..</p>
