<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">A whirlwind would be a mild explanation of Kellie&#39;s life over the previous two weeks. Yhe visit to see her daighter Katie jad proven to be successful as the girls were all able to begin to form friendships. After Kellie returned home though things took a turn for the worse. <br />
<br />
Immediately after returning to her timeline Kellie learmed from Merlin that Katie may be under attack from Morgan LeFay. Despite Kellie only having been home for a few hours, she couldnt let Katie possibly experience her fate. Quickly she returned to her daughter&#39;s timeline to assist. While exhausted she, her friends, and her daughter were able to defeat Morgan LeFay with the unintended consequence of making Kellie a grandma.<br />
<br />
As defeating Morgan Kellie returned home, exhausted but happy. Merlin examined his daughter and determined she should rest for at least a week. As Kellie now lounged around her home she found herself smiling as she thought of everything that had transpired.<br />
<br />
&quot;You seem happy,&quot; Merlin stated as he brought Kellie some lunch. Kellie grinned as she now began eating. &quot;Can you blame me,&quot; she smirked. &quot;I mean I helped Katie and reunited with my sisters. Sure I&#39;m exhausted but it was worth it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well focus on recovering your strength,&quot; Merlin stated. &quot;After all your someones gramdmother now. An elderly woman such as yourself shouldnt exert themselves like that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh ha ha,&quot; the teen frowned as she saw the smirk spread across Merlins face. &quot;FYI if I&#39;m Morgans grandma that makes you her great grandpa. Keep up the jokes and I&#39;ll put you in the retirement home.&quot;<br />
<br />
Morgan chuckled softly as he now eased himself into his chair. Despite the odd scenario of being his arch nemesis great grandfather, he was pleasantly surprised with how things were working out.<br />
<br />
As Merlin and Kellie now talked they failed to notice a portal begin to open outside their home. Two 40 year old women now stepped forward, feeling slightly disoriented from their journey.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ugh my head,&quot; Ann groaned. &quot;Darling did it work? Are we actually here?&quot; Jackie nodded as she blinked. &quot;Pretty sure it did,&quot; she said. &quot;I had Gloria help me with the spell. From what she said your sisters timeline looks very similar to ours. The only question is why did you want to come here?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I just really wanted to see my sister,&quot; Ann shrugged. &quot;Lisa told me her and Kumiko visited once, before they knew who Kellie actually was.  I just want to see how shes doing.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jackie nodded as she niw faced Kellies home. She had the foresight to ask Gloria where her aunt lived. What surprised her though was the weather. Gloria had said that time moved slightly different here. This meant that while it was early February in her timeline, here it was spring. &quot;Wow its hot,&quot; Jackie exclaimed. &quot;Wish I brought a change of clothes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ll go shopping later,&quot; Ann said. &quot;Right now lets go visit my sister.&quot; Ann and Jackie now approached the home, tentatively knocking on the door.<br />
<br />
Kellie was somewhat surprised to hear fhe gentle knock. The girls were still at school and she wasn&#39;t expecting any visitors. Cautiously opening the door, Kellie gaped at the two adult women standing on her front porch. &quot;Ann?! Jackie?!?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow it is true,&quot; Ann gasped. &quot;You really are just a teenager.&quot; Kellie nodded before hugging her sister. &quot;Yeah I am,&quot; she smiled. &quot;Now what are you two doing here? Wasn&#39;t expecting to see you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ann was curious about your timeline,&quot; Jackie stated. &quot;She really wanted to see what it was like.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just didnt realize I would see my big little sister,&quot; Ann smirked. &quot;Really Ann,&quot; Kellie frowned. &quot;Your going to hold being an adult over my head?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well it is a bit of a surprise, &quot; Ann smiled. &quot;Wasnt expecting to see the teeny bopper version of my big sister. Guess you would be my kid sister now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just come in already,&quot; Kellie groaned. &quot;Im happy to see you but your lame jokes are killing me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ann and Jackie happily obliged as they enter the foyer. &quot;So what are you two foing here anyway,&quot; Kellie asked. &quot;Its not like Im not happy to see you I&#39;m just surprised.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well,&quot; Jackie said. &quot;Ann and I had a weekend together and wanted to come pay a visit.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah sis I missed you,&quot; Ann said. &quot;Was wondering if you would like to get together. Just didnt realize you would need to ask permission or worry about a curfew.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kellie groaned as she glanced over at her sister. Ann wasnt going to stop with the jokes while she was here.  A coy smile now spread across her face as her ring began to glow.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey,&quot; Ann gasped as she felt herself begin to grow younger. Kellie could only shrig and smile as Ann and Jackie raced backwards in age. Kellie watched as the two adult women grew steadily younger, leaving their 30s behind as they raced through thwir 20s. Ann and Jackies faces became fresher while their bodies firmed up.<br />
<br />
As the two women became teens once more Kellie smirked as they curves began to diminish. Quickly the two girls became 15 once more. For Jackie she was oncr again her original age, her body showing the signs of a maturing young lady. Ann wasnt as fortunate as sge grumpily looked at her sister. She was now a waifish young teen of 15 once more. A small chest, narrow hips and barely developing curves had once returned to the young blond. As Ann glanced over herself she frowned at the looseness of her once form fitting business suit.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whose the kid sister now Ann,&quot; Kellie smirked.<br />
<br />
&quot;No fair,&quot; Ann whined. &quot;I was just having a bit of fun. How old did yoy make us anyway?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Looks like 15,&quot; Kellie grinned. &quot;Guess that makes you the kid sister now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jackie giggled as Ann sighed. &quot;Was probably going to happen anyway Ann,&quot; she said. &quot;Besides, I think we can have more fun this way.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So what are you two thinking,&quot; Kellie asked. Ann smiled, adjusting her ill fitting clothes as she looked at her sister. &quot;Well we got the whole weekend sis we can do whatever we want.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kellie rubbed her chin thoughtfully as she looked at her little sister. A smile slowly spread across her face as she now thought of the fun she could have with her younger sister and her girlfriend.</p>
