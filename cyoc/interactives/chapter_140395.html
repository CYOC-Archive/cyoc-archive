<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ben winced at this pain as it spread across his body, nearly paralyzing him where he was. Breathing intensifies as he felt the air around him heat up. It was then as if by command his growth pains ended, unable to process what happened he began to feel himself all over. Everything felt heavy. So much of his mind was so focus on his growth, he speech became slurred. All he can muster out his flaps of a mouth were &quot;ME... HUNGER... GROW...MORE&quot;. Almost by command his bulbous Yoga ball of Arms tried to reach over his expanding chest.  Still lost in the ecstasy, Ben&#39;s rational mind suddenly awoken inside the body overwhelmed by the addiction he now felt. He began to panic trying to reach his motor functions. regaining his sense of sight in the process he realized that the ceiling was quickly approaching. soon his right arm returned to his command. Feeling the 5-foot engorged biceps flexing was exhilarating but he couldn&#39;t feel the puny mouse in his hand. In fact, this was what he was tested earlier in the week in case he lost himself again. That was until his giant palms brushed against the computer monitor. Realigning his palm once again found the tiny mouse. clicking with his pinky he felt the tingling shoot across his body before abruptly stopping. He didn&#39;t know what he clicked but he still felt him quickly reaching the ceiling. <br />
He quickly shuffled around the so his chest and his sensitive pecs squished against his floor. he finally saw the screen again. the setting still blinking on the screen:<br />
[Growing Hairer] <br />
Stunned. Ben watched as a jungle of hair sprouted from his Chest and what he assumed was everywhere else. Eventually becoming a thick mat which he could see. He maneuvered to stop this strange twist of events. Eventually refinding his height options before he felt himself brushing up against the ceiling again. &quot;GREAT&quot; he murmured to himself. Trying to constantly readjust to his new body had drained him. Fat Fingering a bit until he was able to shut off his height options. he continued to scroll down to the muscle options. Grunting as his lats and traps continued to wrap around his body fighting for more space. His Arms began to lock up just before he clicked the button. struggling with his swollen muscles he forced his palms into pressing the button ending his growth. <br />
AS the air quickly returned to Normal he felt his giant frame shake as if screaming to grow more. But with the tingling sensation gone, Ben was able to once again regain full control of all his senses. Ben struggled for an hour moving his giant frame as parts continued to act on its own accord. His ballooned muscles were so swollen he could not fully reach his back nor his front. Feeling a sense of strange calm, He continued to flex which surprisingly caused his chest to heave out another foot as if finally released from a cage. This sudden growth shock across his body as it suddenly jolted in all directions. Plaster from the ceiling dusted the jungle of his hair that surrounded him. His groans were quickly silenced by an incredible hunger. almost instinctively his body began moving to the Kitchen, rather clumsily the giant tried to stand only falling over as the weight of his body dragged him down.  He was so hungry he couldn&#39;t stand his immobility. HE NEEDED TO EAT. with his 200 inch arms, he dragged himself to the Kitchen Island. surprisingly to Ben, he was unable to actually see the Kitchen, but he knew he was near it as his hands jumped over the island to the fridge. Shoving his hands into the fridge as well as the pantry he began feasting on the food that was already premade.<br />
He vaguely remembered he did spend the morning cooking food for himself to eat. he gorged himself for a bit until he no longer hungered. Ben belched sent ripples across his body and room. Fully conscience again Ben continued to feel himself around this stupid pad. &quot;PUNY HOUSE&quot; he murmured. he made sure to rip out all the doors in this pad. so he could move around easier when he was 11 foot. He couldn&#39;t imagine what he was thinking. He clearly didn&#39;t make the new arches big enough for him to fit. He remembers the 20&#39; x 20&#39; Sauna he had renovated from a puny master bathroom that once stood where he was. How he spent the week cooling down in the Suana since he was too big for both a shower and a bathtub. now, this puny room felt like a prison. but being the only room in the house with a full wall mirror he to shove himself into that room. cramped by the low ceiling and tight room. He was able to almost successfully fit inside the infuriating room with minimal damage. His trap digging into the ceiling, Ben was forced into a weird flex that caused his body to spasm out even more than it already was. Being fully naked was a nice plus so he can see the work the website did on him. <br />
Squinting at the Mirror he can see his giant muscles fighting for room on his body and in the room. Surprisingly despite how hairy he seemed on the top with all he had on his face and chest was a trimmed beard and a mat of hair on his chest. everywhere else was only lightly haired. feeling not at all like a filthy animal spent an hour squeezing back into the main foray where his second pair of clothes he got when he originally grew was waiting for him. <br />
Surprisingly despite overestimating how much he would grow he still was able to somehow fit into his clothes. Albeit the world &quot;fitting&quot; was a very loose term for Ben. His arms instantly burst the sleeves of his shirt. The shirt nearly ripped in half except for a few threads which hung tightly around his Pecs. He wasn&#39;t even gonna try to stretch his shirt down anymore. no use his 26 pack abs will have to be exposed for the time being. slipping his Underwear on was surprisingly not as difficult but despite that his giant members still stuck out the birches of his underwear. He grabbed his oversized shorts hoping that these would at least fit better than his shirt. everything up to his knees slid through his shorts no problem. but as he slid further up the harder it was for him to carefully move the fabric up his thighs. As if never ending his thighs continued to fill the hole of the pants until it stopped a good foot before his ass. frustrated he accidentally flexed his arm trying to push the pants up to cover at least some of his ass as consultation. Realizing his mistake he tried to unflex. But it was too late. he body lurched forwards again. his very tight shirt slipped further up exposing his heaving chest. and his tight underwear heaved as his members continued to struggle against the straps that barely holding it back. eventually, the pants slipped on only covering the very top of the thighs and his waist. he was basically wearing a super short-short. Sighing he wondered what he was gonna do at the front door the only door he couldn&#39;t remove for obvious security reasons. Barely dressed as he was he looked back at his monitor with the site still blinking with the final measures : <br />
27 feet <br />
7 ton<br />
Feeling the giant nature of those numbers, Ben once again returned his gaze to the door below him. Back when he was 11 feet the door was only 15 foot tall so he was able to fully fit underneath it. but now being nearly double the size of the door itself he his arms alone almost busted the door but despite some weird jank, he was able to still head outside thanks to the garage door. which happened to be nearby the door. realized he was able to finally stretch out and relieved himself of the nightmare pad. <br />
Again surprising no one, the big and tall store employee was on the same shift just as Ben walked in almost fainting the poor man. Studiously carrying out his duty to his giant compatriot fashioned new clothes that fit the titan. This time the Giant demanded a couple of identical set of clothing scaled larger. The employee thought to himself that it was weird but seeing the giant before him acquitted. Ben walked home now fully clothed setting shop in the backyard.</p>
