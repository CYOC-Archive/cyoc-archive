<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ophelia looked down at a sleeping Heather, with a warm feeling spreading throughout her entire body. Currently, they both were in Ophelia&#39;s bathroom, although Heather was still asleep, and the two of them were still knotted together. Ophelia had just managed to carry them in their when she had a thought. <br />
<br />
[Why should I risk waking Heather up, and disturbing her sleep with a bath? She has to be very tired after what she&#39;s been through. She&#39;s not even an anthro-dragon, only a normal girl, just with a dragon&#39;s cock and balls. So, I guess when I had thought of making her have the same endurance as me, and that it would have prevented this, I wasn&#39;t mistaken. But apparently, the pleasure of her organism was so great her mind simply couldn&#39;t handle it.]<br />
<br />
&quot;Looks like I need to remember to fix that for you later&quot; Ophelia said to herself with a chuckle, noticing that she couldn&#39;t stop herself from grinning. She was just simply too happy. Her best friend had become her mate. Not only that, but she may even be pregnant with their first clutch. Ophelia realized that eventhough she now was a member of a different species, she knew almost nothing about them. How long would it take for her to lay her eggs? A day? A week? A month? Regardless, it didnt matter to her in the end. She already knew that she would happily carry them in her even for years if she had to.<br />
<br />
&quot;I will tell you what&quot; Ophelia said, speaking to Heather, but mostly to herself since Heather was still unconscious. &quot;How about I give you a special cleaning service, free of charge? Just say nothing if you accept!&quot; <br />
<br />
Obviously not getting a response from Heather, Ophelia gently set her down in the tub, standing on all fours abover her. Ophelia had actually had a quite large tub. Easily big enough to fit 4 people, or 1 anthro-dragon and her mate with enough extra room for &quot;activities&quot;. She never understood why the previous resident upgraded the tub to this extent, but now she was thankful they did. <br />
<br />
Ready to begin cleaning, Ophelia opened her mouth, allowing her tongue to slide out. With expert skill, Ophelia began her &quot;special cleaning service&quot; by licking Heather clean, from head to toe, only using her tongue. Heather wasn&#39;t dirty, but she had cum literally everywhere on her body. Even her long hair was comoletely caked with Ophelia&#39;s cum from her first orgasm, when she squirted on her face. <br />
<br />
[You know, my own cum doesn&#39;t taste that bad. Its no ahere near as delicious as Heather&#39;s, but I know that I easily can get used to this flavor.] Thought Ophelia as she finished consuming all of the cum in Heather&#39;s hair. Shd had learned that her saliva is excellent at breaking down cum. She guessed it was like a natural cleaning agent for helping dragons keep themselves clean. Either way it was super convenient. <br />
<br />
There was just something about cleaning her mate that made her feel calm and relaxed, like it was almost meditative. She felt that she easily could lick Heather for hours, even if she was already clean. Her taste was pleasant, and was quickly rising up as her new favorite. Even her sweat taster good. This was her mate&#39;s taste, and Ophelia knew she would remember it forever.<br />
<br />
About a half hour had past since Ophelia began licking Heather clean. She had decided to do all of her hand and feet first and work her way in, and she just now finished cleaning her last limb. Sitting up while straddling Heather because they still were knotted together, Ophelia began examining her work so far. <br />
<br />
&quot;Not too bad Ophelia, all that is left is her torso, balls, and eventually her dick, once we unknot of course. Speaking of which, I wonder when that will happen?&quot; Ophelia said, speaking to no one in particular. &quot;Well, back to work&quot; <br />
<br />
She spent another half hour licking Heathers torso clean. Right about when she was ready to start the balls, did they finnaly unknot. Carefully slidding the cock out of her pussy, so as not to leak cum all over her work, Ophelia prepared to resume cleaning, starting with Heather&#39;s massive testicles. She didn&#39;t pay much attention to fhem before, but now that she was looking, they really were huge, and very handsome. She knew that her own balls never were anywhere close fo being attractive to her before. If anything they were repulsive. But Heathers were different. They were perfectly smooth orbs, filled with tasty cum for her to enjoy. Giving them a poke with one of her nails, she realized how firm they were, which caused her to involuntarily shudder in excitement. <br />
<br />
Bending down, now with her face in Heather&#39;s crotcb, she softly began kissing her balls, while her tongue was busy cleaning them inbetween her kisses. This must have felt good, because Heather had immediatly gotten an erection, which made Ophelia very happy knowing she was responsible for causing it. As she continued to kiss her, Heather started moaning in her sleep. It wasn&#39;t long before precum began flowing down Heather&#39;s cock, pooling in her sheath. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh no you don&#39;t&quot; scolded Ophelia, inserting the entire head into her mouth. She snaked her tongue all around the shaft and sheath, cleaning up the last drops of the cum from Heather&#39;s body. After a few more minutes, Heather reached her orgasm, sending over a gallon of seman down Ophelia&#39;s throat. Ophelia made sure to not let a single drop get missed, sliding her tongue down Heather&#39;s widened urethra a few inches, lapping up the small amount left near the tip.<br />
<br />
Now that she was finished cleaning off Heather, it was time to clean off herself. This process was much quicker. It seemed that cum didn&#39;t stick to her like it did to Heather, and most had already slid off, flowing down the drain. Even her hair was spotless, though no longer styled.<br />
<br />
Running a hand through it to check, she marveled at its silkyness. It was truely beautiful hair. Soft and shiny. And she loved the color too. As she was combing her fingers through her hair, Heather finally spoke up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you planning to start licking me again, or is cleaning your hair the last step?&quot; Joked Heather.<br />
<br />
Ophelia turned bright red at the comment. She hadn&#39;t realized, but Heather had woken up a while ago. Back around when she was licking her arms, but had decided to pretended to be asleep still, not wishing to interrupt Ophelia&#39;s fun time. She had to admit it felt really weird being licked all over, sorta like a mix between how a dog&#39;s and a cat&#39;s tongue feels, except not quite as rough, and also way wetter. She did briefly pass out again when she came again, but not nearly for as long this time, her mind slowly getting use to it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Listen babe, I appreciate the kinky service, but I still would like a proper shower after this&quot; said Heather, raising a hand up to Ophelia&#39;s left uppermost tit and giving her nipple a playful, but gental flick.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmmmmmm!!!&quot; moaned Ophelia, trying hard to keep it inside. [Why does every inch of my body become so sensitive, and feel so good when Heather teases me like this? Is it because I am her Sub and she&#39;s my Dom?] She wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;God, when you try to stifle a moan, you become just way too adorable.&quot; Heather said as she pulled in Ophelia for a hug. &quot;Thanks for cleaning us up. You did a great job.&quot;<br />
<br />
That sentence alone made Ophelia&#39;s face even redder and break out in a huge smile, extremely happy to recieve Heather&#39;s praise. She was so happy infact that she tackled Heather in a big embrace, rubbing her head up against her stomach, her tail flicking back and forth rapidly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, careful with the tackling, you are a lot stronger than you think, although, I guess you also are a lot lighter than you look.&quot; warned Heather, petting the happy anthro-dragon girl hugging her waist. <br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean? Are you saying I look fat?&quot; Teased Ophelia. She had never understood why women got so defensive about their weight or age. And now a woman herself, she still didn&#39;t really understand, but she saw a chance to make the comment and took it. Trying out her best &quot;insulted&quot; voice.<br />
<br />
Not expecting that response, but immediately seeing through the bluff, Heather responds while poking Ophelia&#39;s nose. &quot;Don&#39;t suddenly try acting all insulted. We both know that you don&#39;t get why women like to keep these things to ourselves.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ehhh, stop poking my nose&quot; cried Ophelia, though rather playfully.  &quot;I&#39;m sorry. But I do want to know what you mean by me being lighter than I look.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If I had to guess, I would say you weight maybe 20 pounds at best right now. You actually are very lightweight. Likely so you can easily fly&quot; answer Heather.<br />
<br />
&quot;Woah, really? That&#39;s like super light. I bet your dog weight more than me now.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Idk about that. Max is just a small dog, though we could head over and find out sometime. I could then show you off to my parents, or my sisters. You remember my 3 older sisters, the triplets right?&quot; Asked Heather.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course I do. April, May, and June.&quot; Said Ophelia.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, you are not wrong, but can you tell me their first names, and not just their middle ones?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Sasha, Libby, and Alexis, though she let you and I call her Lexi because we threw a tantrum that one time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She still won&#39;t let anyone but us call her Lexi you know.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I feel honored, we should visit them soon.&quot; Said Ophelia, comfortably laying on Heather with her eyes closed as Heather stroked her hair.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll let them know. But first lets wash up and get to our date. I still plan to get your choker tonight as well, so we should get going pretty soon.&quot; Noted Heather.<br />
<br />
Crawling up Heather&#39;s torso, Ophelia moved moved her mouth go Heather&#39;s lips entering into a deep kiss. &quot;I can&#39;t wait.&quot;</p>
