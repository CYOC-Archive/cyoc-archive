<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dan finished unpacking, and decided to take a shower, and try out his new equipment.  He grinned as he stripped down, and grabbed a towel and went into the private bathroom that adjoined his new dorm room. <br />
<br />
He lathered up and watched his new bigger cock swell to its full length and girth. He was on edge and about to blow his load when it happened. His cock shrank in his hands and then it grew, but it was flaccid and he couldn&#39;t get it hard again.  &quot;What the fuck?&quot; he said as he turned off the water and rushed out of the shower. Something must be wrong with the Chronivac, some sort of glitch.  He grabbed the towel and looked at his flaccid 10 inch cock.  It was just embarrassingly big.  Then he rushed dripping out of the bathroom.<br />
<br />
There seated at his desk was Antonio, and he was typing something into the Chronivac.<br />
<br />
&quot;Antonio?!&quot; Dan asked as his cock instantly hardened to a full 11 and one half inches with a nine inch diameter lifting his towel obscenely.<br />
<br />
&quot;He Danny Boy, guess who your new roommate is?&quot;<br />
<br />
Dan paused.  He seemed to be having a hard time thinking, and he had forgotten why he left the shower.  Now that he was hard he needed to get back in the shower and jack off. He remembered Antonio&#39;s question, and answered, &quot;Who?  You?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s right bright boy,&quot;  Antonio said.<br />
<br />
Dan quivered as a wave of pleasure passed through him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good, I&#39;ll just finish up in here,&quot; Dan said going back into the bathroom.  Before he even reached the shower, his new and improved cock was wilting. He tightened the towel and decided to ask Antonio about this.  Maybe it had something to do with what Antonio was typing into the Chronivac? he wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Happy to see me?&quot; Antonio quipped as soon as Dan stepped out of the bathroom again and immediately popped his massive boner.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, I, uh, guess,&quot; Dan said trying to cover himself.<br />
<br />
&quot;Danny boy, relax, and get your ass over here,&quot; Antonio ordered, &quot;I want to check out my improvements.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Improvements?&quot; Dan asked slowly moving closer, fearful that he might blow his load.  The closer he got to Antonio, the closer he got to cumming.  He was so focused on his predicament that he didn&#39;t notice Antonio reach for the towel.  Only after it was gone, and he felt the cold air on his skin did Danny notice Antonio was holding the towel and checking out Dan&#39;s backside. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I only typed that you were tattooed identifying you as my slave and didn&#39;t know how it turned out.  I should have been more specific.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Your slave?&quot; Dan says looking over his shoulder and seeing an &quot;S&quot; and &quot;L&quot; tattooed on his lower back. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, slave boy, Danny Boy,&quot; Antonio answered, &quot;You cannot see it, but there&#39;s a barcode too. I think I&#39;d have preferred, Antonio&#39;s Slaveboy, but simply SLAVE all in caps works and then the one your right shoulder says &quot;PROPERTY OF ANTONIO SALIERI&quot; surrounded by a nice heavy chain, and it picked up on your new sexuality and changed that shamrock on your right butt cheek into a shamrock in a pink triangle.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My new sexuality?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure, why do you think you can only get hard when you&#39;re in a room with another guy?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck that&#39;s why I couldn&#39;t jack off in the shower?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Bad, slave boy!  Go wash your mouth out with soap.&quot;<br />
<br />
Instantly, Dan felt bad.  He slumped his shoulders and turned back and walked to the bathroom, &quot;Yes, master,&quot; he heard himself say as he walked over to the sink and started to lather up his mouth. He gurgled and sputtered a bit, but finally satisfied that he had properly washed out his mouth he rinsed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why the hell did I do that?&quot; Dan asked as he stared in the mirror.  He turned around and examined hte tattoos on his body.  Now he was getting angry. He stomped back into his dorm room naked.  Instantly, his cock slapped himself in the abs, as he became rock hard again.  He stopped and stared down. Then he said, &quot;Master Antonio!&quot; He caught himself, why had he called Antonio master?<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, you&#39;re one hot slave boy, and when I saw you this morning I knew I had to have you.  And when I saw that Chronivac case with your luggage, I knew just how I would.  Didn&#39;t you think it odd that the key I gave you came off of my own keyring?  Heh, heh.  Oh, and don&#39;t even think of trying to reverse your changes, I programmed the Chronivac, so you can only type into it what you are told to type. Otherwise, you can only read it. Now sit on my lap and read!&quot; he ordered.<br />
<br />
Dan noticed that while he was in the bathroom, Antonio had stripped down to his red bikini briefs.  He didn&#39;t want to, but he was compelled to obey.  He sat down on Antonio&#39;s lap and another wave of pleasure coursed through his body. He read his new stats:<br />
