<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Author&#39;s Note: Whoever adds the next chapter make sure its a thousand words long and detailed like this one. And if it ends with Thomas using his diaper have the options for getting Sarah&#39;s attention to change him be; go to Sarah and ask her for one, be a real baby and cry for it, and do nothing and just wait until she notices.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Thomas could barely keep himself from bouncing up and down in joy with every step he took as Sarah led him by the hand down the hallway, excited by the success of his operation and his new youthened body. Not only that but he seemed to have the hyperactive energy that all toddlers and little kids seemed to have but was managing to keep himself in check. However he did smile widely at the feeling of the Pamper hidden underneath his shorts and the way the thick padding forced his legs apart again.<br />
<br />
Man, it really felt good to be wearing a diaper again he thought to himself. And he was sure he would enjoy his new underwear even more the next time he happened to go potty.<br />
<br />
When they reached the main lobby area the receptionist lady paused to look up at them from her computer, the woman instantly recognizing them from half an hour earlier and smiling at the youthenized Thomas.<br />
<br />
“Well what do you know, I had no idea know you were going to get THAT young but I have to say you make quite an adorable toddler Mr. Walker” she commented when they got close enough.<br />
<br />
“Yeah but I bet you probably wouldn’t say that if you were the one who had to change his stinky diapers, this adorable little guy here went and dropped a big one after the operation if you know what I mean” Sarah replied before he could, causing another awkward blush.<br />
<br />
Apparently she wanted to get in a little more teasing about his lack of potty training before they returned home. But Thomas didn’t mind as he wanted her to poke fun at and point out his diapers to strangers so as to make him feel more like the baby he now was, he was just getting used to it at the moment.<br />
<br />
Unfazed by this new information the receptionist said with a chuckle, “Aww…does somebody not know how to use the toilet anymore like a big boy?”<br />
<br />
“Nope, Imma baby so I wear diapies now” he childishly replied with a head shake and giggle before sticking his thumb in his mouth and sucking on it.<br />
<br />
“Yes, yes we all know you’re very proud of your Pampers Thomas” Sarah said before reaching down and picking up the young boy who was her boss, adjusting his position and holding him in her arms. As he was being carried away Thomas waved good bye to the woman who waved back, “Give me a call when you grow back up and you’re out of diapers” she called out.<br />
<br />
Sarah merely rolled her eyes at the last part and shook her head at the other woman’s words thinking it would be a long while before Thomas stopped pooping his pants…if ever.<br />
<br />
Carrying the one and a half year old outside to the parking lot to where the car was parked she momentarily set him down on the ground while she retrieved the car seat from the trunk and set it up in the back seat. Once it was in place Sarah picked Thomas back up and strapped her precious baby boy into the seat, doing up the straps and buckles. He especially liked the way one of the straps went up between his legs and pushed his diaper up against his crotch.<br />
<br />
“Gotta make sure my little one is safe and sound” she said patting his head before closing the door and getting into the driver seat, immediately starting up the car.<br />
<br />
As they drove through the city Thomas looked out the window and marveled at the endless rows of buildings they passed by. Everything looked so much bigger and huge now that he was seeing through the eyes of a toddler which was both a little scary and exciting at the same time. Despite the dramatic shift of his worldview he still didn’t regret his choice to undergo the regression. If anything he felt grateful as this new outlook of his brought a sense of wonder back to the formerly boring and dull world he knew previously as an adult.<br />
<br />
Intrigued as he was Thomas unknowingly found himself nodding off every few seconds due to a combination of his soft comfy seat, the rhythmic comfort motion of sucking his thumb and the music Sarah was playing on the radio. His best efforts to stay awake were foiled as his eyelids shut after another minute, the young toddler dozing off without a word. It only seemed like a couple of seconds had passed before he was lightly jostled awake from his impromptu nap and another several seconds to realize that he was being removed from his car seat. <br />
<br />
“Good morning there sleepyhead. Have a nice nap?” Sarah said with a smile as she lifted the toddler into her arms and gently help rouse him with a few gentle pats on the back.<br />
<br />
Thomas merely mumbled in reply as he resumed sucking his thumb while he waited for his drowsiness to wear off. Eventually it did and wide awake he saw that he was being carried up to the front door of his large two story suburban house and realized he had slept through the entire car ride home. Regardless he was glad to be back as it meant he could now start living the baby lifestyle under the watchful eye and loving care of Sarah. Once they were inside and she put her purse in the kitchen she took him to the living room where he was promptly set down on the floor.<br />
<br />
“Now before you do anything else how’s your diaper holding up? Do you need a change?” she asked.<br />
<br />
The question threw Thomas off as he hadn’t been paying that close attention to his padded garment. Before he could check or reply his momentary confusion gave Sarah enough time to stick her hand down the back of his shorts and check for herself. Feeling the back of the pamper for any solids and finding none she stuck a finger in one of his leg gatherers only to detect no wetness either.<br />
<br />
“Hmm surprisingly you’re still clean and dry but I don’t expect that to last long” Sarah admitted.<br />
<br />
Thomas giggled as she was right on the money with that assumption and that he was hoping to have another accident in his pants again real soon.<br />
<br />
In fact he was counting on it.<br />
<br />
“Alright Thomas now that you’re a baby again what do you want to do first?” Sarah asked her baby boss.<br />
<br />
Pulling his thumb out of his mouth so he could think he eventually decided he wanted to…</p>
