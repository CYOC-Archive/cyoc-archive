<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><br />
Devon was a new man...literally.<br />
<br />
At first he&#39;d been shy about being in a new adult body bulging with muscles, tattoos and oozing testosterone. But then he found out how his body worked, and he had been eager to try it out with other men. He brought home twinks, men in suits, construction workers, college boys, military men...he fucked them all with his new fat Italian cock. <br />
<br />
He told his old stepdad to stay quiet in his room and not to come out. Now that he&#39;d discovered sex, he was just crazy with lust. Madame Illusia had turned his body gay, except for the situation at work where he was nailing the boss&#39; daughter. He had fucked her after about a week in to his new body swap. She came over on the weekend and asked him to fuck her before she went back home with her tiny dicked husband, who ate out of Giancarlo&#39;s palm. A little wuss who needed a big man to look up to. <br />
<br />
The New Giancarlo, formerly Devon, was loving being an adult. He liked driving his new car to work, he liked driving his new son to school, he liked swearing and fucking, working out and smoking. It had been a rollercoaster ride for the last two weeks. <br />
<br />
Finally, the Madame Illusia&#39;s spell began to wear off the new Devon and he became less enthusiastic about being trapped in a child&#39;s body again. He pleased with his new father to change back. <br />
<br />
“Are you fuckin’ KIDDING me?? I ain’t switchin’ back with you! Fuck that! I’m a grown up now! You have any idea how many men want to FUCK ME? I can fuck now! Besides which, you got a lot to make up for! Why should we go back? You got drunk and beat me up! Screw you! I make a way better dad.”<br />
<br />
<br />
“Oh Jesus, this is so wrong.” His former stepfather hung is head in his new ten year old body. &quot;I can&#39;t be a child. I just can&#39;t be! It&#39;s wrong to take my body! I&#39;m a grown man in here!&quot; <br />
<br />
<br />
“NO, what was wrong was you thinking you could fucking abuse me and beat me up. Well I guess that fuckin’ backfired, didn’t it, asshole? You beat the shit out of me. You cheated on my mom and then she fuckin’ died, probably in part from a broken heart, so I’m left with YOU? Fuck YOU, GIANCARLO. Oh, I mean…DEVON. I’m Giancarlo now.” The new Giancarlo casually blew smoke from his cigar like a pro. You would never think this handsome, strapping ladies man was actually only old enough to be in junior high, which is where he’d normally be right now. Only, he didn’t feel like staying a kid who was being abused and figured out a way to switch bodies with his overbearing, abusive, drunken stepfather. <br />
<br />
<br />
“No, you call me GIANCARLO. I’m Giancarlo!” <br />
<br />
<br />
 “You are DEVON now, little man! You’re the kid. I’m the grownup. You’re just gonna have to get used to it. I fucked this guy last night. My friend’s uncle! Ted! Holy shit, I get to bang my friend’s uncle! This is the greatest week of my life!” He drew on his cigar proudly, showing off his new muscles and doing a few poses in front of his new son. He loved being the dad. It was going to be way better. He and his stepfather had no choice but to trade bodies. He was the one who should be leader of the pack. He was the Alpha. He was the natural born leader. He was sick of being Devon. He wanted to be GIANCARLO. He deserved to be GIANCARLO! He deserved to be a strapping, hot, muscular Italian who ladies and beta males couldn’t help but notice. They adored him, and everywhere he went he got attention now. <br />
<br />
He had his whole routine down pat. It had only been two weeks, but he was already introducing himself as a grieving widower with a son he was raising as a single father. Just a pair of dudes, all alone, and isn’t my son adorable? Look at this guy. He’s my favorite little bud, aren’t you, buddy? <br />
<br />
<br />
He was really enjoying it. At first he thought of it as playing Giancarlo, like he was in a play. Only, the more he played him, the more he felt like him! It felt natural to come onto women and tell them they looked beautiful and see their reaction to him, to his stud body, his Alpha male genes oozing off of him, making them blush because their hormones were going crazy. He oozed testosterone. He looked like he should be in movies, and he could fuck like a racehorse now. His dong was fucking enormous and he felt like ten times the man he used to be, the ten year old boy was a MAN now, and he was never going to be able to go back to a normal life. He needed to be GIANCARLO. A single father. That was his identity now. <br />
<br />
<br />
“You’ll get used to it. I already have. I’m doing great at work. They love me there! I’m selling so much furniture. People just see this face and they light up. And I love describing things. Boss says I’m doing great and I’m the best manager they have. People look up to me. I’m respectable. It’s awesome. Why would I wanna give that up? Besides, you were doin’ lousy in this body, Devon!” <br />
<br />
<br />
“Stop calling me that. I’m Giancarlo.” <br />
<br />
<br />
The new Giancarlo just laughed, like it was the funniest thing in the world, because it was. So ludicrous. The new Devon’s eyes were burning with his new father’s cigar smoke. <br />
<br />
<br />
“Don’t worry. You’ll get used to it. Sure, you’re the smallest little small fry in a big lake full of fish that wanna eat ya. But it’ll all be over in what, 8 years? You’ll be 18 then. Just enjoy the ride, man. I know I am. I mean, honestly, what if we’re just better at living each other’s lives? You have fighting know how and even in that little body, you’re gonna do great. Fuck some shit up at school, man. You have my permission. Wallop those little fucks, I’ll be proud of you!” He finished his cigar and stubbed it out. God, he felt like such a man! <br />
<br />
<br />
“So I’m just supposed to let you take my life? This ain’t fair, man!” <br />
<br />
<br />
“It is fair. Motherfucker. Because you fucking beat me and I was only a small fry. Now say it. Say that you’re Devon and that Im Giancarlo, that I’m the man and you’re the boy, that I’m the Daddy and you’re the son. Say all that back to me and no lip, or I get to smack you around for a little while.” <br />
<br />
<br />
The new Devon burned with shame as he looked down, ready to cry. <br />
<br />
<br />
“Say all of that back to me. Say what our new roles are. Repeat that back to me. NOW.” <br />
<br />
<br />
“You’re the dad and I’m the son.” <br />
<br />
<br />
“Correct. Next.” <br />
<br />
<br />
“You’re the man and I’m the boy.” <br />
<br />
<br />
“Also correct. And what are our names?” The new Giancarlo put his hands on his knees and bent over close to hear his new son say it close to him, face to face. <br />
<br />
<br />
“I’m Devon and you’re Giancarlo.” <br />
<br />
<br />
“You’re goddamn right we are! I’m Giancarlo and you’re Devon. So that’s great. I’m really glad we had this conversation, kiddo. I am gonna be the best stepfather in the world to you. I decided that when I was offered the chance to swap bodies with you.” He led his new son inside the house. He led him into the backyard. It was a big back yard and they would have plenty of privacy. He flexed his muscles and lit a cigarette.<br />
<br />
Life was good. <br />
<br />
&quot;Now...I&#39;m gonna go to a bar and I&#39;m gonna have a few beers. Not like you used to. I&#39;m just gonna go meet some hot guys and uh...we&#39;re gonna have some fun playing around. If we come back here, then you make yourself scarce, capiche?&quot; New Giancarlo waited for him to agree before grabbing him by the lapel and lifting him up into the air a few inches. &quot;You understand me...SON?&quot; He blew cigarette smoke on his shrunken stepdad. <br />
<br />
The new Devon nodded. &quot;Yes. Yes, Sir.&quot; <br />
<br />
Hours later, Giancarlo brought back his new friend, Steve. Steve was in his 40s and a handsome DILF who had 3 kids of his own. The two men licked each other, kissed each other, made passionate love to each other. Giancarlo watched his new fuckstick enter this man, old enough to be his father. He started pummeling Steve as he moaned, enjoying it more and more as he went, proudly watching his own meat as he fucked a guy had become his favorite new pastime. <br />
<br />
&quot;You feel that big dick inside you, man? Huh?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh! Yes! Yes, yes, yes! Daddy. Oh, Daddy!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Daddy? Oh, I like that! FUCK YEAH! Call me Daddy again, SON!&quot; He fucked the older man, who repeated the phrase in the heat of the moment. Giancarlo was a fuck machine. No little boys here. He was ALL man. Giancarlo had been a ladies man but real men fucked men, he thought, with overwhelming and intense desire. His carnal lust was the same level as the first Giancarlo but now he desired gay sex for the most part. <br />
<br />
&quot;That was amazing. You&#39;re the hottest guy that has ever fucked me in my life!&quot; Steve exclaimed, completely spent. Giancarlo smacked him on the ass, hard. <br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s right, sweetcheeks. You spread that ass for Daddy.&quot; <br />
<br />
He felt cocky. He felt like screaming from the rooftops that he was the Daddy now and that he was in charge. <br />
<br />
Nothing could go wrong now, he thought...</p>
