<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Sniffing Jack’s socks has got you thinking about what he said about this house being haunted again. You told him that you had an inanimate fetish, to which he reacted surprisingly positively. He could be pulling your leg, but you could always indulge yourself and play some pretend. If you loved Jack’s socks so much, why not be them for a couple of hours? It wasn’t like this was real, anyway.<br />
<br />
Jack was still watching the TV, getting more and more drunk. You looked up at him. It was like you weren’t even here. Perfect. Acting on impulse, you lifted his legs up and laid down, rolling under him. He didn’t say anything or even look down, just pressing his bare feet right back on your chest and crotch.<br />
<br />
You tilt your head up a little to get a good look at his feet. They’re huge, easily the width of the majority of your torso. You can feel the sweat and dirt on you, and a pungent aroma starts to fill the air. Your cock is getting harder, as Jack presses his foot into your belly and pivots his toes over your cock, teasing it. He must have noticed you as you moan a little, but he still isn’t looking at you or doing anything. Clearly he must be playing to your fantasy. What a good friend, you think in your erotic haze.<br />
<br />
You continue to lay under his feet, your head leaned back with your eyes closed, for who knows how long. You can feel his feet sinking into you, as Jack continues to relax. You’re so comfortable, but you want to experience more and chance positions. You lean your head upwards and feel a sense of vertigo, as you stare at Jack’s toes. They’re so enticing.. Your mind is assaulted with scents and images of Jack’s feet, as you roll out from under him, and reposition yourself in a sort of U-shape, your face right in his toes.<br />
<br />
You feel shameless. Jack might think this is weird, but you don’t care, as you open your mouth and start to suck on Jack’s big toe. You can taste the sweat and dirt, and it’s very hot. For his part, Jack doesn’t seem to notice at all. You can feel your body curl around on the floor as Jack rests his other foot on your bare ass.<br />
<br />
As you suck on Jack’s toes, losing track of time, your mouth starts to widen as you gradually take more and more of Jack’s foot into your mouth. Jack’s other foot is starting to press into the crack between your buttcheeks. It’s a bit intrusive. You consider saying something, but that would ruin the fantasy. Socks get worn, right? It makes sense that Jack would want to play into that, so you don’t complain. Besides, you love Jack’s feet.<br />
<br />
As you lick and smell, you can feel a twisting sensation across your torso. It doesn’t hurt, but it does feel unusual. You try to reach down and examine it with your hands, as you continue to suck, but feel like you’re unable to. Are you pinned down? You don’t feel particularly stuck. Maybe you’re having some kind of sleep paralysis or something as Jack’s feet explore your holes. The foot in your butt is starting to make its way in now, your buttcheeks spread open as Jack’s big toe has entered your hole.<br />
<br />
You can feel his foot quickly enter your hole as you let out a moan, sliding your head forward on the foot you’re sucking on. You nearly have the entire foot in your mouth now. You briefly consider how that’s possible, but the sheer pleasure of it doesn’t matter as you feel yourself slide up to his ankle. You realize you can’t feel that strange twisting sensation anymore. It’s like your torso doesn’t even exist, completely devoid of  feeling.<br />
The pleasure in your ass though is more than enough to offset that, as Jack keeps pushing his foot in. He seems to have sobered up for a moment, when you hear “Hey, where’d you go buddy?” from above you.<br />
<br />
What? How far was he taking this? That was a strange comment. You try to disengage your mouth to make sure everything is okay, but you find yourself unable to, as you’re lifted up in the air.<br />
<br />
A huge sense of vertigo overtakes you as you feel yourself flying through the air at high speeds, stuck on Jack’s feet. He swings his legs out, as you realize that the sensations of your mouth and your asshole are completely separate. You’ve split in two.<br />
Dread overcomes you as you realize. You’re becoming Jack’s socks.<br />
<br />
Sure, this was a sexual fantasy, and up to now, you’ve been having a lot of fun, but you had no idea if this was permanent or not! You think about Jack calling the house haunted, and realize there’s a good chance it is. You try to scream, but no sound comes out. Instead, your mouth starts to fit to Jack’s foot even better as your throat slides up to his calf. You can feel his toes wiggling around in your belly.<br />
You mentally shout for Jack as you feel the part of you that was sucking on his foot mould to his foot, becoming soft. The scent of his foot is overwhelming, trying to overpower your brain, but fear is still in control for now.<br />
<br />
Jack looks down and sees one sock on one of his feet, and a strange lumpy.. socklike thing on the other. He pulls the other sock closer to him, and gasps. “Woah, it was real. I’m so sorry bud.. I didn’t mean to..” he says, seemingly scared. You want to call out to him, but you feel his foot slide further into his ass. It’s automatic, you can tell. He’s not doing this.<br />
<br />
“Bud! What are you doing!?” he asks, as you can’t stop your lower half from enveloping his foot, molding to a nice calf sock. The scent is getting stronger, as it gets harder to think about why this is wrong. Don’t you want to smell like this? It’s so sexy and hot..<br />
<br />
Jack seems to be panicking, but you’re having a hard time registering it as you feel yourself becoming softer, stitching becoming prominent on your body (or what was once a body) as your fabric thickens, darker cloth stitching on the heel and toe, and a logo across the front. Jack’s scent is driving you mad, as you become damp with scent. A logo for a construction wear company stitches itself across the toes of each of you.<br />
<br />
You don’t care anymore. Your mental screams are no longer for Jack to take you off or realize who you are. You’ve moved past that. Who you are is a pair of Jack’s socks. You need him to use you..<br />
<br />
“Ungh, what the hell.. Bud.. I..” Jack says, as you mentally coax him on.<br />
<br />
“I gotta.. Gotta..”<br />
<br />
Yes Jack, say it.. You think.<br />
<br />
“Gotta jerk.. off.” He says, suddenly lurching back into the sofa as his cock springs to life. He quickly takes his right sock off, the one that used to be your upper body. He brings you to his face, and gives you a deep whiff as he smells his powerful scent off of you. Both of your soles turn dark with sweat and dirt as Jack huffs deeply and strokes himself.<br />
<br />
He suddenly lifts you up and positions you over his cock, pulling you down all the way and cupping your hole around his balls, before jerking himself. The pleasure you feel is extreme, like your entire body is being jacked off. Jack moans and groans as he rubs his cock and fondles his balls, leaving you in total bliss.<br />
<br />
His breathing starts to get heavy as he chokes out a few syllables, before rearing his head back and releasing an enormous loud into you, which fills you with ultimate pleasure as the thick load of cum starts to sink into your fabric. As it does so, you lose your sense of identity – you’ve never been a human or Jack’s friend, just his nasty favorite pair of work socks.<br />
<br />
Jack pulls you off his cock and stretches, as he slips the sock back on. “What a fuckin’ game.” He says, after watching the TV. “Better go to bed.”<br />
<br />
He leaves the two piles of his dirty clothes alone on the floor as he heads up to his room and crashes on the bed, quickly falling asleep with his dirty work socks on. He’s been wearing them for a month now, with no plan on stopping anytime soon.</p>
