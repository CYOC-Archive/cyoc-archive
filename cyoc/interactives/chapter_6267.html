<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">James walks over to his latest subject and smiles, “Hello, I’m James…”   The now big guy looks like he has tears in his eyes and is having trouble searching for the right words.  <br />
<br />
“I’m… I’m Joseph.   I think I’m having a big day.”  James still can’t decide whether the boy likes being obese or not.  Joe is still struggling for words, “I’m so hungry… and I’m so horny … I just wish I could figure some way out of this…”<br />
<br />
“Out of this?” James asked, prodding Joseph to tell him more.<br />
<br />
“I always wanted to be big – but I feel so weak and I just wish I could be bigger and have enough strength to get around.”<br />
<br />
“Maybe I could help…” James offered.  <br />
<br />
“But I don’t want to be muscular at all… I want to jiggle when I walk and bounce.  I want my fat to stick out of my clothes.  I want to wear clothes that are way too small on me.  I wish I was massive.  I’ve got to figure out how I can do that”, Joe was starting to sweat he wanted it so much.<br />
<br />
James played a little with the Maker and Joe suddenly looked like he was much stronger, but at the same time his body started to swell.  His cheeks swelled, causing his eyes to look like they were receding back into his head.  You could see his little eyes peering over the huge mounds of fat that filled his face and jowls.  His ears swelled with fat and his chins bloated, pushing his head up so that he would never again have the chance to look down.  His arms swelled and he could feel the fat hanging off his back, under his arms and around to his chest.  His tits swelled enormously and his nipples were now almost four and a half inches wide.  <br />
<br />
Joe felt the fullness of them, but was getting incredibly turned on by the fact that his colossal gut was now expanding upward, pushing his fat tit sacs to slide down the side of his gut.  He could feel the sensitive nipples sliding along his skin as they moved.  He couldn’t take a breath without them moving up and down.<br />
<br />
He felt his gut push out over four feet in front of him and couldn’t even get his fat sausage like hands to meet in front of him.  Then Joe felt it as his love handles began to push further out and was overcome with ecstasy as he felt his fat ballooning over his already hidden crotch.  He felt it as his fat encircled his dick surrounding it with waves of pleasure.  His gut hung down to within almost an inch of his knees.<br />
<br />
Joe would have jumped for joy if he hadn’t started feeling his fat arse beginning to expand as well.  He could feel his cheeks rub together and expand, filling out his otherwise lopsided form.  They had to be over a yard wide.  He felt grateful for the weight there, fat pulling on him in every direction.  Finally he wouldn’t loose his balance.<br />
<br />
Just when he thought he wasn’t going to get any bigger, Joe felt his massive legs begin to bloat.  Viewing any of his extraordinary changes was out of the question, but he could feel the waves of rapture passing through his entire body as the fat in his legs expanded.  <br />
<br />
James was admiring his handiwork with the Maker when he saw how Joe’s hands were trying to explore his new body.   His fingers were so encased in fat that he could hardly do more than wiggle them.  Even that small action sent waves of pleasure through him as his fat rippled up his arm and across the bulk of his soft and flaccid chest.<br />
<br />
Finally Joe was able to move and he made like he was going to run, but his body entrapped him; but at the same time he felt elated.  But quickly his smile faded and James wondered what wrong?<br />
<br />
”What’s wrong big guy?” he asked.<br />
<br />
“Well… I’m almost as big as I wished I could be… but I still look like a little boy…”<br />
<br />
”Say no more Lil’ Joe…” and James made a few adjustments with the Maker.  Joe felt it as a five o’clock shadow began to form along the line of where his jaw would be, had in not been surrounded in fat.   As it grew thicker, he felt his chest begin to itch and wanted to look down but couldn’t.  He started toward the building, where he knew the men’s room had a full length mirror, but before he could get more than a few paces, he felt his whole body itching – his pudgy sausage fingers doing their best to scratch at it.  When he got to the men’s room what he saw startled and amazed him into another level of exhilaration.  His copper colored hair was everywhere on his body that he could see.  It was especially thick on his sagging tits and he could see it forming a very thick treasure trail down his massive gut disappearing from view under his vast tonnage.  He knew that his back was covered all the way down and felt the hairs on his butt cheeks pull as he shifted his weight in his pants.  He couldn’t see the skin on his legs because the hair was so thick.  He reached up with his fat fingers and ran them through his full beard.   The hair on his head was now better than shoulder length.<br />
<br />
Joe stood there, marveling at the reflection of the enormous wooly mammoth of a man that was now him.  He wanted to go and find his new little friend James and thank him for the pleasures that were now endlessly his.  He wanted to share every happiness he could with his little friend.<br />
<br />
As Joe slowly made his way back, he felt the fat encasing his cock rub him constantly up and down as his fat tits pushed back and forth on top of his gut with every step he took.    He was going to be horny and hungry for the rest of his life.  He didn’t mind at all, his little friend would see to that… he was sure.</p>
