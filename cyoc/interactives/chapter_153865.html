<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Luke felt so bad. He was getting the worst stomachache in his life! He puked a few times but he didn&#39;t feel better. &quot;Ugh! Why did I accept to do it?&quot; He told himself as he stared at his look in the mirror.<br />
<br />
After almost an hour, he started to feel better, so he came out of the bathroom.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you ok?&quot; Kyle, his best friend, asked him. &quot;We heard some grunts in there.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not too much.&quot; Luke replied. &quot;I think I got intoxicated.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry, we don&#39;t think you&#39;ll get so sick!&quot; Kyle said. &quot;We better go home...&quot;<br />
<br />
Kyle and the others left Luke&#39;s home and he went directly to his bedroom. He felt ao bad that he didn&#39;t eat his dinner and he fell asleep until the next day.<br />
<br />
In the morning, Luke wasn&#39;t feeling better. His stomach was gurgling and groaning continously and he tried to puke a few times with no success. He wanted to skip school but he knew that his mom won&#39;t let him without asking for a reason and he could get in troubles by eating a unknown fruit that he don&#39;t even know it&#39;s edible.<br />
<br />
However, he stood in the bathroom as long as he could before he realized he&#39;s going to get late. He quickly changed his clothes and ran to bus stop.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just in time!&quot; He sighed when he saw the bus almost leaving. He felt a bit sticky and sweaty, probably from running. His body felt tingly all over, but he just brushed it off.<br />
<br />
When he made it to his classroom, he noticed that his shirt started to feel a bit tight. Was it shrinking on him? Not only that, but his shoes were getting tight on him as well, to the point where his clothes were getting very uncomfortable! After about twenty minutes of sitting in his chair and feeling his shirt, his shoes, and now his shorts getting unbearably tight, he raised his hand.<br />
<br />
“Yes, Luke?” Asked his teacher.<br />
<br />
“Miss Oak! I need to go to the bathroom!” he squealed.<br />
<br />
“Alright, here is your pass!” She said, handing the boy a piece of wood with the word -bathroom- painted on it.<br />
<br />
Luke took the wooden bar and dashed out the door.  He was moving fast because he felt that the top buttons of his shirt were about to pop off! He raced to the boy’s room and ran into an empty stall. Just in time, for the top three buttons of his shirt popped off, one right after the other! POP! POP! POP!!<br />
<br />
“Holy smoke! What the heck is going on?” Luke wondered, realizing that his chest had gotten too big for his shirt. Next, he bent down and noticed that his jeans had become too small for him! He had gotten taller!<br />
<br />
“Dang! Is this an allergic reaction to that fruit?! I&#39;m swelling!” He gasped, as he frantically started unbuckling his belt which was around his waist.<br />
<br />
In the meantime, his feet were killing him! His shoes were just holding back his feet from growing, while his toes, his ankles, and his feet were expanding at a rapid rate! His sneakers couldn’t restrict his growing feet any longer aand...<br />
<br />
RRRRRIIIIPPPPPP!!! Suddenly, his toes burst out from the front soles of his sneakers! “AAACKK!” Luke gasped, just as he had managed to get his belt off and started sliding his jeans down his much longer legs!<br />
<br />
“What is happening to me?! WHOA!! MY VOICE!” Luke immediately noticed how his voice sounded different! It sounded deeper! Lower! &quot;No matter what happened now, those clothes needed to come OFF!&quot; He shouted as he frantically tore the remains of his shirt and t-shirt off, while he had already gotten rid of his jeans and his shoes.<br />
<br />
Now, all he had left were his underwear and his socks. He quickly opened the door to the stall and dashed before the large mirror, which was hanging before the sink on the wall. What he saw as his reflection shocked him!<br />
<br />
He had grown taller!! a LOT taller! His chest was bigger, his torso was wider, his arms were thicker and his legs were longer! His muscles had inflated and now he had BODY HAIR!<br />
<br />
The brown hair on his head had grown messier past his ears, but he had also gained a lot of hair on his chest, under his armpits, and on his chin and under his nose! He had a beard stubble now!<br />
<br />
“Oh man! Is this real?! I look OLDER! Too much older!” Luke gasped. In his reflection he no longer recognized a preteen boy but definitely a grown man, who was now possibly twice as old! He guessed that he was now in his late twenties or even his thirties!<br />
<br />
He was about six feet tall! Not only were his socks too small for his size 14 feet, but his underwear was killing him. He pulled down his tight briefs and gasped at the sight of his manhood and testicles.<br />
<br />
&quot;They had grown tremendously!&quot; He gasped as he felt his hefty balls with a hand. &quot;I need to get home! I gotta get outta here!&quot; He shouted in a panic.<br />
<br />
Then, Luke took his clothes in his arms and dashed out of the bathroom, running towards the door. He then raced out through the schoolyard and ran home as fast as he could and covering his nudeness with his tattered clothes, he felt so exposed that he could die of embarrassment in that moment!<br />
<br />
Fortunately for him, he was seen only by a couple of old people who thought that he was doing one of those ridiculous challenges that millennials loves. He wasn&#39;t even a millenial! He was born way more past the 2000&#39;s!<br />
<br />
He wasn&#39;t too worried about his nudity or getting home fast. Hiding his sudden, freaky growth spurt was going to be the next major concern on his mind for now. He didn&#39;t know if it was permanent or temporary. How would he explain this to his parents? What will he do?!!</p>
