<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Stepping inside the Moon Lake Gazette office for the first time in three days; Lance felt like he was finally home. While his real house was only down the street; a quick five minute walk if he was inclined to do so, Lance always felt that this building was home for him. Smiling as he greeted the security guard and signing in his girlfriend Lila; both head up in the elevator to his office and what is affectionately referred to as the bull pen. The bull pen being the floor in which his main staff of reporters sit and write up their stories.<br />
<br />
Being the weekend and the only people Lance is seeing are a few custodial personnel and the reporter writing up his story for the upcoming Seahawks playoff game; Lance entered his office to see a mountain of paperwork waiting for him.<br />
“I’m away from my desk for a few days,” Lance groans.<br />
“The perils of being the wer-panther rep,” Lila carpenter chuckling; “I guess.”<br />
“I’m sure you have a stack of paperwork,” Lance looking at Lila; “waiting for you at city hall.”<br />
“Touché,” Lila chuckling; “I’ll get the coffee going. But my paperwork,” Lila grinning at her mate; “is numbers and spreadsheets. You have to proof read and edit each article your reporters have filled.”<br />
“Well this heavy book,” Lance picking it up and handing it to Lila; “is for you. Financial reports for KPXX.”<br />
“Ooooh,” Lila laughing; “putting me to work already?”<br />
“Well,” Lance sitting down to begin the arduous task of catching up on much needed work; “You niece and nephews are coming over later today. I’m sure they are going to run us ragged, like you said last night.”<br />
“I’ll take this home then,” Lila putting the accounting book aside; “I do need to get your house in order for Cindy, Jasper and Yogi. As well as do some grocery shopping,” Lila smiling; “so try not to be here too late. There is always Sunday to finish off the rest.”<br />
<br />
Lance smiles. Knowing Lila was right, he focused on the more important article that needed his attention; replying to a few emails and letting the rest wait until tomorrow or Monday all the while Lila was doing a cursory review of KPXX’s financials. Lance knew he would have no time today to get the engagement ring he needed to make his and Lila’s proposal official. Getting bowled over with his were-tigress beating him to the punch with ‘marry me’ question; he said yes on the condition he gets the chance to do it right on Christmas day. So far, only Lila’s brother Rick knows that Lance intends to pop the question. Lance’s brother Benton and his wife Amanda suspect an engagement ring in the future; just neither know when or how soon Lila will want Lance to say ‘I do’ in front of the minister.<br />
<br />
Lance; putting a few articles he already looked over in his out basket, is secretly looking at a website for a local jeweler advertising diamond rings, ear rings and other assorted jewelry. Seeing that they are open tomorrow; Lance makes a mental note to visit the establishment on Sunday, alone.<br />
<br />
<br />
******<br />
<br />
Pulling up the large gated wall bordering and equally impressive estate; Anton and Esmeralda press the intercom button and wait.<br />
“Who is it,” a voice on the other end responds.<br />
“Please inform Tachibana No Akane,” Anton speaking clearly that Anton and Esmeralda Knight are here. We are old friends of hers.”<br />
“I will see if she is available,” The voice stating; “please wait.”<br />
<br />
There was a cold silence ending the terse conversation. Both Anton and Esmeralda, each over two hundred years in age, Anton being older; wait for seemed like an hour, when it was only ten minutes. The door opening to the estate and being instructed to drive on up; it was another few minutes when they were greeted by a grey furred were-fox attendant. Smiling as hew escorts the elder were’s inside. Both quickly disrobe and embrace their furry side. Anton a black furred were-panther with streaks of grey through his fur, while his wife Esmeralda was a silver furred were-panthress; handing their clothes to the attendant and being escorted through the estate to a day room that is opened up to the garden. Allowing those in the room to stare outside as the snow starts to gently come down.<br />
<br />
Tachibana along with her white were-tiger guests, each get up to great the two were-panthers.<br />
“Anton, Esmeralda,” Tachibana accepting each other’s paw in a friendly greeting; “it’s been too long.”<br />
“Island life suits us,” Anton chuckling; “I hope to see you one day at our little retirement commune.”<br />
“I’m afraid,” Tachibana letting everyone sit back down; “that won’t be possible. I love this town too much to leave it. I’m here until I pass on.”<br />
“But not for many more year to come,” Esmeralda acknowledging; “but it would be nice if you called us now and then.”<br />
“That I can do,” Tachibana offering her guests tea; “we were just sitting down for breakfast. Care for some?”<br />
“We already had breakfast with our son’s and granddaughter,” Anton accepting the cup of tea; “so we are good on the food for a time being.”<br />
“Anton, Esmeralda,” Tachibana remembering her manners; “please let me introduce you to Far Houjin and his grandson Kai Hu Wang.”<br />
“The owners and operators of the Wang Technical Consortium,” Anton staring at the two white were-tigers; “I may live on an island but that doesn’t mean I’ve been out of the loop regarding business news. You two are supposed to be on some sort of spiritual retreat,” Anton shaking the paw from each; “what are you doing here in Moon Lake?”<br />
“That is a complicated story,” Far speaking; “It has to do with your son Benton.”<br />
“As they say,” Anton responding; “I’m all ears.”<br />
<br />
Far Houjin looking at his grandson and making it clear that he is to remain silent begins to speak. Detailing how his company set up the infrastructure that Knight industries relies on for its network and security; detailing how Kai’s father felt Benton was a treacherous snake demanding more for less. The relationship between the two companies became strained and the two white tigers heading to Moon Lake to seek the assistance of Tachibana and the Skulk in removing Benton from power and instilling Frieda as the new ceo of Knight Industries.<br />
“You better be joking there,” Anton putting his tea down; “because I will not have you mess with my family.”<br />
“You’ll be pleased to know that the plan has not been enacted,” Tachibana staring at the were-panther who’s anger is starting to rise; “your son actions of late and recent medical issues, have put it on hold.”<br />
“I’m well aware of Benton’s bi-polar disorder,” Anton looking serious; “as well as his stupid temper tantrum in attacking your head office. My son told me everything.”<br />
“Has he told you,” Tachibana speaking; “that Jack Crawford is making inroads into the company you founded?”<br />
“That is partly why I’m here,” Anton speaking; “the council barring Benton from leaving Moon Lake until he proves mental stability doesn’t exactly help him from managing the company.”<br />
“We paid a visit to Jack yesterday,” Far speaking up; “our talk was less than cordial.”<br />
“Well what did you expect grandfather,” Kai finally speaking; “breaking into his condo, to do more than talk.”<br />
“Hold on,” Tachibana looking surprised; “you did what yesterday?”<br />
“We just informed him,” Far choosing not to reveal how they bugged Jack’s computer; “that his attempt to oust Benton will not succeed without our help.”<br />
“And he knows you two are most likely hiding out here,” Tachibana looking distraught; “which means it won’t be long before Benton finds out.”<br />
“I doubt Jack will call up Benton,” Far sipping his tea; “from what I’ve heard those two hate eat other with a passion.”<br />
“It’s because my son,” Anton answering; “stole Jack’s birthright right from under him. My friend and former business partner,” Anton sighing; “Joseph Crawford was pissed when my son forced him out in a rigged proxy fight. It soured our friendship and we haven’t spoken since.”<br />
“Greed tends to do that,” Kia answering; “Benton’s love for money knows no bounds.”<br />
“And what our granddaughter,” Esmeralda answering; “what about the love Benton has for Frieda? Does it not trump his greed?”</p>
