<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Reaching into the dirt, you pulled the small shimmering object from the ground, discovering in fact that it <br />
was a very plain, very ordinary looking, plain gold ring. &quot;Rats, and here's me thinking it might be a piece of <br />
old Aztec gold or something,&quot; you chuckled, wiping the much from rings surface. It must belong to one of the <br />
students you thought, as you examined closely, finding that there appeared to be no markings or engravings or <br />
anything to indicate who it belonged to. &quot;Oh well, guess I'll drop it off in the lost and found,&quot; you <br />
shrugged, shoving the ring into your pocket and pulling yourself back together, the effect of the football to <br />
your chest gradually having worn off.<br />
<br />
You briefly gazed over towards the pack of jocks still messing around with said football on the campus lawn, <br />
recognizing one or two of them from the fraternity house next to your dorm. &quot;Dicks!&quot; you said under your <br />
breath as you noticed two of them pointing at you and laughing, re-enacting your collision and taking great <br />
pleasure in ridiculing you. Not that you needed much help in that respect, having completely made a fool of <br />
yourself even before your utter lack of athletic prowess and ability to catch a football came into play. You <br />
were certainly no Olympian when it came to sports that's for sure, lacking the required coordination and <br />
skill, being what one might consider &quot;clumsy&quot; ever since you were small. Maybe that's where you were going <br />
wrong you pondered as you put your head down and made your way towards your dorm, what girl would want to go <br />
out with some scrawny little geek when there were plenty of muscle blown jocks around with IQ's smaller than <br />
their shoe size?<br />
<br />
&quot;Bah, just don't think about it Simon, don't think about it,&quot; you chanted to yourself, a mantra you'd been <br />
using for quite a few years now. &quot;Just go home and find Mike, he'll cheer you up.&quot;<br />
<br />
The Mike in question was your roommate, a real cool guy, funny and sharp witted, without being up himself like <br />
a lot of people around here. Like you he wasn't particularly athletic either or much for having his head stuck <br />
in a book, lazy possibly being the word that sprung to mind (at least when it came to work). Unlike you <br />
however Mike was actually considered quite popular throughout your year, perhaps not with the girls so much <br />
(though he would often assure you he was), but more with the slacker, partying crowd, everyone in your dorm <br />
building knowing that if a party was on, Mike was the first guy on the list.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey hey buddy, hows it hanging?&quot; Mike's friendly voice greeted you as you walked in your room, lying on his <br />
bed, still in his underwear casually flicking through a magazine, &quot;Class over already?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Classes, plural. More than one,&quot; you informed him, all too aware that he hadn't been to any of them, the fact <br />
that he was dressed in only his boxers indicating that he'd more than likely only just got up. &quot;Busy day?&quot; you <br />
asked as you threw down your bag and slumped back onto the chair beside your desk.<br />
<br />
&quot;Busy night buddy, busy night. I didn't get back here till like 5 in the morning. I tell you that party was <br />
tight!&quot; he grinned, looking particularly satisfied.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know, I heard you come in. If you're gonna stay up half the night, can't you at least go and crash in one <br />
of your &quot;girlfriend's&quot; rooms?&quot;<br />
<br />
Aware that you were mocking him, Mike simply shook his head, throwing his magazine down on the floor and <br />
jumping off the bed. &quot;Think what you want Simon,&quot; he continued to grin as he headed into the bathroom, &quot;Just <br />
cause I'm getting some and you're not, there's no need to be jealous now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Jealous, yeah right,&quot; you smirked under your breath as Mike disappeared from view, certain that one day you'd <br />
get to the bottom of the tales of his &quot;many conquests&quot; sooner or later.<br />
<br />
&quot;Speaking of the ladies though, how'd it go with whats-her-face?&quot; he called back out, his voice warped with <br />
the sound of brushing teeth, &quot;That girl from your English lit class...you were gonna ask her out, right?&quot; <br />
<br />
You didn't reply, still feeling too embarrassed by the incident to even tell your friend, having hoped that <br />
he'd take your mind off of that particular exchange, not immediately ask about it. &quot;This is probably why I <br />
shouldn't tell him everything I do,&quot; you thought, having been bouncing the idea of asking Jenna out off of him <br />
for the past two weeks.<br />
<br />
&quot;Simon?&quot; Mike's voice continued, waiting expectantly for a reply, his head appearing a moment later behind the <br />
door with toothpaste dribbling down his chin. &quot;Don't keep me hanging here dude, you ask her out or what?&quot;<br />
<br />
Letting out a deep sigh and flipping open your laptop, you looked back up at your friend and mumbled rather <br />
non comitantly, &quot;Kinda...&quot; hoping that would satisfy him while you distracted yourself with your computer.<br />
<br />
&quot;Kinda? What do you mean Kinda?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh well, here it comes,&quot; you thought, realizing that you'd just opened yourself up a can of worms, thinking <br />
it might have just been better to tell him you hadn't asked her yet, resigned now to the fate of filling in <br />
your friend about your feeble efforts.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh shit dude, that's weak,&quot; Mike laughed, once the story was over, &quot;I mean even for you dude, that's weak as <br />
hell. You got to grow yourself some balls, you can't be afraid of woman all your life.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm not afraid of woman!&quot; you protested.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yeah, really? When was the last time you even had a date?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I...not, uh...not that long ago...&quot; you mumbled, trailing off at the end, feeling a little embarrassed and <br />
actually proving his point, realizing the last time you properly gone out with a girl was back in high school <br />
in the 10th grade (and the only reason you'd actually managed to pop your cherry being large quantity's of <br />
alcohol, a drunk and horny heavyset girl and a broken dorm room lock at freshers week), your social <br />
awkwardness and lack of confidence getting in the way far too much since then.<br />
<br />
&quot;Exactly! We're college dudes now Simon, these are the best years of our lives. You've got to lose all your <br />
stupid hang ups and just do what feels right, bite the bullet and just ask this Gemma girl out.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Jenna.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Jenna, Gemma, Genie, whatever,&quot; Mike flippantly replied, strangely having a hard time remembering the girl <br />
you were interested in's name but not the wide variety he supposedly hooked up with every night (reeling them <br />
off like he was reading from a grocery list). &quot;The point is, stop over-thinking it and just do it! And soon, <br />
I'm starting to worry about you, anymore of this moping around talking about your feelings all day and you're <br />
gonna start turning into a woman yourself!&quot;<br />
<br />
You couldn't help but laugh at that, considering for a moment that it would certainly save all the humiliation <br />
and heart-break if you could just frig yourself off alone at home everyday.</p>
