<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As they left the bus, Yvonne noticed that Sally was only up to her shoulder and a couple of years younger (about the same age as my new little sister, she thought.) Yvonne had a hard time thinking of her as the football coach now, she was so soft and precious.  Then she got to thinking about the rest of the team.  Was there still a football team?<br />
<br />
Thinking that Sally would know, Yvonne asked her when the football team had usually practiced (before the Change.) She told her that since a game was coming up (or had been) a practice was scheduled for that day, after class, so Yvonne had to wait out the school day before she could satisfy her curiosity.<br />
 <br />
With Sally's little hand grasping her own, Yvonne wandered the hall of the magically changed school.  She was amused to find that the male washrooms had all disappeared, to be replaced either by nothing, or by a second set of doors into the newly expanded girls' bathroom. Clusters of ex-boys, all whispering to each other, would enter hesitantly, and then leave silently with their soft cheeks blushing.<br />
<br />
In the meantime, the ones who had been born as girls were reveling in their new power, teasing some of the new girls mercilessly about the size of their breasts and their missing penises. Yvonne had to personally step in to stop a mean girl from spanking two ex-boys. She was seated on a bench with one on either side, skirts up, and bottoms in the air while the born-girl smacked them until they cried.<br />
<br />
Classes were somewhat different now. Almost every new-girl was younger at least by two years than she had been as a boy. Many of the new-girls were returned to freshmen classes, not only to separate them from the born-girls, but to help them adjust to their new lives. However, no one had any qualms when Yvonne brought Sally into her junior biology class and sat the girl on her knee while the born-female teacher lectured on the human reproductive system. Yvonne found the discussion of how people now reproduced in the all female world fascinating.<br />
<br />
Finally, the day was over, and Yvonne went to the gym where she knew the football team would be getting ready. Instead, she found the cheerleaders warming up, or at least that's what she thought.  She recognized some of the people on the squad and no ex-boys seemed to be present. The cheerleaders were dressed in black sports bras and tight spandex shorts.<br />
<br />
&quot;What's going on?&quot; Yvonne asked Paige, someone she knew on the squad. &quot;Where'd the football players go?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No more football,&quot; Paige replied. &quot;It's a boy's game, anyway. Now we have something better.&quot; As Yvonne watched, the girls lined up and began to play the new game, which looked something like football, except that instead of tackling the players tried to strip off colored patches Yvonne now noticed were velcroed to the front of each bra. When the patches came off, the wearer's breasts would often spill out and jiggle alluringly. Yvonne felt weak in the knees as the girls ran back and forth in the gym, trying to grope each other.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yvonne,&quot; Sally murmured. &quot;My panties feel wet.&quot;<br />
<br />
Yvonne was about to respond when the gym door burst open and a gaggle of ex-boys ran in, the ones in the lead obviously furious. Yvonne realized immediately these were the ex-football players. Two or three in the front were wearing long t shirts as if to cover themselves, but most of them were clad in some kind of uniform: black, lacy bras with pink frills, black, bikini style panties with the same frills, and around their neck some kind of lace collar that seemed to hook into their bra cups right around their nipples.<br />
<br />
&quot;Um, girls.. women,&quot; one at the back started to mutter, but one wearing a t-shirt cut her off.<br />
<br />
&quot;Get out of the gym!&quot; she sneered at the cheerleaders. &quot;The football team needs to practice.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There is no football team now,&quot; Paige said, towering over the girl. Paige was 17. The football player looked like she was 13, if that. &quot;But if you put on your uniform we'll let you watch us practice.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uniform? You mean those ridiculous things?&quot; She jerked a thumb at her former teammates. &quot;I'm not going to wear a bra.&quot;<br />
<br />
Paige laughed. &quot;You obviously haven't figured out the new order yet. You're cheerleaders now. You watch us play, do little dances, and shake your feminine little bodies to make us happy. When we win, you reward us. Sound familiar?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Jimmy,&quot; Sally exclaimed.  &quot;Jimmy, if that's you, I think you should listen to Paige. Be a good girl!&quot;<br />
<br />
But it didn't look like Jimmy was going to have much of a choice. Before he could take a step, Paige grabbed her around the shoulders with one arm, and ripped away her patch with the other. Pale, freckled breasts spilled out, the nipples already stiffening. Jimmy struggled, but weakly. As soon as Paige's nipple was in her mouth, her legs seemed to fail her and Paige had to lower the new girl to the floor. Sucking on her greedily, Jimmy didn't seem to notice when Paige's hand stole up her t shirt and pulled off a pair of plain cotten panties. Then the new girl began to moan as Paige's went back up her legs.<br />
<br />
The other new girls who weren't wearing uniforms -- the two of them -- watched the whole scene in awe. Nadia, another one of the ex-cheerleaders Yvonne knew, barked out orders.<br />
<br />
&quot;You two.  Strip.  Now.  The others, get them new uniforms.&quot; Four new girls scurried off to obey. Once the two others were naked, Nadia helped them into their uniforms. Yvonne could see now that the collar was clipped not just to their bra cups, but to their nipples, causing their breasts to tug and sway with the movement of their new slender necks. The ex boys winced as the clips were locked in place.<br />
<br />
Once the new girls were suitably attired, Nadia had them get down on their knees. &quot;I think you should practice rewarding us now,&quot; Nadia said,  positioning herself in front of one of the new girls she had helped dress.  She pulled down her spandex shorts, revealing no panties underneath, and then grabbed the ex boy by the hair and pushed the new girl's face into her crotch. Her hips began to sway as the former football player (someone she had dated once, in fact) began to suck on her clit.<br />
<br />
The other ex-cheerleaders followed her example and soon the gym was filled with the sounds of female pleasure. Yvonne felt something on her skirt and looked down to see Sally eagerly trying to pull down her panties so she could join in the fun.<br />
<br />
Yvonne stroked Sally's soft hair and told her to...</p>
