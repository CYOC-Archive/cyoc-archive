<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Kim rubbed, Evelyn could feel the changes beginning to course through her body. Her belly dragged against the floor as her body slowly shrank and contracted.  She flexed her claw, and felt her digits changing, becoming longer, thinner, and more flexible.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm, that&#39;s odd, &quot; said Kim behind her, her voice deeper than Evelyn remembered.  She sucked in few deep breaths.  &quot;My shirt is a little tight.  Actually, my shorts are, too.  I wonder if this shampoo is shrinking my clothes.&quot;  <br />
<br />
Evelyn smiled.  She knew Kim was changing, too, and soon she would have a new companion.  Hopefully one she could turn into an ally in her plan for revenge against Mary Lou. Evelyn closed her eyes, enjoying the changes occurring in her body.  Kim&#39;s arm resting on her back began to feel heavier.  She could feel Kim&#39;s hand expanding and stretching larger as it rested on her back.  Sharp claws poked her back, and Evelyn jumped a little.  Kim looked down and saw the changes on her hand.  Understandably, she was upset, and immediately jumped off of Evelyn&#39;s back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ahh, what&#39;s happening to my hand! &quot; screamed Kim. <br />
<br />
But Evelyn wasn&#39;t done with her yet.  She needed more contact if she wanted to become as human as possible.  With her new flexible back, she turned and grabbed Kim&#39;s bare calf.  Evelyn could already see green scales developing on Kim&#39;s skin, and could feel them hardening and becoming tough under her grasp.  <br />
<br />
&quot;You can&#39;t do that, &quot; said Kim in shock, surprised by the flexibility of the large alligator.<br />
<br />
Kim stared at her calf under Evelyn&#39;s grip, wet and covered with soapy suds.  As she watched her calves and thighs began to get thicker and longer.  <br />
<br />
&quot;What......what are you doing?&quot; said Kim softly, and she weakly tried to shake free of Evelyn&#39;s grip.<br />
<br />
With her free hand, Evelyn slipped the muzzle off of her shrinking snout.  &quot;Shhh.  It will all be over soon.  Just relax, and enjoy it, &quot; said Evelyn soothingly.<br />
<br />
Kim&#39;s eyes went wide.  She had no idea that the gator was capable of speech, much less intelligent conversation.  She was too shocked to fight Evelyn&#39;s grip.<br />
<br />
Kim&#39;s calf was soon too large for Evelyn to grip, and she had to settle for just touching it.  They both heard a ripping sound, and watched as Kim&#39;s feet tore through her shoes, growing longer and thicker.  The long black claws extending from her toes had shredded her socks.  The change was enough to spur her into action.  She kicked away from Evelyn, and began to back away from her, dragging her butt along the floor.    Evelyn watched the girl with amusement.  Her bright red hair was falling out in clumps, revealing a bald green head.  Her mouth was filled with sharp jagged teeth, and she could see her nose flattening against her mouth as it stretched into a snout.  The girl was fighting it, but it was too late.<br />
<br />
Evelyn stood up, now finally able to stand digitigrade again.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Easy, now.  I am not going to hurt you, &quot; she said, as she advanced towards the girl, shrinking a little with each step.  <br />
<br />
The girl in turn was growing, stretching her clothes tightly against her massive body.  Several rips and tears had formed across the garments.<br />
<br />
Kim continued to back away, but she suddenly stopped and turned on her side on the floor.  A large tail was sprouting from her back, and it made it impossible for her to scoot across the floor on her butt.  With a large ripping noise Kim&#39;s shorts were torn apart at the seams by her widening hips.  Kim tried to cover herself, but Evelyn saw that it made no difference now.  Her entire pelvis and abdomen was now covered in thick leathery skin. Her freckles had been replaced with white scales on her green skin.<br />
<br />
Evelyn grabbed the girl, and pulled her to her feet.  It wasn&#39;t easy - they were now both about the same height and weight.  It didn&#39;t help that the girl kept trying to stand on her heels, rather than the balls of her feet.  Eventually the girl got it, and began to steady herself.  Evelyn walked to the still water in her pond, to examine her own changes.<br />
<br />
Kim&#39;s shirt was barely hanging on, attached only by a few threads that groaned as Kim&#39;s chest continued to grow wider.  Eventually the shirt could contain her chest no more, and ripped apart, falling to the floor and leaving her nude. She looked down at her chest to see her small breasts recede into her body.  Thick scales grew over her nipples, leaving her with a smooth reptilian chest.  Finally, her transformation was over.<br />
<br />
Kim looked at Evelyn, then at herself.  She examined her clawed hands, thick scaly abdomen, and muscular  thighs.<br />
<br />
&quot;What.....what did you to me?&quot; said Kim softly, as she continued to look over her strange new body.<br />
<br />
Evelyn looked up from the pond, satisfied that her changes were complete and she was once again an anthro-morphic alligator.  She turned and saw Kim staring at her with fear and confusion.  She looked behind Kim and realized her mistake.  Kim was closer to the exit, and if she decided to bolt, she could lock Evelyn in here and ruin all her plans.<br />
<br />
Evelyn raised her hands in supplication, and began to slowly approach the frightened young girl, now a hybrid of human and alligator.  &quot;Now take it easy.  There is no need to do anything rash.  I can explain everything, &quot; said Evelyn.</p>
