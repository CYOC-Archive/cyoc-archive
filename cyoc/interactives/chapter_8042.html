<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Shawn snuggled close to Wally who only a short time ago had been his dog and now had become something more. He closed his eyes and snuggled closer as he felt the new bulky body of Wally hug him tightly and pant slightly in his ear. This was one of the weirdest positions Shawn had ever found himself in. However, oddly it was perhaps one of the most comfortable emotionally. He had never really felt this content before just snuggling up to someone. Well that wasn’t completely true he had felt very content when snuggling Wally before and he had felt that way once or twice in the after glow of sex with Karen a woman he had dated but who had dumped him years ago. But this was a weird alchemy of the two. He felt very content though and happy and a little filled in both the physical and spiritual sense.<br />
	A part of his mind said logically none of this made any sense and he should he blowing a gasket. His dog had just anally penetrated him, his dog that had suddenly changed from taken off his cloths and of all things could talk now, and this was surreal in just about every sense of the word. Yet Shawn just could not get worked up about it he felt too good to question this all to heavily. Perhaps tomorrow he would. <br />
	He slowly moved his hips massaging his crotch against Wally’s belly feeling the wild tingle of all that fur tickling his exposed penis. It felt very good to Shawn who felt very aroused and it stimulated Shawn nicely as well who was in no danger of his knot deflating as Shawn continued what he was doing.<br />
	The two began to doze off in a euphoria of pleasure, contentment, and other warm tingly feelings. They remained in that position for ten minutes when Shawn felt something odd. His mind niggled for a second about what it was and then it occurred to him his cock was feeling a lot more stimulated. It was as if the entire organ was being tickled and touched by a thick coat of fur. <br />
	Shawn opened his eyes, looked down at his own belly, and got another surprise that night. His belly was covered in a thick coat of creamy fur. Shawn was startled at this, which prompted Wally to open his eyes and look at his Buddy.<br />
	“You look different” were the first words out of the dog’s mouth<br />
	 “How different?” asked Shawn still a little flabbergasted and not even thinking about how his dog had again talked. &quot;Is it this fur that’s growing on me?”<br />
	“Yeah that’s it. The fur. It looks nice,” said Wally simply licking Shawn on the cheek. <br />
	“I have to see a mirror” said Shawn looking around more then a little panicked<br />
	“Mirror?” asked Wally unsure of what the word meant<br />
	“You know something that gives you a reflection.” Wally looked at him quizzically. Shawn sighed and said, “where you look at something and you see yourself”<br />
	“Oh that! That’s in the bathroom over there” said Shawn looking over to the door between the kitchen and the room they were in.<br />
	“Yes well I guess that is our best bet” said Shawn trying to rise and stopping as he felt a slightly painful pulling sensation in his buttocks. “Um would you mind removing yourself?” he asked Wally<br />
	Wally looked at him a second not comprehending and then it dawned on him” Oh, um I don’t thin I can” said Wally testing his sill well inflated knot.<br />
	“Wonderful” said Shawn a little peeved “Okay then lets try walking there together”<br />
	Needless to say, it took some doing just to stand up and get on the right footing. But they finally figured out a way entailing Shawn to twist around so his back was to Wally doing this, and moaning for the still very real pleasure of this stimulation, they rose and slowly hobbled their way to the Bathroom which would take a little time.<br />
	As they hobbled Shawn decided to ask Wally something that had been confusing him “Wally when the heck did you learn to speak” asked Shawn as they hobbled slowly so as to cause as little pain as possible.<br />
	Wally thought for a second and then said; “ You know I hadn’t thought about that but your right I have been speaking. I did not know I could do that. I guess I just could all of a sudden. Must have learned it from you.”<br />
	“Okay fine so how long have you been able to do this?” asked Shawn<br />
	“What?” asked Wally<br />
	“This changing forms business” grunted Shawn getting a little more pull then eh wanted to feel right now form a large step. <br />
	“Oh that” panted Wally “Um this is the first time I have ever done it why can others do it?”<br />
	“Not that I know of this is very strange,” said Shawn<br />
	“You’re telling me,” said Wally walking very carefully<br />
	“And it continues to get stranger” said Shawn<br />
	“Could be worse,” said Wally<br />
	“How exactly?” asked Shawn<br />
	“Bathroom could be upstairs instead its right here” said Wally as they reached the door<br />
	“I concede,” said Shawn smiling.<br />
	Opening the door the pair staggered into the bathroom and Shawn turned to the mirror, switched on the light, and got the third surprise of the night.<br />
	He looked at himself only it wasn’t him instead he was covered in a very thick pelt of fur alternating form browns, tans, blacks, and a creamy belly His face was covered in fur and you had to look very hard to see his original features expect for his beard which had grown thicker and blacker, if that was possible. His nose was the only part of his face not sporting fur and it had changed to a deep black color that look leathery and wet. His ears had moved to the top of his head and had drastically changed shape into pointed radar shaped triangles. His tongue felt slightly longer as well. His hands looked different too Shawn looked at them for the first time his fingers had swollen slightly and he had claw instead of finger nails on them and looking at his palms he discovered thick black calluses on his palm and on the tips of his fingers. <br />
	Wally was leaning his head over Shawn’s shoulder and looking at himself “Wow. I look pretty good” he said happily and then panted slightly “So do you buddy”<br />
	“Um” was all Shawn could say as he looked at himself then eh felt a pulling and cramping sensation around his buttocks. Wally leaned back as Shawn tried to get a view of behind himself. His back was similarly covered din fur a black cape covering his back and now that eh looked the pulling and cramping feeling was a tail. His tail. It was trapped between himself and Wally. He felt it twitch. <br />
	“Oh now this is neat” said Wally<br />
	Shawn looked at Wally and saw that Wally was picking up and dropping a toothbrush he had been so surprised by his changes he hadn't noticed the sounds of it clinking as it hit the floor.<br />
	“What its just a tooth brush” said Shawn<br />
	“Yeah but I could never pick it up without my mouth” said Wally holding it up and looking at it.<br />
	“That would be the wonders of the opposable thumb,” said Shawn<br />
	“Opposable thumb?” queried Wally<br />
	“This” said Shawn giving Wally a thumbs up “it gives humans the power to grasp things effectively it essentially is the basis for our ability to use tools and function properly.”<br />
	“And now I have one… neat! So does this mean I can open doors by myself?” asked Wally<br />
	“Basically” said Shawn “Though how you can fixate on a thumb while I’m turning into some sort of freak is beyond me:” said Shawn irritably<br />
	“Hey your not the only one in a weird position Shawn” said Wally angrily “You know I was quiet comfortable being a four legged dog and now I’m not anymore I happen to be changing too you might notice so forgive me for not seeing you as the center to my little universe anymore” <br />
	“Well if that’s the way you feel why not leave now” said Shawn feeling a slight tickle in his thought and realized he was growling slightly<br />
	“Well I would but we seem to be stuck together” said Wally<br />
	“And whose fault is that! You know I bet you that what we did is causing me to change too” said Shawn “Why the hell did you do this to me”<br />
	“Well how was I supposed to know?!?!? Damn it Shawn you are my best friend you raised me, loved me, fed me, and cared for me. Excuse me for wanting to return the favor some. You obviously wanted it I could smell it and I wanted it too. I thought hey why not share this moment with my best friend and help him out and just feel good for little bit. Obviously, that was a huge error. So you know what forgive me for loving you” said Wally crossing his arms and glaring at Shawn<br />
	Shawn looked at Wally for a second his tail twitched slightly and Shawn felt his ears almost plaster to his skull.<br />
	“Aw geeze Wally I’m sorry.” Said Shawn “I’m just freaked you know. What’s really sad is what you just said has got to be about the most sincerely romantic thing anyone ahs ever really said to me”<br />
	Wally looked at Shawn his arms dropped to his sides and he cocked his head “Really?”<br />
	“Yeah. Kinda sad aint it I never really got that form anyone else. I guess you can find love, however weird and surreal, in the oddest places” said Shawn<br />
	“Love you Buddy,” said Wally sweetly putting his arms around the now fur coated torso of Shawn<br />
	“Love you too Buddy” said Shawn smiling happily his tail twitch and wanting to wag. <br />
	Their face slowly came together, their black lips parted both now had thick rubbery lips, and they began to kiss. A heart melting warm kiss their tongues twisting and wrestling as they hugged each other tightly. Shawn felt a weird pulling of his face, opened his eyes, and watched as his muzzle fully formed. Breaking the kiss, he turned his attention back to the mirror.<br />
	There stood two German shepherd dog men. They did not look alike but they were the same breed. Wally panted slightly and Shawn felt the urge to do so as well. <br />
	Shawn had retained his beard but the hair on top of his head had receded into the fur and become the skullcap of black fur that finished the cap of black fur on his body. He lifted his paw like hand to his face and his beard felt like dog fur. Wally looked more clean-shaven with a tan snout and a less visible black cape and skullcap pattern.<br />
	“I hate to say this buddy but you look great,” said Wally hugging him.<br />
	“You know I think your right I look very, for lack of a better word, cute.” Said Shawn. Looking at his face<br />
	“And what’s the mater with cute? You call me that all the time,” said Wally with in a jocular tone.<br />
	“Well that’s different,” said Shawn<br />
	“How” asked Wally in a dangerous tone<br />
	“You are cute,” said Shawn turning his snout and licking Wally on the nose.<br />
	“Sweet talker” said Wally hugging his fellow dog tightly. He gave a testing pull and then said, “hey I think we can pull apart now” <br />
	“Good I was getting a cramp,” said Shawn, as they pulled apart. “Common lets eat something I’m hungry changing sex and changing species takes a lot out of a guy “said Shawn moving into the kitchen.<br />
	Wally remembered something he had hear d previous mate of Shawn say and deiced it would be fun to say it “Always the same with you men sex then eat no pillow talk”<br />
	“Considering we were tied like that for over half an hour I think we had plenty of pillow talk Buddy” said Shawn. “And where did you ever learn about Pillow talk?”<br />
	“Um nowhere I don’t actually know what it is,” said Wally slightly embarrassed his ears went down and he shuffle slightly. Shawn smiled at him. <br />
	“Basically its talking after sex” said Shawn<br />
	“Oh well yeah you’re right we did do that” said Wally<br />
	Shawn poured a glass of water for himself and after struggling for a few moments to put it to his lips to drink it, and getting his fur coat more then a little wet, he turned to Wally<br />
	“And um how am I supposed to drink?” asked Shawn in a perturbed voice<br />
	“I think you call it a bowl” said Wally picking up his own water dish and lapping at it.<br />
	“Joy” said Shawn taking out a soup bowl he had and pouring more water into it. After a few minuets of experimentation, he got the hang of lapping water up.<br />
	Wally started snuffling his large doggy nostrils flaring a bit “mmm. You know you smell very nice now your scent has changed a little bit”<br />
	Shawn looked at Wally second water dripping from his snout “Uh. I do?”<br />
	“Yeah like a bit of bacon, some weird powder you put in that black thing in your belt, trees, and a hint of something I can’t quiet put my finger on” said Wally looking at Shawn dreamily.<br />
	Shawn took a few experimental sniffs with his new snout and then took a couple deep breaths amaze at the array of smells assaulting his sense it was more the little daunting. “Woah.”<br />
	“What?” asked Wally<br />
	“I never was able to smell like this before. It is very weird,” said Shawn<br />
	“Well I never saw everything so vibrant before that is weird too normally everythings a lot more muted looking” said Wally<br />
	“Hmm I guess you have a human’s color vision and I got your doggy sense of smell,” said Shawn. He walked over to Wally and cuddled against him taking a few deep sniffs. “You know you smell pretty nice as well”<br />
	“Thanks”<br />
	“Come on” said Shawn taking Wally’s hand and dragging him to the stair sot the second floor in which lay the bedroom and guest room along with the real bathroom with a shower.<br />
	“What? Where are we going?” asked Wally<br />
	“I want to return the favor,” said Shawn turning around and rubbing himself against Wally in a tight highly suggestive hug in which Wally felt his Buddy’s arousal.<br />
	“Really? Yeah I would like to do that too” said Wally happily wagging his big bushy tail<br />
	“Well come on” said Shawn walking up the stairs. Wally immediately followed and soon they walked paw in paw next to each other up the stairs.</p>
