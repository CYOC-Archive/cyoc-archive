<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The morning meetings and updates were their normal hectic things, but Samantha felt greatly relieved that for the most part the massive sudden surprises that had happened the previous day had not happened so far today. Of course there was the warning that Dieter Wilhelm would be bringing a third agent with him raised concerns, but that was only a possibility. The agent they had in custody who was cooperating with them hadn&#39;t made any mention of a third agent being hired or being sent and the warning had only come thanks to what would amount to a &quot;prophecy dream&quot; on Jennifer Harper&#39;s part. It might be helpful as a warning, but it wasn&#39;t exact. Especially when one considered that &quot;prophecy dreams&quot; at times tended to be vague and hard to prove. <br />
<br />
Regardless, though, Chief O&#39;Hara felt confident that neither Dieter nor his agent could smuggle a gun into the church. The metal detector that had been installed as a security measure would detect any metal trying to enter the building, and even if a firearm was made with heavy duty plastics, it would have to include SOME metal in it in order keep the weapon functional and avoid the risks of the weapon&#39;s use damaging the weapon itself. If loaded, the bullets themselves would also set off the metal detector, as the brass casings were metallic. The only real wild card in terms of dealing with Dieter Wilhelm is that they had no idea on what he would do. He could very well notice the metal detector before entering and could decide to lay siege to the church, thinking that the town was against him, which it was, or he could simply panic and start a fight once he was caught. The town could prepare and be ready for those things, and that&#39;d help, but that didn&#39;t mean that things would truly be calm. That wouldn&#39;t happen until the wedding was over, Wilhelm was in jail awaiting trial, and the Harpers either reconciled with their daughter or left Moon Lake completely.<br />
<br />
However, the Harper/Jenkins wedding was only ONE of the issues on Samantha&#39;s plate as Moon Lake&#39;s Town Chancellor. As she collected her lunch from her office and moved for the break room, which amounted to a lunch room for the city staff, Samantha also thought over the other issues she&#39;d have to deal with. While Moon Lake would also have to deal with the issue relating to Professor Harold Jenkins becoming a weretiger, by now that issue had gone beyond her purview. Harold Jenkins was now his family&#39;s were and Moon Lake&#39;s secret would be safe. Getting justice for his clawing or determining if justice was even required would fall to the Moon Lake Police Department and there was nothing more that Samantha could do there. There was, however, one other major issue that would fall to her and that related to the FBI Agent Teddy Green. He had recently been in Moon Lake investigating the background of a wererat named Lionel Ulysses, when Chief O&#39;Hara had caught the residual scent of a werecat on him and the agent ultimately explained that he was married to a werecat, but hadn&#39;t been able to find a were that would turn him or could turn him in order to be with his wife in every possible way. That was turned over to Samantha and the agent had explained his situation to her.<br />
<br />
That situation was atypical for Samantha, as normally her job revolved around welcoming new residents to Moon Lake and helping them with their welcome into were society and helping the family adjust to the differences Moon Lake had with the rest of the country. In some cases only one member of the family joined were society, as had been the case with Henry &quot;Huck&quot; Jenkins Jr. becoming the family were, while in others the entire family eventually joined as had been the case with the Andersons. Assisting a person who likely wouldn&#39;t be living in Moon Lake for the immediate future wasn&#39;t typical, but if what Teddy Green had said was true and that he was married to a werecat, he couldn&#39;t mate with her as her specific strain of the were-virus would kill him as he was male and werecats could only transform women. Thus, Samantha had her job to help him so he could be with his wife, and if he was trying to set some elaborate sting operation, Samantha felt confident that given his choice of &quot;weretiger&quot; to become that unless he brought an army of FBI agents, that sting wouldn&#39;t work. However, the situation had its own complications that Samantha would have to sort out.<br />
<br />
As she entered that break room and placed the plastic container that held her lunch, Samantha was quick to pull out her cellphone and dialed a number she knew by heart. The answer was quick and gave her the voice she loved to hear, even when the situation was rough.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, Sam, what&#39;s up?&quot; came Frances&#39;s voice over the line.<br />
<br />
Samantha didn&#39;t respond to the name. She generally preferred the full name &quot;Samantha,&quot; but when it came to Frances, she&#39;d allow her wife and mate to call her Sam. She merely went about her reason for her call, even as she pressed the buttons on the microwave to warm up her lunch.<br />
<br />
&quot;Outside of lunch, nothing much,&quot; Samantha answered, &quot;or at least nothing much at the moment.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Rough meeting?&quot; Frances asked, detecting some sign of stress even through phone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh... the meeting went fairly well and your warning was appreciated,&quot; Samantha replied, &quot;I think we&#39;ll be ready in that regard.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, that&#39;s good,&quot; Frances answered, &quot;but there is something stressing you. I can tell.&quot;<br />
<br />
And Samantha did know that. Even without her training as a psychologist and psychiatrist, Frances would know more than enough about Samantha to know what stressed her. The two having a happy marriage to each other did that.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s not so much stress as it is nervousness,&quot; Samantha answered, &quot;as it relates to the situation with Teddy Green...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh...&quot; Frances answered, &quot;Did he agree to help with our Dieter Wilhelm situation?&quot;<br />
<br />
By now, the microwave had finished cooking Samantha&#39;s lunch. It wasn&#39;t much than a pre-made healthy choice type meal, but it was something Samantha could have ready quickly and was obviously healthy. With the meal cooked, she carefully pulled it from the microwave while holding her cellphone to her shoulder with her head. It might look odd and uncomfortable, but it worked in the end. She sat down and answered her wife&#39;s question.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... on that front, he may be best saved as a last resort,&quot; Samantha spoke carefully, &quot;as Chief O&#39;Hara and the DA feel that unless the FBI already have reason to investigate Wilhelm... there is no express need to bring them in, which would help keep Moon Lake&#39;s secrets.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Understandable,&quot; Frances commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;The other issue may end up being issues related to Lionel Ulysses&#39; murderer... but again, Chief O&#39;Hara is monitoring that situation,&quot; Samantha spoke, &quot;My only &quot;place&quot; on that case is making sure we don&#39;t end up with a fight on our hands that exposes weres everywhere should things go south.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Understandable,&quot; Frances said again, &quot;Though... BOTH situations could probably stand to have Agent Green&#39;s help in that he helped keep Ulysses&#39; capture seem less of an issue. We&#39;d need someone with his influence if we need it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I understand that,&quot; Samantha sighed as she sat down and brought up one hand to hold her phone and take a more comfortable position, &quot;but a lot of that is going to be something best handled delicately and after he&#39;s joined were society...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And how&#39;s that coming?&quot; Frances asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... on the plus side I did find someone who would be willing to transform him,&quot; Samantha answered.<br />
<br />
Samantha calmly stuck her fork into her lunch and was soon chewing as she waited for her wife to answer, as knew what she&#39;d agreed to might not go over well with Frances. It might not go over well with Ben, either, but Ben could easily spend the night with Kendra if need be. Samantha and Frances couldn&#39;t do that easily. A part of her mind drifted to visiting with Martha, but while William may have improved his behavior since his transformation was completed, that didn&#39;t mean that Samantha or Frances were suddenly bisexual the way Martha was.<br />
<br />
&quot;That sounds like there is a &quot;bad&quot; part,&quot; Frances said with a very questioning tone in her voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... the Greens favor a weretiger as their choice,&quot; Samantha spoke, &quot;and for the moment the only one wanting to transform an FBI agent is Lila Carpenter... and she doesn&#39;t live on her own, which means they can&#39;t go to her for transformation and she isn&#39;t too keen on hotels.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... that stereotype about cheep motels doesn&#39;t sound good,&quot; Frances answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes... but it&#39;ll mean we need to host both Lila and the Greens in order for Teddy&#39;s transformation,&quot; Samantha said slowly, &quot;and that isn&#39;t the end of it...&quot;<br />
<br />
There was a pause for a moment. Eventually Frances did speak.<br />
<br />
&quot;The end...?&quot; Frances asked slowly, &quot;Hun, I&#39;m fine with having Lila doing the transformation at our home. We have the guest room for it and Ben can always go to Kenya&#39;s if he doesn&#39;t feel comfortable with it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The issue is that apparently whoever was controlling the flight for the Greens between Washington and Seattle got things messed up,&quot; Samantha spoke, &quot;They fly in today and should be here by this evening.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So we&#39;re doing Teddy&#39;s transformation tonight?&quot; Frances asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Samantha said weakly, &quot;I know it&#39;s a surprise and with little preparation...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ll be fine,&quot; Frances assured her, &quot;Maybe this will help as that you can talk to Teddy directly on whether or not he can help directly should the situation require it. We can even meet to make sure the house is ready later this afternoon and be ready to inform Ben when he gets home from school.&quot;<br />
<br />
That was ultimately a sign of relief to Samantha who sighed at the comment, &quot;Thanks.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just remember, you owe me one,&quot; Frances replied.</p>
