<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Roy glanced up and down the hallway, but sadly saw nobody he could swap with. He was about to give up and try to deal with being Sarah for a bit longer when he spotted someone turn the corner. It was the middle aged lady that lived down the hall from them. She and her husband lived happily with their three children. <br />
<br />
She was a hot, MILF beauty of a woman. Her figure clearly showed some of her age as she was getting to be a little frumpier but her figure was still stunning along with her breasts, likely due to their newest child still breast feeding. Her brunette, curly hair was past her shoulders and styled way beyond what was needed. She wore a long red dress, and didn&#39;t appear to be wearing any bra underneath most likely for breast feeding. Her feet clacked along in high heels and makeup was drenched across her face. In front of her was a small, pink stroller with an adorable little girl sucking at her thumb sitting inside it.<br />
<br />
Roy cringed at the idea of swapping life roles with either one of them. He figured he could use the mother&#39;s life to leave the apartment easier, but he could do that as Sarah too. Just as he was thinking of just leaving as Sarah, however, a call from Jack&#39;s room made him choose very quickly.<br />
&quot;Hey babe!&quot; Jack called, still in his room. &quot;Roy&#39;s at work, sooo... after breakfast, you wanna get frisky?&quot; He asked with a growl in his voice.<br />
<br />
Any thought of Jack trying to hit on him immediately decided for Roy. He turned back at the hall as the mother was about to walk up to the elevator and selected himself, and then quickly tried to select the woman. Unfortunately, Roy&#39;s aim was off just enough so that the device selected the baby girl. Roy noticed and tried to do something but he barely had enough time to process his mistake before he found himself sitting down.<br />
<br />
Roy looked down in horror to see that he was strapped into a giant baby stroller. Judging by the elevator door he was staring at, he was still the same size, but the stroller had somehow warped to fit his adult body. Not only that, but he was wearing baby clothes. He was wearing a small purple dress, and a thick, pink and white diaper that he could clearly feel underneath pressed against his dick. His entire body had lost all hair other than his eyebrows and the little bits of whips he had on his head. He found one of his hands holding the device while the other was in his mouth. He pulled it out in disgust and sighed.<br />
<br />
Looking back towards his apartment, he saw an even stranger sight. The baby was standing in the doorway, looking back and forth down the hall, seemingly confused as to why she was standing there. Except, of course, the most obvious thing of note was how she was dressed. She wore Sarah&#39;s light blue, long-sleeved blouse with a blue sweater on over it, along with a black, professional looking women&#39;s slacks, some dark nylon socks, and a pair of sensible, brown shoes with a slight wedge heel to them. All of this, however, was resized and refitted to fit the body of a one year old child. The baby who now believed she was Sarah fixed her glasses, scratched her now much longer hair, gave a slight shrug, and then shut the door. <br />
<br />
&quot;Dammit.&quot; Roy thought, feeling his face go beet red with embarrassment. &quot;I can&#39;t believe I messed up this badly. Well, I guess it doesn&#39;t matter all that much. I&#39;ll just swap with this lady and then swap myself back with Sarah... easy peasy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, before Roy even had the chance to try and aim the device, the woman walked around the large stroller and snatched the device! Roy tried to yell at her to give it back, but all that came out were gurgles.<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh, Susie sweetie, where&#39;d you get something like this?&quot; She asked chuckling. &quot;This looks like one of Daddy&#39;s tools.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ba, bagaba!&quot; Roy desperately yelled. He tried to explain that he wasn&#39;t her daughter but in her life, but he could only talk like a baby.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes I know! You&#39;re a naughty cutie aren&#39;t you? Yes you are Susie!&quot; She laughed at Roy while speaking in a baby friendly tone. &quot;Well Mommy daughter walk is gonna have to wait. We have to bring this back to daddy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Roy sat in horror as the woman walked behind the stroller with the device, turned the stroller around, and began to push them back towards the apartment. Roy tried to unbuckle himself from the stroller but it was no use. He was forced to fit that life&#39;s role, which meant that he didn&#39;t have the manual dexterity to undo a buckle. He silently cursed himself knowing that he could have easily avoided this if he had been more careful.<br />
<br />
She rolled the stroller up to the door, and while she fumbled with her keys Roy gave a last ditch stretch to try and reach the device, only to fail as the woman opened the door and stepped out of reach. She walked back quickly to wheel Roy in and then shut the door. Roy looked around and was amazed at how lovely their apartment was. They lived in the larger rooms area of the building, so he knew they had a nice place, but not this nice.<br />
<br />
It was a perfectly furnished living room looking area with multiple hallways that lead to double the amount of rooms Roy and Jack had access to. It was perfectly clean with rugs, chairs, a dining room table, an actual more distinguished kitchen, and even paintings! Roy gawked until his &quot;mother&quot; beat down to unbuckle him. He tried to push her back but found that despite his body, he essentially had the strength of an infant. Even more surprising was when Roy found himself lifted into the air.<br />
<br />
Somehow, the device had rewritten reality enough so that this woman was capable of lifting a fully grown man! Her body looked the same, and yet Roy was slung over this woman&#39;s shoulder like an actual baby with no effort whatsoever. Once he was over her shoulder, he spotted to more girls sitting at the dining room table. <br />
<br />
There was a (definitely fake) blonde haired girl with too much makeup and skimpy looking clothing texting away on her cell phone. Next to her was a younger looking girl with curly brown hair and a cute dress playing with a barbie doll. They both looked up, each looking confused. Roy felt his face turn even redder as he panicked, wondering if they could see him for how he truly was.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom? Like, what&#39;re you doing back? I thought you took Susie for a walk?&quot; The teenager asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I was going to Brittney but then I noticed that Susie had taken this.&quot; She replied placing the device on the table.<br />
<br />
&quot;What is it?&quot; The younger kid asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think it&#39;s one of Daddy&#39;s tools, so no touching Liz.&quot; She scolded. &quot;Now, where&#39; your father?&quot; She asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think he&#39;s just getting out of the shower.&quot; Brittney responded without looking up from her phone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Honey?!&quot; The woman called loudly next to Roy&#39;s ear. &quot;Phil are you there?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi Anna!&quot; He called back. &quot;Hold on just a moment!&quot; He yelled back.<br />
<br />
Roy was emotionally fine, but the yelling would have started a baby, so Roy found himself tearing up.<br />
&quot;Oh god, my whole body is betraying me!&quot; He thought as he began to cry.<br />
<br />
&quot;No! Shhh shhh. It&#39;s okay Susie poo!&quot; Anna comforted her &quot;child.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s the matter with her mommy?&quot; Liz asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, your sister is fine Lizzie. She&#39;s probably just hungry.&quot; Anna responded.<br />
<br />
Roy found himself lowered slightly, and starred with his teary eyes wide open as Anna pulled down her dress to reveal a massive, milk filled tit. Roy felt emotions ranging from fear to arousal and shock as his mouth was plunged over her nipple. He tried to resist but suddenly found himself instinctively suckling. He suckled and suckled as the warm milk cascaded down his throat. It was the best damned milk he had ever tasted!<br />
<br />
He closed his eyes, grabbed the boob, and continued to suckle. His mind was lost in a fog before he forced himself to snap out of it. As crazy as everything was, he needed to focus right now. If the device was lost, he&#39;d be stuck is Susie&#39;s life forever. He opened his eyes and saw that he was directly staring at the device which was sitting on the table. Brittney was probably scrolling through instagram while Liz played with her doll. <br />
&quot;This is my chance.&quot; He thought. &quot;As long as I don&#39;t alert any of them, I can grab the device, swap with Phil, and get the hell out of here.&quot;<br />
<br />
He made sure one last time that all three girls were distracted, and Roy carefully moved his arm towards the device. </p>
