<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Later you had already told your story about your transformation, and how Grawnad even though responsible had given you the chance to help others in ways you haven&#39;t before. &quot;Wow, this Grawnad guy he&#39;s really debatable in my book. He kidnaps people, and changes them into creatures in his dungeon, not to mention changing gender. However....as you said he sounds nice overall, and without you I would be....&quot; Scarlet said <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, he changed my life, not exactly in a good way, but not a bad one either. He also takes care of the creatures here, and let&#39;s you choose your path after the transformation.&quot; You said <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m still split, but he seems nice...I guess these kids though, and why I got into that situation. I wouldn&#39;t be in this dungeon, nor would have I been pregnant if it wasn&#39;t for him.&quot; Scarlet said <br />
<br />
&quot;Not true, the thing that made you pregnant was another creature here, and Grawnad gives us free will to do as we please here. If anything it was just the creature who did this to you, or you did something to make the creature do this to you.&quot; You said <br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s also something to consider I guess, also thanks for letting me stay here.&quot; Scarlet said <br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t mention it, your nice, and I really like you actually.&quot; You said, as a light appeared, and Grawnad came from it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello there I forgot to give you a water source, my sincere apologies.&quot; Grawnad said snapping his finger, and a pond appeared with a waterfall draining water into it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Who&#39;s the mother in your cave, I don&#39;t believe I&#39;ve seen her here before?&quot; Grawnad said <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yeah, this is Scarlet, she was a male human who got cursed to have the lower half of a vixen, and was pregnant. So in response I told her the situation, and she had me completely transform her into a vixen. We were wondering if you could make a room for her, and her newborn pups.&quot; You said <br />
<br />
&quot;Certainly, I always like new additions, I assume you prefer a close spot so here you go.&quot; Grawnad said snapping his fingers, and a new passage appeared leading off into a room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your rooms are quite close, and hers only leads into yours Ember, and I already put in a cave, and pond as well. Now if you don&#39;t mind I would like to be acquainted with the new mother here.&quot; Grawnad said walking over.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ember was telling me about you, but I personally couldn&#39;t judge until we met in person. Anyways I&#39;m Scarlet, and these are my pups, I haven&#39;t been able to name them yet.&quot; Scarlet said, as Grawnad approached her.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s fine that my presence is known to all here, especially you. I assume Ember also tod you about my process of adding on new creatures here too.&quot; Grawnad said <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, but I don&#39;t really agree with it, but she also said you made up for that with niceness.&quot; Scarlet said <br />
<br />
&quot;She did, did she?&quot; Grawnad said giving you a look making you blush slightly, and then turned back towards Scarlet,&quot;Well consider this, policy states that capturing humans every so often, in one week intervals, and transforming them into creatures. I take humans turn them into creatures, and offer them freedom outside the dungeon, or to remain inside so they aren&#39;t slave in a sense. Also consider that there are others like me who don&#39;t care for creatures, and don&#39;t maintain dungeons. Considering the creatures were once humans then they get desperate for food, and water. Most I heard of find water, but are so desperate they kill, a d devour humans hense the olf folktale about the knight, princess, and dragon. So you see I have to abide by laws to capture new creatures, and give them magic, but I also know they were human like myself, and take care of them as such by providing water, and food if needed.&quot; Grawnad explained.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow, I never really saw it like that before.&quot; Scarlet said <br />
<br />
&quot;Do either of you need food, both of your bodies are able to digest raw meat, if not I could cook, and heat it to your likings.&quot; Grawnad said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I never had raw meat before, I suppose I could just use my fire if I don&#39;t like it, same with yours Scarlet.&quot; You said <br />
<br />
&quot;Right,&quot; Scarlet said <br />
<br />
&quot;I understand the children are newborns, but can you walk to your room with them?&quot; Grawnad asked<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll try,&quot; Scarlet said standing up, and walking outside the cave. The newborns were barely able to walk for far before falling on their stomachs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Guess not it&#39;s fine, just gather them up. I would, but they&#39;re your kids, and I wouldn&#39;t want to mess up their scent with mine.&quot; You said <br />
<br />
&quot;Another thing to mention is that none of the creatures here age, and I ask you to let me apply that to you. Your pups will have it applied when they are at their prime. Actually I put a kind of magic lock on Ember so she will age until her prime then stop.&quot; Grawnad said <br />
<br />
&quot;Wait you aren&#39;t at your prime yet? How old are you?&quot; Scarlet asked<br />
<br />
&quot;16, and it&#39;s also worth mentioning that every creature here was a human of the opposite gender, which means I was male.&quot; You said <br />
<br />
&quot;Well that&#39;s an interesting thing to process.&quot; Scarlet said <br />
<br />
&quot;One more thing before I give your food to Ember, because of the pups. Do you want a mate, they of course will probably be new, and unfamiliar with their body. I will also explain to them about your &#39;situation&#39; it&#39;s something that is needed to know.&quot; Grawnad said,&quot;This goes for you too Ember.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Give me time, I already have some who gave birth in my cave, and I don&#39;t want to do that just yet.&quot; You said <br />
<br />
&quot;I wouldn&#39;t mind having a male fox around, I mean my children need a father figure.&quot; Scarlet said <br />
<br />
&quot;Good, give me about 6 days. Also fun fact Ember was my most recent addition here, so you must have plenty in common, due to your lack of body knowledge.&quot; Grawnad said, and disappeared, and when he did you suddenly were holding two steak sized slabs of meat.<br />
<br />
&quot;Here, I suggest you stand up eating this.&quot; You said giving Scarlet a slab of meat <br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks, and not just for the food, but you set me up on a new life, and I think I&#39;ll enjoy it. So you&#39;re considering having a mate?&quot; Scarlet said before taking a small bite out of the meat.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well yeah, it&#39;s just I saw you, and in a way I want to have kids too. That look in your eyes, I just want to hold off until you moved to your room to make a decision, I&#39;ve only been female for a day. Also please visit as much as you like.&quot; You said <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll try to leave whenever my children are able to walk there, and if not a week I could always get help from my mate, or future mate.&quot; Scarlet said</p>
