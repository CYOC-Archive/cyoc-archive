<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Adam&#39;s head was still reeling, partially because he was still a little woozy from that blow to the head. But he was still having a little trouble believing that one of the two alligator creatures in the pen was Mary Lou, now standing on two legs and talking. It was even harder to wrap his head around the fact that the other one was Evelyn, transformed into a near-identical copy of what Mary Lou was now. Still, the creature&#39;s voice did sound like Evelyn&#39;s even if it was deeper and those eyes looked so familiar to Adam. There were tears coming from those eyes which tugged at Adam&#39;s heartstrings. He ought to be more cautious about crocodile tears, well, alligator tears, but she sounded too emotional to be faking it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Evelyn, I&#39;m sorry,&quot; said Adam, &quot;I didn&#39;t recognize you, either of you. You&#39;re just, well, uh...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re monsters,&quot; sobbed Evelyn only for Mary Lou to pat her shoulder.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, we&#39;re just gator girls. It doesn&#39;t matter what he thinks of us,&quot; said Mary Lou in a gentle tone. Adam was rather amazed by Mary Lou&#39;s comforting. The big gator had always been rather ornery and mean-tempered before...whatever happened here. It looked like some of Evelyn rubbed off on her in more ways than one.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t think you&#39;re monsters,&quot; said Adam, &quot;I&#39;m just, well, surprised. It&#39;s not everyday you see, uh, gator girls.&quot;<br />
<br />
Evelyn sniffed and said, &quot;But I&#39;m hideous now.&quot; Adam wasn&#39;t able to think of anything sincerely reassuring. Evelyn barely looked human right now. Yes, she was able to stand on her digitigrade legs and she still had arms, but she looked more gator than human. Her hands were stumpy compared to what they were before, mostly looking like a crocodile paw with a thumb and her body&#39;s vaguely hourglass shape was the strongest indication she was female at all. But as far as biped reptiles could go, Evelyn could have been much uglier.<br />
<br />
&quot;Evelyn, you&#39;re not as hideous as you think. You&#39;re bizarre, but not monstrous. If you&#39;re ok with your appearance, than so am I. Though if you want to find a way to change back, I&#39;ll be happy to help if I- Oof!&quot; said Adam, the last part was when Evelyn nearly knocked him over in a hug. She nearly knocked all the wind of him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, thank you, Adam. I was so worried you&#39;d reject me,&quot; sobbed Evelyn, though she sounded like she was happy more than sad.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d never leave you like that,&quot; said Adam as he got his arms around Evelyn. Her scales were pretty rough on her back and he felt something squelching between his fingers. &quot;Uh, what is this?&quot; he asked, pulling his hand back to show a handful of suds.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, that&#39;s from the shampoo,&quot; said Evelyn, releasing her grip on Adam, &quot;It&#39;s what changed us, I think. We were trying to use it to change back but it didn&#39;t work.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, all it did was get me all wet and soapy,&quot; said Mary Lou as she wiped some off her hide. She looked at the suds and a mischievous thought entered her mind. &quot;It smells nice though, why don&#39;t you have a little?&quot; she said before bring her hand on top of Adam&#39;s head and rubbing the shampoo in.<br />
<br />
Adam spluttered in surprise which made Evelyn giggle. &quot;You do need to wash up a little,&quot; said Evelyn before she took some suds off her own hide and rubbed into Adam&#39;s scalp. The gator girls laughed as they lathered up the human&#39;s hair.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ow, girls, stop it! Ow, your hands are too rough! Ouch, you&#39;re scratching up my skin. Ah, it got in my eye!&quot; yelped Adam as he got himself away from them and tried to rub the soap out of his eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, that was fun, now how about-&quot; started Mary Lou before she and Evelyn felt a tingle. They looked at Adam and noticed that his arms were started to change color and texture. They looked at their own arms and saw they were starting to change shape. Their rough scales were starting to smooth out as their muscles got less bulky. Their paw-like hands were becoming slimmer and more dainty like a human woman&#39;s.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course, it didn&#39;t work before because we were the same species. But now Adam&#39;s more human and...&quot; said Evelyn before looking back at her boyfriend. The changes were becoming a lot more noticeable now. His sudsy hair was starting to shrink back into his scalp. His face was distorting as his mouth started pushing out. His nose stretched before flattening against the protruding mouth as a reptilian snout started forming. His skin was already covered in large green patches that were covering up his body. His hands clenched as webbing appeared between the fingers and his fingernails became claws.<br />
<br />
Adam was still trying to rub out the soap in his eyes which made Evelyn worry he&#39;d accidentally scratch his own eyes out with his new claws. &quot;Adam, don&#39;t move, I&#39;ll be right back,&quot; said Evelyn before heading over to the faucet. She turned the water on and cupped some of it between her hands. The webbing between her fingers actually made for an effective cup. She hurried back to Adam and splashed the water in his changing face. Once the shampoo was gone, she looked for something to dry him with. A rip soon caught her attention and she looked down at Adam&#39;s body. He was still changing, getting larger and more muscular than before. His shirt had just been shredded apart by his muscle growth so Evelyn just grabbed it and ripped all the way off. She took a moment to admire Adam&#39;s hardening physique before applying the rag to Adam&#39;s eyes.<br />
<br />
Adam gave a sigh and said, &quot;Thanks Evelyn.&quot; When he could look again, he was surprised by what he saw. Evelyn had shrunk or perhaps he had grown. She no longer towered over him but was only a few inches taller and was getting shorter. Her face also wasn&#39;t as bestial as it was before, her snout now smaller and more flexible and her eyes didn&#39;t seem as reptilian as it was before. He looked down and saw that her body had been changing more than just that. Her legs had gotten substantially longer so that she didn&#39;t have to drag her slightly shorter tail on the ground. They were also regaining the shapeliness she had when she was human. In fact, all of her body shape was looking more human than it did before.<br />
<br />
Mary Lou watched the transformations with interest. Adam had been a pathetic monkey man to her before, but now he was looking a lot easier on the reptilian eye. His ill-fitting shorts had ripped apart to allow his growing tail to form. His boots had already been punctured by his new claws popping through them and they were tearing even more as his feet adjusted to digitigrade stance. Evelyn&#39;s change also fascinated Mary Lou, mainly because the same thing was happening to her. She was feeling disappointed that her strong massive body was being reduced to something weaker and smaller. She felt a tingle in her chest and she looked down as they started to puff out. &quot;Oh, come on, do I really need these?&quot; she asked, her voice sounding less guttural than before. Despite her wishes, her chest continued to swell out as it filled with mammary tissue. Two distinctive globes formed up on her chest, the tops of them tickling like crazy before a pair of nipples appeared. &quot;Great, I&#39;m a reptile with breasts,&quot; said Mary Lou sarcastically as she squeezed her new additions. She gave a slight jump as a jolt of pleasure went through her. That wasn&#39;t so bad. Maybe the mammals were onto something here.<br />
<br />
Evelyn helped Adam tear off the last of his clothing, which was pretty redundant now as he was covered in scales now. However, they weren&#39;t the hard rough scales she had before. It was a lot smoother, more like leather. He still had the ridges along his pines, but they weren&#39;t so hard and rough. The same thing applied to her now and she was a lot happier about it. She was also pleased that she got her girls back.<br />
<br />
Soon the transformations stopped and the trio took a good look at themselves. Before, Mary Lou and Evelyn looked a lot more alligator than human, probably because Mary Lou had so much more mass than Evelyn did. But now Mary Lou&#39;s reptilian mass was spread evenly among them and Adam&#39;s addition made them more balanced blend of human and alligator. Evelyn and Mary Lou really were gator girls now, with anthro bodies that had plenty of feminine features. Though Mary Lou still had more muscle build than Evelyn, she was more of an amazon in build. Adam was a gator guy, standing at 7 feet tall which was a foot taller than the girls. His body was sculpted muscle covered in green leather, something that appealed to both Mary Lou and Evelyn. Adam himself was enjoying the sight of two females in front of him.</p>
