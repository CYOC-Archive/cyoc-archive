<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“I’m telling you man, the plan’s gonna work!”<br />
<br />
Theo and Manny were sitting in their dorm room, eagerly leaning over a box of Yummies’ Perfectionery. The room was cluttered with superhero memorabilia; posters, comic books, stuffed animals. A replica of Thor’s hammer hung over Theo’s bed, while a poster of Captain America flexing a bicep in his tight uniform and winking was beside Manny’s. The room was mostly dark except at their desks where their lamps faintly illuminated their scrawny faces.<br />
<br />
Both of these boys had skinny frames, hunched forwards from endless hours of gaming. While Theo looked like a stereotypical nerd, with huge glasses and combed hair, Manny could’ve gotten away with it if he tried. His curly black hair was cozily nestled on top of his small head, just above his bright blue eyes. His sleepwear of a Captain America T-shirt and shorts looked much more comfortable than Theo’s perfectly kempt matching pyjamas with a bold checkered pattern and his initial embroidered on the shirt’s top-left pocket.<br />
<br />
“What does this stuff even do?” asked Manny as Theo opened the box of Perfectionery. Inside were countless small packets that seemed to glow orange and violet.<br />
<br />
“Ugh, Manny, did you read the forum posts I sent you?” asked Theo in a huff.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, but they didn’t really explain much, or how it’ll help us tonight,” said Manny.<br />
<br />
Theo sighed and stared at his dorm-mate. His thin, beady eyes hid behind the thick frames of his glasses and he scowled before returning his attention back to the Perfectionery.<br />
<br />
“It’s our last year at college. Our last chance to go to Zach’s Halloween Bash.”<br />
<br />
Zachariah Theramont was the head of Zeta Epsilon Chi; the biggest and most influential frat party on-campus. Their parties were the biggest, boldest, and were often the only thing people talked about, and his Halloween Bash was the biggest of them all, but was also the most exclusive.<br />
<br />
“And you know, they won’t let us in to those parties unless we look the part,” continued Theo, “well, with these we’ll definitely look the part!”<br />
<br />
He snickered as he pulled out a packet and observed it’s contents as if he were a cat staring at a freshly-caught mouse. He licked his upper lip. Manny looked perplexed.<br />
<br />
“So what, we take some of those, and we turn into jocks?” Manny asked, not believing a word of it.<br />
<br />
“Better!” said Theo, “the forum posts said if we take some of these, we’ll become the person we most want to look like. And well…” <br />
<br />
He gestured at his side of the room and it’s many pieces of Thor merchandise, and then at Manny’s side, particularly the risqué poster of Captain America.<br />
<br />
“The plan’s simple. We take these, become Thor and Captain America, and go out partying. If we looked as big and buff as superheroes they’d HAVE to let us in! Then we’ll party all night, meet a girl or two, who knows!”<br />
<br />
“Sight problem with that,” said Manny. He had his phone out and was finally reading the forum posts, “we won’t just have their bodies. We’d have everything. Their faces, their voices, their accents.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, so?” asked Theo.<br />
<br />
“So, well, won’t people at the party recognise us. Won’t they go ‘hey there’s Chris Evans and Chris Hemsworth’ or some shit?”<br />
<br />
“Aha! I’ve thought ahead!” squealed Theo excitedly as he rushed under his bed and pulled out two boxes. He lifted one up to reveal a large Captain America costume. Manny’s eyes widened. The costume included a perfect replica of the super soldier’s helmet, which covered most of the face.<br />
<br />
“Oh damn! How much did that set you back?” he asked.<br />
<br />
“It doesn’t matter,” said Theo, “once we change, we’ll put these on to hide our faces. What’s a Halloween Bash without a good costume, right? I’ve got mine in the other box.”<br />
<br />
Manny looked over and saw Thor’s helmet shine in the desklight.<br />
<br />
“Okay,” said Manny, a huge grin sliding across his face, “let’s do it.”<br />
<br />
“Excellent!”<br />
<br />
They ripped the packet of Perfectionery open and grabbed a handful each, throwing the candy into their mouths. They chewed and swallowed with buzzing anticipation. And then, they waited.<br />
<br />
And waited.<br />
<br />
“How long does it take to kick in?” asked Manny.<br />
<br />
“I dunno. The posts didn’t say,” said Theo.<br />
<br />
And waited.<br />
<br />
After a while their eagerness turned into irritation. Manny felt embarrassed at believing it was real. Theo looked at the ground, defeated.<br />
<br />
“Well, we can always have our own Halloween fun,” said Theo with feigned enthusiasm. After another few minutes he stood up, “I’m gonna take a shower.”<br />
<br />
After he grabbed a large towel and sulked over into the bathroom, Manny threw himself back onto his bed and stared at the ceiling. The signed Captain America poster was in the corner of his eye. He felt stupid for going along with Theo’s plan. He felt embarrassed that he actually believed it for a moment. He could hear the muffled boom of music from the frat party down the street. He realised that was the closest he’d probably get to their world; always watching from a distance. He stared at the ceiling for a few more minutes.<br />
<br />
Then, his stomach gurgled.<br />
<br />
He sat up and gently placed a hand on it. He felt the soft tissue of his belly harden and develop a strange texture. He lifted his shirt and almost jumped to his feet in excitement when he saw what the strange texture was; abs. The teen had grown a six pack in just a few seconds.<br />
<br />
It was working.<br />
<br />
“Holy shit! Theo! I think it’s working!” he knocked on the bathroom door.<br />
<br />
“I think it’s started for me too! This is so cool!” he heard Theo’s voice from behind it. <br />
<br />
Manny raced to the mirror to watch his transformation. It happened in less than a minute, and felt completely painless, just like the forum threads promised. Manny watched as his reflection gradually grew, swelled, and bulged out.<br />
<br />
The first notable change were his shoulders, which broadened under his T-shirt. The growth travelled down to his arms as his biceps ballooned out of his sleeves. He always thought the arms were Chris Evans’ sexiest trait, so to watch his own grow into them sent shockwaves of pleasure across his brain.<br />
<br />
“The feels amazing! It’s happening so fast!” he yelled out.<br />
<br />
“My hair’s growing! I feel like I shouldn’t have done this in just a towel!” Theo yelled back.<br />
<br />
His voice sounded different. Lower, and more commanding, but Manny didn’t notice. He was too busy gazing at his chest, which began to grow two thick pecs on top of his abs. His waist shrunk slightly, and he could feel his bone structure shift to carry his new weight. His shirt was incredibly tight, it didn’t occur to him to take it off before he started to change. His legs ballooned with muscle and stretched longer as he grew taller. He could feel his ass tense as it got tighter, growing until it became the very same America’s Ass he’d masturbated over many times. His shorts rode up above his thighs, looking closer to speedos with their seams split. <br />
<br />
“Oh shit” said Theo. His voice was definitely sounding more like Thor’s.<br />
<br />
“What is it?” asked Manny.<br />
<br />
“I think I’m…oh fuck.”<br />
<br />
Manny noticed Theo’s voice that time; lower and resembling more of Chris Hemsworth. He didn’t pay attention for long, as he watched the little bulge in his shorts become thicker. The sensations of this transformation was giving Manny a raging hardon, and his cock struggled to fit inside his shorts with its growing length.<br />
<br />
“Fuck it,” he thought, and he tore off his shorts and shirt. The feeling felt so free as he gazed upon his new body and 9-inch semi-hard cock. He flexed his biceps and caressed his chest before he felt his face grow numb.<br />
<br />
“My face! It’s almost finished!” yelled Manny.<br />
<br />
“I’m almost done too!” yelled Theo with Thor’s voice, “fuck yeah! I look so fucking sexy!”<br />
<br />
Manny placed his hands over his face as he felt it move under his palms. His nose sharpened, his eyes grew smaller and changed colour. The hair that hung over his forehead became blonde and, as he slowly pulled his hands away, he was now gazing upon the dashing good looks of Chris Evans as Captain America.<br />
<br />
“Woah,” he said in Chris’ voice.<br />
<br />
The boy was shocked at his reflection. He looked at his face, then wandered down the muscular physique he had grown in the span of less than a minute. He cupped his biceps, then his chest, then his face.<br />
<br />
“I’m…I’m…” he was so lost in the transformation he could barely string a sentence together. He felt his hands slowly move down his abs, ready to reach for his cock that pulsed with anticipation. Captain America’s cock, was just inches away from his grip.<br />
<br />
The bathroom door suddenly swung open, and a powerful, booming voice came from behind it.<br />
<br />
“Behold! Thor Odinson! God of Thunder, Wielder of Stormbreaker, and someone who wished they had a bigger towel!”<br />
<br />
Manny quickly grabbed fragments of his shirt and hid his cock with it as Theo, now fully transformed as Chris Hemsworth’s Thor, stepped into the dorm room. He stood proudly in the doorway with his hands on his hips, his ripped physique on full display. He was completely naked except for a small, white towel wrapped around his waist. It was too small to cover one of his wide legs, or to hide the boner pressed against his chest. His long blonde hair hung over his boulder shoulders. The two teens stood and admired each other’s new bodies, their heavy breaths filled with excitement.<br />
<br />
“Fuck, you look so good,” said Manny, “I can’t believe it worked!”<br />
<br />
“You doubted me?!” Theo asked with feigned disgust, “now come on! Let’s get these costumes on and hit the party!”<br />
<br />
Manny hesitated. All of those hormones were swimming in his brain. He really needed to jerk off.<br />
<br />
“Right now?” he asked, “can’t we just, uh…”<br />
<br />
He gestured towards his and then Theo’s crotch. Theo let out a bellowing laugh.<br />
<br />
“Of course not! The party’s already started! If we’re too late they won’t let us in, no matter how good we look. Come on, get that on.”<br />
<br />
Theo picked up the Captain America costume and threw it to Manny who, now looked too big to fit into it. The teen gave his Thor-like dorm mate a glare, to which Theo shrugged.<br />
<br />
“You’ll get your dick wet at the party. I know I will; there’ll be at least one girl who’ll wanna jump on Thor’s hammer,” he said with a sexy smirk.<br />
<br />
Manny scoffed at the pun, and put the costume on. He had never been so horny in his life, but tried to focus his mind on the party. He wanted to get his dick wet, but not with a girl.<br />
<br />
With Zachariah himself.</p>
