<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">*Sorry this took so long. Got hit by another snow storm, spent Friday/Saturday digging my way out of the house - bj88<br />

<br />
Outside, the sun head just started to set. Eric paced the streets of Moon Lake, unsure where to go, or what to do. The only thing on his mind was Julie Stovall. Some part really did want to be with her. But making the big change, that was something he wasn’t ready to do.<br />
<br />
“It’s a big decision. Not like getting a tattoo, those can be reversed at least.” he mumbled to himself. <br />
<br />
Eric kicked a stray rock in front of him, and stopped when he heard it clang against a street sign. BIRCH AVE. it read. Eric looked over his shoulder, and saw that he had, unknowingly or knowingly, walked to Julie’s house. Even though he was normal, he could still smell something in the air. It was sweet, like some perfumes. <br />
<br />
He wondered whether or not he should go over and see if Julie was alright.  She hadn’t been upset or angry when she left. Had she?<br />
<br />
Little did Eric know, Spencer had snuck out the bathroom window to follow him. Things inside the Anderson house were getting a little too heated for her taste. And since Nate had left, and Ben and Alex were clearly not interested in straying from each other, Spencer figured it was best if she went too. <br />
<br />
“Dessert with a nice side of cream.” she thought sarcastically. Even weres had boundaries. And engaging in group sex with one’s parents, and one’s friend’s parents at the same time, was a definite NO in Spencer’s book. Though she was open to Ben and Alex joining her, the two didn’t seem that interested. They’d excused themselves to go back to the Twist house, both sporting hard to miss erections. <br />
<br />
“Where the hell is he going?” Spencer thought. She wasn’t too familiar with the town yet. As she followed Eric she caught multiple scents. The strongest being this almost overwhelming fishy smell. Spencer stopped and ducked behind a bush when she saw Eric come to an abrupt halt. He was staring at a street sign, and then the house whose bush Spencer was hiding behind. <br />
<br />
“Julie’s house? It has to be. Why else would it smell like a fish market around here? Well there could be an actual fish market, but that’s about as likely as a UFO walking out of Area 51 alive.” Spencer’s thoughts too a bit of an unexpected tangent, but where quickly brought back when she saw Eric walk up to the house’s gate. <br />
<br />
He struggled for a moment to open it. Spencer considered revealing herself and helping him, but then Eric gave up and walked around to the house next door. He crossed over, and was now attempting to slip through the narrow bars of the gated perimeter. <br />
<br />
“Certainly is determined,” Spencer said, following at a safe distance. She had a much easier time bypassing the gate. When you live in a house where your father all but welds the doors shut, and locks all the “fun stuff” up, you learn how to pick locks. There was a distant noise that sounded like water hitting something. <br />
<br />
“Are those two having some sort of date in Julie’s pool?” <br />
<br />
Spencer slipped behind a tree, and changed in order to scale it. One of the perks of not being completely wolf. Cats climb trees, dogs pee on them. Once situated on a safe branch, Spencer changes back, so there isn’t any added weight. No that she gains that much when she changes. But her height does go up considerable. From her vantage point, she can see Eric was sneaking along the side of Julie’s house, in an especially cautious way.  <br />
<br />
“Maybe it’s some kind of role playing thing, “ she thought.<br />
<br />
But it was far from that. Spencer couldn’t see from her position, but there was a trail of discarded clothing on the ground below. Eric knew one set was Julie’s, the other belonged to an unidentified male. Eric wasn’t sure what he was doing moving forward to the pleasurable sounds, but he was. Spencer watched as Eric crept up to the pool fence and peer through the slats. <br />
<br />
Julie, despite being mostly underwater, was currently straddling (as much as a mermaid can straddle) a very, VERY happy wereotter. The otter’s torso is visible, and thankfully for Eric, his lower extremities are not. The dimly lit pool is hiding the otter’s genitals, tail and legs. <br />
<br />
“Oh boy…” Spencer thought when she saw the pair thrashing about in the water. Part of her wondered if Julie’s parents were home or not. She didn’t know about Martin Stovall’s less than honorable exploits. Melissa Stovall decided to drag her husband home from the prolonged meeting in Seattle, whether he wanted to leave whatever whore he had or not. Julie was once again left to her own devices, horny and needing a “playmate”. <br />
<br />
“Poor Eric.” Spencer thinks while look down at Eric’s still figure. He hasn’t moved from his spot on the ground, somewhat captivated by the sight in front of him. She tries to decide whether or not she should go down and comfort him. Or if she should jump into the pool and tear the mermaid and otter apart. Eric makes up his mind before Spencer does, and he kicks the gate door open.<br />
<br />
“Here we go.” Spencer mutters, climbing down from the tree to get closer to Eric, in case he does something equally stupid as Julie. <br />
<br />
“What the… Eric!” Julie exclaimed, immediately pushing herself away from the wereotter, whose penis was still inside Julie. He winces when he abruptly pulls away.<br />
<br />
“Give a guy a warning next time.” he says.<br />
<br />
“Ya, give a guy a warning next time you give him a blowjob and then go home to cheat on him!” Eric said, fuming. He catches glimpses of Julie’s frantically moving tail under the dark blue water. Under normal circumstances he might have been turned on. But right now all the blood in his body is too busy boiling to be directed towards his boy glands. Spencer stands on the opposite side of the fence, listening and waiting to see who throws the first punch. <br />
<br />
“Eric what are you doing here?” Julie managed to ask. She’s bright red, from the sex and from embarrassment. And partly because her fail is a deep rose red, and her scales catch the light and throw color everywhere. The water surrounding her is more purple than blue. <br />
<br />
“Does that matter? What the hell are you doing with… I don’t even know who it is you’re screwing around with!” Eric said. <br />
<br />
“Uh, not important.” The otter muttered, feeling extremely awkward. Julie said there was zero chance of Eric ever catching them, which was the only reason he agreed to this. So much for that theory.<br />
<br />
“Eric I’m sorry, please don’t be so mad. I can explain…”<br />
<br />
“Ya, sure you can. How long has this been going on?” Eric demands.<br />
<br />
“What do you mean?”<br />
<br />
“What do I mean?” I’m asking how long you’ve been seeing… whoever the hell this is!” Eric threw a hand towards the blushing otter, though his wet fur hides his flushed cheeks. <br />
<br />
“I… a while.” Julie admitted. <br />
<br />
“A while?”<br />
<br />
“Yes… a while.” Julie repeated. <br />
<br />
“This isn’t a Twilight movie, don’t make me ask how long a while is.” Eric said. <br />
<br />
“A few… weeks… months…” Julie muttered. <br />
<br />
“I’m sorry could you repeat that louder. There are normal ears here.” Eric snapped, no patience left. Julie and Spencer were both surprised by his curt voice. That wasn’t the Eric Anderson they knew (though Spencer’s only known him a few weeks). <br />
<br />
“A few weeks alright! We started seeing each other at the end of the summer!” <br />
<br />
“After we started dating?”<br />
<br />
“Yes! I’m sorry Eric, but the other option was t force you into a change. And I didn’t think spending my life in prison was worth a few hours of passion.”<br />
<br />
“A few hours!?” Eric repeated. He was well aware that weres engaged in sexual activities more often than normals. He didn’t, however, know that the duration of those activities sometimes took the entire evening. <br />
<br />
Eric didn’t say anything more for “a while”. He was trying to form the right words to express what he was feeling. So instead he turns on his heels and starts to storm off. Julie shouts his name as he leaves, but Eric ignores her. Spencer, still quite unsure what to do, allows herself to follow Eric. He breaks into something of a run. <br />
<br />
Eric blindly races down the street, ignoring the car horns and yells. The only thing going through his head is the reassuring image of Julie and that damn otter, wrapped in each other’s arms. <br />
<br />
“That should have been me! It could have been me if I wasn’t so stupid!” he thought. A steady rain breaks out over Moon Lake, despite the forecast saying there would be clear skies. Eric stops running and sits down on a curb. There, he finally starts crying. Spencer pauses across the street. Then speeds across to Eric’s side, where she tries to get him to move.<br />
<br />
“You’ll catch a cold if you stay out here.” she said, trying to snap Eric out of his state. But he wouldn’t budge. So instead of forcing him to get up, Spencer sits on the curb next to him, and hugs him. Eric cries in her arms for almost ten minutes before he realizes whose arms are around him. He looks up at Spencer, and kisses her. On the lips, hard. <br />
<br />
Unlike all the times when he and Julie kissed, he didn’t hold anything back. And the two would have ended up naked together on that curb if a car hadn’t sped past and through a nearby puddle. The two are left soaking wet, and laughing.</p>
