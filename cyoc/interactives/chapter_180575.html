<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Bryan pulled into the gym parking lot on his way home, deciding he wanted to give his muscles other than his cock a bit of a work out. He grabbed his school gym clothes out of the trunk and headed into the place. He had a membership, his dad had bought it for him as a birthday present, hoping his son would stop sulking about being a scrawny nobody and do something about it. Well, he wasn&#39;t scrawny anymore, but he scanned his card for the front desk guy, giving the hunky Asian man a smile before he went over to the locker room.<br />
<br />
Bryan quickly changed out of his clothes. He might be a better looking guy now, but he still had some hesitancy when it came to standing naked in a locker room, even if it was pretty empty this late on a weeknight. He sighed a bit and turned his head to catch a dark skinned young man glancing at him. His heart shot into his throat and he gave a little jump. He didn&#39;t know someone else was in this row. When the guy looking at him jumped, Bryan stared.<br />
<br />
That was him! There were mirrors at the end of each of the locker rows, he had been startled by himself.<br />
<br />
Wes&#39; questions from earlier came back to him as he stepped closer to study his reflection. What had happened to him? He was dark. Not as dark as Ross, but nothing that could be passed off as a simple tan. He sure as hell wasn&#39;t just some white kid anymore though. He looked.. mixed. Maybe favoring the black side a little more. He stepped closer. Even his face seemed different. He could still recognize himself despite slightly thicker lips and a broader nose. His hair was very curly and stuck closer to his scalp. For the first time he worried. He was losing himself completely. There wasn&#39;t a single thing about him unchanged from his two wishes, except his thoughts, and even those seemed.. muddled sometimes.<br />
<br />
He sighed. A work out would make him feel better. He grabbed a towel from his locker and shut it, heading out to the gym floor. He started off with some free weights, testing how much weight he could handle. He knew the basic routines from gym class, but he didn&#39;t know what his body&#39;s new limits were. He was honestly surprised every time he had to add a little more weight, finally looking for that sweet spot where it wasn&#39;t easy but wasn&#39;t too hard. As he sat on the chest fly he noticed an older man in the gym being helped by a hot but &#39;roided out trainer.<br />
<br />
There was something familiar about the older man, but Bryan couldn&#39;t place it. Then it hit him. That was his history teacher, Mr. Clark. Bryan&#39;s eyes almost bugged out of his head. He thought the man had been nothing but pudge under those ill-fitting suits of his, but the man must just need a better tailor. Sure, he had a gut, and a layer of fat across him hiding definition but that chest and those arms were packing some muscle on them. Especially when he saw how much weight was using for bicep curls as the trainer counted reps.<br />
<br />
He was just close enough to hear. When the weight was set back down, the trainer patted him on a meaty shoulder. &quot;Well, Mr. Clark, you&#39;re definitely at a better starting point than most guys your age.&quot; The trainer was saying with a bit of surprise. &quot;I think we can whip you back into shape in no time, just gotta burn off that fat.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mr. Clark patted his stomach. &quot;That&#39;s what I&#39;m hoping.&quot; Maybe it was the lights in the gym as opposed to the cheap fluorescent lighting in the school but Mr. Clark even looked better. His white hair actually had some blond to it, and he seemed to look a little younger. Maybe it was just seeing him out of class and in gym clothes rather than his baggy suit. Smiling instead of looking annoyed with the bunch of noisy teens he had to deal with daily. In fact, Mr. Clark in those shorts and tank had a bit of a daddy bear thing going on, his pecs just shy of sticking out as far as his gut.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, follow me, I&#39;ve got a few ideas.&quot; The trainer said as Mr. Clark got up to follow, turning his muscled back and well-rounded rear in Bryan&#39;s direction.<br />
<br />
Bryan felt a twinge in his shorts and looked away. Oh, hell no, he was not about to go thinking on that route. He refocused on his work out, trying to banish both those thoughts and his earlier worries away in the routine. Thirty minutes later he was feeling pretty good about himself, energized. Even if this change wasn&#39;t going quite how he expected it, there were definitely good points. He flexed for himself in the gym mirror, snapping a quick selfie of his post-workout muscles and sent it off to Wes before he even thought about it and headed back to the locker room.<br />
<br />
He stripped off his gym clothes but stopped before he pulled his regular clothes back on. He was sweaty and probably would end up a little ripe. Sure he could take a shower at home, but part of him wanted to get used to locker rooms like this. There was water running in the shower area already, someone was in there.<br />
<br />
Bryan had nothing to be ashamed of. Even his cock was bigger now than it had been. He grabbed a towel and walked naked to the showers, gritting his teeth with each step but determined to just get this over with. What he saw when he rounded the corner was not what he expected at all. There were two guys in there, not one and they were.. fuck.<br />
<br />
Bryan ducked back around the corner, leaning around just enough to see what was going on in the showers, his bare ass and shoulder pressed against the tile wall. It was Mr. Clark again, standing under one of the showers as the water streamed over his head and shoulders, down his furry pecs and belly. He was stocky, powerfully built. Sure he had a bit of fat on him but that just made him seem bigger and more solid. The guy that had been kneeling in front of him was bigger without an ounce of fat on him. Bryan could only make out his heavily muscled back and gigantic arms, but the short blond hair gave him away as the trainer that had been working with Mr. Clark and was now sucking him off. Eagerly.<br />
<br />
Bryan went hard instantly. This was the second time today he walked in on someone he knew getting a blow job.<br />
<br />
---------<br />
<br />
Alex looked down as Chad happily sucked his cock off. Who knew the &#39;roided out gym rat had a thing for daddy bears. It actually put that smirk from his memories in a new context. Maybe Chad hadn&#39;t been smirking at the old man, but had been awkwardly flirting. This time it hadn&#39;t phased him though. Chad seemed to take every opportunity during their work out to touch him. Sure, it was his job to correct technique and posture, showing him the right way to lift or squat or whatever they were doing but the touch always sort of lingered.<br />
<br />
Alex didn&#39;t know what had gotten into him either. He had never been into men, he wasn&#39;t even sure he was at this moment. He was just liking the idea of this hulk of a man on his knees in front of him, gobbling away on his cock. That must be it, he told himself, it was about power, not sex. He hadn&#39;t expected the offer from the goliath, and he surprised himself when he accepted. He had expected to be pranked when he stepped into the showers, but there was none of that from Chad. He had just wordlessly knelt and took Alex&#39;s cock into his mouth, working it with more skill than Alex had ever felt before.<br />
<br />
It had been so long since someone other than himself had held that cock that he didn&#39;t last long. He grabbed the back of Chad&#39;s head as he felt his cock stirring, but it didn&#39;t seem that the man was going to do anything but swallow every last drop Alex could give him. Alex grunted deep in his chest as he came, stronger and more powerfully than he&#39;d felt in decades. Chad drank down every last drop.<br />
<br />
Slowly he stood, smirking at Alex with that cocky grin of his. &quot;Why don&#39;t we schedule another work out session tomorrow. Same time? I&#39;ll pencil you in.&quot; Chad only waited for the nod before moving out from under the shower and grabbing his towel to change and go home. Alex gave himself a few seconds to collect himself before following after. What had gotten into him?<br />
<br />
-------<br />
<br />
Bryan watched until the end, his hand on his rigid cock slowly slicking the pre along his shaft. This was even better than porn. Watching two guys going at it without them knowing he was there. As they stood to leave, Bryan quickly ducked into a bathroom stall waiting for them to pass. He definitely didn&#39;t need his teacher recognizing him. If he could. Once both men had passed, Bryan slipped out of the stall and into the showers.<br />
<br />
He turned one on and sighed as the hot water coursed over his skin, running over the grooves and swells of his newly acquired muscles. He thought about what he had just seen, about Ross and Diego earlier, and Wes. Fucking Wes. He grabbed his still straining cock and pumped his hand over the shaft. His cock was so dark now, even against his hand it looked, well, almost black. Maybe it was the water, but his skin looked darker all over, more so than it was when he stepped into the gym.<br />
<br />
He ran a hand over his pecs, the hair curled tight against his skin, teasing his dark nipples as he continued to jerk off with is other hand. He imagined Wes kneeling before him like that trainer had been before Mr. Clark, sucking him off, looking up at him with those puppy-dog eyes of his. Bryan grunted and came, his cum splattering against the colorful tiles of the gym showers.<br />
<br />
He finished rinsing himself off and went back to his locker, drying himself off with the towel before he got dressed. He was in a bit of a daze as he left, barely catching the, &quot;See ya later, Bry.&quot; From the Asian hunk behind the counter, like he was a regular or something. Was he really okay with this? With everything? He could probably go undo his wish, or hell he could make another if he wanted to to fix this one. But did he?<br />
<br />
He drove home. Not even noticing he wasn&#39;t taking the normal route. Or that when he did pull up in front of a house that it wasn&#39;t the normal house. His key worked, opening the door, and he didn&#39;t even pause as he headed to a room he had never been to before but was now his. He closed the door behind him, stripped out of his clothes and fell into the bed with a sigh. He had to figure this out, but he was exhausted and soon drifted off.<br />
<br />
He woke up to the alarm on his phone, having to fish around next to the bed for his pants to shut it off. Still on auto-pilot he got up and walked naked over to one of the doors off the bedroom. His muddled brain knew it was a bathroom, and he stepped inside, emptying his bladder into the toilet with a contented sigh. There was another door in the bathroom, he knew it led to his brothers room. They&#39;ve always shared this bathroom, and neither was bothered by seeing the other strutting around naked.<br />
<br />
Bryan shook his head. He did share a bathroom with his brother, but it wasn&#39;t between their rooms it was out in a hallway. What was.. he looked around. The room was familiar and completely strange all at once. It felt like his brain and memories were fighting with themselves. He stepped over to the sink to wash his hand and stared into the mirror. The face was familiar, but it wasn&#39;t his. The young, black man staring back at him was not the face Bryan was used to seeing in the mirror, but at the same time, he knew it was right. His hair was shaved down on the sides, the top braided into corn-rows.<br />
<br />
The other door opened and a very naked, morning-wood bearing Ross came stepping into the bathroom. &quot;Hey, bro.&quot; He slapped Bryan on the shoulder and went to relieve himself in the toilet, having to coax it out past his wake-up erection. &quot;Mind if I get the shower first?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Na, go ahead.&quot; Bryan said, trying not to freak out as he left the bathroom back to his bed room. The shock had cleared his mind a bit and he looked around the place. Some of the stuff was his stuff. He recognized it. He knew where it sat in his bedroom back home. But some of the other stuff, the room? It.. was all wrong. He fished his wallet out of his jeans and quickly dug out his driver&#39;s license.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bryan Jansen?&quot; He muttered under his breath. He heard the shower starting up in the bathroom. The photo was the face he had just seen in the mirror, and the first name was his, but everything else was different. The address, his height and weight, which probably matched his new body. His birthday had changed. But he knew that date from when he was friends with Ross. It was the same birthday. They were twins? Not identical, but they looked like brothers now that he looked at his own picture.<br />
<br />
He sat on the edge of the bed in shock. &quot;I wished for this twice.&quot; He muttered. &quot;Both times I wished to be more like Ross... But then should Wes.. no.&quot; No, in the second wish he wanted Wes to be more like Diego, and that either over wrote or modified the first one. He must have been sitting and thinking on this for a while because eventually the shower shut off and he looked up to see a damp Ross leaning in his bedroom doorway.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shower&#39;s all yours. Hurry up, I want to get to school early. I have a feeling it&#39;s going to be an interesting day.&quot;</p>
