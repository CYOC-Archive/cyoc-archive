<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The mourning came and John woke up early at 6:00am with a rock hard erection. John didn&#39;t think much of it as he is a young man who has mourning wood all the time. John continued with his normal routine, getting changed, brushing his teeth and preparing breakfast. After finishing breakfast, John noticed he still had a full blown erection which had not softened yet since he woke up. John&#39;s next stop on his routine would be to wake up he roommate, Nate, which he did almost everyday since Nate almost always forget to set his alarms. Today was especially important since Nate had an important interview for a big job opportunity he could get once he graduates.<br />
<br />
John approached Nate&#39;s bedroom door, seeing it open, walked right in. John saw that Nate had some mourning wood as well as his dick was creating a tent under his sheets. Normally this wouldn&#39;t phase John, he was a very straight man, he never once thought about a man in a sexual or romantic way and was always very comfortable with his own sexuality. Seeing another man&#39;s dick would never phased him. In the past John would not have even noticed Nate&#39;s mourning wood. However, today was different, upon seeing Nate&#39;s tent, John remembered his own now painfully throbbing erection and he began rubbing his dick through his shorts. <br />
<br />
John began thinking to himself with thoughts he never had before. &quot;I&#39;ve never sucked a man&#39;s dick before, I kinda wonder what its like.&quot; and &quot;College is the time to experiment, I should at least try once, Nate is an incredibly heavy sleeper, he would never even know.&quot; John was loosing all common sense and found himself kneeling at the side of Nate&#39;s bed at his waste. John slowly pulled Nate&#39;s sheets off his dick, then he carefully pulled the waste band of Nate&#39;s boxers over and off his dick setting the 10&quot; monster free. His pubic region and balls were clean shaven and were slightly damp and shiny with sweat. John licked his lips and began approaching Nate&#39;s dick with his lips. All the while, John continued to rub his own dick.<br />
<br />
John looked up to Nate one last time to ensure he is sleeping, before finally doing it. John opened his mouth and began taking Nick&#39;s large dick into his mouth. At first John was just sucking and licking only around the head, telling himself &quot;that&#39;s all I needed to try, just the head, I can stop now... But maybe a little bit more.&quot; John now found himself 4&quot; down Nates dick, he was now moving his head rythmically up and down over a couple inches. John was trying to reason with himself to stop but it wasn&#39;t working, &quot;Ok, I did a few inches, I should stop before he comes, then he would definitely know what I did... But then again this is probably my only chance to try this, I wonder how much I can take.&quot;<br />
<br />
John closed his eyes and continued bobbing his head up and down on Nate&#39;s dick, every time he went down he would go a little further down. John suddenly felt something soft and warm on lips. John opened his eyes and saw he had taken the entire 10&quot; dick in his mouth easily. John knew he had a gag reflex has he has triggered it in the past on accident while eating or something, however, he had somehow taken Nate&#39;s full dick in not just his mouth but down his throat. As John was loosely pondering this, he continued to suck and felt Nate&#39;s dick start to throb. John knew what this meant, this was the feeling right before he would normally blow his own load and knew Nate was about to do the same.<br />
<br />
John&#39;s thoughts started racing &quot;SHIT! SHIT! SHIT! If Nate cums he would know for sure what I did! What do I do?... I&#39;ve got, I&#39;ll just have to swallow all of his cum. It might be disgusting, but at least he won&#39;t find a mess.&quot; This was the only lose logic that John could manage while he continued to suck Nate&#39;s dick. Then John felt the twitch of Nate&#39;s dick and a massive load of cum filled his mouth and washed right down his throat. It was warm, thick, sticky and salty, all logic was telling him it was disgusting, but something else told him it was delicious and he continued to suck and swallow savoring every burst. After a few bursts, Nate&#39;s dick began to soften in John&#39;s mouth. Meanwhile, with ever drop of cum John swallowed, he felt his own dick throb closer and closer to orgasm. As Nate&#39;s dick softened to 5&quot; flaccid, John sucked out the last drop only now noticed his left hand on his own twitching dick. As soon as John swallowed the last drop of Nate&#39;s cume he let out his own load of cum into his own underwear. John fell back, away from Nate&#39;s bed and laid in pleasure as he released load after load into his own underwear. It was the most intense orgasm John had ever had.</p>
