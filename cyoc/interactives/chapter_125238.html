<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The girl waddled through her house, weighed down by enormous curves. The eggs might have stopped multiplying, but 31 eggs were growing into big babies. Her belly blew up bigger than any natural pregnancy. A taught sphere stuck out 3 feet in front of her, so big that you could see its sides from behind. As her belly grew, so did her breasts; filling with milk for her growing brood. Her heavy breasts sat on the shelf of her belly like two oversized melons. They were beyond any cup size she knew of and were big enough they nearly blocked her vision. Each breast was capped with oversized nipples and puffy areola, constantly erect from milking. Her hips had widened to hold her immense womb and ease the passage of so many children. Her appetite had become immense and her husband was happy to feed it. All that food soon turned into fat and piled onto her enhanced hips. All this added up to thick flanks that were four feet wide, easily wider than her shoulders. Each butt cheek was the size of a medicine ball, supported by thighs that were thicker than her husband’s torso. Despite her huge mass she remained healthy. She had no stretch marks on her belly or cellulite on her fat. The rest of her body remained thin while her enormous curves were impossibly round and bouncy.<br />
<br />
She moved at a slow pace as her mountains of flesh jiggled and bounced. She was forced to sway her hips and swing her legs around each other, her thighs constantly fighting for space. Behind her, the twin spheres of fat that was her butt wobbled uncontrollably. Even the smallest movement would cause an earthquake as each globular butt cheek bounced off each other. The girl had to carry her own breasts when she moved. She practically buried her face in the deep cleavage as she cradled her fat tits. She leaned back to keep her belly off the ground and put the weight on her hips. <br />
<br />
There wasn’t much clothing that fit the girl’s huge curves anymore. She wore a cotton shirts that were just big enough to cover her big udders, her leaky nipples constantly soaking the front. Her biggest pair of shorts would have once looked like pants on her, but now they were skin tight and barely covered her oversized rump. Her husband liked to dress her in thigh high socks so that her thick thighs looked like rising sough.<br />
<br />
She walked through the extra wide doorway, taking a break when she reached the kitchen. She stood there, huffing and puffing with her hands on her hips, sinking into the deep layers of fat. The mysterious man had been good on his offer; providing the girl, not only with a body that could handle her extreme pregnancy, but also a home tailored to her immense size. But there was a price.<br />
<br />
Woman all over the world would constantly wish for children and they had to come from somewhere. So, in return the girl became a constant supply of fertilized eggs. Sometimes the girl would feel her belly rumble and shrink as the baby is magically transported to another womb. Some of the babies were born naturally, carried off to the new mother. Her new husband was happy to supply the seed for the babies. He loved her gravid form and his arousal grew with her. He couldn’t keep his hands off her, constantly fondling her butt, rubbing her belly or messaging her breasts. His huge balls filled him with an uncontrollable lust. Without warning he would roll her onto her belly, trapping her on top the giant sphere. The girl would writhe and moan helplessly as her husband endlessly humped her.<br />
<br />
The girl grabbed a bucket of ice cream and struggled back to the living room. She collapsed onto the couch, her fat ass taking up most of the seats. She proceeded to comfort herself by eating the entire tub of ice cream as she thought about her new life. She was now permanently pregnant, engorged to the point of looking ridiculous. She was buried under a mountain of milk, babies and her own fat as her husband constantly stuffed her with food and semen. Her husband would take her on walks to show her off to the public. She would feel embarrassed as everyone stared at her and whispered about how big she was growing.<br />
<br />
She felt like the world’s fattest cow. A prize-winning heifer to be mounted endlessly by her big bull and paraded around a county fair. She was helpless to stop herself growing into a pregnant pile of tits and ass. She couldn’t control her own pleasure as she was forced into orgasmic pleasure from the demi-berth of her teleporting brood or the constant plowing of her husband. She felt overwhelmed, but most of all, she secretly loved it.<br />
<br />
She loved the feeling of being so big and fertile, loving the feeling of all her soft flesh jiggling at every movement. The humiliating stares when she entered public left her wet and horny. She would never admit it, but she loved being just grabbed and used, and helplessly cumming like it’s all she was built to do. She was huge and useless except for sex and baby making. Thinking about all this started making her wet, uncontrollably wiggling her hips into the couch.<br />
<br />
She was interrupted by a deep gurgle in her belly. The taught sphere began wobble as it convulsed, gurgling incessantly. The girl began to pant as she felt a pressure against swollen vagina. Pressure grew until the damn broke, releasing a flood pleasure. She wailed and moaned uncontrollably from orgasm after orgasm. She tried to writhe and buck, but was trapped under her enormous belly. When the orgasms stopped the girl was soaked with milk and sweat. Her hands explored her slightly smaller belly from the transported baby. She was too weak move, but her husband would home soon. She picked up the tub of ice cream, gorging herself as she looked forward to her husband filling her with more babies.<br />
<br />
She wondered how big she could get, or if she could even stop herself.</p>
