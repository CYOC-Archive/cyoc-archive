<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was a typical room for a girl child; toys strewn about a full body mirror by a vanity a bed by the window. What was missing was a dresser full of clothes, as well as blankets on the bed. Sleeping on the bed and under a thin bed sheet was an anthro tigress cub. The cub had the traditional orange fur with black stripes throughout her body; however, her belly and chest had cream colored fur instead of white with black stripes, she was the infant daughter of Michael and Denise Proudhoof. Denise being an anthro tigress fury while her mate Michael was an anthro stag-deer fury; the two were thrilled when their daughter was born four years ago and spoiled the cub nearly shamelessly.<br />
<br />
Opening the blinds of Roxy’s room, Denise watched as her cub stirred from her slumber; the cub spent much of yesterday playing inside. She never watched the snow began to fall as it happened after her parents put her to bed.<br />
“Morning sleepy head,” Denise looking at her daughter who finally opened her bright green eyes; watching as her round fury ears twitch as she opened her maw with a yawn. “After breakfast and some cartoons,” Denise looking at the state of Roxy’s room; “you need to tidy up your mess.”<br />
“But I’m playing with these,” Roxy sitting on her bed; placing her paws on the carpeted floor as she picks up a stuffed unicorn plushie.<br />
“I don’t exactly see that,” Denise shaking her head; “now hurry up and use the bathroom. Dad has breakfast ready,” Denise ushering her cub out of her room; “and you might just see a surprise downstairs.”<br />
<br />
The word surprise perked the Tigress cub up as she quickly did her morning business in the bathroom. Coming out a few minutes later, Roxy dashes downstairs to see through the windows a blanket of white powder outside; her eyes go wide with excitement as she sees and comprehends snow for the first time.<br />
“Can we go outside and play,” Roxy heading to the living room window; getting a better view of the snow on the ground, and watching as a snow plow drives by scraping the powder off of the road.<br />
“Breakfast first,” Denise chuckling as she steers her daughter to the kitchen; “room cleaning afterwards.”<br />
<br />
“Well there is our sleepy kitty,” Michael seeing Roxy being lifted into her booster seat at the kitchen table; noticing her attention was drawn to the snow that was outside. “We had a heavy snowfall while you slept,” Michael putting down a plate of banana and strawberry crepes for Roxy; “your mother and I spent an hour watching it before we went to bed.”<br />
“Clean your room after breakfast,” Denise pouring herself a cup of coffee as Michael puts down a plate full of crepes for her; “and you can go outside or watch cartoons.”<br />
“Snow,” Roxy excitedly shoveling the fruit crepes into her muzzle; “let’s play in the snow!” <br />
“Okay,” Michael chuckling; “we can do that for a few hours before I have to go to work. “Denise did you call Edward yet?”<br />
“I sent a text,” Denise answering as she checks her phone; “I don’t think he’ll refuse watching over our daughter for the evening while we attend a work party.”<br />
Michael nods as he watches Roxy devour her crepes faster than it took for him to make them; a smile creeps over his cervine face as he can’t wait for Roxy to see the second surprise he has instore. Hoping that Denise finds the boxes in basement while he is out with Roxy; Michael can’t wait to see the look on his daughter’s face when she sees the Christmas tree up.<br />
“Looks like someone is raring to go,” Denise watching Roxy squirm in her seat; “since you are done breakfast, go clean your room. The faster you get that done,” Denise smiling as she cuts into her breakfast crepe; “the more time you have to play outside.”<br />
<br />
Michael chuckles as he watches the tigress cub bolt out of the kitchen and thunder upstairs to her room; the sound of her paws slapping on the floor as she squeals in delight.<br />
“It’s a good thing I pulled the toboggan out last night,” Michael eating his breakfast crepe; “there are a couple decent hills for her to tear down on.”<br />
“Just make sure she is safe,” Denise looking at her mate; “and take pictures. I want some precious memories of her at this age.”<br />
<br />
**********<br />
<br />
The sound of a joyful scream fills the nearby park as Roxy rockets down a hill on a sled that Michael pulled from the house. The tigress cub sat in it as she enjoyed the crisp air and the feel of snow on her fur and paws as she came in contact with the frozen white fluff. Reaching the bottom of the hill, roxy looks confused as the toboggan stops looking up she see her father commenting; “you need to pull the sled back up if you want another ride.”<br />
Roxy grabs the rope and climbs up the steep slope. Having to resort to nearly using all four paws to climb up; she hears her father laughs as she senses a weight lifting as she could now climb up the hill with little resistance. Turning around to see the sled floating in the air as if it were a balloon, Roxy turns to see her father’s runes glowing as she now gets within reach for him to grab hold of the sled.<br />
<br />
“I guess the sled is a bit too heavy for you to lug up hill,” Michael looking bemused; his runes fading as the sled falls to the ground, he repositions it so Roxy could have another ride down the hill. Watching her climb onto the wooden toboggan, Michael smiles as he gets on the sled behind her; “now let’s see if two can go down faster than one,” Michael helping Roxy to sit on his lap. Placing his hoof hands into the snow, he pushes the sled forward and quickly grips his daughter as gravity soon does the rest.<br />
“Weeeeeeeeeeeee,” Roxy screams as the sled once again rockets down the hill; this time going farther down the hill thanks to Michael’s added weight. They repeated the process for another hour before Roxy started to shiver as the snow started to soak her fur; Michael noticing his daughter looking cold, he uses his magic runes to dry her off.<br />
“I guess we should head back,” Michael watching as his daughter struggled to not shiver or look cold; “mother would be upset if you caught a fever during this time of the year.”<br />
<br />
Roxy looked glum as she felt her fun being cut short; however her shivering soon began to become unbearable and she looked at her father as he quickly hauled ass back to home.<br />
“We’ll be home in a few minutes and get you warmed up with a hot shower,” Michael doing his best to cheer up Roxy; hoping that Denise will have finished with some decorating.<br />
“Can I have hot coca too,” Roxy responding as she shivers despite her fur dry; the combination of the cold air kissing her prior wet fur sapped her warmth.<br />
“Sure,” Michael nodding as they approached the house; “and mom will be more than happy to snuggle with you as you watch your unicorn show.”<br />
<br />
This made Roxy happy as they approached the front door; hoping off the sled, she quickly makes a dash to the front door as Michael props the sled up by the entrance; figuring that they would be doing more tobogganing again tomorrow and just about every possible day after.<br />
“Now let’s get you warmed up,” Michael guiding the tigress cub inside; making sure to keep her from looking in the living room as he rushes her up to the bathroom. Stealing a quick glance to see Denise quickly decorating a Christmas tree; he notices her runes glowing as the ornaments fly out of the boxes and settle on the tree in a kaleidoscope of colors. Giving her a quick nod, Michael heads upstairs to join his daughter and help her in the shower.<br />
<br />
*******************************<br />
<br />
Twenty minutes later Michael escorted Roxy out of the bathroom; helping her to wash up from her chilly morning frolic in the snow, he washed and scrubbed her backside while the cub took care of her special area. Giving her a modicum of privacy as she used the washcloth to gingerly caress and clean her privates before he helped to rinse off the special shampoo and then drying her off. Escorting her down stair, Michael grins as Roxy pauses to see Denise placing the star on top of the tree and then turning on the lights. The Tigress’s eyes go wide and her pupils dilate in wonder and joy as she views the marvel that was put up in the corner of the room.<br />
“You never forget your first Christmas,” Michael embracing his daughter as she takes in the multi-colored spectacle. “Come,” Michael lifting Roxy up and carrying her to the kitchen; “let’s get you some hot coca while your mother finishes up.”</p>
