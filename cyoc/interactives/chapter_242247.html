<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Finally, Ty felt Lisa stop fighting against his transforming her back. He was relieved, and utterly exhausted. His power had never before required such effort to use! There had never before been any resistance; he willed something to happen, and at most it just took a little concentration, and what he wanted happened. That certainly had been the case when Ty transformed Lisa into his cock. As her human body finally started to return, he thought more about how this had happened.<br />
<br />
----------<br />
<br />
He usually liked Lisa&#39;s tranformation ideas a lot, but he hadn&#39;t been so thrilled about this one. But as Lisa said, hIs masturbating, knowing that she WAS his cock, that his cock was her sole being, the entirety of her, was somewhat of a turn on. In a way it was a little like her transformation into a virtual assistant mobile app, in that her normal physical body was gone. But when she was a phone app, even though that was much different than her normal existence, they could still communicate. And because of the way he designed that transform, she got off on it, though he did not. He just enjoyed ordering her app around, and watching her enjoy it.<br />
<br />
With her as his cock, though, there was no communication. He knew that she would enjoy him masturbating, but there was no indication of it, aside from his own ejaculation. He couldn&#39;t really even imagine exactly how she experienced that, though it had to be nice. But aside from thinking of her, his side of the experience just felt like normal masturbation. Pleasant, but not nearly as pleasant as sex with her was, in either normal or extremely perverted forms.<br />
<br />
After he masturbated, and rested for a couple of minutes, he considered going again. But really, the appeal of this for him was to have her tell him about it, so he transformed her back.<br />
<br />
That is, he started to transform her back, and the transformation started as expected, with his cock starting to expand out into what would eventually become her body. Exactly the inverse of how she had transformed into his cock. He started to feel her pussy lips around the base of his cock, but then, unexpectedly, he hit resistance. Even more surprising, not only did the transformation stop, but it reversed! Lisa&#39;s pussy lips disappeared again, merged back into his cock. WTF?<br />
<br />
He tried again, and this time he couldn&#39;t even get the transformation started! He was blocked somehow! He tried several times, with no results. Oh, shit, he thought. This is serious! He&#39;d promised Lisa&#39;s parents that he would never use his power in a way that harmed Lisa, and only hours later, had transformed her in a way that he couldn&#39;t undo. This wasn&#39;t like the app fiasco, where he just didn&#39;t have her consent to transform her back to human. Now he literally could not do it, even with his power, of which he&#39;d never before found a limit.<br />
<br />
The one time before that he&#39;d tried to cause a transformation and failed, was when he tried to revert to his normal body, after the very first time that he&#39;d transformed himself into (mostly) a copy of Lisa&#39;s body. But that time, he hadn&#39;t felt any resistance. Just nothing happened. When he later told her about it, Lisa suggested that it might have been because he hadn&#39;t actually wanted to transform back. That was true; he liked having her body and wanted to keep it. He had only tried to transform back out of a perceived necessity. But this time there wasn&#39;t the slightest doubt or hesitation in his mined. He definitely wanted Lisa back, as herself.<br />
<br />
This failure was different than that first one in another way. He was facing active opposition somehow. He had no idea who or what it could be. Maybe if he somehow tried harder, he could overpower it. He set his mind to it, and attempted the transformation again. At first, he felt like he wss making a tiny bit of progress, that the opposition was beginning to yield, but then, suddenly, the opposing force matched him. It was almost as if someone else possessing the same power was fighting him. Was that possible? He didn&#39;t really know where his own power came from, and he&#39;d never even heard even a hint of anyone having similar power, but then, someone else who had the same power would probably keep it a closely held secret, as he had done. He&#39;d only revealed his power to six people. There was his own family, June, Mark, and Dustin, and Lisa&#39;s family, Maria, Diego, and of course, Lisa herself.<br />
<br />
After a few more attempts to overpower whatever force was opposing the transformation, met each time with the same failure, he stopped to think. Could he distract his opponent? No, they seem to react instantly, and he don&#39;t even know who or where they are. Until he figured that out, he would get nowhere.<br />
<br />
Who would want to oppose his transforming Lisa back? He knew it wouldn&#39;t be his family or Lisa&#39;s family. None of them were even aware of her current form, and even if they were aware, they&#39;d want her transformed back. No, the only person who knew about her transformation was himself.<br />
<br />
Was it his own subconscious fighting him? Monsters from the id? No, that made no sense. He wasn&#39;t all that thrilled with this particular transform. Even his own subconscious would surely rather have her back, if only to transform her to a form he enjoyed more. Just to be sure, he tried to transform her, rather than to her normal human body, into other forms he had especially liked. No dice.<br />
<br />
No, there was no way that anyone else knew what was going on. Just himself. Well, and Lisa, of course.<br />
<br />
Holy shit, he thought. Could it be Lisa opposing the transformation? Why would she do that? She had given him consent to always be able to transform her back to human. Even if she found this form especially pleasant, she&#39;d know that he&#39;d let her repeat it whenever she wanted. The second time in her app form, she&#39;d been willing to transform back, if not exactly eager to do so.<br />
<br />
But if it was Lisa opposing the transformation, how could she do it? She didn&#39;t have his power. He&#39;d given her a few powers, but nowhere near his own. She could control the soundproofing of their bedrooms. She could transform him to his normal human form, and she could undo and redo any transformation he had done to her. Nothing that opposed his power.<br />
<br />
Or was there? What if when he started trying to undo her transformation, she started trying to redo it? Oh, no. That had to be it. The equal and opposite force, blocking him.<br />
<br />
He wanted June&#39;s help again, though he even less wanted to tell her what he&#39;d transformed Lisa into this time, than when it had been the app. And June had been able to help because the issue was one of consent, and the solution could be reasoned out. If Lisa had power rivaling his own, to block being transformed back... He was on the verge of tears. What if he had lost her? He&#39;d always know where she was, but never see her true form again, never talk to her again, never even know for sure that she was happy.<br />
<br />
This was intolerable. He simply MUST find a solution. He considered and rejected many things that clearly would not work. If only he could talk to her.<br />
<br />
That&#39;s it! He would give her the ability to communicate. By her own request, her current form as his cock did not have that. He would talk to her, and convince her to let him transform her back. It was only the work of a moment to give her the ability to hear and speak. Fortunately, he net no resistance to that.<br />
<br />
He started attempting to transform her, while calling out to her. &quot;Lisa! Lisa, stop fighting me!&quot; He had hoped that just hearing him would get her to stop opposing the transformation, or at least get her to talk to him, but he was disappointed. She kept up the resistance. He kept trying the transform, and calling her name.<br />
<br />
He felt something change. He couldn&#39;t quite tell what at first, but then he realized. She had undone his transformation that allowed communication. She had actually blocked him from talking to her!<br />
<br />
He continued trying to transform her. The effort was tiring him. Maybe she&#39;ll tire of it before I do, he thought, not actually expecting it. Her power to redo the transformation probably exactly matched his power to transform her to normal.<br />
<br />
He thought some more, while he kept up the fight. Can I do two transformations at once, he wondered. I&#39;ve never done it before, but I should try, he thought. Lisa doesn&#39;t have as much experience with this kind of power as I do, so maybe she won&#39;t be able to sustain fighting off two transformations at once. Though he didn&#39;t know whether he could sustain doing two at once, either.<br />
<br />
He kept trying to transform her into human form, and also, simultaneously, to transform her to have hearing and speech. He felt her oppose both, but she apparently wasn&#39;t able to exert as much opposition to the hearing and speech. He was able to overpower her on that. He started calling out to her again. &quot;Lisa! It&#39;s Ty! You have to let me transform you back!&quot;<br />
<br />
She didn&#39;t respond. He still couldn&#39;t transform her to human, and she still tried to block the hearing and speech, but he continued to overpower that. &quot;Lisa, please! This is Ty! I love you! Let me bring you back!&quot;<br />
<br />
Still no response. He was tiring rapidly. He&#39;d never before had to use much exertion for his power, but had never had opposition before. It ws draining him of energy quickly. He didn&#39;t even want to think about what might happen if he used up ALL of his energy.<br />
<br />
And where was Lisa, as a cock, getting her energy? It could only be from him! Her efforts to oppose him were also using up his energy!<br />
<br />
&quot;Lisa! This is Ty! Please stop fighting me! I need you back!&quot; he called. If it didn&#39;t work this time, he wasn&#39;t sure he&#39;d be able to make another attempt. He was near collapse, and still she didn&#39;t respond, didn&#39;t let up on the fight. He was devestated, but determined to not give up.<br />
<br />
And then, suddenly, the resistance vanished.</p>
