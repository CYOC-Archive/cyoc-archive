<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jessica was watching what was happening and then remembered that the maternity dress had been donated by Maria Torey who was the Spanish teacher that had given birth about 6 months ago and that the baby was a girl. Jessica also remembered that Maria lives only a couple of blocks from the school.<br />
<br />
Jessica tells Matt to put the dress on and then she grabs a plastic baggie and which she had found in the pile then uses it to put the medallion in it. She then tells Matt that they are going to see Maria after she goes to the office. Jessica heads to the office and told the person working the counter that while sorting the clothing that she found some stuff of Maria&#39;s. She says that she know that Maria won&#39;t be back working for another six months. The worker asked her boss if it would be ok and he asked who it was that was asking ? <br />
<br />
The worker said that it is Jessica the boss says ok and that if she wouldn&#39;t mind that there is a couple other things that he was going to have take it to her later on. The boss then handed here a bag with some baby supplies and then says that she can take the rest of the school day off.<br />
<br />
Jessica and Matt had left the band room and then headed to Maria&#39;s place. Jessica and Matt had arrived at Maria&#39;s place about half hour later and Jessica told Matt to wait to come up to Maria&#39;s until she can fill Maria in on what had happened.<br />
<br />
It was about 5 minutes when Jessica came back and got Matt and then they are all in Maria&#39;s place.Jessica says that the medallion had  also changed Jake saying that he is the baby in Matt&#39;s belly when just then Amber started to cry so Maria asked to be excused for a minute so she can check on her daughter Amber. She then checks and finds that Amber is wet and then she figured that she might as well feed her.<br />
<br />
After she got back she tells them that she believes what Jessica had told her because she remembers stories told to her from her grandparents. She then says that the last time she wore that dress was the day before she had went into full labor that she had just about not made it into the hospital in time. She said that with Matt looking like me so much that Matt could use until she delivers the baby her sisters name. She then says she was one of the triplets, she then says that her sisters names are Matti and Maribelle. She then says that when Matti had came to  stay with her when she first had her baby that Matti told her that she had found out that she was pregnant and that she was 3 months pregnant.<br />
<br />
Jessica then says that Matt needs to find a place for Matt to stay until the baby is born. Maria then says that Matt can live her until the baby is born. Jessica then says that she will be back tomorrow because she needs to go home and get stuff done. Maria asked Jessica for her number because she will need to be ready to come over when Matt goes into full term labor.<br />
<br />
Maria tells Matt that s/he can stay in the guest room that her sister had stayed in. Maria remembered that her sister had forgotten some of her paper. She looks through and finds that there is a couple legal documents of the birth certificate  and also some other things.<br />
<br />
Matt tells Maria that he needs to go to the bathroom because he needs to pee, which Maria remembered that she was doing a lot it. She then noticed that the dress Matt is wearing has wet spots. Maria then tell Matt that where the bathroom is and then says that she will bring a nightie for Matt to wear  for the night, she then says that Matt you should also take a bath because his breast are leaking and it can cause a infection. Maria had also gotten Matt a bra and panties.<br />
<br />
Matt had did and then Maria told Matt that she has made supper. They eat and Maria told Matt that if things are going the same that you should go into labor fully around 3 a.m. so that Matt then goes into the guest room. Maria then remembered that she had bought earlier in the day 5  lottery tickets that the drawing is tonight.The jackpot is at $450,000,000 Maria finished up and then sat down and watched Television and she had noticed that it is about 2 hours before the drawing for the lottery.<br />
<br />
She watched and when the lottery numbers were drawn she wrote them down and when she checked the numbers she find that on the first ticket she had 2 numbers. It was when she checked her next couple of them that she had one with 3 numbers but it was when she checked the last ticket that she has all numbers. She then decided to call Jessica and to ask her to come stay with her that she needed to talk to her.<br />
<br />
Maria then had gotten the stuff for Matt to go to the hospital and set it next to the door. Right after Maria had finished Jessica arrived Maria asked Jessica that she knows that Matt should go into labor in a couple hours and that she doesn&#39;t want to have to take Amber out so early. She then says that she knows that she wants to go to college but that her family doesn&#39;t have the money to send her.<br />
<br />
She then says that in a couple weeks she will be coming into a large sum of money. She then says that she will set up a trust fund for her if she will become a nanny for her. She says that she will have to talk it over with her parents.<br />
<br />
It was now 3 A.M. and Matt says that her water broke. They Jessica helps Matt get dressed and then they make it to the hospital and Maria gets Matt checked in and saying that she will be paying the bill . Maria then calls Jessica and sees how things are going, Jessica says that she had to change Amber and  then feed her.<br />
<br />
Matt has delivered a baby</p>
