<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The witch had also dealt with John. She had followed him back to his home and had wasted no time punishing him. With a simple spell, she had rendered the stupid burglar naked, with only a diaper. John screamed with bewilderment at being naked, already stunned at seeing the witch enter his home as if it was nothing and she had the keys and his very address. She then made him enter a giant baby bouncer which went went up and down, the burglar forcibly stuffed in it and having no choice but to suffer a complete humiliation and uncomfortable situation. The witch, for her part, laughed heartily.<br />
&quot;Your friend is a now my pet frog. Your other pal will get his comeuppance, rest assured. But what for yourself?&quot;<br />
John pleaded for her to stop but it did not.<br />
&quot;Would you like to become a little mouse? Or a pig?&quot;<br />
Her prisoner screamed his fright at the prospect and begged for a mercy that did not come.<br />
&quot;Oh my, what a hairy chest and legs you have! You look like a gorilla! Or a monkey! What do you think? Would you like to be a monkey?&quot;<br />
Her prisoner would have made his disapproval clear but the baby swing gathered by magic more momentum, smacking his butt on the ground at each downward swing and in effect giving him a spanking. <br />
&quot;And what do we have here?&quot; the witch said as she looked around. <br />
She saw the piles of Playboy and other pornographic magazines. <br />
&quot;My, you are a lewd one, aren&#39;t you? You don&#39;t think much of women, do you? What would your mother say?&quot;<br />
John just swore at her and said that he was a real man and not a stupid faggot. The witch&#39;s eyes glinted mischievously. <br />
&quot;Think yourself a ladies&#39; man, do you? Not very kind,&quot; she tutted. &quot;You&#39;re obsessed by your genitals. Too much. You behave like a silly monkey indeed, but you don&#39;t have the excuse of being actually one. Maybe you&#39;ll be a bit more open with that little spell. You&#39;ll forget quickly being a sleazy ladies&#39; man. And you&#39;ll make a couple and a lot of people much happier than the miserable and mean idiot you are now.&quot;<br />
She cast her spell and John felt himself being blown away and falling down. When the world stopped spinning, the witch was looking above him, much bigger in proportion than normal. He screamed but only a high-pitched screech came out. He tried to get up but he only managed to flail his arms around. Arms that were covered in golden fur and with long, black and nimble fingers. He screeched more and the witch picked him up gently. She approached a mirror.<br />
&quot;Look at how cute you are now! You fit your inner image perfectly! And as a little baby you can finally grow up properly.&quot;<br />
John could see his long tale and little legs ending in hand-like feet. He could jerk only uncontrollably. The witch cast another spell and by magic a tiny diaper appeared on him again. She then laid him down and conjured up a bottle filled with milk, which magically thrust itself into his mouth. It refused to budge and he could only grasp and suck on it. He hated it but the magic was stronger. <br />
&quot;Enjoy your baba while I prepare your arrival to your new happy home,&quot; she said with a smile, tickling John on the tummy and making him giggle without control. <br />
She conjured up a box lined with soft hay and straw, with the sides lined with holes for breathing. She then wrote a message on a piece of paper and taped it to the lid of the box. <br />
&quot;&#39;Please take care of me, I don&#39;t have a mommy anymore&#39;,&quot; she recited. &quot;What do you think? I&#39;m sure your new family will be taken by that. They&#39;ll be so happy to take care of you!&quot;<br />
As John had finished his bottle, she tapped him on the back upon her shoulder. He burped, she laughed and then wrapped him in a pink blanket, settling him in the box with a little teddy bear and his bottle. <br />
&quot;You&#39;ll sleep soon, with that full belly. Be good for your new parents. But I now you will be,&quot; she smiled as she closed the box.<br />
John shifted feebly but between the warmth and his full tummy, his eyelids drooped and he was fast asleep in no time. He wetted his diaper without even realizing it. His new monkey subconscious wished for the chest of his mommy, invading the rest of his human mind.<br />
<br />
The zoo could not be happier. It was amazing! They had a male monkey couple who had attracted the attention of homosexual audiences but without a baby orphan of the same species, the smaller male of the couple, playfully called Ernie, felt distressed and did not understand why his belly did not bulge with new life. It was endearing but sad too. However, now it was over. Someone had left a baby of the same species at the gates of the zoo and just by seeing him through the glass of the cage, Ernie had exclaimed in joy, tapping the glass to reach the little darling he took an instant liking to. The baby was perfectly healthy and as the vet handed the new baby, called Cookie, Ernie reached out with his hands to grab his surrogate baby. Bert, his mate, had looked curiously but had kissed and tickled the new addition to their family. The tiny male had taken a liking to his new mommy and snuggled against his chest. He had even by reflex tried to suckle the chest of Ernie and the monkey let him, then taking the habit of giving him a bottle and purees. He liked to hold him close and loved nothing better than snuggling with his mate and his new little one. Papers and media catering to homosexual audiences gushed and debated about this modern family amongst the monkeys at the zoo. However, if the increased visitors brought welcome money to the zoo, the helpers and vets were just happy to see the three monkeys content and much more joyful.<br />
<br />
For Cookie, formerly John, things weren&#39;t as rosy. First, he hated the stupid name he had been bestowed with. Just because he had munched greedily on a cookie, sick as he was with milk and mushed fruits! Then, his two stupid so-called parents had just as ridiculous names! But worst of all was how the witch had cursed him with baby simian urges. He found himself happy to suckle from the other male monkey playing at being a mother and his two new parents tickling him was for his idiotic monkey mind a proof of love and affection, that he&#39;d never be alone. He was thinking that Ernie was like a mommy, replacing the one he had lost and that in fact had never existed! He saw the two monkeys mimicking the sexual act and his monkey self was not at all bothered by it! And when a female visitor stared at him through the glass and her cleavage was most revealing, he didn&#39;t care anymore! It didn&#39;t seem important anymore and the idea of touching his tiny dick appeared out of place. Even lesbians kissing in front of the glass held no arousal for him, when he loved these scenes back when he could read Playboys by the stack! Oh, and when his human mind finally took over again, he could remember how happy he was as a monkey, eating delicious fruits and milk, enjoying the occasional cookie treat and happy to indulge in simple fulfilling pleasures with two loving parents without the nonsense and worries of human life. Even the weird aliens staring at him weren&#39;t always very interesting. As a monkey, he didn&#39;t care as they gushed and exclaimed how adorable he was as Ernie tickled him playfully. And to think he had become a poster baby for the gay!... And it was getting harder to recall how being a human was, so dependant he was on the care of his two fathers. <br />
As his human mind emerged from his monkey mind slowly, he recalled the visitors coming through the day. With shame, he remembered some high school jocks pointing at him and making fun of him, exclaiming he&#39;d become a monkey faggot and that he was probably a reincarnated stupid fag. He wanted to cry at the recalled insults. It almost made him forget the visitor right next to them, with a familiar crooked smile and bun. This one had smiled at him a little mischievously but not in a mean way. And he had found a giant chocolate cookie under the hay of the cage that evening! Now John remembered clearly the witch had decided to pay him a visit. Damon and Chris! He had not thought of them in such a long time! What curse had befallen them?  Was he the lucky one, in the end? Still, the insults of jocks made him want to cry but as monkeys cannot, then he sniffed with his arm against his face. Sensing trouble, Ernie picked him up and cuddled and poked him. Engulfed by his love, Damon was powerless to resist sliding back into a monkey mindset and his last coherent thought as a human were the regret of not having robbed the witch and the hope that maybe she&#39;d punish those mean jocks.</p>
