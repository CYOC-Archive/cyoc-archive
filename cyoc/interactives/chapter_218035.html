<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Follow me, Miss Taylor.” Said the nurse as she led Taylor through the lobby and to the elevator. <br />
<br />
In a few minutes she found herself stripping down to the nude and hiding her “manhood” behind a bath robe. She hated looking at the mistake she had been born with but with hope that would soon be gone, and she would be what she had always been in her heart a woman.<br />
<br />
“Alright, the first phase takes a few hours and requires you to rest in a special tank.” Said the nurse as Taylor was led down the hallway from her room. <br />
<br />
The room she entered looked almost like a spa not a hospital medical room. There where multiple bathtubs like items only they had removable lids on either side of them.<br />
<br />
“Please get in this one.” Said the nurse as Taylor removed her robes and got into the tank. It had to be at least 9 feet long and filled with some type of liquid which smells weird to her. She laid down as the bottom of the tank rose up and conformed to her back. Over the course of the next couple of minutes she had a breathing mask strapped onto her face and a pair of glasses (which reminded her of tanning glasses) over her eyes. <br />
<br />
“Now relax, maybe try to get some sleep and I will see you in a few hours.” Said the nurse as she gave her two large shots before closing the top of the tank as more of the liquid was put into the tank.<br />
<br />
Taylor didn’t know what she was suppose to do, she saw only darkness and she was resting in a tank of liquid. <br />
<br />
Then before she knew it, the lid opened up and the glasses were taken off from her eyes and she took her first breath of actual air.<br />
<br />
“Relax.” said the nurse as Taylor’s eyes blinked. “You are coming out of an anesthesia.”<br />
<br />
“How long have I been under?” asked Taylor<br />
<br />
“12 hours.” answered the nurse as Taylor’s eyes widened as she looked down at herself. Her hopes where dashed, she still had the flat chest of a man and could see her manhood, she was still a man. The changes however were easy to see her skin had turned pure snow white and her body was totally hairless now aside from the hair which brushed the back of her neck and the bangs she could see. <br />
<br />
That was wrong, her hair hadn’t been that long.<br />
<br />
“Here, have a look.” Said the nurse as she held up a mirror. The face looked the same, however her skin was pure snow white while her eyes had turned a shade of purple which was unnaturally beautiful yet slightly offsetting as well. Her hair had gone from brown to a shade of purple and her lips were a darker purple. The combination made her pop out, her fingernails and toenails had also changed to a natural deep dark purple even her nipples were now purple.  <br />
<br />
“Alright, let’s get you back to the room and let you rest, tomorrow you go back in.,” said the nurse.<br />
<br />
And so she did.<br />
<br />
The follow day, she went back into the tank and once again was knocked out. <br />
<br />
She woke up to find more changes had happened.<br />
<br />
Her skin had become somehow whiter making the colors of her hair, lips and most of all her eyes pop even more. Her frame had narrowed a bit her arms and legs grew longer and more elegant. Yet she was still a man and her chest remained flat.<br />
<br />
The 3rd day she entered and came out far shapelier, her ass became heart shape, her neck elongated, and her hair now reached the small of her back. Her legs and arms where now fully a women, to the point that if someone was looking at her from behind one would think she was a women, a very hot women at that. She was still just as tall as ever, she may have actually grown a little bit taller making her a very tall women, taller than most men in fact.<br />
<br />
The 4th day was when the changes she really was looking forward to begin. Her face became fully feminine, her eyes larger, her lips fuller, her face sexy to the point that it would models lustful. Her stomach slimmed down becoming a sexy core as her hips widened as well. New muscles had And most importantly two small budding breasts began to form on her chest.<br />
<br />
She went to sleep that night hugging them with a smile on her face.<br />
<br />
On the fifth day, her breasts had grown to a size which caused her to smile while her manhood was still there it was tiny and almost totally gone. The real change, however, came as a pair of long graceful horns had grown from the top of her head arching backwards forming an almost S shape along the top of her head. The horns were a dark purple color which somehow looked darker than her purple hair which had grown to reach the small of her back. Her teeth had fallen out and in their place a pair of fangs had grown in and unless she was imagining it her tongue also seamed longer. Finally, a long thin almost graceful tail had grown out of her tail bone coming to a classic spade shape point which was also a purple color. <br />
<br />
On the sixth day she exited the tank and looked down as tears of joys began to flow from her eyes, there finally after all these years was a beautiful feminine slit between her legs instead of a horrible cock and balls. She didn’t even care that the nurse was there as she reached down and touched her new women hood.<br />
<br />
“It’s alright to be emotional.” said the nurse “Just don’t get busy here. Your done with the change, lets get you in front of mirror so you can fully see yourself.”<br />
<br />
“Alright.” said Taylor her voice trembling as she was led to a full body mirror. Tears were still in her now purple eyes as she looked at herself. Her flawless pure snow-white skin, her long purple hair and gorgeous purple eyes. A pair of elegant horns and a graceful tail, large but not too large breasts, and ass to die and most important of all, she was finally a woman, not just in her mind and heart but her body as well. She was a woman and a beautiful woman on top of that.<br />
<br />
“Now get some rest, tomorrow we will begin orientation and the costume department will come by to get your measurements to begin work.” said the Nurse. “Then in a day or two housing will settle you in and you can begin your training.”<br />
<br />
Taylor didn’t really hear her; she was too busy crying tears of joy.</p>
