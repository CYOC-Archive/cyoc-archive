<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">….GYM CLASS!<br />
Jen wasn’t very athletic before and loathed going to gym despite her peers enjoying the chance to get out of class study’s and getting physical to burn some stress off. Not that the coach gave her a hard time he was actually cool.<br />
<br />
But now as a very male Egyptian god Joe was actually looking forward to see what his new body could do, besides being buff and over 7 and a half meters would definitely give some sort of advantage.<br />
<br />
Digging his gym clothes out of his tiny backpack Joe pulled out a purple and black jockstrap with silver highlights and a jackal face jewel encrusted image at the crotch  similar to the briefs, silky red gym shorts with golden stripes running down the sides and royal blue outlines of feral Jackal’s sitting in profile around the pant legs. <br />
<br />
There was also a silky royal blue shirt with the same etchings of jackals in red around the bottom helm with bold golden Egyptian hieroglyphs spelling Anubis on the front and an image of Anubis wearing only a loincloth in a posing position showing off a muscular physique on the back. <br />
<br />
There was also a red and green sweatband with a colorful jeweled scarab at the front and entwining silver serpents in the back. “Looks like even clothes meant for getting dirty had to be decadent for a god.” Joe thought, tho not that he minded getting the best of the best <br />
<br />
Walking towards the girls section of the shower dressing rooms with his gym clothes in hand, Joe almost entered till he remembered he’s no long female. He quickly turned around a made a dash for the boys section shyly.<br />
<br />
Walking through the door Joe thought “Well I’m a guy now so try not to think of this as awkward.” As he made his way towards a available locker and disrobed without looking to much at the other naked lads <br />
<br />
Quickly dressing into the fancy gym attire in the boys shower dressing room, Joe couldn’t help but notice some side eye glances at him from the guys, some of admiration others of envy and a few of lust. Joe wondered if this situation was ok as his body was basically a fully grown man’s despite still having a teenaged girls mind. Once fully clothed he hurriedly paced to the gym auditorium and joined his fellow classmates waiting for the gym teacher.<br />
<br />
In walked Coach Kieth looking rather dapper in his salmon pink tracksuit emphasizing his well built bod, black running shoes, square sunglasses, combed mustache and side fade haircut and a clipboard in hand. “ALL RIGHT CLASS” he hollered out “TODAY WE ARE GOING TO DO A FEW LAPS AROUND THE FIELD TO TEST YOUR STAMINA” his loud voice reverberating in the auditorium<br />
<br />
“THEN WE’RE GOING TO CLIMB ROPES FOR ENDURANCE” he says as he walk along the line of tweens and teens and one giant jackal man as he reads the clipboard “AFTER THAT WE END WITH WRESTLING TO TEST STRENGTH ANY QUESTIONS?”<br />
<br />
Nobody said anything either because they didn’t care or pretty much understood what the agenda for todays gym workout was. Joe on the other hand was to apprehensive to speak up, before as Jen he would make an excuse to dodge gym activity’s but now as Joe Anubis Smith he couldn’t realistically say he had cramps or had a visit from aunt flow.<br />
<br />
“That’s too bad Mr. Keith was always cool with me skipping class even when he knew I was lying most of the time.” Joe mentally mused <br />
<br />
It wasn’t so much the physical stuff he was concerned with, this muscular body can’t just be for show after all. It was the actual skills he lacked and some basic rules and some depth perception, dodgeball proved that more then once.<br />
<br />
While he was stressing out, Joe almost didn’t notice he was getting hard again, thankfully his jock held it in place so the bulge wasn’t to noticeable but he did feel a little self-conscious about it.<br />
<br />
Then he felt divine power leaking out of his dick as it flowed out of his shorts leggings and wafted up towards his head and entered his ears. For a moment Joe felt dizzy as the magic filled his head full of knowledge on all sport activities, his eyes widened with knowing as he now knew how to catch a football and kick a soccer ball, hit a home-run and dunk a basketball, use a tennis racket or just sprint.<br />
<br />
The magic finished and his dick softened once more. Now armed with everything he needed to ace this class he strides towards the field with the coach practically leading the class out with him<br />
<br />
The running test was a breeze since his huge legs made short work of the few laps around the field. The robe climbing was also easy but Joe’s rope was higher up to accommodate his stature than the normal sized students in the auditorium.<br />
<br />
 Then came the wrestling part, all  of the class was paired with one an other but since no one was as large as Joe he had to make do with an equally large dummy and since it couldn’t fight back Coach Keith instead instructed to only perform certain moves and he would judge the form.<br />
<br />
Joe took his shirt off for this, walking up to the dummy in only his gym shorts. He didn’t feel weird being shirtless in front of everybody like he thought he would. The coach yelled out a position and he took it, then a offensive grab which he followed, then a defensive stance that he executed perfectly <br />
<br />
Having this new knowledge in his head was awesome, it was like he studied every book and watched every sports game. Without even trying he already knew what to do and how to do it, He was actually enjoying gym for once. His tail was waging furiously despite how sweaty and stinky he was.<br />
<br />
Gym period was ending soon and Mr. Keith graded everyone with passing marks and sent them to the showers. Joe grabbed his shirt off the floor and headed for the lockers, dropping his shorts and jock and tucking them with his shirt in a bag, he grabbed a towel and walked to the nearest shower stall confidently nude enjoying the feeling of his manhood now on display wagging back and forth like his tail from the walking movement.<br />
<br />
He washed and scrubbed for a few minutes enjoying the refreshing water and the nice Egyptian soap smell, once he was done he rinsed off and shook like a dog getting as much  water of his body as he could before using the towel to dry up. He considered playing with his cock for a moment eyeing the girthy rod and lengthy foreskin but decided against it.<br />
<br />
“Gotta have some self control.” He says to himself. Pulling his briefs back on he grabbed a brush and stroked his fur smooth befor putting on his black shorts and tanktop, taking a look in the mirror his golden yellow eyes studied his form and approved. Walking out of the showers and exiting the building Joe was greeted by a few admirers.<br />
<br />
“Hey man you were on fire today!” said one <br />
<br />
“Yeah you’re a complete beast dude!” said another<br />
 <br />
“ Senpai would you consider joining our clubs!” said a few<br />
<br />
“Hey I appreciate the love guys but I need to head to my next class” Joe says nervously flattered “Why don’t you find me during recess and I’ll hear you all out ok?” He says walking away with a polite wave <br />
<br />
“Wow I didn’t know being an athlete would make me so popular…” Joe thought as he walked through the corridor’s carefully as not to step on the smaller students “…I’ll be sure to stay humble.” He says with smirk <br />
<br />
The oversized jackal man walked to his next class which was…</p>
