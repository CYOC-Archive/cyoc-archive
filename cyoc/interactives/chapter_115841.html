________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________<br />
<br />
Imagine this.  It&#39;s a beautiful day out.  Not a cloud in the sky, birds are chirping, and there is a gentle breeze, causing the air to be a perfect temperature.  As the day approaches the late morning, the quiet town of Newham&#39;s market is busy.  People are all there stocking up for the week.  The market is always busy on a Saturday.  After all, people do not work on Sundays.  All of the sudden, a small, white, fluffy cloud appears in the sky.  It leaves a beautiful juxtaposition between itself and the sky.  After another minute, another white, fluffy cloud joins in.  Then another, and another, and another.  Within five minutes, the whole sky is full of these clouds.  But, they are nice, pretty, white, fluffy clouds.  Nothing to be alarmed about.  Yet, people are starting to look at the sky.  This isn&#39;t natural, they all thought.  People stopped what they were doing, and looked up.  Maybe a storm was brewing.  People didn&#39;t know the answers.  In fact, there were only two beings that knew what was happening.  Rowan overlooked the small town on a cliff near it as you snapped your fingers.  As you did, the clouds burst into dark, sinister black flames, and hurdled themselves down at the town.  Buildings were burning, people were frying, and you were laughing.  You hurdled your winged body towards the town, listening to the screams of the townsfolk.  Music to your ears.  You held your finger up to the sky, shooting a massive bolt of pure blackness straight up, letting the world know that the Angel of Death has left his mark on Newham.  To end it all, you brought your hand back down, causing a massive, black explosion centered on yourself.  The town of Newham, population 1,484, was reduced to ash, dust, and a crater.  You stood in the center, laughing evilly.  It took no effort to annihilate the town.  Soon, though, you felt the presence of two more beings.  They were a couple coming home to Newham from the city close by.  They wanted to make sure their loved ones were okay.  You knew they were not, and this couple wouldn&#39;t be either.  With a simple hand gesture, you became invisible to those who couldn&#39;t detect magical presences.  You laughed as they fell to their knees and cried at the edge of the crater you created.  To cheer them up, you approached them and made your presence known to them.  &quot;Are you responsible for this?&quot;  The woman screamed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes.&quot;  You laughed.  &quot;Is there a problem?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes you monster!&quot;  The man yelled, drawing a sword.  &quot;I&#39;ll kill you!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not so fast.&quot;  You smiled an evil grin.  You put your hand forward, holding the man in place.  &quot;You won&#39;t be killing anyone anytime soon.&quot;  You laughed as a small ball of black energy formed in your other hand.  &quot;Watch closely.&quot;  You laughed as you released the ball, sending it toward the woman.<br />
<br />
&quot;ANGELICA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&quot;  He screamed as the ball made contact with the woman, causing her to keel over and die.  There were no marks on her body, no wounds or anything.  The small ball sucked her life force straight out of her.  &quot;YOU MONSTER!  WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS!!&quot;  He screamed, crying over the loss of his wife.<br />
<br />
&quot;The answer is simple.&quot;  You laughed.  &quot;My master wants me to.&quot;  You smiled as you raised the man into the air.  &quot;Before I kill you, I&#39;d just like to correct you on one little detail.  Calling me a monster is no way to treat the Angel of Death, is it?&quot;  You laughed as you closed your fist, causing the man to explode in a black fireball.  &quot;I guess I should clean up this mess...&quot;  You said, kicking the woman&#39;s corpse out of your way.  You lifted it up effortlessly as you started to make it disappear from existence.  Rowan soon approached, clapping his hands.<br />
<br />
&quot;Excellent work Gannoth.&quot;  Rowan smiled an evil smile.  &quot;How are you doing right now?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Honestly Master?  I couldn&#39;t feel better if I tried.&quot;  You answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;How long have you been in the Angel of Death form?&quot;  Rowan asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;At least 3 hours, and I barely feel fatigued at all!&quot;  You smiled.  &quot;Before this ring, after thirty minutes I was ready to collapse.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;These rings are truly amazing.&quot;  Rowan chuckled, running his hands through his smooth, dark auburn hair, playing with the white strands.  &quot;I cannot thank Archdemon Zebulon enough.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Speaking of him, just how powerful is he?&quot;  You asked.  &quot;He seemed to powerful to comprehend.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s because he is.&quot;  Rowan started.  &quot;Picture it like this.  Comparing my power to his is like comparing a leaf with a forest.  He is as powerful as the Gods.  The only reason why he still hasn&#39;t overthrown them is that he alone is not strong enough to face all of them at once.  Even so, he could bend the universe to his will if he desired.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And he said that you&#39;re destined to be even stronger than him?&quot;  You asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I have trouble believing it.  Not even I can comprehend having that much power.&quot;  Rowan laughed.  &quot;Yet, he himself said so.  Zebulon is infallible.  He&#39;s never wrong.  Plus, do you think someone of his kind of authority and position would make a claim like that without knowing if it is true or not?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You make a fair point.&quot;  You nodded, agreeing with your master.  &quot;Master.  If you become that powerful, what would I do?  I would be unnecessary to someone of that power.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Gannoth.  Never say you&#39;ll be unnecessary.&quot;  Rowan responded quickly and sternly.  &quot;When I am that strong, you will be too.  Maybe not quite at my level, but still quite close.  All rulers need their right hand.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you Master.&quot;  You smiled, wrapping an arm around Rowan&#39;s shoulders.  &quot;Let&#39;s destroy a bigger city next.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Indeed.  Let&#39;s do that.&quot;  Rowan laughed as he formed two demonic wings on his back, allowing him to fly as well.  The two of you flew up into the air, and proceeded to find another town to blow up.  The country you were currently terrorizing, Kitria, was much larger than Firenze.  This would be an all day event, considering you wanted to have some fun with it.  Eventually, you made it to the town of Gansboro.  Rowan made quick work of it.  One wave of the hands, and the whole 4,000 person city was reduced to ash by Rowan&#39;s lightning storm.  You learned quite quickly that the rings strengthened both your physical and magic power immensely.  Rowan, who was quite strong before, now was punching stone houses down like they were paper.  Your dragon form, on the other hand, had physical might comparable only to the strongest of dragons.  You felt like you could move a mountain!  You knew Rowan could magically.  Eventually, after exploding many small towns and cities, you made it to Rivervale, the capital city of Kitria.  It was massive.  You and Rowan walked into the city, causing people to scream in fear.  After all, you were still going strong as the Angel of Death, and Rowan looked like a demon.  The screams of the mortals was again, like music to your ears.  You flew straight up as Rowan took out his swords.  They were bathed in pure black energy.  Rowan made a couple of slashes with them, causing beams of blackness to spread, cutting everything in their path.  Just like Firenze, everything that was cut glowed black before exploding.  Meanwhile, you were in a different part of town.  You took a vastly different approach to destroying the town.  You switched to your phoenix form, a form you&#39;ve never actually used.  You transformed into a large, majestic bird, completely on fire.  Your ring was on one of your talons.  You flew around, causing everything around you to catch on fire.  This fire quickly spread throughout the whole city.  Unlike normal fire though, this fire caused explosions.  Soon, a full quarter of the city was pure ash, thanks to you.  Using more fire tricks, including fire balls and fire breath, you burned through the large market in the city, charring food and people alike.  Once you were done, you switched back into the Angel of Death and headed to the castle of the king.  Rather than be stopped by the guards, you immediately killed them.  They didn&#39;t even have a chance to fight.  Unlike the King of Firenze, the King of Kitria had a trick up his sleeve.  When you entered the castle, you were greeted by a line of wizards.  &quot;Halt evildoer!&quot;  The one in the middle, clearly the leader, yelled at you.  They didn&#39;t seem frightened by your appearance, which pissed you off slightly.<br />
<br />
&quot;No.&quot;  You laughed.  You could kill all of these guys with one finger, but you decided to have some fun.  You also felt Rowan&#39;s presence very close by.  &quot;Master.  I&#39;m in the castle.&quot;  You told him telepathically.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay.  I&#39;ll be there in a bit.&quot;  Rowan responded.  You could tell he was slashing through many guards.<br />
<br />
&quot;If you refuse to cooperate, we will be forced to attack.&quot;  The leader of the wizards stated.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay then.  Attack!&quot;  You laughed.  They didn&#39;t realize their mistake.  They all shot attacks of varying elements at you.  There was fire, lightning, water, ice, air, and more!  All of them hit you at once.  The attacks caused a large cloud of dust to cover you, making you completely unseen to them.  &quot;Did you really think that would work against the Angel of Death?&quot;  You laughed.  &quot;Next time, try harder.&quot;  They did.  You could tell that you were just hit by everything they had.  It still did absolutely nothing.  &quot;Okay, I&#39;m not going to kill you yet, because I want my Master to witness it.  Wait here for a bit.&quot;  You laughed as you held the wizards in place.  Causing immobility was one of your favorite magical techniques.<br />
<br />
After a couple of minutes, the dust cloud cleared and Rowan arrived.  &quot;Master!  I wanted you to witness this one.&quot;  You smiled as you created a large sword of pure black energy.  &quot;These guys hit me with everything they had at once.  As you can see, not a scratch on me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well done Gannoth.  Finish them off.&quot;  Rowan laughed evilly.  You walked up to the terrified wizards, laughing at their terror filled faces.<br />
<br />
&quot;Goodbye.&quot;  You grinned as you swung your sword, causing the heads of all the wizards to topple off of their bodies.  Both you and Rowan had a decent amount of bloodstains in your clothes, but that just made you look even more intimidating.  Rowan walked passed the headless corpses, and down the hall with you.  Soon, you met a pair of double doors.  Rowan walked up to the doors, and using his newfound physical strength, knocked them off their hinges.  It was the throne room, and the King was sitting there.<br />
<br />
&quot;Greetings Your Majesty.&quot;  Rowan taunted.  &quot;I am Lord Rowan Tyrell, honorary Demon Lord, and current destroyer of Kitria.  This is Gannoth, my loyal familiar.  Although right now, he goes by the Angel of Death.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Please don&#39;t kill me.&quot;  The king begged, cowering in his throne.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh the fear of mortals.  Nothing makes me happier than mortals cowering in fear.&quot;  Rowan laughed.<br />
<br />
&quot;The only thing that makes me happier is watching those mortals perish.&quot;  You added.<br />
<br />
&quot;King of Kitria, do you have any last words?&quot;  Rowan asked, preparing some magic.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve lived a good life.  I served my country well, and I have no regrets.&quot;  The king sobbed.  &quot;Do your worst Demon.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;With pleasure.&quot;  Rowan laughed as he forced the king to appear directly in front of him.  Holding him in the air, Rowan took out his sword and stabbed the king in the stomach.  Blood poured out from the man before the sword started to glow black.  He then exploded in a ball of black energy.  &quot;Ready to watch Kitria crumble Gannoth?&quot;  Rowan asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;More than ever.&quot;  You answered laughing evilly.  You and Rowan flew through the roof of the castle, high into the sky.  Soon, you were on the border of Kitria.  Rowan prepared a large ball of purple energy, and did the same move he used to destroy all of Firenze at once on Kitria.  Walls of purple energy closed in on the country, before causing the whole place to erupt into a pillar of black and purple swirling energy.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know Gannoth?  I don&#39;t mind being a demon.&quot;  Rowan laughed.<br />
<br />
&quot;And I don&#39;t mind being the Angel of Death.&quot;  You laughed alongside your master.  It&#39;s been eight hours, and you still felt fine in your Angel of Death form.  Despite this, you transformed back into your dragon form.  Rowan created the saddle, and you flew back to the castle.  It was dinner time, and you were hungry.<br />
