<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">A flash of sunlight glinting off metal caught Sherri's eye as she fumbled with the car door. Something bright was lying in the street behind her car. She got the door
<br>
 open and dumped the box she was carrying into the passenger seat before walking over to see what it was. 
<br>

<br>

<br>
 It looked like junk. Round, yellow metal, shiny. She knew better than to think she'd find a piece of gold in the street but a small hope flared still. Whatever it was,
<br>
 the thing might be worth something, a little money so she bent down to retrieve it. It seemed to be some sort of medal or charm, old and worn but bright, like it had
<br>
 been polished recently. A fine gold chain was attached. She turned it over in her hands, inspecting it as she walked back and climbed into the car. 
<br>

<br>

<br>
 She could ask down at the consignment shop; maybe somebody there could tell her if it was worth anything. In the meantime, she had no place to put it so she
<br>
 slipped the chain around her neck. Now that she had it on, she had to check herself out in the rear-view mirror. It didn't look so bad on her, certainly not as gaudy
<br>
 as she'd thought it would be. She let her gaze linger on her face. A pretty face looked back at her, pretty but plump. She knew all too well that her body matched
<br>
 the face. She'd been a looker about 40 pounds ago, 40 pounds that she'd desperately love to lose but couldn't, not in a world of macaroni and cheese dinners and
<br>
 corn chips. 
<br>

<br>

<br>
 Sighing, she positioned the box of doll clothes more securely on the seat next to her. The shop had called and said they were ready for a new batch. That meant
<br>
 they'd sold most of the last lot and there'd be a much-needed check waiting. Sales went in spurts; her handmade Barbie clothes would sit unwanted for months on
<br>
 the shelf and then some grandma would come in and buy half the stock for her little favorite. 
<br>

<br>

<br>
 The medallion swung out into her view as Sherri leaned over the seat and she spotted a smudge on one side. For some reason she found that annoying so she
<br>
 reached over to pick out a tiny flannel shirt from the box and lightly polish the metal surface with a miniature sleeve. As she did, a quick charge surged through her,
<br>
 like a mild, not painful electric shock. Startled, she dropped the shirt. When she reached down to get it, she was startled again to see that her nails were now red.
<br>
 They hadn't been painted a minute ago: nail polish cost money. 
<br>

<br>

<br>
 Sherri felt fear rise in her throat as she inspected her hands. They were different, much different, fingers longer, more delicate. She brushed her long hair back in a
<br>
 unconscious motion. Long hair? Long blond hair? She'd had dark hair all her life, cut shoulder length for years. Her fear was transforming to terror. Choking down
<br>
 a sob, she grabbed her box of doll clothes, crawled out of the car and stumbled back into the house. 
<br>

<br>

<br>
 Once inside the door, she realized she was still carrying the box. Feeling like a fool, she dropped it on the floor and made her way to her bedroom, to look in the
<br>
 full-length mirror hanging on the door. 
<br>

<br>

<br>
 A stranger stared back at her. Not a total stranger, the face was recognizably hers, although younger, slimmer. Her eyes were wider than they had been and deep
<br>
 blue, not their former brown. But the big changes were to her body. 
<br>

<br>

<br>
 She was taller by several inches. Her pants and sleeves were much too short. Although too small, her clothes fit loosely now, at least most places. They hung
<br>
 baggily around her newly slender frame. The only place where the fabric clung tightly was around her bust. Everything had slimmed, it seemed, except her breasts.
<br>
 She closed her eyes and took a deep breath, then another. This is a crazy dream, she told herself, you're imagining this. But when she open her eyes, the same
<br>
 blue-eyed blond woman looked back from the mirror. 
<br>

<br>

<br>
 Sherri's heart pounded. What had happened to her? Or maybe, what was still happening to her? It seemed to her that her shirt sleeve was crawling down her arm.
<br>
 Her pants legs were dropping down her legs. The fabric of her shirt was not as tight around her breasts. As she watched in horror, her feet disappeared beneath
<br>
 the pants legs, then the pants themselves slipped from her waist, tumbling into a heap around her bare legs. Her shirt was grotesquely large now, reaching to her
<br>
 knees, then starting to pile up on the collapsed pants. 
<br>

<br>

<br>
 A wail escaped her lips as the stranger in the mirror shrank before her eyes. The stranger looked back at her with a terrified expression, her eyes locked onto
<br>
 Sherri's at an even level even as she shrank and Sherri knew that the stranger was her. 
<br>

<br>

<br>
 In less than a minute it was over. Only her head peeked out of the pile of clothes heaped on the floor by the mirror. She clambered out and numbly gazed at what
<br>
 she had become. Thin, pretty, blond; legs astonishingly long and slender, waist impossibly small. And tiny. If it weren't for the heap of discarded clothing she was
<br>
 standing on, she wouldn't be able to see herself entirely: the few inches below the bottom of the mirror would have been that significant. 
<br>

<br>

<br>
 Sherri looked away, looked up and around at her suddenly new surroundings, her own bedroom magnified out of recognition. Over and over she asked herself
<br>
 what had happened, what had she become? She clamped her teeth shut, not daring to moan, to sob, not daring to make a sound that would turn into a scream that
<br>
 she knew wouldn't stop. 
<br>

<br>

<br>
 She looked in the mirror a final time. The stranger there was a little less strange; she was a little more comfortable with her new self. She was even a little familiar
<br>
 with her new self; she recognized her face and even her altered body. She knew that body, she abruptly realized. She knew its proportions, its sizes, its
<br>
 measurements, all too well. She'd made clothes for that body, all sorts of outfits, fancy and everyday outfits, sewing them by hand and by machine, making tiny
<br>
 costumes for sale in the consignment shop. A box of clothes just her size lay just where she had dropped it inside her front door, a long walk away. 
<br>

<br>

<br>
 As the living doll stared into her own eyes, they reddened, and she began to silently weep.</p>
