<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff clicked on Comedy and then pulled up his the nerd Tony on the screen.<br />
<br />
There was a list of things that Jeff could click on that would be quite comical. These populated based on the <br />
individual. Some were anthropomorphic and some were just exaggeration of the current form. There were even <br />
some inanimate but Jeff rolled over them quickly.<br />
<br />
Jeff went down and saw that Tony, even though he was Italian, had a quite small penis. He pulled up options on <br />
penis size and seeing Italian Stallion he clicked on that and hit enter.<br />
<br />
At that moment Tony was with his girlfriend Elizabeth and they were in the throws of love making. Even though <br />
The change was going through Tony it was Elizabeth that felt the change most. Tony's penis grew and grew until <br />
she was in agony. Tony on the other hand was feeling quite excited and didn't even notice his girlfriends <br />
discomfort.<br />
<br />
When he finally came it was a soothing torrent of cum flooding her even though she was spread wider than <br />
anyone had ever been spread. When Tony exited and rolled over he saw the flag pole sticking straight up. Even <br />
though he was exhausted by his exertions. He noticed one thing. The condom he had been wearing was exploded. <br />
It wrapped around the base of his penis like a rubber cock ring and kept the blood in his 2 foot penis. Tony <br />
grabbed for scissors to cut it off. When he was free he saw Elizabeth next to him, eyes bugging out her twat <br />
bloated with his cum and not an ounce leaking out of it. Somehow a mucus plug has sealed it inside of her and <br />
she just looked at her belly looking 9 months pregnant.<br />
<br />
Elizabeth and Tony tried to douche it out and push it out as best they could but it remained for 24 hours. <br />
When it finally came out she was not only pregnant she was extremely pregnant. More than a dozen babies were <br />
growing inside of her.<br />
<br />
Tony being scared by the massive amounts of children he had fathered with Elizabeth didn't stop him from <br />
having sex with many others including Mrs. Anderson. She and her husband were unable to have children and Tony  <br />
was exuding pheromones that drew women and some men to him. When Class was over Mrs. Anderson asked Tony to <br />
stay and she attacked him and within minutes she was massively pregnant with Tony's children. She wanted to be <br />
pregnant and even though her husband wasn't the father he also wanted children and didn't care that they <br />
weren't his.<br />
<br />
Many many children were fathered by Tony that year but the most strange one was when he was at the gym. It was <br />
late and a muscle man was laying face down on a bench lifting weights. Tony hadn't had sex in over a week and <br />
his libido was such that he couldn't hold back. Now Tony wasn't gay, he wasn't even bi and neither was the <br />
muscle guy Allen but Tony looked at the guys muscled ass and rammed home. Allen took a deep breath and tried <br />
to roll off and dislodge Tony from his back side but he had tied to Allen and he came quickly blocking the <br />
exit with a mucus plug. Having not had sex in over a week Allen soon became pregnant, his chest becoming <br />
flabby and filled with milk. Tony had sex with other men after that night thinking to himself that even though <br />
he isn't gay that men couldn't get pregnant so it would be a safer outlet. It was months later that he found <br />
out that Allen was pregnant and that scared him but no other men became pregnant after Allen.<br />
<br />
Tony was racing to the hospital to help in Elizabeth's labor when he had a car wreck. He broke so many bones <br />
in his body that he was in a full body cast and in traction. For weeks he was unable to relieve himself. <br />
Eventually a month passed and his balls has swollen to the size of basket balls. They kept swelling when one <br />
night they exploded and when the nurse found him his testicals were dead and they rushed him to the operating <br />
room and sewed up his ball sack.<br />
<br />
He found out that Elizabeth as well as Mrs. Anderson had their babies by the time he was out of the hospital <br />
but what was more astonishing was that the babies reproductive organs were so developed that they impregnated <br />
their own mothers on the way out and soon they were full with new babies. Each one had children over and over <br />
for the next ten years. Tony had hundreds of children and now his children were having children. The women <br />
couldn't close their vagina it was so loose but Allen's ass was now so wide black men were amazed by his <br />
booty. Allen only had three litters of kids at over a dozen each his 48 children were quite a labor to him but <br />
he was no longer able to work out. All that testosterone coursing through his body during pregnancy made his <br />
beard extremely thick and course and his chest hear was like a thick mat with only a thing line going down to <br />
his overly furry crotch. The one thing that the testosterone didn't do was make him have a big dick. It even <br />
shrunk due to these pregnancies. Partly due to the fat added to his body from the babies but mostly because it <br />
was feeding the testosterone to his babies. His milk jugs kept producing milk even through the furry chest and <br />
would continue to produce milk indefinitely.<br />
<br />
Jeff watched the changes occur over the months and was laughing his ass off.</p>
