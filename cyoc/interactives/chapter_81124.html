<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">She scanned the crowd as she tried to decide who was best to pick.  Both of her last selections, Tim and Doug, had been less than willing, so it seemed only fair to give someone what they wanted.  Or as best as the Madame would allow.<br />
<br />
To be sure she got the right type of person, she asked, &quot;Now as you should know, coming up here almost ensures you won't leave... as you are now.&quot;<br />
<br />
The warning had the effect of culling half the raised hands but many still remained.  From them, she picked the one seemingly most deserving.  He ran up in an instant and was already pawing at his own belt buckle.<br />
<br />
&quot;And what would your name be, fine sir?&quot; she asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Names Frank.&quot;  He said gruffly, eying Doug with hungry eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;And Frank, you know that you'll end up losing this lovely skin of yours, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Turn my into a bunny guy, I don't care.  Then I'll just get to fuck this little peach all day and all night.&quot;  and the crowd roared, the Madame smirked and Doug gulped gathered sorrow.<br />
<br />
He was big, nearly six foot five, and broad with the definite air of the farm around him.  He was in his mid-thirties but could have been older from the worn look he wore.  Rough stubble, plaid shirt, jeans and boots; Doug was really wishing he had chosen to stay male.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, we'll see about that but I did promise you a blowjob from lovely rabbit girl, didn't I?&quot;  She said, winking at him slyly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure did,&quot; and he undid his belt bucket, shaped like a bull, and was ready to unzip when Madame's hand stopped him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now Frank, that's her job.  Let her unleash the beast.&quot;  Frank smiled at that and beckoned Doug over with his eyes.<br />
<br />
Doug resisted and would have ran had the stagehands not still been so close at hand.  First it was just Frank's eyes but then the Madame, growing impatient, was staring.  An urge was growing in him, probably of foreign influence, to obey and it was his feet that began to move before he realized it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Animals don't walk.  Crawl over here,&quot; Frank demanded.  With trepidation, and Madame's stare, Doug went to hands and knees and crawled over until he was right at him.<br />
<br />
&quot;That's a good girl,&quot; Madame said, petting Doug's hair.  &quot;Now, do your duty.&quot;<br />
<br />
Doug had never had a gay experience and never had a desire for one.  He never thought, or wanted, to be in this position but there he was anyway.  His hands, moved by that same urge that brought him over, went up to Frank's buttons and fly and undid them.  Doug wanted to cry but could not.  Tugging down the jeans, he saw what Frank was packing and any hopes that it would be a small matter were dashed.  Doug couldn't stop himself but he could try and prolong it but pulling Frank's briefs all the way down to the floor before look back up.<br />
<br />
It stared him right in the face; unshaven, seven inch, thick cock already dripping at the tip.  Doug looked up with thought his glasses and auburn bangs to the man above.<br />
<br />
&quot;You better swallow,&quot; was all he said before placing his hand on Doug's aim and lining him up.<br />
<br />
Knowing it was unavoidable now, Doug relented and figured to get it over quickly as he could.  Shutting his eyes, he reached up and took Frank in his hand and found himself barely able to get his fingers around the girth; this did not bode well for his mouth.  Slackening his jaw, Doug was preparing to maybe start with a lick when, suddenly, Frank forced him forward.  It was all Doug do to keep his buck teeth from making contact and not gagging.<br />
<br />
Everyone was watching, cheering, shooting video and some even laughed at Doug.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bet he never thought he'd suck a dick when he came here tonight,&quot; he heard someone say.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bet he didn't think he'd be a girl tonight either!&quot; Came another call.<br />
<br />
Doug, thinking of what he liked with girls, stroked, cupped the balls and did his best to take as much in of Frank as he could.  The initial feeling Doug had was to get through it, quickly, and wash his mouth out.  His eyes stayed shut and he tried to imagine anything other than reality.  Something odd was happening in his mind and body, though.  Not like before when he hands moved on their own accord, but a feeling.  Tailing twitching, ears perking up, his rhythm increased, his tongue began to join in and he even opened his eyes.  Where once there was just a hairy perv was joy and pleasure.<br />
<br />
&quot;Look!  She's fingering herself!  She likes it!&quot;  Someone said and that's when Doug realized that he had one hand still around Frank's shaft but the other was fingering himself.<br />
<br />
He really was becoming a fuck bunny, he realized.<br />
<br />
Just then it happened.  Frank's body stiffened up, his grip on Doug's hair grew firm and Doug knew what was coming.  The load shot into his mouth and streamed down his throat.  It was warm, salty and unpleasant at first but, oddly, once the tap started to run out, Doug was licking at Frank's tip and then licked his own lips once he pulled away.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think she liked that,&quot; Madame observed.<br />
<br />
Doug heard them all cheering and clapping while it sunk in for him what he had just done.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think I got a bit more in me.&quot; Frank wiped his brow and Doug saw the lust in his eyes had only grown.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well then,&quot; Madame began, &quot;Take her cherry.&quot;</p>
