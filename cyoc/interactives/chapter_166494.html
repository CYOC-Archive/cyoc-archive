<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ty decided on what Dustin would become quickly. It would get rid of Dustin for him. And to top that, he could simply built it as a trap for Dustin. Smiling at his idea he willed that Dustin would come over by himself in a few minutes. Then he took a random book from his shelf, that way Dustin wouldn´t think Ty was waiting for him.<br />
Dustin was still trying to understand what happened to him. “How could Ty change me the way he did? And how could my parents say it was normal? Was there a way to turn back without Ty´s help? And if not, would Ty be nice to me and help?” But the last was possibly the easiest to answer. The way he treated Ty normally, Ty wouldn´t want to help him. But, he decided, he could at least ask him, maybe apologize for being such an ass to him.<br />
After maybe ten minutes Dustin thought he was ready to go over to Ty´s room. On the way out of his room he looked down at himself. Right now he wore a blue shirt that was at least three sizes to big on him, a pair of black shorts held up with a belt, that on him looked either too short for pants or too long for shorts, and grey socks that slipped down to his ankles after a couple of steps. He hoped Ty would change him back, so that his things fit him again. <br />
Reaching Ty´s room he knocked on the door, something he didn´t do normally. “Ty? Can I come in?” That was also so unlike him. Normally he would just go in, but that would only dim his chances with Ty right now.<br />
Ty was a little surprised that Dustin tried to be better, but he guessed Dustin hoped for him to be changed back. He replied: “Sure, come in.” As Ty sat on his bed, putting his book down, Dustin took his desk chair after closing the door.<br />
After a minute in silence Dustin started with: “Ty, I´m sorry. I´m a complete ass to you all the time.” He didn´t know how to continue, so he stopped there. Ty looked at him, faking surprise, while he clearly saw that Dustin wasn´t really sorry. But two could play that way, so he replied: “Thanks, I guess. Maybe we can get better. Was there another reason you came over, beside apologizing?”<br />
Dustin fidgeted a bit before asking: “If it was you who changed me, could you change me back? I hate that my clothes doesn´t really fit.” Ty looked at him, thinking how to reply. Should he be earnest and say yes he was responsible but wouldn´t change him back? But he decided on another idea. “I don´t know what you mean Dustin. You had always problems with your clothes being to big, as your parents had hoped you would get your growth spurt soon.” Mentally, Ty grinned at the look on Dustin´s face. It showed both disbelieve and fear.<br />
Dustin was shocked. Was Ty playing with him, or did he really didn´t see the changes anymore? He had starred as they happened, so how could he not remember them? But what if Ty said the truth and he wasn´t behind this? Could that mean he was stuck like this? He started to fear what the others at school would do with him if he appeared in to big clothes. If they don´t remember the old Dustin, they could be bullying him for that.<br />
When Dustin didn´t say anything for a minute, Ty took his book up again to hide his growing grin, but also to have a base to ask him a few questions. “Say, Dustin”, Ty started after a minute of “reading”: “If there was a way to allow you to fly without help, would you want it?”<br />
Dustin looked confused at Ty, his shock a bit suppressed. “How comes that question? But I guess I would like to be able to fly.” “Oh, it´s just in the book I read, something about heroes and abilities they have. If you could get a set of extra arms, would you want them?”<br />
Dustin thought about that. A set of extra arms could be helpful if he wanted to beat someone, as on pair could hold his target and the other could beat him. “Yeah, that would be nice.” he answered. But it wouldn´t help him as long as he was in this state.<br />
“And if possible, would you like better, improved eyesight?” Ty asked his last question. Dustin  thought about that, too. He had no problems with his eyes, but if they could be improved that wouldn´t be bad either. “Yeah, sounds interesting.”<br />
Ty grinned wide behind his book. From his answers Dustin would be happy with his new role in life. Not that any of the answers had any influence, as Dustin wouldn´t get these things the way he thought about them. And with that, Ty made his wish for Dustin.<br />
<br />
Dustin sat there in silence, still trying to find a way to change back to his old self. He had answered Ty´s questions, but now that Ty didn´t ask him more, he was back to his problems. “What can I do now? Am I stuck like this?”<br />
But his thoughts were interrupted by a short pain on his upper back. It felt as if someone pulled on his skin, but only for a second or two. He had nearly jumped out of the chair, but beside a small yelp he didn´t showed his discomfort to the world. Ty looked at him with interest. Then there was these weird feeling on his back, as if there was an extra layer of skin feeling around. Confused, Dustin tried to touch his back through his shirt. His eyes go wide as he felt something that didn´t belong there. In a small fit of panic he ripped his shirt over his head to look what happened.<br />
There, on his back, was something growing. Not clearly seeing what it was, Dustin stood and turned his glance to Ty´s wardrobe mirror. He saw something long and mostly transparent on his back. While he looked, it still grew longer, until it was nearly reaching down to his knees. He had no real clue what it was right now.<br />
Ty looked with fascination at the wings Dustin had gotten. He had to stop himself from going to touch them right now, as he didn´t want to harm them, as fragile as they look.<br />
With a bit more pain something pressed on both sides of Dustin. As he looked down, he saw some bulges growing there, beside his stomach. The pain got worse until whatever grew there ripped through the outer layer of his skin. There was no blood, but a tube like thing growing out of his sides. “They look just like my arms in thin, and without a hand” Dustin realized as they finished growing and the pain stopped mostly.<br />
Before he could comment on it, however, he felt pain in his eyes, as a terrible headache came into effect. But just as he had closed his eyes to maybe lighten the pain they opened again, and as much as he tried, he couldn´t close them again. But it got worse from there. It felt as if his eyes would burst open, and then they did in a way. Not taking his sight, but widening it, as if he had more eyes instead. That repeated a couple of times until he could look into hundred of spots on each side unblinkingly. He had gotten compound eyes, not that he recognized them as such directly.<br />
When nothing else seemed to happen, Dustin spoke to Ty again. “Ahm... Ty... what is happening to me?” he asked fearful. Whatever happened to him wasn´t normal. Ty finally stood up and moved over to Dustin, who still stood in front of the desk chair. “Is there something happening to you, Dustin? Beside you being nicer than normal, I havn´t noticed anything” Ty lied as he reached out to touch Dustin´s stump like limbs. Afterwards he touched the wings Dustin had grown, fascinated by their looks. The light shimmered through them, coloring his carpet in many different shades.<br />
Dustin looked at Ty, feeling confused and fearful. If Ty hadn´t noticed the changes, then why was he touching his new attachments? But when Dustin saw Ty started to grin, he realized the truth. “You were lying, Ty. What have you done to me?” Dustin screamed at Ty.<br />
Now Ty started to openly laugh at Dustin. “Took you long enough to realize, Dustin. I have fun with you, seeing as I can do to you what I want. But you aren´t finished, so let´s see what comes next.” With that Ty wished mentally for the next changes.<br />
Dustin was ready to punch Ty, and tried to do so. But just as his fist would have connected with Ty´s jaw, it cramped painfully. Adding that Ty sidestepped the punch, Dustin tumbled to the ground, with resulted in even more pain for his fist. He couldn´t open his fingers and his other hand had cramped the same way, clenching into another fist. As Dustin looked down he saw in horror why he couldn´t open his fists, there was no fist anymore on either hand, but a stump similar to the newly grown ones on each of them.<br />
Just as the pain subdued in his former hands, the same pain started in his feet. Looking down between his limbs he saw that his socks had dropped as he tumbled to the ground, and his feet changed into similar stumps than his hands had, as his toes simply shrunk back into his rounding feet. Soon he had just six round stumps on his body, and as much as he tried he couldn´t get back up on his feet.<br />
When the pain had subdued again, Dustin tried to plead with Ty. “Please Ty, I promise I will get better and help you out, but please stop this. I don´t wantzz toz bezz bzzz ….” With a few more “Bzzt” sounds Dustin´s voice was gone completely, not that he stopped trying to speak. Only the sounds weren´t only not human speech anymore, but also got quieter every passing second as his mouth had become smaller.<br />
“Serves you right for lying to me, Dustin. Yes, I know that your apology was only for  your hope that I change you back and not honest.” Ty laughed again as Dustin laid on the ground, trying to move his changing body. The wings had moved a couple of times, but in no way for Dustin to fly with them. For that, he would be still to heavy and to inexperienced.<br />
Dustin was no in full panic as he couldn´t get his body working any way that would help him. His little wiggling attempts were of no use. While he tried his body slowly turned black as his head was sucked back into it, erasing his neck on the way. It wasn´t that long before his body had finished changing, leaving a human-sized fly on Ty´s carpet, still wearing Dustin´s shorts due the belt, now covering his former legs done to the ground as they have become shorter to match his former arms and newly grown limbs. And he still wiggled helplessly on the ground.<br />
“You turned out nicely, Dustin. But for a real fly you are still far to big and I will change that in a minute. But first some info for you. I won´t let you remain that pathetic an inexperienced, I will make sure you will know how to work your body, at least some of it. And as I don´t want you dead, I will make sure that should you be killed any way you will just reappear a bit away from the last spot you where in. That way you will have more of that life as a fly, my dear foster brother.” Ty grinned as he willed exactly that to happen.<br />
Dustin looked at Ty in horror as he started to shrink. It wasn´t even twenty seconds after he started getting smaller that he was reduced to the size of a normal house fly, maybe a bit bigger. Then a foreign feeling entered his mind, as he gained some knowledge of his body, along with, unknown to him, instincts fitting a normal fly. His human mind, however, remained completely intact, trapped inside the fly he was now.<br />
Dustin tried to lift off, and it took a few tries, but he finally managed to fly up a bit from his place. However, seconds later Ty catches him between his hands, carefully not to crush him. Then he heard Ty´s voice speaking rather loudly, not knowing it was only due his small size that Ty sounded so loud. “Look at the small fly I have caught. A pity I don´t have a frog or spider to feed you to, little one.” He laughed rather evilly at that. Dustin tried to escape, but right now there was no opening for him between Ty´s fingers.<br />
“Let´s give you a chance to become human again, Dustin. If you survive a whole week without being killed and reborn, you will turn back. Then I will even turn you back to your old self. I hope you have some fun flying around the neighborhood while I enjoy being the only child in the house. Now, to send you away.” Ty laughed again as he rather slowly pressed his hands together. Dustin still tried to escape, but it didn´t help. Seconds later he felt the pressure of Ty´s hands and than with a plop his body was crushed and he died. Only to reappear outside in an to him  unknown location. It was only their neighbors garden, but at his current size he didn´t recognize it.<br />
“I have to survive a week like this? I will beat your bet, Ty.” Dustin thought after a couple of minutes of calming down and work how his body worked. Then he started flying around and getting used to his new body in the air. Only to land in a cobweb in the next plant he fly by. “Oh no” he thought as he tried to escape, but he wasn´t strong enough to get out before the owner neared. And so, he was killed by a spider this time.<br />
Alone over the next two hours Dustin died around five more times. Once swallowed by a frog as he flew over a pound, a second time by a spider, and three times swatted by a human as he landed inside a house these times.<br />
Meanwhile Ty enjoyed the silence. With an evil grin, he added another wish for Dustin. Yes, Dustin would change back if he survived a week, but Ty made sure that Dustin would die on the sixth day at the latest, at least for the next year. After that he would get his chance to survive.</p>
