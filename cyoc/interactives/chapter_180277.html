<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jackson didn&#39;t know why he was trying to come off like the older guy here. He and Danny were basically the same age anyway. It raised some odd questions about how he viewed himself. And why exactly he suddenly found their rivalry relationship so...childish. Though maybe it&#39;d be good to end the rivalry here. Jackson did after all have the bigger build for once. Maybe it&#39;d be right to just quit while he was ahead, rather than push Danny through force of rivalry into potentially outgrowing him again. Usually, Jackson didn&#39;t put this much thought into the dynamics of their rivalry - but tonight he felt weirdly...contemplative.<br />
<br />
As he went back downstairs, he heard some clamoring for his return, and then shouts about his new hairdo, or lack thereof. People still wanted some stories from him down here. And he was gonna oblige them. It appealed to some part of him that enjoyed having history, AND it made him seem so important. Fuck Danny - he could take the advice or leave it. Whatever he wanted - dude was his own person, and Jackson had no responsibility for whatever he did with his life.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now, guys, a number of you might be wondering why I shaved my head like this.&quot; He gestured to it with a grin, &quot;Well, someone said that a bald dude wouldn&#39;t look as good as a guy with a full head of hair. So I went ahead and proved em wrong.&quot; Jackson accentuated this by flexing his arms - and he swore as he looked at his biceps he could see just such amazing development in the tone and size. For the first time in what had to be a long time, Jackson was honestly bigger than Danny.<br />
<br />
And that made him feel honestly pretty thrilled.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, a number of you were asking about romantic stories. How about my first?&quot; He crossed his arms in front of his chest, and said, &quot;When I was a much younger man...well, not that much younger, I met a girl on the steps of the football stadium. Her name was Carly and she was about a year older than me, more well developed than most of the girls I had any experience with. Carly and I really got in a whirlwind relationship...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Get to the steamy bits!&quot; Someone shouted from the crowd.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m gettin&#39; there, I&#39;m gettin&#39; there.&quot; For some reason it initially felt oddly inappropriate to be relaying sex stories to these guys laying out on sofas and couches, seeing them leaning forward like this. But Jackson got past that after a moment&#39;s contemplation, &quot;Carly and I banged under the bleachers after I won my first game. She did everything amazingly well, but young me was sensitive, overhyped from the game, and already boned up.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Aww...&quot; The crowd uttered, a few chuckles ringing out.<br />
<br />
&quot;So yeah, my first real romance here culminated an early emission. Go me.&quot; Jackson said as he used some sarcasm. Carly had graduated a while ago, and Jackson oddly felt a sense of relation to that. He...he was a senior student here, right? He was due to graduate basically this or the next year, right? Because for some reason just relaying this story was honestly bringing up some feelings that he might not really belong among the guys here for much longer.<br />
<br />
Ah well, all the more reason to enjoy this while it lasted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you have any more hot stories!?&quot; Someone in the front row shouted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Easy, easy, and yeah, that I do.&quot; Jackson took a seat shortly after at the front of the crowd and decided to get another story going. For some reason, he really felt this role was something he was getting used to. He couldn&#39;t wait to return to play some football next week, but the fact he had evidently been here so long and had so many stories made him feel good about this. Though maybe the next relationship he had would take a bit longer to get to the sex.<br />
<br />
For some reason Jackson was feeling a lot less like the sex was the point of the relationship.<br />
<br />
-------------<br />
<br />
Speaking of sex and an odd relationship, Gabe and Terry were trying to engage with each other in the upstairs bathroom. Terry had his shirt and pants off, standing there pound erect while Gabe stood there in just his shorts. The shyer young man shook his head and looked at the nearly naked Terry, &quot;Are...are you really sure that this is gonna work? I mean, if you just had these gay thoughts so soon after dealing with em with Jin...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s all good, Gabey. Don&#39;t worry about it so much. Just focus on dealing with your thoughts and uhh, enjoying yourself while you&#39;re doing it.&quot; Terry seemed so sure of himself, and Gabe had no real reason to doubt him. But at the same time, this all seemed less like it was helping with the problem. And Gabe was even starting to wonder how much of a problem it was when he was feeling such a strong temptation to engage and indulge with Terry.<br />
<br />
Gabe shook his head. He couldn&#39;t just let...whatever was going on...completely subsume him. He was Gabe...he was s-straight right? Right? Just blowing Jackson like that should&#39;ve helped, but he guessed he might need more to assuage these thoughts. If that was even how this worked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; Gabe said and started disrobing, a hungry looking Terry watching him do so. &quot;So we&#39;re...we&#39;re gonna like, fuck and then I can feel better?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, that should be how it&#39;s gonna work.&quot; Terry knew he should on some level feel bad about misleading Gabe like this. They were friends after all. But he told himself he was just doing this in the name of helping Gabe ultimately. &quot;Don&#39;t worry, you&#39;ll be as straight as a rod as soon I&#39;m done with ya.&quot; Terry flexed a little, showing his diminished build still had some slight tone. All the better for making him alluring to guys in the club.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, whatever you say, Terry...&quot; Gabe stripped down and looked at Terry, who shortly after did the same.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do we do now?&quot; Gabe seemed nervous even still. Afraid that if he made the first move and did something, the reservoir would break. He&#39;d not be able to stop himself. That there might be more he might stand to deal with than just these &quot;gay thoughts&quot;.<br />
<br />
Terry moved over and embraced Gabe before bringing him into a growingly passionate kiss, arms wrapped around Gabe&#39;s shoulders. His resistance was melting, and Gabe blushed as he moved into the kiss. The two twinks were inexperienced and just starting to come into their identity. And surprisingly, Gabe was the one still putting up resistance. But as of now, they were alone in the bathroom, trying to sort out how this romantic liaison would turn out...</p>
