<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff decided to see what it would actually be like to be a donkey. To be stuck as a donkey forever. He always wanted to be one. To know there was no going back to being human. Forever stuck on all fours, and unable to speak or play games or anything else. To have an enormous black penis with huge wobbly balls between his legs,  and to be incontinent. To be stuck only eating grass or hay,  knowing he would be stuck at the bottom of the food chain. He wanted it to be uncomfortable as well. With the feeling of being &quot;trapped&quot; with such a body.  <br />
<br />
He set the timer to instantly change his body. No messing around with a slow transformation. And for it to last permanantly. No going back. Ever. <br />
<br />
Taking a deep breath with horniness reaching a high level,  he hit &quot;ENTER.&quot; Everything blurred out for a fraction of a second, and cleared. Well,  as clear as his new donkey vision would ever allow. He opened his large,  dark eyes to a blurry near-sighted dull black and gray world.<br />
<br />
He tried lifting a hand to rub his eyes in the attempt to clear this strange new crappy vision,  but quickly realized he was now standing perfectly comfortably on all fours. <br />
<br />
&quot;Errgghh hhaaww, &quot; he vocalized out loud.<br />
&quot;Hhhaaww, &quot; he tried clearing his throat. <br />
<br />
He swung his much larger,  heavier head around to the left,  and saw his barrel-shaped gray body extending far behind himself,  ending in a large gray blob of a behind. He brayed at it,  trying to say &quot;Well,  I guess it worked.&quot; But stopped short at the sound of his beastly gutteral &quot;eerrrgghh hhhaaww.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m a donkey now.&quot;<br />
&quot;Eerrrgghh hhhaaww.&quot; <br />
<br />
Jeff shut his mouth,  not entirely comfortable with the sound he was producing. Loud, obnoxious,  and unintelligible. <br />
<br />
His human mind was thinking &quot;i&#39;m a donkey? Im a donkey! I&#39;m a fucking donkey!&quot; as he stood there. His huge penis pulling out of his brand new black leathery sheath. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my god,  im stuck as a fucking donkey!&quot; His thoughts continue. He stamps his right front hoof on the hard wood bedroom floor. The sharp &quot;clack&quot; sound that only a hard fingerless hoof could make on a hard surface made his penis get longer and stiffer. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hhhaaaww, &quot; Jeff huffed out at the intensity of his new bestial libido. <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m...a...donk...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;EERRGGHH HHAAWW EERRRGGHH HHHAAWW EERRGGHH HHHAAWW!!&quot; He stood screaming as his first thick,  yellowish-white load cames gushing out like liquidy yogurt. <br />
<br />
Jeff stood around for a few moments,  eyes gkazed over panting. He felt a second rush escaping his penis. This one hot with an acrid odor. A strong,  steady,  firehose-like stream splashing around his front hooves that were formerly his hands. Followed by several plops erupting from beneath his new uplifted tail. <br />
<br />
With a couple more fading bobs, his penis began pulling back into its home. <br />
<br />
&quot;Eerrgghh hhhaaww, &quot; still unable to speak,  Jeff was a bit horrified at the mess he just unwittingly made in his room. Vaguely thinking he would come back later to clean it up, his new large body felt the need to nourish itself. He wanted to try out his new body and its tastebuds on his new slimy tongue anyway. <br />
<br />
He turned tail, and approached his door with a couple of thick &quot;clops&quot; from his new hooves. An obstacle. This,  he would discover,  his first inconvenience of not having hands any longer. At first,  he naturally was ready to reach out to grip the knob. But large blocky hooves are incapable of such a thing. <br />
<br />
&quot;Eerrgghh hhhaaww, &quot; he tried cussing. &quot;Fuck! I cant even TALK!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Haaawww!&quot; He blew out in frustration. <br />
<br />
He decided to grip the knob between his teeth instead. It was a clumsy affair. Took him several frustrating tries to turn his head, pull,  and back up at the same time. But eventually,  he managed it. <br />
<br />
Jeff proceeded through the doorway,  but his thick shoulders stopped him. Forgetting he now posses a 700 lb frame! He had no idea he now weighed that much.<br />
<br />
&quot;Eerrrgghh hhhaaww!&quot; (&quot;Im too big!?&quot;)<br />
&quot;Dammit! I cannot speak!&quot; He thought silently.<br />
<br />
He flexed his front legs through the door one at time,  and one by one, squeezed each shoulder through. Then he got stuck with his round barrel-shaped middle. <br />
<br />
&quot;Haaww!&quot; He heaved,  as the doorframe cracked,  then splintered. The loud *CRASH* made Jeff panick,  as he scrambled the rest of the way through,  and down the steps. <br />
<br />
&quot;EERRRGGHH HHAAAWW!!&quot; he bellowed in fright as his heavy right hoof smashed the top step and his right front leg buckled. He tried catching the railing with his non-existent left hand,  but again,  it ends in just a useless blocky hoof. Besides, the stairwell was too narrow for him to lift his left front leg to the side,  and his right shoudler slammed into the wall as he stumbled the rest of the way down the steps. He landed at the bottom in a painful heap.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hhhaaaww!&quot; He guffawed. His right front leg near the shoulder was hurting,  and his breath was knocked out of him. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hhhhaaaww.....eeerrrgghh hhaawww&quot; He moaned (&quot;ooohhhh,  my arm, &quot; he meant to say but couldn&#39;t.) <br />
<br />
He tried getting back up. It was a struggle. At least nothing seemed to be broken,  but getting back to his four legged stance in his 700+ lb body was awkwardly difficult without the flexibility of human arms and hands to push himself back up. Jeff eventually found the best way to get his legs back under himself,  and with far too much difficulty, got back in his new natural stance of all fours. <br />
<br />
He approached the back door. Luckily, the only thing blocking his path this time, was just a simple screen door. He could just butt it open with his head. But first,  he wanted to see himself in a mirror. The hutch in the kitchen has a large reflective mirror as a backing. There were no dishes in it currently,  so it would work perfectly. All he had to do,  was push the table out of the way to stand in front of it. An easy prospect for the beast of burden that Jeff now was. <br />
<br />
Jeff took the first look at his own reflection through his poor nearsighted eyes. Despite his blurry gray-and-white vision,  he could easily make out his new donkey features. Not a trace of humanity to be found! The tall,  broad furry ears adorning the top of his head was just a bit humiliating. He wanted to reach up to touch them,  but that would be quite impossible in his current state. <br />
<br />
&quot;Eerrggh hhhaaww, &quot; he guffawed at his own reflection. He opened his thick black donkey lips to get a look at his gross,  over-sized blocky yellow teeth. &quot;I look like an idiot!&quot; he thought silently. He stood a few more moments looking at his unrecognizeable reflection before growing somewhat bored,  and wanting to try his new body out. <br />
<br />
He turned around, getting a good glimpse of his large breadloaf-shaped behind adorned by a tail he seemingly had little control over, and clip-clopped heavily back to the back door. He had the same issue as before with his bedroom,  but again, the poor doorframe was no match for a 700 lb beast of burden. <br />
<br />
It was hot outside, and Jeff soon noticed that he felt like he was wearing a coat. A coat that was permanantly a part of him. He also wasnt weari g any pants, allowing his huge equine make equipment to just hang and wobble about freely. <br />
<br />
Feeling shy all the sudden,  he told himself he was disguised as a donkey. Thats all anyone looking at him would see. The outside grass had a sharp and sweet aroma, and he quickly forgot about his shyness as food was calling to him. <br />
<br />
Jeff clopped his way off the back porch,  and into the freshly-mown lawn. He looked down and thought &quot;am i really going to be eating the lawn?&quot; Looking at his front legs,  he supposed he would now have to degrade himself even further by grabbing the already wet,  slimey mushed up grass with his mouth. He had no hands. <br />
<br />
A part of Jeff&#39;s human mind was repulsed,  but his his new animalistic senses and instincts compelled him to eat like the barnyard aninal he now was. &quot;Here goes nothing,&quot; he thought,  taking a deep breath. &quot;My first meal.&quot;<br />
<br />
His head lowered and his jaw opened wide,  displaying his molar-like front teeth, and grabbed the wet,  loose fresh grass clippings. The texture made him want to gag,  but his body seemed to know it was nothing to gag over. It was DELICIOUS!<br />
<br />
And so,  Jeff began grazing mindlessly. At one point,  even realizing that&#39;s what he was doing: grazing. Jeff eventually realized that the backyard was too snall,  and he was too exposed to the neighbors. They would eventually see him,  and wonder what in the heck a donkey was doing in the yard! And so,  he wandered over to the gate,  and had to use his snout to unlatch it. But again,  his bulky frame was too large. This time,  however, it wasnt as easy as breaking a wooden doorframe. The fence was cemented in several feet below ground! Eventually,  he had to back uo and use his weight to his advantage. He used his front hooves to bend it front the top. <br />
<br />
&quot;Eerrgghh hhaaww eerrgghh hhaaw eerrgghh hhaaw.&quot; Trying to laugh and say &quot;haha,  take that!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Hhhaawww!!&quot; He sighed. &quot;I keep forgetting that i cant talk!&quot;<br />
<br />
There was a cemetary right around the corner ftom where he lived. Plenty of open spsce there,  and he could probsmably hide behind the small crenatorium building when someone comes to lock the gates. <br />
<br />
&quot;Thats a good idea!&quot; Thought Jeff. And so,  he wandered over to the old cemetery. Lots of good grass over there. Bonus: the entrance can fit a car. It should be able to fit a donkey&#39;s body.<br />
<br />
A couple of hours passed, as Jeff mindlessly continued chewing on the grass. He had no idea what time it was now,  but he was finally feeling quite full. Now what? <br />
<br />
&quot;Well,  im stuck as a donkey now. Which means I&#39;ll probably be stuck on a farm somewhere. I cant talk,  so i can never tell anyone that i&#39;m actually not a donkey.&quot; <br />
<br />
Jeff knew he couldn&#39;t go home now. That he could never go back there. He remained undecided about what to do now, so he just stood around like a simple-minded donkey would. He wanted a taste of the simple donkey life, and this is what he always saw them doing. Just standing around staring. But this was not the life of a human mind with human intelligence. <br />
<br />
Jeff began to grow bored, and in his mind, was beginning to wonder why he was just standing around a boring old cemetery.  He had a strong incliniation to go back home and see what his friends were up to online. For a moment,  he completely forgot he was stuck as a vile nasty old four-legged beast  with no hands. Nor that he could only make one sound:<br />
<br />
&quot;Eerrrgghh hhhaaww.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah dammit! Im a blasted donkey!&quot;<br />
<br />
But then went right on to forget that simple fact again when his mind wandered to what would be supper,  and to play on his computer. Just to immediately be greeted with his obnoxious deep gutteral bray again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Eerrrgghh hhhaaww!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Crap! I really AM stuck as a donkey!&quot; &quot;Eeerr hhaaww eerrrgghh hhaaww eeerrgghh hhhaawww!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m going to be stuck like this forever! No hands. No fucking hands!&quot; Eerrrgghh hhaaw! &quot;Cant even say &quot;damn it!&quot; I. Am. A DONKEY!&quot; EERRGGHH HHHAAWW EERRRGGHH HHHAAW EERRGGHH HHHAAWW!!&quot; <br />
<br />
The thoughts and the restrictions were becoming quite uncomfortable,  to say the least. Stuck forever crawling around the earth on all fours like a simple lowly beast. With front LEGS that end in HOOVES! <br />
<br />
&quot;EERRRGGHH HHHAAWW!&quot; And stuck with that as the only &quot;speech&quot; he&#39;ll ever make.<br />
<br />
These things were making him very horny. With each thought that only escaped his large rubbery slimy lips with an &quot;eerrggh hhhaaw, &quot; made his troubles seem more real and more restrive. Each time his mind wanted to &quot;open&quot; his &quot;fist, &quot; sane thing. And it rendered him ever more horny. <br />
<br />
His huge black donkey penis became engorged. He couldnt reach it,  and even if he could,  he couldnt grip it. He closed his eyes,  feeling his ugly,  dirty donkey body seemingly make his mond even more trapped. Which further made him horny. Which made him even more entrenched and trapped. And so,  round and circles his mind went as a positive feedback loop. <br />
<br />
Then he smelled something. Something nasty and dirty. Whuch made his engorged penis begin to drip pre-cum as it bobbled up and down. His eyes opened, and suddenly, Jeff was nose-to-cunt with the behind of a swollen female!<br />
<br />
He felt his front end rise,  as his hooves and legs curled aroud her midsection. Jeff knew immediately what he was doing,  but became utterly powerless to stop it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nooooooo!!!!! I didnt. Want. Beast...beast.... &quot; Eerrrgghh hhaaww eerrrgghhh hhhaaww eeerrrgghh hhhaawww!! His thoughts interrupted by his own and her wild braying in unison. Two donkeys. Mating! One with a human mind stuck inside its skull. The other a naturally-bon jenny. Which somehow makes it even worse. And during this first mating session, it really clicked in his brain that he was now well and truly stuck with the body of a beast.<br />
<br />
The full-blown realization made Jeff hyper aware of his lack of speech, his lack of hands,  and being firever stuck on all fours. His &quot;hands&quot; felt more trapped and numb than ever. It was excrutiatingly irritating. Just having a large lumpy block,  and never feeling fingers stretch and bend ever again.<br />
<br />
&quot;I...I.....I....no,  no,  nooooo....&quot;<br />
&quot;Eerrrgghh hhaaww eerrrgghh hhaawwEEERRRGGHH HHHAAAAAAAWWWWWWW!!!&quot; <br />
<br />
The thoughts and feelings made him press amd slam his huge black wobbly donkey cock deeper and deeper inside the unnaturally humid,  fetid,  smelly female cunt until her vaginal wall clech tightly onto his cock deep inside her,  and forbidded it from moving back and forth. Jeff&#39;s willpower hung onto his crescendo as long as he could,  and they both came at exactly the same time. Raucus braying coming from both animals&#39; mouths in unison. The production of seed and egg was so much,  that the thickness came spilling out in torrents like yogurt mixed with eggnog.<br />
<br />
The throbbing went on for many insatiable minutes,  before beginning to subside. Jeff dismounted in horrifed silence. Wanting desparately to stand on two legs,  get a hot shower,  and curl up in a ball and cry in humiliation and fear. But he&#39;s stuck in a random donkey&#39;s body,  and transported to god knows where. Never to see his home and family ever again.</p>
