<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Arun was a rather shy elf, which was rather unique among the scantly clad Enchanting Elves for the forest glade. He had a rich complexion of chocolatey coper, which transitioned to a delicate milky hew down his chest and belly, same as under his arms and to his palms. Small of stature, like most Enchanting Elves, but in some ways even skinnier and fragile looking than the others. His hair was a lovely shade of blue that reminded of a trickling brook and matched his starry azure eyes.<br />
<br />
“Come on. I know you want to,” giggled Tion, another elf boy pinning Arun down into the soft grass. Tion&#39;s long golden hair tickled Arun&#39;s sensetive spots seemingly accidentaly, but the misgevous elf boy knew exactly what he was doing. Tion was quite a femenine elf boy, but even so, he was easily pinning Arun under him. The long haired elf had pail skin which brought out the lush red of his lips.<br />
<br />
“No. It&#39;s embarrassing,” Arun said, blushing and trying not to look into his friend&#39;s green eyes.<br />
<br />
“It&#39;s your turn to tempt someone into the forest. I want someone to play new to tease.” Tion said, giving Arun a quick kiss before continuing to strip him with his mouth. Aron giggled despite himself as he tried to get Tion off of him.<br />
<br />
“Stop it.” Not many Enchanting Elves wore anything covering their tops, even among the women. But Arun&#39;s nipples had always been too sensitive to even stand the forest breeze exposed. And when he got excited, he usually got too wild.<br />
<br />
“I&#39;m not stopping until you agree,” Tion said as he pulled open Arun&#39;s top, exposing the perky nipples. He leaned in and licked the left one. Arun gasped and Tion could feel his friend&#39;s excitement sturring bellow.<br />
<br />
“Okay! Okay! I&#39;ll do it! But only a little.”<br />
<br />
“Not good enough. You&#39;ll do everything you can until you capture us a new play thing.” Tion said before nibling on the left nipple.<br />
<br />
“Aaah! Alright! Please! It&#39;s too much. I&#39;ll do whatever you say.” Tion was a little dissapointed at how easely he&#39;d won. He sucked on his friends nipple for a few extra seconds just for fun, before reluctantly parting his lips from them with a satisfying pop and a shuttering moan from Arun.<br />
<br />
“I knew you wanted to. Come on then.” He got off of Arun and lead the way the the forest edge where he had Arun strip naked.<br />
<br />
“Can&#39;t I at least wear my loin cloth?” blushed the coper skinned boy, shuffling his feet.<br />
<br />
“You agreed,” reminded Tion. “Or do you want me to play with you instead?”<br />
<br />
“No. No. I&#39;ll do as you say.” Arun kicked off the last of his clothes and took a deep breath before stepping to the edge of the forest to pose for passers by. Tion had chosen a good spot for getting the attention of any manner of creature. It was a crossroads between many of the regions. And you never knew what you might see there.<br />
<br />
In the middle of the road stood a large stone monument, though Arun didn&#39;t know what to or what race had build it. It was just a decorative landmark. A group of humans were passing on it. Arun didn&#39;t want to be seen so naked, but he didn&#39;t want to have to stay in sight all day. He gave a twittering whistle and struck an alluring pose. They saw him and he gave them a wink with genuine shyness.<br />
<br />
One of the men nudged another in a jovial manner, indicating the blushing elf boy just behind the tree-line. The first spoke to the second, but was answered with a shake of the head. Arun heard him mutter that it was a trap. Darn. Word of their seductive schemes were too familiar with the local villages, making it hard to trick them unless they were new to these parts. There were plenty who knew what the elves would do to them and came anyway to get captured on purpose, but that wasn&#39;t quite as fun. Teasing a foolish wonderer was a lot more Tino&#39;s thing. The men walked on.<br />
<br />
A little while later, a lone orc came walking. Quite the opposite of the lushes Enchanting Elves, Arun knew that Orcs were one of Tion&#39;s favorite. They looked too brutal and scary for Arun, but Tion liked their rippling muscles and aggression in bed. Arun did his best seductive pose, but even the dumb brute knew better than to rush over to have his way with the elf. No luck. He had to be daring.<br />
<br />
Arun bit his lip cautiously. He knew that they were never supposed to set foot outside of the forest, but what harm could one little stop do? He felt his adrenaline pumping as he decided to do it. This wasn&#39;t like him. Damn Tion for turning him on so much. And showing himself off like this naked was just making him more reckless. Okay, okay. Just out into the open for a quick moment and back again. Then maybe he&#39;d be able to do it when he saw someone on the road again and trick them into a trap.<br />
<br />
Arun took three quick steps forward and was under the open sky. His heart was pumping fast. It was such a thrill. He was out in the open! Naked! Unprotected. Vulnerable. No forest to protect him. The danger of it all was driving him to the edge. This was the first time he&#39;d even been beyond the forest. It was taboo, which just made it all the more exciting.<br />
<br />
“Arun! What are you doing!” hissed Tino, who had not been prepared to see his friend do something so wreckless.<br />
<br />
“I just had to try it,” giggled Arun, turning back. Out in the open, the wind tickled his skin a lot more than in the forest. It was amazing. But also scary. He took a step back, when suddenly, ropes sprang from the ground. Magic ropes! A trap set especially for Enchanting Elves.<br />
<br />
The ropes wound their way around Arun, ensnaring him in less than a second. They&#39;d been completely hidden in the grass. Arun&#39;s arms were bound behind his back and his legs together. The rope yanked him back and he went sliding across the open field like a lief caught in the wind.<br />
<br />
It brought him right up to the monument in the middle of the crossroad and suspended him hogtied from it. Arun panicked, but couldn&#39;t free himself at all. He was helpless. This was a very basic spell rope that one could buy cheep from any artifact merchant. It would not hold most beings because of either strength or even minor magic, but being an Enchanting Elf, this was not the kind of magic he had. Arun could make a flower bloom, but he knew nothing of counteracting a binding spell. The rope had probably been made for capturing rabits, but someone had figured it would work just as well on Enchanting Elves. And they had figured correct.<br />
<br />
Above the rope was a magic bell that chimed as he swung. Somewhere, someone had an identical bell that would chime only when this one did. It was a signal that the trap had been sprung. Someone would be coming to claim their prize very soon.<br />
<br />
“Tion! Help!” he cried to the forest.<br />
<br />
“I can&#39;t. It&#39;s dangerous to leave the forest.”<br />
<br />
“Please! Just get me down from here.”<br />
<br />
“What if there&#39;s more traps?” Tion called back.<br />
<br />
“Please! Tion. You&#39;re the one who got me into this mess.”<br />
<br />
“Me? You&#39;re the idiot who left the forest.”<br />
<br />
“Just cut me down.” Arun yelled, tears in his eyes. Tion didn&#39;t answer. Just watched from the shade of the trees. A terrible idea suddenly occurred to Arun.<br />
<br />
“Hey! You&#39;re enjoying this, aren&#39;t you?”<br />
<br />
“No,” Tion answered, with just a little too much hesitation. Of course Tion was turned on by this. Tion loved captured boys. Arun just didn&#39;t expect to be the one captured. But even so.<br />
<br />
“I&#39;d free you if I could, but I wouldn&#39;t know how to, even if I dared go over to you.”<br />
<br />
“Tion!” Arun complained.<br />
<br />
“Oh! Someone&#39;s coming,” Tion exclaimed before ducking into some bushes to spy. Arun&#39;s heart was racing. He heard someone approaching, but he couldn&#39;t see from this angle. He couldn&#39;t so much as turn himself around to see what race had got their hands on their very own, helpless, shy, elf.</p>
