<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Having turned 18 just a few weeks ago I found the thought of owning a mansion was beyond exhilarating. There appeared to be several stories, each with 7 to 8 rooms, and a basement as well as a shed, pool, and greenhouse outside on the expansive lot.<br />
<br />
My head was feeling foggy when I first woke up but now everything seemed to have come into focus, I recalled Mom telling me about the passing of Great Great Uncle Ted Transer several years ago. She was bitter that there was no inheritance for her and that the estate was going to great lengths (at exceptional expense) to find male decedents. <br />
<br />
In his later years Mom had visited with Uncle Ted several times a week, despite his failing health he always insisted on getting &quot;out of the house&quot; for his socializing. When he was no longer able to leave the house, Mom, being the only near relative, visited but wasn&#39;t allowed past the entry hall. She kept commenting on how strange it was but was more concerned that he knew he was cared for. His having such great wealth and seeming to have forgotten her for all the times she remembered him had hurt her.<br />
<br />
Looking around in the white room there was a small piece of paper labeled Heirs Attempted, below it there were hash marks that totaled 67. I tried to wrap my head around how an heir could be attempted and how 67 could fail the simple task of getting outside when a map is given. Perhaps the other heirs declined accepting responsibility? Most, if not all, are overseas. The value of the property may not be worth the effort involved with dropping everything to manage a foreign estate. Even so, not knowing for sure left an unsettling feeling. <br />
<br />
Looking around the only thing in the room that wasn&#39;t white was the reflection in a mirror, though it did have a white frame, it actually seemed to be a focal point, drawing your attention intentionally. Beneath the mirror was a note saying, &quot;Remember who you are, otherwise you will have nothing to return to if you loose yourself.&quot; Looking at my reflection I pondered the message but felt that it and the mirror were oddly creepy. <br />
<br />
I have plain brown eyes, plain brown hair, a plain white face with spotty brown facial hair... well, it would be spotty if I wasn&#39;t clean shaven. I still have the spotty growth of a young teen so I shave it all. Once it fills in I&#39;ll let it grow out, but not till its at its best. I&#39;m average build, maybe on the thin side. Nothing special.<br />
<br />
The know yourself message was more irritating than motivational. I&#39;m going to go to community college next year for something. Nothing seems important enough for me to dedicate my life toward it. I don&#39;t want to be locked into doing the same thing every day for the rest of my life, why do people and mirrors expect me to know everything?!?!? Feeling flustered, I turned and looked around the rest of the room. White bed, white chair, white table, white dresser, white carpet, white closet, white outfit, white pillows...<br />
<br />
Finally getting bored of looking at white, I took a final glance at the map and stepped out of the white room in search of the exit. Looking around I saw a number of rooms, already decorated with themes and appearing to be ready for guests or entertaining. One room appeared to include a fully stocked bar, which held great excitement for me, because being 18, I am not allowed to purchase alcohol until I&#39;m 21.<br />
<br />
I wanted desperately to run in and check what was stocked, but I held back. I presumed that there was someone waiting for me to walk out the front door and I had a bit to say about being drugged and drug into a strange location, inheritance or not. Drinking illegally, before officially acquiring the property, would probably make the confrontation outside that much worse... but maybe at the housewarming party...<br />
<br />
Moving on I saw different bedrooms and what would probably be called a study. I was feeling more and more at ease with each step considering it was all going to be mine. I looked left and saw my bedroom, err, the Master Bedroom and stepped in without thinking twice.<br />
<br />
The smell of the room seemed familiar and further put me at ease, the tasteful hunter green and beige comforter on the bed looked exquisite and inviting. I glanced at my dresser and fully expected to see my clothes should I open the drawer. Catching a glance of myself in the mirror I saw my usual self. I was  looking devilishly handsome since I began working out in my mid 20s and had gained a few pounds. The mustache looked good and my 5 &#39;o-clock shadow was more pronounced since it was late evening. I was wearing my monogrammed, red and white nightgown in preparation for... &quot;There she is...&quot; <br />
<br />
I glanced at the doorway and smiled, seeing Jennifer. She paused for a second in the door, playing coy, and gave an innocent &quot;who, me?&quot; glance which made my heart race a little. The monogrammed, silver nightgown she was wearing suddenly hit the floor exposing everything and impulsively I took the 4 steps to her and we immediately began making out. She stepped into my embrace, I could feel her yearning for me as I craved her. The fondling and groping continued, in an instant I too was de-robed. We slowly maneuvered toward the bed, bumping into things with our naked bodies, we finally reached the bed and then positioned ourselves on it. The intensity and passion was overwhelming, grinding, rubbing, caressing, kissing. Holding back was maddening for me but I knew that the foreplay was worth it for her experience. <br />
<br />
I continued kissing her and slowly went down and kissed her neck, she was almost ready. I heard a weird out of place crinkle sound. Ever so slightly distracted, I took a quick glance and upon seeing nothing, I began kissing the other side of her soft and sexy neck. I repositioned my hand next to her head and felt something that was laying on the pillow unexpectedly. I grabbed whatever it was and picked it up. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh Theo! Yes!&quot; Jennifer cried, signaling she was ready. I plunged in, thrusting and pumping. I watched the ecstasy on her face for a minute until I noticed what I was holding. <br />
<br />
A white glob that seemed almost ghostly, flickering in and out of existence like it was from another world. I could feel it but not always see it. It gave me pause, and I then realized that Jennifer cried out for Theo. &quot;That&#39;s not my name.&quot; I said immediately turned off. I pulled out and rolled off of her. <br />
<br />
To my horror, Jennifer was continuing the sex act with an opaque version of who I was a moment ago. Both she and &quot;Theo&quot; had an aura around them like the thing in my hand. I reached out to touch them in search of my bearings and they both faded away. I now stood alone, in a quiet house, with a raging erection, and a really dumb look on my face.<br />
<br />
I didn&#39;t have anything to take care of the erection so I ran to the master bathroom grabbing the toilet paper. I noticed the thing in my hand was an ordinary looking letter and put that aside while I took care of the erection trying not to think of ghosts.<br />
<br />
A moment later, as I was ready to go, I was opened the letter and began reading:<br />
<br />
Dear Heir,<br />
<br />
Congratulations on passing the test for possession of the house! I am sorry I could not give you more warning as I needed insurance that you could handle the immense responsibilities that come with it. It is a special house as you have no doubt realized.<br />
<br />
The trial was in place to find someone with your ability to see through the illusions. The house doesn&#39;t understand mortality and will inevitably keep trying to bring me back or at the very least, remove you. It will seduce you into aging and growing more and more like me, until you ARE me... an old man on his death bed, soon to expire. It will continue this until you take proper ownership of it.<br />
<br />
I will try to explain. In my long life I have studied cultures far and wide. Each culture has varying beliefs of magic and religion. In one of my trips I purchased an ancient spell book, purely for scholarly purposes, which I had translated upon my return. I found out the ancient language it was written in was dead so on my next trip I labored to learn the phonetic rules of the ancient language and re-translated the spells into their phonetic version.<br />
<br />
Upon finishing my first translation, I read the spell, using the intended connotation and emphasis for the first time. You will imagine my surprise when, within seconds, a bird flew into the window repeatedly, desperately trying to reach me. It only took me 5 times to realize the reading of the spell and the birds were related. Though pigeon isn&#39;t my first choice of a meal, if I was desperate, I would have to say the summon food spell worked.<br />
<br />
From that point on I began working with the magical arts contained in the book, and had a renewed interest in creating the spells phonetically. I didn&#39;t have interest in performing all the spells though I did translate them all in case they were one day needed.<br />
<br />
This house will try to protect itself by bringing me back, or by making you incapable of &quot;stealing it&quot; from me. Having made it out of the house without becoming me, someone, or some thing else, you have proven you can handle the spellbook, seeing that the sentient house spell was the most powerful, though others come close. This house, once claimed, will attempt to make you happy. Rooms and decorations may appear, disappear, or change size and shape to suit your tastes, do not be alarmed as it will attempt to do the same for you making you more the man you want to be. <br />
<br />
One time back in the 40s I had wanted to loose weight but had not showed the house appreciation, in spite of me she had made the path to my bedroom extremely long including a 100 step staircase... but I digress. <br />
<br />
A few notes of caution: <br />
Be sure to introduce staff to the house or they are liable to be transformed into what the house thinks will please you. I lost 3 house cleaners, a butler, and a chef that way. One became a painting, 2 became chickens, one a horse, and one a topiary. Sad really.<br />
Be cautious of where guests go, only the rooms in which you have performed the de-energizing ceremony, are safe for them, or it will be like when you first met the house but with worse results!<br />
Perform the claiming spell if you haven&#39;t already! The spell room is in the basement, through the lounge and in the back of the study.<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
I finished reading the letter, finding its contents nearly as unbelievable as the actions which just transpired... &quot;The drugs, it must be the drugs they gave me to kidnap me...&quot; I told myself, knowing full well that hallucinogens and sedatives are very different.<br />
<br />
I stood up and noticed myself in the mirror. The first thing I saw was that my shirt was significantly longer than it was and had pale red markings. Before I stepped foot in the room it was plain white like the room I woke up in. The shirt appeared to be mimicking the nightgown of Theo. The most alarming thing however had nothing to do with the clothes, but my face.<br />
<br />
I slowly put my hand to my cheek and felt the face full of coarse stubble that had grown there. Not ten minutes ago I was clean shaven and normally it grows in spotty. I seem to be mimicking Theo... Everything else was normal me... if the letter didn&#39;t distract me and pull me out of my trance...<br />
<br />
That is the moment I accepted the idea. As outrageous as it sounded, I truly seemed to be in real danger of becoming someone else against my will. Based on the numbers, 4 years ago and 60 some odd people, if I don&#39;t get out or successfully read that spell, I will most likely be dead and replaced by the next possible heir within two and a half weeks. <br />
<br />
Then the most horrible thought occurred, Great Great Uncle Ted or Theo as the house calls him, is testing for a natural ability to see through the house&#39;s ploys. I was distracted by touching something unexpected. What if I don&#39;t have the natural ability and I get sucked into the next vision?</p>
