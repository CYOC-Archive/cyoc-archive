<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Penny was walking to her car after a long evening at work. She was a part time waitress and the cold air was biting at the revealing outfit she was wearing to get the best tips. Her breasts shook as she walked and the tight dress hugged her body. Literally the only thing off about her appearance was the fact she has messy hair and sweat on her body courtesy of having to vaccum after shift. One of the cooks was lugging a garbage bag out to the dumpster and he paused and called to her for help. She just ignored him. He could handle the trash and the chances of her bringing herself low enough to do such a menial task was out of the question. Vacuuming was bad enough let alone touching leftovers from people plates.<br />
<br />
Penny reached her car and placed a hand on the door handle. It was already unlocked and she blinked unable to remember if she had locked it or not beforehand. Either way she didn’t care, she just wanted to get home and go on social media for a few hours. She sat down in the car and turned the key for ignition. The little beat up Red car took off into the night and Penny gazed left and right while speeding through the nighttime roads. A few cars appeared but nothing spectacular. She ignored stop signs and stop lights as no one was out until she hit one of the lights with a traffic cam. Here she ground to a halt, reached into her purse and pulled out a tube of lipstick. She brought the sun blocker down and stared in the mirror. Behind her was a human being in the back of her car.<br />
<br />
“THERE CAN ONLY BE ONE!” Candice shouted before her hands fell on Penny’s shoulders. Penny gave a scream of terror as Candice literally melted over her and their bodies began to lose definition until they were just a blob of flesh in the front seat of a car stopped at a red light. The light turned green and hands and feet emerged from the blob. It drove forward as a head formed along with eyes, a mouth, and every other feminine part. She looked like Candice but with the alluring curves of Penny thrown in. Candice smirked as clothes formed over her and her hair sprouted from her head again.<br />
<br />
She was absolutely hot but there was a part of her that hadn’t merged with Penny. Penny’s mind was screaming in the back of her own so Candice turned the car around and pulled into the alleyway behind Penny’s workplace. She put the car in park and moved to the passenger seat. She held an arm out and fleshy material moved down it dripping off her arm until it separated from her body as a fleshy lump. Candice then opened the passenger door now in possession of the hot body that had attracted Billy to Penny in the first place. She spunk down into the alleyway and the blob of flesh left in the driver’s seat began to wobble.<br />
<br />
First arms and legs differentiated from the body followed by a head. Toes and fingers formed along with facial features that were rather plain. Deep brown hair shot out of her head falling to her shoulders before tying itself into a ponytail. Blue eyes blinked open as the torso grew into a thin frame with height. Penny grew small A cup breasts and a slight bulge to her hips but she was otherwise scrawny, a very different body type from the lucious and curvy one she had before. Her skin was pale and freckles popped into existence on her shoulders and on the bridge of her nose. Clothing began to form over her as black dress pants and a white t-shirt with a crew neck appeared. This was followed by a blue plaid shirt with short sleeves left untucked and two black dress socks and two black dress shoes. She blinked a few times as her vision got worse before correctional lenses formed. Penny could suddenly think again but reality had shifted. She was no longer a slutty and attractive girl who made boys drool at the sight of her, she was now a scrawny and tomboyish girl with a respectable wardrobe that lacked femininity. Gone we’re her piercings and secret tattoos, gone we’re her memories of sex, and gone was he wardrobe that had contained the most revealing clothing imaginable. Her knowledge of alcohol was now thanks to her job and having to understand what customers ordered and her weekends were empty. There were gaps in who she was and nothing was filling them.<br />
<br />
Penny pulled back into work where James sat on a milk crate waiting for his mother to pick him up. She rolled down the passenger window and called to him, “Want a ride?”<br />
<br />
James shrugged and within seconds he was in the car with him. The previous memories of Penny being an abrasive coworker were now gone. All the gossiping she did was gone. She began to drive him home and he thanked her.<br />
<br />
“Oh you’re welcome,” Penny replied, “What are you up to tonight?”<br />
<br />
“Not much, my brother is out of town so I don’t have anyone to play D &D with,” James replied with a shrug. Penny was hit with a wave of blankness as holes began to fill in. She and James immediately sprung into conversation about Dungeons and Dragons as she suddenly became just as big a dweeb as he was. Every word caused Penny’s personality to undergo more change until the reality was that she and James had been playing the game together for years, before that she had been pushing him around and roughhousing with boys but as they got bigger and roughhousing became less possible she got into the game. So they drove off towards James’ house with completely new realities. Billy cheating on Candice with Penny was forgotten as Billy had no reason to find Oenng attractive.</p>
