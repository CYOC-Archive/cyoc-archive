<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was a Saturday morning, their day off. Adam was sitting on the couch scrolling through his phone and sipping a cup of coffee, while his husband Hector was outside messing around in the garden. Adam was a young man in his late 20s; he had a lean and wiry body and blond hair, with green eyes. His husband was in his late forties, a strong and hirsute man whom Adam had met and fallen in love with while he was in college. They loved each other dearly, but lately, they’d been a little frustrated. With their different work hours, they saw each other like ships in the night during the week, and even on their free days Hector’s heart drugs often interfered with his…circulation. Adam never begrudged him; he loved his husband and he wanted him to be healthy and happy, but he was eager to find something that would help them jumpstart their love life. <br />
<br />
His interest was piqued when he got a suggestion from his app service about something called a “Dicking Roulette” game. Adam arched and eyebrow and followed the link, reading the description of the app and its features. What closeted Java-junkies wrote this crazy thing up, he wondered to himself. He pressed the ‘download’ button just as his husband came sauntering through the door.<br />
<br />
“Hey, babe,” he called, wiping his heavy boots on the doormat. He crossed the room and leaned down to give Adam a kiss. “What are you doing?” he said, in a mock-accusing tone. Hector was a big man, with broad, strong chest and a bushy beard that Adam was pleased to see he had been growing out lately. <br />
<br />
“Nothing; just checking out this funny sex game app.” replied Adam.<br />
<br />
“You weirdo kids and your phones,” he teased as he filled a glass with water from the sink.<br />
<br />
“Says the ‘old man’ who stays up all night watching youtube videos.” Adam snickered, as Hector leaned down to kiss him again.<br />
<br />
“I’ll be out in the garden for another minute, babe,” he called over his shoulder, before stepping back outside.<br />
<br />
Adam turned his attention back to his phone. He opened up the app and read the introduction: “Homan Technologies Presents: the Dicking Roulette App! With the press of a button, you can spin and win a chance to become your own cock! Time lengths vary at random: please select beginner, intermediate, or expert.” He laughed and rolled his eyes, realizing that it must be some sort of kinky roleplay game or something. Adam went along with it anyway, pressing the button that said ‘beginner’. On the screen was a picture of himself and Hector. He pressed Hector’s picture, and the app asked him for a choice: ‘Personal Transformation’ or ‘Transform and Transfer’. Adam pressed the former, and a little roulette wheel with a timer appeared, with a big red button that read ‘SPIN ME’. Out of curiosity, Adam pressed it just to see what else happened. The button flashed and the wheel spun theatrically for a few seconds before settling on a pair of numbers: 30, followed by the word ‘minutes’. A timer started counting down from 30 seconds. <br />
<br />
“Hey, babe!” Adam called from the couch. “Come check this out!”<br />
<br />
A few seconds later, he heard a thumping on the porch and Hector came in to see what Adam wanted. “What’s up, babe? I got the water running and…” but he was cut off as the thirty-second timer ended with a beep and Adam’s phone let out a flash that filled the room. He heard a deep yelp and a slid thump on the ground and then it was over. Adam rubbed his eyes and looked around.<br />
<br />
“Babe?” he called, getting up from the couch. He was shocked to see Hector’s clothes piled on the ground, his husband nowhere in sight. “What the hell?” he stooped down and picked up his husbands battered jeans, jumping when he felt something fall out the leg and onto the ground.<br />
<br />
“Ow, my head!” he heard Hector’s voice cry out, smaller and muffled somehow. Adam pulled the clothes away and gasped when he saw a large, semi-hard cock and balls lying solitary on the floor. “Adam, what happened! Why can’t I move?” Hector’s voice cried out again, clearer this time. <br />
<br />
“Hector, is that you?” Adam asked tentatively, leaning closer to examine the thing. He’d spent the better part of the last five years sucking and getting fucked by this cock and the man it was once attached to. He knew his husband’s cock when he saw it.<br />
<br />
“Yes! Why am I naked?” the cock throbbed and pulsed as it talked through its piss-slit. “Help me off the ground, its cold!”<br />
<br />
“Uh, okay.” Adam reached out and picked up the cock in his slender hands; it was warm and heavy in his grasp, and he could even feel a heartbeat. His balls roiled and tensed in Adam’s palm.<br />
<br />
“Babe, why are you so big, I…oh,” Hector sighed as Adam began to gently massage Hector’s big balls, his shaft beginning to stretch and harden. “Oh, god, why do I feel so good?” he moaned. <br />
<br />
“Hector, baby, I think I turned you into your own cock.” Adam said, his other hand curling around Hector’s growing shaft. <br />
<br />
“That would explain why I can’t move. But how?” he asked, as Adam took him to the couch and sat down.<br />
<br />
“I guess this app I downloaded was the real deal.” He said, looking down at his phone screen with both hands still wrapped around his husband-cock. <br />
<br />
“An app did this? Wait, for how long?” Hector asked, shrinking a little with fear.<br />
<br />
“Thirty…twenty-eight minutes, and change.” Adam said, putting down the phone and shifting Hector so that his head was pointing up at Adam, his balls resting on Adam’s own growing hard-on.<br />
<br />
“Why are you looking at me like that?” asked Hector, wondering how he himself could see or even talk when his head was just the head of his own cock. <br />
<br />
“Because, you look so cute like this.” Adam answered, running his slender fingers along Hector’s soft, veined skin. His husband certainly did have a nice cock: he was growing to his full 8 inches, his girthy body throbbing and growing in Adam’s closed hand. His big, purple head peaked out of his foreskin, and Hector moaned and leaked precum from his mouth as Adam ran his thumb along the sensitive strip of flesh that ran from his chin to his throat. <br />
<br />
“It feels good like this,” he admitted. “I mean, I love my cock as much as you do, but being my cock is something else. Don’t stop, baby.” He said, as Adam increased the pace of his stroking. He lifted Hector up, turned on by how weighty he was even as a cock and brought the head up to his mouth.<br />
<br />
“Wait, babe! I haven’t showered!” Hector complained. Adam stopped and took a whiff; Hector was right, he did smell pretty rank. <br />
<br />
“Well, then why don’t we wash ourselves up, baby?” Adam suggested, kissing the cock on the mouth before jumping up and running to the bathroom.<br />
<br />
“Slowdown, babe! Don’t drop me!” Hector yelled. <br />
<br />
Adam shut the bathroom door behind him and began running the tub. He dropped a generous amount of soaking salt into the water before laying his husband tenderly on a towel on the toilet seat and stripping out of his clothes. <br />
<br />
“You wanna take a bath?” the cock asked, as Adam testing the water.<br />
<br />
“Why not?” he smiled. “Its Saturday, and I got you for twenty more minutes!” he said, grabbing Hector and stepping gingerly into the tub. He lowered himself into the hot water first, before tenderly dipping Hector in with him.<br />
<br />
“Damn, that’s hot!” he complained as Adam sunk him down up to his head.<br />
<br />
“But it feels good, right?” he said, sighing against the tub.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, it really does. Oh damn, baby you should try this. The warm water against my cock…or against me I guess, heh. It feels great.” He started to grow large and firm again in contentment.<br />
<br />
“Maybe I’ll go next. Do you need to breath?” he wondered.<br />
<br />
The cock’s head twitched. “I dunno. Put me under and try it.” Adam pulled Hector under the water by the balls. Hector held his breath for as long as he could, before he realized he wasn’t holding anything at all. He was a cock; he didn’t need to breath! He sighed and relaxed as Adam released him and he floated to the top, basking in the warmth. <br />
<br />
“Babe, you’re rubber duck I wished I had when I was a teenager,” Adam laughed, reaching out and pulling the cock closer to him so that it was drifting over his submerged stomach. <br />
<br />
“Whatever, just soap me up, you perv!” Hector retorted with a laugh. Adam obliged and reached for the soap, lathering his hands well before picking Hector up out of the water and running his soapy hands along the length of his body. Hector moaned and throbbed as Adam thoroughly washed along his shaft and his big, heaving balls. He washed Hector’s sensitive foreskin, tickling the head of the cock with his fingers before dunking him under the water to rinse him off. He leaned back and kept a grip on Hector, with his other hand stroking his own modest erection. <br />
<br />
“Thanks, babe. How much time do you think we got?” the cock asked him.<br />
<br />
“I didn’t bring my phone, but probably about ten minutes, maybe less.” Adam said.<br />
<br />
“Can you make me cum, please? While I’m like this?” Hector asked, his head throbbing hopefully.<br />
<br />
“I thought you’d never ask,” Adam replied, putting his other hand around Hector’s body and bringing him to his lips. Hector moaned as Adam’s soft mouth enveloped his head; Adam kissed and licked Hector’s head like he was making out with the man himself before pushing his husband deeper down his throat. He could hear Hector humming with pleasure inside him as he thrusted him back and forth, holding the dicked man by the balls. He pushed Hector deeper to free a hand, with which Adam began to stroke himself as he sucked his husband. He moved his tongue and flexed his throat, smiling as best as he could when he felt the cock buck and pulse in his grip. He pulled Hector back out a few inches, stroking the thick cock while lovingly kissing and massaging Hector’s cockhead with his mouth. Hector groaned as he felt his body become harder than ever; his giant balls tensed and the pleasure seemed to concentrate on his head before it burst and he came. He throbbed and heaved as he felt his balls pump his load through his body and down Adam’s hungry throat. Adam’s satisfied sighs and moans around his body signaled his own climax; Adam tensed as he came and tainted the water of his bath. Hector could feel himself growing softer and more tired, shuddering when he felt Adam grasp his sensitive balls and pull him out of his lover’s throat. He felt himself get placed back into the warm, soothing water, and he floated there for a moment while Adam leaned back against the tub and they both collected themselves. Adam heard the muffled sound of a notification from his phone, and another blinding white flash, and with a loud splash and the sloshing of a lot of water on the floor, his husband appeared in the tub.<br />
<br />
Hector looked down at his muscular, hairy chest with wide eyes, his big hands drifting down to feel his big cock, still semi-hard from Adam’s ministrations.<br />
<br />
“Wow, baby. That was wild!” he laughed, running his wet hands through his thick hair. “I’ve never cum like that in my life! But next time, ask first, babe.” He said, arching an admonishing eyebrow in Adam’s direction.<br />
<br />
“Sorry, I didn’t really understand what it even did, let alone that it would work.” Adam said sheepishly, adjusting himself so that he was laying against hector’s expansive chest. <br />
<br />
“It’s alright, babe. But, after we mop all this water,” He looked down at Adam with a mischievous gleam in his eyes. “It’s your turn!”</p>
