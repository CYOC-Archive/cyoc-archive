<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff went to the shower and started to clean himself up. He couldn&#39;t believe just how big he&#39;d gotten. It was insane! Every muscle on his body seemed to be developed perfectly for football, rugby, water polo and a few more. He could feel the strength rolling through every part of him and his body just felt so masculine. But then he thought of Mike. <br />
<br />
Just that single thought made his body keel over in delight. He had to use his massive hand to hold himself back up, but his cock throbbed happily at the image of the other man. Even if Jeff was incredibly masculine and well built, next to Mike, he was almost nothing. He felt so small. So submissive. And so protected. <br />
<br />
&quot;Damn it...&quot; Jeff cursed as he felt the need to jerk off again run through his body. That tingle deep inside his asshole was back and his fingers were scratching it. Even if it was absentmindedly, he knew he needed to respect Mike&#39;s wishes and get cleaned up. His tail flicked back and forth as he dried himself off. He didn&#39;t have nearly as much fur as Mike and was almost a bit jealous of the untamed mane the bigger man was able to keep.<br />
<br />
Jeff went back to his room and pulled out a football jersey. It was weird how natural it felt. The entire place had changed around him, yet nothing felt out of place. The posters and games he had before were replaced by trophies and pictures of famous sports guys. He had a full set of weights in the corner along with massive containers of protein supplements along with a mini fridge full of milk and other weight gainers. <br />
<br />
&quot;Jesus...&quot; Jeff complained. The new memories were mixing in with his old ones and it was a little hard to focus. He tried his best to ignore it and finish getting ready. Though his eyes lingered on the computer. The screensaver had come up. &#39;No using the computer without daddy&#39;s permission...&#39; rang through his head. He tried to fight it off, but it only grew stronger and harsher as he tried to disobey.<br />
<br />
&quot;Damn it,&quot; Jeff cursed again. But he was a bit confused when he found himself on the floor. He hadn&#39;t even realized that he&#39;d fallen over. &quot;What the hell?&quot; he looked around and then at the computer again. Then thought about using it. The pain returned and he doubled over again and his hands were back on the carpet, barely holding his body up. &quot;Sh-shit,&quot; he grit his teeth as he realized he can&#39;t change anything without Mike&#39;s permission. <br />
<br />
&quot;JEFF!&quot; Mike called. &quot;Are you coming to watch the game or not?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I am!&quot; Jeff called back. &quot;Just finished getting ready!&quot; He got up off the floor and headed downstairs. Never in Jeff&#39;s life had he been interested in the game of football. He&#39;d watch one occasionally. But it was never the game he was interested in. <br />
<br />
When Jeff got downstairs, he saw that Finn and Dave had already been let in. It was pretty common for them to come over on Sundays and watch the game with Mike. Dave and Mike were pretty good friends growing up but after high school they&#39;d parted ways a bit as Dave went to college and Mike went into construction. Jeff wondered how much of that was still true or if there&#39;s something else that happened to Mike as well. Though, with his massive lion body, it&#39;d be impossible to not be useful on one. Meanwhile, Dave had an office job that allowed him to get fat. It was little at first, but over the years he&#39;d clearly been gaining weight as his job required no physical exertion at all. <br />
<br />
Finn on the other hand was still playing football. Jeff knew he wasn&#39;t one of the starters, rather he was third string and was barely ever on the field. He still worked out with the other guys and had a decent enough body, but it wasn&#39;t nearly as primed and ready to go as anyone else on the team. Especially Jeff. <br />
<br />
Jeff squinted at the realization. He played football. Starter. Every game. The team rallied around him sometimes even though he wasn&#39;t the quarterback. It was so weird. A sense of pride and accomplishment filled him, thinking about all the games they won because of him. He was able to block two guys at once and could last almost the entire game without needing too much of a break. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey bud, beer,&quot; Mike shook his empty can. <br />
<br />
&quot;Right,&quot; Jeff was brought back down to reality as the new memories took hold. He started off for the kitchen.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, get me one too!&quot; Dave called to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure thing,&quot; Jeff said. As he turned around, he could have sworn he felt the phone Finn was looking at train on him and then take a picture of his backside. He ignored it and went into the kitchen grabbing one beer then closed the door. &#39;This is for--&#39; he tried to think Dave, to disobey the command Mike had given him. But the thought was instantly interrupted by, &#39;Mike.&#39; He tried it again. &#39;This beer is for--Mike.&#39; &quot;Hmm...&quot; Jeff thought, then closed the door. He took a few steps away holding the one beer. <br />
<br />
Nothing. <br />
<br />
Nothing was telling him that he had to listen to Dave. Only Mike. He turned back grabbed three more and tossed one to each of the guys sitting on the couch. Finn fumbled his slightly, showing why he was third string. <br />
<br />
&quot;Good man,&quot; Mike pet him on the head. His big arms stretched across the couch positioning itself behind Jeff&#39;s shoulders. Jeff felt the urge to cuddle up into daddy&#39;s big strong body and feel his strong body, but he knew Mike didn&#39;t like it in front of company. <br />
<br />
Dave scoffed a bit. &quot;How&#39;d you do it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh?&quot; Mike asked but smiled as though he knew the answer.<br />
<br />
Dave rolled his eyes. &quot;Come on man. Don&#39;t make me spell it out,&quot; but Mike continued to stay silent. Though a wry grin was seeping out of the side of his maw. &quot;Fine. Look. I know I&#39;ve always been jealous of you. Hell, I think damn near everyone is. But you got the house, the car, the body and a kid who actually listens to you. Mine can&#39;t even look up from his phone long enough to catch a can of beer let alone a football, but you got an all-star kid on your hands. How&#39;d you do it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well Jeff got this thing on his computer and I just typed all the things that I ever wanted. Then it all happened,&quot; he paused, watching Dave&#39;s face drop. Then burst out into laughter. His strong arm pulled Jeff into his meaty chest. &quot;I&#39;m kidding! I&#39;m kidding! I really had you going there though. Nah man. After I found out this one wasn&#39;t actually mine,&quot; he shook Jeff a little bit in his arm. &quot;I decided to say fuck it and actually give him the best life that he could possibly ever have. He knows that I&#39;ve given him the world and treats me as such. That&#39;s all.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait. What?&quot; Jeff uttered softly into Mike&#39;s body. He suddenly remembered the divorce and how he was split between the two parents. How Mike was always trying to get him interested in sports or just hanging out with him and how he was a bit of a prick back. He just wanted to play on his computer or video games because that&#39;s what his mom would let him do. But now there was no split between two parents only a clean break and he stayed with Mike instead of his mom who wanted nothing to do with him. <br />
<br />
&quot;But...&quot; Dave started off. &quot;If he&#39;s not yours... Then why&#39;s he,&quot; he pointed at the two. &quot;You know...&quot;<br />
<br />
Mike belted out another laugh. &quot;You know what? I don&#39;t know,&quot; Mike lied. &quot;Maybe I just rubbed off on him. Or maybe he just wanted me to be like his father so bad and a blue fairy came down and granted him the wish. Who the fuck knows?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe,&quot; Dave laughed right along with Mike.</p>
