<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">(this may or not be the last chapter I make for this story. feel free to expand the lore if you want. I encourage this in all my work.) <br />
<br />
&quot;well clean bill of health for you four,&quot; Travis said. he walked with them to the front of the mobile building. it looked like those buildings that you see in alien movies. &quot;what about before? with college I mean&quot; Grey grunted at the second sentence he hadn&#39;t meant to say. since the change, the anthro hammerhead seemed to be the main talker of the group.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I won&#39;t sugarcoat it. we are unsure if we can return you to normal. the best case scenario is finding the individual with the necklace and making them turn you all back.&quot; Travis said as they went outside. they were in a large vacant lot close to the beach. &quot;what about Cole and our frat house&quot; Zach said.  <br />
<br />
from their previous conversations, the anthro lion had become bolder than he was in his old human form. sighing Travis said &quot;That&#39;s the biggest problem. The latter I mean&quot; he led them to the van. &quot;from the previous victims we found this out. their bodies while doing what the transformation tells them. You&#39;ll no doubt find yourselves dramatically altering your house.  <br />
<br />
however, my team will send any non-perishable items to a storage unit until we can get you back to your old selves&quot; As they drove he continued. &quot;no doubt you&#39;ll need income. what are you all good at?&quot; Travis asked them. &quot;I&#39;m good at artwork. grey works part-time at the surf shack. Zach does the same at the gym and Cole mostly cooks our food.&quot; Milo said. From Tanuki&#39;s conversations it was obvious he had very limited inhibitions. &quot;well after a week you four will get used to it. a new chapter is just starting for you guys&quot; Travis said as he dropped the four off. <br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
FOUR YEARS LATER... <br />
<br />
True to Travis&#39;s word their new lives were different. mare, terra, mutatio, or MTM for short was their new fraternity and it was for quite some time. it seemed to be a magnet for others who had been changed by treasures. and as the years passed the four could barely recall how to act like their old selves, not that it would&#39;ve helped. by the time they graduated, they had accepted their new lives, well most of them anyway. <br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
cole and several of his bodies opened a zoo together. each of them was feral or could shift to feral animals. a speedo (or unitard) was worn that matched their bodies. Cole found he had more energy than he did when he was first 25 years old and let&#39;s just say a few female gorillas now carry his children. &quot;ah sir we&#39;ve got a lady complaining her Cole original has bananas in it and demanding to see you.&quot; Patrick the lion shifter said.  <br />
<br />
Approaching the snack shack he saw a blond in a red shirt arguing with Manny the feral raccoon. &quot;I said I want whoever owns this dump of a zoo. I have a banana allergy and here you are you little thief trying to poison me. now where is this Cole guy....&quot; The woman heard Cole&#39;s heavy breathing behind her. turning she dropped her cup and screamed. banana was clearly on her breath indicating she was trying to scam the zoo. so Cole roared at her and she ran off. &quot;thanks, boss. can&#39;t believe she would even try that. I mean we have the ingredients on the sign&quot; Manny said. Cole grinned and signed. &#39;no problem. happy to help&#39; he then headed in the direction of the gorilla enclosure. he heard Lulu was arriving soon. <br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
milo had found he was granted a transformative power. As a tanuki, he could change stuff by putting leaves on it. he had tried to use it to give him his old human body but got a man who looked similar to his tanuki form.  <br />
<br />
he found he made a killing to those affected by the treasures or just wanted a new look. he hugged his fiance Andrea as they snuggled in his art studio. let&#39;s just say a lot of his work was nude and so was he when he made it. &quot;so what do you want to do next&quot; she asked him. &quot;well we could watch something, choose a wedding cake or some art&quot; he said knowing they&#39;d probably do one of the latter two.  <br />
<br />
&quot;hmm... let&#39;s do some art first then we can choose the cake&quot; she grinned as she took off her clothes. he had his windows tinted so the neighbors wouldn&#39;t peep in. he could feel his dick get hard as he sketched her. After that, they had to take some time before they could get to the bakery. let&#39;s just say his sketch now had him on it as well. <br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Zach had worked at the gym throughout college and soon became the owner of the place. he had also become the face of a brand of cosmetics sold at what was now called Zach&#39;s Mane attraction gym. he smiled as he entered his apartment with pizza. Normally he didn&#39;t eat unhealthy food but this was his and Nancy&#39;s two-month anniversary. &quot;babe meat lovers special, I love it.&quot; Nancy said. &quot;well only the best for my love, if you feel like it, we can go on a nature hike,&quot; Zach said before the two kissed. they had met on a nature hike so it was always special to them. <br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Finally, there was grey. he had become a lifeguard at the very beach where his life had changed. while he would say it was to show a shark in the water there was no need to scream he didn&#39;t mean it.  <br />
<br />
the change prevented him from ever announcing it but he was hoping the person with the necklace would show up. a foolish notion but he couldn&#39;t shake what the person did. he snatched away years of his and his sister&#39;s lives not to mention the four of them&#39;s feminine bodies. truth is if he could he would just be depressed. his boyfriend had broken up with him after a week of his change.  <br />
<br />
the worst part was he said he was &quot;fine with it bro, bang a chick for me will ya&quot;. if he could he would drown himself in these waters. &quot;still hoping for them to show themselves&quot; he heard a familiar voice. Travis had kept tabs on all the victims of the person. &quot;any luck finding the bling&quot; Grey said. Travis had basically become a surrogate parent after his mother or rather his brother Cole changed into a feral gorilla. <br />
<br />
he wished his &#39;favorite&#39; outfit consisted more of a speedo at this moment. sighing Travis mentioned &quot;Nah they&#39;re crafty. not to mention more treasures are being found every day&quot; he then got right in front of the anthro&#39;s chair. &quot;I&#39;ve been keeping an eye on you and your family. They have all moved on with their lives. You on the other hand just stay at the beach all the time&quot; Travis then said something that got Grey&#39;s attention.  <br />
<br />
&quot;How would you like a new job? one tasked with helping those who have changed and stopping the person responsible&quot; he offered his hand. grey took it in a heartbeat. &quot;I&#39;m all for saving lives. When do I start?&quot; he asked. the two then drove in a modified van. &quot;well a teen nearby seemed to have picked up a necklace that turned him into a mermaid. Poor thing can&#39;t breathe air anymore and is stuck in a public pool&quot; The van soon stopped. while not what he wanted he got out. one day he&#39;d make the person pay for what he did to his family.</p>
