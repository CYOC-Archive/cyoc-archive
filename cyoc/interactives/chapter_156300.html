<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Hermia sighed as she watched Sharon exit, slightly larger than before. This wasn&#39;t the first time that Hebe had done something like this, nor would it likely be the last. The Fates and Heracles had both complained of Hebe&#39;s tendencies to make a mess of their loom and take his best athletes back further than their prime. In truth it was Hebe&#39;s own desire for Heracles to forget his first wife Megara and the eight children that they had had together, and give her children of her own playing themselves out. It was fated that Hebe would have twin sons, Alexiares and Anicetus--and knowing her fate, it wasn&#39;t surprising that she often made men into fraternal twins in a woman&#39;s waiting womb. Heracles knew what his third wife wanted, but like all gods was being stubborn in refusing her for whatever whim of a reason he had, and Hebe was taking her frustrations out on the mortals they served at the spa.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sharon, are you all right?&quot; asked Judy, who had been sitting with her father but a few minutes ago before the loom of the fates had had to weave themselves completely different to suit her instead as younger sister to an older brother, and now younger sister to her former mother. The thread of life coming from Judy was already tangled in knots, confused and twisted beyond all recognition.<br />
<br />
&quot;Heavenly. Getting a massage was just the thing for me and my babies,&quot; cooed Sharon as she rubbed her slightly extended stomach.<br />
<br />
&quot;Judy, your turn,&quot; beckoned Hebe from her door, which took the young woman off guard.<br />
<br />
&quot;Me? But I--&quot; she started.<br />
<br />
&quot;Trust me, it&#39;s heavenly sis,&quot; assured Sharon, and with some reluctance, Judy approached whatever fate Hebe had in store for the tangled knot that was Judy. As her mistress&#39; door closed, Hermia stared at the satiated and glowing Sharon before picking up the phone on her desk and dialing his number. He would fix this entire situation and bring it to a close.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sir, this is Hermia. I&#39;m afraid I have some troubling news,&quot; she said into the phone.<br />
---------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
&quot;Take off your clothes and lay down in the tub, and I&#39;ll be right with you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What treatment am I in here for? I was just waiting--&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s a special I run for two sisters called the Sorority Package. Two massages for one low price.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But I&#39;m not even out of high school yet. I&#39;ve got a few months until I graduate, what do I need an anti-aging massage for?&quot; asked Judy, still apprehensive, though disrobing nonetheless, all be it slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Think of it as a preventative measure, Jude.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Judy,&quot; corrected the young high school senior.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not for long,&quot; said Hebe under her breath as she helped Judy step into tub and lay on her back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now relax, this will be a much more pleasurable experience for you if you just relax...&quot; said Hebe as she cupped some water and ensured every part of Judy was wet. In order to mold her into Sharon&#39;s new man she first needed to wet the clay she was going to reshape after all, and the water acted as a calming sedative as every bit of Judy was whetted and made ready to be shaped. She began by trailing her fingers lightly along Judy&#39;s inner thighs, working her fingertips gently and slowly up to her vagina. She began by circling the vagina a few turns, resisting the urge to push the mud of age out of the inelastic folds of her labia and instead reached her finger inside until she found it--Judy&#39;s clitoris, which she slowly began to massage and begin her magic in reshaping. It slowly swelled at her touch, becoming larger and longer, beginning to poke out of Judy&#39;s folds as it slowly began to reshape and grow veins that fed its growth longer, bigger, and thicker until the engorged clitoris was the size of a well-endowed uncircumcised cock of nine inches hard. That would most certainly be large enough, with a little room to grow perhaps in a few years, and pleasurable enough for Sharon, but an enlarged clitoris did not make a penis--yet.<br />
<br />
Hebe then began work on shifting Judy&#39;s internal &quot;plumbing&quot; about with a few strokes here and pushes there, shifting the urethra from its original position to that of the new penis, and then pushing the ovaries and Fallopian tubes down into the folds of the labia, preparing their shift into becoming the scrotum, her ovaries into testes, and the tubes into the vas deferens and epididymis. Hebe shrank the uterus, split it, and shifted on half into that of the seminal vesicle that along with the new testes would allow Judy to produce semen, and the other into the prostate Judy would need as a man. Finally having reshaped the &quot;plumbing&quot; Hebe then fully closed Judy&#39;s vaginal canal. The cervix shifting and hardening into the pubic bone, and the vaginal canal tissue rejoining until nothing was there, and the transformation of Judy&#39;s reproductive system from a woman&#39;s to man&#39;s had finished, and Hebe began to massage the remaining labia to lower and hand and join into a full fledged scrotum, the former ovaries, now testes growing plump and eager to begin their work as the last of Judy&#39;s eggs turned into the building blocks of semen production and testoserone.<br />
<br />
All through this process, Judy had moaned in pleasure, and now to finish her transformation down there, Hebe had to make the new reproductive system ejaculate to be sure she&#39;d aligned everything properly. So she began stroking and massaging Judy&#39;s new cock, her breathing picking up as her moans became hot and heavy with lust. Hebe knew just how to push her male guests over the edge quickly and efficiently until Judy&#39;s uncircumcised hood began to pull back and a rope of cum began to shoot from the engorged member Judy had.<br />
<br />
Judy&#39;s thoughts and memories were beginning to blur as she began to think of herself as a hermaphrodite of sorts, born with a man&#39;s reproductive system, but otherwise having the body of a woman. The Androgynous nature of her body caused her parents to home school her, especially as breast buds began forming.<br />
<br />
Satisfied with her handy work, Hebe now turned her attention to the rest of Judy, beginning with her feet, massaging them and enlarging them--preparing them for the new physique that Judy would need them to hold. It was as Judy&#39;s feet begain to crack and extend to a size fourteen men&#39;s shoe, that Hebe was interrupted by her door bursting open. Thankfully the trance Judy was under kept her from reacting, but it almost had cause Hebe to flub a toe.<br />
<br />
Hebe expected such an entrance from her husband Heracles--he&#39;d done it before, but when she lifted her head and saw who was standing in the door, her face paled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Daddy,&quot; squeaked Hebe.<br />
<br />
Zeus, the towering thunder god and father to both Hebe and Heracles stood there and announced &quot;Hebe, I have heard enough complaints from the Fates and your husband of your treatment of the mortals. Their loom is all a tangles, your husband&#39;s finest athletes yet to be born, and there&#39;s a veritable plague of fraternal twin boys being born.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If my husband would perform his duties...&quot; began Hebe.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh don&#39;t think he&#39;ll get off lightly in this, but you are not to go about causing anymore havoc among the loom of the fates, is that understood? It is one thing to relieve someone of a few years--it is entirely another to go about making someone so young as to change their parentage&quot; thundered Zeus.<br />
<br />
&quot;And what of the mortal I am in the midst of finishing in an attempt to keep the Fates happy?&quot; asked Hebe sullenly.<br />
<br />
Zeus looked over at Judy, in the midst of her transformation and sighed, saying, &quot;Finish it, and then take the rest of the day off. You&#39;ll find your husband home and ready to give you the sons you so desire. And if he should not, then I give you leave to give him a little treatment of his own to remind him the joys that a boy can bring to a loving mother. After all, if he wants to act like a boy, he can certainly be one again... for a time.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hebe flushed in anticipation before nodding her head dutifully as her father took his leave of her massage parlor. She closed the door and now saw Judy as the last impediment to her getting what she had always wanted, the full attention of her husband and the children she had been promised by the Fates oh so long ago. She had to work quickly, for she did not want to delay matters any... and yet she knew a rushed job would give her a bad name, so she had to be deft and skillful at the same time--a true challenge, and one Hebe felt up to.<br />
<br />
Hebe returned to Judy, strengthening the achilles tendon and the ankles in preparation for working her way up Judy&#39;s soft shaved legs. Already, some tufts of hair had sprouted from Judy&#39;s now masculine feet, and as she worked her way around the ankles, more hairs, previously shaved, began to grow back and multiply as the testoserone from Judy&#39;s new testes had had enough time to begin pumping the hormone through Judy&#39;s body to begin small hormonal changes, like hair sprouting on her legs, arms, a bit of scruff on her face, and chest, with a treasure trail leading straight to the thick untrimmed bush above the waiting penis that Hebe had already given Judy.<br />
<br />
Judy&#39;s thoughts were becoming clouded by the testosterone eminating through her body and beginning to reshape her mind. No longer did Judy seem appropriate a name, nor did she/her appropriate pronouns as the former high school senior began embracing the androgyny of their existence, thinking of themselves more as Jud--neither truly male nor female, despite what was between their legs--after all the hairy breasts, narrow shoulders, and wide birthing hips said otherwise.<br />
<br />
Jud&#39;s legs thickened and lengthened a bit as calf muscles grew larger, bones streched out a few inches, and thighs became sculpted with muscle. Hebe reached behind to shape the butt into something powerful enough to help support the thick hairy legs that had been given, while at the same time narrowing the hips into a more masculine standard. When Hebe had finished, from the waist down, Jud was all man, while above the waist the testosterone had shifted Jud slightly, but for the most part had left them largely female still.<br />
<br />
Jud&#39;s stomach thickened with muscle and tightened as abs began to appear. Their ribcage expanded, a few vertibre popped into alignment to give Jud&#39;s torso the length a body such as they needed to be aesthetically pleasing and the shoulders widened along with it, allowing for Jud&#39;s lungs to grow slightly to give them an advantage as an athlete that Hebe was shaping Jud into--somewhat in the mold of her husband. Jud&#39;s breasts were then massaged flat until they shifted into powerful pectoral muscles to accompany the abs already developed. Hebe then moved down to Jud&#39;s arms, shaping the muscles until they too matched the muscular athlete that Jud was becoming--growing longer to match the added height, thicker, and a tad bit clumsier about the thickening paws of hands and fingers for fine motor skills, but not enough to seriously disadvantage them.<br />
<br />
Now Jud&#39;s memories and associated gender began to shift again as they began to think of themselves as a he, and Jud began to think of his name as Jude. In everything but his face and voice, after all, he had the look and prowess of a man, young though he was at only eighteen and a high school senior looking to graduate and go to college along side his older high school sweetheart who said she had some unexpected news for him.<br />
<br />
All through the process Judy to Jud to Jude had moaned and sounded like that of a woman with her high vocal chords, but that was about to change, as Hebe thickened his neck to match the athlete she had made, and slowly formed the Adam&#39;s apple which lowered Jude&#39;s old soprano to that of an alto before settling into the warm range of a tenor--the voice of a young man of vitality and versatility. All the remained for Jude was his face. The scruff which was a young man&#39;s attempt at a beard remained as Jude&#39;s jawbone became more angular and defined and small other shifts about his head were made until Jude was left a long haired Adonis floating in Hebe&#39;s pool, and the memories of Jude looking &quot;mature for his age&quot; as well as his skill in bed explaining how he&#39;d managed as a freshman to win over Sharon, the high school senior. Now Sharon was a junior in college and their relationship still as strong and probably headier than it had ever been.<br />
<br />
The knots and tangles in Jude&#39;s life slowly began to unravel themselves as he took his place as the new father to Derrick and John, and all relations to Sharon or their babies were shifted to that of boyfriend and father. All that remained to finish the transformation and to make it permanent was for Jude to ejaculate fully as a man. With a light press of her finger at the cluster of nerves above Jude&#39;s penis, his member sprang to life, and Jude instinctively began to reach for his uncut dick. While Jude was focused on his own relief, Hebe swiftly picked up the former feminine clothes of Jude, and put them away as she pulled out Derrick&#39;s old clothes which were more suited for a young athletic man, and strewed them about as though Jude had taken them off instead of the former girl&#39;s clothing. Once Jude erupted in his first fully fledged male ejaculation, Hebe pressed Jude on the shoulder.<br />
<br />
&quot;Time to get up, your massage is finished, and your betrothed is waiting.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jude lifted his head out of the water in confusion, his rebelliously long hair clinging to his face as he asked &quot;Betrothed?&quot; in confusion. <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry, I just assumed that since you two were together and she was with child that you were--&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sharon&#39;s pregnant?&quot; asked Jude in astoundment, reality shifting to where Sharon had been hiding her pregnancy from Jude.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh dear, don&#39;t tell me I&#39;ve gone and ruined a little surprise,&quot; said Hebe.<br />
<br />
&quot;I... I gotta talk with Sharon,&quot; said Jude, as he with ease hurdled out of Hebe&#39;s tub, splashing water all over the floor and soaking his own clothes that he vaguely now remembered as his.<br />
<br />
&quot;Damn, I gotta be more careful,&quot; said Jude abashedly, looking somewhat like the boy Derrick had been when he&#39;d entered her parlor at the beginning of this mess.<br />
<br />
&quot;I have spare clothing you can change into if you need, though with a body like yours, you have nothing to be ashamed about, nor need to hide it,&quot; teased Hebe, causing Jude to blush rather boyishly as he dried off and wrapped a white towel firm around his waist.<br />
<br />
Hebe fetched John&#39;s former shoes, socks, along with some chinos, a belt, and a shirt from another more fit customer, and so on. If her setting the Fates&#39; loom right was to be fully fixed, she would have to be careful in what she selected. She handed off the new clothes and added one last enchantment to them as Jude went behind a screen to change into his new clothes, the magic taking root as they caused the high school senior to age a few years until he was a recent college graduate and newly married young man on his honeymoon with his beautiful young wife Sharon, who had just told him that they were expecting twins.<br />
<br />
The loom of the Fates had now been full resolved and Hebe peaked through her parlor&#39;s door to watch as the now slightly older Jude helped his wife up and they headed to their rooms for what promised to be a lovely honeymoon. Hebe smiled, she was always glad when her powers could be used to help make happy endings.<br />
<br />
And now for her own.</p>
