<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Hello Everyone, and welcome to a new episode of Animalia Ambassadoria.&quot; said Abby, kicking off the latest episode.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re about to look at one of the most unexpected events in Animalia,&quot; said Sarah, who had just got back from Northland in Northern Australia, &quot;the &#39;Seven on Four Night&#39;, as it&#39;s been called.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But from what we do know, because some of us were out of town that day,&quot; said Jessica, doing her best not to show how red she was, &quot;is that apparently one of the four men was just turning 21 and his three friends decided to get Kentucky Straight Bourbon and Jack Daniel&#39;s Whiskey for his first drink. But what happened was that seven women who worked at a brothel in Las Vegas that went under managed to get some Animalia Virus doses and decided to &#39;invite themselves&#39; to the party.&quot; At that Jessica was unable to continue due to her adolescent hormones, but fortunately Roger was able to pick it up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Later, in a scene that wouldn&#39;t look out of place in a fourth installment in <I>The Hangover</I> series, they woke up the next morning all as double-dosed Animalians with no way of knowing what happened.&quot; said Roger.<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
Afterward the field reporter members were meeting up with the &#39;adopted&#39; species that were looking after each of the female members, and some of them were doing interesting projects.<br />
<br />
Laura and Walter, who were &quot;assigned&quot; to look after Betti were not only helping her with her remedial lessons, but Laura was working on a book that explained what had happened after she was uplifted. It was no secret that Walter had accidently shot Laura after she was uplifted but before he was converted, but no one really knew the damage that had been done to Laura.<br />
<br />
&quot;It took me over an hour to get to a hospital to save my life.&quot; said Laura, &quot;but the damage was so great that I slipped into a coma due to blood loss before reaching the hospital.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So how is Betti doing?&quot; asked Jen-Jen, as a way of changing the subject.<br />
<br />
&quot;She&#39;s doing alright.&quot; answered Laura, &quot;While it&#39;s no secret that she&#39;s a high school dropout, she&#39;s going to be going to WSA to finish her long delayed high school degree. She might require medication as well as regular reminders to take them, but she&#39;s getting better with her mental faculties, and it&#39;s a good thing that bullying is actively discouraged at WSA.<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
Amy Jenkins was also able to meet up with Dao who happened to been at Claw Coliseum. What made the segment surprising was not only Dao&#39;s heritage, but also the fact that she was both taller and slimmer than most pig Animalians, but she also had a six-pack of H-cup breasts. Fortunately Amy wasn&#39;t jealous at all and more focused on interviewing her. But there was one humorous thing that was from the internet question block that made it funny.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know what exactly happened with this latest one,&quot; said Amy, &quot;But Riddlemaster696 apparently posted a &#39;bosom&#39;-themed tongue twister.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Bohemian.&quot; responded Dao.<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
Kelly again proved different because she was not only &quot;slim and stacked to the ceiling&quot; as one poster called her, but she also had a college degree, could speak seven different languages alongside English (German, French, Italian, Portuguese, Spanish, Mandarin Chinese, and Japanese) and was fluent in several different computer programming languages. With this discovery, Horizon decided to give her an IQ test, and was found to be off the charts. Not only that, she was one of the few natural autistic savants, which was why she was working with the Piper Clan. What was also surprising that she was at least twelve years older than most of the other participants, if not the oldest one at 43 years of age. One post said that she had &quot;brawn, brain, and boobs, all in one&quot;, but that was changed to &#39;beauty, brains, and brawn&#39;.<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
Lisa was found to be at one of her stand up comedy shows, but was wrapping it up with a philosophical joke sequence about wasps.<br />
<br />
&quot;... but what is the deal with wasps? It&#39;s not a bee, and it&#39;s not an ant. I mean come on...&quot;<br />
<br />
Afterward, the interview was able to proceed as normal. She was a little unnerved that the hyena pack she was staying with were herms, but she was getting used to it.<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
Abby made a bit of a surprising announcement when she announced that Sylvia was a farmhand on the Brown Farm. She was easily recognizable from her solid, dark red, coat as well as the brand on her left thigh. As a partial punishment from both Sarah and Delilah, and a &quot;traditional&quot; way of identifying her species, Sylvia was branded with a crowned shield outside the letter &quot;B&quot;, which was most often used with identifying feral Bavarian Warmbloods. Behavioral wise, however, she was more easily identified because she was simply a chronic flirt. The branding came about when she flirted with Samson and Red Cloud seemingly in the same day she started working. While they did use a numbing agent for the branding, it still hurt a lot more than she expected. Since then she only flirted once a week with single stallions, but she was doing a good job at attaining hormonal and emotional equilibrium. <br />
<br />
It did result in a funny internet meme of her sitting on a block of ice and giving a &quot;death-glare&quot; at the guy dressed as a cowboy who was holding the branding iron. The caption was inspired by an old joke about a ranch having an extra long name (I can&#39;t remember, it was a long time ago) and one guy asks another guy how many cattle they have and the ranch hand from said ranch replied &quot;Not many, only a few survive the branding.&quot;<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
The final interviews were with the four male participants in the Seven on Four night. While they weren&#39;t starting classes yet, they had been accepted as members of Pi Eta Tau, and their old fraternity allowed them to be transferred there.<br />
<br />
&quot;I got a movie poster of <I>Animal House</I> signed with all the members of our old fraternity as a going away present.&quot; said Caiden.<br />
<br />
&quot;I just think that our old fraternity president was jealous of us.&quot; said Dean.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of  what, our luck with ladies, or our size?&quot; joked Biff. At that, Vlad collapsed facedown on the desk and Dimitri crossed yet another name off of the list while saying &#39;Oh, brother.&#39;.<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
&quot;... and that&#39;s all the time we have for this episode, folks.&quot; said Sarah, &quot;With school coming up, we won&#39;t be doing episodes as often, but that doesn&#39;t mean that it isn&#39;t going to continue, so keep your eyes open. Until then, see you all next time in the wilds of Animalia</p>
