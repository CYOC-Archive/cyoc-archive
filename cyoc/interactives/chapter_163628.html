<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Diane and Tina scampered to a street corner a block from their home. The girls-turned-dogs sat beneath a tree, on the lawn of a vacant house.<br />
<br />
As they laid there, Diane’s mind was wracked with shame and panic. This couldn&#39;t be happening, they were animals! She had a dick! A canine dick, and she stuck it into her own kid sister without even thinking twice! <br />
She looked at Tina. It was hard seeing her little sis’s expression with her new face, but she seemed as worried as Diane was. She, too, was getting accustomed to her strange new body, and even more, she was taking in that she just had sex for the first time. And with her sister, no less. <br />
<br />
And now, both of them could be stuck as homeless dogs forever. Diane whimpered at the thought. How could they fix this? Should they go back to convince their mother? Maybe there was a way to let her know they were-<br />
<br />
“Having a bad day?”<br />
<br />
The dogs twisted their heads. A very large man in a cartoon shirt was standing behind them. Somehow, he snuck right up with neither dog noticing.  <br />
<br />
Diane growled. She <i>knew</i> him.<br />
<br />
“What? You still like laughing at other people’s bodies?” <br />
<br />
Furious, Diane barked, and charged towards the Fat Man, hoping to sink her teeth into the guy’s neck. As she leapt, she was suddenly pushed down onto the ground with a &#39;whump!&#39;. Her muzzle was clamped shut by an unseen force, and Diane could only growl angrily.  <br />
“Easy there,&quot; said the Fat Man, with an amused grin on his chubby cheeks. He lowered a hand onto Diane’s forehead. She tried to jerk back, but her quadrupled body was frozen.<br />
<br />
“Diane, isn’t it?,” the man said, rubbing the transformed girl&#39;s fur. “Not so fitting a name anymore, isn’t it? You like the new toy between your legs?”<br />
<br />
Diane whined, especially as she felt her sheathed member twitching. <br />
<br />
“Ah, and this must be your sister!”. The Fat Man came up to Tina, who sat on the pavement looking worried. She backed up, but found herself stopping in place as the strange man neared. “Tina, right? Apologies for all this. Your sister’s been quite rude to people, and I needed to teach her a few things.”<br />
<br />
The Fat Man stroked the underside of Tina’s muzzle. Tina was unsure how to feel over this, but she didn’t fight back. “But, seems you enjoyed yourself, didn’t you? Nine years old, and didn’t even hesitate to get naked for a dog’s cock.”<br />
<br />
Embarrassed, Tina averted her eyes. The man laughed. <br />
<br />
“Don’t worry, you’ll both be back to normal. With her though, a little longer,” he remarked, pointing at the other growling dog. “See, she thinks being fat is absolutely <i>hilarious</i>. You know what I think?”<br />
<br />
The Fat Man snapped a finger. Instantly, Diane’s body began to warp. Diane let out confused yelps as her body shank in height, with her legs shortening, and her golden fur reducing to a layer of white and brown. Her snout was pulled back inwards, but in exchange the sides of her mouth sagged with fat, and her belly bloated out. Her tail also withdrew till it was more like a large nub.<br />
<br />
Soon, Diane had shifted from a golden retriever to a large, fat bulldog. Diane whined in humiliation at her new pig-like self, a few tears even coming out of her eyes. <br />
<br />
“Heh. Perhaps it is a little funny,” the Fat Man quipped.  Like magic, a red collar suddenly appeared in the Fat Man’s hands. He fastened it around Diane’s neck, with Diane too defeated to resist. <br />
<br />
“You wanna come?”, said the Fat Man, looking at Tina. “Your sister could use some company right now.”<br />
<br />
Tina wasn’t sure she had a choice. But he was right; she did want to stick by with Diane until this was done. Plus, there was something about this whole situation that seemed pretty exciting, even if it was also scary. <br />
<br />
Tina gave a cautious &#39;ruff!. “Very well then!” the Fat Man replied. “Here, just to make you a matching pair.”<br />
<br />
With another finger snap, Tina changed. Diane watched in alarm as Tina shrank to match her size. Her body bloated out, and even the fur and face warping into the same ways. Soon, Tina was left as a pudgy bulldog like Diane, with only a different splotch on her face to separate her. The former young girl (and retriever) looked at herself in amazement.<br />
“Oh, that’s not the only thing…” <br />
<br />
Tina was confused by the Fat Man’s words, until she looked down. Below her flabby belly, Tina had grown a sheath and testicles of her very own. <br />
<br />
Tina’s stubby tail wagged in excitement, and she let out a thrilled bark. “Hey, someone’s happy he’s got a weenie!”, laughed the Fat Man, as Diane gave a dreaded look at her little sister’s new body. Tina seemed <i>way</i> too happy about all this.  <br />
<br />
 Another collar appeared in his hands (a blue one), and he put it around Tina’s fat neck. “There we go. We might need new names for you guys,” said the Fat Man. “How about…Tino and Dino!”<br />
<br />
Immediately, round metal tags appeared on their collars, with ‘Dino’ for Diane and ‘Tino’ for Tina. Tina panted her large flat tongue at Diane; her happy expression making Diane’s own mood even darker. <br />
<br />
<i>No way am I think of myself as a boy</i>, thought Diane. <i>Oh my god, why did you have to follow me Tina?!? You don’t have to do any of this!</i> She whimpered, wondering why the hell she and her friends had to make fun of that man.<br />
<br />
Her friends! Did the Fat Man get to them too? She couldn’t bear to imagine the things he might’ve done to them too.<br />
<br />
“Alright, let’s take a walk.” Leashes appeared with their collars, and suddenly Tina and Diane were free to move about. Tina immediately scampered up to Diane to lap at her ears, almost like a reassuring hug.  Diane felt immensely grateful.<br />
<br />
“That’s right, take care of your sis’ there,” said Fat Man. “Or brother? Heh, still figuring that out.”<br />
<br />
With the Fat Man’s beckoning, the transformed sisters walked forward, leaving their home further behind.</p>
