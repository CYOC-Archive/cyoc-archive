<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As soon as Molly and I got through the door, she fell to her knees in tears. I felt so bad... I couldn&#39;t do more but hug my Molly, and pray that this transformation wouldn&#39;t be painful... and that I&#39;d still have her after it. The floor became the bed, where we cuddled, talked, and dried her tears as best we could. Her head rested on my chest as she dozed off, tired from the crying. I followed soon after, wondering, fearing, what was in store for us.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good morning.&quot; I said with a smile as Molly came into the kitchen, dressed in one of my big t-shirts and her underwear. &quot;Good morning...&quot; she replied, sinking into her chair at the table. &quot;That smells amazing.&quot; She said, a small smile forming on her lips. I turned the frying pan around, putting some bacon on her plate. I served myself some and sat down. &quot;How did you sleep baby?&quot; I asked her. She looked up from pouring yogurt into her bowl. &quot;I slept alright. I&#39;ve been having pains all throughout the night.&quot; She said, grimacing. &quot;I&#39;m sorry... is it..?&quot; I didn&#39;t want to finish, not knowing if I&#39;d offend her by bringing it up. &quot;Yeah, it&#39;s my...&quot; she paused. &quot;It&#39;s my tail. It&#39;s longer I think.&quot; She stood up and walked over to me. Turning around, she hiked up her shirt.<br />
<br />
Her ass was surely stunning, and as I put my hand on it and giving it a squeeze, Molly giggled. &quot;You&#39;re not supposed to be looking there.&quot; She said playfully. &quot;Couldn&#39;t resist&quot; I said smiling. I then got to the matter at hand. Her tail. From what we saw yesterday night at the ER, It had indeed grown longer. What started as maybe an inch long tail was now a 10 centimeter long one. It wriggled down between her ass cheeks, and I noticed it seemed to have grown in thickness too. &quot;Is it longer..? I think I can feel it between my ass.&quot; She said in a mildly disgusting way. &quot;Yeah, it is. And a bit thicker too.&quot; I said as she turned around. &quot;We&#39;ll have to do what the doctor told us.&quot; I said. The doctor at the ER had requested that we document Molly&#39;s transformation, as well as mine should I be infected by her. After a month we&#39;d hand it back in so they could study the reports.<br />
<br />
We got dressed and headed out to the mall. Molly decided to wear sweats so she could tuck her tail under them, and not wanting her to be alone, I wore a pair of sweats too. As we drove in the car, she twisted and turned in her seat. &quot;I can&#39;t sit properly...&quot; she said, frustrated. Eventually, she sat more on the side of her thigh, having her butt turned to the side, making it less uncomfortable. As I shifted gears, Molly put her hand over mine. I took it and held her hand, stroking it with my thumb. &quot;I love you Molly. No matter what&quot; I told her.<br />
<br />
Opening the door to our house, we brought in our many shopping bags from our trip to the mall. We had bought a lot of things for Molly. New clothes that would fit her tail during the changes, swimsuits, and a sling, in case her tail got too big and a lot of books. Many about the different species of fish in the ocean, other&#39;s just for pleasure reading. After a nice dinner and a few glasses of wine, we decided to get an early night. As I walked into the bathroom to get ready with Molly, I caught her standing in front of the mirror, naked. She had her back to it, examining her tail. She hadn&#39;t noticed me yet, too preoccupied with her new limb. During the day it seems to have grown a little longer. But that wasn&#39;t what made my jaw drop. Molly seemed to be focusing hard on her tail. Slowly but surely, it began to move. First slightly to the left, then to the right. She let out a small gasp of excitement, as she then proceeded to curl it upwards a bit. &quot;You can move it?&quot; I said, walking in and wrapping my arms around her naked form. She yelped in surprise, burying her face into my chest. &quot;You saw that, huh..?&quot; She shyly replied. &quot;Yeah, I did honey. I&#39;ll document it for the doctor. That&#39;s actually kinda cool you know...&quot; we both laughed a bit as she looked up at me. Our lips met, and soon, Molly&#39;s legs were wrapped around my waist as I carried her into the bedroom for some fun. &quot;Fuck me, Aaron... I need a distraction from this...&quot; she whispered in my ear. We got on the bed, and I got her on all fours as I took off my remaining clothing. As I got behind her, I noticed that her tail now covered her pussy. I gently moved it, and as the tail grazed her lips, she moaned in excitement. &quot;Put it in... please...&quot;. &quot;No warmup..?&quot; I thought to myself, but when I felt her with my fingers, it was clear to me how wet, and ready, she was. I slid into her, and we both moaned together. In and out, I started slowly. Her moans grew louder and more melodic, and soon we went faster, and harder. She moaned loudly, looking back at me with her sexy gaze. &quot;Aaron... I&#39;m gonna- OH GOD!&quot; She shouted in pleasure. She braced herself, putting her hands against the bedroom wall. I felt her pussy clamp tightly around my cock, and as she came I kept pumping in and out of her. She moaned loudly as I kept going, and soon I pulled out. Molly turned around and kissed me deeply as we moaned together. &quot;Thank you...&quot; she said to me, hugging me tightly. &quot;My pleasure honey...&quot; I whispered back, kissing her cheek. I carried her back to the bathroom as we finished getting ready. We got in bed afterwards, and as I spooned my Molly, we both soon drifted off to sleep.</p>
