<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Oh goodie, sleeping beauty is finally awake...” Dan’s head rang faintly with the lingering tinge of the deep slumber he’d just started to flicker in and out of. His sister’s voice rang out around him, throbbing with self-importance as his eyelids started to jostle with flashes of his lashes in a sliver of bright white where his vision would come as he woke up. “-About time too.” She added snappily as he started to shift, starting to stretch but finding his wrists didn’t come rolling into action when he went to rub his eyes. <br />
<br />
Instead, his muscles tensed and he just flexed against bindings around his wrist that kept his arms locked behind his back around the stiff back of an old lawn chair. He tried to push against the confines as his eyes came fluttering open, but the knot held tight and he found his mother’s figure towering over him alongside his smug sister.<br />
<br />
What was going on? He couldn’t feel the soft comforting touch of his clothes but only the rough straining embrace of ropes scraping his skin, a breeze of cool air made him shiver as he wriggled around. A soft flicker from his eyes confirmed it, he was naked!<br />
<br />
“What the heck?” Dan instantly thought, glancing around to find himself seated in the center of their drab shed with dust and cobwebs clinging to the corners of the ceiling. <br />
<br />
His mother’s lips curled into a smirk, “It’s like he does nothing all day but nap, huh?” She looked over at Kat, who shook her head with a disappointed chuckle. Kat just gave a little sigh, wagging her chin side to side with judgement. <br />
<br />
“It would be funny if it wasn’t so true... and sad.” Kat said, shaking her head as though he had truly let her down. Dan just gave her a look, “What the hell is going on here? What kind of joke is this?” His eyes flickered to his mom, confused why she was humoring whatever power trip his sister was clearly on thinking she could use magic to tie him up out in the shed? He scoffed internally, “What is this?” <br />
<br />
“Dan, Dan, Dan...” Kat clicked her tongue at him, starting to pace in a slow circle around him with a click of her heels on the wooden floor with each step. Her shadow cast a dark splotch over his frame as she stood, looking down at him as though it was where she belonged all along. Right alongside her, his mother stood with the same imposing height, looking down onto his seated position. <br />
<br />
“She’s playing at being all imposing, but mom’s going to shut this shit down soon...” Dan thought, rolling his eyes. <br />
<br />
“You see, Dan. As much as you don’t ever seem to remember or care, today is my birthday, but not only is it my birthday, but it’s also my witch day and I have some powers now all of my own...” She stopped in front of him, pivoting to look him right in the eyes as a smug grin spread over her face. “...And I got my long time wish as a gift: you.” <br />
<br />
Dan stared back at her, raising one brow with bored disbelief and confusion masked in cockiness. His mind wasn’t accepting this idea yet, it hadn’t clicked. <br />
<br />
“That’s right, you arrogant slob. I’m finally going to even the scores and cast magic directly onto you... which means I can do whatever I want-” Her lips were spread wide, showing her teeth like a hunting cat. “Revenge in any way, any form for every little quib, snap, or joke you’ve ever made about feminism being stupid or my hair or my friends...” She looked at him, holding up three fingers, like she was counting. “Should I keep going or... is your simple mind accepting this yet? I own you, Dan. You were my birthday gift and I plan to enjoy it for all it’s worth-” <br />
<br />
“Mom!” Dan interjected, sick of waiting for his mother to cut in and stop this foolishness. His eyes flared, staring at Janice. “Come on? Can we get this over with and tell her to act like a human being not some crazy witch now?” <br />
<br />
Janice sighed, lips downcurling. Her eyes were dull and stern as she looked at him with a small shake of her head. “Dan, listen to her. Don’t interrupt.”<br />
<br />
“W-what?!” Dan blurted, confusion hitting him like a brick. “What does that mean? You’re just going to stand there as she ‘casts her magic’ on my?” He snickered, cruelly. “Come on!” <br />
<br />
“Dan... The females in our family have magic-” A pause cut in. “Only the females and that’s very valuable, but the men in our family, well, they aren’t worth squat. No magic, no power. Besides, your sisters only request for her special day was this, and we can’t exactly say no on this most important of days.” She gave a small shrug, sighing a tired breath. “Besides, you were wasting your life away, it was only a matter of time before you royally fucked it yourself with prison or an unwanted child or dropping out of school, who knows! But I know where you were headed.” <br />
<br />
Janice’s voice slowed, hesitating with a small, loaded glance at her daughter, his sister who instantly smirked down at him as she raised up his iPad, snickering. Janice shook her head, “That only made it all the worse...”<br />
<br />
“That? My iPad? I barely use the thing!” Dan thought, but his sister’s bright, mischievous eyes were hinting that she might have had a hand in ensuring that he didn’t have a single leg to stand on when she kicked him down! “What the hell did she do?” <br />
<br />
“I found your tablet history-” Kat hefted the device up, sneering. “It’s all filled up with mom, incest porn, fanfiction, and ... worse.” Her face contorted with disgust as a shudder raced down their mother’s spine, visibly shaking her. <br />
<br />
“I can’t believe it!” Janice blurted, voice twisted. “All these years a sick, twisted mind like yours, like you was just living under my roof! Festering here! And I took care of you-” She shook again, hesitating as the words caught in her throat. “I-it just disgusts me! It’s just... terrible. I can’t have you around as a son! I just can’t!” <br />
<br />
“I can’t believe I hugged you...” She started to pace side to side in front of him, clutching at her stomach like she was physically ill. “Did you start looking back on my kisses as a toddler when you jacked off into a sock? Did you think back to your baths with your sister!? Have you been peeping in the house? I-I... I am sick! Scared! I don’t even feel safe to have you around like this! Knowing you’re such a disgusting little pest! I mean... and that’s just the half of it, it only gets worse the more we look-” <br />
<br />
“I mean, Dan! Mother-Son porn? Incest porn? How could you think about me, your mother this way? No son ever should! Ever could! No! You simply... you can’t be my son if that’s how your brain works. I can’t have that... hanging over me.” <br />
<br />
“I knew you were a failure, it’s become clear these recent years that school, sports, or free and original thoughts weren’t going to be your thing but I thought maybe you’d grow into a semi-respectable plumber or truck driver or something... something at least hearty-” Her voice was thick, dripping with disappointment in him. “But you’re just a deviant! My son, my own... ex son is  deviant. A twisted, taboo goon thinking about molesting his family! Well, you’re not in this family anymore! You’re not a son or a brother any longer, Dan!” Her chest heaved slightly with emotion, a fierce hurt pang wavering in her voice. “You’re just Kat’s gift now, her plaything, though that probably makes you excited-” She shook her head, voice cutting off. “God...” <br />
<br />
Dan stared blankly, he didn’t know what to say. “I-I... that isn’t mine!” <br />
<br />
“We both know that is your iPad, Dan. Nice try...” His mother sighed, voice heavy. She turned away from him, not bearing to look down at her son’s face knowing what all that iPad held, damning him so. <br />
<br />
“No! No! I mean, I didn’t watch that! I mean, porn sure... but not that! Not that nasty shit! Never! I- It was Kat! Clearly! Look at her! She’s framing me-” He tried to gesture up to her face, but his hands were bound and she wasn’t looking anyways, only Kat was and she just grinned. <br />
<br />
“Dan, come on. Cut it out,” Kat shook her head, interrupting him. “You need to just take responsibility for your actions and accept the consequences.” She looked at him, a huge grin spreading across her face while a devilish glint showed in her eyes.  Dan felt a sudden chill race down his spine, right to the tips of his fingers still pressed together, tied in place. Her face was stern and serious while her eyes glittered like a child wielding the spyglass over small, blistering ants. Her whole body tingled with the faint excitement of knowing what came next, tormenting her brother for all his sins, and even imagined sins. “What difference does it make,” She thought smugly to herself. “He’s just a useless male, and I’m a witch. How could he ever compete?” <br />
<br />
Kat’s grin stretched another half inch, stretching over her teeth and showing them like the fangs of a predator. “And the repercussions... well, there’s just so much we can do... I almost don’t know where to start.”<br />
<br />
<br />
*Kat is framing her brother with &quot;his&quot; content, allowing her to suggest a related punishment. So if he makes fun of fat women why not make him a pig? Does he like voyeur footage of them working out, why not change him into a yoga mat. Making fun of poor people at the soup kitchen, how about he becomes a fat juicy rabbit. nom. *</p>
