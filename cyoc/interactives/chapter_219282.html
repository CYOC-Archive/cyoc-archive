<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Lucifer had a confused look upon himself as he returned from his meeting with Beelzebub. Portaling back into his office; he grabbed a nearby carafe filled with coffee and poured himself a cup before downing it in a single gulp.<br />
“That was a fresh pot I made,” Enoch observing his father; “still hot.”<br />
“I know,” Lucifer gasping; “I needed it to wash away that foul taste in my mouth.”<br />
“Beelzebub fed you heaping dose of shit,” Enoch chuckled; “just as I said he would.”<br />
<br />
Lucifer glared at his son. He hated that smug look on his face. Wanting to slap it off; he held back. Lucifer knew his son was right. Despite being his first born son; Enoch hated the politic and palace intrigue that came with being an archduke or any official in all the circles of hell. It’s why Enoch balked at his responsibilities as heir apparent. Opting to be a minor court judge; Enoch was known to be fair and merciful when judging the human sinners as to which circle best suited for the punishment of their crimes. At least until after that day; when Dis was besieged by King Richard and the Iron Knights.<br />
<br />
Seeing the destruction unfold; Enoch did what other demons were too shocked to do. He took charge and lead a counter offensive. Running at the invaders, Enoch was a terror on the streets. The invading knights, seeing a red skinned demon, whose lower half was that of a large black furred wolf; those said knights literally shit their britches. The demon-wolf taur tore through the knights before they could react. Taking out four in less time the remaining few had to unsheathe there short swords; Enoch dispatched the rest just as a makeshift constabulary was pressed to help the son of Lucifer.<br />
<br />
It was after the invading forces were forced to retreat that the citizens of Dis began to cheer for Enoch. When word got to Lucifer and the court of the ninth circle; pressure began to mount to have Lucifer make Enoch the official heir apparent. Enoch naturally refused. Saying, “I did what every other fellow demon is expected to do. Defend heart and home.” He then left to return to his judicial functions only to be shocked at seeing the same Iron Knight he killed to be standing before his court. In a fit of pique he sent all of them down to the lowest circle of hell to be pressed as slaves to help rebuild what they destroyed. Heartbroken at the unfair treatment he levied on the mortals; Enoch quickly left his duties. Opting to return to Earth and observe humanity from a different lens.<br />
<br />
Pouring another cup of coffee, Lucifer sat on a nearby chair while Enoch was spread out on the sofa.<br />
“You sure about what you found in the rolls from last night’s party”, Lucifer sipping this cup of coffee slowly.<br />
“Absolutely,” Enoch putting down the paper he was reading. “Your lord chamberlain is supposed to announce every attendant to last night’s party to welcome Rachael,” Enoch pausing; “sorry Lady Tenebra. This set of documents,” holding up a piece of paper; “details every one portaling or flying into the vestibule before heading into the party proper. Trebax and Mabeuth entered the party along with Lord Adrammelech, the Grand Chancellor.” <br />
Enoch pauses as Lucifer takes another sip of his coffee before continuing. “Yet according to these documents, which record those who left after having to drink your,” pausing as Enoch rolls his eyes, “blood wine; Anax and Mutea members of the palace staff end up leaving with you guessed it Lord Adrammelech.”<br />
“This is a very concerning,” Lucifer sighing; “I remember apologizing to those two as they were the last to drink the blood magic to reveal what ever glamour was being used to conceal Iron Knights hiding in that very ballroom.”<br />
“And you had every right to based off of the evidence, Baal and Uncle Michael gave you,” Enoch acknowledging that the Arc-angel Michael is his uncle, brother to Lucifer his father.<br />
“Which means Cruciata is innocence in all this,” Lucifer moaning in despair. What should I do?”<br />
<br />
“You’re asking for my council on this,” Enoch looking stunned.<br />
“You’re the one who had the wherewithal to ask for these record after I told you what happened last night,” Lucifer responding; “you may have stopped adjudicating punishments, but you still knew how to investigate and administer the appropriate judgements.”<br />
Before Enoch could answer, Lucifer began discussing what Beezlebub spoke to him.<br />
<br />
***********************************************************************<br />
<br />
“That is utter nonsense,” Enoch scoffing. “Cruciata may have started this by bringing the Iron Knights down her to kill Rachael over some petty jealousy; But to summon a being of chaos to kill Pava?”<br />
“I know,” Lucifer responded; “he tried to imply that it was possible, but quickly shifted blame by suspecting it was the work of Kushiel or even Jehovah himself.”<br />
“Of all the time you mentioned Jehovah,” Enoch getting up and padding to the carafe of coffee; “you always thought of him fondly.” Pouring himself a cup and adding some bloodbloom nectar, Enoch continues; “So I doubt this is the machinations of God.”<br />
“I agree,” Lucifer responding as Enoch sips his coffee. “Kushiel, is a more likely suspect. But I doubt he has the skill to summon chaos.”<br />
“Let alone doing it, while bypassing all the wards you and Jehovah placed,” Enoch putting down his coffee and grabbing a map and placing it on the coffee table by Lucifer.<br />
“All the wards you and god place in Heaven, Earth and here in hell,” Enoch pointing. “I visited the ones on Earth during my travels.”<br />
“And,” Lucifer looking at the map.<br />
“They showed signs of someone trying to tamper with them,” Enoch looking serious. “Its why I’ve been up on Earth for all these years.”<br />
“So,” Lucifer looking confused, “looking for a spouse was a lie?”<br />
“Not entirely,” Enoch answering. “I’ve been repairing the damage done to them. Trying to strengthen those wards; the one in mount Fuji was the last one when I felt it was best to head back here. And it’s a good thing,” Enoch picking up his now cooled down coffee; “You lock hell down shortly after. As I wasn&#39;t born with wings”, Enoch adding; &quot;getting back to the ninth circle without portal magic would be a tad dangerous for me.&quot; <br />
“Baal wants to examine the wards here in hell,” Lucifer shaking his head in disbelief.<br />
<br />
“He won’t know what to look for,” Enoch grabbing a tomb by his father’s desk and flipping through a few pages before handing it to Lucifer. “But this should help, unless you want me to tag along. I here Michael took Pava up to Purgatory.”<br />
“I allowed it as Penemue is unable to help and advised that healers or god is best suited to deal with the young demon’s injuries,” Lucifer staring at the sigil in the book. “Penemue is also with both of them.”<br />
“So Baal gets to suffer my company for a change,” Enoch finishing his coffee.<br />
“Why this symbol,” Lucifer continuing to stare at the aforementioned page.<br />
“Because it is unlikely that Kushiel or anyone in heaven would want Chaos to destroy earth,” Enoch heading to the door; “and it’s even less likely that he would be able to infiltrate hell to mess with the wards here like they were on earth. So who else do you know is eager for the conflict with heaven and hell to begin anew.” Enoch pausing to look at his father, &quot;Who was it again that encouraged you to start the revolt.&quot;<br />
<br />
The last words of Enoch rang in Lucifer’s head as he continued to stare at the sigil on the page. The sigil of the Carronfly family. An inverted red pentagram, inside a circle. With a mixture of Norse runes and ancient Babylonian script in the various positions outside of the circle.</p>
