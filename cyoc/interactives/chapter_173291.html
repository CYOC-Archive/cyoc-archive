<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Frank ran in terror, not really understanding what had just happened to him.  One moment, he&#39;d been a tall young man.  Now he was tiny and weak, his shirt now seemed more like a dress, leaving his legs bare.  His feet had slipped right out of his shoes, and his socks were barely clinging to his feet.  He&#39;d lost his boxer briefs as well.<br />
<br />
That girl, she&#39;d done this.  &#39;Fucking lesbian witches!&#39;, he thought.  Frank hated gay people, but lesbians most of all- girls should want to fuck guys, damn it!  Well, at least the pretty ones should.  It just wasn&#39;t natural!  As a handsome, strong guy, he didn&#39;t understand why any girl wouldn&#39;t want him.<br />
<br />
To say Frank had issues would be an understatement.  <br />
<br />
A few blocks later, he nearly collapsed near a small park, his tiny legs felt like jelly, and his lungs were on fire.  He sat down heavily on the grass.  He&#39;d lost his socks, and his feet looked dainty and...<br />
<br />
Like a girl&#39;s.  In growing realization and horror, he down the front of his shirt, seeing smooth, soft, hairless skin and two small, perfectly formed breasts.  &quot;No, no, no, no, no!&quot;<br />
<br />
He pulled up the hem of his shirt looking between his legs.  His cock and balls were gone, instead there was just a vertical slit, and some fine ash blonde hair.  He reached down to touch his crotch with his now tiny hand, and as his fingers contacted his skin...<br />
<br />
He moaned softly, his voice sounding like a kid&#39;s...a girl&#39;s.  It was true.  He was a girl now.  A tiny, delicate, weak girl.  Frank started to cry as he covered himself in shame.  He was a freak now!  His father would never accept him, he&#39;d be thrown out of the house.  And now that he was a girl...<br />
<br />
A wave of revulsion made him throw up as he thought about having sex with a guy, having a rock hard penis thrust into...there.  Rough hands gripping his soft breasts, bruising his soft skin...<br />
<br />
He shuddered.  No, he didn&#39;t want that!  The irony of his situation suddenly made him feel light headed, he giggled, then laughed hysterically.  &#39;I&#39;m even more of a freak!&#39;<br />
<br />
Finally, there were no more tears, and he felt strangely better.  If only there were a strong, beautiful girl to put her arms around him, stroke his hair, and tell him everything was alright.  Someone to take care of him- he&#39;d do anything for her...he blushed as he thought of her soft lips pressed against her own...of kissing her breasts and body, servicing her with her tongue..<br />
<br />
He shook himself out of his reverie.  Where were these thoughts...these desires...coming from?  Was this what he wanted, to give up his independence, to be a slave to some...girl?<br />
<br />
&#39;Yes!&#39;, his brain said.  Well there was nothing he could do about it.  He didn&#39;t have a girl in his life (he&#39;d broken up with that dumb bitch Sheila because she wouldn&#39;t put out...wait..no Sheila was a smart, nice girl that he&#39;d broken up with because of his insecurity and toxic masculinity...) and he had no idea how he&#39;d ever find one that would want...a tiny, weak, girl.<br />
<br />
So he made his way home.  By the time he got there, his feet were very sore.  Since he&#39;d left his pants behind, he didn&#39;t have his key, and he found his arms were too weak to push open his window.  Fortunately, someone had neglected to lock the sliding door in the back yard.  Then he encountered his first problem.<br />
<br />
Wolf, his German Shepherd.  He was big enough to bite her in half, and he wouldn&#39;t recognize her.  The dog bounded towards him and he squeaked and held up her arms feebly in an attempt to protect herself as the dog bowled her over and she landed hard on the floor.<br />
<br />
But then, rather than bite her, she realized the dog was licking her arms and face.  She giggled.  &quot;Wolf!  That tickles!&quot;<br />
<br />
The dog barked, happy his human was home.  He didn&#39;t understand why she didn&#39;t take him with her- she was small and he wanted to protect her.  She&#39;d acted afraid of him when she came in, and that made him sad.  He&#39;d never hurt his human!  He backed off, letting her get to her feet.<br />
<br />
Eyes filling with tears, Frank threw his tiny arms around the dog&#39;s neck.  &quot;Wolf, you know who I am?&quot;<br />
<br />
The dog didn&#39;t understand what was going on, but his human loved him, and he loved her.  So all was good.  <br />
<br />
Frank pet his dog, marveling at how huge he was compared to her.  At least her pet still loved her.  She headed to the kitchen, Wolf padding along behind her, and frowned as she realized how high off the ground the cabinet where Wolf&#39;s treats were kept was.  He had to drag a kitchen chair over, and use it to climb up on the counter to reach the cabinet.  He couldn&#39;t believe how light he felt!  He got the box of treats and gave Wolf two, which he gobbled up happily.<br />
<br />
Then she climbed down, and pet him some more.  Petting her dog made her feel good.  She went to her room, Wolf following her the whole way.  &#39;I&#39;m going to have to bring Wolf with me when I go places from now on.  He&#39;ll protect me.&#39;<br />
<br />
His room had changed.  Gone were the sports stuff and the posters of athletes.  The walls were now painted a soft pink color.  His bed was smaller, and there was a step at the foot of it.  A girly looking comforter was neatly draped over it.  He had a big mirror and there was a footstool near his closet, which was now full of...dresses.<br />
<br />
Lots and lots of girly dresses.  &#39;What the...&#39;  It was like some weird Twilight Zone where he&#39;d always been a girl.  &quot;Wolf, have I always been a girl?  Did I just maybe hit my head?&quot;<br />
<br />
Wolf gave her an odd look.  His human was acting strange.<br />
<br />
He sighed and went to his mirror, slipping off his shirt, now the only proof he had ever been a boy.  Looking at himself in the mirror, he saw that he had shoulder length hair, dyed a light pink.  He was super adorable and very pretty- maybe the prettiest girl he&#39;d ever seen.  He found himself smiling at his reflection.  He cupped his tiny breasts, liking how they felt.<br />
<br />
A warm feeling of arousal overcame him.  &quot;God, I&#39;d fuck me.&quot;  He said.<br />
<br />
The urge to explore her body rose, but she&#39;d do that later.  Her feet hurt, and she was tired, so she climbed into bed and crawled under the covers.  Wolf jumped up onto the foot of her bed and lay there, protecting her.<br />
<br />
She fell into a deep sleep...</p>
