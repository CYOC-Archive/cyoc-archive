<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;And mom or Roxie will help with the registration, so it&#39;s all good,&quot; Luna said with a smile as she calmly walked over behind her to place the bowl of cereal you&#39;d eaten in the sink.<br />
<br />
Luna put her bowl in the sink and then turned the warm water on to rinse it and then did the same with your bowl after you handed it to her. In the meantime, you sort of let your mind wander and think over the various other things that were now new to you. You&#39;d never slept anywhere but your own bed at your father&#39;s place before, and now you&#39;d not only spent the night with someone, but some that had secretly loved you back. That was big even without the male to female transformation that you&#39;d gone through the previous evening. You also noticed that even in human form you could still pick up some things, things that you didn&#39;t think a human would pick up. The house settling, footsteps, or movement in the pipes. You seemed to be able to hear those things. Shoot, you could even smell the scent of Golden Grahams cereal, and that was how you&#39;d known which kitchen cabinet to open to get to the cereal. Though for the moment, you couldn&#39;t really hear anything, so it didn&#39;t sound like Luna&#39;s parents were up yet. That puzzled you a bit as you&#39;d thought that at least one of them would have work to get ready for.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nicki...?&quot; came Luna&#39;s voice from behind you and as you felt her hand brush your arm.<br />
<br />
You looked back to her and managed a small smile, &quot;Sorry... I was just... well... listening to all the new senses and all that. I... I don&#39;t think your parents are up yet.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It shouldn&#39;t be too long before they get up,&quot; Luna answered, &quot;and yeah... you&#39;re going to be finding a lot of things are different. And not just because you&#39;re physically female. Your senses will be better.&quot;<br />
<br />
Luna paused and then ran a hand over your stomach. It felt nice, but in doing so it alerted you to some changes that you didn&#39;t notice. For as she moved her hands you actually flinched a bet which resulted in you flexing a bit, which you didn&#39;t expect. Even as a man, you&#39;d been on the slim side and never really put on the features that women often found attractive in men. Some of that was because of being transgender, but it went in other ways. And now, as a woman, you felt Luna run hands over muscle that you didn&#39;t have before becoming a MILF-wolf.<br />
<br />
&quot;And even in human form, you&#39;ll be fitter and stronger than ever before,&quot; Luna said to you with a smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t even know what I look like now,&quot; you said slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;You look beautiful,&quot; Luna assured you, &quot;come with me... I&#39;ll show you.&quot;<br />
<br />
You followed after her quietly and with a small bit of a smile. Some of it was being able to see Luna naked. You may have aged up physically from eighteen to thirty, but that didn&#39;t mean  a lot of those teenage hormones and desires weren&#39;t there. You&#39;d been close to Luna for years, and you knew that a fair number of boys in high school had wanted to date her. Occasionally, Luna had gone on a date or two, but they always seemed to be quick and Luna showed up at your house to talk about what a jerk the boy had been. It fueled the part of you that loved Luna through high school, but you were afraid that a girl as beautiful and capable as Luna wouldn&#39;t see you as anything more than a friend. Now, after learning that she&#39;d felt the same way about you and had been worried because of her status as a born MILF-wolf, a lot of those inner desires were coming out and you had a hard time hiding them.<br />
<br />
Luna was perfectly built in her human form. Her hair was a bit longer than yours, but you didn&#39;t mind. Her hips were far wider than they&#39;d been before her transformation the previous evening and her breasts were definitely bigger. In many ways she was now a blonde version of her mother, right down to the size of her feet and the full consequences of that seemed to make you happy in the sense that Luna had always looked good and now looked better. It was something in which she&#39;d gained the features that you&#39;d always figured would attract a MILF-wolf to Kellie, not realizing that Kellie had long been a MILF-wolf and Luna was born one. A lot of that served to get you a bit excited.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can smell you getting aroused back there,&quot; Luna said softly over her shoulder as the two of you reached the stairs, &quot;and while it&#39;s good that the fire in our relationship still burns hot... we have a lot to get through today, so let&#39;s save THAT for later.&quot;<br />
<br />
You couldn&#39;t help but blush as you followed Luna up the stairs. When you reached the top, you then looked down the hallway toward the doorway to Luna&#39;s room. Luna, however, didn&#39;t go to that door but the one in front of it, one that was for a modest bathroom that you and Luna had used in the past when working on homework in what was set up as a &quot;home office&quot; across the hall from Luna&#39;s room. You carefully made your way into the bathroom and Luna turned on the light as you entered. The décor wasn&#39;t much, with a white wooden stand that held towels, soaps, and toothbrushes. You glanced at it and figured your toothbrush and other things would need to go there soon. The counter for the sink was a white plastic over a wooden cabinet with the faucet being a simple steel faucet. You didn&#39;t focus on that but more to the large rectangular mirror that hung from the wall and that got you to blink for a moment.<br />
<br />
The mirror allowed you to see you and Luna standing there, naked in the bathroom. That part wasn&#39;t too bad and to a degree, you&#39;d been used to seeing Luna naked in her wolven form during the previous night and a part of you also really liked seeing Luna naked in her human form too, but right now Luna wasn&#39;t the focus of your attention. It was the brown haired woman that stood in front of Luna, the woman you knew to be you. You could see where your features had smoothed out as part of the change from male to female and you could tell where and how they were yours. It created the look of a rather familiar face that you quickly recognized.<br />
<br />
&quot;I... I look like my mom,&quot; you said slowly, thinking back on the memories of your birth mother. <br />
<br />
You&#39;d always been told you took after her. Sometimes you didn&#39;t know if that was your dad voicing frustrations about you not being more interested in many of the things he liked or expected or it was an honest recognition on which of your own parents you took after. You had your father&#39;s very dark eyes, but much of the rest of your face was now very similar to your biological mother&#39;s. Something in that made you fairly happy, though you couldn&#39;t explain why. Your father could be difficult at times and that helped fuel some of your fears that he might not accept you for who you were, though thankfully that issue turned out well, but that didn&#39;t mean you didn&#39;t like the features you&#39;d inherited from him. It was, in a way, how you loved both of your parents.<br />
<br />
&quot;And you&#39;re beautiful,&quot; Luna said to you.<br />
<br />
&quot;Though I think my hips and breasts are bigger,&quot; you commented as you looked down to see the two generous orbs that were there on your chest. You had to be at least a D cup if not a E cup, but you would only be sure of that once Kellie and Roxie got up to measure you and Luna.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not that there&#39;s anything bad with...&quot; Luna began as you raised a hand toward one nipple, just as if to confirm that it was yours.<br />
<br />
The touch was soft and your body did respond, getting you to moan a little, but the biggest point of surprise was that as gently squeezed and tugged on your right nipple, a few beads of milk began to spray out and you jumped a bit in surprise.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the--!&quot; you gasped in surprise.<br />
<br />
&quot;You became a MILF-wolf, Nicki,&quot; Luna said to you, &quot;and like all MILF-wolves... you&#39;re now lactating on a permanent basis.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Permanent?&quot; you asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; you nodded, &quot;because the sick werewolf bit my mother on the breast while she was pregnant with me... that&#39;s where they think the scientists think that the resulting new MILF-wolf strain heightened that sort of thing. She was lactating then because she was pregnant, and thus it carried over into MILF-wolves. And why drinking a MILF-wolf&#39;s milk is one of the ways to become a MILF-wolf. It energizes the hormones that relate to lactation. It&#39;ll mean that we&#39;ll have to, from time to time, make sure that we&#39;re not too full of milk. That happened to dad... she says it&#39;s rather uncomfortable.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I didn&#39;t know...&quot; you said slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s understandable,&quot; Luna answered as she collected a few pieces of toilet paper from the roll and then used them to blot up the spots of milk that you&#39;d sprayed onto the counter, &quot;you only got what they taught in high school... and that was more a safety lesson on how to avoid accidentally becoming a MILF-wolf. Mom and dad... and even a few other members of the pack of MILF-wolves here in town... shared with me a lot more on what the doctors found out with my mom when she became the first MILF-wolf and the other &quot;surprises&quot; followed from there. Largely so I&#39;d be aware of what I would become. And now... it&#39;ll be my turn to help you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll probably need it,&quot; you admitted.<br />
<br />
Luna rubbed one shoulder and kissed your cheek, &quot;you&#39;ll be fine. There&#39;s lots of stuff to get used to and it&#39;ll all be new. But you can do it. We&#39;ll start with a few things that didn&#39;t apply to you before now... but then before now, you were male. Now as a woman there will be some things for health issues that you&#39;ll need to pay attention to.&quot;<br />
<br />
Luna then ran down a list of things that would be needed for dealing with all the sorts of reproductive health issues that related to being female. This included specifics on how to keep clean, how to deal with all other issues that would be female specific. It was brief and quick, but you learned a lot. The biggest thing was that born werewolves, which would include MILF-wolves like Luna, and new MILF-wolves that used to be male, like you, tended to be in season with their first transformation, suspected to be caused by a hormonal rush that related to the transformation. Women that became MILF-wolves tended to have their &quot;heat cycle&quot; tied to existing &quot;cycle.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There&#39;s a lot in there,&quot; you said slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah... and I&#39;ll be with you every step of the way to help you with everything you need,&quot; Luna answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Except for clothes at the moment,&quot; you commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;Actually many of the outer shirts will still fit... particularly yours, as men&#39;s shirts tend to be made larger than women&#39;s shirts,&quot; Luna answered, &quot;and some of my stretchy pants may still fit for yoga, jogging, or something else. What we need is more the underwear, jeans, and potential &quot;business&quot; wear that would apply for things other than just being around the house.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;When your mom and Roxie can measure us,&quot; you nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;We can do more than that,&quot; came a voice from the doorway in the hallway making you both look up to see both Kellie and Roxie now there and as naked as you and Luna were. Kellie then continued, &quot;Roxie and I can also loan you both some things so that with the shopping trip, you&#39;re clothed enough to choose what you want to wear, what you think you look good in, and would feel comfortable in.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks,&quot; you said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d be no problem,&quot; Roxie answered, &quot;besides, we know that Luna&#39;s taste in clothes is often a bit different from ours and I&#39;m sure you&#39;re a bit different from her and from us. So it&#39;d be best for you both to choose what you want. Otherwise you have no reason to complain if we get something you don&#39;t like.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There are then a pair of ways we can do this...&quot; Kellie then picked up, &quot;we go and measure you both now, then help you pick out what will work best with you for the day, and then you shower while we have breakfast. Or you shower first and we&#39;ll worry about measurements after we&#39;ve had breakfast.&quot;<br />
<br />
You looked to Luna to let her make the decision. Kellie and Roxie&#39;s suggestion changed the possibilities regarding her plan, so you figured it was best to let Luna answer.</p>
