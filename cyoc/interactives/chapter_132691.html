<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Despite not seeing the transformation John could distinctly remember working with a huge strongman. Memories of the students staring up in awe giant as he had to duck under the door frames to fit inside classrooms filled his mind. Everyone was impressed with just how big of a guy he was. Just standing in the hallway he was able to keep a presence like no one else. However John had his own class to worry about. <br />
<br />
He stepped into his classroom and saw David, his student teacher, rummaging through some of the papers. David was a fairly organized and attentive, just a little awkward at times. John didn&#39;t mind the awkwardness too much. There was the strange silence between the two every once in a while but being a teacher John had learned to make it less awkward. <br />
<br />
David noticed him come in and rushed up to him. &quot;Here&#39;s the papers for today. I had them copied for you before school started this morning.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you,&quot; John smiled back. The small student barely came up to his shoulders. &quot;But you know it&#39;s your day to teach the class right?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes sir...&quot; David said. He was obviously hoping that John would have forgotten that was one of the main purposes for being a student teacher. But he hadn&#39;t. &quot;I&#39;ve been practicing but I&#39;m still pretty nervous....&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ll do fine,&quot; John complemented. His calm voice seemed to give David at least a little more confidence as he said it. <br />
<br />
&quot;Alright,&quot; David got up and looked over his notes. Despite not wanting to do it he still made sure he was prepared. The small index cards had his notes and he was still prepared. The bell rang and he took his place up behind the podium. With a deep breath he started talking.<br />
<br />
John sat in the back of his class on the teacher&#39;s chair. He wasn&#39;t really listening. He was too busy thinking about how he&#39;d just had sex with the principal and how his dick was bigger than even big porn stars. Somehow this little device he&#39;d gotten by chance had just changed all of reality and he could make it so no one noticed. John turned his attention back to the small guy doing his best in front of the class. <br />
<br />
Despite his anxieties David was doing a pretty good job. John had intended on giving him an &#39;A&#39; regardless. David had made his semester so much easier and John wasn&#39;t about to put a damper on his GPA. However he still thought he could do a little more. Looking down at the rubric he&#39;d made he got an idea. &#39;David will gain the same amount of percentage of weight as he receives on grade. And 15% of his final grade will be added to his height.&#39;<br />
<br />
John smiled comfortably as he stared at the 5&#39;6&quot; 120 pound student bracing himself against the podium in front of him. He hit the enter button and looked back down at his rubric. Scanning through he wanted to  <br />
<br />
Preparedness. It was the first thing that caught his eye. &#39;That&#39;s an easy one,&#39; he circled the 10 giving him full credit for being prepared. Looking up he could see it already having an effect. About 12 more pounds had added onto David&#39;s body. It was like he&#39;d been working out for a few months now. His shirt, still loose, fit around his shoulders and chest better. He was standing straighter behind the podium, stretching out his full 5&#39;7&quot; frame.<br />
<br />
A smirk crossed John&#39;s face as he indirectly listened to David talking. He was too busy looking over the other parts of the rubric. <br />
    Presentation: 50 points <br />
    Organization: 20 points <br />
    Q and A session: 20 points<br />
He looked through the Presentation part. &#39;Let&#39;s see... Let&#39;s see... Use of visuals...&#39; John looked up at the slide show David had put together for his presentation. &#39;Full points.&#39; He circled the 10 and watched as David&#39;s shirt grew even tighter across his chest while his body grew another inch. David continued his presentation as though nothing was happening. The shirt that had been almost too big on him was now fitting him perfectly.<br />
<br />
&#39;Knowledge of subject?&#39; John read. He wasn&#39;t really paying attention to anything that David said but he circled the 15 giving him full credit. Then read the next line as well. &#39;Think critically about the subject...&#39; He circled the 15 for that as well. It was a health science class. John couldn&#39;t imagine how critically David could actually think about it. But he also couldn&#39;t deny that he was a bit curious what would happen. That was another 30% added to his grade and his body. <br />
<br />
David only took a light notice of the growth. It was just because his shirt was growing so tight against his shoulders. They had grown at least a few more inches out giving him an even broader chest. His sleeves had even pushed up around his shoulders showing off his developed bicep even more. Almost on instinct he flexed them, showing them off to the class. There was a light ripping sound of the fabric starting to tear but no one seemed to notice. At 6&#39; and 180 pounds he was quite a looker for an 18 year old. No longer was he holding onto the podium for dear life. He looked confident.<br />
<br />
John didn&#39;t even bother looking at the last part of the presentation on the rubric. He just circled the 10. That was the final straw for his shirt. As pound after pound of muscle added to his frame it tore the shirt more and more down his back. It was just too small for his growing body. But he barely took notice. Only letting it fall down his arms and pool around his feet. No one else directly noticed but the girl&#39;s and even some of the boys interest piqued. Their unenthused posture shifted forward. But they were probably just as focused on what David had been talking about before his shirt had ripped off his body. <br />
<br />
&#39;Might as well say he&#39;s fully organized,&#39; John smiles while circling the 20. He&#39;d always planned on giving David full credit for student teaching but hadn&#39;t expected to be able to give this to him as well. He looked up at the student and saw his muscles grow even fuller. He&#39;d gained another 2 inches in height and another 24 pounds. He&#39;d well pass 200 pounds giving him a dry bodybuilders look. However John was a bit surprised when he heard another rip come from David&#39;s position. Toes were sticking out of the front of the student&#39;s sneakers. But then his khaki shorts fell on of his exposed toes. <br />
<br />
&quot;Coach?&quot; David drew John&#39;s attention away from his changes. &quot;Uhhh... I think my presentation went a little too long. Do you think we have time for a Q&A or should we just skip that part?&quot; <br />
<br />
&#39;Did he just call me Coach?&#39; John shook his head realizing that he still needed to make a decision. Looking up at the clock realizing just what time it was. He&#39;d been so focused on what he was doing that he didn&#39;t even notice. David had just gone from a 5&#39;6&quot; 120 nobody to a 6&#39;2&quot; 216 muscle bound hunk. And the boy was standing in front of the entire class nearly naked without a care in the world. But the longer John took thinking about it the less time there&#39;d be for a Q&A.</p>
