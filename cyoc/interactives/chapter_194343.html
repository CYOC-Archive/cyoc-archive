<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Both!&quot; Jennifer said with confidence. She didn&#39;t believe in the curse. She thought if it was real she would definitely seen very strange things happening in the town. &quot;So now what?&quot; She asked Kyle.<br />
<br />
Kyle answered &quot;Ok, that works perfectly for me. Jennifer Smith for your transformation you will become my personal sex doll and you will be teleported to the boys looker room. You will release pheromones&#39; that will compel the entire football team to fuck you. When they use you, you will squirt milk out of your tits that will turn them into gay sissies and they will believe they always have been like that. After you have been used by the football team your pheromones&#39; will then change to target Gabriel the Janitor. When he uses you, you will once again squirt out milk, but instead of turning him into a sissy like the others, your milk will turn him into my sexy, horny shapeshifting girlfriend, he will believe he always wanted to be my girlfriend and that God had granted him his wish. Once you have transform all of them, you and Gabriel will teleport into my room. You will grow a dick only when my soon to be girlfriend uses you.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;For your dare, I dare you to slowly fall in love with me and fall in love with my soon to be new girlfriend and lastly you will be only able to speak and use the curse while my soon to be girlfriend uses you, you also can only use the curse on my girlfriend and you will keep her female.&quot;    <br />
<br />
Jennifer felt disgusted at what she heard Kyle said. &quot;You freak. I knew you were one, but seriously you are something else. I&#39;m going to make sure the whole school, no the whole town knows about your kinks and fetishes.&quot; Before she could hang up, the phone fell from her hands as her fingers merged, turning plastic and looking like a mitt instead. <br />
<br />
Kyle heard Jennifer scream from his end. He hanged up with a smile on his face. He had made sure to call sick today so he could wait for Jennifer and Gabriel to teleport into his room. <br />
<br />
Jennifer scream cut short as her mouth changed; her lips becoming pink and plastic while her mouth opened, leaving her with a permanent O face. The change went down her throat, her tongue got glued to the bottom of her tongue and turned plastic. Jennifer fell down as her legs turned plastic and hollow, only air now supporting her shape. Jennifer could only move her eyes as her body became a plastic sex doll only filled with air. Jennifer felt her body shape change; her tits grew till they were E-cups she guessed, her hips expanded and her waist shrunk giving her an exaggerated hourglass figure. From this she surmised she looked like a bimbo blow up doll.<br />
<br />
She felt her vision shift as she was teleported into the boys locker room. She felt herself lying on a bench in the room. The only thing she could see unfortunately was the ceiling, her vision being reduced by the fact she couldn&#39;t move her head, but she could still feel and hear like normal. It took the sounds of two bells before she heard the sounds of her boyfriend and his team come into the room. She knew it was their gym class now. <br />
<br />
She heard her boyfriend laugh as he and the rest of the football team guys got in, he was laughing at one of his friends joke. Jennifer wanted to scream out for help, for mercy, for anything really, but she was aware of what was going to happen now. Like clock work she saw her boyfriend move to her exposed crotch, her new form having no need of clothes. Her vision was then taken up by one of her boyfriends friends. He began to use her mouth. She felt as her pussy was used by her boyfriend and her mouth was used by his friend.<br />
<br />
Jennifer felt a pressure build up inside her tits and saw as one of her boyfriend&#39;s hands reached out to give her tits a squeeze. The moment he applied pressure to her tits, she saw a squirt of milk shoot out. She then felt the pressure increase and her breasts began to squirt milk like a fountain. If she could cry she would, but she was now just a sex doll and nothing more. Jennifer lost track of time as she was used by the entire football team; all the guys who bullied Kyle Perkins. She could only watch as they turned into gay sissies and stopped fucking her and began to fuck each other.<br />
<br />
She saw her once tall and muscular boyfriend get reduced to a 5&#39;4&quot;, small dicked, no muscled, gay sissy. She saw and felt as he had left her pussy and began to get fucked by the guy once using her mouth. After the sound of the bell they stopped got clothed and left her. <br />
<br />
Jennifer knew with this mess of cum the Janitor Gabriel would come. Jennifer had employed the Janitor in her schemes of pranking and bullying Kyle. Jennifer waited what felt like an eternity to her but was only 3 minutes, before Gabriel entered. <br />
<br />
Once again like clock work Jennifer heard Gabriel drop what he was going to do and undress. She then saw him go toward her groin, she waited for Gabriel to use her. She felt Gabriel&#39;s cock enter her and once again felt the pressure build in her tits. She was slightly surprised to then see Gabriel&#39;s form loom over her and use his mouth to play with her plastic tits instead. She felt as the milk released into Gabriel&#39;s mouth as he started to suck on her plastic tits. <br />
<br />
She watched as Gabriel changed.<br />
