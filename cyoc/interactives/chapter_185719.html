<br />
At 6 foot even, Jeff Chess was the proverbial &quot;Big Man On Campus&quot; and he knew it.<br />
On the school&#39;s Varsity Football (star quarterback, naturally) AND Baseball (ace pitcher and slugger) teams, his future was secured. A full Sports Scholarship ride to the University of his choice and a profitable professional career afterward awaited him.<br />
But one thing those in power would not acknowledge or turned a blind eye to was that Jeff was also the school bully. While polite to adults, especially those who could be beneficial to his future, even his &quot;peers&quot; were beneath him and Jeff made sure they knew it every chance he could safely do so.<br />
Having just finished pitching practice on the mound striking out every batter he faced, although a couple he had to discretely &quot;brush back&quot; to protect his stats, Jeff sat on the wooden bench staring out at the empty field. Finishing his bottled water, he basked in both the sun and his ego, when he heard a sultry voice behind him say, &quot;Hey Stud.&quot;<br />
Other than being female, Jeff had no idea who it could be. There were several women he was considering looking up tonight, but he intentionally lollygagged on the field for awhile to let most of the other guys get through the showers and dressed before he went inside to clean up. Jeff suspected a couple of the guys played for the &quot;same team&quot; on and off the field. Nothing that he could prove or do anything about (legally), but the more he stayed away from them the better.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey yourself,&quot; Jeff said as he started to turn around, but was suddenly stopped with a terse &quot;DON&#39;T!&quot; as a pair of hands started seductively massaging his shoulders.<br />
&quot;You looked great out there,&quot; the sultry voice said, &quot;and I can make you feel even better,&quot; it added, as one hand started going up and down Jeff&#39;s spine while the other came around the front to grasp the growing bulge in his pants.<br />
Jeff naturally moved to cup the hand in front within both of his, but was surprised to feel... FUR?<br />
He started to rise but was pushed back onto the bench by the hand that had been caressing his back. &quot;Now what are you trying to run away for? Don&#39;t you want some pussy?&quot;<br />
With that whoever was behind him came around to sit on his lap, the sight shocking Jeff Chess.<br />
Before him was an actual cat woman!<br />
Not some figment of his imagination.<br />
Not even his wettest dreams ever conjured something like her up.<br />
Being slightly taller than him, her bountiful white furred breasts were at face level. Their hard nipples pointing straight at him.<br />
The rest of her body possessed the orange with black striping of a tigress as her hands started taking his uniform shirt off.<br />
&quot;Clothing just gets in the way,&quot; she purred, running her paws across his muscular chest. <i>Besides, soon you won&#39;t need them any more,</i> she silently added.<br />
&quot;Oh. I can feel you want me,&quot; the furry lady said, rubbing her bottom across his lap, making his hardening cock strain for release from his pants.<br />
&quot;Here babe,&quot; she said, cupping her bosom to bring the nipples closer to his mouth. &quot;Suck on these and tell me you don&#39;t want some hot pussy.&quot;<br />
&quot;I—&quot; he started to say, only to have a hard nipple placed between his lips.<br />
Even though he had absolutely no idea who or what this... person before him was, Jeff Chess soon lost all interest in everything except sex. One hand started caressing the breast he had been sucking as his mouth engulfed the other while his free hand started rubbing its way across her white furred tummy, past the navel and down to the moist wetness between her legs.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s it,&quot; Sara the Demi-Goddess of Furrys purred. &quot;Now stand up so I can get you out the rest of that silly uniform and your hard cock inside me where it belongs.&quot;<br />
Jeff eagerly rose and helped the furry female before him strip the rest of his clothing off, not realizing that he was one step closer to losing his humanity forever.<br />
&quot;Good boy,&quot; Sara purred. &quot;Now lay across that bench and let me ride your hard dick to the ending we both want.&quot;<br />
Jeff felt his back pressing against the wooden plank, his legs on either side as his arms reached up and helped her mount him.<br />
&quot;Better than I thought it would be,&quot; Sara purred, feeling the hard cock plunge deep into her vagina as her victim caressed her furry body before reaching up to play with her breasts.<br />
&quot;That&#39;s it big boy. Give me everything,&quot; she demanded. <i>While you still can,</i> went unspoken.<br />
Sara rode Jeff Chess to two great orgasms before he came.<br />
Or at least she though he came, for while the penis pulsed within her, hardly anything came out in the end.<br />
In disbelief, Sara looked down at him and asked, &quot;Are you on steroids?&quot;<br />
&quot;What?&quot; Jeff asked in disbelief. &quot;How dare you—&quot;<br />
But the statement went unfinished as Sara slapped him as hard as she could.<br />
<br />
Dismounting, Sara let her fluids leak out of her vagina and drip onto his leg as she looked up and asked, &quot;How long?&quot;<br />
&quot;Any moment now,&quot; Astra replied, although only she could hear the answer.<br />
With that Sara turned to face Jeff again, even as his skin started turning a different shade of pink.<br />
Jeff started to moan, then had the odd feeling something was wrong, but at first wasn&#39;t sure what. Then he looked at his hands and saw that they weren&#39;t quite as big as before. Neither were his arms!<br />
He sat up, but the view was quite different. The furry lady was still there, but she looked taller now.<br />
NO! &quot;I&#39;m shrinking!&quot; Jeff yelled.<br />
&quot;Yep. Wish you could see yourself from my perspective right now. You&#39;re becoming the animal everyone else knows you are,&quot; Sara said proudly.<br />
&quot;What?&quot; Jeff asked, even as he felt it happening before he looked and saw that he was seriously gaining weight.<br />
&quot;What did you do to me?&quot; he demanded to know, trying to stand up but finding it difficult at first on his new hooves.<br />
&quot;Nothing you didn&#39;t bring upon yourself, you swine!&quot; Sara said with a smile, watching his face adjust to accommodate his nose, which was rapidly changing into a snout.<br />
Jeff suddenly saw something fall from the sky, then realized it was his hair! The 18 year old Senior was now totally bald as his ears became triangular in shape while switching to their new porcine positions.<br />
&quot;You thought you were God&#39;s gift to women, even though the equipment obviously didn&#39;t work properly,&quot; Sara began, while reaching between his new stubby legs to tease the cock that was now no longer than a young kid&#39;s finger. &quot;Your tail does look kind of cute though,&quot; she added, as her other paw started playing with the curly appendage that was now sticking out of his fat rump.<br />
&quot;But college. My career,&quot; Jeff Chess began to wail.<br />
&quot;As the adage goes, you should have been nicer to the people you met on your way up, because they&#39;re the same people you&#39;re gonna meet on your way down,&quot; advised Sara, before she turned to leave.<br />
&quot;Wait you bitch!&quot; Jeff said, grabbing her by her long feline tail.<br />
Sara gave out a short squeak of pain before turning around. She had to adjust her aim a bit because he was now a little under 5 feet tall but still hit Jeff with a fist directly in the snout.<br />
As blood started leaking out his former nose, Jeff Chess fell to the ground and began crying and squealing that it wasn&#39;t fair. &quot;God wouldn&#39;t do anything like this to me, even if He thought I deserved it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sara just smiled and said, &quot;There&#39;s your first mistake. For the record, God is actually a GodDESS and she is pissed at what passes for humanity. Like I said, you brought this on yourself. In any event, try to have a good life. I know I will.&quot;<br />
With that Sara turned and sashayed away, her shapely furred hips moving in time with her long tail.</p>
