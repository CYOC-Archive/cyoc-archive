<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It came like a freight train that smashed into his physical person, Bryan threw himself to the side sliding through a small puddle of sweat that he and Matt had made. What had he done? Why had that happened? He could taste the sweaty balls that he had just been lathering with his mouth, the musk of male manliness in the air from their combined sucking. Looking over he saw Matt was still sitting on the floor, his eyes dazed and a raging erection standing proud at full mast. Bryan tried to think straight, it was hard all he found in his mind was the pleasure of feeling Matt naked on top of him, the strength he felt in his friend, the swelling of his dick in Matts mouth. NO! He pushed passed that what had happened….<br />
<br />
The dogs! His family and the transformation. How could he just forget all that and get into a passionate make out session that turned into a blow job fest. Bryan racked his mind trying to find a clue, then it came to him. His parents had been having sex when he supposed they had transformed, his brother had been masturbating when he had been transformed, was sexual activity somehow related to the transformation. If so then, Bryan quickly looked over himself searching for any kind of deviation from what he had registered in his mind over the years of looking at himself naked. Thankfully he appeared to be just fine, aside from his balls aching and swelling with the need to release he seemed perfectly human.<br />
<br />
He turned to look at Matt, assuming him to be just as fine as he was since nothing had happened to him. Instead he saw Matt bending his head down and with flexibility he knew Matt didn’t possess, take his own dick into his mouth and starting sucking with a fury. <br />
<br />
“No Matt we have to stop; don’t you see it’s the sex that is going to change us?” Bryan tried to grab his friend and lift his head, but the sweaty muscled body was too wet for him to move, and instead he fell on top of Matt. The feeling of his muscled form against Bryans made him start to get hard again, he tried to stop but couldn’t resist the temptation, he reached and started rubbing his hands all over Matts body as he watched Matt suck himself off. For a moment he would have fallen into the trap once again, but the sound of whining instead of moaning coming from Matt freed him once again.<br />
<br />
Removing himself from Matt without touching him was hard, but fighting the urge to join him was even harder, and yet Bryan did it. He moved to the side of his bed and sat down taking a deep calming breath as he tried to collect himself, his own raging erection was not going down, he would give in however he would not give in.<br />
<br />
A sickening wet pop alerted him to Matts completion, looking over he saw Matt open mouthed looking at him, small amounts of cum leaking down his face. He was still dazed, but a deep lust filled his gaze. Matt racked his eyes over him, trailing up and down Bryans muscled body, before lingering on his still erect penis. Bryan didn’t know if the shudder that ran through him was one of disgust or arousal, but it was overwhelming and his body showed it. He tried to back up feeling something was about to happen, he backed up right into a dresser and his naked dick bounced for a few seconds before settling. Matt opened his mouth and let out a dog like whine, the sound was disconcerting towards Bryan and he tried to look for an escape.<br />
<br />
Matt started panting, a slow rasping sound that starting off almost as a hard breath. It grew and grew until Matt was full on panting, it was a sound that was out of place on his human mouth. Matt started letting his arms rove over his body, cupping his pecs and rubbing his abs, even trailing over his long dick and balls, before coming back to his chest. Bryan watched as Matts panting grew louder as he roamed his body, until suddenly he saw something strange. <br />
<br />
It was slow at first but gradually Matts nose started to darken, first it looked like a spot of mud on his nose that grew into a large black mass, until his entire nose was darkened. Matt started towards him and Bryan tried to move but was confined to his spot, Matt came forward and locked his lips with Bryan his wet nose cold on his warm flesh. It was a wave of pleasure and a strange tingling feeling as he allowed Matts tongue to push into his warm mouth, he let out a loud moan that rang out in Matts mouth before Matt broke off. <br />
<br />
He moved away from Bryan and he in turn watched as Matt bent down backwards facing his toned ass in Bryans direction, he watched as a fleshly strip started to push its way out of Matts rear. Part of him got harder as he watched, but another part grew worried. Matt started to whine again louder this time and with more intensity, that strip grew and grew until it was as long as Matts own forearm and then a light dusting of golden hair started covering it. The hair grew in thickness until long blonde fur covered it and suddenly Bryan realized that he was watching Matt grow a tail…. a fucking tail.<br />
<br />
Whatever pleasure he felt drained out of his system and fear overridden his common sense, he took the opportunity while Matt grew his tail to dash out of the room, and right into his transformed family. Alex, his dad, his younger brother, and his mom all in their new dog forms were right outside the room tails wagging and in the case of the males large red thickness dripping with pre-cum. He was still naked and was backed against the doorway he had just dashed through. Looking behind him he saw the now tailed Matt stand up, his noise was fully black and it almost looked like his face was inching forward, his blond shaggy hair gaining length. <br />
<br />
With a quick burst of adrenaline Bryan bolted through his family/pack and ran down the hall, his body still naked and now covered in a nervous sweat. He turned down the hallway and ran down the stairs, loud thumps echoing behind him, he made a dash into the kitchen and headed for the keys box, before he was tackled from the side and felt a large weight on him. Looking up he saw Matt, straddling him again. Matt leaned down and licked him across the face, his long tongue dragging all over. It was much wider than before and had gained much length, Bryan felt more tingling and he tried to push Matt away but once again was too weak. He turned to the side and using the sweaty body of Matt he pulled himself away, though feeling Matts large dick drag across his lower back. He jumped behind the table and looked at Matt.<br />
<br />
Matts face was starting to form a snout; it was pushing forward slowly from his face. His ears growing longer and started to flip over at the tips folding, the started to darken in shade to a bright golden blonde. Matt was panting even harder and he moved towards Bryan, he tried to look for an escape but all the sides were blocked by his family dogs. Matt jumped on top of the table, his tail wagging quickly behind him. He snout opened and his long doggie tongue came out and starting licking Bryans face. Bryan opened his mouth to shout but was invaded by the doggie tongue, he tried to move but felt Matts large hands grab his shoulders and hold him in place. He looked into Matts blue eyes and watched as they started to turn muted brown, starting at the center before moving outwards.<br />
<br />
“Please Matt stop, please ple - whine! -…” Bryans hands flew to his own mouth, he looked startled. Had that come out of him? He looked down at his own body and it still looked the same, but he felt strange. A warmth had come over him and was spreading, it started at his face but moved throughout his body. Matt moved his snout over Bryans lips and started licking again, slowly at first but gaining speed. He felt his own nose getting colder, like a breeze was focused on that part of his body and he knew that it was darkening like Matts had. He gave once last feebled attempt to move before givining up, Matt was too strong for him. He felt his own face start to push out and strange thoughts entered his mind. What was wrong with this? The alpha wanted him and he should obey, he was a dog. <br />
<br />
“NO -bark- I am not a -bark-!” He tried to yell out but his face finished forming into a snout like Matts and he could no longer speak, he tried but all that came out was barks and yips. <br />
<br />
Falling down on the ground he started to whine. Why had this happened what was he going to do? Matt moved downwards as well until he was resting in a crouch similar to a dog relaxed sit, his tail wagging behind him. Bryan felt a rush of fire run through him and he started to get a boner, embarrassed he tried to stop it but couldn’t and soon his dick was full with blood. Matt bent down and with his snout captured Bryans dick in his snout, his long dog tongue wrapping around it licking, slurping, the feeling was like fire on Bryans glands. He let out loud whine and starting thrusting forward into Matts snout, he felt a growing heat on his dick and it felt like it was being incased in a warm blanket. Matt finished before he came and lifted his snout off Bryans dick and Bryan looked down. Where was once he dick was a flesh packet, it pooled and lumped downwards. <br />
<br />
Matt let his tongue run over it making Bryan let out a dog like gasp, he watched in fascination as his dick slowly rise out of the sheath rounded top showing before the rest came with it. It was so different, so amazing, so canine, why was he fighting? It felt so good. Matt let go of him and Bryan leaned on his back exposing this new feature, he let the feeling wash over him. Turning to Matt he watched as fur started to creep up his backside, golden blond, his anus darkening and pushing out with his tail. The fur reached the up to the shoulders and then spread over. It connected with his hair and covered his snout.<br />
<br />
Bryan grew more aroused as Matt leaned over and let their snouts connect, his tongue growing longer to fit his new mouth and lapped at Matts own tongue. As he did so Brown fur started to creep up Bryans ass crack, starting at his anus which started to darken and spread. As it reached his tail bone a small tail started to push out, making Bryan whine in pleasure. Eventually the tail exploded in a poof with fur and then he had a fully grown tail wagging behind him. <br />
<br />
Unable to take it any longer he lunged forward and somehow pushed Matt on his back, the feeling of golden fur on his hands was intoxicating. He let his snout drag over Matts body, the fur creeping up as Bryans tongue dragged over the flesh parts of Matt. He soon was by the sweaty balls of Matt, he let his tongue really cover them and licked and lathered. The saliva pooled over and soon golden fur started to sprout all over them until he had a nice set of golden balls. He moved his tongue up to Matts dick and started to suck. He felt his tongue cover Matts long penis, he dragged his tongue up and down the length of the dick. As he did so he watched as Matts dick started to lengthen and redden until it ended up in a point, a knot forming at the base. He moved downwards and lapped at the knot, he felt as the skin started to creep up and covering Matts dick. It continued until he had a nice sheath and felt his now canine dick throb in his mouth, he lifted his snout before Matt could cum, payback for earlier.<br />
<br />
Bryan turned around and present his fur covered backside, he bent down on his knees and using his hands exposed his doggie anus. With nary a second Matt was leaning forward and pushed his red dog cock deep into Bryan, who whined at the feeling of being filled. Soon Matt started humping and as he did so the fur covered the rest of his body and his arms which were gripping Bryans sides started to gain pads, as did his feet. Bryan felt him push deeper and thrust harder into causing periodic whines of pleasure, the tingling warmth of fur spreading covered his chest and moved up his face. He looked down and watched as fur covered his balls and furless sheath, his dick emerged pink and human until it started to gain length and thickness and turn red, it moved up into a point until it was a complete canine cock.<br />
<br />
He turned his head and watched as Matt could no longer hold on to him and had his completed forepaws draped over his shoulders, Matts chest barreled out and his body lengthened, his feet finished transforming into paws and soon he was completely dog humping away at Bryan. Bryan felt the knot in his ass swell and lock them together, before hot spurts of doggie cum flooded his ass. He let out a loud howl at the same time as Matt as he too let out his own stream of doggie cum all over the kitchen floor. He felt the fur cover him completely and watched fascinated as his hands that were on the ground grew pads and started to change shape. His legs shifted around, unable to hold him in their form postion and the bones changed. His head squeezed and he watched his vision narrow until everything was in black and white.<br />
<br />
Looking behind him he saw his mate connected and was pleased. His pack was around him and he had successfully mated. Why had he ever been so scared?<br />
<br />
The End?</p>
