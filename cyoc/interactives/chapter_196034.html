<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Ron procrastinates as he reads tweets.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cindy&#39;s jaw dropped. That sounded exactly like something Ron would do. How was this app doing this? She was about to select Jim when she noticed that there was a little extra sentence in a speech bubble next to Ron&#39;s sentence. It read &quot;Change one word or refresh for a new sentence!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What does all of this mean?&quot; She thought to herself. Could a silly little app really do anything?<br />
<br />
She decided to try and find out once and for all. She selected the word &quot;procrastinates&quot; and thought of things that could have been better.<br />
&quot;Rich?&quot; No, that didn&#39;t make sense.<br />
&quot;Sing?&quot; Useless.<br />
<br />
Cindy scanned Ron&#39;s body from his dirty blonde hair to his somewhat generous stomach and woefully lamented their rather sedentary lifestyle. Sedentary...<br />
<br />
The lightbulb in Cindy&#39;s head went off as she changed &quot;procrastinates&quot; to exercise to see just what the app could do and felt her vision wobble as vertigo hit her for a few seconds. She felt herself get her bearings as she heard a bestial grunt in front of her. Cindy&#39;s eyes drifted in shock as she watched Ron heft a metal dumbbell, sitting across from her in a gym shirt and shorts, his dirty blonde hair had been cut down a tad while his once chubby face had been reduced to where his jawline could be seen. <br />
<br />
&quot;93... 94...95...&quot; Ron growled, music had been playing in his newly minted sport earphones, scrolling with his free hand as the bicep bulged.<br />
<br />
Cindy gasped as she saw Ron&#39;s form and he turned to her, before winking and pausing his scrolling.<br />
<br />
&quot;See something you like, baby?&quot; Ron said. Even his voice had changed, deepening slightly to where she could stand to hear it more often.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, of course...&quot; Cindy started, before noticing Ron&#39;s lustful gaze drifting down to her bosom. She blushed, before Ron put down his phone and switched the dumbbell into his other hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;...And the job..?&quot; Cindy questioned, wondering what was going on. It was almost like it was a new dream altogether as Ron looked back up and shook himself out of his stupor and smiled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, Xane&#39;s covering me at the gym today so I came earlier, wanted uh,&quot; Ron took a moment to lick his lips,<br />
&quot;...To have some quality time.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cindy couldn&#39;t help but giggle in a way she hadn&#39;t in a long time, this new Ron was someone she couldn&#39;t help but feel attracted to, he was well fit and she could peek the abs he was building underneath the gym shirt that was beginning to darken with sweat. In this new reality, she was slowly realizing, Ron had a job and was possibly a much better lover. She looked over to the television and saw the smaller tv she once had was replaced with a newer modeled flat screen and a PS4 that Jim possibly had due to the wealth influx.<br />
<br />
The living room had lost its messy appearance, the dust on the floor and coach cushions strewn over the area had become a modernized aesthetic, with touches that Cindy had once dreamed to have rather than wistfully decorating in her mind.<br />
<br />
She could still hear Jim playing his video games, but could clearly hear him speaking as if to new friends he hadn&#39;t had before and she sighed, this was the life... Before hitching her breath as Ron slipped a greedy hand into her chest and groped her pliable breast.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ron...! You big beast,&quot; Cindy sighed, clutching her shirt before unbuttoning her shirt. <br />
&quot;Mm, I love when you call me that,&quot; Ron spoke, licking his lips, before leaning in to whisper into Cindy&#39;s ear.<br />
&quot;I wanna hear you scream it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cindy whined as she got up to Ron&#39;s amusement.<br />
<br />
&quot;We can&#39;t, not here, I, what if Jim comes?&quot; She hastily buttoned her dress shirt. <br />
<br />
Ron chuckled, ripping off his weightlifting gloves and picking up a phone in his hands and putting it into his pocket.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then we&#39;ll do a... Private workplace meeting, yeah?&quot; He said, coming towards his wife and placing a kiss that Cindy melted, before taking her into his arms and lifting her easily into his arms.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ron!&quot; Cindy squealed, &quot;You&#39;re so strong!&quot;<br />
<br />
Her husband laughed, easily carrying her up the stairs.<br />
<br />
&quot;And I&#39;ll only get stronger from here baby, all those workouts are good for something right?&quot;<br />
<br />
Ron quickly took her into their room and sat her down onto the bed, he turned and walked and peeked his head outside to see if Jim had seen them... Before gleefully locking the door. He tore off his shirt as Cindy threw off hers and was about to crawl onto his wife when he stopped.<br />
<br />
&quot;Something wrong, Ron..?&quot; Cindy asked, out of breath.<br />
<br />
Ron felt an annoying vibration in his pocket and recognized a call, swiping his phone from his pocket in one swoop.<br />
<br />
&quot;One sec, I think work&#39;s calling, just gimme a minute and we&#39;ll be back to cardio.&quot; He said confidently, turning away and opening the door and stepping out of the room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hurry on back, stud!&quot; Cindy called out to him, to which Ron smirked as he answered the phone call.<br />
<br />
--------------<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Ron, I kept trying to call you, just wanted to let you know that I got you for now, but, you think you can cover me tomorrow? I actually got a birthday to visit, you know, for James?&quot; Ron recognized Xane&#39;s rather nervous chuckle. He rolled his eyes as he remembered Xane having came out while at work and come onto him while in the locker room. Xane was always a bit of a risk taker, being smaller but more defined than him, but also willing to be a side piece if he really liked someone.<br />
<br />
Ron sighed, he wasn&#39;t sure if he was gay or straight, he liked a lil of both, and he liked Cindy and Jim... But sometimes he was hating that he may have gotten himself into somewhere he didn&#39;t want to end up.<br />
<br />
James was a mutual gym goer that often asked Ron to personally train him and help track his gains, he recalled being invited to the party at the club, but declined to take Jim to buy a new game for his PS4 to play together. If he took on this favor from Xane, though, he would at least being able to be even with him and not be asked for another uncomfortable photoshoot to make a paramore jealous.<br />
<br />
&quot;...Alright, fine, but you owe me for the next time we head out, man.&quot; Ron spoke, looking into the mirror and rubbing a hand through his trimmed beard. He was a rather handsome guy, he thought, could do a lil more work, maybe do working out more professional, get into the big leagues...<br />
<br />
&quot;Tiiiight, I can do that, I&#39;m about to get myself some prime time with the big guy!&quot; Xane hooted, Ron rolled his eyes and said his goodbyes before looking at the call hang up. Suddenly, he realized something was off with the cell phone he was using, it hadn&#39;t been the same as his usual cell phone. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, shoot,&quot; Ron said, noticing the rose pink cell phone case as probably a new look for Cindy&#39;s phone, though, he didn&#39;t recognize the brand. He found himself on a new app that he also didn&#39;t recognize on the device as a &quot;generating&quot; appeared.<br />
<br />
&quot;A fit man is questioning what he is looking at.&quot; was the prompt that was generated, along with a popup map that showcased 2 other people in a grid map of what Ron recognized as his own home.<br />
<br />
&quot;Damn...&quot; Ron noted, tilting his head touching around the map and touching what he saw as himself.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ron, Human Male, Age 32...&quot;<br />
<br />
Ron did the same to the other occupants and saw Jim and Cindy&#39;s stats were also appearing for them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Welcome to the Word-Transmogrifier 2.0, you can choose to generate a sentence at random or select a person on the mini-map and create a sentence to change! Choose a word from a sentence and change them in order to make a transformation or a reality change!<br />
<br />
WARNING: Awareness to changes can be clicked on or off when selecting a change, if not clicked, a change will be random.&quot; The device spoke with a generic female voice.<br />
<br />
Ron&#39;s eyebrows went up when he saw what Cindy was likely using on her phone and was intrigued, though, he was still confused as to what this meant. Maybe it was like that ride in the amusement park that gives you a sentence and you can make it into your fantasy...<br />
<br />
Ron absentmindedly clicked the &quot;ok&quot; button and saw the &quot;generating message&quot; before a prompt quickly appeared:<br />
<br />
&quot;The muscular man wants to explore his options.&quot;<br />
<br />
Not long after, Ron also saw a &quot;generate again&quot; button on the lower left hand corner of the app and the &quot;mini-map option&quot; on the right.<br />
<br />
With that, Ron decided...</p>
