<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You struggled a bit trying to get the zipper back off but the more you reached with your mitten hands the more they lost mobility. Eventually your hands were just stuck forward with no wrist movement, they seemed very shiny too, as if you&#39;d dipped them in wax. <br />
<br />
At least you had managed to get your pants back up. You were still throbbing there. You felt like you had an intense hard on with a very large dick but... there wasn&#39;t anything but a firm plastic lump. <br />
Nothing to betray your little distraction. <br />
<br />
There was a knock at the door. <br />
&quot;Hey John. Should I mention that this isn&#39;t the bathroom or were you playing with things you weren&#39;t supposed to again?&quot; <br />
<br />
Jess could see your feet sheepishly fiddle around beneath the dressing room door. <br />
&quot;Hey technically no one ever told me NOT to mess with more costumes&quot; You explained, you looked at your hands &quot;Umm, but I might need help?&quot; <br />
<br />
You didn&#39;t think this was even going to BE a progressive costume. None of the ones you had tried on so far had such a trapping effect. You considered maybe it was just going to sink into your hands, but as you looked in the mirror it seemed like your hair had gotten gel on it. Like it was turning to plastic. Your little blonde ears had stopped moving too. Looking stiff and shiny. <br />
<br />
And... <br />
Oh that was weird. Your cheeks began to pinch, you held a hand up to your jawline as you began smiling against your will. <br />
&quot;Eeeeh that&#39;s bizarre..&quot; You said in a tone, trying to force yourself back to a neutral expression, it sneaked back into a happy smile. But you didn&#39;t feel happy. Your cheeks looked firmer too. Well this was one way to get botox. <br />
<br />
On the other side of the door you could see black boots tapping impatiently<br />
&quot;Are you going to open up or are you indecent? Do you need me to get Dad?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Um hang on.&quot; You went to undo the latch, but had trouble moving the sliding toggle. This was very ablelist. <br />
<br />
Jess heard you scrabbling against the lock. And more scrabbling. It sounded like a hunk of plastic smacking and spattering. <br />
&quot;What did you even put on?&quot; she raised an eyebrow. <br />
<br />
&quot;Uh. I was trying to be more masculine. I&#39;m fully clothed though...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh good.&quot; <br />
<br />
You firmly expected her to be able to open the latch with magic, but instead she just crawled under like a regular person. <br />
<br />
She popped back up. <br />
<br />
Jess had bright fake orange hair with some dark roots, fair skin, freckles and dark make up. She wore mostly casual black clothing with a black turtleneck and many bracelets. To a normie she might look somewhat &quot;goth or punk&quot; but to actual goths and punks she looked basic. You weren&#39;t actually sure how old she was, but she seemed vaguely a couple years younger than you. <br />
<br />
You took a step back to allow her space, while she looked you up and down. <br />
<br />
&quot;Please don&#39;t laugh.&quot; You said smiling nervously <br />
&quot;Mm I won&#39;t. This wasn&#39;t the worst attempt at a cure.&quot; <br />
<br />
She went to open the door proper while you stood there with bent elbows grinning like an idiot. <br />
<br />
&quot;Y&#39;know the Ben costume eventually makes you immobile. But you wouldn&#39;t have known that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You should really put warning labels on some of these.&quot; You suggested. <br />
<br />
&quot;That ruins the fun of having my cousin as our brand new mannequin!&quot; <br />
<br />
A shiver ran up your spine but you stayed smiling. <br />
&quot;Haha... you&#39;re joking right?&quot; <br />
<br />
She looked at you like she wasn&#39;t, then rolled her eyes. <br />
&quot;Well you&#39;re not much use to us smiling in the window.&quot;<br />
<br />
You tried to blink but something stopped you, you glanced in the mirror. It was beginning to look like your eyes were painted on. You shuddered. You turned back to your cousin expectantly.<br />
<br />
She looked back. <br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You just said you weren&#39;t going to leave me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well not forever. I mean I don&#39;t know, a few hours feels like a decent punishment for messing around.&quot; She smirked. Then began walking away. <br />
<br />
You panicked, following after. Ugh your legs were feeling stiff and inarticulated. You grunted and forced it to bend, and it surprisingly began bending. Huh. Could you force it? <br />
<br />
Your elbows were getting stiff, and you had just been letting it. You pushed and forced it into loosening up. <br />
Trying to shake off the stiffs, you did the same to your wrists regaining some mobility. <br />
You followed her to the register. Where she just looked at you while she drank some coffee.<br />
<br />
&quot;I need you to take it off me now.&quot; You demanded nicely. <br />
<br />
&quot;What do I get out of it?&quot; she asked, booting up a very old looking computer that was attached to the cash register. <br />
<br />
&quot;Um, an employee, duh.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Hm I already have that. And it&#39;s not like it&#39;s busy. I could just wait til it seals you in then dress you up at my leisure.&quot; she sipped her mug &quot;Break you out at lunch.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Please&quot; you huffed, rubbing your cheeks to try and get mobility back in your face &quot;I was just trying to fix it.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Hm ok. Only if I can choose your wardrobe for today. I have questions about your uh little... frilly clothes magic thing.&quot; she motioned over you, referencing your body&#39;s tendency to change whatever you were wearing into something &quot;girly&quot; or at least closer to the French Maid costume. <br />
<br />
&quot;I really don&#39;t need any more magic costumes on me...&quot; You rolled your eyes, impressively looking like animated paint on your face.<br />
<br />
&quot;No not magic. Regular clothes. I just want to see what happens with different things.&quot; <br />
<br />
Oh.<br />
You thought it over. <br />
That wasn&#39;t so bad, you could feel your toes beginning to stick together. <br />
<br />
&quot;Fine. Deal. Just get it off.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jess put down her mug and came around behind you, unzipping. Instead of a smooth soft unzip as if it had been fabric it sounded chunky. <br />
You shivered, the feeling of ice up and down your spine happening again. She came around to the front and pulled, grunting with considerable effort. After a few minutes of both of you pulling in opposite directions, you pulled your head back gasping. The rest of the costume collapsing underneath you. The hard plastic of the fake chest clunking on the ground. <br />
Your tail puffed and you shook your arms out, flexing your fingers into a fist and back out again a few times. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ooh that&#39;s better...&quot; You said rolling your neck as if you had been very stiff and tense. &quot;Sorry for trying another one on. I was just looking for something manly to cover up... y&#39;know all this.&quot; <br />
<br />
Jess started to gather the costume back up, making sure it hadn&#39;t gotten dirty on the floor. <br />
&quot;Sooo you picked the man that&#39;s typically a little girl&#39;s toy?&quot;<br />
<br />
You followed her to the back to restock it. <br />
<br />
&quot;It just felt like the best choice of the bunch?&quot; You said shrugging, catching a glance of yourself in the mirror, ugh back to a thin femboy. You pulled your skirt lower in shame. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well I can&#39;t fault you for that.&quot; she said looking at the whole wall as if she was thinking of something that would get you back to normalcy.<br />
<br />
You thought about what she had said in the dressing room<br />
<br />
&quot;So you said &quot;Ben&quot; immobilizes the wearer... do you know what all the costumes do?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;No actually. Just a few. Some are actually really unpredictable. Even Dad doesn&#39;t know how they&#39;ll ALL take shape. I always wanted to experiment with them more, see if it&#39;s the same on every one, or if it changes depending on the wearer. And I don&#39;t know, I suspect the longer they sit here enchanted, the more they might want to be worn or maybe it even shifts their magic after awhile. Some are even older than me.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Do you ever try them on?&quot; You asked curious. <br />
<br />
&quot;Go sit in the dressing room, I&#39;ll go get your wardrobe for the day.&quot; she flat out ignored your question and walked back to the other part of the store. <br />
You sighed, annoyed that she acted like she didn&#39;t hear you. But obliged. A deal was a deal. And you weren&#39;t sure if you should cross a witch today. <br />
She was probably gonna shove a clown costume on your or something. As you closed the door you thought how it might actually be more embarrassing to be walking around in an ill-fitting regular costume instead of a magic one. <br />
<br />
You were surprised when she slid in a witch costume wrapped in plastic. On top was a model looking awkward in it, a note about how the wig and make up was not included. Non-magic. Only 16.99.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just ignore the hat. Just put on the dress and tights.&quot;<br />
<br />
If only a month ago you&#39;d know you&#39;d be sitting in a dressing room with your cousin asking you to cross-dress. <br />
Well you were already... cross-dressing... Still. That was against your will. Well so was this...<br />
<br />
You stripped, trying to ignore your cute little underwear. You initially didn&#39;t think it would fit as a woman&#39;s costume, but were disappointed to see your thin legs fit well into the black and white striped tights. <br />
<br />
You opened the door in a very cheap looking simple black dress. It had a faux print of corset strings printed onto the unhemmed fabric. <br />
&quot;OK what were you wanting to get out of this?&quot; you asked, as nothing had happened yet &quot;It&#39;s a dress. Of course it&#39;s not changing.&quot;<br />
<br />
Your cousin could have made you eat your hat(that you weren&#39;t even wearing) with what happened next. <br />
It started in the legs. What had been simple striped tights, lowered into individual stockings, they kept the pattern but they now ended in a white lace ruffle garter with black bows on each side. <br />
You felt a fluttering under the dress as it suddenly filled out with crinoline, pleating and gaining ruffles in the skirt and the end of your sleeves. The fake criss-crossing ties across your chest became 3-D and suddenly squeezed in slightly, cinching your waist in a comfortable way. A white ribbon spun out of the neckline of the dress and tied itself into a bow. <br />
<br />
You were stunned. Your face was red, as you turned around to see something of a gothic-lolita outfit in the mirror. Just a band of skin showing below your petticoat and above your garters. <br />
<br />
Your cousin clapped excitedly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my gosh! That turned out way better than I could have hoped for.&quot; She looked at all the details &quot;That&#39;s so cool! It&#39;s like it&#39;s trying to get back to the Maid costume without actually changing into the Maid costume. Ugh it&#39;s times like this I wish I was more of a scientist than a witch. I&#39;m so taking notes on this.&quot;<br />
<br />
You could barely see it out of the corner of your eye but a ruffled bow finished up the whole thing on your lower back. You were still blushing. You covered your mouth, embarrassed. <br />
&quot;I&#39;m not.. I can&#39;t work like this.&quot; You said sitting down, crossing your legs. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well not with those shoes...&quot; she made a face at your sneakers that clashed with the outfit. <br />
<br />
&quot;You said wardrobe, not shoes. Besides, they&#39;re comfortable&quot; you closed your eyes in defiance.<br />
<br />
Waiting a minute for a snarky remark, you reopened your eyes to see your cousin still ogling all the details. <br />
&quot;Ugh sorry! It&#39;s just. I&#39;ve been wondering all morning what would happen if you put on girl clothes instead of guy clothes. This is insane. It&#39;s such an upgrade too. I wonder if we could sell this... I noticed your stockings you left on the couch didn&#39;t change back.&quot; <br />
<br />
Something about the words &quot;your stockings&quot; incited you. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ugh!&quot; you stood up and marched back to the counter standing behind the register. &quot;I did what you said. Now just go ahead and train me on register. Let&#39;s get this day over with.&quot; <br />
<br />
She approached you without an ounce of malice on her face. You kept your arms crossed, your guard up. <br />
<br />
&quot;John.&quot; she started &quot;I&#39;m not... I&#39;m not making fun of you. I think you look really nice like this.&quot; <br />
<br />
Ah fuck. <br />
Just what you needed to hear. <br />
<br />
&quot;Are you going to train me on register or what?&quot; You asked, ignoring the reassurance. Still thinking at how much she had been laughing at you last night for something similar. Bold of her to change her mind now. You bet she was trying to trick you into putting some other girly sissy shit on. <br />
<br />
She rolled her eyes. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ok first let&#39;s make you a login.&quot;</p>
