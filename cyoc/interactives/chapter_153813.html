<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Freddy woke up to find that was 7:00 again. That allowed him to have a choice in the matter. He still had time to get ready to go to school, but he could also stay home if he chose. Freddy pondered over his thoughts for a few minutes before deciding what to do. He pulled out his phone and made a call to Michael.<br />
<br />
Michael, still in a deep sleep in his room, had a long night. Although he felt absolutely jubilant leaving Freddy’s house yesterday, that euphoria was short lived when he got home. There was another spat with his father last night and a feeling of saltiness washed over him. He didn’t like where things stood with his dad. He wished his father was more supportive of him the way that his mother was. He wished his father would be happier with how well he normally did in school. More than anything else, Michael wished that his father would say he was proud of him. <br />
<br />
Lost in a deep slumber, Michael was awoken not by his alarm clock, but by the buzzing of his phone. <br />
<br />
“Huh” Michael blurted out groggily as he wiped his eyes and began to shift himself up into a sitting position. “Who is calling me this early?”<br />
<br />
Michael picked up his phone to see Freddy’s name on the screen along with a very sexy picture of him. Despite how his morning wood ached at the sight of his boyfriend, he knew a call this early couldn’t be good. <br />
<br />
“Oh no” Michael thought to himself. “This is early for a phone call. It can’t be good.”<br />
<br />
Michael composed himself before answering the call. He coughed briefly before he began. <br />
<br />
“Hello?” Michael asked, his voice sounding very groggy.<br />
<br />
“Hi Michael” Freddy responded nervously. “Uh, I have to talk to you.”<br />
<br />
“What’s going on?” <br />
<br />
Michael sat up in his bed, still half asleep as he rose. <br />
<br />
“Uh, Michael, I want to get your advice on something.”<br />
<br />
“Can’t it wait? I was in the middle of a really nice dream.”<br />
<br />
“It’s important.”<br />
<br />
Not wanting to let his boyfriend make an impulsive decision without him, Michael resigned himself to waking up and shimmied a bit in his bed to get comfortable. <br />
<br />
“Ok, Freddy. What’s up?”<br />
<br />
“I want to know what you think I should do today?”<br />
<br />
“Do you have any choice in the matter? Unless you tell your parents what happened on Wednesday, then you have no choice, you have to go to school.”<br />
<br />
“Uh, Michael, my father already knows.”<br />
<br />
This revelation bolted Michael upright as he sat up on the edge of the bed.<br />
<br />
“What?” Michael asked with a growl in his voice. <br />
<br />
“Uh, my father overheard some of our conversation yesterday.”<br />
<br />
Freddy could hear Michael slap his forehead on the other end of the call. <br />
<br />
“You idiot!” Michael yelled. “I knew we shouldn’t have had that conversation at your house. I knew, and, in fact, I said, that someone might be listening in and they were after all. Who was it, Freddy? Who overheard our conversation?”<br />
<br />
“First of all, Michael, didn’t we go over this yesterday? I asked you to stop condescendingly talking down to me and putting me down. Secondly, only my father heard it and he’s not going to tell my mother.”<br />
<br />
“It doesn’t matter if only your father knows, Freddy. It still puts your whole family in danger.”<br />
<br />
“Well, if it wasn’t for my father, we’d actually be in a lot more trouble right about now.”<br />
<br />
“What are you talking about, Freddy?”<br />
<br />
“Did you know that when Josh discovered Fido walking up the stairs, he was about to call the cops before they had to physically restrain him?”<br />
<br />
“Wow, your brother sure is a pain in the ass. Thank God I don’t have a sibling.”<br />
<br />
“And he’s been badgering them nonstop about why they haven’t been looking harder for Fido and putting up missing dog posters.”<br />
<br />
“Well, that’s why I’m glad I told them about the curse originally, but this is different. What if the wizard finds them, Freddy? Or they decide to take matters into their own hands? We’ve just put them in grave danger. I knew we should have had this fight at my house. It was a big mistake and…”<br />
<br />
“Michael, I don’t want to have another fight over the phone, right now. I’d like us to be on good terms before going over to Sofya’s again tonight.”<br />
<br />
“You’re right, Freddy.”<br />
<br />
Michael got up to start from his bed to start pacing around his room. Freddy was right. Although they never should have spoken so openly at Freddy’s house, what’s done was done and it was important that they stayed on good terms to go over to Sofya’s on a united front. Any signs of weakness between the two of them could be exploited by her and made to be used against them. It wasn’t a risk worth taking, even if Michael felt that some of things they needed to work on had to wait until after the curse was broken. <br />
<br />
“So” Freddy continued after a moment of silence. “I’d like to get your advice on what you think I should do. You always seem to know the right thing to do in times like these, so I’d like to get your feedback before I make a decision.”<br />
<br />
“Wow Freddy” Michael replied, genuinely touched by the comment. “That’s very sweet of you.”<br />
<br />
If Michael could see Freddy in person, he’d see him blushing in embarrassment. <br />
<br />
“Don’t make too much of it” Freddy replied. <br />
<br />
Michael would have normally made another backhanded compliment or snide remark, but he held himself back, not wanting to upset his boyfriend after a genuine display of emotion. <br />
<br />
“Right” Michael continued. “Anyways, so you want my advice, huh?”<br />
<br />
“Yes, Michael. Please don’t make too much of it.”<br />
<br />
“Ok, Freddy. Hmmm…”<br />
<br />
Michael thought for a moment as he laid out all the various possibilities in his head. On the one hand, Ellie was still in heat so Freddy was most likely to dog out there. However, if he did, he could also self pleasure himself back into humanity if the need arose. On the other hand, Freddy would be less likely to be distracted by dog pheromones at school, but he could be triggered by other scents and dog out there as well. If Freddy dogged out at school, it would be much more difficult to hide him and keep his secret from all of his peers. Getting him out without being detected would be a struggle as well. <br />
<br />
Having made up his mind, Michael spoke up again. <br />
<br />
“I think you should stay home, Freddy.”<br />
<br />
Freddy nodded as he listened in. <br />
<br />
“I know it might raise some eyeballs that you stayed home again after just coming back to school yesterday, but it’s pretty easy to write off as long as we can cure this curse by Monday. Your parents can just say that you were being bullied and you need a day off to go to a therapist. Or you got food poisoning. Or your grandma is sick or whatever. The point is, there’s less room from problems at your house then in an environment we have less control over.”<br />
<br />
Freddy nodded in agreement. This seemed to be the course of action he was going to take. <br />
<br />
“Thanks Michael. I agree. I think it’s best that I stay home and if Ellie makes me dog out again, I’m going to pleasure myself back into being human. Hopefully, my mother will be around in case anything starts to happen to me.”<br />
<br />
Freddy paused for a moment before he added:<br />
<br />
“I’m going to let my parents know. Thanks Michael.”<br />
<br />
“No problem, Freddy.”<br />
<br />
“I love you Michael”<br />
<br />
“I love you too, Freddy.”<br />
<br />
Freddy hung up the phone with a sense of glee. He was happy that he heard the words he’d been waiting to hear from Michael for a while now. It was nice that Michael seemed to process and take in some of the issues they’d been having last night. Even if they hadn’t worked through everything just yet, it was a start. <br />
<br />
Freddy got himself up to go down to the kitchen table where he spotted his brother and parents eating. <br />
<br />
“Dad, can I talk to you?” Freddy asked his father. “Alone, please.”<br />
<br />
“Sure” Freddy’s father replied as he got up to leave the table. His mother looked on in concern. <br />
<br />
The two of them walked up the stairs before standing in the hall.<br />
<br />
“What is it, son?” his father asked. <br />
<br />
“I decided I want to stay home from school today” Freddy replied. <br />
<br />
“Sure thing, Freddy. Let me just make a phone call and talk to your mother. Be careful today and try not to dog out while your mother is around, ok?”<br />
<br />
“Ok dad.”<br />
<br />
Freddy’s father nodded as he headed back downstairs while Freddy went back into his room to lay down in bed again. Despite the fact that he had already slept, Freddy seemed to drift off into sleep again. When he woke up, he thought that he had only been out for a couple of minutes. Instead, when we looked to the alarm clock, he discovered:<br />
<br />
“Oh shit!” Freddy thought to himself. “3 PM!”<br />
<br />
Freddy got up from bed and checked outside his window. The new fence seemed to have been secured in place over night and there was no sign of Ellie outside. Relieved, Freddy got up to go take a shower. He noticed that his face had more scruff than usual, due to his lack of shaving in the morning. It felt bristly. He thought it made him look sexy, but he didn’t know how Michael would respond to it, so he decided to shave it instead. <br />
<br />
When he got himself dressed, he went downstairs and noticed the backdoor was open and his mother was sitting outside. <br />
<br />
“Freddy, come out here” his mother called to him. “It’s a nice day and you should get some fresh air.”<br />
<br />
Nervously, Freddy stood in place not wanting to go into the domain of Ellie. <br />
<br />
“What are you waiting for, Freddy?” his mother continued. “It’ll do you good not to be cooped up in the house all day.”<br />
<br />
Knowing that he couldn’t resist, Freddy walked outside and joined her at the makeshift table and chair set she laid out in the yard. <br />
<br />
“Have a seat, Freddy.”<br />
<br />
Freddy went to sit next to his mother as he took in the view of the yard. He looked to his right to notice that Ellie had been let out again. He could smell her and his loins were acting up. He knew he shouldn’t be out here. He was about to go tell his mother when she cut him off at the pass. <br />
<br />
“I want to use the bathroom, Freddy. Can you wait out here to make sure the table and chairs don&#39;t get knocked over?”<br />
<br />
“I don’t think that’s a good idea, mom.”<br />
<br />
“Come on, Freddy, it’s only going to take a couple of minutes and if…it happens to you, you can yell for me and I’ll be right inside the house.”<br />
<br />
Knowing it was a bad idea, Freddy nodded as his mother got up to leave. Just as she went inside and closed the door behind her, Freddy’s worst fears were confirmed. Ellie, after days of looking over the structure of the newly erected fence, found a weak spot and knocked it over with all of her strength. When the fence came down and crash landed onto their property, the happily tail wagging, brown and white Australian Shepherd bitch known as Ellie found her prey. <br />
<br />
“Oh shit!” Freddy said aloud. <br />
<br />
Freddy got up to run back into the house before she sprinted herself towards him. Before he could reach the door, Ellie knocked him down with the strength of a wild bear. She began sniffing at his butt and balls as they rested beneath his jeans. <br />
<br />
“Oh!” Freddy moaned aloud as the ticklish sensation of Ellie’s nose turned him on. <br />
<br />
She began to lick at his butt in his pants as Freddy could feel his erection growing. <br />
<br />
“Oh no!” Freddy thought aloud as he felt the dog sheath return again. <br />
<br />
“Mom!” Freddy yelled. “Mom! Help me!”<br />
<br />
Freddy’s mother could not hear him as she did her business. Freddy could feel his fur returning as it began to sprout on his feet and legs. <br />
<br />
“I have to get my clothes off and fast” Freddy thought to himself as he pushed Ellie off of him and managed to shimmy his pants and underwear off. He saw that his feet were already paws and his legs were shrinking and reforming into the hind legs of a dog. Black and brown fur sprouted over this new hind legs as he could feel his muscle mass shrinking and his tail growing back. <br />
<br />
Ellie leaped into Freddy’s butt as he she began to stick her nose into it. Freddy, fighting off feelings of horniness, pushed her off again and pulled himself towards the back door.<br />
<br />
“Hurry, hurry, hurry” Freddy thought to himself as he tried to stand upright, only to lose his balance and fall on his face again. Ellie trotted over to lick his face.<br />
<br />
“Lost my ability to walk already. Great.”<br />
<br />
Freddy managed to roll onto his back as his hind legs and sheath waved in the air. From his waist down, he already resembled a dog. Ellie began to stick her nose at his flailing red penis, which Freddy responded to by pushing her away. Freddy felt his hands begin to go numb as he managed to briefly push himself up to lift his tee shirt over his head and toss it aside. He laid back down as he could see creamy white fur sprout rapidly on his stomach and could feel black fur tickling his back on the grass below him. Freddy raised his arms to discover them sprouting fur as they mutated, crunched and shrunk into the front legs of a dog. His hands were soon gone as his paws returned, the black claws longer than Freddy last remembered them.<br />
<br />
Finally, Freddy’s face began to disappear as fur grew all over his head and his facial structure shifted rapidly. His snout grew back, his nose became dark and damp and he could feel his strong dog teeth enlarge again. The sounds around him became louder and more intense as his ears grew while his vision changed and he saw the world without color again. It was all over now. Fido had returned. <br />
<br />
Fido rolled over to his front and then proceeded to get himself up into his four legged standing position. Ellie looked at him curiously before she began to make her moves again. She licked at his red penis flapping in the breeze while Fido pushed her away away his snout. <br />
<br />
“Bad girl!” Fido barked. “Bad, girl, bad!”<br />
<br />
Ellie whimpered as Fido could hear the back door from her yard swing open. <br />
<br />
“What’s going on out here!?” Freddy’s neighbor yelled. <br />
<br />
Fido looked up to see Bill, his next door neighbor, who walked over to where he and Ellie stood. <br />
<br />
“What happened to my new fence!?” Bill yelled as he began to try to lunge for Fido, who fled his grasp. “You mangy mutt! You destroyed my fence! I spent a lot of money putting that thing up and now it’s destroyed! It’s all your fault! I’m calling the pound!”<br />
<br />
Freddy’s mother heard the commotion outside and stepped out to discover Freddy’s neighbor yelling at a scared Fido and a yipping Ellie. <br />
<br />
“What’s going on out here?” Freddy’s mother asked. <br />
<br />
“Your mangy mutt ruined my fence!” Bill yelled back. “This dog over here knocked up my beloved Ellie and now we’re going to be dealing with an entire litter of puppies! You need to get this dog out of the yard right now or I’m calling the pound!”<br />
<br />
“Oh my” Freddy’s mother thought to herself, repulsed at the thought of her son getting it own with the neighbor’s dog. <br />
<br />
“Right now, Mrs. Benson!” Bill yelled. <br />
<br />
“Uh” she responded, not sure how to address the situation. <br />
<br />
From behind them came Freddy’s father and Josh. <br />
<br />
“Uh oh” Freddy’s father thought to himself. <br />
<br />
“Fido!” Josh yelled out in surprise. “You came back, boy!”<br />
<br />
“Oh no” Freddy thought to himself as Josh ran to hug him before Bill pulled Josh away from him.<br />
<br />
“Oh no you don’t!” Bill yelled to Josh. “Uh uh, no! You are not keeping this mangy mutt in the backyard anymore. I want him out of here right now!”<br />
<br />
“No!” Josh yelled back. “I want Fido!” <br />
<br />
Tears began to form in Josh’s eyes as Freddy’s father grabbed Fido by the scruff of his neck.<br />
<br />
“Come on, boy” Freddy’s father said to him. “Out you get.”<br />
<br />
Freddy’s father dragged him through the house to the front door as Josh begged and pleaded for Fido to stay. Ignoring his yelling, Freddy’s father got to the front door before opening to discover….</p>
