<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Nathan finished getting dressed and turned to Jon as he was grabbing his backpack. “This might sound like a strange question,” he said, “but do you ever have any, err, 'fantasies' about power and transformation?” Jon looked at him with a frown. “Yea I guess,” he said. “Why?” “Well,” Nathan answered, “what if you could actually have some of those powers?” “That's why they call it a fantasy, dude,” Jon answered as he closed his locker.<br />
<br />
Jon, a bit perplexed by Nathan's question, began walking out of the locker room to his next class. “Seriously,” Nathan said, “maybe I can show you,” and with that he flashed a brief and imaginative glimpse of his own powers into Jon's mind, just to see if it would hook him. It did. Jon stopped and turned around, “what was that?” he asked Nathan.<br />
<br />
“Dude, you'd have to experience it to believe it.” Nathan answered. “Well, fuck yea I'd like some of it. How do I get it?” “I don't know yet,” said Nathan, “let's meet back here early tomorrow morning after the basketball players finish their morning practice.” “Ok,” Jon said, “I'm doing a cardio run tomorrow morning for football anyway.”<br />
<br />
Nathan finished classes; he didn't want to examine how much his knowledge grew after wearing the medallion, but he seemed to know every answer to everything in class; for once class actually seemed a little boring to him. He ran home in his now tight clothing and threw them off as soon as he stepped in his bedroom. He picked up the medallion again to see if it had any other etchings. He didn't notice anything new, but any evil thought, any thought of revenge or selfish power caused the medallion to glow. He wasn't sure why.<br />
<br />
Then he got an extremely evil idea. “What if I could posses people?” Nathan thought. He flipped through his yearbook from sophomore year and found one jock he particularly loathed: Gene Strickler. He was a receiver of the football team and always seemed to have 4 girls hanging around his shoulders. Gene didn't particularly pick on Nathan, but the medallion increased Nathan's jealousy of Gene and he wanted a piece of his popularity. <br />
<br />
So Nathan reflected on Gene and an image grew in his mind. He was watching Gene! What he was doing now! Gene was watching the state university basketball team playing on his TV. “Hmm, what could I do...” Nathan thought. He explored Gene's house and backyard and saw a small patch of forest outside his house. He wanted to teleport there.<br />
<br />
Nathan stood up, still in his tight boxers, and thought of teleporting to Gene's home. As he did he noticed himself, and his medallion, start to evaporate, he kept concentrating as his body turned invisible then his visibility went dark. Within his seconds he was placed in the forest only 50 feet from Gene's home. He traveled intact!<br />
<br />
Well, everything but his boxers. Only he and the medallion seemed to go anywhere. Looking down at his naked body he figured it would be best not to leave a trace of anything anyway, but it made him think that, in order to use most of his powers, Nathan was probably going to have to be naked.<br />
<br />
So Nathan turned himself invisible and walked up to Gene's window. Gene was stripping down to his own boxers in preparation for bed. Nathan teleported himself to Gene's bedroom and, while still invisible, crept behind Gene as he folded the blankets on his bed back. <br />
<br />
Nathan's medallion began glowing again. The evil thoughts of possessing Gene grew in Nathan's will and mind as he could think of nothing else. Not sure exactly how to do it, Nathan turned himself visible then immediately grabbed Gene by the mouth—to keep him quiet—and the chest and threw him on his bed. Staring into Gene's eyes, he thought of nothing else but possessing him.<br />
<br />
As he did, he noticed his body began to change. It turned into steam, or something like that. Shocking himself Nathan lost focus and his arms began to grow in tact again. This, freaking Gene out, caused him to get up. Though they were the same size, the power of the medallion helped Nathan to regain his control over Gene. As Nathan began transforming into smoke again he noticed he had control over it, so he found whatever orifice he could to burrow himself into Gene's body. The steam crept over Gene's face and dug into his ears, nose, eyes and mouth. It was taking too long and Nathan was losing his body mass, causing Gene to be able to stand. He threw himself—as steam—down Gene's body and under his boxers, causing the steam to dissolve them as if they caught fire. Now naked, Gene was in shock, but as he tried to run toward the door Nathan was already in him, borrowing himself through his butt crack and into his legs, holding Gene's body steady. Nathan traveled through Gene incorporating his own control over Gene's body. In doing so, his muscles began to further grow. Gene's thighs tightened and elongated as veins protruded out. Gene shaved his legs but the power caused brown hair to grow back over them again as his legs and thighs tightened. Gene's abs contorted to an eight-pack and his pecs grew another inch, leaving monster shoulders. As Gene's biceps grew, so too did hair grow over his arms, hands and pits. <br />
<br />
The steam sapped itself into Gene's body and Nathan had full control. He looked at himself, proud of his new body. He noticed the medallion was gone. It too must have turned to steam and possessed Gene. He looked down at his package and made it grow bigger, doing so made him horny as the semen went into overdrive-production. He wanted to fuck.</p>
