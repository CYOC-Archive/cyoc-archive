<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Susan knocked on the door Gerry a 30 something business man came to the door.<br />
<br />
Can I help you?<br />
<br />
Oh god. Susan began to cry.<br />
<br />
Gerry towered over the now 5'4&quot; Susan. In a quick move for this large body she stepped into the doorway and <br />
grabbed Gerry.<br />
<br />
He tried to get away and he was no small man but the new Susan was much more powerful than he was.<br />
<br />
It's me Susan.<br />
<br />
Look I don't know what you are trying to pull but ...<br />
<br />
No really I got this machine and it made some changes to me and now it wont change me back.<br />
<br />
Look you I don't know who you are but ...<br />
<br />
I can prove it. She pulled out her wallet from her back pocket. She had slipped it in there feeling that <br />
carrying a purse would not be a good idea in this body.<br />
<br />
Showing Gerry her drivers licence Gerry said so you stole her purse. I will just take this and give it back to <br />
her.<br />
<br />
But Gerry sweety. I can prove it. She went through a littany of personal events that only the two of them <br />
would have known. Gerry was floored. He was gasping for air when she told him that she had gotten the <br />
chronivac to make a few changes for him to make him perfect.<br />
<br />
Look Susan I was happy with myself as I am. You were the one that had problems with me.<br />
<br />
No no no don't you remember talking about those young guys. I was going to make it so that you could compete <br />
on a better lever than they ever could. I was trying to help and now look at me. I love you Gerry.<br />
<br />
Look Susan I understand that you were trying to help but seriously I am not gay and even though I realize it <br />
is still you inside there I am not going to bang a guy. I think it is best we just make a break here. <br />
<br />
Susan began to cry. Gerry couldn't help but put his arm around her and she returned the hug pulling him into <br />
her. Forgetting herself she gave him a quick kiss. This felt so weird with her beard. As soon as she did this <br />
he pulled away and she realized that it was over with Gerry.<br />
<br />
As she went home she went to a bar she had never even thought of going into. She wasn't gay but her attraction <br />
was for men and she didn't know how to solve this problem. She sat at the bar and ordered a foo foo drink and <br />
sat there eventually falling into a crying fit again. She found the men here to be very sensitive to her and <br />
several guys came to comfort her. There was a big muscled white guy name Bob. There was a big black man named <br />
Eric. There were several twinks and she really didn't care for them. And there were some drag queens. This <br />
threw here confusion into overdrive as to her desires.<br />
<br />
Bob and Eric were roommates and at times they would play together but they were not partnered and Susan went <br />
home with them after downing what would have amounted to a river of beer. This would have made her incredibly <br />
drunk as a woman but it just gave her a good buzz in this body.<br />
<br />
As they got back to their place she like a little school girl became shy and the boys stripped first. Sit down <br />
Sam. Eric said patting the place next to him on the sofa. She had to give them some name and that was the <br />
first one that came to her. She sat down next to him fully clothed. Bob sat on the other side of her and she <br />
was now sandwiched between.<br />
<br />
Eric put his arm around her back and began massaging her shoulder reaching over to her to unbutton her shirt <br />
and loose the straps on her overalls. As she sat her small belly pooched out making it look like she was <br />
positively fat and as her overalls dropped she noticed that her cock was barely noticeable under the rolls at <br />
her waist and she had noticed that she was very well endowed indeed. About as good as Eric was.<br />
<br />
Bob was quite small in comparison but he was no slouch.<br />
<br />
As the comforted her she found herself on her knees sucking Eric off and Bob was pressing her virgin ass. She <br />
found this quite enjoyable. <br />
<br />
It wasn't until they had switched and she was now sucking Bob and Eric was fucking her ass that she had her <br />
first male orgasm. His long thick cock hit the right point and sent her into excitement. She had never thought <br />
about using her appendage before but the sensation was so incredible she found herself soon probing Bob's hole <br />
with her massive cock. Bob was versatile but Eric was only a top and as she fucked Bob Eric once again probed <br />
her ass finding that spot and sending both her and Bob into orgasm.<br />
<br />
She was exhausted with these two guys and collapsed in a pool of sweat. She might like this after all.</p>
