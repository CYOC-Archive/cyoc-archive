<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kyle&#39;s voice changed to sounding very smug on the other end, &quot;There we go. That&#39;s what I was hoping for. For your transformation-.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Go fuck yourself,&quot; she said and hung up.<br />
<br />
The sudden sound of the phone slamming down caught Kyle off-guard. Angry, he tried calling again. Jennifer found her clothes and continued to get dress, letting the phone ring. &quot;Jackass,&quot; she muttered before leaving her room, feeling frightened over what had just happened.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, the Curse had deemed Kyle&#39;s &quot;turn&quot; had been completed. He dared her to say &#39;transform&#39; and she was made to comply, but it was against the rules for him to ask her twice. It was now Jennifer&#39;s turn, and as a punishment to Kyle for his transgression, Kyle opened himself up for both a dare and a transformation. So the Curse waited, and heard Jennifer&#39;s next two sentences, and accepted them.<br />
<br />
Kyle swore and muttered to himself. &quot;She said &#39;transform&#39;. I can still give it to her. She will-HEEHAW!&quot; The sudden burst of the sound out of his mouth surprised him. &quot;What?&quot; He stood in his room, confused, waiting for a few moments before suddenly he again burst out &quot;HEEHAW!&quot; Then he cried out in pain and fell to the floor. He body began to contort, not only swiftly changing into the shape of a donkey, but one so endowed that it was able to curve with enough length to penetrate his own behind.<br />
<br />
Within a minute from hearing the noise his mother opened the door to his room and screamed.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Jennifer continued about her morning routine before heading to school, waiting for something to happen. But nothing did. Instead, for a reason she couldn&#39;t understand, she felt a small well of power sitting within her body. She wasn&#39;t sure what it was, but instead of her feeling of fear growing about it, it almost felt assuring.<br />
<br />
As the day continued, she almost forgot about the events of the morning. It wasn&#39;t until lunch she took a moment to look around to see if Kyle was lurking about somewhere, but she didn&#39;t see him anywhere.<br />
<br />
&quot;Looking for somebody?&quot; Jody, one of her fellow cheerleaders, asked. The table was filled with the squad, most of them talking among themselves.<br />
<br />
Jenn sat back down. &quot;Yeah, sorta... no. Never mind.&quot;<br />
<br />
Smirking, Jody said, &quot;Well, that cleared that up.&quot;<br />
<br />
She lowered her voice. &quot;You know that T or D curse story about the town?&quot; Jody raised an eyebrow. &quot;You remember Kyle Persimmons, that dork we pantsed?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Perkins,&quot; she corrected. &quot;Yeah. What about him?&quot; She took a bite of her sandwich.<br />
<br />
&quot;He called me this morning and tried to curse me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jody almost choked on the food, &quot;You shitting me?&quot;<br />
<br />
At that moment the head of another one of the squad turned around fast, staring at the Jennifer. &quot;Are you alright?&quot; Em asked Jennifer.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m fine,&quot; said Jody as she finished coughing.<br />
<br />
Jenn nodded, &quot;I think so.&quot; She recounted what happened, for some reason feeling a need to &#39;not&#39; say &quot;Transform or Dare&quot; to them until she meant it.<br />
<br />
&quot;So you were like hypnotized or something?&quot; Jody asked. &quot;I mean, it can&#39;t be real.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think it is,&quot; said Jenn. &quot;And I think he fucked it up, because nothing&#39;s happened to me. Do either of you know what the rules are to this thing? According to the legends.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jody shook her head, but Emily said, &quot;I know a little. Not sure how accurate it is though. It&#39;s passed from one to another by &#39;turns&#39;, like a game. Though I&#39;ve heard some people say you can curse the person who gave it to you back immediately, and I&#39;ve also heard some people say the one who gives it to you is immune. Not sure if they can&#39;t be targeted again ever or maybe it needs to be passed around a few more times, but it sounds like that varies depending on who you talk to.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Are there limits to what can be done?&quot; Jennifer asked.<br />
<br />
Emily shrugged. &quot;The target gets the choice or transforming or taking the dare. If they choose transform, the one with the power might be able to do anything to them - but I have heard that this thing can&#39;t go beyond the town borders. Not sure what happens if someone with the power or who has been changed by it tries. Also, if the target chooses dare, the one with the power can&#39;t change them. You can only instruct them to do something. Again, not sure what happens if you instruct them to do something that heads outside of the town or if they leave before completing it. Oh, and if neither is picked within a minute of being asked, the target gets one of both. But otherwise, a dare can&#39;t transform a person, and a transform can&#39;t force someone to take an action.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow,&quot; said Jody. &quot;Great. They should package this as a board game. Hey, does that mean Kyle might had been like not a giant dork or something? Cause if that&#39;s the case, then somebody would have had to had done it to him.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And if Emily is right about the no-backsies rule, Kyle wouldn&#39;t had been able to target them back,&quot; said Jennifer. &quot;Holy shit. I might have a massive amount of power right now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jody looked over to Emily. &quot;So where did this Curse thing comes from anyway?&quot;<br />
<br />
Emily shook her head, &quot;Nobody knows.&quot;<br />
<br />
The conversation continued on, but Jennifer was only half listening. She took some time to start weighing her options as she looked over the entire cheer squad, including about a dozen girls. A giant grin grew on her face. &quot;Girls, if this is true, I think we have a huge opportunity here, one I don&#39;t want to waste on something petty. Let&#39;s meet up after classes by the track field.&quot;</p>
