<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">"Six", read Chris, looking at the dice as they stopped.  "And no doubles..."<br /><br />

Sid sighed.  "Captain Obvious, to the rescue," he said, sarcastically.  "Tell me, bunny-boy, do you ever have a thought that <i>doesn't</i> come out of your mouth?"<br /><br />

The rabbit ignored him and watched as Tyler's piece slid forward the correct number of spaces, stopping briefly at an intersection.<br /><br />

"Looks like I could head in even deeper," said Tyler, aloud.  The fact that Sid nodded rather than pointing out that this, too, was an obvious statement wasn't lost on Chris.  Still, if he was counting right, hopefully that particular change would be over, soon.<br /><br />

Tyler considered and -finally- leaned in and tapped his piece along in the same direction in the second ring of spaces.  "I think this route has the best distribution of changes while getting me to the end of the board, mostly quickly."<br /><br />

The Incubus nodded, but interjected, "How do we know that all our problems will be fixed?"  The others looked at him as the teensy-tiny pawn -almost invisible on its base- slid onto a green space marked "MYSTIC".<br /><br />

"What do you mean?"<br /><br />

The demon looked at Chris with a dull expression of resignation on his face.  "Well, the rules just say that you move around the board until someone gets to the End Space and that person is the winner.  How do we know that the changes can be undone by getting there?  Or undone for all of us?"<br /><br />

"I guess we don't," said Sid, his paws still massaging his erection through his jeans.  "But if we don't try..."<br /><br />

"Here we go," interrupted Tyler, watching the board.<blockquote><i><b>TEMPORARY CHANGE<br />- 4 rounds-</b><br /><br />

"Your height's been dwindling since that ill-fated roll,<br />
So to compensate, here's a surprise:<br />
Possess, now, the power of certain control<br />
Over others' scale, proportion and size..."</i></blockquote>Tyler blinked.  "Say what?"<br /><br />

"A power?  You gained <i>a power</i>?"  The demon looked annoyed at the concept and glared at his former lover with jealousy.  "How come you guys get powers and I..."<br /><br />

"You weren't complaining until you saw how things ended, remember?" said Sid, quietly.  "I think this games gives as it does; sometimes it's useful..."<br /><br />

Chris nodded at the statement, but suddenly got a curious look on his face.  He pulled out his cell phone and made a quick call while the others continued.<br /><br />

"But ... I don't feel any different," said Tyler, looking at his hands.<br /><br />

"Why don't you try something," suggested the Incubus, looking down at the tiny man.<br /><br />

"Yeah, make Chris rabbit-sized..."<br /><br />

The wealthy man stuck out his tongue at Sid and continued to speak in quiet tones into his cell phone.<br /><br />

"No, I think I should try this out on something else, first..."  With those words, Tyler looked over at the back-to-back study desks in the corner by the window.  His eyes fixed on the one of Sid's shirts, tossed over the back of a chair.  "Ok," he said in a low voice, "start growing..."<br /><br />

Nothing happened.  Tyler shifted from one foot to another, standing on his chair, and squinted, trying to focus his desire upon the shirt.  Inside, with everyone watching the target of his stare, he thought <i>"start growing..."</i>.<br /><br />

The shirt moved.<br /><br />

Looks of surprise and fascination traveled between the men at the table as -across the room- Sid's T-shirt began to shimmer and droop further over the chair.  Inch by inch, the fabric seemed to expand, the weave not only getting bigger, but the overall shirt, enlarging.  Thicker and heavier, the shirt grew, until it's short sleeves touched the floor, draped over the chair like a throw-rug.<br /><br />

Even Chris stopped talking on his phone for a second and just stared.<br /><br />

"Whoa..."<br /><br />

Tyler smiled.  "Ok, this change isn't all that bad..."<br /><br />

The small man stood fully, craned his neck to look down at his chest -still awash in his oversized clothes- and then closed his eyes to concentrate.  After a few moments, his clothing began to shrivel and shrink on his form until -after a minute- tightening to a nice, close fit.<br /><br />

He smiled up at the others after opening his eyes.  "There...  Much better..."<br /><br />

"You're still a shrimp..." said the demon with a look of amusement.  Each of the others still looked horrendous and the tiny clothing that Tyler was wearing looked no less decayed to him ... just smaller.<br /><br />

"Yeah, well the game said my power only works on others so keep your observations to yourself unless you want to be looking up at me from between my toes," retorted Tyler with a smirk.<br /><br />

Sid got up and walked across the room to pick up his shirt.  The bulk of his clothing was mostly in tatters on his body from his size and shape changes, earlier, so -with a nod to his friends- he pulled the shirt over his head and put it on.  It hung to his knees, now, but fit snugly across his shoulders...<br /><br />

"Well, it's not a good fit..." he said, happy for the distraction from his constant lust.  "But at least I have clothing, now."<br /><br />

"Here," said Tyler with a wider smile, "let me adjust that..."<br /><br />

Focusing his concentration, Tyler stared at Sid in his serape-like T-shirt.  The lion could feel something washing over him; a warm wave of ...<i>something</i>... intangible.  Like a heat lamp in his mother's greenhouse, the effect was more akin to energy rippling over his massive physique rather than something that felt ... supernatural.  Still, however, it made his body feel odd...<br /><br />

The lion blinked and looked down at himself as he felt the shirt getting tighter on him.  Glancing back at the others, he saw that they were all staring at him.<br /><br />

The floor felt like it was sliding beneath his bare paws, but sliding in an odd, "inward" direction.  The smooth wood tickled his sensitive paw pads and almost felt like it was moving inwards, beneath him.  It didn't take long, however, to feel what remained of his pants tightening and constricting around his waist.  He blinked again and looked down.<br /><br />

He was growing...<br /><br />

"Hey, what are you doing?"<br /><br />

Tyler chuckled and slowed his concentration.  "Making sure the shirt fits..." he said, plainly.  "I figured, though, I should at least try it on a living person..."<br /><br />

The demon stood and now looked eye-to-eye with the seven-foot-six lion.<br /><br />

Sid put his arms on his hips and strode back to the table, glowering with a semi-perplexed expression on his face down at the diminutive Tyler.  "Very funny.  Put me back..."<br /><br />

Tyler shook his head and laughed.  "Come on, Sid...  Look at it this way:  it's fun.  It's possibly the only good thing to come of this game so far!  Besides, I'll change you back before my power runs out..."<br /><br />

"You always did like big men," quipped Chris, putting his cell phone away in his pocket again.  Reaching down, and trying not to stare up at the big predator to his left, Chris picked up the dice.  "I think, though, it's my turn, now..."<br /><br />

The dice clattered to the board with all of them standing, now.  They watched as the black dots spun and danced their way across the board, finally coming to a halt with a "4" and a "6".<br /><br />

"Not bad," said Chris to himself.  "Another big roll...  At this rate, I'll be there in no time!"<br /><br />

All of them watched as his lapine pawn slid along the spaces, heading for its inevitable destination.  Slowly, it came to a halt and Chris felt his heart start to race.<br /><br />

A black space.<br /><br />

He'd stopped on the only color yet unmarked.<br /><br />

He swallowed hard and looked down to see what would happen.<br /><br />

However, unlike the previous times, each and every black square did not light up with scrolling text.  This time, just the single square he was one became populated with words.  In plain and simple English, without a rhyme, they said:<blockquote><i>LOSE A TURN<br />Do not roll the dice on your next turn.</i></blockquote>"Does ... does that mean, my turn's over?" he eventually asked, looking at the others.<br /><br />

"I guess so, Chris," Sid rumbled, looking down at the smaller rabbit, curiously.  "I think you -well- lucked out?"<br /><br />

Chris nodded, mostly to himself, and sighed, relieved.  "Ok, maybe we'll make it through this after all..." he said, to himself.<br /><br />

Tyler nodded and leaned against the table, relieved.<br /><br />

Silence filled the room.  Finally, Sid spoke up, looking at the others, furtively.  "Well, that's it for now.  If you guys will excuse me, I need to go to my room and -uh- handle a few things..."  He looked at the Incubus and -after a moment- shook his head.  "I...I'll be back later..."<br /><br />

With that, he walked past Chris towards his room.  However, just behind him, the huge lion paused and turned.  Looking down at the tall-eared form of his friend, he sighed.  Leaning in, he hugged him and kissed Chris on the top of his head.  "Your clothes have changed, hon; nice to have you back..."<br /><br />

With that, and with a shocked look on Chris' face, the massive lion strode into his bedroom and shut the door.<br /><br />

The first of the temporary changes had worn off ... Chris was no longer famous, wealthy or hated.</p>
