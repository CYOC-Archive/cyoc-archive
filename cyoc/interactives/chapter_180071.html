<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The white furred wolf grinned as he saw someone who he didn&#39;t think would come around much... the one they all referred to as Papa. Papa, or Papa Werewolf as some refer to him, was generally not someone who came out of the woodwork, except for very special occasions and this had to be one of them. All of the wolves stopped what they were doing as they bowed to and looked upon him with a regal reverence. He was, of course, a legend among them. It was said that Meljin, god of the werebeasts, turned Papa Werewolf into the first of their kind, the High Alpha of all of the packs and no one dared mess with him. Papa was a huge, hulking, towering monstrosity of a beast standing well over eight feet in height with a thick, powerful body that brimmed with dark brown fur for the most part while other shades of brown were scattered all throughout his pelt. His sheath and balls were just massive; his sheath was as thick as the largest mug of ale that could be found in the towns and the orbs that hung below his sheath were the size of large oranges. They all knew what his cock looked like, as they were all given an opportunity to service him as a sign of allegiance to his might... and if not... he would rip their throats out should other wolves not know their place among him. If there were ever any pack disputes within individual packs or even the higher family of packs, he was the final decider. It was even known that the darkest, most sinister of their brethren didn&#39;t dare mess with him either. He, of course, was their father as well. His thick body, packed with massive and bulky muscles caused the fur to stand and bristle with even the slightest bit of movement.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... well... well... what do we have here Brutus? Thinking about making yourself a new cub?&quot; Papa asked, smiling, looking upon the frail-looking humans, known as Halven, pinned by one of his family.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah... I was thinking about it Arthur! Good to see you, by the way! I thought you were done making pups since your pack has grown so large and many divisions exist beneath you.&quot; Brutus said smiling, stroking the head of hair on the human who was going to be made into a cub, Brixton&#39;s head resting firmly against the muscled gut of the big bear.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah... well... then it looks like we have something in common then. Shall we make them together? I think it was high time for us both to create beasts of pure evil... don&#39;t you? My dark werewolves are fun and all, but I think we need to go even darker... what do you think? I know bears don&#39;t tend to make dark versions of themselves, by your rule of course, but don&#39;t you think it was high time for that... hmm?&quot; Arthur mused.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... funny you say that, because it just so happens that I was looking to do just that. It has been a really long time since I let out the more monstrous side of myself. I haven&#39;t ever let go and turned humans in that form and I have been really looking forward to it... though the opportunity never really presented itself to me. Hell... I rarely ever make a cub for myself... so with you here... I say we both go to that darker side of ourselves and create true monsters!&quot; Brutus said with a grin as his honey amber eyes shifted to a pure, sinister and souless looking crimson.<br />
<br />
&quot;Couldn&#39;t have said it better or agree more with you Brutus!&quot; Arthur said, as his emerald and amber eyes turned pure crimson as he licked his muzzle hungrily.<br />
<br />
As the two humans looked upon their would-be transformers, fear and dread built up inside of them and wafted off of their bodies like a sweet and fragrant cologne. All of the beastmen around them grinned and breathed in deeply, savoring the smell, all of them having a slightly dark taint to them, but nothing compared to those they referred to as the &quot;Dark Werewolves&quot; and the bears... well... they didn&#39;t have anything akin to the wolves. They tended to feast and fuck, enjoying the revelry between and among them, devolving into thick and heaving mounds of brawny muscled fur as they enjoyed their occasional orgy. This would be something completely new for them, if their papa was going to create them... which looked like it was going to be the case.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t be afraid little one... you have nothing to be afraid of. Soon you will be at the top of the chain. In fact, you and your human buddy there will get to be at the tops of brand new chains, ain&#39;t that right Arthur?!&quot; Brutus said with a grin as his fangs grew more menacing, more sinister and evil looking as his body grew even thicker with brawny muscle. Claws that were once mostly blunt were elongating, sharpening and curling slightly while the color of his regular to medium brown fur darkened to a more robust chocolate brown while getting thicker, more spindly, as if the very hairs of the fur could become weaponized while Arthur took on a similar look, his fangs appearing more tusk-like.<br />
<br />
Arthur and Brutus looked at each other, grinning, simultaneously asking the other &quot;feels good, doesn&#39;t it?&quot; while the other nodded in response as if their minds were linked somehow. <br />
<br />
Both males, now standing beside one another looked to their fellow respective members of their beast family and motioned for them to release their new recruits, as the bears and wolves looked at one another curious to know what the highest of their leaders were up to. Brutus&#39; once sheathed, thick cock was now out in its full nine-inch by six-inch thick glory, dripping with thick, corruptive pre that made both Brixton&#39;s and Halven&#39;s heads swim with lust. The thick rod throbbing and pulsing, jutting out from his body as his thick orbs, full of his cum, hung there and jostled slightly with every bob of the werebear&#39;s cock. Grinning from pointed ear to pointed ear, Arthur looked upon the human males and could tell that the men&#39;s interests have seemed to have changed. Where they were once eager to flee, now it would seem that they wanted to stay and see what life was like as the two highest leaders had in mind. &#8203;<br />
<br />
&quot;Let them go...&quot; Arthur commanded the group, keeping the humans in place, wanting to see what they would do.<br />
<br />
Hearing the command, the werewolf and brawny werebear let go as they were instructed, and just as Arthur thought... neither male fled, but neither male moved in closer either. However, Arthur could see curiosity in their eyes... he could even see a desire for the ability to do as they pleased without caring, being true monsters in every sense of the word. Just thinking about it made his cock begin leaking thick pre from the hybrid-looking penis that looked like a slightly pointier and tapered human cockhead, a bit redder in color and knotted at the base of the sheath that was slowly starting to swell and fill from the teasing pleasure.</p>
