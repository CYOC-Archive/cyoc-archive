<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I couldn’t see anything from my folded position. Well, I could see my huge cock and balls, which was a pleasant sight to behold, but that was my only sight so I couldn’t look at my surroundings which was annoying.<br />
“Are you alright, Clay? It doesn’t hurt you to be like this, right?”<br />
I wanted to tell Jay that I was fine, but my vocal cords were not at their best at the moment. The small guy tentatively rubbed my flat rubbery surface of a back.<br />
“Wow, it’s so impressive...Nobody could guess this is actually a human being. I wonder how Rod did it.”<br />
He had done a great job. I looked like a regular towel like this, a rubbery and male pheromone-scented towel, but it’ll do the trick. It’s not like anyone was going to use me. Besides I could hear my teammates returning from practice, they’re a very rad bunch of guys, but they can be quite the jokesters sometimes. Nothing wrong about that at all, horseplay in the showers is part of being a true man, but Jay and I were quite busy with the fact that I had turned into a towel and all and we didn’t have enough time to stay with them and chit chat. So when Jay heard the rest of the team entering the locker rooms he hurriedly got hold of the manliest towel in the room and proceeded to leave.<br />
“Hey Jay.” Said one of my teammates. “Have you seen Clay? He sort of vanished during practice.”<br />
“I think he felt sick and left.” Lied Jay. “Anyway, I’m in a hurry...”<br />
Then I heard the coach’s voice. He seemed angry. “Why’s that? You know the rules, you have to shower after practice. I don’t want any of my players stinking up the bus on the way home.”<br />
“Yeah, well...” Jay muttered. “It’s just that...”<br />
“He’s just shy. He never showers at the same time as us.” Another one of my friends butted in.<br />
“He must have a tiny pecker!” Commented another, and Jay’s face got as red as a tomato. It was true. I caught him naked in the showers once. He must be less than 3 inches hard. I know that because he was hard when he saw my bare chiseled sixpack. Hehe, he must’ve been fantasizing about some girl he liked. Reluctantly Jay started undressing, I could hear him removing his uniform very slowly. I know very well that the kid could’ve had gotten a regular towel if he wanted, but that would mean leaving me laying on the bench and being used accidentally. It would have been very awkward if any of my friends would have used me to dry off, so I was glad Jay took the courage to use me to cover his tiny pecker.<br />
“I’m so sorry, Clay...” He whispered to his towel.<br />
Nothing to be sorry about, Jay. I know you’d rather not be in this situation.<br />
For the rest of the team members, Jay was wearing a plain, pink (as in human flesh, not the queer pink) towel. But on the other side of this towel my flattened body was very visible. My face was squashed against two soft and quite bubbly buttcheeks, and my flat cock was pressed firmly against Jay’s own erect cocklett. He must be fantasizing about that girl he liked once again. Focus, Jay, focus!<br />
Jay, only covered with me, walked towards the showers. He was very careful that not a single of my more human parts were exposed, however our teammates took that the wrong way.<br />
“What are you so ashamed of, Jay?” Said a naked, much more muscular athlete than Jay.<br />
“I’m not ashamed! It’s just that...”<br />
Then I felt someone grab me by brute force. It happened so fast, but before anyone could see my face on my towel body they had already coiled me up into an improvised whip.<br />
“Hahaha, he’s got a tiny hard-on!” Said the brute as he smacked my face against Jay’s ass. “Nice smooth ass! You shaved your asshole?”<br />
“Stop it! It hurts!” Cried Jay rubbing his reddening ass. He gave a short jump with every single stroke of me, which made his tiny cock dance and bounce in a very hilarious way. I would have laughed if I weren’t the towel being used for the crime.<br />
“Give back my towel!” Pleaded Jay. But when he tried to get me back I was curled into a ball and passed around from one jock to the other. I was getting quite dizzy. But eventually the passing was intercepted...by the coach.<br />
“Stop acting like children!” He said as he tossed me into a basket full of wet towels and lost and found garments.<br />
“Wait, coach! That towel’s...Err...”<br />
“Just finish showering, little guy.” Said the coach. He had caught a glimpse of Jay’s penis, but I wasn’t sure if he was referring to *that* little guy. <br />
I waited in the pile of wet towels for Jay to come back for me...What was taking him so long? A guy came before him and started blindly rummaging through the pile of wet threads. “I think my sock’s on here...” He mumbled as I felt his hand touching my sixpack. I wanted to protest, but his hand went lower down my chest grabbed my flattened cock. Now of course I didn’t enjoy *that* but an electric tingling feeling shoot through all my body when he grabbed my shaft and squeezed it.<br />
“Nope, this wet sock is too large to be mine.” SEE? I wasn’t lying when I said my cock was huge! Then this dude let go of my manhood and picked up a sock that was near my naked body. Now, I’m not a queer, but I felt...disappointed. You don’t just begin to stroke a cock to just let it go like that!<br />
Finally Jay came back for me. He saw me all wet and worn-out.<br />
“Oh, fuck. I’m so sorry Clay! I promise I’ll take you home now and take proper care of you until you’re back to normal!”<br />
Once he got dressed, he rolled me up and stuffed me into his small bag. He seemed disappointed, he had failed to protect me, and everybody in the locker room had made fun of his manhood, even the coach. His reputation was ruined. I wanted to console him, but as an inanimate and moldeable rubber man, there was not much I could do from inside his sports bag.</p>
