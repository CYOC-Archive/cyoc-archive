<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Choon Hee and Hinata slowly approached the entrance, observing the pandemonium the Dark Garden and soldiers created within the park. &quot;I&#39;d say we&#39;ve done a good job so far.&quot; Choon Hee said softly. &quot;Perhaps,&quot; Hinata stated. &quot;However, chaos and fear is not what we are trying to accomplish. Where is Akira?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure he&#39;s around,&quot; Choon Hee shrugged. A smirk now spreading across her vulpine face as she studied the fairgrounds. &quot;And I know exactly how to get his attention.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mia exhaled, once more casting a spell that sent a group of soldiers sprawling. Human soldiers were much easier to deal with than Voids, but this was proving to be exhausting. &quot;Get to shelter!&quot; she called to a group of frightened people. Watching them run, she now noticed Zack, the werewolf helping a group of children run towards a shelter. As the witch looked to call out, she felt herself struck from behind. Crashing to the ground, Mia turned, cursing under her breath as her eyes fell upon the kumiho. &quot;Hmm,&quot; Choon Hee mused. &quot;It&#39;s been quite sometime since I feasted on a witch&#39;s heart.&quot;<br />
<br />
Choon Hee though would be denied her meal as Zack tackled the kumiho. &quot;Mia are you okay?&quot; the werewolf asked. Mia nodded, her heart skipping a beat as she gazed into the werewolves eyes. Both teens so lost in each others gaze that they failed to notice the kumiho stand until it was too late. With a flick of her tail, Choon Hee now wrapped a tail around each of the teens necks, suspending them several feet off the ground. Struggling to free themselves, they could see the kumiho lick her lips hungrily in anticipation.<br />
<br />
The kumiho now found herself struck by several fireballs, her tails loosening their grip as Mia and Zack fell to the ground. As the teens gasped for breath, they saw a familiar figure step forward, his five tails swishing furiously as he gripped the hilt of his katana. &quot;Are you two alright?&quot; Akira asked. Mia and Zack nodded, rising to their feet. &quot;Get the civilians to safely,&quot; Akira said. &quot;I will deal with this one.&quot; Mia and Zack nodded, sprinting off in the opposite direction and leaving Akira to face the kumiho alone. &quot;You have made a fatal error creature,&quot; he growled, holding his blade at the ready. &quot;One you shall not live to repeat.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I could say the same about you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Akira turned, noticing a familiar girl approach. &quot;You,&quot; Akira said in surprise. Hinata nodded, unsheathing Moonslayer as she began to transform. The girl&#39;s face stretching into vulpine proportions, black fur covering her body as four tails emerged behind her. &quot;Your time has come to an end guardian,&quot; Hinata stated. &quot;This time I will not hold back.&quot;<br />
<br />
Akira furrowed his brow, bracing himself as Choon Hee and Hinata charged. Immediately Akira realized he was in trouble. Individually the five tailed kitsune could handle Hinata or Choon Hee. With the kumiho and kitsune working in tandem, Akira was slowly being overwhelmed. Deflecting a blow from Choon Hee, Akira was unable to block a blow from Hinata. The four tail vixen now slashed Akira across the chest before delivering a flaming kick to the kitsunes midsection. Akira grunted, sinking to his knees as Hinata stood above him, a glint in her eyes as she looked to take his head.<br />
<br />
For Akira, the next moment was a blur. Something crashed in between the trio, a dust cloud kicked up obscuring his vision. The next thing Akira knew, both Choon Hee and Hinata were tossed backwards as a figure with nine tails stood between them. &quot;Fukushu?&quot;<br />
<br />
Fukushu furrowed his brow, glaring at the pair. Reaching out a hand, the kitsune general assisted his former apprentice to his feet. &quot;Are you alright?&quot; he asked, the kitsune&#39;s voice deep and low. Akira nodded, once more assuming a defensive position next to Fukushu. &quot;I&#39;m fine,&quot; Akira replied. &quot;I wasn&#39;t expecting to find you here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I saw the attack from the school,&quot; Fukushu said. &quot;I was in the process of cleaning out my desk. I may not care about this town, yet I suspected the Normal were the ones attacking the park. For the moment, we have a common enemy.&quot; Akira smirked, not believing Fukushu&#39;s story as they studied the kitsune and kumiho. &quot;These two are quite formidable. Any suggestions?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The kitsune is mine,&quot; Fukushu growled. &quot;Do you think you can handle the kumiho?&quot; Akira nodded, turning to face Choon Hee as Fukushu stepped towards Hinata. &quot;Tell me girl is it true,&quot; Fukushu asked, his mouth forming into a snarl. &quot;Are you of the Asaya clan?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I am Hinata of the Asaya,&quot; she said proudly. &quot;Your family slaughtered my people for speaking the truth.&quot; Fukushu&#39;s eyes narrowed, his grip on his katana tightening. &quot;Tell me girl what truth is that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Tatsu and Shizen are false gods,&quot; Hinata stated. &quot;Only a false god would lose a child to humans.&quot; Fukushu could feel his face flush with anger as he grit his teeth. The Asaya slaughtered many of his father&#39;s army, preventing his parents the opportunity to mourn his brother properly. The civil war had shaped much of his life, robbing him of his childhood and transforming him into a creature feared throughout the realms. &quot;I am the son of those...false gods.&quot; Fukushu growled. &quot;Brother to the child you so foolishly went to war over. Your people created the warrior standing before you. Your people created the monster who strikes fear in the hearts of everyone for centuries AND now, I will show you why I am called Fukushu.&quot;<br />
<br />
With a roar, Fukushu lunged, his attack both fast and powerful. Hinata blocked, grimacing as she deflected Fukushu&#39;s sword strike, the ground cracking beneath her. Parrying, she dashed backwards, her eyes locking with the angry nine tail. &quot;I know exactly who you are.&quot; Hinata snarled. &quot;Fukushu. The Death Fox. The Angel of Vengeance. The rivers of blood you have spilled for centuries is nothing to boast of. You think my people monsters? The only monster I see...is you.&quot;<br />
<br />
The sinister smirk on Fukushu&#39;s face told Hinata everything. The fearsome nine tail took great pride in his fiendish reputation. As the pair dueled, the young kitsune realized his reputation was well deserved. In a previous duel, Hinata found Akira&#39;s style to be textbook. The five tail was a master, combining speed, strength, and skill. In many ways, Akiras proficiency eclipsed Fukushu. Considering Hinata fought him to a near draw, she believed she could best Fukushu with ease. That, however, was not the case.<br />
<br />
The strength of the nine tail kitsune was incredible. Hinata noted the kitsune attacked with a ferocity than only increased with his anger. Despite his rage, Fukushu remained focused, his attacks quick and vicious knocking the four tail back. It confused Hinata how someone could control his rage, increasing his strength to levels the gods would find frightening. When combined with the skill of a master swordsman, Hinata understood why Fukushu was so feared, now she hoped to not become another victim.<br />
<br />
Knocked back once more, Hinata let loose with a torrent of fox fire. A small grin now spread across the young kitsune&#39;s face, watching the flames engulf Fukushu. &quot;Your family are butchers and false gods,&quot; she hissed, watching the inferno before her. &quot;And your brother was too weak to defend his people.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Was He?!!&quot;<br />
<br />
Hinata gagged as a tail now emerged from a portal of darkness, wrapping tightly around her throat before slamming her into a building. The impact jolted the young kitsune, knocking the air from her. Three more times the tail whipped her into a wall before tossing her to the ground. Coughing, Hinata gazed up as Fukushu emerged from the fire, his eyes gleaming with murderous rage. Hinata now realized the kitsunes magic was far stronger than she realized as another tail wrapped around, dangling her before the murderous kitsune. &quot;I stand here today,&quot; Fukushu snarled. &quot;Because of my brother, the kitsune your people thought weak.&quot; Fukushu now delivered a punch to Hinata’s midsection, knocking the wind out of her. &quot;Your clan has no one to blame but themselves for their fate. A fate, you too, are about to share.&quot;<br />
<br />
Knocking away Hinata’s blade, Fukushu slammed the kitsune to the ground, leaving her on her hands and knees. As he raised his katana, he could see a determined look on Hinata’s face, despite the tears glazing her eyes. &quot;Captain Cassidy,&quot; she whispered. &quot;Father...Dr. Eastly...my new family. I&#39;m...I&#39;m sorry...I failed you.&quot; Fukushu sneered, ready to strike Hinata dead as she whispered her apologies.<br />
<br />
Jiro.<br />
<br />
Fukushu paused. He had heard a whisper, a voice he recognized from centuries ago. It couldn&#39;t be though, he had been dead for centuries. &quot;Jiro it&#39;s over,&quot; the voice said. &quot;You fought with honor. Show mercy now. The Asaya are beaten, you do not need to end their line.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gazing behind Hinata, Fukushu could see the ghostly visage of his brother Raiden. The silver two tailed kitsune locking eyes with his little brother. Raiden was with him, watching the battle from beyond the grave. Now, his brother wished him to show mercy to the ancestor of a foe that dared challenge his family and disrespect his brother. Lowering his sword, Fukushu glared at Hinata. &quot;Leave this place and never return.&quot; he growled, the young kitsunes eyes going wide in shock. &quot;Why?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The battle is over Asaya,&quot; Fukushu stated. &quot;You have been beaten and I will not be the one to end your line. Take this small mercy and live, knowing the true gods and rulers have deemed it so.&quot;<br />
<br />
Unsteadily Hinata stood, her body aching as she stared at Fukushu in stunned silence. &quot;Our people have slaughtered eachother for centuries,&quot; he continued. &quot;No more.&quot; Hinata was still confused. Fukushu showing mercy? That was the last thing she expected. Was Fukushu tricking her? She thought that for a moment as Fukushu turned quickly, launching his katana at Choon Hee and piercing the kumiho through the back. Hinata watched the kumiho collapse, her bloody hands grasping the blade that protruded from her chest. &quot;I spare you but not the kumiho,&quot; Fukushu continued. &quot;If you ever challenge my family though you will share that one&#39;s fate.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hinata nodded, watching Choon Hee grunt in pain. &quot;I had her under control.&quot; Akira grumbled, watching as Fukushu pulled his sword from the injured kumiho. Fukushu said nothing, simply turning to Hinata as the pair shared a look. The fight was now over.</p>
