<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Tiff knew that Luke had taken a fruit and she also knew that those fruits can change someone&#39;s body. So, instead of going after him, she thought it could be more interesting and useful if she waited for to something to happen to him.<br />
She spent the evening with her boyfriend while Luke was hanging out with his friends, he looked a little different, maybe uncomfortable, and she just smiled of what it could be the reason.<br />
For dinner, she offered to help her mother and when she was serving the dishes she put sleeping pill powder on his brother&#39;s food. It would be helpful later, she thought.<br />
<br />
Luke had a hard day, literally. His black boner didn&#39;t cool down after his masturbation, instead he now has a black dick covered in cum that he needed to hide from his friends. If they knew about it he would make fun of him for the rest of his life. He quickly ran to his wardrobe and changed his tight jeans for baggy old-fashioned basketball yellow shorts that his dad used to wear in high school. He looked ridiculous but at least he could hide his boner better than before. The rest of the day, he tried to stay seated or behind his friends.<br />
When his friends left his house, he quickly ran back to his bedroom, took off his ridiculous shorts and looked at his dick. Fortunately, it was still hard but it wasn&#39;t black anymore. It looked like his regular boners, so he expected it to cool down after a moment.<br />
When his mother call him for dinner, he put his shorts back and ran down to kitchen. He eat quickly as he used to do, although it tasted odd but he didn&#39;t care and finished his meal. He thanked to his mother, he glanced at his sister, she was grinning, and ran back to his bedroom.<br />
Maybe it was the boner or just the worry, but he felt so tired that he fell asleep on his bed immediately after he took off his shirt. He didn&#39;t care that he was wearing just his baggy shorts.<br />
<br />
Tiff waited a few hours after her parents when to sleep to sneak into her brother&#39;s bedroom. If her pill worked she wouldn&#39;t have any problem. She took her cellphone to light her way and to take some pictures for her record.<br />
When she was near to Luke&#39;s bedroom and before she entered, she wondered to hear some loud snores. Her brother didn&#39;t use to snore, she thought.<br />
She slowly opened the door and entered, slightly lighting the room whit her phone. She confirmed that her brother was deeply sleeping and she approached to him.<br />
In the darkness, Luke didn&#39;t look different, except for being shirtless which wasn&#39;t usual as Tiff knew. She was getting disappointed before she used her phone to light him.<br />
Luke&#39;s skin was totally dark. His usual pale skin had turned into a rich deep black. It was way more darker than a regular tan but that was all. He still looked the same, his facial features hadn&#39;t changed so he was just a black version of himself. Tiff took a picture and after that Luke snored again, she freaked a little and then she realized that her brother was still changing.<br />
His former brown hair had turned into a deep black and now it was curling. Also, through his raised left arm, she watched tiny kinky hairs poking out and thickening into a messy armpit bush. She took a picture and wondered if it&#39;s happening the same on the other arm. She carefully grabbed it and confirmed that it was indeed growing.<br />
Before she was able to put down his brother&#39;s arm, she realized that it was getting heavier. Luke&#39;s arms was gaining muscle mass and getting buff. She can&#39;t handle it and drop it, falling on the bed an instant before it fell on the floor.<br />
Tiff realized that her brother&#39;s chest and shoulders had grown to match his bigger arms. She used her phone to take pictures of the wide shoulders and the meaty pecs that had grown from Luk&#39;s flat chest. A few kinky hairs appeared between them too.<br />
Until now, her brother had half of the body of a young man. His face still looked the same as well as his legs... Wait a minute, she hadn&#39;t seen his legs. They were covered under a sheet.<br />
She carefully took the sheet off and wondered at what she saw. His brother was sporting a very manly pair of thick legs. Way more longer than his usual leg&#39;s size and covered in a notorious layer of kinky black hair. His feet had grown as well and now he was size 14 at least.<br />
For a moment, Tiff was hypnotized by her brother&#39;s big feet and she wondered if the myth was true. She looked at Luke&#39;s ugly baggy shorts that now looked constricted with his hulking legs. She gasped an instant before she removed her brother&#39;s only clothing.<br />
Luke didn&#39;t make any resistance and she managed to put his shorts between his kneels. He snored at that time and by that she realized that his face had begun his changing into manliness. He didn&#39;t have facial hair but he definitely looked older.<br />
When she returned her sight to his Luke&#39;s crotch she shrieked when his brother&#39;s black python jumped out pointing to her face.<br />
Oh god! She gasped at the sight of such monster. It was big like her forearm and thick like a can. It was so hard and veiny that she was got quickly disgusted, even more she smelled it&#39;s fishy stench. She knew that brother wasn&#39;t very hygienic but it smelled like if he hadn&#39;t washed it for a decade. The slipping precum coming out endlessly from the swollen purple mushroom tip wasn&#39;t very helpful either.<br />
She quickly took her pictures in order to cover it again but Luke snored again and turned sideways. She noticed for the first time Luke&#39;s hairy set of black balls that matched perfectly with his new manhood when they moved along with it.<br />
Lastly, she saw Luke&#39;s black buns which could have looked hotter if it wasn&#39;t by the thin fur on them. She remembered her brother wasn&#39;t very hygienic and took a picture before she moved away disgusted.<br />
Before she left the room she glanced at her brother one last time. She can&#39;t still believe that this young black man was her little pale preteen brother and she wondered how he will react when he discover it, or even worse, when her parents discover it.</p>
