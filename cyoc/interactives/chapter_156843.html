<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mike grabbed the beer he was nursing and noticed the delicious looking hot dog and nachos that appeared next to it... He had a vague sense that it was a gift to him from someone he loved but couldn&#39;t place from who, or how it got there.<br />
<br />
Feeling hungry dove in and devoured every chip feeling perfectly satisfied by the meal within 7 minutes of it appearing. Jeff was conscious throughout the process and aware of every piece of himself separately. The sensation of being eaten and digested was made to be pleasurable like going to the chiropractor and getting all your tense knots worked out, then getting into a hot tub. within 15 minutes of being eaten though, Jeff rapidly faded from consciousness as his bread and meat dissolved away and he was absorbed into his father&#39;s bloodstream.<br />
<br />
The Chronivac noted the recipients and givers satisfaction and submitted feedback to Transdem Laboratories that the Gift Package was a great success.<br />
<br />
53 minutes later the hour long duration of the change expired and the Chronivac attempted to restore Jeff to his human state, but obviously failed because, as the user was warned... &quot;extreme damage or destruction of form will prevent reversion&quot;<br />
<br />
The Chronivac fired up its diagnostic sequence and AI program. It ran through how this happened and sent a follow up feedback form recommending Food not be a possible gift transformation due to  likelihood of reversion issues, and then went about attempting to restore Jeff&#39;s profile.<br />
<br />
Mike was downstairs watching the game which was now 4/5ths of the way through and nursing his 5th beer. Jeff was mostly digested and well dispersed throughout Mike&#39;s bloodstream. The first attempt to pull all the pieces of Jeff back together was halted when the Chronivac noticed it was doing severe damage to cells located all throughout Mike&#39;s body. The second attempt was to use existing material around the largest remaining piece of Jeff to replace Jeff&#39;s lost material.<br />
<br />
Reconstituting a human inside another human&#39;s intestines is not a good time. The Chronivac stopped and reversed the process when Mike&#39;s pain receptors exploded after what would become Jeff began absorbing Mike&#39;s intestinal wall and vital organs. MIke&#39;s memory of the pain was removed and the Chronivac labored on...<br />
<br />
Eventually, the AI program was engaged and examined both the user and the recipient&#39;s profiles. By the time it was finished Mike had gone to bed and was asleep. The AI program was attempting to Recreate Jeff without destroying Mike and the fact that there was only one body was of little consequence to the machine.<br />
<br />
The AI ran recursive algorithms attempting to identify the source Mike-ness in Mike and anything that doesn&#39;t make Mike who he is, will get reverted to Jeff. It could be thought of as though Jeff&#39;s and Mike&#39;s consciousness was interrogated by the AI. If a trait was important to the identity of Mike and its absence wasn&#39;t important to identifying Jeff, it was added. This was the case for many hobbies and preferences. Its often more important to like something than to dislike something.<br />
<br />
Many traits were easily considered not important but conflicts arose around a large number of topics many relating to age, and specific memories. &quot;Is it important to Mike&#39;s identity that he have memory of having a child&quot; YES &quot;Is it important to Jeff&#39;s identity that he NOT have memory of having a child.&quot; YES... <br />
<br />
These conflicts were resolved with a barrage of additional questions and eventually the status both considered more important was chosen. If a determination could not be made, and the quality in question could not be merged, Jeff&#39;s status took precedence.<br />
<br />
The resulting profile created a man that the AI considered the most perfect blend of identities possible. <br />
<br />
All the formative memories of both personalities were included. Hobbies, pass times, preferences, knowledge from both high schools and the one college, job history, life events, skills, all included.<br />
<br />
Age was by far the most difficult thing to determine. 3 hours were used to process what age was most acceptable to both. It was unacceptable to both for each to be the other&#39;s age. And age was very important to the identity of each profile questioned. Eventually, the program determined that both agree it is important Mike is over 21 (due to many of his formative memories) and that Jeff is under 27 (Due to Mikes age at conception), the computer tried to average this to 24 and both agreed that it was more important that Jeff be younger than Mike being older, thus both agreed being 21 would not destroy their Identity.<br />
<br />
Mike&#39;s body began to grow younger and many of his features took on the qualities of his son. Hair, eye, and skin colors changing just a tinge, earlobes becoming attached. Mike kept his athletic physique but lost the excess heft that helped him in football due to Jeff identifying being lean as an identifying quality for himself. <br />
<br />
Around 6am the Chronivac beeped that it was finally complete and sent a follow up message to Transdem acknowledging that restoration was successful. <br />
<br />
The new Jeff (because Mike said his name wasn&#39;t identifying to who he is... after all, a rose by any other name would still smell as sweet.) woke up without the alarm which was one of Mike&#39;s traits. He got up to go through his morning routine and things immediately felt off...<br />
<br />
First, he went to his teenage son&#39;s room and knocked on the door to wake him up for school. Then he went to the master bathroom to get himself ready. He would have been okay if he looked like Mike or Jeff as his memories would have supported either appearance... but he looked like neither. <br />
<br />
(This is intended to be a complete merger of persons, not dual personalities. Reverting would be destroying Jeff 2.0 as a third and separate identity. He needs to choose who to be now, like everyone else.)</p>
