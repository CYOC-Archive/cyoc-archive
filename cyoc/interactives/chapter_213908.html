<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">That morning.<br />
<br />
Tim seemed a little more fidgety, like he was uncomfortable with something, constantly adjusting his collar and sleeves. His chest hair sligthly less prominent over his tighter button down. Tim struggled with the stimulation being sent from his constricted torso, part of it the discomfort of clothes a bit too tight and part of it the slight jolt of pleasure everytime his shirt brushed against his small hard nipples. Tim struggled to remain composed amidst these sensations. <br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s his first real field trip, he must be constipated.&quot; Thought James over breakfast, noticing his grandons&#39;s distress. &quot;Everyone gets constipated on the first time.&quot; The older man made a mental note to talk to the young man later today with some tips to deal with that. <br />
<br />
What the old man missed was how Nathan&#39;s behavior had also became slightly more frantic. The man simply couldn&#39;t stop staring at the other men&#39;s tight shirts and bulging arms. &quot;Wait, now I&#39;m into James too? Is it spreading?&quot; The thoughts crossed Nathan&#39;s mind and were quickly discarded. &quot;You must act normal, we&#39;re scheduled to be here for another whole week, you don&#39;t wanna make them think you&#39;re a perv this early on. Just ignore it and it will be over soon.&quot; He told himself as he washed his plate and mug on the makeshift kitchen area. His erection tenting his pants insistently as every movement from his thick legs seemed to stimulate him today. <br />
<br />
In spite of the tension, or maybe because of it, the 6 of them were quickly able to finish setting up the expedition proper and set out. Theo led the way out of camp and in no time they had arrived at the shrine that both Nathan and Tim had found the night before. <br />
<br />
&quot;Magnificent! And so close to our camp too! Sarah, what do you think? How old are we talking?&quot; James talked loudly, walking in front of the group, clearly very pleased with finding the ruins so quickly.<br />
<br />
Sarah was briefly enraptured by something behind James, but was quickly brought back when he mentioned her name. &quot;Uhn- Oh, yes... Uhm.&quot; She adjusted her bearings while looking over the overall structure of the ruins. &quot;It&#39;s hard to be sure yet, but this looks... About... Mycenaean? Mid to late mycenaean period from the ornament indentures on the surviving bits close to the roof and the base of the walls...&quot; She continued on, talking to James as they took a better look at the structure of the ruins.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile Nathan and Tim were setting up a collection zone, where they could gather and catalogue their findings before they moved back into camp. It was simple enough for Tim, he had practiced it a few times with James, clean up a bit of level ground, rollout some tarp, stick a big nail on each corner and string it up around the perimeter in a makeshift fence. And yet, there was Nathan, observing him as if he was being graded on a test. And yet, Tim felt something else from his knelt down position, being scrutinized by the standing man. Maybe some other day he would feel anger from being micromanaged on such a simple task, but right now he felt... Safe? Ish? Like if he made a mistake he could count on Nathan to help him with it.<br />
<br />
Tim shook his head quickly, this was weird, its not like any mistake he could make would matter, it was literally 4 nails, tarp and string...<br />
<br />
Meanwhile Nathan was struggling to keep it together. He could almost feel the pull of the wellspring again, so he pretended Tim needed supervising so he could be as far away as possible from it. What was up with that water? And why did he want another taste so badly?<br />
<br />
He was pulled out of his musings when Tim got up, -thanked him for his help-, and went into the ruins, the set up being finished. &quot;What?&quot; Nathan stood there surprised with the sudden gratitude, and there was no tinge of sarcasm on that tone either. &quot;Weird, but oh! Before I forget!&quot; He said taking his canteen out of his belt and placing it on the corner of the tarp, he had almost fogotten, but he should send it back to testing as soon as possible.<br />
<br />
Zeke and Sarah looked at the pool curiously. Zeke had never heard of greek structures being built around wellsprings quite like this, without modifying the walls of the pool itself, if not for the intricate, mosaic-like floor that seemed to delineate precisely the shape of the pool itself, one could easily think the ground had simply given out with the passage of time and the pool formed after the structure was already here...<br />
<br />
Sarah was crouching down by the edge of the pool, trying to estimate if the erosion patterns on the smooth stone could help date the pool in relation to the ruins. Only, she could barely focus on her job, she was suddenly so parched. She looked at the spring and the water just seemed so clear, so fresh. She looked around, Zeke was so engrossed in the pool he didn&#39;t notice her looking over, Nathan was taking some pictures of a pile of shards in one side, Tim was talking to James by the entrance, Theo was... Averting his eyes quickly when she looked at him? Cute, but maybe he was a bit too old for her and he lived so far- Her mouth felt drier suddenly. &quot;Oh, right, I&#39;m thirsty.&quot; She looked back into the pool. Should she really be drinking random water from a ruin they just found?<br />
<br />
It was in that moment of hesitation that everyone heard a loud &quot;Oooh&quot; coming from the entrance. And as everyone look they saw James near the collection zone with a canteen in his hand, clutching his belly.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, you shouldn&#39;t drink that!&quot; Nathan yelled but it was too late. James let go of the canteen as he felt waves of tingles coming from his belly.</p>
