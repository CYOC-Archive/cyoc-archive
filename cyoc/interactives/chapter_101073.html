<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Spencer Lawson sat on her bed, only half listening to the music playing through her headphones. They were on to drown out her parents hot and heavy activity going on within the &quot;privacy&quot; of their own bedroom, despite the fact they were so loud between their actual undertakings and expressing their pleasures, Spencer would be surprised if they couldn&#39;t be heard in Seattle!<br />
Meanwhile, Spencer had plenty of things on her mind to contend with.<br />
The talk with her mother, and especially the one with Eric Anderson got her to thinking.<br />
<i>What am I going to do after high school?</i> Until now, she really hadn&#39;t given that much thought. Sure, she got good grades, but they came relatively easy to her, so Spencer got bored in school a lot, leading to things like altering the power point slides before yesterday&#39;s class that got her into trouble and grounded now.<br />
Yet, while Nate Anderson was an average student with some kind of plan to be a mascot for the Minnesota Timber Wolves someday (a real werewolf pretending to be a costumed timber wolf was kind of ironic when she thought about it), Eric was definitely more studious. While he didn&#39;t know exactly what he was going to do either, Eric was already planning on going to college and earning a degree, or three; and he was only a Freshman this school year!<br />
<i>I&#39;m surprised his folks haven&#39;t allowed him to skip a grade or two. Then again, considering Eric&#39;s lack of social skills...</i><br />
In the end, Spencer realized that&#39;s where her REAL problem lied. She was starting to develop a genuine interest in BOTH of the Anderson boys.<br />
Nate was fast becoming a good friend. Spencer would love to also make him a &quot;friend with (sexual) benefits&quot;, but even if she could win him away from his mysterious werepanthress, she wasn&#39;t sure she wanted any kind of a relationship with Nate beyond that.<br />
But Eric Anderson...<br />
Despite his serious lack of street smarts and social skills, especially when it came to dealing with women, there was something about him that kept leading her thoughts back to Eric. <i>He actually cares!</i> realized Spencer, recalling how he listened and encouraged her to talk about herself the rest of their evening together, genuinely interested in her thoughts and feelings.<br />
<i>Nobody&#39;s taken an interest in me like that since Jeremy, and what a real winner he turned out to be,</i> thought Spencer with a sarcastic sneer. <i>While I have to wait and see how things turn out between him and that cheating were-mermaid, could I actually be falling for</i><br />
That thought went unfinished as Spencer felt her cellphone vibrate in the resting place between her breasts.<br />
Quickly taking off her headphones, she actually felt herself smiling as she saw the Caller ID.<br />
&quot;Hello Eric,&quot; said Spencer, answering the phone with a genuine lilt in her voice.<br />
<br />
MEANWHILE...<br />
The only word Nate Anderson had to describe the last 12 hours was FANTASTIC!<br />
As a werewolf with a very active libido, he and his mysterious werepanthress had a fantastic sexual tryst in the woods under the stars. They explored and experienced every sexual position known to both humans and weres, and probably created a few new ones in the process.<br />
Just as the sun began to rise, they gathered their things before the werepanthress led them through the forest trail to a small subdivision at the opposite end from where Nate lived. There, they entered the backdoor of a small house whose open back yard faced the woods.<br />
&quot;Welcome to my humble home,&quot; said the panthress, before she picked off where she left off, kissing and encouraging Nate to new heights of sexual pleasure.<br />
They did it in the kitchen, and then the living room, before she led him to her bedroom.<br />
The whole house was lavishly furnished, and there was no sign of anyone living in it other than her, but it was the bedroom that was the most decorated. A king sized bed with satin sheets, soft lights that could be controlled from either the door or lying in bed, along with mirrored walls and ceiling.<br />
There was only one thing this room could have been decorated for, which the werepanthress quickly confirmed as she threw Nate onto the bed and mounted him once more.<br />
Hours later, Nate awoke to find the beautiful naked lady who the panthress considered her &quot;dull side&quot; lying next to him. She had honored his request to make love in their normal forms, provided they also exchanged positions as to who would be furry while the other was human.<br />
<i>She&#39;s a genuine nymphomaniac!</i> realized Nate. <i>I just hope I survive this relationship,</i> as he got up to answer nature&#39;s call.<br />
He moved to the closest door near the bed, only to discover it actually revealed some kind of huge walk in closet, with plenty of both regular sized clothes and outfits large enough to cover the woman in her fursona. Some of the human sized outfits looked just like what any other woman would wear, as Nate recalled her saying she did have a day job.<br />
But the rest of the human attire, and all of the were size clothing, were definitely meant to accent her were figure and sexiness. There was also a plain looking nightstand with a phone and answering machine on top, but nothing in sight that identified who she was.<br />
Then Nate went to the other door and found the bathroom, but even this was over sized. It had both a bath tub big enough for two with whirlpool jets AND a separate Jacuzzi unit set up that could easily accommodate 4 in his estimate. It also had the more standard bathroom fixtures, including what he was looking for.<br />
The one thing Nate was glad to discover was a prescription bottle of werepanthress birth control pills sitting on the otherwise empty counter next to the soap dispenser. The one thing Nate wasn&#39;t sure of was when she took the last one, which would make the panthress due for the next within 24 hours. <i>Hopefully she&#39;ll take her next pill as soon as she wakes up, and we were still safe before falling asleep,</i> because Nate would be the first to admit he was too young to be a father.<br />
Then Nate took a closer look at the bottle, and noticed someone had carefully scratched the patient&#39;s name off the label, but left the rest of the information intact.<br />
Memorizing the prescription number as if it was a long distance phone number, in case he needed the information later, Nate set the bottle carefully back on the counter and went about his business.<br />
After flushing and washing his hands, Nate started heading back to lay down next to her when the phone in the closest rang. He left it alone, but his werewolf hearing helped him hear the message left by an unidentified male.<br />
&quot;Hey babe. If you&#39;re available, I&#39;ve got a VIP who wants you as part of a duet tonight with multiple encores. Call me back by 4 if you&#39;re interested.&quot;<br />
<i>What the hell am I getting into here?</i> wondered Nate, as he stared at his image in the mirrored ceiling and the sleeping form lying next to him.</p>
