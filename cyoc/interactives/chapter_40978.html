<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jennifer closed her eyes. The sensation was similar to vomiting, except she had no control over what was escaping from her mouth. The salty liquid spewed from her lips and she tasted every bit of it. Finally, after what seemed like an eternity, the stream became short spurts, and eventually a dribble. Unlike a tongue, Jennifer could taste the urine everywhere on her pussy. She tasted it inside Michelle’s pee-hole and on her pussy lips. <br />
<br />
Suddenly the environment around her shifted has Michelle got up off the toilet. Light spewed into the bowl and Jennifer got a glimpse of her ‘vomit’. A white tissue clouded Jennifer’s view and scrubbed her lips dry. She tried to pucker them up as a natural response. The tissue fell into the bowl and the toilet was flushed. Before Jennifer could recollect herself, her view was dimmed by Michelle’s white panties as they pressed onto her lips. <br />
<br />
Life as a pussy was not very exciting. She spent most of the day being rubbed by Michelle’s panties as she walked or being squished when she sat down in a chair for class. She discovered that she could manipulate her pussy lips similar to a mouth, although no sound came out. She wasted time by ‘biting’ into the cloth of Michelle’s panties and tasting the fabric or by making smacking noises with her lips. <br />
<br />
Hearing was another issue. Jennifer became used to the clacking of Michelle’s shoes and her stomach growls, but anything further away was severely muffled. She only heard faint noises when she thought Michelle was talking, and classroom chatter seemed very far away.<br />
<br />
Perhaps the most used sense was Jennifer’s sense of smell. While she couldn’t see anything or hear much more than muffled sounds, she could smell the arousal of herself when Michelle witnessed a hot guy or started daydreaming. She smelt the stench and sweat from Michelle’s asshole, which was closer than Jennifer would like to think about<br />
Most of the day was repetitive, all except during gym class when Jennifer was granted limited views of other girls in various states of undress. But all too soon, the view was over and she was trapped again behind a while cloth.  Jennifer was never hungry and could not fall asleep. <br />
<br />
After what seemed like days, Jennifer recognized a change in the heel clicks, they sounds like they were tapping on concrete, and then on carpet as she thought she heard a faint door close. More walking occurred until Jennifer felt a change in gravity and the white cloth was removed to the sight of Michelle’s fingers! The fingers probed Jennifer’s lips and clit, and stimulated the inside of her mouth. They slowly moved rhythmically in and out, in and out. Jennifer could taste the skin as well as the faint scent of nail polish. Before long, the inside of Jennifer’s mouth started to get wet. Drool began to leak from her lips as she got more aroused. This was a more intense arousal than Jennifer had ever experience. Her whole ‘body’ felt tingly and empty. She wanted to bite and suck on anything to relieve herself of the pressure. <br />
<br />
***************************************************************<br />
<br />
Michelle continued to work her pussy, imagining the new quarterback on the high school football team. All she could picture was his cock pumping her cunt hard and fast. As she masturbated furiously, her pussy lips contracted around her finger! Her hand was partially stuck inside her pussy! It almost felt as if her pussy was sucking on her finger.<br />
<br />
“What the fuck!” Michelle yelled, and soon after that, her pussy opened with a smacking sound to release her finger. She was too shocked to continue further.<br />
<br />
***************************************************************<br />
<br />
Jennifer was too obsessed with sucking fingers to hear Michelle’s scream clearly. Pussy juice slowly dribbled out of her mouth onto the bed below. Being a pussy, she needed some external stimulation. She couldn’t stimulate herself with her limited movement.<br />
<br />
‘Mmm, stick those fingers back in me,’ she thought.<br />
<br />
“Who the fuck said that!?” Michelle had heard Jennifer’s words, but the sound came from all around her. Now nearly dry, Jennifer heard Michelle clearly. She forgot that Kyle allowed her to speak telepathically to Michelle!<br />
<br />
‘Uhhh, it’s me…..Jennifer.’<br />
<br />
“Jennifer!? But where are you? What happened to you in the bathroom?” Michelle got up and looked around the room, disregarding the lower half of her clothes.<br />
<br />
‘Well you see, when I kissed you…..I became a part of you.’<br />
<br />
Well this was making no sense to Michelle.<br />
<br />
‘I am your cunt.’<br />
<br />
“Jennifer stop shitting around, that’s not possible.” However, Michelle had stopped moving and cautiously looked down below towards her pussy.<br />
<br />
‘You know the Transform and Dare curse right? Well, it’s real and I’m proof. Look at me and I’ll show you.’<br />
<br />
By now, Michelle was really freaked out. Surely this was just a prank right? But Jennifer’s voice didn’t seem to have an origin. She heard the voice everywhere around the room. Michelle sat on the bed and leaned back to get a view of her pussy from the wall mirror across the room. Jennifer puckered and smacked her lips.<br />
<br />
“HOLY SHIT!” Michelle nearly jumped off the bed and scrambled to get away from the mirror. <br />
<br />
‘I told you so. That bastard Kyle gave me this curse for 24 hours. Oh and by the way, you really need to change your panties. You must’ve saw like 10 cute guys, considering how many times I drooled. Your panties are soaked with my juices.’<br />
<br />
Michelle couldn’t form words with her mouth. She couldn’t even contemplate what to do next. Her pussy was another girl!<br />
<br />
‘I can’t believe that fucking curse is real!’ Jennifer thought. ‘Well it only lasts for a day, maybe I can have some fun with her.’</p>
