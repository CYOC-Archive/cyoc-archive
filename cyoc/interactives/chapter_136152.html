<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Still hungover from the vodka and from the afterglow of her climax, Melissa felt both exhilerated and confused. What had just happened?<br />
<br />
She remembered falling asleep naked against Erika and the sexual arousal between her legs - the thing she called &quot;warmth&quot; in her clitoris and vagina. She was so exhausted that she had passed out though, and when she had opened her eyes again, Erika was gone; most likely, she had left to pee in the middle of the night or something.<br />
<br />
Melissa had then felt the heat radiating from her crotch, and the pressure of a canine body snuggling up against hers. The room was very dark, but she had guessed Erika&#39;s husky Max must have come into her room when Erika had gone to the bathroom.<br />
<br />
Melissa was petting the dog as it had crawled up against her body, when something hard and moist had brushed against her clitoris, sending waves of pleasure up her spine. She had frozen, unable to push the canine away, mesmerized by the intensifying tingle as the dog rubbed his groin against hers. Was this wrong? What was happening to her?<br />
<br />
A quick glance on the side; her friends, sound asleep on nearby matresses, oblivious to the intruder&#39;s presence. The sensation of a wet tongue flicking against her nipples, making it difficult for Melissa to think. A strange physical need had overcome her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Max... you&#39;re such a good.. dog...&quot; she had whispered quietly as she was frotting her wet slit against the canine erection.<br />
<br />
As their hips were unvoluntarily bucking against one another, she had felt the hard thing slip around her clit and press its length into her vagina, almost making her lose her mind. Tiny electric bursts of pleasure had spiked through her swollen breasts, caused by the canine tongue&#39;s licking.<br />
<br />
Melissa had found herself begging for Max to increase the pace, his doggy member thrusting deep into her and making her want to howl in bliss. It had felt as though the canine cock was swelling inside her, adding to the stimulation. She was not prepared when her climax hit, and had to bit her pillow to muffle a lewd cry.<br />
<br />
The dog came into her hard, filling her pussy with goo. Then the bucking had become more mechanical, each spasm bringing another gush of canine seed. The minutes had seemed an eternity, Melissa basking in the afterglow of her orgasm as an inordinate amount of cum caused her lower belly to bulge slightly. She had never felt so good and alive.<br />
<br />
Melissa had lost the notion of time, only coming back to her senses when she heard a softening knot pop out of her opening, and the dog scrambling out of the bed and through the bedroom&#39;s door.<br />
<br />
She propped herself up on her elbows. &quot;Max?&quot; she called in a whisper, but the room remained quiet.<br />
<br />
Had all this been a dream?<br />
<br />
A sense of peace replaced the furious need for mating she had sensed all evening. She sat up and touched her breasts, making sure this was all real. They were puffy and covered in drool. There also was sticky goo everywhere between her legs, and the sheets were soaked in fluids under her.<br />
<br />
Melissa got up as quietly as she could, grabbing her nightgown and heading for the bathroom. She washed her hands and used a wet towel to clean up her body. She could still feel canine semen sloshing in her lower belly, and drops of fluids kept escaping her slit no matter how many time she would wipe her pussy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck...&quot; she thought. She was so confused. She had had one experience with a boy penis last summer with the neighbour boy, and it hadn&#39;t been much fun. By then she had known she preferred girls (and assumed only boys had penises). She had never thought much of dogs though...<br />
<br />
This new experience... Just thinking about the sensation of a canine cock throbbing in her insides and shooting its load made her heart race and filled her with contentment. She had even forgotten about Erika for a moment!<br />
<br />
Speaking of whom, where was Erika? Obviously she was not in the bathroom.<br />
<br />
Melissa put on her nightgown and walked to the corridor, listening to the sounds of the house at night, looking for clue as to where her friend might be. She heard something shift in the next room; her brother&#39;s room.<br />
<br />
She pushed the door, filled with anxiety. Squinting her eyes to make out the human shapes she caught in the dark, she saw Erika.<br />
<br />
Cole was sitting up on his bed, Erika between his legs on the floor as her head turned to her. She had cum on her face and her right hand was out of sight, between her own legs.<br />
<br />
Everybody froze.<br />
<br />
&quot;Melissa! I can explain...&quot; Erika tried, wiping the cum off her chin. Cole pulled up his bedsheet to cover himself, even though it was too dark for Melissa to see anything clearly. But she had seen enough.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t bother&quot; Melissa said coldly as she turned around and ran back to the bathroom, locking herself. Falling down on the bathroom&#39;s carpet, she started sobbing. Conflicting emotions were overwhelming her. At some point Erika came to the bathroom&#39;s door to apologize, and Melissa chocked on her tears and told her &quot;friend&quot; to go away.<br />
<br />
She was furious, she was desperate, she was depressed, and on top of that she felt ashamed of what had happened with Erika&#39;s dog even though her body had never felt any better. She was disgusting. She had let a dog fuck her! It had not felt wrong at the time, rather the opposite. However she knew she would have to keep this a secret. Nothing would change anyway; it&#39;s not like she could tell her friends the naughty things Erika and her had done together.<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
Caught in a spiral of self-loathing, holding her knees against her swollen breasts, Melissa only got a measure of how many hours had passed when light started filtering through the bathroom&#39;s window.<br />
<br />
When she returned to the bedroom, her friends were slowly waking up, save for Erika who was burried under the bedsheets. Melissa faked having just woken up and the girls went to have breakfast. She wasn&#39;t very good at faking being ok though.<br />
<br />
When Piper insisted on why she looked so gloom, Melissa had to tell a cover story - she could not admit that she had let a dog fuck her. It was only convenient that she had caught Erika sucking on Cole&#39;s dick. As Melissa explained she had seen little Erika giving her brother a blowjob, Emily expressed genuine shock; it was clear however that Piper and Riley were interiorly enjoying the bit of gossip.<br />
<br />
Erika was welcomed with a few snarking comments from her friends when she came in, causing her to leave Melissa&#39;s house hurriedly with her dog.<br />
<br />
Melissa was still feeling torn between anger, loss, and shame. On top of that, she had barely slept at all. After Erika&#39;s departure, she argued that she was too upset and unwell to be good company, and pushed her friends to get dressed and leave the house early.<br />
<br />
She just wanted to be left alone for now. In fact she was so upset that she was starting to feel quite nauseous.</p>
