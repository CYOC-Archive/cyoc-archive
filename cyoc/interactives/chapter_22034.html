<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Rachael knocked impatiently on Mike's apartment door, but still no answer came.<br />
<br />
She had been knocking for five whole minutes. After having got off work she had gone home, changed, and prepared herself for tonight.<br />
<br />
She and Mike had always had a great time on their dates, but its what came afterward that always seemed to fall a little flat to her. Mike was a good man, she knew that, he had a well sculpted body from his years of martial arts training, and wasn't poorly endowed either. But, nevertheles, the sex they had just wasn't very good. Mike would always consent to Rachael's more adventurous ideas, but he never lasted very long. He would either get to excited, and blow early, or would tire out, and not be able to go again.<br />
<br />
Tonight would be different, though. Rachael had been assured that. The last time she had been at Mike's, she had slipped into his workout bag a drink a friend had given her. Her friend, Lily, had claimed she had bought it from China Town, and that the seller had ensured her it would solve all of Rachael's bedroom problems. Although the drink had looked like any other sport's drink, except for the odd horse-man drawing on its back, that Rachael quickly dismissed, it had promised to provide the drinker with speed, endurance, and stamina. To make him a real beast (dare she dream)...stallion in bed. The later two attribute enhancements, she felt, Mike could readily use. And, the first, she reasoned, couldn't hurt. In fact, if the drink lasted as long as her friend had been told, it might prove beneficial to Mike in his future martial arts tournaments too. What had particularly caught Racahel's eye; however, was the the warning on the bottle's back label following its three spelled-out attribute enhancements. The drink warned that it could strongly enhance the drinker's sex drive. This, Rachael giggled inwardly, is what she truly wanted -- to her, it wasn't a side effect.<br />
<br />
But, where was Mike. Surely he had had the special drink she had left him nearly an hour ago. She had placed it carefully into his workout bag, by his normal water bottle, specifically so he would find it after the tournament and drink it. By now, if the drink truly did what it claimed, he must be begging for her, she wouldn't have been surprised if he had answered the door nude with a fully flagged hardon and a desperate plea in his eyes.<br />
<br />
Rachael knocked again, and still there was no answer. Fishing her cellphone from her purse, she dialed Mike's number only to hear his cellphone's familiar ring behind the door, in the apartment.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the hell is going on.&quot; Rachael murmured under her breath. Grasping the door's knob, she finally decided to check to see if it was open. Maybe Mike was waiting inside for her, nude on his bed, his dick nearly purple from need in his hands.<br />
<br />
She was in luck, the door was open. Stepping inside, Rachael marched straight for Mike's bedroom. But, when she arrived, no one was there. Then, from the bathroom she heard a soft moan and a muffled whinny. A whinny? Like a horse's? She carefully approached the bathroom's door, which had been left ajar. Pushing it open, her eyes widened, not with terror, but with surprise. A thin smile slowly crept over her face.<br />
<br />
Lying on the floor were two &quot;men.&quot; One naked, the other not. One human, the other clearly not. Rachael immediately recognized Pete, Mike's brother. Pete, like Mike, was quite an attractive man. She had often fantasized about him and Mike making love together to her. She had mentioned this to Mike, but he had seemed noticeably uncomfortable with the idea; although, he hadn't flat-out refused her. Regardless, his luke warm response inhibited her from describing to him her entire fantasy, which also involved Mike and Pete pleasuring each other while she watched.<br />
<br />
Lying next to Pete was what Rachael had quickly deduced must be Mike. She was a smart girl, and although she had dismissed the half-man, half-horse drawing on the SES drink's back, she quickly figured out that the ebony-furred creature lying beside Pete matched the drawing nearly exactly.<br />
<br />
Interestingly, minutes before Rachael's arrival, unbeknownst to her, Mike had actually progressed into a full horse, only to finally receive desperately needed release from his brother, Pete. The passing of his huge orgasm seemed to have partially (and perhaps only temporarily) reversed his horse transformation, returning him meanwhile to an anthro horse. He had grown considerably; however, in the process: his height dramatically having increased, along with his musculature, and he had retained his further enlarged equine genitalia. Indeed, Mike's cock had already begun to rapidly pulse with blood the moment Rachael had entered the bathroom, the huge ebony python stretching from its sheath, above churning balls, to rise to full erection. Perhaps it was the odor, the female scent, Rachael was giving off, because the unconscious Pete, who seemed to be moaning softly, looked like he had a quivering baseball bat stuck between his legs and up his shirt. His ears also looked slightly pointed, and his hair definitely more shiny and longer.<br />
<br />
Rachael knelt down beside Mike, stroking his mane, her eyes wandering to his huge, throbbing horsehood. Finally, face to face with her boyfriends new, fearsome size, and undoubtedly enhanced sex-drive, the thought dawned on her, even though this wasn't what she wanted, even though she was unmistakably turned on (and maybe that had something to do with the heavy musky odor in the air that was wetting her vaginal lips), perhaps she had gone too far. How was she going to have sex with that.<br />
<br />
Both Mike and Pete began to stir, awakening from their post-orgasmic stupor, Pete's mind immediately assaulted with the memories of what he had done to his own brother and the two smells that were filling his nose (one of a female in heat, the other of a horny male horse). Together they seemed to be driving his libido skyward, and he felt something hot, thick and long continue to crawl up his flat stomach as his skin began to itch.</p>
