<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The she wolf ran through the forest at great speed.  The part of Monique's brain that was still present marvelled at how well the beast could quickly change direction and never lose its footing.  The wolf heard the howl it was chasing once again and continued in its direction.<br />
<br />
After running for 10 minutes or so, the wolf could see a flickering light ahead through the underbrush.  She ran in its direction, since it was also from where the howl had come.<br />
<br />
She ran to the light and could tell as she drew closer that it was a fire.  It was generating heat and she could see a mixture of orange and red.  Monique's mind thought about this.  Were wolves color blind?  She didn't know, but she thought they were.  Either they weren't or there was something special about her particular form.<br />
<br />
Her pace slowed as she came to a small clearing.  There a fire glowed in the center.  It was small, but it raged on enough to heat the immediate area.  The she wolf looked around.  There was nothing to be seen but the fire and all of the trees that surrounded it.<br />
<br />
Then she heard a twig snap.  Her head jolted to her side.  She looked into the line of trees and saw a pair of glowing yellow eyes looking at her.  She started to growl as the figure behind the eyes stepped forth.  <br />
<br />
It was another wolf.  It was just as big as her, but it was more brown in color.  Its muzzle was slightly longer.  The second wolf began to circle around the fire, making the she wolf somewhat nervous.  The second wolf drew closer and the she wolf noticed something very different about it.  It had a huge sheath hanging down between its back legs.  The wolf was male.<br />
<br />
A new set of thoughts took over the she wolf's mind.  How nice it would be for this huge, male wolf to mount her.  She sensed a new set of feelings come over her.  Monique's mind was more than a little afraid, but even she couldn't deny the urge for this male wolf to have his way with her.<br />
<br />
The male wolf walked right next to the she wolf.  The first thing it did was to smell the she wolf up and down.  It then concentrated on smelling the crotch of the she wolf.  The she wolf made a soft noise that could best be described as a moan.  The male wolf forced its muzzle under the she wolf's hulking form.  It licked at the she wolf's opening, sending a jolt of pleasure through the she wolf's body.  Even Monique felt it, and could not deny how good it felt.<br />
<br />
The male wolf lifted its muzzle from underneath the she wolf.  It then proceeded to walk behind the she wolf.  The she wolf knew what was about to happen.  She wanted it to happen.  She positioned herself so that she could be mounted easier.  The male wolf did so quickly, pressing its large sheath into the she wolf.  It humped vigorously and the she wolf was overcome with feelings she had never felt before.  Monique's mind realized that she had never felt anything quite like this either.  She was frightened to realize that she enjoyed what was happening.<br />
<br />
Both wolves howled as the male's humping grew faster and faster.  The she wolf could feel her insides being ravaged, but not in a bad way.  She was loving every second of what was happening to her.  She howled in ecstasy as she felt the male's sheath shoot into her.  The male howled in satisfied triumph.  He had done what he wanted.<br />
<br />
The male pulled out of the femaled and walked around to face her.  The she wolf wondered what would happen next.  Suddenly Monique's mind shot to the forefront.  She was in complete control over her form.  Her head turned frantically from side to side, and now cowered in fear from the male.  She looked down at her paws and could see that they were shrinking in size.  They appeared to be reverting to her human hands!  Now she was utterly terrified.  She knew that as soon as she changed back into a human, this wolf would surely kill her.<br />
<br />
As she felt her spine rearranging itself into that of a two legged creature, she looked back at the male.  The look of pain was clearly evident on her face.  But the male seemed to smile.  Monique looked down at the ground and saw that his paws were shrinking too!  Another werewolf, she thought.  Now the fear slowly passed out of her thoughts.  She felt her ears returning to normal.  Her muzzle pushed itself back in and her extra breasts also retracted.<br />
<br />
She fell face first to the ground.  It was now impossible for her to stand on all fours correctly.  The male wolf did the same.  Their eyes never parted from each other.  She could feel the claws, teeth, and fur all slowly receding into her humanity.  She started to feel the air touch her bare skin once more.  It was a good thing the night was relatively warm and that there was a fire going next to her, else she might have been freezing.<br />
<br />
As she looked at the male's face retracting into a human face, she thought she saw something familiar about it.  She felt her changes coming to a conclusion.  She was human once more.  She lifted herself off the ground and sat with her legs underneath her.  Instinctively she covered up her breasts with her right arm and put her left hand in front the space between her legs.<br />
<br />
The male's changes finished as well.  Monique saw that she was right.  There was indeed something familiar about the face that had emerged from the werewolf.  She blinked several times in a row.  She could not believe what she was seeing.  In total amazement, she whispered, &quot;Joey?&quot;</p>
