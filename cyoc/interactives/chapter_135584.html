<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Well, you know... we&#39;ve known each other all of our lives,&quot; she started, her scale&#39;s inability to blush to be the only thing sparing her from a light dusting.<br />
<br />
James merely nodded, enjoying the feeling of his sister&#39;s tail wrapped around his own. He used his tail to give her a reassuring squeeze. <br />
<br />
Not needing it, but she enjoyed the feeling none the less, she continued. <br />
<br />
&quot;And, well, I can&#39;t imagine a life without you.&quot; Her heart was racing at this, as she looked slightly up at the muzzle of her brother/boyfriend. <br />
<br />
&quot;Neither could I,&quot; James stated, using his surprisingly nimble lips to give her a kiss of encouragement. They melted into each other for a bit, his draconic rod slowly gaining life. <br />
<br />
Breaking apart, she breathed in, &quot;Well... Do you want to have a clutch? With me?&quot; <br />
<br />
She fluttered her eyelashes, the only hair left on her body, but it worked wonders on James&#39; libido. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes!&quot; He nearly shouted and kissed her deeply, letting his hands explore the wonders of his sister&#39;s/lover&#39;s body.<br />
<br />
&quot;It actually worked!&quot; He thought excitedly as he was slowly pushed down onto the floor. <br />
<br />
James and Daniella had been dating basically since puberty at this point, but really they knew that they were meant for each other since James had been born. Their attraction was small at first, simple games of &quot;Doctor&quot; when they got curious about each others&#39; parts, and games of House where they were always either the Mommy and Daddy, or otherwise a romantic couple. Then as they reached puberty the games stopped for a short while, each dealing with their changes in their own time. Daniella took longer, but she started eariler. But the time they had gotten The Talk from their parents and special biology explanations from their family doctor, they had gone right back to playing with each other, only they were far more interested in how they could make each other feel. <br />
<br />
They played at dating other people, just to be sure, but they always came back to each other after long. Oddly enough, while they knew that incest was taboo for other people, they and everyone else didn&#39;t really care when it came to them. This was backed up by a specialist and took a look at their genes and noted that despite being siblings that had a remarkable amount of diversity between them. He estimated that it would take well over 1000 generations of inbreeding before something went genetically wrong with them, though it could be more or less has nither had had a child at this point to test their genes. <br />
<br />
Combine that with peoples total lack of reaction whenever they kissed in front of them... well, they knew that they were going to have kids someday.<br />
<br />
Or so James&#39; hoped. <br />
<br />
It was why he bought the Dragon Husbandry Amulet after all. Ominous warnings about people becoming his &#39;dams&#39; aside, he had some small hope that the Amulet&#39;s supposed &quot;magic&quot; might make Daniella more willing to settle down and have a child with him.<br />
<br />
Now his mind was doing a happy dance as his lover&#39;s tongue slowly made its way down his scaled chest towards his hardening member. Total success!<br />
<br />
A clawed hand gingerly grabbed at his cock. She smiled at his reaction as she rubbed the underside of his pointed head, the grunts of contentment music to her. <br />
<br />
&quot;So, is this the one?&quot; She said with a sharp smile.<br />
<br />
James grunted in confusion.<br />
<br />
Daniella slowly lowered her head to his cock, &quot;Is this the cock that will breed me?&quot; She licked around the head and grazed it with on of her fangs. <br />
<br />
James moaned, &quot;Hell yes.&quot;<br />
<br />
She smiled, &quot;Good,&quot; then slowly swallowed his dick. <br />
<br />
The sweet sensation of her long tongue coiling around his length, pumping him in sync with the bobbing of her hear locked James in place. He placed his clawed hands on her head, but when he tried to control the speed he felt her sharp fangs brush against his member, giving him a thrill of pleasure and danger. Daniella was in control, and there was fuck all he could do about it. <br />
<br />
She kept going at it for a while, James hand on her horns in a facsimile of control as his lover rocked his world. Just as he thought it couldn&#39;t get any better, she took him deeper. She was clearly inexperienced, gagging right away, but it felt so damn good that James couldn&#39;t be bothered to care. He was so close already, human girls (as far as he knew) nowhere near preparing him for the sheer experience. Every part of her actions had the same theme, sexy curves with the slightest hint of danger.<br />
<br />
Eventually, Daniella came up for air, pumping him with both hands. unintentionally edging James. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ahhh, your dick tastes good. But I need to save what&#39;s in there,&quot; she leaned even lower and took his scaled balls and licked them, &quot;for my girl here.&quot; At this she leaned back, showing her pussy while she teased her clit with one hand. <br />
<br />
She leaned onto the smoky carpeted floor and patting her pussy invitingly.<br />
<br />
As James started to line himself up, she pushed him lightly back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now now, I want this too but...&quot; She grinned deviously, &quot;It&#39;s tradition.&quot;<br />
<br />
Not needing a second reminder, James dived in and saw it. Her wetness quivered slightly in the cold air, lightly coated in her own juices. James smiled wickedly, and started slow. He tenderly licked close to, but not quite on, her pussy, savoring her flavor as he was taken away. Even the sweat of a Dragoness was better (to his senses anyway). He continued like this for a while, just barely getting her pussy. She tried to force his hand with her own but he batted her away. Shortly afterward, however, he tenderly ate out his sister. <br />
<br />
She moaned even deeper as she felt her entire womanhood being explored with an eager tongue, though her clit was a favorite local for the wandering tongue. Her moaned raise in pitch, she used her tail to help guide James&#39; head while she played with her tits. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh god- I&#39;m gonna- Shiiiiiiiiiit&quot;<br />
<br />
James continued eating her out throughout her orgasm keeping her aroused. <br />
<br />
After she finished James licked his own lips with his serpentine tongue and crawled forwards.<br />
<br />
Looking deep into her maroon eyes, James kissed her deeply as she nodded, and thrust himself into her.<br />
<br />
He felt warm velvet squeeze him with a strength that few human women could match. It was just moist enough for James to slowly bottom out in her, noting that she lacked her cherry.<br />
<br />
At his raised crest, she giggled. &quot;I never had one.&quot;<br />
<br />
Assuming that she learned that at the OBGYN, they laid there for only a few moments before Daniella slowly moved her hips. James met her rhythm, only for her to pick up the pace. She looked at him challengingly and the race began. Using his hands he lightly tweaked her sensitive nubs, her moans grew deeper and her breathing became shallow. He felt her squeeze him tightly, not wanting to let go of him, so much so that her tail wrapped around his waist and snuck down his butt. He swatted her when she started messing with is anus.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, I&#39;m not in the mood.&quot;<br />
<br />
She nodded and he pounded away at her, with her meeting his thrusts with her own enthusiastic humping. <br />
<br />
He groaned, the earlier blowjob had left him close and eating Daniella out didn&#39;t make his hardness any softer. <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m about to-&quot;<br />
<br />
She got the gist and wrapped her arms and legs around James, not letting him go.<br />
<br />
James then exploded, hot cum spilling into his sister. Her draconic womb was tough enough to feel comfortable taking his entire load, a load meant for a feral dragoness, comfortablly. She felt her womb slowly fill up with eggs as her body realized that she had just been cum into, not sure what to expect but excited none the less.<br />
<br />
They lay there in the afterglow and then...</p>
