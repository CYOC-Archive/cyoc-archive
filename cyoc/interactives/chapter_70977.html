<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><br>As the fire fills the room, still floating in the middle of the air, you see the fire drawing closer to you. You back up, moving to the center of 
the room in fear... not knowing what exactly was going on, not to mention you didn't want to injure your friends. Seeing what was happening, 
the Witch Doctor smiles under his mask and begins chanting faster and faster.</br>
<br>As you and your friend hear the man chant faster and faster, they look to you and watch what was going on, since the room was locked 
and something was definitely going to be happening to you. Slowly, the fire begins to swirl around you in a wide, circular motion, keeping its' 
distance from you. The Witch Doctor begins chanting even faster, flailing his arms up and down, moving all over the room as if he was dancing! 
As he chanted faster, the fire began to circle you faster and faster, increasing in speed and making you drop to your hands and knees in fear. 
Then suddenly, the Witch Doctor shouts at the top of his lungs "Ooaku Ma Daru!" and the fire explodes in all directions and dissipates. With the 
fire gone, you stand up and inspect yourself, seeing no damage done and nothing was any different about you, as far as you could tell. You 
stand there for a moment with a look of relief on your face and see the same thing with your friends, but you start to hear the Witch Doctor 
chuckle as the sounds turn eerie and sinister from reverberating in his mask.</br>
<br>Wanting to know what was so funny and what this man may have done to you, you walk a bit closer to him as you stare the man behind 
the mask down.</br>
<br>"Why are you laughing and what have you done to me... if anything?!" You ask in a fearful fit.</br>
<br>Slowly, the Witch Doctor takes off his mask an reveals a handsome yet rugged face adorned by a light dusting of facial hair, who grins 
wickedly. "Well... it looks like another has been chosen!"</br>
<br>"Ch... chosen? Chosen for what?" You ask with apprehension, not sure of what he meant.</br>
<br>"Oh yes my new friend... you have been chosen by the gods to be just like me... a werewolf!" The witch doctor said with a deepening 
voice.</br>
<br>Kevin shouted out, "You can't be serious... things like that don't exist!" before you could say anything.</br>
<br>"Well..." the witch doctor started, "... then I guess swirling magical fire doesn't exist. We certainly just saw that happening, now didn't we?" 
The witch doctor said snidely.</br>
<br>Kevin gulped and jiggled the door handle, just to see if the status of it changed, but found it was still the same.</br>
<br>Watching Kevin, the witch doctor grinned. "Oh no my friend, you aren't going anywhere... the three of you will be a part of the pack before 
night's end. You see, our friend over here has been chosen to be a werewolf, but he has also been gifted by the gods to make more. I have 
been trying to make a pack for a very long time, but have been unable because the gods haven't seen me fit to lead!"</br>
<br>"Buh... but why me?" You ask in fear.</br>
<br>"You have the blood of the Alpha coursing in your veins and it is this blood, these genes that allow our kind to spread and propagate." He 
said with a wicked smile, his incisors lengthening to vicious looking fangs.</br>
<br>You look at him with wide, disbelieving eyes, but could not undo or forget what it was that you just saw. You watch as he walks up to you, 
getting closer and closer. You wanted to run, but there was no where to run to and somewhere deep down within you, you knew what he was 
saying made sense. You could feel something deep down within you stir for sometime, even before the events of tonight occurred. Now, you 
could feel it a bit more, as if it were being called upon and clawing its way up through the layers, trying to get to the surface and be whatever it 
was.</br>
<br>As the witch doctor stood very close to you, he breathed in deeply, drawing his nose close to you as if he was trying to smell your scent. 
As he did this, you could feel something in you enjoying what he did as your eyes haze over slightly in a bit of a euphoric stupor. You looked 
on toward your friends who you could see were all scared and you could see their lips moving, begging and pleading with you not to listen to 
the man, but you couldn't hear a single word that was being said. It was just you and the witch doctor now, but you got the feeling that it 
would soon be all of you in one pack. You even contemplated the word in your mind, feeling warm about the idea of a pack, a family and who 
better for that task than your current friends that were trapped with you in that room.</br>
<br>"C'mon out to play my Alpha! I can sense it in you, your desperate need to be free of these shackles of humanity. If you want, I can help 
you free the wolf buried deep down within you. All you need to do is give me the sign!" The witch doctor said seductively in a low sultry tone.
</br>
<br>Before you even realized what you were doing, thinking you weren't doing anything, but actually nodding your head yes slowly, but 
definitively. You watched the witch doctor grin from now pointed ear to pointed ear as he stepped back a few steps while digging in the pouch 
on his right side. As he pulled his hand out of the dark brown leather pouch you noticed that he had a small pile of powder in the cup of his 
palm. Slowly, so not to spill even one granule of powder, the witch doctor brought the pile close to his lips and blew gently. As the powder 
gently wafted to your nose and mouth, the witch doctor spoke again, already slightly further along in his transformation.</br>
<br>"Koon jam ba, koon jam ba, koon jam ba! Bokate whey, bokate whey, neorapsi te ley lu! Quam diena se sena!" Uttered out of his mouth as 
his eyes flashed to a more wolf like amber hue.</br>
<br>Immediately hearing the words uttered, a severe pang of pain washed over your body, forcing you to drop to your knees and bend over so 
your back was parallel to the wooden floor, your hands palms down, bracing your body weight. As that pang subsided, another one hit you 
right after, causing your body to surge as you yelled out in pain. Sounds of bones breaking and popping, muscles and ligaments tearing and 
stretching, your body growing with muscle and power. Another pang washed over you and you yelled out, but this time it didn't sound like a 
cry of anguish, but rather a moan of pleasure. You look up to your friends smiling a devilish and evil smile to make it clear you were enjoying 
everything that you were going through. As you smiled, you felt your gums and jaw begin to ache while you tasted a cool metallic liquid filling 
your mouth. Somewhat knowing what it was, you grinned while you licked over your teeth, feeling the sharp fangs that were now in place of 
your once human bicuspids.</br>
<br>As your friends watch your transformation in muted horror, a few were slack jawed and still not totally believing what they were witness 
to. There, before them, were two men turning into werewolves… creatures that were once thought to exist solely in the movies or the 
imagination of creative writers.</br>
<br>Once again your body surged, your body growing more and more muscle as your new size began to push the seams of your clothing to 
their limits. The muscle that was now on your body was that of a seasoned body builder and still your body continued to grow in size. As you 
began to hear the seams rip, you look at your arms and notice that they were huge and you knew the rest of your body must have looked 
equally as impressive.  Suddenly, a quick cold chill swept over your body, making every pore bump up while the pores that had human hair 
made the hair stand on end. Slowly, you felt your body began to increase with an incredible heat as you watched every pore of your skin 
develop a hair follicle as medium brown fur sprouted everywhere. As the muscle and fur continued to grow and spread, it was far too much for 
the clothing to remain intact and on your body, and your body burst forth from the clothing. As the clothing slowly drifted onto the floor 
beneath you, it was as if you were shedding a very old layer of skin and you were birthed as a new creature. In some ways, you thought to 
yourself, that was exactly what was happening.</br>
<br>Curious about your fellow wolf companion, you look over to the witch doctor and see that he was nearly done with his transformation as 
his face pushed out into a muzzle and his tail grew out rapidly, pushing the loin cloth aside.</br>
<br>Suddenly, a wave of pain centered on your head, causing you to have a splitting headache. As the pain intensified, it felt as if you had a 
severe amount of pressure building up in your cranium and you felt completely to the floor, writhing in agony. Somehow you knew you were 
nearly at the end of your transformation and this pain would end in moments.</br>
<br>Seeing how much pain you were in, the witch doctor who was fully in his wolf form walked over to you on his digigrade hind legs and 
consoled you.</br>
<br> “Don’t fight it my alpha! Let it happen, let the wolf in you be free and we will be able to begin reconstructing our species and our 
civilization. The humans will be at our mercy as it once was, but we need you to make that happen!” The witch doctor said in his deeper, 
animalistic and powerful voice trying to make you relax.</br>
<br>At the end of his words, you tried your best to relax and lo and behold, the pain subsided partially. Just as the pain subsided, you felt 
your ears lengthen and change shape and form, making your hearing intensify ten times what it once was. At the same time, you felt pressure 
behind your whole face, which felt as though it was pushing your skull forward, changing its’ entire shape while allowing your new wolven ears 
to shift to the top of your head. As your face pushed out more and more, becoming more muzzled, the pressure became less and less. As you 
were able to open your eyes finally and look at your friends, they noticed that your eyes were the same amber hue as the witch doctor’s before 
he transformed. While they were looking at you, you looked at them and noticed your new muzzle with your nose being flat, black and moist 
far in front of your face. It was odd, at first, but you knew that it was normal, but it would take a little bit to get used to it. Suddenly, you felt a 
new sensation begin to wash over your body, one that felt very pleasant, euphoric and highly erotic. As the new sensation moved and focused 
on the front and back of your hips, you could feel your penis stir to life just as you felt a protrusion begin to emerge from your body at the 
base of your spine. Slowly but surely, you came to full mast, but it didn’t stop there. Little by little you could feel your once “little” friend slowly 
increase in length and width. At the same time, you felt what you knew was our tail grow out inch by inch till the soft and fully dexterous new 
appendage ended half way up your back just as your now “big” friend finished growing.</br>
<br>As it all seemed to have ended, you begin composing yourself and slowly made your body erect. At first, you were on your new digigrade 
wolf knee with your torso perpendicular to the floor. As you wanted to check your self out, you look down and see your much bigger cock 
throbbing with every beat of your heart. As you looked down at it with a wolfish grin, you guessed that it was at least seven and a half inches in 
length, but a very impressive three to three and a half inches in width. Curious, you reached down and grabbed it with your wolf paw, feeling 
the rough but soft paw pads caress the tender flesh. At first you shuddered from the sensation and you knew that you could have one hell of a 
time if and when you wanted. Having touched it with your more massive paws, you knew that it was at least as thick as a can of soda.</br>
<br>With the witch doctor still close to you, he looked you over and grinned as if he was pleased with his work, even though the only credit he 
knew that he could take was awakening the wolf that was already deep down within you. Then, he cleared his throat and asked, “How do you 
feel… my Alpha?”</br>
<br>You mulled the question over in your mind, repeating the word Alpha in your mind over and over, feeling yourself stir below each time 
you did. You knew the word felt right, it felt powerful and you liked it. Not really knowing what to say back, you just opened your mouth and let 
the words come out naturally, “Good my beta! I am glad to have you be the one to awaken this gift that was locked away in that human body 
for so long!”</br>
<br>The beta witch doctor grinned, “I am glad to have been of service to you! Now… I wonder… what should we do with your friends 
here?”</br>
<br>You look over to them where they all looked so frightened, so terrified, except one of them. To you, one of them seemed as though they 
enjoyed what they saw and you knew that that was the one to become your first transformee. You looked back to the beta and said matter of 
factly, “I am going to do what you were never able to do. I am going to start a pack and it will start with them!”</br>
<br>The beta nodded, smiling the whole time, happy that he was finally going to have the wolf family he had craved for so long. “As the Alpha, 
not only can you infect humans and turn them, but you can make them certain types of wolves.” The beta said informatively.</br>
<br>You looked at the beta, head turned to the side slightly with an inquisitive look and asked “Oh… and what types are there?”</br>
<br>The beta witch doctor placed his broad paw against your back, between your muscular shoulder blades and began explaining. “You see, 
there are numerous types of wolves in a pack. There are Alphas, who are the leaders. Then there are Betas, like myself, who are pretty much 
your second in command, but also your go to wolf for anything and everything you might need. Then there are Omegas, which is the third in 
command, but they are usually lithe and suited for hunting and tracking. If you, as an Alpha, were to die hypothetically… I would become the 
new Alpha as a stand in and the Omega would take my current place. The thing is, once our pack is large enough, I could be challenged and if 
another wolf won, I would step down as Alpha and things would resume as normal. Then there are other roles in the pack as well. There are 
your enforcers, who are like your personal bodyguard, but they are also protectors of the pack as a whole and would die before letting harm 
come to the pack and especially you. They are much more muscled then your average wolf, somewhere in between your size and mine. Then 
there are the hunters, they are more athletic and they are smaller than me, but not quite as small and lithe as an Omega. Then there are the 
trackers, who are very lithe and slender. What they lack in muscle size, they more than make up for it in speed, endurance and agility. Then 
there is one other, a harem and they can be of any size and build, depending on what you like. Their job, as you may have already guessed, is 
to keep the Alpha and all the other wolves sexually satisfied. They live to keep you, above all others, ‘happy’. The enforcers, hunters or trackers 
are never going to be the ones to challenge an Alpha for leadership, as they are loyal to the Alpha no matter what. Anyone that is a Beta, 
Omega or even a Harem (in very rare occasions) will be the ones to challenge you for leadership, but I can also assure you that this will not ever 
happen.” The Beta said matter of factly.</br>
<br>You looked at him quizzically, wondering why he said that. “Why would no wolf challenge me?”</br>
<br>The beta reached out for your paw as you were still kneeling and he wanted you to stand on your feet before the remaining humans. “You 
are what is known as an Elder Alpha. It is a very distinguished role; one that can never be challenged and all wolves know it. You see, my Alpha, 
as an Elder Alpha, you are the one to lead all packs that form from your infectious bite. You are the only Alpha that can make other Alphas, but 
they are all Betas to you. You are the only Alpha that can give wolves the ability to make their own different types of wolves. This alone makes 
you unchallengeable. There can only be one Elder Alpha in existence at any time and it is next to impossible to kill an Elder Alpha… in fact, I 
don’t even know what happened to the last Elder Alpha. There are no records of him being killed or anything… it was as if he just faded 
away.”</br>
<br>You saw the look on his face and it was a look of severe sadness. Standing on your own to hind legs now, you realized just how tall and 
powerfully muscled you were, but decided to tend to your beta. “Why do you look so sad suddenly?”</br>
<br>The beta looked to the floor and you brought a furry digit up under his chin, lifting his head to look him in the eyes. As you saw a 
glimmer in his eyes, the beta spoke again. “He… he was the one who made me so long ago. The Elder Alpha was my lover hundreds of years 
ago.” He said softly.</br>
<br>You looked at him consolingly, piercing deep within his eyes, going deep down into his soul. “So… you and the Elder were mates? What 
happened to him?”</br>
<br>The beta continued to look you in the eyes and you could feel him warming up to you, feeling him attach himself to you as he did with his 
previous mate. “I… I don’t know. We were both human once, several hundreds of years ago, but something happened on a night we were both 
in bed together. I later came to find out that there was a special celestial alignment and it only happened once in several millions of years. That 
night he turned into a werewolf, waking us both out of sleep and we were both terrified by what had happened. I loved him no matter what, I 
told him that too and we made love werewolf to human. Then, some how, he made me into a werewolf too. At that point, we did some very 
heavy research and found out all of the stuff I just told you about. Then, we decided to make a small pack of our own, but he never made 
another Alpha. Those that were in our pack were all we had as a species and I have even kept in touch with the rest of them after the Elder’s 
disappearance. Then, one time when we were going to meet as a pack, he and I went separately because of personal issues that we had to take 
care of separately. That night when we all convened, he… he never showed up. Numerous nights in a row we met, hoping he would return, but 
he never did. Without the Elder or another Alpha, we felt lost and not me or any of the Omegas felt worthy of taking the seat of power since 
there was no other able to make more wolves. Eventually, we decided to live on with the rest of our lives, waiting for him to return or even 
another Elder wolf somehow. Now that you have become an Elder Alpha, I am sure the others will pledge their allegiance to you so we can do 
what we were never able to do before. So, now my Elder Alpha, you must use your friends, the humans, to be the roles we need them to be. 
Since there were only four of you, the three remaining will have to be an enforcer, a hunter and a tracker. I just wonder who will be 
which!”</br>
<br>You smiled wickedly as you slowly walked over to your friends, already knowing that the one that wasn’t afraid would be best suited for 
being an enforcer. As you stood in front of the three, you breathed in deeply, trying to see who was producing what, but since they were so 
close together, you couldn’t tell. Wanting to make this as easily and as quick as possible, you pointed with a clawed digit and moved your 
finger drawing a line, which they quickly formed… afraid of what you might do to them, but one moved a bit more slowly and he was the one 
who you knew was perfect to be your enforcer… but the question remained… who was it?</br></p>
