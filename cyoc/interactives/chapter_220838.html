<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jen spent the next few hours playing fetch with Amber in the side yard. It was good to be back at Chesterton. Home was alright, but it still held relics of her former self that she had yet to get rid of. Chesterton was full of nothing but happiness. The new pads that Betty had given her allowed for much freer movement and, while still slow, Jen was able to crawl much faster than she had before.<br />
<br />
Her new tail proved to be more of a hindrance. After just a few laps it had stimulated her enough that her gait became rather awkward. The remainder of her lunch that had dried on her inner thighs was becoming slick again thanks to the juices flowing from her cunt. Amber laughed when she saw this, then reached down and rubbed Jen&#39;s side. Her hand didn&#39;t take long to wander to Jen&#39;s breast where she tweaked her erect nipple.<br />
<br />
&quot;I see you&#39;re enjoying yourself.&quot; she said. &quot;I can&#39;t really understand it myself. I mean, I understand why people would want to do this, but I never thought of doing it myself. Maybe I&#39;ll give it a try one of these days, just to see what it&#39;s like. Just don&#39;t think I&#39;ll be joining you and Mina in the advanced class. I&#39;ve peeked in on Mina&#39;s training a few times and *that&#39;s* definitely too much for my tastes.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen rolled onto her back so Amber could have better access. She normally wouldn&#39;t act like this, but after after spending so much time as a dog and spending half a day being pleasured and the other half pleasuring others her inhibitions were all but gone. Amber obliged her by rubbing her breasts some more. Jen let out a frustrated whine and wiggled her hips a bit.<br />
<br />
Oh, what&#39;s this?&quot; Amber said in mock surprise. &quot;Does Jen want something more than a belly rub? Huh? Does she?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen whined louder, but Amber stopped rubbing and stood up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry Jen, but it will have to wait until after dinner.&quot;<br />
<br />
She pulled out Jen&#39;s leash and hooked it to the girl&#39;s collar. Jen refused to roll over and walk. She whined again and spread her legs. A few months ago Jen would have been appalled at her own behavior. A few weeks ago she would have been mildly embarrassed. Right now she was too horny to care.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jen, if you don&#39;t get a move on right now then I&#39;ll have to let Betty know that you&#39;re being a bad girl. I&#39;ve seen what kind of punishments she gives Mina for being bad and trust me you don&#39;t want to experience them. It&#39;s dinnertime right now so you need to go and eat. After that I&#39;ll see if I can get Betty to help you out. Okay? Now. Jen, HEEL!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen responded automatically to the command, springing to all fours and scrambling over to Amber&#39;s side like a good dog. As she was lead back into the building she rubbed her slick thighs together and tried to nose Amber&#39;s crotch. She realized that she was behaving exactly like Mina had but her mind was too fogged by lust be bothered by it. She stumbled down the familiar hall to the kennels and back to the one she had spent a month sleeping in.<br />
<br />
She wasn&#39;t surprised to see Mina in her kennel across the way. The redhead didn&#39;t acknowledge her presence at all. She was still blindfolded and wearing headphones. Her face was buried in her water dish as she slurped up the fake cum that filled it. Like Jen her thighs were coated in a layer of juices and leftover lunch, though it seemed much thicker on Mina. The tail-plug in her ass looked to be thicker as well, but Jen didn&#39;t really know how thick her own really was.<br />
<br />
Jen turned to her own kennel and was quite surprised by what she saw there. Surprised enough to lift most of the sexual fog that had been slowing her thoughts that afternoon. The kennel was quite large. It was meant for a really big dog. Jen only counted as a largish dog, so there had been plenty of space for her. Now a second bed had been added and crouched on it was none other than her sister, Emily.<br />
<br />
Emily was, of course, naked. Her hands and knees bore the same training pads that Jen had worn, but these ones had thick cuffs and straps with noticeable locks on them. Her collar was thicker than Jen&#39;s and had a small plastic box on it just below her chin. Her chin and the lower half of her face were locked in a sort of cage. Jen realized that it was a muzzle. Like Jen, her brown hair had been cropped short, but her sparse pubes seemed untouched. They were probably too short to need trimming. Behind the muzzle her face was red with embarrassment, and it became even redder when she saw Jen looking at her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh look, they gave you a friend. Hey, wait.&quot; Amber looked from Jen to Emily and back again. &quot;No way. That&#39;s not your sister is it? They&#39;re boarding you with your sister?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course.&quot; said a familiar voice. &quot;We are limited on space so we&#39;ve had to double up the new students until the other kennels are ready.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen looked up to see Amelia striding down the aisle towards them. She noticed that the other kennels in their row contained more girls. Some were as young as Emily, but most were closer to Jen&#39;s age. They all wore pads and collars. A few of them also wore muzzles. All of them had expressions of varying degrees of embarrassment and discomfort. Amelia stopped in front of Jen&#39;s, and now Emily&#39;s, kennel and surveyed the line of cages.<br />
<br />
&quot;Our new program is even more popular than I could have imagined. Apparently word got around quite quickly thanks to your mother. We already have a waiting list and the governor himself contacted me about potentially working with the courts to make this an alternative to juvie. Not bad, considering we only have you and Mina to use as examples and, well, Mina is a pretty poor one.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen was momentarily confused. She was about to remind Amelia that Kyle was also a graduate when she remembered that, thanks to her curse, Kylie was now just a little bitch and always had been. She grinned at the memory. Of course, she was more than a little worried about Amelia&#39;s plans. Jen&#39;s &quot;success&quot; was really only due to the curse Kyle had placed on her. She wasn&#39;t sure if anyone else would respond to the training like she had.<br />
<br />
Jen heard the rattle of the food cart and turned to see Alice pushing it down the aisle. It was completely full and behind was Betty with a second cart and a gaggle of trainers. They got to work dishing out dinner to the girls.<br />
<br />
&quot;Be careful removing the muzzles!&quot; Betty called out. &quot;If any of them try to bite then use the remotes to discipline them. Yellow should be suitable. Don&#39;t use red unless you have to.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen looked at her sister. So the muzzle was because she tried to bite someone? Emily glared back at her, but the blush still coloring her face diminished the look. Alice filled Emily&#39;s bowl, then unbuckled her muzzle. Emily bared her teeth, but Alice just held up the small remote in her hand and gave the girl a sharp look. Emily winced and focused her attention on her dinner instead. Jen marveled at how quiet she was being. In fact, the whole kennel was far too quiet considering the number of people there. Her unasked question was answered by a small commotion a few yards down.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you expect me to ea- ARGH!&quot;<br />
<br />
One of the older girls who had been muzzled had tried to complain about the food. She was now pawing at her collar and glaring at her trainer. Jen assumed that the trainer had shocked her, but the remote was still hanging from the woman&#39;s belt and her hands were no where near it. Jen wondered if maybe the collars, in addition to being remote controlled, might be similar to bark collars. They would shock you if you tried to talk. A few more quickly silenced complaints seemed to confirm Jen&#39;s suspicions.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm.&quot; Betty said. &quot;It still takes a few seconds to activate. I&#39;ll try to tweak them so they work faster.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen took that to mean she was right. So the new students wore collars to keep them from speaking, and some wore muzzles to keep them from biting. She wondered what other little additions Betty and Amelia had made to the program since she had last been here. She knew that the new pads had locks on them, and that while the collars didn&#39;t, if you tried to take them off they would shock you very hard. Jen reached up and felt her own collar. It didn&#39;t have the shock box like the others. She had already graduated and didn&#39;t need it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jen, come.&quot; Alice said, indicating the open kennel.<br />
<br />
Jen crawled into the kennel and ignored her sister&#39;s renewed glare. Alice grabbed a container off the cart and scooped some of its contents into Jen&#39;s bowl. Jen recognized the usual dinner, but it seemed to have a new ingredient mixed in. A kind of white sauce. She looked at Emily&#39;s still untouched bowl and saw that her dinner was ordinary. She bent down and tasted a mouthful. It was the fake cum. They had mixed some of the fake cum into her food. It actually added to the flavor. She glanced up and saw Alice scoop some into Mina&#39;s bowl as well. So the regular students got regular food, but the &#39;special&#39; students got enhanced food. Jen decided it didn&#39;t matter. She ate her dinner without complaint.<br />
<br />
It took Emily a bit longer to try her dinner, but after a bit of coaxing from Alice she began to eat. From what Jen could hear as she wolfed down her own meal, a few of the other girls were having trouble coming to terms with their new doggy status. There was plenty of grumbling, and a few yelps of pain, while the trainers talked the more reluctant students into eating their dinner so they wouldn&#39;t have to go to bed hungry. There were still one or two holdouts when the lights dimmed. The trainers loaded up the food carts with everything that hadn&#39;t been eaten, replaced muzzles where needed, and left. Only Amelia, Betty, Alice, Amber, and Rita, one of the senior trainers, remained.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright girls!&quot; Amelia called out. &quot;Tomorrow will be your first day of training. I am disappointed that so many refused to eat, but you can make up for it at breakfast after being hungry tonight. Rita will be patrolling throughout the night and I have instructed her to pay extra attention to anyone who steps out of line. In the morning you will be fed and then taken to the yard for some exercise before class starts. Now, get some sleep. Tomorrow is a big day.&quot;<br />
<br />
With that, the women left, Amber blowing Jen a kiss as she went. For a short while there were some more quiet grumbling, and even a few who tried to speak up and make some kind of point. All of them were silenced by their collars before getting too far. After that was a brief bout of rattling as many of the girls tested their kennel doors and one or two thumps as climbers failed to gain any height with their limbs restricted. Silence eventually fell, punctuated by the occasional sob.<br />
<br />
Jen lay down on her bed. It was different from the last time. This one had more padding and was shaped a bit more comfortably. Clearly it had been designed for a human pretending to be a dog rather than an actual dog. She watched as Emily did her own round of grumbling and testing the door before she too went to her bed where she sat glaring at Jen.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jennifer, you stupid bi- URK!&quot; Emily&#39;s whisper was cut off by her collar. It appeared that even a barely audible whisper would trigger it.<br />
<br />
Emily sat and glared at Jen for a while longer. Then she pointedly turned her back and lay down. Jen watched her for a time, but the events of the day had worn her out completely. In minutes her eyes had shut and she wandered into doggy dreams.</p>
