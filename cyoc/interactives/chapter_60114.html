<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">There are 1163 chapters on CYOC concerning werewolves as of this writing (1164 if <br />
you count this one). But if you want a story that is completely true and factual, you <br />
have to read mine. I know a thing or two about werewolves because, frankly, I am <br />
one. Of course, I wasn't always a werewolf. In fact, I have only gotten in touch with my <br />
wild side recently. It was two years ago, on my 18th birthday...<br />
               _______________________________________________________<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, class,&quot; Mr. Neville greeted us, &quot;Back by popular demand is the mythical beasts <br />
lesson. That special time of the year where we screw modern biology over and talk <br />
about the history of your choice of mythical creature.<br />
&quot;So,&quot; he continued while passing out slips of irregularly cut notebook paper, &quot;Write <br />
down your prefered topic and pass it back in. Once everyone has voted, we'll see <br />
which ones got the most votes and take a poll from there.&quot;<br />
<br />
Once all the votes were counted we were given the choice between werewolves, <br />
dragons, or salamanders. <br />
<br />
&quot;A salamander isn't a mythical animal!&quot; protested Ryan Thorton, the football captain. &quot;I <br />
got tons down in the creek by my house!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It means the legendary salamander,&quot; replied an annoyed Thomas Critter, the class <br />
brain. &quot;They were said to have been born in fires and have control over them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Shut up, Crispy Critter!&quot; the jocks yelled. Tom just rolled his eyes. <br />
<br />
After the class voted on the final topic, there was a tie between werewolves and <br />
salamanders (everyone had had enough dragons after that god-awful book in English). <br />
And of course the tie breaker was...<br />
<br />
&quot;Michael, you haven't voted yet,&quot; Mr. Neville addressed me. &quot;Yes, you, Mr. Baka, now <br />
please make your choice.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Werewolves!&quot; the jocks encouraged. <br />
<br />
&quot;Salamanders!&quot; countered the smart girls. <br />
<br />
&quot;Dragons!&quot; urged Tom eliciting a &quot;shut up Crispy Critter&quot; from the jocks. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, Mike,&quot; Mr. Neville asked, &quot;What will it be?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh...werewolves I guess.&quot;<br />
<br />
A collective &quot;yes!&quot; broke out from the jocks and groans came from the girls and Tom. <br />
<br />
&quot;Very well, werewolves it is,&quot; announced Mr. Neville. &quot;Now you will each work with one <br />
partner to complete a posterboard about an incident or legend involving werewolves. <br />
You will give an oral presentation on Monday. And because I talked with your other <br />
teachers, I know you have no other homework over the long weekend so no excuses. <br />
Everybody have a good long weekend, happy Thursday, and I will see you on Monday. <br />
Class dismissed.&quot;<br />
               _______________________________________________________<br />
<br />
I had noticed that no one had partnered with Ashkii Windtalker, the only Navajo kid in <br />
our school. He was a skilled artist and hardly ever talked, but when he did it was <br />
meaningful and wise. He was like the stereotypical Navajo; superstitious, no facial hair, <br />
long, traditional hairstyle. The only thing modern about him was his secondhand store <br />
clothes. He wasn't poor, in fact quite the opposite, but he didn't like the new styles so <br />
he stuck to plain jeans and T-shirts with simple logos and patterns on them.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I'd noticed that no one had wanted to work with him, so I offered to be his <br />
partner. <br />
<br />
&quot;Good choice, Mike,&quot; he answered, &quot;You'll learn more about werewolves by working <br />
with me than anyone else here.&quot; But as I walked away he added, &quot;And Thank You.&quot;<br />
               _______________________________________________________<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; Ashkii began, &quot;Let's get to work.&quot;<br />
<br />
We were at his house in his room which was decked out in all kinds of Navajo trinkets. <br />
It was Friday at 11:00AM and we were there alone. His parents wouldn't be back until <br />
5:00 that evening. Now by &quot;parents&quot; you should know that Ashkii was adopted by a <br />
wealthy white family who, while they loved him to death, were not capable of carrying <br />
out the Navajo traditions that Ashkii had learned before being orphaned at age 8. <br />
Ashkii had come to love them as well as their modern ways, but fiercely retained his <br />
old rituals. <br />
<br />
A posterboard lay out in front of us on the floor. Ashkii had agreed to tell me about the <br />
Navajos' beliefs about werewolves. <br />
<br />
&quot;The Navajos call werewolves 'yeenadlooshi' or skinwalkers. Skinwalkers are extremely <br />
feared creatures that are rumored to steal your skin if you look into their eyes. They <br />
are on a level with witches on the Navajo hatred scale. Now, skinwalkers aren't all <br />
wolves, they can be many different creatures, but the wolf is most common. You can <br />
tell a yeenadlooshi by large, glowing eyes, a black tongue, lack of genitals, and skin as <br />
hard as rock. In some stories, they were completely feral with no thougts but the <br />
animal's instinct while in beast form. In others, they were even smarter than their <br />
human forms and could read minds as well as mimic the voices of a person's loved <br />
ones in order to draw them out.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow,&quot; I gaped as Ashkii paused for breath, &quot;That's amazing how their werewolves <br />
had all these powers. Ours just run around ripping people apart.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mmhmm, but some of these aren't true. I've done a lot of study on yeenadlooshi and <br />
have found some things to be fact and others fiction. For one, they don't steal your <br />
skin by looking you in the eyes. Another mistake is the feral stories. They were <br />
completely intelligent in beast form.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hold on,&quot; I questioned, &quot;What do you mean 'mistakes' they're just legends, all of it's <br />
fake. There aren't any rights or wrongs.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I was just about to explain that,&quot; the Navajo teen answered, &quot;But what I'm about to tell <br />
and show you is deep Navajo secret. You can't tell anyone and this can't go into the <br />
report. Okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, alright..&quot; I replied, taken aback. Did Ashkii really trust me enough to show me a <br />
secret from his culture? What would it be? Artifacts, a story, pictures, what?<br />
<br />
But he didn't produce any object or speak. He got up, walked slowly to the window, <br />
closed the blinds and looked between the slots. The room was much darker without <br />
the sun. <br />
<br />
Suddenly, Ashkii spoke. But it didn't sound like him. His voice was that of my older <br />
brother, John. <br />
<br />
&quot;It's not going to be an artifact, Mike, and the story is only for explanation. I already <br />
locked the door as we came in, so don't bother running.&quot;<br />
<br />
What?!<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't worry, I won't hurt you. I'm just assuring that you don't go running down the <br />
street yelling the secret.&quot;<br />
<br />
Oh, okay.<br />
<br />
&quot;Glad you're okay with that.&quot;<br />
<br />
This is freaky, it's like he's...<br />
<br />
&quot;...Reading my mind,&quot; me and Ashkii said aloud at the same time. <br />
<br />
As the truth dawned on me, I started to notice his changes beginning. He started to <br />
hunch over a bit, but instead of shortening, he grew from 5'10&quot; to almost 7' hitting his <br />
head off the ceiling. His body, previously smooth and hairless, was quickly covered by <br />
his black hair, no, fur. His head erupted outwards and quickly became that of a wolf. <br />
While his body became feral and muscular. His arms lengthened to the length of his <br />
legs, allowing him to walk on all fours. Claws formed on his digitgrade paws while a <br />
bushy tail popped out above his rear. His growth spurt had ripped off his clothes <br />
except for his straining underwear and I could see every change on his body. He <br />
grunted primevally as his underwear ripped as well. <br />
<br />
&quot;I'll give you a hint as to the last mistake I left out,&quot; he joked as his furry sack dropped <br />
down holding two melons. His human equipment grew proportionately before being <br />
sucked into his sheath. <br />
<br />
Finally, the skinwalker stood complete in front of me. <br />
<br />
&quot;So, how do you like it?&quot; Ashkii asked. <br />
<br />
Truthfully, I was surprised I hadn't fainted or something. I was completely scared. But <br />
something about his voice (back to his own) kept me sane. I could tell I was talking to <br />
a coherent creature, not a mindless beast. Ashkii approached me. <br />
<br />
&quot;You know, Mike,&quot; he said, &quot;I've always thought you were someone I could trust. I'm <br />
glad that's true.&quot;<br />
<br />
But despite his friendly words, his closer position revealed his razor sharp claws and <br />
teeth. Yep, that did it...<br />
               _______________________________________________________<br />
