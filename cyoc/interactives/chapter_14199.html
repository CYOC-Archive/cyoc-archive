<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Andrew punched in the number for the pizza place on his cell and ordered three extra large pizzas.  One combo, one meat lovers and one vegetarian as he liked a variety and he knew it wouldn't go to waste in this house.  He looked at the two jars, trying to decide what he wanted to do first.  <br />
<br />
The directions were a bit vague on the ointment that was supposed to make Andrew less 'skinny'.  All the old man had said about it was, 'Put on your skin'.  Andrew thought that perhaps mixing the two wouldn't be the best idea.  He decided he'd take his shirt off and rub the 'bigger' ointment on his chest and arms and since he was wearing shorts, legs.  Then he'd put the 'hair growth' ointment on his chin.  He decided to wait until the pizza got here before stripping down to just his shorts.<br />
<br />
Twenty minutes later Andrew had paid for the pizza and was ready for the ointment.  He put the pizzas on the coffee table and decided to use the hair growth formula first.<br />
<br />
He took one of the pizza napkins and dabbed a good portion on it and then applied it to his chin, just as the old man had said.  When he realized he'd gotten what he thought to be too much on his chin, he wiped the excess off with the other end of the napkin.  Andrew felt a tingling on his chin that moved up his face and down his neck where a beard would normally grow, he hoped that this meant the formula was working.  He went to the bathroom and looked at himself in the mirror.  No obvious changes yet, but then some things need time to work.  Andrew, with the napkin still in hand went back to the sofa.  He sat down and had a couple of slices of pizza and his soda.  He set the used napkin on the edge of the table and then picked up the 'bigger' ointment.  Andrew thought about what bigger might mean.  Did it mean he would gain weight in fat or muscle or both?  Well, the old man was pretty nice and he felt the guy had the best intentions for him so he took his shirt off and scooped out a small portion of the 'bigger' ointment.  He rubbed it in his hands, emulsifying it slightly.  It had a faint ginger and jasmine scent which was much different than the almost odorless hair ointment.  The ointment on his hands felt warm.  He began rubbing it first on his hairless chest and moved down his arms from his neck and shoulders.  The ointment he'd taken out was used at that point so he scooped out a little more and emulsified it as before and rubbed his legs.  Thinking that perhaps this was a growth formula the might help him in more ways than one, he stuck his hands into his shorts and rubbed the last of it on his cock and balls.  He took out just a little more of the ointment, emulsified it and rubbed as much of his back as he could reach.  With excess on his hands, he wiped it on another napkin and set it next to the hair growth napkin.<br />
<br />
Andrew was pleasantly warm all over from the ointment and the light scent relaxed him better than any aromatherapy could.  Andrew decided that ingesting this stuff might not be good, so he went to the bathroom and thoroughly washed his hands before returning to finish his pizza.  Andrew found he was very hungry now.  Before he knew it, he'd devoured the combo and half of the meat lovers pizza.<br />
<br />
He finished what he'd put on his plate and was taking the empty pizza box to the trash when he knocked over his soda.  There wasn't much, so he sopped up the spill on the coffee table with the remaining used napkins and took those to the trash too.  He left the other pizza and a half on the table for his dad and feeling tired, Andrew locked the doors, gathered up the ointments and went upstairs to go to bed.  Andrew's face itched a little and he went into the bathroom to see if the ointment had done anything for him.  He looked in the mirror and lo and behold!  He had five o'clock shadow that looked as heavy as his dads where his dad shaved.  Dad shaved his upper cheeks and neck, but left the rest grow into a thick, luxurious beard.  Andrew examined his new beard; it went from just under his eyes down his cheeks and chin, on his upper lip and then on his neck to the collar line.  Andrew was sure that tomorrow he'd have to shave his hair had grown so thick and so fast.  He looked at his chest and saw two or three new hairs sprouting that weren't there when he came in this evening.<br />
<br />
Andrew felt really sleepy and the warmth of the 'bigger' ointment felt like it went from his skin all the way to his bones.<br />
<br />
Andrew brushed his teeth and went to bed.<br />
<br />
Two hours later, Andrew's dad Butch came home.  He'd missed dinner so seeing the pizza his mouth watered.  Butch worked for a construction company and was big, burly and of course, full bearded.  He'd just finished doing some overtime and was sweaty and grungy.  He picked up the pizza napkin with the 'bigger' ointment on it and rubbed the back of his hairy neck, his arms and his chest, through his opened flannel.  Feeling a little less sweaty and grungy, he opened up the pizza boxes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Damn!&quot;  he said in a deep baritone, &quot;Andrew must be hitting a growth spurt!&quot;<br />
<br />
He went to the fridge and got a couple of beers, sat down and had some pizza.  His arms, neck and chest felt comfortably warm and he was feeling more relaxed than he could remember in a long time.  He turned the tube on and watched a little Playboy while he drank his beer and had pizza.  Some of the beer spilled over his chin as he missed his mouth while watching a particularly large breasted woman get ploughed by some skinny guy.  He picked up the napkin with the hairy ointment and wiped his chin, mouth and neck.  He felt a bit warm and wiped the sweat from his arms and chest as well, then wadded up the napkin and tossed it in the empty pizza box.  He too had devoured the other half of the meat lovers and the entire vegetarian pizza and now he was sleepy.<br />
<br />
He drank the other beer and was thinking about getting up to bed, when he nodded off on the sofa, scratching absently at his beard as he did so.<br />
<br />
The next morning at seven Andrew's alarm went off...</p>
