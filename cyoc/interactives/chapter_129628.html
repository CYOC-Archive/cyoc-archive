<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">To put it simply, Ethan was your slightly above average guy. Decent looking, with a nice toned but not overly muscular body. A little body hair, a slightly above average cock, and a good job as a nurse at a local Hospital.<br />
At 29 years old, he was very happy with his life. He had a good wage, a few close friends and no major cares in the world.<br />
<br />
He had decided to spend his weekend away from work in a casual, relaxed way. So Saturday lunchtime was spent in a small cafe in London St James&#39;s Park, followed by a walk whilst playing Pokemon Go.<br />
<br />
Ethan had not been paying much attention to where he was walking, the sound of the fountains and crowds of people had faded a while ago, and now he walked a path which was less well kept, cans and packets littered the poorly kept hedges, and the pavement was cracked with weeds poking through. This was fine, he felt he was perfectly safe, he occasional jogger passed him, and a group of teenage girls had just walked passed as well, it was a quieter, but still frequently used area. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, fuck&quot; he gasped, his phone falling to the floor as he stumbled backwards, having walked into something tall and firm, his forehead smacking into the mans chin hard.. He looked up and saw a man standing before him, a foot taller than he was, and broader but only by a little. The man looked to be in his mid-forties, and was well dressed in black trousers and a white shirt. &quot;Sorry! Sorry that was me, distracted&quot; Ethan apologised, picking up his phone and groaned a little.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s quite alright, is your phone okay Ethan?&quot; the man asked, looking politely concerned. &quot;Nah...Screen is smashed to pieces and the buttons don&#39;t....how do you know my name?&quot; Ethan asked, looking up at the man suddenly, his damaged phone all but forgotten.<br />
<br />
The man grinned &quot;Conrad Version...you assisted me with a vasectomy last week...oh but you only ever see me with scrubs and a mask&quot; He chuckled. Ethans fear faded away &quot;Oh! Yes I didn&#39;t recognise you, I am so sorry!&quot; he laughed as well.<br />
<br />
&quot;No problem, sorry about your phone, and it seems that bump on the head was a bit hard too, come sit&quot; he said, taking Ethans shoulder and directed him to a weak looking park bench.&quot;I think I am...okay&quot; Ethan said, allowing himself to be steered towards the bench and sat.<br />
<br />
&quot;Best to be safe...Old habit from my days as a Nurse, much like yourself!&quot; The Doctor smiled and crouched down, looking at the small red bump &quot;Seems my chin is harder than your head&quot; he chuckled, &quot;Shouldn&#39;t bruise though&quot; he noted, then moved his gaze down to Ethans eye level.<br />
<br />
&quot;Blink three times for me...look left, right, up...and down...good, very good, look straight ahead...over my left shoulder...no left shoulder...that&#39;s it...good&quot; The Doctor said, smiling the whole time. &quot;Any pain? And strange sensations?&quot; he asked.<br />
<br />
Ethan frowned, he followed all the usual checks for concussion, which he felt was unnecessary, it was a mild bump on the head &quot;No, I&#39;m fine&quot; he said, blinking to clear his vision. &quot;uh...I think&quot; he added, using his hand to rub his eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm, blurred vision? It&#39;s alright, lay back on the bench for me...there we go. Close your eyes for a moment...yes good&quot; The Doctor said soothingly. &quot;now, just let me feel around, see if I missed anything&quot; came Dr Versions soothing voice. Ethan flinched briefly as fingers began to gently caress his forehead, checking for bumps or cuts no doubt. <br />
<br />
Ethan lay there, embarrassed that someone from work was having to do this for him. Still, he answered all of the questions put to him. &quot;Really..I&#39;m okay, I&#39;m 29 years old...just a bump on the head, No I live alone....It&#39;ll pass in a moment, I&#39;ve not drank anything for a while and it is hot out, No girlfriend, we broke up six months ago....its Saturday...Pokemon Go...Phone broke&quot; he murmured.<br />
<br />
Doctor Version smiled to himself, he was standing now, no longer touching Ethan, just asking questions. &quot;Good, Ethan, you have a sever concussion, you know this to be true, your medical training tells you that you need my assistance&quot; He said soothingly. &quot;You will stand and follow me, I am a friend from work, I am here to help you, do as I say and you will be perfectly fine&quot;<br />
<br />
Ethan slowly sat up, trembling all over, looking pale &quot;I...so sorry, my head....Can...Can you help me home?&quot; he asked, his words filled with effort. Ethan found himself being helped to his feet. The Doctor said that his car was not far away, and that Ethan would accompany him back to The Doctors home first.<br />
<br />
After that, things were very fuzzy. Ethan was pretty sure he remembered being in the car, sat in the front seat whilst the Doctor spoke and the radio played some unknown music. <br />
<br />
Ethan sat upright, sweating and pale, looking around himself. He was wearing only the shorts he had on earlier that day, and was in an unknown bed, in an unknown room. &quot;H..Hello? Hello?!&quot; he called, his voice shaking with confusion and fear.  The memories of what had happened earlier that day began to filter through his mind, just as the bedroom door opened.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ethan! It&#39;s okay, calm...Remember me? It&#39;s alright, you passed out for a few minutes...nice and easy, you had a nasty bump on the head&quot; The Doctor said soothingly, walking over to the bed.<br />
<br />
&quot;I...I ran into you...my head hurt a little but...I...Yea I am fine now...Perhaps heat stroke? I do not think it was a concussion&quot; Ethan said slowly, pulling the covered up over his chest as he sat up right. <br />
<br />
The Doctor smiled down at Ethan, standing next to the bed. &quot;No, you are quite right Ethan, you did not have a Concussion&quot; the Doctor nodded. &quot;It was a very simple, rather crude form of Hypnotic Suggestion, I simply needed to get you to agree to come back to my house&quot; he gestured around him. &quot;Now you are here, there is no need for me to lie. You see, ever since you joined the Hospital, I have wanted you. Now, do not get a big head, you are attractive enough yes, but I wanted you for your potential!&quot; The Doctor grinned, leaning closer. &quot;I have arranged for a death certificate to be issued in your name, your body was left to medical science, how generous of you&quot;<br />
<br />
Ethan stared up at the Doctor, a horrible, gut wrenching sensation coming over him. &quot;W..What? What are you...I don&#39;t understand....I need to get home&quot; he said, swiftly standing up and pushed past the Doctor, heading quickly for the door. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ethan, you are paralysed from the waist down.&quot; Doctor Version said with a cold smile.<br />
<br />
Ethan instantly fell to the floor, his legs would not move, he couldn&#39;t feel anything below his waist! &quot;What the...no...no how..how have you...Doctor please! What are you doing?!&quot; He yelled, turning onto his back and pushed himself into a sitting position, tears streaking his cheeks. <br />
<br />
&quot;I have spent three days programming you...oh yes, three days...we met in the past three days ago, since then you have been here and now...now you are ready....I have full and total control over your mind and body....and I have so much planned...&quot; The Doctor smirked darkly, walking over to Ethan.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t believe me?&quot; he asked, the friendly tone replaced with a cold, mocking one. &quot;Hm, Ethan, you are unable to breath&quot;<br />
<br />
It felt as though an invisible hand had clamped over his mouth and nose. Despite how hard he tried, he was unable to draw breath. Ethans hand groped at his mouth and throat, searching for the cause of his asphyxiation, to no avail. <br />
In desperation, he rolled over and pulled himself with his arms towards the Doctor, his eyes red, his face a light shade of purple.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, you believe me now? Very well, Ethan, your breathing returns to normal.&quot; The Doctor chuckled lightly.<br />
<br />
Ethan lay on the floor, panting harshly, drool running down his chin, his useless legs splayed out behind him. He felt a hand on his chin as his head was tilted up.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can do that when ever I wish...I can do anything at all...I can even command your heart to stop...so, you had better behave...&quot; The Doctor smirked, looking down at the man on the floor, still gasping for breath, legs currently useless.<br />
<br />
