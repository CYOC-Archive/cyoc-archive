<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">His dreams were a jumbled mess except one that stood out. He was walking through the house, going upstairs, heading toward his room, the room he shared with Angela. Somewhere behind him, he could hear his mother saying something and figuring she was talking on the phone he ignored her. Stepping into the shared bedroom, Jeff looked at the room before him, feeling comfortable with how girly everything looked. He didn't know how he knew, but he knew that he was wearing a skirt that stopped just shy of his knees, a white t-shirt with a rainbow-coloured zebra on the front and a pair of slip-on shoes.<br />
<br />
Moving into the room, Jeff settled down on the floor and began playing with some of the dollies, knowing that they were his and that he shouldn't touch Angela's dollies unless she was here. A leotard caught his attention and knowing that it was his, Jeff suddenly wanted to play dress. <br />
<br />
For a moment, he felt conflicted because of thoughts that said he normally did this with Angela. But than he decided that this time it would be okay to play by himself and that if his sister turned up, he would invite her to join him. Standing, he started to reach for the leotard, but stopped when a strange feeling came over his stomach and thinking he was going to be sick, he turned to run for the bathroom, but stopped as the strange feeling grew and sank down past his stomach and into his abdomen and groin, where it blossomed into a warm sensation that he thought felt like the time he accidentally wet himself.<br />
<br />
Unsure why he was suddenly gripping the hem of his skirt, Jeff danced from one foot to the other and after a moment, lifted the skirt, staring at his penis and testicles, realising that mommy would be upset because he wasn't wearing underwear like a good girl. And, almost as if he blinked, the strange sensation rose and suddenly Jeff's genitals where gone, replaced by smooth flat skin in the front and, somehow he knew, a pinkish-white split between his legs.<br />
<br />
With a start, Jeff snapped open his eyes and found himself staring at really bleary wall. As he blinked, he thought about his dream and than about the previous afternoon and evening and hoped that it had all been a strange dream as well.<br />
<br />
Than he saw that the wall he was staring at was a whitish shade of pink and realising that the events of the latter half of the previous day hadn't been a dream, he silently groaned. Feeling something pressing against him, Jeff glanced down and saw that he had been snuggling up to the purple plush dragon. Pushing the ridiculous looking creature away, he turned over and gazed over at Angela's sleeping form. A yawn escaped him and thinking about going back to sleep, he instead pushed the comforter and sheets off of himself and sat up, hanging his feet over the side of the bed as he did so.<br />
<br />
Glancing down at the pyjamas he was wearing, Jeff suddenly found himself conflicted as one voice in his head stated that they were his because Angela had outgrown them while another said that he had been forced to wear them as a form of punishment. Unsure why he suddenly felt the way he did about the pyjamas, he stood and headed for his dresser, figuring that he was starting to lose it.<br />
<br />
As he took a pair of pink bib-overalls, a white short sleeve shirt with a large, glittery silver star on the front and a pair of socks and pair of white cotton panties from the dresser, Angela stirred. Glancing over at her, he thought, &quot;I wonder if she'll play with me today,&quot; finding himself actually looking forward to such an outcome.<br />
<br />
Shutting the dresser drawer he was going through, Jeff again thought that he was really starting to lose it and all this girly stuff was really starting to get to him. Shucking off his pyjamas, he pulled on the underwear and than sat down on his bed to pull on the socks. After he had pulled on the shirt and the bib-overalls, he glanced down and noted that because of how loose they were, something that surprised him, he could hardly even see any bulge that hinted at the fact that he had a set of boy parts. Unsure how he felt about such a fact, Jeff reached for the purple plush dragon and cuddling it close, he just stood next to his bed for a moment, trying to gather his wits.<br />
<br />
When Angela stirred again Jeff felt sure that his sister was definitely waking up and desperately wanting to ask if she would play with him, Jeff stood and exited the room as quickly as he could, still cuddling the plush animal. Downstairs he found his mother was already up and sitting down at the table, he placed the dragon on a chair next to him as his mother set a bowl, spoon and box of cereal before him, telling, &quot;Don't make a mess,&quot; as she sat back down in the chair she had been sitting in when Jeff had come in.<br />
<br />
Nodding, telling her, &quot;Yes, mommy,&quot; Jeff began to pour himself some cereal and reaching for the pitcher in the centre of the table, almost knocking the box of cereal over in the process, he splashed some milk on and began to eat.<br />
<br />
As he ate his breakfast, his feet and legs swinging slowly back and forth, Jeff thought about how the girly things he had been confronted with was possibly affecting him and telling himself, &quot;It's only Saturday. Just get through Sunday and Monday and you can put all of this behind you,&quot; he watched as Angela came in, still wearing her nightgown and holding a plush bunny she called Crisps.<br />
<br />
Staring at the white nightdress with the picture of a unicorn on the front, Jeff suddenly wanted to ask his mommy for one just like Angela had. About to ask her, he immediately realised what it was he was about say and grabbing the purple plush dragon off of the other chair, he began to cuddle to stuffed animal as he hastily finished his breakfast. Afterward, as he took his bowl and spoon into the kitchen, still clutching the dragon, Jeff absently glanced at the calendar his mother kept pinned on the bulletin board, placed his dishes in the sink and was about to leave when he stopped and looked back at the calendar.<br />
<br />
At first he noted that none of what he was seeing made sense, almost as if he had forgotten how to read a calendar. Than it all came back to him and what he saw didn't make sense as about three fourths of the days of June were crossed out and that, according to the calendar, it was actually a Wednesday.<br />
<br />
&quot;That can't be right,&quot; Jeff thought and reaching up, holding his dragon in one hand, he flipped the calendar back to may, noting that it should be the last day in May, a Saturday, but that all the days of the previous month had been crossed out, like his mommy normally did. Letting go of the calendar, Jeff turned away, confused, wondering if maybe something had gone wrong with his mind and somehow he had blacked out nearly a whole month, &quot;Maybe because I didn't want to face being dressed as a girl,&quot; he thought to himself.<br />
<br />
But this didn't seem right to Jeff as he decided he would have certainly remembered being forced to act like a girl any longer than the original couple days his mother said he would have to. Clutching his purple, plush dragon close, unaware that he was cradling it in a motherly fashion, Jeff headed back to the dining room and looking at his mother, he was about to ask her what the date was when Angela asked, &quot;Can Jenny and I play outside in the sprinkler?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe a bit later,&quot; their mother told her as she looked at Jeff and said, &quot;Go and get your brush, sweetie.&quot;<br />
<br />
Unsure what she was talking about, Jeff found himself on autopilot as he returned to the shared bedroom and fetched a brush off of his dresser. Returning to the dining room, he was immediately told to turn around and doing so he felt mother slowly begin to pull the brush through his hair, which he thought was a bit longer, but couldn't exactly prove how he knew it.<br />
<br />
Afterward, mother gave a peck on the cheek and told him, &quot;Put your brush away and than you can watch the telly, if you want.&quot;<br />
<br />
Doing as she said, Jeff thought about how she hadn't let him watch what he wanted the previous evening and that it had been Angela choosing the programmes they watched. Putting the brush back on top of his dresser, Jeff hugged his dragon even closer to his body and for the first time in his life, he wanted to stick his thumb in his mouth and suck on it.<br />
<br />
But the moment he thought about doing such a thing, the voice of his mommy suddenly came to him, telling him that only babies did that. Unsure when he had been told such a thing, sure that he had never once sucked his thumb in all ten years of his life, Jeff decided that what he need was some fresh air and heading back downstairs, he asked mommy, &quot;Can I play outside?&quot; to which she immediately replied, &quot;Yes, but only if Angela is out there with you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Noting that his sister was pretty much done with her breakfast, Jeff suddenly whined out, &quot;Hurry up.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't act like that,&quot; their mother immediately told him as Jeff tried to think as to why he suddenly said something like that it Angela, &quot;Especially as it made me sound like a little girl,&quot; he thought.<br />
<br />
But for some reason, the fact that he had sounded like a little girl didn't really bother Jeff as he silently wished for his sister to finish with her breakfast. After she done just that, gotten dressed, Jeff hurried outside with Angela following and when she began to suggest things they could do together, Jeff began to either agree or make his own suggestions, unaware that anything at moment was off and wouldn't give another thought to how girly he was acting until after lunch.</p>
