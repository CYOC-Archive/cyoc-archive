<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;There&#39;s not enough car seats for the both of you... well, this is a bit of a problem, now isn&#39;t it?&quot; said Stacy.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wanna ride in Mommy&#39;s lap!&quot; proclaimed Jim. After their nap, the mental changes were starting to be a bit more noticeable, Stacy observed. They could still speak largely coherently, but ever more baby-ish words were pervading their language and thoughts. Soon, with enough breast milk, pacifiers, and naps, they wouldn&#39;t be any different from actual babies--or so the witch doctor had promised Stacy when she had visited them a month ago.<br />
<br />
&quot;What we doing, Mommy?&quot; asked Mikey. His speech was already starting to be more affected given he had 24 hours on Jim, give or take a few hours.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, Mommy was going to take her two little monsters to see the doctor with her... but it looks like I can only take one of you.&quot; Jim HAD supposed to buy two car seats--she had told him, one for each of their vehicles, since she was going to have to start driving Mike&#39;s car for him. But apparently, Jim&#39;s adult stinginess had outweighed her ask.<br />
<br />
&quot;I stay home. I take care of me!&quot; offered Mikey immediately as if he had something to prove by offering first.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wanna stay with Mommy,&quot; cooed Jim as he gripped tighter to her neck and laid his head down on top of her breast. And that&#39;s when an idea popped into her head. She still had an hour or so before she definitely had to leave--would an hour be enough? It&#39;d have to be.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry Jim, Mommy won&#39;t leave you by yourself... not for a long time,&quot; assured Stacy, which caused an odd look to pass across Jim&#39;s face momentarially before it seemed the toddler in him won out and he smiled and nuzzled his head against her bosom.<br />
<br />
&quot;I big boy! I stay!&quot; said Mikey gleefully.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re going back upstairs for now so you can play, Mikey. I think Jimmy needs Mommy for a minute,&quot; said Stacy as she led her two boys back up to their shared apartment.<br />
<br />
Upstairs she let Mikey toddle off where he liked, while Jim she took to their bedroom.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s wrong Mommy?&quot; asked Jim rather innocently as she laid him on the bed and began to undress him to prepare him for what would come next. Stacy hoped that the witch doctor hadn&#39;t been exaggerating the effects of their product when they&#39;d sold it to her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nothing&#39;s wrong, Jimmy,&quot; said Stacy as she took out the jar which contained the jelly that could easily have been mistaken for vaseline to the undiscerning eye. The jelly which she&#39;d spread on both Mike and Jim as they had slept to turn them into toddlers to begin with, and the same jelly that she&#39;d rubbed onto them as they had breastfed from her earlier and caused them to lose 6-8 months.<br />
<br />
Jim didn&#39;t seem to buy her assurance that all was fine, so Stacy distracted him by taking off her top and her bra--allowing Jim to be distracted by the sight of her breasts which had refilled rather quickly since she&#39;d uncovered the jar&#39;s lid.<br />
<br />
&quot;Time for lunch, Jimmy,&quot; said Stacy as she picked up and cradled Jim in her arms and brought him up to one of her breasts. With one hand she helped him latch--his eyes still looking suspiciously up at her until he&#39;d started to swallow the milk at which point he&#39;d closed his eyes and Stacy knew it was now or never. With her other hand, she dipped her free fingers into the jelly and then started to stroke it down Jimmy&#39;s naked body, beginning the process once again. Slowly with each stroke, Stacy wiped another few weeks off of Jimmy&#39;s life and he shrank to smaller and smaller sizes become more adorable and helpless as he needed her support more and more to stay latched onto her breast until he was only a tiny newborn, held gently in her arms, his eyes closed and his skin red and slick from the amount of jelly put on it.<br />
<br />
Stacy set Jimmy down, wrapping him in a now comically oversized diaper as he let his bladder go for what would likely be the last time for a while. Stacy then strained to remember what the witch doctor had said to do next before figuring that she might as well go for it. She stripped completely naked and took a small glob of the jelly and applied it to her currently wet folds--excited from the thought of what was about to happen--if all went well. She massaged in the jelly and felt her labia and cervix grow--extending slightly, reading themselves for what would come next. After the growth in her privates, Stacy took another glob of the jelly and applied it to Jimmy&#39;s newborn belly button--the jelly fusing together and growing pliable like clay until it molded into a fleshy tube that connected to Jimmy through what had been his belly button--a tube which needed somewhere to go--and where she fed it was her engorged vagina. Slowly she eased it in, the inner muscles slowly allowing and pressying the umbilical cord up through the vaginal canal, past the cervix and up into her uterus where it attached. The moment it attached Stacy felt odd as she began to feel Jimmy as part of her as she breathed for him and he stopped breathing. It was then the cord started to pull, and Stacy knew she would have to lay down and open herself up to accept Jimmy. It felt like a slow arduous process, but in truth it was less than five minutes before Stacy felt Jimmy&#39;s feet enter her, followed by his pudgy legs and hips, and then his arms and abdomen, until at long last she felt herself stretching to accept his shoulders and head, until at long last there was a pop and Jimmy was engulfed in Stacy&#39;s uterus. She panted as she felt her belly extended beyond the flat shape she had kept before. Stretch marks creased the side of her belly--but Stacy knew that Jimmy couldn&#39;t stay that old--there&#39;d be questions if Stacy had gone overnight from not showing to full nine months pregnant after all.<br />
<br />
And so, Stacy reached over, grabed a glob of jelly and started to rub her belly. As she did, she felt as though her stomach were an air balloon, slowly seeping out air as it deflated a few weeks with every stroke and Jimmy grew younger within her body. At first he had seemed rather active, kicking once fully engulfed by her body, but slowly those kicks weakened and grew less frequent the smaller and more undeveloped he became. Stacy felt bad for the man that had been her husband for a brief moment--before remembering this was technically his own fault forgetting to buy a second car seat. Instead of being an older brother to his baby, he&#39;d instead be its twin.<br />
<br />
Stacy stopped when she felt her body return to the level of pregnancy she&#39;d approximately felt earlier--maybe a tiny bit further along than earlier she reflected, as her clothes felt a tad more snug than they had before shrinking Jimmy.<br />
<br />
This just left Mikey as her twenty-six month old toddler baby boy... a bit bigger of an age gap than she had wanted--but one that wasn&#39;t fixable with the jelly.</p>
