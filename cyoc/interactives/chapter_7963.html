<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Professor Fuller stood up with both the surprise and horror of seeing another person enter the animal kingdom against their will. Jean stood there holding out her arms and hands, sleeves rolled up to the elbow. As she turned her hands over this way and that he could see the beginning of reddish brown hair.<br />
<br />
Finger nails black as sin, the slender hands of the concert Piano player were never to touch the keys again. He stared at her hands and arms then looking her in the face he almost gasp.<br />
<br />
Even without her knowing it her ears had grown out. Now pointed and long they flopped about loosely, but soon to be stiffer and able to wiggle on command. A curving growth of fuzzy hair was sprouting from her forehead to the bridge of that cute nose.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jean I don't know what to say!&quot; said Professor Fuller. &quot;How did this happen upon you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Happen, happen! I'll tell you that just a few hours ago Scott asked me to lunch. I came here to meet him and when I got here he was almost looking like a Greek satyr. He could not explain this change and as he stood there I felt a strange drawing feeling. He'd stare into my eyes and I was somehow captured, I could not move, I could not deny him anything he asked! He told me to kneel down and I did! He ordered me to accept his penis or by then his red cock into my mouth. I was driven to obey, I felt my will drawn by some power to do his every bidding. Then like some orgy from the myths of Greece I sucked his cock till he exploded into my mouth. I choked down the volume of salty cum and the globs of sticky semen which flowed and flowed. As he were in sexual orgy we fell over and rolled around into that filthy crate some animal was shipped here in. It was during that wild few minutes that something came over me, doing this!&quot; said Jean.<br />
<br />
&quot;What can I do?&quot; asked Professor Fuller.<br />
<br />
Jean stood silent as her eyes blinked shut very slowly. Once, twice, three times and more as the Professor watched. Like she was wrapping him in the same trance Scott bound her to him, so she worked her ways of the Professor.<br />
<br />
Stepping into the yard office she came to within inches of the Professor. Face to face, nose to nose they stood the curse of that bestial crate welled inside Jean and she obeyed it as the Professor must now obey Jean.<br />
<br />
Jeans face was in rapid change with hair sprouting quickly and growing in length. Her eyes changed color to a golden yellow as she stretched her blackening lips to make an evil grin. Her eyes cut deep into the Professor's soul taking him into the bestial blood lust for sexual entanglements.<br />
<br />
As her nimble fingers worked buttons on his clothes her deep guided will made the Professor undo her useless clothing. Jean's need for clothing as was Scott's had only the thought of being rid of the binding feeling and be free to feel and move as the beasts.<br />
<br />
Jean stood almost equal in height to the Professor when she walked in, but as she changed she grew taller. The rapture of sexual need made the change run at top speed. Shaggy wool of the Mountain Goat type sprang quickly as she held the Professor's head in her now fast changing hands.<br />
<br />
Minutes became an hour and then longer yet as Jean's increasing bestial lusts held the Professor to do her every desire. Telling her prey to move and do she urged the religious man to kiss, then suck her shrinking breasts. As her chest became strong of muscle made for running and galloping over the cliffs and crags a pair of furry teats clung to a filling udder made her press the man to his knees.<br />
<br />
Slurping like a young kid with it's mother goat the Professor niggled at the teats. His lips and mouth covered in her sweet and rich with cream milk he worked at the teats like his life depended on it.<br />
<br />
&quot;FULLER, FULLER, stop man stop!&quot; said Professor Simmons as he was suddenly standing in the doorway to the yard office.<br />
<br />
One hand on the Medallion and the other he reached out to touch Jean's almost total goat like shoulder. &quot;Medallion, make this one the nanny goat of the Great American Rockies!&quot; ordered professor Simmons. <br />
Even as he said it he gave a shove with his foot to Professor Fuller's chest making him fall free of the sucking and teats.<br />
<br />
A thud to the floor the man suddenly was broken free of the bestial trance. He looked in terror at what for the last hour or more he'd been making love to in pure delight.<br />
<br />
&quot;Simmons, my God man you saved me from her!&quot; said Myron Fuller.<br />
<br />
As the Medallion glowed brightly Jean Mulder screamed. The new and greater curse moved over and through her form as a wild fire burns dry grass.<br />
<br />
Jean fell forward and hit the floor on forelegs and cloven hooves. She looked up at Professor Simmons in the same way Scott did when he was in a losing battle to keep his human memory. A half scream rolled into a true goat's bleat as her mind degraded and memories faded into instinctive patterns of movement.<br />
<br />
Turning the now white shaggy haired goat wandered outside to graze on the tall weeds in the yard office area. Simmons, holding the Medallion in a death grip turned to watch the animal and then turned to look at his college.<br />
<br />
Offering Myron a hand up he found to be a mistake as the disturbed man still dripping of goat's milk got up and hit Professor Simmons in the jaw. <br />
<br />
&quot;You, not the crate but you and that damned Medallion has caused all this pain and loss! I.........&quot; Myron was cut short as Professor Simmons now sitting on the floor scowled at him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Care, take care my friend less the Rocky Mountain nanny have a mate!&quot; said Simmons.<br />
<br />
Myron looked down at Simmons and prepared to hit him as he got up. As he took a second swing at Simmons his fist skidded past the chin. Myron fell forward and spun around to strike again. Simmons again side stepped the attack.<br />
<br />
&quot;You won't listen will you Myron Fuller, then the Medallion will speak for me!&quot; said Simmons now angry.<br />
<br />
&quot;Listen, it is you who can't listen to those cries of mercy! You my old friend are more held by that evil thing than those you wished into animal form. I would never believe that with all you've done thus far that I would remain as a man. Once your evil mind decided I<br />
was a threat you'd make me to join the realm of animals too!&quot; explained Myron now beginning to shake of anger and fear of what might come.<br />
<br />
Simmons stood there silent, as if thinking or being told from some deep dark power what to do next. The Medallion's power was welled up and it glowed brightly while Simmon's hand rubbed it slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;We, ah I can tell and explain that Scott and Jean ran off to get married or something like young people do often. I could cover up their mistake in being touched by the curse of that crate and this Medallion. Yet you my ole' friend is a difficult problem, you have a wife and children, you would be missed! So for the sake of your entire family, be quiet about this affair!&quot; ordered professor Simmons.<br />
<br />
Myron stared for a moment at his past friend. &quot;I thought bad of you when I saw Scott wriggle of change and lose his human life to that of a billy goat. Now to keep me quiet you .........&quot; argued  Myron.</p>
