<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Sherry decided to make her way over to the barn. Her only hope of fixing this mess was to find the Chronivac again. To do that, she&#39;d need a computer, and the only structure around was that barn. <br />
<br />
As she started to walk, she felt nothing but humiliation. She could feel her face turn bright red while she strutted towards the barn. Not only was she forced to walk on all fours, but as she did so her huge fat body jiggled from side to side. Her massive new breasts barely touched the tips of the grass, which only made her feel embarrassingly horny. <br />
<br />
Somehow, that program had even altered her so that her arms and legs were closer in length, and her head stuck straight out instead of facing down, meaning she had to see all the other humans out in the field. All of them freaked her out. Especially Bill who as she passed she tried not to look at much.<br />
<br />
She passed a a redheaded man that Sherry quickly recognized as her  neighbor Fred, except changed too. He was much fatter, showing rows of fat that made him look slightly round in appearance. He even had two sets of nipples now His red hair was completely grown out and wild, unkept across his entire body. <br />
<br />
Out from a patch of curly red hairs in-between his legs was a massive cock, swaying slightly in the breeze. Sherry couldn&#39;t believe how massive it was, as it appeared almost bigger than his forearm. As she passed him, he looked up at her. His eyes looked glazed over as he chewed a clump of grass with his mouth open. He mowed at her and silently went back to eating.<br />
<br />
As Sherry huffed while she slowly trudged on, she passed another person, this time a woman. Sherry recognized her as another neighbor and friend Fiona. Fiona was normally a bit big for her age, but the woman before her dwarfed even her back then. The large black woman also had 4 gigantic breasts like Sherry, and her curly dark hair erupted chaotically out of her head but all over her body in lesser degrees too.<br />
<br />
What really got her attention was on Fiona&#39;s upper left breast there was a Jasmine slurping away at her tit. Sherry couldn&#39;t believe it, the 16 year old was just drinking away, completely nude, from her mother&#39;s tit without a care in the world. Fiona looked at Sherry also absent of any deep thought and gave her a light moo before giving Jasmine a lick on the head. It reminded her of her own daughter, and where she could be, which only motivated her more.<br />
<br />
Sherry had enough. She needed to fix this desperately. As she slowly trudged on, she kept her head hung low, trying not to draw any attention for herself. If what she had quickly read on that program was true then all of them had essentially the mindsets of cows. She kept trudging along until finally making it inside the barn.<br />
<br />
Sherry looked around and was disappointed by what she saw. It looked like a regular barn for storing cows. There were little stalls filled with hay and massive turds, and something instinctual even told Sherry that the one closest to her was the one she slept in. She sighed, and realized hoping for a computer in a barn was a stretch.<br />
<br />
Her self pity was distracted, however, by a swift slap on her fat ass. She perked up, and swiveled her head as far back as she could to see something as equally shocking as the people out in the field. There stood before her was a cow, except it was on two legs. Not only that, it was wearing farmer&#39;s overalls, had the body proportions of a man, and even seemed to had its loved shaped like fingers. The cow smiled and placed its straw hat on a hook.<br />
&quot;Well hey there Shelly! Someone&#39;s eager to get to work!&quot; He laughed, surprising Shelly completely.<br />
<br />
He just sounded like a normal guy. Sherry was confused even more by her name. Why was it Shelly? Regardless, what the hell did he mean by work? Shelly tried to ask him if he could understand her but all that came out was her voice mimicking a cow&#39;s moo.<br />
<br />
&quot;Woah easy girl I gotcha.&quot; He laughed before turning around for something. <br />
<br />
Sherry realized this was going no where. She needed to think of another way to get to a computer. &quot;Maybe if I just play my part I can follow this cow-man back to wherever he lives.&quot; She thought. Before she could come up with anything more thought out, a sudden feeling below her caused her to freeze.<br />
<br />
The cow had grabbed onto the edge of her breast, tugging on her nipple. She found herself feeling incredibly horny, as her pussy got wet. When it did so, she realized her pussy was no longer between her legs, but on her back side. She realized it&#39;d be easier for a four legged man to mate with her that way, and was disturbed by the thought, but didn&#39;t even have time to process it as the cow started milking her.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s good Shelly, good girl.&quot; The cow said patting at her side.<br />
<br />
She felt aroused and confused as she stood there being milked. &quot;How can this be real?&quot; She thought as she heard her own milk squirt into a bucket. As she waited for the cow to just hurry up and finish, she heard a feminine voice approach from the barn door.<br />
&quot;Daddy, when are we gonna go get lunch?&quot; The younger voice asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Pumpkin, sorry for the delay. I just saw this human here ready to be milked so I thought I&#39;d just get it done.&quot; He explained with a laugh.<br />
<br />
&quot;But me and Timmy wanted to get Manburgers!&quot; She sighed.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know I know this&#39;ll only take a bit longer.&quot; He explained.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okayyy.&quot; She said, before Sherry could hear her walk over. &quot;Which human is this anyway?&quot; She asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I&#39;ve just memorized their names, but remember you can always check the person tag.&quot; He reminded her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yeah.&quot; She chuckled, before pulling under Sherry&#39;s ear. Sherry gasped under her breath. Had she had a tag clipped to her ear this whole time? She couldn&#39;t believe how fat she had gotten not to notice.<br />
&quot;Oh right this is Shelly!&quot; She said happily.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s right Jen, it&#39;s Shelly.&quot; He said milking away. &quot;Fiona&#39;s are current breeding human, but I&#39;m thinking we&#39;ll give her a break for a bit and switch over to Shelly here. She&#39;s starting to get a bit feisty.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sherry&#39;s eyes shot wide. &quot;Breeding?!&quot; She thought panicked. There was NO way that she was gonna let some mindless fat versions of her neighbors have there way with her, let alone raising some mindless children on a freaking field. She had to figure out what to do. In her mind there were three options. <br />
<br />
One, try to run off now, using all her new bulk to just break in to their house hopefully nearby and hopefully find a computer. Two, she could wait till nighttime and try her best, despite her fat figure and cow reflexes, to break into their house stealthily and look for a computer. Then the third option would be to fully wait even longer in hopes of finding some more concrete evidence of where a computer was.<br />
<br />
Any option seemed hard, but eventually...</p>
