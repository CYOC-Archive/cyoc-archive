<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">She was up at five in the morning.<br />
<br />
Normally Frankie slept in and had to rush to class where she’d inevitably fall asleep again, but that morning her eyes pried open at five and a smile bloomed on her face. She well felt rested despite spending the previous night exploring every inch of her girlfriend’s sexy new body. She slipped away from her girl and into her own chambers where she promptly lay out her clothing for the day and got to bathing.<br />
<br />
She scrubbed her body clean in the shower and was quick and punctual, drying her hair off and tying it back for the work that would occur that day. She then got dressed in some of her usual work clothes and smiled as they changed on her body, turning into a variation of her maidservant garb.<br />
<br />
She then had to get the place ready for the day, lighting the fire under the stove, watering all Donna’s plants, and sweeping off the stone tiles while humming to herself. Their dorm was bigger than normal, a large wide chamber filled with furniture and a walk in pantry, a whole space dedicated to a small indoor botany garden, and even an elevated portion near the bedrooms. Banners and paintings had appeared on the walls overnight and Frankie was fine with that. It wasn’t as freaky as she’d imagined.<br />
<br />
The first one up was Danielle, ready for her morning run. Frankie kissed her good morning and cooked her a immense breakfast. Big body meant lots of food for fuel. She liked cooking suddenly, she felt like she had purpose and reason to. Taking care of her girlfriend and making sure she’d be right and ready for the day. They ate together and before long Danielle was gone.<br />
<br />
Donna was still asleep when Frankie entered her room with a tray of food. She pulled a pillow over her eyes and Frankie opened the windows letting light into the chamber and lighting a fire under Donna’s pot. She then picked out a dress for the day and ran a hot bath, standing near the door with a smile waiting for Donna to finish eating her breakfast.<br />
<br />
“You seem chipper,” she grumbled through a mouthful of eggs.<br />
<br />
“I feel chipper,” Frankie replied in a bubbly voice. She then shoved Donna into her run bath and got to work making the witch’s bed and cleaning clothes off the floor and organizing her messy desk of notes and books from the night prior. When Donna came back Frankie felt compelled to help her get ready, doing her hair, spritzing her with perfume, and handing her bottles and jars of makeup. Then once Donna was busy at her table with an open book she went back to the main room and wandered down the hallway to Janette’s room.<br />
<br />
How their dorm suddenly contained a hallway and flight of stairs without raising alarm was a mystery but not one Frankie cared about. Janette’s door was a huge hand carved double door with intricate trees on it, inside was a huge spacious room with a canopy bed in the middle. Frankie smiled and carried a tray of food in, calling out to Janette and feeling her heart flutter when her lady yawned her sweet yawn and sat up stretching.<br />
<br />
She looked as though she bathed in liquid moonlight and just radiated beauty. Frankie set the tray of food down and got to work opening the blinds, letting the sunlight see her lady and her beauty. It was a crime to keep her locked away in darkness.<br />
<br />
She then ran a bath in the adjacent bathhouse and picked out Janette’s outfit for the day, a flowing dress like that out of a dream that would be worn by a goddess. She wanted to see it on her lady so badly, it made her brim with excitement just thinking about it.<br />
<br />
When Janette was done eating she entered the bathroom and undressed. Her beautiful naked skin slowly lowering into the bath and relaxing in the waters. Frankie poured in scented oils and soaps and began to knead Janette’s shoulders with her hands, loosening every beautiful muscle along her body. Intoxicating scents rose from the bath and after soaking for nearly an hour Janette rose from the cooled waters and Frankie dried her off, seating her before the mirror and getting to work on her hair.<br />
<br />
She wove it into a braid crown before running a long braid down Janette’s back. The hair was a silvery blonde colour like moonlight one could touch. It was so soft and beautiful and her lady sat before the mirror pleasantly waiting for the work to be done. After the last tie was set in Frankie got to work on her makeup, dark eyeliner and beautiful Ruby lipstick. She got more radiant and beautiful by the second and Frankie blushed as she worked. Then it was time for the dress, and the outfit slid onto her lady’s body leaving Frankie breathless and enamoured.<br />
<br />
“I’m off to class,” her Princess proclaimed once she was dressed and ready for the day. “Do you think Mason will like the dress.”<br />
<br />
“He would throw himself off a cliff if you asked my lady,” Frankie stammered out. Taken aback that there was any doubt in Janette’s mind that she couldn’t win the admiration of any man in the world.”<br />
<br />
“Have a good day Frankie!” Janette called before shouldering her bag and leaving. The sun seemed to shine a little dimmer once she was out the door.<br />
<br />
The morning was spent keeping the dorm orderly. Things kept changing for some reason. Every time Frankie turned there was a new cupboard in the kitchen or step on the stairs. Heck by the time lunch rolled around she had to walk up a circular staircase to get to Donna’s room.<br />
<br />
“Lunch my lady,” she announced, setting a tray down next to Donna who was pouring over her books.<br />
<br />
“Frankie,” Donna called with a beckoning of her hand. “What do you think about Mason?”<br />
<br />
“Our lady’s true love, Mason?” Frankie asked.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, what do you think of him?” Donna demanded.<br />
<br />
“He makes our lady oh so happy, anything that can make her smile brighten this world is worth it to me,” Frankie sighed dreamily.<br />
<br />
Donna seemed put off by that so Frankie went downstairs and sat down in her bedroom. She sat down at her desk and pulled a pencil out, beginning to draw out an outfit before her. She made all her lady’s clothing, the radiant dresses, the beautiful shirts, and the wintertime outfits to keep the chill from her perfect skin. It was a passion she always dreamed of doing before she changed, designing clothing. Her father had said it wasn’t a realistic goal, but now she could do it, and her model was Janette.<br />
<br />
She drew for most of the afternoon, sketching out ideas for her lady, Donna, her girlfriend, and even herself. She liked her current garb but she’d want something different come the season’s change. This was how her girlfriend found her, prying open the door and walking up behind her.<br />
<br />
“Beautiful,” Danielle complimented making Frankie’s entire body shudder in anticipation. She leaned back and received a passionate kiss, one that made her heart beat oh so quickly. She then got up and awaited her lady’s return.<br />
<br />
Janette was in a good mood, apparently Mason had been speechless when he’d seen her. She’d done wonderfully in all her classes and wanted nothing more than to relax with a bit of tea and a novel. Frankie gave her those things and bowed her way out of the room, getting to work prepping dinner for the household and setting the large dining room table that had appeared while she’d been drawing. A warm fire crackled in the hearth and Frankie sat down before it with a smile while dinner cooked, deciding she would sew together an outfit while she waited. She felt accomplished, calm, and happy with herself. Dinner would be splendid and later she’d make love to her darling before doing it all again the next day. Oh she couldn’t wait for Lady Janette to marry Mason and have a few children for her to help raise, bathing, dressing, and feeding them so they could be proper. She got dreamy just thinking about it.</p>
