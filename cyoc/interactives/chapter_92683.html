<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">With everything set, Terry tried to relax herself as she fought her way through the paperwork that she still needed to finish up on for the day.  The fact that she was going to spend the night as a horse thanks to the Pen however, was a constant distraction that kept creeping its way into her head, thoughts of running around free as the wind causing her to keep putting down her work and see herself as she would be soon enough.  <br />
<br />
Perhaps that was why she was wrenched from her daydreaming with a jolt as she felt a hard tug at the base of her spine along with her ears, forcing her to stand up as she felt her panties being pushed down before they were loose enough to drop beneath her skirt and to her heels.  <br />
<br />
“Shit.  Forgot the time.”  Terry hissed to herself more out of annoyance than any real anger as she noted that the time now read 8:30pm.  <br />
<br />
Thankfully the feeling of a new appendage brushing against the back of her legs was enough to soften her mood before long, and turning her head to look Terry spied the horse tail she now sported, flicking lightly with the merest thought from her.  A hand shakily rose to brush her ears, the sensations running through the hand and ears telling her they were long, pointed, and coated in fur.  <br />
<br />
“I have to see this for myself.”  She declared to herself as she made for the ladies room, staring at her own reflection by the sink mirror, the grey coating on her ears, their length, their shape.  Like that of the Percheron Draught Mare she had chosen to become, if a little small at this precise moment.  <br />
<br />
“This, is, too, cool.”  She gasped, spending long moments admiring them, and her tail which she found she could control with relative ease.  “Ooh, I’m going to like this when it’s done.”  She stated, slowly returning to her desk.  She still had a lot of work to cover, and she’d have to speed it up if she wanted to enjoy the process as well as the results.  <br />
<br />
Which was easier said than done.  Having pulled up her skirt to allow her tail more freedom, her bare buttocks now rested on the chair, sometimes tickling her pussy ever so slightly when she shifted her weight, and sending a pleasant shiver through her.  It wasn’t too long before fingers found their way to her blouse, prising each button loose one after the other, before unclasping her bra at the front.  Without those two pieces in the way, her free hand stroked and massaged them one by one, fingers tickling and tugging gently at the nipples, her attention to her work all but evaporated now.  <br />
<br />
Though that too didn’t last.  8:45pm and her legs cramped up, muscles rearranging themselves to support the changing bone structure.  Terry barely succeeded in kicking off her footwear, before her lengthening feet would have torn through them, watching as the outer toes shrivelled up, the remaining three swelling and merging before they darkened, becoming hard hooves, grey fur sprouting from just above it and up her new legs.  <br />
<br />
“I’ll be.”  She exclaimed quietly as she rose on them, having no trouble maintaining her balance as she took her first tentative steps around the Office, a slight but distinct ‘Clop’ made by her hoofed feet as she set them down.  <br />
<br />
Pulling up her skirt, her vulva had turned quite dark, perhaps black and seemed to be larger than before.  “This, is, unbelievable.”  Terry gasped out as she carefully got the hang of walking with her new stance.  <br />
<br />
But she still had her work to complete, and now she knew if she wanted to have her fun, she had better buckle down and get to it.  In spite of the increase sensations from her possibly enlarged vulva, Terry was now actively fighting the sensations as she forced herself to push through the remaining work, determined to claw back as much time to herself as she still could.  <br />
<br />
She had started closing out her position when she felt her face pushing out, jaws elongating and teeth reforming to fit in her new mouth.  Her hair working itself into what she knew to be a mane.  This time though, Terry didn’t stop to look at herself, instead finishing the last piece of work she had before she could declare her work for the day done.  <br />
<br />
“Muth, thetter.”  She garbled out, her mouth no longer designed for proper speech.  <br />
<br />
Now she had to collect her things, her two sets of keys, purse, ID, and her reports.  She almost started to leave when she remembered the Pen, and everything she’d written down so far.  Carefully folding the sheets of paper together, she slipped them into her handbag along with her discarded underwear, the shoes held in a free hand as she left and locked up the Office tight just as she felt the fur spreading across her entire body.  <br />
<br />
She took a brisk stroll to her car, a fairly standard Sedan which was the best she could get, and very, very second-hand, feeling confident enough to walking on hooves to chance it, tossing the handbag and shoes into the passenger seat before settling herself in and starting up the engine.  As she settled herself in, she looked down to where her hooves rested, noting how the pedals for the Gas and Brake were now shaped to allow them to rest comfortably, and allow her control.  <br />
<br />
“Gooth.  All going, thoo, plan.”  She slurred out with a contented sigh, adjusting the mirror so she could see her own face, the grey fur that ran along it, the white mane that sat atop it, wide eyes brimming with intellect.  <br />
<br />
The same fur that now covered her entire body, mostly grey with a dappled pattern that she could see along the sides of her rump and neck, the tufts at the limbs and her mane were white though.  <br />
<br />
A short time after, and she was ready to leave, only driving up to the gate where she parked the car, engine still running as she left to open the gate, another security measure given those they tended to here.  Once she’d rolled the car out, the gate was locked again behind her.  As soon as she was back in the car, and with her seatbelt on out of habit, she saw her hands lengthen, the fingers either shrivelling into her or merging into one, hard hoof tipping the ends of them.  <br />
<br />
“Whoa.”  She couldn’t help but gasp out, testing them on the steering wheel, and pleased to find that she could still turn it with ease, along with selecting ‘Drive’ as she was ready to begin her drive.  <br />
<br />
All she needed to decide on was, would she turn to the left?  And make her way to her home?  Or go right instead and go where the road took her?  And with nine minutes left before the next stage of her preset transformation, she knew she’d better decide fast.</p>
