<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Erviel trekked through the darkened corridors with purpose, each step followed by clicking claws and faint squeaking. While the black cloak draped across his scales hid the sheen of his reflective body, the tip of his tail snaked out and trailed behind him, whilst his reptilian-esque maw poked out from the hood over his face.<br />
<br />
The darkened halls of the crypt were no worse for wear, if they could even be described as such. It was hell in comparison to that odd library filled with light, although that was without mentioning the amount of lust-driven beasts roaming the halls or the masked cult that had amassed; who viewed themselves as paragons for the Corrupted.<br />
<br />
It was all a sick joke, really. A substance that would bring the world&#39;s end, giving birth to some offshoot wannabe religious group seeking salvation.<br />
<br />
Granted, he himself was no better. Especially now, when he&#39;d found something that could aid in his goal.<br />
<br />
His clawed digits drifted beneath the black robe, clutching at the rose-like stone dangling from a black choker around his neck; color matching his lavender-colored eyes. In a sense, it also bore some resemblance to that dagger he found back in that chamber.<br />
<br />
His hand dropped to his side, reptilian maw parting with a sigh. While he&#39;d managed to observe the battle between the group of cultists against the dragon and his armored companion, following them through the black doorway proved in vain; as they and the cultists were nowhere in sight. He did have a clue to where they could have gone though; the darkest part of the crypt where even the dim light overhead refused to shine.<br />
<br />
He continued onwards through the labyrinth of cavernous hallways, dull crimson light permeating throughout and serving as a makeshift lightsource. As the darkness grew thicker, he could practically feel his scale-like skin begin to thin; an effect of the airborne Corruption that flooded these halls.<br />
<br />
His clicking footfalls came to a halt as he neared the corner of a particularly dark hall, the very shadows appearing to teem with life. Wispy tendrils of darkness pried at his robe and exposed tail, some attempting to slither beneath and caress his slender form; although they would find their efforts fruitless upon glimpsing the rose-like stone dangling over his chest, retreating wisely.<br />
<br />
Down the darkened corridor from where he stood, Erviel&#39;s lavender eyes narrowed upon the sight of a small, almost unnoticeable light; one that surely would&#39;ve been choked by the thick shadows.<br />
<br />
At least, if it were in plain sight.<br />
<br />
The faint glow grew as he proceeded forth, albeit radiating from beneath a doorframe if the floor was any indication. Discerning the swift movement of shadow from the dim light, he pressed his claws into a fist and gently rapped his knuckles against the wooden exterior of the door.<br />
<br />
His knock went unanswered, although from behind the thick wood he could hear the faint shuffling of paper and something falling over. The shadows at his feet seemed to quicken as well.<br />
<br />
He knocked again, scowling upon receiving another faint shuffle of papers in response. <br />
<br />
Turning away from the doorway in irritation, Erviel flexed his claws. With a glint in his slitted-pupils, he just as quickly spun on a heel and delivered a frustrated kick to the wooden door; sending it flying off its hinges.<br />
<br />
He ignored a shrill voice as he strutted through the open doorway, scowl across his maw growing as his gaze drifted around the expansive scribes study littered with delicately organized piles of books and sheafs of paper; the light stemming from various candles.<br />
<br />
His lavender eyes finally settled upon the small desk at the far center of the room where a small robed figure lay seated, quill clutched tight in an exposed hand. A small reptilian snout poked out from the hood draped across it&#39;s head, yellows eyes complimented by blue scales.<br />
<br />
&quot;Was that <em>truly</em> necessary?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You took too long.&quot; Erviel scoffed, slamming the door shut behind him. &quot;Be happy I cared enough to knock first.&quot;<br />
<br />
The kobold sighed, throwing his hood off and setting his quill and a tome off to the side as he hopped off his chair. Much like the lavender-eyed creature, a scaled tail slinked out from beneath his robe. Roughly five feet in height, he was a few inches short of reaching Erviel; which was remarkable granted he was a kobold. Definitely a tall one for his kind, and a point of pride.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, what brings you to my little study once more? Was the last visit not enough? Do you yearn for more knowledge to fill that noggin of yours?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Keep dreaming.&quot; Erviel frowned, revealing the rose dagger. &quot;Now, does the little lizard want a treat?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my… that dagger!&quot; The kobold gasped, the stupor in his eyes shaken as it was pulled from his reach upon his attempt to reach out for it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Forgetting your own deals already?&quot; The lavender-eyed figure scowled, leaning down and allowing his gaze to lock with the blue reptile. &quot;Really makes me wonder if you&#39;ve ever realized how much of a fucking slut you are. Especially with those stupid boyshorts under that robe.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;W-Well… can you blame me?&quot; He replied sheepishly, gaze still locked onto the rose dagger. &quot;There is no obstacle that I would allow to obscure my pursuit of knowledge!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;May as well just get this over with...&quot; The violet-scaled entity muttered, letting the dagger fall into the reptile&#39;s needful hands.<br />
<br />
The kobold scampered back to his desk, unable to contain his enthusiasm as he leapt onto his seat. Setting the dagger off to his side delicately, he rummaged through the pages of one of his tomes eagerly; jaw parting with a smile upon stopping at a page depicting a sketch which bore an uncanny resemblance to the ornate weapon. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm…&quot; He studied, gaze darting from the sketch and notes written to the physical object. &quot;Truly a splendid relic! Where did you find such an esteemed weapon?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ask the dragon who dropped it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;T-The… <em>dragon</em>? There&#39;s a <em>dragon</em> roaming the crypt?!&quot; The kobold&#39;s yellow eyes were wide with shock, a quill in his grasp and page in front of him. &quot;Elaborate, please!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine, but you&#39;re paying me back.&quot; Erviel&#39;s eyes narrowed, maw curling into a frown. &quot;I&#39;ll give you a basic run-down; large silver dragon with a golden claw in his chest and an axe for a tail. Had a human companion. Followed them through some weird door and ended up in some weird library. Then those masked assholes showed up and captured them. Tried following them through a door they used as an exit, but lost them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Claw in chest… silver scales… axe tail...&quot; The reptile noted furiously, brow furrowed in focus. &quot;What&#39;s this about a library? Was it-?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not the one you&#39;re looking for.&quot; He muttered, eyes falling to the dagger atop the desk. &quot;It was bright as hell in there, and all the books were blank. Complete opposite of the one you keep obsessing over.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see...&quot; He noted in disappointment, dipping his quill in more ink. &quot;Undoubtedly a plane bound to this one of some sorts. Where it may be located in regards to this world could be difficult to pinpoint, but if you could take me there perhaps I could…&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Find it yourself.&quot; Erviel scoffed, retrieving the dagger to the kobold&#39;s disdain. &quot;You got a look at this fancy junk and I told you about that dragon; so when I ask this question you&#39;d better give a good answer.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ha… ever the impatient one, even in such a form…&quot; The blue reptile murmured, setting his quill down and turning to his cloaked guest. &quot;Should I assume a wrong answer warrants a death threat?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re learning fast.&quot; He nodded with a smirk, though his expression hardened. &quot;Now, tell me; those masked cultists… where can I find them? That dragon, I know he&#39;ll be vital if I want to succeed in achieving my goal.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmph… ever the ambitious one...&quot; The kobold&#39;s claw tapped at his chin in thought, gaze drifting to a door at the far back of the room. &quot;There <em>is</em> a passage through that door that leads further into the crypt. For all I know, the deeper one travels into this labyrinth, the closer one grows to him; as your brethren can attest to.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;...You had a backdoor to the deeper levels of this stupid place the whole time?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This little study of mine is a <em>temporary</em> outpost! I&#39;ll need to eventually head deeper to find what I seek, as you know!&quot;<br />
<br />
Erviel sighed with a shrug, claws clicking against the stone floor as he walked to the back of the room; although as he prepared to exit he glanced back to the robed kobold who had resumed scribbling notes down upon a blank sheet of paper.<br />
<br />
Muttering to himself, the lavender-eyed creature stepped out from the dimly lit study; slamming the door shut and embracing the darkness of the crypt once more.<br />
<br />
With clicking claws and light squeaking, he began walking down the vast hall; tiring at the knowledge that there were many more to come.</p>
