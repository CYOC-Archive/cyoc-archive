<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Ah…what do we do?” inquired Stacy as the TV which hadn’t been muted returned to their notice.<br />
<br />
“The State and Federal Government is ordering all citizens to remain inside and await instructions, do not venture out on the streets for some of those who have transformed have become more animal like and can not be reasoned with.” Said the news man, well women, elf. “If you are with someone who has is showing a more animal like nature, restrain them if possible and lock them up if you can.”<br />
<br />
All four girls eyed each other for a moment. <br />
<br />
“I feel fine?” stated Barbara, she didn&#39;t want to say she actually felt better then fine.<br />
<br />
“Same here.” Said her sister, now nine tailed Kitsune Lindsay<br />
<br />
“I need some damn cloths.” Stated Elizabeth as she sat crossed legged on the bed covering her breast with her hands. <br />
<br />
“I do really want some meat, a thick dripping burger.” Admitted Stacy as all eyes moved toward the cat women. “Not to the point of wanting to hunt you down or eat you, but I am a Pescatarian and have been for over a decade so this is disturbing.”<br />
<br />
Everyone nodded, Stacy was a vegetarian in all but name only eating sea food like fish and other sea food if she wanted to sink her teeth into a burger then something mental had happened to her as well.<br />
<br />
“Well cats eat fish.” Stated Lindsay which got a small laugh.<br />
<br />
“You all can talk about that; I need to find some damn cloths.” Stated Elizabeth as she went for her bag and the draw full of cloths she had brought. <br />
<br />
That started a process, everyone getting dressed and checking out their bodies in more detail. For Barbara she had likely the easiest job. She did not have a tail, a pair of her tan cargo shorts worked great and stopped right at the horns/spikes at her knees. She did not even attempt to put on her shoes, the scale covered foreleg and the large, raised claw toe made that impossible. One of her normal open back orange tank tops worked just as well now as they had yesterday, and they stayed out of the way of her new wings which came out of her shoulders blades but folded up to cover most of her back. She tied her now brighter blonde hair back into a ponytail and sat back down at the end of the bed and watched the news. <br />
<br />
For Stacy the main issue was her tail, her pants did not have a hole in the but for them, in the end she decided to have Barbara use one of her claws to rip open a hole for it and within a few minutes she was sitting beside her in a pair of blue jeans, black tank top. While Stacy was trying to figure out how to get her jeans to work Barbara had noticed the Stacy was far more flexible than before, to the point that it was a little painful just to see how far she could twist herself. Still her mind went to what the flexibility could mean in the bedroom.<br />
For Lindsay she was in a bad shape, her whole body was covered with fur and whenever she tried to put on some cloths she ripped them off. <br />
<br />
“It is some damn itchy.” She cursed.<br />
<br />
“Well just go nude.” Advised Stacy as she looked from Lindsay to the TV screen, it showed multiple fur covered humans going totally nude, some of which their private parts clearly visible. “At least yours is well hidden compared to theirs and how will you fit nine tails in any pair of pants? It is a bitch with one.”<br />
<br />
“True.” Stated Lindsay as she sat down.<br />
<br />
They now just waited on Elizabeth who was having a nightmare of a time, her small frame was now smaller and so she was swimming in her cloths. They thought about ripping them of them to make them smaller but her wings where a major issue. Unlike Barbara or Stacy who liked open back tops, Elizabeth didn’t like them and so didn’t pack any. They solved her bra issue by having Stacy use her claws to make holes to allow Elizabeth to tighten it around her now smaller frame. The issue with her wings was solved by having her put on the silver cocktail dress she had brought down with her for their planned final night out at a very high-end night club, all four of them had brought one down for a future that wouldn’t happen now. For Elizabeth it was the only thing she had with an open back for her wings and the dress which normally would have stopped at her knees now reached her ankles. Her shoes where easy enough but she looked weird in an open back silver cocktail dress with black tennis shoes. <br />
<br />
It was a rather long and horrifying day as the four of them sat on the edges of the beds watching the news as New Orleans was basically turned to rubble. Multiple different dragons fought in the sky for dominance, they didn’t kill each other but like a pack of wolves they where fighting to see who would end up being the alpha. Groups of monsters moved throughout the city hunting, they watched a group of werewolves take down a Centaur and eat them live on TV. Other more human, or at least human minded people hid in homes or tried to hide. In some cases, monsters who you would think would be animal like where among those who tried to save people. Not all monsters where pack hunters they watched on TV as a giant, she had to be 3 stories tall and with four arms punch a hole in a building to get to someone, someone who they quickly ate. <br />
<br />
The military began to fully show up around noon, jet fighters tried take down dragons only to find their missiles doing little damage to their scale covered skin. The dragons either injured them or worse yet destroyed them with fire or some other thing. They watched as a Chinese dragon spit out a bolt of lightning which took down 4 jets at once. The TV showed tanks and soldiers fighting creatures, sometimes they won a large three headed dog going down to a shot from a tank. Other times like against a rock creature the tank was crushed like a can of beans.<br />
<br />
“My God.” Said Stacy as Barbara took her hand in hers.<br />
<br />
“We will be ok.” Reassured Barbara as the roar of helicopter blades overhead caused all four to rush to the window. They had closed the blinds just as the TV had said but they pulled them back now to let them see a small black helicopter land on the roof of hotel they where on. The Hotel was shaped like a block O with a large pool in the middle and the hallways all along the outside of the building. They had gotten a pool side room and that allowed them to see the small team of soldiers who where now on the roof across from them all of them wore gas masks and chemical suits and they scanned the area from their rooftop view. <br />
<br />
 Barbara did the same as best she could, there were of course other guests, they had heard the screams as people woke up to the change and judging by the open/busted doors in some of the rooms they could see from their windows not everyone was following the orders to remain inside. She did spot a few people who like them where looking out their window trying to see what was going on.<br />
<br />
“The army is here.” Said Lindsay as she hovered above the ground and did a little dance. “We are saved.”<br />
<br />
“Lets hope.” Stated Barbara a bad feeling coming across her.</p>
