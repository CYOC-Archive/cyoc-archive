<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Of course, Gaal couldn't 'attack' the pride, she had been dead for centuries, and her shade <br />
emulated by the curse had no direct effect on the real world except through the curse and <br />
how it was interpreted. <br />
<br />
The destruction of Gaal's shade had created an imbalance within the curse that had <br />
enabled Galgatha and Gamorrah to grow like a cancer, enable them to effect the gem <br />
wolves and the herd on Big Bad Island directly! Even if they still had no material form or <br />
any sort of manifestation save for the transformation of the victims. <br />
<br />
While one simple thing was to make it so the consciousness of the curse had been slowly <br />
building steadily over the centuries since the witch's deaths, there were still many <br />
contradictions. <br />
<br />
Megan and Margot of course would have no reason to rescue Ashley since Ashley and co, <br />
would have no reason to attack Brian and his family to capture Madam Serenity. And thus <br />
they'd have no reason to be made into statues as an example to the rest of the pack, Ami <br />
being knocked out in an argument between Jensen and Roger on weather it was too harsh <br />
a punishment or not for reckless behavior that endangered the rest of the pack. And thus <br />
no way for Ami to face off and destroy Gaal.  Thus the imbalance could have never <br />
happened and the war to liberate Big Bad Island could not courier. <br />
<br />
But strangely the injuries the wolves and other recieved seemed to be immune to any <br />
changes in reality, forcing existence for whatever reason to work around them. So the <br />
battle to liberate Big Bad island from a fully awakened curse, then Kurse, HAD to occur. <br />
<br />
This was a paradox, and reality, did not in any shape or form tolerate paradoxes. <br />
<br />
Thus, Megan and Margot WILLINGLY offered themselves up to Kaylee their Alpha Female as <br />
a gift as a late birthday present, knowing her fetish for statues with souls. Perhaps they <br />
had been speaking to Yamato too much and his mates a little too much. <br />
<br />
Using the Transform or Dare unleashed into the pack's hands by Billy and to Bart and <br />
Jenny then to the six shadows, and over Roger's protests, had made themselves into <br />
statues of Kaylee's chosen pose and material with serene peaceful minds of never having <br />
been anything but. <br />
<br />
Functioning as the drop of water in a cup causing it to spill over, Gaal's shadow had fully <br />
awakened by this Transform on each other into motionless works of art each with an <br />
immortal spirit that amplified the empathy any looking upon the work knowing of it's <br />
origins or not a thousand fold (many failed artists had used the game for their own ends <br />
because of this accidently early discovered fact). <br />
<br />
And the game had quickly been spread and used on all those at the manor, it's mere <br />
presence enough to turn anyone it lay within now into a total sociopath. <br />
<br />
Amy had been praying inside the tiny shinto shrine set aside at the Estate when it <br />
happened. Amy's religion was a rather odd thing, consider her half-mother was a New <br />
Age Spiritualist and her brother, mother, and father were all christian. <br />
<br />
All the same, Amy had been spared. And Amy had, from being accidently knocked by <br />
Roger during a brawl with Jensen over Margot and Megan's statufication (never mind it had <br />
been the she-wolves own idea). And had faced Gaal and managed to destroy her shade. <br />
<br />
This had the side effect of reversing the immediate Transforms and Dares done by the <br />
pack (the less spoke of them the better). This included the statufication Megan and Margot <br />
had done to themselves.  Megan and Margot had apologized to their alpha female for <br />
losing her birthday present, but there had been the more important matter of what was <br />
happening at the pack's underdeveloped and utterly wild island estate. <br />
<br />
Of course Megan, Ashley, and Margot, had immediately volunteered to be among those to <br />
rescue their pack mates from Kurse's control.  Anne had always been a pacifist at heart, <br />
and had spent time at the local soup kitchen rather than attending Nicole's martial arts <br />
classes (Nicole being a third degree black belt).  Some even rumored another reason was <br />
that Anne was pregnant, but this was neither confirmed nor denied.  Not that Anne would <br />
have any reason denying it if true... she was a married woman after all.  Though the <br />
marriage of the five wolves was delayed for a short time as Lawrence decided if he loved <br />
Anne enough to convert to her fatih (as she had convinced the other she-wolves), as it <br />
turned out, he did. <br />
<br />
While Lawrence was a hulking muscle titan of a wolf (much like Roger), he had once been <br />
a student of the finer arts of poetry and theater (Paradise Lost and Dante's Divine Comedy <br />
among them) before diving into making his body some imaginary ideal of wolf perfection <br />
and Roger had been suckered in too. For Jensen, Nick and Zack had been natural and <br />
gradual, for Roger and Lawrence it had been a fixation, and they had acted for a time <br />
almost like dumb jocks. Anne had been the one among the four she wolves who'd become <br />
his loyal mates to help him rediscover love of fine art.<br />
<br />
When Betty had found out what had happened to her nephew in the meantime while she <br />
had been artwork, she admonished him, to think he had nearly let himself sacrifice some <br />
of the better parts of himself just so he'd not be mistaken for a woman... the absurdity... <br />
<br />
&quot;But Auntie...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't you Auntie me Lawrence! I KNOW your parents would have raised you better then <br />
that! You and your friend Roger were malely wolves weather you had the muscles your <br />
pack mate Zack had or not! To be a man is what you do! Not how bulked up you are!&quot;<br />
<br />
Lilly said, &quot;Only Spartan Women give birth to real men.&quot;<br />
<br />
Casandra hit her on the base of her tale, &quot;Not so loud! Mom's not supposed to know you <br />
saw that movie!&quot;<br />
<br />
Lilly retorted, &quot;She's not here!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But she could be! Adults always find out somehow.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ahem.&quot; Said 'glass' Marie. <br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry.&quot; Said Lilly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ooops.&quot; Replied Casandra.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please continue.&quot; Betty said politely to the witch wolf.<br />
<br />
&quot;As you wish.&quot; <br />
<br />
+++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey guys.&quot; Said a pink wolf with a white belly and lower face fur like Miles' and Ashley's <br />
pattern. She stood next to the fountain looking up at the fountain head, and sat down. The <br />
three still statues forever pouring water into the basin. &quot;I've kinda been sulking my duties, <br />
not a good thing to do when we have so many hurt... but... I needed to do some thinking <br />
and well.   At first I wanted to tell Alpha Male Jensen about what we did. About what you <br />
did. To have Amy and Zelipe FORCE you back into living breath wolves rather than just <br />
ghosts in rock like living record nobodies knows there more to than me, Robert, Wendy, <br />
Jessica, and my fellow pink wolf Rose.&quot; For some reason, pink colored wolves felt a very <br />
strange, but very powerful sense of kinship. But the only male pink wolf the pack had, <br />
Zelipe himself was part of this group, if somewhat unsure himself. &quot;And of course you <br />
guys...&quot;<br />
<br />
She leaned back against the statue that was Nelson. Getting her tail wet somewhat as it <br />
touched the basin. &quot;But you know what guys? I've decided I'm gonna keep our 'pack <br />
secret.' If someone ever figures it out then I won't stop them. But I'm not about to blurb it <br />
either. This was your choice, and it's not like your committing suicide or murder. That <br />
chaos Kurse wanted would have made every choice meaningless since anything was as <br />
likely to happen if we made a choice or not so... &quot; She stepped back and took a good look <br />
at the statues, scaled to be about four fifths their 'actual' size.  &quot;I just wanna say you guys <br />
look really really nice up there. You're so beautiful, so endless. So smooth. No, I don't <br />
regret my choice to stay flesh and blood, the time I was a statue was more than enough <br />
for me, but I can't help but admire your dedication. Just be sure to step down from there <br />
and attend my funeral when I die of old age okay?&quot; <br />
<br />
She then skipped into the fountain getting her feet wet and kissed each statue on the <br />
muzzle getting her face wet, and then stepped back out. &quot;Be seeing you around.&quot; Kimberly <br />
went to dry off and report for duty and whatever chewing out she'd get for disappearing. <br />
<br />
+++++++<br />
<br />
Joy's three heads said, &quot;We're just sorry that this entire mess has forced you to delay your <br />
surgery again.&quot; To Chiyoye. <br />
<br />
&quot;Think nothing of it Joy-Chan.&quot; Chiyoye said, &quot;I'm -almost- getting used to it.... I <br />
remember when I used to LIKE these THINGS... until I realized that when I and my sister <br />
wives breed with Yamato-Kun we won't be able to hug our own pups... not to mention I <br />
can barely act swiftly and deadly through the night carrying such dead weight.. and <br />
Yamato-Kun had always given his word of honor that he shall love us regardless of such <br />
things... I'll be glade when we are healed and Julie-Beta-San can finally free us of this <br />
horrid curse.&quot; Chiyoye laid her hands on the double beach ball sized breasts. <br />
<br />
&quot;There are some wolves and humans who would consider it a blessing.&quot; Joy's three heads <br />
said.<br />
<br />
&quot;There are some wolves and humans who are complete and utter BAKA!&quot;<br />
<br />
+++++++<br />
<br />
Amethyst looked at the eight midnight black and reddish brown lion cubs and said, &quot;Hello <br />
dears!&quot; She called out happily, &quot;Where's your nanny?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We are quite mature we can take care of ourselves.&quot; Moja said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bleh.&quot; Nane stuck out her tongue playfully.<br />
<br />
&quot;Most of us.&quot; Moja corrected.<br />
<br />
Gretchen stuck her own tongue out, &quot;How uncouth!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What's yer name again? Gazelle?&quot; Mbili asked innocently. <br />
<br />
&quot;I'm Giselle.&quot; Said the gold wolf cub next to the first one who spoke.<br />
<br />
&quot;I am Gretchen.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nane laughed, &quot;Gretchen? As in Grench?&quot; She laughed again, &quot;That name is so ugly I'm <br />
surprised it doesn't jump up and run away from home leaving you 'No Name.' &quot;<br />
<br />
Gretchen started, and shivered slightly, &quot;My name... isn't... ugly...&quot;<br />
<br />
Giselle hugged her sister.<br />
<br />
Amethyst put her hands on her hips, &quot;Hey now little miss! That is over the line!&quot;<br />
<br />
Tano, Sita, and Saba also looked harshly at her sister who shrunk over the sudden <br />
disapproving glares.<br />
<br />
&quot;... sorry...&quot; She said reluctantly. 'It's still an ugly name.'<br />
<br />
Saba tried to redirect things, &quot;Hey about we wrestle?&quot;<br />
<br />
Half of the cubs and pups said yeah to that idea, the other half thought the first half was <br />
being a little too 'smack and whack' happy.<br />
<br />
Saba said, &quot;Come on, we're lions and wolves, wresting is as natural to us as monkey bars <br />
are to humans!&quot;<br />
<br />
This stopped to make everyone think.<br />
<br />
++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;I wish Sarah was here.&quot; Ulysses said thinking of his mentor. <br />
<br />
&quot;Don't worry,&quot; Said Maxine coming up on one side, &quot;You've got me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And me too sugah.&quot; Added Robyn.<br />
<br />
&quot;You're here to help move the heard not flirt.&quot; Said a male voice behind them. <br />
 <br />
The teen wolves turned to see the black and gray gallery wolf Robert with Wendy, Jessica <br />
and Rose behind him. <br />
<br />
The active Maxine waved at her fellow pink wolf who politely but reservedly waved back.<br />
<br />
Robert looked around. Coral, Amber, Tourmaline, Opal, Caroline / Cobalt, Ruby, Emerald <br />
and Gargent were all around the herd, who was looking at the pack, not with the calm they <br />
did when they weren't hunting or the adrenaline fueled desire to live when the pack and <br />
pride were, but a deep seated look of distain from Marcine... <br />
<br />
'This could be a little bit of trouble.' Robert thought. The relationship between the herd, <br />
and the pride and pack was a rather odd one. Robert just hoped Kurse's legacy didn't <br />
include a disaster regarding it. <br />
<br />
Gargent grumbled as a pair of big juicy plump watermelons from a tree(!) hit her on the <br />
head, muttering &quot;Amethyst,&quot; as she did so. <br />
<br />
Caroline/Colbalt was next to Opal of course, both directing the other teen wolves as best <br />
they could, even if they were quite the oldest, they were the most responsible. <br />
<br />
Ruby and Emerald together as always kept inching around the clearing.  Amber kept <br />
inching towards the herd then inching back, testing their reactions. Coral, and Tourmaline <br />
seemed to be waiting for their turn to flirt with Ulysses. <br />
<br />
++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, 'Sarah'.&quot; Said the lavender she-wolf Sarah to the lioness whose individuality was <br />
mixing a splash mix of brown, gold, beige and white fur (earning her the nickname <br />
'Modern Art' at school much to her annoyance).  She currently had a cast on both her arms, <br />
legs, and tail at breaking the neck of one of the blind centaur things in the air and crashed <br />
onto the ground with it on top of her (it resurrected when returned to normal thank God). <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey 'Sasha.' &quot; Said the she wolf Sasha in response with the same well meaning sarcastic <br />
tone, &quot;Your 'little brother' still doing well?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I'm his big sister, even if it's not genetic, I need to look out for him. How are you?&quot; She <br />
was glade there was one person who had never mistaken her relationship with Ulysses as <br />
something else. <br />
<br />
&quot;I feel totally at peace with the universe... either that or going totally crazy at needing help <br />
to scratch my muzzle...&quot; <br />
<br />
Sarah laughed, it's no pick nick for me either. Believe it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh I believe you, 'Sasha.' &quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Right, 'Sarah.' &quot; Sarah replied to the lioness. <br />
<br />
Before Sasha  had moved onto the police academy along with her pack-mates, Sasha had <br />
take classes in the same building as Sarah. Due to someone being only half awake in their <br />
too small cubical, their paper work had been switched. Leading to a very awkward and <br />
confusing first few days and both wondering if they had fallen into alternate reality or had <br />
their minds switched with someone like in Quantum Leap. <br />
<br />
Apathetic paper pushers didn't help matter, and both had chosen to take matters into their <br />
own hands and had ran smack dab into their counter part... literally...  both trying at <br />
different offices to explain in cool, calm and collected voices, no, they were NOT victims of <br />
the curse that had changed their species from 'lion/wolf' to 'wolf/lion' and changed their <br />
names from 'Sasha/Sarah' to 'Sarah/Sasha.' Though of course, that was what victims <br />
always said right?<br />
<br />
They had both been shipped off to the consolers office... and had finally met each other <br />
not looking where they were going. Of course the left hand had no idea what the right had <br />
had been doing. The two after introductions, surprise, and very big relief had entered the <br />
office together, the look on the school psychologists face was priceless. Things had finally <br />
been sorted out.  Though first introductions still define everything, and even some <br />
members of their pack and pride still got their names mixed up.  It had become a personal <br />
code for the two of them with each other since then. <br />
<br />
This was one of the reasons that Jensen had ordered the entire next generation home <br />
schooled... The pride was fifty-fifty on weather it would do the same.<br />
<br />
&quot;So,&quot; Asked Sasha, &quot;Glade we were the only ones to lose members of our family?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, I wish we hadn't lost any members of either of our families...&quot; Sarah replied. <br />
<br />
&quot;.... Same....&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh.. a little service here?&quot; MJ asked rather awkwardly as a dragon fly had decided to take <br />
up residence on the tip of her muzzle that she was unable to blow away.<br />
<br />
&quot;Coming.&quot; Sarah said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks Sasha.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;UGH!&quot; Sarah groaned. At least Alpha Female Kaylee, Ulysses and her close friends, never <br />
ever got her name wrong. <br />
<br />
+++++<br />
<br />
In Jensen's office (as it had been for over ten years) there was the book which had all the <br />
names of the active members of the pack written down. A similar 'book' was memorized by <br />
Mother Glen, some rumored she had the entire pride's current members written on her <br />
backside, though this might have been exaggeration.  Like Mr. P, Mother Glen was older <br />
than old, but didn't look it in the least. The myths and legends but real and fictional about <br />
her were on par with Mr. P! One rumor even said she had eaten a sect of the KKK alive <br />
when they had planned to burn down a church.  She said she'd never eat anything so foul <br />
tasting... but there was always that look in her eye when she said it.  <br />
