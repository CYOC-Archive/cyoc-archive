<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Josh spread her legs apart once more in front of the mirror, staring  into the pink cavern that had replaced her manhood. The pink cavern that&#39;s walls glistened with her new, natural lubricant, preparing to be entered in response to being turned on by her own reflection. Stupid pussy didn&#39;t even know or care that the reflection couldn&#39;t fill it, it just knew it wanted to fuck. Or maybe that Josh wanted to fuck, she couldn&#39;t really tell if her new hole had reacted to her or if she was reacting to it, but she felt so empty between her smooth legs. Her new walls were pulsing, trying to squeeze tight around the nothing that was currently inside of them. Wherever the feelings were coming from, Josh had decided to try and embrace herself as a female for a while, and for now that meant she wanted to get her cunt filled.<br />
<br />
And if she had that cunt, she shouldn&#39;t have to try too hard to get something in it, since she should now live in a world of easy sex. And in a world like that, who would say no to a babe like her? It was funny really, Josh had liked girls even when the other boys his age had thought they were gross, and after puberty had granted him a libido all he wanted was to fuck every pretty girl he saw. Now, in a world he created just for that purpose, she was heading out to have the first sexual experience of his 18 years, as a girl. And probably not even with another girl. She leaned back and played with her tits a bit while she thought about it, enjoying the new sensations and wondering why any girl ever slapped him for doing something that felt so good. She was definitely still interested in girls, that was obvious from the reaction she&#39;d had to her new appearance and the one she was having now, thinking about Stacy Pendleton&#39;s deep cleavage and round ass. &quot;Fuck. Giving myself the day off school was a mistake,&quot; she moaned and spread her legs further, suddenly eager to see a Stacy who would accept her requests for quickies between classes.  Of course, sex with Stacy now would have to be very different from what he&#39;d always imagined.<br />
<br />
And then she was remembering her time in the boys locker room. Thinking about the boys she&#39;d seen naked in there, and especially about the time he&#39;d seen Bryce Carraway&#39;s dick by accident. Something within Josh seemed to have changed along with his body, now she was just as turned on thinking about Bryce&#39;s toned abs and firm arms as she was by Stacy&#39;s bouncing tits and swaying behind. And the memory of his large, flaccid penis made her pussy twitch. Josh would happily have Stacy another day. For now what she wanted was some cock pumping into her.<br />
<br />
Josh stopped playing with her new toys, stood up and approached the side of her desk. Or, her new desk. The desk she had now was, like herself, much curvier and seemed to have a more friendly appearance to it. Something, she assumed, that appealed more to female sensibilities and matched her now pastel-painted walls better. It also seemed to be bigger. Before Josh&#39;s desk had been at about the height of his crotch, this one seemed massive though, as she stood in front of it, the top of her desk reached her belly button. Whether the desk was actually bigger or she was just that much shorter she couldn&#39;t tell, but apparently now she had two reasons not to worry about smashing her nuts on it like he had that one time. Next to the desk was a stool that put her at pussy height with the top of it. For a moment she couldn&#39;t resist rubbing herself on the corner, but as soon as she did she had to brace herself on the desk to stop her legs from giving out. So she decided to save that exploration for another time.<br />
<br />
On top of the desk Josh saw a picture of her and Stacy, both down on their knees over the top of some lucky boy, each with one hand on his shaft and the other on each other&#39;s asscheek, both smiling and licking him together like they were sharing an ice cream, and with his cum all over their faces. It was hard to tell with they angle of the picture and the way they were posing, but this Stacy seemed even curvier than the one Josh remembered. She was going to have so much fun with Stacy when she saw her at school tomorrow. Next to the picture was Josh&#39;s laptop, now bearing stickers of a cartoon dick and boobs in the shape of a heart, a pair of slightly parted lips, and the words &quot;girls know what girls want&quot; in a silly font with a little &quot;TM&quot; and a brand logo Josh didn&#39;t recognize. Further from the picture was a strapon belt marked with the same logo as the sticker. Finally Josh&#39;s eyes landed on a purse sitting at the far end of the desk. <br />
<br />
Standing on the stool, she had to bend over the desk, and nearly lay down on top of it, to reach the purse from where she was standing. As her tits squished beneath her she had a brief flash of some big stud claiming her from behind while she was posed like this, big hands on her hips or her ass and big dick stretching her cunt; as she pulled the purse back towards her, she had an inkling that it wouldn&#39;t be the first time she&#39;d been railed over the desk. After digging through what she was now sure was her purse (and removing periods from the world when she found a pack of tampons in it) she got out her wallet. <br />
<br />
Looking through her wallet she found out from her ID that the world now knew her as Jessica, she still had a debit account opened for her by her parents, and finally, she still had her bus pass. Josh loaded all the items back into her purse, added her cellphone from her nightstand, and prepared to go get that empty feeling taken care of.</p>
