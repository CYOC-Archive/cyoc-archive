<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kyle pet the dog that used to be his sister for a long time. Eventually, she fell asleep, perfectly content. All the excitement from playing outside must have tuckered her out. Kyle checked the time. It was only 9PM, but he doubted that he could wake Ally up before morning. She had always been a deep sleeper, and, for some reason, Kyle doubted that her transformation would change that. <br />
<br />
He pondered what to do. As much fun as it was to transform Ally, Kyle had no way to take care of a dog. He didn&#39;t own dog food or a leash, and nothing in the house was designed with pets in mind. He dimly noted that Ally had already managed to knock over a lamp on her way out the door for playtime. He quickly placed it upright, and collected Ally&#39;s torn up clothes. They were mangled beyond repair, and were promptly chucked into the garbage.<br />
<br />
Kyle turned his attention back to Ally. He still had one trigger left to try. Would she really go back to normal, and forget all of this? So far, the triggers had worked beyond his wildest expectations, but what if it was a one-way trip to dog-hood? Still, it was worth a shot. He stopped himself though. If she turned back into a human, she would wake up naked, with no memory of why she was naked. If she saw Kyle while she was like that, Ally would have a major freakout, and wouldn&#39;t let him anywhere near her. That would be problematic for any more doggy fun times.<br />
<br />
What if she slept through the trigger? That would let him off scot-free. He had to be sure she wouldn&#39;t wake up though. He whispered in his sister&#39;s canine ear.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Ally.&quot; There was no response. Well, at least words wouldn&#39;t wake her up, but the trigger might be special.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ve been a really Good Girl.&quot; Ally didn&#39;t wake up, but she started lightly panting. In her head, Ally was starting to have a really good dream about chasing squirrels. It was a good dream for a Good Girl.<br />
<br />
Kyle breathed deeply. She wasn&#39;t waking up at least, but he was still nervous. He couldn&#39;t put it off any longer. It was now or never.<br />
&quot;Okay Ally, Barbie Doll.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kyle backed up quickly as the changes took place. Her arms and legs changed first, going back to human size. Her fur receded into body hair, which quickly went down to normal levels. Her tail vanished quickly, while her ears went back to the side of her head, becoming more round each second. Her paws spread out, reforming into fingers and toes, giving her hands and feet once again. Her muzzle was the last thing to change, shrinking back into a human face. Her pointed teeth went flat, and her tongue shrunk to a reasonable size. Underneath her eyelids, her eyes went from canine brown to human white, signifying the end of the change.<br />
<br />
The reversion took less than a minute. Ally had gone from a German Shepherd, all the way back to a human. She was lying on the ground, naked, still perfectly asleep. Kyle noticed that she still had her tongue lolling out, although it was clearly human in nature. Kyle didn&#39;t want to be here when she woke up, so he quickly sneaked into his room. After all that excitement, he needed some sleep too. He laid down in his bed, imagining all the things he could make his sister do, before nodding off.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Ally was having an odd dream. She was chasing a squirrel for some reason. Even stranger, it was making her happy to chase it. She was low to the ground, running on all fours, chasing it around every nook and cranny. She didn&#39;t mind all the surprised looks she was getting. She had to chase the squirrel, and it was faster this way. Ally didn&#39;t know why she thought it was faster, but deep down, she knew this was the only way to chase a squirrel. <br />
<br />
She was barking at it, angry that it kept running away from her. If she was paying attention, she would have realized that she wasn&#39;t speaking English, but it didn&#39;t matter. It was the best way to express her feelings. In the dream, although Ally saw herself as human, she was clearly playing the part of a dog. Ally didn&#39;t notice or care. She happily panted, both inside the dream and out.<br />
<br />
After several hours of this, the dream squirrel finally manged to get into a tree where Ally couldn&#39;t reach. She tried climbing up the tree to no avail, before finally giving up in a huff. The dream&#39;s camera shifted around, giving the real Ally a view of dream Ally. The dream Ally was naked and dirty, but the real Ally could feel a wave of happiness emanating from the strange girl. It was the happiest Ally had ever felt in her life, and a brief flash of jealousy struck her. What did this dream girl have that she didn&#39;t? She was about to ponder this more, when the dream Ally barked one final time. As it barked, her dream-self transformed into her German Shepherd form, but Ally couldn&#39;t focus on that. The dream had ended.<br />
<br />
Ally woke up. Already the contents of her dream were fading away. It had something to do with squirrels? It felt like a good dream, but it was already fading from her consciousness. She groggily assessed her surroundings. There was a small puddle of drool left where she had left her mouth open. Gross! She dimly noticed that she was lying on the living room floor, and not her bed. Had she started sleep-walking? She stood-up and looked at the clock, noting it was 2AM. Ally was about to head to her room, before she suddenly realized she was naked! She quickly ran into her bedroom, slamming the door behind her.<br />
<br />
She put on her pajamas, trying to make sense of what had just happened. She dimly recalled being naked in her dream. Did that have something to do with it? Had she started started sleep-stripping? She shook her head. Something weird was going on, but she couldn&#39;t place her finger on it. She thought about what had happened yesterday. Her parents left, she mowed the lawn, and then... It was normal after that. Her memory had some gaps in it, but it didn&#39;t seem important right now. She yawned. Her odd dream had worn her out. She made sure to lock her door, before collapsing in bed. She could worry about it in the morning.</p>
