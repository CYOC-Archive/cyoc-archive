<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;If its all the same to you I shall remain here,&quot; Yuriko replied, the elderly wizard now standing shoulder to shoulder with her student as she glared at Evan and Morgan. Morgan&#39;s attack on her and Evan&#39;s sudden reappearance made her apprehensive to leave Darren alone. &quot;I&#39;ll be okay Ms. Yuriko,&quot; Darren assured. &quot;I think the fights over.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I doubt it boy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Darren turned, watching as Aiko and her men now exited Yuriko&#39;s home, their weapons trained on the renegade lycan sorceress. Gazing at the Yakuza and kitsune, he was shocked to see who stood with them. &quot;Misaki!?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Get out of the way Darren,&quot; Misaki snarled. &quot;They need to be punished for what they did!&quot; Darren was dumbstruck, the last thing expected was to see his girlfriend siding with the Yakuza. &quot;Misaki wait! I think she&#39;s giving up.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait,&quot; Misaki exclaimed, the teens eyes going wide with anger. &quot;You saw what she did to my uncle! Are you seriously going to try and protest her?&quot; Darren had no answer, his thoughts were still jumbled after the battle. Yes Morgan needed to face justice, but killing her seemed a bit extreme. Now, he began to notice two of the Yakuza now focus their weapons on him as balls of flame circled around Misaki. Was she willing to attack him to get to Morgan? &quot;Misaki,&quot; Yuriko called. &quot;What are you doing?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Defending my family Ms. Yuriko,&quot; Misaki replied. Yuriko paled, her face forming into a frown as she too now prepared a spell, her focus divided between the Yakuza, Morgan, and Evan.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aiko stop!&quot;<br />
<br />
Aiko now paused, glancing towards the forest as she noticed Kari slowly emerge. The black nine tail assisted by a rather large Emerald green tigress. &quot;Kari,&quot; Aiko snarled. &quot;How could you betray us? Helping Morgan. The wizard that blinded my brother!&quot; Aiko now leveled her rifle at Kari, the small red dot of her rifle resting on the kitsunes heart.<br />
<br />
The tigress snarled, useing her free arm to slam her rather large hammer into the ground. &quot;Stop aiming at my sister,&quot; she bellowed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Haley?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi Yuki,&quot; Haley smiled, Darren was a bit off put by the kintaros response, her voice had shifted from menacing and low to high and cheerful instantly. Now the massive kintaro growled at the Yakuza as she held her Warhammer aloft. &quot;Dont think I can&#39;t splat each and everyone of you with my yeet hammer,&quot; she called. <br />
<br />
&quot;And if she doesn&#39;t get you I will.&quot;<br />
<br />
Darren now watched as a red fox now emerged from behind Kari and Haley. Sporting a duster and two very menacing looking pistols, he had the appearance of a kitsune but was a bit more solidly built and possessing two tails unlike his kitsune sister. &quot;Do you really want to push your luck Aiko,&quot; Aaron threatened. &quot;The Morelands themselves said I was the best shot they&#39;ve ever seen. You really want to see what Caleb and Connor taught me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Kintaro brats,&quot; Aiko growled. &quot;I&#39;m not interested in whatever reformative justice your sister wants for her friend. She injured MY BROTHER. By the rules of the clan it is my choice as to the punishment.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And you wouldn&#39;t have that chance if not for me Aiko,&quot; Abolith called. Darren and the others turned, noticing the elf assassin now slowly getting to her feet. Abolith was slowly beginning to heal yet her wounds were still visible and gruesome. Darren noting the ragged tears in her shoulder as well as her torn clothing. Morgan had obviously done a significant amount of damage to her, the elf leaning on her son as she focused her gaze on everyone. &quot;I expect to be paid in full Aiko.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait there&#39;s a bounty on my aunt,&quot; Evan asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;No one was talking to you boy,&quot; Aiko sneered. &quot;In fact how are you even alive? The Catalyst destroyed your body.&quot; Evan simply shrugged, he still hadn&#39;t figured out how he had avoided death. &quot;Regardless,&quot; Aiko continued. &quot;Fukushu has already been informed of what has happened here. He should be here at any moment.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My dad is coming,&quot; Raiden asked apprehensively. Darren now looked towards the kit, seeing him nervously glancing around. It seemed he was worried he would get in trouble for following his mother, when in fact Darren believed Fukushu would be happy he was safe. What did concern him though would be Fukushu&#39;s reaction to seeing not only Morgan but Evan as well.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aiko,&quot; Morgan now called. &quot;Please I&#39;m sorry! I...I know what I did was shameful. After listening to Kari I realize I was wrong. I&#39;m...I&#39;m willing to turn myself into the kitsune for punishment.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you truely think I will let that happen?&quot;<br />
<br />
Morgan&#39;s blood ran cold as she listened to the deep voice behind her. It was a voice she both recognized and feared as she felt a blade now press onto her back. &quot;Fukushu!&quot;<br />
<br />
Darren watched as the nine tailed kitsune now surveyed everyone. Aiko and her people now angrily gazing at Darren and the others. Kari and her siblings glaring at Aiko and Fukushu, and Darren and Yuriko caught in the crossfire. Fukushu glanced to his wife, his eyes going wide as a sneer spread across his vulpine face. &quot;Abolith?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m fine beloved,&quot; she replied. &quot;As is our son. No thanks to Morgan.&quot; Fukushu growled, his eyes growing wide with hatred as he looked to behead Morgan. <br />
<br />
&quot;Not so fast Unc,&quot; Aaron said softly as he now pressed his pistol to Fukushu&#39;s head. &quot;My sis wants her taken alive so don&#39;t even think about!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dont hurt my dad!!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Relax kid,&quot; Aaron called, noting the look of fear on Raidens face. &quot;Your old man will be fine. Can&#39;t say the same for the rest of you if you don&#39;t back off!&quot;<br />
<br />
Darren gulped as all parties now trained their weapons on one another. The Yakuza targeting Kari, Morgan and her siblings. The Harris siblings targeting the Yakuza and Fukushu. Evan and Morgan anxiously glancing at everyone. And finally Darren and Yuriko assuming a defensive stance hoping to protect everyone. It was a standoff now, each party waiting for the other to make the first move.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey! Assholes!!&quot;<br />
<br />
All now paused as they noted a fat, white tabby cat slowly approach. Rexie now standing between everyone as she glowered at them. The cat now stood on her hind legs before speaking. &quot;Listen,&quot; she bellowed. &quot;I&#39;ve spent the last year and a half dealing with all of you assholes blowing up chunks of this yard. Do you have any idea how much groundskeeping is?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not an asshole,&quot; Haley protested.<br />
<br />
&quot;OH please Haley you&#39;ve always been an asshole,&quot; Rexie scoffed. The cherub now frowned, having gained everyone&#39;s attention. &quot;I&#39;m supposed to be enjoying my retirement,&quot; she exclaimed. &quot;Instead, each and everyone of you asshats keeps showing up, making a bunch of noise, and blowing something up!&quot;<br />
<br />
Darren wasn&#39;t sure where this was going, feeling indignant at being referred to as an asshole by Rexie. What he did notice was that instead of everyone being mad at eachother, their anger was now focused on Rexie. &quot;He blinded my brother cherub,&quot; Aiko sneered. &quot;It is my obligation to avenge him!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Avenge him,&quot; Rexie exclaimed. &quot;He never asked you too. Also I&#39;ve probably spent more time with him than you have over the last century. Pretty sure I have a better handle on this than you do.&quot; Aiko scowled, her eyes narrowing as she glared at the cat. &quot;Oh and tell your people to stop eating everything in the house! I&#39;m tired of opening the fridge and finding nothing to eat!&quot;<br />
<br />
Rexie now turned to Kari, the black nine tails watching the cat closely. &quot;Brilliant idea Kari,&quot; Rexie exclaimed. &quot;You ever think maybe cueing us in on your master plan?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I wanted to save my friend,&quot; Kari countered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah turned out real well,&quot; Rexie grumbled. The white tabby now turned,  glaring at both Evan and Darren. &quot;What did I do,&quot; they replied in unison.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re an asshole for coming back to life and not telling your mom,&quot; Rexie exclaimed gesturing at Evan. &quot;Yeah I know, really can&#39;t show up here and say surprise! Look who&#39;s still alive but at least tell her. She&#39;s your mom snd  I&#39;m sick of hearing her whine!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey not cool,&quot; Lynne replied.<br />
<br />
Darren gulped as Rexie now glanced at him. &quot;You couldn&#39;t of picked s different basement to break into?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry,&quot; he replied sheepishly.<br />
<br />
Rexie sighed, now turning her focus to Fukushu. &quot;Do I really need to go into detail about why you&#39;re an asshole?&quot; Fukushu said nothing, his eyes narrowing before shaking his head no.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay assholes listen up,&quot; Rexie stated. &quot;This is what&#39;s going to happen. Throw some chains on Morgan, go inside, and talk this out! And make sure you keep the noise down, it&#39;s time for my nap!&quot;<br />
<br />
All now watched as the cat familiar sauntered back inside before glancing at one another. Each was apprehensive of the other but they could agree on one thing. They each hated yet somehow loved Rexie.</p>
