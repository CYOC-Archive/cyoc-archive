<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Oblivious to how much he had changed, unaware that the changes went beyond simply physical but were also having an effect on his mind, specifically his thought process and his comprehension, Linus stood in front of tree and held his horse cock. Using it to make water, he stared off into the distance, for the first not making hooting noises. His thoughts moving rapidly from one thing to the next, he settled briefly on wondering where the mother the father and the sister might be, ruminated on what he and the girl with the face of a boy did and whether it was only possible to do it with Mathew or if there was ability to do it with another girl with the face of a boy, and then settled for a bit on the location of his plush.<br />
<br />
Finished with the need to make water, none of his questions answered, Linus looked down at the thing that made water. Noting that it did not go back into the sheath, but hung ponderously in a state that was somewhere between flaccid and erect, the young man wondered if when it had gone back into the sheath before it might have been a fluke. Starting to feel himself overstimulated with the amount of things troubling him and that he could see no way to address them, he found he wanted his plush more then ever. Turning away from the tree, his tail swishing back and forth, Linus stared at the trees around him for a moment before choosing a direction he thought was the right one.<br />
<br />
His gait a steady trot, the now nearly seven foot eleven 19 year old young man gazed about as he thought about what a great story all that had happened would make. Starting to move in a haphazard manner in an attempt to match Mathew&#39;s movements through the woods, he did not realise that, in the process, he was steadily moving away from where he&#39;d left his plush, his pyjamas and had last seen the girl with the face of a boy. Eventually coming back to the place he and Mathew started at, Linus gazed at the building, certain that it wasn&#39;t right he had ended back at it. Turning away after a moment, he took a step to begin walking away, but stopped when he noticed something he&#39;d never seen before.<br />
<br />
A good number of feet away from him stood what he took to be a funny looking horse. The thing, to the young man&#39;s way of seeing it, appeared to be a black horse with white stripes. Having never seen a zebra, not even in any of the nature magazines he read once in a while, Linus was unsure what type of horse he was looking at. Staring it, the zebra staring back at him, the 19 year old found himself starting to feel the same way he felt when around Mathew. Taking a couple steps closer, he was sure the animal would run away, as most did, but the zebra continued to watch him.<br />
<br />
When it came to people, he&#39;d never been good at reading their body language, let along their facial expressions. But now, as he swished his tail back and forth and stared at what he thought was a funny coloured horse, Linus found he knew what the animal was asking of him, even though it wasn&#39;t making any noises. With the mouth open and the ears flattened, the young man knew that, like the girl with the face of a boy, this horse was receptive to answer what he realised was another building urge. Taking another step toward the zebra, feeling the same sensation he&#39;d felt earlier when with Mathew, Linus suddenly stopped when the zebra turned, moved the tail to the side and presented its backside to him.<br />
<br />
Confusion at what he saw flooded Linus and suddenly he was faced with an over abundance of thoughts that made him freeze up. Somehow, he knew what the funny coloured horse wanted, as he found that he wanted it as well. Yet, staring at its backside, he wondered if he could, as it looked like the horse possessed both his equipment and the stuff Mathew had between her legs. Trying to recall if the young man had anything else, Linus found himself at a loss, as all he could recall was how good it had felt. Taking a step closer to the zebra, he stopped when the animal looked back at him. Reading the same signs as he had before, the 19 year old found himself flush with the same need, only stronger. No longer caring, wanting to only answer the call, he walked the last couple feet toward the zebra. Reaching the animal, he breathed deeply in its scent, smelling not only the smell of the animal, but also a rich, tantalising odour he was unable to define.<br />
<br />
Quicker than it had happened with Mathew, the connections were once again made. A series of nickers and neighs escaped him and Linus lay himself over the animals back. The zebra having no problem with a little over fifteen hundred pounds lying atop it, shifted to better accommodate the young man who was now probing at its backside with a horse cock that was steadily growing more erect.<br />
<br />
As his ears started to take on more of a point, Linus found himself confronted with even more clarity. As the curse took more of a hold and helped to guide him, the young man began to make the connections even faster. His erect dick finding the the slick folds of the zebra&#39;s vulva, he had a brief flash where he found he knew that, should this need come over him, there was another way it could be addressed without the odd coloured horse or Mathew. Neighing loudly, his excitement growing as much as his sudden understanding, Linus opened his mouth as wide as it would go, tossed back his head and as he peered in a sort of upward direction, he hugged the animal beneath him tighter and began thrusting.<br />
<br />
Stoically, the zebra, who had once been a human that had been altered by the curse, allowed the human with the build and male anatomy of a horse take it, satisfying the female urges that had come over it a couple days ago when its body went into its estrus cycle. Adjusting to match the, at first, clumsy movements, it made a sound of enjoyment every so often when the movements evened out and became more natural. The curse having long since burned out of its system, trapping the poor man in the body of a hermaphrodite zebra, there was no more changes except for the possibility of pregnancy.<br />
<br />
However, for Linus, there was the probability of changes. For as he humped the animal beneath him, sating an animal lust that had come over him, courtesy of the curse, his own body began to change. His ears, which had lost their roundness and taken on a more pointed appearance, began to move up the side of his head. As they took a position on his head, looking more and more like the ears of a horse in the process, complete with fur, the young man spit something out. Spatting more and more the same things out, he failed to understand that what they were, were his human teeth, which were being replaced by a set more appropriate for a horse. Slightly bigger, stronger, more suitable for grazing at grass and eating grains, Linus bared them in a dominating manner until, with a shrill neigh, he blew his load of horse semen into the zebra, satisfying both his need and the creature he still thought of as an odd coloured horse.<br />
<br />
Afterward, he slid off the animal and sat on the ground. His cock gradually returning to a flaccid state and sliding back into his sheath, Linus stared off into the trees, blissful, his mind making hundreds of new connections that he&#39;d been unable to before. A sound off to his right caused his ears to prick up and swivel slightly in the direction and hearing the sound of hooves galloping, he looked in the direction. Watching the zebra take off, he at first wondered if he had done something to scare it. Standing after a bit, the zebra now almost lost among the trees, Linus started to slowly follow. After a couple feet, he started to do a sort of lope, which quickly turned into a full-out gallop.<br />
<br />
Within moments, he had caught up the the animal. Neighing out to catch its attention, he matched its movement and for the first time in his life, he lost himself to simply doing nothing but running alongside the creature. No thoughts overwhelmed him. Nothing over stimulated his senses. The compulsive needs to follow strict routines left him. He found that, for the moment, he simply was content to gallop along side the zebra and that, judging by its facial features and body language, it didn&#39;t mind him at all and welcomed his company.</p>
