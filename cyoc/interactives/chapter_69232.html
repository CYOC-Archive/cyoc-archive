<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Shouldn't our bags have been here by now?&quot; Sharon asked rather confused that their luggage hadn't arrived yet. <br />
<br />
&quot;Check out the scratching posts. Who was here before must have really loved cats,&quot; Julie said observing that indeed there were large <br />
scratching posts in each corner of the room. <br />
<br />
&quot;Forget that, check out the size of the beds and chairs, are Africans really that tall?&quot; Derrick said looking at the furniture that looked made <br />
for people who were so tall they'd have to duck down through normal doorways. The door to the hall and the balcony were to scale of the <br />
furniture.<br />
<br />
&quot;All the people we saw in the lobby looked Caucasian to me son,&quot; John said. &quot;And I think this entire hotel is on a reserve. I wonder what <br />
paper work Jabari had to go through to allow people here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm use to welcome mints, not welcome beef jerky,&quot; Sharon said noticing the dried and salty pieces of meat on the pillow.<br />
<br />
&quot;Must be an African thing,&quot; Derrick shrugged. He went outside to take in the wild life he was sure she'd be able to see from the tree house <br />
hotel. He swore up a storm. <br />
<br />
&quot;DERRICK! LANGUAGE!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;MOM! DAD! JULIE! There's-there's-oh-man, what the friggin' hades, this ain't, dude!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Derrick you're not making any sense.&quot; Said Sharon said along with her husband. Julie was more interested in that while the room had a <br />
telephone (looking rather big like everything else) she wasn't able to find the cable TV yet. This place did have TV right? <br />
<br />
The mesh windows on the truck that had transported the family from the airport to the hotel hadn't made for easy viewing. And they had <br />
gone straight into the hotel before. Now they were finally seeing outside the tree hotel.<br />
<br />
The Anderson couple gasped with their son as they stared in shock and awe at what they saw outside below the balcony. <br />
<br />
African animals. But going around on two legs. And with opposable thumbs. But thing things got even more shocking as the family minus <br />
Julie saw what they were doing. Playing kick-ball, drawing in the dirt, sunning themselves, --reading a newspaper!-- Sharon nearly fainted <br />
when she saw a zebra and a gazelle debating the geopolitical situation, while a Hyena said that was not the sort of thing people should <br />
discuss while on vacation. <br />
<br />
John blushed and Sharon covered her son's eyes when she realized these animals also had human style hips and maternal material, while <br />
masculine trait was closed around with a sheath by many of the naked animal people outside. <br />
<br />
Derrick idly noticed a group of juvenile lions playing a weird form of free for all wrestling. <br />
<br />
The family stumbled back inside.<br />
<br />
&quot;Julie we're getting out of here now. And I'm going to have a long talk with Jabari!&quot; Said John.<br />
<br />
&quot;Say wha-? We just got here. Are there terrorists outside or something?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;No it's not that it's--&quot; John didn't get to finish as a wave of dizziness hit the entire family at once. <br />
<br />
Everything happened at once.<br />
<br />
The father John Anderson's cubby frame melted revealing riveting muscles covered in tan fur. He grew several feet ruining his pants and <br />
underwear and his new claws on his feet tore apart his shoes. His feet became digigraded as pads formed on his palms and feet. His balding <br />
hair became dark brown almost black and covered his head completely and circled around his head completely forming a mane. <br />
<br />
His eyes turned a golden color and became feline. His face pushed into a muzzle and gained whiskers as his teeth all became sharp. And <br />
couldn't forget the tail with the puff of fur on the end the same color as his mane that grew out of his spine between his rear. He let out a <br />
soft growl that wasn't human. <br />
<br />
Sharon also grew taller, to where she would have towered over John if he was still human, she went through many of the changes he did, <br />
through her fur was beige. She let out a cry of dismay and unhappiness as her hair fell out leading her completely bald. Like her husband, <br />
her ears grew more round and moved up on her head. Her eyes took on golden brown color as her figure became VERY muscular yet still <br />
feminine. Her womanhood actually remained the same size, now looking relatively smaller on her new body.<br />
<br />
On top of this shock, was how the two felt the years wash away from them, cutting their ages in half until both were twenty year olds <br />
opposed to middle age, this wasn't exactly noticed though among the changes of species and the complete ruination of their clothes leaving <br />
them both completely naked. Sharon had liked that blouse. <br />
<br />
Things only got weirder for Derrick and Julie. Their fur was the same color as their parents would with the genders reversed. Both their hair <br />
fell out, leaving them both with fur on their heads and nothing else. They were also getting shorter, smaller, even as their gained muscles <br />
and their bones rearranged themselves. It wasn't long before one seven year old, and one seven and a half year old were standing in a pile of <br />
clothes with only their shirts covering them. <br />
<br />
Curiosity overcame modesty as their torn them off, accidentally destroying them as they looked at their bodies in shock and confusion and <br />
looked at each other totally speechless. <br />
<br />
&quot;Sharon, Sharon are you alright?&quot; John asked protectively. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, yes dear I think, I think so,&quot; Sharon growled not sounding in blind panic as people would normally be. <br />
<br />
&quot;Jobari,&quot; John growled menacingly. <br />
<br />
Sharon noticed the phone, now perfectly scaled to her, and saw his personal number written next to it. &quot;I'll call me.&quot; She said more decisive <br />
than she remembered being and John found himself nodding at her decision. <br />
<br />
Sharon picked up the phone, a little clumsy at first, but then dialed in the number. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hello?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeaow! No need to roar! What's wrong?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;WHAT'S WRONG? YOU TURNED MY FAMILY INTO MONSTERS! THAT'S WHAT'S WRONG!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Calm down! Was their an accident? We've never had one before! Can you tell me what went wrong? I'll get the emergency team up there at <br />
once!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You turned us into animals!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You lost your thumbs and balance? I've never heard-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Made us animal people!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes. And?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;AND HOW COULD YOU?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well it wasn't really me, it was the tree for a big part, my elder brother's work for the next biggest part, though I did have to file the paper <br />
work and-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How could you do this your friend! John trusted you!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;... What's wrong? I thought you said you wanted to be lions for your vacation. When you didn't return information with the package I sent <br />
you but John said yes he'd love to and would bring his family, and when your son told me he wanted to study lions, I thought he meant-, I'm <br />
sorry what species did you want to be?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;HUMAN YOU SICK FREAK!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;...You're upset so I'm going to forgive that.&quot; Said Jabari icily. &quot;Now look. When I finally scrapped together the money to build this hotel, I <br />
thought of John first, I thought you'd all find it interesting.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And you didn't think to say anything!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It was mentioned in the first sentence of the disclaimer. And Twenty-eight more times after that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We . . . we didn't read it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And the process was explained, and the details and the species available were also explained in the packet I sent to you. You didn't get it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We... we thought that was an ad for a furry convention that made it into our mail by mistake and threw it out.&quot; Sharon rumbled, suddenly <br />
feeling very small.<br />
<br />
Jabari on the other end groaned. &quot;Great. Look, I'm very sorry, but unless it's medical emergency I can't make you human again until your <br />
vacation is scheduled to ends. Look, forget any bill regarding your stay. And a free second vacation to be spent any time in the future of your <br />
choice. I deeply apologize. I didn't think you wouldn't read the disclaimers, and I certainly didn't think you wouldn't so much as ready the <br />
first two sentences of the brochure. There's a copy of both in the first drawer of the desk between the beds. I'm very very sorry. This is the <br />
first time something like this has happened, we, we can talk later, I have to work to do that won't wait. I have to go now. Sorry.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;So now what do we do?&quot; The male adult lion asked the lioness, as was natural.</p>
