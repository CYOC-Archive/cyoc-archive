<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mary&#39;s cheeks blushed a whole new color of red, as Janice flashed her crotch towards her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Talk about an itch right?&quot; She told her friend.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my god Jen!&quot; Mary reacted. &quot;You grew a boy&#39;s- you grew a dong!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Crazy right? I never thought I&#39;d ever touch a boy&#39;s penis, even less I&#39;d grow one myself.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But you aren&#39;t a boy! How will you hide this from the others.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry about that Mary. I can tuck it way back, so that I can even hide a boner. I didn&#39;t grow any balls.&quot; She giggled again. &quot;Imagine that thing sticking out in front of me. This is all so crazy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re not embarrassed?&quot; Mary asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not really. It&#39;s crazy, sure. But everybody has changed. I might as well embrace it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You still got a vagina?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That too, yeah. I guess I&#39;m both sexes now?&quot; Janice thought for a moment. &quot;Although the doctor said I can&#39;t shoot sperm out of it, since I lack the other parts for that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mary gasped, as if she had been holding a breath.<br />
<br />
&quot;A-and, why is it hard?&quot; She muttered with a stutter.<br />
<br />
Now it was Janice&#39;s time to blush furiously.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well. It hasn&#39;t disappeared ever since your mom opened the door for me. And add up to that all of the excitement behind the change... I kind of understand Emma and her curiosity in the mutations. It hasn&#39;t really calmed down since I went up to your room.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You got excited by my mom? Are you gay?&quot; Mary asked, almost scared.<br />
<br />
&quot;No! Not like that. It had a mind of its own okay? Like, do guys call this a random boner?&quot; Janice wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jen, this wasn&#39;t random. It&#39;s okay though,&quot; Mary looked away for a moment, then muttered, &quot;I don&#39;t really mind it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Janice was almost relieved to hear she had calmed her best friend down a bit.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry about jumping this onto you. I just thought, if you told me about your change, it was only fair for me to do the same.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mary nodded, then winced. &quot;Still, showing it off like that is something different.&quot; She looked at Janice&#39;s crotch again, almost with lustful eyes, then up her best friend&#39;s body, ogling her attractive frame and chest for sometime longer. When she saw that Janice had noticed her stares, she looked away again, and said, &quot;can you tuck the thing away again? Please?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Right, sorry.&quot;<br />
<br />
_____<br />
<br />
The walk over to Emma&#39;s house was short. They lived not far from one another, so occasionally, their day went buy swapping places whenever their parents kicked them out of the house to &#39;go outside or something&#39;, in a pinball-esque way. Which was fine, really. It wasn&#39;t like their parents continuously monitored their activities outside of their own respective houses, or share anything with the other parents.<br />
<br />
Janice had left her house in a nice dress, mostly to make sure to cover herself up until she felt comfortable enough showing her bulge to everyone. P.E. was probably going to be a nightmare for her. She hoped that she was allowed to stay in the girl&#39;s changing room at least.<br />
<br />
Mary was wearing a dress as well, having changed into one with a similar pattern as Janice&#39;s so they wore similar clothes. Wearing a dress meant hiding her open crotch with harsh gusts of wind being the only concern, but today was completely silent, with a cloudless sky and the hot sun blazing above them.<br />
<br />
Emma opened the door for them after Mary had rung the bell. Her outfit looked much more sloppy than her friends&#39;. Her pants were the elastic type, so that they at least showed her attractive legs and shaped them up, she was basically a model, with her perky chest too. However, her chest was covered by one of the biggest hoodies Mary and Janice had ever seen on Emma&#39;s slender frame. And despite that, the two of them could clearly see movement underneath, and quickly come to a conclusion.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi girls,&quot; Emma said with a tired smile, &quot;come on in.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Jesus Mary,&quot; Janice gasped. Mary looked her way, but Janice hadn&#39;t intended it to be aimed towards her. &quot;You look like a wreck, Emma,&quot; she quickly continued. &quot;Have you had any sleep in the past days?&quot;<br />
<br />
Emma simply gave mock laughter. &quot;Hardly any.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Something to do with your mutation then?&quot; Mary asked, while she couldn&#39;t help but blush again, probably recalling her memory from earlier before.<br />
<br />
Emma nodded in affirmation. She motioned her friends to follow her upstairs. Once there, she lifted up her hoodie. She stood with only a bra on, and to her own surprise, Janice&#39;s excitement sprang up again.<br />
<br />
Emma&#39;s bulges from two nights ago had grown into arms, with hands attached. Said hands were fiddling with a small toy cube, one that had different patterns and textures on each of its six sides.<br />
<br />
What Janice noticed however, was that Emma&#39;s second set of arms looked to be only the size of a toddler&#39;s, a baby&#39;s even, one just recently born.<br />
<br />
&quot;Has your mutation not finished yet Emma?&quot; She asked.<br />
<br />
Emma barked out another laugh. &quot;It has, actually,&quot; she said, her voice all giddy and happy. &quot;These arms were basically born onto my body. But here&#39;s the worse part...&quot;<br />
<br />
She brought her normal set of arms behind her head, lacing her fingers together to hold them there. She looked to be concentrating.<br />
<br />
Mary and Janice followed the movements of the new set of arms, and grew gradually surprised as the toddler sized limbs started waving around wildly and then threw away the cube they&#39;d been holding.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oooh.&quot; Mary cooed.<br />
<br />
&quot;What? What did they do?&quot; Emma asked.<br />
<br />
Janice looked at her four-armed friend questioningly. &quot;You didn&#39;t do that?&quot;<br />
<br />
Emma smiled. &quot;Yeah, that&#39;s the point I tried to make. I can&#39;t control them in the slightest bit. It&#39;s as if they lead their own lives. Arms like toddlers stuck onto my body while I can&#39;t even control them.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mary snorted, then blushed. &quot;Janice also has a new addition she can&#39;t seem to control.&quot;<br />
<br />
Janice turned to glare at Mary, but then she huffed and crossed her arms. &quot;At least it&#39;s hidden.&quot;<br />
<br />
She squirmed slightly, feeling the appendages warmth and hardness against her thighs. It was moments like these where she wished she had a thigh gap like some of the other girls her age. Wholly unfamiliar moments, sure, but they were still those kinds of moments.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, you can&#39;t really say that about mine can ya?&quot; Emma butted in. &quot;Hey Mary can you throw me one of those things behind ya?&quot;<br />
<br />
Mary looked behind her, seeing various kids toys splayed on top of a desk. It looked kind of weird, looking at a desk filled with toddler items, as well as academic text books and piles upon piles of seemingly unorganized papers. She grabbed a fuzzy plush orb and threw it at Emma. Her friend caught it and took one of the new arms by the wrist, then handing it the plush ball.<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you doing that for?&quot; Janice asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Distraction.&quot; Emma stated matter-of-factly. &quot;It can&#39;t seem to keep its hands off of me sometimes, so I distract it with these toys.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, are you serious?&quot; Mary asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dead serious. If these toddler arms have a toddler brain behind them, guess where they&#39;ll latch on to first? Sorry for not giving you any hugs today darling.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No probs.&quot; Mary countered.<br />
<br />
Janice looked at Emma&#39;s desk again. &quot;Summer homework done?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah. Although it felt like I blew it. I hope these won&#39;t get marked. Wouldn&#39;t be a good start of the year.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hah!&quot; Mary laughed. &quot;Everybody&#39;s grades will plummet, I think. Unless not everybody was vaccinated.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fifty-fifty,&quot; Janice informed. &quot;I just hope there aren&#39;t any pricks who start discriminating those who <i>have</i> been vaccinated. It might cost them later, you know. With karma and all.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I fucking hope so.&quot; Mary exclaimed. &quot;What was with that Republican senator anyway?&quot;<br />
<br />
The conversation went on like that. School homework was forgotten, although mostly finish. The new school year would start soon. Janice wondered how the others had mutated. Emma more so.</p>
