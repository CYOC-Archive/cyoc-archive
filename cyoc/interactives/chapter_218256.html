<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Van walked into the office that housed the building&#39;s custodial crew only to be greeted with an overly chipper, &quot;Hey, Shortstack.&quot; The room was crammed full with one large desk for Clark, which was currently empty, and two smaller ones for himself and Rider, only given because of the need to fill out paperwork and maintenance reports. The greeting had come from Rider, who was kicked back in his chair with his feet on the desk. He was tall and lanky, had been taller than Van to begin with but now the height difference was glaring. His brown hair was a messy mop, and like usual he looked like he rolled out of bed fully clothed. Rider was a clear case of a burnout. He was insanely smart, but had dropped out of college to find himself. Now in his late 20s, he worked a dead end job, but spent his free time playing games and getting high, and he loved his life. <br />
<br />
Van wanted to grit his teeth at the nickname, but knew it was just Rider trying to be friendly. He was a happy and easy to get along with guy, but Van instinctively knew that was their relationship, friendly insults hurled back and forth, but not the quickest with quips, Van settled for a rather bland, &quot;Fuck off.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Rough night?&quot; Rider asked shifting to keep his gaze on Van as he took the chair at his own desk.<br />
<br />
&quot;Kind of. Where&#39;s Clark?&quot; Normally the eldest custodian would be perched at his desk by now, ready to bark orders at his two subordinates.<br />
<br />
Rider just shrugged. &quot;Oh!&quot; He started as he suddenly remembered something and reached a long arm out to Clark&#39;s desk to pick up a piece of paper to hand over to Van. &quot;Mr. Fields said to tell you he wants to see you in his office when you get in.&quot;<br />
<br />
Van blinked a bit dumbfoundedly. Mr. Fields was one of the company VPs, the youngest one. Only in his early thirties and something of a hot shot. If he needed custodial he would have just made a general request, but asking for Van in particular, &quot;Did he say what for?&quot;<br />
<br />
Rider shook his head, then shrugged. &quot;Clark took the call before he wandered off. Told me to let you know.&quot;<br />
<br />
Van sighed and stood back up, grabbing his keys and radio to clip to his belt. &quot;Fine, better go see what he wants. Let me know if you&#39;re ordering lunch today, I forgot to pack something.&quot; Rider just replied with a thumbs up.<br />
<br />
It was a long trip from their cramped room in the basement up to the second to top level of the building, but at least Van got to worry the entire elevator ride up. He had to check the nameplates on the few doors up here to find the right one, it was already open and Mr. Fields was inside.<br />
<br />
The office was impressive, all hardwoods and granite, enough room for not only his workspace, but a couch, a small coffee bar, and a few plush chairs, not to mention the floor to ceiling bookshelves, and a little indoor golf putting strip. Fields sat behind his desk, the windowed wall of the office behind him giving a wide view of the city. It was the sort of office Van had once hoped to have one day. Hell, Fields was who Van had been trying to be. Only in his early thirties, he was young for the position he held, but it fit him. His dark hair was perfectly coiffed, and he was just well groomed over all. Even his hands look manicured. He was cleanshaven and looked like he hit the gym just enough to make sure those designer bespoke suits fit him perfectly without putting on any actual bulk. Probably a home gym. He wasn&#39;t the type that would like other people seeing him sweat, even from a workout. He looked up, blue eyes locking on Van with a smile that showed teeth that probably cost more than Van&#39;s car.<br />
<br />
&quot;Van, right? Come in, close the door andtake a seat.&quot; Fields motioned to one of the chairs in front of his desk.<br />
<br />
Shutting the door behind him, &quot;You wanted to see me?&quot; Van asked as he took the seat, feeling very out of place in that office. Even showered and with a fresh change of clothes he felt grimy just being there.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes.&quot; Fields stood up and walked around his desk, leaning back against it with his arms across his chest once he was back in front of Van. His suit jacket was off and hanging from a coatrack in the corner, buy his slacks and crisp white silk shirt fit him perfectly, the tie clip and cufflinks he wore were polished to a sparkle. &quot;Something quite troubling has come to my attention.&quot; He reached over and flipped his monitor around.<br />
<br />
Van blinked with surprise. The pornographic image on the screen was not what he had been expecting. It took Van a moment to realize what he was looking at. It was a still of a webcam video. It was him, jerking off for tips to an anonymous internet audience. &quot;Shit.&quot; The word left his mouth before he remembered where he was.<br />
<br />
&quot;Indeed.&quot; Fields folded his arms again, but left the monitor as it was, glaring the image of Van jerking off at himself. &quot;Now, while we don&#39;t mind our employees making money on the side, there&#39;s one small issue.&quot; He let out a slight, &quot;Tsk,&quot; then shook his head. &quot;It might cause problems. Luckily your face is hard to make out, the only reason I know it&#39;s you is, well..&quot; He tapped a part on the screen, where Van&#39;s shirt was bunched up in his hand to show off his abs, but his sewn on name tag with the company logo was still quite visible. Needless to say, we don&#39;t want our company associated with, well, this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re firing me..&quot; Van said. It wasn&#39;t a question. It&#39;d be hard to find another job that could pay his rent, especially with a firing on his record for reasons like this. The cam show wouldn&#39;t bring in nearly enough. Maybe he could beg Paul for his spare room. His thoughts were interrupted by Fields, however.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, not this time.&quot; Fields flashed his grin again. &quot;I can bury it, keep you safe, if you do something for me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Van winced. This felt too much like dealing with Abaltis, but this was his job and he needed it. &quot;Sure, I mean, yes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Strip.&quot; The single word caught Van off guard, and he stared at Fields blankly. &quot;Strip.&quot; He repeated his voice even and level.<br />
<br />
Tentatively, Van began to undo the buttons on his shirt, earning him a smile and appreciative nod from Fields, urging him on. He stayed seated as he unbuttoned his shirt, exposing his furry, well-toned body, all the while those blue eyes were boring into him. Once he shrugged out of it he stood, undoing his belt and pants to let them drop to the floor. His boxers were next, naked, he stepped out of the the clothing bunched on the floor and pushed it aside with his foot.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s even better in person.&quot; Fields said with a look to Van&#39;s cock. &quot;Stroke it, get it up.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gulping, Van did so, his nerves made it a bit difficult at first, but soon his cock was responding to the steady even strokes. Fields lowered his hands and began to undo his own belt, opening his fly and pushing down his underwear to let his six inch erection free to bob in the air, the skin around it shaved clean. &quot;Suck it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Van paled, his job wasn&#39;t worth it was it? He&#39;d resisted Abaltis, surely this man couldn&#39;t make him. But he found himself getting down on his knees, taking Fields&#39; cock in one hand and guiding it to his mouth. He felt a hand rest on his head, as he tried not to gag. He had never sucked a man off before, and he wasn&#39;t sure of what to do. Fields took things into his own hands, gently bucking his hips at first and jabbing his cock against the back of Van&#39;s throat. &quot;Keep stroking yourself, you&#39;re going to enjoy this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You want some help, pet?&quot; Came a whispering gruff voice in his ear. &quot;No need to speak, just nod.&quot; Van made a soft noise and bobbed his head as much as he could.<br />
<br />
He felt his throat suddenly relax, he knew just how to move his tongue and lips. He began to work the shaft in front of him and Fields practically cooed. &quot;That&#39;s it. I knew you&#39;d be good at this.&quot; Fields continued to fuck Van&#39;s mouth, only needing a little assistance from Van himself, though he kept jerking himself off as instructed. He closed his eyes, tried to pretend it was someone else. Paul. That&#39;d make it easier. He wanted to do this for Paul, he realized.<br />
<br />
It wasn&#39;t long before he felt Fields&#39; cock twitching in his mouth. He tried to pull back, but the hand on his head gripped his hair and kept him there, forcing him to swallow the explosion of cum. At least Van had kept himself from coming. Fields pulled his cock free, and slapping it against Van&#39;s face, then tucked it away and did his pants back up. &quot;Good. I&#39;ll make sure this stays buried, for now.&quot; He flipped his screen around. &quot;You&#39;ll come when I call of course, but just to make sure.&quot; He pulled out his wallet and pulled free a hundred dollar bill, letting it drop on the floor in front of Van.  &quot;Now get dressed and get back to work.&quot; Most of the nice politeness had left Fields now, as he moved around his desk to take his seat again, pretty much ignoring Van&#39;s presence.<br />
<br />
Quickly, Van got dressed and headed to leave the office when Fields&#39; voice stopped him. &quot;Oh, and you can continue your side job, in fact, I&#39;d like it if you did. Just be careful what you wear from now on.&quot;<br />
<br />
Van didn&#39;t reply as he left, instead heading right for the stairwell, he took a few flights down to a floor he knew was empty, and right to the mens&#39; room. He turned on the faucet, splashing some water on his face, then leaning over to wash the taste of Fields&#39; cum out of his mouth. Pushing himself back up, he glared into the mirror. &quot;You said you&#39;d help.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I did.&quot; Abaltis said from where he now leaned back against the other sink, wearing that ridiculous slacks and tie combo again. &quot;You were dying on that rod till I crammed your head with the knowledge of how to take a dick without choking on it. You can try it on Paul later, you&#39;re welcome, pet.&quot; His smug tone made Van want to punch him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why didn&#39;t you do anything to him?&quot; Van asked, scrubbing his mouth with the back of his hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t have a deal with him. My magic only works on humans I have a deal with or am making a deal with. That&#39;s why you needed to agree, pumpkin.&quot; The new nickname irritated Van, but he knew better than to rile the fairy too much. &quot;Oh! Speaking of, I need to collect payment.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Payment?&quot; Van nearly choked. &quot;I didn&#39;t agree to any payment.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know, that was a bad move on your part. Leaves it open ended, lets me have what I want. I&#39;m still a little annoyed you derailed my plans for you today, so lets go with that.&quot; Abaltis stepped behind Van and reached around to roughly pinch his nipples through the fabric of his shirt. He felt twin pains and gasped.<br />
<br />
&quot;What did you..?&quot;<br />
<br />
Abaltis ignored the question. &quot;Hmm, I think you need more than that.&quot; He reached up and roughly grabbed at Van&#39;s ears, causing another set of small pains. When his hands came away Van could see metal glinting in his ears, a couple of rings through the cartilage of each ear and small spacers in his lobes. Van quickly unbuttoned his shirt and pulled it open to reveal metal glinting, steel rings dangling from each nipple. &quot;Yes, I think that&#39;s perfect, no removing them, they&#39;ll just reappear where they belong. We might add more later, I&#39;ll see how I&#39;m feeling. That will cover my help, so we&#39;re all paid up, pleasure doing business with you, pet.&quot; And with that, Abaltis vanished.<br />
<br />
Van sighed and redid his shirt. He pulled out his phone to check the time. Only seven more hours of work, but then a text popped up from Paul. &quot;Looking forward to tonight.&quot; He grinned, maybe it wouldn&#39;t be a completely shitty day.</p>
