<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The reversion of Alexa's transformation occurred as quickly as mine.  Within two minutes her werewolf form disappeared and she was back to being her normal gorgeous self.  It took another couple of minutes for her to wake up.  I waited patiently, unsure of what might happen.<br />
<br />
Alexa stirred on the floor and slowly sat up as she refocused her eyes.  She caught site of me sitting on the couch and saw that I was still naked.  She realized that she was, too, and instinctively reached up to cover herself, but stopped and put her arms down.  &quot;Joey,&quot; she said slowly.  It seemed as if she was still in a bit of a daze.  &quot;Wha-what...happened?  Was th...was that real?&quot;  She swallowed hard, afraid of the answer.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, it was,&quot; I answered.  I felt confident that my wish would erase any doubt from her mind and so I was truthful.  However I remembered that Alexa was someone who quit being a model simply because she had a strong will and mind of her own.  Was the ring really powerful enough to overcome that?<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow,&quot; she said hazily.  &quot;That was...just...&quot; her face slowly turned to a wry smile, &quot;...incredible,&quot; she finished.  &quot;How did that happen?&quot;  She stood up and walked to the couch, then sat down next to me.  I recounted the story of getting the ring and what it had done so far.  I told her about my desire to be a werewolf and how powerful the animal side was and how it took over so quickly.  She took everything in and didn't question any of it.  &quot;Where did I enter this picture?&quot; she asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wished for someone to knock on my door and become aroused by my change, which I only delayed for a few minutes,&quot; I explained.  &quot;I said I wanted the person to embrace being changed and be submissive to my wants.  I just said 'someone,' I wasn't specific at all.  It could have been the UPS guy or a stranger or anyone.  I'm glad it was you, though.&quot;<br />
<br />
She tilted her head and made a face.  &quot;I'm sure you were,&quot; she said.  &quot;I never thought of you as gay, even though you never hit on me.  So you honestly didn't use this ring as an excuse to get me to sleep with you?&quot; she asked.<br />
<br />
I shook my head and said, &quot;If I wanted just that, I'm sure I could have wished for that.&quot;  I paused and added, &quot;But I didn't.  You said you were coming over to ask me if I wanted lunch.  Weren't you planning on doing that already?&quot; I asked.  I honestly didn't know the answer.  Maybe she had planned it, but maybe she came on spur of the moment simply because of my wish.  After all, someone had to knock on my door within ten seconds.<br />
<br />
She looked up as if to search for the answer.  &quot;No, you're right,&quot; she said.  &quot;I thought about that at least ten minutes before I came to your door.  I guess I just answered the call.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So are you mad at me?&quot; I asked.  I had wished for whoever came to the door to be submissive to me, but I wanted her to have her own free will.  There was a reason I had never hit on her.  I thought she was too good for me in several ways.  She was clearly better looking than most girlfriends I ever had, but she also had a stronger personality.  I guess I was a little intimidated by her.<br />
<br />
She stood up and paced back and forth.  &quot;No,&quot; she said.  &quot;Something tells me that I should be because I didn't have a choice.  But I'm not.&quot;  She stopped pacing.  &quot;Wait a minute.  Didn't you say you wanted the person to be 'submissive?'&quot;  <br />
<br />
Uh-oh, I thought.  My word choice now worked against me.  &quot;Y-yea,&quot; I stammered.<br />
<br />
I tried to explain myself but she didn't give me a chance.  &quot;That's why I'm not mad at you!&quot; she exclaimed.  &quot;I can't be!  You've taken away my choice!&quot;  She appeared rather furious.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's not what I wanted,&quot; I said.  &quot;It was just...talking...the animal side...&quot; I couldn't explain myself at all.  Frankly, nothing was a decent explanation.  &quot;I didn't mean for that to happen to you,&quot; I said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Prove it, then,&quot; she said.  She had a demanding look on her face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Prove it?&quot; I asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh-huh,&quot; she nodded, &quot;prove it to me right now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;OK,&quot; I said.  I was terrified of the potential consequences of what I was about to do.  &quot;I wish you weren't submissive to me and retained your free will and ability to choose no matter what I might try to wish with the ring.&quot;  I gambled that by adding the last part of the wish she would believe my sincerity.  I waited, but she didn't say anything and still stared at me.  &quot;So are you mad at me now?&quot; I finally asked.<br />
<br />
She walked directly in front of me and bent over so that we were practically nose to nose.  Her face was still stern and hard.  I braced for her to slap me.  Suddenly her face melted into a smile.  &quot;Not at all,&quot; she said as she grabbed my face and pulled me close to her and laid a passionate kiss on my lips.  After our lips parted she backed up a few steps and explained herself.  &quot;Joey, you're too nice for me to ever get mad at you.  You were given a tool of incredible power.  You could have done all sorts of horrible things, but you didn't.  You're not a malicious person.  But, just for me, my god, Joey, that was the most incredible feeling I've ever had in my life.  Changing like that and you fucking me.  It felt so good I can't really describe it.  I want to feel like that again.  Whether you intended it or not, you gave it to me.  If this is me being submissive to you, fine, but I'm choosing to be.&quot;<br />
<br />
I was elated.  The wish gave me exactly what I wanted, even if not in the exact manner I imagined.  I stood up and walked over to her.  &quot;What now?&quot; I asked.</p>
