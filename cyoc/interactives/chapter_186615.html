<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You didn&#39;t sleep. But your avatar did. Or could present the illusion of sleeping. You thought about how you&#39;d never dream again, not really.  But you didn&#39;t feel a trace of regret. What was done, was done. Good or evil, only the future remained as it became the present.  <br />
<br />
Still, you entered a peaceful state of zen, letting yourself be one with the universe, a peaceful sense of all acceptable, all is as it is, and thus all is as it should be. This state of peace makes time feel as nothing. <br />
<br />
The priest at the chapel was clearly used to shot-gun weddings... but he still looked at you wide-eyed... he SAW what you were, but had said nothing. <br />
<br />
Before the crack of dawn, you allow Davy to leave first. He goes for the door... then stops, he looks back at you, and walks back into the bathroom, and washes himself. He walks out, still naked and goes into the rest of the room. You go back into you zen state until dawn... You come into the proper living room... Realizing you&#39;re naked yourself... you did rather tear apart the clothes your avatar was wearing in your night of passion. You&#39;ll have to do something about that. Where was Jem? She could have likely helped you. Well, if Davy was naked, not like he was going to exactly mind. <br />
<br />
The laws regarding public decency had fallen into chaos with the advent of the reveal of sapient ceatures who sense of modesty were VERY different from humans. <br />
<br />
You got into the living room. You hadn&#39;t had a chance to take in many details about the house yesterday during your wedding night. But you saw now the place was like a pigsty instead for the custom size business suit closet and a work space. But not for long. <br />
<br />
Davy was cleaning the small house at an insane speed, you&#39;d never seen such industrial efficiency outside of a robot assembly line. (If not for their endless supply of fanatical kobolds, now that magic was exposed, dragons might have been demanding their &#39;live time contract&#39; with their employees meant they had a legal right to upload their employees souls into golems with a minimum facade of free-will... So be thankful to the kobolds you guessed.)<br />
<br />
&quot;... Doing some spring cleaning dear?&quot; You asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;I was able to keep my original sense of self, and I don&#39;t think &#39;is this person useful as a source of wealth, or useful as a goblin&#39; whenever I lay eyes on something. But that was about it. <br />
<br />
&quot;Personal hygiene and living your living space clean simply... doesn&#39;t feel like anything to me. I know it DID, but now it feels pointless, even WRONG. I am still able to comprehend a sale-rep HAS TO look and smell clean and dress the part. Even if my suit itches now. ... And, since you&#39;re my wife, and this is my home, I understand as a human me being clean and this place being clean is important TO YOU. So I&#39;m able to work around the part of me saying there&#39;s no point in not sitting in my own filth. <br />
<br />
You wondered how to break to your husband that you weren&#39;t human. Not that it made any difference. <br />
<br />
&quot;You work from home?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;When I&#39;m able. But not as often as I like. My lawyer is fighting to get me my retirement pension NOW since I&#39;ll have died of old age by the time I&#39;m legally old enough to get it. And explaining to the court this isn&#39;t a medical condition, it&#39;s now my natural state.&quot; <br />
<br />
You hear noise of banged bowls and spilled cereal. You didn&#39;t know the layout of the house, but you know what the most logical answer was. <br />
<br />
Someone was in your house&#39;s kitchen. Davy moved ahead first, you followed calmly behind him, giving you a good view of his shapely green rear. <br />
<br />
The kitchen was a mess, and not just from Davy seeing no point in cleaning up. Someone was sitting on the table... reaching a filthy hand into a box of cereal, and stuffing it in her mouth, kicking her legs off the leg, and chugging milk from the carton. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hi little brother!&quot; She waved. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hello Roxy,&quot; Davy said. <br />
<br />
She grinned, showing thick rows of long needle like fangs. Her triangular ears large and wide, supporting their own weight. Her red eyes gleamed like rubies. Her hands and feet larger in comparison to the rest of her body with claws clearly visible on both. She had a button nose. She body was short, squat, and deceptively muscular for her size that could tear an animal limb from limb. <br />
<br />
In other words, she was goblin like Davy. But unlikely Davy she was most definitely female. Her breasts were the size of melons, she was a short stack, like any goblin. She was also just as naked with her rubbery green skin exposed to all. She was wearing two sets of gold earrings on one ear. She was also wearing a gold collar, a gold chain was around her waist to carry her things that hide absolutely nothing. She wore also random gold rings on her fingers and toes.  She also looked and smelled like she hadn&#39;t had a bath in forever. Her wild red hair tied up in a tight ribbon behind her head. The same colored hair as Davy. <br />
<br />
&quot;Who&#39;s this?&quot; She gestures at you. <br />
<br />
&quot;This is my wife, Brianna. We married just last evening.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;And you didn&#39;t invite your own sister to your wedding?! How rude!&quot; She huffed like a child denied a lollipop. &quot;Then again, I&#39;d heard You haven&#39;t even tried to convert our parents.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They&#39;re too old sis&#39;, they&#39;ll die if the potion is used on them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then they&#39;re not worth thinking about.&quot; Roxy said nonchalant. <br />
<br />
&quot;You loved our family,&quot; Davy said sadly. <br />
<br />
&quot;I have a new family I love very much instead! And happy you&#39;re a part of it! You haven&#39;t visited your new nieces and nephews. I&#39;ve had my second litter.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The first thing you did after they were born was exposure them to the goblin indoctrination magic,&quot; Davy said matter of fact.<br />
<br />
&quot;Like duh! Our lives are too short to be bothered with doubt and confusion or questioning our place in things. It&#39;s a blessing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s the potion saying that, Roxy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why do you waste time stating the obvious? Of course it is! I don&#39;t NEED to WASTE TIME thinking about ideology or what to do with my life or whether something is &#39;right&#39; or &#39;wrong&#39; I just need to think about how to make goblinkind RICHER, how to bang, weed out the losers, and getting replacement goblins ready for when my time runs out.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh Davy, our brief lives mean nothing, only the Great Vault and the Goblin King&#39;s will mean anything.&quot;  She reached between her breasts, and pulled out a clear but dirty bottle filled with green smoke, she threw it right at you. <br />
<br />
&quot;ROXY!&quot; Davy shouted trying to block her throw. The jar landed right at your feet. <br />
<br />
The glass didn&#39;t shatter, instead the cork popped off and the thick green smoke rose and surrounded you with a will of its own, invading every opening of your avatar. And... nothing. A curl of smoke twisted like the smoke twists like it was looking at your confused... then like a film in reverse the smoke pulled back into the jar, the cork squeezed back in. You heard the yelping of a scared dog, the jar leap back into Roxy&#39;s claws like a backwards throw. <br />
<br />
Roxy looked at you bewildered. Roxy bolted out a window without a word or a look back. <br />
<br />
&quot;Britty! Are you okay!? Do you feel any different at all?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No... I&#39;m fine... I doubt that sort of thing could affect me. I&#39;m... unique.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank God... Please... don&#39;t hate Roxy... she doesn&#39;t have much life left to live anyway,  she shouldn&#39;t have to spend it imprisoned even if she is brainwashed.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I understand.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;... Do you think goblins are evil?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, the goblin SYSTEM is evil. Most aren&#39;t even a choice!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good, you&#39;re learning.&quot; Jem said suddenly besides you two. <br />
<br />
&quot;Who are you?! Wait! You were with Britty last evening. I... &quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I took her to that club to get laid, and things went better than I ever expected.&quot; <br />
<br />
You wondered if this was more of Jem&#39;s orientation. <br />
<br />
&quot;You may be on your honey-moon but count this part of your orientation.&quot; Jem said simply. <br />
<br />
&quot;Honeymoon! Yes! Sorry Britty! With my connection, I can get tickets anywhere.&quot; He went to his computer and began looking up spots.  <br />
<br />
He cringed at the ad software showed an add for underground Goblin City showing a dancing naked female goblin with the slogan, &quot;We&#39;ll take good care of your family while you have fun!&quot; Davy shuddered. <br />
<br />
Next was an add for Fairyland, the domain, not the themepark, showing unicorns, and fairies of every type. With a small warning saying &#39;beware of unseelie.&#39; <br />
<br />
You were surprised to see an ad for Rome and Vatican City. <br />
<br />
And a large logo for Tokyo, the heart of magical girls world wide. And a warning. <br />
<br />
Warning, know difference between kumiho and kitsune (could save your life):<br />
 <br />
kumiho, predator who feeds on human hearts. Always have nine tails from birth to death. <br />
<br />
Kitsune, extremely devious trickster, prankster, etc. HAVE TO add a twist to any help they give whether they like it or not. <br />
<br />
Ninetail kitsune, insanely powerful magic user, who could turn your house into a pizzeria and you and your family into robot-fox maid dolls without even trying. One tail kitsune, slightly more magical than a birthday magician, please be nice at their inept pranks. <br />
 <br />
<br />
&quot;Jem was grinning, ear to ear and whisperd in your ear. &quot;I did sense it was like there was someone with you, and I don&#39;t mean your husband. Congratulations, dearie. Your avatar is gonna be a mommy. Celestial-goblins, this is gonna be a new one for the Big Book of Magical Hybrids (and yes that&#39;s a real thing). So told your husband yet he made love to an angel?&quot; <br />
<br />
You weren&#39;t shocked so much that you were compatible. Orcs, elves and dwarve had been interbreeding with human for centuries, and mixing with humanity and each other, those that hadn&#39;t, were those unable to. You were shocked that your avatar was capable of procreation!</p>
