<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">     &quot;Dust.... what exact orders did Master Harauphar give you?&quot; You asked?<br />
<br />
     Dust looked at you with an odd experession before answering with a tinge of curiosity in his voice. &quot;Well, he ordered me to guard and observe you for any signs of wild or infected behavior. Master also gave me permission to restrain you and place you in the jail cell down in the basement if need be.&quot; <br />
<br />
     You nodded, an idea coming to light in your head. <br />
<br />
   &quot;Well I have a small idea, I want to try and.... test out my new &quot;capabilities&quot; by returning to the infected area where Master Harauphar originally found me. If you come along with me then neither of us will be defying him or his orders would we?&quot;<br />
<br />
     Dust looked at you with a surprised look, as if shocked you would even think that.<br />
  <br />
    &quot;No, no that&#39;s just impossible. While I understand where you are coming from I have orders to guard you while Master Harauphar is gone. Going back to the infection could possibly make you lose control or possibly even mutate you further!&quot; Dust exclaimed, stamping a paw down forcefully, as he did you noticed a small amount of wind pick up, slowly growing in power.<br />
<br />
    &quot;Whoa Dust. That&#39;s why I asked you come with me. Think about it, If I would&#39;ve turned into a crazed mutant fox creature I would&#39;ve by now. Besides wouldn&#39;t Master Harauphar be interested if he learned more about what I can do?&quot;<br />
<br />
     The wind slowly started to die down as quickly as it had picked up as you watched Dust process your words with utter attention.<br />
<br />
   Dust gave a small sigh before looking up at you and saying &quot;Very well, you make a fair point, I&#39;ll help you but know that if you show even the slightest sign of malicious intent towards me I will put you in your place. I may seem like a little cat but believe me, there is a reason why Master Harauphar has me as his familiar.&quot; Dust said, the last sentence having the threads of intimidation. You gave a small gulp. <br />
<br />
     &quot;All right Dust I understand, I promise that nothing will go wrong.&quot;<br />
<br />
    &quot;Very well. Let&#39;s make our way now.&quot; Dust said, suddenly dashing into the forest at full speed, a flash of gray and white, moving more quickly than even the fastest car in your world. You move out as well, running on two legs and while you eventually manage to catch up with Dust you clearly see that Dust was clearly slowing down now for yourself. In a race of speed Dust was clearly the faster one. <br />
<br />
      Unlike last time, you and Dust manage to get to the Corruption much quicker than before, mainly due to you purposely traveling towards it.<br />
<br />
     You both stop at the very border of the corruption, watching even now as purple sponge like mushrooms slowly infect the ground, plants, and air, turning pure green leaves to purple mutated versions of their former selfs.<br />
<br />
         Around you and Dust, were several infected animals, their purple glowing eyes ignoring you and directly starring at Dust. Strangely, even though you knew this Corruption was twisted and unnatural, you felt a calming sense of familiarity with this place, you even felt kinship with the animals around you, - strange connection that seemed to be stronger than blood itself. <br />
<br />
    The animals which mainly consisted of rabbits, birds, squirrels, and the occasional stray dog or wolf began to slowly stalk closer to Dust, ignoring you completely.<br />
<br />
   Dust noticed this immediately, also making sure to keep a close eye on you as well.<br />
<br />
         &quot;Well Wraith, if you want do something then do it now, or else I&#39;ll have to blow these fiends away.&quot;  Dust said, giving a cat like growl to several rabbits that edged to close.<br />
<br />
          Soon, both of you were trapped (or atleast Dust was, you were pretty sure you could freely move around them and they wouldn&#39;t give the slightest reaction. )  within a small semicircule of infected animals, several of them having large mushroom structures on their backs producing corrupting spores into the air.<br />
<br />
          Taking a deep breath, you concentrate, not really sure what you want to do. Activating your soul sight, you examine the souls of the animals around you. Interestingly, you could not see the individual souls of the infected animals, instead it was like a mesh of different shades of purples and violets. The only souls that stood out were yours which was a mixture of purple and green and Dust which was a combination of blue and gray. <br />
<br />
      You look at the single purple entity that made up the entire group of Corrupted animals and try and will them to stop. Nothing happens. You try even harder, to the point where you feel yourself begin to black out as your try and expert your magical energy towards them. <br />
<br />
       You deactivate your soul sight and take a gasp. Realizing that in your moments of being blind, that the animals were dangerously close, with Dust being close to do something drastic as well, the air around him beginning swirl into the shape of a tornado, several of the animals backing off but most of them ignoring the winds.<br />
 <br />
              In frustration you give out a large roar, and instinctively giving out an invisible force of magical will. Dust looked at you in surprise as you roared, thinking that you had possibly turned. Dust was about cast a spell when you held up a hand to him and calmly said wait.<br />
<br />
    Concentrating once more, you feel that this time, a connection was made. Willing the animals to stop. Almost instantly all of the animals stopped in their tracks. <br />
<br />
             Dust looked around around in surprise. The animals made no move closer. <br />
<br />
            This time, with not as much force, you will the animals to back off and form a small line facing you.<br />
<br />
         The animals do just that, horizontally lining up in order of largest to smallest, a placid expression on their faces.<br />
<br />
    Grinning now, you mentally order them to do a variety of actions, from rolling onto their bellies to even making them stand on two legs to the best of their abilities.<br />
<br />
      The animals obeyed everything you told them to do.<br />
<br />
        Even the Corrupted plants seemed to follow your will. The mushrooms on the grounds and trees alike moved and shifted like liquid, forming any intricate patterns you willed them to.  They moved as if they were animals themselves obeying every command just like the rest.<br />
<br />
   As you messed around with the animals, Dust keenly watched you and your actions. Studying every expression and movement you made. You heard him murmur and mumble to himself several times. <br />
<br />
      &quot;So... do you think this is still dangerous?&quot; You asked whilst making the animals do a makeshift conga line.<br />
<br />
      &quot;No... instead I have to apologize for not trusting you, it seems like this was quite the splendid discovery. Not once before was there any evidence showing any traces of intelligent actions aside from basic pack mentality. Perhaps it is because the animals themselves, however corrupted they may be, are still animals and do not have any major human intelligence. That would be supported by the fact that humans cannot be infected.&quot;<br />
<br />
    &quot;So what your saying is that because I am a sentient creature I can exert my will on these Corrupted animals without any resistance?l you ask.<br />
<br />
   &quot;Precisely, though I doubt you would get the same results with another Corrupted area, each Corrupted area is basically it&#39;s own organism so there has been documentation of Corrupted animals from different &quot;families&quot; shall we say fighting each other for dominance.&quot; Dust explains. <br />
<br />
    &quot;So then, what do we do now?&quot; You ask, glad to see that Dust seems to trust you now.<br />
<br />
     &quot;Hmm, I suggest we observe further. You seem to control these animals as expertly as you can your own hand... so I have an idea.&quot;<br />
<br />
   &quot;What is it?&quot;  You ask.<br />
<br />
   &quot;Corruption usually spreads quite quickly from multiple ways from direct contact with an infected animals, large amounts of spore inhalation, and can even be spread through sexual intercourse... so my question is if you bring one of your animals here, can you will it to not infect me?&quot; He says.<br />
<br />
   Your eyes widen at this, it was risky enough to come back here, but to willing risk infecting oneself for.... science? (Or Magic).<br />
<br />
   &quot;You sure about this, if you get infected you might not become as sentient as me.&quot;<br />
<br />
   &quot;I am aware of the risks and regardless I want to take the chance, besides I trust you enough to go through with it, also... if I might add, the chance of getting opposable thumbs is quite appealing.&quot;  Dust jokes. <br />
<br />
        &quot;Alright then, here it goes...&quot; You say.<br />
<br />
              The animals who were still doing the conga line suddenly stopped in their place as you will one of the animals to approach. You stop yourself from laughing as by chance the animal that you had willed forward was a corrupted housecat the same size of Dust, you can&#39;t help yourself this time as you give out a loud dog like bark of laughter as you realize that the cat was definitively female.<br />
<br />
    You saw Dust blush as apparently in his eyes, despite its Corrupted features it was apparently a very beautiful feline in Dust eyes. A tinge of mischief sparkled in your eyes as you willed the housecat to seductively begin rubbing itself against Dust, making himself blush even more as you willed the cat to begin licked all over Dust, from his face and even his nether regions causing his barbed penis to emerge from his sheath. <br />
<br />
   Dust began panting even more, struggling to restrain himself as you realized that somehow you made the female cat begin producing pheromones that were clearly have their effect on Dust and itself. You could see that the cat&#39;s pussy was moist and wet and strangely through your connection with the Corrupted cat, you were started to get aroused as well, your purple dick starting to rise up as well.<br />
<br />
      You continued having the cat rub itself against Dust as you watched to see whether or not Dust would get infected.</p>
