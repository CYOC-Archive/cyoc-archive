<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Part 5<br />
<br />
<br />
Day 3 of being trapped in his father’s body, Aaron woke up to his alarm, stumbled out of bed, rubbed his stubble and yawned. It was so unbelievable. He actually got to be a grown up for a whole week. But things hadn’t gone as expected. He had not only inherited his father’s body, he had to pretend to be his father at work! Aaron had to fill in and dad’s promotion was on the line. There were so many new things filling his head he felt like he barely had time to think. His reactions were all pretty slow, like everything he did took a few seconds to process before he could do it.<br />
<br />
When he remembered that he wasn’t getting a ride today from Jimmy, Aaron called a cab. It had been fine last night, and then he had…had kissed Geoff from MorphCorp on the lips! It was like in the movies, only this time it had been two men kissing and Aaron knew what that meant. It meant he liked men. He was pretty sure he liked women, too. He had crushes on girls when he was in his old body. But they just sort of sometimes made him feel funny and shy and awkward. It was different being in this body. In this body, he could do adult things. Things like fuck, have sex, get a blow job. He had looked up all sorts of stuff the night before when Dad was asleep. He hadn’t talked to Dad about any of this but he knew that he liked all of it. Being big and muscular and naked was one thing. It was a sensation like nothing he’d ever had, but the cumming, when all the white sperm just squirted out of his new dick...it was like another planet of pleasure he’d never been to before. It was SO overpowering. It made him so happy and he couldn’t wait to do it with a hot guy. Maybe a woman if he wanted to practice beforehand. He liked how women were real little compared with him because it made him feel all the more muscular and powerful. It was so much to feel so soon. <br />
<br />
He didn’t know how to talk to his father about what he was experiencing, so he just didn’t say anything. Just a few days ago he’d just been a kid and he had never had to deal with kissing anyone. Now that he wanted to, he mainly wanted to kiss guys. Just like his dad. Aaron knew his father was gay and it was no big deal to him, but dad had never dated or brought guys home or said anything about what sex was like, even. And now it was all he could think about? Was he gay or just his father? Did it matter? He wanted to kiss Geoff, so he did. It felt good. It made his new cock throb hard and flop against his dress pants. He could feel it, flop flop flop. Just banging around between his legs, this enormous fuckstick. He’d never had to deal with having a big cock that created a big bulge down there before and he was having…problems keeping it from getting too excited. <br />
<br />
Getting ready for his day, he felt his chest hair tenderly and looked in the mirror. Gingerly the curls of hair touched his fingertips. <br />
<br />
“I wish I could stay like this.” But he knew he couldn’t. Better just make the best of this week. He shrugged happily and skipped off to put his new grown up clothes on. His dad, who was bleary eyed from sleep, entered the room as he was getting ready to leave.<br />
<br />
“Hey, dad! I’m taking a cab to work today. I have a lot to do so I might be late. If you need anything, call Claire in reception. You know Claire? Oh right, you work with her. Geez, sorry. So, I figure I’ll be home as soon as I can and if you need anything really badly just call your..er..me on the cel phone. That’s yours, but that I have.”<br />
<br />
“I get it,” Jake said, yawning, and stretching his small frame. He was wearing XMen pajamas with Wolverine on them. Jake sort of resented wearing images of such a masculine guy…it was just one more reminder of what he wasn’t anymore. No muscles, no ability to look cool or wear leather. Or smoke or drink.<br />
<br />
“Okay. Okay. Okay,” said Aaron really flustered and stuffing various papers into his briefcase. His dad’s but now his briefcase. This was so confusing! <br />
<br />
“Son, are you sure you’re okay with all of this? We can call it off and pull some excuse out of the air…say I’m real sick and you have to take care of me.”<br />
<br />
“Nooooooo, dad! I can do thiiiis!” Aaron stomped his foot and whined. It didn’t look becoming on a grown man wearing a business suit. Jake made a frustrated noise. <br />
<br />
“Fine. Just don’t do that at the office. Try to act like a mature young..er…older man. Pretend to be me. Try acting like me.”<br />
<br />
“Jeez, dad. That’s what I’ve been doing. It’s not that hard! I’m around you all the time, after all.” Aaron adjusted his tie. “Well, son. I’m off for work! You be good and don’t get into any trouble.”<br />
<br />
“Very funny.”<br />
<br />
After his son left, Jake wandered over to the kitchen. What was for breakfast? Cereal would be good. He had to climb all the way up onto the counter to get it. Maybe I should just put the cereal down on the bottom shelves for now, he thought. Turning on the TV, he began to wonder about the transformation his son had undergone. It seemed like for all intents and purposes, Aaron was picking up things while in an adult body. When Jake and his own father had switched places, nothing like that had happened. He had gotten to stay home. Something about interacting in an adult environment must have switched on some magic that otherwise wouldn’t have gotten switched on. Ugh. All this thinking about switching is making me nauseous. Or maybe I just need to eat something that isn’t cereal. Maybe some Skippy peanut butter. <br />
<br />
Jake had noticed his new food interests were those of his son. Perhaps he was being affected by being in his son’s body as well. He had no desire to eat spinach or make any of the fancier recipes lining the cookbooks all along the kitchen shelves. That just seemed like too much work now…<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, in the cab, Aaron was checking out the cab driver – a scruffy twenty five ear old with a scraggly goatee. Aaron kept picturing himself mesmerized and naked with him. And then…<br />
<br />
“We’re here, man.”<br />
<br />
“Oh..uh…thanks. You can keep the change.”<br />
<br />
Walking down the street by himself was such a strange experience. He wasn’t trailing behind anyone or looking up at people constantly. He was bigger than most people now. The sudden importance of this made him smile with satisfaction, and he tugged at his lapel. He looked at his reflection in a local store window and said to himself “I’m so fucking hot now!” Smiling stupidly with not a care in the world, he loved every minute of merely looking at his own image.<br />
<br />
He also realized he could go and buy things for himself. Whatever he wanted. He didn’t really want anything right now, but…wait a minute. Video games! He could totally buy the ones he’d been wanting now! He ducked into the game store and quickly found a bunch of M rated games. All of them involved shooting and violence and even nudity. Then he realized other things he could buy. He could buy a hunting knife for camping. He could buy porn mags even! Oh, yeah. That would be awesome. But he’d do it after work or he’d be late. Bringing up an armload of games, he handed over one of his credit cards to the clerk, who said “Wow. Be sure to enjoy all of those.”<br />
<br />
“Oh, I will!” he said happily and ran out the door, pleased as a lark. The way I figure, he thought, dad owes me for doing this. So this is like, my payment for helping him out. Ebullient, he went to work. Everything just made him feel good. Walking into rooms filled with adults and no kids and not having to feel weird about it. Getting looks of envy or lust. It was odd because where before he never would have noticed that sort of thing, now he picked up on it right away.<br />
<br />
Getting to his office, he stowed the games in his desk, and began working on calling various people, to set up meetings. Mostly what he had to do today was conference calls, which were pretty boring. He listened while other people talked and chimed in to give information about his company’s products here and there. But mostly he put his face in his hands and smooshed his cheeks in a bored fashion. Finally when he was done, Jimmy came in. <br />
<br />
“Hey, Jimmy!” Aaron said, remembering to call Mr. Bentley by his first name. <br />
<br />
“Hey, bud. So here are the spreads for the new ads. Go over them and tell Mortimer what you think. Oh, and we’re all going out to lunch today with the old men from Morph Corp. We want to keep an eye on these guys until the deal is done, which should, by the way…be Tuesday!”<br />
<br />
“No way! That soon? So they definitely won’t be going with anyone else.”<br />
<br />
“No, man. Word is the big boss wants to make sure you can oversee this merger and if you somehow manage to make everyone happy, we’ll become one big corporate family in just a few months. Congrats. That promotion should be in the bag as soon as they come in to iron out all the kinks, which you’ll be in charge of. YOU have to make sure it all goes smoothly.”<br />
<br />
“Awesome! Wow! This is so cool!”<br />
<br />
“Yeah. Wow, you sure have a lot of excitement. Wish I had that much energy. Maybe you can tell me what to do for that.” Jimmy slipped his hand around Aaron’s butt and squeezed gently and then slapped it. “See you at lunch, bro.”<br />
<br />
Aaron smiled to himself. What was up with that? Did dad and Jimmy get it on? Or not. It might be just playful adult stuff. It could just be because they’re friends. Or more than friends. This was so confusing! Suddenly, the phone rang.<br />
<br />
“Hello? Aa-uh Jake Sanders, marketing.”<br />
<br />
“Hi, little brother!”<br />
<br />
“Aunt Katie?”<br />
<br />
“Don’t Aunt Katie me, you haven’t called me for a month. I just came over to see how Aaron was doing. I heard he was sick when I called your office the other day.”<br />
<br />
“Oh! UH…you’re with him?”<br />
<br />
“No, not anymore.”<br />
<br />
“Oh,” Aaron said relieved.<br />
<br />
“No, I dropped him off at school this morning.” Aaron’s eyes widened. <br />
<br />
“You WHAT?”<br />
<br />
“Don’t get upset. He was totally faking. Remember when I used to fake getting sick at that age? I know he’s faking. So I took the little bugger to school in spite of his protests. Oh, he was so mad! But he’ll get over it, it’s just school and he has to go. I mean, winter break is around the corner. Anyway, I just wanted to check in. Hey, I got a new set of horses…I was hoping you could come over and see them. One poor thing was gonna get shot because of a bum leg. I’ll use him for riding lessons when he’s healed, for younger kids. Come out to the ranch some weekend. We haven’t seen you out here in forever.”<br />
<br />
“Uh…I gotta go Aunt…I mean, sis.” Aaron shook his head. It was so confusing, and this was horrible! What was he going to do? Dad would be so mad! “Uh…I’ve gotta go do um important work stuff but uh uh I’ll call you okay? Okay?”<br />
<br />
“Okay, I get it. You don’t want to talk. Geez, well have fun wanking over all those hunky roid rage cases. I’ll talk you later. Kisses, bye!”<br />
<br />
“Oh man, what am I gonna do. What am I gonna do. What am I gonna-“<br />
<br />
“Jake!”<br />
<br />
“Oh, hi!”Aaron said, sounding panicked. I forgot this guy’s name, thought Aaron.<br />
<br />
“Jake, Hallerman wants to see you, stat.” Aaron’s phone rang but he ignored it.<br />
<br />
“Oh, okay.” Aaron got up and followed…whatshisname out the door and past several glass walled offices which had views of the city below. The man veered away from Aaron and went to his desk. Aaron tried to act nonchalant as he looked for a name anywhere, but couldn’t find one. The guy wasn’t that hot, though. Maybe if he was like that cute temp, Trent, was fresh out of college and had a nice ass and looked like a model and oh man I have to stop thinking about all this!<br />
<br />
“Jake! Have a seat.”<br />
<br />
“Hi, Mr. Hallerman!”<br />
<br />
“Aw, Jake, just call me Lou. Now Jake, I wanted to talk to you man to man. You know as well as I do how important this account is. The Peterson account is in no danger, half of all the other gyms in three states have heavy reliance on us, and that is what we need. But this? This is nationwide, and it’s going to account for what will take this company to the top. And you know that. Jake, what I’m trying to say is, I need you to continue your bodybuilding and pump it to a new level. I want you in the gym every day for the next month. Now, as soon as the deal goes through, I’ve decided to make use of your body. You are the perfect look of health. You are going to be our spokesperson for the high school project, they need a hunk they can slap on the face of this thing for promotional reasons. Posters, mags, educational materials, but also it has to be someone from high up in the company. Now the rest of us, we’re not bad, but we’re also all over 50. Once you step up to V.P. you are going to take on a whole new level of responsibility and representation. Jake, it’s time. I want you to be a vice president of this company. I also want you to do some traveling, give speeches in high schools, talk to kids about working out, make sure they know how it’s important to us so we have good community standing. That and this merger with MorphCorp. They are going to play some hardball in a few arenas. They’ll try to cut corners around here but really what we need to do is convince them we should expand and continue expanding. The Asian markets are ripe for gyms as well. We could quintuple our business. The clothing line we invested in was a very smart move because all the gym clothes we are moving are being moved with the help of the gyms. That cross promotion idea of yours went down great. That’s one of the reasons I’m promoting you. You think ahead. And quite frankly,” Hallerman said in a low tone of voice. “I could see you running things here after I retire. Jim and Stan are both just a few years from that themselves so you would be coming in at just the right time. So. What do you say?” He clapped Aaron on the back. Though he had to reach up to do so. <br />
<br />
“W-wow. I mean, really? You’re gonna need me for all that?”<br />
<br />
“I am. But I need you to be ready. Are you?”<br />
<br />
“Yes, yes sir. Yes, Mr. um. Yes, Lou. Yes, I am!” Aaron eagerly shook his new boss’s hand. The old man talked to him some more about being a real man and what it meant, how it was both body and a state of mind.<br />
<br />
“You see what I’m saying? A lot of guys out there in the world are like, little kids running around in adult bodies. But you Jake, you’re not one of those guys.”<br />
<br />
“Oh, yeah, I totally know.” Aaron said, then looked the other direction uncomfortably.<br />
<br />
Aaron walked quickly to the bathroom. He didn’t want anybody to see what he was about to do. Dressed in fully formal clothes, he looked at himself in the mirror once more and did a huge dance. He jumped up and down, left and right. Boxed with his reflection and then made “yes” gestures wildly with his fist. Threw up his hands in the air and made grandstanding gestures of thanking imaginary crowds. <br />
<br />
I&#39;m gonna be president of the company some day! I&#39;m going to be a vice president! I can work out all the time in this huge body. Aaron blinked. <br />
<br />
I want to say, he thought. I actually want to be Dad. I want to be Jake. I want to run this company. I don&#39;t want to go back to school! But how? <br />
<br />
&quot;How am I gonna convince him?&quot; he wondered out loud. Suddenly a toilet flushed and Aaron jumped a bit, stopped, and started adjusting his tie as Trent the temp came out and washed his hands. <br />
<br />
“Hi, boss.”<br />
<br />
“Oh!” Aaron said nervously. “Hi, hi Trent. What’s up?”<br />
<br />
“Not much, man. Hey, you get to go to the big lunch, right? They’re leaving now.”<br />
<br />
“Oh, no, uh thanks!” Aaron nearly slipped as he hurried out of the bathroom.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, his cel phone went off. Flipping it open he dodged into his office, which had a glass wall in the front like the rest.<br />
<br />
“Jake Sanders, how can I help you?”<br />
<br />
“It’s me! My sister dragged me to your school. Son, I’m on the pay phone. You need to get over here. RIGHT. NOW. And pick me up. I’ll ditch them if I can and meet you up front.”<br />
<br />
“Dad, I can’t. I’m supposed to go to lunch with-“<br />
<br />
“I don’t care! I can’t stay here! It’s a bunch of kids, I don’t fit in here…this is a nightmare!” Jake hissed in his kid voice. “Come down here NOW. That’s an order, mister. Or you’re grounded.”<br />
<br />
“Dad, I can’t. I have really important things to do and-“<br />
<br />
“Jake! You comin’? We need ya, man.”<br />
<br />
“Look, I’ll meet you after school, okay? Maybe I can get out early.”<br />
<br />
“What?? You get down here! Hello!? Hello?” Jake gulped. “He hung up on me.”<br />
<br />
“What are you doing not in class? Didn’t you hear the bell ring?” A balding man in a suit asked him. <br />
<br />
“Oh, pipe down, I’m going already!”<br />
<br />
“Excuse me? You do not talk like that to your elders, young man. Look at me when I’m talking to you?’ The man whipped out a notepad. “I’m assigning you detention for a week. That ought to straight out your attitude, Aaron. First you’re trying to skip out and now you’re getting a lip. Well, don’t just stand there. March!”<br />
<br />
Jake walked down the hall, feeling totally humiliated. What a total dickwad! If I was an adult he wouldn’t have dared to talk to me that way! What an…what a…I don’t want to go to detention. He sniffed. What’s wrong with me? Why am I nearly crying? He yelled at me but I’m a man, I can take it. But…but he didn’t even.. what a stupid jerk!<br />
<br />
Class was even worse. He’d never been that great at history, and one of the other kids kept thumping him in the back of the head. Just to get to him! If that little punk face was doing that and I was an adult, I wouldn’t have to think twice about intimidating him! <br />
<br />
“Excuse me, but could you please stop that? I’m trying to pay attention.”<br />
<br />
“Awww! Poor little Aaron.” The fat boy flicked him in Jake’s forehead. Furious, Jake turned around. Someone passed a note onto his desk.<br />
<br />
“That is enough! What’s this?” The teacher, an old lady with crazy hair and a purple cardigan and glasses strode over. Passing notes, Aaron?”<br />
<br />
“No! I didn’t even write that!!”<br />
<br />
“Then who did?”<br />
<br />
“I don’t know, someone just put it there.”<br />
<br />
“Miss Waters sucks. Oh that’s lovely. Well I’ll give the entire class detention, then.” The entire class gasped. “What, you don’t want that? Well then no more note passing!” she screamed at him and marched back to her desk. Suddenly Jake felt someone flick the back of his head.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Aaron was having fun being with other adults that his Dad worked with. They talked in the elevator and walked down the street together. He loved the feeling of being above everyone. He was so tall! It felt amazing being Dad. <br />
<br />
I have to figure out a way for us to stay this way,  he thought. Maybe Dad will want to stay a kid a little longer. Maybe I can convince him it&#39;s like a big long vacation and that it would be more fun for him to stay in my body. I don&#39;t want to quit this! I know adult type things, I have a totally adult body and my dick is huge. And they want me to be in charge of everyone! That&#39;s so awesome! I can finally be the one in charge of everything! I can be in charge at work and then come home and I can tell Dad what to do!!<br />
<br />
Only, I&#39;ve never told Dad what to do...<br />
<br />
Aaron thought about it some more. Things were moving quickly now and the gears of his mind were turning. He was stepping into some pretty big shoes and there was no reason he should have to step out of them!</p>
