<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ruby and Sarah hid under a desk in the science lab. They were terrified of those things outside. Both had been eating home-cooked meals when a girl at a nearby table began to moan. At first, they mocked her until they saw blue skin tearing through her clothing. In a matter of seconds, a hulking frog-like monster jumped the captain of the basketball team and pushed its cock into the teen&#39;s ass. They backed away in horror as he gained breasts and wings. Soon a dragon girl was begging to be bred. They then saw several other students begin to moan and change before they ran. They then saw several monsters making out and jacking off. The males seemed to want to change them but the females wanted more than that. One broke Ruby&#39;s skirt as she ran. She was thankful it didn&#39;t touch her skin. They managed to find an unoccupied room and hid.  <br />
<br />
It felt like ages before they heard the door open. &quot;I should&#39;ve known daddy&#39;s little BRATS wouldn&#39;t eat like the rest of us. *growl*&quot; The desk was lifted on one end and dropped on its top. Ruby and Sarah looked in shock at Ace. &quot;then again, I wanted to see you squirm like all those times I did&quot; he gave a wicked grin as he whistled. Several female monsters walked in with eager grins.  <br />
<br />
First was a harpy, her arms had wings that ended with three scaly talons. Her knees were covered in feathers and tail feathers grew from her ass. Her feet looked like giant talons. Apart from the feather replacing her hair, her head looked like that of a teen girl. Her torso and hips were mostly bare of any feathers. She had a blue necklace they saw that was nerd in gym class wear. next was a gelatinous goo creature. She was blue with flowers clinging to her body randomly. She was the shortest of all the monsters. Next was a gorgon. She had arms but her legs were replaced with a long tail that dragged behind her. She also had nipple-less breasts and three extra red eyes on her hood. They felt their nipples stiffen just staring at her. Next to her was a lizard woman. She was brown and white with dark brown stripes. Her tail was not as long as the gorgon, but it still dragged the ground. She was remarkably tall with yellow eyes, wisps of energy emanating from them. Then there was a Golem. She was wide with disproportionately large hands. Moss grew on her feet, thighs, shoulders, and &#39;hair. Said hair was a darker shade than the rest of her body. Her eyes were empty sockets and her mouth was replaced with some foreign word in another language. Then there was a werewolf. She was muscular and hunched over. Her yellow eyes glowed. Then there was a chimera that had a humanoid body with a lion&#39;s torso and a massive mane that covered her back and breasts. Her rear and long tail moved independently with a snake head at the tip. Her left leg was that of a dragon while the right was that of a cow. Her left arm was also a dragon and her right was that of a tiger, though the stripes were replaced with black spikes. On both hands, two different colored eyes blinked on the dorsal side of them. Horns were above her eyes as she gave a most eager sneer. Right beside her was some alien they guessed. It was mainly dark grey with blue down running from her elongated neck to her thighs. It has suction cup fingers and toes with a clear hole between the bones of her calves and forearms. Where her head should have been were five lines. Ruby and Sarah screamed when it opened. The &#39;face&#39; pulled back to reveal an ocean-blue starfish with a hole in the center. From the hole in the center a long limb came out, and at the end was a small mouth with fangs and a corkscrew tongue. Their minds raced as they darted at a black and purple dragoness. She was large. Her eyes looked like white voids. It roared at them making them scoot back to the desk behind them.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Now, now Kevin. Wait until I say so&quot; Ace raised his hand. the beast obeyed him as he took a few steps back. &quot;t-that&#39;s Kevin?&quot; Sarah said. She was shaken that the chubby dweeb she picked on was the monster before her. &quot;yes, in fact, these fine ladies were all men you bullied&quot; Ace draped his hands over the harpy messing with the necklace. &quot;I figured they&#39;d want to make you pay as much as I do&quot; he then walked over to Ruby and grabbed her face, pulling her up to his height. &quot;soon the world will see how much of a freak you are, both of you&quot; he threw he down hard as he walked to the wall.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Ace please... we&#39;re sorry&quot; Sarah apologized. Despite the genuine apology Ruby had to ruin it. &quot;you&#39;re the freak. You won&#39;t be less of one because of this.&quot; she said. Ace&#39;s pondering of the apology was replaced with a calm rage. &quot;well let&#39;s see what you have to say after picture day is done&quot; he snapped his fingers. The eight monster girls charged at the two. Ruby felt the gorgon&#39;s forked tongue enter her mouth after it began kissing her. The harpy then grabbed her hands and pushed them into her breasts. The lizard woman used her tail to pierce her pants and enter her anus. The alien then sent its mouth to her crotch and spat on it. Its spit ate through her clothing allowing her to use the mouth to eat her out. Sarah meanwhile had another monster girl enter her pussy completely. The Golem then placed her hands on Sarah&#39;s ass, and soon a pleasurable reverberate ran through her body. The chimera then grabbed the girl&#39;s breasts while its snake licked her. Finally, the dragon gave her several big sloppy kisses. Both of the girl&#39;s pupils began to dilate as they leaned into their lovers.  <br />
<br />
Ace sat on a desk with a smug look as he saw a horn appear on Sarah. It was long and pink. His left hand grew as fur covered it. Sharp claws appeared as one of her fingers was lost. The fur then spread across her body randomly. Her clothes tightened as the muscles beneath grew. A long tail grew, it looked a lot like a wolf&#39;s tail. When the nerves attached Sarah jolted in shock. This caused her tearing clothes to rip off completely. Her genitals shifted giving the slime inside a fun ride. A sheath formed around her changing clit as her testicles fell into their furry sack. On her biceps, a pink spike grew with another on the other side. She couldn&#39;t help but cum out the slim girl as her face pushed into a canine-like muzzle. Her ears were now pointed above her head, but she kept their black piercings. The intelligence behind her eyes seemed to dim as one became yellow and the other orange. Fangs hung crookedly out of his muzzle as it grew out and he pushed into the dragon. He then used his hand to plunge into the chimeras pussy while he humped the slime girl, his cum adding to her mass.  <br />
<br />
It was only when the school bell rang at the end of the day that Xavier finally came to his senses. he was not the only one as the female monsters looked horrified at what they&#39;d done. They ran off leaving him and whatever became of ruby. Looking towards his friend he was shocked at the former girl&#39;s new form. His body was tall and muscular looking somewhat like a dinosaur. A large tail hung from his rear. His feet ended in three round reddish toes. His scales were reddish with a yellow front, stripes along his arms and tail, and metacarpals. A reddish marking made them look similar to finger-less gloves. The head was the most drastic. He had a toothless muzzle with four jagged points on his mouth. His long blue tongue hung off the side. He had no eyes but seemed to be able to see. Xavier guessed his curved horns had to do so, perhaps the yellow crystals at the tips. He was currently looking at his massive penis. It took a bit for it to shrink from its massive size, then it returned to a slit that shouldn&#39;t have been able to hide its size. It then was aware of Xavier.  <br />
<br />
&quot;X?! Is that you?&quot; Ruby seemed more shocked he said X rather than Sarah. &quot;Sam? X not understand how  Sam know X name? what X say?&quot; Xavier was surprised both by his beastly voice and his simplified speech. Trying to figure out what was happening he was horrified to realize his knowledge was greatly reduced. Even then when he felt like walking it was animalistic. They then heard a familiar voice from the speakers. &quot;Attention students and faculty. It&#39;s time for school pictures. Come to the gym as you are and then once your picture has been taken you can go home. Speak to me if you want not to be seen as a FREAK and I will CHOOSE who gets that pleasure&quot;. Despite their fear and rage, the two needed to leave the room and head to the gym. They soon found they weren&#39;t the only ones as several others were in a line ahead of them. They were terrified of what Ace was going to do with them but weren&#39;t able to run away. <br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Ace couldn&#39;t believe how well this worked out. He didn&#39;t see a single student or faculty member who hadn&#39;t been changed. Unfortunately, due to some losing their intelligence and understanding of human speech, they didn&#39;t come. Regardless, this was a massive success. One by one, those who had wronged him came in front of the camera to have their picture taken. Each had a fake grin that hid the torment inside. he had made sure Reggie had been changed by him instead of the tainted food. As a result, she was now a hot velociraptor. After they got their picture taken they came to him to plead their cases. The first one Ace thought of being genuinely sorry for was Steve the cat monster. He apologized for not standing up for Ace when he was Amy. Ace brought out a potion vial and anointed the male as he knelled. His form shifted somewhat. His purple eyes above his original pair disappeared as did his extra arms and tail. Next, he got clothing that fit his new form perfectly. It was a tank top, gym shorts, and a backward cap.  <br />
<br />
Despite still being male Steve felt like he was his true self. Next was his friends Mich and Ellie. They were torn about what they wanted. Mich wanted to thank Ace for giving him his form while Ellie wanted to return to being Michelle. After anointing their heads the two heads rose. Ellie&#39;s hair became tidier as his expression became more relaxed, and Mich&#39;s face became calmer. A pair of shorts covered their crotch while a shirt with a wide collar covered their torso. On the right arm, a watch appeared. The two heads now felt in sync with each other and thanked him. Then there was the principal.  <br />
<br />
Alexis tried to plea but Ace could tell she was hiding her true feelings. When he demanded the truth he was angered to hear the bee monster say he had gone too far. Enraged he picked up another potion and threw the contents on her. Her eyes lost their intelligence and moaned as eggs poured out of her dripping pussy nonstop. He then ordered her to go to the basement and make a hive there. He knew there was already one feral monster there and both would fight over territory. Sam on the other hand was one of the few people Ace didn&#39;t blame for his abuse. As a result, he picked up a potion and poured it on him. In a matter of moments, Carla was back to her human form. Ace explained she had been given the ability to switch forms from her. Over the day he saw every student he could. Some left to who knows where after the picture. Others spoke to him. Those were a nerdy girl who had become a male tiger anthro and a girl who had been in the same boat as Amy when it came to bullies. Both had been given normalization vials finding they loved being guys. Of course, Ace kept the best for last. Once their pictures were done, Sammy and Xavier. Their fake apologies fell on deaf ears. Ace pulled out one final potion. Throwing the splash potion at their feet an orange gas enveloped them. Once it cleared the two had changed.  <br />
<br />
Both had a gold collar with a chain attached. Engraved on them was &#39;property of ace smith&#39;, With his address and their new names. Inside their minds their consciousnesses were trapped behind their eyes, able to see and hear everything but unable to do anything. The beasts now controlled their bodies. They sat like dogs next to their new master &quot;Good my pets. what should I do now?&quot; Ace pondered. His revenge on the school was complete. He needed to figure out his new purpose. He could use the potions to make an army or a kingdom. He could change the city or the world. With the potions at his side, there was nothing Ace couldn&#39;t do.</p>
