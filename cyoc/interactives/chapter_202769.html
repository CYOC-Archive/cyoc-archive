<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Keitaro, when I told you to find a direction in your life during the career foundations day, I didn’t mean beating up your classmates,” Ms. Makima, the school counselor said with fingers pinching the bridge of her nose. The pinked-haired busty woman looked at these two problems staring at her. On the left, Keitaro has a confusing look on his face. Makima can’t decide whether he was happy with what he did, or remorseful. Genta is on the right. His face is boxed blue and red cotton is on his nose. Makima can’t fathom how he got to this state considering the one who did this is so thin he’d fly away from a gust of wind. <br />
<br />
“Did your sister instruct you to do this?” Ms. Makima asked.<br />
<br />
Tak’s brow raised. He has a sister. “N- no. She didn’t. It was all me.” Tak doesn’t know who she is yet but he can’t involve a stranger with something he did.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, the door to the counselor’s office swung open so violently the floor rattled. There on the door was a young woman. She wore a professional uniform. An office worker perhaps? But the high-quality fabric and design suggest she has a higher position. She walked closer with her heels loudly clacking with each step. <br />
<br />
“Ino, I’m glad to see nothing has changed with your attitude.” Ms. Makima said with a sigh. “Welcome, take a seat.”<br />
<br />
Ino sat beside Tak. The woman loomed over him like a hawk. <br />
<br />
“What is this about Tak punching his classmate?” Ino grabbed Tak’s wrist and raised it. “Do you think my little brother could punch with his stick?”<br />
<br />
“Believe me, Ino. I can scarcely believe it myself. But other students have seen it.” <br />
<br />
“Y- yreah!!! He m- munched me in ma ace (Yeah. He punched me in the face)” Genta said with difficulty. Can’t speak easy when your nose is caked with blood.<br />
<br />
“I’ve asked his classmates before going here actually. And they also said Genta threw the first punch. Doesn’t that count as self-defense?” <br />
<br />
Makima knew Ino. She used to study here years ago and she is a frequent visitor to the counselor’s office. Seeing her here along these years takes her back. And she knows Ino is one stubborn lady that won’t back down when he sets her mind to it. And there are rumors that he loves his little brother. A little too much some people might say. She’d entertain this nostalgic moment if she had more time in the world. <br />
<br />
“Yes, I believe it does count as self-defense. So, let us settle this right now. Say sorry to each other. Tak, Genta, both of you.”<br />
<br />
Genta raised his head. “Wry rould I ray rorry? He prunched me! (Why should I say sorry? He punched me!” <br />
<br />
As much as Tak wanted to fight for himself, settling this is the fastest way out of this office. “I’m sorry for punching you. I won’t do it again unless you ask me to be your bread shuttle again.”<br />
<br />
Ms. Makima groaned. She clapped her hands, “That’s it. You both said your apologies. Thank you. No harm no foul.” With that, the three left the office. Genta immediately bolted his way out of there. Getting a beatdown from Tak was humiliating enough. But his sister, she’s something else. Genta’s danger senses are screaming at him to run away from there. <br />
<br />
Ino turned to face his brother. The two stared at each other for a second until Ino broke the silence.<br />
<br />
“As your older sister, I am so proud of you.”<br />
<br />
“What?”<br />
<br />
“You finally grew a fucking spine.” Ino pulled Tak closer and hugged him tightly. Tak was smaller than his supposed sister so his head only reached up to her chest area. And her chest area is one big breathing hazard. His head was smashed between two enormous breasts. And whew! It smelled there. She must have run her way over here. Commendable considering she was wearing heels. “Although, you should have gotten a punch or two to make that self-defense excuse more believable.”<br />
<br />
The two walked home. Strangely enough, Tak’s sister is a little too close for comfort. She has arms wrapped around his shoulder, and giggles to herself. She wasn’t like this in the office. It’s like she is a different person around her brother. <br />
<br />
As they walked home, they passed the place where Tak nearly died. There are more police than before, and the hole in the apartment is now covered with tarpaulin. <br />
<br />
“These bombings, everyone in the office is so busy dealing with them. Even my boss is starting to get back to her old eating habits. If you see a suspicious person, you run.” <br />
<br />
They finally reached their apartment, and from the looks of it, the place was only for the two of them. While Ino is taking a bath, Tak uses the time to investigate Keitaro’s life. <br />
<br />
Keitaro’s parents seemed to be gone most of the time. There are pictures of both in the refrigerator with them in various places abroad. They must be overseas workers, and that fact is further proven by their spacious apartment. <br />
<br />
In a room beside the living room, there was gym equipment. But Tak doubts that Keitaro was using them. He tried to lift the lightest weight and he did, for a few counts. He was heaving by the time his arms gave out. If he is to stay in this body for some time, he must build an adequate frame. Tak has this gut feeling telling him that his fight with Genta would not be the last. <br />
<br />
Besides the mini gymnasium was Keitaro’s room. Tak never had a permanent place to sleep before. It’s usually motels, alleyways, or an associate’s cellar. If he had a normal life, he thinks he’d have a room like this. But fewer video game posters and bookshelves filled with mangas. He jumped on the bed and smelled it. It smelled rank and sweaty, like a teenager. And speaking of sweat, his sister just finished taking a bath so it was his turn to do his. <br />
<br />
Tak’s wiry frame is a disappointment. His dick however is not. It’s quite amazing in fact. For a twig, he is fucking hung. He touched it and was hung up on the fact that this was now his. He’d masturbate if he wasn’t so tired the entire day. It was as if cement was poured all over his body. His muscles are aching and his knuckles are still bruised from the punches he did. Lucky for him, this hot bath made the pain go away. The pain was replaced with tiredness. After taking a bath, he was so ready to go to bed but her sister stopped her in his tracks.<br />
<br />
“Where the hell do you think you’re going?” Ino asked. “I cooked this curry for you and you’re going to go back to your room? Get your butt here this instant.”<br />
<br />
A meal is a meal. The mention of food made Tak aware of the hunger he’s been feeling since this afternoon. <br />
<br />
After the meal, Tak helped her sister clean up the place. Then spent the rest of the night in his room, fiddling with Keitaro’s phone and finding his porn stash.<br />
<br />
Not bad…</p>
