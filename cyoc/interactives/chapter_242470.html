<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">At first, Jenny didn&#39;t really notice anything was wrong. Like most illnesses, her &#39;symptoms&#39; manifested so gradually that at first she just shrugged them off as nothing.<br />
<br />
She went about her day as she always had, caught the bus to school, gossiped with her friends. Attended her classes, ate with her boyfriend and the other cheerleaders at lunch. Her clique ran into Kyle in the hall in the afternoon, bullying and berating the sick little weasel for even believing in the town curse. Chad had sent the creep scurrying away with his pants around his ankles again.<br />
<br />
Sure, she&#39;d had to use the restroom several times throughout the day. But Jenny barely noticed that she was maybe peeing more than normal, let alone worried about it.<br />
<br />
It wasn&#39;t until after school during cheerleading practice that she started to notice anything might be wrong.<br />
<br />
At first she felt fine, leading the girls through a new routine with her usual peppiness and confidence - but after only 15 minutes Jenny was starting to feel tired. She fumbled the landing of the last part of the routine, her cheeks turning pink in embarrassed frustration.<br />
<br />
Getting up, her back ached. In fact, as she instructed the squad to take a quick break, she subtly tried to ease the tension in her spine, only for the feeling to get worse. Out of breath from the routine Jenny tried limbering up some more but started to notice a sort of dull ache all over her body, especially in her feet and hands and her elbows and her knees.<br />
<br />
Worse, and slightly embarrassingly, just as Jenny was getting the girls back into formation for another rehearsal, she felt a sudden insistent urge from her bladder. Again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Um, Susan?&quot; Jenny quickly called, her voice cracking slightly at just how rapidly the feeling had come on and how suddenly desperatly full she felt. Even five seconds ago she hadn&#39;t felt a thing, now she felt like she was ready to burst.<br />
<br />
Her best friend spun around, giving her a tilted head look and questioning smile, &quot;Yeuh?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Could you...&quot; Jenny fidgeted on the spot before she started hurrying back towards the lock room, &quot;... lead this one? I gotta...&quot;<br />
<br />
She didn&#39;t actually finish her sentence before she hurried away. The desperate urge to pee quickly consumed her every thought and the blonde half-waddled-half-ran back into the locker room.<br />
<br />
Quickly throwing herself into a stall, Jenny barely had enough time to lock the door and yank her panties down before her body gave up any semblance of control and she started to pee. Hard. The pressure and relief were intense - Jenny let out a weak moan, her bare ass beneath her skirt hadn&#39;t even hit the seat before the stream started.<br />
<br />
The aching in her joints didn&#39;t help, sitting felt awkward and the girl arched her back to try and ease the sensation, thrusting her breasts forward and letting her head tip back as the stream beneath her only seemed to get more intense.<br />
<br />
Jenny half gasped and half moaned as she heard her stream splashing loudly against the water in the bowl. She wasn&#39;t sure she&#39;d ever peed quite this hard before, and definitely not this embarrassingly loudly. Worse, through the fog of pleasurable relief, Jenny started to realise just how much was coming out of her.<br />
<br />
She shook her hips, concern starting to grow as the stream swayed but continued to pour out of her at what felt like an impossible quantity.<br />
<br />
It wasn&#39;t normal.<br />
<br />
30 seconds passed... Then a minute...<br />
<br />
By the time she&#39;d been peeing continuously for two minutes Jenny felt a kind of new horror dawning on her. What if she never stopped? What if she was stuck just peeing forever and ever...<br />
<br />
She whimpered, gasping in relief when mercifully the stream between her legs finally started to slow, reducing back to a very normal trickle, then to a few drops before it stopped completely.<br />
<br />
&quot;... what the hell...&quot; Jenny whispered softly to herself, braving a glance down into the bowl between her legs to make sure everything looked... normal. The cheerleader blushed harder, frowning with more confusion as she stared at the crystal clear water in the bowl beneath her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Did I drink too much or.. Uh?!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jenny experimentally shook her hips again. After peeing for so long her urethra felt almost numb from the constant sensation and it took her a few minutes longer to really trust that her body was finally done.<br />
<br />
After composing herself, Jenny quickly cleaned up, flushed, washed her hands and hurried back to practice. Her face was a little flushed and her joints were a little stiff, but otherwise she was feeling okay again.<br />
<br />
The rest of practice passed in a weird blur for Jenny. She stumbled more than once, earning her a few questions from the other girls wondering if she was okay. Jenny shrugged each one off but remained distracted by an anxiety and paranoia that her need to pee might flare up again any second.<br />
<br />
Jenny&#39;s mom picked her up. The cheerleader climbed into the passenger seat with a tired huff that didn&#39;t go unnoticed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good day?&quot; Her mom asked as she pulled out of the parking lot<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh huh...&quot; Jenny sighed, wincing slightly as the dull ache grew worse as she rolled her neck. There was an awkward pause.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you okay? Feeling okay?&quot; Her mom pressed.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m fine&quot; <br />
<br />
She felt her doubtful gaze, &quot;Are you sure?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure Mom...&quot; Jenny insisted, only to then realise that she was sitting with her arms held up in front her, elbows bent, fingers together and palms raised facing outwards like she was surrendering to the windshield. She quickly forced her hands down, wincing slightly at how stiff her joints felt... &quot;... I&#39;m fine... I&#39;m fine...&quot;<br />
<br />
She wasn&#39;t sure if she was trying to convince her mom or herself.<br />
<br />
The rest of the ride Jenny just felt &#39;off&#39;. It didn&#39;t really seem to matter how she adjusted the seatbelt or her legs, the uncomfortable aching all over her body only seemed to get persistently stronger.<br />
<br />
Worse, just as they were pulling onto the driveway Jenny felt another sudden surge in her bladder. She squeaked, shifting uncomfortably and impatiently in her seat as her mom seemed to take an age to pull the car into the garage.<br />
<br />
Jenny couldn&#39;t hold it. Before the car had even stopped moving she opened the door and ran inside for the bathroom, flying through the house in a desperate rush. Again, the sudden pressure made her head spin, she felt like she might explode any second.<br />
<br />
She threw herself into the closest bathroom, again frantically yanking her panties down just in time before the full force of the stream erupted beneath her.<br />
<br />
She moaned, throwing her head back, mouth open, at the almost overwhelmingly pleasurable relief. Back arching, Jenny&#39;s arms snapped back into right angles, palms up, her head tipping back and knees bending hard against the bowl as she peed... and peed... and peed...<br />
<br />
&quot;Gyyuhh?&quot; Jenny couldn&#39;t form words, her jaw felt stuck as the stream of clear water continued to pour out of her like a hose. The torrent didn&#39;t stop, maintaining an almost impossible strength as, again, one minute turned into two... then more alarmingly three...<br />
<br />
&quot;Jenny?&quot;<br />
<br />
Her mom&#39;s concerned voice and the knock on the unlocked bathroom door snapped the anxious teenager into action. A panicked whimper escaping her throat as she wriggled her hips and desperately pleaded with her own body to STOP.<br />
<br />
&quot;Everything okay sweetie?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Gyuh... Yes!&quot; Jenny shrieked, choking on her panic as she tried to aim the stream away from the water to make it quieter, her cheeks turning crimson, &quot;everything&#39;s fine M-oOm! Don&#39;t come in!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jenny groaned, staring at the door and praying her mom wouldn&#39;t open it, shaking, her heart hammering as she tried shaking her hips again.<br />
<br />
Mercifully, after what felt like an eternity but was probably more like another 30 seconds, Jenny felt her pee stream starting to slow. It seemed to take longer than last time to stop but, to her relief, it did eventually trickle to a stop.<br />
<br />
Jenny took a few moments to catch her breath, nervously glancing down into the toilet again and gasping at the pure clear water that had seemingly half filled the bowl.<br />
<br />
How much had she peed?! A gallon?? Two?!<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s... impossible...&quot; Jenny gasped softly to herself, again blushing as she fought her own body to lower her arms back into a normal position. Hurrying to flush the weirdly clear evidence of her &#39;issue&#39; away before she washed her hands, Jenny pulled her underwear back on and braved leaving the bathroom...</p>
