<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Justin, Doc McArt and Carl enjoyed a pleasant late afternoon in the examination room.  Carl had been the Doc's last appointment of the day.  The staff had all gone home while the three bearmen fucked.  It was getting late, around 9:30 or so at night. <br />
<br />
Carl was going to go home with the Doc and Justin was headed across campus to see if he could catch the handsome quarterback before he went home from practice.<br />
<br />
Justin, now an anthropomorphic grizzly, did his best to be stealthy crossing campus.  He took it slow, kept to the shadows and used the dense landscaping to keep from being detected.<br />
<br />
At around 10, he made it to the outskirts of the football field.<br />
<br />
Hiding in the bushes in a stand of trees connected to a nearby nature preserve, he looked out over the parking lot.  The QB's car was still there, along with the Coach's and another car.  It looked as though most of the team had left already and, as he was getting ready to move out of the bushes, the quarterback and the coach came around the corner of the locker rooms attached to the stadium.  <br />
<br />
Justin ducked back into the cover beneath the trees.<br />
<br />
The field lights were still on, but the coach took out some keys, opened up a breaker box and flipped the switches.  The stadium lights went out.  The coach locked up the box and said good night to the QB who was getting into his car.  The coach headed back into the locker room.<br />
<br />
Justin realized as the QB drove off he had missed his chance.  It was quiet, no one around at this hour of night, so Justin extremely horny, decided that the cute, muscled, grey bearded, balding, beer bellied coach would be a lot of fun.  He would sneak into the locker room and seduce the coach.<br />
<br />
Justin ambled across the parking lot, he knew he was alone, he didn't smell another person for miles.<br />
<br />
He reached the door to the locker room and opened it, quietly.<br />
<br />
He entered the steamy room; the scent of male musk from all the jocks that used the room was heady and made his erection throb.  Pre come leaked from his huge cock as he closed the door quietly.<br />
<br />
He heard strange noises coming from the shower and he approached the stalls cautiously.  On the way, he bumped into one of the benches and knocked over a helmet.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Steve, it's about time!  Get in here and scrub my hairy back.  Took you long enough to take a dump.&quot;  Justin heard the coach say in his gruff, cigar-roughened voice. &quot;I'm all worked up and ready for a little action.&quot;<br />
<br />
Justin realized in that instant that, Coach Beaumont and Steve Kowalski one of the linebacks were fuck buddies.  This was going to be too easy!<br />
<br />
Justin crept up to the shower stall.  The coach had his back to Justin but he heard Justin's approach.  Coach Beaumont was shampooing and occasionally pumping his meat.<br />
<br />
&quot;Get my back son, Papa needs a good scrub.  After, I'll take care of you.&quot;  The coach growled as he began to rise off.<br />
<br />
Justin knew now was his opportunity.  While the coach was rinsing the soap out of his eyes and off his head, he wouldn't be looking.  Justin moved into the stall and drew the curtain.  He wrapped his huge furry body around the coach.<br />
<br />
Coach Beaumont had just rinsed and was shocked to feel himself enveloped in what felt like fur.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the Hell are you doing, Kowalski?&quot; coach said as he turned in the arms of Justin to face who he thought was his lover.  Immediately before him all, the coach saw was a wall of gold-brown fur.<br />
<br />
He then quickly looked up into Justin's ursine face and was about to yell when Justin covered his salt and pepper bearded mouth with his muzzle.  The coach screamed into Justin's mouth as his tongue began working into the coach's throat.  Justin hugged the six-foot tall coach to his body in a tight bear hug.  The coach struggled, tried to fend Justin off and free himself from the kiss, but it was no use; Justin's ursine body was too powerful.<br />
<br />
The coaches' struggles grew weaker as the bearman tongue wrestled with the coach.  Justin's huge cock humped into the coach Beaumont's belly as they kissed and the coach was beginning to hump back, rubbing his erection into Justin's fur.<br />
<br />
He released the coach from the kiss and looked into his eyes.<br />
<br />
Coach Beaumont growled softly, &quot;What are you?&quot; as he stroked the fur of Justin's burly barreled chest.<br />
<br />
Justin was about to answer when the curtain was pulled back quickly.  There stood Steve Kowalski, all six foot nine inches of muscled out, mean, ugly, sexually aroused linebacker.  Neither the coach nor his beast of a linebacker was small in the cock department, Justin had noticed.<br />
<br />
The shock on Steve's face when he saw Justin was comical.  His thick bearded, scarred, broken-nosed face contorted as he tried to make sense of what he was seeing.  Justin could have sworn the guy's wet flat top haircut had suddenly stood on end.<br />
<br />
Kowalski recovered for an instant and was about to launch a punch at Justin when the bearman swiftly grabbed the beefy arm headed toward his face and with the other paw grabbed the back of Kowalski's neck.<br />
<br />
Justin wasted no time and deep kissed the brute the same way he had the coach, hugging him to his furry body.<br />
<br />
There was more struggling, of course, but as that began to subside, as Steve relaxed into the bearman's arms, Justin knew these two were ready to take some seed.<br />
<br />
Justin felt the hard cock of Coach Beaumont pushing against his back door.  Justin relaxed his hole and the coach popped right in as Justin began to grind his crotch into Kowalski's.</p>
