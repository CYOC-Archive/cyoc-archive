<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Going from zero to a ten. He was a 10 now, and he knew it. Oliver stopped to sit on a bench. He was near the beach and he uploaded a few photos he took of his devilishly handsome new face. <br />
<br />
He looked like he could be in movies now. Playing the lead actor. Just old enough to be a father but not too old. He had combined clothing articles to create an avatar for himself, a combination of gay and straight made him bisexual and he was feeling adventurous. He loved the idea of getting together with some jock stud that would have looked down on him before when he was a pudgy high school loser. <br />
<br />
Now he was intimidatingly good looking with a body to match. At 215 lbs, and 6 foot 1, he was the epitome of what a man should look like. He was giddy with the power it gave him. <br />
<br />
And he could turn back into his loser self anytime. It was a thrill. How many men could he turn into? The possibilities were endless. He should really get some new clothes, try every secondhand store he could. Sure, he would have to test the ring on dozens if not hundreds of articles of clothing in order to narrow down the cream of the crop, as it were. But he could combine them to create new mixtures of men that didn&#39;t exist and therefore he couldn&#39;t have to worry about being someone&#39;s doppelganger. <br />
<br />
Being gay depended on his ability to find clothes that had belonged to a gay man, which was a significantly lower chance. He had thought for years that hot gay guys probably had it the easiest when it came to getting sex whenever they wanted. He soon found that he was quite popular. <br />
<br />
Already, men of all ages were flocking to his profile. He said he was bisexual and interested in being with men after a long time of only attempting to get with women, which was true...now his phone was blowing up. Before he knew it, dozens of men were clamoring to talk to him. He chose the hottest among them that were close by and asked a few if they wanted to meet up. <br />
<br />
The man was 22 and looked younger. His name was Todd. Todd was his type, Oliver decided. He had a broish frat man quality to him. A little bit of a party boy. He had a round face but played sports. He was not out at his university. He was shy when they met outside the cafe. Oliver realized he was intimidating the younger stud. <br />
<br />
After getting a few coffees, they talked outside. Todd had a gorgeous jawline and sparkling eyes. He talked about his studies. Oliver told him that they couldn&#39;t go back to his place because of the fact that his mother was staying with him and that she didn&#39;t know Oliver was attracted to men...which was technically true. Todd suggested they use a beach house a friend of his let him use for intimate hookups. This wasn&#39;t his first time using the beach house, he said with a smirk. <br />
<br />
&quot;But honestly, you&#39;re SO hot...like...you should do modeling, dude.&quot; <br />
<br />
Oliver grinned. &quot;Keep saying that. You&#39;re saying all the right things to me...&quot; He thought a moment and decided to act more like an older man, so he added &quot;son. Can I call you &#39;son&#39;?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;That is HOT.&quot; Todd grabbed his hand and they walked along side streets of beachfront properties. Apparently his university was far enough from here that he felt safe with public displays of affection. <br />
<br />
Inside the beach house, the sun was setting and everything was bathed in a pink light. Oliver found himself looking down on a hot jock and his brain was flooded with thoughts of sex. He kissed the man. His first kiss with a man was...electrifying. They made out standing and then made their way to the couch. Oliver took off the clothes he&#39;d borrowed from his dad&#39;s closet and climbed on top of the smaller stud. Todd was four inches shorter than him and it turned him on completely that men of average height now had to look up to him. He caressed Todd&#39;s arms, felt his stubble smack against this hot jock&#39;s cheeks, lips, ears, chin. Todd was moaning. <br />
<br />
What happened next was simply pure chemical attraction. The two men rushed to get naked without even saying a word and Todd gaped at Oliver&#39;s muscular DILFy frame. <br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re the hottest guy I&#39;ve ever done anything with. Holy shit!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You ain&#39;t seen nothing yet, kiddo! Check out that cock, huh?&quot; Oliver showed it off. It was bigger than his old dick by two inches, which brought his measly former 4.5 shorty dick to a respectable 6.5 inches. <br />
<br />
&quot;Nice.&quot; They had covered in advance that Oliver was only interested in oral sex for now. He wanted to experiment carefully. Feeling another man&#39;s expert lips on his daddy dick made it come straight to life. He fell back on the comfortable couch as Todd positioned himself and became a human vacuum cleaner, sucking and sucking and sucking. He was amazing at this! Oliver thought. This is so hot! A hot young stud sucking me off! <br />
<br />
&quot;OH YEAH, THAT&#39;S RIGHT, SON! THAT&#39;S RIGHT, BOY! YOU SUCK DADDY&#39;S COCK! SUCK DADDY OFF!&quot; <br />
<br />
It was like another personality was taking over all of a sudden. Now he was some kind of sexual beast! In this body, he was confident and proud, completely free of shame and anxiety. He knew how hot he was! Who wouldn&#39;t want this hot body of his!<br />
<br />
It wasn&#39;t hard for him to find release. Calling the young hot jock his son overwhelmed him. He never thought about age difference before but in this body, he was enamored with younger men. Nothing was as hot as a college jock! he thought, even though it was a completely unfamiliar feeling. <br />
<br />
Like thinking someone else&#39;s thoughts. He slapped the younger man on the ass a few times and complimented him as being the best cocksucker he&#39;d had that year...which was technically true. <br />
<br />
Todd got dressed and told Oliver that they should do it again sometime, but he had a class to get to. Oliver said he had to get back to his mother. He kissed the younger stud again, and for the first time he tasted his cum in another man&#39;s mouth, the lingering aftertaste of his own manhood dissolving in another man, and he was proud of it. <br />
<br />
Oliver walked back to the bus stop. His mother had been texting him for hours. He told her he was with a friend. She called him but he didn&#39;t answer. How could he when he would answer with another man&#39;s voice?<br />
<br />
Luckily for him, he&#39;d thought about the need to change back to regular Oliver. He still had the ring and the socks he was wearing were his own. He stopped at a local park restroom and made sure it was empty, then took off his clothes quickly in order to change back to his regular self. <br />
<br />
Back to Clark Kent minus any muscles, he thought glumly. He put his father&#39;s clothes back on after the transformation was complete. They now hung loosely on him. He hoped his father wouldn&#39;t be home by the time he got back. His father drove up just as he got inside his bedroom. He hid his father&#39;s clothes inside his own dresser and put on his own frumpy clothes. <br />
<br />
He checked his phone. It had been blowing up all evening with guys that wanted to get with him! Too bad none of them were girls, he thought. He shook his head. He hadn&#39;t retained any of the attraction for men after returning to his old self.  <br />
<br />
Maybe next, I should try to find a guy close to my own age. Maybe find some football gear! Then I could turn into a football jock or a combination of them. Then I could find some hot babes...<br />
<br />
Oliver was still poor and looking like a hot DILF he probably was going to give people the impression that he was more financially successful than he was. Maybe being a super hot DILF could help him in that arena later on, he thought. He brainstormed. Male escorts could make money, and he looked into it. He could make money if he went for older women. There were a number of possibilities here. He wanted to make some money, though, and his resources were limited. He only had a few hundred dollars. <br />
<br />
He decided to look for new articles of clothing so he could...</p>
