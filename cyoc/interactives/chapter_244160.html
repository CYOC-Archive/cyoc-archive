<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">He was about to edit it, perhaps to make the sentence more specific or to change the outcome, but before he could do so, a car cut in front of him. Seeing the danger he was almost in, Jack decided to put down his phone and drive carefully. He didn&#39;t want any accidents, especially not with all six of his children in the van. He focused on the road, his eyes scanning the surroundings as he navigated through the traffic. After a while, they finally arrived home. Jack&#39;s wife, Helen, happily welcomed them, smiling as she saw the children sleeping in their seats.<br />
<br />
After Jack got out of the van, the two proceeded to open the van and carefully carry all of their children one by one. After changing their clothes, they carefully left the sleepy kids in the living room, and the two parents began to organize and clean up the house. Having finished cleaning, Helen decided to head to the kitchen to prepare dinner. But before she could, she noticed Jack had left a new phone on the table.<br />
<br />
Helen picked it up, curiosity getting the better of her, and turned it on. The screen lit up, and she navigated through the menus, trying to figure out what the phone was for. She stumbled upon an app that seemed unusual.<br />
<br />
Out of curiosity, Helen decided to try it out. She generated a sentence: &quot;Helen was about to prepare dinner for her six toddler sons.&quot; The sentence appeared on the screen, and Helen couldn&#39;t help but reflect on her life as a mother of sextuplets. She loved her children, but taking care of six was a lot of work. If there were fewer, maybe she wouldn&#39;t always be exhausted. She also sometimes wished they were girls so they wouldn&#39;t be so loud or mischievous. <br />
<br />
As she looked at the sentence, Helen began to wonder what it would be like if things were different. She started editing the sentence, her fingers moving across the screen. She changed the number of children and their gender: &quot;Helen was about to prepare dinner for her three toddler daughters.&quot; She hesitated for a moment before hitting the confirm button.<br />
<br />
Immediately, reality changed. Helen noticed that all the toddler stuff had been considerably reduced, and the toys and decorations were now more colorful and girly. Not only that, all the family photos had been altered, and instead of their six children, there were now only three. And the most notable thing of all was that their three children were now girls. Helen&#39;s eyes widened in amazement as she took in the new reality.<br />
<br />
She stood there for a moment, stunned, but also intrigued. Instead of telling Jack about the phone, she decided not to mention it to him for the time being. Helen decided to make all the changes permanent and ensure everyone&#39;s memories were consistent with the new reality. This way, everyone would think that this was how things had always been, except Helen. In Jane&#39;s case, although she would think she was always a girl, she would still remember the phone and her life as an adult. After this change, Helen hid the phone in a secret place that only she knew about, her mind racing with possibilities.<br />
<br />
Some time passed, and Jane finally began to wake up. When she finally awoke, she realized that some things had changed while she slept. She was now in a playpen in what appeared to be the living room. Her brothers were there with her, but there weren&#39;t five of them anymore, but two. Plus, they were now girls. And all three of them were now wearing colorful pajamas with butt flaps, which only made their diapers more noticeable.<br />
<br />
Jane&#39;s eyes scanned the room, taking in the new surroundings. She began to wonder if one of her parents was responsible for all this. If so, she had to find that phone quickly. Maybe her memories were different now, but she still knew she wasn&#39;t a 2-year-old but an adult. With all her strength, Jane stood up and began to toddle toward the side of the playpen. But before she could go any further, she began to feel a sharp pain in her stomach. Jane wasn&#39;t sure why it hurt, but most likely she was hungry.<br />
<br />
As she stood there, Jane soon began to notice the smell coming from the kitchen, and her stomach began to growl even more. The aroma of food wafted through the air, making her mouth water. Jane wondered if it was better to wait until they were fed and then look for her phone or if it was better to try to find it right away. She looked at her sisters, who were now playing, and then at the playpen, wondering how she could get out of it. Jane&#39;s determination grew, and she knew she had to find a way to get that phone.</p>
