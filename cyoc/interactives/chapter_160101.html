<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">A car pulled up to the establishment, early due to good traffic and some...incidents, the license plate reading WITCH!, and the whole thing being of a sporty make, chosen for the wealthy scion of magical parents. The door slid open on its own and out stepped Bethicia first, followed by the other doors opening shortly for two of her girl posse chosen to assist her that day, and her current boyfriend Charles.<br />
<br />
Bethicia was a tall, blood red haired witch - her hair went down just past her neck, lightly curling and gracefully framing her face. Her skin was pale and milky, her eyes were cruelly ice-blue, and her build was athletic and gifted. She wore a red, very showy dress to compliment her hair, and a pair of black skin tight gloves on her hands. Her feet were framed by tight boots. As she put it often, her toadies knew to trust her wisdom or discover what happened to a toad when Bergdorf boots connect with toad backs.<br />
<br />
Her girl posse basically tried to look like lesser versions of her, to flatter and hopefully appease her. Truth be told, Bethicia did not care. She didn&#39;t need flattery, but she appreciated the effort they put in at least.<br />
<br />
Charles was her latest boyfriend, from a similarly wealthy family, though one without magic. He was tall, easily six foot four, and heavily muscled. She liked the difference in him that he wasn&#39;t just another tight bodied male model looking type - Charles was built, but he was stocky. His gut was large, but didn&#39;t look too unsightly. And in the dress shirt and pants, he just looked dapper to her. The windswept blond hair and the complimentary blue eyes were lovely, and Bethicia hoped he did nothing to earn her ire.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey babe, this looks like a great party...so many people here already...&quot; Charles marveled at it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ohh yes, baby, and I look forward...&quot; Bethicia said, running her finger on the light stubble she permitted to be on Charles&#39; jawline, &quot;...to enjoying your company after.&quot; She could tell when she did that Charles experienced a burst of erotic interest. The grin on his face told Bethicia all she needed to know. She loved a man like him.<br />
<br />
Approaching the restaurant and entering, they were met by of all people Kat.<br />
<br />
Bethicia put her hand to her waist and giggled, &quot;Ohh my~ Kat! Here at this lovely establishment? Don&#39;t TELL me you somehow ensorcelled your way in.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kat glowered at her, &quot;I don&#39;t need to bewitch anyone, Bethicia.&quot; That line being rather pointed, she evidently hoped to quiet Bethicia down. Instead, the rival witch chuckled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, so catty, but you know, I think its easy to tell when something or rather, someone, does not belong. You look as out of place...&quot; Bethicia said with a flourish of her hand, &quot;...as your brother at a party. Speaking of, how&#39;s the little sex freak?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He&#39;s...he&#39;s fine...totally fine.&quot; Kat looked to the side, trying not to give Bethicia any hint at what might be happening here. If...if she got the indication that lobster was Dan, she would look even freakier than him. If that was at all possible. And Bethicia being who she was---!<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll just leave you to your social awkwardness and mumbling. Have fun being socially irrelevant!&quot; And with that Bethicia walked off, her girl posse letting out a dual &quot;Yeah~!&quot; as well. Charles dutifully followed behind, despite being rather confused as to why Bethicia and Kat were even feuding at all.<br />
<br />
Bethicia got a table for them and let them take their orders first - why be a boss over these people if not the kind that made people WANT to work for you? - and then started looking around. She found herself looking at a peculiar lobster laying prone. It just seemed to be quivering there somewhat awkwardly. Hm...Bethicia started to get a little suspicious when she examined it with her &quot;witch vision&quot; and saw a curiously large amount of magic coming off this thing.<br />
<br />
Could it be?<br />
<br />
&quot;No...&quot; Bethicia whispered to herself, thinking what this meant. Could that really be? She fired up the telepathy and connected to the lobster just to make sure.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, are you uh...Bethicia?&quot; Dan&#39;s voice came in rather shaky and obviously afraid. Much as she enjoyed the quivering and fear of her rivals, Bethicia was still rather shocked by Dan&#39;s state.<br />
<br />
Had Kat - samey old social disaster Kat - really went as far as turning her own brother into a lobster that was now due to be EATEN and ripped to pieces by a bunch of businessmen? Damn, Kat really seemed to let her freak flag fly when she had power over someone. Bethicia admitted she was no one to speak of moral use of witch powers, but still. Even she didn&#39;t do anything like this to her 12 year old brother Eric.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, that would be me.&quot; Bethicia started into the telepathic link, &quot;And who are you, little crustacean?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m uh...I&#39;m Dan, and I&#39;m apparently due to get eaten and all here...&quot; Dan seemed to try to look around, and he said, &quot;Now that I&#39;ve got this going on though, much as the size difference is kinda nice, I&#39;m not entirely sure. I-I mean, I&#39;m sorry. I&#39;m so weird, sharing these kinds&#39;a fantasies...&quot;<br />
<br />
Bethicia decided she could well make use of this. Dan was obviously very into experimental stuff. He was after all teenaged. And right now he was a freaking lobster. Maybe going forward she could use this. Turn Dan to her advantage in regards to Kat. She knew how Kat didn&#39;t exactly like her. Plenty of ideas how to go about this Dan thing...<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry Danny...&quot; The witch said with a grin, &quot;In fact, I have an idea. How about you and I...talk, among some other possible things. I think I might be able to patch you up and turn you human enough to...see where things go.&quot; Much as she disliked the idea of letting Dan do anything, she liked the idea of an unwitting spy even more.<br />
<br />
Dan went quiet for a moment. Much as this fulfilled some of his...odder fantasies, Bethicia was hot. Like, hot damn. He wanted her, and he knew it. And she could patch up his exoskeleton AND make him just human enough to---!? Yes, the idea excited Dan, and that was enough to make him decide. &quot;Yeah! Yeah let&#39;s do it.&quot;<br />
<br />
He knew Kat warned him about Bethicia, but she didn&#39;t seem that mean to him.</p>
