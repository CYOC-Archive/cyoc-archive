<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jake took the shoes and headed home. As he sat at his sofa He slipped on the wing tips and a haze enveloped <br />
his vision.<br />
<br />
As it cleared he looked around and this wasn't his apartment any more. He was in a large house. All alone <br />
except for a couple of large dogs. <br />
<br />
As Jake surveyed his surroundings he looked down at himself and noticed that he was in a three piece suit. Now <br />
Jake had never liked dressing up but it seemed right to him.<br />
<br />
As he stood he realized one other thing. He was taller than his former self. Jake just had to get a look at <br />
his new body. He ran up to his bedroom and stood in the walk in closet lined with mirrors and looked at <br />
himself. He looked hot. A nice chiseled chin. Well groomed head of hair. Deep piercing eyes. His shoulders <br />
were quite broad and his hips were quite narrow. Jake took the clothes off layer by layer till he was standing <br />
there naked ogling himself. Damn he was hot. <br />
<br />
Jake redressed and headed off to work. Somehow he knew that he was a banker in a position of some importance. <br />
He so fit into this position. How could he ever regret this decision.<br />
<br />
As Jake left for the day he stopped of at a swank little bistro and had a late meal. This seemed like <br />
something he would have done for the last 20 years. And as he left he went around the corner to a bar.<br />
<br />
This was where things began to get a little strange. It was a bear/leather bar. As he went in there was not a <br />
single man that looked around as though this were an odd thing. Jake seemed to be a regular. Now many watched <br />
as he came in because he was so good looking that you just had to watch him.<br />
<br />
Jake sat down and a twink in leather shorts came over and took his order.<br />
<br />
It was a parade of men coming over to chat with him but none struck his fancy this night until it was late in <br />
the evening when a big burly man, beard down to his chest and belly that stuck out of his leather vest. His <br />
chaps straining at the waist and his harness looking more like a bra than a harness. It looked and smelled <br />
like he hadn't washed in weeks. <br />
<br />
Jake could tell this was the man by the growing pressure in his groin.<br />
<br />
Jake and the pig talked for awhile and when it got close to closing they got up and the big guy excused <br />
himself. He went out to the patio bar and came back leading a bullmastif.<br />
<br />
Jake took the man back to his home where he led him to a room prepared for any sort of sexual perversion. <br />
There the big man strapped Jake to a bench and had his dog mount Jake. This didn't seem as though it was <br />
unusual for Jake as the dog found his mark quickly and soon was tied to the dog. While Jake was enjoying the <br />
pleasure of the dog the big man had gotten undressed and lifted his belly to gain access to his cock for Jake <br />
to suck. His groin stunk of sex which just excited Jake even more.<br />
<br />
As the big man and the dog took their time with Jake. Jake became more exhausted and eventually passed out.<br />
<br />
When Jake woke the man and his dog had gone. Jake was still strapped to the bench but the key was connected to <br />
his right hand and he was free.<br />
<br />
Jake woke ready for a new day and as he took a shower he noticed that there was something odd at his groin. He <br />
had thought it was the over stretching of his ass by the dog but it was his balls. They were black.<br />
<br />
Before he left the big man had banded Jake and his balls had died with the lack of blood flowing to them. <br />
Having read much about the procedure and thinking about eventually doing it he knew what to think but he <br />
hadn't planned on it.<br />
<br />
He freaked a bit but was resigned to his fate. It was now too late. <br />
<br />
When Jake's balls eventually fell off it was a relief. Touching them and having that swing between his legs <br />
was painful.<br />
<br />
It was months later when he found the big man again and they sat and talked. Evidently Jake had confided in <br />
the big man that he had thought about doing this and that was why it happened.<br />
<br />
Even though Jake was still a very hansom man he hadn't taken any of the hormone replacements, too embarrassed <br />
to go to the Dr. about it so he had lost some muscle mass and his chest had started to develop into breasts.<br />
<br />
The big man and the bullmastif moved in with Jake and the experimented with all sorts of kinky perversions. <br />
Jake, in the position he was in took care of the big man realizing that he had been a trash man before. Jake <br />
would clean him up from time to time when they would go out to a fancy party but Jake liked him dirty.</p>
