<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Brandon bit his lip and walked over to his phone, once again it refused him entry based on facial recognition and he had to tap in his passcode. He needed to remember to fix that later. He headed back to the kitchen, still buck naked from his shower, a hookup was needed more than clothes right now. But just as he was about to tap in a text, one came in.<br />
<br />
&#39;its jake got ur # from ur order. off in 15 want company?&#39;<br />
<br />
Brandon stared at the text for a while, his finger hovering over the keypad before finally typing &#39;come over&#39;. What the fuck was he doing? He wasn&#39;t thinking straight, fuck, he had forgotten how hard it had been to think with anything other than his dick back when his hormones still raged as hard as they were now. Even thinking about Jake coming over had his hand drifting down to his cock. How many times had he cum today so far? Three.. he hadn&#39;t done that in decades.<br />
<br />
He must have been lost in his thoughts for a while, or Jake was on the road expecting an affirmative reply because his doorbell rang. He wasn&#39;t even thinking of his lack of clothing as he strode over an pulled open the door. Luckily it wasn&#39;t someone else he was flashing with his nudity, but it was indeed Jake that stood there. He had taken off his work shirt and now stood in just his jeans and a white tee that looked almost painted on. It clung to his pecs, and even bunched up a little between his shoulders and upper arm muscles.<br />
<br />
Jake bit his lip as he looked Brandon up and down. &quot;Did you even get dressed again?&quot;<br />
<br />
Did Jake have that blond scruff on his jaw when he was here before? Brandon couldn&#39;t recall, he even looked buffer, but maybe that was just the tight tee rather than the unappealing polo. &quot;Uh.. no.&quot; Brandon answered honestly, stepping aside so Jake could come in. He felt his heart pounding in his chest as he stared at Jake&#39;s denim covered ass. Was he.. nervous? Brandon Whyte had never been nervous in his life.<br />
<br />
He followed Jake into the house, stopping as the young man.. other young man suddenly turned around and pulled him in to lock lips. He had sworn he was larger than Jake at their last encounter, but he could tell this close they were pretty much the same size. Likely pretty similar in the cock department, too, if that bulge pushed up against his own rock hard cock was any clue.<br />
<br />
This was so different than being with a woman. He didn&#39;t feel like he was going to break Jake if he suddenly decided to get rough, and he was being met strength for strength as their arms intertwined. The lip lock only ended when Jake pulled back to remove his tee shirt.<br />
<br />
Brandon could feel the first dribbles of pre leave his cock as he finally got a look at Jake&#39;s bare torso. The polo had really hid some nice muscle mass, and a bit of blond fur across his chest that Brandon wanted to rub his face in.<br />
<br />
&quot;Glad you aren&#39;t one of those guys that likes smooth little twinks.&quot; Jake said as he preened a little under Brandon&#39;s gaze. &quot;Why be with a guy if you aren&#39;t going to be with a guy, know what I mean?&quot; Jake looked down at himself with a bit of pride. &quot;Been hitting the weights harder, think it&#39;s finally showing.&quot; Jake definitely looked more masculine than he had before. He wasn&#39;t older or younger just.. manlier.<br />
<br />
Brandon just nodded his head. &quot;I.. yeah.&quot; He was dumbfounded, maybe it wasn&#39;t just the weights, what would another dose of his cum do to this kid. But he found himself grabbing Jake&#39;s hand and leading him to the bedroom. When had Brandon Whyte ever been concerned how his actions would affect someone else? No.. he was all about getting what he wanted, and right now he wanted Jake.<br />
<br />
Jake dug in his pocket as they entered the bedroom, putting something between his teeth as he then worked at the fly of his jeans. He dropped his pants and stepped out of them, now showing off his well muscled legs and a cock that Brandon noted with a bit of annoyance that was slightly longer than his own, even if it wasn&#39;t as thick. <br />
<br />
With a light push, Jake sent Brandon sprawling back onto the bed, then tore open the package between his teeth. A condom. Brandon spread his legs so Jake could get access to his thick cock to roll the condom on, if Jake wanted to ride his cock he wasn&#39;t going to argue. And it would solve the infectious cum issue.<br />
<br />
Except Jake was rolling the condom on over his own dick.<br />
<br />
No! That was the line. Brandon may be able to put up with having sex with men if it meant being cancer free and young again, but he was going to be the top. He was the dominant one. He was the alpha. He wasn&#39;t fighting as Jake lifted his legs up to his shoulders and lined his cock up with Brandon&#39;s hole. &quot;God, I love a guy with a fuzzy ass.&quot; Jake said almost purring as his hands gripped Brandon&#39;s waist and the once alpha male shuddered as he felt his virgin hole being penetrated for the first time in his 55 years of life.<br />
<br />
It was the best feeling he had ever had. The pain of being stretched out mixed with the pleasure of something buried deep inside him, rubbing at some hidden treasure deep inside of him that sent wracking waves of ecstasy through his whole body. He gripped his bed sheets as Jake started thrusting into him, each pounding thrust more insistent than the last. Brandon was being fucked as hard and eagerly as he himself had done to many a woman.<br />
<br />
There wasn&#39;t even a hand on his cock and a steady stream of his own pre was leaking out of his cock and onto his stomach. He didn&#39;t need to be touched, being filled with Jake&#39;s hard cock was more than enough to start pushing him to orgasm. He could feel that cock swelling and twitching inside of him.<br />
<br />
They came at the same time. Brandon&#39;s cum landing in thick ropes on his chest and stomach. Jake&#39;s filling up the condom as he kept himself hilted inside Brandon&#39;s aching hole. After a moment Jake pulled out, removed and tied off the condom to toss it away before he dropped down onto he bed next to Brandon. Jake&#39;s finger ran along Brandon&#39;s checked picked up one rope of cum, and he held it out towards Brandon who without thinking licked the finger clean. It was salty, and musky, and oddly delicious. Jake helped himself to a taste as well with a grin.<br />
<br />
&quot;You going to be in town long? I wouldn&#39;t mind doing this more. I mean, I&#39;m just here myself until I head back to college, but...&quot; Jake was grinning at Brandon, though the once elder man was having trouble thinking. He had just bottomed for a guy, and now he was being.. what? Asked to be a regular booty call? &quot;I guess you&#39;ll be going back to school too?&quot;<br />
<br />
School? Did he really look that young? &quot;Something like that.&quot; He finally offered with a shrug. Jake was exploring his body with his hand, part of Brandon still wanted to slap the hand away, but another part of him wanted to nestle into Jake, the later part won. He felt a strong arm wrap around him and pull them close, Jake&#39;s chest pressed up against his back and that still semi-firm cock pressed against his ass. &quot;Your parents aren&#39;t going to walk in, are they?&quot; Jake asked with a note of concern.<br />
<br />
&quot;No. I&#39;m here alone.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Not completely alone.&quot; Lips and stubble pressed against the back of his neck and before he knew it he was falling asleep in the protective embrace of some kid more than thirty years his junior. And it made him feel good.<br />
<br />
Brandon woke up the next morning still entwined with Jake. He carefully pulled himself free as so not to wake him and went to take care of the most pressing problem. Which was at the moment between jacking off and taking a piss. He stood at the toilet, trying to think of anything other than last night and the guy still laying in his bed to get a stream going, and finally managed to soften up enough to start filling the bowl. As he finished he looked down and nearly jumped in shock.<br />
<br />
He had lost a bit more of his mass, he was still well toned and all muscle, but he had the lean cut physique of a swimmer, not the bulk of a football player he used to have. His chest was sporting  bit less hair as well, as was his stomach. He quickly made his was over to the vanity and peered into the mirror. He barely recognized the kid staring back at him. And a kid he was, probably only eighteen or nineteen. He still had a bit of stubble along his jaw, too, but like his chest hair it wasn&#39;t as full as it had been yesterday. Shit, he probably wouldn&#39;t look out of place at a senior prom! Well, it could be worse, he could be one of those smooth little twinks Jake had mentioned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Holy shit!&quot; The shout had come from the bedroom and Brandon quickly went to the door to peer out at Jake sitting up in bed running his hands over his torso. If Brandon had lost twenty pound of muscle, Jake had gained it, if not more. He had significantly bulked out, still not as big as Brandon had been two days ago, but he definitely had packed on the muscle, and hair. It made him look older, but Brandon would wager he hadn&#39;t actually aged at all. Surprisingly the serum also hadn&#39;t made him younger, it just seemed to cause some random physical changes. He was one hunky twenty year old.<br />
<br />
Jake was running his hands over his plumper pectorals, and the spread of blond curls that almost completely covered them. Even the stubble on his jaw would more easily be called a short beard now. His arms were thicker as he flexed and when he finally hopped out of the bed even his ass and thighs were bigger. &quot;What the fuck happened to me?&quot;<br />
<br />
Then Jake noticed Brandon standing in the doorframe. &quot;What the fuck happened to you?&quot;<br />
<br />
And Brandon spilled. &quot;I.. I took a serum, medical trial thing. It caused changes in me.. I didn&#39;t know it could spread.. well.. not the first time we.. but.. I.. please don&#39;t be mad.&quot; Was he begging someone not to be mad at him? The old Brandon would have cringed, his current self wanted this hunk not to be mad with him so as to get more.. what? Attention? Sex?<br />
<br />
&quot;Mad? Why would I be fucking mad? I mean, I&#39;m going to have to explain some shit somehow but holy fuck!&quot; Jake flexed and Brandon found his cock springing back to life at the sight. &quot;I&#39;d happily screw you again just as thanks. But if you get any younger..&quot;<br />
<br />
It was a bit of a slap in the face, and a reminder that while he was still a jock, he looked like he was barely out of high school. &quot;Right.. I need to call the doctor.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jake had picked up his jeans and were looking at them, then down at his legs. &quot;I don&#39;t think my clothes are going to fit.. me. They might be a little loose on you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Brandon had picked up his phone, but motioned Jake to his closet. &quot;Some of my old clothes will probably fit you.&quot; Jake gave the closet a confused look as Brandon quickly walked out of the room to save himself another moment of embarrassment, or thoughts of wanting to lay on top of that muscular hunk and ride his cock till he couldn&#39;t cum anymore. This was not him.<br />
<br />
Jannes had to have a way to stop this.. or even reverse it. If not, well, Brandon may not have his old body but he had his money and his connections. He always got what he wanted, and right now, he wanted control back.</p>
