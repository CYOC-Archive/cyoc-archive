<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Nate hit 18 - 4 and EXECUTE.  A flash of light, and at first, nothing seemed to happen.  But then, he saw Paige's features soften, and her uniform grow baggy as she began to shrink into a girl a few months away from 14 years old.  She looked less tired, and much cuter.  Nate felt very aroused right now, he shouldn't be thinking this way about his sister, but damn!  <br />
<br />
He should change her back, but he decided not to.  He wondered if her mind was affected, would she think she was almost 14 again, or keep her same mind?<br />
<br />
Just then, Paige began to stir, and Nate fled the scene.<br />
<br />
----<br />
<br />
Paige yawned and stretched.  Wow, that nap had felt good!  She'd been so tired lately, with work and studying, but now, she had energy to spare.  Sitting up, she didn't notice anything different at first.  Wow, it was still early, she'd thought she'd been out longer than this.<br />
<br />
Standing up, her apron slid off downwards.  Stupid thing, it must have come loose again.  Her socks fell looser as well.  Sheesh, she must be losing weight.<br />
<br />
She headed to the bathroom, where she was confronted by the mirror.<br />
<br />
&quot;Holy shit!&quot;<br />
<br />
----<br />
<br />
Nate pumped his fist.  Score!<br />
<br />
----<br />
<br />
Paige couldn't believe her eyes.  She looked...young!  Quickly taking off her shirt, she saw her bra was loose on her chest, and sure enough, her breasts had shrunk in size.  She'd never had large breasts, but it was like she was 13 again, where she didn't even need to wear a training bra!<br />
<br />
She touched a breast, feeling how sensitive it was.  It was impossible, but somehow, she'd gotten younger!  She'd lost several inches of height as well..she'd had a large growth spurt around her 15t birthday...she guessed her height at 5' 5&quot;!<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok, don't panic.  Think Paige...think...&quot;<br />
<br />
----<br />
<br />
Nate heard Paige run to her room and slam the door.  Darn, he was hoping to see her at this age.  His stomach rumbling, he warmed up some leftovers.  &quot;Hey Sis, I'm making something to eat!&quot;<br />
<br />
He heard a muffled reply, and guessed she'd be out in a minute.<br />
<br />
Sure enough, Paige came out, wearing low heels, and some of her older clothing.  She'd put on a lot of makeup, and he had to admit, he could barely notice the loss of a few years.<br />
<br />
&quot;What's with the makeup, Sis?  You going out?&quot;<br />
<br />
Paige shrugged nervously.  &quot;Just trying out something new.  What do you think?&quot;<br />
<br />
He hid a smile.  &quot;I think it makes you look older.&quot;<br />
<br />
Paige sighed in relief as he handed her a plate.  They ate quietly, but Nate could tell she was nervous.  Then they heard their parent's car pull in.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ugh, Mom and Dad already?  Great.&quot;  Paige didn't look happy at all.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know, I got another D.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh man, I'm sorry Nate.  What are you going to do?&quot;<br />
<br />
Nate shrugged.  &quot;Get grounded, what else?  S'okay, I should study more, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
Without thinking, Paige reached over to ruffle his hair.  She wsn't all that much taller than he was now, even with her heels.  He imagined her even shorter...oh man, he coudln't wait...<br />
<br />
The confrontation with his parents went rather well.  His Dad just shook his head and sent him off to his room, while his Mom kept looking at Paige oddly.<br />
<br />
----<br />
<br />
It was three in the morning when Nate crept out of his room via the window, and headed for his sister's room.  He paused, seeing his parents in bed.  He couldn't resist.<br />
<br />
His mother had an age value of 38, and his dad was a 40.  38 - 8 = 30, EXECUTE.  His Mom's features softened, and she looked a lot less tired.  As for his Dad, 40 +5 = 45.  Grey hairs showed up on his Dad, and he looked more tired, if anything.  Bwa ha ha!<br />
<br />
Leaving his parents, he missed the results of his mischief.<br />
<br />
Carol woke feeling aroused like she hadn't been in years.  She reached over to get Mark's attention.  The poor thing looked so worn out.  After a few minutes, she got a muffled &quot;sorry honey...tired&quot; from her husband.<br />
<br />
Fuming, Carol went to her bathroom.  It wasn't like she asked for sex that often!  What, now that she was older, he didn't find her attractive?  He was probably cheating on her, the SOB!<br />
<br />
Looking in the mirror, Carol was suprised.  She looked really good, come to think about it.  Almost ten years younger.  Maybe it was all in her head, how unattractive and wore out she had been feeling lately?  Taking off her bathrobe, she struck a pose, her breasts looking firmer.  There was no reason her husband could be turned off by this body!  Her working out and dieting must have been making her sexier all along.  <br />
<br />
Well, she thought, as a grin came to her face, if her husband didn't appreciate her, maybe someone else would...<br />
<br />
----<br />
<br />
Outside Paige's window, Nate had to do some quick math.  Ok, so her value is 1 for her size.  How much smaller did he want her to be?  Ugh, he was a bit tired...he decided to multiply 1 x 0.7.  He nodded and slipped off, not even waiting to see Paige begin to shrink...<br />
<br />
----<br />
<br />
Carol was up early, having found some of her older clothes.  She felt so much better.  She made breakfast for the kids, even though it was Saturday, and she found herself humming while doing so.<br />
<br />
Nate was up first, he was such a handsome boy.  She imagined what he'd be like when he was older, then immediately shook it off.  There was no doubt, she needed sex badly!<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, hi honey, hungry?&quot;<br />
<br />
Nate blinked.  Wow, Mom looked great!  In fact, she was hot!  Now he wanted to see her even younger, but he'd have to wait for now.  &quot;Yeah Mom, thanks!&quot;<br />
<br />
He dug in while waiting for the rest of the household.<br />
<br />
His Dad staggered in next, looking completely wore out as he sat down.  Mom looked sad, seeing her husband like this.  He looked easily five years older!<br />
<br />
Nate hid a grin, because that's exactly what had happened.  But Paige never came to the table. <br />
<br />
----<br />
<br />
Carol knocked on her daughter's door, only to hear a muffled voice say &quot;not hungry&quot;.<br />
<br />
Something was wrong with Paige, she was sure of it, but she knew her daughter would come to her in her own time.  Shrugging it off, she got her purse and announced she was going out.  Mark just mumbled something, watching Golf, of all things, on tv.<br />
<br />
Ooh that man!<br />
<br />
As she walked to the car, she didn't notice her son aiming a strange device at her from his window.<br />
<br />
30 - 5 = 25...</p>
