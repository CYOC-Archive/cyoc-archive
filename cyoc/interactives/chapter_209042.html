<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">John and Chris spent a few blissful hours thinking they would get a great life from now on. How wrong they were. Then again, they never thought that an old woman that had an extraordinary magical goose could also know more things about magic, potentially dangerous things, and seek revenge on them. Not only had they been not very smart, they had stolen from someone and all in all, they deserved to be taught a lesson. And anyone knew that those delivered by witches could be very, very bad indeed. As the two fools kept imagining all the things they&#39;d buy thanks to their new goose, they were completely unaware that the witch had found them, all thanks to a little crystal ball she kept. But she did not come alone, oh no. She brought along two impressive friends who owed her a favour. A favour they would be only too happy to perform. As she neared the derelict cabin of the two idiotic thieves, she smiled. Raucous and loud and vulgar, they were. Well! She was even more justified to teach them a lesson about behaving properly. And as she was in her right, she;&#39;d make the most of it. <br />
<br />
She entered the place, banging the door open, as the two pals were listing all the woman in brothels they pay for. So crude! Good thing she was there to put a stop to such awful conversations. She did see Damon in a cage, but safe and sound. It was already something. The two idiots stared at her but not for long. They insulted her and asked her what she was doing here. The nerve!<br />
&quot;I am here for my goose and my belongings. Give them back now or face the consequences.&quot;<br />
Naturally they laughed and refused, hurling more insults at her. No surprise there. But it added a sense of drama and a chance for the thieves to come clean, offering a good measure of magnanimity to look good later. <br />
&quot;Have at you, then!&quot; she shouted, waving her wand at them.<br />
Chris and John felt themselves shrinking, the world looming brutally above them. They suddenly, in a few seconds, found themseves the size of dolls, at about a foot in height. And they were naked! The witch hadn&#39;t bothered to make their clothes shrink with them so they emerged from the piles, utterly mortified and covering their groins with sharp screams of fright and outrage. The witch cackled heartily.<br />
&quot;Much better! Cut down to size, haven&#39;t you? But your punishment has barely started! Have at them, girls!&quot;    <br />
Damon, from his cage, watched as much fascinated as terrified, as two gigantic spiders emerged from the shadows behind the witch. Enormous things, brown, very hairy and looking extremely fearsome. They scuttled towards the two petty burglars, who ran desperately, so frightened they started crying and pleading in tiny voices. The spiders rapidly snatched them and held them against their bodies, their arms and legs immobilised by four hairy legs, while the back ones served them to stand upright. Chris and John begged not to be eaten and said they were sorry and that they&#39;d do anything to pay her back. <br />
&quot;My two pretty friends don&#39;;t usually eat humans. Too chewy and tasteless for them. But there are exceptions. Are you sure you don&#39;t want to be eaten?&quot;<br />
The two friends nodded and shouted for mercy. The witch was delighted. She had never intended for her two beauties to kill these idiots. They preferred insects. But she needed them scared and believing of the worse. Begging for mercy and shaking in fright, she had them right where she wanted them. She needed them willing to be a bit more obedient and compliant. <br />
&quot;Will you really do what I want you to?&quot;<br />
The two burglars shouted their assurances to do her bidding, anything she wanted, fervently and with all the promises in the world.<br />
&quot;Very well,&quot; she pretended to relent gratefully. &quot;I&#39;ll hold you to your word. If you don&#39;t do as I say, my beauties will come back and have a little snack.&quot;<br />
The thieves breathed out in relief but not for long.<br />
&quot;However, you do need to understand I&#39;m in charge now. And you deserve some form of immediate punishment.&quot;<br />
She snapped her fingers and the spiders knew exactly what to do. They used their two remaining hairy paws to tickle the two burglars. Tickle hard and long. At first they gasped in surprise but soon the house resonated with they laughs. They squirmed but the spiders held firmly, lightly gliding their legs across the skin of their victims. The hair of the legs tickled and their claws scratched so lightly the two giggling tiny men were left to endure a painless torture. Their feet and underarms received the worst of it and they begged again for mercy, their bodies racked by spasms. The spiders took their time, loving to discover a new ticklish spot, all to elicit more roars of laughter. The witch joined in, dangling a feather in front of their eyes and proceeding to participate in the tickling. The feather was now enormous compared to them and all the more wide in its range of tickling. The witch taunted them, saying they writhed like little grubs and calling them babies, naughty little boys and the like. Assaulted by tickles, they all agreed to whatever she said, still asking for it to stop. She did not for a very, very long time, insisting they answer by the affirmative to the names she bestowed upon them. Among them were &quot;cute little dolls&quot;, &quot;tickle toys&quot;, &quot;little baby boys&quot;, &quot;cutesie poo slaves&quot;, &quot;future compliant sissy servants&quot; and the sort. Chris and John all shouted loud and clear that it was what they were, all of it. <br />
<br />
Finally, after much squirming, poking of soles and armpits from the witch, giggling and peals of laughter, the witch declared a stop to the fun and games. She conjured up outside a wagon from an abandoned wheelbarrow, magically transferred the stolen goods there and it started following her with much creaking on its own. Damon in his cage was in it too and the spiders followed as well. They wrapped their two prisoners in tough silk, letting only their heads and feet poke out, placing them on their backs. If they got bored, they tickled the feet of the two captives, enjoying their wriggling feet and toes. <br />
When they arrived, the witch replaced with a wave of her wand everything in place. She then asked the spiders to settle the two tiny men on the ground and thanked them. The giant spiders left into the night. As for the witch, she conjured up to cribs, small and obviously meant for dolls and placed them inside, tucking them in and wishing them good night. Too frightened to swear, they still scowled at her at the humiliation. She laughed and put a sleeping spell on them. In seconds, they were snoring softly. She could not wait to try out her ideas on these two idiots starting tomorrow.</p>
