<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Katie and Bobby walked down the beach, looking for an appropriate child to test their magic with. It didn&#39;t take them very long to find a candidate. A group of preteen girls were picking on a younger girl. She was only 7 years old with cherry-red hair, heavily freckled skin, and emerald eyes that didn&#39;t quite match the lime green of her two-piece. However, those eyes were now leaking tears as the older girls were laying into them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Connect-the-Dots,&quot; teased one girl.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ginger Pox,&quot; teased another.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, leave her alone!&quot; called Bobby. The older girls looked at him before quickly walking away. <br />
<br />
Katie knelt down besides the crying girl and asked, &quot;Are you ok?&quot;<br />
<br />
The girl sniffed and said, &quot;Those big girls are so mean. It&#39;s not my fault I have so many freckles.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course it&#39;s not,&quot; said Katie soothingly as she put a hand on the girl&#39;s shoulder. She could feel a slight tingle and knew that the magic was starting. She had 20 seconds before the girl would start to grow and she wanted to make sure she put on the right track. &quot;You&#39;re beautiful in your own way,&quot; said Katie, &quot;If they can&#39;t see that, it&#39;s because they barely know what beauty means.&quot; She smirked a little before saying, &quot;In fact, if I were you, I&#39;d go over to them and tell them how they are to be saying you&#39;re ugly.&quot;<br />
<br />
The redhead could feel a slight tingle, but she didn&#39;t pay it any attention. For some reason, this lady&#39;s words were filling her with confidence. &quot;Yeah, you&#39;re right,&quot; she said, &quot;Who do they think they are, making fun of people like that. I&#39;m gonna give them a piece of my mind!&quot; With that, she turned and stomped off in the direction the older girls had watched.<br />
<br />
As she walked, she wasn&#39;t aware that her body was growing. Her limbs started stretching out, making her strides longer, covering more ground than they had before. Her torso lengthened, extending the gap between her upper and lower pieces. The chubbiness started draining from her body, making her lankier than she was before.<br />
<br />
Eventually, she spotted the girls from before and called, &quot;Hey, stop right there!&quot; When the girls turned, they saw a preteen girl not any older than them. The subtle changes in reality prevented them from noticing her change in size, but they recognized her pretty easily.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, come back for more, Ginger?&quot; asked one of the girls mockingly.<br />
<br />
&quot;My name isn&#39;t Ginger!&quot; snapped the redhead, &quot;You can&#39;t just call people names like that!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Better get used to it, Freckles,&quot; said another one of the girls.<br />
<br />
&quot;Who do you think you are?&quot; snapped the redhead, &quot;You&#39;re not any better than anyone else! You think just because you think you look pretty means you can pick on people who don&#39;t seem pretty enough?&quot; As she went through her tirade, the redhead continued to change. By then, she had reached the girls&#39; ages and passed them. Her body kept stretching upwards, limbs getting longer. Her top piece started to bulge as mounds appeared under her nipples. Her bottom piece was also stretching as her hips started to widen. Curiously, the freckles on her skin started to become thicker, swallowing up all the white spaces between them. And yet the rest of her skin was gaining a darker color.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not everyone is going to be as pretty as us,&quot; said one of the girls a bit uncertainly, suddenly unsure why they were arguing with this older girl.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, really?&quot; snapped the redhead, &quot;That seems like a pretty stupid way to behave. You think acting like you&#39;re the elite is going to get you many friends in life?&quot; Her vocabulary was growing along with her body. Her cherry red hair was extending further down her back. Her curves started increasing much more dramatically. Her mounds quickly inflated into full globes that kept getting bigger while her hips spread widely as her butt started gaining mass. Her two piece struggled to keep up before it started to change. The color deepened, changing from lime green to emerald like her eyes. They changed shape, becoming a bikini set better designed to show off her considerable assets. The freckles on her body had merged together into a darker shape across her body that was lightening as the same time that her unblemished skin was darkening.  &quot;You girls are starting down a bad path,&quot; said the redhead, her face becoming more mature and more beautiful, &quot;If you keep being rotten to others, they will hate you, no matter how pretty you are. Popularity isn&#39;t about who is better in looks, but better in attitude. A terrible personality will never compensate for a pretty face. Now don&#39;t let me catch you picking on any more kids or I will find your mothers and tell them about how you are behaving.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, ma&#39;am,&quot; said the girls sullenly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good. Now go be good girls and play nice,&quot; said the redhead before walking off. Instead of a preteen girl with too many freckles, she walked away as a gorgeous young woman. Her emerald bikini hugged her body closely, showing off the curve of her breasts and ass. Her skin was a gorgeous flawless tan, something that few people would have expected to be possible with her heritage. She tossed her long red hair, feeling the sun and wind against her body. Telling off those little girls felt better than she would have thought it would have. But now she was ready to have some fun in the sun. She could work to make sure her tan wasn&#39;t fading in key spots.<br />
<br />
Katie and Bobby watched with excitement as the magic worked. If they hadn&#39;t been watching, they wouldn&#39;t have believed that fiery-haired tanned hottie was just a little girl with freckles minutes before. Though now they were the only ones who knew she was a little girl. And now that it&#39;s been proved to work, it&#39;s time to change some more kids. Up ahead, a black girl who looked to be around ten years old stood watching a 14 or 15-year-old boy work out on a bench provided for weight training. He was doing some presses while she gazed at him longingly. He didn&#39;t seem to notice she was there; at least not at first. After a while, though, he stopped to take a breather and said, rather half-heartedly, &quot;What is it, Terri?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I just wanted to thank you for letting me stay here with you while Frank went to get us some hot dogs, Shaun!&quot;, Terri said dreamily. She was too excited about his deigning to speak to her to realize his lack of enthusiasm. &quot;Is your brother on his way back yet?&quot;, Shaun asked, looking hopefully around the beach. &quot;He&#39;s been gone awhile already.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I don&#39;t think he&#39;ll be back very soon, the line&#39;s really long!&quot;, Terri said happily. She grinned sheepishly, digging her toe in the sand as she spoke. Shaun groaned to himself and said, &quot;Well, I don&#39;t mind watching you Terri, but it&#39;s weird when you stare at me like that. Why don&#39;t you build a sandcastle or something?&quot; He went back to his bench presses.<br />
<br />
Katie looked at Bobby and smiled. &quot;I think I know who we should use the ring on next.&quot; Bobby nodded in agreement. Katie approached Terri and gently said, &quot;Excuse me, Terri, is it?&quot; Terri turned in surprise and said, &quot;Yeah, who are you?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;My name&#39;s Katie and I&#39;m sorry, but I couldn&#39;t help overhearing you talking to Shaun over there, and I think I can help you. You have a crush on him, don&#39;t you?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yeah...,&quot; Terri said with a shy smile. &quot;He&#39;s my brother Frank&#39;s friend and he&#39;s so cute, but I don&#39;t think he likes me &#39;cause I&#39;m just a little kid.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmmm, I see. What if I told you that I can definitely help you with your problem? I bet I can make Shaun like you a lot!&quot; Katie said with a broad smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure, I&#39;d really like that!&quot; Terri said. She wrinkled her nose and said, &quot;But how? He&#39;s in high school already and the girls there are so pretty. Most of the time he doesn&#39;t even know I&#39;m around.&quot;<br />
<br />
Katie knelt down, put her hand on Terri&#39;s shoulder and said, &quot;Wellllll, I have a feeling that pretty soon you won&#39;t have to worry about those high school girls anymore, okay? Trust me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Um, okay...&quot; Terri&#39;s nose was still scrunched up. She couldn&#39;t quite figure out what this strange lady was talking about, let alone how she could help her with Shaun.<br />
&quot;Like I said, don&#39;t worry, Terri.&quot; Katie stood up and waved at Terri over her shoulder as she walked back to where Bobby was waiting.<br />
<br />
The ten-year-old stood there in her powder blue one-piece swimsuit thinking about the weird conversation that had just taken place when Shaun&#39;s voice brought her back to the present. &quot;Terri! Are you even listening? Stay over here, ok? Frank&#39;ll get mad if you walk off somewhere and get lost, and I don&#39;t wanna get in trouble. I knew I shoulda told him to take you with him!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry, Shaun, I&#39;ll stay here. Don&#39;t get mad, okay?&quot; Terri hung her head in embarrassment. She got so caught up talking to the strange lady that she&#39;d forgotten about Shaun having to watch her, and now he was mad at her. She felt awful. So much for not worrying about making him like her. Now he hated her! The slight tingle that had started where Katie had touched her shoulder was beginning to spread, but she was so upset about Shaun getting mad at her that she paid it no mind. After a moment she looked back up at Shaun who had resumed his workout. The longer she watched him, the better she felt. He was a very good-looking boy; almost a man, really. She could see his muscles bulge as he flexed. The tingling now suffused her entire body with a pleasant warmth, and soon she had forgotten what she was so upset about and the smile returned to her face. <br />
<br />
Her swimsuit felt a bit tight and she ran her fingers around the leg openings to stretch them out. Her legs responded by stretching, forcing her upward. Being eleven, some chubbiness still clung to Terri&#39;s legs but it slowly melted away as they lengthened. She started shifting her weight from one foot to the other, never taking her eyes off of Shaun. She reached up and tugged the increasingly snug shoulder straps as her torso and arms elongated. When the straps snapped back into place, her suit darkened to sky blue. The sound made Shaun glance in twelve-year-old Terri&#39;s direction. He thought something was different about her, but couldn&#39;t quite put his finger on it. Deciding it was nothing, he continued to lift his weights. Katie and Bobby certainly noticed a difference, though. Terri was already a few inches taller and was looking quite spindly with her slender arms and bony legs. Her short bouncy ponytail had extended to just below her shoulder blades.<br />
<br />
Terri held her hand out in front of her and examined her newly blue-polished nails. Her mom finally let her start painting her finger(and toe!)nails just a few days ago. She was the last girl in her class to start wearing nail polish. &#39;I don&#39;t care if those other girls&#39; mothers want their daughters looking like tramps in eighth grade, you&#39;ll start doing your nails when I say you can start!&#39;, was always what her mother said. After weeks of pleading she finally gave in after Terri&#39;s thirteenth birthday. &#39;I guess that&#39;s part of being a teenager now&#39;, she had told Terri. &#39;Just don&#39;t hold your breath if you want to start wearing makeup!&#39;<br />
<br />
Terri was feeling more and more confident as she continued watching Shaun. When he set the weights down again she called out to him. &quot;Looking good, Shaun!&quot; She giggled when he turned to her, and when he said, &quot;You too, Terri!&quot; and smiled, her heart melted. As for Shaun, he did think Terri was looking good, although she was a bit young for him.<br />
<br />
She pulled the neckline of her swimsuit away from her chest which was feeling somewhat constrained and let it go so that it settled back atop her small breasts. At the same time the suit darkened again to a medium blue and took on a less childish style with a higher leg cut showing a little more of Terri&#39;s hips and thighs. The bolder blue color was starting to contrast nicely with her dark skin and Shaun definitely took notice of it. Terri&#39;s hips were now pleasantly curved and gave her fourteen-year-old body a nice slim hourglass shape. &quot;Why did you stop working out? See something you like?&quot; Terri laughed, a smooth, velvety laugh. Her voice was getting lower as she matured. And her feelings toward Shaun had changed from puppy love infatuation to something else. Her legs, torso and arms grew even longer bringing her height up to over five feet, not too much shorter than Shaun. The rubber hair tie holding her ponytail disappeared and her hair fell down sweeping across her back as it grew another inch or two. It also fell down across the sides of her face, obscuring the new studs in her earlobes.<br />
<br />
Shaun, who a few moments ago had been eager for Terri&#39;s brother Frank to return so she wouldn&#39;t be as much of a bother, now didn&#39;t mind if Frank never came back. His girlfriend was here alone with him and he couldn&#39;t be happier. They were both the same age, having just turned fifteen, and were crazy about each other. &#39;She&#39;s so pretty, I don&#39;t know how I got so lucky&#39;, he thought as he studied her face. She smiled at Shaun, her full lips coated in clear gloss(was she wearing that before?) and a light touch of mascara on her long lashes(or that?) and put her arms around his neck, bringing him in for a peck on the lips that became a longer, softer kiss. He could feel her breasts brush against his chest and oddly enough as the kiss continued he could feel them pressing harder, as if they were...growing? He drove that thought from his mind, however, when it seemed Terri was getting more aggressive. What at first was a gentle closed mouth kiss had graduated to open lips, and now Terri was starting to probe Shaun&#39;s mouth with her tongue. Not that Shaun would mind a good French kiss, but something was off. Terri wasn&#39;t usually that forward. He pulled back and looked at the sixteen-year-old beauty embracing him. No matter how often he saw her he never tired of seeing that beautiful face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t stop now! We&#39;re just getting started!&quot; Terri teased with a sly smile. She swept her thick straight hair back from her face and pouted coyly, pursing her lips. She was disappointed that Shaun had broken off the kiss, but she didn&#39;t want to force things along too much and scare him off. After all, he wasn&#39;t used to being with older girls, even if the age difference was only one year. She stood back for a moment to adjust her swimsuit, with an even higher leg cut than before. It exposed a generous amount of her widening hips and swelling thighs as well as her newly expanded and still growing butt. The neckline was considerably lower than before as well and exposed her increasing cleavage, of which she was very proud. She caught the guys at school staring at her chest all the time, since she was one of the larger girls in her class, but didn&#39;t mind too much, as long as they didn&#39;t get obnoxious about it.<br />
<br />
Seventeen-year-old Terri stepped back up to Shaun and ran her fingers with their long, light blue acrylic nails down his arms and across his chest. &quot;Looks like your workouts are paying off, Shaun. Impressive muscle tone, at least for a fifteen-year-old.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Um, thanks.&quot; Shaun winced at Terri&#39;s last words. He was very self-conscious about his body, but he knew she was just messing with him. She&#39;d always been like that when he was around, and he hoped it was her way of showing she liked him and that he might have a chance with her someday. She then surprised him by suddenly stepping behind him and goosed him, laughing as he jumped. &quot;Terri, come on, don&#39;t do that!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Why Shaun,&quot; Terri said as she finally caught her breath. &quot;I just wanted to check out that cute butt, that&#39;s all.&quot; She smacked it playfully, admiring how solid it was.<br />
<br />
Since she was eighteen and in college, Terri didn&#39;t see Shaun during the school year much, so she wanted to take the opportunity while they were here at the beach to hang out for a while. He&#39;d always been around since he and Frank were little kids, and now that he was getting older, she found him to be quite attractive, although she knew he was too young for her. That didn&#39;t mean they couldn&#39;t have a little fun, though. She licked her lips as her clear lip gloss changed to dark purple glossy lipstick. Large hoop earrings replaced her studs, blue eyeshadow and long false lashes appeared on her eyelids. Her hair reached her lower back, and her once-modest child&#39;s swimsuit had become a very revealing electric blue spandex suit with plunging neckline and very high-cut legs showcasing her amazing curves. She had grown another few inches taller and was now 5&#39; 6&quot;, even taller than Shaun. Shaun had always had a crush on Terri since he was ten, but seeing her wearing this spectacular suit was almost too much for him. He had to know if she would ever be his girlfriend. &quot;Um, T-Terri?&quot; he asked nervously.<br />
<br />
&quot;What, Shaun?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Do you think we could ever, you know, um...&quot; he trailed off, losing his nerve mid-sentence.<br />
<br />
&quot;We could ever...what?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Um, you know, like, well...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;C&#39;mon, it&#39;s just me. We&#39;ve known each other for years. You can ask me anything.&quot; Terri was starting to clue in from Shaun&#39;s timidity what was going on, and couldn&#39;t help but grin slightly at Shaun&#39;s predicament.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, heh,&quot; Shaun said with an uncomfortable laugh. &quot;I guess so. Well,&quot; he paused to clear his throat. &quot;What I wanna ask is, um...&quot; Terri couldn&#39;t keep her grin from widening as she watched Shaun struggle to gather enough courage,<br />
but since he was a good kid she didn&#39;t want to prolong his agony.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you asking me out?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Um, well, yeah, if it&#39;s ok.&quot; He looked up at her sheepishly, rubbing the back of his neck.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, Shaun, you are so cute, I could just eat you up!&quot; Terri beamed and pulled Shaun into a tight hug, her large breasts almost in his face because of the height difference.<br />
&quot;Thank you so much for asking, but I think I&#39;m a little old for you. Maybe in a couple more years, ok?&quot;<br />
<br />
Shaun was clearly disappointed but not enough to break Terri&#39;s hug too soon.<br />
<br />
Katie and Bobby, having watched the whole scene play out, walked past the hugging couple and knew it was time to find someone else to try the ring on. <br />
<br />
&quot;I think our experiment is going well,&quot; she said to Bobby.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, but I think we can do more than this,&quot; said Bobby.<br />
<br />
&quot;How so?&quot; asked Katie.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ve only been changing one kid at a time, and so far it&#39;s always been girl. I think we should try changing multiple kids of a mixed group,&quot; said Bobby.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok, and where do you see such a group?&quot; asked Katie.<br />
<br />
Bobby looked around the beach. Eventually, he spotted a few kids working on a sand castle. &quot;They will do,&quot; he said. With that, he and Katie started to walk over.<br />
<br />
The kids&#39; black hair was easy to see from a distance. But as they got closer, they were able to notice the slanted eyes and facial features that showed they had Asian ancestry. There were two boys and one girl. One boy was pale, a little on the skinny side, and was wearing glasses along with blue trunks. The other boy was a bit tubby, had browner skin than the other two, and was wearing black trunks with red floral prints. The girl was younger than either of them and was wearing a white two piece. It seemed clear that the girl was the younger sister to the paler boy. The other boy seemed to be a friend of the two.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you building a sand castle?&quot; asked Katie in a sweet voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I&#39;m helping even if Alan says I get in the way a lot,&quot; said the girl.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t talk to strangers, Lacy,&quot; said the paler boy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Lacy?&quot; asked Bobby.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s short for Alicia, but Lacy&#39;s prettier. Right, Tony?&quot; asked the girl.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, sure,&quot; said the brown boy offhandedly.<br />
<br />
&quot;You want a tip to make your sand castle bigger?&quot; asked Katie.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure,&quot; said Tony.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s all a matter of how you press it,&quot; said Bobby. He took Tony&#39;s hand and pressed them gently against the sand mound. Katie guided the two siblings&#39; hands to show the right way to press the sand. Of course, that was just to start the magic working. After that, Katie and Bobby started walking off, but only to a distance where they can look back and watch the changes.<br />
<br />
The changes were subtle at first. The three kids were slowly growing bigger and not much more. But Alan and Tony were closer to being teens and when they crossed over into 13, the changes became more noticeable. It wasn&#39;t just them growing bigger. Their arms and legs were growing longer and leaner. Their torsos were also starting to stretch out. The baby fat clinging to them started melt away. In Tony&#39;s case, his fat was receding even faster.<br />
<br />
Lacy was not far behind. In fact, she seemed to be growing at a slightly faster pace. Perhaps it was because she had more years to cross than the boys and her aging was faster so she&#39;ll reach 18 at the same time that they did. Her progress through childhood was easier to notice. Not only was she growing bigger, but her limbs were growing longer and lithely. But the real indication that she was growing was how far apart the two pieces of her swimsuit were growing from each other. As Lacy reached 13, she let out a small gasp, but didn&#39;t think anything of it. She paid no attention to the mounds that were starting to push out of her chest, nor how her top was reshaping to match those mounds.<br />
<br />
As Alan and Tony got further through puberty, their development increased, their shoulders widened, their jaws grew firmer, muscular detail becoming more obvious. But Alan was clearly becoming a man who was more brains than brawn. He wasn&#39;t scrawny, but he had a leaner physique. In contrast, Tony was trading in his boyhood fat for extra muscles. His pecs and abs became defined before growing, his arms and legs growing thicker with strength. Another noticeable difference is that while Alan had relatively little hair on his body, Tony was sporting plenty of hair on his chest, arms, legs, and even down his abs to under his trunks. He even had a trim mustache growing on his handsomer face.<br />
<br />
Puberty certainly wasn&#39;t overlooking Lacy, though Alicia fitted her better now. Her willow preteen body was quickly growing into a beautiful adult body. Her skinny legs got some serious curves as her rear inflated into a proper ass. Her widening hips contrasted nicely with her trim stomach, creating the waspish waist that were so appealing in Asian women. Her lower half of her swimsuit stretched out against her growing lower half as it became a proper bikini bottom. Similarly, her upper half was now a bikini top that was highlighting the curves and cleavage of her breasts quite nicely. Alicia was noticeably more endowed than some Asian women, being a small C-cup at most. Her face had becoming very beautiful as red gloss appeared on her full lips. Long black hair framed her face, falling down until it hung under her breasts.<br />
<br />
By this point, Tony and Alicia were paying less attention to the sand castle than they were to each other. Alicia&#39;s eyes constantly went up and down Tony&#39;s rippling muscles and Tony had a hard time keeping his gaze away from Alicia&#39;s cleavage. Eventually, Alicia turned to Alan. He was no longer her older brother by 3 years but by 3 minutes. &quot;Alan,&quot; she said in a velvety voice, &quot;Me and Tony are going to go for a walk along the beach.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alan rolled his eyes before adjusting his glasses. &quot;You&#39;re about as subtle as a tidal wave,&quot; he said dryly.<br />
<br />
&quot;You need to loosen up,&quot; said Tony as he stood up, brushing sand off his trunks, &quot;You should spend more time on the beach looking for a girlfriend than building castles.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There&#39;s an art to this,&quot; said Alan defensively, &quot;Lacy, don&#39;t do anything that&#39;ll give Mom a fit.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re not kids anymore,&quot; said Alicia, &quot;We&#39;re 18 and we can do what we want.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And a romantic stroll along the beach sounds great,&quot; said Tony as he helped her up. Soon, the two of them were walking off and holding hands as they continued their path to 24.<br />
<br />
Alan returned his focus to the sand castle, muttering about hormones. Though the beach did have a few cute girls. Maybe after he was finished, he could talk to some.<br />
<br />
&quot;Interesting reaction there,&quot; said Katie, having watched the whole thing. &quot;Yo, Clawdia! I got you a spare!&quot;<br />
<br />
Clawdia then made her way to Alan as Kate and Bobby discussed their next scheme.</p>
