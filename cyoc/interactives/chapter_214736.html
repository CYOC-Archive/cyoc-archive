<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The nightmare that was being worn by Todd was coming to an end. Chad wasn&#39;t sure how he managed to keep it together. Todd must&#39;ve blown a dozen loads into Chad - well, tried to. He was a horny 18 year old, but after 2.5-3 loads his balls were dry. So Chad actually swallowed about 5 full loads, maybe 7. Todd had said cum was like tequila for wereSpeedos. Chad was a frigging wereSpeedo now. As long as a man was inside him, he would remain a Speedo.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, Todd, time to take off Chad,&quot; said Bruno.<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh? Who?&quot; Todd said playing dumb.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ha, ha. Very funny. You&#39;ve had him on 24 hours. And Chad is a great wingman,&quot; Bruno said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, Chad&#39;s a chick magnet, and you&#39;re gay, so how can he be your wingman?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Todd, Chad&#39;s such a stud, he attracts girls and guys. Being straight, he only goes after the girls, and I swoop in and pickup 1-2 horny guys for fun times. Here with all these drunk college kids, I might score more.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, well you&#39;ll have to wait one more day, because it&#39;s my turn to wear Chad,&quot; said Rick, as he reached in to untie Chad&#39;s drawstring which Todd had tied around his cock and balls like a cock ring.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, Rick!&quot; Todd protested.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, Todd, isn&#39;t this less painful that if I pulled Chad off you with him tied to your balls?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, you tied Chad to your nuts? I should done that. Maybe on the ride home,&quot; Bruno said.<br />
<br />
Chad was furious. He thought he was going to be human now. Instead as Todd stepped out of one leg hole, Rick stepped into it. Chad stared up at Rick&#39;s boner. The dude was rock hard.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now, if you boys don&#39;t mind. Breakfast is the most important meal of the day. Hungry, Chad?&quot; Rick asked as he flopped down on a bed, and jerked off in front of Bruno and Todd.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aaaah! Hey, you guys wanna blow your loads on Speedo boy, he says that he&#39;s starving for cum,&quot; said Rick still tenting the Speedofied quarterback. <br />
<br />
&quot;You just blew your load, why are you still hard?&quot; Bruno asked as he tugged on his cock through his Speedo.<br />
<br />
Todd was still naked, but he was having a tougher time getting it up than the other two. He blushed, and muttered, &quot;I just fed him fifteen minutes ago.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Combination of Cialis, Viagra, and raw oysters for breakfast, lunch and dinner,&quot; smirked Rick.<br />
<br />
Chad was shrieking at Rick to stop, as Bruno splattered his load all over Rick&#39;s crotch. It took Todd nearly five minutes to add his load, by which time Rick had recovered to pump a other load into Chad.<br />
<br />
&quot;But we&#39;re buzzed, I mean buds,&quot; thought Chad in a slurred voice. <br />
<br />
Chugging 4 tequilas after a night of drinking does have an affect on anyone.  Rick happily revealed that he planned to drown Chad in cum for the next 24 hours. This was just the beginning. He was signed up to participate in a cum wrestling match later. About a thousand guts jerk off into a kiddie pool, then two guys wrestle in the cum. Rick wondered if Chad could drain the pool.<br />
<br />
&quot;Buh, we&#39;re buds?&quot; Chad whined.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, Chad, you&#39;re my best bud, but by the end of your turn as my Speedo, you&#39;ll be Best Bud with Benefits,&quot; Rick said patting his now bone dry tented Speedo.<br />
<br />
&quot;Man, Rick, even for you that&#39;s low,&quot; said Todd enviously shaking his head.<br />
<br />
Chad passed out or blacked out during the cum wrestling match.  He was just dimly regaining consciousness, when he heard Bruno say, &quot;Time&#39;s up, Rick, time to take Chad off.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, you done your worst,&quot; snickered Todd.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I guess Chad gets to be a man again,&quot; sighed Rick sticking his thumbs in his waistband. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, wait up. Don&#39;t I get a turn wearing Chad?&quot; asked Monroe.<br />
<br />
The thought of being stretched over the 350 lb lineman&#39;s ass terrified Chad.<br />
<br />
Rick grinned.<br />
<br />
Bruno asked, &quot;How did you know Chad is a Speedo?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, for starters we&#39;ve shared a car and hotel room for the last 3 days, and I&#39;m not an idiot. We went to pick up Chad, and I asked so where is he going to sit, and you two snickered. I saw Bruno was commando when he got out of the car, and wearing a Speedo when you came back apparently without Chad. You each had a turn wearing Chad, now it&#39;s my turn.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, big guy, I&#39;m not sure Chad will fit. He was tight on me,&quot; Bruno said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I think Monroe will help stretch Chad&#39;s limits, don&#39;t you?&quot; Rick said lowering the Speedo to his ankles.<br />
<br />
Rick added mentally to Chad, &quot;aw, Chad, you&#39;re still such a tight ass, Monroe is bound to loosen you up.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Gawd, no, Rick. You cannot have Monroe wear me, I&#39;m too small, and the dude reeks. When was the last time he showered?&quot;<br />
<br />
Rick paused as he lifted his right foot out of Chad, and asked, &quot;Hey, Monroe, Chad wants to know when was the last time you showered?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh? Oh, the Saturday before we left, I think, probably,&quot; Monroe answered then after a moment&#39;s thought as he put his left foot in Chad&#39;s right leg opening, he added defensively,  &quot;I&#39;ll shower next Saturday.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rick wondered whether by next Saturday,  if Monroe meant in a couple days or the following Saturday? He said, &quot;Monroe, that&#39;s the right leg hole, you put your right foot on, not the left.&quot;<br />
<br />
Monroe shook his head, and said, &quot;The pouch is Chad&#39;s face, and the seat is his ass, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, so?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So I know what I&#39;m doing. My dick goes in his ass,&quot; Monroe said. He pushed Rick&#39;s left foot out of the left leg hole, put his right foot in, and pulled Chad up. <br />
<br />
Chad&#39;s scream was quickly muffled as Monroe&#39;s cock tented the seat of the Speedo, and the pouch disappeared between Monroe&#39;s powerful butt cheeks like the strap of a thong. Monroe massaged his cock, as Chad&#39;s unintelligible rants seemed to drive the pouch into Monroe&#39;s rosebud.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ng,mmmruhsup, mmgjtft!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think Chad likes his new home. Well, see you guys on Saturday,&quot; Monroe said as he staggered toward the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Saturday? Uh, we each wore him only 24 hours?&quot; Todd protested. <br />
<br />
&quot;So. I&#39;ll take Chad off as soon as he clearly asks me to or Saturday,  if he doesn&#39;t.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rick laughed, &quot;He can&#39;t speak clearly with his head up your ass, can he?&quot;<br />
<br />
Monroe grinned, &quot;you got it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, but what makes you think he won&#39;t ask you to take him off, when you lower him to go number 2?&quot; Bruno asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;You guys said he is super absorbent,  so I&#39;m going to find out just how absorbent he really is,&quot; smirked Monroe.<br />
<br />
Chad was horrified.  He tried to think at Monroe that they were teammates, buds, friends. But he could only managed a series of grunts, which had Monroe leaking precum and ass juices into his Speedo. <br />
<br />
Chad could see in Monroe&#39;s mind that Chad the wereSpeedo was only an object to him. He had ceased to be team captain and quarterback stud, and would forever now be Monroe&#39;s go-to thong.<br />
<br />
As Chad began to sob, Monroe&#39;s joy and smile grew.</p>
