<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">One look at the wife as she was face down in the salad bowl and eating it like there was not going to be a tomorrow. Her dress was all distorted as even her arms had long hairs draping down making her look shaggy. A quick look up and a gruff sound she made as if warning me not to join into her feasting.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dear!&quot; I said but as the word was said it trailed off into a funny sound. I tried it another time longing to apologize for what she was becoming but found then my own voice was now a match to hers.<br />
<br />
She, her face was all changed her human face which was so beautiful was now more like some farm animal, a sheep! I stood there dumbfounded unable to speak as my loving wife was before changing into a Ewe. Her feasting soon done she leeped from her chair by the table and stood on all fours looking up at me. Her sweet and soft loving voice was now a sharp harsh tone as the wife bleated her thoughts at me still knowing anger for she realized what she was.<br />
<br />
I feeling odd but wishing to be most sorry for what had happened coruched down expecting to cup her fuzzy chin and try to explain. <br />
<br />
Instead as I courched down my own leg joints snapped. They locked me into a position where walking on all fours was now a must do and not a might to do. The feelings rushed through me as my head felt a searing pain in the forehead. My body felt like ants were crawling just everywhere on my body. The strangest of sensation was I got erect from this whole situation and being so made me get a longing to mount my dear wife.<br />
<br />
A few minutes passed and the wife had shaken off her clothing, not that any of them fit her sheepish form. Walking about she was acting funny almost like in her thoughts she was accepting the form as something better than to be human.<br />
<br />
I continued to feel the wrenching of my human body down to that of an animal form. The pain in my head lessened but with it I gained a dire increase in weight up there. Two large and thick horns sprouted out my head growing and wrapping behind my ears and the showing the points forward to just each a side my eyes.<br />
<br />
Arms became as legs and fingers as then were cloven hooves. My legs which hunched down were set in a crouching position, while feet having changed took on the true length of my hind stance. I walked slowly feeling the smooth action of joints and muscle making me now feel a strange sensation of delight.<br />
<br />
A passing gaze to the mason jar still on the counter, it being still half full had me to wonder if the entire jar was used and at full strength, what would someone become, and for how long?<br />
<br />
Then it struck me, I realized like my wife had that I was then a male Ram and as odd as it felt to me I found myself liking the fact.<br />
<br />
The wife a now mature and large ewe came over to me sniffing of me like a dog might. I got a little defensive to her and with head own butted her away like the common action of the beast and animal I had become.<br />
<br />
She moved to one side the room and stood there Baaing me. I suddenly felt my wits under attack as if this animal's instincts were beginning to effect or even take over my will and movements. Shaking my head violently did nothing but I tried to keep thinking as myself and not to submit.   <br />
<br />
It was when I felt a funny sensation on my belly that the wrangling to save my mental self from annihilation ceeased and with this feeling I did at last submit.<br />
<br />
It was one large and long fated erection of the Ram I had become. It made me act like some animal wishing to dominate over the female before me. I stepped her way as she sniffed my rank set and then moved toward me wanting it as much too.<br />
<br />
Sniffing each the other we exchanged mental notes of patterns which in our changed minds read as names to humans. We each knew the other well and this made for the desires to build into a fevered pitch.<br />
<br />
I bounded aboard her shaggy back as my rump began to thrust about searching for that one warm and moist mark which would be the ultimate sensation. She wiggled about and did not make it easy for me as I was more than new at doing this form that odd position.<br />
<br />
Huffing and making grunting sounds I finally hit the mark and as my title suggests, I rammed my cock home. Her body jolted forward and then vaginal muscles clamped down like a vise. I felt the rankest of desires coming into my thoughts. Thrusting maddly I was going into a fit of such passion that the feelings of it all did not matter and there was just this raw drive to procreate.<br />
<br />
Tenderness of those moments together meant nothing to me then. I was and did as the bestial drives demanded and nothing more. I was doing what some inner need and drive told me was right, to increase our species and the thought of love was not in our hearts.<br />
<br />
The wife screamed her realization of my semen rushing into her body. I was indeed hot as I too felt the sensation of my own heat compared to her's. We remained there stuck, I on and over her as she standing and feeling me inside her we had a fond rememberance of doing this and waiting for the sensualness to die away, but it wasn't!<br />
<br />
Like a rerun of it all I began again to hump her and did so for hours upon hours the whole night thru. It was with the coming light of day that the rays of golden sunshine bursting through the east side picture window placed over us a glow and warm feeling.<br />
<br />
Suddenly as if I was blinded by the bright light my body felt the warmth of the morning's summer sun. It felt good, relaxing me and I drifted off into a dull stooper my erect cock still rammed into the Ewe and wife.<br />
<br />
Slowly I became alert and felt my penis still inside the wife and knowing once again the thoughts of love and passion for one I married.<br />
<br />
I was human again, the shaggy hairs gone, my arms as arms, hands being hands, and legs being legs, with real human feet.<br />
<br />
The wife too was her naked self and layed there seemingly asleep and at peace. She was as much human except for her head which was still as that of a Ewe. I waited and watched for her lovely face to become out of that beastly animal face, but it was as if the change had stopped, and she still wore the head of a ewe.<br />
<br />
Pulling my penis out of her I went straight for the mason jar in hope to read the label of call the shop for an anitdote.<br />
<br />
Holding the jar up I eyed the lettering but it just did not make any sense to me. I wondered if it was written in chinese but something told me I was looking a normal english type printing.<br />
<br />
Turning to the phone I was ready to call the shop but knew not the number, to this I let out a sigh of disgust. It came out not as a passing of air like sigh as with one who is human, but I made that wretchid sound of a bleating Ram.<br />
<br />
Quickly I ran for the bathroom and the mirror as hands felt of a hairy face. Bursting into the room I flicked on the light to see before me a naked man but wearing the head and neck of a black shaggy haired Ram and those massive curling horns. I stood there trying not to swear at myself, I'd cursed me and not the relative i'd wished to put in such a fool situation.<br />
<br />
Standing there I could think as myself but not speak, read, or even when I tried the act of counting, numbers, and such learned schooling was beyond my ability. Thinking words was all I could do and then came a thought.<br />
<br />
Heading back to the other room I picked up the mason jar and looked at it with a wondering thought. If doomed and damned I be to have a head of a Ram and not speak, of communicate with those who could change me back, would it be better to be then a Ram and remain as such totally?</p>
