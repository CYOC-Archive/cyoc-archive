<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“We just sucked each other off, and <i>this</i> is where you draw the line?” Milo sighed as they walked out of the dorm building side-by-side. As usual, he carried his camera with him in case he spotted anything of interest, eager to put some of the skills he’d been learning in Prof. Quillson’s classes into practice. <br />
<br />
“Yeah, but nobody else knows about that,” Dare replied, stuffing his hands into his pockets. “If you want to head on over to the Great Lawn and fuck like we’re in heat just so <i>everyone</i> knows about it, be my guest.” <br />
<br />
“I’m not asking you to fuck me in public. I’m asking you to hold my hand when we’re out together.” <br />
<br />
“Not happening, pig. Give me a week to think about it,” Dare replied quietly, his ears twitching frantically atop his head. “You’re probably just afraid I’m going to run away again if you don’t hold onto me, so-“ <br />
<br />
“Dare, you’re doing it again…” Milo sighed, rolling his eyes. The second they stepped out into public, Dare stopped being the (relatively) sweet person he was in private and returned to his usual neurotic self. <i>We’ll have to work on that, but at least he’s not running for it</i>, Milo thought, knowing that just because Dare was making an effort to improve his attitude didn’t mean things were perfect between them yet. <br />
<br />
“I’m sorry, Milo…” Dare said, looking genuinely embarrassed at how he was behaving. “It’s just… I’ve gotten burned before with the whole public affection thing. It’s not you, really. I trust you, it’s just-“ <br />
<br />
“I understand, Dare. I don’t know how I understand, since you never tell me anything, but I understand…” Milo replied with a big grin that made Dare’s heart melt. “Just promise me that you’ll at least try to get better. You’re a sweet guy, and there’s no shame in letting other people know that form time to time.” <br />
<br />
“…A sweet guy? I can’t believe you’d say something so horrible about me, pig,” Dare replied, flashing a cheeky smirk. Milo quickly raised his camera and captured that expression, which so perfectly captured who Dare was that Milo considered having it framed. <br />
<br />
“So, what do you wanna do? Is this a date? I’ve never really gone on one of those before,” Milo admitted with a shy laugh. <br />
<br />
“Guess I haven’t either,” Dare replied with a chuckle of his own. “Umm… We could check out the town, see what there is to do. There’s an ice cream shop that I went to with Curt. They’ve got great strawberry milkshakes…” <br />
<br />
“You got strawberry milkshakes with Curtis?” Milo sighed with mock exasperation. “That’s practically cheating on me! This is never going to work between us, is it?” <br />
<br />
“You’re the one that moved out first! And who said we’re dating anyway? This is just a sex thing, don’t get the wrong idea.” <br />
<br />
The two of them continued to argue and joke as they walked around campus, making their way toward Mane Street as they talked. As they passed by the coed sophomore dorm, Dare caught a flash of brown fur and turned to see a pair of men disappear out of sight behind the building. A bear and a squirrel, it looked like, and something about the bear made the fur on Dare’s back stand up. <br />
<br />
“Keith?” Dare said under his breath. He had tried to avoid thinking about that name for years, but for some reason it had come unbidden out of nowhere. Flashes of images blinked in front of his eyes; <i>messy brown hair, a big body, thick arms, and... Fur? Big, powerful paws with carefully trimmed black claws? Rounded ears?</i> <br />
<br />
Dare shook his head, trying to chase away the images. No, Keith was on the other side. The human side, back when he was still Daryl. So, why was he thinking about Keith like he was a- <br />
<br />
“Dare? You okay?” Milo asked with concern, seeing the look of shock on his friend’s face. <br />
<br />
Dare could feel his chest heaving and his heartbeat racing, and he looked at Milo with his eyes wide. He knew he must look like he’d seen a ghost, and he tried to calm himself so he didn’t make Milo worry. <br />
<br />
“F-fine. I’m just fine,” Dare gulped, making Milo roll his eyes and let out a sigh. <br />
<br />
“No, you’re not. You’re worried about something.” <br />
<br />
“T-then let me worry about it! I’m allowed to worry about things, aren’t I?” Dare shot back, his fur bristling a bit before he even realized it. He took a deep breath and felt his anxiety slowly begin to ebb. He wasn’t going to run away, not after his promise to Milo. “I-it’s nothing. I was just worried about something from class... Some homework I’ve got to finish later tonight, you know?” <br />
<br />
Milo looked unconvinced, but he let it slide since even though Dare was clearly lying at least he wasn’t running for it. “Fine. Whatever. I was just going to tell you that I got a text from Sam. He says some upperclassmen are throwing a party and invited us over. Want to give it a try?” <br />
<br />
-------------------------------- <br />
<br />
The party was being held off-campus, in a private home that some students had rented for the night from its owner in order to avoid the prying eyes of CVU’s campus security. They’d still have to keep an eye out for Claw Valley’s police, but the sheriff usually let kids be kids and only sent off his newest deputy deal with the student parties in the rare instances they got out of control. <br />
<br />
This party, however, was definitely edging closer to ‘out of control’; the booze was flowing and the music was loud, and once they arrived Milo even spotted Shro lurking around and making sure there was enough ‘nip to go around. <br />
<br />
“You’re sure about this, pig? You never struck me as the partying type,” Dare said, looking around at the people dancing and drinking around them. <br />
<br />
“...I’m wasn&#39;t. But, I can give it a try. I mean, I didn’t know how to change a tire a week ago, so who knows what else I can handle now that things have changed a bit, right?” <br />
<br />
“...I’m still not gonna hold your hand, you know that right?” Dare replied, knowing that Milo was trying to get him to step out of his comfort zone a bit. <br />
<br />
“We’ll see. Let’s get a couple drinks and see where that leads us,” Milo laughed, flashing his tusks and pulling Dare over to the open bar that had been set up in the kitchen. <br />
<br />
--------------------------------------- <br />
<br />
An hour later, the party was still going strong. In fact, it was going too strong, and was definitely in danger of getting shut down the longer it went on. Dare had taken the plunge and gotten a quick hit of ‘nip, while Milo had already downed a few drinks and was starting to get quite giddy. <br />
<br />
“Come on, Dare. I love this song... Let’s dance!” Milo laughed, grabbing Dare’s paw and dragging him closer to the sound system, making Dare blush and look around to make sure nobody was staring at him. <br />
<br />
“Pig, you’re drunk... You’re gonna make a fool of yourself,” Dare mumbled. <i>No, I’m gonna make a fool of myself</i>, he corrected himself mentally, even as Milo began to awkwardly move around to the beat of the music. <br />
<br />
“Dare, I haven’t had a chance to have fun since we’ve gotten here,” Milo replied, pulling Dare in closer and resting his hooved hand at the base of Dare’s back. “First I’ve been dealing with all these changes, then my dad sends me off to work at that garage... and all week I’ve had to be your therapist. Can I just let loose and have some fun? Can <i>you</i> try to have some fun?” <br />
<br />
Dare blushed feeling Milo’s hand drifting closer and closer to his ass, then he reached out and put his own paw against the boar’s back. The music changed to a slower song, giving them both a chance to slowly sway to the beat and enjoy one another’s company for a moment. <br />
<br />
“I do have fun when I’m with you, Milo... And the others, too,” Dare admitted, his thoughts getting muddled by all the alcohol and ‘nip in his system. “This whole valley is a fun place, and I don’t know if I’ve ever been happier than this past week. I just... I don’t trust it. It all seems too good to be true. I’ve got a great family now... A mom that I can talk to about anything, siblings that look up to me... And I feel like a fucking asshole for doubting them, but I just can’t stop myself, and-” <br />
<br />
“Shh. Just stop worrying so much, Dare,” Milo said quietly. “This is a party, so forget all that stuff and just enjoy yourself.” <br />
<br />
Dare felt Milo’s hand slip down the back of his pants and gently cup his ass, while his other hand snuck under Dare’s shirt and made its way toward Dare’s sensitive nipples. <br />
<br />
“Milo, you can’t... w-we&#39;re in public,” Dare whispered, feeling his cock getting rock-hard in anticipation. He let out an erotic moan and pressed the tented front of his jeans against Milo’s muscular leg, slowly humping back and forth to the beat of the music. Milo quietly laughed and pulled Dare into a kiss, slipping his tongue into Dare’s mouth while giving Dare’s pierced nipple a gentle flick. Dare could feel Milo’s tusks against his cheek as they passionately made out, and his moaning grew louder and louder as Milo began to pinch and twist at Dare’s perky nipples. <br />
<br />
“Wanna know a secret?” Milo whispered as their lips parted. “I’ve wanted to do this ever since I saw you sleeping naked the first night we met. I wanted to look into those big green eyes of yours and make you <i>cum</i>.” <br />
<br />
With that, Dare let out a shuddering gasp and blew his load right there in the middle of the party, feeling his boxers getting wet and sticking to the fur on his leg. He could feel an odd tingle spreading across his crotch, and though he didn’t realize it his skin was pulling up around his cock to form a black-furred sheath, while the tip of his cock slimmed down to a gentle point and began to redden slightly. He panted and tried to regain his composure, looking all around at the others at the party and hoping that nobody noticed that they had been doing. <br />
<br />
“No, you didn’t,” Dare replied, looking right into Milo’s eyes and giving his trademark Dare smirk. “You thought I was an asshole and didn’t want anything to do with me.” <br />
<br />
“Oh, I still think you’re an asshole,” Milo admitted, rubbing his snout against Dare’s cheek sensually. “But, you’re the cutest, funniest, sweetest asshole in this whole school. If you try to run again, I’m not gonna let you get away.” <br />
<br />
“...You’re a real creep, pig. And I know better than to listen to drunks.” <br />
<br />
“Love ‘ya too, Dare.”</p>
