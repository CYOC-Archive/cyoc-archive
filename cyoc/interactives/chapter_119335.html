<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Your body was changing rapidly by the second, and you could notice black scales spreading up your arms, and around your legs. All of a sudden your insides felt like they were on fire and you immediately collapsed to the ground crying out in pain. &quot;OH GOD! Make it stop!&quot; You yelled closing your eyes and banging your head on the ground panicking.<br />
<br />
With your eyes still shut you suddenly got a massive migraine and you held onto your head with your hands, and covered your eyes. Your hands for some reason felt sharp like knives and left marks on your face as your body continued changing. You could feel new appendages suddenly growing in on your body, and your legs and feet were changing too. You opened your eyes and saw that everything was blurred, and a figure within that blurry sight knocked you unconscious.<br />
<br />
When you woke up, you were laying on the floor of the witch&#39;s hut, and you looked up to see the witch. &quot;Uugh, what...happened?&quot; You asked and noticed that your voice was astonishingly deeper.<br />
<br />
&quot;I transformed you into some sort of anthropomorphic dragon. You were panicking and flailing around too much, and personally I didn&#39;t want your first fiery breath to destroy my home. So naturally I had to take a few additional actions in order to keep the both of us safe.&quot; The witch said<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m a dragon?!&quot; You asked then noticed the jet black scaled muzzle obstructing your view and sat up to look at the rest of your body. You were completely covered in black scales from head to foot, and your hands and feet had become 4 digits, and claws. Your hands retained their thumbs, but your feet were completely digitigrade. You saw a tail then hanging between your legs and it had a barbed spike on the end of it. You then looked behind you and saw two large wings that stretched about twice the size of your body, and you were shocked as you could open and close them with ease. You then looked down and saw two black reptilian penises sticking out of a sheath, and both were about 10 inches long. A few seconds after seeing them, your penises retreated into the sheath, and you saw that your entire body had become muscular and much larger.<br />
<br />
You then stood up slowly to get used to your legs and hit your head off of the ceiling and it made a large thud noise. &quot;Ow!&quot; You growled and crouched down.<br />
<br />
&quot;Careful, there&#39;s a lot of delicate ingredients in this room and some can be quite explosive. Go outside and wait for me while I finish up here, and make sure that nobody disturbs me.&quot; The witch ordered <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, okay then.&quot; You said and felt a compulsion to obey her.<br />
<br />
You got onto all fours and made your way outside as to not bump your head on anything and got outside the hut and into the water, and you shuddered at the coldness of it. Surprisingly however the water around the hut now only made it past your ankles, and you looked around at everything else, and realized that you had to be at least 8 feet tall. You looked down at your body once more and saw your muscles and smiled as feelings of pride over them compelled you to flex them. You stopped after a few minutes and sighed, seeing a small flame exhale from your mouth as you did.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow, this seems....interesting, and amazing. I wonder what I should do with this much power.&quot; You thought to yourself and then saw the witch exit her hut and levitate herself to see you eye to eye. <br />
<br />
&quot;I see you&#39;ve begun to experience some pride correct? Hmph, figures enough since you are a dragon. But enough about that, shall I explain to you why you should accept me as your master?&quot; The witch asked<br />
<br />
&quot;I would appreciate that very much.&quot; You responded and walked over and sat down on the edge of the swamp.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright then, as my familiar you need to obey my every order, and if not your body is compelled to obey it for me. You may have already felt a few compulsive suggestions by your body, and if you do not obey me then your will to do anything other than obey me will simply dissolve and become nonexistent.&quot; The witch said<br />
<br />
&quot;So I lose my free will, that&#39;s actually a pretty good reason all things considered.&quot; You commented out loud.<br />
<br />
&quot;I see your mindset is like mine in that regard, good. Now do you remember earlier about what I said about your name?&quot; The witch asked<br />
<br />
&quot;That you would give me a new name, and I need one considering that for some reason I can&#39;t seem to recall a few more of my memories. Tell me, were you planning on giving me amnesia? Or did you just want to get rid of the unnecessary memories from my mind?&quot; You asked<br />
<br />
&quot;Either or, but what use would an amnesiac be to me if he would have forgotten his education? Besides aren&#39;t you more interested in some of the perks to being a dragon familiar?&quot; The witch asked<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course, what kind of question is that?&quot; You asked<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, before I begin your new name is Nightmare, and I believe you can sense why from what you can see so far. As for my name, you don&#39;t need to know that, just adress me always as your mistress, understand?&quot; The witch asked<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, my mistress.&quot; You said then bowed to her politely <br />
<br />
&quot;My my, your manners as a familiar are certainly improving swiftly. Alright then, as a dragon you are ageless, and can live for eternity. However, most die because of their arrogance and recklessness, but since you are serving me, I will make sure that is watched for you. In addition to that your body is like a fortress and many dragons are known for their destruction, and it seems your physical prowess reflects that in you.&quot; The witch said<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks for the compliment, but doesn&#39;t that say more about you than me? Not to be rude or anything that is.&quot; You said<br />
<br />
&quot;True, but those scars definitely make you at least look like you have some experience, and those were your doing.&quot; The witch said<br />
<br />
&quot;Scars?&quot; You asked and the witch pointed to the swamp water&#39;s surface. You looked down and saw that both of your eyes had four deep claw marks going across them and your eyelids too, and they we&#39;re fairly noticeable now. You also saw your reflection for the first time and saw two black horns that curves upwards on the back of your head, and saw that your eyes had turned crimson red. Of course since you were a dragon, you were bald, but that didn&#39;t bother you.<br />
<br />
&quot;I see, but mistress if I may change the topic, what if there is a day that we don&#39;t have much to do? I don&#39;t like to be bored, if you know what I mean by that.&quot; You said yawning<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh I have a few spells that can help you with that, but if you value your dignity then you would wish otherwise. But I do admit, the changes do seem wonderful, and I wouldn&#39;t mind making a few &quot;fun&quot; alterations to you, or a future victim.&quot; The witch said smiling<br />
<br />
&quot;I will do as you wish, and whatever you change about me I will adapt to. I admit as well, I am a bit curious about what changes you wish you enact on me.&quot; You said<br />
<br />
&quot;I simply turn you female, give you all of the curves, features and perfect them for your maximum pleasure. Maybe I can even throw in a pregnancy spell in so that we can start a hoard if you wish, female dragons do find eggs quite lustful, and nostalgic to lay.&quot; The witch said<br />
<br />
&quot;Nostalgic huh...&quot; you said out loud and began thinking <br />
<br />
&quot;I can make a few changes to your body immediately if you&#39;d like. Make you stronger, more ferocious, or maybe female so I can have someone nearby who has something to talk about.&quot; The witch said<br />
<br />
&quot;Indeed...mistress, if I may ask can you....?&quot; You began</p>
