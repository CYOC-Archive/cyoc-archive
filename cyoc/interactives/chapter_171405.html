<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">During practice, Marty was getting compliments from everyone. His teammates were impressed with his better performance. The cheerleaders who were practicing there can&#39;t take their eyes off him and his coach was smiling as he thought that Marty wasn&#39;t as useless as he used to think.<br />
<br />
Marty&#39;s bad bay was turning into a good one. After practice, he and his teammates went to their locker rooms. They were really exhausted that day because their coach was trying to push Marty&#39;s limits to the edge. Now that everyone wasn&#39;t running nor jogging, Marty could see that he was taller than almost all his teammates. He looked like a teen among kids despite they&#39;re the same age, or at least, that&#39;s what Marty was still believing.<br />
<br />
One of his teammates said that he was very thirsty and asked for a bottle of water to everyone else. Unfortunately, none of them has water in their bottles cautthey had already drank it. Marty knew that it was his change to be friend of these guys, so he offered to go for water at the fountain. He took his teammates bottles and ran to fill them.<br />
<br />
During his way to the fountain, Marty started to feel some tingles in his body and he felt more sweaty and sticky than usual. He thought that it was just part of his growth spurt and ignored it.<br />
<br />
When he returned he noticed something weird. He wasn&#39;t the tallest kid anymore. All of his teammates had increased in height and some of them were as tall as he while some other were taller. He can&#39;t believe it, he didn&#39;t take more than a few minutes! He wanted to say something but he noticed that everyone was acting like normal, so he didn&#39;t say a word.<br />
<br />
A moment later, their coach came in to tell them a good new. They are going to participate in a small event between the three schools. So, he asked them for an extra training before they leave. He expected that the boys were tired but surprisingly they were really excited and accepted it very enthusiastically. They changed their clothes once again, despite their uniforms were sweaty and stinky.<br />
<br />
Then, their coach told them they will start with a few runs around the football field which they don&#39;t like but accepted to do it anyway. They starting running when something weird begin to tingle and warm in them.<br />
<br />
The first one was Marty, which pain in his stomach was getting so intense that he stopped for a second. Everyone else gave him a deadly stare, included the coach. So, he kept running. That social pressure was making them to bear their pain.<br />
<br />
After several minutes, the coach leaves them for a while to take a call, but they didn&#39;t stop. They started to feel warm again but ignored the feeling so that they didn’t look weak. They felt a jolt of energy surging throughout their body. It was the weirdest feeling ever but they couldn’t stop running, it was like their legs were being controlled by something else.<br />
<br />
They were confused as their legs continued to run. A few seconds later, a second growth spurt hit them. They looked down noticing their clothes looked painted on their skins now. They felt their shoes getting really tight and their sleeves almost ripping off. They wanted to look around to see if everyone else was growing as well, but none of them want to look like a perv staring another man.<br />
<br />
Just when Marty was going to say something, he listened as his shoes began to burst open. His toes were now exposed and then suddenly his feet bursted through his small shoes. Two large size 15 feet replaced his size 8 shoes. He felt the surge crawl up his legs which caused his legs to grow larger and more muscular.<br />
<br />
Then they started to run faster and Marty knew that it was because his teammates had experienced the same muscle growth. The surge of energy climbed into their torsos. Some of them noticed that their chests were shredding the front of their uniforms almost instantly.<br />
<br />
They were sweating as their bodies began to grow even more muscular and taller. Their already too small shirts fell clean off of their torsos exposing large and surprisingly hairy chests and stomachs. Their arms were so big now and their bodies looked to be that of the high school&#39;s football team.<br />
<br />
Marty can&#39;t believe it, he was running with a bunch of almost naked teenagers whose only remaining clothes were their dirty and tight jockstraps. However, they won&#39;t last very long because Marty can feel his dick beginning to throb in his tight pouch. He felt his balls drop suddenly causing his voice to deepen. His face kept his young boyish charm but resembled a much older guy’s face. His butt grew larger and buried his straps under his buttcheeks.<br />
<br />
They continued running as their thick muscles and pecs jumped in place. Their large bare feet hit the hot grass with every step. They couldn’t stop running, but they didn’t want to. To anyone else looking at them they will look like a bunch of high school seniors running just with very tiny jockstraps that didn&#39;t leave nothing to imagination. They felt so horny but they just couldn’t stop running.<br />
<br />
Just then, the coach came back. And noticed that his little players had left and a group of young men were taking their place. He thought that it was a joke, so he stopped them and they finally stopped running. The coach asked for the kids but they claimed that they&#39;re the kids he was looking for. At first, he didn&#39;t believe it but after looking some resemblances between these hunky guys and his boys, he started to examine his once small team’s bodies.<br />
<br />
“If you really are who you say you are. You grew a lot! Muscles like those take years of working out! And those feet and the body hair! Wow!! It&#39;s really impressive!!” He laughed as he patted some of his now large players’ sweaty backs. “You keep working hard, I’m going to make another call.” Marty watched as the coach walked away and he wondered if he truly believed them or not.</p>
