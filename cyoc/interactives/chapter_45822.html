<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">John quickly put his hands over Brian's, gently keeping him from lifting up the T-shirt. Well, he thought, I decided I wouldn't tell him until I absolutely had to. Apparently that came sooner than I expected.<br />
<br />
&quot;Listen, Brian,&quot; he began. &quot;I like you. I mean, a lot. I think I may be in love with you. But there's something I need to tell you. I, uh, I'm not quite like other guys. I've been going through some changes recently and they might just be temporary but, um...&quot;<br />
<br />
Brian was looking worried now. This was not going well. He tried another approach, starting with something that might go over better.<br />
<br />
&quot;Like my cock, for example. That's pretty big, right?&quot; Brian nodded and flashed him a grin. &quot;Well, it's still getting bigger. It'll be a few inches longer soon. And my balls too -- they're kind of the same. I'm hoping you'll have chance to, you know, inspect them later. I'm hoping you'll like them.&quot;<br />
<br />
As he spoke, John felt a warm itching sensation flow over him, starting from his feet and spreading upwards. His pants were getting tight -- and his shoes were worse, pinching down. He had to hurry this up.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's not just that, though. It's all of me. It starts and I just... get bigger, all over. Really buff, really butch.&quot; He paused and grinned nervously, hoping to take the edge off what was coming next. Then it occurred to him that he could be getting tusks by now, and grinning might not have the desired effect. &quot;More than butch. Not quite normal any more. Not quite... human. But it's still me, just the same, and it wears off. So don't be afraid. Don't be worried.&quot;<br />
<br />
I sound crazy, he thought. Brian looked confused and, yes, afraid.<br />
<br />
&quot;John, are you all right? Am I going too quickly? Or are you just not... I thought... and you seemed interested, but if that's not what you're looking for...&quot;<br />
<br />
The poor guy was practically crying. What a mess, thought John. He must think this is the weakest let-down ever. He released his grip and and reached up to brush a tear from Brian's cheek. They had claws now and he had to be careful not to scratch.<br />
<br />
&quot;Look, go ahead and lift my shirt up, OK? Just be kind, and remember that I love you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Brian pulled it up a little, then hesitated. John nodded reassuringly and lifted his arms. That seemed to be enough; Brian peeled it up gradually. The T-shirt had started off baggy but was now skin-tight. The outline of his cock must have been obvious, but he heard Brian gasp anyway when he finally raised the shirt up past his nipples and it slipped free, falling forwards for a moment before thumping into Brian's bare chest and coming to a stop. Or perhaps, thought John, it was the colour that had made him gasp. He couldn't see -- the T-shirt was in the way -- but it had to be that deep green by now.<br />
<br />
Brian started peeling the shirt upwards again, but it got stuck on John's head and biceps. After an awkward few seconds of tugging, John simply grabbed it with his clawed hands and tore it in two. As it drifted to the ground, John found himself facing Brian, both of them panting. They broke into grins together. John could feel his being pushed apart by his tusks, but somehow it didn't matter. He put his large hands on Brian's shoulders and gripped them tightly.<br />
<br />
He'd got taller, he noticed; Brian's eyes had been a little higher than his before, but now he was looking down a couple of inches. He glanced further down. His penis was, yes, dark green, contrasting sharply with Brian's pale chest where it rested. The skin of his own chest -- and arms -- had darkened to orcish grey-green.<br />
<br />
Ah, said his lower half. All done with the big emotional moment, are we? Because there's quite a lot of pain down here you were ignoring and should be paying attention to.<br />
<br />
Brian was saying something, but it was drowned out by the sudden agony of his belt biting into his waist and cock. It was way too tight to undo: he just grabbed at it on either side of the buckle and pulled as hard as he could, the massive muscles in his arms straining. The leather didn't break, but after a few awful seconds the metal joint gave out and the buckle flew apart, a few pieces sailing across the room. He reached to undo his fly but without the belt it simply tore apart before he could get to it. His jeans were tight -- too tight to pull down -- but their seams just burst apart from top to bottom as he started to bend down. His tough claws had already ripped through the front of his sneakers, he saw, and several inches of his feet had forced their way out through the holes. The back and sides of of the shoes were still holding, but they were uncomfortably cramped. He simply lifted a foot up and tore the sole off from the front, shook off the ruined sock and what remained of the shoe, then did the same with the other foot.<br />
<br />
&quot;I said,&quot; repeated Brian, &quot;I see what you mean about butch.&quot; He stared for a moment. &quot;Is it finished?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not quite, maybe,&quot; said John, his voice now deep with a hint of growl. He settled himself, relaxed, closed his eyes, focused on the sensations. He could feel the muscles in his upper body humming, slowly growing tighter. His chest was still itching -- he opened his eyes and saw black hairs crawling out. And there was a dull ache in his bones, running through his arms, legs, and spine. &quot;I'm still growing,&quot; he muttered. It was slow, but standing next to Brian and looking down at him it was noticeable. Brian simply stared at him in wonder, looking from his chest to his face to his legs to his arms to his balls to his cock. He crept up another few inches in height. His cock had reached its full size a while back and was actually a little smaller relative to the rest of him now. Nonetheless, as he grew taller its head nudged slowly up Brian's chest, finally coming to a stop against his collar bone. Brian made no move to push it away, instead resting one hand lightly on it near the base.<br />
<br />
&quot;There, that'sh it,&quot; said John. Speaking around the tusks took a little getting used to. &quot;Sho -- I mean, so, um, what do you think?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think every home should have one.&quot; He paused. &quot;I think it's amazing and freaky and sexy and maybe just a little scary. I think it's going to take a lot of getting used to, but I think I'd like to get used to it. Does it hurt?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Only when I'm stupid enough not to take off my clothes first in a vain attempt not to scare potential boyfriends.&quot;<br />
<br />
Brian hugged him tightly. John hugged him back, taking care not to squeeze too hard. After spending days fretting about what was happening to him and trying to hide it, it felt wonderful and exhilarating to be with someone who not only liked him but had accepted his transformation -- maybe even appreciated it. Physically too, the embrace was bliss. His cock felt great sandwiched between their chests, pressing against the warm flesh.</p>
