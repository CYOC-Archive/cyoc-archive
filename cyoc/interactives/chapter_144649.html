<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">(I took the liberty to change the age. 13 seems a little creepy. Let’s try college aged.)<br />
<br />
Jake stood nervously near the doorway of his classroom. The ring was nestled nicely onto his finger as he prepared to absorb Ty’s muscles. Ty was the most handsome guy on campus. He could strut around with the utmost confidence and got all of the girls. Even some guys tried to get him, but Ty wasn’t interested. <br />
<br />
Soon, Ty walked through the door. Jake quickly reached out and touched Ty with his ring finger. He focused intensely on the muscles. All of the muscles around his entire body. <br />
<br />
Jake felt powerful. He grow right where he stood, and so did everything else. His body ballooned outward stretching his clothes. Jake suddenly went stiff. He could barely move his body based on the sheer amount of muscle mass he had just obtained. He had forgotten, unfortunately, to take some height or bone structure. <br />
<br />
As he waddled around, he looked at Ty. Replacing the strong muscular man was literally skin and bones. A man sat in a wheelchair with much of his skin wrapped around his bones. A breathalyzer was attached to his mouth and he wasn’t exactly moving. Girls still swarmed around him to his apparent charm and all he did was move his eyes around. <br />
<br />
Ty looked horrible, but there was little Jake could do now. He need to be taller. He reached over and was sure only to take some of his height. The frail man shrunk back and Jake expanded upwards as his muscles began to spread out. He could move and flex and do all sorts of things now. But the girls (and more importantly guys) would not be deterred. Jake touched him one last time, and this time he just imagined absorbing Ty. <br />
<br />
A flood of emotions filled his head. Memories, feelings, experiences. It was all there. <br />
<br />
“Jake,” someone called out. <br />
<br />
Jake looked around. Some people were giving him lustful glances now, but no one was calling his name. The frail remains of Ty had disappeared. <br />
<br />
“Jake!” there it was again. <br />
<br />
Jake nervously sat down at his seat. It felt awkward in this big body. Luckily, his clothes had sized up. <br />
<br />
“I guess I’ll just wait after class?” the voice called out. “Something seems to be bugging you.”<br />
<br />
Jake could not even differentiate where that voice was coming from. It was almost as if it was in his head. <br />
<br />
Jake could not pay attention to the lecture. Instead he just combed through his strange new memories and attempted to make sense of them. <br />
<br />
A rather distinct one quickly appeared. It was him staring into a mirror with this gorgeous new body, naked enhanced in every way. Suddenly the face change proportions to match that of Ty. Jake almost jumped out of his seat simply from the memory of it. <br />
<br />
The head proceeded to split into two heads, although the second head was Jake’s. Ty Head seemed to say something to Jake Head and suddenly the body split into two. The two bodies were identical and slightly smaller in size, but each had one of the boys’ heads. <br />
<br />
It made sense to Jake now. He had combine everything with Ty, including themselves. They were two in one deal. The voice in his head was Ty. <br />
<br />
All of a sudden shake felt his face twitch. He lost some control over the body and all he could do was look out of his eyes. Jake still felt and could hear and sense things, but he didn’t control it. He looked at his computer screen in front of him and his face had molded into the face of Ty. The eyes weren’t staring at the computer either, they stared at the teacher. <br />
<br />
“Yes Ty,” the teacher called. “Nice of you to wake up and join us instead of just staying in Jake.”<br />
<br />
There was a bit of laughter, and Jake felt a twang of embarrassment. Jakes mouth moved without his consent as Ty answered the question. <br />
<br />
Trying to be creative, Jake willed his head to separate, which it did. Suddenly there were two heads on this body. <br />
<br />
The best part? No one batted an eye. Not even Ty. Jake and Ty had become one combined being. <br />
<br />
But Jake noticed that another student up front also seemed odd. He was writing notes with one set of hands and scratching his head with another. <br />
<br />
Jake thought back to the memory of the one guy splitting into two. He recalled a brief moment when they separated and duplicated their arms and legs before detaching. Another huge guy walked in. He suddenly grew and extra pair of arms and another head. Both heads looked strikingly different. The two quickly separated and began making out with Jake and Ty. <br />
<br />
At the memory, Jake for horny and their dick became erect. Ty shock him a glare, but Jake was loving this. <br />
<br />
Jake also noticed that the face of the professor had changed. It appeared that the world was changing. Jake has created a new norm, and wondered what else lay in this new and interesting reality.</p>
