<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Alice spent a few minutes admiring herself in the bathroom mirror. Despite having goat legs and a protruding <br />
tummy--or perhaps because of them--she felt even more delightfully childlike. Her bright blue eyes had a wild <br />
gleam in them, and she couldn't help but see her small lips curl into a tiny mischievous smile.<br />
<br />
Excited to see what else she could try on the program, she returned to the computer. At the top of the screen <br />
were a few tabs. The active tab was labeled &quot;Physical,&quot; but there were also tabs that said &quot;Mental&quot; and <br />
&quot;Awareness.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, I should set the awareness parameters before anyone comes home. Otherwise I'll have a lot of explaining <br />
to do.&quot; Alice clicked on the tab and saw among the options a box that made her the only one aware of her <br />
previous existence as a human. Hopefully, the rest of the world would treat her as if she'd always been a <br />
faun.<br />
<br />
The she clicked on the &quot;Mental&quot; tab that took her to a new menu full of mental traits. Her current attitudes, <br />
likes and dislikes were on display.<br />
<br />
She thought for a minute about leaving them alone. &quot;Well, I can always change some of these back if having my <br />
brain altered freaks me out. I just have to make sure not to go overboard with new preferences.&quot;<br />
<br />
She looked over her mental settings. Her love of the outdoors was already rather high, and appropriate for a <br />
faun. She saw a slider for music appreciation and musical talent. She brought those up a bit and in a box <br />
labeled &quot;Instruments Played&quot; she typed &quot;Flute, Recorder, Panpipes.&quot; Instantly three new sliders appeared, <br />
setting her proficiencies in those instruments. Alice kicked all three to maximum.<br />
<br />
She tweaked the settings under food preferences to make herself like more vegetables. She didn't care much for <br />
a lot of veggies currently. &quot;New body, new rules. Fauns live off forest scraps, and though I don't plan to do <br />
that myself, having a larger veggie palette ought to do me some good.&quot; She also thought that little fauns <br />
would be more indulgent, and so she increased her appetite a little and sped up her metabolism slightly to <br />
compensate.<br />
<br />
She looked over page after page of sliders, adjusting some here and there that seemed to help with her new <br />
body. She increased her sense of humor and playfulness tenfold, and decreased her tendency to become sad or <br />
nervous. She noticed her introvert/extrovert slider was middling between the two extremes, and decided to move <br />
it halfway toward extrovert. She found a slider controlling her attention span and reduced this a bit. &quot;Fauns <br />
are flighty creatures sometimes,&quot; she giggled.<br />
<br />
Also recalled that when fauns became satyrs they were debaucherous creatures.  She didn't want that, at least <br />
not totally, after all she was just a little kid.  She looked over the menu regarding her sexual habits and <br />
preferences. She snickered at seeing a slider marked &quot;Normal Arousal State.&quot; Hers was thankfully low, <br />
unsurprisingly, at about 8%. She decided to bring this up to 10%. &quot;Wonder if I'll get a kick out of that,&quot; she <br />
said. &quot;Or if it'll be too much for me to cope with.&quot; She really had no idea what kind of grade this slider was <br />
based on. She was confident any higher than 20% was more than she wanted at this point.<br />
<br />
This made her think of what to do about clothes. &quot;I can't exactly wear anything on my legs without the fur <br />
itching like crazy,&quot; she said. &quot;And satyrs don't seem to wear a lot of clothes anyway. Maybe I can...?&quot; Alice <br />
searched through the program until she found a preference for clothing and clothing types.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; she said, playing with the sliders. &quot;As far as a general interest in clothing, I should go way down.&quot; <br />
She moved the main clothes slider from its original position, close to &quot;strongly like,&quot; over toward &quot;strongly <br />
dislike,&quot; though she made sure not to go all the way, lest she develop such a mad-on for clothes that she <br />
started to burn her entire wardrobe or something. &quot;Who wants to wear dumb clothes anyway when you have <br />
beautiful fur.  However... I do want to wear some pretty things from time to time.&quot; She increased her interest <br />
in jewelry and recreational clothes such as vests and scarfs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm...that's all I can think of for now,&quot; she said to herself. &quot;I covered a lot of ground already. Time to <br />
see if this works.&quot; Alice clicked save once, and felt her head spin for a moment as new thoughts and ideas <br />
swept in, pushing some of her other thoughts to the back of her mind.<br />
<br />
&quot;Woah,&quot; she said breathlessly. She shook her head to clear it up. Her hair tossed around, tickling her newly <br />
sensitive ears and Alice felt a rush of new delightfully miscreant thoughts, thoughts about young human boys <br />
and how silly they looked after being lightly kissed on the nose. &quot;Oooh, that was cool,&quot; she said. &quot;Must be <br />
the Arousal factor kicking in.&quot;<br />
<br />
She felt much more ambitious about her changes than before.  &quot;Hmm, lets see what else I can change.&quot; <br />
<br />
She noticed that the &quot;Sexual Tendencies&quot; bar was set to heterosexual.  &quot;Hmm, fauns are known to be interested <br />
both ways...&quot;  She hesitated but decided to click it close to bisexual. Another bar appeared, &quot;Sexual <br />
awareness.&quot;  She set this very low, deciding that she wanted the average knowledge about sex of any eight year <br />
old.  &quot;Why not?  So long as I'm only just curious about things.&quot;   She then clicked save.<br />
<br />
A more palpable change filtered through her mind as even more new thoughts and understandings filled it.  <br />
Suddenly, she couldn't recall any sexual thoughts.  Instead, thoughts of sex and sexuality had changed to a <br />
hazy, murky curiosity.  She knew about the differences between boys and girls, but the most she understood <br />
about love was to kiss a boy or girl now and watch them blush.  She recalled doing so, for some reason, and <br />
feeling a flush of giddy emotion that she really enjoyed.  Smiling, she nodded to herself.  &quot;Why would I want <br />
to remember grown up stuff like that anyways?&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
She giggled slightly.  The prospect of going through her day as a faun brought a squeal of joy to her lips. <br />
&quot;Oh, I can't wait to go out and do something. But I have to make sure I'm really ready.&quot; Alice skipped to the <br />
bathroom again to take another look at herself, in case there were any more changes she wanted to do.<br />
<br />
Upon seeing herself in the mirror, she felt something was different about the way she looked, although she <br />
knew she hadn't changed physically. &quot;Why did I not notice how nice my hair looks like this?&quot; She ran a finger <br />
through her dense brown curls. An urge welled up in her to play with it a little. &quot;I know, I think I saw a <br />
picture somewhere...&quot;<br />
<br />
Alice jogged back to her room, feeling her small gut sway back and forth and her hair blow up in a large bush <br />
behind her. She pulled a book of classical art from her bookshelf and flipped through the pages to find one of <br />
her favorite paintings of a young faun. She found it quickly. It was a picture of a little female faun, naked <br />
of course, offering an apple to two cherubs in a beautiful forest setting. The faun was plump, a little <br />
thicker in the limbs than Alice, but she had the same long brown curls. In the midst of these was a braid that <br />
began halfway down, consisting of half her total locks and laying upon the strands that still hung loose. It <br />
lent an ironic sense of style to the exotic disarray of hair.<br />
<br />
Alice plopped down on her bed and began working on the braid. Because she only had to start from the halfway <br />
point, it was easy to pull the locks around to her front side and start braiding. She was so gleefully focused <br />
on her work that she didn't notice the time go by, until...</p>
