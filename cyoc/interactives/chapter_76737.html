<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was a week later when Dana finally wore a bathing suit again.<br />
<br />
The weather had been overcast or rainy the whole week, but this Saturday was beautiful, warm, and sunny just like the last one had been. She felt a slight hesitation when she started packing for the beach. The events of last Saturday were hazy in her memory, but she knew for sure that something very strange had happened.<br />
<br />
She could clearly recall tanning in the backyard as she waited for her boyfriend, Kevin, to arrive. She remembered her brother being a pest as usual, even going so far as to squirt her with his little water gun. It was after she took the gun away from him that her memories started to feel more confused. She remembered shooting him with the squirt gun and him chasing her around as they laughed and laughed. She remembered them splashing around in the kiddy pool after that, although she couldn’t understand how she possibly fit in that little pool with him. She remembered Kevin showing up and how big he looked all of a sudden. There was some talk about where Dana was, which was particularly hilarious because she was sitting in the pool right in front of him. She and Jason, her brother, had played for what felt like hours. Their mom had come home at one point and again Dana laughed when they asked her where Dana was and who she was--such silly questions. Her memories only started to be clearer hours later when Jason had gone to bed and she had started to dose off on the couch in the living room while watching cartoons. Suddenly, she felt the towel on her shoulders start to shift as her perspective seemed to rise up. Kevin had shouted for her mom and the two of them had come to stare at her. The amazed looks on their faces told her that something special had just happened, but she couldn’t tell what it was.<br />
<br />
The local news that night described a whole variety of strange events that had taken place in their town that day. Kevin and her mom had decided that what had happened to her was just another one of those strange things. When she asked them what had happened to her, they told her that she had become Jason’s age for the whole day. She could hardly believe them, but what they said did seem to fit with her memories. Still, the transformation didn’t bother her too much. In fact, it had been a really fun day for her, if not for Kevin and her mother. That night, she kissed her exhausted boyfriend goodbye and went to bed.<br />
<br />
The next day everything was normal for her again. Breakfast was normal, except that Jason wanted to play with her really badly. School was normal, although Kevin kept giving her strange looks when they were together. After several more normal days, everyone started to relax again.<br />
<br />
Then, Saturday came, and Dana knew she had to put on her swimsuit again. After seeing the sun out and feeling the warm air, there was just some inexplicable urge inside of her to put it on. She called Kevin, and he reluctantly agreed to pick her up to go to the beach.<br />
<br />
“Are you sure you want to do this?” he asked her as he drove them in his Jeep. “I mean, after what happened last time…”<br />
<br />
“What do you mean?” she said.<br />
<br />
“I mean that you turned into a preschooler the last time you wore a bathing suit.”<br />
<br />
“So you say,” she said. She had increasingly started to doubt their explanation for the events of last Saturday as the week went by. It just seemed so far fetched. And, in spite of all of the strange things that had happened in town recently, she still had a hard time believing in magic. She preferred to think that the whole event she had experienced was the result of mild sunstroke or dehydration. “Whatever it was that happened, I’m sure that it won’t happen again. Don’t worry so much.”<br />
<br />
Kevin sighed. “Okay then.” He was clearly tired of trying to convince her that she had been magically transformed. Still, he was happy to be with her. She was a knockout after all. He took a few peeks at her outfit. She wore flip flops, short jean shorts, and a tight white tank top that showed off a lot of cleavage.<br />
<br />
“Eyes on the road, lover boy,” she said, although she didn’t mind the attention.<br />
<br />
At the beach, Kevin carried their supplies from the Jeep. Together, they staked out a place to sit on the sand.<br />
<br />
“I’ll go change first,” said Dana after she had unrolled her towel.<br />
<br />
“Okay,” said Kevin, but he seemed a bit worried. “Just, you know, be careful, I guess.”<br />
<br />
“Relax,” she said. “I’ll be right back.”<br />
<br />
Kevin grabbed a cola out of their cooler as she took her bathing suit and headed for the changing room. She found an empty stall inside and stripped down. Then, she took a moment to admire her naked body. All the hours of working out and watching what she ate had really paid off. She was beautiful, and she knew it. She slipped on her bikini top over her sizeable breasts and tied it in place. Then, she pulled up the bottom of her suit over her nice tight butt. Wait ‘till the guys see me, she thought.<br />
<br />
She stepped out of her stall with her street clothes clutched under her arm, and walked straight into a freckle-faced, red-headed, 12-year-old girl who had been running toward the door.<br />
<br />
“Hey,” Dana said. “Watch it, kid.”<br />
<br />
The girl just turned for a second, said, “Sorry,” and then ran out the door.<br />
<br />
Dana just sighed and said, “Stupid kids.”<br />
<br />
As she left the changing room and headed back to Kevin, she felt a bit strange, almost woozy, but she ignored the feeling and kept walking. Soon, she realized that her feet were slipping out of her flip flops. When she checked them, she realized that her flip flops were a few sizes too big for her feet. That was strange. She figured that she must have grabbed a pair Kevin had left at her house by mistake, and decided to carry the sandals with her clothes instead. As she walked on, barefoot in the hot sand, a girl ran past her going the other way. Dana recognized her as that same red-headed girl from the changing room, only now she seemed a bit bigger than before. Actually, she was almost the same height as Dana. This confused Dana for a second, but then she decided that the two of them must have been closer in age than she had realized before. She kept walking and started to notice that there were an awful lot of tall people at the beach today. Most of the guys and many of the women seemed quite a bit taller than her, in fact. Even the kids seemed a bit too big.<br />
<br />
For example, a couple of boys she passed, who looked to be very large 9 year olds, were building a sandcastle near the water’s edge. “Hey,” one of them shouted at her. He ran up to her, and she realized that she was only about half a head taller than him. “Want to help us? We’re making a huge castle.”<br />
<br />
“What?” she said. What was this boy thinking, asking her to play in the sand?<br />
<br />
“It’ll be fun,” he said, hoping to entice her to join him.<br />
<br />
She turned her nose up at them both. “I’m going to see my boyfriend,” she said in her snootiest tone of voice. “I don’t have time for kid stuff like that.”<br />
<br />
The boy looked disappointed for a second, but then he just walked back to his friend to focus on their castle. Dana walked on, but she did look back once and realized that she might have actually enjoyed helping them with their castle after all.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Kevin waited nervously for Dana to return. He kept looking over at the changing room, expectantly, but he couldn’t help but be distracted by some of the other bathers on the beach. The warm weather and sun had brought out some of the town’s most beautiful women, and they were showing off a lot of skin.<br />
<br />
He was checking out a particularly busty college-aged brunette wearing a revealing string bikini, when he noticed Dana walking past her. At first, he was relived that she looked to be her normal self, but, as Dana came closer, he realized that something was off. For one thing, Dana had been considerably shorter than the brunette as she had walked past her. On top of that, there was something wrong about her body; her curves seemed much less curvy.<br />
<br />
Dana smiled as she walked up to their towels. “Hey, Kevin,” she said. “What’s up?” She noticed a funny look on his face. It was as if he saw something wrong with her.<br />
<br />
“Dana?” he said. He was shocked. The girl standing in front of him was unmistakably his girlfriend, but she looked to be only 12 years old now. It was not a good age for her either. Her breasts had started to sprout but not by much, and her ass and hips were still completely boyish. Her arms seemed too long on her body, almost monkey-like, while her skinny, coltish legs seemed a bit long as well and terminated in a pair of comparatively oversized feet. Her face, which was still recognizably Dana’s, was well behind the rest of her body in development. It was the innocent face of a little girl stuck on the gangly body of a tween girl. “Is that you?” he asked.<br />
<br />
“Yeah,” she said in a girlish voice. “Who else would I be?” She sat down next to him and noticed that he seemed much more mature all of a sudden and bigger too. Strangely, it made her feel a bit insecure. She worried that she was too young for him for some reason, even though she knew that she was actually a month older than him. At least, that’s what she thought she new. Looking up at him, she couldn’t help but feel younger than him. But, he was so cute, so grown up. Her heart fluttered when she looked at him. It was clear that she had a serious crush on him. She just had to make sure that he liked her. It would kill her if he didn’t. She pulled out her suntan lotion and hesitated a moment with it. The lotion never failed to get him to smile at her, but she felt really uncertain just then. “C-could you, uh, put some l-lotion on my b-back?” she stuttered. Why was she so nervous? “Please?”<br />
<br />
“Lotion?” he said. “Dana, look at yourself.”<br />
<br />
She blushed. What was wrong with her? She looked down at her body. Something about it did seem different, but it was hard to tell what it was. Maybe her bathing suit was making her look younger. She feared that she was blowing it with him. “I, uh, I don’t know what you mean.”<br />
<br />
“You changed again,” he said. “Like last time. You look like a 6th grader now.”<br />
<br />
That should be wrong, she thought, but it seemed strangely right for some reason. “Yeah,” she said. “I know. But, you know, I’m, like, still your girlfriend. Right?”<br />
<br />
He just stared at her, dumbfounded.<br />
<br />
“Don’t you… like me?”<br />
<br />
No response.<br />
<br />
Dana realized that she was losing him fast. Time for desperate measures. She worked up her courage to lean up against him and clutch his arm against her. His body tensed up. Now he was nervous too.<br />
<br />
“Dana, wait,” he said starting to pull away from her, but she held tight.<br />
<br />
“Kevin, please. I promise I’ll be a good girlfriend to you. I’ll do anything you want. I promise. You can even, you know…” Her voice lowered to an embarrassed whisper. “…do it in my butt.”<br />
<br />
He loudly shushed her. “Shhhh! Quiet! Someone might hear you.”<br />
<br />
“Kevin,” she said desperately. “I need you.”<br />
<br />
“We should go,” he said trying to stand up, but she clung to him like a drowning swimmer.<br />
<br />
“Wait!”<br />
<br />
“What?”<br />
<br />
“Kiss me?” she said. “Please?” She had meant it as an order, but it had come out as a request.<br />
<br />
A couple of beachgoers and a male lifeguard walking by had taken notice of the two of them as the girl held his arm against her. Feeling their disapproving stares, Kevin gently, but firmly, pushed her off of him and said loudly enough for everyone to hear, “Hey, cut it out… sis. I’m not kissing you. Don’t be silly. Quit playing around.” He chuckled nervously as he watched the beachgoers and lifeguard leave.<br />
<br />
At the word, “sis,” her heart fell. At “silly,” she felt like he had punched her in the gut. Her fragile sense of self worth crumbled away. She had blown it with the cutest guy ever. He would never be her boyfriend now. She was a little “sis” to him, a “silly” little kid. Her life was over. She felt tears well up in her eyes. “I’m s-sorry,” she said and took off running down the beach, trying to escape her shame and humiliation.<br />
<br />
“Dana! Wait!” Kevin shouted after her, but she kept on running. She couldn’t let him see her cry. That would only make her look like more of a kid, a baby even. She had to hide away somewhere. After a few twists and turns through the crowd of beachgoers, she found herself near the changing room again. A place to hide!<br />
<br />
She ran inside and immediately ran face first into the large breasts of a woman coming out.<br />
<br />
“Hey, watch it, kid,” the woman said as she adjusted her top.<br />
<br />
Dana was so embarrassed that she didn’t even apologize. She just found the nearest empty stall, hid inside it with the door shut, and started sobbing.<br />
<br />
Where had the day gone so wrong? She wondered as she cried. This morning she was sure that she would have a fun day at the beach with her boyfriend. Now, here she was, crying all alone in a changing room. Her boyfriend didn’t want to be with a silly kid like her, and who could blame him? He was such a handsome guy, and she was just some gawky kid. Her life, she decided, was truly over.<br />
<br />
“Are you alright in there?” said a woman outside of her door.<br />
<br />
“Yes,” she said between sobs. “Just leave me alone.” The last thing she wanted was someone there to comfort her as if she were some weepy little kid. It was bad enough that she felt like a weepy little kid already without adding someone else into the mix to reinforce the feeling. She cried more discreetly after that.<br />
<br />
After what seemed like another hour of quiet crying and self-pity, she felt exhausted and drained of tears. She wiped her eyes dry and stepped out of the stall. She didn’t know where she was going, but she did want to go somewhere. Across the changing room, she caught her reflection in a full-length mirror on the wall and noticed all of her imperfections right away: her monkey arms, her chicken legs, her sasquatch feet, her baby face, and her mosquito-bite breasts. Unconsciously, she started to cover her body with her arms. She wanted to crawl in a hole and hide away forever. What was she thinking putting on a bathing suit with a body like this?<br />
<br />
She almost turned to hide away in the stall again, but just then a little girl walked up to her and asked, “Where’s the toilet?” Dana looked down at the girl, and pointed her to the toilet. As the _____-year-old girl walked off, Dana felt that woozy sensation again…</p>
