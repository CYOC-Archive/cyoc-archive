<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jennifer watched her dad as he lathered himself up. She didn’t know what to expect from him. Would he turn into a bottle of booze, transform into a child, or would he suddenly walk off unrelated to any of them. Thankfully the reality wasn’t world shattering for Jennifer. He simply echoed her own change. His hair turned Auburn, almost brown but still clearly red. He paled a little, gained an obscene amount of freckles (Way more than anything Jennifer had), and his eyes turned green. But finally he began to speak with a very clear English accent. Jennifer blinked and got even more confused when her mom replied with the exact same accent. English. Jennifer blinked and said something herself before covering her own mouth. It came out with the same accent. English through and through. The stresses, the slang, and the terminology had all shifted. Even the beach they were on seemed different, rockier and wetter. Almost like they were in the British Isles instead of coastal America. Jennifer was just thrown off by this but didn’t know how to do anything but be baffled. She got up and wandered off to the water finding that she was indeed along a craggy coast filled with couples speaking in English accents almost like her family had just taken a trip southward for the afternoon. She spent a lot of time just wandering around exploring the English coast and knew that her mom was taking photos of her every few seconds. It was a bizarre change and unfortunately not the last of the day. Her mom demanded she go for a swim at one point and took her into the water to enjoy the cool feeling of it accompanied by a seabreeze. This meant their sunscreen washed off and when they returned to shore they had to reapply it. The anticipation made Jennifer cringe as she waited for her body to change in some significant way. It didn’t really. Thankfully she lucked out twice and only got minimal changes. The second of which was feeling her hair braid itself up, her swimsuit turn pink, and her clothes change into girly ones. Suddenly her parents had a more feminine perception of her than ever before. When they loaded up into the car she found her favourite doll had turned into a princess doll and that many of her other toys had followed suit. Any work she’d done to draw her parents perception of her interest into a more androgynous mindset had been undone. It was like they hadn’t caught her watching boys toycentric shows or playing with video games at Christmas. Instead it was like the girl whose body she inhabited had been more into traditionally feminine things than ever.<br />
<br />
Her mom had to apply sunscreen too and her changes were more significant. She ended up getting more pregnant while still remaining seven or eight months along. The term baby suddenly became plural as her body carried two children instead of one and judging by the lack of announcement in regards to gender Jennifer had to assume her parents thought she wouldn’t like a brother.<br />
<br />
Her dad on the other hand applied a bit more sunscreen and had his body hair explode in volume. Suddenly he had a forest of hair on his chest and arms, a thick beard that itched when he kissed Jennifer on the cheek, and all of it was red meaning he was impossible to miss in a crowd now. He even got taller and broader yet retained a desk job as an insurance broker despite looking like a Canadian lumberjack.<br />
<br />
The family piled into their new vehicle which was a different brand and a different build before taking off down the English countryside. Jennifer stared out the windows in pure fascination while her parents talked about random things and paid their new location no heed. Small towns, ancient orchards, and different types of fast food chains excited Jennifer equally and by this point the English accents weren’t suprising or weird, rather they were just normal, she barely even noticed the accent now. The country whizzed past and after a long and exciting car trip they found themselves in a city again. Which one Jennifer did not know but it just made her stare with her mouth agape at everything. Old buildings, new buildings, familiar chains, alien chains. They were all there and before long they pulled into an underground parking garage and ascended dozens stairs to an apartment. Jennifer took in the new building with awe while her parents walked past the newness of the place lost on them. They entered the apartment and Jennifer was greeted with a smaller living room and more bedrooms. Four to be exact, though one was being used as storage. Her mother went to the kitchen to start a meal and her father began unpacking things with Jennifer’s help. Afterwards she got to go to her bedroom and inspect her new surroundings. All her toys had been girlified and all her clothes had taken on feminine tones. It was kind of sickening as Jennifer wanted to keep some part of her maleness alive but she was certain she could change how her parents saw her by taking an active interest in boys shows again.<br />
<br />
Afterwards they sat down for a meal that Jennifer didn’t recognize but it tasted familiar so she ate it all. Everything had retained a sense of normality and though things were going to change in a few months Jennifer was certain she could adapt. She had before so there wasn’t any rule that said she couldn’t do it again.</p>
