<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Susan was about to happily agree when she felt her testicles churn once again. Suddenly, she remembered that she had another obligation - a meeting with the mayor of Glendale, Debra Morrison.<br />
<br />
See, Susan’s reality altering cock had left one thing mostly unchanged - it had gotten to the mayor, but Debra had been elected fairly, before Susan was cursed. It was time to fix that.<br />
<br />
“Oh, sweetheart, I’d love to, but tonight’s one of my meetings with the mayor.” Susan said, glumly.<br />
<br />
“Oh of course! I’m so sorry, my love, I usually know your schedule. It must’ve slipped my mind.” Felicia replied.<br />
<br />
“It’s fine, lover. I forgot too. Maybe we should get some assistants to help us out. Maybe some with some nice, big tits…” Susan said with a wink, pinching Felicia’s ass.<br />
<br />
“I think that’s a great idea, love.” Felicia said, kissing her wife on the lips.<br />
<br />
Susan kissed back, but broke it off before it got too passionate.<br />
<br />
“I’ll see you in an hour or so, my love.” Susan said.<br />
<br />
“Yes, my love.” Felicia said, obediently.<br />
<br />
******<br />
<br />
Outside, Elizabeth was standing there with the door to Susan’s luxury car open and waiting. She allowed Susan to get in, and gently shut the door behind her.<br />
<br />
Elizabeth drove in silence, like Susan generally preferred. Elizabeth knew that Susan should always have the first word.<br />
<br />
“So, is Debbie still being an uptight bitch?” Susan asked.<br />
<br />
“I believe she is, Mrs. Smith.” Elizabeth said.<br />
<br />
“Great. And cut the Mrs. Smith crap, Lizzie. It was funny the first hundred and fifty times, but it’s getting old.” Susan said, curtly.<br />
<br />
“What’s the matter, Susan?” Elizabeth asked gently, peering into the rear view mirror.<br />
<br />
“I put Debbie in office. This town’s had an agreement since the beginning. The Smiths put you in office, you supply some money back and run the town the way the SMITHS want. I trusted Debbie but she’s being a real fucking stubborn cunt back.” Susan groaned out.<br />
<br />
“Well, you’ll just have to remind her who’s boss.” Elizabeth said.<br />
<br />
Susan’s balls churned. Elizabeth was right.<br />
<br />
“Great advice as always, Liz. I think I can do that.”<br />
<br />
******<br />
<br />
Elizabeth opened Susan’s door and allowed her to exit into the warm spring night. “I’ll be waiting right here for you. Kick some ass and take some names, my beautiful boss.”<br />
<br />
Susan kissed Elizabeth on the cheek and groped one of her impressive tits, eliciting a moan from Elizabeth.<br />
<br />
“Thanks, sweetie. Keep the AC running. I shouldn’t be long.” Susan said.<br />
<br />
******<br />
<br />
<br />
“Debbie!” Susan shouted in the near-empty conference room.<br />
<br />
A single chair turned around, revealing the mayor of Glendale. Debra was plain looking compared to the rest of the town, but she was still an attractive, brunette haired, fit MILF. She had natural B-cups, and her rear was naturally large from her many targeted workouts. She wore nearly no makeup, and her outfit was far too professional for Susan’s liking, a business skirt with a blouse and a matching navy blazer that Susan despised.<br />
<br />
“Hello, Susan. Take a seat. We’ve got a lot to discuss.” Debra said.<br />
<br />
“Oh, we certainly do. But I think you’re forgetting who runs this operation.” Susan said, her cock hardening.<br />
<br />
Susan walked over to Debra and pulled her out of the chair by her hair and forced her on to the floor.<br />
<br />
“What the fuck?!” Debra shouted.<br />
<br />
“Shut the fuck up! You’ve been disrespecting me for too long! Why the fuck do you think you’re in office?” Susan said.<br />
<br />
“B-because the town… elected me…” Debra said, meekly.<br />
<br />
Susan sent a sharp slap across the mayor’s face.<br />
<br />
“Anh!” Debra winced.<br />
<br />
“You know that’s bullshit. We had you put in. You get the illusion of power, the paycheck, the love from the crowd, but you put in what SUSAN FUCKING SMITH wants!” Susan shouted.<br />
<br />
Debra’s head began to spin.<br />
<br />
New memories of making shady backdoor deals with the Smith family entered her head. Why was she resisting so hard? Susan had put her in here.<br />
<br />
“I… I’m sorry, Mrs. Smith! It- it won’t happen again!!” She stuttered out.<br />
<br />
“It better fucking not! Now, let’s get this hideous outfit off of you.” Susan said, ripping Debra’s skirt in half with little to no effort. She ripped Debra’s “granny panties” off next. Susan’s balls churned and she knew what to do.<br />
<br />
“You’ve been a thorn in my side for too long, you little fucking ingrate!” Susan said, smacking Debra’s ass. Then, Susan shoved her cock in Debra’s ass.<br />
<br />
Debra felt pain at first, but it gave way to some pleasure. Susan fucked Debra’s ass hard as Debra’s mind went blank.<br />
<br />
Debra began to change. Her B cups grew to artificially-enhanced H cups. Her hair became more stylized. Makeup appeared on her face. Her top dissolved away, her bra become lacy lingerie and the jacket and blouse becoming a fitted, stretchy top.<br />
<br />
Debra’s lips became enhanced next, her new thoughts reminding her that she needed to set a good example for the town.<br />
<br />
The room spun as Susan jizzed inside Debra’s ass, Debra orgasming at the same time.<br />
<br />
“Fuck, babe. That was fantastic. I love it when you dominate me. Being mayor is soooo stressful and this just fixes it.” Debbie said. Gone was Debra Morrison, replaced by Debbie Morrison, a fun-loving MILF that was extremely submissive in bed.<br />
<br />
“Mmm, I love it too, beautiful. Now, you said we had some business?” Susan said.<br />
<br />
“Oh, yeah! I’m such a ditz! We have two new applicants I need you to take care of for me.” Debbie said, pulling on her G string that had formed from her tattered panties and the flare pants that had formed from her former skirt.<br />
<br />
She handed a file over to Susan, who looked inside.<br />
<br />
“Shawn and Amy Clark. IT professionals. Want to move because of cheap rent. Fucking boring prudes. Alright, send them to my house. Thanks, Deb.” Susan said, kissing Debbie on the lips.<br />
<br />
“No, thank you. I love how rough you are with me, Susan. And tell Felicia I said hi! I’d love to do another threesome.” The mayor said.<br />
<br />
“Sure thing.” Susan said, getting ready to leave. However, her balls churned once again.<br />
<br />
“Oh, and just one thing before I forget.” Susan said.<br />
<br />
“What’s up?” Debbie said, with a smile.<br />
<br />
“You know I love your ass. But Dr. Levitt can make your ass even better. Maybe make it easier to find a wife.” Susan said with a wink. “And you know how she works. Look how great your tits came out.”<br />
<br />
“I’ll book an appointment tomorrow. And I promise before my term is up, I’ll find a wife.” Debbie said.<br />
<br />
“Good girl. You know we have to encourage our citizens and set a good example. Find a slut with lots of plastic, okay?” Susan said, kissing her on the cheek as a goodbye.<br />
<br />
“Yes, ma’am!” Debbie said, with a smile.<br />
<br />
<br />
******<br />
<br />
<br />
Elizabeth opened the door for Susan and then hopped in the driver’s seat, the luxury sedan roaring to life.<br />
<br />
“You look like you want to ask me something.” Susan said.<br />
<br />
“I do, if that’s alright.” Elizabeth said.<br />
<br />
“Yes, of course, my love.” Susan said.<br />
<br />
“Are there any new residents?” Elizabeth asked.<br />
<br />
“Yes, two. But I know what you’re really wondering. Yes, I dommed Debbie again. And yes, I’ll give you more details when you get home.” Susan said.<br />
<br />
“Thank you, Susan.” Elizabeth said, blushing.</p>
