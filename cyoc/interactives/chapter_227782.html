<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“It’s… very scruffy,” Allen bleated eagerly. Moments ago he had been a shy human trying to cover his nudity. Now he was a confident satyr who couldn’t stop rubbing his fur. It was everywhere! Even between his legs! He uh- Might need to run off and explore that while his friends weren’t looking.<br />
<br />
“You lost your underwear there big guy,” Nate laughed.<br />
<br />
“I did?” Allen looked down nonplussed. “Oh right, the loin cloth.”<br />
<br />
“<i>The loin cloth</i>,” Nate parroted sarcastically, “If I remember correctly, you insist on us wearing them when we go out.”<br />
<br />
“Baah, I’m not sure why,” Allen’s ears twitched, “This feels great.”<br />
<br />
“Uh huh,” Marcus bent down and picked up Allen’s discarded football jersey. The freshly minted human looked at the garment longingly, and was clearly considering putting it on. Instead he handed it out to the satyr, “Why don’t you try this on for size?”<br />
<br />
Allen looked down in confusion. “Why would I… Huh.”<br />
<br />
He held the shirt up. He really had <i>zero</i> desire to put it on. He awkwardly took the garment and looked it over.<br />
<br />
“Do I have to?” He smiled bashfully. He finally pulled it up over his head and tried to carefully slide it down over his horns.<br />
<br />
“Watch this,” Nate beamed.<br />
<br />
Marcus laughed nervously, “I was a satyr, I know what’s coming next.”<br />
<br />
“And… there!” Allen tugged the shirt down. It slid over his broad shoulders and stomach and loosely hung over his furry legs. He was beaming proudly, “Look at that, a dressed satyr. It’s a solstice miracle.”<br />
<br />
“Uh huh,” Nate watched. “Just wait for it.”<br />
<br />
“Wait for what?” Allen bleated. He reached up and reflexively scratched at his chest. Then he <i>really</i> started digging his hands into the fabric. “What the- Baah!? Why is it so itchy?”<br />
<br />
“It’s not itchy. You wore it here.” Marcus still looked a bit uncomfortable in only Allen’s blue jeans, but he was relaxing a bit as he watched the little scene with the new play out.<br />
<br />
“I- I can’t stand this! Get it off me!” Allen bleated in frustration. The satyr hastily tried to pull off his jersey. Of course, in his rush he had forgotten about his new horns and got the thing stuck on his head.<br />
<br />
“Baah, so do you believe us now?” Nate grinned.<br />
<br />
“Yes! Yes! Just help me out of this stupid thing!” Allen bleated and waved his arms.<br />
<br />
“Hold your horses,” Marcus walked over on his new feet and helped Allen get the last of the jersey off. He pondered it in his hands as Allen started to settle down. Marcus instinctively held it in front of his bare chest.<br />
<br />
“Clothing’s the worst!” Allen huffed, “By Pan’s name. That was-“<br />
<br />
“It’s a lot,” Nate smiled. “Feel better now?”<br />
<br />
“I… Yeah.” Allen started to wag. He ruffled the fur on his chest a bit, “I suddenly get the whole clopping-around-with-no-pants-on thing now.”<br />
<br />
“Baah, well would you mind trying a loin cloth?” Nate bent down and handed Allen his loin cloth, “You’re making Marcus uncomfortable.”<br />
<br />
“I am?” Allen looked at the strap for a moment. Earlier today he wouldn’t have known the first thing about tying one of these down. Now it was an old habit.<br />
<br />
“He is?” Marcus blinked. The human certainly <i>looked</i> a little uncomfortable as he watched the two satyrs banter. “I uh, everything’s making me uncomfortable.”<br />
<br />
“You’ve got some shyness now Marcus. Nothing too unusual for a human,” Nate watched Allen finish dressing. Or at least the satyr equivalent. “Is that better?”<br />
<br />
“Maybe, umm…” He tried not to stare at the two, “A little? Why do humans care if sheaths are covered? There’s fur and everything.”<br />
<br />
Nate grinned, “Beats me. Humans are weird.”<br />
<br />
“Baah, hey!” Allen shot him a look.<br />
<br />
Marcus continued to squirm, “Look, no offense Allen, but can I change back now?<br />
<br />
“At least try the shirt on,” Nate suggested.<br />
<br />
“It’s not that- At least, I don’t think it is.” Marcus said. Then he put the jersey on anyways. That didn’t cut down on his fidgeting at all. “That’s… a little better. I guess. This all feels really weird.”<br />
<br />
“Weird how?” Allen clopped over for a better look at Marcus. It was so odd to see the satyr sport his short buzz cut, his clean shave, and basically the rest of his body.<br />
<br />
“Not having a tail is so strange. How do you let people know how you feel?” Marcus awkwardly shuffled back when Allen got a little too close.<br />
<br />
Allen’s tail flickered in amusement, “A lot of awkward smiling?”<br />
<br />
“I can hardly hear anything either!” Marcus tried to rub his ears. He missed them by an inch or two at first. “Seriously Allen, how do you live like this?”<br />
<br />
“Baah? It’s what I’m used to? Humans have a reputation for being adaptable.” Allen’s ears flickered sympathetically. “Come on, it’s not that bad.”<br />
<br />
“Yes it is!” Marcus protested. “Look, uh- This has been fun, but I hate this. Satyrs are better than humans. There’s my vote. Turn me back now please.”<br />
<br />
“Would you mind?” Nate pulled the Chronic back up. He bleated in amusement, “I felt the same way when I tried to change back.”<br />
<br />
“Baah?” Allen glanced down at his legs. He ran his fingers through the thick fur slowly. He was clearly trying to soak in the feelings. “Sure? I guess?”<br />
<br />
“Done and done,” Nate pressed a few buttons on the Chronivac and sent the command to revert Marcus back to his default form.<br />
<br />
“Thank you…!” Marcus stood up a bit straighter. He could already feel his body start to tingle again. “Baah? Are those my horns coming back? Thank Pan!”<br />
<br />
The two watched as Marcus eagerly reached up to explore his returning headgear. Allen reached up reflexively to feel his own horns. His fingers curled around them easily. Huh. Marcus’ scruff was returning to his body, but Allen still had a big tuff of fur on his chest.<br />
<br />
“I can change you two independently,” Nate wagged as he noticed Allen’s confusion.<br />
<br />
“Oh! So… I can stay like this for the game?” Allen’s ears perked.<br />
<br />
“Sure! Does that mean satyrs are better than humans?” Both of them were only half paying attention to their shifting friend.<br />
<br />
“Maybe?” Allen chuckled as Marcus started to bleat again.<br />
<br />
Marcus hadn’t thought to undress before changing. Allen was waiting for him to start freaking out. As the fur on Marcus’ arms got thicker however, the football jersey slowly started to fade away into nothingness. Baah! It wasn’t just the jersey! His blue jeans and boxers were drifting off into nothingness as well.<br />
<br />
Allen should have been concerned about his clothes vanishing, but he was mostly viewing it all as a curiosity. It was just the Chronivac doing its thing, right?<br />
<br />
He felt a draft around his waist. Allen looked down just in time to watch his and Nate’s loin cloths also disappear.<br />
<br />
“Baah…?” He rubbed his fur curiously. Looking up at Nate, he noticed some movement on the wall behind him. Three familiar loin cloths appeared on the hooks by the front door. They hung beside a few small travel wallets that were popular with satyrs.<br />
<br />
“Huh,” Nate followed his gaze, “I think reality just updated to reflect my house only having satyrs in it. You two must have undressed when you came in.”<br />
<br />
“Oh wow,” Allen blinked. “How far back do its changes go?”<br />
<br />
“Go?” Nate tilted his head, “You’ve always been a satyr as far as reality’s concerned.”<br />
<br />
“Wait what?” Allen’s ears shot up. He turned to his host and sternly bleated, “Nate… Why did you say you <i>’tried’</i> to change back?”<br />
<br />
“Oh,” Nate went flush, “I uh- I took my changes a bit further and accidentally made this my default form. I’m as committed to satyrhood as Marcus now. But we should be able to change you back no problem.”<br />
<br />
“<i>Should?</i>” Allen bleated skeptically. “Nate…”<br />
<br />
“Baah! I’m back!” Marcus clopped over eagerly and gave the two of them a tight hug, “That was uh, interesting, but don’t you ever do that to me again.”<br />
<br />
“No offense taken,” Allen quipped. His tone was sarcastic but light. His tail started to flicker a bit when he realized Nate’s Chronivac had at least turned Marcus back safe and sound.<br />
<br />
“Baah, sorry, I…“ Marcus started to reply, but he just kind of trailed off as he stood next to Allen. The two looked nearly <i>identical</i>. Marcus had scruffy brown fur, and the only difference he could see was the jet black shade of Allen’s fur. They even had the same unkept head of hair. The only real difference was the human’s face still adorning his version of Marcus’ body. “Wow.”<br />
<br />
“Huh,” Allen traced his fingers over the trail of hair on his belly, noticing Marcus had an identical clump of hair there, “We could practically be twins.”<br />
<br />
The two laughed at the surreal sight of their fellow doppelgänger. Nate joined in and waved the Chronivac, “You know I could actually make you two related if you want.”<br />
<br />
“Really?” Allen blinked, “Is there anything it <i>can’t</i> do?”<br />
<br />
“Not that I’ve discovered yet,” Nate grinned.<br />
<br />
“So are you going to change back? Or do we get to kick back and party like satyrs?” Marcus grinned.<br />
<br />
“I uh, I dunno,” Allen scratched his beard.<br />
<br />
“Come on, just admit satyrs are better so we can get back to the game,” Marcus bleated.<br />
<br />
“Nate’s got a Chronivac and you want to watch TV!?” Allen laughed.<br />
<br />
“Not really?” Marcus chuckled, “But I want to hear you say satyrs are better.” He reached out and tugged on Allen’s horn, “We’ve both seen how the other side lives. Baah, just say it.”<br />
<br />
“Baah! Hey! I… Okay. Satyrs have their merits,” Allen bleated begrudgingly, “But I’d like to request a change if you don’t mind.”</p>
