<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;I dare you to make your breasts bigger every hour until you return me to normal.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lisa sat dumbfounded as she read the text-message.  Why would Jen do that to her?  Lisa had every intention of helping Jen.  Lisa had found a way for Jen to pass on the curse and then had given Lisa the breasts she had wanted.  For a moment Lisa burned with anger.  Jen would be sorry she had bothered to dare Lisa.<br />
<br />
Lisa could feel her breasts continuing to swell.  They were not growing a fast as Jen's had in the hallway which was nice.  But the class was taking too long to end.  Lisa feared that everyone would notice.  Everyone would laugh and point and she would have to answer a lot of questions that she did not want.  She had to get out of the room.<br />
<br />
Already her breasts were becoming too round.  Lisa felt like they were covering her whole desk.  She could feel the eyes of every boy in the room leering at her.  They were rounder than she had imagined.  She crossed her arms and tried to hide them but she could feel them pushing her limbs aside.  Lisa almost cried.  She had wanted big breasts but she did not want them this fast.<br />
<br />
She tried to lean forward and lay over them with her body.  Her round breasts bounced of the desk and forced her back upright.  She tried again but slower.  She swore she could hear the rubbery skin rubbing together making loud noises that everyone could hear.  Lisa looked about; no one seemed to notice.  Her expanding boobs pushed out all around her body as she tried to squash them flat.  She could feel them growing still and pushing her body up right.  This was not going to work.<br />
<br />
Suddenly she had an idea.  She raised a hand trying to keep her body as low to the desk as possible.  Her teacher eventually noticed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry, sir.  But the cheer-squad needs to meet early to practice before the game.  I forgot to tell you that I have to leave early.&quot;  Lisa screwed up her face to seem as embarrassed as she could.  It was a lie but the cheer-team had done this before.  It was a long shot.<br />
<br />
&quot;I didn't hear anything about that?&quot; the teacher said.<br />
<br />
&quot;It was really last minute.  They decided at lunch.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Did you clear it with Mr. Stevens?&quot;  Mr. Stevens the principal was well known in the faculty for forgetting to pass on important information.<br />
<br />
&quot;Umm, yeah,&quot; Lisa could feel a lightness in her chest.  It was hope, she hoped and not hot air.  Her teacher might just let her go or he might call down to the office.  She felt like her life was balanced on a knife.  Her breasts pulled her shirt out of her waistline just then.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine.  Homework is to read the next two chapters for Monday.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lisa thanked him and rushed to get everything together.  She practically ran out the door and down the hall in utter happiness.<br />
<br />
In the stairwell she stopped for a moment to catch her breath.  Her heart was beating.  She took a good look at her breasts.  They were solidly wrapped in her cheer-blouse now.  They looked like she had stuffed two rather large balloons up her shirt.  Their size caused the buttons to be strained tightly.  They had pulled the bottom of her top out of her skirt where it had been tucked.  Lisa tried to pull it down again but found her round breasts unwilling to sag to let that happen.<br />
<br />
Lisa guessed that the growth must have stopped by now.  They looked roughly the size of basketballs.  Lisa could remember how in gym class she would hold two balls in her arms and wistfully dream of having breasts that large.  It had been years since she had done that but now she wrapped her arms around the large breasts.  Lisa clasped her hands and marveled at the huge breasts she was hugging.<br />
<br />
On Jen, who was taller, they had looked big and fake, but not too far from what Jen sported all the time.  On Lisa, who was much shorter and had a smaller frame they were huge.  She had gone from almost nothing to ones that she could barely hold.  Lisa was happy.<br />
<br />
Then she clapped her hands twice.<br />
<br />
Lisa had not been meaning to do that.  Her hands had just done it on their own.  Her breasts began to swell again.  She could feel them grow.  She could tell when the middle button on her top popped loose letting the blouse open a little more.  Then they stopped.  Lisa once again wrapped her arms around herself.  Before she could touch her wrist with the other hand.  Now she found it was hard to interlace her fingers.<br />
<br />
Jen's dare was happening.  Lisa had to find Jen and make her normal or in an hour she would likely loose more buttons.  Lisa started down the stairs again and off to the science labs.  Maybe she could get Jen out of class too.</p>
