<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">James was having the time of his life. Back home, he was just a cog in the machine. A lousy little out of shape nobody in a call center. Dull, <br />
meaningless work, interrupting people's dinners to pitch subscriptions, getting an earful of abuse he'd just have to take like there was any <br />
chance they'd still make a purchase once they'd vented. His boss was constantly changing his schedule, just for kicks as far as he could tell. <br />
And before this, it was his parents. Do this, do that, sit up straight, don't take that tone. It used to be, his only outlet was games. No <br />
accountability, nothing to judge a guy on but skill. He'd dominate the game, and he'd smack talk all the way through. In the end though, he <br />
was still just James Gorman, the pathetic little nothing. Here though, here he was the Lone Wolf. The peak of physical perfection, with nobody <br />
to answer to. Nobody to talk down to him. A proper, red-blooded warrior. When he got hungry, he'd run some pathetic little animal down, tear <br />
out its throat, and eat it raw. When he wanted to throw his weight around, oh boy, could he throw it.<br />
<br />
He had just made a kill. One of those plump little rabbits found all over the park. Tasty little treats, but not much challenge. Really getting the <br />
blood pumping, that came from chasing two-legged prey. He would never actually do them any real harm, but they didn't know that, and that <br />
life or death fear was what made the game such a rush.<br />
<br />
Finishing his meal, he began to clean up the mess, but stopped himself. A little blood on tooth and claw was just the thing to sell the image. All <br />
he needed was some prey. He tried to avoid ever hunting the same one twice. That would just make him a bully, and besides, they'd eventually <br />
learn there's no chase if they don't run. He saw himself more as an initiation right for the new arrivals. Just teaching them that he was a <br />
predator, they were prey, and that left him a bit higher on the totem pole than they were. Making his way towards the entrance, where the new <br />
ones tended to wander before they found a herd, he started sniffing around for just the right sort of scent. Oh, and this one was just too <br />
perfect. Simply a matter of staying downwind, following the trail...<br />
<br />
&quot;... It seems like everyone's subliminally pressured to spending most of their time among their own 'species' or whatever the term is here, but <br />
really isn't that enforcing the same sort of attitude that brought us segregation? Hell, you can't work on the security team unless you're a dog. <br />
Isn't that basically the same thing as India's caste system?&quot;<br />
<br />
James couldn't imagine a more a perfect target. Already a bit jumpy, with that new meat body language. Standing there, alone, just talking to <br />
herself. And the subject! He almost laughed out lout, giving himself away. Best of all, she was a rabbit. Just a human sized version of what he <br />
could still taste on his lips. He probably didn't even need to bring his verbal game for this one. Just stride on up, show off the hardware, and <br />
watch her scared little prey brain jump to conclusions. He saw a big dry twig in his path and stomped on it, just to savor the build up. And look <br />
at that! She already looked like she was about to bolt, and she hadn't even turned around! It was too too perfect.<br />
<br />
&quot;H-hello!&quot; She winced a little. &quot;You haven't seen any huskies in the area, have you?&quot;<br />
<br />
That was the one thing he had to keep an eye out for. When it was his word against theirs, the fact he never hurt them kept him from getting <br />
&quot;reported to the mods&quot; as it were, but if one ever saw him giving chase, he might have a hard time explaining it was all fun and games. As he <br />
hadn't though, he just put on a wide grin, and started slowly striding forward.<br />
<br />
She was clearly starting to tense up, but to her credit, she was holding her ground for now. &quot;I'm trying to conduct a few interviews,&quot; there were <br />
the furtive glances, &quot;it's for a documentary on the sort of m-mental changes visitors here um...&quot;<br />
<br />
Now, just a subtle little flex of the claws, that had her starting to back away, and for that special little touch, he ran his tongue over those big <br />
ol' canines... perfect! The scared little bunny tore off like a bolt of lightning, just pure irrational instinct! She was a fast one too! In a straight <br />
race, there was no way he'd be able to keep up, but these were his primary hunting grounds, and he knew where you had to watch your step...<br />
<br />
Suddenly the fleeting white form plummeted off the side of the trail. That exposed root snagged her foot and sent her tumbling down a ditch. <br />
James thought it would just let him pick up the pace, but she wasn't getting back up. She hadn't broken something had she? No, no. She would <br />
have screamed. This must just be her freezing up, accepting the inevitable. Time for &quot;count coup.&quot;<br />
<br />
James slowed his pace as he caught up, bending down with his predator's grin, taking in that look of terror as his muzzle reached her neck, <br />
and that was where he always stopped. A quick lick across their throat, and a sly little phrase. &quot;You're dinner.&quot; Just this once though, he <br />
couldn't resist an extra little touch. Quickly, he wiped the blood of his earlier kill off his claws, leaving a mark on that snow white belly. A <br />
perfect &quot;kill,&quot; but wow that heart of hers was pounding away! He felt a little guilty, even as he walked away, telling himself he hadn't really done <br />
anything. Going back to help her up would only scare her more at this point, but maybe he should ask someone check on her.</p>
