<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">While others were starting their families, others were continually being confronted with their own challenges and their own frustration. Namely one &quot;reformed&quot; thief named Mercy. Her introduction to Animalia came when she tried to steal what she thought was a valuable jewel with supposed links to the Romanov Dynasty in Russia. The attempt failed miserably as she tripped in the hallway of the apartment building she&#39;d entered and was then tackled by a Korean man that resulted in her breaking her leg. To add insult to injury the jewel she&#39;d sought to steal was appraised and found that while the gems were real, it was more than likely a replica of the set that had been in the possession of the Romanovs.<br />
<br />
From there Mercy found herself in the custody of the Moon Lake Police and getting some supervision from the FBI in the attempted theft of the jewels and under suspicion over various other thefts. The only out of it was to offer a sort of plea deal that she would collaborate with the FBI to recover things that she&#39;d stolen previously and undergo both Animalia&#39;s unique methods of punishment and then training for a specialized wing of the Animalia Police Department. Mercy suspected that last one was more a means for Animalia to keep her safe after her conversion, given what had been going on politically at the time, which she supposed was nice and polite of them, but it didn&#39;t necessarily change too many things. She still had to go through Animalia&#39;s method for rehabilitation program, which had its own issues that worked on Mercy.<br />
<br />
The punishments were not cruel and unusual, but they were different and only served to embarrass Mercy with being dunked in water and getting all sorts of treatments that were not things she wanted or even considered usual punishments. Things weren&#39;t then helped when tests and demonstrations that Mercy agreed to do only lead to her falling victim to the proportions of her new Animalian body. Her enhanced bust or butt got her caught in things that before her conversion she could easily squeeze through. It served to embarrass her further and she knew that many of the clients that had hired her in the past probably wouldn&#39;t do so no, especially while the Animalia PD were still there and the FBI Agent that had been shadowing her was also there, though now becoming more of a partner than a guide. Of course, Mercy didn&#39;t want to be embarrassed any more and had gotten some ways to put her old skills to use that had some positive impacts that wasn&#39;t illegal or anything close to what she&#39;d actually done that let her move forward.<br />
<br />
&quot;I still do not like being used as the poster child for this sort recycling program,&quot; Mercy commented slowly as she looked to both the FBI agent and one of the Animalia PD officers in one of the conference rooms that was used when Mercy wasn&#39;t taken on missions to other parts of the country by the FBI Agent.<br />
<br />
&quot;Because it&#39;s something you&#39;ve gone through and shows how criminals can be rehabilitated,&quot; the Wolf Animalian answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;But not all or can be rehabilitated,&quot; Mercy retorted, &quot;not all criminals are like me. Some are quite violent or have little real redeeming features. I was just a petty thief and cat-burglar. Most of what I went for was financial in nature and not much more than that. There is a difference between that and say... someone who goes on a mass shooting spree.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This program won&#39;t be dealing with those that would be engaged in these sorts of things,&quot; the FBI agent answered, &quot;Federal authorities won&#39;t take the risk on violent criminals that have acted in ways that would be on the level you speak on. The present new administration hopes that this kind of method could get people out of the prison systems help them restart their lives...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And most of them are going to be coming from state and local facilities as well,&quot; the Wolf Animalian answered, &quot;So, it&#39;d be more that you&#39;d be working with local officers and local candidates that would be applicable to the project.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mercy didn&#39;t immediately answer and looked down to the papers that were presently on the table that they were seated around that covered the plan and program that was being suggested. A lot of it described the program that was designed to to reform to criminals in the way that Mercy was all too familiar with. It wasn&#39;t normal, but in its odd way it worked. At times it even worked in cases where she didn&#39;t think it would work. It&#39;d worked with her, and her crimes were limited to theft and burglary. It worked with one who&#39;d essentially spread AIDS through sex. It&#39;d even worked with Heather Green, who&#39;d threatened to eat two teenagers. Though to an extent, Mercy also knew there were certain circumstances that related to those cases. As she thought over things, the Wolf officer continued.<br />
<br />
&quot;It may mean additional travel from time to time,&quot; the Wolf Animalian spoke, &quot;but in coordination with these local departments... will work with those that are likely to respond well to the style of punishment that has been used with you or Heather Green.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So I&#39;m to go and set up other traps that are designed to embarrass people to go straight,&quot; Mercy said slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;In a way,&quot; the Animalian officer nodded, &quot;some specifics may change depending on the department you&#39;re working with and the facilities they&#39;d provide. Particularly as while a great many are willing to consider the employment of Animalian tactics with certain prisoners and would want you to come in as a guide... given that you ARE an Animalian officer that&#39;s had experience with these tactics, but not all would want to be moving prisoners across the country.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Which would make sense if the crimes are locally to that area, I suppose,&quot; Mercy commented, &quot;as I was caught in Animalia and Heather was caught going between Lyre and Animalia.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A lot of that remains more a jurisdictional issue,&quot; the FBI Agent spoke, &quot;but that doesn&#39;t change on how everyone is watching this. There may be cases and questions to see if if anyone wants to become an Animalian as part of the program and how successful the program is among those who do wish to become an Animalian and those who go through the program without becoming Animalians.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And I&#39;m to be the spokes model for this...&quot; Mercy grumbled. She had her frustration this, partially related to the prospect that much of it was related to her build as an Animalian that law enforcement officials might be willing to try it because they thought there would be a way to get pictures or shots of Animalians in attire that with Human prisoners they&#39;d get sued for if they showed them in the same attire. She also noted that most of the candidates for these tests were also women prisoners.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s again something we can&#39;t control,&quot; the Wolf Animalian sighed, &quot;we gave the offer to ALL possible prisoners, but most of the answers have come listing female prisoners. Our police chief, Animalia&#39;s city government, and Horizon are trying to make sure that the program is for equal genders, that with female prisoners the guards would be female and that NO cameras in the facility is used. That hopefully will leave no abuse cases.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Assuming the guards aren&#39;t lesbians or otherwise vindictive,&quot; Mercy commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ve had it arrange that those participating are held to extra rigorous standards,&quot; the FBI Agent spoke, &quot;and in theory if it works... with these lower level crimes, we&#39;d be able to reduce the prison population, get people to truly see the error of their ways, and you could see that young man that&#39;s taken a fancy to you more often.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I do not have a boyfriend right now,&quot; Mercy answered with a huff.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure,&quot; the FBI agent taunted, &quot;sure...&quot;</p>
