<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><Br>Walking toward Arnold's house, naked and exposed for everyone to see, I saw the 
flashing lights of an emergency vehicle. They were more than likely cops out on the patrol 
with the whole werewolf thing going on. Not wanting to get caught for indecent exposure, 
I looked for a place to hide, but it was too late. No quicker than when I found a bush to 
dive into and hide, the police spotlight hit me and the cops shouted. I knew I couldn't hide, 
I knew I couldn't run in this form fast enough to get away from the cops, so I was quite 
literally screwed.</Br>
<Br>As I stood there, I could tell that the moon was still going to be trapped behind the 
clouds for quite some time. I also knew that if I got caught by the cops, I could turn them 
too and see how things played out. Standing there, I decided to make another wish, one 
that could be fun for all of us. I wished that all the cops on the force were men, that they 
were gay and that they weren't afraid of having their way with one another or even the 
prisoners. See the thing is, I have been gay for a long time myself, and it wasn't until now 
that I even felt inclined to fulfill my sexual desires. I've always wondered what it would be 
like to be with cops sexually, so now I could get my chance.</Br>
<Br>Wondering what they would be like, I stood there waiting eagerly to see my eventual 
captors and packmates if I chose. As soon as they popped out from the bushes in front of 
where I was standing, in the direction of the rising full moon, I could smell that there 
were three cops and that they were all aroused already. The scent was really strong with 
the one in the middle, I could even smell that he was leaking pre, which I thought was 
really hot and got a rise out of me. As the three got into viewing range, I could see why the 
middle guy was leaking. All of the cops were hot, muscled and furred, but the guy in the 
middle was the biggest and hottest of all. I could see the look on the other two, they were 
proud of getting him worked up in the car prior to them finding me. Thoughts of what 
they did to him ran through my mind and my cock got hard, which the three cops 
saw.</Br>
<Br>The middle cop saw my cock and I noticed that he was staring and starting to drool a 
bit. He quickly composed himself and approached me, motioning for the other two to 
stand back. They did as they were told and I just stood there, wondering what the cop was 
going to do or with me.</Br>
<Br>"Son..." he said with a slight southern drawl. "what are you doing outside without 
your clothes on?"</Br>
<Br>"Well officer... see the thing is, I was outside for a while and I got attacked by a rapist 
and he wanted to do things to me. In fending him off, he tore all of my clothes off as you 
can see over there..." I paused while pointing to the spot where I transformed, my clothes 
shredded and fell off my body. "... so I couldn't put them back on after I defended myself. 
Now, here I am with the three of you big, beefy police officers to protect me."</Br>
<Br>The three looked at each other, nodded and smiled wryly and I could smell their 
arousal increase. The officer that was the hottest and the closest to me put his thick, beefy 
hand on the back of my shoulder and started walking me to the car. "You know, as police 
officers, we have to report this attacker of yours back down at the station. Not to mention, 
we can't have guys wandering around without their clothes on. We know it is not your fault 
bud, but we have to take responsibility over this situation now."</Br>
<Br>I let my hand hang loose, while intentionally brushing up against his raging boner, 
and he shuddered. He motioned for the two to go ahead of us and make sure there were 
no prying eyes to see me walking naked. When they were further up, I turned my hand so I 
could cup the officer's cock and balls. I wanted him to know I was more interested in 
messing with him than going back down to the station. He pushed onward, but I stepped 
in front of him and he gave me an odd look of interest. I fully grabbed his crotch again, 
this time rubbing it a bit.</Br>
<Br>"Son, I don't know if you know what you are getting yourself into there, but I like 
what you are doing and don't you dare stop!"</Br>
<Br>I smiled, rubbing his crotch more while he started grinding into my hand. Knowing 
he wanted more, I looked him in the eyes and he motioned downward, wanting me to take 
his leaking cock out. I made a seductive motion, asking if he wanted me to take his cock 
in his mouth and suck him. The cop just nodded. I slowly dropped to my knees, rubbing 
his crotch still, wanting him to be as hard as possible for me. I unzipped his fly quickly 
while reaching in and grabbing his cock through his wet underwear. I felt how hard it was, 
how thick it was and I wanted a taste. Reaching in more, I found my way through the 
shorts and immediately lubricated my stroke with his pre, which made him twitch and 
jump slightly. Not wanting to waste what was coming out, I pulled his cock out of his 
shorts and his fly. Once it was out, I could see it in all of its massive glory. The guy was as 
thick as a soda can and a cock head to match. It was as if I died and went to heaven just 
then. I then leaned in, nuzzling the cock all over my lips, getting them covered in his pre. 
When I had his tip at the crevice of my lips, he thrust his hips forward and pushed the 
cock head past my lips and just onto the tip of my tongue. Enjoying the taste, I worked 
just on the head for a bit, getting more of the wanted fluid in the process. Feeling how I 
felt, I wished that I could transform at will. With that wish, I could feel myself changing 
already on the inside. I wanted him to be a werewolf like me, so he would eventually infect 
the whole police force and that meant I at least needed my fangs. As soon as I felt my 
teeth sharpen, I pushed myself all the way down on his meat, and as I came up I made 
sure to nick the main vein of his cock. All he did was wince, not paying any attention that I 
was changing at that moment.</Br>
<Br>I kept working on him as my body shifted further into the werewolf form, feeling him 
tense up and coming closer to his climax. I could sense he was getting ready to blow, 
since he grabbed the back of my head and thrusted into my now muzzle. In the heat of 
passion, he erupted in my maw as I gulped down every drop of the sweet fluid. When he 
finally finished cumming, he opened his eyes and looked down at me. Instead of finding a 
young man on his tool, he saw a wolf-like creature there instead. In shock, he didn't dare 
move or say anything since he had his most precious possession in the mouth of the 
creature he had been sent out to hunt down.</Br>
<Br>As I let him out of my mouth, I could sense something was different in him and he 
could too. When he had his member back in the confines of his pants, he was about to call 
out to his team members, but stopped before he said a word. I stood up on my hind legs 
and he just looked at me. At first it was a look of terror, but it quickly turned into a look of 
question.</Br>
<Br>"What would you have me do?" The cop asked finally.</Br>
<Br>This was unexpected and I was in shock. I had only planned on him turning into a 
werewolf to infect others, but not him becoming a servant of mine. I took a deep breath 
before speaking and I smelt something different, but somehow recognizable to me. I 
sniffed again and recognized it right away. I had become an alpha and he was my beta, 
which meant he would do as I instructed.</Br>
<Br>"I want you to infect your cop buddies, all of them at the station. First, when it is 
safe, I want you to do the same to your two partners here with you now."</Br>
<Br>He looked up at me, nodded and motioned for me to run. Knowing this was for my 
safety, I complied and headed toward Arnold's house, which was not far. Off in the 
distance, I could hear the two ask where I went. He simply told them that my house was 
nearby and he just let me go since he was reasonably sure that I was just fine. As I was 
just getting out of listening range, I faintly heard him say they were going to head back to 
the station.</Br>
<Br>As I stood just outside the fence around Arnold's house, I could not help smiling. I 
knew it wouldn't be long before all the cops were werewolves and when Arnold would call 
for help, my werewolf cops would show up and offer him  nothing. I had wished he would 
get bitten, so at some point, by some werewolf, he would.</Br></p>
