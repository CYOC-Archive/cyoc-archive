<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Will awoke the next morning, he was lying down on the bed and apparently still in his cat form. He watched a naked form walk across the bedroom, Megan was getting ready for work and had never changed her morning routine. It was nothing he hadn't seen before but it had been a while and it was certainly not unpleasant to view. After a few moments she was ready and gone out the door, not after giving him a big kiss.<br />
<br />
Though it was something that reminded him of their love at the beginning it didn't change the fact that in his normal form it had been months since she'd shown anywhere near that kind of affection for him. ~At least I have appeal as a cat.~ Will thought to himself as he layed there.<br />
<br />
Time passed incredibly slow, it was only a few hours until he'd be back to his normal self, or at least in theory. He spent the remainder of his time just interacting with the environment. Using the litter box was a trip in itself, one he hoped he'd never have to experience again. Another thing he found out was that cat's are incredible at jumping, hearing and visual in the dark, among other things.<br />
<br />
&quot;Reality Shift in progress, please standby...&quot; Will heard out of some deep dark corner. The change was instantaneous, the world around him swirled a moment then stopped suddenly. The color returned to his vision and just as quickly as that happened he was human again. Standing in an all fours position, he shook his head, standing on his two human feet. Will's own nudity bothered him little, he'd already been naked an entire day in someone else's home.<br />
<br />
A smile crossed his face. &quot;Now this is going to be interesting.&quot; Making sure that there wasn't an extra appendage behind him, he nodded in satisfaction, everything was as it should, the smoothness of his skin was back to how it should and his ability to talk reassured him that much more. <br />
<br />
Getting dressed after a few minutes of checking, Will went back to the desk. The program was still running, he selected a few more options, it had a search option. &quot;I would bet anything that this is to keep track of anyone that's transformed...or maybe to even find someone to transform, hmm...&quot; Opening up the desk drawer he pulled out a piece of paper with a name on it, it had the name of the guy whom Megan was cheating on him with. &quot;Matthew Case, that little bastard is going to pay for this.&quot; Will said, the very thought of him brought out a fury within him.<br />
<br />
Entering in the search, the computer began a search for Matthew Case, luckily he was rather close since the Chronivac's range was limited to a few miles at best. What he was going to do to the little twat was still a mystery to him. He couldn't quite understand her reasoning, all the times she spoke of loving him, traded for a guy with a guitar and nothing else. Checking his profile the man seemed like nothing more than a useless waste of space, no job, shabby apartment. &quot;He even drives a mini-van for goodness sakes.&quot; <br />
<br />
Will's anger over this situation had nothing to do with her being in love with someone else, it was the fact that she had no nerve to tell him, and expected him to not realize things were changing. &quot;I shall seek my revenge.&quot; He said as he began to work out a plan.<br />
<br />
********************************************<br />
<br />
The hours past quickly and everything had gone just as planned. Night fell soon and Megan would be home within a few moments. Will sat on the couch in the den, drinking a cup of coffee, sitting and waiting. <br />
<br />
Megan walked into the manor, taking off her coat, immediately walking toward the den, Will had left a message for her to go directly there when she got home from work, it seemed pretty important but she was still agitated. &quot;Will, what is it? How many times have I told you not to call me while I'm at work!?&quot; The agitation seeping through her voice.<br />
<br />
Will smiled, it didn't matter what she said at this point, it was all going to be over in a few moments, then he'd be able to have piece of mind once again. No more staying up all night trying to figure out what he did wrong, it was obvious that no matter how much effort he put into their relationship she just wasn't willing to compromise. Holding up his hand in gesture to stop, he spoke. &quot;Quiet.&quot; Immediately he noticed that she had grown silent.<br />
<br />
&quot;Excellent, I'm glad to see that the mental changes have taken their effect.&quot; Will said, with a smirk on his face. &quot;For the past several months I've noticed that you have had outside relations with someone, a Matthew Case, you must answer the questions truthfully. Is what I've said correct?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes.&quot; Megan stated, compelled to speak as Will asked, she couldn't figure out how he was doing this but she was extremely scared at the fact that she couldn't talk out of turn or even interrupt him. Her body wanted to do jump at him but it would not allow her the luxury.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good, then I've not made any mistakes in what I've done. It also makes what I'm about to do, much easier.&quot; Will said with a slight grin. &quot;Strip for me, one last time, babe.&quot;<br />
<br />
With little ability to resist, Megan began to strip in a humiliating fashion, not that she didn't know how to do it, just that it was being forced upon her. Slowly she started to shake her hips as she ran her hands around the curves of her body. She slipped out of her heals, kicking them away, she turned her back to him, smiling (forcibly) over her shoulder at him. Megan's hair cascaded off her face and narrow shoulders, her ass began to shake in that all too seductive manor.<br />
<br />
Megan's face was bright red as she continued, slowly she undid the tight black skirt that she had worn, letting it fall to the ground, revealing her enticing ass, which wasn't left much to the imagination by her black thong panties. Kicking the skirt off to the side somewhere she began to rub her legs, reaching up to her ass. Placing her hands near her blouse, she undid that as well, tossing it immediate to the floor, leaving her with nothing more than a black lace bra and a thong on her person.<br />
<br />
For more than a few moments she danced in an erotic fashion, coming closer to Will with each passing second, Megan ran a finger along his slacks, the striptease continued, unhooking her bra, her perky B-cup breasts were let loose, she covered them for only a moment before giving Will the full view of them, she winked at him and his obvious liking. Grasping the thong in her hand, she slowly pulled it down, ever so enticingly, finally revealing her entirely nude body.<br />
<br />
Will's smile grew, her obvious discomfort aided his pleasure. &quot;You deserve every moment of this, for all those times you made me think you loved me. You fucked with the wrong person, figuratively speaking of course.&quot; He laughed slightly. Standing, he gaged her body, it was epitome of perfection, she kept it fit, and tanned. Every ounce was toned and well taken care of, he face was the very definition of beauty. Legs like no other, breasts and ass that wouldn't quit. <br />
<br />
&quot;I want you to know that I loved you and still do, I just think that you need to be taught a lesson.&quot; Will nodded, putting his hand in his pocket. &quot;After all, who says you could mess with a virtual Deity and not get punishment for screwing around. Your little friend already learned his lesson.&quot; Will stated with a whistle a few seconds later. Within a minute a happy-looking dog came into view. &quot;This is your Matt, he's been enjoying being my obedient companion. I think it's an improvement.&quot; Again Will laughed slightly.<br />
<br />
&quot;He remembers everything, as will you, it's just that he can't help but follow my instruction in excruciating detail.&quot; Will paused, to demonstrate his control. &quot;Matt, come here.&quot; The dog slowly walked over to him. &quot;Matt, I want you to lick Megan's crotch until she peaks and not a moment sooner.&quot; Turning to Megan he smiled, watching the spectacle. &quot;You're also going to allow this, I want you to sit on the floor and spread wide eagle.&quot;<br />
<br />
Megan wanted to cry, this whole thing had turned into a nightmare. She couldn't help but follow his commands, sitting on the ground, she opened her beautiful long legs and spread them as wide as she could. Leaning back onto her elbows as Matt, her former lover, began to licking at her pussy, each lick became deeper than the last, each one more pleasurable than the last. She couldn't even protest, much less stop this from happening.<br />
<br />
Each lick brought forth a moan from Megan's lips that could not be held back. Her beautiful feet rose to their tip-toes as she began to get more and more turned on by it, her thoughts glazing over with the extreme pleasure. &quot;Oooh noo...please...ohh..&quot; She said arching her back as she rubbed her breasts, exciting her even more. Matt (the damned dog), lapped at her pussy harder and quicker, his mouth filling with her sexual juices.<br />
<br />
With moments of this, she finally let out one loud moan as her body was wracked with orgasmic pleasure. Megan ran her hands over her body, it felt good, but she wanted to stop herself. The once calm and easily manipulative man had become something totally different and it scared her.<br />
<br />
Will clapped, smiling as he walked over to them, he noticed that Matt was now licking himself. &quot;Guess he was just as happy as I was, the little twat. Now, my dear, while that was extremely entertaining, there's more.&quot; He gestured to Matt, the dog immediately stood up. &quot;You will share his fate, though slightly less in the duration. For his punishment is eternal until I say otherwise.&quot; He paused, looking to Megan. &quot;You on the other hand, I only want you to learn a lesson, to teach you not to play with people's feelings.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;To do that, I must turn you into the bitch that you are. Matt!&quot; The dog's head angled, wondering what it's master requested of it. &quot;Fuck her, fuck her until she has reached bitch-hood, on my command. Megan, get to your hands and knees, present yourself to your lover, do not resist, and you're allowed to talk now. Now Matt.&quot; He said, initiating the emitter which was in his pocket, the transformation was programmed to begin once Matt entered Megan.<br />
<br />
Megan switched positions, going to her hands and knees, leaving her arse straight in the air, presented for the dog's pleasure. Her shapely ass and body was soon to be violated by the German Shepard and there was nothing she could do about it. &quot;Damn you Will, I did love you. But how is this going to change anyth......&quot; Her question was interrupted as Matt mounted her, soon they were moving in rhythm as Matt began to pump her in the ass.<br />
<br />
Will smiled. &quot;It certainly makes me feel better.&quot; The statement fell on def ears as the two went at it, the transformation had obviously commenced, fur obviously began to spread across her beautifully tanned body, her hands and feet slowly turned into paws, her body length shortened. With each hump of the dog, Megan was transformed, her face began to push out into a distinctively canine muzzle, her nose became flat, wet and black. A tail pushed it's way out of her spine, covered in fur, it began to wag as best it could from the dog on top of her.<br />
<br />
Several rows of teats ran across her belly as they continued to fuck one another. Her ears came to a point and moved up to the top of her head and her voice changed from a sultry moan to a pleasured whimper from a bitch. Finally her pussy moved from it's normal position to a more easy-access position. After a few moments, Matt's dogie load let out and they were knotted together for a good deal of time. Will grinned. &quot;No one will remember either of you, only the three of us. Now that we have your fates sealed, I want you both to clean each other, then do whatever dogs do after.&quot;<br />
<br />
Will grinned, walking away from the two dogs, all traces of either of the two humans had been erased from the world, even the clothes that Megan had stripped out of earlier. &quot;Now this makes me happy.&quot; He said, thinking of what he could do next.</p>
