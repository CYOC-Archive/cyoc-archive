<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You stare at the bridle laying on the broken on the counter for quite a while before your curiosity gets the <br />
better of you.  You reach over and pick it up, feeling its rubbery straps and rubbing it between your fingers.  <br />
Part of your mind is saying to put it down and that this is a really bad idea, but the other part of your <br />
brain is too curious.<br />
<br />
Taking a deep breath you try to slip the bridle over your head but with its broken strap you can't even get it <br />
to stay and decide to take it off before even really putting it all the way on. You put it back on the counter <br />
and look at it. You really want to try it back on to see what happens but can't help but worry that if you <br />
repaired the strap, you might not be able to get it back off.<br />
<br />
After a few more minutes of quiet contemplation, you decide to tie the strap together, after all, you managed <br />
to get it off the first time fairly easy, you could do it again. You pick up the bridle and set about tying <br />
the broken strap into a knot.  As you pull the knot tight you are amused to see the latex strap shimmer a bit <br />
and fuse together, the knot flattening out. Making the strap unbroken and making the bridle usable.<br />
<br />
You pick up the now repaired bridle and stare at it in your hands, you mind is at war with itself. Part is <br />
saying to try it on and the other saying to get as far away as you can. After a brief moment of indecision, <br />
you swallow hard and slip the bridle over your head. You can feel the latex straps around your head and then <br />
feel the cold metal bit on your lips. You pause briefly and then open your mouth, allowing the bit to enter <br />
your mouth. You taste the metallic bit in your mouth, but you can't focus on it too long because the latex <br />
bridle almost immediately tightens around your head.<br />
<br />
Suddenly the part of your brain that was telling you that it was a bad idea asserts itself along with a <br />
feeling of fear. You can't imagine what made you think this was a good idea. Instinctively, you reach up and <br />
try to pull the bridle off but as you grab the straps all that happens is they melt in your hands and coat <br />
them in black shiny latex, you pull your hands away, feeling the bridle still firmly secured to your head, <br />
which is now slowly being covered by white latex.<br />
<br />
You feel the latex spread over your ears and begin to reshape them into horse ears. You can also feel the <br />
latex on your hands spreading up your wrists. Looking at your hands you see them coated in black latex which <br />
slowly hardens into hooves. Suddenly your vision goes black as your head is covered in white writhing liquid <br />
latex.<br />
<br />
Fear grips you as you try to shake the latex off your head, you have a strange feeling in your face as it <br />
begins to reform into a horse's muzzle, your nostrils growing in size and your face elongates into a fully <br />
formed muzzle. You manage to open your eyes but everything is blurry due to your eyes being repositioned on <br />
your head.<br />
<br />
You feel the latex slide down your neck, which stretches into that or a horse,  and back as the latex on your <br />
arms covers your shoulders and chest. You feel your arms begin to reshape into the forelegs of a horse. As the <br />
latex on your front meets the latex on your back, you know look like a white latex horse above the waist and a <br />
human below it.<br />
<br />
You let out a soft moan, which sounds more like a whinny, as the latex slides over your cock and butt. A <br />
building pressure in your rear alerts you to the fact that a tail has erupted from your tail bone. You begin <br />
to freak out, but you're quickly cut short as you are overwhelmed by sense of pleasure as your dick is coated <br />
and reshaped by the latex into a horse's equivalent. As the latex begins its descent on your legs you feel <br />
your midsection fill out and become that of a horse.  <br />
<br />
Feeling dizzy you have trouble standing on two feet as your body becomes more suitable for 4 legs instead of <br />
two. You try in vain to fight it, to stay upright, but quickly fall forward, your two front hooves hitting the <br />
ground with a loud *clomp*<br />
<br />
You feel the latex creep down your legs and over your feet. The shiny white latex changing to a black color as <br />
it covers your feet. Your lets reform as you feet stiff and are molded in hooves.<br />
<br />
You stand there, on four hooves, for a moment, taking in what just happened. You try to walk, your hooves <br />
clomping on the tile floor as you do. Considering you've only been on hooves for a few minutes, you seem to be <br />
able to walk rather naturally. In fact, everything about this form seems natural to you. You walk around your <br />
kitchen almost in a daze until you hear a sound in the doorway. You turn your head around and see the wolf <br />
standing there smiling.<br />
<br />
You suddenly snap out of your daze and realize the gravity of your predicament. You try to yell at the wolf, <br />
to tell it to leave, but all that comes out is a angry sounding whinny. The wolf merely smiles, showing its <br />
sharp teeth, but doesn't move. <br />
<br />
You stand there and stare at the wolf, but as time progresses, you begin to calm down.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why am I so afraid of my master?&quot; You think to yourself, &quot;wait!? Master?&quot;<br />
<br />
You shake your head, trying to clear your thoughts. The wolf smiles even more and moves his hand, producing a <br />
sizable amount of oats.  Without even thinking your new horse mind moves your body closer and begins to eat <br />
the oats. You try to stop yourself, to run away, to do anything to get away, but you're finding it harder and <br />
harder to focus on anything but eating the oats and serving your master.<br />
<br />
As you finish the oats, your mind is all but changed. You can't understand why you would have ever wanted to <br />
run away from your master, you almost feel ashamed for thinking it in the first place. <br />
<br />
Sensing your transformation is finished, the wolf walks behind you and feel a weight on your back, turning <br />
your neck, you see a latex saddle now sitting on your back, the straps slithering on their own and connect on <br />
your underbelly, securing the saddle to your back, you then feel the wolf pull himself up into the saddle. All <br />
this seems completely natural and normal to you. With a gentle nudge you walk out of your house and down the <br />
street. Now nothing more than a shiny white latex stallion in both body and mind.</p>
