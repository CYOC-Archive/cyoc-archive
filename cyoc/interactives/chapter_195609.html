<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;So. He actually apologized. I think one more night just to let him know he messed up and an apology won&#39;t always do it and then I&#39;ll go back.&quot; Milo said between bites of his sandwich, as he looked up into the tree above them.<br />
<br />
William laughed as he fished a potato chip out of the bag in his hand and crunched down on it. Looking at Milo, he was seeing something of himself in the younger boar&#39;s face. Maybe the shape of the snout, or maybe it was the other way around. Either way they were beginning to even look like brothers, not just think they were. Guy had lunch planned with his recital group which left William to his own devices. Milo had happily agreed to the company. The day was nice enough that plenty of the eating students had spilled out onto the green, the brother had found a nice spit under a shady tree to enjoy theirs as they watched a few dogs playing frisbee. &quot;Well, don&#39;t leave the poor guy wiggling too long. From what I&#39;ve seen that apology probably took a lot out of him.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah..&quot; Milo&#39;s grin was fond however. &quot;I&#39;ll break him in, yet. I&#39;m sure he&#39;ll always be a sarcastic shit, but as long as he&#39;s a nice sarcastic shit.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So, really? A nipple ring?&quot; William asked, keeping his voice low. &quot;I wonder if I could talk Guy into one. He&#39;d probably be up for it, he already has a piercing in his sheath, right at the end. It&#39;s kind of fun to play with.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, just don&#39;t go spreading it around. He seems embarrassed by it.&quot; Milo kept his own voice low.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s he going to do? Wear a shirt in the showers? School&#39;s gonna find out.&quot; Though William touched a spot on his chest as he thought about it. Maybe he should get one, though he&#39;d want Guy&#39;s opinion. His thoughts were broken by his phone ringing. He pulled it out and checked the screen. &quot;It&#39;s dad.&quot;<br />
<br />
Both of them stared at the screen in a daze. &quot;I haven&#39;t talked to him, yet, have you?&quot; Milo asked. William could only shake his head.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just text.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, answer it. Best to do it together.&quot; Milo said, almost reaching out to take the phone. William batted his hand away and answered it. &quot;Hey dad. Putting you on speaker, Milo&#39;s here. What&#39;s up?&quot; HE tried to sound as casual as possible as if this wasn&#39;t the weirdest thing in the world. There was some muffled machine sounds in the back, he must be calling from the garage office.<br />
<br />
&quot;Was just eating lunch and missed my boys. Thought of the three of us havin&#39; lunch in my office not too long ago.&quot; The voice as deep and firm, but jovial sounding, even if memory was giving it a touch of longing. &quot;Both of you, huh? College ain&#39;t makin&#39; you avoid each other?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not at all, never been closer.&quot; Milo said, trying not to smirk at the comment. William set the phone down on the tree root between them so he could go back to munching on his own lunch between talking.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, I know William has found himself a guy. What about you Milo? Got your sights one anyone? Will won&#39;t tell me squat, says I need to ask you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not my place, dad. Milo&#39;s an adult.&quot; Will added between bites of his own sandwich, eggplant parmesan, and damn it was good. He licked some sauce of a finger and shrugged at Milo.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bah! You two never shared your secrets with anyone but each other. C&#39;mon Milo, you can tell your old man.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, there&#39;s someone, but it&#39;s, uh, complicated. I don&#39;t know what we are to each other yet.&quot; Milo answered, it sounded a good enough one to Will. No one could figure out that relationship yet. Complicated was a nice word in his book.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh!&quot; Their father started. Here it was, this was the real reason he called. He always did this, just acting like he wanted to talk then came the actual news, or request. Milo rolled his eyes as well, having the same thought no doubt, but they both grinned, trying not to laugh so that their dad could hear it. &quot;Your mother and I will be passing by next week, figured we could make a detour and get dinner, as a family. You can bring your, um, complications, too if you want.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mine&#39;s not complicated!&quot; Will threw out, maybe a little defensively.  But the two brothers exchanged looks, no doubt considering the still human parts they had left. What would the look like next week.<br />
<br />
Finally, it was Milo that spoke up and William smiled softly to see him wipe away a tear. &quot;Yeah, um, I think we&#39;d like to see you.&quot; He kept most of the shake out of his voice. William set down his sandwich and reached across to pull Milo into a hug.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah-ha! I knew it.&quot; Their father said, sounding excited. &quot;Your mother said we&#39;d be bothering you, but I know my boys. Family first. I gotta get back into the shop. Your mother and I..&quot; Their father cut out for a moment. &quot;We&#39;re proud of you two. Just remember that.&quot; They all murmured their goodbyes and the call ended. William let his phone sit there as he kept one arm around a emotionally chaotic Milo.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry, this is, kinda new, still.&quot; Milo leaned on William though, something that seemed right and familiar. &quot;I didn&#39;t have a family over there.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I did.&quot; William said slowly. &quot;Just parents, no siblings.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you miss them? How can you not want to go back?&quot; Milo kept on softly.<br />
<br />
&quot;I do.&quot; William acknowledged, softly. &quot;I hear a lot of people happier with their new families, but my parents were good. Only problem, I was dying over there. Remember? So what, either I die there, leave them with that and all my medical shit. Or I fade away from their memories, but I get to live on here, with a new family and an awesome little brother.&quot; Will leaned his head back against the tree. &quot;All I can say, is if it was me, I&#39;d rather forget a loved so they could live a full happy life than remember them, but them dying before their time. That&#39;s what love is, right? Caring about that person more than yourself. I know that&#39;s what they would have wanted for me.&quot;<br />
<br />
It was William&#39;s turn to tear up, but Milo was already there with a familial nuzzle to cheer him up. &quot;We&#39;re kind of a mess, aren&#39;t we?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, but it&#39;s the good kind of mess.&quot;</p>
