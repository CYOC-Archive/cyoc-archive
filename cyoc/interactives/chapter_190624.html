<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Ah yes the second queen, a member of the gods that was lost millenia ago&quot; sighed Ryka as she waddled over to the large bed and sat on its edge &quot;Wait hold on, I don&#39;t know what your talking about but....I&#39;m no second queen&quot; said Alex as she looked between Ryka and Chronos.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maby not, you are not our beloved Aurora, but if you would allow it you may become a godess, a queen of the gods, but aside from that we have a request, no, a plead for you&quot; said Chronos, his eyes now seeming to become glassy and sad, as if just mentioning the name of this second queen was enough to almost bring the god to tears.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok then...start with why you need me to become this second queen&quot; said Alex as she then walked over to the bed and sat down next to Ryka who was gently caressing her belly with a sad expression, before she took a deep breath &quot;when your world was young, there were three beings, time, creation and birth, they were known as the tri unity, leaning on one another to create order from the chaos if creation&quot;<br />
<br />
Then Chronos took his wife&#39;s hand before looking to Alex as he continued for Ryka &quot;from her own primordial form, creation pulled forth your solar system, crafting the sun from her heart and the planets from her flesh, and so time began to gain knowledge, documenting and memorising every event as it happened&quot; Chronos then let out a sigh &quot;and then birth began to become lonely and sad, saying that she felt like there was a hole in her heart that time and creation simply could not fill, and so she turned to earth, and from her womb all manner of creatures emerged onto the planet, covering the land, filling the sea, and coating the sky&quot;<br />
<br />
As he spoke thoes words, Alex could almost see a mournful smile at the edges of his lips, remembering a time that no human could, but Rykas face became cold and hard as she spoke &quot;but one species began to act unlike the rest, formed in our own image, birth had given rise to a new order upon the earth, the order of humanity, we watched them in wonder at first, beings simular to us, forming communities and lands to their needs, but soon we noticed that we were changing, and we were growing in number, it turned out that humans were able to sense our presence and as such, how they envisioned us was what we became, we were called gods and goddesses, given many names and worshiped as humanities overseers, by the time of the roman empire we were greate in number, living in large palaces atop a mountain, having grown bold and power hungry that we even mingled with the mortals, and create hybrids&quot;<br />
<br />
The godess almost spat the word hybrid, with venom oozing from her words, her hatred and rage easy to read upon her face, Chronos then saw fit to step in, cupping Rykas cheeks to look at him, wiping her tears of rage from her cheeks with a kiss, and with that Alex didn&#39;t need to be told mutch more to piece things together.<br />
<br />
&quot;They killed her, didn&#39;t they, the hybrids killed her&quot; said Alex sadly, looking down at the wooden floor past the valley of her breasts &quot;yes.....yes they did, they figured that they could do a better job at creation than the mother of every creature on their planet, and so they lured her to earth....and ambushed her, hoping to steal her power for themselves.......what arrogant fools we were&quot; replied Chronos.<br />
<br />
And with that her mind was made up, but there was only one question remaining &quot;and what about the controller, why was that on earth&quot; Asked Alex, Ryka simply gave a dark chuckle &quot;that would be the forge masters idea, to avenge his mother he saw fit to create a divice that could change mortals reality, to let their greed and desire destroy them for us, bit in turn it meant that none if us could interviean as long as it was intact, leaving most of our &#39;children&#39; hungry for blood and power.....but that&#39;s another story&quot; said Ryka as she then heaved herself up, pressing her palm into her spine as she cradled her pregnant swell, before turning and walking out onto the balcony.<br />
<br />
&quot;So you see Alex, a god or goddesses life is not all power and glory, but with a second queen again, humanity can start anew, and with that the gods numbers will become more manageable, so I plead of you, will you become our second queen&quot; Asked Chronos as he got down upon his knees infront of Alex, taking her hands in his own giant ones, Alex gave a loving gentle smile, and squeezed his hands kindly before rising to a stand.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, yes I will become your second queen, your second wife, and we will reforge the gods and mortals into what they should have been from the beginning&quot; said Alex when suddenly she was lifted into the air and began spinning, Chronos now had his arms wrapped around her waist, with his large hands over her bare back, and was spinning her around the room in joy, his laughter booming around the room.<br />
<br />
As he set Alex back upon the ground, Alex seemed to entangle herself around his form pressing as mutch of her naked body up against his form as she could, then opening her eyes to see Ryka smiling widely, copying Alex to the best of her abilities with her swolen womb in the way, Alex let out a small giggle as the all began to fall back onto the soft bed, Yes she was mortal, but Alex was now on her way to becoming a queen of the gods, the future goddess of birth....</p>
