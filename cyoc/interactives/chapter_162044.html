<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Holy cows, but this deal Jerry did for me, it has covered oven my foolish sin of maneuvering Kyle to him preferring a cursing transformation; and then he instigated the secondary clause making his changes as permanent. This all might not have happened if I spoke a simple transform or dare. Carla too, she would not have had Kyle molest her, and therefore force her to become aroused about liking her becoming a cow.<br />
<br />
Jerry, good friend, he used his position at the research Lab to help change the possible course of my doom; me having caused some serious injuries to two families and two friends.” Jen grumbled, she pleased by what Jerry did for her, and then that cute stud asked her to go to dinner and a date.<br />
<br />
In less time than an hour and the silver and black painted livestock hauling truck arrived to transport Kyle the bull, and his lover, a female Minotaur to their next stop, the Sunrise Research facility.<br />
<br />
Jen then decided to clean the house where Kyle lived with his parents, they away on a long vacation. Jen had a big job to do, there were bull turds and flops in his bedroom, the upstairs bathroom, and in the downstairs living room, kitchen, and outside on the lawn. Jen worked like a Beaver, she scooping up bull poop, and depositing it under and around many of the Juniper Pyramidal bushes what made up a fence line barrier.<br />
<br />
She vacuumed the whole house, removing the bed-boards from Kyle’s crushed four poster bed. She left the box spring and mattress stacked where the bed originally set; all made up with sheets, pillow cases and bedspread.<br />
<br />
Jen removed the flower pots Kyle’s mother had growing Violets, they being munched to nubs by a young man becoming a famished herd-sire bull. The busted kitchen screen door Jen left as if the wind caught it and broke the hinges. She finished her cleaning by 5:45 pm, and showered there, as retrieved more of Carla’s clothing from inside Kyle’s bedroom closet. Her vile dirty closes she took out behind the house and tossing them inside a burn barrel, she burned her clothes as not to leave any suspicion or trace she was ever there.<br />
<br />
“One thing more to do,” Jen decided, as place a cell phone call to Carla’s mom and inform her about Kyle and Carla eloping to getting married.<br />
<br />
7:00pm and Jen was in her car racing toward her home, when who should call, but Jerry, he as hot with an idea about her and him having their fun fling date, and right that night!<br />
<br />
Jen had not called her worried mother as where she stayed for two days away from home; as that story should be an epic tale. She had enough of games and the outcomes for two friends what soon would cease being friendly, except each for the other when in the mood of rut.<br />
<br />
Reluctantly, Jennifer agreed to her being with Jerry on a date. She felt uptight, and any distraction, even an egghead science major would do for a one night fling. As Jen drove into the research facility parking lot, she noticed the 3 to 11 pm crew was not there, as the parking lot was devoid of cars with exception of three managers vehicles parked together.<br />
<br />
“Honk honk,” Jen totted her car horn for Jerry to take note that she had arrived. Jen felt a bit in aw when Jerry walked out the laboratory front entrance, and he followed by Professor Haun. Both men walked toward Jen sitting in her car, as Jerry arrived first and took a seat in the rear, as did the Professor sit in the front passenger seat. Jerry explained that the Professor needed a ride to an auto shop, where he had left off his Audi for an oil change.<br />
<br />
Jen agreed, and before she put her car in drive and stepped on the gas pedal, a syringe came from the backseat, and she looking at Jerry saw her doom coming as poked into her neck.<br />
<br />
Later, Jennifer awoke, she was like what Doc Byle did to Carla, as sedated her before removing all her clothes, and prepared her for the phase one injection of Reformation serum. Jen discovered she was strapped firmly to a steel examination table, as quite incapable of any major movements.<br />
<br />
Professor Haun stood nearby, his face the usual unemotional drab lack of any concerned expression. Her friend and date for that night was near as well, he seated between her legs as spread and held in stirrups.<br />
<br />
“Remain at ease as this is a ticklish style of an injection. If you move either right or left and the serum goes into the wrong blood vessel, your outcome can change from one of devout desires to being thrown into Hell. If I do this correctly, you will know of whom you were and what you will become, as after the transitions cease, then your knowing what you are can be a pleasant lifestyle indeed!” Jerry said as then Professor Haun stepped forward, and he began to explain, “My daughter has come of age twelve and has need of a pony to ride. You shall be that pony!”<br />
<br />
As Jerry then added, he said to a horrified Jennifer, “I suggested this reception to the Professor, explaining that since you knew too much about what is done here, you were a security threat. As such, you need be eliminated, but what better way to accomplish that, than to transform you physically.<br />
<br />
We want your memory left intact so that when you allow the professors’ daughter to ride on your back, you will understand what would happen if she were somehow injured. This serum shall during the next eight weeks cause your body to devour what is human and replace lost tissue with equine species tissue, bones, joints, and hoofs.<br />
<br />
Your transition will be twice as slow as the many others, as example Dale the gorilla changed fully in ten days. When the pain is as expected to be horrific, I shall sedate you. As well toward the end of phase four your equine mare passionate feelings arise, I can allow your’ being molested by a gelded male pony, he cannot ejaculate, but his fun thrills from thrusting should create in you a real desire for a fully equipped stallion.<br />
<br />
We do not want you to become pregnant for the first two years when as a pony mare. As well you will look your best when sleek as slim, not all a barreled body and weeping vulva. As Bao Haun ages to sixteen, your use to her will require a future change. As with a small injection a phase five will work to change the body fur color and increase as enhance your equine body, transitioning then to you becoming an equestrian mount for Boa to ride in the Olympic games.”<br />
<br />
“Congratulations Jerry, you have my future as planned out to fit the professor’s every need,” Jen said!</p>
