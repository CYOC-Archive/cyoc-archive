<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Evvie. His son wanted to call him Evvie. Evan was not sure how to feel about that, or what he was growing increasingly sure was going to happen when they got home. This already got way further than should be appropriate. Evan was desperately trying to convince himself that touching his son&#39;s muscles was purely a platonic thing. Maybe it was a little lewd the way Dominic handled it, but it...it was cool. There was nothing unusual about what was going on.<br />
<br />
Nothing unusual at all.<br />
<br />
Evan was just a normal guy who had a buff son who had just the best swimmer build he&#39;d ever seen even back in that club that started all of this, and it was totally normal Evan was completely rock hard. It was not like sexual arousal was a voluntary thing. Touching and...and certain stimuli just naturally incited these kinds of things. And it was entirely normal Evan was squirming in his seat, dealing with the sheer power of that arousal. He&#39;d yet again underestimated just how hot this all was to him, how his new body reacted to things.<br />
<br />
How his new cock had its own needs and ohh fuck, he was feeling good.<br />
<br />
&quot;Looking like you&#39;re having some problems there, Evvie.&quot; Dominic commented, and Evan gulped. He couldn&#39;t let this proceed any further. He had to say no sometime. Maybe he could just pass this off as some sort of natural response.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s not a problem. I&#39;m just...pretty sensitive. And touching you kinda made me react this way. Nothing odd about it. No problem.&quot; Evan responded, and tried to straighten up in his seat. He was so small by comparison to his son, and for some reason when it came to guys, that was something he just liked now. He didn&#39;t know why, maybe it was some additional factor this new body had. He knew he still liked women, fuck, he danced with a lot of them at the club, but right now it was a guy who was doing this for him.<br />
<br />
Doing this to him.<br />
<br />
Dominic looked at the road. It was pretty empty now. He slowed down a bit as they started to head toward Evan and Dominic&#39;s house. He then looked back at Evan and started moving his free hand to Evan&#39;s lap, starting to undo his buttons and expertly pull down his boxers. &quot;You obviously need some help there.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I-It&#39;s fine, I can jerk it on my own.&quot; Evan had not meant to be so crude and obvious, but maybe it was this younger body having some sort of influence over his phrasing.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, I think I&#39;d prefer helping you out, bro.&quot; Dominic pulled out Evan&#39;s dick, longer and thinner and so much more sensitive than it used to be. Ohh fuck Evan looked forward to sticking this thing in his wife. He outright bucked his hips before reclaiming control of himself. He couldn&#39;t...couldn&#39;t let this get further out of control.<br />
<br />
&quot;D-Dominic!&quot; Evan protested weakly as he tried to stop himself from pumping his hips into Dominic&#39;s hand. He could barely control himself. There were so many things his new body was telling him he could do with Dominic. He had to assert some measure of control somehow. Even when he was yearning so obviously to just lose control.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dude, stop wincing and just lean into the way it feels. You like it...&quot; Dominic whispered into his ear and then nibbled on it briefly before going back to purely jerking off Evan. Evan for his part just gasped and pumped his hips into Dominic&#39;s hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ohh...Oh Dominic...that feels SO fucking good.&quot; Evan moaned louder than he had previously dared to as he pressed his hands up against the head rest, grinning and feeling his hips lightly pumping as Dominic kept going. He was not exactly a sort suited for endurance at this age, but Evan was trying his hardest not to just cum all over Dominic&#39;s hand.<br />
<br />
Evan&#39;s resistance crumbled and he rationalized it to himself. He was just...letting his adult son take care of something here for him. Ohh yeah there, touch the tip ohh did he just tease the balls? Evan grinded his ass against the seat in between thrusting into his son&#39;s hand. He just needed to make sure none of it got on his car. He needed to cum, and then he could just...just hopefully keep it down and sneak off and then turn back.<br />
<br />
Then he didn&#39;t need to deal with this again. But did he even want to just forget how this all felt when it was so incredibly good---?<br />
<br />
&quot;D-Dom! Dom!&quot; Evan moaned, he could feel the orgasm starting in the balls, and starting to surge up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Damn right you&#39;re sensitive! Give it to me, bro.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nnnnngh!&quot; Evan grit his teeth tight as he let loose his emission, feeling his son tighten his grip a little bit and rub from tip to base, coaxing out all of it all over Dom&#39;s hand and arm. Evan could not deny it, he had done this with his son, and it felt good. He...he had to control himself, going forward. He had to stop this before it got out of control. Well, more out of control.<br />
<br />
He didn&#39;t even realize he was breathing heavily, and by the time he got home, he just heard Dominic&#39;s voice, which was enough to bring him out of contemplation and the fugue of pleasure he had landed in. &quot;Hey bro, we&#39;re at my place. You good? Yeah...yeah you&#39;re more than good.&quot; Evan saw Dominic cleaning himself up with some paper towels, and then looked back at Evan, &quot;How about you join me in bed tonight? My girlfriend might be coming over a bit later to join us.&quot;<br />
<br />
Evan gulped, thinking about that just made him wonder how much further he was gonna let this go. Did she really know about her boyfriend&#39;s pursuits of men? And she was...willing to make it a threesome!?</p>
