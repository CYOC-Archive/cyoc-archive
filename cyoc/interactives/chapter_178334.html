<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jake slowly stirred in his bed. He had gotten in late from his job, and despite one nice delivery it had been a taxing night. Wealthy neighborhoods meant long drives and snobby rich people who never tipped enough.<br />
<br />
He rubbed at his face, trying to get the sleep out of his eyes, but something felt.. off. For one, his hands felt oddly large, second, his normally light stubble felt thicker than it should after only three days without shaving. He was probably still just a bit groggy.<br />
<br />
He crawled out of bed, letting his feet his the floor. What was wrong with him? Even sitting felt off. He looked down and blinked. His chest stuck out into his field of vision. He had always had a good amount of lean muscle from his time on the swim team in high school and keeping up with it through college but his chest looked swollen. His normally flat pectorals looking a bit rounded. He gave one a slight squeeze, it felt like muscle. There was also a patch of blond hair growing in the middle of his new pecs on his once smooth chest.<br />
<br />
It wasn&#39;t just his chest, his muscles seemed to be slightly swollen all over, his pecs were just the most obvious. Maybe it was swelling? Was he sick? He didn&#39;t feel sick.<br />
<br />
Then his eyes slipped past his chest, down to his lap. A slightly thicker patch of hair was between his legs, but his dick looked bigger, too. After all, he knew his own dick. It didn&#39;t look longer, like the rest of him it just seemed, thicker. He got up slowly, though he didn&#39;t feel any dizziness. Maybe he caught something from that guy he blew. He grabbed his phone then stopped.<br />
<br />
He had given him his number but had never gotten one in return. He could always drive out to ask. Maybe he should just go to the doctor. He went into the bathroom and stopped dead in front of the mirror. That wasn&#39;t stubble, it was practically a short beard at this point, he looked like he hadn&#39;t shaved in a week. And the sink was higher up than it should have been. Not that the sink got higher, no, he was a couple inches shorter.<br />
<br />
Nothing he could think of caused height loss and hair growth, that was ridiculous. He felt a panic rising in his chest. What the fuck was going on?<br />
He ran out into his bedroom to gab some clothes, he couldn&#39;t get his jeans on over his legs and settled for a pair of grey sweats. He grabbed one of his tee-shirts, and even though it hugged his chest a bit tight, stretching out the fabric, it at least fit. It even was a bit tight around his arms though, the cuff resting between his shoulder and bicep.<br />
<br />
Then none of his shoes fit, all feeling too tight. He had to settle for a pair of flip flops that were still too small but he could get his foot in them. Everything about him except his height was bigger. He grabbed his keys and jumped in his car, having to make a few adjustments to the seat before he drove off. He didn&#39;t know why, but he only had one destination in mind.<br />
<br />
-----------------------<br />
<br />
Brandon lay on his couch, waiting for Jannes call. He had stripped off his shirt and was looking himself over still. His nipples really were way too puffy, the areolas seemingly almost twice the size they were before. He didn&#39;t think they were getting bigger, but he hadn&#39;t looked close in his panic over his..<br />
<br />
He didn&#39;t even want to think about that. But he did start to circle those nipples with his fingers, head rolling back as he felt static shivers passing through him. God, they were as sensitive as his dick once was, maybe more. He felt a dampness between his legs and stopped. Shit, he needed to find a way to control this damned horniness.<br />
<br />
A knock on the door saved him. He grabbed his shirt and pulled it on, though his nipples, hard from teasing, made two very obvious points in the fabric. God, even the fabric rubbing against them was erotic.<br />
<br />
He opened the door, only to be confronted by a young man. He was shorter than Brandon, but more muscular. He was built like a wrestler, though that black tee his was wearing was stretched almost to ripping over the man&#39;s chest. Shaggy blond hair, a short beard. Fuck he was hot. He could feel his libido stirring just looking at the hunk. He seemed vaguely familiar, then it hit him when he focused on the face.<br />
<br />
The guy at the door was giving him a similarly weird look until realization struck him at the same time.<br />
<br />
&quot;You.&quot; They echoed in unison. Though Brandon sounded only surprised, Jake sounded accusing.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re changing too! What did you do to me? What the fuck is going on?&quot; His voice actually cracked into a slightly deeper register while he talked. He pushed his way in, not that Brandon had much confidence he could stop the wall of muscle. Despite his few inches of height on Jake, he was sure he was outweighed by at least twenty pounds, probably more.<br />
<br />
Brandon shut the door, trying to make calming gestures. &quot;I can explain.&quot; He wondered if Jake was feeling the same horniness he did, he was certainly eyeing him like he wanted a piece of him. Brandon might not have complained.<br />
<br />
Jake crossed his arms over his chest, only for there to be the sound of ripping fabric, one of the shoulders having torn apart, he growled and pulled the shirt off, not over his head, just ripping it free. He stared down at his chest, his two rounded pecs, the patch of hair that spread from the center out towards his almost downward pointing nipples. He even had a little bit of a muscle gut with a line of blond hair down the middle. &quot;It&#39;s not stopping. I&#39;m still changing! Make it stop!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t!&quot; Brandon said back. Oh god, he wanted to bury his face in between those fuzzy pecs. &quot;I was undergoing some medical treatment. There&#39;s side effects, it caused me to change. I didn&#39;t know the effects could be spread.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh! Well, that explains everything.&quot; Jake said sarcastically.<br />
<br />
Brandon&#39;s phone rang and he looked over at it. Jannes! Finally. &quot;That&#39;s my doc. Let me tell him, maybe he can help.&quot; Jake looked skeptical but finally nodded. He picked up the phone. &quot;Jannes?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I have your test results back. Seems you&#39;re pretty much done changing. Good news is testosterone is still your dominant sex hormone, so you shouldn&#39;t see anymore feminization. I&#39;d really like to study this further, I&#39;ve never had someone wind up with a non-binary gender before. This could comple..&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Jannes!&quot; Brandon shouted before the doctor could get a word in. &quot;I had sex with someone before you warned me not to. He&#39;s here. He&#39;s changing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Put me on speaker, what&#39;s his name?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Jake.&quot; Brandon put the phone on speaker and set it on the counter.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jake, this is Dr. Jannes. I&#39;m sorry you got wrapped up in this. What sort of changes are you experiencing?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Muscle growth. But I seem to have gotten shorter. And hair growth.&quot; Jake ran his fingers over his chest hair as he mentioned that, frowning slightly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you seem younger? Probably not if you are experiencing hair growth.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No. I mean I might look older, but that could be the beard. I.. I don&#39;t think so.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And your genitals?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jake looked at Brandon, seeming apprehensive. &quot;Well, it seemed a bit thicker this morning.<br />
<br />
&quot;And now?&quot;<br />
<br />
Now Jake was pointedly looking at Brandon who sighed and turned around, only to be met with a gasping sound behind him. &quot;Bigger. Holy shit. I wasn&#39;t big before doc but.. hell.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, I need you to stay there. I&#39;m on my way over. I&#39;ve little experience with the serum&#39;s effects when spread. Most read the forms I give them where it clearly says not to have sex, but I guess I need to give verbal warning more often. Try to stay calm, adrenaline might accelerate the changes. I&#39;ll see you soon.&quot; The phone screen showed the call ending.<br />
<br />
Brandon turned around to look at Jake. &quot;I&#39;m sorry. I..&quot; Was he tearing up? Fuck, when did he lose complete control of his emotions.<br />
<br />
Jake looked down at himself. &quot;Well. I guess there are worse ways to end up. You don&#39;t look awful either.&quot;<br />
<br />
Brandon found himself wondering what was in Jake&#39;s pants that shocked him so much. &quot;I guess we should settle in an wait for the doc.&quot; Though he found himself trying to judge just what shocked Jake so much when he looked in his pants. The sweats were too baggy to make anything out. A plan formed in his head of trying to get him hard, but he smacked that down and instead walked over to the couch.<br />
<br />
Jake came to join him, sitting next to him. &quot;So. Why don&#39;t you tell me what&#39;s going on?&quot;<br />
<br />
Brandon sighed, maybe he could share a bit..</p>
