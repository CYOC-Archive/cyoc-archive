<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Whitney watched as Jule let sleep take him as the new merman slept on his side in the soft sandy bottom of the seabed. Jule would make a great new addition to this world and with luck more would follow. She had just turned her attention away from the sleeping merman when she noticed a figure on the beach, the same beach where Jule had taken his last steps as a human and where he had taken his first breaths of sea water as a merman. <br />
<br />
The figure was smaller than Jule, thinner than he was and with long red hair pulled back into a pony tail. She knew instantly who was standing on the beach in the cold rain.<br />
<br />
“Beverly,” greeted Whitney as she rose from the water, having crossed the good 100 yards between where Jule rested and the beach in seconds. <br />
<br />
“Whitney.” Greeted Beverly, she was holding her sides for warmth against the cold rain which had picked up. Beverly was a good-looking women, fit lean body with large B cup breasts, shapely legs and a heart shape ass. With a nice face, with large green eyes she turned heads wherever she went. She wasn’t super model beautiful but she would be good enough to be a model for retail magazines. Now however as she stood there in a red bikini with jean shorts in the pouring rain shivering with her hair leaden she looked closer to a drowned rat then a model.  <br />
<br />
“If you are looking for Jule…” started Whitney<br />
<br />
“I saw him give up.” Explained Beverly her voice shaking a bit from the cold as she looked behind her toward her friends who in their sleep had moved into the center little hut they had in a better attempt to say warm. “How…how long has a person refused the gift of the sea?”<br />
<br />
Whitney could see it in her eyes, she had given up and wanted to accept the gift of the sea but she also had pride. She didn’t want to tell her friends or others that she had given up early, she wanted to look back and say she was a fighter and stayed human for a good amount of time. Still Whitney’s answer was the same either way, she told the truth.<br />
<br />
“Some accept it right away, sadly others do not accept it, some die from lack of food or the elements, some taken by sea monsters or worse take their own lives.” Explained Whitney with sadness in her eyes. “Some just can’t accept leaving loved ones behind, others are just too afraid to change. Are you one of those?”<br />
<br />
“I am a realist…I know it will only get worse.” Explained Beverly “Can…can you turn me into a mermaid?”<br />
<br />
“I can transform you into what you are in your heart.” Answered Whitney as the water began to glow gain. “Come my child and we shall see what you will become.”<br />
<br />
Beverly stepped into the warm water as Whitney pulled back a bit, letting the young women come to her. When she was about waist high the water pulled Beverly out to sea. Beverly didn’t fight it, instead she basked in the warm water as she was pulled deeper and deeper before coming to rest on Whitney’s lap like a small child.<br />
<br />
“Receive the gift of breath.” Stated Whitney as she bent down and kissed Beverly blowing into her lungs. With a little amount of pain a set of gills opened up on Beverly’s side but she expected that.<br />
<br />
“Receive the gift of a new body.” Announced Whitney as her tentacles began to work and here was pain she hadn’t expected. She had seen Diana transformed and it looked almost painless even what she could see of Jule’s transformation seamed painless. Hers wasn’t.<br />
<br />
At first there was no pain as the tentacles worked her face and upper body as if it was clay, her hair red hair brightened becoming an almost impossible bright red, her eyes somehow came even brighter green as every flaw in her skin disappeared. Her bust grew from large B cups to small D cups with surprised her but she liked it anyhow. Her red bikini top couldn&#39;t take the change and ripped off but that wasn&#39;t a big deal as her bottom had been removed as well. Her core was still strong but had a sexy feminine look. <br />
<br />
Then the pain started, even Whitney seemed surprised by the pain on Beverly’s face as it felt like hot pokers were coming out of her body. The first ones where at her arm pits as three bony growth shot out of her arm pits, the middle one was longest but each came to a sharp point, then growing over them where red and bronze colored semi transplant flesh which connected to her arms and her rib cage. Once that was done the same process only 5 spikes each came out of her body between the wrist and the elbow in a V formation. Once again, more flesh covered them.<br />
<br />
“Just relax, Beverly you are becoming a very special mermaid.” Reassured Whitney as the changes kept going on. Her hips widened a bit as scales began to form on them, they where in bands of bright red and deep bronze which would have been beautiful if Beverly wasn’t in so much pain. Sharp pain from her lower back and but as four long growths shot out with a half dozen smaller ones shooting out, from each bonny growth came smaller growths forming large thin fins of red and bronze. A thin line of growths shot out around her hips making almost a small skirt of spiked topped fins. The changes went down her legs as from the area around her knees more growths came out before finally each of her toes turned into growths and shot outwards a good 18 to 24 inches before turning into sharp tips with thin red and bronze membrane around them.<br />
<br />
Finally breathing heavily and in the most pain she had ever been the transformation stopped.<br />
<br />
“I am so sorry my child, but the pain is over.” said Whitney as she whipped away Beverly’s tears. “Receive the gift of knowledge.”<br />
She pulled the soar and tired Beverly to her breast and let her drink of her milk. The milk was nice, but it took the pain away but even better was it gave her knowledge of what she had just become. When she was done Whitney removed her breasts and pulled away before with a wave of her hand, some of the water solidified and turned into a tall mirror.<br />
<br />
Beverly looked at herself, she was breathtaking beautiful with long bright red hair, glowing green eyes, perfect skin, large breasts and a sexy core. Her arms where long and elegant but from her wrist and arm pits where red and bronze membranes and coming from her back and sides where long thin almost wing like fins which where breathtaking beautiful with the red and bronze but each tipped with a sharp point. <br />
<br />
“You are a rare mermaid my daughter.” Said Whitney as Beverly smiled, it was so much to take in but she loved it as she flared out her new fins, part of the gift of knowledge was what she was and how to control all her new fins like she was born with them she knew how to pull them close to keep anyone around her safe and how to extend them to defend herself. She stuck a sexy pose raising one arm over her head and looking at herself in the mirror like she was in a new dress. “You are a lion fish mermaid and a beautiful one at that.”<br />
<br />
There are many types of mermaids and merman, each different but all the same species. As a lion fish mermaid Beverly wouldn&#39;t be the fastest swimmer mermaid but she was had all the spiked fins to defend herself if needed. Even as a lion fish mermaid she would have a &quot;normal&quot; life as a mermaid and could have kids and a family with any other merfolk. The type of tail was based on genes and lion fish tail was a rare recessive gene nothing more. <br />
<br />
&quot;I am.&quot; said Beverly as she looked at herself and smiled, she already was enjoying her new body but she wasn&#39;t sure what to do next.</p>
