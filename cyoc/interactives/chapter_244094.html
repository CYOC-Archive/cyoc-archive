<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“I can do whatever the fuck I want…” Chloe said to herself, unable to wipe the grin off her face (not that she even wanted to).<br />
Instinctively, she said “I wish I had a million dollars!”<br />
Expecting the money to have just appeared right in front of her, she feels slightly underwhelmed. But in a few moments, she pulls out her phone, checking her banking app. There it is, $1,000,000 exactly in her account.<br />
“Holy fucking shit, I’m actually rich…” she says to herself, “I-I wish it’s like ten million.”<br />
Within seconds, she watches as the number in her account grows, dollar by dollar until it reaches $10,000,000. She thinks over how on earth she can cover this up… then once again, she remembers the solution to all her problems, “I wish that no matter what, I can own this money with absolutely no legal repercussions.”<br />
And just like that, it was done. No risk of being accused of fraud. Nothing, she just has $10,000,000.<br />
<br />
“So I’m rich… what else do I even need?” She asked herself, “I could use a bigger apartment— hell, I could just get a mansion all to myself. God, even a boyfriend… or a girlfriend. Fuck it, why not. I—”<br />
“MOM!” Natalie screeched from the other room, “Please! Knock it off with the talking to yourself, it’s so annoying!” She yelled across the apartment.<br />
Natalie and Chloe had always had a level of respect for one-another as single women living in the city, but now that Natalie believed that Chloe was her mom, all of that was out the window. Not to mention, their other roommate, Ross, wasn’t even back yet. That’d be an interesting reaction.<br />
<br />
“I wish that my room is sound-proof.” Chloe said. And in a few moments, the sound of the TV was quickly drowned out, and it was completely quiet, expect for Chloe’s own breathing. It was eerily quiet, in fact. “Weird…” she said.<br />
She needed to test the sound proofing though, “I wish I had a trombone.”<br />
And in a matter of moments, a noodling golden tube appeared in her hand, winding and growing before transforming into a well-polished trombone.<br />
“And I wish I knew how to play the trombone.”<br />
And just like that, her fingers readjusted themselves as if they’d held this thing for her entire life. She lifted the mouthpiece to her lips, and blew into it whilst simultaneously moving the slide. She played a beautiful melody, like something from an orchestra, but able to hold her own. Even Chloe was amazed by the sound she was able to produce.<br />
But as much as it was beautiful, it was loud. And clearly she hadn’t heard any protesting from Natalie nor their neighbours. So clearly it must’ve worked.<br />
<br />
Even with an infinite supply of money, it really didn’t mean much. Chloe could get whatever she wanted, even outside the realm of believability. There were so many things she’d wanted throughout her entire life, it was hard to pin her mind on just one thing. But something stuck out to her… her mirror.<br />
She walked her way over to the mirror. It was full-body, which meant she took all of herself in. She decided to take off her bag and overshirt, throwing it onto her bed beside all of the jewellery. The clattering of metal echoing throughout the room.<br />
<br />
She looked at her body. She’d always been average in every way… nothing special. When as a teenager, she would’ve killed to have even a little more curve to her figure. But now, nothing was stopping her. Except herself.<br />
Sure, she had average breasts. She could do with a little more, but ever since she was younger, she always wanted a little more junk in the trunk. Even just a little.<br />
“I… I wish my butt was I little bigger.”<br />
And like magic, she felt her jeans tighten a little. She felt her panties get tighter, ride up her cheeks the tiniest amount. She watched in the mirror as her butt grew. Her eyes glistened with amazement. Not only did you watch it, she felt it too. And god did it feel good.<br />
She turned, looking at the silhouette of her ass. It was bigger, even if only by a tiny bit, it felt amazing. She was finally just an inch over average…<br />
“I wish my butt was even bigger.”<br />
She braced herself. The familiar feeling came back, her jeans tightening, this time quicker. Her panties riding up more and more, creating more of a wedge, even getting tighter on her pussy. She stared at her ass, watching as it grew, rounder and bigger, creating more and more shape on her body. And as it stopped, she admired her figure in the mirror. She slapped her hand on it, feeling the tightness of her flesh through her taut jeans. She had a bubble-butt, undeniably. And it looked so natural, no one would even bat an eye.<br />
<br />
She then looked down, and found her breasts feeling more sensitive, her nipples were rock hard. No way this was really turning her on this much. <br />
Sure, she appreciated the idea of growing and changing… but she wasn’t really into this? Right?<br />
“Maybe I am…” she said to herself. All she really wanted to do was make her butt even bigger. Make it so big that it stood out, that anyone walking past would see the jiggle of her big round butt. She really did want it more than anything…<br />
“Okay, fuck it why not, I wish I had a massive bubble-butt!”<br />
<br />
Almost instantly she felt her butt growing again. Straining tight against her jeans. She actually felt them creaking from the growth. She looked back to see her cheeks swelling at an alarming rate, growing bigger and rounder, each second adding more and more shape to her body. As she looked back at the mirror, they each looked bigger than her head, and they were still growing.<br />
“Maybe I went a little overboard with the word ‘massive.’” Chloe said to herself, watching as her butt swelled bigger and bigger, until finally.<br />
SHRIIIIIP!<br />
Her jeans split open right down seam, showing off what could be considered her butt-cleavage. She watched as it grew a little bigger, splitting more and more threads, before finally slowing to a stop.<br />
<br />
Chloe looked back at her massive ass. It looked… a little off-putting. It definitely didn’t look natural. Actually, it was so big it didn’t even look fake… it just looked strange having a massive ass with no meat to compliment it.<br />
“I mean… I went from nothing to huge! No wonder it looks weird on its own…” she said to herself. She took a deep breath before saying the magic words once again, “I wish I had super wide hips.”<br />
<br />
This one felt stranger. Before, it felt like fat was being poured into each of her cheeks, swelling bigger like a balloon filled with water, this one… her body was readjusting. Her bones were changing, extending and growing. She turned to face the mirror, and watched as not only did her hips grow wider, getting ever-closer to being parallel to her shoulders, but she found the distance between her thighs was getting greater. Her thigh gap was becoming noticeable, to obvious, to extreme. <br />
Then the front button of her jeans broke, followed by the zipper snapping and straining before breaking entirely, revealing her incredibly tight (and uncomfortable) panties, threatening to break as well. But Chloe was loving ever moment of it.<br />
And then, in just a moment, it stopped. Her hips had reached their limit. They were several inches wider than her shoulders, and they looked insane on the rest of her figure, but admittedly; they made her butt look slightly more natural. There was just one thing still missing.<br />
“I wish my thighs were thicker, and made my hips and ass looks more natural.”<br />
<br />
And similarly to her butt, her thighs started to feel like they were being inflated by water, filled with fat. It was so satisfying to feel her own body, slowly filling up. Filling out whatever she’s wearing and becoming tighter and tighter, until eventually they reached their limit, and break out of their confines to reach their final goal.<br />
And they did exactly that. Her jeans started to split, seam by seam like before, down the sides of her jeans. Revealing more and more skin as her body filled out, creating this thick silhouette that would make anyone’s head turn.<br />
Slowly, just as before, it came to an end. Her thighs slowed, and finally, her lower body looked so much more natural.<br />
She stared at it, turned on unlike anything she’d ever experienced. Chloe was hardly able to comprehend that it was her own body, but the moment she grabbed at her ass, her thighs, the pure erotic sensation that rushed through her body brought her back to reality. This was Chloe. All Chloe.<br />
<br />
“Fuck…” she said to herself, her voice filled with lust. Looking at herself in the mirror, bringing herself back to reality. She grabbed and played with herself, turning around, bouncing up and down as she felt her whole lower half jiggle.<br />
“I wish these Jeans were off me.” She said, and the jeans fell off her body, landing on the floor. She just looked at her full thighs, huge ass, wide hips. Even that thigh gap was so mesmerising to her.<br />
“This is so fucking hot…” she said. She knew it didn’t feel like the right body, but it didn’t matter.<br />
“I can have whatever body I want… whenever I want it. And no one can do anything to stop me.” She said to herself.</p>
