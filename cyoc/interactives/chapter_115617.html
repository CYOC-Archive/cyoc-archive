<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">{{Okay, working third shift and the weather the last few days were not a good combination, especially when you can&#39;t get online because you have no electricity! But I&#39;m back now.—tmw.}}<br />
<br />
The conclave of Jennys (for lack of a better name) met in the predawn hour before the future Mrs. Jenkins awoke for the day.<br />
Jennifer Harper, the way she was now, was in conference with both her were side and her old personality before moving to Moon Lake.<br />
&quot;Like everyone said, it&#39;s not your fault,&quot; repeated her werevixen fursona, while hugging the normal human looking Jenny Harper.<br />
&quot;I know, but—&quot;<br />
&quot;No buts!&quot; exclaimed the plain Jenny that represented how she looked before being transformed into a werevixen by the rogue Yvette Smith. A woman who couldn&#39;t even hope to beat Olive Oyl in a beauty contest. &quot;Look,&quot; she added, while holding out her hand.<br />
With that, the werevixen side of her held out a paw, and Jenny watched in amazement as both hands came VERY close to actually touching each other.<br />
&quot;We&#39;re getting stronger every day,&quot; confirmed the werevixen. &quot;Granted, yesterday was a setback with Huck getting shot by that bastard Wilhelm&#39;s latest henchman thinking he was killing Harry,&quot; a statement that made the human Jenny start to cry again.<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t start. You&#39;re stronger than that,&quot; admonished the plain, pre-transformation Jenny.<br />
&quot;True. But despite the improvements,&quot; said the new Jenny, showing off her fantastic body, &quot;we&#39;re still human.&quot;<br />
&quot;Now listen,&quot; said plain Jenny. &quot;We&#39;ve only got a couple of moments left before your alarm goes off because both you and Harry have class today. When you see Doctor Twist, warn her that Wilhelm will be arriving here Saturday morning armed and with another henchman by his side.&quot;<br />
&quot;WHAT?&quot; exclaimed the post transformation Jenny.<br />
&quot;It&#39;s true,&quot; confirmed her fursona. &quot;We don&#39;t know where our family will stand once that skunk shows his true colors,&quot; she said, referring to Jenny&#39;s parents and siblings, who were only coming to Moon Lake long enough to stop the wedding and drag her back to Alabama, where they wanted her to marry Dieter Wilhelm, &quot;but if you have to let them go, DO SO!&quot; she advised.<br />
&quot;Isn&#39;t that a bit harsh?&quot; asked Jenny.<br />
&quot;There might still be a chance to save our sisters, but don&#39;t put yourself or the town at risk,&quot; advised plain Jenny. &quot;Mother is too far gone down her chosen path as it is and the Harper men are a lost cause, unless...&quot;<br />
&quot;Unless what?&quot;<br />
Were Jenny and Plain Jenny looked at each other. Then, after Plain Jenny nodded her head, the werevixen spoke.<br />
&quot;We know you&#39;ll be able to save our younger sister Janice. You can get her emancipated minor status with Tachibana no Akane&#39;s help and relocate her here to Moon Lake. Henry Senior and his wife will love to have a child in their house again until you and Harry or Huck and Betty start giving them grandchildren. But the future is uncertain concerning our younger brother. John is having a crisis of faith. He&#39;s not sure Dad&#39;s right about a lot of stuff, especially considering John isn&#39;t sure whether or not he&#39;s gay.&quot;<br />
Jenny was about to respond when the alarm clock started to ring, bringing her back to &quot;reality&quot;.<br />
<br />
Werevixen Jenny Harper awoke within the furry arms of her werefox mate Harry Jenkins.<br />
There was a smile on his muzzle as he stared at her.<br />
&quot;Good morning darling,&quot; he said, before kissing her. &quot;Did you sleep well?&quot;<br />
&quot;We need to talk,&quot; was all Jenny said, before she started recalling her dream.<br />
<br />
MEANWHILE...<br />
Karen Yuletide came out of the guest bathroom at the Talbot home and walked straight into a bare chested Peter Talbot.<br />
&quot;Oh. Sorry,&quot; she said, looking up at her taller boyfriend.<br />
&quot;Morning,&quot; said Peter with a smile. &quot;I should have watched where I was going. Not used to having competition for the bathroom,&quot; he added.<br />
&quot;Can we talk?&quot; asked Karen.<br />
&quot;Sure,&quot; replied Peter, then was surprised to find himself being dragged into the bathroom.<br />
Karen closed the door behind them and said, &quot;I&#39;ve been doing some serious thinking.&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh?&quot; he asked, hoping there would be a chance to relieve himself soon.<br />
&quot;First off, with the wedding Saturday morning and the immediate threat from that jerk Dieter Wilhelm over until then, I&#39;m moving back into the dorm for the duration. You&#39;ve all been great to me, but right now I think Jenny needs me more the closer we get to the wedding.&quot;<br />
&quot;Okay. No problem. But you know you&#39;re always welcome here.&quot;<br />
&quot;I appreciate that,&quot; said Karen, before giving Peter a brief hug. Thankfully he was in a pair of old gym shorts after reassuming his human form, and with needing to answer nature&#39;s call, there was no immediate sign of &#39;morning wood&#39; after the hug.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now then,&quot; she continued. &quot;I just want you to know that while I honestly can&#39;t say exactly when, the thought of becoming your wife, let alone your werelioness is something that has started occupying my mind a lot more of late.&quot;<br />
&quot;Really?&quot; was all Peter could say, as a smile crossed his face.<br />
&quot;While the thought of lions having a lioness harem still bothers me, I&#39;m learning to trust you and am growing more confident in our relationship.&quot;<br />
&quot;Having a harem would be my right both within nature and as the Lion Prince and future Lion King of Moon Lake, but it wasn&#39;t something I planned to actively pursue since meeting you,&quot; admitted Peter.<br />
Karen smiled as her heart soared at that announcement. &quot;Nice to know, but your mother told me that there are times when your father still has to be with other women because they want the &#39;honor&#39; of being with him, let alone whenever normal women want to be inducted into were society by royalty.&quot;<br />
<br />
Peter had no response to that, so Karen continued. &quot;I know what&#39;s in here,&quot; she said, pointing to her heart. &quot;I just have to get this,&quot; she added, pointing to her brain, &quot;to be in total agreement with it.&quot;<br />
&quot;Understandable,&quot; agreed Peter.<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t say exactly when that will happen, but when the time does come, I want it to be after Jenny&#39;s wedding and Betty&#39;s too, whenever she and Huck have theirs.&quot;<br />
&quot;Okay.&quot;<br />
&quot;I do have feelings for you Peter, and they&#39;re growing every day. I&#39;m just not at the point where I&#39;m prepared to make that lifetime commitment yet, but I wanted to reassure you that I&#39;m not stringing you along or anything.&quot;<br />
&quot;I never suspected that at all. You&#39;re not that kind of woman Karen,&quot; he said, before Peter gave her a loving hug.<br />
He could smell Karen start to release moisture between her legs underneath her bathrobe, but never said anything.<br />
When she was ready to join him and become a werelioness, that was when he would propose.<br />
<br />
&quot;Did you hear?&quot; Regina Talbot whispered to her husband, for their bed was against the wall that bordered the guest bathroom and their acute were hearing allowed them full access to the conversation, since the two lovers didn&#39;t bother keeping their voices low since they were in private and the door was closed.<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; the werelion whispered to his mate, holding her furry body next to his. &quot;I wonder what our grand cubs will look like?&quot; he asked with a smile.</p>
