<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Fuck you Rob! You think you can order us around? I wish you&#39;d see what it&#39;s like to be a woman!&quot;<br />
<br />
The Ahn&#39;Ger Stone suddenly ignited in Tammy&#39;s hand, activated by her fiery feminine ire, her righteous anger at this man assaulting her best friend. Instinctively opening her hand, Tammy watched as it consumed Rob in its verdant glow.<br />
<br />
Rob&#39;s body, which looked like it was carved from granite, momentarily disappeared inside the maelstrom of energy, leaving only an eerie afterimage of Rob&#39;s shadow. When Rob&#39;s body finally reappeared a moment later, Tammy and Willow gasped in awe as the drunken bully had been thoroughly reconstituted<br />
<br />
The woman who stood before the two former boys was almost as tall had Rob had once been, but she was infinitely curvier. Her breasts, the largest that either teenage boy turned adult woman had ever seen, dwarfing both of their own pairs, tented out from the green tank top that clinged tightly to her body, leaving nothing to the imagination. Her legs? One could get lost on the way to the top as you stared at them, her feet protected by a pair of cute pink heeled sandals. Her hips, encased in a pair of blue cut off jean shorts, jutted out sensually in either direction, contrasted by the tightness of her waist. Behind her, she carried a rear end that a toddler could hop on top of and not fall off.<br />
<br />
Not good enough for you? A swan like neck carried an absolutely gorgeous face held together by glittering emerald eyes, a button nose, slight freckles, lips so plump Tammy wondered how this beauty could even speak, and a mane of deep red hair that reached her lower back.<br />
<br />
This woman, the transformed Rob, carried a look of utter shock on her face as she examined her new body with her soft hands. She had to be careful to avoid poking herself with her long red nails.<br />
<br />
She stared appraisingly at Willow and Tammy, and briefly looked like she wanted to strangle them both, before her scowl suddenly turned into...a smile. She squealed and ran over to hug the former Tom.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tammy! Willow! Oh my God, I haven&#39;t seen you two since high school!&quot; she yelled, enveloping Tammy in her surprisingly tight grip, lifting Tammy off of the ground for a moment.<br />
<br />
After a terrifying thirty seconds, she let the brunette go. Bill, now Willow, was the next victim of Rob&#39;s bear hug, their boobs mashing together for a second.<br />
<br />
&quot;Um..um...Rob...?&quot;<br />
<br />
The former Rob giggled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t tell me that you forgot my name. It&#39;s not Roberta, it&#39;s Bobbi! Bobbi Bolstrum! So what have you two been up to lately?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh...just hanging around&quot; Tammy answered politely, not sure what to say about Rob&#39;s sudden personality change.<br />
<br />
A weird feeling overcame Bill.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m... about to go to work&quot; he said casually, against his will.<br />
<br />
Why was he saying he was about to go to work? He worked part time after school, but it was still early in the morning!<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, neato! Where do you for work?&quot; Bobbi asked.<br />
<br />
Bill couldn&#39;t answer her question, but &quot;Willow&quot; could.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m a cartoonist. Freelance. But between that, an office job at IngerCorp.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh wow!&quot; Bobbi said. &quot;That must pay really well, right? Ingerman is like Elon Musk rich.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I do OK, but I really prefer drawing. I&#39;d like to go back to school someday and enroll in ani...&quot;<br />
<br />
Where was all of this coming from? It was almost as if Bill and Willow were two different personalities, sharing a body. Willow was carrying on an entire conversation with &quot;Bobbi&quot; while Bill listened on, almost a spectator in his own body.<br />
<br />
Apparently, &quot;Willow&quot; had lived an entire life seperate from Bill&#39;s. She seemed to share certain similar interests, like Marvel and Star Wars, and apparently they both had an affinity for math and science, but they diverged in other ways.<br />
<br />
Vaguely, he recalled growing up about a decade earlier than Bill had, as a very pretty and popular blonde girl, a far cry from the quasi outcast that Bill was. Willow&#39;s family seemed similar to his own. There was still a Martha and a Greg and a Kimmy, but they all looked different. They treated him different. People at school treated him different, in certain ways that recalled feelings of revulsion. He was...he and Tammy were freaking cheerleaders?<br />
<br />
What had Tam...Tom done to him?!<br />
<br />
God, he had to fight his new body&#39;s instincts every step of the way to not let &quot;Willow&quot; overtake him!<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s awesome!&quot; Bobbi exclaimed. &quot;You were always so talented in art class, I think you would be an amazing animator! Don&#39;t give up on your dreams! Are you seeing anyone?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, her name is Kylie. She&#39;s a coworker&quot; Willow answered with a tiny smile on her pretty face.<br />
<br />
Bill wondered who this &quot;Kylie&quot; was, but for some reason, he wasn&#39;t able to access Willow&#39;s memories. This was so weird! Is this what people with Dissociative Identity Disorder go through?<br />
<br />
&quot;Cool!&quot; Bobbi said. &quot;What about you, Tammy?&quot; the redhead asked, turning to face the former Tom. &quot;What have you been up to?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I..I&quot; Tom struggled before Tammy took control of the wheel.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m a stay at home mom.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You have kids?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Kid. Singular. His name is Tommy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow! How old is he?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He&#39;s four! I have to wake him up in a minute and feed him breakfast. I was just saying hi to my bestie first.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you married?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Is this an answer?&quot; Tammy said, showing Bobbi her expensive wedding ring.<br />
<br />
Bobbi screamed loudly in excitement.<br />
<br />
Inside Tammy&#39;s body, Tom was feeling just as lost as Bill currently was, but he was oddly OK with taking a back seat and living someone else&#39;s life for right now. After all, his wish had been to learn to understand women better. What better way to learn what female lives were like than living through one?<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s your husband&#39;s name?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;His name is Todd.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sensing a pattern here&quot; Bobbi giggled. &quot;Tammy, Tommy, Todd. Cute.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How about you? What are you doing?&quot; Tammy asked, curious.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m a model! Can you believe it?&quot;<br />
<br />
Bobbi twirled, showing off her magnificent body. Bill felt some wetness in his new genitals.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think we can believe it&quot; Bill said.<br />
<br />
&quot;And the best news is that I&#39;m not living in the trailer park anymore! I have a sweet apartment in Old Shermer, and I...&quot;<br />
<br />
As Bobbi babbled on mindlessly about her awesome life, inside, Rob Bolstrum was screaming in impotent rage.<br />
<br />
What the fuck did that brown haired skankasaurus do to him?! One minute he was tossing Blondie aside for being a cunt to him, trying to cop a feel of her friend, and next..he was inside the body of some ginger bimbo who was excited to see her &quot;bffs&quot; from high school a decade ago.<br />
<br />
Rob felt like he was losing control of himself. Oh God, he had to get out of here!<br />
<br />
The Tammy part of Tom&#39;s mind was happy to see Bobbi again. She didn&#39;t remember Rob(Tom did), but instead a friendly, slightly ditzy and impoverished girl who had gone through puberty very young and had be forced to put up with a lot of shitty guys who constantly objectified her, including one of their teachers, who later got fired for getting a student pregnant. That&#39;s why her and Willow tried to be her friend and support her, so she didn&#39;t head down a bad path. She liked Bobbi, and she was happy to see her be successful and apparently happy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you...do you want to come inside, Bobbi?&quot; she asked in a friendly way. &quot;I have enough pancake mix to make enough for all three...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Shut up, you dumb bitch!&quot; Bobbi snarled spontaneously, her innocent doe eyes suddenly taking on a flinty meanness to them, and the gorgeous redhead fled towards her pick up truck and drove away.<br />
<br />
&quot;Um...&quot; Bill/Willow said. &quot;What was that about?&quot;</p>
