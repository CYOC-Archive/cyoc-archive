<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><br>Waiting for a few minutes, Kris stood outside of the costume shop, making sure that Ben wasn't anywhere near since Kris really wanted it to be a surprise. Once Kris was sure he was not being watched, he slowly put his hand on the door, pushed it open and heard the bells hung directly over the door chime to alert whomever in the store that they had a customer. As Kris walked in the store, a cold chill swept over him, sending goosebumps to cover his skin and make him a bit nervous overall. It wasn't every day that he walked into a strange shop like the one that he was in now, but Kris knew that he had to get a costume and time was running out. If no one else knew about this place, he was sure to have a treasure trove, but if they did... well, Kris was sure that he would have the same issue he has had thus far. At this point, Kris wasn't going to be picky, he just wanted to find something good.</br>
<br>As Kris surveyed the interior of the store, he was a bit confused as to how this was a costume store in the first place... there were no costumes anywhere in sight. <em>Must be in the back or an on order type of place</em> Kris thought to himself. Slowly walking toward what looked to be the front counter, Kris took in how really creepy the place was. There were cobwebs everywhere, as if the place had been completely deserted for a few years and no one came in to maintain the place. There were dozens of old, wooden bookcases lined with jars of strange fluids and some even had specimens floating in them. Kris shuddered, but he was moderately sure that they were there for looks, to add to the creepiness of the costume shop, especially since it was so close to Halloween.</br>
<br>The closer Kris got to the front counter, the more he wondered if someone was there. He had thought about calling out to someone, but Kris was aware that the bells were pretty loud and he was sure that someone must have heard him. Coming up to the big, long counter, Kris noticed that the front had glass for you to look into the shelves to see what was inside. There were several medium sized glass jars, all filled with the same odd fluids, but these had labels on them. A few of the jars were turned just enough for Kris to make some of them out. One was "Wolfsbane Extract", another was "Swamp Mudd" a third read "Essence of K-9". As Kris became engrossed in reading, a voice came from in front and above Kris. Kris froze where he was bent down at his knees from trying to get a good look at what was in the display case, he knew it was one of the shop keeps, but he felt like he shouldn't move... as if he was a dog that just got caught doing something it wasn't supposed to be.</br>
<br>"Erhm, can I help you young man?" The voice said, allowing Kris to distinguish that the voice belonged to a man.</br>
<br>As Kris stood up slowly, without looking at the assumed man, he tried to speak, but no words every made it out of his mouth. Mustering the courage to speak, his voice quivered with obvious fear. "Um... do you have any costumes left?"</br>
<br>The assumed man chuckled heartily, "Unfortunately young man, you came a little too late. I just finished selling my last costume to another boy not fifteen minutes ago. Sorry about that lad." He said, finishing with what sounded like a Scottish accent in the last word.</br>
<br>Kris, standing completely erect on his own two feet, looked directly at the person who had been speaking with him these past few minutes. The man was tall, standing nearly six feet and two inches. He was sporting a thick bit of stubble on his face, his chest and arms were packed with large muscles. His arms, hands and chest were dusted with a light dusting of brown hair. Kris simply thought to himself <em>man, this guy looks pretty rugged, but it also looks like he likes to keep his normal hair trimmed.</em></br>
<br>"Man... I don't think I am ever going to find a costume!" Kris said, a bit of disappointment in his voice.</br>
<br>The man looked at him and smiled, which Kris noticed was nice, but also a bit different than most. His bicuspids looked to be a bit sharper, pointier even. "Whatcha be needin a costume fer lad?" He said, a definite Scottish accent coming out now.</br>
<br>"Oh... there is a costume party for Halloween in a couple days and I just wanted to get a really good costume for it. I don't get invited to these things much since people think I will just dork it up... or something."</br>
<br>"Ach! Well... that is a down right shame... I do think I got something for you and it is something special that I don't give out freely. Now... you just have to make a decision there." The man behind the counter said.</br>
<br>"What kind of decision?" Kris asked cautiously, not sure what was going to happen next.</br>
<br>"Well... I have a kit back here with stuff in it to make you look like the perfect, scary, movie monster. The thing is ya hav'ta choose which one yoo ar gonna be." He said with a slight amount of excitement in his voice which Kris found to be a little odd.</br>
<br>"Umm... what are my choices?" Kris asked a bit more enthusiastically, knowing he was being offered something that would potentially make him known as the guy who didn't dork up the party.</br>
<br>"Well... ya have the option of being 'The Thing', 'The Creature from the Black Lagoon', 'The Mummy", 'Nosferatu or vampire' or my personal favorite a 'werewolf'." He said, his voice definitely peaked with enthusiasm at the last option.</br>
<br>"Um... I'm not sure which one to go with." Kris said while scratching his head. As he saw the shop keep about to speak, unsure of what would be said, Kris decided to ask a simple question. "So... Mr? Why is the werewolf your favorite?"</br>
<br>"Ah... that be a fine question lad... a fine question indeed! As ya can probably guess... I'm Scottish. Tha werewolf be part o'ma life, ma childhood! I canna tell ya how many stories, myth an' legend , I've been told over ma years o' childhood. Kinda hard not to fancy somethin' ya grew up hearin' about."</br>
<br>"Yeah..." Kris said pausing to find words. "...it'd be hard not to be unbiased towards what you grew up with."</br>
<br>"Aye, aye laddie... aye. So... what monster would ya like ta be fer Halloween?" He asked matter of factly.</br>
<br>Kris stood there for a second, thought about it while scratching his head. Kris knew he should decide somewhat quickly since his indecision could get the best of him. "I... I dunno. I guess I'll be..."</br></p>
