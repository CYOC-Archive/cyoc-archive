<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It took some convincing, but eventually, Rick gave in to Emily’s wish and spent the day as Ashley Prescott, Emily’s (new) twin sister. Emily immediately took Rick clothes shopping, the duo hitting up multiple stores and trying out a plethora of outfits. Emily started out with tops and pants before persuading Rick to try on dresses and skirts with her. As he tried on more and more, Rick began to enjoy the feeling of women&#39;s clothing on his soft skin, even loving how they made him look… cute? And beautiful? He quickly brushed those thoughts aside. Eventually, their shopping escapade came to an end and so would Rick’s time as Ashley. Well… it would’ve, if not for Emily asking Rick if he could stay as Ashley for a full week after she enjoyed their shopping trip so much. Rick begrudgingly agreed to Emily’s deal after she offered an entire week’s control of the camera, but on the inside, he was quite curious about what life would be like living as his girlfriend’s twin sister, let alone as a girl!<br />
<br />
Emily and Rick spent the entirety of Monday at their family’s home, going through old photos to see how their lives had changed in this new reality. From what they could tell, Emily and Ashley lived a fairly stereotypical life for identical twins. They shared similar interests, they would almost always dress the same and of course, they would sometimes prank people by switching places. Emily recalled often taking Ashley’s place at cheerleading practice while she took hers at soccer practice, fooling each of their teammates. Observing her family photos, Emily found it incredibly jarring to see them altered with an extra copy of herself spliced in. Rick felt the same too but for different reasons. He always had it tough growing up, never getting to do regular family stuff since his parents were always too busy with work, leaving him to his own devices. Seeing Ashley’s life, it was the complete opposite for Rick. Birthdays, school dances, summer holidays, each photo showed Ashley incredibly happy, often accompanied by Emily, her parents, or her plethora of friends. He could only dream of being able to experience that happiness.<br />
<br />
On Tuesday, Emily took Rick out to the movie theater to watch the latest chick flick. Rick normally hated going to see these with Emily, finding them too cheesy and repetitive, but as Ashley, he began to empathise with the female lead far more than he ever would as a man. By the end of the movie, Rick was crying watching her get together with her crush and finally kissing. Emily teased him about it for the rest of the day, but it left Rick wondering how much the camera was having an effect on him.<br />
<br />
For Wednesday, Emily had work so Rick was forced to spend the day with Olivia, Emily’s (and technically his) Mom. At first, Rick thought the day was gonna drag, having to tag along while Olivia ran errands at the mall. However, as the day went on, Rick found himself really enjoying spending time with Olivia and was relishing their “mother-daughter time”. Rick was never close with his own Mom, partly because he was a boy but mainly because she was never there for him. But Ashley was close with hers and Rick had a great time going clothes shopping with Olivia, trying on fancy dresses and treating themselves to sweet drinks. Rick genuinely thought of Olivia as his actual Mom… at least until Emily returned home and snapped him out of his funk. Was he actually starting to prefer Ashley’s life to his own?<br />
<br />
For the next day, Thursday, the sisters took a trip to the spa as it was something Rick always wanted to do but was too insecure to admit because of his masculinity. Stripping out of his clothes and into the spa robe, it was the first time Rick got to appreciate the body he was in. For most of the week, he had regarded it as Emily’s body, given that’s who he was transformed into originally. But now, Rick was beginning to think of it as his OWN body. He was getting used to having a smaller, daintier build, breasts hanging off his chest and appearing cute and feminine. As the day progressed Rick enjoyed the pampered and soothing feeling he received from having a massage, facial cleanse, manicure and pedicure, while Emily enjoyed being able to share the experience with a gal pal.<br />
<br />
Soon, Friday rolled around and ushered in the long weekend, which the two girls planned to take full advantage of by heading to the beach that day. After yesterday, Rick was feeling even more comfortable being Ashley and even chose to wear a bikini himself, much to Emily’s delight who was glad to see her boyfriend embrace the change. The twin sisters spent the day either lying on the beach relaxing or playfully splashing each other in the water. Emily even caught Rick staring at a few guys. Rick told her he was just looking forward to returning to manhood soon, but in truth, he got really flustered whenever he saw a good-looking man, even thinking of him as “hunky” in his mind. Rick would absentmindedly play with his hair or push his boobs up to create cleavage just to catch the man’s attention. He really was thinking and acting like a girl now.<br />
<br />
Finally on Saturday, after pestering him constantly throughout the week, Emily finally managed to convince Rick to go out clubbing with her that night. The two twins spent the afternoon getting themselves ready for their night out partying, with Rick even managing to do his own hair and makeup after a whole week living as Ashley. Once the girls arrived, the good times didn’t stop. Rick and Emily drank fruity cocktails, gossiped with some other girls and shook their asses on the dancefloor. Then, as the night rolled on, Rick and Emily were approached by two guys, each asking for a dance. Maybe it was because he was partly intoxicated, but Rick really liked the offer and said yes! Emily eagerly agreed too, and the four hit the dancefloor. Rick lost track of time dancing with the man, letting him take the lead while he would grind his plump ass against him. As the two got closer, their lips met and they shared a passionate kiss. Rick let the outside world fade away as he took in the pleasuring sensations, and it was here he made a decision. He didn’t want to be Rick anymore, SHE wanted to be Ashley. Forever. Ashley continued the lovemaking with her date, naturally progressing into making out. Glancing over to Emily, she saw her sister doing the exact same with her man, almost as if she had completely forgotten that Ashley was meant to be her boyfriend. Not that Ashley minded though, she led her date into the bathroom for something more… intimate. She didn’t want this night to end.<br />
<br />
But alas, it did. Ashley woke up late on Sunday morning. She knew Emily would come looking for her soon enough, ready to transform her back to Rick. Ashley didn’t want that though, going back to her life as a crummy, unhappy man was the last thing she wanted. She had to tell Emily how she felt.<br />
<br />
Right on cue, there was a knock on her door and Emily entered, camera in hand. “Good morning Ash! Or should I say Rick? We’ve reached the end of the week so you get to transform back now.”<br />
<br />
“Wait Em, before we do that there’s something I want to get off my chest first.” Ashley stated.<br />
<br />
Emily was a little surprised. “Oh. Sure, what is it?”<br />
<br />
Ashley sighed, then began. “This past week has been really eye-opening for me. Having to live as your twin sister has given me to opportunity to do some soul-searching and discover who I really am.” She took a pause before strongly stating, “Emily, I want to stay as Ashley.”<br />
<br />
“Wait, huh!?” Emily stood aghast as her double explained.<br />
<br />
“Living as a man, I was genuinely unhappy with where my life was going. Aside from spending time with you, I had almost nothing to look forward to and I felt lost. But living as Ashley has been the complete opposite. I’ve felt far more positive and confident in my appearance and emotional state. Your family is so loving and welcoming, I genuinely feel like they’re my own. And most of all, I’ve felt a much deeper connection with you, Em. Maybe it’s because I have the exact same body as you, but I feel like we have a far stronger relationship as sisters than as a couple. I really hope you can accept who I want to be.<br />
<br />
“Rick…” Emily muttered. She was on the verge of tears.</p>
