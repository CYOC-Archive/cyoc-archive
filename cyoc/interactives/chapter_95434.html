<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&#39;&#39;I wish you both turned into a cute lesbian couple&#39;&#39;<br />
Sarah and kelli looked at each other as they slowly stod back up, kelli then snuggled into sarah as sarah started stroking her hair gently &#39;&#39;Awww, you are so sweet kelli dear.&#39;&#39;<br />
Kelli blushed and hid her face in sarah&#39;s chest, i let out a sigh and looked over at them &#39;&#39;Now atleast that is worked out&#39;&#39; &#39;&#39;Now...seriously joe ? i heard your wish...&#39;&#39; sarah looked at me still stroking kelly<br />
&#39;&#39;Im sorry but i had to do something and you both look happier because of it&#39;&#39; Kelli looked at sarah then back at me &#39;&#39;i dont mind sarah cutie....i&#39;ve always love you but never really...had the courage to tell...&#39;&#39;<br />
Sarah sighed and kisses Kelli lovingly on her lips &#39;&#39;Awww....&#39;&#39; kelli blushed again. &#39;&#39;So...i guess i should...leave then&#39;&#39;<br />
i start slowly walking to the door as sarah grabs me by the shoulder and turns me around &#39;&#39;Not so fast, look, dont think we&#39;ve forgotten what happened thanks to you, i think you need to owe up&#39;&#39;<br />
Kelli nodded in approval &#39;&#39;im going to give you three choices okay ? and you have to pick one&#39;&#39; &#39;&#39;What ? no i...Fine whatever&#39;&#39;<br />
&#39;&#39;okay then, Number 1 joe, is turning back into my bra, seeing as that was your original wish i see no issue on why that would be a problem for you. Number 2 is turning into my and kelli&#39;s daughter. And the third option is Joining our little family, become our third girlfriend&#39;&#39;<br />
Kelli giggles &#39;&#39;Awww! you are so sneaky dear&#39;&#39; i took a deep breath and looked at Sarah&#39;&#39; okay fine, i pick....&#39;&#39; Not really wanting to be a baby but i cant say the idea didnt intrigue me i just dont want to go trough school and kindergarden again.<br />
&#39;&#39;i pick number 3 then, i dont really want to be a child again and while i would pick number 1....i dont think i should&#39;&#39; Sarah giggled &#39;&#39;Awww, arent you a girls best friend, how about this ? i&#39;ll turn you into a bra for a couple of months while me and kelli get to know each others again ?&#39;&#39; i nodded to that &#39;&#39;sure&#39;&#39; i handed the ring over to sarah who gently slid it on her fingers &#39;&#39;I wish joey would turn into a comfortable bra that would never get loose or destroyed, and could still hear, think and talk to the one wearing him&#39;&#39; I closed my eyes and i felt my whole body pushing away from itself, i then heard sarah&#39;s voice&#39;&#39; Hey ? Joey you okay ?&#39;&#39; &#39;&#39;Y-yeah..sorry im fine&#39;&#39; she smiled &#39;&#39;Good, how does it feel ? good i hope&#39;&#39; &#39;&#39;mhm, feels...like im usefull and fulfilling a purpose.&#39;&#39;<br />
<br />
The months came and passes as fast as they arrived, i guess being a bra i didnt have that good of a time concept but when i came back to myself i was sitting in kelli and sarah&#39;s Sofa, the two girls looked at me like they wanted me to speak &#39;&#39;Hey...? has it been six months already ?&#39;&#39; &#39;&#39;its only been four joe but we couldnt wait&#39;&#39;<br />
&#39;&#39;Oh ?&#39;&#39;  Sarah nodded &#39;&#39;Me and kelli just...we wanted to thank you really, you just one day stopped talking back to me and i couldnt ever hear you so we just thought you got really into it but lately you had been talking kinda weird so we turned you back sooner than what i said&#39;&#39;<br />
Kelli held around sarah&#39;s hand &#39;&#39;Yeah...we were worried joey and we....kinda wanted you to join us...&#39;&#39; <br />
Sarah giggled &#39;&#39;We also picked out something we think you might like so are you ready for this ?&#39;&#39; I gave her one last nod thinking about my old life.<br />
&#39;&#39;So here it goes, I wish joey would turn into a cute Latina woman in her 30&#39;s!&#39;&#39; <br />
As soon as i she spoke, my pale white skin changed to a gentle brown color, my short brown hair turned longer, shinier and and a bit wavy, my waist slimmed in and my hips turned wider aswell as my butt, i could also feel some huge press in my groin, i then felt almost like a sucking sensation as my penis slowly vanished leaving behind my new womanhood, my hair fell of my legs, arms, chest and face, then i could feel something pressing in my chest, i looked down and saw two mounds of flesh expanding outside, it kept growing and stopped at a decent D-cup, hanging down a bit, i could then feel my face cracking as it slowly changed into a femenine shape, last came Make-up.<br />
Sarah clapped her hands and kisses kelli on her lips &#39;&#39;oh! do the other thing aswell dear&#39;&#39; &#39;&#39;oh, right, your new name is Isabella and i wish you were wearing a cute dress and of course, that you were a lesbian aswell&#39;&#39;<br />
A nice and cute dress then wrapped around me, it fit perfectly and showed of my new assets quite nice.<br />
&#39;&#39;Oh my god, this feels...&#39;&#39; &#39;&#39;amazing ? i know&#39;&#39; sarah walked over to me and kissed my cheek, Kelli followed shortly after and did so aswell. <br />
it felt...strange when they kissed me, i did think sarah and kelli was cute before but now being kissed by them just felt that more right &#39;&#39;Welcome to our little family Isabella, just to make things a bit easier for you, let me do this. I wish that isabella loved me and kelli like we love her, i also wish she would be more femenine and happy with her adorable body.&#39;&#39;<br />
I let out a gentle sigh and a moan as i walked over to my girlfriends, they held out their arms and embraced me as i did them, i could feel their warm bodies pressing against me and in that instant, everything else didnt matter aslong as we had each other.<br />
And each other we had, for several years infact, i easily got work as a Model, mostly doing luxury design dresses and wedding dresses i of course got some help from Sarah, Kelli finished her college and started working as a lawyer and sarah decided to study up a bit more.<br />
We had our own little made up wedding ceremony, which went well, we are now officially married all three of us so thats just....i cannot belive how much my life has changed in just 3 years...i embraced my new life very quickly, i know its becase sarah&#39;s wish but i like to think its all my own doing...i didnt care that i was over 10 year older than kelli and sarah, infact, they seemed to like it even more than i did, i dont know, maybe the see me as more mature and ladylike ?. <br />
I lied down in the bed next to sarah and kelli, we all snuggled up togheter, had some well deserved fun before we fell asleep, then kissed each others goodnight as we drifted into sleep, my life was pretty much all set in place now, the stars had alligned and i was happy, we were even planning on getting a little baby, i could only dream for now but i know its going to happen some time....Oh! the ring ? i dont know...Sarah got rid of it, she said she wished it would be destroyed or something, im not really sure...not that i care, i got things in my life that matters, like being the best wifey for my wifeys, making sure we are all happy and being there for them when they need me...<br />
<br />
All in all, i can say...my life is amazing.</p>
