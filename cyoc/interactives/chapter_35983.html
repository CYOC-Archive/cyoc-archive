<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Mark was led away by Jack, he watched as his brother put the amulet around his and then tuck it under his shirt. Being led outside, he felt slightly ridiculous to be outside with out any clothes and the thought, &quot;It might be okay because of the fact that I'm a dog now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jack tied Mark up and said, &quot;Wait till I tell Tommy,&quot; and disappeared back into the house.<br />
<br />
He came out moments later and set a bowel of water and said, &quot;Easy girl, Tommy's bringing you some food at this moment.&quot; And once again reentered the house.<br />
<br />
&quot;Girl!?!&quot; Mark thought. &quot;You moron, I'm your brother, not your sister.&quot;<br />
<br />
Laying down, Mark waited patiently, trying to think of a way to reclaim the Amulet of Zulo, but nothing short of attacking Jack, which could get him sent to the pound, he couldn't come with anything.<br />
<br />
Presently, Jack came back out, this time with Tommy. Seeing Mark, his brothers friend handed the bowel of dog food he was carrying to Jack and rushed across the yard hollering, &quot;Amanda! Is that really you? I thought you were dead.&quot; And when he reached Mark, he threw his arms around the German Shepard the Mark had become.<br />
<br />
Turning to Jack, who had walked over and set the bowel down, Tommy asked &quot;How?&quot;<br />
<br />
Taking Tommy's arm, Jack removed the amulet from inside his shirt and showed it to his friend and then started to lead him back into the house, explaining all the way.<br />
<br />
But Mark was to busy to pay attention to this. The fact that Tommy had called him Amanda and the fact that his brother had called him girl was really starting to bother him. Under the guise of cleaning, he slowly began to lick himself, something that felt really good, and stopped in horror at what he encountered between his back legs.<br />
<br />
Or more appropriately, what was lacking there. Down there, Mark discovered that Tommy's dog was a bitch. Again, Mark started to run her tongue across her six erect teats and then down across her vulva, enjoying the feeling, Mark withdrew in horror and thought, &quot;Stop! I'm not a dog, let alone a bitch. I'm a human male. I'm sixteen years old.&quot;<br />
<br />
Burying her nose into the dog food and then the bowel of water Mark went back to trying to figure out a way out of this predicament.<br />
<br />
Presently Tommy came back out and untying Mark said, &quot;Okay, the agreement stands that I take Amanda and the Amulet of Zulo for three days. After three days, you take Amanda and the amulet back for three days. During those three days, each is aloud to chose their own transformation, correct? Is there any rules I should know about?&quot;<br />
<br />
Seeing his brother nodding in agreement and the hearing Jack say that there were no rules that he knew of, Mark whined and tried to pull her way back toward the house, but was unsuccessful.<br />
--------<br />
<br />
Mark was led to Tommy's home and then locked in with only a doggy door leading out to an enclosed backyard. Telling her, &quot;You be a good girl while I go and pick up a few things,&quot; Tommy disappeared out the front door.<br />
<br />
Wondering what Tommy's parent where going to say when they discovered Amanda live and well, Mark went up to Tommy's bedroom and pushing the door ajar, sniffed about and presently found a dog bed to lie down on.<br />
<br />
After a couple of hours, she heard the door slamming and footsteps coming up the stairs. Bursting through the door, Tommy greeted Mark and started dumping things out onto the bed and commented, &quot;Got a lot of good stuff from the local Salvation army and the Department store. Wonder what I should transform into. Good thing my parents wont be home for the weekend and I have the house to myself. Well, ourselves.&quot; Here he looked over at Mark.<br />
<br />
Tommy then spent the next hour going through the clothes, weighing the pros and the cons. After reducing the pile down to a dress for a pregnant woman, a pair of pink briefs for a little girl and and a pair of briefs for a little boy, all still with tags, he said, &quot;I guess I'll figure out after dinner.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dinner for Tommy was Mac and Cheese with hot dogs in it and a glass of soda. While Mark was given a bowel of canned dog food and a bowel of water. After dinner, Tommy returned to his room and as Mark wandered in Tommy announced, &quot;I'm going to see what it feels like to be pregnant for twelve hours. Just to see what my mom felt like before she had me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Taking the Amulet out, Mark could only watch hoping that her eyes and posture did not betray what she knew; that the amulet did not allow for pregnant people to change into someone or something else.<br />
<br />
A blue spark drew Marks attention back and he watched as Tommy began to change. His hair grew down past his shoulders. His shirt stretched outward into two B cups and the rest of his clothes grew baggy. Rushing to the bathroom, Mark could her him first retching in the toilet.<br />
<br />
Stumbling back into his, now her, room Tommy proceeded to undress. The strange thing was she didn't appear to be pregnant. Tommy stomach was completely and he commented on this out loud as one hand strayed down across his abdomen and then to his now flat and shaved crotch while the other gently cupped her right breast and started to massage the erect nipple.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wonder what went wrong?&quot; Tommy thought out loud. &quot;And why did I become sick as soon as the Amulet of Zulo changed me into a pregnant lady.&quot;<br />
<br />
Opening his closet, Tommy looked in the mirror and commented, &quot;And why do I look so young. I look like I'm about eighteen. About three years  older then I was, but still rather young. What do you think girl? Do you think I look young?&quot;<br />
<br />
The last question was addressed to Mark, who merely yawned and curled up on the doggy bed.<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess your right,&quot; Tommy began and then cupping a hand over her mouth ran for the bathroom. She didn't appear for another half hour and just as Mark was beginning to grow worried, Tommy strolled in wearing a bathrobe and eating what smelled like pickles, anchovies and ice cream.<br />
<br />
Seeing Mark looking at her Tommy snapped, &quot;What!?! I'm hungry! Okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
If mark could laugh, he would. Presently Tommy finished her snack and commenting, &quot;I'll be glad when this twelve hours is up,&quot; climbed into bed.<br />
<br />
As soon as she was sure her owner was asleep, Mark rose and nosing about found where Tommy had dropped the amulet. Nosing about some more, he eventually found the little girl underwear. Figuring at least she would be human again, Mark took the Amulet of Zulo and the underwear out through the doggy door.<br />
<br />
Outside, the night air was nice and cool. Seeing a dog house on one end of the yard, Mark trotted over to it and setting the amulet and the underwear down in back, laid down in front of it and waited for the end of the twelve hours and the time when she could plan revenge on Jack for getting her into this predicament. Silently laughing at the trouble Tommy had landed in, Mark drift off to sleep.</p>
