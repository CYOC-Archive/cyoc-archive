<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After being inside for a bit, both girls couldn&#39;t wait to completely disrobe and resume their fursonas.<br />
It was a race to get undressed and go furry, which ended in a tie, considering both Frieda Knight and Spencer Lawson spent more time watching the other strip and tease their companion than actually try to win the friendly competition.<br />
Whatever might have been on their agendas next was interrupted by Spencer&#39;s father asking about the status of their homework, and whether or not Frieda would be staying for dinner.<br />
Frieda was planning to eat there, if it was okay with everyone else, although there was one thing she wanted that was probably not on the menu, as she glanced toward Spencer and smiled, with her tongue teasingly licking the lips of her auburn furred werepanthress muzzle.<br />
A smile formed on the muzzle of the black furred werewolf/cat/panthress hybrid mix, as the green eyes of both girls briefly flashed at each other, but then Spencer and Frieda settled down in the living room and started tackling their homework together, despite the fact that Spencer was a Junior and Frieda a Sophomore.<br />
A little over an hour later, most of it was done, when a familiar noise started being heard through the Lawson house.<br />
&quot;Okay Junior, I&#39;m coming,&quot; called out Evan Lawson, as he came out of the kitchen. The man was now in his full werewolf fursona, wearing an apron that said KISS THE COOK while carrying a baby monitor in one paw.<br />
&quot;We have it dad,&quot; said Spencer, getting up off the couch.<br />
&quot;You sure girls?&quot; her father asked, even as Frieda rose to join Spencer.<br />
&quot;No problem Mister Lawson. Just leave it in our paws while you take care of dinner. Don&#39;t want those steaks to burn,&quot; said Frieda, smelling the tantalizing aroma coming from the kitchen.<br />
&quot;Thanks,&quot; said Evan, turning to head back to his other work.<br />
<br />
UPSTAIRS AND ONE DIAPER CHANGE LATER...<br />
&quot;There you are kiddo. All better,&quot; cooed Spencer, while walking around with her newborn baby brother in her furry arms.<br />
&quot;Do you think he&#39;s hungry?&quot; wondered Frieda.<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t know. Mom has a few bottles stashed in that mini-fridge. Can you get one please?&quot;<br />
Soon Spencer was sitting in her mother&#39;s rocking chair, feeding her brother as Frieda looked on.<br />
&quot;You do that so naturally,&quot; commented Frieda.<br />
&quot;Yeah. One of the many things I&#39;ve discovered has changed for the better since you, me, and Eric have gotten together.&quot;<br />
&quot;What else?&quot; asked Frieda, curiously.<br />
&quot;Before you entered our lives, I was already starting to feel that my life should be more than what it was. Before I met Eric, I usually hung out with the wrong crowd and did stuff that nowadays I ain&#39;t too proud of. Part of which is why I&#39;m only a Junior this year. I screwed up my life enough to be held back a grade before we moved to Moon Lake. Not any more,&quot; swore Spencer. &quot;My love for Eric started me on a different path. You entering the picture sped up the process and made me want to be even better than I was originally trying to strive for.&quot;<br />
&quot;So, you were a bad girl?&quot; asked Frieda, sitting on the floor near the rocker.<br />
&quot;Emphasis on was, except in bed with you and Eric,&quot; replied Spencer with a smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you think about the future sometimes?&quot;<br />
&quot;More than I used to,&quot; admitted Spencer. &quot;In the past, I was far more self centered than I am now. Then my only concerns were just basic things like when and what my next meal would be. Who I might be going out with, let alone fucking next. Stuff like that. Now,&quot; and then Spencer paused to look down at her baby brother. &quot;Now my concerns seem to be more maternal.&quot;<br />
&quot;How so?&quot; wondered Frieda.<br />
&quot;Since I care about you two so much, I worry more about you and Eric than I ever worried about anyone else, let alone myself. Besides being my lovers, you&#39;re the most important people in my life, next to my family.&quot;<br />
&quot;Speaking of which,&quot; began Frieda, while getting up and walking behind the rocker. &quot;Have you had any more prophecy dreams about our futures?&quot; she asked, while reaching over the rocker to start massaging Spencer&#39;s shoulders. &quot;Because I haven&#39;t beyond the one we already shared, although I&#39;ve yet to have a chance to ask Eric.&quot;<br />
&quot;Only in recalling and thinking about what we already know. That I&#39;ll be the one who <i>legally</i> marries Eric, although in my heart I consider myself both Mrs. Spencer Anderson <i>and</i> Mrs. Spencer Knight,&quot; replied Spencer, while looking up at her girlfriend and co-lover of Eric.<br />
&quot;Yeah. The law&#39;s unfair in that respect,&quot; agreed Frieda. &quot;I think of myself as both Mrs. Frieda Anderson <i>and</i> Mrs. Frieda Lawson. But while our were-wedding recognized and strengthened the union between all three of us, only two can legally get married. That leaves one of us out in the cold, so to speak.&quot;<br />
&quot;You know that&#39;s only as far as the world&#39;s concerned,&quot; Spencer reminded Frieda, before craning her head up and kissing her the best she could while holding onto the baby. &quot;If they&#39;re not ready for weres, they&#39;re certainly not ready to legalize poly-relationships like ours. But regardless of what some piece of paper says, the three of us will live happily ever after, sharing our lives and love with each other.&quot;<br />
&quot;I know,&quot; said Frieda, looking down at Spencer. &quot;I wasn&#39;t kidding when I called us Yin, Yang, and Whole. The nicknames are not just because of our respective fur colors. You and Eric complete me in ways I didn&#39;t even know I was short changed on until you entered my life.&quot;<br />
&quot;And you, us,&quot; Spencer pointed out to her, as Frieda continued to massage Spencer&#39;s shoulders.<br />
<br />
DOWNSTAIRS...<br />
&quot;Honey?&quot; Maggie Lawson said, entering the kitchen, carrying two handfuls of grocery bags with her. &quot;Didn&#39;t you hear me pull in, let alone enter the house?&quot; she asked.<br />
Then she noticed that her husband had stopped just about everything he was doing and was concentrating upon the baby monitor. &quot;Is everything all right?&quot;<br />
&quot;Perfect,&quot; he said, turning around to give his wife a loving hug and kiss.<br />
&quot;Do you have any more?&quot; Evan asked, when their lips parted.<br />
&quot;No,&quot; replied Maggie, sitting everything down on the kitchen table.<br />
&quot;Okay. Why don&#39;t you go upstairs for a bit. Frieda and Spencer are in the nursery. You can say hi to them and Junior, then tell the girls it&#39;s time to get ready for dinner.&quot;<br />
&quot;Sure,&quot; said Maggie, kissing her werewolf husband on the tip of his muzzle before turning to leave the kitchen.<br />
<br />
BACK UPSTAIRS IN THE NURSERY...<br />
&quot;He&#39;s a cute kid,&quot; Frieda said, looking at Evan Junior continue to nurse his bottle.<br />
&quot;Cute? He&#39;s beautiful. He&#39;s a Lawson,&quot; said Spencer proudly. &quot;Someday he&#39;ll be a big, strong werewolf/cat/panther hybrid too.&quot;<br />
&quot;Just like his big sister,&quot; said Frieda, before kissing the top of Spencer&#39;s head. &quot;Do you think we&#39;ll have more than just the two girls our dreams showed us with?&quot;<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t see why not. The dreams said we&#39;ll only be 25 when we give birth to the first Anderson-Knight-Lawson offspring, and considering how old weres live...&quot; to which the other girl nodded her head in agreement.<br />
&quot;Despite having you and Eric in my life to love and lean on, there are times when I wish I was as strong and as confident as you two,&quot; confessed Frieda.<br />
&quot;Oh?&quot; said Spencer, turning her head to look at the werepanthress.<br />
&quot;Eric said he plans some kind of career in the sciences when he graduates college.&quot;<br />
&quot;And neither of us were expecting him to make such a <i>Quantum Leap</i> grade wise, over the course of this summer,&quot; pointed out Spencer. &quot;Our boyfriend will be graduating before me now.&quot;<br />
&quot;And me. You still planning to enter the Police Academy after high school?&quot; asked Frieda.<br />
&quot;Yeah. I had originally given some serious thought to being a soldier like my dad, but since you and Eric entered my life, I can&#39;t picture myself being away from either of you or Moon Lake for too long, so entering local law enforcement seemed the next best thing.&quot;<br />
&quot;I wish I knew for sure what I wanted to do after high school,&quot; admitted Frieda. &quot;Sure, I&#39;ll definitely take some business courses to manage not only our financial affairs, but those of my father&#39;s as well when I start taking over Knight Industries, and the Elders are expecting me to become the werepanther representative when I turn 21; but there&#39;s got to be more to life than just what others expect me to do.&quot;<br />
&quot;There is,&quot; said Spencer, as she burped the baby.<br />
<br />
Then Spencer got up and placed Evan Junior back in his crib. The infant, happy and content with a full tummy and a fresh diaper, started drifting off to sleep again.<br />
With that, Spencer turned to look at her girlfriend, two pairs of green eyes staring intently at each other.<br />
&quot;You are Frieda Allison Knight-Lawson-Anderson; or however you care to hyphenate that,&quot; she said. &quot;You can be anything you want to be in this world. But always remember that the most important thing you are, is loved.&quot;<br />
With that, Spencer gently wrapped her arms around Frieda as the werepanthress began to cry.<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t cry darling,&quot; purred Spencer, as she started trying to brush Frieda&#39;s tears away.<br />
&quot;They&#39;re tears of joy. You and Eric make me so happy...&quot;<br />
The ladies kissed.<br />
Tenderly, lovingly, like dear romantic partners should.<br />
But then the passion started building and threatened to overtake them when Maggie Lawson entered the room.<br />
&quot;Thanks for taking care of Junior for me girls,&quot; said Maggie, walking over to the crib and not caring that they were hugging and kissing each other. &quot;But Evan says it&#39;s time to wash up and get ready for dinner.&quot;<br />
&quot;We&#39;ll get right on that mom,&quot; promised Spencer, even as she grabbed Frieda&#39;s paw in hers and started to walk out of the nursery.<br />
&quot;Later,&quot; Spencer whispered in Frieda&#39;s ear, as they left the room.<br />
<br />
Alone, Maggie Lawson looked down and stared at her sleeping infant.<br />
Then something struck her as odd.<br />
Despite still being in her human form at the moment, she sniffed the air and then realized what it was.<br />
<i>I don&#39;t smell that aphrodisiac scent that usually comes from them. Guess it requires all three of them, furry and aroused, to make it. I wonder why?</i><br />
Unable to come up with an answer, Maggie Lawson leaned over long enough to kiss her son, then turned to join the others for dinner.</p>
