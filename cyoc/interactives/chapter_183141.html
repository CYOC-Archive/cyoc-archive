<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>little bit of body confusion and mindfuck mixed in, enjoy.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Tormented as you were, you tried to keep up hope. If you persisted long enough, you told yourself, there had to be some way out of this. You could figure out a way to escape, or get back in control. You kept repeating that mantra to yourself. Though, it was going to be difficult to manage anything.<br />
<br />
You only had your head, after all.<br />
<br />
You felt your body move around frequently, sometimes noticing it sit, other times lying down. Occasionally it would comment and talk to you, treating you almost like a pet. More disturbing though, it would sometimes scratch around your face, like it had an itchy crotch. Not even being able to communicate, you felt more and more like you were treated as a body part.<br />
<br />
Still, you were determined to somehow get free.<br />
<br />
Until, a few hours later.<br />
<br />
You had fallen asleep again, and woke to notice the air around your head felt different on your skin. Attempting to turn from left to right, you could barely feel yourself move anymore. Something had changed! Your face felt ... looser, softer, and then you heard your body speak.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, you&#39;ve changed,&quot; he said. &quot;Just in time, I kinda need to use the bathroom. I mean, I could pee through my head, but I don&#39;t want to steal your thunder.&quot; There was a chuckle. &quot;You&#39;ll love it. Guess you don&#39;t need a way to hear anything now, though.&quot;<br />
<br />
You felt a grip on the ear, your one remaining sense other than touch, and then your body was slicing it off. Following that, footsteps, and then fingers, a hand. The hand felt larger than what it should have been, but you quickly guessed it was just that your &#39;head&#39; was smaller. Gripping underneath what would have been your chin and cheeks, you felt the fingers brushing a sac with a pair of soft orbs in it, instead.<br />
<br />
Balls!<br />
<br />
The other hand was sliding around a dangling piece of flesh that had replaced your nose, and your final realisation hit. You had become the organ you were in the place of! You WERE the cock, but a secondary one to the body-controlling dominant one on your shoulders.<br />
<br />
A relaxing feel ran through you, and you felt the gentle thrum of pressure as muscles connected to you squeezed, and urine poured out of the fleshy protruding appendage that was part of your &#39;face&#39;. Wiping the tip of your &#39;nose&#39;, your body pulled up its pants and was moving off again.<br />
<br />
You couldn&#39;t believe it, you had been reduced further, now literally a body part, not even your own head!<br />
<br />
A sentient body part, and the very same one that you lost your body to.<br />
<br />
But wait! That was when something happened that gave you a glimmer of hope.<br />
<br />
In your mind, such as it was, you began to hear ... a sound, like another person speaking.<br />
<br />
You realised it was the thoughts of your body, in a distant inner monologue.<br />
<br />
At first quiet, they gradually got louder, more distinct, easier to make out. At the same time, the new situation started to make sense. Why was this happening? Well, you were BOTH cocks, after all! The one in charge of your body didn&#39;t have any interest of being a regular person -- it had clearly rejected the idea of having a human head, after all -- and it just wanted to be a dick piloting a body.<br />
<br />
Most of its thoughts were pretty basic, about things that made it feel good, wanting to fuck ... but it was also thinking about other changes the sword&#39;s magic had apparently made to its dick-head. Even after giving itself the senses from your former face -- your eyes, mouth, ears -- those physical features had apparently dissolved away in the last hour or so, but somehow it kept the ability to see, speak, and hear. The monologue of thoughts was reasoning that it must be because a cock doesn&#39;t have a face, because it&#39;s a cock ... but ... since it was serving as your body&#39;s head, it was magically given use of the senses anyway? None of this made real sense to you, but one thing was clear.<br />
<br />
Focusing really hard, you were able to actually influence your stolen body&#39;s mind!<br />
<br />
With a lot of effort, you could cling onto the thoughts and drag your consciousness closer to the source. It was like climbing a mountain, but the cock in charge didn&#39;t even seem to notice you were doing it! Feeling a brief flicker of sensation from the body made you redouble your attempts, and you found that immersing yourself in the feelings, the sensations, made it easier.<br />
<br />
You could do it by stealth! Take back control!<br />
<br />
Wrapping your tiny-cock-mind in the larger swirling fog, you bathed in it, rolled around in it, and tried to grab the reins. You wanted your body back! You wanted to fix this big mess!<br />
<br />
You could feel yourself getting closer and closer, as you wallowed in the sea of cock-related thoughts. You just had to make it to the end, so you could undo this farce.<br />
<br />
With a final push, you grabbed tightly onto the sense of taking charge, pulling your mind into the position of power, and ...<br />
<br />
... with a strange CLICK ...<br />
<br />
... you felt your identity move, and ...<br />
<br />
... there was sensation again!<br />
<br />
Your body was ... yours?!<br />
<br />
Was it really true?<br />
<br />
Had it actually happened?<br />
<br />
You had to make sure the magic hadn&#39;t changed anything else, fucked with your family, your history, or your life.<br />
<br />
Were you actually back to being &#39;you&#39;?!<br />
<br />
You could see, though it didn&#39;t feel like you had any eyes, but you remembered that was the reality of being in this body. Shocked, you came to your feet and began to stumble through your house, the unfamiliar feeling of your alien body making the movement awkward and strange. Looking for a mirror to check yourself out in, to make sure you were okay, you paused in your hallway, spying some photos of yourself with family and friends from when you were younger, and you stopped to examine them.<br />
<br />
There was one from when you were eleven at the beach, and it had a barechested you, with a much smaller dick-head, your undescended balls drawn up closer to your body. Then another from when you were sixteen, hanging out at school, your best friend leaning on your shoulder, your much longer and thicker teenage dick-head half-hard in excitement.<br />
<br />
Satisfied everything seemed fine, you hurried on, heading to your bedroom. At least the sword&#39;s magic hadn&#39;t done anything to mess with your past! Thank god, your younger years appeared the same as always.<br />
<br />
Finally, you got to the big mirror over your dresser and took a look at your reflection, eager to make sure you were okay, your hands rising to touch and make sure everything was in the right place.<br />
<br />
Your male body stared back at you, normal and unharmed. Your hands slid along either side of your flesh, feeling the reassuring thickness of your shaft, from where it pushed out of your shoulders and curved forward. It swelled slightly in gratitude, lifting off where it lay on the cushion of your balls, over your chest. Stroking, you ran a hand along to pet your foreskin, lovingly scrunching the skin up like you were comforting a frightened pet. You were back to being you! You weren&#39;t sure what had just happened, but messing with that sword had made you believe that you had lost control of your body, that you were NOT actually dick-headed!<br />
<br />
There was even a faint voice in the back of your mind, shout-whispering that you had to wake up. It kept going on, desperately begging to believe it, that you were meant to have a &#39;real&#39; human head, a &#39;normal&#39; face, a different past!<br />
<br />
It was ridiculous, crazy even, so you neglected to listen.<br />
<br />
Everyone knew you were dick-headed. You&#39;d been born that way, after all. Sure, you were a bit different from other guys, but you didn&#39;t care. You liked how you were.<br />
<br />
The voice continued to yell, frantically whimpering that you were strange and freakish, and you&#39;d made a huge mistake and been duped, that your life wasn&#39;t real.<br />
<br />
You didn&#39;t pay any attention to it. Your mind was wandering, and you were thinking that maybe you could use the sword to play with those female legs again, or swap back to feet-hands. They had been a lot of fun. You ran your fingers back up your shaft, feeling it begin to properly thicken and rise in the air, admiring the masculine girth. You were lucky, in honesty.<br />
<br />
After all, you thought, with some anticipation as you squeezed the log of dick-flesh hardening above your shoulders, ignoring the distraught voice in the back of your mind that was quietly screaming about how wrong this was, not many guys were able to jerk off their own head.</p>
