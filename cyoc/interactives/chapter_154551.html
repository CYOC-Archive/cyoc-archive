<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“I’ll do it” Dan said.<br />
<br />
He carefully walked towards the idol. He reached his hand and he picked it up. After a few seconds nothing happened so there were no traps. He walked back to Amy and looked at the idol. <br />
<br />
It was in the shape of a person and was made of pure emerald. It shined under the flashlight. <br />
<br />
As Dan was looking at the idol, Amy noticed he looked different. She walked upto him and sure enough he was taller. Dan was atleast 8ft tall now.<br />
<br />
“Holy shit Dan, you’re growing!” Amy said. Dan looked down and saw he had.<br />
<br />
“This must be the artifacts power the legend said about.” Dan said.<br />
<br />
His clothes got tighter on him and started ripping off, his shirt tore off and then his pants. Soon his underwear also ripped off, leaving him completely naked.<br />
<br />
Amy was in complete awe of her giant husband. He completely towered over her yet he wasn’t done growing.<br />
<br />
Dans head soon reached the roof of the cave so he had to sit down. But even so, he started getting cramped again. Amy realized he was too big to get out and would soon crush her. She tried to make a getaway but he had already blocked the exit.<br />
<br />
As Dan grew, Amy got caught under his dick. Now she was completely stuck. Dan had out grown the cave but his growth was far from over. <br />
<br />
<br />
On a small hill was a young photographer named Ellen who had come to take pictures of the landscape for her work.<br />
<br />
While she was snapping pictures, she felt a larger rumble. She looked over at the largest mountain in Tibet. It was shaking. It looked like it was going to erupt but she knew it wasn’t a volcano. <br />
<br />
Suddenly, giant body parts came out of the mountain. Fist two giant legs. Then in between them came a large penis. Next the top of the mountain was completely destroyed as the upper body of a man rose through it. He looked much older than Ellen.<br />
<br />
She was in complete shock. He was so big. The tress at the foot of the mountain were like grass to him. He could crush entire cities. Ellen knew she had to take pictures so she started snapping a few. This would definitely get her a bonus at work. <br />
<br />
<br />
Amy had managed not to crushed by Dans giant dick. She managed to get on his crotch before he had broken through the mountain. He was so big. Amy could have walked on his dick and reach the tip in 2 hours if she ran.<br />
<br />
Dan didn’t realize Amy was there. He shouted her name. Amy called back and somehow he heard her. He looked down and saw a small speck on his penis. He placed his hand on it and let Amy climb onto it. He then brought her to his face.<br />
<br />
“Dan, you’re huge!” Amy said “How did this even happen? <br />
<br />
“It must have been the artifact that made me grow. Im not really complaining though, this is really cool.”<br />
<br />
“This is not cool, you can’t stay a giant forever” <br />
<br />
“Yeah I guess you’re right. But I want to stay big just for a while longer”<br />
<br />
“How do we even shrink you?” Amy said.<br />
<br />
“There is another legend of people who could grow to gigantic sizes, maybe I gained the power as well.” Dan said. “Here, let me try getting out of this mountain.”<br />
<br />
<br />
As Ellen was taking pictures, sometimes else happened. The giant man started growing again. Ellen watched as more of the mountain got destroyed as his body expanded. Ellen was scared he would crush her too but his growth stopped once he was free from the mountain.<br />
<br />
He stood up and started walking towards where Ellen was. She panicked and started running away, leaving her equipment behind. As his foot was about to fall on Ellen, she barely managed to get away. He had completely flattened everything, including the hill. Ellen kept running until she knew she was safe.<br />
<br />
<br />
“I thought you’d shrink down, not grow bigger.” Amy said. “Stop somewhere before you cause too much damage to the land.<br />
<br />
Dan stopped and looked around for a spot to stop. He saw a lake nearby so he went and laid down next to it.<br />
<br />
Dan placed Amy on his chest and continued talking. <br />
<br />
“Dan, you should really start shrinking soon, what if people start catching wind about a giant the size of a mountain?”<br />
<br />
“At this point, I’m bigger than all the mountains.”<br />
<br />
“Being this big is making me hard, I need to relieve myself” Dan said.<br />
<br />
He reach for his dick and started stroking it up and down. He finally came and a flood of semen shot out. Most of the trees got covered in it and it looked like it snowed.<br />
<br />
“Dan you should really be more careful” Amy said.<br />
<br />
“Ok fine, I’ll shrink back in a while”</p>
