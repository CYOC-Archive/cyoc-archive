<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As the scouts all exited the bus, they were divided into their troops by the counselors and assigned a campsite. One of these troops, Troop 490, was assigned a campsite that the counselors referred to as “Wolf Woods”. Once they were assigned their campsite, the group of 25 boys gathered their belongings, waved goodbye to their counselor for the time being, and began their hike. <br />
<br />
The hike to the campsite took the troop about half an hour. By the time they reached the campsite, the boys worked as quickly and efficiently as they could to set the five tents up. <br />
<br />
By the time the tents were set up, it was beginning to get dark. The boys began to cook their dinners over a fire pit that the older scouts had set up. Once they finished their dinners, they started making s’mores and singing various campfire songs before they finally decided to turn in for the night. The older scouts doused the fire before everyone climbed into a tent, each on fitting five people. Before long, all 25 of them were fast asleep, completely oblivious to what the forest had planned for their troop and the rest of the scouts within it. <br />
<br />
It was about midnight when a 10 year old named Nate woke up. The young scout shifted uncomfortably in his sleeping bag as he realized that he has to use the bathroom. Sitting up, the scout looked at the sleeping figures of the other four boys in his tent: a 9 year old named Harry, a 10 year old named Alex, 12 year old named Ben, a 15 year old named James. He didn’t want to disturb them, so he quickly and quietly unzipped his sleeping bag and maneuvered around his tent mates before unzipping the tent and stepping outside into the cool summer night. <br />
<br />
Nate shivered for a brief second since he was only in his underwear. Usually he slept in pajamas and he had brought a few pairs for the trip. But when James and Ben said that they only slept in underwear, Harry and Alex both wanted to sleep in their underwear as well so they wouldn’t be viewed as “little kids”. Nate didn’t want to be the only one wearing pajamas, so he reluctantly agreed to do the same. The 10 year old still wasn’t very comfortable with the idea of sleeping mostly naked with a bunch of other guys, even if they had all known each other for over a year. <br />
<br />
Nate quickly made his way deeper into the forest until he felt like he was a good distance away from the campsite. He looked around, making sure nothing was there, before he pulled down his boxers and exposed his small 1.5 inch penis to the air. He quickly began to relieve himself, letting out a sigh as the last of the urine flow came out. <br />
<br />
As he was about to pull up his boxers, a strange feeling washed over Nate’s body. He wasn’t exactly sure why, but his penis suddenly felt...strange. Looking down, the 10 year old was confused to see that his penis was now stiff and stood up straight. <br />
<br />
Nate wasn’t sure what was going on, as he hadn’t had an erection before. Slowly, he reached his hand down and felt his member before quickly recoiling from the foreign sensation that he felt. For whatever reason though, Nate wanted to feel it again. He grasped his hand around his now 3 inch penis and began to move it up and down. The 10 year old let out a moan as his boxers fell down to his ankles, making his knees feel weak. Turning around, the boy leaned his back against a tree before sitting down and resuming. <br />
<br />
The 10 year old boy was so lost in a world of pleasure that he was unaware of the pair of eyes watching him from within the bushes. It wasn’t until he heard the leaves rustle that Nate froze, clenching his eyes shut.<br />
<br />
“I-I’m sorry James!” Nate said, assuming that the older scout had caught him. “I had to go to the bathroom, but then something happened and my penis felt weird! I didn’t want to, but I started rubbing it. Please don’t tell!” <br />
<br />
When he got no response, Nate curiously opened his eyes. Standing in front of him was a large gray wolf. The creature didn’t move a muscle as it stared into Nate’s eyes. <br />
<br />
The boy didn’t move an inch. He knew that if he tried to move, it might attack him. The wolf took a step forward, and Nate tried to scoot away, only to realize that his back was against the tree. The wolf moved closer until it’s face was only an inch or so away from the boy’s. The wolf then broke eye contact with Nate, now looking at the 10 year old’s erect member. Nate wasn’t sure how to react when he watched the wolf move its head down and begin to lick the boy’s member. <br />
<br />
Nate whimpered as he felt the canine’s tongue tease his sensitive member. He tried to tell himself to push the wolf away, but his arms weren’t responding. As the wolf began to rim the boy’s asshole, Nate let out a soft moan of pleasure, giving in to the lust. The wolf, noticing the boy’s lack of resistance, stopped teasing the boy and presented his large red canine member. Without hesitation, the 10 year old took the canine dick in his mouth and began to suck, unaware of how his body was slowly beginning to change.</p>
