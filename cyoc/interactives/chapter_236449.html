<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeremy wandered along the beach, the lingering heat of the bonfire on his back as he scanned the crowd for new faces. He’d tried his luck with Alec earlier, but that had fizzled out after Alec stopped things before they got too far. A shame, but Jeremy wasn’t one to dwell. He had options, after all.<br />
<br />
As he glanced around, he noticed a guy leaning against a palm tree on the edge of the party. He’d seen him around campus—a quiet, bookish guy who usually kept to himself. Grant, if memory served. They took a class together in sophomore year, but they’d never fully interacted before. Tonight, though, something about him seemed… different. His frame looked broader, his stance more confident, and there was a flicker of something in his eyes that caught Jeremy’s attention.<br />
<br />
Grinning, Jeremy made his way over. “Hey,” he said casually, leaning up against the same tree. “You look like you could use some company. Been at the party long?”<br />
<br />
Grant glanced at him, his gaze distant momentarily before sharpening with recognition. “Jeremy, right? Seen you around campus,” he said, his voice deeper than Jeremy remembered. “We had that one class together, right?” He flexed his fingers absentmindedly, like they were itching, his hand visibly larger than earlier in the night.<br />
<br />
Jeremy raised an eyebrow. “Yeah, I’ve seen you around too. But I don’t think we’ve ever really… met.” He glanced over Grant again, trying to shake the strange feeling in his gut. Was Grant always this… big? His shoulders looked broader, his chest stretching the fabric of his shirt. For a second, Jeremy could have sworn he saw a thin tufted tail flick out from behind the man’s leg. Or was that just his imagination?<br />
 <br />
“Guess we haven’t,” Grant said with a shrug, taking a swig of his beer. His movements seemed more fluid now, more… confident. “Funny how you see someone all the time, and then one day, you just…” He trailed off, frowning as if he was forgetting something. “Well, whatever.”<br />
<br />
Jeremy chuckled, brushing off the odd feeling. “Yeah, funny how that works. You, uh… work out or something? You’re looking pretty good.”<br />
Grant blinked, his brow furrowing slightly as he processed the question. “Yeah, actually. Been hitting the gym more lately. Feels like something I’ve always done, you know?” His voice wavered just a touch, but the hint of confidence was there.<br />
<br />
Jeremy tilted his head, unsure. He could’ve sworn Grant was one of those quiet nerdy types who spent most of his time in the library, but now… he just seemed different. Bigger. Stronger. Hotter, if Jeremy was being honest. His eyes flicked to the faint dark stubble on Grant’s face. No, not stubble—fur.<br />
<br />
“So,” Jeremy leaned in closer, letting his voice drop lower, more flirtatious, “You’re not one of those guys who comes to a party and just stands in the corner, right? You know how to have a good time?”<br />
<br />
Grant hesitated for a moment, the confidence flickering like a candle in the wind. “Uh, I mean… I can have a good time,” he said, his voice softer. “I just… didn’t think I’d be the kind of guy to be noticed by someone…”<br />
<br />
“Oh, I notice,” Jeremy said, his gaze steady, taking control of the conversation. He wasn’t shy about what he wanted. “Especially now.”<br />
Grant blinked, looking a little unsure but intrigued. “Now?”<br />
<br />
Jeremy stepped closer, making sure their arms brushed. “You’ve got this whole new vibe going on. You’re… different. Bigger. It suits you.” <br />
Grant’s expression faltered for a second, as if he were trying to make sense of it, but then he grinned, his confidence beginning to grow. “Yeah? Maybe it’s the party.” <br />
<br />
“Or maybe it’s you,” Jeremy said, his voice dipping low. He reached out, resting a hand on Grant’s shoulder, fingers lightly brushing against the growing muscle there. Everyone knew Jeremy wasn’t one to shy away from a hookup, and tonight was no different, but there was something about Grant—something that made him want to push further. Neither of them seemed to notice their feet beginning to reshape, sharp claws forming at the tips of their toes as more fur began to spread across their bodies. <br />
<br />
Grant looked down at the hand on his shoulder, a flicker of confusion crossing his features. Jeremy didn’t give him time to think too much. He slid his hand down Grant’s arm, claws tracing the edge of his shirt, which felt snug against his chest.<br />
<br />
“You don’t usually come to these things, do you?” Jeremy asked, keeping his voice casual as he leaned in closer, taking charge of the space between them. “You don’t seem like the party type.”<br />
<br />
Grant shook his head slowly, his voice a bit timid. “No, not really. But tonight just… felt different. I don’t know.”<br />
<br />
Jeremy tilted his head, his eyes locking with Grant’s. “Well, I’m glad you showed up. Makes things a lot more interesting.”<br />
<br />
Grant swallowed hard, the slight hesitation in his movements giving Jeremy all the confirmation he needed. Jeremy was used to being the one in control, and tonight would be no exception. “You’re not nervous, are you?” Jeremy teased, his voice playful but challenging.<br />
<br />
“Nervous? No,” Grant replied, his voice sounding a little deeper, more sure of himself now, but there was still that flicker of uncertainty behind his eyes.<br />
<br />
“Good,” Jeremy said, stepping even closer until there was barely any space between them. “Because I don’t bite… much.”<br />
<br />
Grant chuckled nervously, though it came out rough, like a low growl. His eyes flickered with something animalistic for just a moment, but neither of them seemed to care. If anything, it felt right.<br />
<br />
Jeremy leaned in, pressing his lips against Grant’s, taking control of the kiss. He felt Grant stiffen slightly, surprised, but Jeremy kept the pressure steady, guiding him through it. The kiss was intense, but not rushed, like Jeremy knew exactly what he wanted and how to get it.<br />
Grant responded after a moment, relaxing into it, his hands instinctively moving to Jeremy’s waist. Jeremy grinned against Grant’s lips, feeling the heat between them rising, the other man’s tongue rubbing against his large front teeth. He pressed closer, deepening the kiss, his fingers tangling in Grant’s hair—was it thicker than before? He barely registered the thought before it slipped away, too focused on the moment.<br />
<br />
Grant’s hands tightened around Jeremy’s waist, pulling him in, but Jeremy wasn’t about to give up control. He shifted slightly, pressing Grant back until his broad shoulders hit the tree behind him. Grant blinked, looking momentarily confused at how easily Jeremy was taking the lead despite being smaller, but Jeremy didn’t let up. He liked being the one calling the shots, and tonight was no exception.<br />
<br />
“You good?” Jeremy asked, pulling back just enough to catch his breath, his hand still resting on Grant’s chest.<br />
<br />
Grant’s chest heaved slightly, his breath coming in heavier. “Yeah, just… feels different.”<br />
Jeremy raised an eyebrow. “Different how?”<br />
<br />
Grant paused, his eyes distant for a second, like he was trying to remember something but couldn’t quite piece it together. “Like I’ve… changed. Not just tonight, but… for a while now.”<br />
<br />
Jeremy cocked his head, intrigued. But before he could respond, Grant’s hands moved up his back, his touch firmer than before. Jeremy felt a shiver run through him, his skin tingling everywhere Grant touched, but he brushed it off, focusing instead on the growing heat between them. He could feel the bulge in Grant’s swim trunks growing, pressing against his own.  <br />
<br />
“Well, change can be good,” Jeremy said, his voice low as he leaned in again, his lips grazing Grant’s jawline. “And right now, it’s working for you.” Without warning, Jeremy thrust forward, rubbing his bulge against Grant’s. <br />
<br />
Grant let out a gasp at Jeremy’s sudden advance, his back arching slightly. Jeremy grinned and repeated his previous action, eliciting a moan this time, revealing the sharp fangs that had filled Grant’s mouth. He liked the way Grant was becoming more responsive, slowly shedding his timidity with every passing second. <br />
<br />
Jeremy pulled back just enough to look into Grant’s golden eyes, his breath warm against Grant’s fur. “You know,” he said, his voice softer now, “I’m not usually one for… anything beyond tonight. Just so we’re clear.”<br />
<br />
Grant nodded, though something about the way he looked at Jeremy suggested that maybe, just maybe, things were different this time. Maybe this wasn’t going to be just another one-night stand. <br />
<br />
But Jeremy didn’t let himself linger on that thought too long. He had control tonight, and he wasn’t ready to give it up. Not yet.<br />
<br />
“Good,” Jeremy whispered, his fingers tracing the edge of Grant’s jaw before pulling him in for another kiss. This time, it was slower, more deliberate, and Jeremy could feel the way Grant melted into it, letting Jeremy guide the moment, just as he liked.<br />
<br />
It wouldn’t be long before Grant felt Jeremy’s hands slide down his sides, brushing the thin tan fur that had grown across his stomach. Their kiss broke as Jeremy slid his hands below the waistband of Grant’s swim trunks, pulling them down as Jeremy dropped to his knees. <br />
“Just…just be gentle, alright?” Grant asked, carefully sliding down the trunk of the tree until he was seated on the cool sand beneath them. “I’m just a little worried about those massive teeth…” <br />
<br />
Jeremy couldn’t help but chuckle slightly, thought it came out more as a soft chittering. “Don’t worry,” he said, his tone hushed and seductive, “I know my way around nuts.” Before Grant could process what Jeremy had said, the squirrel had taken his cock into his mouth. Grant let out a moan, though it came out sounding more like a soft roar. <br />
<br />
Grant leaned his head back against the tree, panting as Jeremy expertly bobbed his head up and down on his member, taking great care to ensure that his large incisors never touched the organ. He dug his claws into the sand, a deep rumbling sound escaping from his throat as his face pushed out into a rounded muzzle that was accompanied by a light tugging feeling as thin whiskers began to emerge. All the while, a dense mass of golden tan fur quickly encompassed his head and neck, forming into an elegant mane. <br />
<br />
Hearing the purring emanating from Grant’s throat only encouraged Jeremy to keep going, making sure to put his hands to use as he began to fondle the feline’s furry balls. His face pushed out into a short muzzle as well, the red fur that adorned the rest of his body quickly coming to fill in the empty space. <br />
<br />
“F-Fuck…I’m gonna…” Before Grant could finish speaking, Jeremy felt the feline’s balls tense up, which was quickly followed by a hot stream of cum flowing into the squirrel’s mouth. Jeremy tried to take as much as he could, but he had to come up for air, gasping slightly as the remainder of Grant’s seed was sprayed onto the two of them. <br />
<br />
When the pleasure finally subsided, Grant was panting heavily, still recovering from the intense orgasm he’d just experienced. “Fuck…I’m so sorry,” he apologized breathlessly. “I usually…usually last a lot longer than that…” <br />
<br />
“Nah man, you’re all good,” Jeremy replied, reaching forward to run his fingers through the lion’s regal mane. “I enjoyed it, you enjoyed it…it’s a win-win, y’know?” He paused before quickly asking, “You did enjoy it, right?” <br />
<br />
Grant nodded, still a bit breathless. “Yeah…it felt incredible…” he said as Jeremy laid his head down on the lion’s belly. The two were quiet for a few seconds, basking in the afterglow until Jeremy spoke up. “So, uh…I know I said that I don’t usually take things further than one night…but I wouldn’t be opposed to doing this another time.” <br />
<br />
Grant began purring once more as he put his large hand over the squirrel’s body. “I’d like that a lot.”</p>
