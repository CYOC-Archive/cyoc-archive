<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The phone started ringing. Distracting James. He looked over to it, and then to Nan. As if asking permission to answer. She nodded. He picks up the phone after seeing the caller ID was her mom&#39;s. &quot;James! They took Cathy!&quot; She yelled &quot;What!? WHO!?&quot; James growled with rage. &quot;Werewolf hunters! They got agitated by something and they just TOOK her! I barely escaped!&quot; She says. James immediately started to assume this was somehow Eli&#39;s fault. &quot;I have to go.&quot; He said to Nan. She nodded with a slight smile. &quot;Go, My child.&quot; She said. James rushed to where Cathy was last. Seeing it torn to shreds and destroyed. He had changed back long enough to go unnoticed thankfully. Julia sobbed... &quot;She&#39;s just gone...&#39; She said as she looked up at James. But James was not about to give up... He rushed out of the room. Even in his human form he could smell the scent trail the hunters, And especially Cathy left. He follows in a blind rage. He would not be denied his dominion, Nor would he be denied his pack... It took a long time for him to find where they went. it was a very large and intimidating fortress. He would have to find a way to sneak in. &quot;HEY! OVER THERE!&quot; James hears someone yell. It was a man... Presumably another hunter. Quickly joined by two other hunters, All with different weapons. One had a gun. One had a literal sword, And the other had another baton. &quot;Attack!&quot; The leader yells. James growled. Once more feeling himself changing... He was doing it faster and faster each time he had done it. The two with Melee weapons were quickly torn to shreds by James. But the one with the gun was too far away for James to reach without getting shot. He did not care, and charged. Although... Soon, Someone kicked his leg. Hard enough to break it. They hit him across the head with their own baton. They even had a hunters gear... But they didn&#39;t attack James... James didn&#39;t care. He was going to attack. &quot;J-James! Stop!&quot; The figure yelled. they had a mask on. And they took it off... It was Eli. James was more than a little surprised to see him again. Especially after earlier. Let alone having him HELP James. Even his wolf was confused. &quot;Look... I&#39;m sorry... I... I know I didn&#39;t protect you like I should have.... I just froze up... I tried defending the ones you killed afterwards too.... Claiming they were keeping humanity safe.... But.... I don&#39;t think I was right... I just... I&#39;m SORRY!... They were only hunting wolves for sport... I thought the wolves were hunting humans but... a month ago I noticed a pattern... it was rare for werewolves to attack and kill innocents on purpose. or plan it out... it is mostly an accident... But mostly hunters targeted.... I think this war may have.... May have been provoked by the hunters...... I don&#39;t know why you&#39;re here... But my friend, Who happens to be a werewolf too was taken... After I protected her so often... Her name is Cathy... It&#39;s been years since I saw her but she helped me out when I was homeless...&quot; He says. This was part of the reason he was so effected by the wish. he was directly connected to Cathy. Cathy did not mention this but then again... She didnt have a reason to. &quot;I still remember... When we were younger... We used to play cowboys and indians... But you always changed it to werewolves and indians... This whole situation almost feels like one of our games... I&#39;m sorry if I hurt you James... But please let me help you...&quot; Eli begged. James had changed a lot... Especially after hearing Nan&#39;s explanation of who he was. But James too felt nostalgic. And a little guilty... Even the wolf in James&#39; head was a bit distressed. Ever since they met again, The wolf kinda liked Eli... Eli was as loyal as they come nowadays... On top of that James&#39; wolf was sensing something else with Eli... As was he... perhaps Eli was more important than he thought... Maybe he had his own secrets locked away in his mind... James was curious... And saw fit to let Eli help &quot;Yeah. I&#39;ll let you help. But you&#39;re under MY command! Got it?&quot; He growled. Eli smiled a bit. &quot;Of course...&quot; He did not seem bothered by this turn of events. &quot;LOOK OUT!&quot; Eli suddenly yells. Another gunman ad come out of the tree line. Aiming right for James. He didn&#39;t have time to react. But it seem that Eli did. He leaped infront of James in what would be a cliche moment. Straight out of hollywood blockbusters. Eli got shot instead of James... The hunter cursed at himself and turned to run away. Eli was clutching his stomach. Writhing in pain. But staying surprisingly quiet. James felt an intense rush of worry. And fear. (I have to protect Eli!) He thought to himself. His wolf recognized the sacrifice Eli made in protecting him... James may have been okay. But that bullet was aimed at his chest. he could&#39;ve died... But Eli took it...<br />
<br />
&quot;J-James! Go! Please! I fucked up! hunting wolves and capturing them! I&#39;ve been on the wrong side!... Just leave me here... It&#39;s what I deserve anyways...&quot; Eli was grieving over something... But that did not matter.</p>
