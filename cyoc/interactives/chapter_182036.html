<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Lisa stared down Jeff currently occupying a copy of her body. This was ridiculous on all counts to Lisa, but if this was the way to get Jeff to give up on his delusional desire to take over her life, so be it. Seeing that Jeff had slept better than Lisa, Jeff was the first to the ball. Lisa was shocked that this happened and had to quickly match up. Jeff was putting up a good fight but Lisa still had better knowledge of the game and pulled a maneuver to block Jeff, but Jeff countered it scoring first blood. <br />
<br />
”Well would you look at that!” Jeff said with a grin <br />
<br />
Holy shit, Jeff wasn&#39;t kidding when he said he could make a good her. His voicemail ramblings of having her memories and personality were becoming more believable. The Chronivac must have kept little copies of her mind every time she hopped in and wirelessly controlled Jeff. With every login, more of Jeff could have been overwritten. Oh God, the thought of that, Lisa realized she was playing against herself in the most literal way possible. <br />
<br />
It didn&#39;t matter though, if anything realizing Jeff is now a rouge clone of her motivated even her more. Not only was her life on the line but Jeff’s as well. Lisa took another deep breath and began to play with an intense passion versus Jeff/Lisa. It was difficult considering she and Jeff/Lisa were thinking the same but the real Lisa scored a goal. Yes! She was back in the game. After that for another 50 minutes, they kept going neither being able to score a goal. They both were tired taking a break and drank water, all while giving glares to each other. <br />
<br />
Jeff/Lisa spit in the real Lisa’s face. <br />
<br />
”Second half bitch!” <br />
<br />
The second half of their match was much different. Hell, it was more an MMA fight than a soccer game. Lisa had a clear shot but then Jeff/Lisa did an illegal tackle causing Lisa to scrape her knee. Lisa just got back up and when Jeff/Lisa was about to score Lisa did the same thing. They were on each other the rest of the match, hair and clothes pulling. Jeff/Lisa shoved Lisa to the ground and stomped on her with a cleat. Adrenaline was flowing through Lisa and she shoved Jeff/Lisa to the ground and both began to scratch and slap each other. Lisa was able to grab a rock and was about to smash Jeff/Lisa’s head in but she couldn’t do it. This whole thing was her fault, she deserved to have her life taken, she was the one who corrupted Jeff. She put the rock down and started to cry <br />
<br />
<br />
“Dammit you want my life, fucking take it!” Lisa said laying down <br />
<br />
Jeff/Lisa looked at the real Lisa, defeated but couldn&#39;t finish the act either. She couldn&#39;t hurt someone as perfect as herself. <br />
<br />
Lisa looked confused to why Jeff/Lisa hadn&#39;t ended her. <br />
<br />
”Lisa I can&#39;t do it, I can&#39;t hurt myself like this, I am sorry I just cannot control myself,  Jeff tried to fight it but he couldn&#39;t. Jeff was just okay, put this I am perfect as you Lisa, the perfect intelligent, athletic, and sexy straight A soccer player. As we went further into our arrangement, every time I turned back to Jeff, I kept getting sicker and sicker, waiting to become you again. It&#39;s like the universe is trying to make me another you.” Jeff/Lisa said tearing up like the real Lisa<br />
<br />
”Oh God I am so sorry Jeff.... Lisa, I didn&#39;t mean for Jeff to be erased like that, I didn&#39;t know how much pain you felt, I wish there was a way for both of us to be Lisa.” Lisa said <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Both Lisa&#39;s looked each other in their identical big brown doe eyes. Something about the last part of that statement clicked with both women. They started to laugh. Lisa well she guesses now Lisa2 got back in her car with the duffle bag. They went to go get some iced caramel coffee (Lisa’s favorite). After arriving home Lisa’s 1 and 2 retrieved  the main Chronivac module from Lisa2’s bag. Upon further investigation, their worst fears were confirmed Jeff’s core personality and soul profile was virtually empty replaced with a copy of Lisa’s. There was so little of Jeff left in there, turning Lisa2 back into Jeff would be cruel. Lisa decided to finish what the Chronivac was already trying to do. She fully erased Jeff as the main user and his profile giving control of the machine to her. Then she made a final edit, making it to where Lisa2 was always apart of her life as her clone. Lisa watched as her trophies doubled and two beds occupied her bedroom. Then she unplugged the Chronivac and deleted the app from her phone. She was done with this technology and didn&#39;t want it to harm anyone else. She hated that Jeff had to be erased from existence but Jeff wanted to and would be happier as her clone. Lisa 1 and 2 looked at each other. <br />
<br />
”I need a hot shower after the day we had, care to join?” Lisa2 said <br />
<br />
”Of course!” Lisa1 stripping while heading to the shower. It was a little cramped now but it felt nice showing with herself. It felt good having someone to soap her up. After the shower Lisa2 made some smoothies as Lisa1 got her laptop and was doing schoolwork. <br />
<br />
Lisa2 came in the living room in some loungewear. <br />
<br />
”Here Lisa, we need this, oh shit Mr. Jankins project is due on Monday.” <br />
<br />
”Already on it, and thanks for the smoothies Lisa1 said <br />
<br />
Lisa2 decided to catch up on the calculus homework.<br />
<br />
After a long day, Lisa’s parents came home to greet their two daughters. After a good family dinner and sit down, Lisa1 and 2 were in their room. Lisa1 realized how amazing having a clone is she is twice as productive with school work and has a great co-captain for the soccer team. <br />
<br />
”So Lisa what are we doing tomorrow?” Lisa2 asked herself <br />
<br />
”Seeing that we are caught up with school work, I was thinking we get some practice in for States, and then we take some me time”<br />
<br />
”Sounds great what were you thinking we do during our me-time?” Lisa2 asked <br />
<br />
”I don&#39;t Lisa, what are you thinking?” Lisa1 said with a smirk <br />
<br />
Lisa2 kissed herself with a great passion. She is able to pin Lisa1 down and she began to play with her breasts. Lisa1 started to moan and Lisa2 took a nipple in her mouth. Lisa1 was able to shove her hand down Lisa2’s pants and fingered her pussy drenching her bottoms. Lisa2 stripped and Lisa1 smelled her clone’s wet panties. Lisa2 then took off her other self&#39;s clothes and both were naked. They fucked like animals giving into their narcissistic love for themselves. Lisa2 gave herself amazing cunnilingus. Lisa1 made her clone squirt getting her hair wet. After a good while the bed and their bodies were drenched in fluids. Lisa just got a brand new girlfriend as well.</p>
