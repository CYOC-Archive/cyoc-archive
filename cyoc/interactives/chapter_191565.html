<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Even though Emily&#39;s joke was in bad taste, Sandra blushed at the thought. She imagined each one of Tracy&#39;s manly hands on her four breasts. She felt her rear dampen as her pussy started to get wet at the thought. <br />
<br />
She admitted she felt weird she was so attracted to Tracy, but she reminded herself, that wasn&#39;t really Tracy. He didn&#39;t even look like she did. It was Tracy inside someone else&#39;s body. She traced that body with her eyes, drinking in the tones of the muscles.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think all this fur is making too hot.&quot; Sandra explained as she pulled off her shirt, and that was partially true. Though it wasn&#39;t the only reason she was getting hot. Obviously everyone couldn&#39;t help but take a peek at her bizarre rack, but she noted Tracy&#39;s eyes lingered just a little longer. &quot;You know Tracy, I am pretty stressed with all this. I wouldn&#39;t mind... a little massage.&quot; She tried to be as seductive as possible, swishing her tail and flopping one ear down. She pressed her arms to her side, pronouncing her boobs a little more.<br />
<br />
Tracy groaned, &quot;Sandra, this shit again? I may look like a man but I&#39;m just, not into girls, alright?&quot; She tried to keep her tone friendly, but in truth she was growing a little tired of all the other girls&#39; sexual energy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not like that or anything, just...a friend giving another friend a massage. Just two girls.&quot; Sandra spoke innocently.<br />
<br />
&quot;And the massage happens to be on her tits.&quot; Samantha put in. &quot;Stop being gross, Sandra.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh don&#39;t act like you weren&#39;t milking yourself silly twenty minutes ago.&quot; Sandra accused. If Samantha had a face, she would&#39;ve been redder than Sandra&#39;s hide.<br />
<br />
Tracy folded all four of his arms. &quot;If I rub your tits will you knock off this sexual shit and play the game?&quot; Sandra nodded, her tail actually started wagging. Tracy sighed and stood up, walking over to Sandra. He got behind Sandra and straddled her back. Tracy reached his hands around Sandra&#39;s torso, delicately resting a finger on each of her nipples. Sandra shuddered, the hands were that of a man, but the touch came from a woman. A woman who knew how to Sandra wanted to be touched. How she needed to be touched.<br />
<br />
Tracy began to trace four slow circles along Sandra&#39;s breasts, spiraling outward, his manly hands felt like feathers along her skin. Her breath was shaky and her eyes fluttered. She felt a pressing against her bare back, she knew it was Tracy&#39;s erection.<br />
<br />
Delicately and carefully, Tracy&#39;s fingers combed the flabby skin of Sandra&#39;s b-cups, Sandra began panting, her back leg kicking slightly. Then Tracy got more aggressive, each of her hands gripped Sandra&#39;s full breasts, she lightly fingered her nipples as she groped and kneaded her tits, rotating them in four circles. <br />
<br />
Sandra was breathing heavily now, her hands reaching back and tugging on Tracy&#39;s hair. &quot;Yes...Tracy...More...&quot; She panted, her pussy practically sopping by this point.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ugh, alright. That&#39;s enough.&quot; Tracy announced, releasing her hands and dismounting Sandra. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh come on Tracy, just a little more?&quot; Sandra pouted, feeling unfinished.<br />
<br />
&quot;If you want sex so bad, ask Samantha. I&#39;m sure she can shapeshift something for you.&quot; Tracy was fed up with being a toy for her friends.<br />
<br />
&quot;Grown ups are gross.&quot; Emily observed.<br />
<br />
With a huff, Sandra tried to reach for the dice, but by this point in her transformations it was far too difficult to reach down. &quot;Samantha, can you pass me the dice.&quot; Samantha nodded and grabbed the dice from the floor, the cubes absorbed into her hand so she wouldn&#39;t have to worry about accidentally rolling them. She stretched her appendage over Sandra and released the dice into her hand, concentrating on not leaving any slime residue on them. She caught a shudder from Sandra.<br />
<br />
Sandra cast the dice, six and a four. &quot;Looks like this game is really turning around for me.&quot; She beamed with a smile. She moved her piece forward past Emily&#39;s. Her smile dropped as soon as she read her card.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s just mean.&quot; Sandra pouted, her ears drooping. She set down the card, refusing to read it aloud.<br />
<br />
Samantha curiously picked it up, &quot;A ginger with no soul / Who needs to fill her hole / They say you can&#39;t stand the sun / I can think of another one. Oh come on, stereotypes? That&#39;s just low. I happen to know for fact Sandra tans beautifully.&quot; She passed Sandra a wink, though it was creepier than she intended since she didn&#39;t really have eyes, just dark spots where they should be. Still though, Sandra caught the gesture, giving a smile back.<br />
<br />
&quot;What did it mean by &#39;Another one&#39;?&quot; Sandra asked. &quot;Something else that can&#39;t stand the sun?&quot;<br />
<br />
All the girls thought for a moment. Tracy didn&#39;t say anything. Finally, Emily squeaked and back away. &quot;Please don&#39;t drink my blood!&quot; She cried.<br />
<br />
Sandra raised an eyebrow, &quot;What are you-No not again!&quot; She grabbed at her mouth, her jaw locking uncomfortably, everyone watched as her already pronounced fangs stretched even longer, now sharper and far more menacing, blood drew from gums as she gritted her teeth in pain.<br />
<br />
Then she let out a scream, arching her back as odd shapes began to breach her skin. &quot;Help me! Please!&quot; She pleaded, the shapes elongating like Tracy&#39;s arms, but it was quickly clear they weren&#39;t at all similar. Instead of hands, they had long appendages with dark leathery skin spread between them. The wings stretched to a large size before finally stopping, leaving Sandra bent over with her fists on the ground and her breasts squishing together. &quot;It&#39;s over...how bad is it?&quot; She asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Holy shit Sandra. You&#39;ve got...You&#39;re a monster.&quot; Tracy said bluntly.<br />
<br />
&quot;I was already past that point.&quot; Sandra joked, weak-heartedly. She sat back up, seeming much larger than before.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ve got... bat wings.&quot; Samantha tried to describe what she was looking at.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t feel them.&quot; Sandra admitted, she moved all her limbs, and the wings began to flap. &quot;Woah, I feel them moving. Do they... look bad?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess compared to what was going on before, yeah. They don&#39;t really go with your look.&quot; Samantha admitted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe if they were angel wings!&quot; Emily said excitedly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah that would definitely look better.&quot; Samantha agreed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well then the sooner I get rid of them, the better.&quot; Sandra decided</p>
