<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Luke scanned the shelves and aisles of the strange antique shop. It wasn&#39;t just antiques, but that&#39;s what pulled Luke in, they also sold herbs and folk medicine which gave the store an odd smell that Luke found himself wrinkling his nose at. Even more odd was the young Asian man who seemed to own the place. Handsome and maybe only in his mid-twenties, he didn&#39;t seem like the type to own the store. Then again Luke didn&#39;t seem like the type to be in it. Only in his mid twenties himself, he was a bit on the pale side from mostly staying indoors. He had a rather average build, and even his brown hair was cut in a way so as not to stand out. It was best in his job if you didn&#39;t stand out from the other office drones.<br />
<br />
He was on his lunch break and had been heading down to the sandwich place when he noticed this store. He had never seen it before despite going to that particular lunch place at least twice a week for the last year. And it couldn&#39;t be a new store, the place had that sort of air of having been in place for a long time. Old without being dusty.<br />
<br />
Luke had a thing for antiques, something about an item having a mysterious history just made it more appealing to him. Finally, something on one of the display tables caught his eye. In a velvet jewelry box was a bracelet made of fat silver links. Something about the links looked off, as if the shape wasn&#39;t quite right, and Luke couldn&#39;t get his eyes to focus on it.<br />
<br />
He carried it to the front counter and paid the smiling young man for it, who oddly ended their sale with a comment to, &quot;Have fun with it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Luke continued on with his lunch hour, grabbing his sandwich and returning to his office to eat at his desk. He set the bracelet&#39;s case down on his desk intending to deal with it later, but his eyes kept getting pulled back to it. Eventually, he pried the case open again and took out the piece of jewelry, fastening it around his wrist. The metal was oddly warm against his skin, and it was a perfect fit. Then he noticed a piece of yellowed paper sticking out of the case. He removed the insert which the bracelet had sat on, and picked out the folded up piece of paper.<br />
<br />
It was old and yellowed, and the handwriting on it looked like it might have been written with a fountain pen. Luke read it with eyebrows raising further at every word.<br />
<br />
&#39;The body bracelet has some unique properties I continue to explore. I have figured out some of the rudimentary functionality of the item. It allows the one wearing it to trade bodily attributes with others through touch. Though trade is a something of a misnomer in this case as in fact there are three ways to do this. The first is a swap, allowing the wearer to trade one of their attributes for another&#39;s. Second is to copy, this can be done in either direction causing the wearer to either copy another&#39;s specific attribute, or to copy one of theirs onto another person. The final is merging, which causes the attributes to average out between the wearer and their subject.<br />
<br />
&#39;The attributes seem to be any physical trait one can think of simply. I&#39;ve managed to do a variety of things from simple hair color, all the way up to the entire body. The key is to think clearly on the attribute and the method of exchange. Be warned, if an attribute is lost to merging or being copied over there is no recovering it. So should you want to reclaim it, I would recommend swapping it to someone you can find easily.<br />
<br />
&#39;Finally, most seem to be unaware of the changes, unless the wearer wills them to be so. Those around the person always seem to be accepting of the changes with no hesitation. I feel there must be other ways to use this bracelet, but I have not managed to figure it out yet. Though I feel as if I should be able to do the same alterations to two individuals without affecting myself while wearing the bracelet. Further tests are necessary.&#39;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nice jewelry, Luke. Embracing your feminine side?&quot; Luke looked up and glared at Dennis. One of Luke&#39;s coworkers and a complete asshole. At least to the other guys in the office. Many of the women swooned over him and Luke had to admit he was good looking. Office rumors also said that he was hung like a horse. Dennis could never confirm this, though he thought he could sometimes catch an outline through the fabric of Dennis&#39; trousers.<br />
<br />
&quot;Family heirloom.&quot; Luke said trying to just end the conversation there.<br />
<br />
&quot;Right, well, it looks stupid.&quot; Dennis smirked as he turned to walk away, a swagger in his step. Luke reached out and grabbed Dennis&#39; wrist on impulse. The note was still fresh in his mind and he thought about swapping dicks with the guy. &quot;What?&quot; Dennis said, staring down at the hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;One day being an ass to everyone is going to come back to bite you.&quot; Luke let go and Dennis walked off with a scoff.<br />
<br />
Luke found himself shifting in his seat, suddenly uncomfortable. He surreptitiously reached down to try to adjust himself only for his hand to come up against something unexpected. He bolted out of his cubicle and to the men&#39;s bathroom. He rushed into one of the stalls and closed the door, then undid his pants.<br />
<br />
Seven inches of dick flopped out of his open fly, and it wasn&#39;t even hard. &quot;Holy crap.&quot; He murmured under his breath. &quot;It worked.&quot; He reached into his pants and fished out a pair of golf ball sized testicles. The jostling caused his cock to start to harden, stiffening to what must have been almost ten inches. It wasn&#39;t the thickest, but hell if he cared at the moment.<br />
<br />
Too bad Dennis wouldn&#39;t realize the five inch hard-on he now had had come from Luke. He lightly touched the bracelet around his wrist and smiled before stuffing his improved cock back into his pants. He was going to have some fun with this.</p>
