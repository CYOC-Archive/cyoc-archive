<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Amy Watkins felt strange for a moment.  She&#39;d been struggling with several bags of purchases.  She&#39;d never been an especially tall or strong girl, and of course she&#39;d gotten stuck with picking up all the gifts for the bridal shower.  Her boyfriend, as usual, had flaked out on her.  Which was especially irritating, since the bride to be was HIS sister!<br />
<br />
At only 25, she was starting to feel like her life was effectively over.  Overwhelmed with vertigo, as if her center of balance was changing, she managed to sit down.  Unfortunately, this caused her to drop some packages, but she reached out and caught them....<br />
<br />
Without dropping anything else.  &quot;Wait, what?!&quot;  <br />
<br />
A second pair of bare arms had grabbed the fallen items.  They protruded from her blouse, as if they had ripped out of it.  She almost lost it.  Oh sure, everyone knew about STS (Sudden Transformation Syndrome) but that was a thing that happened to OTHER people.  Like, a friend of a friend&#39;s cousin or something!  But not anyone Amy knew!<br />
<br />
Especially not her!  Before anyone noticed, she hid her new arms as best she could while still grasping her items.  She&#39;d have to get home quick to find out what exactly happened to her.  She felt tears coming to her eyes.<br />
<br />
She&#39;d turned into a freak!  &#39;No, we can&#39;t do this now.  Home, and cry later.&#39;  <br />
<br />
Amy had lost her parents at a young age, and that had forced her to grow up fast, and she was a tough girl at heart, even if she&#39;d been letting Jake push her around a lot lately.  Which was mostly because she was tired of being lonely.<br />
<br />
Not that she was a bad looking girl by any stretch of the imagination, but her defenses, built up over a hard childhood, made it difficult for anyone to get close.  So she&#39;d been at war with herself this past year, trying to hold onto something she wanted with both arms, even though it was hurting her.<br />
<br />
And now she had two more arms to work with.  Forcing her feelings down, she entered a fugue state, like she always did when stressed.  Her brain went on autopilot, and she made her way to her car.  Normally she tried to resist letting her mind go like this (since she would deal with any source of stress with ruthless efficiency) but now she had no choice.<br />
<br />
Somehow, she got to her car without incident.  Her brain was able to handle the new limbs quite well, all things considered, but both pairs of hands kept trying to perform the same tasks.  Like driving.  Fortunately, she soon got the hang of three hands on the wheel, and one on the shifter.  If she were thinking normally, she&#39;d actually laugh at how much easier it was to handle the manual transmission now.<br />
<br />
She&#39;d hated it, but Jake had insisted when she&#39;d bought the Celica. saying she shouldn&#39;t be &#39;such a girl&#39; about it.  Idly, she considered the fact that Jake was no longer her problem.  He was racist and a homophobe, so there was no way he&#39;d date anyone he considered to be a &#39;freak&#39;,<br />
<br />
With the growing awareness of STS, the laws had changed to assist and protect those afflicted.  Sometimes they passed their change onto a new generation, but though most people were supportive of the victims, there were always those who were not.  Science couldn&#39;t come up with an explanation, as the mutations could occur in moments, and there seemed to be no cause other than random chance.  They balked at using words like &#39;magic&#39;, but whatever this disease (curse?) was, it cared not for the laws of physics.  That having been said, there were those who claimed that their change was a blessing.<br />
<br />
Amy wondered if she would be able to say that.  She left her packages in the car and ran into her apartment, closing and locking the door.  Jake had a key to the door, but not the deadbolt, so she turned that.  She closed all the blinds and drapes, and finally collapsed in bed.<br />
<br />
She was having an oddly sexual dream, about having multiple lovers at once.  She woke slowly, feeling hot and frustrated.  Without thinking, her new right hand reached down under her skirt to caress her nether region...and encountered something that made her sit bolt upright.  She nearly ripped her skirt and panties off before standing up to look in her closet mirror.  There, side by side, was not one vagina, but TWO!  Her thighs seemed farther apart than before, and her hips were wider as well.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh fuck me.&quot;  She quickly took off the rest of her clothes to see if anything else had changed.  Her second set of arms protruded from new joints a few inches below the first- she hadn&#39;t noticed before, but her torso seemed a little longer to accomodate the new limbs.  She had no idea how her skeleton accommodated the arms, but they articulated just as well as her original pair.  They were a little shorter.  Oh and the breasts.  Two inches below her B cup breasts were twin buds that looked like a girl&#39;s on the cusp of puberty.  The nipples were small and pink, and she didn&#39;t have to touch them to know they were very sensitive.<br />
<br />
She did anyways, and was rewarded by a very pleasant sensation that ran down her spine like an electric shock, and an intense, doubled arousal in her groin.  She needed release, and she needed it now.  Digging in her underwear drawer, she took out her vibrator and lay on the bed.  Of course she only had the one, so to please her other pussy she had to resort to the old fashioned way.  She used her lower arms for this purpose, while teasing her breasts (and her proto-breasts) with the standard pair.  <br />
<br />
She was rewarded for her efforts by a double orgasm.  It wasn&#39;t simultaneous, she climaxed, and in the middle of the first, the second came.  Blood rushed to her head, and her back arched so much she thought it might crack.  She felt like a character in a movie did when there was an explosion.<br />
<br />
There was a ringing in her ears, her eyes refused to focus, and she was dazed.  Finally, she drew in ragged breaths as she regained her senses.  &quot;That.  Was fucking incredible!&quot;<br />
<br />
She walked into the bathroom, though her legs wobbled slightly under her as she did so.  &quot;Too bad I didn&#39;t get more of those!&quot;  She was in shock, she knew.  She felt giddy as she imagined what having four legs would be like.  Would she end up with two butts as well?<br />
<br />
She explored her body more in the shower.  There didn&#39;t seem to be any more surprises.  Using the mirrors in her bathroom, she took a look at her back.  As she moved her new arms, she could see bones moving.  There must be something like shoulder bones under the skin, but they were small, like a child&#39;s.  She was fascinated by whatever arcane means her body now functioned.  How the internal organs must have been restructured.<br />
<br />
There were a dozen texts and voicemails from Jake.  Fuck him.  She was done, best to make a clean break.  She&#39;d get the presents delivered in the morning, then she&#39;d send him an email or something.  Letting him know she&#39;d cheated on him and she was going away.<br />
<br />
She&#39;d have to quit her job, but she had money saved.  Enough to get away for awhile.  She&#39;d heard of retreats, private communities for...people like her.  To help figure out the rest of her life.  <br />
<br />
But first, she&#39;d need to see a specialist.<br />
<br />
All that could wait for later.  Now, all she could think about was masturbating again.  So she sat down on the couch, and turned on some of Jake&#39;s porn.  Lesbians, she should have known.  But it didn&#39;t matter, it was hot and steamy and it no longer took much to turn her on, apparently.<br />
<br />
She was glad her home had good soundproofing.<br />
<br />
In the morning, she...</p>
