<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Benton was watching the werewolf ranger examine the corpse of the cougar Benton was forced to kill. Despite the cougar being female; Benton had no choice but to put the creature down. It tried to attack his daughter; thinking Frieda was a meal.<br />
“Look,” Benton speaking; “I had no choice; it tried to attack my daughter.”<br />
“And what were you doing in the forest?”<br />
“A catch and release hunt,” Benton getting exasperated; “how many times do I have to tell you?”<br />
“You only told me once so far,” The ranger looking at the were-panther who’s patience is rapidly thinning; “what did you hunt?”<br />
“It was a ten point buck,” Benton answering; “my daughter was the first to catch its scent.”<br />
“So she caught the animal,” The ranger asking as he looks at the broken arrow in the cougar&#39;s flank.<br />
“Yes,” Benton looking smug; “have to say I was quite pleased to see her take the large animal down.”<br />
“Who else was with you,” The ranger now inspecting the tag on the cougar’s ear.<br />
“Frieda’s friends, Eric and Spencer,” Benton answering; “as well as my wife Amanda, what else do you want to know?”<br />
<br />
The ranger stands up as he picks up the carcass and slinging it over his shoulder; looking at Benton the ranger mulls on what the were-panther just told him.<br />
“Judging from the wound,” the ranger speaking; “this animal was being hunted by poachers.”<br />
“I already knew that,” Benton responding; “what of the tag on her ear? Is there a GPS tracking chip on her?”<br />
“The tag is from a population program funded by the Oregon State University. As for a GPS tracker? The best the university could pay for would be a radio collar,” looking at the cougar; “a collar that this one manage to slip.”<br />
“So what now,” Benton grumbling.<br />
“We will let the Oregon university know the location of the cougar and inform it of its death,” the ranger heading to his pickup truck and tossing the animal in the truck bed; “we’ll inform them that we believe poachers were the cause of its death.”<br />
“Speaking of poachers,” Benton asking; “should we be concerned?”<br />
“If there are poachers in and around Moon Lake,” the werewolf grinning; “we rangers would of known about it and be hunting them already. But we will have rangers patrol the surrounding woods just in case.”<br />
“And what about me,” Benton asking; “what do I do know?”<br />
“Go inside and get some sleep,” The ranger answers; “since the cougar was deranged from an infected wound and nearly starved to death, you snapping its neck while defending some cubs was the best thing you could have done for the creature. You put it out of its misery.”<br />
“No fine,” Benton asking; “no chewing out from the council because the cougar was female?”<br />
“No,” the ranger in his truck and turning over the engine; “the cougar wasn’t pregnant and attacked your daughter. You were well within your right to dispatch it.”<br />
<br />
As Benton watches the werewolf Ranger leave; he heads back inside his house. Seeing his black furred were-panthress wife Amanda pouring a couple glasses of milk to their daughter Frieda and her friends Eric and Spencer. Sitting down to grab a glass of water to take his medication; Benton fills them in on what is going to happen. Which turns out is not much. Letting then drink their milk, Benton then speaks; “even though tomorrow is the weekend, I think it’s best to head to bed now. We all had enough excitement for one night.”<br />
<br />
Unable to find an excuse to argue with the were-panther in front of them; Eric, Spencer and Frieda head upstairs to Frieda’s bedroom. Before heading to bed; Eric follows Frieda and Spencer into the bathroom. Waiting for the two girls to use the toilet before he gets to empty his bladder; the white furred were-panther sighs, “that cougar killed all the fun for tonight.”<br />
“I know,” Frieda answering; “catching that buck was such a rush. Hell even dad was thrilled to see me do it.”<br />
“You know,” Eric watching Frieda wiping her nethers as she gets up from the toilet; “I’ve noticed you have been calling Benton dad instead of father. Has something changed?”<br />
“I guess so,” Frieda approaching the sink as Spencer sits down to pee; “he has been making an effort to spend more time with me. Being a better parent and all that.”<br />
“Joining us tonight for our run,” Spencer speaking; “is a good example.”<br />
“Plus he didn’t wig out,” Frieda chuckling; “with me buying mother’s Christmas present.”<br />
“Don’t forget,” Spencer finishing her business on the toilet and flushing; “he prevented that cougar from trying to make a meal out of you.”<br />
“Yes,” Frieda answering; “but if dad wasn’t there, the cougar would still been killed. By either of your paws,” Frieda looking at Eric and Spencer.<br />
<br />
Minutes later they leave the bathroom; with Eric the last to relieve himself as both Frieda and Spencer climb onto the king sized bed, Eric joins them and places himself in between the two girls. Using his paws; he gently rubs an ear from each of Spencer and Frieda. Both purring as it happens to be an erogenous zone for them; they rest their heads on Eric’s chest as he continues to rub their ears. Purring himself as he enjoys the feel of their fur rubbing up on his; he smiles as he feels paws placed on his crotch, his feline member coming out and rock hard. Eric growls as Frieda is the first to climb on top of him; guiding his member into her eager sex.<br />
“Since I caught the buck,” Frieda looking at Eric’s loving green eyes; I get the prize of one last ride for the night.”<br />
“And I get to help,” Spencer getting behind Frieda and placing her paws on the were-panthress’s furry breasts.<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess the cougar didn&#39;t kill the fun after all&quot;; Eric smiles as Frieda rhythmically grinds her hips to his; burying the feline shaft deeper into her canal as Spencer massages her breasts, stimulating the nipples to become stiff and erect. Frieda moans as she feels the ministrations from booth Eric and Spencer; Purring as Eric commences bucking his hips, thrusting his shaft in and out of Frieda. She sighs as her body starts getting rocked by the many orgasms as the barbs on Eric’s penis start digging in.<br />
“Not much longer,” Frieda gasping; “I’m close.”<br />
“Same here,” Eric answering; “can you feel it Spencer?”<br />
“Oh yeah,” Spencer embracing Frieda and nibbling Frieda’s ears; “I can feel your climaxes building.”<br />
<br />
“Here it comes,” Frieda gasping; feeling Eric spill forth with in her as her body shudders with its own orgasm.<br />
Spencer swooning as her eyes flicker; blinking she see Eric through Frieda’s eyes and then sees Frieda and herself looking down through Eric’s eyes. Frieda smiles as she collapses on Eric’s chest; Spencer laying on the side as she lies next to her mates.<br />
“What a wonderful feeling you two give me,” Spencer purrs; “its pure magic inducing bliss.”<br />
“Ying, Yang and Whole,” Frieda purring; letting herself sink deeper into Eric’s embrace as he places a paw on her back. Frieda’s tail thrashing as she drifts off to sleep in pure bliss.<br />
“Goodnight,” Eric kissing Frieda; “sleep well. You as well Spencer,” Eric feeling Spencer snuggling next to him; causing his to embrace her with his other arm.<br />
‘I have to be the luckiest were-panther in the world,’ Eric thinks to himself as he closes his eyes and drifts off to sleep.</p>
