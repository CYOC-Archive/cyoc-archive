<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Rudy had watched in amazement from just outside the Sullivans' yard as Jack transformed from cute, skinny, 5'11&quot;, 155 pound boy into a hinny, a sort of extra large jackass.  What amazed him even more than the change of Jack's body had been Jack's reaction.  Jack had looked bewildered when his flat little buns had started to expand to the point of bursting the rear seam of his pants.  But when Jack saw his hand change to a hoof he'd gasped &quot;Kewl!&quot;.<br />
<br />
Not many boys would have instantly understood what was happening to them and even fewer would have welcomed it.  But Jack did.  He was furtive about it, always erasing his tracks on his computer, but he spent hours and hours reading the transformation stories at cyoc.net.  He had borrowed Tony's copy of The Golden Ass.  He had discreetly asked Tony some questions after reading it, to see if Tony had gotten the same kick out of imagining being turned into an ass, but Tony thought it was terrible.  He didn't feel a tingle from considering things like that the way Jack did.  In particular, Jack dreamed of a transformation into a horse or an ass.  That reverie had been the inspiration for more than a few acts of sexual self satisfaction.<br />
<br />
Then, suddenly, it was true.  Jack was reluctantly raking the lawn when he felt he'd gotten an electric shock from something.  He wondered what it was, but not for long.  He immediately noticed a fantastic expansion of his pancake flat little buns.  Just seconds after the electric shock, his never overworked chinos were suddenly filled to the bursting point back there.  And then, with a -pop- , they did burst.  What the hell?  Jack was just about to curse or cry for help when his whole body started feeling weird, very weird.  He looked at his hand on the rake and saw his fingers clumping together and becoming darker, then black.  In just a few seconds, his right hand had become a hoof.  And then immediately, the skin of his wrist became tough hide and covered over with coarse, bristly gray hair.<br />
<br />
Jack's eyes went wide with delight.  Oh my god!  It's happening!  It's really happening to me!  I'm becoming an ass!  This is gonna be so cool!<br />
<br />
And if he wasn't pleased enough about it, Jack's shredded pants dropped off his massively thickening legs and he saw his little human penis, just average for a boy his age, stretch and swell like a water balloon held to a faucet.<br />
&quot;Allright!&quot; chuckled Jack and now he made his way awkwardly to the side of the nearest car to watch the conclusion of his transformation.  He saw his six pack of abs billow outward into his new jackass belly and he saw a tail sprout at the base of his spine.  He joyfully wagged it back and forth while also watching his neck thicken and stretch.  Finally, his ears shot up and his cute face and button nose changed.  The girls loved his cute face and button nose but Jack secretly hated his weak features.  His diminutive proboscis spread six inches wide and then shot forward accompanied by his jaw till Jack had the muzzle of an ass.<br />
<br />
Jack let out a bray of delight and then shot his seed all over the neighbor's car.  He'd only trotted a little ways out of the Sullivans' yard when he saw Tony's friend Rudy staring at him.  So what, Jack figured.  Even if he saw me turn into an ass, who'd believe him.  <br />
<br />
Rudy called the animal control people and also checked the ass profile he'd just given Jack.  He'd made a point of choosing that Jack should feel slightly and oddly pleased at being a farm animal, but it shouldn't have given Jack an orgasm, should it?  Oh well.  Just five minutes later, the first animal control dept. van rolled by looking for newly equine Jack.  Rudy smiled.<br />
<br />
But Jack was smiling as well, or coming as close to one as a Jackass could with his thin black lips.  Jack treated the attempts of the men in the van with their dart guns to subdue him as a game.  And it was a game he played very well.  The animal control people were repeatedly befuddled at the seemingly shrewd way the jackass that they glimpsed in the distance kept changing directions as soon as it was out of sight.  Of course, it was just blind luck on the part of the dumb beast, but every time they thought it was going east, it ducked behind a row of houses and headed west.  For 3 hours, they were exasperated at rolling slowly along residential streets waiting for another glimpse of the jackass.  Once, when they were on a busy street running into the center of town, they saw what looked like the jackass pressing the walk light button with its muzzle.  The men in the van looked at each other. <br />
&quot;No.&quot;<br />
But in a few moments the light changed and the jackass trotted across the street.  Meanwhile, they were stopped like all the rest of the traffic.  Finally, it started heading mostly in one direction, toward the north end of town, toward the interstate.  They drove the van onto the highway and waited.  Hills in that area funneled all traffic, by wheel, foot or hoof, toward that stretch of highway.  The man in the passenger's seat had his gun out.  Suddenly, from above them on the other side of the highway, they heard a weird bray.  It sounded almost like the jackass was laughing.  They couldn't see him, but from that side of the highway, which would take 10 minutes of driving to get to, they could hear the jackass laughing.<br />
<br />
As dusk fell, Jack had ditched the animal control saps and had made his way to the edge of a large farm.  He helped himself to many mouthfuls of grass in a hay field and noted that it tasted better than the few chomps of grass he'd had from lawns as he was avoiding getting darted.  Jack ambled slowly up past a field of corn and through some woods to a large stable.  He stopped at the door at one end and took a good long sniff.  With his giant new nose, Jack detected the presence of a mare who was hot to trot.  He noticed, almost as an observer to his own jackass body, that he instinctively grunted and stood up straighter in response to the smell.  With his thumbnail size teeth, Jack undid the latch at the stable door and let himself in.  He ambled along past a few colts and then reached the stall he wanted.  There she was, a fine young mare and to Jack's mild surprise, the sight of her full, massive rump was very attractive to him.  He could feel his salami of a penis becoming even larger beneath him as he desperately worked at the latch to her stall.  The simple down, then over motion was difficult for Jack in his new ass body but in a minute he had the latch open and was entering her stall.  She didn't immediately accede.  Jack could tell that she wanted a better mate than just a hinny.  Too bad.  He raised one front hoof and steered her to face away from him.  He could see her flex her rear and ready her delicious rump for him.  Jack jumped up on her with his front hoofs and took a hop step forward.  He let out a bray of triumph as he slammed his rapidly growing and now rock hard jackass penis into her.  Over and over he thrust.  But just those two times.  And then he shot his seed into her and stepped down.  <br />
<br />
Simultaneously, Jack cursed his equine inability to put off his orgasm for more than 3 thrusts and gave thanks for his new courtship rituals.  No more pleading with Suzy after kissing in the back seat of his car.  No more trying to convince her parents that he was acceptable.  Just &quot;you're a mare.  I'm a jack.  Let's get it on&quot;.  Oh man, this was great.  <br />
<br />
Four more times that night, Jack mounted her.  He never got past a fifth thrust, but it was still fantastic, a stress free animal orgasm.  This is the life!<br />
<br />
The next morning, Jack woke in a panic.  He forgot he'd become an ass and jumped at the sight of his hairy foreleg and hoof.  He shouted &quot;what the fuck?&quot; or tried to but produced only a loud bray.  &quot;Haw HeHawwwwwwwwwww HeHawwwwwwww!&quot;  But quickly Jack recalled the events of the previous day, his metamorphosis and its pleasant results.  He got up from where he lay in the hay outside the mare's stall and pondered the events.  <br />
<br />
What great luck to have this happen to me!  But how did it occur?  I didn't accidentally apply the wrong ointment like Lucius in The Golden Ass.  Maybe somebody has a medallion or some other magic talisman and thought they'd play a trick on me.  He sniffed at the notion.  This would be a pretty good trick except that it feels great.  But maybe I was always a jackass.  My parents named me Jack, after all.  Maybe I'm a changeling and they knew it was my destiny to return to my equine roots. <br />
<br />
Whatever the cause of his transformation, Jack was pleased with it.  In fact, at that moment, if he could've expressed it, he would've been positively contemptuous of his former human body, so weak and unsatisfying was it, by comparison.  <br />
<br />
Just as that sentiment was coursing through him, another dollop of spittle fell from his lips to the stable floor.  Jack cursed to himself.  This is ridiculous.  Somehow, he seemed to have a mouth six inches wide but lips eight inches long.  He couldn't stop a constant stream of drool from emanating from his mouth.  God, I'm like the dog in that Tom Hanks film fer chrissakes.  While fucking the mare, he'd drooled all over her fine chestnut back.  And then, Jack felt something moving in his insides.  He looked back between his legs and saw a turd the size of a softball drop out of him.  He felt more coming and tried to stop them, not sure if he should leave his mess there or go somewhere else, but found himself helpless to even slow the conclusion of his digestions as four more chunks of his waste dropped from him to the stable floor. He stared in amazement at the size of them but then decided to move down the stable to escape the smell.  <br />
<br />
He sniffed at the air as he went.  The mare.  She was up now, Jack could hear her moving in her stall.  He ambled over to the gate and walked in.  She looked at him with displeasure.  You, again!  Jack grunted as powerfully as he could.  Reluctantly, she slowly turned her rear toward him.  Jack chuckled. He jumped atop her with his front hooves and could feel his giant penis becoming its full, erect size beneath him.  He took a hop step forward, ready to put all the power of his huge rump into a thrust when a rope dropped, seemingly from out of the sky and around his neck.<br />
&quot;Not so fast Romeo!&quot; came a voice from behind him and with a yank, Jack was pulled off his mare paramour.  Both human and equine instincts united in Jack's angry reaction to this.  He turned, furiously toward his interruptor standing in the open stall gate.  <br />
<br />
It was a boy Jack's age, 15 maybe 16.  Jack eyed him.  Hmmmph.  Big deal.  The boy was just like Jack had been.  Maybe 5'11&quot; and 150 or 155 pounds.  Just over a quarter my weight, thought Jack.  Jack pulled back on the rope and nearly yanked the boy off his feet.  Jack brayed slightly, a bray of contempt.  I'm going to show this little nothing body who's boss here!  The boy was running down the hall now.  Go ahead and run, thought Jack.  You have the same pancake flat little buns I had.  But now I've got more power in each side of my rump than there are in five of you or what I was.  Go ahead and try to outrun me.  <br />
<br />
Jack galloped trotted down the stable hall after the boy and easily caught up.  Hmm.  How to make the point of my superiority?  Ah, I know.  The boy was stopped now, by a series of round poles.  The rope he'd fixed around Jack's neck had run the length of the hall and he was pulling the end of it around the poles.   Jack approached him confidently and stretched his jackass mouth as wide open as he could.  He moved in close and clamped it shut on one side of the boy's pathetic, human rear.  The next step was to lift the boy off the ground.  The boy was yelping now.  Let's hear how he yelps when I drop him on those turds I just made and sit on him with my superior ass ass, thought Jack and he chuckled to himself at the phrase &quot;ass ass&quot;.  <br />
<br />
But though the boy was off the ground, he was still pulling on the rope and suddenly, Jack felt a tremendous tug at his neck.  He lost his grip on the boy's buttock as he was yanked hard against the stable wall.  Though the boy was only 155 pounds, he knew how to multiply his pulling force using a series of slick, round poles like a system of pulleys so that he was able to overpower Jack and trap him against the stable wall.  Jack grunted furiously and then in extreme embarassment fighting with all his hinny might against his captor, but it was no use, especially after the boy roped Jack's four ankles together leaving Jack feeling topheavy and helpless.  <br />
<br />
While Jack remained bound and humiliated, the boy called for his parents and soon they and a younger brother were swarming around Jack, patting him here and there.  Jack wondered what they had in mind for him.  The answer was labor, plenty of labor.  They tied Jack to a horse, a huge horse against whom Jack's pushing and pulling made no difference, and dragged Jack to a horizontal wheel turning around a central metal hub in a dirt circle.  They tied Jack to it and immediately, Jack felt a whole series of stinging blows to his hind quarters from the younger brother.  He had a long stick with a sort of leather whip on the end of it and he seemed to delight in applying it as hard as he could to Jack's rear.  An indignant Jack stopped where he was but felt the 10 year old boy applying it over and over to exactly the same spot on his rump till Jack could not bear any more and started marching in a circle and driving the wheel.  <br />
<br />
Jack spent the entire day that way, till, exhausted, they led him to his new stall, tied to the huge horse again.  Jack licked his wounds there, metaphorically, he could not reach his own hind quarters with his fantastically long tongue and plotted his next move.  A faint breeze brought a whiff of the mare.  The choice was made.  But Jack found that they'd put some kind of extra attachment on the latch to his stall.  His human mind could easily see what was necessary to open the latch but the dexterity of his jackass head and mouth were completely insufficient for the task.  Jack spent and hour pulling at the latch with his huge teeth, trying to push down and rotate a bolt at the same time but simply could not.  He collapsed in frustration.  <br />
<br />
The next day, Jack was awakened at sunrise as he was being strapped to the huge horse.  He tried to resist, but the horse easily overpowered him.  He spent the whole day turning the wheel and getting his ass whipped.  The prospect of an unending series of such days left Jack in a fit of despair.  There was no one to talk to.  His new masters would certainly not let a sterile hinny like him bother any mares who could be mating with real suitors.  Drudgery was all that there was for him.  As if to drive the point home, a convertible full of attractive, laughing girls drove by at just that moment.  <br />
<br />
What have I done?, Jack wondered.  Already, it was hard to even remember his human body.  Trying to do so was like trying to think of the melody of one song while another was playing loudly in your ears.  And the jackass song played nonstop.<br />
<br />
Finally, at the end of the day, Jack was trudging in his circle, walking over his own excrement as he went and enduring the occasional lash of the whip across his immense behind when he felt an electric shock.  <br />
<br />
At the same time as he felt his huge jackass body tingling all over, Jack felt his memories coming back to him, memories of the chronivac and even memories of being at that same farm and rescuing Tony the ass from this same wheel and the same whip wielding, sadistic little boy.  Jack got the wheel to the other side of the circle, as far away from the boy as it could be and stopped, waiting for his transformation to take place.<br />
<br />
For whatever reason, it was oddly slow.  It took not just a few seconds but a couple minutes for completion.  Most of the process was quick.  Jack felt his ass form diminish quickly down to his 155 pound body size, He lost his coat of coarse hair and his rear hooves became feet and toes.  His face resumed human shape and his thick hide became his old, pale and freckle specked skin.  He saw the boy looking at him in shock, eyes wide open and stammering at the sight of the jackass he'd been whipping suddenly looking human.  <br />
<br />
Jack was free of his ties now and rushed at the boy.  He tried to snatch the whip from the boy's hand but had a hard time of it as he didn't have hands yet, just two cleft black hooves.  With effort, he grasped it in his right hoof and pushed a stunned boy over a low railing.  <br />
&quot;How do you like it?&quot; he said, giving the boy a solid lash across his blue jeaned backside and delighted in the boy's crying.  &quot;How do you like it?&quot; he shouted again and gave the boy a score more.  As he did, Jack noted his incomplete transformation.  He still had his jackass penis, an immense priapus that slapped his thighs as he swung again and again.  He could also see the shadow of his tail still behind him as he delivered the just blows to the boy's rear.  And when he wiped sweat from his brow on his shoulder, he realized he still had his jackass ears.<br />
<br />
After 20 deserved lashes, the boys parents came out of the house, drawn by their son's crying and Jack threw down the little whip.  &quot;Remember this the next time you get ready to hit some defenseless animal.  Maybe the animal will hit you back!&quot; Jack grunted in the boy's ear.  Then he took off for the car he could see in the distance.  By the time he'd made the sprint to Tony's car, his hands were back as Mark ushered him into the back seat of the car.<br />
&quot;Hey, we're looking for someone to play Bottum, what do you say?&quot; chuckled Tony.<br />
&quot;As long as these are achieved through makeup&quot; said Jack patting his already diminishing ass ears, &quot;I'll be fine with it&quot;</p>
