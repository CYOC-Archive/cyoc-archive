<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Suddenly Susan felt someone grab her hair and pull her away from her laptop. Susan fell off her desk chair and a moment later she found herself lying on the floor of a university campus room. Susan jumped to her feet and saw that her work laptop had turned into the laptop Susan used when she was a student.<br />
<br />
Susan looked around and observed that her campus room looked different. Susan&#39;s computer science books had turned into psychology books and when she opened the nightstand drawer there was a familiar sight waiting for her. Energy drinks and similar aid meant for masturbation and sex. Susan couldn&#39;t believe how similar the insides looked as it did in her home&#39;s nightstand.<br />
<br />
Susan noticed the small bathroom door in the room and without thinking she rushed in front of the mirror to see what she looked like. Susan was confused how young she looked. A moment ago she had only been a 43-year-old middle-aged woman and now she was a student in her early twenties at university. Susan only had a casual looking t-shirt and panties on herself when she finally saw that her regular clothes had also changed. Susan looked down and saw her cock’s bulge getting bigger. Susan lifted the waistband of her pants and observed how her youthful dick which was only four inches in length. She knew how much longer her cock was going to be in the future as it felt weird to stare at her own normal sized dick before she it got cursed by the phone call. Susan looked back at the mirror and stared at her reflection. Even the breasts were a bit smaller what they used to be just seconds ago. Susan grabbed and bounced her natural double-D cups in front the mirror as if she always had them. Susan thought that her double D-sized were perfect size for her. Susan thought how sad it was when the curse was going to make them bigger too. Still as Susan kept staring at her past self she didn&#39;t understand why the curse had sent her back in time or was this one of her daydreams.<br />
<br />
Susan heard someone fiddling with the room&#39;s keyhole, and soon a girl who looked familiar but who Susan had never seen her before entered the room. The girl in her early twenties greeted Susan as if she recognized her and the girl set her books she carried down on the table. The girl then asked if Susan would like to join her in a book club after the classes.<br />
<br />
Susan looked at the girl more closely from behind and began to remember who she was. She was Jennifer&#39;s mother, Thea Goldberg. Susan remembered how they had met at the beginning of the school year and had experienced love at first sight. Thea quickly turned her head when she saw Susan&#39;s erection. Susan felt a really strong burning sensation in her head and an intrusive thought that she wanted to do something to Thea. <br />
<br />
Susan didn&#39;t say a word, but she felt her body move as if by itself. Susan grabbed Thea&#39;s shoulders and gave a loving kiss to Thea&#39;s neck that made Thea tremble with pleasure. Susan took Thea&#39;s shirt and bra off while she kept kissing her neck. The two continued kissing until Susan and Thea were lying on the nearest bed. Thea didn&#39;t say a word, but it was clear from Thea&#39;s face that they had done this more than once. Susan&#39;s thoughts raced and she felt her 4-inch cock grow longer. Susan sucked Thea&#39;s breasts and she let Thea suck her breasts. At some point, the loving kisses and displays of emotion turned into raw fucking. Susan and Thea were completely naked on the bed when Susan started moving her hips in front of the girl&#39;s pussy in missionary position.<br />
<br />
Susan pushed her cock into the girl&#39;s pussy. The silent lovemaking had begun when Susan took Thea&#39;s virginity. Susan was too deep in a trance to do anything to stop herself. Susan could only think about sex and how good it felt to be able to fuck her girlfriend&#39;s pussy without a condom.<br />
<br />
Susan felt the tip of her cock push deep inside Thea and at that moment Susan released her semen inside the girl. Susan found herself in a fucking position on the office floor. Susan&#39;s thong was completely covered in her womanly seed and some of them were forming a wet damp on the inner layer of her freshly cleaned jeans. Susan blinked her eyes in disbelief, thinking that her daydream felt too real. It was something else than the harmless daydream she usually had while she did her regular three day masturbating in the bathroom. Susan was absolutely certain that she was at her old college campus and had sex with Jennifer&#39;s mother but she wasn&#39;t sure how is it was possible. So Susan logically came in to the conclusion that it had to be a daydream that just happened to feel real.<br />
<br />
Susan carefully stood up and swiped the dust particles off from her clothes. Susan noticed that she had her normal clothes on her. Which were the white office shirt under the pinstripe jacket that matched her car&#39;s color, the black colored jeans that reached to her thighs and the black high heel boots. The exposed upper cleavage part of the office shirt felt bigger than it should had been. Susan&#39;s G-cup sized orbs followed her every movement. Both of them were heavy but luckily Susan&#39;s custom made bra kept them in upward position. Without her bra the breasts would have dropped down to their natural tear shaped form in an instant. Susan lamented how much she missed her double-D-sized breasts as it was difficult to find an office shirt that would fit her and wouldn&#39;t expose her areolas. Which reminded Susan to check the new changes that she felt when she had sex with Thea in her daydream. Susan lowered her jeans to her ankles and saw that her former eight-inch cock had grown into a massive ten-inch cock. Thankfully Susan’s balls were the same size as before. Susan was amazed and spun her large cock in her hand until she wondered if this was the punishment. Susan felt confused what was the curse’s end goal. She didn’t mind at all if she had more sex. Susan sighed, shook her head and closed the laptop’s lid.<br />
<br />
Finally, Susan looked around the room and saw no other changes or anybody else in the room. After that, she pulled up her pants and left her office as if nothing had happened.</p>
