<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The lights were on low as Martin Brown and his wife, Josephine, sat at their kitchen table. Both of them had a lot to think about, especially with regard to their partnership with the lab. It had started with an idea to increase production for meat, diary, and eggs from various farm animals in a way that would be acceptable to many of the people who were complaining about the hormone therapy issues that many of the major and more corporate farms tended to do. The experiment in a sense amounted to creating a hormone therapy that would taste and act as though the animal wasn&#39;t being given additional hormones. The government had decided to jump in on the project with the idea for increasing food production that way. <br />
<br />
The project, though, ultimately had different consequences in that the serums got mixed and lead instead of more productive animals was anthropomorphic animals that were well muscled and well curved if female and very well endowed if male. It cost them all of the livestock they&#39;d had on the farm at the time of the initial outbreak of the Animalia Virus and then their daughter&#39;s humanity. They had accepted it and accepted the scientists that had been on the original project were caught so flatfooted by the virus that it would be unlikely that Abby would ever be human again, and thus accepted that she would be romantically involved with Samson for the time being. Abby deserved some happiness in her life, even if it wasn&#39;t normal by human standards.<br />
<br />
At first, they thought that things would remain somewhat unchanged, until the virus from the original spill turned up in the city&#39;s water supply and began uplifting pets and the zoo&#39;s animal and after Abby&#39;s day at school. It lead to Abby&#39;s friend Sarah being infected and people actually beginning to inquire about actually joining Animalia for various reasons. They&#39;d been there for when Thomas and Julia Wesley joined their daughter and former pet as Animalians, and could easily see that the two new huskies looked younger than they&#39;d been before they were transformed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Things have certainly changed a lot from when we started working with program to provide things to improve food production,&quot; Martin said slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Josephine nodded as she looked across the table, &quot;we have a whole new civilization rising and living alongside humanity... and so far doing rather well.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Things could change, though,&quot; Martin commented, &quot;as people have changed.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course,&quot; Josephine commented, &quot;though the Wesleys were the first to actually go through with it. From what the government representatives told me, they were only getting requests, and that was what leading to their decision to accept the requests.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Which I find surprising, as Julia seemed rather uneasy with her dog&#39;s initial transformation,&quot; Martin pointed out.<br />
<br />
&quot;I suppose she loves her husband that much,&quot; Josephine commented, &quot;but then that isn&#39;t our business.&quot;<br />
<br />
Martin nodded and sat back in his chair and thought for a moment, &quot;but it does leave us with something to think about... if... maybe...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Become Animalians ourselves?&quot; Josephine blinked.<br />
<br />
&quot;We know that Abby won&#39;t get a chance to be human again and she won&#39;t give up Samson for anything,&quot; Martin commented, &quot;eventually they will likely marry and begin producing foals. How do we explain to our grandchildren that we aren&#39;t American Quarter Horses like they are or like their parents?&quot;<br />
<br />
Josephine reached out and softly held her husband&#39;s hand. He looked up from looking at his hands to looking at her as she did so. Josephine looked calm and understanding and very much the steady rock that had kept Martin going through many of the hurdles he&#39;d had in his life, not just those that relate to the Animalia Virus.<br />
<br />
&quot;The same way we&#39;d normally deal with these tough situations,&quot; Josephine commented, &quot;I know it&#39;d be nice to be a real family with Abby and give our future grandchildren grandparents that they can identify with... but that wouldn&#39;t be what YOU want for yourself, is it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No... not really,&quot; Martin commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;And our future grandchildren will understand,&quot; Josephine continued, &quot;we have photos of Abby sitting on Samson&#39;s back when he was still a mundane horse. They&#39;ll know that their parents weren&#39;t born as they are now eventually, and I&#39;m sure Samson and Abby will both try to be honest with their future children.&quot;<br />
<br />
Martin nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Besides, the process in and of itself wouldn&#39;t be that easy,&quot; Josephine commented, &quot;we both saw it with Julia and even with Sarah and Mary Alice... even with Thomas to a degree. He may have been a closet furry... but that doesn&#39;t mean he was entirely at ease with the fact that he&#39;d have to suckle from his own daughter in order to become what he wanted... Julia even more so, and I think she only went along with it because she loved her husband.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And Sarah&#39;s acceptance was a bit tentative,&quot; Martin agreed.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, do you think Abby&#39;s going to be very comfortable with us suckling from her?&quot; Josephine asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Probably not,&quot; Martin surmised.<br />
<br />
&quot;And as we&#39;ve been noticing, the Animalians are rapidly adapting many human behaviors,&quot; Josephine added, &quot;horses are not naturally monogamous, and we originally bought Samson to serve as breeding stock for the mares we already owned. And while he may look at some of the other mares... surely you&#39;ve noticed the only one he goes to with any sort of amorous look... is Abby.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And the other mares have been hoping for new un-mated stallions to arrive,&quot; Martin said slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;And our marriage till death do us part,&quot; Josephine answered, &quot;and I&#39;m not the type for an open marriage. I&#39;m not sharing you with another woman, human or mare.&quot;<br />
<br />
Martin gave a low chuckle and nodded, &quot;I suppose you&#39;re right.&quot; He ran his hand back through his hair for a moment before he continued speaking. &quot;I suppose I just feel a bit odd, as it were... being the only Humans in Animalia.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It can be,&quot; Josephine replied, &quot;but we on the Town Council did agree that the Edicts would also apply to work with humans, so no eating humans and no bullying type behavior, and Clara and Bobby both agreed that Animalia could be left open for any human that wants to move in and live among the Animalians. They&#39;d have to follow the Edicts and rules... but that&#39;d be same as if you moved to another town or another state.&quot;<br />
<br />
Martin nodded at that, as that was understandable. He gave a warm smile, &quot;very forward thinking of them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Josephine commented, &quot;as while we may soon see a fair number of people in Lyre... or from around the country coming here to join Animalia, we may also see humans deciding to live in Animalia as well. So, we won&#39;t be the only humans here...&quot;<br />
<br />
There was a brief pause, before she continued, &quot;and even if we don&#39;t see humans moving into Animalia... this is still our home, regardless of whether or not we change. And it always will be.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And that sounds good,&quot; Martin smiled and felt a bit more relaxed.<br />
<br />
He and Josephine might remain human, but Josephine had raised good points. And since the &quot;Ten Edicts&quot; that Animalia was basing their entire civilization on hadn&#39;t broken down, it wasn&#39;t as though they&#39;d face being ostracized because they were human. Remaining on the farm would also let them stay close to Abby and watch her and Samson &quot;mature&quot; and go about starting their own family in the future. Things changed, and while they could be surprising, that didn&#39;t make them bad.</p>
