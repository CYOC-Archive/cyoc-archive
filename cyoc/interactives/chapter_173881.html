<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff had been waiting in the bathrrom for over an hour now, and was beginning to panic. The question of &quot;did Brianna just up and leave&quot; had floated through his head a few times, but he managed to hold off from exiting the bathroom. Finally he heard a knock and Brianna call out to him. &quot;Hey, sorry it took me so long, and I am sorry for what is about to happen to you if you end up hating it.&quot; <br />
<br />
Jeff exited the bathroom and assured her he would be fine with whatever she did to him. In just a few minutes, her changes would start, and the thought of it was making Jeff a bit nervous. How much had she exactly she changed about him? Would he even still be himself? He had locked the reality and awarness settings to prevent a possibility where they wouldn&#39;t know he was ever changed, so at least there was that.<br />
<br />
&quot;So... are you excited?&quot; Asked Brianna, casually trying to break the silence. <br />
<br />
&quot;I am a bit nervous if I am being honest. But, I trust you didn&#39;t do anything extreme, like make me some kind of human/animal hybrid... right?&quot; Jeff said with a nervous laugh. Brianna was dumbfounded. &quot;Wait wait wait. I could have done that? Fuck! Now I want to redesign my whole idea. I think you would have looked really cute with a pair of animal ears and a tail. Damn it, why didn&#39;t you tell me?&quot; Brianna complained playfully. She couldn&#39;t help picture Freya with variius animal parts. A pair of horse ears to match her ponytail, or with an additional torso and legs, making her into a kind of human centaur. Or maybe a long snake tail instead of legs. Yeah, this would definitely require way more looking into, and maybe a bit of experimenting after their diner date.<br />
<br />
Suddenly her daydreaming was interrupted by Jeff groaning as he gritted his teeth in pain. &quot;Brianna, what did you do to me? My feet are literally killing me.&quot; However before Brianna could even react, Jeff&#39;s socks reshaped into the heels Brianna had specified and secured themselves onto Jeff&#39;s feet. Like a switch had been flipped, all of the agony Jeff was feeling suddenly vanished the moment the buckles on the heels closed around his ankles. &quot;Brianna?&quot; Panted Jeff.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok, so... Let me explain everything once you are done.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You mean there is more than this? How much more?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;... A lot more, sorry.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff just patiently waited out the rest of the changes quietly. Unlike with her feet, Freya didn&#39;t experience any more painful changes. However she never expected that she would become a woman. Freya took a seat on her bed, while naturally crossing one of her legs over the other without even thinking about it. <br />
<br />
&quot;Now then, if it is alright with you, could you, no, would you be so kind as to explain why I have become a woman, Brianna.&quot; She asked both politely and a bit too formally for the situation.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wanted to see if I was a lesbian or not.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see. And did you find the answer to what you were looking for?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Perhapse. I think I may be at least bisexual, because right now, I am finding you to be extremely beautiful. And I want to fuck, and get fucked, by you in this form. However, I still find your male form to also be pretty attractive&quot; explained Brianna.<br />
<br />
Freya took in a deep breath and sighed. Brianna didn&#39;t miss watching as her breasts shook with her exhale. And Freya didn&#39;t miss it either, as she watched Brianna&#39;s face turn a bit red from lusty excitement. &quot;Well, I did say anything was fine. So you did not do anything that would require you to be sorry about. You can relax, alright. I am not even mad or upset. I am simply just adjusting to my new body is all.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Is that so... uh. So... what now? It is still a bit too early to attend our reservations you know.&quot; Asked Brianna.<br />
<br />
Freya relaxed her posture quite a bit, while being careful to not damage or ruin her outfit. She went to remove her heels, but was stopped the moment she undid the buckle by the return of the pain. &quot;So, it seems that wearing these high heels are permanent part of my life now. And before you say anything, no. I am not complaining in the slightest. If this form is what you desire most of all, then I will be more than happy to become Freya for good you know. And I am being serious too. This body is very comfortable actually now that I have gotten a bit more use to it. So please don&#39;t worry about me. Tonight is also about making you happy as a thank you for what you did for me last time. Plus, it is completely reversible if we grow tired of it, or you figure out your preferences no longer align with all this.&quot; Freya gestured to her entire body, kind of seductively too, although she didn&#39;t intend it to be like that. <br />
<br />
Brianna nodded happily .&quot;Understood. Then, I want you to show off your sexy body for me.&quot; Freya stood up, sauntered over to where Brianna was standing, and pushed Brianna down onto the chair she was standing next to with just one of her fingers. &quot;They enjoy the show&quot; teased Freya as she began giving Brianna the best lap dance she could do while still wearing the dress. It wasn&#39;t a great dance since her flexibility and movements was greatly restricted by the dress, but she was having fun doing it. They took turns fooling around like that until it was time to leave. <br />
<br />
Freya had even booked for a car to pick them up. But when a second woman appeared instead of a guy, they had to make up an excuse, saying Freya was actually the intended passenger from the beginning and that this was all a gift from her brother. Luckily the driver didn&#39;t want to dig any deeper and just went with it. It was durring the ride when Freya&#39;s phone recieved a message from the developers. They had sent her a link to download an early access moble version as a courtesy for the recent issues she had faced. Now she could have access to the Chronivac whenever, wherever she wanted to. Perhapse she could have a bit of fun at this dinner with Brianna? Maybe change a few of the other guests, or maybe turn all of the workers into hot, scantily clad girls or handsome men?<br />
<br />
Hold on just a sec. Why was she fantasizing about handsom men? And actually, why did she feel this was more of a date with just a close friend than her girlfriend? Oh shit. Freya opened up the new app and accessed her profile. Sure enough, Brianna had forgotten to change her sexual preferences. &quot;Fuck that was close one&quot; she said out loud. <br />
<br />
&quot;What was?&quot; Questioned Brianna.<br />
<br />
&quot;Did you know you accidentally left me set to be a heterosexual woman?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh no! I didn&#39;t even realize I could set that. Fuck, that means that I could have just made myself whatever sexual preference I wanted from the get go too, doesn&#39;t it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Kinda. But its cool. I just fixed us.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Awesome. So now are we correctly set to being a pair of hot as fuck lesbian bitches?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I don&#39;t know about being a couple of bitches, but if we are, then I cqll dibs on being the elegantly sexy bitch. While you can be the super hot bitch.&quot; Said Freya, who now that she was properly attracted to Brianna again, was enjoying herself a lot more.</p>
