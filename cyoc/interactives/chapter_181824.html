<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">When he pulled back his pants and underwear he unleashed a cock worthy of his new manly frame.<br />
<br />
Mason looked even better nude. He had a beautiful bed of hairs on his chest, well defined and rugged muscles running down his body, a fine booty, and best of all a big meaty dick that made Janette giggle in excitement.<br />
<br />
His dorm room matched his new form, it was a nice clean space with all his jeans folded and put away, his plaid shirts hung up, and his cowboy boots set near the doors. His bedsheets were neat and tidy, his schoolwork all completed, and his decor depicting country singers and rodeo stars Janette had never heard of before.<br />
<br />
“You sure a good southern boy like yourself should be having sex before marriage?” She asked while trying her best not to strip down naked at that very moment.<br />
<br />
“Ah, I’m no bible thumper,” he replied in his rugged country accent. “Pa always said you should know your partner before you marry em, and that includes sexually. Don’t wanna get all the way to to the wedding only to discover something’s wrong.”<br />
<br />
“Oh, there’s nothing wrong,” Janette cooed as she approached his cock, she couldn’t control herself any longer, she got down on her knees and gripped the shaft between her fingers, biting her lip as she watched it spring to full attention at her touch. What hole did she want to stick it in? It didn’t matter, her mouth was closest so blowjob it was.<br />
<br />
She leaned towards it, touching her lips softly against it and feeling the heat on her face. She released her tongue and took a careful lick, a small taste. Mason was a clean man, there was a small lingering flavour of salty sweat but other than that it smelled fine. She liked the taste, she slid her tongue out again and gave it a long lick, feeling the warm rod of meat shudder at her touch. She couldn’t take it anymore and kissed the tip, her teeth parting and the first few inches sliding into her mouth. She pulled back a little before going a bit deeper, then back up, then a little deeper.<br />
<br />
Was that her limit? No, she could go further. Was that her limit? No, there was a bit more room. Was that her limit? Absolutely not.<br />
<br />
She slid up and down his cock, letting it slide to the back of her mouth and fill her face up with its girth, she rolled her tongue around it, pressed it into her left cheek then her right, and lubricated it with her saliva. Sliding up and down if became easier, she used her teeth to direct it, squeezing down on it with her lips and pressing up on it with her tongue. She went faster an faster, enjoying the numbing feeling, enjoying the ease it slid back and forth, and enjoying the way his cock pulsed and throbbed. It beat faster an faster, she could feel his heartbeat through his cock. It tensed and with a jolt her mouth became filled with a bitter substance.<br />
<br />
She wasn’t sure if she should drink it or not, it was just suddenly in her mouth and it tasted so different from his dick. She gagged a little and it spilled down her lips before she decided it would be easier and tidier to swallow. Maybe next time she’d have a clearer idea of what to do, but for now swallowing seemed right. In fact his semen almost tasted familiar.<br />
<br />
“Oh, that was amazing,” Mason laughed as she slid her lips off his dick, unwilling to let it be dirty, she washed his cock off as it went semi-flaccid in her mouth. When she pulled back she somehow felt better. She smiled and wiped her lip off, taking that bit of spilled cum with her man movement, she gazed down and felt her eyes widen in shock.<br />
<br />
His cum was a brilliant pink colour, the same pink as her confidence potion.<br />
<br />
“Was that what changed you?” She asked while going wide eyed.<br />
<br />
“Did wha?” He asked in confusion before she felt a heat fill her body and she began moaning in pleasure. Her brown hair began to lengthen and turn blonde in colour, braiding itself nicer and more expertly down her back as it went, beautiful blonde bangs falling into her eyes while she lurched back, arching her back. Her breasts began to swell, getting bigger, bouncier, and perkier. Her waist caved in sexily, her hips flared out powerfully, and her arms and legs got a little stronger looking and started to tan until she looked like she’d spent most of her life under the kiss of the sun. Freckles exploded across her body. They scattered across her nose, spread across her shoulders and hips, and dotted her breasts beautifully. Her eyes began to change colour becoming a beautiful brown that would calm anyone and her voice became downright angelic in tone. Even her breathing was beautiful.<br />
<br />
“What’s happening to me?” She groaned as her voice took on a southern country drawl that made her sound earthly and simple. She always hated that voice, everyone thought she was dumb because of it.<br />
<br />
She’d grown up in the south, out on a farm and the youngest of a whole herd of kids. She wasn’t inheriting any farmland anytime soon and that was fine by her, she loved to read. She loved it so much she wanted to write for a living. She was taking a big English degree at a big city school and no one that looked at her would guess that she was top of her class. She was valedictorian levels of intelligence and wit. She liked studying literary theory and fiction. A big fan of dystopian novels with a nose for allegory she was well on her way to be a literary professor one day. Though no one knew she had a soft spot for country romance novels. She loved those and wrote them in her free time, would they get published? She had no clue, a nice dystopian novel with lots of allegory seemed more in line with what she was into.<br />
<br />
“Janette, you okay there babe?” Mason asked her as she stared at the roof, her entire life rewriting itself. She shook her head at his words and blinked thrice.<br />
<br />
“Nah, I’m good,” she replied, the taste of the blowjob she’d just given him on her lips and making her horny. Everyone around her always assumed she was dumb when she first met then on account of her looks and her southern accent. Mason was the only guy who saw her smarts from the get-go. She was glad she’d met him at school, if he hadn’t been there maybe she would have truly believed she was dumb.<br />
<br />
“You zoned out after the blowjob,” Mason commented with concern.<br />
<br />
“Just thinking,” Janette admitted with a sigh and lean towards Mason, placing her head on his beautiful chiseled chest. “You ever think about using that cum of yours properly? It goes down my throat, up my ass, and across my skin, but the only time it’s ever in the right place it’s all wrapped up in a condom.”<br />
<br />
“You know that if I go in raw you could get pregnant,” he warned her and she sighed, patting him on the chest.<br />
<br />
“I don’t think that sounds too bad,” she admitted.<br />
<br />
“Janette, baby, you’re the smartest girl I know, you’re gonna be writing textbooks and analysis, teaching classes of brainiacs how to understand books. I ain’t ruining that with a baby,” he told her. “Pa always said I need to find a girl with aspirations not some floozy to have a bunch of kids with.”<br />
<br />
“I know,” Janette sighed. Feeing annoyed by how airy her voice sounded. “Can we have a baby one day though, maybe two even?”<br />
<br />
“We can have as many as you want Janette,” Mason replied. “You just get educated first, gotta set a good example for them.”<br />
<br />
He leaned down and they kissed passionately before Mason reached over and picked up a packaged condom.<br />
<br />
“Now, I think it’s bout time we did some practicing for all those kids we’re gonna have one day,” Mason proclaimed while Janette giggled and set herself on the bed, raising her rump into the air, ready to receive Mason’s fine country meat in her body. He didn’t waste any time. The second he had that condom on his dick was plunged into her body and she gave a heavenly cry of delight moaning as he started to pump in and out of her.</p>
