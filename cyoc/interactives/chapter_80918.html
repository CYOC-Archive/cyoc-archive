<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">He was too tall. Bumping into everything but he wanted to stay this age and he wanted muscles. So many muscles <br />
that he made body builders look anorexic.<br />
<br />
So as he changed his body he became 5'6&quot; tall but his shoulders reached out to almost 5' from shoulder to <br />
shoulder. His hips expanded with logs for legs supporting the super structure that was his new body. His pecs <br />
expanded out to create a shelf at his front. His actual waist was 28&quot;. He had an incredible V shaped body. His <br />
head reshaped to a more angular form and his beard was just 1/4 inch long but it was black and thick giving <br />
him that rugged hansom look. His hair wasn't long but it wasn't a crew cut. And was that a breeze flowing <br />
through his room tossling his hair.<br />
<br />
As he looked in the mirror he saw a god.<br />
<br />
But he was a lone god.<br />
<br />
He thought of the chronivac and though how could I possibly use this on someone else. He started to go through <br />
the names listed. It seemed to have names listed of all his friends, acquaintances, bullies, anyone he had any <br />
sort of contact with. He pulled up Tony. Now Tony was a very hansom man. Not as hansom as he was now but very <br />
hansom and he had always lusted after him. But being the football center. Big beefy sort but furry as any man <br />
he could have ever known when he was 15 just the other day. Being 18 Tony was legal but it wasn't exactly what <br />
he wanted.<br />
<br />
So as he looked at Tony's stats he began to make some changes.<br />
<br />
He changes his sexual orientation immediately from a dominant straight man to a very submissive gay man.<br />
<br />
He left his height at 6' And put him on a table in his room with his arms and legs strapped to movable wings <br />
so that he cold get easy access to any portion of Tony's body. His head was strapped down as was his chest <br />
right under his pecs. As he hit submit he saw his room turn dark and was walled with black rubber. The floor <br />
was tiled with a large drain in the middle right under the table that Tony was attached to. This wasn't <br />
unusual for Tony because he had changed his memories to coincide with this life.<br />
<br />
He took a tube from a container hanging from the ceiling. It had a butt plug attached to the end with a hole <br />
going all the way through. There was a shutoff valve at the base of the plug and links that attached to the <br />
table to hold it in place. He stuffed the tube up Tony's ass and attached it securely to the table and turned <br />
on the valve full. Walking around to Tony's head he dropped the flap on his leather jock strap and dropped the <br />
flap holding Tony's head secure so that he his throat was wide open. He shoved his cock deep into Tony's mouth <br />
and began to thrust. As the liquid filled Tony's guts he face fucked him. <br />
<br />
Tony knew that he would continue to be filled by the liquid until he got off but he was so stretched in the <br />
abdomen that he could hold a large amount of liquid. He had done this every day as long as he could remember. <br />
When he came almost half an hour later he raised Tony's head even more so that he could see the mound that was <br />
his belly. It was as round as a beach ball. Those angry red stretch marks weren't new but they were stretched <br />
as far as they could go. He sauntered back to the valve allowing a few more gallons to enter Tony before it <br />
was shut off and the plug was left in. <br />
<br />
He rubbed down Tony's belly with some oils to soothe the stress in his belly. Tweaking Tony's nipples got him <br />
off. Not that Tony needed that any more. He had lost his balls long ago. He was a pleasure slave for his <br />
master and after this treatment he laid there for a couple hours filled. When he took the plug out and Tony <br />
emptied his contents on the floor and it was all washed down the drain he felt the emptiness. <br />
<br />
But he took Tony to the buffet to fill him from the other end. That belly would once again be as round as a <br />
beach ball and they would go out to the bar and awe the patrons with the contrast between the two. Not that <br />
Tony was really fat but he was stuffed huge and his ball belly seemed to fit perfectly under his masters <br />
massive muscular pecs.<br />
<br />
They were perfect for each other.</p>
