<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The lock turned effortlessly as the state trooper furies entered the home. Insisting they be the first to enter as they secured the residence with a systematic room by room search. They were called upon by the town’s sheriff to assist in capture of the two humans who entered the town and began a fury killing spree. Two came up from the basement just as deputy Louis Whitefur and the Komodo Dragon fury Sergeant entered the home.<br />
“Add four more charges,” one of the state troopers placing a worrying paw on the sergeant’s scaly shoulder.<br />
“Stay outside for now Rudolph,” deputy Whitefur shouting outside. “Show us the bodies,” the deputy motioning for the state trooper to lead them downstairs.<br />
<br />
The basement was typical with most of the homes in the area of town. A large room in the basement with two or three smaller rooms, off from the stairs. One of the rooms acting as a utility closet; housing the furnace, water heater and in some cases the electrical panel. The large rec style area had four fury bodies placed on top of each other. The sergeant growled as noticed the infant lynx fury on the top of the pile; tossed like a common ragdoll.<br />
“That’s ten on these degenerates,” the Komodo seathing as he stomps back upstairs; bowling over the medical examiner as he was notified of more bodies over the radio while transporting the prior discovered victims..<br />
<br />
Deputy Whitefur shakes his head as he walks calmly upstairs and outside to the front yard where a large group of the community has come out to watch.<br />
“Don’t you all have anything better to do,” the deputy shouting at the group.<br />
“What happen,” a concerned fury neighbor asking.<br />
“The same thing that happened at the playground behind us and at the super market parking lot,” the sergeant barking as he exited the house. “Get back inside and lock your doors,” he adds; “keep off the streets as we hunt down the humans who did this.”<br />
<br />
The words may not have swayed the looky-loos; but seeing the first body bag that of an infant followed by three larger sized bags caused several to utter painful gasps of shock and horror. A few males stepping up to volunteer for the hunting party. The sergeant just growled as he made it clear that this would be a police matter now.<br />
“Deputy,” the Komodo dragon fury speaking low so no one can hear; “take Rudolph and Henry home. It’s getting late and we have more than enough help to capture and apprehend the two.”<br />
<br />
Louis Whitefur sighed a he nodded at the sergeant’s common sense. Looking up at the sky and seeing the sun beginning to set; he realized that he hasn’t anything to eat since breakfast and he figures the same was for the two teenage furies that have been with him. Henry being tossed into the patrol car earlier for blowing up at the realization that Lankey and Slag were killed by the two humans early in the morning. Signalling Rudolph to follow him, deputy Whitefur walked to wards the cruiser to see Henry, the Doberman fury glumly staring out of the back seat of the car.<br />
“Stow the bow in the trunk,” Louis motioning Rudolph to the rear of the crown Vic.<br />
“You need to tell Scabs about his father,” the cardinal fury putting his compound bow away; “he is owed that.”<br />
<br />
Deputy Whitefur just rolled his eyes at the task that would not win him any points from the disgruntled an ill-tempered fury glumly sitting in the back. He doesn’t respond as he climbs into the front seat and waits for Rudolph to join.<br />
“About time you two get back,” Henry barking as Louis drives the vehicle; “what happened as I was treated to all sorts of useless platitudes and choice swear words from grumpy cop.”<br />
“I’ll be sure to inform the sergeant of your whimsical description of him,” Louis chortling. Rudolph opted for a less antagonistic approach in talking to Scabs. Telling Henry how they lost the trail of the human’s before finding it again and suspecting the house they passed by as a possible place they broke into to hide out. Having to wait for proof and seeing a female lynx fury constantly knocking on the front door throughout the day. Not getting an answer, deputy whitefur asked her why she keeps coming over. Finding out that she hasn’t been able to get a hold of her brother and worried as they were supposed to meet up was all the evidence whitefur needed to break in.<br />
<br />
However the sergeant wouldn’t authorize entry without backup and ordered the deputy to hang back and stay in a safe place. The humans must have heard the exchange, as the duo where nowhere to be found.<br />
“I think they snuck out through the back,” Rudolph adding; “but we weren’t allowed to continue tracking.”<br />
“So more bodies found,” Henry responding; “anyone we know?”<br />
“Not to my knowledge,” Rudolph answering; “wasn’t allowed in the home.”<br />
“With good reason,” Louis recalling the macabre scene in the basement; “best get you home. And stay inside until its safe otherwise.”<br />
<br />
******************<br />
<br />
The two men had to leave earlier than planned. Seeing a fury constantly come and go from the front door and then another intercepting the first, made the two jumpy as they readied their pistols. Craning their ears to the door, they could only catch small snippets of a conversation over a radio. But the few words that got through was ‘Sergeant’, ‘deputy’ and ‘probable cause’. This convinced the two that the town’s equivalent of a police force was already actively searching for them, so they had at best a few minutes to beat a hasty retreat from the home they hoped to use for a more detailed plan of attack. Now they had to rush out the back door to the woods as quietly as they could.<br />
<br />
They waited for the coast to clear before cutting across the street and running behind a tall fence. Rushing to a small copse of trees affording them a bit of camouflage.<br />
“Where too now,” the first man speaking as the second reads his map.<br />
“We need to stay in these woods until we reach the river,” the second man answering; “should we do and equipment check now or wait until we arrive at target?”<br />
“At target,” Was all the first man said as he crept through the woods, looking towards the direction that the second man motioned.<br />
<br />
**************<br />
<br />
“Go inside Rudolph,” Louis sighing as he arrived at Henry’s home; a home where he lived alone with his mate. Rudolph and his mate also sticking around to keep Henry company as he dealt with losing his mother from the fury virus.<br />
“What is it you need to talk to me about,” Henry grumbling; “is it about me hitting you?”<br />
“That was grief,” Louis answering; “you are deserved such moments of emotional duress. No,” Louis pausing as struggles to form the words.<br />
“No what,” Henry getting impatient; seeing his mate, a green feathered parakeet fur standing outside; along with her sister a mute swan fury and Rudolph.<br />
“It’s about your father,” Louis blurting out the words; “he didn’t run out on you or your mother. I arrested him for drug possession ten years ago. I told your mother,” Louis trying to make this conversation go quickly; “and I guess she decided to shield you from the truth. Perhaps that is the reason why she became so obese she could leave the house.”<br />
<br />
**************<br />
<br />
The state troopers followed the trail with in the wooded area until it ended at the street. They couldn’t figure out where the trailed went; too many scents to pick up on the deer musk they zeroed in on as a possible scent to follow. Getting briefed by deputy whitefur over what he gathered from the two crime scenes so far; the deputies were informed that the humans were to be considered armed and extremely dangerous. Examining the lone spent shell discovered at the supermarket location, one trooper piped up that this could have come from a military grade bolt action rifle. Hearing the testimony of eye witnesses of never hearing the typical sound a bullet makes, lead them to assume that the human’s where using silencers to muffle the sound of their shots.<br />
<br />
So they fanned out to see if anyone in the group could reestablish the scent as they patrolled the street. A few crawling as close to the ground as possible; one shouted to get everyone’s attention as he signaled them that he has found something. Pointing down to the ground was a wad of chewing gum. One of the troopers picked it up to sniff the gum and then smiles.<br />
“I think I have the scent,” the wolf fury speaking; his runes glowing as he uses magic to enhance his sense of smell. “It leads towards to river.”<br />
“Then you have the lead,” the elk fury nodding; “everyone keep an eye out for possible booby traps. I wager these two now know they aren’t getting out of town and are now looking to take out as many of us as they can.”<br />
<br />
*****************<br />
<br />
“We made some sandwiches,” Elly helping Henry to the sofa after they watched him rage and cry in the back seat of the patrol car. Both Elly and Penny assumed it was bad news. When Rudolph told them that deputies found both Lankey and Slag dead, the two sisters felt that was the news Henry was reacting too.<br />
Henry remained silent as the deputy drove off; the urge to slug the spotted leopard fury for a second time as he was told that his father was serving a life sentence for trafficking cocaine and his attempted murder. The second charge thanks to the district attorney who wanted Stanley Babbin’s to flip on the supplier. Stanley refusing to tell or was truthful in not knowing, was spending his time at FDC SeaTac in Seattle Washington for his criminal offenses. At least that was what Louis knew prior to the Furry Flu outbreak. Very little was being released in regards to incarcerated inmates prior to the outbreak. <br />
<br />
“Sandwiches are fine,” Scabs finally speaking up; how did you make out on your catch up homework?” Henry trying to make polite conversation and knowing that Elly and Penny had course work to catch up on. Their father home schooling them and spending more time dooms day prepping left them lacking in academic endeavors.<br />
“Its slow going,” Elly sighing as Penny returned from the kitchen with a few plates of ham and salami sandwiches; “we heard police sirens non stop today.”<br />
“That’s because we have a couple of humans killing furies here in town,” Rudolph answering; “and we have no idea who they are after.”<br />
“Assuming they are after anyone specific,” Henry answering as he bites down on a sandwich; wondering what to do now that he knows where his father could be.<br />
<br />
***********<br />
<br />
They silently swore as a large group of furies were at the high school engaging in a game of flag football. They were hoping to cut across the field but had to circle around the perimeter to get around. This cost them time and they could swear they heard voices coming up behind them.<br />
“We may not make it to the target,” the first man pulling something out of his back pack. Leaning down on the ground he starts to mess with some wires before hiding and object underneath some leaves. “This should buy us a few moments as we split up,” the first man putting away a utility blade as he examines the claymore he just set and armed. “You stick to plan B; I’ll lead them away,” Tossing the second man the bottle of deer musk.<br />
“Are you certain,” The second man watching the group of furies deep in their game; “you think we are being followed?”<br />
“I could have sworn I heard voices,” the first man looking back; trying to listen to the woods but only hearing the cheering coming from the game at the nearby track field. “So get going. We may be going out, but that doesn’t mean we can’t take as many of them with us,” the first man referring to the fact that the fury flu mutated the common cold and flu viruses. Ensuring that when a human contracts the new variants he or she will become a fury as a result.<br />
<br />
The second man watches as the first head away from the track field deeper into the woods; cutting a trail allowing those following to notice and take it. He then looks at he the waiting clay more mine and understands its purpose; to give them a warning to see if anyone is following and if so, take them out. Nodding at the idea, the second continues walking to his target; the Proudhoof house where we hopes Denise is and can assassinate the tigress fury.</p>
