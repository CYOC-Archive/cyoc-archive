<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“OK, this is what we’re going to do:” Michael said. “Kevin and Joel can’t see us like this, yet, so let’s go into my bedroom.”<br />
<br />
Bix, Isaac and Michael hurried into the bedroom.<br />
<br />
“Come on Mikie!  We’ll be late for school.”  Kevin Conway yelled in his deep booming voice as he began to stomp up the stairs. “You can jack off in the showers after football practice!”<br />
<br />
No answer.<br />
<br />
Joel almost busted a gut with that one.  Kevin was the only seventeen year old guy in school to have a full, thick beard.  Some of the other guys had goatees and a few had thin, fine moustaches, but Kevin was already a man at his early age.  He’d started shaving when he was only eleven and most of the kids made fun of the nicks and cuts he had on his face most mornings.  Mike had befriended him since that time and had a secret crush on the quickly growing fair haired young man.  Since that time Kevin had filled out nicely, had become quite hairy and had been putting on more and more manly bulk.  Everyone thought Kevin was on steroids, but that simply wasn’t true.  Full manhood came earlier to some than others.  It was no accident the coach had assigned him the linebacker position.  <br />
<br />
His sidekick and partner in crime Joel Huggins, was also big and played an end position.  He had tried to grow a beard like Kevin’s thick golden one, but Joel was just too baby-faced; he only managed some fine blond peach fuzz on his cheeks and chin and one of those thin, mid-teen moustaches.  His sister teased him without end about it so he dispensed with it all together and shaved his face clean.  There was time enough for a beard later.<br />
<br />
He turned to Joel as he was going up the stairs, “So, what’s up with Denise?”  <br />
<br />
“I dunno,” Joel said, “she said she was calling in sick; said she had cramps.”<br />
<br />
“Aw, man!  I don’t wanna know!”  Kevin said.<br />
<br />
“No, not women’s cramps…”  Stomach flu cramps.”  Joel explained.<br />
<br />
“Then why didn’t you just say she had the flu?”  Kevin said and took a swipe at Joel.<br />
<br />
“Last I saw she was curled up with Harvey, her ferret.  She said she had a fever and was drinkin’ lots of water.  I left her my cell phone; she forgot to charge hers again.”  Joel said.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, you’re a good brother...  Mikie!  Where the Hell are you?  It’s too late for us to walk and we’re going to be late if you don’t get your butt out here now!  Look, if I’m late one more time, I’m gonna get detention and coach is gonna be pissed because that’s this Saturday.”  Kevin bellowed.<br />
<br />
“I’m in bed.”  Michael said, and he sounded weak.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, well she better be pretty damned good, because you’re gonna get Saturday detention too if you don’t get to school.”  Kevin said with a chuckle.  Sometimes he was just too damned funny.<br />
<br />
Joel snickered again.<br />
<br />
Kevin opened the door and moved into the room.  The bedroom was dark; Mike had pulled the curtains and thrown a dark sheet over those.<br />
<br />
“Hey, man, what’s up?  You not feeling good?”  Kevin said to the moving lump wrapped up in blankets.<br />
<br />
Just then the door shut behind the two and it was very dark in the room.  The two half turned to see what was going on when each of their heads were covered in a pillow case.<br />
<br />
Isaac, now completely transformed, and Bix knocked the two to the ground and tied their arms behind their backs and then their ankles with strips of sheet material.<br />
<br />
“What the fuck is going on!  What the Hell are you doing, you stupid bastard!”  Kevin yelled and Joel spewed profanities.<br />
<br />
Bix and Isaac moved the two young men to the edge of the bed with their heads hanging over the edge.  There were more curses, but these were ignored.<br />
<br />
Kevin felt his belt being unbuckled, as did Joel.  There was some more struggling from the two and each felt massive, muscular thighs clamp around their faces.<br />
<br />
More obscenities followed, from the captive pair and they too were silently ignored.  The rough hands then opened the fly on each of the young men’s pants.  A third set of hands pulled the jeans and then the briefs down first on Kevin and then on Joel.<br />
<br />
As soon as Kevin’s cock and balls were exposed, he felt a hot tongue wrap around his limp member.  Kevin gasped and began to breathe heavily.  The pillowcase must have been in with Bix’s bedding, because Kevin realized it smelled like dog.  <br />
<br />
Kevin groaned, “Aw, fuck!” as Michael began sucking the big stud off.  As he began giving Kevin the best blow job of his young life, Michael began grinding his cock and balls into Kevin’s hooded face.  A foot away, Isaac was doing the exact same thing to Joel.  Kevin and Joel both thought that perhaps there was some mistake and that their captors must not understand kidnapping very well or perhaps this was some strange sort of brainwashing.  <br />
<br />
Bix took Kevin’s balls into his hot maw and Kevin gasped in intense pleasure.  Bix licked and sucked at the prize jewels as his man pumped up and down on the rigid nine inch staff proudly standing out of Kevin’s red gold pubic forest.<br />
<br />
Neither of the captives lasted long.  Soon, both were pumping out their seed into the lapping muzzles.  By now, each had, had a huge set of dog-man balls and an oozing dog cock rubbed in their faces and the pheromones had done their work.<br />
<br />
Neither of the two put up much of a fight as they were rolled over and positioned.  Kevin only protested when he felt the cold KY being rubbed on and in his ass.<br />
<br />
“Calm down, Kevin.”  Michael growled, softly.  “It won’t be so bad, you’ll see.”<br />
<br />
At that moment he heard the muffled cry of Joel next to him, his face in a pillow as Isaac forced his cock into Joel.  <br />
<br />
“Oh, fuck yeah.  Oh god that feels so good!  I’ve been waitin’ to get my rocks off forever!” Isaac said in a husky, growling voice.<br />
<br />
Joel was whimpering in pain, Isaac’s knot was expanding inside of his ass.  Kevin felt the steady rhythm of fucking and he began to struggle.  He clinched his ass cheeks together and Michael sat on his back.<br />
<br />
“Bix, come over here and spread his legs…”  Michael said and Kevin thought, “Bix?”  “Hey, what the fuck are you doing, you crazy homo!”  Kevin boomed.  The moans Joel was making sounded a lot more like pleasure than pain, Kevin thought.  “What the fuck?  How could Joel turn faggot this quick?” the thought came and was interrupted as he felt a rough hands spread his legs and ass cheeks.  A well lubed finger swabbed his asshole and then begin to gently push into his opening, adding more lube<br />
<br />
“Look, Kevin, it’s gonna hurt to start with, but trust me buddy, the rewards are worth the pain.”  Michael said as he began working two fingers and more lube into Kevin’s hairy ass.  Michael was stretching Kevin out.  Michael wanted to make this as easy as he could on Kevin, he loved Kevin and he wanted to make him one of the pack, second only to himself.<br />
<br />
Kevin heard Isaac climax a second time and this time he heard Joel climax as well.  Michael moved between Kevin’s legs and tentatively push against Kevin’s hole.<br />
“Mikie, don’t!”  Kevin said, but it was what his mouth was saying.  The rest of him had already given in to the pheromones.<br />
<br />
Mike rubbed Kevin’s muscular back and gently leaned into Kevin’s ass.  His erect cock parted Kevin’s cheeks.  Kevin grunted as the cock slid into his well prepared hole.<br />
<br />
Kevin heard Isaac grunting and felt the thrusting and he heard Joel moaning, “Oh, yeah.  Oh God that feels so good!”<br />
<br />
Isaac growled out, “I thought you might see it my way.”<br />
<br />
Kevin began to understand that shortly, he’d see it Mikie’s way too.<br />
<br />
Slowly, lovingly, Michael began to thrust in and out of Kevin with his muscular hips.  His knot was beginning to inflate and he knew he had to get it inside of Kevin’s ass before it grew to full size.  Kevin let out a whimper as it was pushed past his sphincter and then Michael lay down on top of Kevin.  <br />
<br />
He whispered in Kevin’s ear, “It doesn’t have to be bad, Kevin.  You and I can care for each other.”  He growled softly and his thrusts were gentle and measured.<br />
<br />
Kevin was in tears, the pain was increasing as Michaels knot expanded in him.<br />
<br />
He heard the sound of Joel grunting with his mouth full.  Bix was getting a blow job from Joel.  Isaac was moaning as he came for a third time up Joel’s ass.<br />
<br />
Bix whimpered and came in Joel’s mouth.  Kevin heard a lot of wet slurping noises.  Isaac deflated and pulled out of Joel.  Isaac picked up Joel and threw him over his shoulder like a sack of potatoes.<br />
<br />
“I think I’m gonna give you and Kevin some privacy.  I got my rocks off and now it’s time to take care of Joel here, he’s starting to itch and I’m gonna untie him and give him a good scratch.”<br />
Isaac said.<br />
<br />
“Thanks buddy.”  Michael said.<br />
<br />
“Come on Bix, I think Joel could use a little help with some scratching.”  Isaac said.<br />
<br />
With that, they left the room and closed the door.  Michael heard them go into the spare bedroom.<br />
<br />
“So, why don’t you untie me?  It’s not like I can go anywhere with you locked into my ass.”  Kevin said.<br />
<br />
“Good point.”  Mike said and he began to untie his partner.  He removed the pillowcase and took the rest of Kevin’s clothes off.<br />
<br />
“What the Hell… happened… to you?”  Kevin said between grunts.<br />
<br />
“I dunno, but it feels so good Kevin, I just had to share it with you.”  Michael said.  “It’s like being pumped up all the time, Kevin.  You’re so strong and so fast.  Do you really think Isaac could have taken Joel otherwise?  C’mon, he’s a second string quarterback.”<br />
Kevin’s endorphins were starting to kick in.  The pheromones already had him horny as Hell.<br />
<br />
“Aw, just shut up and fuck me, Mikie, I want to get my turn at your doggy ass as soon as possible.”  Kevin growled.  Mike could hear the canine tones begin to creep into his deep masculine voice and the sound of it and what was said turned him on.  Michael began to hump his best friend faster and now Kevin was meeting his thrusts and pushing back.<br />
<br />
“Come on Mikie!  Fuck me like you mean it!”  Kevin growled and Michael began to scratch his partner’s increasingly hairy back.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Denise and her pet Harvey were fucking like ferrets.  Denise didn’t care that fur was growing all over her body and that a tail was growing out of the base of her spine.  All she cared about was that she was getting what made her feel a whole lot better.</p>
