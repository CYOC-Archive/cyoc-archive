<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Resistance was practically a bad joke in Ty&#39;s mind. The heat between his legs... it wasn&#39;t simple hormones and lust. He&#39;d been a teenager, and he knew exactly what &quot;just being horny&quot; was like. No, this heat cycle in his new female, canine body... It was a force of nature. Trying to fight back against his urges felt like trying to hold your breath, or avoid sleeping for several days, or fast from eating for a full week. Submitting to these wolves wasn&#39;t a strategy; it was an absolute carnal necessity. Besides, his shoulder was still wounded, and he walked with a small, dainty limp. He couldn&#39;t fight if he wanted to.<br />
As Ty contemplated his choice, he became aware of his tail, which was rapidly waving and flicking behind him. He was undoubtedly spreading his heat-scent all over the crowd of wolves, who became visibly more agitated as he did. Now that he&#39;d gained more understanding of his new body, Ty could tangibly feel his feminine fluids absolutely soaking the fur around his crotch and thighs, and could almost taste his own filthy scent in the air.<br />
Ty couldn&#39;t gather the strength to look the alpha wolf in his cruel red eyes, so he simply stared down at the earth as he gave a small nod. Whatever happened next, he knew leaving or fighting wasn&#39;t an option at this point. As soon as he did, a deep, satisfied growl ripped forth from the alpha&#39;s deep chest. &quot;Good girl,&quot; his telepathic voice boomed through Ty&#39;s ears, almost deafening him to all other noise. The alpha let out a sharp bark to several other wolves, before he turned and stalked off, practically oozing confidence and power with every heavy step.<br />
<br />
Ty was escorted by several wolves into a small...cave? Den? It was a covered area with a few scattered pelts and scraps, likely where the majority of the wolves sleep at night. As soon as he stepped in, Ty&#39;s nostrils filled with the scents of life- sweat, dirt, blood, food, and who-knows-what-else. The whole den was pretty dim and fairly blocked from any kind of light, though, fortunately, he could see fine enough with his new canine senses.<br />
As he was taking note of his new surroundings, Ty realized three other wolves had entered alongside him. It dawned on him once more just how much bigger they were than him- his head might come up to their shoulders or chest if he reached, and each of their paws covered triple the area of his own. What remained of his human consciousness shriveled in anxiety and anticipation, but his new female body had him lower his muzzle to the dirt, brace his forepaws out in front of him, and lift his ass to present to the males behind him.<br />
A huge wolf hopped onto his back in seconds, leaving Ty to huff somewhat in surprise. The simple sensation of a heavy male on his back, the soft brushing of the wolf&#39;s chest fur against his shoulders, the thick musk that filled his nose... It was almost pure ecstasy. A small part of Ty&#39;s mind wondered if he was practically drunk or high or something, because nothing he&#39;d ever experienced as a human compared to the closeness he felt to this beast. Ty repeatedly stepped and shifted his hind paws, trying to grind his thighs together if he could. His new cunt was soaking wet, practically squirting and frothing with his feminine fluids.<br />
Then, without warning, the thick tapered-tip cock drove straight into his pussy. Pure, unadulterated ecstasy flooded and rushed through his small body. A shudder racked his form. Ty lifted his muzzle to let out a high-pitched, ear-splitting howl of pleasure, before pressing his nose into his companion&#39;s neck and breathing in his scent. Drool ran freely down his lips, and he briefly lost control of every muscle in his body, spasming slightly. His cunt clenched desperately around that thick canine cock, his pussy lips kissing that huge knot at the base, as he released a new wave of his sweet fluids. He wasn&#39;t quite sure- he couldn&#39;t even maintain a single straight thought- but he was quite sure he&#39;d just had his first female orgasm, a million times stronger than any ejaculation in his old body.<br />
The wolf began to thrust, and Ty slipped into a hazy dream of lust.<br />
<br />
For the next several days- time was a little hard to tell, but it seemed like several days- Ty lived in that cramped den with most of the wolves. He still hadn&#39;t seen any females other than transformed Stella, who he&#39;d only glimpsed a few times. He lived out his days simply lounging about, staring into the distance and gradually grow comfortable in his new body. On occasion, his thoughts would drift to more traditional &quot;human&quot; focuses: his future, the fate of his friends, his arrival into this world in the first place. Then, just when he&#39;d been thinking too much, a muscular wolf with handsome sharp teeth and a nice thick knot will flip him over, mount him, and start breeding. He was more used as an amenity rather than an equal wolf. Whenever a wolf felt the urge, he&#39;d simply stride into the den and force Ty down beneath him, as casual as taking a leak or grabbing some meat. He lost count of how many times he was used that first day, but every single one of them brought him to a mind-shattering orgasm at least twice.<br />
His nights were similar. He&#39;d lay curled up between a couple of beasts twice his size, often with his nose tucked against a buff chest. His respite was interrupted several times a night by a male forcing another huge red rocket into his sopping cunt, and more than once he awoke in the morning with a cum-stained muzzle.<br />
His regular schedule of being a pack whore was interrupted for the first time when the alpha wolf entered the den. Ty almost came at the sight of him alone. Back when he was a human, he&#39;d never really appreciated the musculature or raw dominant presence of the red-eyed beast. Now, as the lover of wolves, his sharp eyes caught everything: the muscular nape of his neck, the feral power behind his huge glowing fangs, and, of course, the size of the heavy sheath between his legs.<br />
&quot;I trust you&#39;ve had a nice time here, bitch. You look like a real wild girl now.&quot; His telepathic voice was a startling presence for Ty, who&#39;d been living in nonverbal signaling and rough barks for days. But still, the alpha was right. Ty&#39;s fur was a mess, caked in dirt, sweat, and sexual fluids, and he practically emanated that same heat-scent, likely stronger than before. He was wild, for certain. &quot;It&#39;s a fine look for you. I have an offer.&quot;<br />
Ty&#39;s eyes widened. He pulled himself into a sitting position and curled his tail around his paws obediently, wishing he&#39;d had a chance to clean up for this perfect alpha. Still, the wolf continued to speak. &quot;I wouldn&#39;t mind a personal servant. You could be my personal bitch, bear my pups. You&#39;ll eat better, sleep better, be allowed to live here longer. But you&#39;ll lose some freedom.&quot; A little snarl ripped through the alpha&#39;s jaws, and he bared his massive fangs. &quot;I don&#39;t accept disobedience in my bitches. If you accept this offer, and disobey me- once- I tear you to shreds and let my boys piss on your corpse.&quot; He tilted his head, glaring sharply at the tiny female. &quot;I won&#39;t ask again.&quot;</p>
