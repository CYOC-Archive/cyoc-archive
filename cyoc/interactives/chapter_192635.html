<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The alarm went off with the sound of relatively soft music being played, though not so soft that it would serve to lull someone to sleep. It was just enough to raise Melissa Jenkins from her slumber. She yawned and stretched on her bed before turning to the alarm clock on her bed-side table. The time read at 6:30 AM, which was &quot;early,&quot; but also necessary, as it was a Thursday morning and still a school day. She had to get up early in order to be ready for school. Though at first, she found that operating the small buttons on the radio proved a bit more difficult than she expected. It wasn&#39;t long before things came into better focus and she saw the large muscular finger trying to push at a button, but couldn&#39;t, because the hoof-like nail at its tip bridged the button and thus she was pushing more on the plastic of the clock rather than the button to turn the alarm off.<br />
<br />
&quot;Right... went to sleep in my fursona,&quot; Melissa thought to herself, feeling a good part of her legs and feet hanging off the base of her bed when she woke up. It was all part of what came with becoming a werecow. Her hands remained dexterous in the sense that they could carry out human movement, but in her transformed state, her fingers were packed with a lot more muscle and the bones in them felt thicker, which she supposed would come into play if she ever needed to run as fast as possible, which might require a quadrupedal gait. Though, this in turn meant that using her hands for many of the things she normally used them for before becoming a werecow was a bit difficult in her fursona. Her father likely had some of the same trouble when in his weretiger form, though probably to a lesser extent.<br />
<br />
Thus, Melissa then focused on her human form and began to transform back to it. Her fingers thinned and her nails thinned and flattened down into more human like nails. Her horns and tail were pulled back inside her, as was her tail. None of this hurt now, at least not physically, and there was the sense of saying goodbye to a good friend as her fur pulled back in and her muzzle flattened in. It wasn&#39;t long before Melissa had returned to her human form, though it too was now different from before her first time with Trevor. Then she was thin and just barely fit into a B cup bra. Now, as a werecow, even in her human form, she was slightly taller, her hips a bit wider, her bust was now a large C, and still had a lot of growing to do before she turned eighteen. She&#39;d gained some additional muscle and wider shoulders; they weren&#39;t as wide as her hips but they were wider than what most would expect from a young woman her age. <br />
<br />
The other thing that had been there was that thanks to the burst of hormones that came with her becoming a were, her normally relatively well trimmed pubic hair had grown in fairly thick. Her hands briefly ran down to the wiry red hairs down between her legs and knew that would still need some attention. She&#39;d meant to trim it sooner, but some of the things related to her best friend from Michigan also moving to Moon Lake soon distracted her from that and she lost time. Though, things were quiet this morning and Melissa mentally made a note to trim all that down after a shower. She might be a were, but she&#39;d like to stay &quot;neat.&quot;<br />
<br />
One shower and a trim later, Melissa came down to find her father readying breakfast as he normally did after getting dressed. He was humming a bit as he did so. Melissa smiled to find him happy again, which was something that that had been building since he and Virginia had been able to get together. She came in and announced herself with a semi teasing question.<br />
<br />
&quot;You seem to have slept well,&quot; Melissa spoke as she entered the kitchen.<br />
<br />
&quot;I did,&quot; Harold answered while relishing the scent of ham and gets that he was cooking. He had enough in the pan for two and the bread was out and ready to be toasted. &quot;And there are only two days until Virginia is here in the mornings, too, today and tomorrow. Then we&#39;ll be a family of three.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And I&#39;m glad for that,&quot; Melissa answered, &quot;she&#39;s smart, polite, and she&#39;s made you happy. Not a bad thing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Harold nodded, &quot;and I can only barely wait.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just be patient, dad,&quot; Melissa said with a small smile before pushing the lever for the toaster down for her toast and then one for her father&#39;s toast, &quot;I&#39;m sure there&#39;s still some preparation stuff for when the next college semester begins...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m actually pretty good there,&quot; Harold answered, &quot;I&#39;ve gotten stuff turned in for my classes in the spring semester well in hand and the appropriate book orders in place for that semester. And that won&#39;t actually start until February.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;February?&quot; Melissa wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah... they have an interim type session in January after their Christmas break that only goes about a month, but they don&#39;t prep for that until Christmas break and I don&#39;t have a lone class for that,&quot; Harold answered, &quot;so for right now... there isn&#39;t too much that I can do but wait. It&#39;ll make Christmas break rather hectic, but I&#39;ll manage, and I may get a volunteer to help move in the books and things I&#39;d have in the college office when I can set that up.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You mean draftee,&quot; Melissa rolled her eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Very funny,&quot; Harold rolled his eyes while then getting out two plates. He also handed Melissa a glass to let her get some water, milk, or juice, &quot;and do you have anything today? Aside from this herd meeting in the evening?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The meeting will be the big thing,&quot; Melissa answered, &quot;though I would want to see if Rachel made it back home okay. As... I didn&#39;t expect her to have been so late that her dad would be tracking her down, particularly it is clear that the Mandatory Were Law wouldn&#39;t be an issue for the Van Direstags.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So, you&#39;ll be going in early?&quot; Harold asked her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Melissa answered and looked at the clock over the oven and seeing it read 7:10 AM.<br />
<br />
Breakfast then went well, and Melissa ultimately then made her way out. The walk hadn&#39;t been too hard and Melissa found she liked it. In some ways, it also felt more and more like she was truly part of Moon Lake&#39;s community, even though she&#39;d only been in Moon Lake for a few weeks and hadn&#39;t even been a were for a week. She saw a couple others walking and even a bus running its route along those straight streets. Her mind, though, focused on her friend Rachel Van Direstag. The two of them had been friends in Michigan and now both were here in Moon Lake, and Rachel had taken the whole &quot;were&quot; thing surprisingly well, though it seemed that her father had been more the worry at first. Though, that had to have changed now that Richard Van Direstag was a werelion.<br />
<br />
But drama surrounding her friend from Michigan seemed to remain, as Rachel seemed more open to becoming a were, and noting the changes Melissa had gone through as part of the reason. In the wake of all the things that Alice Decrux had pulled to try and get her father and get even with her, Melissa tended to be sympathetic to what Rachel wanted and gave her friend the best advice to avoid that sort of problem. Though, Melissa also figured that Rachel&#39;s parents might also become more open to that issue after her father became a were, but that was proven wrong when Richard Van Direstag showed up at the Jenkins front door looking for Rachel. That could be another problem, though Melissa had been fairly certain that things would be fine. All the same she still wanted to be in early to be able to talk to Rachel when she arrived, likely with her younger brother.<br />
<br />
Though as the high school came into view, she found a different if still friendly face waiting on the steps to the High School. Or rather, she found two familiar and friendly faces. One was her boyfriend and the werebull that turned her, and whom she&#39;d found herself deeply in love with him, Trevor Tyson, and the other was his younger sister, Anna Belle. Trevor stood quietly while Anna Belle was almost hoping up and down while trying to contain her energy. It left Melissa giving a bit of a smile as she approached.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, Trevor, Anna Belle,&quot; Melissa said politely, &quot;anything going on?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just my birthday,&quot; Anna Belle smiled, &quot;and thus will mean a party and a formal herd meeting. You&#39;ll be there, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Trevor gave me the invitation last night,&quot; Melissa answered and looked back to Trevor, &quot;would I need to bring a robe or anything?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not really... the herd meeting that would recognize you and Anna Belle as members would happen after the birthday party,&quot; Trevor answered, &quot;and would be at the ranch, thus any robe big enough for your were form wouldn&#39;t be needed.&quot;<br />
<br />
Melissa accepted that, though one thing caught her attention, &quot;recognizing Anna Belle... would that mean she&#39;d have her first transformation on her birthday?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe... and some of that leaves me curious and nervous at the same time,&quot; Anna Belle admitted, &quot;but a lot of that is also hard to predict.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We know that a born were will have their first transformation usually around their fourteenth birthday, but exactly when is harder to predict,&quot; Trevor answered, &quot;mine came about a week after my fourteenth birthday. Megumi had hers about a day after her fourteenth birthday, and my dad said his happened about a month after his. And there could be some rare occasions where it could happen earlier...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So... you could transform at school... couldn&#39;t you...?&quot; Melissa blinked to Anna Belle and then to Trevor.<br />
<br />
&quot;The school has a safe room to help when a student might go into their first transformation during the day or at school,&quot; Anna Belle answered, &quot;but no... just like after you and Trevor had your first special cuddle and you began to transform... a born were cannot control their first transformation. It happens when it happens. The thing that has me more nervous will be what I&#39;d look like. Would I be a dairy werecow like you or a beef werecow like the herd&#39;s other Anna...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The one from the Halloween Dance,&quot; Trevor offered to Melissa.<br />
<br />
&quot;Or a mixed beef/diary werecow, like my mom,&quot; Anna Belle answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll be fine, regardless of what breed your fursona is based on,&quot; Melissa offered, and then looked to Trevor, &quot;is there anything I&#39;d need to bring?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not really,&quot; Trevor answered, &quot;if you need anything from home, Anna Belle and I can drive you to get it and then head back to the ranch. We can work on homework while waiting for the party to start and while my folks deal with any herd members that might come for the herd meeting and show up early. I was waiting out here to let you know that we&#39;d be there to help with everything.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And I&#39;m here to say hi,&quot; Anna Belle answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;And that&#39;s very sweat,&quot; Melissa smiled, &quot;and thank you. And I don&#39;t have anything going on after school immediately. My dad is okay with it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So... we&#39;ll see you after school?&quot; Trevor asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course,&quot; Melissa smiled, and then looked on to the school&#39;s front doors, &quot;are the doors open yet?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t think so, though they should open in a few minutes to let everyone in,&quot; Trevor nodded, &quot;why do you ask?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Have you seen Rachel?&quot; Melissa asked, &quot;her dad came by my house last night before you arrived... and seemed worried about her not showing up for dinner or something along those lines. I thought I&#39;d told you about this last night...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe...&quot; Trevor scratched his head, &quot;but, no, I have not seen her.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So, we can wait a bit for them,&quot; Melissa nodded.</p>
