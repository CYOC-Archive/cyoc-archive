<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Norman, who was now walking around his bed and looking at Brian with curiosity. He wondered what he could do, a part of him feeling slightly bad for turning his friend into what could easily be a slave. Then an idea came into his head. “Brian, answer me truthfully…” Brian straightens up, still struggling against the hypnosis. “What do you want? What is your most desired thought right now?” <br />
<br />
“I… I…Want…” Brian struggles, his voice cracking from the spell’s force. “To help you…” <br />
<br />
Norman gives a slight smile, “Oh, Brian. Brian. Brian. Always the noble soul. You need to learn to let your wild side out….” Norman then gets an idea. “No what, let’s see the extent of my new power…” <br />
<br />
Norman stands back in front of Brian, his eyes glowing. “Brian… To aid in your desire, your wild side will come out. Let the beast inside your heart, inside your body, inside your soul, come out now. Let your body manifest into this form, for all to see. Release yourself to make your desire a reality!” <br />
<br />
Brian grunts as Norman blanks to end his chant. Brian’s body starts to feel warm, the eleven-year-old struggling on the edge of the bed. “Gerr Gerrrrrr” Brian groans as his chest starts to push out into his shirt. His muscles tense, growing under the fabric. A tent starts to form in his pants, drawing Norman’s attention. <br />
<br />
“Oh, is someone enjoying this?” Norman teases as he moves his hand down to Brian’s pants. He unzips the zipper and opens the front of Brian’s briefs to let out his young member. As the boy’s cock hits the air, Brian lets out what could be called a howl, as the cock starts to push forward and harden. His foreskin pulls back, as the tip grows pointed and redder. Inside his pants still, the foreskin forms the beginning of a sheath, a knot growing inside the sheath and his young balls growing between his thighs. <br />
<br />
“Please… Stop…” Brian tries to say before the sound of his clothes ripping covers his voice. He falls forward off the bed and onto his hands and knees. His new canine cock was still visible to Norman, growing and bobbing under Brian. <br />
<br />
The back of his shirt starts to rip as his sleeves tear to the floor. His fingernails grow dark, as his fingers thicken and pads form on his palms and fingers. His butt flairs out, tearing his pants at the seams while a mixture of brown and blond fur covers his body. A tail slowly pokes out of the tearing openings of the pants just as his feet’s claws burst out the front of his shoes.  His shoes are then stretched out as his foot lengthens, bursting when the toes and soul of his feet expand out to massive proportions that are needed to hold up his growing frame. His legs and thighs then expand out to meet his new feet and ass, his wolf tail bobbing from side to side. His muscles are just visible under his fur. <br />
<br />
His chest then flares out, his shoulders and arms widening then thickening with muscle. A loud groan leaves his lips as the remnants of his shirt drop to the floor. His brown and blond fur thickens, moving up his neck to his face. Brian lets out a snarl as his teeth turn to fangs and his face starts to push out into a muzzle. His nose turns to a wet leather, widening and sniffing. His ears grow pointed, sliding to the top of his head and are covered in black fur. As his face continues to turn canine, lips turning black and tongue lengthening, a new sensation comes from his groin. <br />
Norman’s smiles grows as he sees Brian’s cock push forward, releasing its knot. Pre starts to leak from the tip, the cock bobbing from Brian’s shaking and growing body. Veins become visible as it thickens more, the pre dripping on Brian’s torn clothes. As his changes finish, Brian lets out another howl, his cock cumming over the floor, leaving a large puddle of his new canine seed. <br />
<br />
“So, you did like that?” Norman teases before demanding Brian to stand up. The now wolf boy slowly and unsteadily stands at his feet. His cock was still dripping and hard as could be but was pointing downward from its new weight. Its massive eight inches would look large on a normal eleven-year-old, but Brian was now about eighteen inches taller or more, his body covered in muscle and fur. His balls hung between his legs, refilling from their release. His claws on his now pawed hands and feet glisten in the light of the bedroom, Norman taking a hand and feeling over the pads. “Nice and soft, though I think they could be useful for other things.” He snickers. <br />
<br />
Brian’s fluffy tail goes straight just as Norman turns away from the wolf boy. His eyes glowed white again, the last of the spell now taking effect. Norman’s spell was to change Brian’s body to help with his desire. And his desire was to help Norman. But the term “Help” was different for the two boys. Norman saw it as Brian become even more of a slave, but Brian saw it as trying to turn Norman back into the carrying boy he was before. <br />
<br />
Brian’s mind and body control return to him, he flexing his padded fingers and looking down at the rod that now hung from his groin. He felt every hair of fur on his body now, slowly understanding how his new body works. He looks at Norman’s back, trying to decide what to do next with his returned freedom.</p>
