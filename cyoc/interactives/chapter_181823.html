<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;We need time to recover, think of a plan, get used to life on the move&quot; said Lina looking at the map before turning to Catherine, then waddling over to the controll panel, placing her hand upon it, pulling our some loose wires,<br />
<br />
Linas snake like eyes returned and green mist seeped out from her fingertips connecting to the trains interface, all of a sudden Lina could FEEL the train as if it were her own body, she could feel every component, every bolt, every wire, she instantly knew the entire trains layout and functional capabilities, not only that but she could move the trains components just as easily as flexing a finger.<br />
<br />
Suddenly Lina was snapped out of her trance by a solid kick in the ribs from Luna, &quot;apparently not everyone is accepting of my new gift&quot; chuckled Lina as she petted her belly, she then turned to Cathrine, &quot;we need the construction on the lounge and accommodation cars completed, the greenhouse is getting more power than it needs, I need you to diverted all excess power to the energy bank and the nursery cars repares are still incomplete, were going to need that finished&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;Seems your going to fit this roll well&quot; came Sofias voice, Lina turned to see her leaning against the wall to the doorway, she then waddled over to Lina and embraced her &quot;my sister would be proud of you&quot; she said, Lina huged Sofia back &quot;and you, none of this would be possible if not for you, your sister was proud of you&quot; said Lina as Sofia began to cry, a cry of mourning, of loss, of grief, it covered her like a sheet but not enveloping her &quot;so I&#39;m guessing  we&#39;re not going back are we?&quot; Said Lucy, Violet sighed as she put her babies in a new basket that sat atop a circular footrest &quot;I don&#39;t think we CAN, the policies tech has gone crrrrrrrazy, turrrrrned on them like a rrrrrrabid dog&quot; said Violet with a hiss &quot;and I bet SHE was the reason&quot; said Viki as she pointed to the paused image of the blue must woman.<br />
<br />
&quot;And for some reason she had her stair locked on Echo&quot; said Lina as she shivered at the thought of what could have happened had Echo not intervened &quot;well if she wants our baby she&#39;s got three mama bears to get through&quot; said Viki as she and Lucy walked from the table to the front console as Lucy nodded in agreement.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey guys we&#39;ve got movement in the city&quot; said Sofia as she stared at the holographic screen, it had only been five hours but the image that greeted them was completely different from before<br />
<br />
The blue mist tendrals had scaled the buildings, intertwining with eachother to create webs, giant mist webs from building to building, the thin layer of mist that had hung on the floor was now a thick blanket that rose to the second floor of each building, the only signs of life were the shuffling beams of light from the peoples eyes and mouths.<br />
<br />
The camera switched to a what should have been the fountain at the center of the city, but there was no fog, the road around where the fountain should have been was clear, with walls of blue fog covering every exit, now what greeted the camera instead of the fountain, was her, the blue mist woman, her midsection now engorged to monstrous proportions to her body, many cords of blue mist emerging from her pussy and snaking across the floor, into the walls of fog, that&#39;s when they all saw how her womb had not burst with the amount of offspring it now contained &quot;what the hell has she done to my tech!?&quot; Shouted Sofia.<br />
<br />
The woman had melded with what looked to be a blend of every model Sofia had created, her body being see-through revealed all the tubes and wires being pumped full of her mist, then one of her tendrals tightened and began to reel in, then moments later a woman emerged from the fog, the mist connected to her stomach like an umbilical cord &quot;no way, what kind of creature is that&quot; said Viki as they watched the woman be consumed and sent into the mist woman&#39;s womb, regressing and morphing at an alarming rate &quot;she&#39;s like.........a queen ant of sorts, the people are her workers, building her webs, her nest and she makes the soldiers with our tech&quot; said Lina with one hand covering her belly and the other clutched tightly around Lucy&#39;s hand &quot; she&#39;s building an army from what&#39;s left of humanity, whether there dolls or molds&quot;<br />
<br />
Then the woman&#39;s head snapped to face the camera, she attempted to move towards it but her massively swolen womb kept her in place, then her blue mist pooled out of her back, then morphed into six spiderlike legs, she then used them to heave herself off the ground, then used one to spear the traffic camera, ending the feed &quot;she realy doesn&#39;t want us to see what shes up to&quot; said Lina, the others nodded in agreement &quot;ok then, everyone knows what needs to be done, so let&#39;s get it done&quot; said Lina as everyone nodded and headed towards the door<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh Catherine, Sofia I need you two to stay, I have an upgrade for the console in mind&quot;<br />
<br />
(One week later)<br />
<br />
Lina was interfaced with the train, the new hand shaped console, that Sofia and Catherine had installed was much safer than placing her hand on live wires, yet still gave her full control over the entire train, the cameras to the city had all been taken out the day after the group saw the &quot;queen&quot; as they now knew her and without Intel they agreedthe best courseof action would be to bide theirtime and see what she would do, their supply stocks had never been better,the greenhouse supplying them all with enough produce and synthetic meat each day, which resulted in the feeders being able to produce more than enough milk for the babies wich Echo did not mind one bit, and boy Lina had learned quickly what an appetite that girl had gotten since that day in the tunnel. And thanks to Sofias revolutionary 3d printers ant repares to molds or equipment was easy as it could be, the accommodation and lounge cars were just about complete construction wise, the interior was amazing<br />
<br />
The lounge had white sofas that folded into beds, with white silk curtains draped either side, a polished oak floor with pink and purple pattern carpets satvin the center with a carbon coloured coffee table <br />
in the center the left side of the car was all one big glass window with white arches lining the bottom, almost like a baby safety rail, the right wall was lined with mahogany planks that were also polished, with various plant life on shelves and a wall mounted TV. <br />
<br />
Lina had found that most of the girls who had come with them now used the lounge instead of the accommodation cars, that being understandable being as the car had no furniture at the moment, Lina then decided to disconnect from the ship, the mist retracting back into her finger tips, she leaned back in her chair with a sigh, soon realising that her headrest had gotten alot more sqishy.......and slightly wet? With a deep sigh Lina opened her eyes and looked up to see Lucy&#39;s smiling face, and her breasts either side of Linas head, Lina then gave a playful grin, and squeezed Lucy&#39;s breasts together, jets of milk shooting out, causing Lucy to moan loudly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok you two save it for later&quot; said Sofia from the sofa, a grin on her face as she draped a hand across her swolen womb &quot;there are children present&quot; she smiled looking towards the carpet<br />
<br />
Lina followed her gaze, seeing Misty playing with Echo, Echo had a grumpy look on her face as she saw good milk going to waste, this caused Lina to laugh, then she smiled maternaly at the two of them playing, over the past week with Catherine and Violet being busy with sex children, Lina, Violet and Lucy had in a way adopted Misty into their family, it wasn&#39;t that Violet and Catherine didn&#39;t care or love her anymore, it was that they couldn&#39;t look after Misty enough, they couldn&#39;t give her the love and attention she deserves with six extra babies around, so they asked Lina to become Mistys new mother of sorts, to care for her when they couldn&#39;t.<br />
<br />
And how could Lina refuse, just then a kick interrupted her train of thought, Lina gazed down and stroked her belly trying to calm Luna &quot;I know you want to play with your sisters, oh how I wish you were all in me together, then you all would never be apart&quot;.<br />
<br />
(Back in the city) <br />
<br />
The Queen was laying there enjoying the feeling of her brood squirming around in her improved womb as she gave a sigh, then she herd them, those infernal words, from HER! &quot;I wish&quot; her voice echoed on the wind, the voice of the medallion wielder, then her eyes shot open and her brood thrashed around, as she was forced to let out a burst of mist and shot it in the direction of the wishes source, the ball of mist whent sailing over the buildings and through the dome of fog, before reaching the outside, it then took off like a bullet in a straight line towards the wishes source, towards HER,<br />
<br />
The Queen  to put it plainly was not happy, she let out a scream and a small swarm of her soldiers took flight and followed swiftly after it with a look of pure rage on her face, she wanted to find them, and make them hers.<br />
<br />
Back on the train, Lina  felt the world go still, a whizzing sound getting louder by the second &quot;oh no&quot; was all Lina could say before the ball of blue mist crashed into the train, its blue tendrals seeping through the metal and shot towards Lina.<br />
<br />
They all shot towards her pussy, the blue mist forcing her legs apart, before ramming deep into her womanhood, almost like it was getting sucked in, but lina was in no condition to think straight, her mind was pure bliss as the mist forced its way deeper and deeper, before all of it was stuffed inside her, Lina knew hat had caused this but she couldn&#39;t understand why, the question is now, would her wish be granted</p>
