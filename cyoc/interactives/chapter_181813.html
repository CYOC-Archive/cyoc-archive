<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">When Lina awoke it was in a different room, instead of the bridge, she was in what looked like a hospital room, her bed along with four others were big enough for two people all lining the left side, all pink with white trims, the floor was a ritch mahogany wood that looked smooth to the touch, looking at the side of the bed next to her she saw what looked like vitals panels displaying heart rate, oxygen levels, even a sonogram wand was slotted in down there, looking up she saw that the left side of the curved roof was made of glass, with black curved beams running over looking like a ribcage, that&#39;s when she noticed a bird, a bird that didn&#39;t appear to be moving, almost like the room was moving to meet the birds pace, that&#39;s when she remembered &quot;the train&quot; Lina whispered.<br />
<br />
The wall behind her had a type of ivy growing along it, with some type of pink flower blooming in bunches in certain patches, then lina looked beyond the foot of her bed and to the right side of the room was what looked like a foldout table like what the parts room had, with multiple pull out racks running along side it, with a familiar looking pair of goggles hanging up, then Lina herd a light snore, looking to her right she could see the silhouette of a person behind a satin certain, pulling it to the side she saw not one but three people all passed out cold<br />
<br />
In a white plastic chair sat Sofia, her head drooped down, and a light snore emitting from her as she slept, then looking on the bed she saw Violet on the bed, laying on her side, with Echo nursing from her, curled as close to her as she could.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey sleeping beauty&quot; whispered Viki as she gazed at Lina with a look of relief, Lina smiled at her &quot;Hey beautiful, how are two of the five most important people in the world doing&quot; she said before a strong kick hit her lungs from within, clutching her belly tight as she tried to refill her lungs, &quot;sorry I meant seven&quot; she giggled as she stroked her belly, Luna gazing out into the big wide world before yawning and returning to sleep<br />
<br />
&quot;We should be asking you that, you&#39;ve been out cold for five days&quot; said Viki as she got up, holding Echo close as to not disrupt her from eating as she did so, Lina on the other hand was in shock, it felt like a few hours since she passed out, then her mindset fell into the roll as this groups leader &quot;how have things been since I was out, is everyone OK?&quot; She asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Everything has been going well for the most part, iv transfered all my babies into one of the new girls of our group a few days ago, she should pop any day now&quot; said Viki giggling &quot;all the equipment has been working just fine, repares had to be made to the nursery car, that heat blast singed the back as well as two of the girls who were trying to protect the babies, but their fine now&quot; said Viki, placing a hand on Linas belly to keep her from getting up &quot;food and water supplies are staying in the green, for now we&#39;re self sufficient, and this one&quot; said Viki nodding towards Echo still latched on &quot;ever since she did that mystic mumbo jumbo may as well live attached to either my or Lucys breasts, she cries for feeding at least twelve times a day!&quot; Viki giggled as Echo looked around to Lina, reaching her hand out for her, Viki passed her to Lina who hugged her daughter close, Echo snuggling deeply into her plastic body.<br />
<br />
It was then that Vikis words realy sunk in, and she did a double take of her lover, her belly was indeed flat once again, but her breasts had gotten at least three cup sizes bigger, Viki saw her staring and cupped her hands under her new assets &quot;I asked Sofia to increase their capacity, it was the only way I could keep up with this black hole&quot; she said poking Echos rosy cheek, getting a high pitch giggle in reply.<br />
<br />
&quot;How&#39;s she holding up&quot; said Lina as she looked at Sofia, she reached a hand out stroking a hair from Sofia&#39;s face, Viki gave a sad sigh &quot;I don&#39;t think anyone has an answer for that, not even her, she hardly eats, she&#39;s dead on her feat, doesn&#39;t sleep, we had to force her to sit there last night, and as soon as her pregnant ass hit the pillow she was out like a light&quot; said Viki, as she looked over at her friend with worry in her eye &quot;and there&#39;s something else-&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;Viki if the Captain is up your needed on the bridge&quot; came Lucy&#39;s voice over the intercom, Viki Then reached over and opened a panel on the wall, pulling out what looked like a ham radio &quot;captains up, on our way&quot; she said as she put it back<br />
<br />
&quot;Captain?&quot; Lina questioned &quot;Yep your new tital, ain&#39;t it grate?&quot; Said Viki giving a sarcastic salute, Lina just laughed and got up out of the bed as Echo let out a yawn.<br />
<br />
&quot;Il take her to the nursery car for a nap, you get up to the bridge, sound like they need you&quot; said Viki as she took Echo to the door to the right, as it opened lina saw that it led to a greenhouse, with five or six other women inside, some were even carrying babies, but only in the singles, not one with multiples, Lina shook it off and walked towards the bridge.<br />
<br />
Lucy was the first to welcome her back from dream land  her midsection bulging out with what Lina guessed to be triplets, Lucy was sat at one of the tables around the round wooden table, a big smile on her face and her hands seemingly glued to her midsection, Lina walked over and kissed her deeply &quot;Hey you, your mold seems to be working again&quot; said Lina, Sofia kissed her back and patted the side of her belly, &quot;Yep turns out Catherine is just as much of a handy woman as Sofia, she opted in to give her a bit of a brake&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Finaly prrrrrrfect timing&quot; came a voice from the lounge, a pair of purple tied fluffy ears peaking over the top of the white sofa &quot;I&#39;d recognise thoese feline ears anyware, hi Violet how are- WOW!&quot; said Lina as she came around the side of the sofa, it was Violet alright but with six kitten like babies attached to each nipple along her still heavily swolen womb, Violet simply petted her swolen womb with her paw &quot;Yep i had the same rrrrrreaction honey, it would seem no matter how many I birth, every few months il be giving birrrrrrrth to anotherrrrrr adorrrrrable litter&quot; she purred.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey captain we need to tell you something urgent&quot; came Catherine&#39;s voice from the front of the bridge, as Lina waddled over Viki walked onto the bridge and gave Lucy a kiss before kissing her belly, Lucy&#39;s face turning red as she placed a hand ontop of Vikis head and pushed it down under her maternal swell, what Lina found curious was that everyone looked over to see what the sudden moaning was, then resumed their activities like everything was normal!<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess I have missed a bit&quot; muttered Lina as she aproched Cathrine, she was looking at a holographic map, an indicator for the train being shown to be one hundred and twenty miles away from capital city, however what caught Linas attention was the seventeen red markers moving away from the city, having only gone twenty miles, Catherine saw Lina looking at the map &quot; yes we are being hunted, but that&#39;s not what has us all worried&quot; said Catherine as she swiped the map away and replacing it with what looked like a traffic camera on the heart if the city, but something was wrong<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s wrong with those people........and where&#39;s the sun?&quot; Whispered Lina, looking out of the front window she could see the sun clear as day, being as they were above the clouds, but when she looked back at the camera footage, it was almost pitch black, except for the ominous blue glow coming from all the peoples eyes and mouths, a thin cloud of blue mist clung to the roads and sidewalks, armed tendrals seemed to be trying to scale the building walls, then the mist spiraled upwards in the middle of the cameras view, and there she was, the blue mist woman from the tunnel, she just stood there for a moment, swaying side to side, her head down and her hands folded over her midsection, before her head snapped up and her hand stretched up to reach the camera and crushed it.<br />
<br />
&quot;That was five hours ago, almost exactly when theis red indicators appeared, we have no idea what they are, neither does the trains bio scans&quot; said Catherine as she turned to Lina &quot;What are your orders, your our leader now after all......I your call&quot;</p>
