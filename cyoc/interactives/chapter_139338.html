<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“No! Come back you stupid beast!” Mark yells after the fleeing mare, before he places a hand on the recent injury and grimaces from pain. The attendant whipped him and raced behind Princess and Georgina immediately, leaving the dismounted officer alone in this section of forest.<br />
<br />
The anger turn to puzzlement and wonder when the wound close up and bristly hair start to grow where she inflicted the cut “What has she done to me now?” He started to scratch absentmindedly the slowly spreading fur on his face “I must move if I want to leave this place, now that the crazy attendant is busy elsewhere… This is my only chance, but I can’t follow after them or return to the stables, I suspect the results will not be pleasant” The ears grow pointed and migrate to the top of Mark’s head, flicking from time to time as a layer of brown fur cover them. <br />
“If that girl think that I will roll over and willing become a horse she is delusional”<br />
<br />
Fortunately for him a glancing blow from the whip was not enough to transform him immediately, the changes spread naturally much more slowly, requiring nearly an hour to finalize the transition to horse, provided that the afflicted didn’t hasten the curse.<br />
<br />
His ears perk up and rotate toward the direction of the stable to hear the sound of galloping mounts, that prompt Mark to hide behind a thick bush before a couple of attendants on horseback equipped with an alarming number of lassoes and halters whizz in the same direction taken by the first attendants. <br />
<br />
“That was close…”<br />
<br />
Mark returns in the center of the clearing and after carefully pondering his limited choices decides to head in the direction Sophie fled, for a lack of better plans. Before today he never visited the forest and zoo, and if he had a say about things this will be the last time, too.<br />
<br />
The man starts to follow the trail left by the mare when the changes continue, now focusing on his throbbing cock, increasing exponentially the sex drive. The pants tent as his tool twitch with suppressed arousal every step, while he tries to think about everything else, even as his hand involuntarily unfasten the pants zip to better access his shaft.<br />
Eventually the cock grow so much that the pants cannot hide nor contain it anymore, making the lower clothes a liability in the case of a chase. Mark discard them and his boxers with not a small amount of hesitation, uncovering an oversized and thick shaft for an human, hard for reasons unknown. The police officer is conflicted about the new size as he inspect it carefully, on one hand he is proud his cock grew so much, on the other his skin assumed a dark coloration and the head flattened, giving Mark no doubt that there is nothing human left in his genitals.  <br />
<br />
 ‘Hung like an horse indeed…’ His curiosity got the better of him when the man poked his erect member with a finger stifling a gasp when the shaft twitched in anticipation and desire. After that Mark forgot momentarily his problems and fears and started to stimulate his tool, stroking and caressing it in the haze of lust. He grunted as he leaned against a nearby tree before sliding on the floor when his mind crafted a fantasy world for his pleasure, all this while the officer jerked off.<br />
<br />
Mark was a sultan, and like every ruler he had a personal harem of girls ready to satisfy his every whim, this was in fact one such day when his favorite and skilled lover twirled before him in a typical belly dancer outfit, spinning around on her feet to finally lands on the sultan’s awaiting hug. The little minx lifted her veil, exposing her beautiful face, to give a chaste kiss on his cheek, before playfully slipping away from the embrace and challenging Mark to a game of chase, promising a befitting reward at the end. As the girl then proceed to disappear inside the nearby labyrinth he cross the main section of the gardens, filled with many of his harem girls idling around, relaxing and gossiping. Most waved and flaunted their chest as he passed, and a pair of twin grabbed each one of his arms and tried to pull him toward a secluded area, giggling among themselves about a group of eager girls requiring his mindful ministration. Of course, Mark already had a target in mind and after telling them such the two pouting girls backed down, not before wresting a promise to join them in the foreseeable future.<br />
<br />
The other ones giggled and directed him to the direction of the elusive girl, not that the sultan would have required their help anyway as soon as he entered the maze the sound of singing reached the threshold. Following the music he reached the center of the small labyrinth after a few turn to find his lover, seated on a stone bench, and entirely focused on the equine statue near her position. The sound of the ruler’s steps alert his quarry, that stand up and approach the man with a sultry gait.<br />
<br />
This girl is his, and the sultan is hers. There are no more word needed to complete the moment, and the sultan lean down for a well-deserved kiss, lifting the veil that was concealing her visage, to come face to face with… the brown muzzle of an horse?<br />
<br />
The mare giggles at his expression, and taking advantage of the momentary confusion she whispers that her knight in shining armor could obtain the just reward under the gazebo in the main garden. The maiden before him was no more, replaced by a small brown mare that proceeded toward the exit, throwing a last lust filled glance his way. It was difficult for Mark to not find the mare still enticing, his erection attested that he was very interested in her proposal, and the way she swayed those firm flanks of her as he looked didn’t help. The filly paused just before disappearing behind the corner, turning toward Mark for a wink and shifting her tail to the side to give him a passing peek to her wet folds, ensuring that the sultan was painfully aware of the stiff member between his legs, before trotting away with a last laugh.<br />
<br />
Mark wanted her. That last act was the tipping point for him, he didn’t care anymore if she was an horse, and pursued the fleeing mare without any thoughts. As the sultan left the maze the premises he passed before were not the same, minutes ago a multitude of maidens occupied the gardens, while now only a herd of mares remained. The tables filled with exotic foods were nowhere to be seen, instead he spotted various troughs and drinkers for the now equine crowd. There were brown mares, black beauties and fiery crimson fillies, some laying there in the grass, others feeding from the troughs, while more discussed between them about this and that. One thing grouped together all the female horses before him, every mare had on an ornate bridle of some sort, some focusing to more lavish colors and patterns, while the more demure ones aimed to a more conservative apparels. <br />
<br />
With this crowd the smell that reached the man after he ventured between the herd was befitting more for a stable, but instead of being repulsed by the strong scent he found it calming and quite pleasant. He was in the process of walking beside a tall black mare posing before a wide mirror, inspecting the gaudy harness she wore amid the cacophony of comments and suggestions from her fellow onlookers when she drew attention to him.<br />
<br />
“Oh, sultan, what an honor” The filly bowed to the ruler, followed by the other mares “Do you like my new halter? This is the main trend in the far west”<br />
<br />
The man was not sure of himself when he responded “It’s, ah, lovely my dear”<br />
<br />
“Oh my king, you flatter me… What brings our fair ruler outside today? Here to entertain yourself with us?” Here she licked her lips and whispered softly “I still own the alluring saddle you insisted I wear in our last session, by your own admission it was easier and more pleasurable to mount me with that saddle.&quot; There is a knowing and playful glint on her eyes &quot;I only need a few minutes to fetch the garment, and then we can mate together behind the bushes near the pond like the time you took my virginity…” The black temptress circled around the sultan to finally linger on your tented pants “Are you ready to match those feats of virility?” The mare directed her big doe eyes to him ”With little old me?” It was at this moment that Mark noticed that two mares flanked and rubbed against him, barring every avenue of escape.<br />
<br />
“Another time perhaps. I have already a date waiting for me” The fillies against his side made disappointed whinnies before stepping back and bidding him good day. The longing in his voice was not missed by anyone though. <br />
<br />
“A shame, my king. I will await with bated breath the next time you will visit my stall then” With a nod the man dismiss the pushy horse and start to climb the steps to the agreed meeting spot, all the while trying to reluctantly dismiss the many images of the previously assembled mares bound and harnessed only for his pleasure, with the mentioned saddle strapped on more than one female.<br />
<br />
His mouth was dry when he reached the peak to find his promised mate already in position, tied by her harness to a wooden post like a common beast and sporting a saddle of her own, decorated with various floral pattern.<br />
<br />
“My stud, you are finally here. Take me like the animal I am, mount me like a mare in heat! I am at your disposal…” The filly before the ruler presented her twitching folds by shifting the long tail to the side, launching a few drops of her juices with the sudden movement, and exposing her moist nether region and haunches, that became more and more wet the more time passed.<br />
<br />
The sound of heavy breathing was the only thing he could hear and as he approached the unexpected noise of hard hoof impacting wood reached his ears, prompting Mark to inspect his feet.  ‘Wait, when did I become a horse?’ The sultan’s body was not human anymore, now a proud stallion stood on alert, with a pelt as black as night and a white mane and tail as well. Being on all four was a novel experience to him, and even after his hooves took his first steps and his mind screamed that the sensation of a hoof felt strange and alien against the wooden floor, he dismissed every concern to admire the helpless lover before him. It did not matter anymore if he changed, he was a stud and she was a mare, there was nothing else to be said.<br />
<br />
After a few moment the stallion landed on the back of the female, completely enthralled by her beauty and pheromones, and attempted to line his stiff shaft to her wetness. Too excited and aroused to take thing calmly the stud needed more than one try to finally place the tip of his cock against the blackened lips of the filly, that even now begged loudly to shove his shaft inside her roughly. With a loud and victorious whinny Mark plunged his tool inside of her.<br />
<br />
The sensation was magnificent. The warm folds of her vagina parted to allow easy access to his tool, clamping on his shaft every time Mark slapped his balls against her haunches. Every thrust was bliss as the mare was clearly experienced and followed the pace given by the male. Mark picked up the pace further and further, helped by new instincts he never had before, while his tail swished left and right in mounting arousal. The time of soft kisses and word was history, now the two were locked in an animalistic dance fueled by lust and desire, no better than the countless common beasts that mated from the dawn of time. They were both in the brink of a powerful orgasm after their session of mating, it only needed a bit more…<br />
<br />
Mark came in the real world and the fantasy with a muffled whinny at the same time, launching several globs of horse cum on the grass, before he shook himself from the daydreaming and stopped to stroke his cock, catching his breath in the meantime.<br />
<br />
“oh, wow, that was… very good”<br />
<br />
The daydreaming was a bit too intricate and had a suspiciously perfect  timing to be only conjured by his imagination by chance… <br />
<br />
‘Could there be something that urged this fantasy and other of the same kind in the wood?’ The police officer mused while he panted in exhaustion, before his eyes widened after he looked down on the floor. His feet were no more, transformed instead in the familiar shape of hooves exactly like in the dream, while his entire body now stood covered entirely by a soft black pelt, in direct contrast to the white locks that made up his mane and reached the shoulders. His ears swirled at the sound of shifting grass, caused by the new white tail casually lying on the floor. In desperation he grabbed his new white appendage in fear, pulling strongly with his hands and bringing about only a stab of pain from the base of his back, confirming that the tail is undoubtedly tied to his body.<br />
<br />
“I’m almost an horse… I am doomed”<br />
<br />
Shaken, the man stood up and after a grimace directed to the puddle of semen on the grass he continues to walk in a more brisk pace toward the path “No, this is not happening to me! I don’t want to change into a common beast. Keep it together Mark, there is still time left, there must exist a cure! The stables, surely there must be something there…” The officer stops to reconsider “But can I really evade all the attendants? This plan is too risky”</p>
