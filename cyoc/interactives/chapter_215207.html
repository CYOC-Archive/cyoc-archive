<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Try and find that dividing line,&quot; Nancy said. &quot;Okay,&quot; Doug shrugged. &quot;When amd where?&quot; Nancy rubbed her chin, she had an idea but she needed to think about it. &quot;Tomorrow at school,&quot; she said. &quot;Meet me before homeroom okay?&quot; Doug nodded the pair exchanging a quick kiss before getting back in the car.<br />
<br />
By the time Doug got to school that morning, he had already lived through a rather surreal experience. Returning home after dropping Nancy and Dickie off he was greeted by his new family. Doug&#39;s little brothers as well as his big sister were waiting when he got home. Apparently with his new parents out of town, his sister Amanda was staying with them. Amanda, Doug learned, was a Sophmore at the local university. The 19 year old, helping out her little brother as they cared for the twins. Honestly Doug didn&#39;t mind, but it was rather odd finding himself once more forced to follow household rules that were not his own. As he spotted Nancy, he smiled as he quickly approached. &quot;Hey morning how was your night?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Really, really, weird,&quot; Nancy giggled. &quot;But a good weird if that makes sense.&quot; Doug gazed at her curiously, wondering what she was going on about. &quot;I&#39;m sure you noticed too,&quot; she sighed. &quot;Being treated like a kid. It was bizarre! My parents, well the ones I have now, they had me do chores around the house. Even made sure I double checked my homework, not to mention a bedtime!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A bedtime?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well yeah,&quot; Nancy blushed. &quot;I mean it&#39;s not like I go to bed at eight or something. But, when I was going to bed last night at my usual 10 p.m. my dad asked why I was going to bed so early. He said he usually doesn&#39;t tell me to turn the lights off til 11.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay that&#39;s....different.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah it surprised me too,&quot; Nancy grinned. &quot;Also crazy how I have to live under someone else&#39;s rules again. I haven&#39;t had rules since I was...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A kid,&quot; Doug finished. &quot;Yeah that threw me off too. My sister is home from college. It&#39;s weird getting bossed around again. I haven&#39;t had to live by anyone else&#39;s rules since I started living on my own.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Guess it&#39;s the downside of being young,&quot; Nancy shrugged. Doug nodded in agreement, living under another adults supervision was going to take some getting used too.  &quot;So,&quot; Doug asked looking to change the subject.&quot; Whats your plan for testing the divide?&quot; Nancy smirked, pulling out her schedule as she now drew Doug&#39;s attention.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay we have a couple of opportunities,&quot; she said. &quot;The first one is ironically first period. I&#39;m in Geometry while you&#39;re in English. We&#39;re probably about 20 yards from eachother since the classes are right across the hall.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay so I change my Engliah teacher Mrs. Campbell,&quot; Doug stated. &quot;So the question is how old should she be?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Freshman,&quot; Nancy said quickly. &quot;I remember Sharon Campbell when I was the Principal. Honestly she&#39;s kind of a bitch. I have a feeling she was one of those mean girls in high school. She needs a reset and I would rather not have her older than me. It&#39;s real hard to be nasty with anyone older than you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Freshman it is then,&quot; Doug stated. &quot;So what do we after that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well if I remember her being an adult we widen the circle,&quot; Nancy stated. &quot;We have a couple other classes near each other. We know I won&#39;t remember anything at 30 yards but if I remember at 20 then we at least know how far the ring goes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And if you don&#39;t remember?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then we&#39;ll see how close I have to be,&quot; Nancy said. The sound of the bell now signaled the start of first period. As Doug and Nancy hurried towards class, they paused in the hallway. Nancy giving Doug a peck on the cheek as she now entered her class. &quot;Good luck,&quot; she called.<br />
<br />
As Doug entered English, he quickly noticed Sharon Campbell standing towards the front of the class. Sharon was his age (or his old age of 57 before this all started). When Doug had been the principal he recalled the middle age woman not giving him any problems. Thinking about it though, Doug began to put two and two together.<br />
<br />
Sharon saw women as competition, she got along just fine with male coworkers or even younger colleagues. Women that were her equal or older were competion. Sharon wanted to be the best and in the reality where Nancy had been the elderly principal, Sharon viewed her as a rival she needed to get rid of to further her career. &quot;I get it now,&quot; Doug whispered. &quot;You gave Nancy a hard time before because YOU wanted the principal job.&quot; He now chuckled as he gazed at the blonde woman, in a moment she would be years away from even having a career. &quot;I wish Sharon Campbell was a 14 year old Freshman.&quot;<br />
<br />
Doug glanced at the coin, watching it glow as his wish began to take affect. A ripple now spread out from the coin, the wave causing Sharon to freeze as the changes commenced.<br />
<br />
Sharon&#39;s face began too smooth, the slight wrinkles and bags under the womans eyes fading as she crept backwards in age. Passing 5o, Doug noticed her body begin to firm. The cellulite around her hips slowly melting away as her modest breasts began to rise under her blouse. Gazing at the womans shoulder length hair, he watched as it seemed to brighten. As Sharon raced back through her 40s, Doug noticed her hair become brighter, the greys that had melded so seamlessly into her blonde locks vanishing causing it to appear more vibrant.<br />
<br />
As Sharon reentered her 30s, Doug&#39;s jaw dropped as he gazed at the woman, Sharon was gorgeous. At 57, she had been an attractive woman with a reasonably fit body. Now entering her prime, Doug beheld a stunningly beautiful woman. Sharon&#39;s face was flawless, her hair vibrant and golden, her body possessing a fit yet curvy appearance with full C cup breasts that seemed to strain the womans blouse. With the loss of each year, Sharon&#39;s beauty only seemed to be magnified.<br />
<br />
&quot;Holy hell,&quot; Doug whispered, his cheeks burning as he gazed at the sexy 30 year old at the head of the class. &quot;She looks amazing!&quot; Doug couldn&#39;t help but gawk at the woman now, she looked like a runway model or every teenage boys fantasy teacher. He now wondered how any guy taking her class could possibly focus on her lessons.<br />
<br />
Sharon&#39;s beauty only increased as she sped through her 20s. The womans face losing its sultry sexiness as she crept closer to college. Doug now beheld a blonde beauty,  Sharon&#39;s crystal blue eyes sparkling, her face rounding slightly as she crept further back in adulthood. The womans breasts impossibly perky C cups restrained under her blouse. The now 20 year old Sharon&#39;s curves decreasing ever so slightly, giving her a thin waist with a firm and curvy ass and breasts. &quot;She looks like a sorority girl,&quot; Doug thought. <br />
<br />
As Sharon crept backwards into her teenage years, Doug continued to watch her transformation. Sharon&#39;s face continued to round, her curves now melting away as she left college behind and became a high school Senior once more. Sharon was still gorgeous. Healthy golden blonde hair cascaded past her shoulders, her face rounding but transitioning from sexy to cute. The teens breasts began to diminish now, barely clinging to C cups as she left Senior year and reentered her Junior. &quot;I wonder if she&#39;s a cheerleader,&quot; Doug mused.<br />
<br />
As Sharon left Junior year behind, Doug watched the teen in surprise. Sharon&#39;s curves were rapidly melting away now, the girls face rounding, settling into an innocently cute Sophmore. Sharon&#39;s breasts now finally reentered B cup territory, her curves diminishing. If Doug stopped her here, she would probably be the most popular girl in Nancy&#39;s class.<br />
<br />
Sharon&#39;s transformation now completed, the teen settling into a cute yet coltish looking 14 year old. Sharon was cute for a Freshman, a round innocent face, B cup breasts with flared hips, and silky golden blonde hair. The girls legs appeared a little on the thin side, but Doug had little doubt that the girl was already on the Freshman classes radar as the most attractive. <br />
<br />
Now Sharon&#39;s clothes began to change, Doug a bit surprised at the outfit the girl wore.  Instead of an eye catching outfit that would accentuate her attributes, Sharon sported a rather conservative attire. A slightly baggy peach colored tshirt with skinny jeans and white sneakers. The outfit was cute but nowhere near as eye catching as Doug thought she would wear. As reality adjusted itself, Doug saw Sharon blink before her face turned crimson as she saw him looking at her. As Doug&#39;s memories of this new reality filtered into his mind, his jaw dropped.<br />
<br />
Sharon was just shy of her 15th birthday and apparently had developed a rather huge crush on Doug. The girl though was still rather uncomfortable with her looks, she apparently had been a bit of a late bloomer, puberty having finally blessed her the summer before high school.<br />
<br />
Sharon was a shy, bookish, girl, turning down the advances of several popular students. Still single, some of the guys had already labeled her a prude while the girls shunned her out of fear she would steal their boyfriend. Doug&#39;s memories now told him that this bookish, shy Freshman did have one crush but was afraid to act because he was already dating someone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh shit,&quot; Doug gasped. &quot;Sharon Campbell has a crush on me!&quot; Doug now watched as the Freshman girl bolted from the classroom as she realized she had entered the wrong room. For Doug he now wondered of Nancy would remember the old Sharon Campbell and how she would react to the new one.</p>
