<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Again?&quot; Chester&#39;s maid rolled her eyes. &quot;The power to make them anything, and they go with something they could find and buy, this is just proof that Master is the best out of all of them... None of you understand Master&#39;s pain.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Says you twig and balloons,&quot; said Sal derisively. <br />
<br />
&quot;That personality being wiped will be quiet satisfying to Master this maid is certain,&quot; Chester&#39;s maid said. <br />
<br />
As the gamer chair was placed at the prize table, Lilly was the first to sit down. While she wasn&#39;t Amelia&#39;s mistress, she could do for now. <br />
<br />
&#39;Don&#39;t listen to them, welcome to the useful object club Amelia!&#39; Kylie said mentally.<br />
<br />
&#39;It is an honor to be here. Maybe mistress will turn you into a chat-headset when she defeats your owner.&#39; <br />
<br />
&#39;That ain&#39;t happening, Keith will win this!&#39;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nope! Big brother will win!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ll all love bein&#39; the boss&#39; harem dancers, trust me, he&#39;s great once you actually get o know him,&quot; Sal smiled. <br />
<br />
&#39;Prepare to be candy!&#39; <br />
<br />
&#39;It is obvious girls that we all want our owner to win, and are certain we exist in the timeline where their victory comes to be. But there is one way to find out who is correct and who is not.&#39; Amelia observed. Amelia wasn&#39;t really her name anymore, but she did have an Ego, and therefore, a name was a logical next step, and thus, using the most closely available name was only logical. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, so let&#39;s just be friends, we&#39;re all gonna be working together no matter who wins!&quot; Carly said. <br />
<br />
&quot;Heh, that&#39;s the spirit,&quot; Leona said laying down on her back on the prize table. <br />
<br />
&quot;I can see it you know... all fifteen of us and them... dancing for masters... for his shows, to entertain the people that he loves ... it&#39;ll be beautiful.&quot; Sal said in an almost transcendence voice. <br />
<br />
&quot;I can see us all together as family,&quot; Lilly said wistfully.<br />
<br />
&quot;I see you all purified as I am.&quot; Chester said. <br />
<br />
&quot;A fifteen item platter of soul treats for mistress&#39; demon benefactor to chow on!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Larry&#39;s Harem and Buck&#39;s work hands seemsalmost normal by comparison, eh?&quot; Leona asked Curly. <br />
<br />
&quot;Seems that way,&quot; the catgirl cowhand nodded. <br />
<br />
&#39;Only one of our owners&#39; dreams can come true here.&#39; &#39;Amelia&#39; &#39;spoke.&#39; &#39;We should prep ourselves for our existences except for one of us here will be very short ones indeed. In case I am no longer a wonderful gaming chair for master when this contest is done, I intend to contemplate my existence as much as I can before the end.&#39; <br />
<br />

<br />
There was the commercial for the public &#39;Transformation Lottery&#39;, anyone who entered to a certain quota would receive wealth, but one &#39;lucky&#39; &#39;winner&#39; would instead be transformed in some way that would serve the pubic. <br />
<br />
There was also an ad for a whole family trip to Kitty Land, where the park staff had long since all been turned into living plushies. The plushies had so much control over their property that the theme park was almost considered its own city state. The theme park had a very strict &#39;no doing naughty stuff while visiting&#39; policy. Children also ate and rod for free. Pregnant mothers were also granted free five-star hosting for their term (strangely the hotels always seemed to get bigger on the inside no matter how many guests they had). <br />
<br />
There was ordinary commercials for new flavors of soda that were actually factually in no way magically created, with the naked black furred cat girl in robber blade gear endorsing the product being the only transforming thing about it. While turning people into anthro shaped treats was technically legal, the public gave them all the warmth and acceptance of a tobacco company, taxed to an obscene degree, purposely obstructively regulated in the commercial sector, with public service messages denouncing them. The only reason it wasn&#39;t completely illegal was because no one wanted a repeat of prohibition. (As society had sadly been forced to accept the more you made something illegal, the more people wanted it with human psychology being what it was.)<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
&quot;Welcome back to Brainwashed Cat Girls The Game Show!  Now let&#39;s do a quick recap of round one! And reintroduce our players! <br />
<br />
From The Big Apple, New York City, New York… Chester Ratmann. Who managed to outwit the well rounded Bitty Fitzpatrick in an eating contest! Anything to say you two?&quot;<br />
<br />
Chester said, &quot;I&#39;m not gonna say I&#39;m here to take what&#39;s &#39;mine&#39;. My family lost what was theirs long before this. Dad, grandpa lost their jobs, my big brother lost who he was. I&#39;m here to make these other guys mine. And I have no need of the veneer that rest of you use to pretend your toys are still people.&quot; <br />
<br />
Chester maid made her now signature indignant huff and slide glanced at the camera as she stood next to her master. &quot;You&#39;re asking this maid? An object? For this maid&#39;s opinions? Don&#39;t make this maid laugh. An object has no opinions. Just as it had no need for a name or memories. This made is a tool, an extension of its master&#39;s will. And this maid is the most pure and unfiltered catgirl maid here.&quot; <br />
<br />
--<br />
&quot;And next up we have from Miami Florida, Brady Wakeman! Who surprised us all with him besting Scottish fireball Magda O’Hannigan with mind over matter in a test of raw strength!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh we&#39;re on? What? Right you want me to say something! Name&#39;s Brady Wakeman! And this here&#39;s my little sister Lilly Wakeman!&quot; <br />
<br />
The blond middle school cat-girl Lilly leapt right in the face of the camera and began waving happily, &quot;Hi mom! Don&#39;t worry! We&#39;ll be home soon! Promise!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I got what I came here for. Now I just gotta win three more times, and I get out with my sister and we can both just go home. ... Huh? Oh right. The fifteen others? Not sure mom&#39;s house could hold that much new family... But maybe we can still make it work. After all... family support each other.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lilly gave him a hug. <br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
&quot;And next from we have local high school freshman, Cloudcloud rapper, and skateboard pro Keith Luis! In a surprising amount of honorable contest, he defeated Arizona tomboy and roller derby champ Kylie Fulgore in an honorable race of rollerblades verses skateboard!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;YO! Ratmann! You jerk! Watch out! Because this round! You are going down! And Henrietta! You&#39;re next! And Savage! You better not get zapped before our fateful meeting! I wanna try my rappin&#39; against your heavy metal! Don&#39;t disappointment!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You tell&#39;em boss!&#39; The nude catgirl shaped microphone that was Kylie cheered from Keith&#39;s hands. &quot;Hey! Clawdia! Saw your commercial just now! Guess you&#39;re team captain now! Good luck out there!&quot;  <br />
<br />
--- <br />
<br />
&quot;And next up we have Randal “Savage” Coleman of Topeka! Heavy metal star! Who in a true battle of the bands managed to defeat Montana cowgirl Sally-Mae Schuester with the power of love no less!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, kid, you be careful out there too right?&quot; Randal said, leaving back in his chair as Sal stroked his chest. &quot;I almost wouldn&#39;t mind losing this gig if it was to you, just don&#39;t make a prop or somethin&#39;. But I&#39;m aiming to win too. I&#39;ve got a hot date with a hot beotch after this now!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You better not lose master, I&#39;m dying to see what the others all look like as hot exotic animal harem dancers!&quot; Sal said. <br />
<br />
&quot;If I lose, maybe at least you&#39;ll get to see what I look like as one babe.&quot; Randal replied with a smile of a man marching into battle knowing he could die. <br />
<br />
--<br />
<br />
&quot;And... we have Henrietta Winters... the teenage witch. Who we have checked did not put any false information on her entry form. The face of a child, the heart of a devil, she tricked totally eighteen high school alpha female Jennifer Smith into a game she couldn&#39;t win, and aims to do the same to turn them into sacrifices for demons to increase her own power.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Demon, singular. I have an exclusive contract. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll turn them ALL into treats,&quot; Henrietta said, reading a cutie ghost and witches comic book not even looking at the camera at her head rest on one hand. &quot;I think the next one I turn into a young little proper living sacrifice age to be fed to my benefactor. You know the time, tribal white dress, flowers in her hair, tied up in rope.&quot; She then looked at the camera with a grin. &quot;Consider that a preview for whichever of you pieces of demon bait are next!&quot; <br />
<br />
The tiny armless, legless clear pink catgirl shaped candy that had been Jennifer declared through telepathy. &quot;You should all consider it an honor that you&#39;ll be used to increase mistress&#39; magic!&quot; <br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
&quot;And next up, Rhode Island&#39;s Larry Letterman, a true upset. He did the unthinkable and toppled Leonard Nelson, the brilliant computer programmer who had been one of the shoe-ins for the win! With a DRINKING GAME of all things folks! This guy in a midlife crisis at age twenty-three has perhaps one of the normal cat-girls in his harem now.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;My goals are simply. I just wanna get laid. I&#39;ve got that now with Leona. But now I gotta get out of this thing. Three matches to go. Maybe I&#39;ll open a bar with all the cat girls&#39; I&#39;ll have! Make something of myself.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s a noble goal master!&quot; Leona bowed, letting her bust show for the camera. &quot;You know I&#39;ll be cheering for you. And your bar will be one of the greatest out there... I&#39;ll start searching online for a great place for you to rent and set up show once we&#39;re done here.&quot; <br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
&quot;And we have Texan Buck Mackenzie whose motta is hard honest work. Who took down another thought shoe-in for this contest,  Carson Catan. The trust-fund youth who thought he&#39;d prepared for any game that could be set before him. Who... to be frank, was an idiot to accept that challenge in the first place.&quot; <br />
 <br />
&quot;Ah ain&#39;t gonna lie and say this is to &#39;save the farm&#39; or some trite like that, but I can definitely say that our farm will be better off with fifteen hard workin&#39; gals willin&#39; to do their share.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You know Ah&#39;ll be willing to do my share boss!&quot; Carly the cowhand cat-girl  nodded standing upright. <br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
&quot;AND! In what had to be a truly major upset to finish the first round! Young brilliant and clever brainiac Amelia Brightside was taken down in a video game triathlon by early bloomer shortstack and streamer girl Mickey Minnie.&quot;<br />
<br />
&#39;Please don&#39;t make it sound like I simply lost. Mistress was able to win.&#39; Said the purple gamer chair in the shape of a naked cat girl that Mickey was currently sitting. <br />
<br />
&quot;Amelia was a worthy opponent, &quot;  “Hotcake_SuperStack” said proudly. &quot;They say as you get older, your reaction-time slow down. If I lose here, I won&#39;t have to go through that. If I win, then I&#39;m going down as a minor celebrity with nothing but a bright future ahead of me! Maybe I&#39;ll make the next girl a short-stack bright colored mascot like cat-girl just for fun! Who knows? Maybe not. We&#39;ll see. That&#39;s what makes this show fun after all right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And I&#39;ll remind our audience, that once a contestant is defeated. Their cat girl(s) will become the victory&#39;s as well, and the victory is free to change their form and self to match their own designs. Or they may chose, or whatever reason, to leave them unchanged until the final around. After the final victor has made their final changes, the changes done to their cat-girls are locked and may not be revised.&quot;<br />
<br />
This was a safety measure after it was discovered that transforming someone&#39;s inner most self several times in one day could damage their soul. The game shows and other contests carefully measured every possible transformation allowed (the number of changes from each round being within the safety margin). Thus the number of contestants was sixteen, rather than something gigantic like say sixty-four, that many potential changes of each contestant would need to spread out over multiple days. <br />
<br />
&quot;And with that out of the way... Let&#39;s begin round two. Players can challenge each other. If no one challenges, then the computer will decide the next match up at random.&quot;</p>
