<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">One day, while drunk browsing the internet Mark found a site advertising a &quot;TF-Pad&quot;.<br />
<br />
Of course, as a TF-enthusiast he bought it,knowing he was gonna get scammed. But hey, maybe it was real.<br />
<br />
Who was he kidding? Even in a drunken state nobody would be that stupid, right? He soon went to sleep, forgetting about the TF-Pad.<br />
<br />
Imagine his surprise as a package arrived at the front door of his apartment four days later.<br />
<br />
&#39;Huh, I don&#39;t remember having bought something.&#39;, he said bringing it inside.<br />
<br />
He got to the living room, grabbed some scissors and opened it.<br />
<br />
Suddenly it hit him like a brick.<br />
<br />
&#39;Yeah, I bought that shit, didn&#39;t I? Let&#39;s hope this didn&#39;t cost much.&#39;<br />
<br />
He took the TF-Pad, put it around his arm and touched the screen.<br />
<br />

<br />
Name: Mark Marker<br />
<br />
Species: Human<br />
<br />
Gender: Male<br />
<br />
Age:22&quot;<br />
<br />
A picture of him appeared on the side.<br />
<br />
&quot;OK...this is creepy.&quot;, he said out loud.<br />
<br />
Where did it get that data from?<br />
<br />
So, he now had that thing. What should he do? It obviously wouldn&#39;t actually transform someone. Maybe it was a picture-morpher or a filter of some kind which would be applied to a picture, like on certain social media. <br />
<br />
A tutorial option appeared.<br />
<br />
He pressed it thinking, &#39;Was that a coincidence or did it read my mind?&#39; <br />
<br />
The display told him to point at someone so he walked towards the bedroom, where his roommate Lars was currently playing some dragon RPG. <br />
<br />
Mark opened the door just a little and pointed through it at him. <br />
<br />
Soon the display started showing a bunch of personal data, some things even Mark didn&#39;t know about were on there! How! <br />
<br />
Mark looked down at the TF-Pad and thought about what he should do. <br />
<br />
He and Lars often played a improvised TF-Pen-and-Paper-RPG. Mark remembered Lars usually playing as his Dragonsona. <br />
<br />
He just wrote, &quot;Turn Lars into his Dragonsona&quot; on the pad. If it knew so much, maybe it knew about that too. <br />
<br />
He turned awareness on and watched the Pad, waiting for something to happen. <br />
<br />
He looked over to Lars and...stared in bewilderment as green scales spread across his hand?! <br />
<br />
Soon Lars looked down and screamed as his hands had become a strange mix of Human hands and Dragon claws!<br />
<br />
The scales continued moving up Lars&#39; arms and the shock of both soon turned into fascination. <br />
<br />
Soon Lars sat up from his ridiculous gaming-chair as he started growing and becoming more muscular. <br />
<br />
The changes spread to his torso which elongated. The scales there were white instead of green. His nipples disappeared. <br />
<br />
Lars became more feminine and stronger as his waist carved in and shoulders lost broadness. <br />
<br />
&quot;It is really happening!&quot;, Lars said full of glee. <br />
<br />
The changes reached his head as it got covered in scales. He grew a draconic maw as curved horns appeared on top of his head. His short, black hair became longer and his ears lengthened, becoming scaled too and pointy. At last his neck elongated, allowing much more movement. <br />
<br />
Muscle bulged as his hips pushed outwards and with a pop, his manhood disappeared.<br />
<br />
The now female Lars quivered in excitement. <br />
<br />
As she continued growing her clothes ripped apart. <br />
<br />
Her feet were reduced to four claws each as they somehow teared through her shoes while her foreclaws still had clawed thumbs. <br />
<br />
&quot;YES&quot;, screamed Lars as her legs and feet became digigrade. <br />
<br />
Soon a tail ripped through what was left of her pants, whipping around happily. <br />
<br />
A pair of what appeared to be arms grew on her back, but as they watched they saw that their fingers were elongating, with membranes growing between them. <br />
<br />
They were becoming wings! <br />
<br />
Soon, with a happy roar, it was complete.<br />
<br />
&quot;I AM A DRAGON!.....I...am...Leira, the dragon?...&quot; <br />
<br />
Lars was now indeed a 2.5 meter tall dragon. She wasn&#39;t anthro or feral, more something in between. She would be able to stand exchangeably in a quadrupedal and a bipedal stance. <br />
<br />
In fact the apartment had changed too. Her bed had become a large nest with cloth inside, her chair now was more of a short bench. The ceiling had become higher and the doors bigger. <br />
<br />
Mark walked in, surprising her. <br />
<br />
&quot; Don&#39;t be afraid! It is me, Lars!&quot;, the Dragoness said, happily, dancing on the spot while swinging her arms through the air. <br />
<br />
&quot;I know...and I still can&#39;t believe this.&quot;<br />
<br />
He showed her his arm. He thought about allowing Lars to see it and that apparently was enough to make it appear in her vision. <br />
<br />
&quot;Wow! How does it do that?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;...This is the TF-Pad and it is what allowed me to transform you.&quot;<br />
<br />
At this she suddenly hugged him against her chest, almost crushing him under her strong arms. <br />
<br />
 &quot;THANK YOU! THANK YOU! THANK YOU!&quot; <br />
<br />
After almost dying Lars let him go. <br />
<br />
&quot;What can that thing do, Master?... Why does it feel so right to call you that?&quot;<br />
<br />
Mark was out of breath but soon recovered and looked up to her. <br />
<br />
&quot;I...bought this thing while drunk on some website. It apparently can permanently transform people into anything I want and passively change reality...It also turns the transformed into a loyal servant to me...&quot;<br />
<br />
Lars put a claw under her chin,&quot;Do you know what that means?! All our dreams can become true! This is the single best day of our lifes!&quot; <br />
<br />
Mark noticed how she didn&#39;t even mention the whole enforced servitude thing. <br />
<br />
While being able to fulfill his fantasy of TF-ing people was awesome, he didn&#39;t like mental changes in his TF. They would usually go through a entire personality change, unwillingly becoming a entirely different person. <br />
<br />
It always felt like a way of navigating around how a person would feel about their new situation. It felt lazy and the idea of a person being changed to such a degree always felt too close to identity death. <br />
<br />
He didn&#39;t judge people for liking it in stories but this was REAL LIFE. He couldn&#39;t bear the thought of causing what in his mind was essentially murder. <br />
<br />
Unknown to both of them the TF-Pad had already reacted to Mark&#39;s thoughts and brought the mental changes to a minimum. It was enough of a mental change for her mind to be capable of properly controlling her new body as she otherwise would have to relearn how to move for months. <br />
<br />
&quot;So, how do you feel about the whole...servitude thing?&quot; <br />
<br />
Lars contemplated for a while, &quot;Honestly, I don&#39;t really mind. Servitude in exchange for a entirely new life with so many things to explore is...a acceptable trade. Look...I know what you are thinking right now. I am still myself in my mind. I am just a awesome dragon now on the outside. You are still my best friend!&quot;<br />
<br />
She muzzled his forehead comfortingly.. <br />
<br />
He shed a tear. <br />
<br />
Yeah...that sounded like him...her.<br />
<br />
&quot;...Should I call you Leira now?&quot; <br />
<br />
She nodded and the TF-Pad altered reality so that to everyone not in the know, she was always Leira. <br />
<br />
&quot; You know I am surprised that you have no problem with being female.&quot;,Mark said. <br />
<br />
&quot;Dude, don&#39;t tell me you wouldn&#39;t exchange your dick for dragonhood because I wouldn&#39;t believe you. And being female can&#39;t be that bad. At least I didn&#39;t turn into a...ugh...broodmother..I hate that word. We Dragons are noble creatures and not Sex-beasts! Anyway, let&#39;s go outside. I wanna use my wings!&quot;<br />
<br />
Mark also wanted to see that.</p>
