<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After the doctor visit it was nearing 10 am and most people changing where talking to counselor or nurses, going to group talks to talk about their changes. She was never a talker; she was always the shy girl the quiet girl. She could have gone to the pool but that had too many memories of hiding her body from boys and worse her bullies. One bad one was when Lisa had all but ripped off her swim suit when she went to the pool for a graduation party put on by the school for their junior year. Only luck had prevented her from losing her suit in front of almost her entire class, Lisa got off free like always this time because her friend Jean who was state champion swimmer and give her an cover story. So the pool was out of the question at the moment, she decided to spend her last day as herself doing something she always loved. Art. <br />
<br />
She grabbed her art book and walked outside and found a small garden which sat between Four buildings. It seamed to be a shared garden as people going through a wide range of changes moved around the garden along with doctors and nurses traveling between buildings. She found a spot by a small koi fish pound and began to draw. She was so focused on her drawing, drawing everything in the color pencils that she didn’t notice her stomach growing until it was well past two. <br />
<br />
She got up and headed to the cafeteria and had a simple lunch and went back to drawing, this time instead of the pound, the fish and nature. She sketched out the people, those turning and the loved ones who had come to see what their husband, wife, or child had become. The doctors seamed to like to show the change in the garden, something about a more relaxing spot to start a new life. Sometimes the change was accepted and ended with a hug and tears, a couple a man and a women embraced both of them had come down with the virus, one became a fawn the other a werewolf, both had switched genders and both promised to stay together and work it out and explain everything to their children. Not all of them where that clean once she saw a man who had become a snake women, a Naga with a cobra hood instead of hair get served divorce papers by his wife’s lawyer. That was painful to see and the man now woman had broken down crying saying how his wife always hated snakes.<br />
<br />
Finally after dinner, she called her mom to tell her everything was fine and that she would call her tomorrow before mother went to bed. Her mother was a night shift waitress at a the same trucker stop that she started at when she dropped out of high school to have her older sister and her step-father was a long road trucker just like her father was. Neither of them made a lot of money and in total between her three and his two they had five kids to care for and she was the middle on. She loved her mother and her step father but truth be told she was never close to any of them, her mother always worked nights and her step father drove across country so they where never really around. Still they where family so she promised to call home in the morning before her mother had to go sleep to wake up for her shift the following night. Once that was done she went back outside and looked at the stars and drew that before putting away that book.<br />
<br />
When she walked back in she found that most of the people where already in bed the change took a lot out of people and people went to bed early, she herself felt more tired then normal. Those who weren’t where fighting it. It wasn’t sleep that was concerning them it was that most of the changes happened while a person slept, maybe it was because that was when the body was resting allowing the change, but few major changes happened while a person was awake. She walked past a women maybe about her age with scales around her neck.<br />
<br />
“I don’t want to sleep…I don’t want to lose it.” said the women with a hissing sound added to each S in every word as she cried to a nurse. “I don’t want to be a women, I am a man, I will not lose my dick.”<br />
<br />
It was then that Kim realized that overall she had gotten very lucky, she was getting nothing but positives from this change as far as she knew but it was horrible for others. She went back to her room and took out her phone. It was an old flip phone; her family couldn’t afford anything better and all it had was prepaid minutes off a phone card. It did however have a camera on the front, and she held it out now as she stood before the full length mirror along the wall. She took a photo and put the phone away.<br />
<br />
“You know this is a smart mirror.” said a voice as turned around to see another young woman standing in the doorway. She had dark skin and even darker hair.  “You’re a new one?”<br />
<br />
“Yes.” Confirmed Kim as she looked at this woman, that is when she noticed that the women wasn’t wearing shoes but instead had cat paws for feet, a tail was moving back and forth as she looked up at the ceiling. “I am Kim who are you?”<br />
<br />
“I am Sharon.” Said the woman as she offered her hand, Kim took it and noticed that she no longer had fingernails but instead had short claws. “Sorry if I scratched you, those came in this morning. I am next door, like I said these are smart mirrors, they have built in cameras and other features.”<br />
<br />
“Like what.” Said Kim as Sharon told her to stand still. “Now say, take photo.”<br />
<br />
Before she could, there was a slight flash from the mirror and then before she could say anything Sharon stepped up and pulled her to the side. Her reflection didn’t move and instead stood still, the mirror was a screen. <br />
<br />
“Wow…cool.” said Kim<br />
<br />
“You haven’t seen the half of it.” said Sharon as she put Kim back in the same spot. “Take measurements.”<br />
<br />
Then before her eyes, dotted lines came across her reflection measuring everything from her height to her bust, it even got within five pounds of her weight. <br />
<br />
“Now the image and your measurements stay in there and you can track the changes.” said Sharon before shrugging “Not that anyone could miss their changes. Everyone becoming monsters.”<br />
<br />
“I assume you are becoming a cat person?” inquired Kim as Sharon nodded her head.<br />
<br />
“I am on day two about to go into day three, my changes will take a week or so.” said Sharon “How about you? What are you changing into?”<br />
<br />
“Well…I am turning into a Nymph.” explained Kim as she pulled up the images of her mentors and the almost goddess look they had now.<br />
<br />
“Luckily SOB.” stated Sharon crossing her arms over her chest. “I mean is there any real downside to becoming a Nymph?”<br />
<br />
“Not really.” admitted Kim “I mean I will have to adapt my powers and according to this Nymphs get certain sensitivities.”<br />
<br />
“Sensitivities?” inquired Sharon<br />
<br />
“Well for example a fire nymph, one who can control and summon fire can stand much greater temperature then a normal person. The example they gave was they could walk across the Desert and feel perfectly fine but they start to get frost bite above freezing.” explained Kim “An Ice Nymph is the opposite they could stand outside in a snow storm in shorts and a tank top but a heat wave is dangerous for them. A light nymph can see in the brightest light but is horrible in seeing in the dark, a dark nymph is the opposite great night vision but sensitive to bright lights.”<br />
<br />
“So some down sides but overall nothing but positives.” explained Sharon with a yawn showing her fangs. “So I’ll see you in the morning maybe we can hang out or something.”<br />
<br />
“Maybe.” Said Kim<br />
<br />
“How long are your changes?” inquired Sharon<br />
<br />
“Since it is mostly human, the doctors say I change over 3 days and on the morning of the 4th I should be fully changed.” Explained Kim <br />
<br />
“Damn, that is fast mine is a week, so is almost everyone else.” Stated Sharon<br />
<br />
“Well they recommend I take a few days to learn how to control my powers but overall a week to ten days they say to turn and learn how to control my powers.” Explained Kim<br />
<br />
“About the same for me, a week to change and three days or so to get used to my new body before heading back home.” Stated Sharon as she turned to leave only to remember. “Oh…to pull up the images on the mirror in the morning just say history.”<br />
<br />
“Thanks.” said Kim as Sharon walked out of the room and moments later, she heard the next door close. <br />
<br />
“Well…” said Kim as she looked at herself in the mirror again, she had seen herself like this for so long but in the morning she would be different, in the morning she should see the first changes, they would be small but grow over the time and in three nights she would be a nymph. “Off to bed I go.”</p>
