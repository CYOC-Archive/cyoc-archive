<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Finally the day arrives: “Amy’s” first date with Riley! Jeff, who is himself, wakes up early, the 16-year-old sits up in bed, rubbing the sleep out of his eyes, ‘today is the day,’ he thinks to himself, ‘I feel so nervous. I… I hope it’ll go well!’<br />
<br />
“Amy” and Riley agreed to spend the day together, Riley suggested to first take a walk in the park, then find a nice café for something to eat for lunch, after lunch, they’d head back to Riley’s to hang out a little, before heading to the movies and have a nice dinner at a nice and well-known restaurant where rich people go.<br />
<br />
‘I better get myself ready,’ Jeff thinks to himself, luckily no one found out about Jeff’s secret-new life as “Amy”, the boy used the Chronivac to make himself rich, wanting to fit in with Riley’s crowed. Jeff heads into the bathroom and locks the door, he then uses his phone to transform into “Amy”, once Jeff is back being “Amy”, the former boy looks at his reflection, a small smile on his… her face, then looks down at his young naked body, “I really missed this body,” the “girl” mumbles to herself. “Amy” steps into the shower and sighs in relaxation as the warm water hits her body, after the shower, “Amy” grabs a black lace bra and without difficulty puts it on, then she pull a matching panty up her legs and then grabs the blue dress Sarah had bought her.<br />
<br />
Once “Amy” is finished, she heads into her room and takes a look at herself in her full length mirror, “I look good,” she says to herself, “I hope Riley likes it too,” the “girl” then walks over to her desk and opens a drawer, from which she takes a red lipstick and applies it to herself, ‘I wish I had my ears pierced,’ she thinks to herself, ‘I’ll have that done, the next time I’m at the mall with or without Sarah,’ after tying her hair back into a pony tail, the “girl” nods satisfied at her reflection, “time to go,” she says and soon is walking down the street towards the bus stop, her blue handbag, which has her phone, wallet and makeup stored, dangling from her shoulder.<br />
<br />
‘Being a girl is so much better than being a boy,’ the “girl” thinks to herself, ‘no annoying piece of dangling meat between my legs’.<br />
<br />
After an hour, “Amy” finally arrives at the address Riley had given her, the “girl’s” eyes widen in amazement when she spots the house, ‘it’s… it’s a castle,’ she thinks to herself, staring with wide eyes at the massive structure. “Amy” walks towards the gates where a man in uniform is standing, the man has a stone cold expression on his face and scowls when he sees the girl approaching.<br />
<br />
“What do you want, girl,” he asks, rather unkindly.<br />
<br />
“I… I’m here to see Riley,” the “girl” says, “we… we have a date”.<br />
<br />
The guard grumbles, he then takes out a small book, “your name?”<br />
<br />
“Amy… Amy Thomas”.<br />
<br />
The guard looks in his book, he then nods, “very well,” he says and presses a button, which opens the large gates, “walk up the driveway to the main entrance, I’ll let your “date” know you have arrived. Now: get out of my sight, girl!”<br />
<br />
“Amy” nods and walks through the gates, ‘what an ass,’ she thinks to herself, the “girl” soon arrives at the front entrance and starts to climb the stairs, when she arrives at the top she sees Riley standing there, a smile on his face and wearing a nice expensive looking suit with a white shirt and a dark blue tie.<br />
<br />
“Welcome, Amy,” the boy says cheerfully, “I hope your trip was good and that you hadn’t any trouble. Also: you look amazing!”<br />
<br />
“Amy” looks at Riley, “thanks, Riley,” “you look great yourself”.<br />
<br />
Riley frowns, sensing that something had upset HIS Amy, “Amy… what happened?”<br />
<br />
“Uh? What do you mean, Riley,” the “girl” asks, “nothing happened!”<br />
<br />
Riley snorts, he then grins, “you are a bad liar, Amy,” he says, “I can tell that something has upset you. Whatever it is: tell me, please”.<br />
<br />
“Amy” looks at Riley, the “girl” then chuckles, “I guess it’s hard to keep something from you,” she says, then she sighs, “well… you guard at the gate was not really… friendly. He was pretty mean to me and rather bad tempered”.<br />
<br />
Riley scowls, NO ONE has permission to treat HIS Amy that way, “I’ll have a serious “talk” with him,” he then says, already having some ideas on how to punish the stupid guard, “but for now, let’s head to the park and enjoy our date. I promise I’ll make it unforgettable,” he says with a smile.<br />
<br />
“Amy” smiles back, “yeah, let’s get out of here,” she says, they both then walk down the stairs and driveway.<br />
<br />
When they reach and exit the gates the guard looks up, smiling and acting friendly, “have fun, young sir,” he says, but his smile quickly fades and “Amy” can see the man actually gulp when Riley shoots him a dirty look, not saying a word as he and “Amy” simply walk past the guard and start to head down the street to the nearby private park.<br />
<br />
The two enjoy their day, they talk a lot with each other, Riley always commenting at how beautiful “Amy” looks, and the “girl” complimenting on Riley’s good looks. They also tell each other about their lives, “Amy” leaving out the fact that she is in reality a boy, unaware that Riley already knows.<br />
<br />
Later that day, both head to the cinema to watch a romantic movie, during the movie, “Amy” feels Riley lie his hand on her thigh, but doesn’t do anything else, the “girl” not seeming to mind, instead she finds herself lying her head on Riley’s shoulder, unaware of the boy’s grin, ‘looks like I will soon officially have a girlfriend! And the hottest and sexiest of all girls on this planet and the universe,’ he thinks to himself, his grin growing when he feels his cock twitch in his pants.<br />
<br />
After the movie, Riley and “Amy” exit the theater holding hands, “that was such a romantic movie,” the “girl” says, smiling, “I really enjoyed it”.<br />
<br />
Riley smiles back, “I’m glad you enjoyed the movie,” he says, lying an arm around “Amy’s” waist, pulling her closer to his body.<br />
<br />
“Amy” feels herself blush as Riley pulls her closer to his body, ‘Riley sure is being careful not to go to far,’ she thinks to herself, ‘I can sense that he wants to do more, I even noticed his bulge, he looks so big. I feel so weird, all giddy and just a need to want to… see… feel and… taste IT! But… am… am I really ready to go THAT far on our FIRST date? I am not so sure, but I know I WANT it!’<br />
<br />
“Here we are,” Riley says, tearing “Amy” from her thoughts, the girl looks up and sees Riley opening a door that leads into the most expensive restaurant in town.<br />
<br />
“Amy” giggles, “what a gentleman,” she says, walking through the door, once she entered, her eyes widen, “whoa… this place is amazing!”<br />
<br />
Riley smiles as he steps next to her, wrapping his arm around her waist once again, “yeah, it is,” he says, “my parents regularly bring me here to have dinner. The food here is really good, you’ll love it. Come, let’s find our table”.<br />
<br />
The two walk to a podium where a young woman is standing, the woman smiles at the two teenagers, “may I help you two,” she asks.<br />
<br />
Riley nods, “yes, my name is Riley Alvarez,” he says, “I booked a table for two for tonight”.<br />
<br />
The woman nods and looks down at a large book, “ah, yes,” she says, she then grabs two menus from under the podium, “right this way, my dears,” she says and starts walking away.<br />
<br />
“Amy” and Riley follow the woman to a nice secluded area, “this is perfect,” Riley says, he then pulls out a chair for “Amy”, “me lady,” the boy says, smiling.<br />
<br />
“Amy” can’t help but chuckle, “you really are trying you best to impress me, eh Riley,” she asks, sitting down on the chair.<br />
<br />
Riley chuckles himself, “well, a boy has to impress the girl he’s dating, no?”<br />
<br />
“Amy” nods, “true,” she says, “and you really ARE impressing me,” she adds, ‘he is really doing everything he can to make me happy and enjoy myself. He is such a sweet boy, I think he is the perfect boyfriend for me! Hehe… oh, Riley, you don’t know it yet, but you have me hooked and I am NOT complaining!’<br />
<br />
The young woman smiles as she listens and watches the two young teens, “if I may,” she says, “you two make a cute couple. Anyway, here are the menus,” she says, handing out the menus, “would you like something to drink while you choose your food?”<br />
<br />
“Sure,” Riley says, “I’ll have a glass of Coke, please”.<br />
<br />
The woman nods, “and for you, my dear,” she asks, turning to “Amy”.<br />
<br />
“Just a glass of water for now,” the “girl” says.<br />
<br />
“Very well,” the woman nods, scribbling on her notepad, “I’ll be back with your drinks shortly,” with that she turns and leaves.</p>
