<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Max’s grin turns into a smirk, “I’ve been invited to a friend’s costume party,” he says to himself, “I told him I couldn’t come, since I have no costume, but now… hehe… I HAVE a costume. And I know exactly what kind of costume I want: I’ve always liked those full body fursuits furries wear,” the 10-year-old opens the transformation options list before opening the option “costumes”, then “fursuits”, then “canine” and finally “Malinois”. The boy decides to want the coloring to be the traditional golden fawn with black saddle and mask, he is then asked to select a target, his smirk grows when he selects Jeff, “hehe… he’ll make one fine costume,” Max mumbles, licking his lips and giggling when he feels his cock twitch, for some reason, imagining wearing his brother excites the 10-year-old. Max then makes a few adjustments, setting the transformation to be instant, which will cause Jeff to be confused and disoriented, and sets the duration to last 48 hours. The boy also gives himself the ability to hear whatever Jeff thinks and, if he wants to, even communicate with Jeff via telepathy. He then adjusts the “costume” to be his size, the material to be stretchy and, not wanting some baggy costume, Max sets it so the “costume” would be hugging his body nicely, and with a satisfied smirk the 10-year-old confirms the changes.<br />
<br />
Max feels a sudden tingling sensation run through his body and mind, causing the 10-year-old to shiver and groan, “whoa, that felt so weird,” he says to himself, he then suddenly hears a loud crash coming from downstairs and his eyes widen when he hears Jeff’s terrified and confused voice in his head.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Max grins to himself, ‘it worked,’ he thinks to himself, without opening a mental link to Jeff, Jeff is unable to hear him and Max decides to leave the link “closed” for now and gets to his feet, “now, I need to be careful and act surprised and pretend that I am unaware that the “costume” is Jeff. This’ll be fun,” he says to himself as he makes his way out of Jeff’s room, “what the hell was that sound? It sounded as though it came from downstairs,” the 10-year-old says as he makes his way down the stairs.<br />
<br />
When Max turns the corner and enters the kitchen the boy feels the corner of his mouth twitch, but is able to fight the urge of smirking when he sees the “costume” of a Malinois lying on the floor, a smashed plate and a half eaten sandwich next to “it”.<br />
<br />
“What the hell happened here, and where did that costume come from,” the boy asks himself with a confused tone in his voice, trying to sound convincing as he walks over and picks up the “costume”. The &quot;costume&#39;s&quot; muzzle is small, and due to its size, it has the appearance of a young anthro Malinois of 10-years of age.<br />
<br />
Jeff mentally widens his eyes when he hears the voice of his brother and the face of his brother, who looks absolutely confused, comes into view,  Jeff asks himself, <I doubt it, he wasn’t home, he must have just returned! The more logical explanation would be that the program malfunctioned somehow and randomly transformed me into a… fursuit!><br />
<br />
Unaware to Jeff, Max is listening to what he is thinking, the 10-year-old manages to keep himself from smirking, “I have no idea how this costume ended up here,” Max says to himself, “but, it looks pretty neat and high quality, it even looks as though it would fit me. Hm… maybe I can go to Tim’s costume party after all! Let’s try it on,” with that Max hurries upstairs.<br />
<br />
 Jeff exclaims in horror, <br />
<br />
Max however pretends to not hear his brother’s panicked plea, ‘hehe… what lovely music to my ears,’ the boy thinks to himself. The 10-year-old bursts into his room and closes the door behind him before lying the costume on his bed, staring down at it.<br />
<br />
Jeff mentally gulps and his panic increases when he notices the excitement in the 10-year-old’s eyes, <br />
<br />
Max mentally smirks, ‘hehe… you can’t boss me around anymore, Jeff,’ he thinks to himself, without Jeff being able to hear him, ‘at least for the next 48 hours!’<br />
<br />
To Jeff’s horror he watches as Max begins taking his clothes off, soon the 10-year-old is standing only in his boxer briefs, looking down at the “costume” with a convincing thoughtful expression on his face.<br />
<br />
“Hm… it looks tight,” Max mutters to himself, then looks down at himself before shrugging and simply removes his boxer briefs, giggling when his 4-inch erect cock bounce a little when freed from its “prison”.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
“I dunno why, but for some reason, the thought of wearing the costume nude excites me, hehe,” Max says to himself before reaching out and grabbing the “costume”, “well, let’s not waste anymore time and try it on!”<br />
<br />
Jeff continues to plea with his brother to not wear him and instead help him transform back to normal,  Jeff thinks to himself, as he feels his back being unzipped and opened, . The former teen then gasps when he feels Max slowly slide his right leg into HIS leg.<br />
<br />
“Wow, so soft,” Max says, wriggling his toes, smiling wide as he watches the clawed toes of the “costume” wriggle before repeating it with the left leg. When both of his legs are inside the “costume”, Max gets to his feet and slowly pulls the costume up and over his hips, smirking when he hears Jeff’s cry of horror when his 4-inch erection gets covered by the “costume”. Max looks down and giggles, “hehe… it looks like I have doggy parts,” he says, letting out a little moan when he strokes over his erection and the soft fur of the “costume”, “wow… it doesn’t feel like a costume at all… it is as if I really have fur”.<br />
<br />
 Jeff groans, <br />
<br />
Max smirks when he hears this, ‘hehe… man, I should get an Oscar for my performance,’ he thinks to himself as he slips his right arm, then his left arm into the sleeves and attached gloves of the “costume”, “now, the head!”<br />
<br />
Jeff cries mentally as he feels Max stretch the opening of the “costume’s” head, what had once been his neck, and start to slip it on. The former teen feels as if he is being invaded as he feels his brother’s head slowly filling his own, how HIS head adjusts to his brother’s, how his little brother shoves his tongue into HIS tongue, how his mouth moves on its own, controlled by Max and as his eyes adjust and seem to merge with his brother’s and as Jeff hears the zipper being pulled closed, the former teen just sobs, while Max poses in front of the mirror, admiring himself from every angle.<br />
<br />
“SO COOL,” Max squeals, giggling when the jaw of the “costume” moves with every word he says, “I really look like a real Malinois-boy! I can’t WAIT to see the looks on my friends faces!”<br />
<br />
Max grabs his phone and dials Tim’s number, holding it to his covered ear, the “costume” is so tight fitting that Max is able to hear his friend’s voice when he answers.<br />
<br />
“Max?”<br />
<br />
“Hey, Tim,” Max says.<br />
<br />
“You sound excited,” Tim replies.<br />
<br />
“Hehe… I just got this amazing costume,” Max says.<br />
<br />
“Oh? Does that mean you are coming over,” Tim asks.<br />
<br />
“I sure am, sorry for declining before,” Max says, “I didn’t know I’d be able to get a costume, but now I have one I’m able to be a part of your party!”<br />
<br />
“That is awesome, dude,” Tim says, “I can’t wait to see it!”<br />
<br />
“I’ll be there in 30 minutes,” Max says, ending the call, “now, I should write a note so mom will know where I am,” the 10-year-old then says, after writing a note to his mother and putting his phone in his chest pouch, the boy exits the house and attaches the note to the front door with some tape before heading down the street.<br />
<br />
“Whoa, what a cool costume,” some passers by say.<br />
<br />
“Thanks,” Max says, ‘hehe… if I could control the tail… hehe… I would be wagging like crazy by now! This feels so… good… hehe,’ he thinks to himself and mentally smirks as he continues to listen to the cries of his former brother.</p>
