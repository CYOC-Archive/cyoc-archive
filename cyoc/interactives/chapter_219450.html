<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jake, an 11-year old boy with messy red hair and freckles<br />
<br />
Brandon, 25-year-old brother, who had the same red hair, but kept it more tidy,<br />
<br />
Jack chooses somewhere else (Giant Boys Land)<br />
<br />
Jack is fascinated by giants for a few years, well it was since his 25 years old brother Brandon told about him his experience as a shrunken man for rent he did several years in a row as a summer and part-time job to help him to pay his university fees, dorm accommodation, and various expenses. <br />
<br />
(Jack) Hey, what about trying the Giant Boys Land, Brandon? What do you think it may be fun, right? You told me a few things about being tiny, so I bet you would not mind being tiny again, so I want to try it too!<br />
<br />
(Brandon) Well, I don’t know, Jack, sometimes it can be very invasive, and you have just turned 11 years old recently. I was 16 already when I shrunk for the first time. Even then, It was a bit unsettling to be handheld, touched, and played with a lot by giant young boys, teens, and adults. But yeah I never has being hurt though.<br />
<br />
(Jack) In the map’s footnotes, it says that no violence is tolerated and that the ones who are willing can feel how it is to be a living toy. Gee, please, please please, Bro, I want to try it. Besides, you are with me!<br />
<br />
Brandon was not so keen on his little brother being at a toy size, but the shrinking was about 1/6 scale, so not so tiny after all. He could always be just beside him as a pair not to part. So after lots of thought and hesitation, he nodded. Jack was stamping from excitement and enjoyment thinking he was about to be a tiny guy like his big bro had been a few years ago. So they walked toward the entrance of the Giant Boys Land gate.<br />
<br />
On the waiting, queue was nearly 50 guys from 10 to 40 years old. Only males because it was to go the Giant Boys&#39; Land after all. One of the oldest men was quite tall massive muscular type right in front of Jack. His name was Marc, at least 35-37 years old he was with his 10 years old son named Patrick.<br />
<br />
(Jack) Excuse me, Sir, is it the first time you come here to be tiny?<br />
<br />
The massive man giggled and said<br />
<br />
(Marc) Not at all kid, it’s my 5th time, but the first time I bring my son with me though.<br />
<br />
(Brandon) Hey Jack, don’t bother the man with personal questions, it’s not polite<br />
<br />
(Marc) Nah,  he is not bothering me at all. Besides you are both good looking and look nice. Too bad you’re not in the other end, so the one who can play with shrunken guys.  I would not mind you and your brother play with us.<br />
<br />
Brandon did not reply because he felt a little uncomfortable that such a massive man loves the idea, he and his son, had been played by a kid or teen. Yip the normal-sized guys seem to all be under 21 years old.<br />
<br />
The time seem to pass quite quickly as they talked. They arrived at some kind of several train&#39; cars whose sides and roofs were made of mesh. There was a single row of two passenger seats. Everyone was seated inside, so when it was full, the train moved inside some kind of tunnel. The light was very faint, so it needed everyone some time for their eyes to adjust. The rails appeared to be narrower in front as the train was shrinking on its way. On the speaker, there was a man’s voice giving instructions such as:<br />
<br />
[ Thank you for choosing Giant Boys&#39; Land where you will experience what it is to be a living toy for boys. The first rule is don&#39;t scream when a giant boy will look down at you. The second rule, do not to try to run away from them. The third rule is don&#39;t try to lecture them when they will pick you up and touch you in their curious mood. The fourth rule is don’t be shy to tell them if they hold you too tight, they should not harm any of you. The fifth rule, have fun while you are there! ]<br />
<br />
Then, the train arrived at the other side of the tunnel. The light was brighter, but it was not so long for everyone for their eyes to adapt. It stopped, and everyone has been invited to step out. It has been explained that they were on platforms at the giant’s waist level. That area was huge and had snack bars, a kids&#39; playground park, a swimming pool, an outdoor gym, etc. Everything is on their size. The entire platform was surrounded by fences to avoid anyone to fall down. All around was the giant area who were everywhere. As Jack, Brandon, Marc, and his 10 years old son named Patrick was already acquainted, they walked together near one of the fences to look at the giants.<br />
<br />
(Patrick) Wow, Dad, they are really tall those boys! <br />
<br />
(Marc) Well, 6 times our size actually.<br />
<br />
Jack was not so sure anymore about his choice of coming to the Giant Boys&#39; Land, so he held Brandon’s hand and squished it very hard.  Marc, seeing that said:<br />
<br />
(Marc) Hey kid, don’t be scared, they have rules here, so you won’t be harmed. But yeah, I give you that, it can be quite intimidating though.<br />
<br />
Everyone’s attention got caught when a group of new giant young boys and teens arrived. For a while, they ignored the new tiny guys freshly arrived. They joined the other kids and teens who were already playing with the presiding arrival. None of those tiny guys seem to bother being held and caressed like pets. Jack was curious about a young giant teen boy who was holding a boy who seem to be 10-11 years old in his right fist, and an adult in his left one who was saying: “Oh yeah, you do it right! My son and I feel very safe with you!” <br />
<br />
After a little while, some giants approached the platform edges.  Jack, Brandon, Marc, and his son Patrick simply went to the swimming pool as no giant seem to pay attention to them just yet. They used the changing booths to only wear swimming suits. As the two young boys dove into the pool, Marc and Brandon just lay on long chairs for a while. Suddenly shadows caste over them, it was two young giant teen boys. Jack and Patrick got out of the swimming pool to see what the teen were up to.  Marc and Brandon just remained laid when one of the teen brought his right index finger tip to Marc’s very developed pectorals. <br />
<br />
(Marc) It’s OK kid, you can touch them as long you want! (He said with a wide smile)<br />
<br />
So the giant teen was poking and rubbing the man’s pecs very carefully, almost like petting him. But he did not just touched that, he also stroked Marc’s abs, held his arms and legs between his thumb and index finger to feel the perfect and firm muscles. At some point, his son, Patrick, stood right beside his laid dad, fascinated by that giant teen enjoying touching his dad’s body. He noticed that a tent’s pole was rising under the man’s swimsuit. Spreading his legs, Marc kind of invited the giant to satisfy his curiosity. And yes, he played with the bulge, touching it, making it bounce now and then.<br />
<br />
The other giant teen was looking down at Brandon at the very moment his little brother Jack stood beside him. The young man was not as muscled than Marc, but still has a quite athletic body, a swimmer type actually. The giant was staring at his bulge, yip he was already erected and his penis is far to be tiny. <br />
<br />
Then, out of the blue. Two giant kids picked up Jack and Patrick and carried them away for a more innocent game.</p>
