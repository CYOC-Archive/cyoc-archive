<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">*Yiiipp!*<br />
<br />
It didn’t seem to matter how loud Steve turned up the radio, images kept flashing into his mind of the vixen from before.  She was lying on her side in a small hole, taking deep, pained breaths.   Another contraction wracked through the poor animal’s body, causing her mouth to clench down and her limbs to be drawn up closer to her body.<br />
<br />
*Yyyyip!*<br />
<br />
The image swirled until Steve found himself staring straight at the vixen’s backside.  With her tail raised, Steve had a perfect view of her small, pink asshole and, just below that, the head of a fox kit that was tightly wedged inside of a ring of pained, black flesh.<br />
<br />
Another, much larger fox was lying next to her with its muzzle pressed in between four swollen black teats showing through the white fur on her belly.  <br />
<br />
*Yiip!*<br />
<br />
The vixen panted as the contraction continued and a spasm her belly muscles caused a bead of milk to form on the teat closest to the other fox’s nose.<br />
<br />
The vixen would never know it, but her body grew up during a particularly harsh winter.  There was little food, and her growth was permanently stunted.  She should have been much smaller than an average fox, but she’d been born with good genes – for a fox – and those meant that she had grown to be only a little undersized.<br />
<br />
The fox worryingly pressing its nose into her belly came from the same lineage.  He was much larger than her because she would have grown to be the same size too – if there had been enough food.  <br />
<br />
But the little time that the vixen had spent in her vulpine body had done nothing to tell her why she was so much smaller than the male fox that kept following her around.  She didn’t understand how strong their genes were, nor that they had combined to produce a little of exceptionally large kits.<br />
<br />
She wished that she knew how long it had been since she had been changed, but the small fox brain that occupied her skull seemed to have a lot of difficulty telling time, among other things.  She knew that the sun had gone down and come up about a dozen times since she changed, and at least once since she’d gone into labor.<br />
<br />
Another contraction hit and she bore down as hard as she could, but the kit’s head felt so massive inside of her tight, vulpine cunt.  She didn’t know why the kit’s head was too big, but at this point she had an understanding that nothing she could do would be able to push it out of her.<br />
<br />
She thought back to her time as a human.  It didn’t matter that she had been a man – in her current situation that didn’t mean anything.  If she was still a human then she could go to the hospital, where they would do *something* to get the babies inside of her to come out.  But she wasn’t a human, she was a fox, so all that she could do was lay there and struggle until her body gave out.<br />
<br />
She wondered… how much longer would that be?<br />
<br />
*****************<br />
<br />
Steve kept driving through the forest.  Was what he saw… that police officer’s future?  To die in labor?  Would the app really do that, especially when Steve had intended for the officer to live a long, happy life as a vixen?  Or was it warning him, trying to tell him:<br />
<br />
 “This is what I can do to someone else.  This is what I *will* do to you.”<br />
<br />
Then again, Steve realized that this might all just be coming from inside of his own mind.  The app intrigued him but, at the same time, it also terrified him.  He knew how powerful it was, and he certainly suspected that it had some level of sentience, but the truth was that he was in the dark about what it truly was or how it truly worked.  <br />
<br />
As much as the app might be planting those images in his brain, it was equally if not more likely that he was just frightened about the fate he had inflicted onto the vixen and his own imagination was responding to that fear.  Still, the fact of the matter was that Steve was scared about what might happen to the vixen, so he pulled his car over and opened up the app.<br />
<br />
The first thing that he did was to check to see if there was a history window.  After all, it stood to reason that if the app was malicious, it would take a certain delight in giving its user a window into the new lives of the people that it had changed.  Unfortunately for Steve, no such window existed.  <br />
<br />
He next moved to the target select window, only to see that he was the only target in range.  Steve went to drag the range slider at the top, only to be stopped by a popup window:<br />
<br />
“Warning: Increasing range will severely impact battery life.  Proceed?”<br />
<br />
Clicking yes, Steve dragged the slider to max.  However, despite the apparently increased battery usage, the range only increased by about 50 feet.  Still, another target came into view in front of him.  Curious as to who that was, Steve generated a sentence:<br />
<br />
“Mark is preparing for game night at the community center.”</p>
