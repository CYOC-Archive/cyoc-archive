<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Breakfast comes to an end, everyone starts clearing their plates when Mrs. Adams asks, “So what are your plans today? I know your parents were talking about finishing unpacking, but the mentioned to us that you two aren’t needed at home to help if you don’t want to, also, Sam and Grant should show you guys downtown, now that you all know the rules you can see the real Naturalis Park area.”<br />
“Everything is in walking distance too which is nice, and so close nit that you’ll learn everyone on the block if not even the area in due time,” Mr. Adams chimed in.<br />
Jasmine and I look at each other and agree that heading into town could be fun, “Alright, but I’m wanting a change in clothes, and a shower,” Jasmine said as the four of us left towards the door, “You should get a change of clothes too Mike.”<br />
Sam nudged me when Jas said that with a sly wink, while we all entered our house. “Hey mom, dad, we’re here for a change or clothes, also Sam and Grant are here if you wanna say hi!” Jasmine yells out removing her top as the door closes. Ruffling from down the hall leads to hearing mom and dad walking over, “Hello! Your parents were delightful, these rules are interesting, but it does make me excited to see your first day Michael, some of the rules you have to learn as you go unfortunately so we can’t just list them off,” Mom said shaking hands with Sam and Grant. “Yea, I can’t wait to see how both you and Jas acclimate, because she can know more, but as a ‘dependant’ she can’t know them wll either,” Dad followed up.<br />
“Yea, it’s going to be a blast, Grant and I are taking them into town once Jas is back, unless Mike wants to change as well then wait for both of them,” Sam said bouncing on the balls of her feet.<br />
“Yea I just wanted to be here introduction, I’m going to get changed now,” I say running upstairs to my room, passing Jasmine’s open door where I glanced her naked back leaning over her bed slightly picking an outfit, “Open door policy sis?” I remark as I pass into my room where I hear, “Why not? It’s not like we won’t see each other nude a lot more.”<br />
I strip down, decide I’m too curious and walk over to Jasmine’s room, “Hey Jas, I figured since this is the first and only time for a while we’ll be privately the two of us, would you ever, I don’t know, want to just, be <i> more </i> relaxed tonight when mom and dad go to bed?”<br />
Jasmine turns around thong in hand, “Uh, if you are asking what I think you are, then, let’s see and talk later okay?” Jasmine pulls the thong up and then reaches around for the matching bra, “don’t feel weird about it okay? I know Sam ran into you in the morning before breakfast because she brought up a similar point to me, but we’re still getting used to this, don’t be afraid to be slower,” Jasmine finishes putting on her jeans and grabs a top, “I suppose to test how weird it would be, help me with my shirt then I’ll help you with your pants.”<br />
I step forward grab her shirt then help pull it down, brushing her breasts as I unfurl the shirt, and finally finish with a quick tug noticing her breasts stare at me with how we situated ourselves. I stand up from my kneel, my dick flopping back and forth as I get to a standing position, and head over to my room, feeling Jasmine right behind me. I put on some boxers, and grab a pair of shorts and hand them to Jasmine, she kneels down giving me a full cleavage shot, as she pulls them up, I can feel a semi come on, and I hear a noise from the doorframe as I see Sam look in wondering what was taking so long, she stands silent with a sly grin, I look back down blushing harder feeling my boner grow as Jasmine finishes pulling my shorts up, she then buckles it, my boner now on full effect, she has to push it down slightly causing me an electric shock of pleasure, as Jasmine then does up my fly. I notice Sam dart away noticing Jasmine starting to get up, “Well that wasn’t that bad, felt a little weird touching your penis even if through your boxers, but I think I’m down to do that tonight I guess,” Jasmine says blushing as she then heads out to return to the livingroom. I grab a shirt and throw it on, and as I was heading out of my room Sam popped up again, “Nice, and have fun tonight, it will be a rush. By the way, our backyards have a fence door, so anytime you two want a third member, I have a permanent backyard tent for ‘star-gazing’ that we can use,” Sam said walking with me back towards the livingroom.<br />
“Alright, let’s head to town!” Sam said grabbing Grant’s and my arm and steering towards the door. “Have fun you four!” Mom and dad yelled to us as we left. Heading down the street Sam took the lead with Jas followed by myself and Grant, “So where to first? Like is it something to prep us for or just blindside?” I asked.<br />
“Blindside, but it won’t be that bad, it’s just more quirks of Naturalis Park,” Grant replied, “It’s got all the hotspots you could want which is great.”<br />
“Yea, it’s a nice community where a lot of the places offer free services once you start to get more familiar with the community, don’t worry btw, today you are with us to help expedite the introduction,” Sam mentioned.<br />
“Well I’m excited, how long of a walk is it?” Jasmine asked.<br />
“About 14 minute walk to town center, it’s probably a good hour long walk for the farthest points of Naturalis Park,” Grant said.<br />
<br />
  <b> Town center outskirts </b><br />
<br />
“Alright, so first things first, let’s get some food,” Sam says bringing us to the local cafe, “hey George, meet Jasmine and Michael, the new family right next to Grant and I, we’d like some pretzels to go.”<br />
Sam leans on the counter and hands him a $20 for the four pretzels, “Welcome to Naturalis! Sure you can’t wait to keep exploring,” George says handing out the pretzels.<br />
“Hey Sam, we should just window shop them, because I can’t think of anything too specific that would be happening today of note,” Grant suggested as the four of us headed back out to the main street. Looking around the road, nothing really stood out like it was hyped up, until I noticed a gym where everyone was naked, I saw a couple other nude hotspots like a gaming house, spa, and a diner or two, then there was the park across from the town hall, museum and post office flanking the other edges of the park. “I notice a few nude spots,” I pipe up, then noticing the park had a bunch of nude people as well, locker huts flank the pathways, “As well as the park itself.”<br />
“Yea, it’s great to hang out, especially after school and just hang with friends,” Sam says leading us to the park, “You don’t have to be naked here, but I’ll consider it insulting if you don’t when I’m with you here.” Sam starts taking off her top, Grant sighs, slumped over a bit, then starts taking off his shirt. Sam turns to Jasmine, who is as reluctant as I am to strip, and grabs at her jeans, and pulls, “I love that thong, but these jeans gotta go at least. I’ll give you one underwear pass for today you two,” Sam says forcing Jas to comply with taking off her jeans. Grant finds an empty duo of lockers and throws his clothes in one, “Here Mike, take this other one, we’ll split it among sibling lines, mainly because I don’t want to risk wearing your underwear,” Grant said completely nude. I start stripping as I notice Jas was almost nude and feared gettibg stripped by Sam being to much and entering the park with a boner didn’t seem the best idea.<br />
Naked, clothes in lockers, we headed into the park, neither Jas nor I decided to take Sam’s offer and just went full commando. Looking around, the park was beautiful, there was a small pond connected to a river leading to an artificial waterfall, the tree canopy spread out perfectly so you could choose whether to suntan or not. The naked people also were around, but the park layout allowed for good privacy zones, the playground area was rather wide open, but it makes sense so parents can always see their kids from any angle to there for a couple dozen feet. Most people seemed to be naked as well, a few were clothed, like those who looked elderly, or those who seemed to be using the park path as a way from point A to point B.<br />
“Abigail! How are you my love? I see your family is back from vacation! You ready for 2nd grade?” Sam yelled running towards a naked 7year old girl hugging her. “Yea, it waz an awezome vakation!” Abigail said hugging Sam. An older woman comes over, “Hey Sam! Yea we just got back last night, Abi here was out all night and when we woke up she really wanted to come here, was going to call you tonight to let you know we were back and need you Saturday’s again for sitting.”<br />
“Yea no problem Shannon, I love this little one and hearing all about her week,” Sam said jumping up, her breasts bounce along side her, Abigail grabbing Sam’s leg, her head resting right next to Sam’s vagina, Sam brushing Abigails hair.<br />
“Oh Shannon, these are the new family kids, Jasmine, she is 23 so if other mothers need help I volunteer Jasmine as tribute, and that is Michael, 14, as well as Grant and going to start school next week.”<br />
“Welcome you two, I’ll drop by for a proper meeting later, we’re directly across from the Adams, meanwhile, come on Abigail, time to get back home, we still need to finish unpacking!” Shannon said picking up Abigail waving then walking away from our group.<br />
“So we can hang out at the park a bit longer or start heading home as well, I know Grant hates being dragged around all day,” Sam asked pointing at Grant who seemed to be in agreement with that sentiment by yawning. “Yea, I like being out, but it’s the last week or Summer break,” Grant stated.</p>
