<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Somehow, a virus that could transform anyone who drank it to a seemingly random article of clothing had found its way into a home where a teenage party was currently going on, though admittedly not a too big party. Still, it didn’t take long before one of the guests there tapped some water from the sink, unaware of the extra ingredient. It was a blue-haired girl of average height, her hair only around shoulder length and with green eyes. Her bust is a B cup, and her curves are pretty average. ...Oh, and her name’s Belle.<br />
She’s wearing a simple, pale purple dress with white frills, the skirt of the dress passing her knees. She’s a bit too modest to wear anything more revealing… <br />
<br />
In any case, a few minutes after drinking the water, Belle raised her hand up to her forehead, giving it a gentle rub as she groaned softly - she began to feel off all of a sudden. Concerned, s friend of her’s, Bianca, put a hand on her shoulder.<br />
“Hey, you feeling okay?” Bianca asked, only to get a little nod in response. <br />
“Y-yeah… Um, just need some fresh air.” Belle claimed, letting herself out of the room, and then out of the house itself. She took her phone out and switched on the camera to look at herself. She looked pale… Though, as she stared at her face, she noticed something… Her nose looked kind of flat, and round. Hesitantly, she touched it, only to pull her hand back - it was cold, and hard! “What…? That’s not right…” She mumbled to herself, but all of a sudden, she feels the cold air against her skin… And upon looking down, her face turned bright red, and her arms clasped around her body - she was naked! ...Somehow! Hastily, she glanced around in the immediate area, as if they had just...fallen off or something, as illogical as that sounded. Not that them disappearing in the first place was normal. Even worse, she’s in public…<br />
<br />
She turned around, about to hurry back inside when she lost her balance, stumbling before she fell onto her stomach. “Ow…” She groaned, looking back at her legs - they felt off. Her eyes went wide at what she saw, however. Her legs looked like they were straight up folding into themselves, regressing into a mass that’s steadily going up to her body itself. Freaked out, she tries to crawl towards the door, but then...she couldn’t get a grip. Her fingers were forming together, but losing their strength at the same time.Her thumb stretched out even more than a rest, leaving them in a circle-like shape, only with a gap between her thumb and index finger. Heck, that gap seemed to just even bigger, as the gap travelled down her forearm. Still, there’s no blood - she could barely even feel anything! All the while, her hand was turning white. <br />
“I-I need to get help…!” She thought out loud, but it was getting more and more difficult for her to even move properly. Her hands were getting floppy, hollow… Bones and musculature vanishing, making it impossible for her to do basically anything with. Her legs were basically entirely gone, sunken into her butt and not even leaving a trace of them behind. Even her butt started to flatten, too, experiencing the same changes as her hands - her waist was hollowing out! She grimaced as she felt an odd sensation - even stranger than anything else so far. It felt like her pussy and butt were both getting stretched open, and not in a good way! ...At all. All she could do to even fight...whatever was going on, was to squirm and twist her steadily changing body.<br />
“M-my arms look like…” Her voice trailed off… She couldn’t believe what she was seeing. Her arms looked like shirt sleeves! A	 plain, white color, her hands had become cuffs - buttons and all, which used to be her nails. At this point, her pussy and asshole had turned into cloth. on the inside, too… They were getting so wide that the holes started to fuse into one, leaving her lower recion just completely open. “N-no, stop…!” She pleaded to nobody in particulat, as her body just kept losing its mass, collapsing down on the ground as it steadily follows out, guts, fat, and anything else fading away from her stomach, and her breasts were flattening out, too. If nothing else, she managed to force her body to roll over on her back so she could see what was happening a bit better. But what she was met with was the sight of her body opening up along the middle, much to her horror...but it then is closed up again as buttons quickly form along where it at opened, only to magically button itself up.<br />
“B-Bianc...a…!” Her voice was fading now, too! Her torso had already began to flatten out, and her neck was next - it was sinking into her torso, losing the ability to speak in the process. All she could do was give a few whispers for help, before the opening gap and buttoning up reached her mouth. At that moment, it felt like something pulled on her head, stretching out and flattening it, before then bending it along the middle, into a shirt collar… She couldn’t move her head anymore, and could just stare up at the sky… Even as her eyes shrunk and just became buttons on the collar, she could still see…<br />
<br />
To anyone passing by, it would just look like someone had left a perfectly fine dress shirt on the ground. But Belle’s mind was racing. How did this happen? How in the world is she going to get help now?! She can’t talk, or even move in the slightest! Though then she could hear footsteps, someone was coming towards her...</p>
