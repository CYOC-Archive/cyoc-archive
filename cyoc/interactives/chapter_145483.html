<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Maddie looked over herself frowning as she realized nothing had changed. “Huh guess there are some limits to my wishes,” she mumbled. The girl was still amazed though that she had gone from a grown woman to a girl of 12. Crossing to the bathroom once more Maddie gazed at her appearance, giggling as she thought back to her childhood. “Well now I remember why I didn’t think I looked cute at this age,” she giggled, noticing the lisp her braces gave her. “Definitely looked like a dork.”<br />
<br />
Maddie smiled, showing off her braces, fifith and sixth grade had been rough for the girl. She was only starting to grow into her body at the time. Add a mouth full of braces and she remembered not exactly being the most popular kid in school. That changed when she went into seventh grade. Maddie lost her braces and blossomed into a very cute teen, It was also around that time that she began to move away from gymnastics as she made new friends and in her words became one of the mean girls.<br />
<br />
“You know this isn’t so bad,” she mused. “I mean, I’d rather not have to grow up all over again but I got to admit, haven’t felt this energetic in years.” Out fo curiousity Maddie now stepped into back into her kitchen, taking a deep breath the girl now attempted a handstand, surprised she had not only the strength but the flexibility to pull the move off with ease. “Wow,” she exclaimed happily. “I’m so flexible again. Haven’t been able to do that in years.” Maddie giggled as she looked down at her barely their breasts. “Then again usually have something up here that throws off my balance.”<br />
<br />
Maddie giggled as she now began dong some minor tumbling through her kitchen. Despite her workout routine as an adult, Maddie hadn’t had the type of flexibility she once had. Now though, being over 30 years younger, she found back hand springs, cartwheels, and even forward flips came naturally and easily. Smiling ear to ear the energetic 12 year old marveled at her renewed flexibility, grabbing her foot as she extended it over her head. “Probably would of pulled something if I tried that as a grown up,” she giggled.<br />
<br />
Maddie decided to head up to her bedroom now so she could get a better look at herself in her full length mirror. She was curious at just how small she had become. As she entered her bedroom she was amazed. The room definitely seems larger now, standing in front of her mirror the girl could only stare at her childish appearance. “Wow,” she whispered. “Between the braces, the outfit and the ponytail I really do like me at 12. I wonder though, what else can I change about me? Seems like my wishes only affect my age and my clothes.”<br />
<br />
Taking a deep breath Maddie now decided to test her theory. “Eleven,” she said. Maddie shivered, as she gazed at her appearance she gasped as she shrank slightly while her small breasts completely vanished, leaving her now a child. “Oh my gosh,” she whispered, noticing the childish tenor of he voice. “I just made myself even younger.” Maddie frowned as she gazed at her childish clothes, they were a little baggier on her young frame. “Guess I have to wish for my clothes to fit me when I change my age.” Looking back at her herself Maddie decided to try it one more time. “Ten,” she said. “And clothes for a ten year old.”<br />
<br />
Maddie shivered once more, watching as she shrank yet again. The young girl now had no signs of adulthood, a cute childish face, framed by her long sandy brown hair gazed back at her. Happily she noticed her clothes shrink down with her, now they were no longer baggy fitting her perfectly. As she smiled, she now noticed her braces were long gone. The girls slightly crooked teeth smiled back at her. “Wow back in fourth grade,” she giggled. “Glad no ones around, they’d probably ask me where my parents were.”<br />
<br />
Maddie couldn’t help but giggle as she looked at the innocent looking girl in the mirror. Maddie recognized herself from her memories yet still couldn’t comprehend she was in a way reliving her own childhood. What was even crazier was how energetic and hyper she now felt. Maddie was practically overflowing with energy now, almost bouncing in place as she gazed at the mirror. “Now I know why my parents had me participate in so many sports,” she said. “Never felt so energetic, never would of believed I was a hyperactive kid.” Maddie now gazed over at her bed, an devilish smirk slowly spreading across her face. If she looked like a kid and felt like a kid, she might as well act like a kid. Laughing with maniacal glee, the happy 10 year old now launched herself towards her bed bouncing hard on her mattress.<br />
<br />
Maddie now found herself bouncing higher and higher as she performed flips and somersaults. Giggling like a school girl Maddie continued jumping on her bed, listening to the boxspring creak under her forceful actions. Landing in a giggling and sweaty heap Maddie lay on her bed for a moment. As weird as this was she found herself thoroughly enjoying herself. “So much fun,” she exclaimed wiping her brow. As she sat up she glanced once more at the clock. The boys wouldn’t be back from their concert for another couple of hours, she still had plenty of time to play. The only question was, what to do next.</p>
