<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Todd Davis, a 12-year-old boy, with short blond hair, turquoise eyes and an athletic built is sitting in his room at his desk, looking at his bed. On his bed are lying two costumes, one is a prince costume, the other a princess costume. The boy has a excited smile on his face, ‘I can’t wait for Halloween to arrive! Only two more weeks,’ he thinks to himself. Todd had bought the costumes for him and his girlfriend “Emma”, they had planned to do a theme this year, “Emma” would go as “Elsa” and Todd would go as “Elsa’s” boyfriend “Kristoff” from the animation “Frozen”. The costume weren’t cheap, Todd had to pay over 200 USD to get realistic quality costumes.<br />
<br />
A week before Halloween, Todd receives a unpleasant message from “Emma”, “I am sorry, I got to end our relationship. It is because my parents decided to move to a different country, Germany, we are leaving in two days, which means I won’t be here for halloween. We’d be to far apart for the relationship to stay stable. I am so sorry Todd, farewell…”. Todd couldn’t believe what he was reading, his jaw drops, first he feels sadness rise in him which quickly turns to anger.<br />
<br />
“HOW DARE SHE,” he shouts, throwing his phone against the wall, luckily the phone case is thick enough that the phone does not brake. The boy brakes down and sobs, “why… why did she do that,” he asks himself.<br />
<br />
The door to his room opens and his 34-year-old brother “Damian” sticks his head through the crack. “Todd, everything alright,” he asks.<br />
<br />
Todd looks up at his big brother, with an angered expression on his face, his eyes red and swollen from crying. “Do I look all right,” he asks with a growl.<br />
<br />
Damian shakes his head, “nope,” he says, “do you want to talk about it or tell me what is wrong”?<br />
<br />
Todd looks at his brother, “Emma… she…,” he starts.<br />
<br />
“Oh…,” Damian says, understanding exactly what has happened. He steps into the room and closes the door, he then walks up to Todd and sits down next to him on the boy’s bed. “Listen Todd,” he starts, “there is no point to be mad, she is not worth it”.<br />
<br />
“I know that, Damian,” the boy says, “she is not the reason that I am so mad”.<br />
<br />
“What is it then,” Damian asks.<br />
<br />
Todd points to the costumes, which are hanging on a clothes rack, “those costumes,” he says. “We… we had planned to go as “Elsa” and “Kristoff” from the movie “Frozen”. I paid over 200 fucking USD to get authentic, realistic and the best quality costumes.”<br />
<br />
“200?! You spent all your savings on costumes,” Damian asks in disbelief.<br />
<br />
Todd nods, “she… was worth it,” the boy says, “she was the love of my life, I can’t return the costumes, so I am stuck with them”. The boy looks at his brother, “how am I going to find a girl to take Emma’s place in three days”?<br />
<br />
Damian is silent, ‘I want to help my brother,’ he thinks to himself, ‘I might have an idea how I could help him’.<br />
<br />
Todd sees that his brother is thinking about something, “what are you thinking of, bro”?<br />
<br />
Damian looks at Todd, “I might have an idea,” he says. Todd looks at Damian questionably, “there is this experimental program called “the Chronivac”. It is available for phones and computers”.<br />
<br />
“And what exactly is this program and how would it help me with my problem”?<br />
<br />
Damian chuckles, “I am getting there,” he says, “the program, supposedly, is able to transform people, animals and objects into all kinds of stuff”.<br />
<br />
“Oh really,” Todd asks sarcastically, “like what”?<br />
<br />
“Well, apparently it can transform a male into a female. It can even transform a male into an exact copy of a female, like a twin or clone,” Damian continues, “it even can transform humans into inanimate objects like cars, toys,…”.<br />
<br />
Todd’s eyes widen, “so you are telling me,” he says, “I could use this program to transform a friend into a female version of himself or even into “Emma”,” he asks.<br />
<br />
Damian nods, “that is what they are saying about this program at least,” he says, “I don’t own it myself, so I haven’t tried it out, I heard it isn’t that common and very hard to get”.<br />
<br />
“Well, let’s see if we can’t find it,” Todd says, “I am curious and want to know if this is real”. The boy gets from his bed and picks up his phone, he opens the app-store and starts to search.<br />
<br />
Damian knows, that once Todd has his mind set on something, there is no way to change his mind, so he just silently watches his brother.<br />
<br />
“Found it,” Todd suddenly says.<br />
<br />
Damian raises an eyebrow, “that was… quick,” he says, “I guess the app-version is easier to find”.<br />
<br />
“Seems like it,” Todd says, “there are two versions. One is a free version, I believe a kinda beta-version. It says that a few features are locked and only accessible when upgrading to the main app,” he says.<br />
<br />
“How much does the full version cost,” Damian asks.<br />
<br />
Todd checks, “around 20 USD,” he says.<br />
<br />
“That’s not to bad,” Damian says, “are there any comments and/or ratings”?<br />
<br />
Todd checks, “only one, and it is a full star rating, but no comment”.<br />
<br />
“Hm… how about you download the beta-version first,” he suggests, “and use it for a “test-run”, to see if it actually works, before buying the app”.<br />
<br />
“Good idea,” Todd says, he downloads and installs the app, “okay, done. Let’s have a look”. He opens the app, “there is a welcome message. It says here to do a scan of the surroundings, by simply pressing the “scan” button”.<br />
<br />
“Do it,” Damian says.<br />
<br />
So Todd presses the scan button and his eyes grow wide, “it shows your name and mine,” he says.<br />
<br />
“Oh? What happens when you tap on our names,” Damian asks.<br />
<br />
Todd taps on his name and his eyes grow even wider, “it shows everything about me… even extremely personal stuff,” he looks up at his brother, “this app is scary”.<br />
<br />
Damian nods, “yeah… I’d hate it if someone would use the… thing on me and know everything about me”.<br />
<br />
Todd opens Damian’s file and starts to read, then he laughs, “damn bro,” he says, “I didn’t know you were attracted to 16 year old boys”.<br />
<br />
Damian gulps, “pl-please, don’t tell anyone,” he says.<br />
<br />
“Don’t worry bro,” Todd says, “I won’t, besides I know you are gay. I just didn’t know what age class you were interested in and also that you are submissive. I guess that explains why you are still single”.<br />
<br />
Damian nods and lets out a sad sigh, “yeah… I accepted that I never ever will have a partner,” he says, “which 16-year-old would be interested and dominate a 34-year-old man”?<br />
<br />
There is a long silence, “um… so what should I try out,” Todd then asks.<br />
<br />
“Well, how about something small,” Damian asks.<br />
<br />
“Like what,” Todd asks back.<br />
<br />
Damian shrugs, “I dunno,” he says, “like… change your hair color? Make your hair longer? Make yourself older or younger”?<br />
<br />
“Hm… w-would it be okay if I’d change your hair color,” Todd asks.<br />
<br />
Damian thinks for a while, but then smiles and nods, “sure, how about… blue”?<br />
<br />
Todd nods, he opens his brother’s file and changes the color of his hair from blond to blue. The boy looks up after hitting confirm and his jaw drops as his eyes widen, “it… works”!<br />
<br />
“Really!? I gotta see this,” Damian stands up and walks over to his brother’s mirror, “darn… I actually like the color,” he says.<br />
<br />
“Unbelievable,” Todd whispers, looking down at his phone, “I’ll definitely upgrade it,” he then says.<br />
<br />
Damian turns around to look at Todd, “okay, do you have someone in mind you could ask to become a girl for one night”?<br />
<br />
Todd nods, “I will ask Brian, him and me are very close friends,” he says, “I am positive that he’ll do me the favor”.<br />
<br />
Damian nods, “okay, Todd,” he says, “are you feeling better now”?<br />
<br />
Todd smiles, “yeah, thanks Damian,” he says, Damian smiles back.</p>
