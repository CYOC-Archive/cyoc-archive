<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mary leaned her head back against the door, doing her best to ignore the feeling of her modestly pointed ears folding against the wood and the sensation of a long, floppy tongue in her mouth as she took a deep breath. Panicking wasn&#39;t going to help things. What she needed now was to get up, and do... Something. She wasn&#39;t going to have much luck fiddling with the vials or her phone scrabbling about on the floor like this... Bracing her left hand-paw against the door and grasping towards the vanity with her right, she slowly strained to get back to a bipedal position, noting how stiff and ache-ridden her joints felt and the lack of dexterity her stubby digits had. She hurt, and she no doubt looked like a hunchback- but it was a start. With a low grunt, she lifted her sundress up as carefully as she could, to say, not very. Several of the vials spilled right out onto the hard tile floor and loudly shattered; &quot;Fffuckring Shrit,&quot; Mary growled through bared teeth, Max sharing the sentiment as he began to loudly bark through the door in reaction. Her hearing had noticeably improved, at a really bad time. She dumped the remainder of the vials onto the table around the sink with a complacent sigh, only now catching a serious look of herself in the mirror, one of her stubby, paw-like hands covering the front of her snout with a gasp.<br />
<br />
She recalled how a kinda-awkward coworker of hers&#39; had once compared her looks to Catwoman, with her short black hair, fair skin, and striking blue eyes. Perhaps ironically, she was now looking more like some kind of hunched over, mutated were-dog. A cat&#39;s worst nightmare. Her hair had survived the changes thus-far, as had her eyes - but she could feel the changes working their horrible magic on her with no end. She wondered for a moment why the instructions to the vials hadn&#39;t mentioned anything like this, her harelipped snout curling into a pout- &#39;Oh, sorry. Forgot to mention! If you come into close contact with an animal after taking a vial, you&#39;ll start rapidly turning completely into an animal with no way to stop it! If that weren&#39;t enough, your changes&#39;ll probably be hijacked and you&#39;ll end up a perfect fuckbuddy for whatever pet or wild animal you were just playing with. Fun, right?&#39; She shook her head. Would it have really been that hard to put a warning?! Her eyes felt fuzzy, and colors were suddenly looking... Weird. Mary&#39;s eyes shot to her mirror, internally kicking herself for allowing herself to go on a tangent at such a bad time. She could do nothing but watch as her snout clenched itself open, bones clicking and snapping at her sensitive, growing doberman&#39;s ears, growing slightly longer, and longer. She glanced up and down from the mirror in regular intervals, rattling around the vials feverishly in her paw-hands, looking for something that would stop her from turning completely into an animal. It was made significantly harder by the fact that her vision was changing. Colors were draining, her vision going grey and de-saturated like an old photograph. She could see her irises darkening from a striking blue to a dull, flat brown before her. No such thing as a blue-eyed Doberman.  She could still see in tinges of yellow, some blues, whites, and greys-- but things like the stereotypically pink bar of soap she kept on the vanity were just gone. Thankfully the vials were labelled by crude logos rather than color, or she&#39;d be screwed... <br />
<br />
Unfortunately, it looked like half of the vials she&#39;d taken were of a canine or lupine nature. Even if she tried one, it was likely that Max being so close would just cause her to change into him again, and the other half was... Weird garbage, mostly. Body modifications. Shrinking, growing, stuff she really didn&#39;t want to experiment with, but she might not have a choice- she was still glancing up at the mirror, and her reaching nose was looking less and less like it had hints of humanity in it by the second, and her hair was starting to blend with her budding black fur coat. On the other hand, her eyesight may have gotten worse, but her sense of smell and hearing were both seeing colossal improvement. It was hard to think straight with all these sounds rattling through her twitching ears, which were growing to point further and further through her hair, and all these wondrous new smells wafting through her wet, sniffing nostrils.  Mary took an especially long sniff at the scent wafting in from the other side of the door, closing her eyes and ignoring the wet, pleasant sensation upon her lips while absorbing it- thick, masculine, pungent... It smelled faintly of sex, like he was ready for-- <br />
<br />
She shook her head at that disgusting thought, opening brown eyes to the sight of her glossy lips having turned black, flattened against her snout-y face  Her heart skipped a beat. She was crossing the point of looking more like a funny dog than a changing woman, and on top of that- she swore her reflection had been higher-up before she took in that scent. If she shrank much more, she wouldn&#39;t be able to prop herself up like this! She had to find a vial fast-- <br />
<br />
Her ears twitched again. A close sound. Jiggling? Big brown eyes widened, and a whimper wormed its way out from her chest. It couldn&#39;t be. She turned to see the knob jiggling, briefly. Then again. She jumped, going for the knob to lock it. Her forepaws impacted on the door and she reached for the knob in a panic, only to find that her increasingly stubby fingers simply weren&#39;t dexterous enough to actually lock it, digits desperately fingering the notch on the bathroom door. Mary attempted to hold the door closed- it did not take long for the brawnier dog to force his weight into the door, forcing it open and sending Mary teetering humorously back onto her back on the rear wall, whining. <br />
<br />
Mary&#39;s heart pounded in her chest as the Doberman padded right into the  room. She took deep, uneven breaths... And couldn&#39;t stop herself, her floppy tongue lolling out of her mouth as she began to pant, taking in unwilling scents of the musky, brutish dog every time she breathed in. Max stopped, nosing down at the groin area of this weird smelling female, under the damaged remains of her long sundress. Mary could not move or hope to escape; She was sitting on her butt, leaning against the wall, limbs out... Just as they were beginning to change, bony joints stiffening and beginning to bend, re-configuring her stance to that of a creature built to walk on all fours.  Max, meanwhile, was growing frustrated with this flowery cloth impeding him from getting a proper sniff at this female- he growled, widening his stance and lashing out, Mary yelping in turn as the Doberman mutt took the cloth in tooth and began viciously shaking and tugging at it, rending the already worn garment in moments in his thick claws. Mary whined and whimpered- she had already shrank a fair bit, and as such, she began to slide -out- of the dress as max tore it off of her canine form, being dragged along the floor a bit... Finally liberated with one final yank of Max&#39;s mighty jaws, Mary shuddering as the sound of the SHRIP hit her sensitive notched ears and the cool conditioned air of the apartment met her budding pink teats. She had an almost anthropomorphic face leaning towards doggy, a human torso with teats with black & brown fur crawling down it from her arms like a mold,  and arms and legs that looked more dog than human, but with half the length of a human&#39;s to them. It was surreal to look at, even worse to feel.<br />
<br />
The male doberman leaned over again, giving her warm cooch a sniff, sticking his nose deep between her legs, nosing at her black nub of a tail curiously and moving back to her slit. His nose drew closer and closer, and she felt herself shivering in anticipation... Then, he stopped. Had he given up? D-did he recognize her as human? Max padded closer to her... And pawed at her, nosing and nudging at her from behind. Feeling force, Mary found herself tumbling onto all fours, her joints too stiff to prevent cool pawpads from meeting the tile floor-  it took not more than a second later for Max to bark, hopping up and positioning his pawpads on her lower back. It was a little awkward, Mary not being fully doggy sized yet. She shuddered from his touch and took in another meaty whiff of his musky sex, the red, vaguely rocket-shaped organ sliding out of his fuzzy sheathe; a faint crackling signalled her body adapting further, and Mary could only whimper and look down in horror as her arms and legs shrank further into her body, Max&#39;s paws re-positioning into a more comfortable position, any semblance of dexterity fading from her plump, stubby digits as her hands crossed over into becoming full-on paws, like her feet. Gritting her fanged teeth, Mary knew that he was going to cut the foreplay soon- if she didn&#39;t act, she was in for one hell of a night. But the second she tried to move, Max leaned forwards, pressing his full weight down on her heavily and growling next to her ear. She was stuck, and... Even if she could have got out, the growling made her feel... Strangely complacent. Like she had made a mistake, and he had rightfully called her out on it. The more breaths in she took, the more she found herself in agreement, but- no, not this again! &quot;Mraxx!&quot; Mary yelped hoarsely, her vocal chords itchy, awkward. The male seemed rather confused for a moment, looking around for a source to the voice but finding nobody around. &quot;Mraxx, prease shtop! Hown! B-braaaht Tog!&quot; Max didn&#39;t seem to understand. &quot;Srrrrop! Rrrrraxx!&quot; It was becoming very difficult to form words, let alone complete sentences-  then there was that niggling voice, telling her that she didn&#39;t WANT him to stop, one that she almost considered listening to for a brief moment, her tail wiggling upwards...<br />
<br />
Then Max plunged into her tight furry black cunt, balls deep.<br />
<br />
If she were in the right mind to do it, Mary would have been unable to describe the feelings racking her mind. Pure, primal ecstasy. She didn&#39;t want to get screwed by a dog, she had known that, but-- right now, she WAS a dog. It was hard to argue- as Max pressured her with his overwhelming weight, she could feel her muscles constricting, reshaping, repackaging themselves along with her skeletal structure into a smaller form. Her torso, which had remained relatively human thus far was changing dramatically with such close contact to the catalyst of her extended transformations, shortening and rounding out, her ribs growing more visible to the common eye against her short black fur, joints crackling as her paws were locked into a forwards-position, her spine shortening, her form shrinking until she was overall, just the size of a female dog- smaller than him. Each violent hump into her aching sex only seemed to make her change more, Mary tensing her short black claws, scraping them against the floor, groaning in lust. &quot;Rrrhrrrs...&quot; Max didn&#39;t even react, unaware that she had even attempted to call out the name of her unwilling suitor. Her speech was gone. Mary panted lustily as she felt something swelling within her, the male&#39;s knot swelling as he began to spurt glob after glob of messy pre-cum and semen deep into her. She made a mournful noise that couldn&#39;t be recognized as human as her neck began to thicken out, lengthening and and bulging with new muscle. The humps continued, as did the growls, and the periodic cumming, growing more intense by the moment; Mary barely even registered as her snout crackled and extended, finally growing out to the full size of a doberman, tickling her nose as whiskers slipped out the sides. Her fading pixie cut grew shorter and shorter until it was essentially absorbed by her similarly dark fur, leaving her &quot;bald&quot; atop her head.<br />
<br />
Her changes complete, Max was turned on as ever- and Mary, the female doberman couldn&#39;t help but find herself exhilarated by their mating. He was vicious, bestial, and unlike a human, he didn&#39;t just cum once, it was a constant assault, with the knot in place to prevent her from pulling out before she got all the cum she needed. This continued for some time, for almost twenty minutes, though the female&#39;s mind was too foggy and weak to count precisely; the knot had continued to swell until Mary could feel it at all times and they were well and truly locked together, unable to part with the greatest of Max&#39;s strength, not to mention all the lubrication they were making.  The ejaculations only got more and more intense with each one, until finally, after a particularly agonizing five minute weight, the male reared back as far as he could, growled, and- <br />
<br />
&quot;Arooooo!&quot; Max howled in climax, Mary finding herself unable to resist doing the same as he splooged the remainder of his load deep within her gushing crevice, his warm seed filling her with an immense feeling of instinctual satisfaction.<br />
<br />
And then, Max... Slumped. Dogs weren&#39;t much for pillow talk, and now, he had nothing to do but wait for his knot to deflate, and then he&#39;d probably eat something. Mary couldn&#39;t do anything either, even as her composure began to return to her, as did a great sense of shame. She had just fucked her neighbors dog, and she couldn&#39;t even try to deny it- she had LOVED it. Her tongue lolled out of her mouth,  downright exhausted. That wasn&#39;t even the worst thing. She had turned completely into a dog! She didn&#39;t have thumbs! She&#39;d lost her hair! She looked like a smaller, female version of him! What was she going to do? Could she even get the vials open like this? There were some nearby, but she was attached to Max by his -knot-, something she was still having trouble getting over, and-- oohgh, she could hear his breaths, and still pick up his scent...! Her whiskers twitched. Damn sensitive nose...! She growled.</p>
