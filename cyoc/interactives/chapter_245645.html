<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Bronwyn thoroughly enjoyed every detail of her new body. The cute little sewn-on face and triangular leopard nose, bearing no resemblance to the human features she’d always hated. The feeling of the fluff that had replaced her internal organs shifting around freely inside of her. The large bappy paws that had replaced her hands. And the fact that she didn’t need their dexterity or their fingers anymore to please herself. She had nothing to play with down there anyway.<br />
<br />
But the loss of her penis, and the continuing lack of a pussy, didn’t dull the pleasure one bit. Instead, a gentle swipe of her arm’s stubby end against her featureless crotch was more than enough to get her going. Bronwyn shuddered with every strand of fabric that rubbed against another strand, loving the way that she could <i>feel</i> all of them as part of herself. And that tail - which she could control with a thought like any other limb - was even more sensitive than her paws. She could rub the space between her legs with the tip of her tail, while both arms were busy bracing her against the bed. Hands-free masturbation, and another welcome reminder that she wasn’t human anymore.<br />
<br />
Bronwyn had always been a bit indecisive when thinking of what type of TF was her favorite. She loved the idea of behaving like a wild animal, but was equally obsessed with the thought of being treated as roughly and disposably as an inanimate object. It was why she’d taken her new magical artifact to the zoo in the first place, only to end up fixating on a mascot costume when she got there. But now, as she yowled and hissed for more, her lower paws kicking with a soft dull rhythmic <i>thump</i> against the foot of her bed, she felt like she was finally getting the best of both worlds.<br />
<br />
All of these thoughts turned her on so much more than any stroke of flesh against flesh ever could. “Hot” was the wrong word - with no blood rushing through veins, no sweat glands to soak her skin, she didn’t feel any warmer than before. But her mind - which apparently didn’t need a physical brain to keep itself going - was flooded with the sensations of her new body, which only grew stronger the more she thought about them. Even if she had wanted to think about something else, she couldn’t focus on anything but this.<br />
<br />
Just when she was on the verge of a conniption fit, she suddenly thrust herself over the hill of climax. The mind-blowing wave of orgasm crashed through her, every inch of her body feeling it with equal strength. And there was nothing she would have to clean up later. No stains on the sheets - and no sweaty human inside the costume to make a mess there either. She could ride the wave without a care in the world.<br />
<br />
And when all of that was done, Bronwyn just laid back on the bed in bliss. Her lightweight plush body couldn’t even make an indentation in the mattress underneath her. Whenever she stopped moving for a moment, she looked like a cuddly toy tossed aside rather than a person who could have left it there. She couldn’t wait until her girlfriend saw her like this.<br />
<br />
She was more comfortable than she’d ever been in her life - except for one very small problem. Like the old fairy tale of the princess and the pea, Bronwyn felt something hard and dense caught between the softness of her faux-fur and the softness of the bedding. <i>Right, of course, the zipper,</i> she thought to herself. <i>Well, I won’t be needing that anymore. I’d be happy to get stuck in this form permanently. Might as well peel that thing off so I can <b>really</b> get comfortable.</i><br />
<br />
But when she sat up to inspect her fuzzy back, she quickly noticed the gleaming golden magic zipper was actually stuck onto her side. That wasn’t the hard bit of metal she’d felt. <i>Then what...</i>, she thought before she spotted it. The costume came with its own zipper, of course, and it was still attached to her - part of her - even though there was nothing to use it for. Or was there?<br />
<br />
She tentatively prodded at the zipper’s tiny handle with a paw. It certainly looked as functional as any other zipper, and yet it felt like another part of her body. Her mind raced with questions. What would happen if she pulled it open? Would it feel like spilling her fluffy guts out? Would she lose the ability to move? Would it just boot her out of the costume in her disappointing human form?<br />
<br />
It was risky to mess with the magic in such an unintended fashion, that much was certain. If she ended up in some helpless, motionless state, she might be stuck that way for a long time. But her curiosity got the better of her - as did the incredibly arousing thought that another person could step inside her body and wear her as a costume. After all, if she’d been too afraid to try the magic zipper in the first place, she never would’ve had the transcendent experience she was enjoying now.<br />
<br />
Bronwyn was still nervous, but her mind was made up. She just had to find out what would happen if she opened the other zipper. Carefully, she snagged it on one of her little plastic claws. She squeezed her eyes shut tight, which somehow still worked, and resolved to yank herself open on the count of three.<br />
<br />
One... Two...</p>
