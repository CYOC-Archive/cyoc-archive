<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">{{Alright!}} You broadcast to the company that&#39;s gathered below you, {{I&#39;ll do another jump... Just... Okay! Here I go!}} Hurting all over and not really wanting to stay on that tower any longer, you brace yourself for flight. You notice the wind has picked up a little and is at your back, that&#39;s one good thing at least. Spreading your wings, the pain from your previous exertions come back with a vengeance and it makes you wince. This slight movement, coupled with your precarious position on the tower, is enough for your wings to catch a strong gust and blow you from your perch.<br />
<br />
You don&#39;t know what to do. You&#39;re in enough pain to send your world spinning around you as your eyes cross... or maybe that&#39;s just you in an earthbound  tailspin. Your vision fades almost to black as you desperately try to flap your wings to get out of your downward trend, then a small piece of advice floats into your mind {{Use your tail! Use your damn tail to get out of the dive! Come on!}} That wasn&#39;t you remembering anything, that was just Dizzy screaming in to your mind as you plummeted to the ground. Heeding his words, you try to adjust your flight path with your tail acting as a rudder to steer your body. Pain again. Lots of it, but you do manage to stabilize yourself, if only for a moment. <br />
<br />
Another gust of wind buffets you in the side, knocking you off course and into the trees. Seeing this, you try to correct yourself and actually succeed!...Maybe a little too well. You overcompensate and send yourself careening toward the village. To tired to to adjust yourself again and in too much pain to parachute yourself with your wings, there is little you can do as you see the tall structure of the village stables looming in front of you. There&#39;s no way you could ever hope to clear it. All of a sudden your vision goes blue.<br />
<br />
{{Oomph!}} A growl and a roll and all of a sudden you feel your direction change! You can feel your injured leg pressed against Dizzy&#39;s chest, your hind legs are tucked in tight and your talon-like feet are tightly gripping his thighs, drawing a small amount of blood. It seems he managed to fly under you as you flew haphazardly into the village, only to come up in front to grab you around your barreled chest and lift you back into the sky. You can see he is visibly straining, not only because you are a slightly bigger dragon the he is, but also because had just spent the better half of the day flying almost non-stop. His endurance is quite impressive... you&#39;d know.<br />
<br />
{{Holy, flaming pits of Ember&#39;s wrath, you&#39;re heavy!}} Dizzy ribs you as he is forced to heave your weight, {{Maybe flight training will help you shed a few pounds!}} He flashes a toothy smile, though it&#39;s somewhat strained. You play along with your smaller counter-part.<br />
<br />
{{Yeah, as soon as I break both my wings and have all my limbs amputated, I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll be quite the feather-weight by comparison}} You imagine yourself as a quadruple amputee, pushing yourself around in a wheeled stretcher with your tail... gross. {{Yeah, on second thought, maybe a life spent on my belly just isn&#39;t for me}} You stick your tongue out a little. Diz angles your flight path a little so that you are clinging to his chest as he flies upright.<br />
<br />
{{I certainly wouldn&#39;t mind seeing you on your back, later tonight...}} The azure dragon says with a wink. Soon enough, Dizzy is parachuting the two of you down to that sweet, sweet...slightly murderous,,, green earth. You couldn&#39;t be happier to be out of the sky as you both collapse into a heap of emerald green and kyanite blue scales. You really seem to be doing a lot of collapsing as of late, probably on account of you never actually catching One. Goddamned. Break.<br />
<br />
You start to fume a little at your lack of fortune, but are interrupted by what you initially take for an earthquake. {{Oh no, what now...? Can&#39;t I- .... What?}}Expecting the worst you look around to find the source of trouble, only to be taken aback by what is actually causing the disturbance. Not to far off, you can see that ornery, old lizard beside himself with laughter. He is rolling around in the earth, kicking up clods of dirt as he howls and roars with delight. Tears are running down his muzzle. All you can do is watch, dumbfounded. {{Well, at least somebody found my brush with death funny}} You pointedly accuse the amethyst drake.<br />
<br />
{{N-not... Just me... hehHAH!}} He can&#39;t stop himself, but manages to point at the gathered Kobold students. Every. Single. One is in hysterics as well. You really can&#39;t help but feel a little put down by this. Even among a diminutive race of flightless lizards, you&#39;ve managed to make yourself a laughing stock through your sheer ineptitude in flight. You lower your head in shame. It&#39;s but a moment before Dizzy-tail is at your side, nuzzling you to provide some comfort.<br />
<br />
{{Come on, you knew you weren&#39;t going to impress that old coot on your first try, it&#39;s probably a blessing in disguise that he found your last run so funny. I doubt he&#39;ll make you go again, at least not until tomorrow... or whenever he stops laughing...-If- he ever stops laughing}} You keep watching in amazement as Blunt-snout keeps on going, truly a connoisseur of slap-stick comedy and, as you know, the greatest comedy does come from tragedy. You can only imagine how funny he&#39;d have thought the whole situation was if you&#39;d -actually- died. He&#39;d have probably laughed himself into an early - and well-deserved - grave. Though, finally, it looks like he&#39;s calming down.<br />
<br />
{{Aah! Very good, very good indeed!}} He declares with a chuckle, {{I&#39;m quite sure that display was some of the best fun I&#39;ve had in my many -many- years!}} Blunt-snout sniffles a little bit, relaxing, {{And it looks like you&#39;ve inspired so many of the little ones! Look, they&#39;re almost clambering to get back in the tower! A shame they&#39;ll have to wait till tomorrow&#39;s lesson.}} You do notice many of the little Kolblings jumping up and down and chattering with excitement.<br />
<br />
{{Was I just that good?}} You inquire sarcastically. Expecting it to remain a rhetorical question, Blunt-snout strikes again.<br />
<br />
{{Hahah! NO! You were just so terrible that the little ones believe they can do better! Hah! I might have to agree!}} Shame tastes especially bitter when being ridiculed by two, separate generations. {{It would seem you&#39;ve really earned your meal today, go rest up! I&#39;ll be expecting a repeat performance tomorrow!}} The thought of burying your face in some actual food really appeals to you right now. Not only will you be able to sate your ravenous hunger, but you might be able to hide from the world inside the carcass while you&#39;re at it.<br />
<br />
{{Is there any way I can get you not to laugh tomorrow?}} Your words a little more bitter on your tongue than you had intended. The elder drake stands his full height so he can literally look down on you as he speaks.<br />
<br />
{{Only if you actually manage to fly, tomorrow. If you do, good, you&#39;re learning. If you don&#39;t, well, at least I&#39;ll have fun}} He flashes one of his fang-y grins, you just shake your head and sigh with resignation. You guess you did ask for this, you just thought it wouldn&#39;t hurt so much. Speaking of pain, you are holding your right foreleg into your chest in order to avoid putting pressure on it and your wings feel like they are going to fall off. They are currently draped down your sides, almost like a skirt, dragging on the ground. You&#39;ve also got a dull ache in almost every muscle group in your body, truly if pain equals gain then you should be shredded by tomorrow. A true Adonis of a dragon.<br />
<br />
{{Come on, Amber, lets get you something to eat for dinner. You&#39;ll need to get your strength up for tomorrow.}} Diz leads you back toward the stables where you share a compact stall, it&#39;s a good thing you love being so close to this drake. {{Maybe you&#39;ll have some room left for dessert?}} Your blue boy asks hopefully.<br />
<br />
{{Maybe...}} You tease with a lascivious grin, {{Depends on what the main course is...}} You lick your chops thinking about a more carnal hunger you&#39;d like to sate soon....</p>
