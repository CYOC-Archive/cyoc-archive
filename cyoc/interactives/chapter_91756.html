<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Clearing your throat in an attempt to break the silence, you start speaking, &quot;Well... I don&#39;t know how you guys got shrunk, other than that the voice seems to have had something to do with it, but I&#39;ll do my best to take care of you guys and get you back to normal if I can.&quot; <br />
    You don&#39;t know what type of reaction you were expecting, but the silence doesn&#39;t seem to help. &quot;Well,&quot; you say, &quot;I&#39;m going to go find some food, for breakfast, I&#39;ll bring some to you guys, waffles sound good?&quot; Alex says, &quot;Sounds fine&quot; and the rest of them mumble agreements too, so you get up and set off.<br />
<br />
On the way to your kitchen, you check the front door to make sure that you actually can&#39;t leave, like the voice told you. The rattling sound as it fails to open pretty much confirms that. Heading towards your fridge, you pause for a second to read the sticky note on it, &quot;Think about the food you want when you open it.&quot; Shrugging, you open the door with the intent to grab some waffles, then you take a step back as you&#39;re welcomed by the entire fridge being filled to the brim with waffle boxes. Welp, that&#39;s probably what the note meant. You grab a box and pull out a few to put in the microwave. On a whim, you step over to the fridge while they cook, and think of miniature waffles, meant for someone about the same size as your thumb, since that&#39;s about how big Alex looked like. You open the fridge and just find more waffles, much to your disappointment. Probably since Eggo doesn&#39;t make teeny tiny waffles. You look closer and do see that these ones are Eggo &quot;mini waffles&quot;, but they&#39;re still far to big.<br />
<br />
The toaster dings and you grab a plate and put some jam on before heading back to your room. You tear half a waffle into little pieces, then rap lightly on the door. Kylie peeks outside meekly. &quot;Foods here.&quot; You say, as you put the plate down. &quot;Kylie, Alex, Sadie, could you grab us some food?&quot; Comes Rachael&#39;s voice, &quot;Get it yourself!&quot; Alex says in a huff as she comes outside and grabs a piece of waffle, before walking over to you and sitting down. I watch as Kylie grabs an armful before running back inside. I turn to look at Alex as she stews to herself, &quot;That bad already?&quot; You ask. &quot;Seriously though...&quot; Is all she says. A few minutes later, Sadie comes out, looking just as pissed. She grabs her own piece of waffle them pauses. She looks back and forth between you, and the doorway for a few minutes, before shrugging and stalking over to next to where Alex is sitting. &quot;Ugh!&quot; She says as she flops down, &quot;Those girls....&quot; <br />
    &quot;Yea...&quot; I reply and Alex only nods, glaring at the door. Moving the rest of the waffle pieces to a napkin, you pick up the plate and start eating the waffles. It doesn&#39;t escape your notice the way Sadie flinches when you move quickly, she&#39;s clearly scared of you, but there&#39;s not much you can do about it, you&#39;re already moving slowly.<br />
<br />
You just finish your waffle when you hear the voice start talking to you again, &quot;Well this is boring!&quot; it says. &quot;What do you want?&quot; You grunt, then seeing the puzzled reaction of the two teens below, you say to them, &quot;The voice is talking...&quot;<br />
    &quot;Well I was just going to check in to see what you did to them, especially to the jerks, but all you did was feed them...&quot; Rolling your eyes, you wait for it to get to the point. &quot;Alright, so here&#39;s what we&#39;ll do, you get to choose one of them, to take with you, completely separate from the rest of them, then I&#39;ll tell you what happens to them!&quot; Deciding to test the waters, you say out loud, &quot;and what if I don&#39;t?&quot; The voice laughs, probably not a good sign.... &quot;If you don&#39;t I&#39;ll shrink one so tiny you can&#39;t even see them! I can do it, I mean, look at Alex!&quot; You instinctively start to look down, but Alex&#39;s yelp beat you to it. She&#39;s half the size she was before, drowning in her clothes, Sadie&#39;s just sitting there in shock, the waffle half to her mouth. &quot;Put her back!&quot; You yell at the voice. &quot;Eh, your no fun, but ok.&quot; It says, and as it does, Alex quickly grows back to about the size of your thumb. She scrambles quickly to pull her shirt and pants back on, after they had partially fallen off. The questioning looks she gives me doesn&#39;t quite match with the red of embarrassment and anger on her face, but she seems to get it&#39;s not my fault. Sadie however, seems to be terrified of me. Thinking I ask the voice, &quot;What will it take to make you put them back to normal size?&quot;<br />
<br />
It takes it&#39;s sweet time answering, but when it does, it says, &quot;If you do what I tell you to, I will! And right now I&#39;m telling you to take one and separate her from the rest of them for some unknown purpose. Make sure they all know too!&quot; Frustrated, you turn to Alex and ask her to get the others, she doesn&#39;t look happy about it, but she goes.<br />
<br />
   *******<br />
<br />
Alex&#39;s encounter with them, well, it went badly. You end up having to yell at them to get our here, or else, that gets then out. You sit down and start to explain that you need one of them for an &quot;Unknown purpose&quot;, according to the voice. In a spur of the moment decision though you add, &quot;I don&#39;t want to play by it&#39;s rules though, it wants me to pick one of you, I&#39;m going to let you guys pick.&quot; In your head, you hear, &quot;Ooh, this&#39;ll be interesting&quot; You ignore it, &quot;On the count of three, point to who you want to be chosen. One, two three.&quot; Sadie and Alex predictably point to Rebecca. Rebecca and Jennifer meanwhile, point straight at Alex. Bailey&#39;s pointing at Sadie, but Kylie looked at Rebecca as she voted, and copied her. That&#39;s three for Alex which is enough... You hope that this isn&#39;t a bad decision, but you guess taking Alex out might decrease the likelihood of a fist fight.<br />
<br />
You reach over and grab Alex. She screams at first and struggles, but you pin her in place and talk to her, &quot;Alex remember, it&#39;s me, I&#39;m not going to hurt you... Calm down.&quot; She stops screaming and takes a few deep breaths. &quot;Right, ok, I&#39;m fine now.&quot; In your head, you hear the voice again, &quot;Put her in your pocket!&quot; You hesitate, &quot;Do it or I&#39;ll shrink her again!&quot; You whisper &quot;Sorry&quot; then carefully drop her in your pocket before looking back at the rest of them. They look... well, understandably terrified. The majority of them scramble back into the house, with Kylie barely making it in, and Sadie being left behind. She backs against the door, pinning herself against it. You look at her, and feel bad for her, she&#39;s stuck with the jerks alone now. Before walking off, you kneel down to her and say, &quot;If they give you a hard time on anything, just tell me, I&#39;ll take care of it.&quot; She looks confused, then seems to calm down a bit when she realizes not only are you not going to hurt her, but you&#39;ll help her if she needs it, but you don&#39;t stick around to find out. You set off towards your living room so you can talk to Alex.<br />
<br />
   *******<br />
<br />
You reach into your pocket and wrap your fingers around Alex before pulling her out. You shift your hand a bit and she moves to sit down on top of it. &quot;What was up with that?&quot; She asks, she doesn&#39;t sound angry, more confused, &quot;I mean, I trust you and all, but couldn&#39;t you have just carried me?&quot; Setting her down on a coffee table, you simply reply, &quot;The voice.&quot; Shifting around on the table, she says, &quot;Oh. Speaking of which, why did you have to pick someone?&quot; Facing empty air, you say, Hey, voice I have someone, what do you want me to do?&quot; A few seconds of silence follow, then it says, &quot;Hmmm, well you can do whatever you want with he, just don&#39;t bring her back to the house. I won&#39;t tell you to do anything else to her!&quot; She must have seen my shoulders slump somewhat, since she asks what it said. &quot;I can do whatever i want except bring you back to the house, so I guess you get to just stay with me most of the time.&quot; She sits there, &quot;Oh. Well that&#39;s anti-climactic, but good. You had said that he&#39;d get you stuff if you asked for it right? Try asking for a computer the right size for me, that&#39;ll let us do something other than sit here all day.&quot; Turning to the empty air, you give the request and right next to Alex, a miniature laptop appears. You proceed to ask for a beanbag for her, and yourself, then the two of you play video games for a while, it&#39;s better than worrying about Rachael and her clique at least...<br />
<br />
    ******<br />
<br />
Eventually, you notice that it&#39;s past noon, and you decide to grab something to eat. You make yourself a sandwich and break off a piece for Alex, before heading back towards your room to give the rest of them some food. There however, you find....</p>
