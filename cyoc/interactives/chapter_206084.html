<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>The &quot;animal&quot; tag is more for some description of features gained post transformation...</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Doctor Miyamoto found that a lot of the work with Horizon&#39;s Tokyo office to be fairly rewarding while the strengthening of the colony on Heiya Island allowed for him to make periodic trips there when conversions were to be done there rather than somewhere else and then having the new Animalian come to Heiya Island. It also provided for something to do while waiting for colony building to be built in Tokyo that would allow for an Animalian colony in Tokyo. That still seemed some time off, and thus the need for a distraction. It brought him into contact with the pregnant Manami who was the head of the nursing staff at the Horizon Light facility on Heiya Island.<br />
<br />
&quot;I was surprised to hear that these five came here first rather than to Horizon&#39;s office in Tokyo,&quot; Doctor Miyamoto commented, &quot;I mean, we are equipped to handle the transformations... and Tokyo has allowed for Chel to live there...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Amphibians don&#39;t have fur, and that seems to be the thing that Tokyo apartment managers are concerned with,&quot; Manami answered as she shuffled the papers for the five Fukushima Plant survivors who had come to become Animalians, &quot;we grow in our winter coat and then shed it and the managers worry we&#39;ll aggravate people&#39;s allergies. So, they came here to Heiya Island.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Understandable, I suppose,&quot; Doctor Miyamoto sighed, &quot;how goes the pregnancy? Tsukuyomi happy?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He is,&quot; Manami answered, &quot;though some other issues have kept him busy and active that he can&#39;t be here... which in turn leaves me anxious for when I can give birth, as the pups do seem rather active.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s better than nothing,&quot; Doctor Miyamoto answered, &quot;so what do we have here with the five?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The first is Kongo, Hideki,&quot; Manami answered and passed the first set of papers, &quot;he wishes to be a Brown Bear, and specifically a Ussuri Brown Bear.&quot;<br />
<br />
Doctor Miyamoto nodded and took the papers and let Manami continue with the report as part of the coordination between the Hospital and Horizon.<br />
<br />
&quot;The second is Bashiro, Kento,&quot; Manami spoke and then handed the second set of papers, &quot;he wishes to be a Red Crowned Crane.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You might make a call to Lyre/Animalia for him,&quot; Doctor Miyamoto chuckled, &quot;the mother of the two young women that became Velociraptor Dinotopians is a Red Crowned Crane Animalian.&quot;<br />
<br />
Manami slowly nodded. Technically they didn&#39;t run a dating service at the hospital but given the rules regarding inter-species breeding among Animalia&#39;s edicts and some of the other surprises that came up, it often helped to be able to get in contact with others. It was something that seemed to at least provide for a sort of friendship between Lei-Wei and Muxing on Heiya Island, though Manami wasn&#39;t sure if their relationship had gone beyond just friendship or not. It was still something to be taken as a general positive for relations and everything else. Particularly as she looked at the next sets of papers and what could come from there.<br />
<br />
&quot;The next is Maeda, Yoshi, who wants to be a Giant Panda,&quot; Manami continued as she passed his papers over and then passed the next set after that, &quot;and after that is &quot;Maeda, Yumi. She is Yoshi&#39;s cousin. She wishes to be a Kiso-Uma.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Also setting up possible pairings... or at least attempts at them,&quot; Doctor Miyamoto chuckled, &quot;but all of that would be good to work with and set up.&quot;<br />
<br />
Manami nodded and prepared to hand over the last set of papers. She then spoke as she handed those papers over, &quot;the last is Tamaguchi, Hikari. She wishes to be a Hokkaido-Inu.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It must be a breed that she&#39;d had as a pat in her childhood... or she had made good friends with a dog of that breed while as a kid,&quot; Doctor Miyamoto commented, &quot;and it is nice to see... So many seem too often go for either large animals that would be powerful or are predators and thus are powerful.&quot;<br />
<br />
Manami nodded, &quot;I wouldn&#39;t know for sure... as my responsibility with them was to help them with the paperwork and oversee the initial examinations and tests. They are suffering from some cancers as a result of what happened at Fukushima. Their cancers would seem to be in remission, or at least in stages where they aren&#39;t in immediate danger. The conversion would then assure that they don&#39;t need to worry about the cancer coming back in the future.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And they&#39;ll be as healthy as your husband,&quot; Doctor Miyamoto smiled, &quot;and I can handle this. Thank you for your help.&quot;<br />
<br />
Manami nodded and then left, leaving Doctor Miyamoto to his task, and he then went out the mission in carrying out the conversions while Chel came from a back room and carrying the larger sets of clothing that future Animalians would need. This then led to the step-by-step process of carrying out the conversions. Doctor Miyamoto would each person into the conversion room that was provided, delivered the two shots and then departed with the customary &quot;welcome to Animalia&quot; that was part of how Horizon handled these things. He would then head out into the hallway to wait with Chel for when each new Animalian was ready to come out.<br />
<br />
The conversions also proved to follow the same sort of line that many of the conversions of those that had been exposed to nuclear radiation in some way or were converted by one who had been exposed to nuclear radiation. They were bigger and stronger than other Animalians of the same species and females seemed to be a bit curvier than they were, otherwise, which was all impressive given what seemed to be the standard build for Animalians in general. Hideki was comparable to some of the Polar Bear Animalians in terms of size and muscle mass, and Doctor Miyamoto thought he could note the outline of his musculature in that longer fur.<br />
<br />
Some were also quite happy and friendly, with Hikari offering a hug and an eager &quot;thank you&quot; as her new cream-white furred tail wagged behind her. She was actually comparable to Manami in terms of height and musculature.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ms. Manami will still be friends, right?&quot; Hikari asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I would imagine so,&quot; Doctor Miyamoto answered as Chel soon got a similar hug before accepting clothes that would fit her, &quot;though we will also need to provide the shots needed to make sure you&#39;re not infectious... and she can then schedule you for the standard shots and veterinary care.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Standard shots?&quot; Hikari asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Things like vaccination against Rabies and for you, Distemper,&quot; Doctor Miyamoto answered, &quot;even if those things aren&#39;t a problem here on Heiya Island, they would be concerns should you ever visit the Animalian colonies in the US or elsewhere. Visits to India&#39;s colony for yoga lessons would also require Rabies vaccinations.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh,&quot; Hikari blinked.<br />
<br />
&quot;And the hospital staff here can handle that,&quot; Doctor Miyamoto answered, &quot;I&#39;m only here to carry out the conversions.&quot;<br />
<br />
And that continued on with the others. All five of them marveled at how they had come out and were happy with the results, the increased musculature and the lack of the problems that the cancers they&#39;d had were no longer there. That was all good news, and Doctor Miyamoto was able to overhear some things as he finished his work, as he overheard Kento saying he was looking forward to actually being able to fly. It was something that Doctor Miyamoto was pleased with being able to observe.</p>
