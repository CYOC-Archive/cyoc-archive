<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Josh Kenney had not expected that this would be a part of his day&#39;s experience. The fact that he was standing there in front of the mirror, turned from his usual, rather athletic self into this...this odd embodiment of a different sort of masculine ideal. Sliding his hands up his taut, toned torso, Josh gulped as he looked at himself. His lips hanging open, his pretty features registering shock at the situation that had befallen him. His hair - now a platinum blond - gave the impression oddly enough of a more Swedish or Norwegian sort of ancestry as opposed to the one that might be expected by the fact the bottle seemed to involve Japanese characters in the listing and even the ingredient section.<br />
<br />
Even though his features were now far more androgynous and pretty than they&#39;d ever been before, he was not entirely displeased by the way his musculature had developed. While he was thinner in most ways, more compact, losing some shoulder width and an inch of arm size, he&#39;d seemingly been compensated for his losses by becoming vastly more toned in the process. He&#39;d never been able to see <i>abs</i> quite like he could see them now. The lines along the lower end of his torso, and even his obliques... all gave the impression of a body more devoted to tone than size.<br />
<br />
As much as Josh wanted to freak out, he knew he had to handle this until Eric left. Even though he didn&#39;t have much to complain about, it was still a big change to his body that he&#39;d definitely not been anticipating. He didn&#39;t know how Eric might react to what was going on. Hell, he might even flip out and decide Josh was some sort of weird pretty boy house invader. &quot;Just...gotta cool my jets. Hang out in the showers until Eric leaves for work...&quot;<br />
<br />
He figured he could spend some of that time acquainting himself with his new body.<br />
<br />
Josh turned and examined himself in the shower room mirrors, examining the form and body he&#39;d been given. His chest looked tighter, less large, but much more toned. He&#39;d never seen a divot like that, that he saw in the middle of his chest. He bit his lip lightly - not wanting to injure himself - and ran a thumb along the middle of his chest. Enhancing how good his chest looked was how hairless he was. Even where he did have some hair, the hairs were finer, shorter, and more blond - thus making them more difficult to see if one wasn&#39;t looking.<br />
<br />
Initially, the newly Scandinavian young man had been dreading what might&#39;ve happened to his cock.<br />
<br />
After all, the stereotype as far as he was concerned was that these kinds of guys were rarely packing anything downstairs worth speaking about... but when Josh examined his manhood, he was left tilting his head. Sure it was not quite so covered with hair as usual, but that seemed to be a positive thing now. With less obscuring his manhood, he could see that it looked about half an inch bigger. Even his balls were about their usual size.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well,&quot; Josh said as he stepped out of his boxers, &quot;Seems my stereotypes really were outta line.&quot;<br />
<br />
The young man couldn&#39;t hear anything like Eric shouting yet that he was going. Meaning he was still stuck up there. Shaking his head, Josh started the shower. Figuring at least he could get clean. He took his first steps into the shower with his new body gingerly. Wondering if showering might have some effect given he&#39;d done this to himself by some form of ointment... but if anything, the feeling was not what Josh was expecting.<br />
<br />
Stepping into the shower, Josh was treated to a feeling on his body like nothing he&#39;d ever felt before. His newly sensitive and effete form really came alive when he felt the hot water cascading down on him. A blush before long settled on to his face, and he choked down a groan to avoid having to answer for any weird noises should Eric halt his departure to ask. He almost quivered under the power of the water cascading down on him, every droplet seeming to entice his form into a new sexy feeling.<br />
<br />
It really did take everything Josh had not to let himself just moan and gasp - really luxuriate in the sensations afforded to his new body. In that moment, he almost didn&#39;t care that he was now something completely different from normal. He was feeling so good, he didn&#39;t want anything more than to escalate---<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Josh! I&#39;m heading out for work today! You good up there, buddy?&quot;<br />
<br />
Josh waited a moment, and then after a few seconds, Eric shouted, &quot;Must be having some fun in the showers. Whatever bro. Enjoy yourself~!&quot; And with that he heard the door swing open, and then shut as Eric headed out. The sound of a car in the distance before long started, and then Eric headed off. And that was all Josh needed to hear.<br />
<br />
He finally let a long, satisfied moan drift out of him - letting his long, gorgeous blond hair be soaked by the water. Josh&#39;s toned, muscular ass flexed as he twisted and turned his form in the shower, enjoying every instant of this. &quot;Ahh fuck yes...this feels so good...I mean, do I even wanna go back...? If it feels so good...?&quot; Well, he could make up his mind on that later. He didn&#39;t even know at this rate if this stuff was permanent or not...<br />
<br />
But the permanence of the ointment was far from Josh&#39;s greatest concern. Fueled by the flexion of his ass, and the feeling of his body under this lovely hot water, Josh registered that his cock was erect as could be. He licked his lips, and slowly reached down - but one hand was about all he could handle.<br />
<br />
The other gripping the side of the shower as he more focused on pleasure than cleanliness, Josh propped himself up as his hand pistoned up and down across his rigid cock. His eyes fluttered open and shut with the sheer pleasure he registered. As sensitive as the rest of his body was, his cock was on another level. Whole &#39;nother level entirely. The lack of hair impeding his sensation, and the lubrication of the water, if anything, made it even more shockingly good.<br />
<br />
Josh almost couldn&#39;t keep his hand there - the slippery water and the sheer sensation making him slip and lose his grip a few times. He grunted in sexual frustration as he shifted his position several times inside of the shower. &quot;Oof...fuck...woah...&quot; He murmured to himself, even his voice seeming lighter now that he really leaned into the changes that had happened. <br />
<br />
Despite what Josh the student may have thought before hand about guys like this, in as far as their preferences sexually, Josh was experiencing no such shift in sexual demands. If anything, his passion for the women he knew at college while he studied for that pilot position grew stronger, more intense. It seemed this pretty boy had a pretty strong libido, too. Pity he was shaping up to be kind of a quickshot.<br />
<br />
Josh tried his hardest - grit his teeth in defiance, thought of baseball, football, and soccer, pictured his own mother doing squats while dressed as a raccoon mascot - but no matter how unsexy he tried to think, no matter what he tried to do to distract himself, he could not handle the sheer sensations. His moaning escalated almost to a scream as he pressed his back up against the wall of the shower---<br />
<br />
The orgasm hit, and Josh almost whimpered from how intense it was. His cock shook in his grip, and before long a burst of healthy cum hit the door to the shower. And then another, weaker jet of cum, and Josh was left sitting there in the corner of the shower. Breathing quick and shallow breaths, his body still shaking from the intensity. He barely heard his phone - left in his pocket - ringing as he gathered his wits and reclaimed control of his body as the sheer intensity of his orgasm faded. His long blond hair - wet - clung to his forehead and obscured his vision.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck...that---that was something else,&quot; Josh breathed, thinking about how it might feel to use that nice, sensitive cock to fuck a woman. He&#39;d have to make sure he trained himself not to be such a quickshot, granted, but once he did...well. That promised a lot of enjoyment going forward.<br />
<br />
As Josh got up and got out, starting to dry himself off, he heard his phone beep again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh...&quot; He murmured to himself as he dried his hands and arms off, bending down after to pick up his phone. &quot;Oh!&quot; He saw a message on there from Lynnea - one of the girls from college. She was two years his senior, and she seemed both smart and very, very sexy. Just thinking of her made Josh almost feel like he could get ready for another round. He breathed - seeing that it was her asking him if he&#39;d be good for a date this weekend.<br />
<br />
Josh considered it - he knew that Lynnea had, for a while, liked him - but looking at himself now, he wondered if she&#39;d believe he&#39;d be capable of such a thorough body metamorphosis in such a short amount of time. He would have to convince her it was him. They&#39;d shared some notes and study tips at school, so that would have to work.<br />
<br />
There was also however the element of her older brother Jayden. <br />
<br />
Jayden was a tall, muscular football player - a regular college elite - and he was known for the twofold open secret of just how many steroids he consumed, to the extent his gut pushed out a bit like some of those bodybuilders in the early 2000s, and how he was very, very bitterly closeted. Jay would sleep with a different girl each week, but it was radiantly clear from the way he conducted himself around the locker room he was much more of an appreciator of male beauty.<br />
<br />
Yet he would it seemed rather die than ever come out and be himself. Merely voicing the idea he might be gay would induce Jayden to a violent fit...<br />
<br />
...And Jayden for whatever reason despised Josh, and tried to trail his sister if it looked like she and Josh might be having a romantic moment. When he&#39;d been normal, he hadn&#39;t been able to get it - but now that Josh was so transformed, he could definitely see that obsessive anger Jayden had growing even more intensive. And he was still nowhere close to understanding it.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know what, fuck Jayden - he&#39;s not the boss of me.&quot; Josh spoke to himself as he answered the text message; [Sure. I&#39;m down. What time and what place?]<br />
<br />
After a minute, Lynnea answered; [The campus coffee shop. Lets meet up there at the weekend. My brother has sports practice so we should be able to do so without interruption.]<br />
<br />
Well, that was agreeable - but that still left the issue of Jayden. He could still find out - and with how roided up he was, that could get really messy. One thing that his new body lacked that his old body had was the ability to at least physically handle himself a bit around Jayden. But now? Him being such a lightweight, there was the distinct chance that Jayden might be able to hurt him significantly if he didn&#39;t get away from the raging meathead...<br />
<br />
But this all gave Josh a new idea. He glanced toward the ointment laying on the counter. Just...resting there. Where it was. Somehow still near full. He knew from the days before when Jayden liked to workout, as both used the same gym, and he knew that that muscle beast liked to use quite a bit of product after he got his workout done during his shower. Including one kind of ointment for his body that looked a lot like Josh&#39;s new ointment. <br />
<br />
Maybe, if he could somehow replace Jayden&#39;s shower ointment with this Spring Beauty ointment...<br />
<br />
He might not be able to handle a full size Jayden. But a thinner, more effete Jayden? Now that was more in line with what he might be capable of. Fortuitously, tomorrow was Jayden&#39;s chest and shoulder day, a day when he&#39;d get really distracted working out and comparing his physique to other mens&#39; physiques at the gym. That was the best chance he had, while Jayden chatted away with the other muscle guys at the gym, to pull the switcheroo. <br />
<br />
&quot;The things I do for love...&quot; Josh contemplated as he prepped for his day. <br />
<br />
Tomorrow would be a big one, for sure, but there was still a lot to do today. He looked down at his old clothes - definitely not fitting who he was now. He needed some new clothes. And likely, some tighter and more flirtatious ones. If he was gonna be this testament to male beauty now, he wanted to show off the goods that he had.<br />
<br />
For now, Josh got dressed in a loose t-shirt and skinny jeans from his closet - clothes he usually didn&#39;t wear, but were now the closest thing to a fit on this new, tight and thin physique. What to do, what to do...?</p>
