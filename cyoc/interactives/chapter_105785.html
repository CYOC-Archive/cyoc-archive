<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I woke out of my comatose state and in flight noticed the countryside had changed greatly. It was warmer with more exotic tress, sunnier, and in the distance I could glimpse the sea. Those storks must be like jets... Then I remembered I was tied up in a bundle, on my way to a life and childhood I didn&#39;t want and that to all I was a baby. Being delivered by a stork. My only hope was to make my two new parents&#39; life impossible so that they would ask for a refund and send me back. I didn&#39;t want to think about them as my two new dads. Not yet. I was scared as I imagined reliving my babyhood and being aware of it. Perhaps I should wish to forget my former life as quickly as possible. Or if I was sent back my fate would be worse. I was about to cry at the tops of my lungs again to show the stork I was unhappy and annoy her but she suddenly dipped down. Oh, no. I did not want to arrive. Although I was bored, hungry and immobile. The stork landed right in front of a big house, with stairs leading to patio, two stories, a nice big garden, simple colors and tiles on the roof. The house looked exotic and worthy of southern countries. But to me it was the gates to hell. I tried to tell the bird to stop but only whimpers came out. At least as an oversized baby I could talk. &quot;Now, now, make a big smile and be ready to lift your arms to ask to be held. First impressions count, you know. Ah! Didn&#39;t even have to knock.&quot;<br />
 The stork was indeed about to use her leg to knock at the front door but screams and sounds erupted inside. The door banged open but from my position I couldn&#39;t see much except the ceiling of the patio and some flowers. Noises were heard and the stork talking in Spanish. So storks are multilingual, apparently. But she was crazy or high if she thought I was going to play the innocent sweet bundle of joy happy for any attention. Quite the opposite. I jumped at the sight of a huge head staring at me with a big smile. Of course, things were going to be towering, even the more everyday ones. The guy staring at me was definitely Latino and had short black hair with pretty big ears. Still smiling widely and cooing at me, he picked the basket I was in and spoke softly in Spanish. I regretted never paying attention in language classes then again, maybe I didn&#39;t want to hear his words of how cute I looked. Then he picked me up and still in my blue soft blanket was nestled in the crook of his arm. That was when I noticed how muscular he was. Perhaps it was better not to anger him and play the role I was relegated to. His shirt smelled of cleanliness and men perfume. But if he decided to spank me... No. No. I wasn&#39;t a kid and I was past being afraid of being grounded and spanked. And I wanted to show the stork that I didn&#39;t want to believe her cute discourse and that I pissed on her advice. And this man had done this to me! I shouldn&#39;t be frightened of him I should hate him! Oh... Oh, damn! Now that gay oaf had kissed me on the forehead! A huge kiss due to the size difference. I wanted to cry and bust his ears but crying would be infantile. So I just glared at him. It made him laugh. And the stork too. My insults came out only as baby goos and gaas with an angry tone to them. They laughed harder. I must have been ridiculous, like a little child wanting to command but I had the humiliation of being cute attached to it. I heard a new voice and another man came into view. Taller, stockier than the first but he made it up with even bigger muscles than his companion. He laughed at me too and also planted his lips on my forehead. My movements were too hampered by my age and blanket to even wipe it off. He also cooed at me and said &quot;Angel&quot; looking straight at me and repeating it like I was a dog. And then I understood. Those jerks had even chosen a new name for me. A stupid one at that. Of course I wouldn&#39;t be consulted. Now I was a little baby incapable of taking any decision. I cried more forcefully and even moving my limbs to show my disapproval, no matter how feeble and uncoordinated I looked. I screamed in anger, uncaring if I looked ridiculous or how fierce their appearance looked or if I would get spanked. They caused it, those jerks. Sure I wanted to be cute, but for girls, not two gays in need of something to cuddle and diaper. The three idiots laughed and the stork said something. The guy in whose arms I was started to unwrap my blanket and with his short nails tickled me. He tickled me on the ribs and my screams of anger were changed to those of laughter as my movements were now those due to the tickling. The bigger stork was right, I was so much more ticklish than before, with my new little young nerves adding to the intense sensation. I tried to sound angry but the tickling just made me sound like a happy baby. From my ribs he moved his hand to my tummy who quivered and got me even more laughing. I couldn&#39;t tell him to stop as the three&#39;s conversation continued. From wanting to be a brat I was now almost wanting to pretend to be a baby or to beg just to make it stop. In the end the hand stopped tickling and I was breathless and without any strength. The stork said bye and my hand was grabbed so it could pretend to wave bye-bye. I couldn&#39;t even sound angry as giggles still erupted from my mouth. I just looked like a sweet baby seeing someone off and being helped to be polite and adorable by his daddy. He even kissed my hand afterwards. He know knew he could tickle me into submission. Sounding pissed off would be brushed off as too cute or easily replaceable with a smile thanks to tickling. Looks like I&#39;d have to wait another 13 years to openly disagree or rebel about anything.  The stork left and with her my minuscule chance of escape. The man holding me smiled down at me, grabbed the basket and all three of us entered the house. I struggled to get out of my captor&#39;s arm but to no avail. At least the tickle torture didn&#39;t come. And I still had the blanket covering my privates. But very soon, baths, diapers and being seen naked would come. The door banging behind sounded like a sentence.</p>
