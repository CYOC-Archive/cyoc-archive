<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ryan wasted no time in ringing at Kat&#39;s door. Her parents were gone for now and as the house was empty, of course he rushed inside. Even though she proposed a drink or a snack, he wanted to go up to her room. Kat knew what he wanted. Sex, naturally, but also just a quick intercourse so he could relieve himself and proudly announce to his buddies that he had scored with another girl. He was the leader of his little group pf friends because he was the best football player out of all and because he was the most handsome. He attracted girl and then threw them aside like the dirty tissues he used to masturbate, without an afterthought. Any problems were glossed over by their coach or between each other. His list of privileges, all uncalled for, even made the other teachers angry. Ryan was hot, doubtlessly so, but he used his charisma only to lie and cheat his way through life. Well, Kat would change that once and for all. She had a plan that would give revenge to all the people he&#39;d harmed and bullied. Which made a lot of people, granted. Now, it was her turn to play with him. He had played with other people&#39;s lives enough. But first, she had to get him where she wanted, which turned out to be pathetically easy. They started kissing, Kat thanking him for making her feel &#39;like a woman&#39;. He smiled in a self-congratulatory way and continued straight towards her boobs, aiming for her bra and nipples below. He was groping her as if there was no tomorrow, and he was rough. <br />
&quot;Stop... Stop, you&#39;re hurting me,&quot; said Kat, which was the truth.<br />
He stopped and frowned. She had interrupted his play-time, which angered him.<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; he simply said.<br />
He again groped her and as he got more aroused, he squeezed her breasts and took no notice of her complaints of him being too rough. It was as if she hadn&#39;t said anything at all. She told him more and more that it was uncomfortable for her and that she wanted for it to stop but he continued, just grunting. Obviously he was ignoring her on purpose. In the en, she jumped off the bed and backed away from it and the jerk still there. He scowled at the interruption.<br />
&quot;I told you to stop. I don’t like it. You&#39;re too rough. Why didn&#39;t you stop?&quot;<br />
&quot;You&#39;ll like it in the end. All you bitches do,&quot; he said crassly.<br />
&quot;How can you know? Are you in my head? When it&#39;s &#39;no&#39;, it&#39;s &#39;no&#39;, you jerk. Apologize and get out,&quot; Kat said, pointing to the door.<br />
There it was. His last chance. But of course he didn&#39;t seize it. <br />
&quot;Come on, stop being a a bitch and let&#39;s continue. You&#39;ll like it.&quot;<br />
&quot;I told you, you&#39;re too rough and you weren&#39;t listening. I don&#39;t want to have sex with you. Leave.&quot;<br />
&quot;I didn&#39;t come here for nothing! Since you don&#39;t want to fuck with me, I&#39;ll just enjoy myself here. Then I&#39;ll go. Like that, my trip won’t have been a total waste. And if you come back here so we can fuck, I won&#39;t screw up your reputation regarding how we sent our night together. My buddies can also add their own details. It&#39;ll make your life at school a real fucking nightmare.&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh, threats, now? You should...&quot;<br />
Kat did not finish her sentence. That jerk had already started to masturbate upon her bed, grunting in exaggerated pleasure. <br />
&quot;You need to be taught a long-overdue lesson,&quot; she said and waved her hand as she uttered her spell. <br />
When she was done, Ryan was gone. Her clothes as well, transported away in the school gym. As he would never be found again, his clothes in the gym would show he had been there last. Instead, upon her bed, replacing the boorish young man, was a sex toy. A vibrating egg.<br />
<br />
For Ryan, it was the strangest sensation. One second, he was jacking off, teaching a stupid bitch her place and the next his entire world had changed. He could see and hear but the world was the same, except with gigantic proportions. And he couldn&#39;t move. Not at all. He could not move his legs, arms or head. What had happened? He shouted out, in a tiny new voice.<br />
&quot;Help! Kat! What happened here? Why can&#39;t I move?&quot;<br />
&quot;Simple, Ryan. You’re a vibrating egg now. You know, a sex toy.&quot;<br />
&quot;What? No!&quot;<br />
&quot;See for yourself,&quot; Kat smiled.<br />
She grabbed Ryan, now a sex toy, and carried him to the full-length mirror. Ryan felt himself being picked up and saw only a blur as Kat walked the few paces to the mirror and held him up. Indeed, as incredible as it seemed, she was holding a vibrating egg, light green, which from the perspective and obvious evidence, Ryan had to admit was his own very self. Kat said she was a witch and that he just received his comeuppance. Playfully and with a laugh, she showed the cable linked to Ryan&#39;s new &quot;behind&quot; and pressed the button, making him vibrate - literally. It was like he was shaking, racked by (appropriately speaking) shots of electricity. But with no pain. Kat pressed the button off, and then took a mischievous tone:<br />
&quot;Now what shall I do with you? Cut out your voice and then what? Give you to a hot promiscuous girl? I&#39;m sure you could offer her as much pleasure as you did when human. Or give you to a privileged brothel? I&#39;m sure you could meet beautiful women there. Until you broke and got thrown into the trash, of course.&quot;<br />
&quot;No! Please!&quot;<br />
Being thrust into hot girls didn&#39;t seem bad. It was the eventual breaking of his circuits and all the perks coming with humanity, like simply moving and speaking, that he would miss. He&#39;d enter their vaginas and then what? He would get awesome views, but he had no dick left to enjoy them!  <br />
&quot;Please! Change me back!&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh! I know!&quot; exclaimed Kat, ignoring him on purpose just as he had done not too long ago. &quot;I&#39;ll leave you at a place where homosexual men meet and gather! Guess where you&#39;ll be put then!&quot;<br />
&quot;No! Anything! Anything but that! I&#39;ll apologize! I&#39;ll be good! I swear!&quot; begged Ryan.<br />
That would be an absolute nightmare! The idea of guys kissing, making out and having sex, all for him to be thrust up their anuses... Disgusting! The mere idea was so revolting and horrifying to him he could not express his utter mortification at the thought. Kat just smiled a nasty grin. She wanted to frighten him to his core and it worked. She had other ideas in mind.<br />
&quot;Lucky for you, Ryan, I&#39;m not as cruel as you. I won&#39;t do that.&quot;<br />
Ryan&#39;s relief did not last long, though, unfortunately for him.<br />
&quot;But you&#39;ve been a jerk and you still need to be punished. So I&#39;ll transform you into a real egg. You&#39;ll lose all your memories soon and hopefully you&#39;ll be a better person, or creature, as you grow up again. Maybe if I make you a girl you can understand better how wrong you treated them.&quot;<br />
&quot;What? No! I... My pals have been jerks too? Why me?&quot; Ryan attempted, a last ditch attempt at saving his current pathetic life.<br />
&quot;You were the worst. But don&#39;t worry, they&#39;ll get what’s coming to them. Who knows? You might meet them in your new life,&quot; she smiled.<br />
Before Ryan could answer anything back, she kissed the vibrating egg good-bye and with another spell whisked it off to its new destination.<br />
<br />
Ryan could not see now, anymore than he could move. He was floating in a warm, thick liquid but he was still an embryo so immature that he couldn&#39;t move at all to see what he was and more importantly what gender he was. He couldn&#39;t talk. He swam in what looked felt like liquid flesh. He thought he could make out noises from the outside but it was too muted to reveal anything to him. He was scared. What was he? What would he be reborn as? Boy or girl? He prayed he&#39;d be a boy, ardently so. And then he felt his memories being erased, slowly at first then rapidly. No! No, no, no! He had to remember that he was a cool handsome guy! He had to remember he was a true guy! A virile guy! Because... Because... Because why again? Why was it important again? And what was a &#39;guy&#39;? Or &#39;football&#39;? What was his name? Who was he? He was... He was... He was tired, that was for sure. So naturally he drifted off to sleep. His body had a lot of developing to do before the hatching, after all.</p>
