<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">They had raided his shared apartment. Somehow he knew the FBI had him under surveillance. It was all those tours in the sandbox or Stan. He had well defined street skills. Tom had made it clear but they were following him on foot, what if they had a drone. He had the idol in the box, he ran to the rough part of toy and desperately reached for it.<br />
<br />
He pulled the ancient wood out of box and started throwing it from one hand to another. The wood seemed to warn and then grow hotter as Tom palmed it. He immediately felt it begin to tighten and send pulses of energy through his body. With a sudden yelp of pain, Tom shot downwards and to a new height of 5’6. His bones snapped and popped into place as his skeleton shifted, leaving him looking a bit feminine. <br />
<br />
Tom screamed as his bones continued to shift. His hips flared out while his shoulders caved slightly inwards, giving him a feminine hourglass figure. Tom looked at the idol as dark skin began to spread across his body, stemming from where the idol had touched his skin. The smooth, brown skin crept along his body, quickly covering his entire body as it grew silky and hairless. <br />
<br />
&quot;Stop right there!&quot; shouted a man in an FBI jacket.<br />
<br />
The Agent looked at his target&#39;s pants  began to rip and tear, revealing an expanding ass and thighs beneath. Tom’s ass kept growing, and by the time it finished its inflation he knew, for some reason, that it was<br />
bigger and more supple than any white girl’s ass could ever be. His jeans had been torn to shreds, and his ass had grown so large that it popped the button off the front and forced the zipper down past his crotch, revealing his shapely new behind to the Agent.<br />
<br />
“Sir, please, I just wanna go<br />
home…” Tom said with an alluring tone. The Agent was growing more disturbed by Tom’s new voice and tone, but nothing could prepare him for hearing his son moan in ecstasy as his crotch began to invert itself. Tom screamed in a smoky, sultry voice as unimaginable pleasures began to come from between his legs. He didn’t know what was going on down there, but it felt amazing. His stomach gurgled as his organs shifted around, leaving him with a female reproductive system and a hardened layer of abs to protect it. He felt his core muscles tense as he suddenly remembered a variety of sex moves and positions. While these new memories and thoughts disgusted him, he couldn’t help but moan as the new clit between his legs began to moisten. He rubbed a manicured hand over his crotch, reveling in the feelings his new sex was sending through his body while the Agent continued to watch in horror.<br />
<br />
&quot;Stay calm, we’ll figure this out…” the Agent said, struggling to think<br />
of who to call.<br />
<br />
“I’m trying…OW” Tom yelped as his skull began to crack and shift. The Agent watched his target’s face, the last<br />
physical remnant of the man he was chasing, transformed into that of an urban sex goddess. His<br />
lips grew red and plump while his eyes grew wide and layered with eyeshadow.<br />
Tom shook his head as flowing black locks tumbled down around his head and<br />
past his oversized man&#39;s shirt. He ran a hand through his silky new hair, admiring its<br />
texture and remembering how hard he worked in the mornings to get it just wavy enough. He suddenly let out another scream in pleasure as his chest began to expand. The Agent watched Tom’s chest as two dark nipples began to poke through the white material. They grew larger by the second, pushed forward by two<br />
breasts expanding on her chest.<br />
<br />
The pleasure was making Tom’s heart race, and soon he was covered in sweat. His skin took on a sexy sheen as the sunlight bounced off of it. He looked down at his new female body, still unsure of what he had become and continually trying to fight off the new urges leaking into his mind. He felt a little off balance with the new weight hanging off his chest, but with a final crack his spine caved in and gave him a sexual, feminine arch.  <br />
<br />
“What’s, ugh, what happened?<br />
Why do I look like…some hoe?” Tom said, surprising both the Agent and himself. His accent now sounded distinctly urban, but with a sultry and alluring flare.<br />
<br />
“I don’t know, but maybe we can go to, uh, the hospital. Maybe they’ll know what to do…”<br />
<br />
“Okay, s-shit!” Tom yelped as a belly button piercing materialized in his core. “No! Make it stop! I<br />
keep having these weird thoughts…I can’t fight them!”<br />
<br />
“Okay, okay, it’s gonna be fine…”<br />
he trailed off as he watched tattoos appearing on Tom’s body. Tom felt a tingle on his skin as ink appeared beneath the surface. A line of tattoos running down the side of his body began to appear, ending with a set of bird wings materializing on his ass. The tingling sensation caused him to remember getting those tattoos. He remembered the tattoo parlor on 7th street that she visited often. The artist there was super hot, and she specifically began to remember the way the tattoo artist grabbed and massaged her ass as she<br />
was getting that tattoo. No! This was all wrong! He didn’t know where 7th street was, he had never been to that part of the city! And he was a man, he had an ex-wife and a 4 and 2 year old, right? No, he remembered dropping out of school and working the streets. She was a…hooker?<br />
<br />
&quot;I’m remembering all these things…like dancing on poles…and hugging…no, fucking guys…and I give a mean blowjob…and…I remember that I’m a hooker?”<br />
<br />
The memories of working the streets and fucking countless men were taking over Tom. Her pussy began dripping as the memories of sex grew more vivid. She loved this city, because she could make it on the streets on his own. She made bank, and was even able to afford an apartment in the gentrified part of town. That’s how good he…no, she was at her job.<br />
<br />
In her oversized male clothes Odessa looked the Agent up and down.<br />
<br />
 “I don’t know what’s got you shook, honey, but if it makes you feel any better, I can call you daddy.” She planted a kiss on his cheek and traced his jawline with a manicured nail. “First time is free.”<br />
She beckoned him to a door in the alleyway, swaying her massive hips and ass with each sensual step. The man followed her, still pale and in shock, wondering if there was any way to get his son back. Odessa, seeing the raging boner pressing up against his pants, had other plans in mind.</p>
