<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The tears flowed freely down her nearly naked body as Dannie sobbed at her predicament. The poor girl had made the mistake of thinking her former best friend and now her boss wouldn’t take advantage of her once she had become this beautiful woman attired in nothing but a bikini and high heels and who’s main role was office work. The crying soon gave way to subtle sobbing as she regained more control over herself and began contemplating her next steps. Dannie knew that she needed to find a way to convince Pete to change her back to a man with the magic pen that he possessed but also knew that based on his earlier behavior that Pete was having too much fun and would not change her back willingly. Dannie also knew that her behavior and mind had already been changed in certain ways such as her sudden serving abilities coming into existence earlier and she could only contend that Pete with the pen had done this too her. With a whiff of fear seeping into her mind Dannie knew that Pete could change her completely at any moment or even her mind in anyway even wiping out her old memory as David if it suited his purpose. Dannie stopped sobbing immediately at this thought as it steeled her intentions to not let this happen.<br />
<br />
With a determined face Dannie knew what she needed to do. Picking herself off the floor in which she had been sitting she brushed off her bikini, grabbed her pocketbook that was sitting on the snack kitchenette counter, and headed to the small bathroom within the boardroom. Taking her pocketbook strap off her shoulder she thanked whatever possessed her original wish parameters to unintentionally make her an aqua-blue sequin pocketbook to go with her outfit for she needed what was inside at that moment. Looking in the mirror over the sink Dannie saw that indeed her hair was a mess and her makeup had been running with the tears. Taking out her makeup kit Dannie got to work reapplying her look from earlier and with the original magic having given her the knowledge she applied it again expertly even within the confines of the small bathroom space. Taking out her hairbrush Dannie combed her long hair with ease and brought it back to a proper and smooth lushness. Looking again in the mirror as she but her comb back in her pocketbook and slipped it back around her right shoulder Dannie was impressed with her work. Taking a deep breath Dannie closed her eyes forced a big happy smile upon her lips and then opened her eyes wide in a way to signify happiness and contentment. Opening the door Dannie happily walked out of the bathroom, followed by the boardroom, and then out onto the main office floor.<br />
<br />
Going to her desk right outside Mr. Simpson’s office Dannie gingerly sat back down and hungrily got to work on her scheduling for her boss. Always keeping busy with her work she also always had a smile on her face. Looking out from his office window Pete was surprised at the change in his secretary from earlier. Pete had felt bad at leaving her in the boardroom like she was but at the same time she nearly ruined his reputation to the board and she needed time to digest her new place and how she was going to accept it. Seemed like to him Danielle had accepted the fact that he was never going to change her back to his best friend David (which Pete intended to never allow to happen) and at that point she should just accept her place as a very attractive female secretary and also accept all the perks that came with that change “Heck if she keeps up this good attitude and acceptance I’ll give her free-range over her clothing options and she can wear whatever she wants” thought Pete. Dave’s fate was cruel Pete knew this but it would be even crueler to wipe her memory and replace it with a personality that always knew herself to have been a woman which Pete contemplated doing earlier. This option he had going now was the better of the two Danielle would always know who she once was but because she had given up the pen she wouldn’t been able to change back and would have to accept her new self eventually. Maybe someday she would come to love the changes. Pete was so attracted to Dannie and he wouldn’t deny that but he also had a wife Dave’s old love who he also loved and didn’t want to give up so why not keep one love at home and one at work it was a win-win.<br />
<br />
The day dragged on and soon it was evening. The office began to funnel out as people finished their work and left for the night. Dannie was also finishing her work and preparing to leave she thanked the lucky stars that the monotonous work was coming to an end and she could go home to her apartment, shower, and lay down. Dannie wasn’t surprised or fazed at this point how she knew where her apartment was located or that she didn’t have a modeling photo shoot scheduled for the night she just knew that the pen had set everything up and she shouldn’t panic about the alteration to reality.<br />
<br />
Dannie had turned off her computer monitor and put her pocketbook strap back around her shoulder as Pete opened his office door and walked out from the frame closing and locking his door behind him. “Great work today Dannie, your work is really shining” said to Dannie as he locked his door. With a beaming smiling Dannie looked up to his face and answered him gingerly “Thank you Mr. Simpson for supporting me.” Looking back to her Pete remembered something that he needed from her “oh Dannie I forgot can you print off a copy of my schedule tomorrow and leave it on your desk so I can pick it up tomorrow morning?” With a pleading face Pete asked this to an exhausted secretary who just wanted to go home but even though she was ticked off by this request Pete was still her boss and she still was under him. With a big smile Dannie accepted the request “of course Mr. Simpson I’ll get right on it.” Smiling too Pete thanked her for her patience as he made his way to the elevator and was soon out of sight. Being one of the last people in the office floor to leave wasn’t part of Dannie’s original plans but she had to finish her work and be a model employee if she was ever going to have a chance at changing back. Eventually she printed the schedule, placed it on her desk and left her station towards the elevator and eventually her destination the parking garage.<br />
<br />
Stepping out the the elevator doors in the second level of the parking garage was a completely new experience for Dannie not because she hadn’t done it before but because she had never navigated the garage at night as a women vulnerable, and dressed like eye-candy. Thankfully it was a warm summer night and lots of lights were on still the quick strut to her old Honda CRV was disconcerting to say the least. Right as she believed the beginning of the end to her horrible first day as a woman was coming to a close Dannie received the next gut-punch as she turned the car’s ignition and it refused to start. “oh come on baby not now” Dannie moaned as the engine refused to catch. Eventually she knew it was hopeless and stopped turning the key as she plunked her head down on the steering wheel and closed her eyes. Right out of the blue Dannie was shocked out of her stupor by the honk of a car horn which she whipped her head around to discern who’s it was. Looking out the window Dannie saw that Pete had stopped to see if she was alright in his Mercedes- Benz SUV. With hope still at hand Dannie got out of her car and made her way to the driver’s side window where her boss was waiting. “Need me to call a tow truck or give you a lift Dannie? I wouldn’t mind for either of them?” Still sore at Pete from earlier but not wanting to stay in the parking garage a second longer then she had to Dannie went over her options.</p>
