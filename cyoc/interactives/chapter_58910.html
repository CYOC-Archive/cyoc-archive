<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Brie's eyes lit up as she said, &quot;Become my sister.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why do you want me to become your sister?&quot; I asked looking at Brie in a confused <br />
manner.<br />
<br />
Brie shrugged and said, &quot;I'm an only child and I've wished that I had a younger sister. <br />
If the ring can really grant wishes that would be a great test.&quot; Her eyes took on a <br />
puppy dog look and she said, &quot;Please say you will wish to be my sister. It would make <br />
me very happy if it happens.&quot;<br />
<br />
I sighed and asked, &quot;How old do you want me to be?&quot; I just couldn't resist the look <br />
she gave me.<br />
<br />
Brie smiled and said, &quot;I think two years younger than me will be good. That will make <br />
you sixteen. I even have the way you should phrase the wish.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So how should I phrase the wish?&quot; I asked starting to wonder if this was such a good <br />
idea.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm glad you asked,&quot; Brie said her smile getting bigger. &quot;What you need to say is, 'I <br />
wish that I am sixteen year old Richelle&nbsp;Ainsworth younger sister of Brie&nbsp;Ainsworth.' <br />
This should be clear enough to where it won't be twisted and produce undesired <br />
results.&quot; I couldn't see any problem with it so I repeated it just as she said. Once I had <br />
finished her smile turned into a wicked grin and I knew I had been tricked. I tried <br />
wishing for the last wish to be canceled but I couldn't get the words out. Brie leaned in <br />
close and said, &quot;You can't undo a wish until it's done and soon you won't want to undo <br />
it,&quot; as I felt my socks disappear and my shoes morph.<br />
<br />
I looked down to see that my feet had become smaller and I was now wearing sandals <br />
with my toenails painted a light pink. &quot;Why won't I want to undo it?&quot; I asked as the <br />
change started to move up my legs slimming them and making them hairless. My <br />
pants also started to shorten as the change moved up my legs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Because you won't remember making the wish or who you were before it,&quot; Brie said <br />
with a little giggle. &quot;You didn't think to wish for your mind to remain unchanged did <br />
you?&quot;<br />
<br />
I looked up as the change reached my knees and said, &quot;So that means...&quot; I looked <br />
back down as the change reached about mid-thigh and my pant legs that had been <br />
shrinking this whole time flared out and joined together forming the hem of a skirt or <br />
dress changing from blue to grey and from denim to what I thought was polyester.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Brie said with glee, &quot;you'll really be my sister. Reality won't change that much. <br />
Most of the world will go on as it always has. Oh a small part of you will remember but <br />
it will be insignificant.&quot; She looked down and said, &quot;Well it looks like your dick is about <br />
to disappear.&quot;<br />
<br />
I had looked up when she had said I would really be her sister and now I looked down <br />
to see the change had indeed reached my crotch. I couldn't see the change but I <br />
could feel it. My dick and balls moved down to between my legs where my dick started <br />
to get thinner and pull inside. My balls retracted up into my body and changed into <br />
what I guessed were ovaries. My empty ballsack shrank down pulling close to my <br />
body. The skin on either side stretched over what was left of my ballsack and dick. I <br />
felt two holes form under what were the outer lips of my new pussy and I knew they <br />
were my urinary tract and vagina. I felt my prostate change into my new womb and the <br />
old urinary tract close up. My ass gained a bit of fat and my hips widened while my <br />
briefs tightened changing into panties. I watched as the changes to my clothes <br />
continued with what had been my pants merging with my shirt so it would be a dress <br />
when it was done. My waist narrowed as my slight gut shrank down to a flat stomach. <br />
&quot;You tricked me,&quot; I accused as the color of the dress changed to black a little higher <br />
than my waist.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course I did,&quot; Brie said. &quot;I couldn't just let my ancestor's ring slip away.&quot;<br />
<br />
I looked up shocked as what was becoming my new dress changed color to an off <br />
white color just under where my bust would be coming in. &quot;You're kidding,&quot; I said <br />
hoping that she was.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh I'm serious,&quot; Brie said as my breasts started growing. &quot;I am a descendant of <br />
Mordoch as you will be.&quot; She pronounced the name with a k sound at the end.<br />
<br />
&quot;So are you evil?&quot; I asked as my breasts stopped growing and I felt a bra form.<br />
<br />
&quot;Evil is in the eye of the beholder,&quot; Brie said smiling as the neckline of my shirt <br />
lowered into a scoop neck. &quot;Is it evil to want to rule the world to make it better?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess not,&quot; I said as my shoulders narrowed and the change start down my arms <br />
with the sleeves remaining short but with banded cuffs like the neck. Wait a minute. <br />
How did I know that?<br />
<br />
&quot;That's what Mordoch wanted to do but people viewed him as evil and killed him,&quot; Brie <br />
said with a scowl on her face. I could understand how she felt. &quot;Looks like your <br />
physical transformation is almost finished,&quot; she said nodding to my arms.<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess,&quot; I said my voice sounding like a teen girl's. I looked at my arm and saw that it <br />
was slimmer. Now that I was paying attention I could feel my face changing as my <br />
hands became daintier and my nails grow a little longer and paint themselves the <br />
same light pink as my toenails. I felt my lips plump up just a bit and my cheek bones <br />
move higher. My nose narrowed just a bit and my face became more angular. I could <br />
feel my hair growing longer. A thought occurred to me and I asked looking up, &quot;You're <br />
not going to remember this are you?&quot; When I had looked up at Brie I noticed that I <br />
had to look up a bit more so I had obviously shrunk a bit. I had gone from a thirty-six <br />
year old man to a sixteen year old girl. At least in body but soon in mind too.<br />
<br />
&quot;A small part of me will remember like a small part of you will,&quot; Brie said with a smile. <br />
&quot;I think I know why you asked that. To answer your unasked question I don't know how <br />
it will affect your second wish. I do know that you'll still have the ring since you didn't <br />
die or wish it off. Now since your physical changes are done the mental changes <br />
should take place.&quot; Just as she said that a flood of memories washed over me <br />
drowning me in them. Memories of growing up as a girl, of learning magic which was <br />
my birthright, of attending meetings of our coven, of watching our enemies beheaded, <br />
of meeting the Hag of the Shadows and receiving the ring, of making a wish for the <br />
woman I was looking at to become naked, and of coming to the bookstore to wait for <br />
my older sister to get off work and buying a romance novel to read while I wait. I <br />
looked up as Brie asked in a whisper, &quot;You're sure that you have the ring?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I wouldn't lie to you about something as important as this,&quot; I hissed. &quot;Mom would <br />
ground me for life if I did.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Still we need to make sure,&quot; Brie said looking around. She smiled wickedly and I <br />
followed her gaze to find Melissa Thompson had just walked in. We both hated her <br />
since she had tried to steal our boyfriends from us recently. &quot;I have an idea on how to <br />
test the ring and humiliate her,&quot; Brie said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ooh tell me what it is,&quot; I said wriggling in my seat from the anticipation. Brie usually <br />
had such good ideas for getting even with people though she hadn't thought of one for <br />
Melissa until now.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well you know how she's always complaining about watching her niece because she <br />
has to touch her diaper,&quot; Brie said a grin spreading across her face. &quot;Well I thought <br />
you could wish for her to have to wear and use a diaper. Not only that but to also have <br />
the compulsion to have someone change her with no other mental changes. She <br />
would be humiliated since she doesn't like diapers and always has to do things <br />
herself.&quot;<br />
<br />
I grinned as the words for the wish started to form in my head. I would need to word it <br />
so I could be sure the right person would get hit with it instead of a random Melissa <br />
Thompson. I suppressed a giggle and said, &quot;I wish that the Melissa Thompson in this <br />
store needs to wear and use diapers while not being physically handicapped and that <br />
she has an irresistible compulsion to have other people change her with no other <br />
mental changes to her with this wish and no mental changes to myself and my sister <br />
Brie with this wish.&quot;<br />
<br />
Once I finished my wish Melissa's purse changed into a diaper bag and she colored <br />
up. &quot;It looks like it worked,&quot; Brie whispered as Melissa came over to us.<br />
<br />
&quot;Um... Brie,&quot; Melissa said looking down once she was in front of us. &quot;Um... do you <br />
think you could um... well I was wondering um... could you please um... please change <br />
my diaper?&quot; Her voice was so quiet at the end that we barely heard her and she <br />
blushed even more.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course I'll change your diaper Melissa,&quot; Brie said loudly and Melissa turned bright <br />
red looking like she wanted to just die. &quot;Come to the restroom and I'll change you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I have to use the restroom myself,&quot; I said marking my place in my book. I had to pee <br />
and I needed to change my tampon. I let Brie and Melissa get ahead of me so I could <br />
make a wish without Melissa hearing me. I had seen a problem so I said, &quot;I wish that <br />
the Melissa Thompson in this store will never think about or actually kill herself and will <br />
never think about or ask someone to kill her.&quot; Well I wanted her to be embarrassed <br />
and death would be a release from that. Melissa and Brie went into the restroom just <br />
seconds after I finished my wish and I was a few seconds behind them.<br />
<br />
Melissa was already laying on the floor with her dress up exposing her diaper. Brie <br />
opened it and said, &quot;Whoa that stinks,&quot; upon which Melissa turned even redder than <br />
before which I didn't think was possible.<br />
<br />
I stepped around them and looked to see if any of the stalls were empty. Fortunately <br />
the were and I was glad there wasn't a line here. Once I had finished up in the stall I <br />
was washing my hands while Brie was telling me how Melissa had rushed out of here <br />
with tears in her eyes. I laughed and said, &quot;Oh that must have been a sight to see.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Brie said laughing. &quot;I just hope she doesn't kill herself to escape her <br />
punishment.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh I already took care of that,&quot; I said with a big grin plastered on my face. &quot;She can't <br />
even think of killing herself or asking someone to kill her.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why Richelle you little witch,&quot; Brie said with a smile. &quot;You can be so cruel at times.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just like my big sis,&quot; I said smiling at Brie. I turned back to the mirror and the smile <br />
fell from my face. Something didn't look right. I leaned forward to check my make-up <br />
but that didn't need to be touched up. I looked at my gray eyes but I couldn't see <br />
anything wrong with them. There was nothing wrong with my light brown hair either. <br />
Everything was just as I had seen it in the mirror this morning.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you ok?&quot; Brie asked concerned.<br />
<br />
&quot;I just thought I saw something wrong in my reflection,&quot; I said shaking my head a bit.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well it was probably because you weren't paying too much attention when you turned <br />
back to the mirror,&quot; Brie said shrugging. &quot;That happens to me sometimes. It's nothing <br />
to worry about.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You're right,&quot; I said dismissing the thought. &quot;We better get going. If we miss the start <br />
of the meeting Mom will kill us.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then I guess we had better not miss the start,&quot; Brie said as we exited the restroom.</p>
