<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Erica found herself dazed on the sofa as she found herself slumped on the sofa while TV had been turned off automaticly. She was exhausted and felt drowsy. She took notice of the clearly small T-shirt and top that was right next to her. Then as she rose up and started to wander the house she felt that something was off.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh right, the coin.&quot; Erica said out loud and started to look for it between the cushions. After a couple of curse words and blind reaching she got her hands on the coin and salvaged it to her cheeto dusted palm. She smacked her lips and took a good look of her body.<br />
<br />
&quot;How come others have had sex, but I&#39;m still a virgin. Like my body is still something men would drool for but no. No men in my life.&quot; Erica said while checking her massive breasts. &quot;Like how men can ignore these babies... babies?&quot;<br />
<br />
Suddenly Erica realized that she had lost the track of time and rushed to see if the babies were alright. No sound came from the nursery room which was good or a bad sign. She made a audible gulp as she quietly peered from the door finding that all three were sleeping.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank heavens that they are just sleeping. I couldn&#39;t have imagined what would have happened if someone would found me topless in the middle of living room.&quot; Erica sighed and closed the door.<br />
<br />
As she walked back to the living room in front of the sofa Erica tried to put back on the tiny clothes she had removed half an hour ago. Thinking that it was strange that her top was as tight as it was. She then went to search if the household&#39;s motherly figure had something to wear. A piece of clothing they wouldn&#39;t miss or notice if she borrowed it for these evening.<br />
<br />
Erica approached the Mr. and Mrs. Johnson&#39;s bedroom. Only having panties on her she tried her best to find something, but only find clothes that weren&#39;t good enough. The Smith family was pretty skinny while Erica had some mass. Then the front door started to open which sent Erica into panic mode. She jumped into the closet and took the first shirt what she could find and tried to put it on.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wish for my dear life that this is a perfect fit for me.&quot; Erica said while dropping the coin making it land on it&#39;s heads. As she noticed it once again dropping to the floor she picked the coin back to her palm and run outside with the nightshirt she had taken. <br />
<br />
In the front door as Mr. and Mrs. Johnson walked inside Anna begun to feel the changes as her whole clothesline started to gain more sizes. Anna Johnson&#39;s body expanded light a dough as she and her husband Ricky saw the teenager&#39;s shirt laying on the sofa cushion. Anna&#39;s body had already given birth to a triple children so she had her child bearing wide hips, mature top and bottom. The coin started to turn her curvy figure into a voluptuous. First her breasts gained five cup sizes more popping the clips behind her bar. The lactating breasts started to leak making two dampy patches on the dress she wore. The two melons grew bigger than her head and started to push themselves out of her cleavage making it overflow.<br />
<br />
Anna made small moan as the sensitive in her chest was increasing rapidly as the nipple were becoming as big as tip of her thumbs and areolas were size of drink coasters. Her ass got similar treament but as she was pear shaped the two cheeks took twice as many seats ripping the dress&#39;s thigh parts as her whole bottom was now massive.<br />
<br />
Ricky in front Anna who was the embodiment of the alpha male begun to change as well as his body lost a lot of mass. Turning Ricky more pretty twink and girly as she walked towards the sofa.<br />
<br />
&quot;Did Miss Erica invite her niece here?&quot; Ricky asked with a feminine tone as he inspected the shirt.<br />
<br />
Anna started to become to transform into the &#39;man&#39; of the household and took more promiscuous and confident pose as she viewed Ricky good husband but as better fuck buddy. As Ricky turned she was already head shorter than her 5&#39;8 tall wife. Anna&#39;s brain chemistry had changed so much that she was the one who initiated their relationship. Ricky walked right next to Anna as if she was her lap dog who begged for scratches and huggies.<br />
<br />
&quot;So Ricky boy, do you think Erica had little fun, humm?&quot; Anna confidently asked as she was head patting her husband. She had noticed the empty bowl and the beer cans on the floor. Ricky didn&#39;t answer since Anna wasn&#39;t expecting for one. To her this was open and shut case where their supposed babysitter had forgotten the important part of babysitting and reaped the benefits of their hospitality.<br />
<br />
&quot;Anna! If you are still here I would like to ask why there&#39;s a miniature frat party&#39;s after party in our living room? Care to come and explain yourself?&quot; Anna shouted with very frustrated tone in her voice.<br />
<br />
Erica stopped immediatly as she heard the question and stuck behind a corner to think if she should tell the truth or make an excuse. Erica&#39;s whole body was trembling since Anna looked much more imposing than she was. Erica then looked at the coin which was shaking in her hand, made a small pray and flipped it to make a decision the for her.<br />
<br />
&quot;I just wish I could tell you the truth Anna&quot;, Erica whispered as she catched to coin on her palm and saw ...</p>
