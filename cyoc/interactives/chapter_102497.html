<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Chad&#39;s cock goes limp.  He sighed, he guessed that he got worked up over nothing.  He toweled off, dressed and went home.  The next week seemed to go by normally.  His teammates - now blonder and with body parts that look uncannily like his own- acted normally, and didn&#39;t mention using him at all.  Did they even remember or realize how they used to look?  Finally,  he pulled Rick aside and demanded to know what was going on.<br />
<br />
&quot;Relax, Chad, it all happened.  But your teammates have moved on, and so should you.  Why don&#39;t you go home and take a nice steaming hot bath, Chad?  That hot water will melt your securities away,&quot; Rick said.<br />
<br />
Chad didn&#39;t know what to say.  He felt strangely compelled to obey.  School was over.  He had showered after practice, but he&#39;d worked himself up into a panic sweat before he confronted Rick.  He did need a bath. Maybe a hot soak would help.<br />
<br />
He went home, and filled the bath tub with hot water.  He had use the guest bathroom, because his bathroom only had a shower. He locked the door from the hallway, but didn&#39;t bother with the door to the guest room, since as far as he knew the room was empty.  He stripped down, and stepped into the hot water.  He pulled his foot back, it was so hot. Then he gently lowered it.  He trembled as his body got used to the heat, and slowly he sat down. <br />
<br />
&quot;Aaaaaah!&quot;  he sank down to his shoulders.  His knees popped out of the water covered with suds.  He stared for a moment, he was confused.  He hadn&#39;t put any bubble bath in the water.  Where was all the sudsy bubbles coming from?  He lifted his left leg.  His knee pulled back. Bubbles wafted in the air.  His calf was gone - fuck his whole lower leg and melted into bubbles.  He sat up abruptly.  Stubs hung from his shoulders.  The tub was filling with foam.  He was melting- he was dissolving like one of those bath bombs.  He tried to stand, but he was only moving on his effervescent butt cheeks.  His knees and thighs were gone.  He put his stubs on the edge of the tub and tried to lift himself out before he dissolved completely, but his soapy stubs slipped and his torso and head fell back in the water.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m melting!&quot; he screamed before disappearing in the rising suds.<br />
<br />
&quot;What a world, what a world!&quot; said Rick entering from the guest room, &quot;Why, Chad, or should I say Mr. Bubble, you look positively inviting.  I cannot wait to soak in your entire essence,&quot; he added, as he took off his terry cloth robe.  He was naked underneath.  &quot;See, I need to start a new life.  The witch hunters were closing in on me, and I figured if I had to start a new life, I couldn&#39;t do better in this town than yours.  Now that body spray thing was fun, but it was just a prank.  The reason I waited a couple weeks to do this was I had to give that peace offering candy I gave you time to properly cleanse that magic out of your system. So this new spell could be implemented without any side effects.&quot;<br />
<br />
He stepped into the bubbles and slowly sank into Chad.  He inhaled the sweet smell of Chad, as he felt Chad seeping into his very pores.  Rick took a breath and sank his head beneath the bubbly water.  He waited about a minute, then surfaced.  But it wasn&#39;t Rick who surfaced.  It was Chad.  He climbed out of the tub.  Toweled off.  Then examined himself in the mirror.<br />
<br />
&quot;Perfect!  I&#39;m Chad, and no one will ever guess I was ever Rick,&quot; he whispered to the mirror.  Then he put on his robe, unlocked the hall door, and plodded down to his new room in Chad&#39;s slippers, which now fit him perfectly.   Transformation is an exhausting process, and Rick was asleep in Chad&#39;s bed moments after lying down.  He didn&#39;t hear Chad&#39;s brother come home, or hear him enter the hall bathroom.<br />
<br />
&quot;Doofus, you left the light on.  Warm bubble bath?&quot;  He could hear the new Chad snoring. &quot;It&#39;s been years since I had a bubble bath, it would be terrible to waste it.&quot;  So he undressed and climbed into the sudsy bath, unknowingly bathing in his own bubbled brother, and transforming into a Chad clone. He sank down in the water and submerged completely as he scrubbed the suds into his brown hair. About five minutes later he emerged dripping and toweled off.  He stared at his pubes and cock, which looked blonder and bigger. He dashed to the mirror and his naked brother stared back at him.  He grabbed his cell phone and called his buddies to come over immediately.<br />
<br />
At first they didn&#39;t believe him, but he managed to get each of them to take a dip in the now cold bubble bath.  By the time Rick woke in the morning, he had ten identical twin brothers.</p>
