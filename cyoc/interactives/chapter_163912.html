<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Tom decided to go to the local mall and try his luck there as the shopping center had a variety of people to choose from. With his destination set, Tom hurriedly drove to the mall. At the mall, Tom kept his eyes open for a potential victim. With so many people around, Tom wouldn&#39;t have to worry about picking the wrong man. <br />
<br />
After walking through various stores and looking for a donor, Tom thought he would try exploring the restrooms for a guy that could contribute to his fantasy. Tom quickly headed for the nearest restroom and waited at the stall next to the urinals. He had not tried it before, but now seemed like the perfect time to cut out a hole into the side of the stall. Thankfully, Tom had remembered to bring his pocket knife, just in case. Rather than using the opening as a glory hole, it would serve as a way for Tom to get a decent view of the dick that he would steal. <br />
<br />
Various men came and went. Males of different heights, ages and body types. Eventually, Tom spotted what he was looking for. A man had dashed towards the stall furthest from the entrance and Tom could see reason. Although it was true that the guy had an urgency to use the lavatory, Tom had an idea why the man had picked the last stall. The man&#39;s name was Tony and though he was handsome and in his early thirties he had a problem that he did not want others to see. Whether it was genetics, a lack of testosterone or some other misfortune did not make a difference. Tony clearly suffered from a micropenis. It was 1.5 maybe 2 inches soft on a good day and source of misery for the man. No amount of time, counseling, or hormone therapy had made a difference in the size or how he felt about his member. He had deliberately chosen the last bathroom stall to avoid anyone getting a good look at his junk. Tony believed that he was almost a complete person. That it was just his cock that was dragging him down. He even refused to get into any relationship in fear that his partner would gawk at his member. He had thought that this was how his life would always be. What Tony didn&#39;t realize though was that today his luck would change, unaware that Tom was eying his dick.<br />
<br />
Just as Tony was about to urinate, Tom held the held the remote and pointed it at Tony&#39;s dick and clicked the swap button. Instantly, the two men&#39;s cock&#39;s were traded with one another. Tony was now the owner of a manhood the size of a water bottle while Tom now had his desired micropenis. This event caught Tony&#39;s attention relatively quickly. He had felt a tingling sensation in his bladder and genitals and looked down to see what had occurred. Greeting him was his new manhood, one that was much larger than his old one. Tony had to do a double take before he could accept what he was seeing. This new penis gave rise to a mix of emotions. For one, Tony no longer considered himself as an imperfect existence. He was now a whole being. He was complete. Tony did not even care that his urge to urinate was gone. He simply jumped up in the air, zipped his pants, admired his new bulge and promptly headed home to test out his new phallus.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Tom was still in the restroom, having waited for Tony to leave before trying anything. Once Tony was gone, Tom checked out his new pecker. He touched it and examined it on all sides. It was finally the right size for Tom&#39;s fantasy. It was small, stubby and clearly wouldn&#39;t get too much bigger, even when erect. What Tom noticed though was that he had also switched bladders with the man when he had swapped their genitals. It was now Tom that needed to take a leak. This was in fact a great time to test out his new shaft for his fantasy. <br />
Tom hastily pulled up his underwear and pants without using the toilet. Gone was the bulge that had shone from his pants. Now there was barely any shape in view. Once he was done dressing, Tom headed home, having accomplished his mission of exchanging his huge junk for a tiny one.</p>
