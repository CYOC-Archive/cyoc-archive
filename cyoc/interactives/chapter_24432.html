<br />
Jeff looked at the screen infront of him. He sighed and rolled the chair back a bit, trying to find something around him that might give him some inspiriation. He furrowed his brow and began spinning around the chair while busily looking through things.<br />
<br />
Although, he had just recently cleaned his room, so everything was pretty much tucked away inside drawers and shelves, he actually found something that he got a pretty good reminder from...<br />
<br />
On the top of the shelf, framed and with a golden border there was a picture of him at his grandads farm and feeding a bull through an electric fence. Humoursly enough the picture was taken the exact moment when he gotten himself a pretty bad sting from the fence, hence creating a really weird picture. Although the little incident, he really enjoyed feeding the cattles, cows and this one occasion the bull, and now on later years when he had picked up roleplaying he rather quickly snapped up the minotaur as a character once he heard about the racial traits. He grunted with content and heaved himself back to the desk and began typing frenetically at the keyboard. <br />

He clicked the &quot;Submit and save changes&quot;, and a progress bar appeared ontop of the options, showing with a small portrait his own body and what looked like his groin. Jeff looked at screen with a puzzled stare. The small &quot;avatar&quot; picture was actually screening his own groin as he would have been naked! Jeff shrugged but couldn't help but to  feel a bit embarrased. His mind got back on track quickly though, and as he looked at his legs to see some changes, he suddenly saw how his groin on the screen began to bulge a bit, and his pubic hair thickened. All the while he felt a rising, pleasant heat all over his groin. The progress bar had gone on for 30 seconds now, and he saw how his hair just thickened and thickened. Jeff smiled with utter content and shoved his chair away again, rising up quickly and dropped his pants. What he saw except, well his own body, was that his penis had thickened considerably and that he had acquired a really nice trail of hair all over his abdomen. He took his hands and brushed the thick hair, he looked like a ordinary but overly haired person now and he was amazed how it felt. He ignored the trickling feeling around his abdomenen, and looked past his increasingly growing penis in girth, and saw his feet expand along with his thighs. Hair started growing all over his legs, growing with increasing thickness from his groin and growing to be a really nice and shaggy pelt what he could say, and began to tuft a bit at the insides of his thighs. The hair was brown, thick and soft, and smelled just like he had remembered that the old bull at granddad's farm used to smell like. Jeff stroke his penis quickly to get a grip of how it had grown, and he was positively surprised to say the least. Suddenly his toes stopped responding, and Jeff looked down to see his feet harden, the skin rupture beneath to show shiny black hooves beneath. His whole lower region looked very much like a bulls, except his penis hadn't been encased in a groin and he could still hold his balance in some way. Jeff stroke his abdomen, the crossway from man to bull.<br />
<br />
He trotted around with his hooves, the hocks growing eagerly and he finally felt a long ropy tail emerge from his back. He swished it slowly as he gained more and more control over it as it grew slowly longer and longer. Much to his surprise, it seemed as if his testosterone leves had rised, he felt energized and pumped, but not only that had happened, his chest was covered with the beginning of chest hair and his arms and face itched. <br />
<br />
Jeff was amazed at his new growth, and almost wondered if he hadn't changed more to a minotaur after all... he would have fallen down on the floor to look at the whole change realistically and what he had expected, but now he had gained even some bulk and a more suitable posture to stand upright. Jeff stroke his groin and thought that those measly 90% must have kept his penis human. <br />
<br />
As he trotted around the floor and stroke himself all over to extend his euphoria, he realized that he had ticked the &quot;Alter reality&quot; option, and he snickered to himself. He approached the door slowly, and accidentally knocked the bottom part of the door with his heavy hooves so the door cracked. Jeff sighed, and opened the door quickly. Just outside sat his mom who was just done with the vacuum cleaner and shoved it away, she took one glance at Jeff and smiled.<br />
<br />
&quot;My have you grown! I can even see you're starting to grow some chest hair dear,&quot; she walked close to the paralyzed Jeff and pinched him in the cheek. &quot;Some stubble aswell... I think your dad might be able to pull himself together and buy you a razor, I'm gonna call him quickly. And don't hesitate to bring out the garbage while I do that Jeff.&quot; She snickered at him and took one more glance at Jeff and eyed him up and down. &quot;Just like your father.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff was very disoriented, and sat down on the floor, making a deep scorch in the floor as he did so. <br />
<br />
&quot;What the heck?&quot; said Jeff.<br />
<br />
He absently scratched his chest, which had begun to show increasing thickness in hair, and his whole upperbody had seemed to swollen very slowly. His arms had begun to bulge, and dark hair was growing all over them. <br />
<br />
What happens next? (Duh?)</p>
