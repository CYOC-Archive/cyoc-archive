<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">A week later Becky had her appointment at the transformation center. The night before, her family and friends had given her a great farewell party. All had been pig themed, including a lot of pink decoration and cute pig faces. But still there had been an air of unease as nobody knew exactly what happened in the transformation program. According to official propaganda it was all half as bad. It was all basically fun. Tranformation meant just a lazy and comfortable life as animals, eating, sleeping and some sex in between. Many people, especially those not personally affected by the program were keen to believe this was the full truth. And indeed, there were farms open for visits where everybody could find the official version confirmed. But then there were other reports. Some stray groups of human rights campaigners pretended this was all facade. According to their claims the vast majority of tranformeds ended up in factory farming operations. Every know and then video footage turned up, showing animals in narrow pens, no sunlight let in, munching listlessly on slimy feed. And then there were even worse reports. They claimed that even the red line - that no transformed person was to be killed - had long since been crossed. It was claimed that almost all tranformeds ended up being sluaghtered. Some directly others once their fertility had withered and they had lost their value as breeders. The government obviously prosecuted such reports. In every case, speakers for the program eagerly explained that the footage and reports were obviously faked and explained away any piece of evidence presented by the activists. Nonetheless, the rumours were sufficient for Becky to be nervous when she entered the great grey building she had been summoned to. <br />
<br />
Becky approached the receptioon. An older friendly nurse welcomed here and upon examination of her invitation letter sent her over to a room down a corridor. Here a young nurse received here: &quot;Welcome. This is the ante-room. The doctor will shortly be with you to administer the transformation liquid. But before this, would you please undress?&quot; &quot;Do ... do I not get any sort of information or something?&quot; Becky was flabberghastered by the lack of interest in her and this hurried process. &quot;Sorry, I am afraid this is not foreseen here.&quot;, answered the nurse. &quot;But don&#39;t worry. Once you have been transformed you will receive some more information. it has proven to be easier then because you will already be in your new form and can thus easier understand what people are talking about.&quot; And you will have lost any chance of escape, added the nurse in quiet. Becky, however, could see that there was truth in her answer and hesitantly undressed. Just when she was done, a young female doctor walked in. &quot;Hello my dear. Now comes the great moment. The serum will come as a single shot into your buttocks. So please lie down on the stretcher here. Becky obeyed. She was so nervous, she could not utter a single word, let alone think of any resistance. Then she felt a sharp pain as the needle hit her butt and immediately it began. She felt her face change. Her mouth and nose fused into a snout, stretching out, in the process shifting her eyesight so that her field of vision broadened, though at the price of much of her three dimensional view of the world. Her ears moved up and became pointy while she felt her hairs recede and bristles sprout all over her body. Her once smooth skin suddenly felt coarser. Then the changes became even more drastic. Her body stretched while her legs and arms shortened into stubby pig legs, with her joints turning and twisting to allow for quadrupedal motion. Only in passing she felt her tits recede while new rows of teats appeared on her belly. Soon the changes reached her private parts. Her pussy and butthole moved up and changed into a pig form while a little tail pushed out - a very odd feeling. Finally, she felt her inner organs readjust, releasing a loud fart in the process. Then it was over. The doctor smiled at her: &quot;Congratulations. The process is successfully concluded. Now our experts will take over and introduce you to your new life.&quot; With that she left and the nurse pressed a button. Soon a man in a farm overall came in. He greeted the nurse, looking at Becky he said: &quot;Hello there. You&#39;re a fine little piggy. Now please follow me to what we call the reception course. It will explain to you what life as a pig involves and how things will move ahead for you.&quot; Becky hesitantly tried to stand on all legs and made a few hesitant steps. &quot;Very good. That&#39;s the way.&quot;, said the man encouragingly. Becky was anxious to see what was up, so she followed the man, but she was still frightened. At the same time a feeling of embarassment crept into her head. Here she was. No longer a cute girl but a naked plump animal, waddling away, presenting her butt and pussy to all the world. What would her friends say if they could see her now. Then they reached a door ...</p>
