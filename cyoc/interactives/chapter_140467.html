<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Staring at the website, he decided to wait just a bit to wrestle with his inner demons. Eventually finished with his role as &quot;the Canyons of Giant Land. He and the Director had an enlightening conversation as the Director inventive as always asked about plans to do a Space Opera using a camera fed attached to his pecs for a closeup of the auroras. Ben quickly satisfied the director&#39;s interest before returning to a state where he asked the director what kind of Space Opera he had in mind. The Director unsure about the question stated he would love a Star Trek-esque galactic discovery of land in space. Ben laughed saying that it was alright for the Director to film what he had in mind for the movie on him. Stating at this point his body is public property. The director laughed couldn&#39;t agree more with what you said. Despite how big he has gotten he always had a soft spot for the director always inspiring crazy movie plots that gave him ideas to literally grow into. Distantly reminiscing about his time in the studio as the tower 27-foot studio beast. Eventually Ben dismissed the Director as he turned on the Transformation.net page inputting his usual commands. Closing his eyes and embracing the man he has become. Standing up he spread himself out as much as he can to allow the growth as much room to expand. he felt the light showering of meteors colliding with his chest as they continued as pebbles on his man slabs. Deep into the night, he opens his eyes to watch the world around him slowly recede away. Feeling the mass of muscle beginning to compete with his frame he tried to force his body wider to compensate with the tons of mass added to his body. Flexing and forcefully extending himself out he felt a great sense of accomplishment of what he became. flexing his biceps forcing them to grow more round and bulbous. pushing his chest out more so he could flare his back out. He felt Everywhere and anywhere at the same time. Eventually, his swollen arms barely touched the top of his pecs. Feeling his arms failing to reach around his rack was incredible. Causing his chest to heave out, even more, causing his arms to no longer reach around any part of his chest. But he wasn&#39;t stupid he flexed his arms larger. Forcing them to get pulled upwards with his traps. his traps alone added 2 miles on his total height do to that ridge is so high relative to his neck. Feeling the swelling mass before him he crunched his abs So they swole bigger and grew in number. 360 packs he felt like an endless washboard everytime he felt himself. Transfixed by his expanding body. Ben continued to do a stunning gun show. Causing his body to lurch in every direction. New Giant muscles forming to conform with the ever-increasing frame each flex caused. Unable to fully process anything the musclebound freak tried to force a single flex from every muscle he can still feel.<br />
His back stretching wider and wider. I was until he was unable to reach he was unable to lock arms underneath his chest that he struggled to continue flexing. As his flexing began to get interrupted his head forced inside a muscle prison of his chest and swollen traps and neck muscle suddenly came back into focus. seeing between his bulbous pecs He can feel the mass around of him ebb and flow flexing despite no longer doing some average flex routine. finding his computer close by entered the ending commands that stopped his growth. His body to shake expanding still for what can be only miles more. He was excited to see exactly how big he had become. Trying to move his arms he tried to force his pecs a little down so he can see beyond them. However, his pecs didn&#39;t budge in fact his whole body barely flinched. Forcing his arms to stop doing a superman pose proved difficult. He tried to have the arms settle back around the sides of his body. However, the feeling of his lats never came to his hands. Trying to suck his chest in a little proved futile as it only heaved further out. Trying a different method Ben tried to move his arms to touch his biceps he can do a deltoid flex.  this was to gauge his arms mobility. He got his answer almost immediately as his arms struggled to even reach over his engorged biceps. Of course, doing so cause his arms to sit in an even more awkward position as it became harder to bend his arms. He flexed his neck instead forcing his neck to outgrow its prison. it started to work. He could feel his neck rising. He watched as around him his giant neck muscle began to squeeze more room around it for it to expand. Looking down at his monitoring station he forced his pecs to bounce causing his monitoring station to land perfectly on a ridge of his neck giving him a better view of the situation with his body. Craning his neck up he could see his traps above him. Looking to the left and right he saw more of his neck traps his pecs and his swollen biceps. and in front of him was obviously his pecs. now less in the way of the world around him. Ben looked around darkness all around him. <br />
Bending down a bit he could see the streaks of meteors below. Repositioning himself he could see the surface still as puny as ever. He looked up and back to Transformation.net. clicking the continuation. He continued to flex and expand. Each aspect of his body growing increasingly larger. Trying to place his hands on his hips was barely achieved but doing so enabled his arms to elongate. giving him needed breathing space as more muscle continued to stretch every part of him to the max. Eventually after another trance, Ben tried to do another hand on hip pose. unable to strike that he resorted to doing some iconic Arnold poses. Every Part of his body groans as he hit each pose causing his body to rupture with even more growth. He placed the command to stop growth right there knowing full well the rest of his body was gonna take a while to catch up. Eventually, he felt the energy dissipate, again observing his surrounding his final results read: 250 miles (73,598,976,000,000 tons)</p>
