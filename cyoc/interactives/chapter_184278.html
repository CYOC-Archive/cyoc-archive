<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ty lay there amongst the roots of the willow tree, his breath quick and panicked as his mind began to match his body, he was all alone, hungry and cold and now no way to fend for himself, then a droplet of water splashed against his nose, then another, then the mighty crash of thunder echoed through the trees, and rain began to pour through the gaps in the roots, drenching Ty&#39;s face, so he did what felt most natural, he cried, as loudly as he could, his mind now so reduced in age that he didn&#39;t even consider the idea of predators.<br />
<br />
The rain obscured Ty&#39;s vision of the grey sky above, but it did not reduce his hearing, as the sound of tree limbs braking below a creatures feet aproched, Ty held his breath, paralysed by fear, things were truly not going his way today.<br />
<br />
But then a voice could be herd drawing near, so Ty did the only thing he could think to do, with a lung full of air he let out the loudest high pitch wail he could muster, with his throat going horse from effort, but he had no choice but to cry so whoever was coming could hear him over the wind and rain.<br />
<br />
&quot;Who&#39;s there, hello? Does someone have a baby near by?&quot; Came a voice, so Ty took another deep breath and let out another cry, tears now streaming down his cheeks from the pain it caused him, bit his efforts were rewarded when a pair of silk smooth hands moved the roots aside to pick him up.<br />
<br />
The first thing Ty noticed was her hair, crimson red, and unnaturally long, reaching all the way down to the backs of her heals, her skin was a light tan, with freckles dashed across her cheeks, her eyes were bright and yellow, almost like looking at gold, and her lips were shiny and red, as you continued to gaze at the woman holding you up, a look of worry covered her face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh you poor poor thing, how long have you been here, your absolutely soaked to the bone, won&#39;t surprise me if you catch a cold, and you look so thin!, don&#39;t worry little one il help fix that&quot; she said as she cradled Ty in one arm and opened her low v neck gown with the other before tucking Ty over her left breast and covered him with her gowns fabric before she began speaking in a language Ty had never heard, or at least he guessed.<br />
<br />
The woman&#39;s breast was warm and soft, and extremely large which made it perfect for a cold and tired baby, so consumed by fatigue and the chill of the rain Ty snuggled closer as she held him close to warm him up.<br />
<br />
Then a rumbling sound Jerked Ty awake as it felt like they were both moving, the rhythmic tapping of her bare feet against the ground, and the swaying of her body giving Ty a sense of familiarity that he could not quite place, but then the chill of the outside beyond the fabric was gone, replaced by a warm glow and a welcoming warmth, and voices, so many voices, so many that he began to instinctively wriggling around to try and get a better look, this caused Ty to slip slightly from the woman&#39;s grasp slightly untill he was secured with his face level with the woman&#39;s nipple.<br />
<br />
Ty&#39;s brain continued to accelerate towards infant intelligence, and his hunger drove him to seek out anything he could get into his mouth... and this woman&#39;s breast was right infront of him, a hungry infant that wanted to be fed, so without a moments hesitation he latched on and began to suckle.<br />
<br />
The woman in questions name was Linda, she was a member of the mates and warlocks high council, she was in control of the western woods and all the mages and witches within it, she had come on the call of the witch queen along with every other council member to discuss the matter of the human kingdoms attempting to wipe them out.<br />
<br />
The last thing Linda had expected was to find a newborn on the roots of the doorway into the councils Chambers, and was now attempting to feed from her breasts in the middle of the councils session, Linda had no choice but to stand and bare it as the child tried to get milk from her breast, the only problem with that was that like a select few on the council she was immortal, but immortality had cost her, her fertility, so she had no milk to give this child, but pulling the infant off would cause them to wail and cry, which would probably end with her being thrown out for disrupting the meeting.<br />
<br />
So there was only one thing she could do, while no one was looking she slipped her hand into her gown and put her finger on her breast, never the child&#39;s cheek, quickly checking if the coast was clear she began channeling magic into her breasts hoping it would do something to help with the babies hunger.<br />
<br />
As magical energy flows deep into her tissues, Linda feels a tightness over her breasts, like her skin was no longer flexible enough to contain her milk jugs, and milk jugs was the correct term now as she watched in horror as her tits flew out, turning her low v neck into what now felt like a spandex suit as her magic was turned into large amounts of milk, the feeling of her breasts expanding with life giving milk, plus this infant that she still held to her breast pulling milk from her breasts was unlike anything she had ever seen, but then.....</p>
