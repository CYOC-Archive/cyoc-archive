<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mr. Hyun knew his situation was a precarious one, particularly given what his original mission had been and the fact that many elements of it had failed to a certain extent. They were made even worse given the nature of the present American government, as its leadership would be more than willing to turn him and Ling over to his masters if they tried to defect. It had been one of the things that had driven Chairman Kim to try the entire scheme in the first place, he wouldn&#39;t lose control of his asset. But solving that issue was something that was going to be rather limited. Hyun&#39;s perceived loyalty in the past might prevent immediate suspicion, but the lack of success in bringing Ling back to North Korea would inevitably lead to suspicion, and Hyun knew that he was playing against a clock and one he might not win.<br />
<br />
But as he walked with Ling from the apartment in Animalia that had been set up for her to Horizon&#39;s offices in Lyre, a real part of Mr. Hyun felt the risks were worth it... if only for Ling&#39;s freedom. He still had plenty he could criticize America on, but from what he&#39;d seen in Lyre and Animalia, they&#39;d treated Ling well and with respect. To a degree they&#39;d even treated him well, which he found more surprising given the general relations between the US and North Korea, but he really didn&#39;t care that much about that. What he cared for was Ling&#39;s happiness and safety, and while parts of him had been fine with the scheme before, the more Ling bought into things the Americans took for granted, the more he knew that Ling wouldn&#39;t accept the scheme that Chairman Kim had, and Hyun also knew what happened to those that opposed the &quot;great leader.&quot; He couldn&#39;t let that happen to Ling, as in many ways, she was truly innocent, and even after being told on the full nature of his mission... she&#39;d forgiven him, which Hyun didn&#39;t expect at all.<br />
<br />
&quot;It will be fine,&quot; Ling said to him in Korean as they walked. She gently squeezed his hand. &quot;It will not hurt... and you will have someone who loves you for who YOU are.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hyun&#39;s smile was nervous in return, but he did pat the back of Ling&#39;s hand, &quot;You are too good to me... and my worries are more on the bigger issue at hand.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We will come up with something,&quot; Ling answered, &quot;but for now... let us focus on the good things for the future.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ling offered another soft squeeze of Hyun&#39;s hand and the two continued on. The air was brisk as they walked and some areas of natural snow fall had offered a fairly pristine landscape, even among the buildings of Animalia and Lyre. It wasn&#39;t that long before the pair came up on the complex that was the main Horizon Lab office for the region, and possible for the country, as Hyun had not read that much into Horizon&#39;s corporate history and even now that wasn&#39;t of that much importance to him. He did have some interest in Ling, though, and the part of him that had grown to care for her that went beyond what he&#39;d originally expected was looking forward to that possibility. Some of the open flirtation wasn&#39;t something he expected or was fully comfortable with at times, but a lot of that was Ling&#39;s youth and innocence. The possibility of a family in the future was also attractive, though that would also be something to wait on.<br />
<br />
As they came in, they found Doctor Stein waiting for them as they entered, which was a bit of a surprise.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good afternoon, Mr. Hyun... Ling,&quot; Doctor Stein spoke politely as the two entered, &quot;If you come with me, we can get started.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You were waiting for me?&quot; Hyun asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Given what you had said in your call, I would think it necessary,&quot; Doctor Stein answered, &quot;there will be some paperwork to fill out and we will need Ling for your conversion... but that is fairly standard. But better to offer you some privacy to handle this. One of the specific waiting rooms for conversion would be better than the main waiting area.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hyun accepted that and followed along with Ling at his side. As they passed one of the doors that lead into the lobby desk area, one of the secretaries passed out the needed paperwork that Hyun would need to fill out. Doctor Stein took it and would then lead them on. They eventually came to a small waiting room that was otherwise empty. Doctor Stein ushered Hyun to one of the chairs and let him sit down in it, he focused himself with beginning to fill out the paperwork as Doctor Stein then lead Ling off, which so far as Hyun knew would be needed for the Korean Water Deer strain of the Animalia Virus. It took him a little while to fill out those forms, and he found Doctor Stein had returned and was waiting at the entryway to the waiting room. He also found that Ling was not with him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Where is Ling?&quot; Hyun spoke as he stood up and clutching at the papers with one hand, &quot;what have you done with her?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Easy there,&quot; Doctor Stein raised both hands up with his palms facing toward Hyun, &quot;Ling is waiting for you... part of her request regarding your conversion... I assure you she perfectly fine... and if the paperwork is in order, I will take you to her.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hyun slowly handed the papers over and eyed Doctor Stein suspiciously as he looked them over. Much of his reasoning for doing this was for Ling and her ultimate safety and happiness, something she deserved and likely wouldn&#39;t get in North Korea. Not with the Kim regime as it was, and the last thing he wanted was for Ling to have been harmed after he&#39;d grown as close as he had to her. It didn&#39;t take Doctor Stein long, though, and he soon nodded and motioned for Hyun to follow him. The two returned to the hallway and didn&#39;t go to far as they reached one of the conversion rooms. Doctor Stein went to it and opened the door and held it open for Hyun.<br />
<br />
&quot;She is inside,&quot; Doctor Stein said to him as he approached and then added, &quot;and welcome to Animalia.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hyun slowly walked into the room to find that that lights were low. They were on, as the room didn&#39;t go completely dark when the door was shut behind him, but they were at a low enough level that the difference from the hallway was noticeable. At first he didn&#39;t see Ling, though he did note a neatly folded pile of clothes on the floor of the room, however, he did eventually find her. As he turned, he found Ling half sitting and half laying on the bed that was part of the conversion room, wearing nothing but her underwear, and while the fabric was a sort of grayish color, it was also very sheer, giving him a fairly clear view of her nipples pushing deeply against the cups of her bra and the outline of her vagina.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ling?&quot; Hyun gasped as he looked to her, &quot;Why...?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;All as part of your conversion,&quot; Ling answered as she stood up, &quot;for you have cared for me and been a good man since I was uplifted. There may be some things to work with... but then everyone has something they must work on, and you are a good man. The fact that you spoke honestly to me shows that... and confirms my love and faith in you is well placed.&quot;<br />
<br />
She stood up and approached, as Hyun stood there, partially dumbstruck by this trying to not be embarrassed by the fact that his eyes glanced to Ling&#39;s generous chest as she approached him. He could swear her nipples seamed to be growing erect and pushing hard against the bra she was wearing. She came close and ran her hands along the front of his chest and then inside the lapels of his suit jacket, pulling it out and back. Once it was off his shoulders, she let it go and it practically fell to the floor behind Hyun, who hadn&#39;t moved in surprise, though Ling did smile at the grown scent of arousal coming from him.<br />
<br />
&quot;In theory... Horizon would have the material to do this by injection,&quot; Ling spoke as she pressed herself against him and nuzzled his neck with her muzzle, careful so that her tusks didn&#39;t scratch him, &quot;but that is so... clinical… machine like. It wouldn&#39;t be special... and I&#39;d very much like your joining Animalia... being with me... I would like that to be special. Not just a doctor shooting you with a needle.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ling, I...&quot; Hyun began as Ling reached down to undo his belt buckle.<br />
<br />
&quot;You proved yourself to me. Now let me reward you.&quot; said Ling as she then kissed him and began to lead him back toward the bed, his pants falling down as he stumbled forward, largely as he also still had his shoes on.<br />
<br />
What followed was more clumsy than sexy. With his pants falling around his ankles and Ling trying to lead him to the bed, Hyun fell forward and landed on Ling&#39;s back, pushing her onto the bed. Hyun was quick to roll off and moved to untie his shoes, his face red with embarrassment and deciding to stay quiet on the fact that Ling&#39;s fur tickled him a bit. Ling recovered enough to note him removing his shoes before she commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;I had forgotten about those,&quot; Ling commented as Hyun softly tossed one shoe onto the floor and then smiled as the second shoe soon joined it.<br />
<br />
&quot;I probably won&#39;t need them after converting,&quot; Hyun commend slowly as Ling began working at the buttons on his shirt.<br />
<br />
&quot;And you&#39;ll be warmer too,&quot; Ling smiled to him, &quot;it is cold... but it is nothing I haven&#39;t felt before.&quot;<br />
<br />
By that point as he was undressed, Ling smiled noting Hyun&#39;s erection. It wasn&#39;t huge by any means, but the fact that she had been able to trigger it was enough to let her know that Hyun did find her beautiful and attractive, despite some of the times where he&#39;d tried to be distant when she&#39;d first started flirting with him during the colony tour the previous summer. Feeling beautiful and in the moment she slid off her panties and tossed them over toward where she&#39;d placed her clothes. Her bra soon followed, and as she turned back to Hyun she took his hand and brought it to her furred breasts and let one finger run over an erect nipple.<br />
<br />
&quot;But together... you and I will be plenty warm,&quot; Ling said again and leaned against him, showering his cheeks and neck with soft kisses and ultimately giving a soft moan as he caressed her breasts with his hands, &quot;Yeeeeeeeeessss…&quot;<br />
<br />
Hyun noticed that Ling almost shuddered at his touch, something he found surprising. Largely as he had little in the way of experience with women and his present care for Ling also suppressed any desire to be more aggressive. After all, he didn&#39;t want to hurt her. Conversion through sex was different from what most of the conversions that Horizon had done, but Hyun had to acknowledge the growing feelings he&#39;d had for Ling and did his best to be gentle with her, even as she rolled on top of him with one leg straddling his waist.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve waited for this...&quot; Ling began as she reached down with one hand to touch Hyun&#39;s erect penis and lifted it enough that it aligned with her vaginal lips, &quot;and now... let me be your true love and mate...&quot;<br />
<br />
And with that she lowered herself onto Hyun&#39;s erection, which made both of them moan, though Hyun also suspected that Ling might have been more self prepared for this than he expected. After all, he&#39;d found her in just her underwear, which he hadn&#39;t really expected from her. Regardless, he was inside her and he soon thrust his hips forward while moving to caress her with his hands. For a moment, he rested his hands on her hips as if to hold Ling in place while at other times he moved them over her well toned abdomen and then up to her breasts. As he reached up to her breasts, Hyun did notice some changes.<br />
<br />
His fingernails were darkening and thickening but not coming to a firm point. In this it seemed more hoof-like than anything else, which made since. Water Deer were hooved animals, after all. At the same time Hyun could see tannish-golden brown coat of fur begin to grow in on his arms while there was also a tugging sensation at his ears. He wanted to move his hands to feel them, but he had to admit the up and down bouncing of Ling&#39;s breasts was enough to hold his attention. Even as his feet narrowed and lengthened, with his toes going through a far more drastic change then his hands, with ultimately each foot having two toes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes... my handsome buck...&quot; Ling moaned in between thrusts, and feeling Hyun&#39;s penis grow larger inside her. <br />
<br />
He wouldn&#39;t be as big as some of the other Deer Animalians she&#39;d met at some of Animalia&#39;s formal gatherings, but they were also of larger species. Korean Water Deer weren&#39;t particularly large, and at around 31 pounds at the largest, there were plenty of animals that were bigger than them that were often considered &quot;small&quot; by Humans. Thus, her smaller size had meant that while she was taller than Hyun when he was Human, it wasn&#39;t by much and mostly due to her digitigrade feet, and that left her smaller than the White Tail and Mule Deer Animalians that lived in Lyre and Animalia. That would also mean that Hyun as a male Water Deer Animalian would be smaller than the White Tail and Mule Deer bucks, but what he had was enough for her. And as she saw Hyun&#39;s ears grow into the sort of rounded ears that the Water Deer was known for, along with the long tusks slipping out from his lips. In this, Hyun was becoming a very handsome Korean Water Deer buck and Ling loved every moment and as he began to whistle and squeak with her, she had the sense that he was enjoying himself too.</p>
