<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It took most of the day, down in that basement, to remember himself. To crawl back out of this, to remember who he’d been--or at least pieces of it. Everything was so...jumbled up. High school, college, middle age. Had he been a jock? A coach? Working in construction or on a farm? He didn’t know how to piece it back together, but he had to. He had to be something else, if he was going to get out of here in one piece.<br />
<br />
What did he remember? Everything was so hazy now, it seemed impossible to remember a world beyond this basement, beyond the torture and rape he was subjected to daily, which he’d grown to crave...but there had been something else. He thought about the sun. He could remember it, the sensation of it on his skin, and he clung to that, trying to piece together when he’d last felt it. Sound came next, the sound of hammer and machinery. The smell of pouring concrete and sawdust. It wasn’t much, but it was something, and he clung to it, reached for it, even as the spirit in his mind tried to tempt him away from it, tried to tell him he didn’t really want that, that what he really craved was down here, in the dark. Evan was tenacious, and the spirit was...not angry, but perturbed that he refused to give into its darkness, and so it opened up a bit further, the memory, and more came to him in a flurry. <br />
<br />
The smell of cigars. He remembered that for sure. They were cheap ones--he didn’t make enough for anything fancy after all, and at the rate he smoked them, he cared more about quantity than quality. Other smells too--mostly his own. His unwashed pits, dirty socks and underwear, his farts and belches, and just thinking about them was getting him horny--but then, he loved the smell of a dirty man more than pretty much anything else. But something else too--or maybe...someone else. They were a bit blurry, but getting clearer, the more he thought about them, the more he could smell them, and see them, and--<br />
<br />
***BRRAAAP***<br />
<br />
Evan gave a start, and flung an arm up as he woke up from a nightmare he’d been having in his grungy armchair, with Robbie inches from his face, mouth still open from the belch he’d launched right into Evan’s face. He could smell it--and he could smell Robbie too, and he felt his cock shudder underneath his heavy gut, hanging over his crotch in the recliner. “Fuckin’ hell Robbie, I was sleepin’!”<br />
<br />
“Ya were snorin’ so dang loud I couldn’t hear the damn TV is what ya were doin’!” Robbie said, and then leaned in closer and kissed him, his mouth tasting of beer, salty snacks...and something else that Evan recognized, but couldn’t quite name for some reason. He was more than happy to kiss him back of course--he loved his little sleazebag of a roommate, or boyfriend, or whatever they were.<br />
<br />
They’d met on a construction job a few years prior, and hit it off as friends until one drunken night, they’d come onto one another. It had only been a matter of time before they moved in together, and while they were on the down low, everyone could guess what the two of them were up to. No one gave them too much shit for it, though neither of them had been a very good influence on the other. Robbie now smoked cigars like a chimney, just like Evan, and Robbie had introduced Evan to other, filthier delights. Food, for one thing. He was a hundred pounds heavier now, than when he’d met Robbie, and he hadn’t been small before. Now he was 375 pounds, and while it made work hard, having Robbie clean out all of his filthy rolls every night in bed more than made up for it.<br />
<br />
Then, Evan felt a flash in his mind. This wasn’t right, this wasn’t right at all. He hadn’t been this person, had he? Robbie pulled away, and Evan hauled himself out of the recliner, trying to piece together his memories, but it was a struggle. “Ya alright man?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, just...just gimmie a minute,” Evan said, “Just...gonna get a snack.”<br />
<br />
“I can get one for ya.”<br />
<br />
“I’d rather stretch my legs a sec.”<br />
<br />
Robbie shrugged, and plopped back down on the sofa with a loud fart, and Evan retreated behind him, not to the kitchen, but to the bathroom to look at himself--but when he got there, he was...horrified. The shower didn’t have a shower head, and didn’t look like it had been turned on in ages. The toilet--there simply wasn’t one. He found himself sliding back, remembering how Robbie had convinced him, finally, to just...take it out. They didn’t need one, after all, they had each other. <br />
<br />
In the mirror, he saw himself--sloppily shaved head with a thick beard hiding three chins. He was wearing a grubby, heavily stained wife beater and some no longer white briefs...and he thought he looked...hot. The spirit was pushing harder now--and Evan could sense it wasn’t just trying to get him to accept this life--but forget everything else. More than anything else, though, he was tired. Maybe he should stop. Maybe he should just...accept this, and live with it. HIs gut growled, and he thought about having a snack, and then Robbie would feed him one of his special weight gain shakes before bed, always with his favorite ingredients...<br />
<br />
Evan slapped himself, trying to force himself out of it. The curse was still active, he could get out of this. All he had to do was find someone to insult him. After all, anything would be better than this, right? He went to the bedroom, found a pair of overalls and some boots, and threw them on as quick as he  could, before Robbie noticed what he was doing. He couldn’t explain this after all--Robbie would never believe him. So he slipped out of the apartment Without an explanation, and didn’t dare stop once he hit the sidewalk, even though he was winded by the time he got to the corner.<br />
<br />
It was late in the evening now, and the streets weren’t too busy--but beggers couldn’t be choosers. He’d have to find some way to make someone insult him quick, or he could already tell, he’d lose himself again, wander back up to that apartment, and find himself living the filthy life with Robbie for the rest of his days. However, he also knew he didn’t exactly pass for a faggot at the moment, so he was going to have to try pretty hard to get someone’s attention.</p>
