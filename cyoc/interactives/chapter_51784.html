<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Rick took a walk toward the rocks. He needed to think about somethings. What he needed to think about most was the chaos that still resided in him and the rest of the people who were on the yacht. He knew they would all need some serious counseling to even begin to deal with the chaos and what had happened. Kurse had twisted their souls into mindless beings of chaos. Well there some like him who had strong wills that weren't completely twisted but most of them had been. How coule they cope with that and the way Kurse twisted them? He shuddered remembering the pleasure he had felt as Kurse had used her tail to rape his butt.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why are you asleep Glass?&quot; Rick heard a little girl ask from behind some of the rocks.<br />
<br />
Rounding the rocks Rick saw to glass wolf girls. One looked to be sleeping and the other looked on the other with sadness and guilt. He sighed thinking about how Maylene would take to having a daughter now. &quot;Hello,&quot; he said coming up to them.<br />
<br />
The glass wolf jumped the said, &quot;Oh hello.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm Rick,&quot; Rick said. &quot;What's your name?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Abbey,&quot; Abbey said. &quot;And this is Glass.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know who this is,&quot; Rick said. &quot;I did see her creation. Her name was Dennis but now I think Denise is more appropriate. How come she's still a glass wolf though? Everyone else has mostly if not completely changed back physically.&quot; He looked at some strands of black fur that was still on him. He had been turned into one of the bears.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's my fault,&quot; Abbey said pain in her voice. &quot;We were in the mirrorverse when Kurse died and because of my special power Glass remained a glass pup. But she should be awake because we don't need to sleep in the outside world. We don't have the needs that others have. So why is she asleep?&quot;<br />
<br />
Rick thought back to how Glass was created. &quot;It's possible that she's still trapped where we were,&quot; he said slowly. It made sense.<br />
<br />
&quot;How do we wake her up?&quot; Abbey asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't know,&quot; Rick admitted. &quot;I wish I did but I don't.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe Amy can go get her,&quot; Abbey said looking hopeful.<br />
<br />
&quot;Who's Amy?&quot; Rick asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;She's the one that fought Kurse with Trevor and Paul,&quot; Abbey said.<br />
<br />
&quot;White wolf pup with red markings?&quot; Rick asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Abbey said.<br />
<br />
&quot;YOU!&quot; a voice full of venom said behind Rick.<br />
<br />
Rick turned and saw Gilbert. He had been the one that had gone to see why they had changed course and come back with the explanation that there were reports of pirates and bad weather. Rick had met him on the cruise and had become friends with him. Now he could see the anger in his eyes and he asked, &quot;Are you ok Gilbert?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How could you talk to this monster?&quot; Gilbert asked. &quot;She's the one that brought us here. She's the one responsible for what we became and did.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That was Kurse that was responsible for that,&quot; Rick said.<br />
<br />
&quot;No it was her,&quot; Gilbert said. &quot;And now she'll die and so will you if you try to to stop me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then you'll just have to kill me too,&quot; Rick said feeling the chaos within him growing. He was able to force it down and not give into the impulse to attack. Though he had this feeling that Gilbert wouldn't be so lucky.<br />
<br />
Abbey's words of, &quot;I can't be hurt,&quot; were almost drowned out by Gilbert's roar of, &quot;THEN DIE!&quot; as he attacked.<br />
<br />
Rick was unprepared for the attack and Gilbert hit him with a rock in the side of his head. This sent him crashing into the rocks and before he slid to the ground Gilbert had grabbed him and proceeded to bash his head in. He barely heard Abbey's scream and barely saw the purple wolf pull Gilbert off of him. Fearing that the wolf would hurt him he managed to say, &quot;Don't hurt him. He isn't in his right mind.&quot;<br />
<br />
A dirty blond wolf came into his vision and gently lowered him to the ground then began to examine his head with a sad look on her face. He just saw another glass wolf before he lost consciousness.<br />
<br />
++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;Is he going to be ok Mommy?&quot; Abbey asked. &quot;Please say he will be. He stood between that man and me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Julie shook her head sadly and said, &quot;He's going to be going to sleep for a very long time.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alice knew what that meant. The guy was dying and Auntie Julie said it that way for Abbey's benefit. &quot;Amy said no one would be sleeping like this,&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
&quot;You can wake him up though right Mommy?&quot; Abbey asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;There's nothing I can do,&quot; Julie said shaking her head sadly. &quot;I won't be able to wake him up and I can't stop him from going to sleep.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There has to be something you can do,&quot; Ulysses said still holding onto the man who had attacked the other man.<br />
<br />
&quot;There's nothing you can do for that traitor,&quot; the guy spat. &quot;He's going to die for protecting that glass monster.&quot;<br />
<br />
Julie growled and said, &quot;That monster is my daughter.&quot; She lifted her arm looking like she was going to take the guy's head off.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't hurt him!&quot; Abbey said a pleading note in her voice. &quot;Rick said he wasn't in his right mind and he didn't want him hurt.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There has been enough violence for today Auntie Julie,&quot; Alice said. &quot;Do not add to it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Julie took a deep breath and lowered her arm saying, &quot;You're right Alice. I'll honor Rick's request Abbey. I just wish I could help him.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alice had an idea that might save Rick but should she do it? Would it be ethical? Coming to a decision she said, &quot;Forgive me,&quot; and grabbed Rick jumping into the closet reflective surface which happened to be Abbey dragging him with her.<br />
<br />
Alice landed in the mirrorverse and a split second later Rick landed on top of her. Alice was able to roll him, make that her now, gently off of her. &quot;I am sorry,&quot; she told the still unconscious Rick though that name wouldn't fit now. &quot;This is all we could do to save you.&quot; She looked her over. She had the same color of fur that she, Abbey, and Samantha had. Her dress looked like her's except it was a pale yellow pattern. &quot;I will stay with you till you wake sister/cousin,&quot; she said then licked her face.<br />
<br />
++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;Please just tell me if my son is alright,&quot; Maylene pleaded with Mary and Sasha. &quot;You must know if he is.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We can't tell you if he is or not,&quot; Sasha said sighing. &quot;We don't know the names of the ones at the manor.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Can't you bring them here?&quot; Maylene asked with a pleading look in her eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;We can't,&quot; Sasha said being patient. &quot;If we did they would be turned into glass wolf pups and would more than likely be girls. It's the way Alice was transformed and that extends to the ones she transformed by pulling them into the mirrorverse.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How do you know that?&quot; Maylene asked.<br />
<br />
Mary and Sasha exchanged a quick glance. They had been told what happened with Glass and Abbey. &quot;One of the ones Alice transformed, Abbey, had been wrestling with Glass in the mirrorverse when Kurse died,&quot; Sasha said. &quot;It seems that since they went into the mirrorverse together that Abbey's power kept Glass as she was when Kurse died. However it's just a theory as there's something strange with Glass.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What is that?&quot; Maylene said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Glass is sleeping,&quot; Sasha said. &quot;I've never seen one of the glass pups sleeping outside of the mirrorverse but she is. We have no theories as to why.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Can I see her?&quot; Maylene asked hoping that she would find her son even if he was her daughter now.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can take you to her,&quot; Sasha said. Then looking at the other parents nearby who didn't know if one of their children is still on the island said, &quot;If Glass isn't Dennis I'll come back and I'll take another parent to see her. I'll also see if we can get some photos or video of the children that are at the manor. That way we can figure out who Glass is by process of elimination. I know you're worried about your children but those at the manor are safe.&quot;<br />
<br />
Maylene followed Sasha and soon they were at the rock outcropping where Abbey and Glass were along with Gilbert, Ulysses, Julie, and Darla. Looking at them Maylene asked, &quot;Do any of you know if my son is here? His name's Dennis.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Rick said that was what Glass was called,&quot; Abbey said. &quot;Are you her Mommy?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes I am,&quot; Maylene said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sorry,&quot; Abbey said her head down. &quot;I didn't mean to transform her. She pushed me into the mirrorverse and I didn't get her out before Kurse died. And my power kept her a glass wolf. I didn't mean it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Maylene hugged Abbey trying to comfort her and said, &quot;It's ok. Things were chaotic and it just happened. I don't blame you. I blame Kurse for this. I'll just have to get use to having a glass wolf daughter.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There may be a problem with that,&quot; Julie and Darla said slowly.<br />
<br />
Maylene looked up and asked, &quot;What problem?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Part of Alice's transform said she and anyone she made like her would be loyal to the pack,&quot; Sasha said. &quot;Dennis might not even recognize you as her mother now.&quot;<br />
<br />
A tear ran down Maylene's cheek at this. She thought for a bit then asked, &quot;Can she be changed back?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We think so,&quot; Darla said. &quot;Though it's possible that the curse integrated the locking of our forms into the glass pups power. We won't know for sure until we test it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I'll volunteer to be made into a glass wolf to test it,&quot; Maylene said. &quot;If it doesn't work I can still be with Dennis right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My daughter Alice took Rick into the mirrorverse so we can use him to test it,&quot; Darla said.<br />
<br />
&quot;If he survived we can,&quot; Julie said.<br />
<br />
&quot;What happened to him?&quot; Maylene asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I killed him,&quot; Gilbert said happily. &quot;And I'll kill all of you too. Just you wait.&quot; He then laughed like a madman.<br />
<br />
Maylene was shocked at this. She had been delighted to find out that her friend Rick would be coming on the cruise too. Now to think that he may be dead was a heavy weight on her heart. Taking a breath she said, &quot;Then you will need someone to test it with and I'm willing to risk being stuck as a wolf.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you sure?&quot; Julie asked. &quot;We don't want to transform anyone that isn't willing and there is the chance you may be stuck.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sure,&quot; Maylene said.<br />
<br />
Julie and Darla nodded accepting Maylene's wish.</p>
