<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After discovering the stains, you no longer wanted to wear that costume. The sticky white goo was probably hair gel and you were allergic to that demonic stuff. After removing the costume and hiding it behind one of the trashcans you stood bare naked in the locker room.<br />
<br />
You caught sight of yourself in the mirrors and flexed your feeble muscles for a bit. Damn, you sure looked hot! If you sucked your belly in and covered your premature male pattern baldness you wouldn’t stand out among the muscular athletes of Barely Legal High too much... Or at least that’s what you thought.<br />
<br />
You fantasized for a bit, wondering how would the girls react if they were to know that such a handsome genius like you would be honoring their showers with your presence. Your virgin cock twitched.<br />
<br />
You used the Invisibility-Ray on yourself and as expected your reflection disappeared from the mirrors. You think of where to hide your Ray (after all, you’ll need both hands available for... You know...) when you facepalm your invisible head. You just had to make the Invisibility-Ray itself invisible as well, duh! So you shoot a beam against the mirror which ricocheted and impacted against the ray gun itself, then you threw the invisible thing away.<br />
<br />
You ran around in circles naked as a jaybird in excitement. You couldn’t wait for the cheerleaders to show up and see some flesh-and-blood titties up close! You hear some steps and prepare yourself to leap into a magical world full of eroticism when the door opens and an stampede of huge brute men come marching inside, their colossal weight barely noticing a small delicate branch that snapped below their feet (you).<br />
<br />
“What the...? I thought it was the girl’s changing room!” You cry to your insides as they huge men step on you one by one, some of their feet crushing your ribs, others crushing your virgin balls. <br />
<br />
“Please stop! There’s a handsome genius down here!” You yelled out completely in vain because the brute athletes were loudly yelling and laughing among each other.<br />
<br />
After the stampede ends, you try to stand up but then football uniforms and sweaty jockstraps started raining down from the sky, burying your small form.<br />
<br />
You try not to breath the other males’ pheromones but you weren’t a swimmer so you soon drowned in their scent. You hear the men laughing and teasing each other as they showered. Some of them even mentioned how hard they were gonna pound their girlfriends tonight, which makes you kind of jealous.<br />
<br />
You climb out from the sea of dirty clothes. You have to get out of here ASAP! You ran towards the door when you realized you forgot your Invisibility-Ray! “Shit, that prototype is worth thousands in building materials alone!” You then wonder why you didn’t spend that money in hiring a hooker instead.<br />
<br />
You went to the spot you had left the Ray on, but it was nowhere to be seen...! Well, that was to be expected. But when you reached out to pick it up your hands didn’t find anything!<br />
<br />
“Dang it, one of those brutes must have kicked it!” You realized.<br />
<br />
You fished around the air as you searched for the expensive artifact. You crawled around the locker room until you noticed that the water falling in one of the showers seemed to flow in mid-air... The Ray had to be inside that shower stall!<br />
<br />
You crawled under the closed shower stall door, and you were about to grab the Ray when a pair of bare feet kicked it away into the stall to the right. “Fuck me!” You yelled in your crouched position.<br />
<br />
The most muscular player on the team, the quarterback, turned around as he showered. Had he just heard a voice saying “Fuck me” behind him? But he saw nobody else in his stall, so he continued washing his cock with the soap.<br />
<br />
You were terrified. The dude you were showering with (that sounds kinda gay) was touching his gigantic cock inches away from your nose. You could smell the scent of his pubic area. The sweaty athlete’s penis and balls forcing their peculiar odor into your throat and you could almost taste it. Yuck!<br />
<br />
You wished you could crawl away from the stall, but the muscle hunk’s body was too close for comfort. You didn’t want to risk it, so you just stood there, trying to keep the cock dancing at your eye level as far as possible from your face.<br />
<br />
Then, you saw an opportunity to escape. The quarterback’s bar of soap had fallen into the floor. While he was busy looking for it you had enough space to resume your crouching stance and leave the stall! Unfortunately you slipped a bit and were left face up for a fraction of a second.<br />
<br />
The quarterback’s vision got clouded at that exact same second. A small drop of hair gel had fallen into his eye and it itched like hell. He was about to retrieve the squishy bar of soap when he grabbed something... quite different. It was squishy, yes, and the texture felt familiar, but it couldn’t be what he was thinking because he didn’t know things like these could come in such small sizes. He tried to yank it from the floor but it seemed to be stuck or something...Wait, did it just move? It was hairy, too, was there a rat or something in the showers? The thought made him shriek like a little girl, but when his vision cleared, he didn’t see anything out from the ordinary.<br />
<br />
You crawled out from shower stall, your eyes wide open in shock. That guy... A *GUY*!... Had just tried to jerk you off! He had just casually grabbed your penis and pulled it like it was nothing! Your precious first time having your genitals touched ruined... By a *GUY*!<br />
<br />
Feeling disgusted and ashamed of yourself, you ran to the lavatories and washed your dick with a lot of soap. You wanted to remove the other guy’s bacteries before they infected you with gayness.<br />
<br />
But no matter how much you cleaned your (still relatively virgin) junk you still felt gross. You sighed. You hadn’t retrieved the Invisibility-Ray yet but you were about to give up on it, when suddenly...<br />
<br />
“Oh, god, what the hell is THAT?” An athlete that had already finished his shower yelled out pointing in your direction. The other players came out from their respective shower stalls and gasped similarly.<br />
<br />
But their gazes weren’t on your eyes. They were on your crotch.<br />
<br />
“Dammit, did the effects of the Invisibility-Ray wear out this soon?!” You wondered. Then you looked at the mirrors and were equally as shocked as the jocks.<br />
<br />
There, in the middle of the locker room... Stood a floating dick. Your dick. Crap! Putting this much soap on it must have removed the invisibility effect from it, and it alone! You suddenly felt cold and exposed.<br />
<br />
The players laughed as the cock and balls shivered and retracted mid-air. You tried to cover up your cock with your hands but... It was futile. Your invisible hands couldn’t cover up something that was perfectly visible, no matter how much you tried.<br />
<br />
The invisible you and your visible cock turned around, heading towards the exit.<br />
<br />
“Guys, it’s clearly a dildo on a wire!... Wait, do dildos even come in such small sizes?”<br />
<br />
“I wonder if it’s an animatronic, I can’t wait to dismantle it!”<br />
<br />
“Duh, it’s clearly the spirit of some vengeful stalker’s cock!”<br />
<br />
“Everyone, quick! Tackle that ghost dick before it gets away!” The quarterback ordered, and the naked athletes stampeded in your direction as your hand was about to reach the door handle.</p>
