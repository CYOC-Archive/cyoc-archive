<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">-First Half in the Perspective of Rita-<br />
<br />
If it was one thing Rita wasn&#39;t fond of, it was books... Yet, here they were in a bookstore following the newest part of the chase. Sure, Gabriella says there&#39;s some &#39;residual effect&#39; here but, they haven&#39;t found anything yet. Oh well, my job is to stand at the door and menace the passerby. THAT I was built to handle, not this fancy magic shit. Crossing her arms and adjusting her back on the door frame Rita looked over to her group. <br />
<br />
Scarlet sat atop the counter in the front overseeing the operation while adding a suggestion here and there. Mollie was being her usual unhelpful self and looking through the books on the shelves. Freya volunteered to search the back just to stay out of sight of the front windows. Lastly, Gabriella was grumbling something fierce as she tried to pin down just what it was that happened here. Rolling her eyes, Rita looked out over the passing folks, who had no idea just what had come around. The group comes together like this for this kind of thing just in case its that mythical bitch. <br />
<br />
Yeah, the story goes, some witch bitch caused trouble a long time ago... Ancestors showed up to deal with her and finished the job. Alright, sure, they didn&#39;t exactly come out the same or without a problem... Problem was and it makes some kind of sense, the ancestors could only have daughters. Oh sure, the so many greats grand-daddy tried a few times. All daughters, even when they married out of the family lines. So maybe something did go down about a witch after all. Ah well, what comes of it is, magic shit happens, the families go out and solve it. Just in case that stone bitch somehow woke up. Tapping her foot, Rita refocused on her group again when a scream from Freya drew all of their attention.<br />
<br />
Leaving the door, Rita lumbered just behind Gabriella and Scarlet as they rushed to the back to help Freya. As the entered the backroom of the shop, Freya had backed herself behind a stack of boxes and was pointing toward a... trash can... Leave it to the -fearless- Freya to be startled by a trash can of all things. Scarlet was already moving to comfort Freya and try to make out what she was mumbling when Gabriella adjusted her glasses. Rita leaned against the backdoor frame this time taking her customary position as she watched Gabriella cautiously approach the garbage. A gasp escaped Gabriella&#39;s lips just before she covered them reaching in with her other hand to pinch something. A moment later, she pulled of all things, a condom from the trash. Had a weird print on it to be sure from what Rita could see but, that didn&#39;t make it special. <br />
<br />
As Gabriella uncovered her mouth to explain her finding, Mollie burst through the door tripping over Rita&#39;s foot. Landing with all the grace of a lacy tumbleweed into the boxes near Freya and Scarlet. With the distraction abated, Gabriella opened her mouth once more to speak and was cut off by a blurted out puff from Mollie.<br />
<br />
&quot;I found something on one of the shelves!&quot; Shouted Mollie as her frilly pink shirt settled over her face. She had crashed upside down and was unabashed as her animal print panties proudly displayed a cartoon lion head to the room. A second later, her arm shot up holding out a wrinkled magazine that Scarlet took from her. <br />
<br />
Scarlet regarded the rolled up thing before turning her eyes to the obviously upset and quickly sickening Gabriella. &quot;Go ahead Gabs, you found yours first.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gabriella took a deep breath, closing her eyes, and opening them again as she spoke. &quot;I think I found the product of the residual magic from the front.&quot; She held up the used condom based on the end being tied off. &quot;Poor girl got made into this thing and well, we can say they at least have male genitalia now, considering... Unfortunately, we might not be able to pinpoint who it was by what&#39;s inside her because they might know how to deal with that...&quot; She walked over to a central table and gently rested the condom girl on it. With it being closer now, the print could be made out in the form of a nude young woman. Her freckled face looking real &#39;excited&#39; about her situation.<br />
<br />
Scarlet nodded along with Gabriella&#39;s assumption and held up the magazine Mollie had found. &quot;Seems it&#39;s not as simple as one this time.&quot; Unrolling the wrinkled pages, this time it was a porno mag on display. &quot;Lusty Librarian&quot; plastered across the top, so not only were they chasing a magical perv, they were a comedian... Great... Scarlet continued once more. &quot;Seems they had a little help filling up that poor girl... Think there&#39;s anything we can do for them since we have these two?&quot;<br />
<br />
Gabriella shrugged and shook her head. &quot;I... I couldn&#39;t say... It&#39;s possible? We&#39;d have to bring them back and give it a try...&quot;<br />
<br />
Scarlet nodded again producing a bag from the pack Freya carries. &quot;We&#39;ll have to do them the indignity of bagging them for now then. Sorry, girls.&quot; She placed the magazine in first and strode over to the table to place the condom in after. She sealed the bag and came over to Rita. &quot;I trust you to keep them safe in the meantime. I know, you&#39;re the one to be able to do it.&quot; With a winning smile, she placed the bag in Rita&#39;s hands and clapped her shoulder. &quot;Well, now do we have to wait for them to strike again or do we think we can chase them now officially...?&quot;<br />
<br />
Freya spoke up for the first time since she&#39;d screamed earlier. &quot;Let me just go home and search the web, might find out something?&quot; She seemed as uncertain as ever but, ever the champ, Scarlet gave her the go ahead. <br />
<br />
Scarlet looked to Rita &quot;Rita, take Freya home and stay with her for a bit. We&#39;ll wrap up things here.&quot;<br />
<br />
Standing up from the doorframe, Rita motioned with her head for Freya to move on. The two of them walked out of the bookstore and through the crowds with Freya by her side. As Freya was saying something, a man passed by them giving off the sort of creeper vibes, one just didn&#39;t need and she pulled Freya to her side. A yelp from Freya was all that Rita heard from her as they left the district behind.<br />
<br />
-Switch to Alex&#39;s perspective-<br />
<br />
So the police were already investigating not just the old detective&#39;s disappearance but, now the two bookie&#39;s from the store. Seems two undercovers had just come out and passed him on by. The big one gave him a dirty look, he was sure of it. Whatever, it&#39;s not like the bitch could know it was him anyway. This magic stuff was really doing it for him, maybe he&#39;d try something with a bit more flair now. Kinda like what he&#39;d done with the detective the first time. Wouldn&#39;t that be something... Alex passed the bookstore on by without a second glance. Yeah, he broke the code by visiting the scene again but, hell if they&#39;d figure it out. <br />
<br />
He kept walking for a long while as the crowds started thinning out, he locked on to the old school blonde beauty type. Flowing hair, perky breasts, nice ass, and great thighs. Licking his lips he&#39;d set off behind her, staying about half a block back. He could see her hips swaying and the fine peach shape of her ass through the joggers she was wearing. Add that to the crop top hanging off her breasts showing just enough bra to make it interesting? Oh yeah, a prime target to be sure. She must&#39;ve noticed him too because her pace picked up a bit, With that, the chase was on in earnest.<br />
<br />
A left here, a right there, they wandered seemingly aimlessly through the blocks as he calmly pursued her. It came to an end when she made the classic blunder of trying to lose him in an alley way. Come on now, that&#39;s where my type thrive, he thought to himself. He turned the corner into the alley way and pretended not to notice her some ways in as he began drawing in those purple lines of magic again. Sure, the woman almost got half way to the road before she froze in place. Strutting up to her, Alex placed a hand on her chin. &quot;Baby, you are a piece of art, you know that?&quot; He set her back to the dirty wall as her clothing faded into the dust at their feet. &quot;Let&#39;s just enjoy this for a moment, huh?&quot; <br />
<br />
Seeing the fear and panic in her eyes was giving him everything he needed to make this exciting for him. She didn&#39;t even notice that her back wasn&#39;t just against the wall, it was in the wall. Dropping his pants, he waited for her elbows and knees to sink in before he let go of her. &quot;This is going to be just as new for me as it is for you, Honey...&quot; He said with a twisted smile as he made the first advances on her. Groping her breasts, feeling the firmness of them and how they pressed out between his fingers. He ran the tip of his dick up and down along her puffy vaginal lips as he waited for them to loosen just enough. All the while the magic drew her into the wall and brought her closer to submission. It didn&#39;t take long until he was thrusting with force, each clap of their bodies sounding loud against the near silent alley way. Alex made no attempt to kiss her seeing as when he&#39;d considered it, her mouth and nose were the only things left out of the wall. He really didn&#39;t want to risk losing his tongue, especially when he wouldn&#39;t be able to get it back...<br />
<br />
Eventually, his stomach was slapping against bricks while her waist still jut out from the wall. Giving the breasts one last firm squeeze before him thrust one last time, he released inside her and pushed off. The breasts sucked into the wall with his push and her vagina gushed once before leaving a dribbling trail down the wall where it had once stuck out of. Pulling up his pants, he regarded the work of art that they had just created. Frozen in ecstasy on the wall was a lifelike depiction of a blonde bombshell, spread eagle for all to see. There was even some of the aftermath depicted in there as well. Whatever hadn&#39;t already spilled out before it finished taking effect. He gave the wall a few explorative slaps to find it to be firm brick under his touch, Alex started laughing out loud. His belt buckle in place and a tear wiped from his eye, he couldn&#39;t wait for this one to be found or for that matter, his next victim.</p>
