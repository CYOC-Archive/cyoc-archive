<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Feeling great that she feed some worms to her shit cousin Tom, Julie went back to her attic retreat to study and starting working on her extra credit homework for her history class. Julie was having a rough time adjusting to college. Then fact she did not have a set schedule like she did from kindergarten to senior year of high school. She was getting used to the freedom college provided and the fact professors are not going to remind her about assignments. If you failed a class, you have to fit the bill. Even though Julie was an A+ plus student all her life college was somehow throwing her off. It didn&#39;t help that all her friends were going to different colleges across the country and she would be missing not only diehard friends but also great study buddies. She was scared of not being able to make connections with people at her university and being alone. She felt like she was too weak. She is the type of person that gives out positive energy and asks for nothing in return. Julie thrives when she makes connections with people. Her friends Ryan and Samantha describes Julie as the most intelligent and nurturing person they have ever met. They hope that Julie can find someone that makes her feel special and takes care of her the same way she does to everyone else.  Julie&#39;s friends assured her that she will be successful and most likely the most successful out of the friend group. She thanked her friends for the complements but she was in a funk. <br />
<br />
Julie was also one of those rare people where her beauty on the outside matched what was on the inside. Julie was a living angel. She had the most captivating green eyes. Her long dark brown hair was always amazing no matter what. At 5&#39;6&#39;&#39; she had ample 34DD breasts, a slim waist, and a perfect ass. Julie was wearing a white maxi floral sun dress with blue and pink flowers on it. She was wearing a set of white bra and panty underneath. Her long hair was in a very cute looking messy bun. She was a state champion soccer player in high school. <br />
<br />
She was having a hard time starting her extra credit homework because she just realized that she needed to finish another mandatory homework for art appreciation. Then she heard loud screaming coming from Tom. <br />
<br />
&quot;Julie!!!!!&quot;<br />
&quot;Julie!!!!&quot; <br />
&quot;Julie!!!!&quot; <br />
It sounded like he was going to be shot or something. She then ran down the stairs thinking he was hurt. <br />
<br />
He was lying down on the living room couch when he said<br />
&quot;Julie I think I need to see a doctor...... I am in so much pain&quot;<br />
Julie was ready to rush him to the ER <br />
&quot;I cannot walk please pick me up&quot;<br />
&quot;Okay&quot; she said while picking him up<br />
He then procced to rip and loud fart and burp right in her face, adding a little spit<br />
She wanted to drop him on the head but she knew better<br />
Once he was on the ground he stuck the middle finger at her and went away. <br />
<br />
She was just broken at this point <br />
She just sobbed feeling like an idiot for agreeing to watch Tom and the fact she may not be done with her work on time. <br />
<br />
Once Tom reached him room. The gas came back but it felt real bad. It felt like the gas was ripping apart his insides. He feel to the ground in pain. He felt hot like he was baking from the inside so he stripped down removing everything. He was moving around like a worm. Then he farted but it felt so painful. His bones were changing they were breaking and reforming yet they were becoming stronger. His entire skeleton grew with him. His skull was reforming and he screamed while he was still farting. His short blonde hair was turning a dark brown and growing till it was long. He was now 5&#39;6&#39;&#39; a massive increase from 4&#39;1&#39;&#39;. His ass became incredible and he grew 36DD breasts. Then he really felt pain. His little boy dick and balls were quickly pulling back into himself and soon he had a new hole. Tom then stayed on the floor for 12 minutes. Tom got up and was greeted with his cousin Julie looking right back at Tom. His old blue eyes stayed with him. Putting his hands on his new boobs <br />
<br />
&quot;Wow Hello Julie&quot;<br />
&quot;Julie I am Julie&quot;<br />
<br />
Tom felt like someone was drilling into his head. His very mind was being destroyed as he closed his eyes.<br />
<br />
Soon Julie was looking in the mirror seeing a naked reflection with her captivating green eyes. <br />
<br />
She then snapped back to the current situation<br />
<br />
&quot;I am Julie..... I am in Tom&#39;s room.... That is odd last I remember was making a &quot;potion&quot;... why am I here?, Sarah was not fucking around!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I have to find Julie... Me..... Fuck!&quot;<br />
<br />
She then rushed to the attic knowing she would be working on school work. <br />
<br />
She then saw a crying Julie in the living room <br />
<br />
Crying Julie looked up and saw something terrifying <br />
<br />
A naked clone of herself was in front of her <br />
<br />
&quot;WHAT THE FUCK&quot; crying Julie was on the floor her breathing was heavy <br />
<br />
Naked Julie came down to the ground trying to calm herself down<br />
<br />
&quot;Breathe Jules, Breathe Jules&quot; giving her a hug <br />
<br />
Julie calmed downed after a while <br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you for calming me down Julie&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course anytime&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay so there are two of us.... okay I am sorry I will prepare the reversal potion and you&#39;ll be back to nor-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Julie even though my body formed from Tom I am not him..... Don&#39;t change me back just yet&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why not, there needs to be a Tom when our family returns&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes true, but, we only need a Tom on the day of their return&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay fair point&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Plus one less asshole around&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Another fair point&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You are a genius Julie&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;By the way that messy bun looks great&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow seeing my self from this angle is so weird and cute and hot at the same time&quot; They both said <br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, perfect we can both be study and homework buddies for the time being&quot; They both said <br />
<br />
They high fived <br />
<br />
&quot;Julie I am going to the guest bedroom to put on my clothes I don&#39;t want to be naked&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay&quot; <br />
<br />
As the naked Julie was walking off <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Jules when you are there go back to Tom&#39;s-&quot;<br />
 <br />
<br />
&quot;-Room and get his laptop was thinking the same thing beautiful&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Julie was about to get started on work again then her twin joined her <br />
<br />
She looked beautiful with her blue sundress. It showed a little more cleavage. Her bra and panties matched the original Julie. She also had her hair in an identical messy bun. She had Tom&#39;s laptop.<br />
<br />
Julie was in awe at her beauty<br />
<br />
&quot;Hope I am not too late... I had a hard time deciding what to wear&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;No worries angel let&#39;s get to work&quot;<br />
<br />
The two Julies were able to get a lot done and they did everything they needed and more. Julie was a great study buddy to begin with having a perfect clone of herself amplified the effect. She was thriving off on this connection she was making with herself. Both Julies were starting to hate the idea of Tom coming back. After a long day the two Julies made a pasta dinner and it was effortless. They then got out of their sundresses and just stayed in their bra and panties. They let down their long beautiful dark brown hair. Julie didn&#39;t realize just how sexy she was until she had a clone of herself. Her lust was slowly building up throughout the day. They were on the couch watching a movie both of them loved together then her twin talked to her <br />
<br />
&quot;Jules&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Jules&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I was thinking do we really need Tom to come back?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I think Aunt Gwen and Uncle Phillip would like that&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But would they really... Tom was a jackass and a horrible person and a future evil dick in the waiting, there was no way he was going to change. Aunt Gwen and Uncle Phillip said he was there biggest mistake. Aunt Gwen literally told us she hates herself for not getting an abortion when she had him &quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I see what you are say-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No Jules I love you and I love the bonds we built today you cannot deny how perfect we are for each other&quot;<br />
<br />
 Her twin was right <br />
<br />
There needed to be more good people like Julie in this world. Aunt Gwen and Uncle Phillip would love to hear that their biggest mistake was erased and replaced with something better the beloved family favorite Julie. If they did not then the family could go fuck off. So what if there was two Julies it was better than having a future deadbeat. <br />
<br />
&quot;We need to destroy that reversal potion recipe&quot;<br />
<br />
With haste they looked in the attic to ensure there was only one copy of the reversal potion. There was only one. Julie held the paper over the sink with a lighter in hand<br />
<br />
&quot;I am so sorry Sarah, I know this was a lot of hard work on your part and we appreciate the effort. But I am doing this out of love and I this part of your work must die.&quot;<br />
<br />
Julie lit the reversal potion recipe on fire and let in burn. She then put out the fire and sent the ashes down the sink. <br />
<br />
Tom was never coming back now <br />
<br />
The two Julies hugged <br />
<br />
&quot;I love you&quot; They both said <br />
<br />
They then went into the master bedroom and striped down.<br />
<br />
They were both naked and loved seeing a perfect naked twin. <br />
<br />
Julie was sexy and she was going to make love to herself  <br />
<br />
They then fell on the bed kissing each other dirty<br />
<br />
Julie knew how sensitive her nipples were and she flicked them <br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck you nasty slut yes!&quot; <br />
<br />
They then 69ed each other. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Fuck I love you Julie&quot; was all that could be heard <br />
<br />
The two Julies wanted more<br />
<br />
They looked to see if Aunt Gwen and uncle Phillip had any sexy toys<br />
<br />
They couldn&#39;t find any <br />
<br />
&quot;I have an idea&quot; They both said <br />
<br />
They walked to Tom&#39;s old room and looked in his toy chest<br />
<br />
&quot;Someone won&#39;t be needing these&quot; Julie said to her twin <br />
<br />
They walked back to the living room and procced to shove the various large action figures in there pussies<br />
<br />
After 2 hours of sex they were exhausted<br />
<br />
&quot;I love you&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I love you too&quot;<br />
<br />
It seems Ryan and Samantha&#39;s hopes and dreams for Julie came true. Julie found someone that makes her feel special and takes care of her the same way she does to everyone else... herself. Both Julies dozed off to sleep thankful to the woman Sarah Rosengarten.</p>
