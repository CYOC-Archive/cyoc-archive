<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As he stared out of his condo window, watching the Seattle skyline turn purple from the setting sun and then a dull yellow from all the city lights illuminating the night sky; Jack Crawford turned around to turn off the television. Tired of hearing nothing but Frederick Parker’s near brush with death; the man hunt for the mobster’s would be murderer and the man’s past deeds.<br />
<br />
Walking back to his office and staring at his computer; Jack sighs as he sees nary a response from all the emails he composed, all the phone calls made. The article Ella Ayn wrote detailing his and Kenya’s past did its damage all too well. With their social circles rapidly declining; the revelation that Crawford and Ashford were the same person; as well as Kenya Adezze and Kendra Smythe also the same person. For Kenya it was the damming revelation that she supplemented her income from her job as bank teller, by being a high priced escort for the wealthy and elite of Seattle. That news scuttled Kenya’s political aspirations in being the next Mayor of Moon Lake. For Jack, the foray into politics was merely a stepping stone into a grand plan of ousting Benton Knight from a company that Jack’s father help found.<br />
<br />
“Crawford & Knight, Seattle’s answer to Proctor & Gamble”; is what the old yellowed newspaper article framed and next to a photo of Kenya. Jack had the entire article commit to memory, yet he still kept it on his desk as reminder of what he felt was rightfully his. Neither he nor his father Joseph Crawford expected Benton to throw them out shortly after Anton Knight stepped down as CEO.<br />
“A rigged proxy fight,” Jack mutters as he shuts down his computer; “and a company rebranding afterwards.”<br />
<br />
********<br />
<br />
In another condo building across form Jack Crawford’s; two observers looked on with a stony expression as they observed the lights in Jack Crawford’s condo. The observers, two white were-tigers currently in their fursonas; Far Hojun and his grandson Kai Wang, the heads of the Chinese tech company Wang Technological Consortium.<br />
<br />
Originally, they came to Moon Lake to collect on a debt the Skulk owed to the White Tiger clan. That debt was to remove Benton Knight from Knight Industries and have his emancipated daughter Frieda Knight take control. That plan changed after Benton made some changed to his life style; one being a better father to his daughter. The other was finding out about Jack Crawford’s attempt to impose a no confidence vote on Benton after securing enough voting stock to sit on the board. While it was a very small amount of stock, it was enough that Wang Technological had to run interference as they held a sizable amount of Knight Industry stock. Going on the strategy that its best to deal with the Devil know versus the one you don’t; Far and Kai ensure that Jack’s no-confidence motion never passed a second motion at the yearly shareholders meeting in New York.<br />
<br />
“Anything new,” Far breaking the silence as he notices his grandson looking at the laptop computer set up.<br />
“Just the same outgoing emails from earlier,” Kai remarking of Jack’s attempt at damage control; “no responses from the recipients.”<br />
“Well it looks like our frustrated were-panther is turning in for the night,” Far noticing another light going out.<br />
“Shall I turn to the parabolic dish then,” Kai having the specially made headphone in his paws; “Jack might make a few phone calls we could listen in on.”<br />
“No,” Far shaking his head to look at Kai; “most likely all you’ll hear is Jack and Kenya rutting. I rather not be listening to that. So let’s turn in ourselves,” Far placing a white furry paw on Kai’s furry shoulder; “a few hours’ sleep and we head straight to Tachibana’s estate in Moon Lake. Let law enforcement deal with Jack from here on out.”<br />
<br />
*******<br />
<br />
As Jack started to turn off the lights and prepare for bed; the were-panther can’t help but go back to that strange message his private detective sent him earlier.<br />
‘Primary target dealt with. Going to ground.’<br />
Unsure what that meant, Jack was going to call the man up to find out what he was rambling about. The news of Frederick Parker being shot, with police all riled up like ants after someone kick in and ant hill. The thought was lost on Jack that the greasy private eye he hired was really a hitman that already had a contract in Moon Lake. Giving the man several people and their locations to spy on; Jack unwittingly made himself a pawn in an elaborate plot. A plot to have Frederick Parker killed; ensuring the man doesn’t flip and provide evidence that will implicate other mobsters in and around the state of California.<br />
<br />
Putting the thought aside, Jack looks at his wife dozing in their bed; smiling as he closes the door to the bedroom and crawling on the bed. Watching her tail twitch as she dreamed; with a smile on her muzzle, Jack knew it was a pleasant dream. Spending half the day dealing with her heat as he tried to conduct business; plowing her in various sexual positions, satisfying her needs while using the rutting himself as a great stress relief. Jack wasn’t sure if Kenya did take her were-birth control pill or not. Gently tracing a path from her digitigrade paws up to her furry belly with his paw; Jack smiled as Kenya murred at his touch. Stirring from her slumber as she looks at his feline face staring back at her.<br />
“You ready for another rut,” Jack slowly climbing on top of Kenya; his pink were-panther rod proudly out if it’s sheathe and leaking pre-cum<br />
“Rowr,” Kenya licking her lips; spreading her legs and giving Jack a clear invitation to her open sex.<br />
<br />
Jack chuckles as he lowers his muzzle to Kenya’s; pressing his moist nose to hers, kissing as best as they could. Kenya yowls as she feels Jack’s barbed penis enter tunnel. Her yowling turning into mewling as she revels in the sensation of the many fleshy barbs digging into her slick canal.<br />
“Don’t you dare stop,” Kenya muttering between gasps; “give me your seed. Every drop,” Kenya yowls; feeling her mate’s member hitting that sensitive spot in her. A barb scraping it as Jack pulls out only to thrust in again; repeating over and over again.<br />
<br />
Jack grunts as he grips Kenya at the shoulders with his paws; her heady scent of arousal fueling his desire to fuck her senseless. The pleasure of the rut over ridding his desire to ask if Kenya managed to take her pill; Jack just kept pounding his wife as he came close to his release. Picking up in pace and tempo; Jack started to yowl himself as he knew his moment was about to come. Wanting to make sure Kenya wasn’t having any seconds thoughts, Jack gripped Kenya tighter as he made his final few thrusts; feeling the twitch and spasm as his seed splashes into Kenya in thick ropey spurts. The were-panther looks at Kenya as he watches her pant and gasp; knowing her orgasm is rocking her to the core in tune to his member’s twitching.<br />
<br />
*******<br />
<br />
As they lay snuggled next to each other; their tails twitching playfully after their recent bout of love making. Jack adjusts his grip on Kenya; moving his paws from resting just under her furry breasts to more towards her belly, enjoying how her soft fur rubs on his calloused paw pads.<br />
“I can’t remember,” Jack breaking the silence; “did you take your pill this morning?”<br />
“I’m not sure,” Kenya purring; “does it really matter? We are planning to start a family are we not?”<br />
“Yes,” Jack rumbling in pleasure; rubbing Kenya’s belly, picturing it swollen with his cub.<br />
“Then let it happen,” Kenya slowly drifting off; her heat temporarily cooled as she snuggled more deeply into Jack. Forgetting about the dream she had before morning in which she lamented to Jack about being barren.</p>
