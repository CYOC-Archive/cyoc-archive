<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The door bell rang.  <br />
<br />
Kody was busy washing his short brown curly hair in the shower when he heard it ring for the first time.<br />
&quot;Whoever it is they will just have to come back later...&quot; he says resuming his lather rinse and repeat.<br />
<br />
The door bell rings again.<br />
<br />
Kody paused for a moment.<br />
&quot;Who could possibly be ringing my doorbell at this time of day... all my friends are at school or work...&quot;  Kody thought for a moment, maybe it was his mom coming back to complain about how he had dropped out of high school and refused to go back in for his degree... well dropped out was the wrong word,  Expelled fitted the bill more even though he technically wasn't forced out.  He had been caught having a little 'fun' with the principles daughter, and being the silver tongued devil he is he managed to get off completely free.  However the principle made sure to make the rest of his time there a living hell so naturally after getting annoyed he had left the school to get away from it.<br />
<br />
The doorbell rang a third time... somehow it sounded louder<br />
<br />
&quot;Hold on a minute!&quot; Kody said turning the water off and wrapping a towel around his waist.  He stormed to the front door of his tiny home (he may of been a dropout but his parents were incredibly wealthy).<br />
&quot;What the hell is so impor-&quot; he opens the door prepared to yell at whoever was outside when he saw nothing.  No one was anywhere near the door, and no cars were hurrying off.  Looking down Kody picked up a small package labeled 'Chronivac'.<br />
&quot;A vacume? I didn't order a vacume...&quot; Walking back inside he locks the door behind him and opens up the package.<br />
<br />
Kody reached in and pulled out a bubble wrapped covered parcel.  Tearing off the bubble wrap kody found inside; A mini CD attached to a tiny laptop that was almost small enough to be a cell phone, a what looked like a remote with a keyboard on it, and a long retractable wire meant for connecting the two.<br />
<br />
Kody skimmed the instructions and quickly turned on the mini laptop and inserted the CD.   The computer instantly went into a load screen with the words 'Loading Chronivac 4.0' on it.  He waited a minute for it to load.  Tired of watching the screen Kody looked at the remote that came with it.   It looked expensive it has a illuminated screen on the end, and several keys meant for navigating whatever appeared on that screen. Finding the front he saw what looked like a tiny camera at the end of it.<br />
<br />
The mini-laptop finished loading, and Kody resumed playing with it.  after clicking two license agreement pages the words 'No scanned people' appeared in bold letters on the screen.  Kody thinks for a moment then looks back at the remote... &quot;Maybe its a scanner...&quot; he says picking it back up pressing the power button.   a similar image showed up on the screen saying 'No scanned people/Please scan at least one person before you can proceed'<br />
&quot;Well lets fix that then&quot; Kody says pointing the remote at himself and pressing the big red scan button.<br />
<br />
The remotes screen lit up with all kinds of words and numbers, but Kody paid little attention to it as he looked back at the laptop.<br />
&quot;What I just scanned myself!&quot; Kody shouts before remembering the cord to connect the two electronics.<br />
&quot;I'm a idiot.. .I really should read the instructions of these kind of things every once in a while&quot; he says plugging the cord in.<br />
<br />
The laptop suddenly starts to buzz and light up, and Kody leans expectantly at the screen.  A loading bar quickly fills up and a picture of a naked guy appears on the screen.<br />
&quot;What the hell?&quot; Kody says turning his head not to look at it.  Eventually Kody looks back at the image &quot;Wait a minute... thats me!&quot; he say realizing that the naked guy on the screen was in fact him.   It was like someone had taken a picture of him completely naked in anatomical position standing next to a white wall.<br />
<br />
Kody stared at the screen &quot;shit... it even rotates...&quot; he says finding a rotating feature next to the picture.  Kody stairs at the screen looking at his naked body for a while before spotting the help button.<br />
<br />
A tiny help window appeared 'Welcome to Chronivac the new age life changer'<br />
&quot;Life changer?&quot; Kody says clicking next 'since you have made it to this window you have probably figured out how to scan people.  Note that the scanner does not have to be attached in order to scan and that several life changing option are available directly on the remote, but not all'<br />
<br />
Kody stared at the screen (Is it saying what I think its saying?) Kody thought clicking next.<br />
'There are too main tabs that will open up several other tabs.  The first tab shown here is the [Mind] tab click it now.'<br />
<br />
Kody clicked the tab which expanded showing several newer tabs labeled from accents to sexual preference. 'Feel free to explore these tabs, but do not alter till we get to that part of the tutorial'  Kody clicked a few tabs and looked at what each said before clicking next.<br />
<br />
'Now click the [Body] tab.' Kody clicked on the body tab that had another set of tabs appear this time showing options based on different sections of the body 'Note that gender related areas have been given their own tabs due to some confusion in the previous versions.  Now please pick one area you would like to change in either section.'<br />
<br />
Kody stared for a minute, it was so unbelievable he had a program that actually changed people!  Kody quickly clicked the tab any red blooded American teenager would pick, and clicked into the gender specific tab.<br />
'You have picked the [Male reproductive organs] tab.  As you can see several boxes have appeared with different descriptions next to each box.   Go ahead and alter these boxes then click next'<br />
<br />
Kody quickly added a foot to his current length, then clicked next he was getting hard just waiting to see what would happen.<br />
'This next window lets you decide on how you want the changes to occur.  Check what awareness option you want for this change'<br />
<br />
Kody looked at the screen there were several boxes you could check under awareness.   Kody checked the self aware box and hit next on the help tab.<br />
'Good you have chosen self aware so only you will notice any changes.  Now choose a timer option.'  Kody looked at the screen again, highlighted on the screen were several lines of boxes and words<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok... change will occur over... hmmm ... one minute.  And it will last... hmmm hard decision... forever&quot; Kody says clicking finished on the screen.<br />
<br />
Kody stood up waiting for the changes to come as it counted down on the screen.  Kody suddenly felt a rushing sensation as he watched the bulge under his towel slowly creep down, almost all the way down his thigh. the words 'transformation complete' flashed on the screen.<br />
<br />
&quot;Holy shit it works!&quot; Kody says feeling himself get hard his towel started to lift.  Kody quickly pulled out the manual and began reading.<br />
There was a lot of useless information in it but he found the part he was looking for... &quot;For quick changes type the command into the remote after scanning and it will change the scanned individual based on what you wrote &lt;Warning! this option is extremely experimental and may cause changes that the computer version can't produce or reverse!&gt;<br />
<br />
Kody suddenly grew distracted as his erection intensified making a obscene tent in his towel.  Kody could barely keep himself from jacking off right then when he heard the door open...</p>
