<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The divine being who still thought of herself as Dr. Mark Rogers reclined on the immense round bed she had willed into being. The catgirl who had formerly been her graduate student Kevin dozed with her head on her goddess’ thigh, purring contentedly.  Kevin was utterly spent after multiple rounds of sex.  The former Evangelical Christian had never even masturbated before today, but she had become an expert in giving pleasure to a woman, because her goddess had willed it to be so. Her goddess had also refreshed the two of them to enable a vigorous twelve hour session and was tempted to do it again, but Kevin seemed so peaceful and happy that she decided to let her rest.<br />
<br />
Instead, she let her mind drift to check in on her three other followers. Hannah had become the center of attention in one of the busiest public places of the world. She was surrounded by all manner of formerly mythical creatures who seemed to have started a spontaneous orgy in public. Mark smiled at the sight of a dozen police officers trying to break up the tangle of sexy flesh while Hannah just added more and more participants to the mix.  Somehow, Mark felt energized as more followers were added to the mix. Her already near-infinite power seemed to scale up to the degree that Mark had to invent new branches of mathematics to calculate her potential.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Melissa and John were busy figuring out new ways for elf-on-centaur sex to take place.  Mark was impressed by their creativity and touched by the genuine affection the two showed each other.  She would not have guessed that John would adapt to being a centauress so well.  She decided to reward the two of them with increased sensitivity and more powerful orgasms. She could also sense the gist of the conversation the two of them had earlier.  They had been fair, and Mark was pleased with the outcome. But most of all, she had to admit they had a pretty good understanding of her motives.<br />
<br />
She rubbed the exhausted catgirl behind the ears, and Kevin squirmed in delight. In a quiet voice, she said “Kevin, you are going to awaken fully refreshed. But your libido will return to what it was before I ascended, and I will remove all mental changes that took place when I made you a disciple. You will have full memories of all that transpired since I changed you. For all intents and purposes, you will become Kevin Lacey again, albeit in your more pleasing catgirl body. Now awaken.”<br />
<br />
Kevin’s eyes went wide and she sat up in alarm. The mix and intensity of emotions that radiated off of her caught even the goddess off guard.<br />
<br />
“I’m sorry,” Mark apologized.  “I should not have hit you with everything all at once. I apologize for the stress I caused you.”<br />
<br />
Kevin cleared her head, and her ears twitched as she regained control of her consciousness.  “No.  I’m OK. But that was…that was…” She looked around, realizing that the two of them were naked. Then she remembered the marathon session of lovemaking between them that had concluded just moments before. “I really changed, didn’t I?”<br />
<br />
“That’s what I wanted to talk with you about. No divine powers, no mind control. Just professor and student, talking about the future. How are you feeling? About me, about who you are now, everything.”<br />
<br />
“I have so many questions,”  Kevin said. She pulled the sheet over her torso, giving her some modest coverage.  “What was Christianity? Is god a being like you have become?  Are any religions true? I know those are big questions to lead off with, but they’re really important to how I answer your other questions.”<br />
<br />
“Fair enough,” Mark said. “I don’t have any specific memories from the earliest times, but I think I have a good sense of the truth of the matter.  I’ll answer your second question first: the creators of your universe were indeed beings such as I am. They brought all living things into existence, but then they warred against each other before mankind was out of his infancy. A goddess was cast down and imprisoned, and a god grew bored and left his creation behind.  Later generations half-remembered the cosmic war, and they built stories to explain their origin and their moral purpose. All religions, including your version of Christianity, are the product of the memory of those earliest days.”<br />
<br />
Kevin looked downcast. “So we were wrong,” she said. “We were wrong to think we held the only truth. We were wrong to attack others for believing other than we did.”<br />
<br />
“And now that you have had a new truth revealed, how do you feel about me?”  Mark’s glass of barolo was back. Divinity had not erased her taste for fine wine.<br />
<br />
Kevin bit her lip. Like John had deduced, it made no sense to lie to a being who was omniscient. “It’s hard, isn’t it? I can’t just shake off everything I believed as a youth, but I can’t deny that I’m sitting here having a conversation with a being who is capable of every power I attributed to God. Earlier I made the decision to fight against you. Part of me still wants to do that.”<br />
<br />
Mark took the revelation in stride. “I see what you mean. I can hardly understand everything that has happened, and I have access to all of the knowledge of the universe.  So stop trying to understand. Tell me what you’re feeling.”<br />
<br />
“Don’t you already know?”<br />
<br />
Mark chuckled as she took a sip. “I choose not to. Can the Goddess allow free will to shape a thought she cannot see? I guess the answer is yes. And I know the answer to the question I posed is not simple. Take your time.”<br />
<br />
“I don’t need time,” Kevin said. “Honestly, I like you better as an omnipotent being than I liked you as a professor. I know that you made jokes with the students about my…rigidity about many things.  And the old you wouldn’t have given a crap about how I was feeling about the whole situation. You’re definitely not the man I would have chosen as God’s replacement. But you’re not the worst, either.”<br />
<br />
<br />
“Uh, thanks?” They shared an honest smile.  “So how do you feel about all of this, now that I’ve freed you from the burden of sin?” She indicated Kevin’s feline and feminine body. <br />
<br />
“Don’t think I don’t feel guilty about what we did,” Kevin said. “Old ideas are hard to shake, and we hit the trifecta of fornication, sodomy, and blasphemy.” Mark started to say something but Kevin cut her off. “But all told, I really liked it. You didn’t force me into it, did you? You just suppressed my guilt and fear and let me make the choice. And I’d choose to do it again.  If you are God…I mean <i>really </i> God…then you have the ability to return us to the Garden. A world without sin, where we all lived in peace and harmony. That’s something worth fighting for.”<br />
<br />
“Let’s be real,” Mark said. “It would be a fight. People would have to give up a lot to join an earthly paradise, and the people currently in power would lose most of all.”<br />
<br />
“Couldn’t you just snap your fingers and make it happen, like you did with me?”<br />
<br />
“There’s no good way to get there,” Mark said. “I could make it happen and become a sexy demon-girl tyrant over all of creation, or I could try to win souls the hard way, leading to inevitable conflict.”<br />
<br />
“Well, I support you. My Goddess.”<br />
<br />
Mark smiled. “Thank you, Kevin. That means a lot. WOuld you like me to restore your old form?”<br />
<br />
Kevin blushed. “Um, if it’s all the same…”<br />
<br />
“I get it,” Mark laughed.<br />
<br />
“And could you remove my fear and guilt again, please?”<br />
<br />
Mark turned serious. “Are you sure? I’ve just resolved to allow free will.”<br />
<br />
“You have no idea what it was like. I was happy. Really happy, like my fellow Christians always pretended to be.  I felt love, true love, for you and for everyone.  Let me feel that again. Let me feel that forever.”<br />
<br />
“You sweet thing, “ Mark said, embracing the catgirl with both arms and wings. “I give you my blessing. And I would like to remind you that we have almost twelve hours before the others come back.<br />
<br />
From underneath the wings, Kevin could be heard giggling.</p>
