<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ty woke up before the alarm, and went to the bathroom. He came back, and Lisa was already up. She had merged, and was in her human/aquarium form. &quot;One more me to merge,&quot; she said, and Ty felt a tiny change in his cock. &quot;All of myselves really enjoyed last night!&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
&quot;As did I,&quot; Ty said, and kissed her, before she went to the bathroom. After she did her business, she called him. &quot;Join me in the shower?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Certainly,&quot; he said, and happily did just that. Sex in the shower was one of Ty&#39;s favorite things. Well, any sex with Lisa was his favorite, really.<br />
<br />
They got dressed, Ty in his normal school clothes, and Lisa in a new pair of shorts and bikini top Ty created for her. They went downstairs, and found Maria and Diego in the kitchen. &quot;Good morning,&quot; Lisa and Ty said nearly simultaneously. Maria and Diego greeted them.<br />
<br />
&quot;I haven&#39;t cooked anything for breakfast,&quot; Maria said. &quot;Diego and I just had cereal, fruit, and toast. But I&#39;d be happy to cook something now, if you like.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you, Maria,&quot; Ty said, &quot;but unless Lisa prefers something else, I&#39;m fine with the same thing you had..&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That suits me too,&quot; Lisa said, and started preparing it. Ty whispered something to her, and she nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maria, Diego, I&#39;d like to offer something to you,&quot; Ty said. &quot;Something I could do for you with my powers. I want you to know up front that my suggesting this doesn&#39;t in any way mean that I think it&#39;s something you _need_. But it&#39;s something I did for both of my parents, and they both liked it a lot. Especially June!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ve got me intrigued,&quot; Diego said. &quot;Please tell us more.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;As you know, I&#39;m not keen on magic,&quot; Maria said, &quot;but I&#39;ll try to keep an open mind as you explain.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty explained to them, as he&#39;d just the day before explained to Lisa, about June&#39;s request for her hair color, and Mark&#39;s request for both his hair color and receding hairline. He told them about the little (or maybe not so little) _extra_ he had given each of them along with their requested changes.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s an amazing offer, Ty, and thank you for making it,&quot; Diego said. &quot;You don&#39;t need an answer from us immediately, do you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; Ty said. &quot;There&#39;s no rush whatsoever. Any time that you&#39;d like that, or other changes, just let me know, and I&#39;ll be happy to do them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you, Ty,&quot; Maria said. &quot;Diego and I will discuss your offer later, and get back to you. Oh, and remember that we will have tacos as usual tonight, if you care to join us.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, please,&quot; Ty said. &quot;You know how much I love your tacos!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Invite your family to join us, if they like,&quot; Maria said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know if they have plans, but I&#39;ll find out,&quot; Ty replied. &quot;If they don&#39;t, I&#39;m sure they&#39;d be happy to join you. Us.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you two have planned for after school?&quot; Diego asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t think we have any big plans,&quot; Ty said. &quot;But if my brother Dustin isn&#39;t busy, I&#39;ve offered to help him get a car.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Um, help him how?&quot; Maria asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I told him that if he wanted, and our parents approved, I could use my powers to get a car for him. I&#39;ve used my powers to get little things for my family, like when June accidentally forgot to buy orange juice, but this is the first time I&#39;ve offered to use them for something big. Dustin and my parents were very surprised, but my parents approved it, as long as Dustin gets a practical car, rather than a sports car or something flashy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s amazing, Ty,&quot; Diego said, &quot;and it&#39;s very generous of you to offer Dustin such a huge favor. Although I suppose, if you&#39;re able to create a giant space station orbiting Jupiter, maybe this is no big deal to you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I wouldn&#39;t say that it&#39;s no big deal,&quot; Ty said, &quot;although it&#39;s true that it shouldn&#39;t be difficult for me. But it&#39;s a big deal in that it helps Dustin out a lot. He wasn&#39;t expecting to get a car any time soon.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Has he picked out what kind of car he wants?&quot; Maria asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;He said that one of his friends has a Passport crossover that he likes,&quot; Ty said. &quot;I&#39;ll have to coordinate with him on the details of what he wants. And while I am mostly doing it for Dustin&#39;s benefit, I have to admit that it will benefit me as well. Dustin says that he&#39;ll be happy to give me a ride whenever he&#39;s not busy. We&#39;ll still take the bus to school, because they only allow seniors to park at school, but when I have other places to go, he said that he&#39;d like to drive me. I think he just likes driving, and welcomes any excuse to do more of it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty whispered something else to Lisa, and she nodded again.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wasn&#39;t planning to bring this up just yet, but since we&#39;re talking, I&#39;ve got two more suggestions I&#39;d like to offer, subject to your approval. Both relate to the fact that Lisa has her driver&#39;s license, but doesn&#39;t yet have a car of her own yet. The first idea I had, and got my parents to approve provided that you do as well, is that...&quot; he paused and cleared his throat. &quot;On a weekend, maybe this coming one or a future one, I&#39;d like to transform myself into a car for Lisa to drive.&quot;<br />
<br />
There was shocked silence from Maria and Diego. &quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; said Maria. &quot;That seems...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s not make any hasty decision,&quot; Diego said to Maria. &quot;I think this is another thing we should discuss.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re right,&quot; Maria said. &quot;We&#39;ll have to get back to you on that, as well. And what was the other suggestion?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, this one isn&#39;t quite as extraordinary as the previous one. The idea of my transforming into a car was just motivated by the idea that we&#39;d find it fun. But in more practical terms, if I can get a car for Dustin, I obviously could get one for Lisa as well. Just to be clear, I&#39;m only trying to be helpful. If you have other plans, or don&#39;t want her to have a car yet, I&#39;ll understand.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We really hadn&#39;t even discussed Lisa getting a car,&quot; Maria said.<br />
<br />
&quot;She hasn&#39;t asked us for one,&quot; Diego said, &quot;so I assumed that it wasn&#39;t a huge priority for her. And as you said, she wouldn&#39;t yet be able to drive to school. But I don&#39;t think we&#39;re opposed to it.&quot; He looked to Maria, who nodded in agreement. &quot;Lisa, if you&#39;re not in a hurry on that, let&#39;s wait and see how things go with Dustin&#39;s car.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s fine, Dad,&quot; Lisa said. &quot;You&#39;re right that it hasn&#39;t really been a priority for me, though I&#39;d certainly like to get one eventually. And I know you&#39;d help me get one when the time comes, but Ty&#39;s offer could get me a car sooner, and save you money. I agree that we can wait and make sure things go well with Dustin&#39;s car first. But in the mean time, do please let me know what you decide about Ty&#39;s other proposal. I think it would be amazing to drive _him_ around.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, we&#39;ll discuss these things, and let you know,&quot; Maria said.<br />
<br />
Lisa and Ty finished their cereal, and cleaned up after themselves. &quot;We have to finish getting ready for school,&quot; Lisa said. &quot;We&#39;ll be back in a few minutes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Remember to change yourself back to, um, normal.&quot; Maria reminded her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course, Mom,&quot; Lisa said, and she and Ty headed back to her bedroom.</p>
