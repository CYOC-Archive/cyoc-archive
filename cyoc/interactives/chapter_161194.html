<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><br />
Cris wasn&#39;t doing so well in his orange jumpsuit and chained hands. He couldn&#39;t believe he was in jail. Everyone in jail was so creepy! He was only 18 years old! He shouldn&#39;t even be here! <br />
<br />
All it took was one party. He had too many beers. He wasn&#39;t even speeding on the way home. Just minding his own business! When out of nowhere this old man had appeared right before him, going way too fast! Old man couldn&#39;t even see that well. Had all these disabilities. Who the hell thought that old man wasn&#39;t at fault? Cris paced back and forth in his cell, furious at his predicament.<br />
<br />
His parents hired a good attorney. The old man was obviously at fault but he was really trying to earn the court&#39;s sympathy by talking about all the pain he was in. All the pain HE was in? What about me? Cris thought. I&#39;m going through way more than he is! Everyone thinks I was driving drunk! I totally knew what I was doing! This guy was at fault, not me! He was the one who came right at me! Stupid old man wasn&#39;t looking where he was going at all! <br />
<br />
Cris sweated his way through the proceedings. When he was questioned, the prosecutor asked if Mr. Cris Herman  had been keeping an eye out, looking both right and left at all times. How often did he look to his left and right? Why was this guy asking him that? &quot;I dunno, the usual amount, I guess,&quot; he had stated.<br />
<br />
They looked the angle of the impact of both cars. It was determined that Mr. Herman had not looked carefully enough at the parking lot on his right hand side and that the impact could have been avoided. Cris balked. How was that possible?? The car shot ahead out of nowhere! The old man had FLOORED into him. <br />
<br />
Furthermore, it was determined that Mr. Herman had been intoxicated at the scene of the crime. <br />
<br />
When Mr. Thaler made his testimony, he made it clear that Mr. Herman had slowed down significantly when he approached the supermarket parking lot Mr. Thaler was exiting and so he thought he was being given the right of way. It was Mr. Herman who had sideswiped him, he argued. <br />
<br />
But I saved us both by swerving when you pulled out in front of me, you old bastard! Cris thought.<br />
<br />
The court was ready to make its decision. <br />
<br />
&quot;Mr. Herman. Please rise.&quot; <br />
<br />
Cris Herman stood up, his knees shaking. <br />
<br />
&quot;Mr. Herman, I find you are not a bad student. I looked at your records. But...it does worry me that alcohol was involved. I have come to the conclusion that you were at fault for this accident.&quot; <br />
<br />
Cris felt his heart drop. <br />
<br />
&quot;Therefore, due to Mr. Thaler&#39;s injuries and taking into account the cost of his brand new Mercedes, I hereby sentence you to accept a body swap in lieu of your previously stated inability to pay damages. Body swap will commence within 24 hours. This sentence will be carried out over the court of the next five years, by which time you will be remitted a new body should your own not be returned to you for any reason,&quot; Judge Loggia continued. <br />
<br />
And that could be because an old body dies, Cris thought. I don&#39;t want to be some old dude! <br />
<br />
He looked in horror at the 81 year old, grinning in his gray suit like he&#39;d just won the lottery. White hair the color of an angora cat and big fat spectacles like the old dude from Up! He had a big smile plastered on his old, withered face. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh god, I don&#39;t want to be an old man! There has to be a mistake. Is there anything ELSE I can give him?&quot; Cris burst out, about to cry. He would rather die than live as an old man! <br />
<br />
&quot;Mr. Herman, we&#39;ve been over this,&quot; Judge Loggie warned. &quot;This is my final verdict. Now, if you&#39;re worried about your own health deteriorating while you are in that body, we have given Mr. Thaler a full medical screening. His injuries are not life threatening, merely painful. You will be given a full rundown of the medications you will have to take from now on in order to keep your new body functioning. We also have counseling available to help either one of you make the transition to life in your new frames. Now, let&#39;s move on to the next case...&quot; <br />
<br />
Cris felt himself near tears as he was led out of the room...<br />
<br />
His parents were crestfallen and silent. As they drove home, you could hear a pin drop. When he got home, it was already all over his social media. Everyone at school was going to know pretty soon, he thought glumly. He begged his parents to let him drop out of school and his father lost it, calling him a loser and a leech and screaming that he&#39;d thrown his life away. His mother tried to calm him down. Cris ran to his room and cried. He was so beautiful. One of the hottest guys in his class. Nothing gave him more pleasure than people looking at him in wonder and awe. <br />
<br />
Cris looked like he could be a Disney actor. Gorgeous slim eyes and chestnut hair, thick in the front, and looks that could kill from a mile away. He just had the hint of facial hair coming in with his sideburns in a way that drove women wild. Just one smile melted their hearts. He used his looks to get by wherever he went. Stores to get a little extra help from the saleswomen. Or standing in line, giving a wink to just the right girl. They always smiled at him and his charm, his looks. All of it would be gone...<br />
<br />
And now they were going to look at him with absolute disgust. They would laugh. Oh god it would be so horrible. Being forced to go to school as an old man! An 81 year old man! <br />
<br />
He cried into his pillow and fell asleep. <br />
<br />
The next day dawned. His last day as an 18 year old. He got washed up. He looked at his nice, firm 8 inch cock. It was such a beautiful and hard fuckstick. He&#39;d only lost his virginity about five months ago with Jen Rogers and now she wasn&#39;t talking to him. They had dated for only a few months. He missed her so much but there were other girls. Julie asked if he had a large cock and said she was adventurous. They had a lot of fun for about two weeks. But she was real wild and wanted to party with cocaine. Cris had politely turned her down. And then dated Wendy, the Chinese American cheerleader with the hottest face ever. And she was the hottest in bed out of all of them. She was dirty and liked to be his little &quot;slave&quot; girl, dressing like a maid and cleaning the house with a feather duster. Cris couldn&#39;t forget how hot that was...taking her in that little uniform and fucking her in her parents living room while they were at some fancy gala. <br />
<br />
Who would want him now? he cried to himself. When his cock was shrunken and...oh god he didn&#39;t even want to think about it! <br />
<br />
The rest of the day became a blur. The drive to the hospital...getting prepped by the doctors, getting through the decontamination sprays...lying down on what looked like a cat scan machine....only it sealed up after he was in there. There were so many lights and sounds and a high beeping...he fell asleep.<br />
<br />
The light. <br />
<br />
And then he was groggy. His head hurt. There was a light above. He almost made out someone saying something with his name. He moaned. <br />
<br />
&quot;He&#39;s waking up,&quot; one of the techs said.</p>
