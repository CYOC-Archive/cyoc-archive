<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Ok, fine. Gimme the dice.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sue was a bit of an outlier at the sorority. She enjoyed wearing darker clothing with oscure band logos and had a plethora of piercings. She had only applied for the sorority as a joke but the sorority council had accepted her in an effort to appear more diverse. She still hated most of the &quot;pink sluts&quot;, as she liked to call them, but she disliked Diane, Jerri, Joy and Cyndi the least.<br />
<br />
Her piece moved along the board once the dice had settled, stopping on another blue square. Sue picked up a card.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your piercings are your pride and joy. So, the more the merrier?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm, that&#39;s weird. What, am I supposed to go get more piercings done or something?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t think that&#39;s what it meant Sue.&quot; Jerri answered. &quot;Check out your ears!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wha-&quot;<br />
<br />
Reaching up Sue could feel her ears growing longer! But as they doubled in size they suddenly split into another pair of ears, just behind the first! The new ears were still folded over though, connected to her old ears by the piercings they now shared. Then, with a loud *ping*, the piercings split apart like magician&#39;s rings, leaving identical piercings along both sets of ears!<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoa, well that&#39;s weird!&quot; Cyndi gasped, looking at Sue&#39;s 4 ears.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, well I don&#39;t think it&#39;s over yet.&quot; Sue could feel more buzzing around her body, focusing on her piercings.<br />
<br />
Her eyebrows were next, thickening and splitting as the piercings split with another *ping*. Her nose quickly followed, widening before splitting down the middle as her septum piercings split apart.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sue, do you feel ok? Does it hurt?&quot; Diane asked.<br />
<br />
Sue shook her head. &quot;No, it just feel really freaky! Like my noth ith flilthhh... Blahhh!&quot;<br />
<br />
As she tried to answer her mouth suddenly wouldn&#39;t cooperate as it filled with something long and slimy. Opening her mouth her tongue flopped out, now over a foot long with 3 more piercings to join the first!<br />
<br />
&quot;Holmy thhhit!!&quot;<br />
<br />
But more buzzing further down caught her attention. Sue braced herself, knowing what was about to happen.<br />
<br />
The other girls watched with morbid curiosity as Sue grabbed at her shirt. By the time she got it up over her head, her breasts were straining against her c-cup bra. She quickly unclasped the black and red garment and breathed a sigh of relief as her breasts fell free.<br />
<br />
They had gotten bigger, but not in the way Cyndi&#39;s had. Instead they seemed to have grown wider, their edges nearly under her arm pits. The pink areola had gotten much wider too, nearly 4 inches across now. Sue shivered as lines formed down the middle of her much wider breasts, the lines then becoming small gaps, and the gaps becoming new cleavages! She soon had 4 breasts lining her chest, connected at the nipples by their hoop piercings!<br />
<br />
Then, with another loud *ping*, the hoops split apart and her 4 breasts swung free, rubbing against one another as they swayed back and forth. Sue marveled at the new tits, tracing the star tattoos that had been copied perfectly from her original pair onto her outer pair.<br />
<br />
Then she looked up and saw the other girls gawking at her. &quot;Whath? You&#39;th nether theen another gal&#39;th booths bethore?&quot; She chuckled, about to put her shirt back on.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, it&#39;s more like we haven&#39;t seen a gal with more than 2 boobs before.&quot; Diane corrected.<br />
<br />
&quot;And I don&#39;t think you&#39;re done yet Sue... Look!&quot; Cyndi pointed.<br />
<br />
Sue looked and sure enough her breasts were starting to spread again!<br />
<br />
&quot;Holmy thit. Whath the thuck!!&quot;<br />
<br />
This time all four breasts were spreading vertically, but they seemed to go much further than when they had spread horizontally! Sue found herself being forced to hunch over as they crept further down her body but the skin remained too tight for her to stand. Before long they had spread all the way down to her jeans with the stretched areola set somewhere in the middle.<br />
<br />
Then the lines appeared again, 3 of them along each breast this time, slowly turning into gaps, then separating the long mounds entirely into rows of separate breasts! But Sue was still forced into a hunched position as each column of breasts were connected by a single hoop through their nipples. Then a series loud pings filled the air like a machine gun!<br />
<br />
&quot;Oooooooothhh!&quot; Sue grunted as she was finally able to stand, all 16 breasts swaying and bouncing together as she found her ballance.<br />
<br />
&quot;Holmy... thhhhit...&quot; was all Sue could manage as she looked down at her rows and rows of symetrical tits.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow. Just, wow...&quot; Cyndi stammered. &quot;And I though my boobs were a problem!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Who thaid anythink aboth a pwolem?&quot; Sue smirked back as she stroked a few of her outer breasts.<br />
<br />
&quot;What??&quot; Diane sputtered in disbelief. &quot;You can&#39;t honestly be enjoying that are you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wew, let&#39;th jutht thay I&#39;m noth oppothed to thhe benefithts.&quot; Sue smiled as she reached for her shirt. But as she did her face suddenly turned red.<br />
<br />
&quot;What, enjoying your &#39;benefits&#39; over there?&quot; Jerri asked sarcastically.<br />
<br />
Sue shook her head, standing perfectly still as she closed her eyes. Then slowly nodded. &quot;Othew benefithts.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sue moaned as whatever was going on held her motionless. Several moments passed before a series of muffled pings interrupted the silence. Sue&#39;s face turned into a sheepish grin as she let out a long sigh.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, what was that Sue?&quot; Diane asked, confused.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t athk.&quot; She groaned as she picked up her shirt and pulled it down as far as it would go.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know what that was!&quot; Cyndi was smiling devilishly. &quot;Any other piercings you&#39;d like to tell us about Sue?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I pwead thhe fifthh!&quot; Sue replied in jest, sitting gingerly back down at the table.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, now with that over, can we please continue?&quot; Diane asked. &quot;We have to finish this if were ever going to get back to normal. Jerri? It&#39;s your turn.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, ok. Well as long as nothing THAT intense happens to me.&quot; Jerri smiled. &quot;I&#39;ll take a lion tail over infinite breasts thank you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Then another muffled *ping* filled the air.<br />
<br />
Cyndi looked at Sue. &quot;Really?&quot;<br />
<br />
Sue shook her head. &quot;Wathn&#39;t me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, guys...&quot;<br />
<br />
Joy, who had been sitting quietly through all the commotion, now chimed in. &quot;Uh... I think I know what my card meant!&quot;<br />
<br />
The girls all turned towards Joy to find her with her eyes closed and gripping the sides of the pillow she was sitting on. She quickly undid her bra and pulled it out of her thin green top. The others could easily see the outline of her moderate bust through the tight shirt, and were surprized to see an extra lump between her breasts. It could only be one thing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Joy, is that a-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mm hmm!&quot; Joy interrupted.<br />
<br />
As they watched, the three mounds grew longer, reaching the bottom of her ribs. After a few moments they heard a few more muffled pings and Joy exhaled, opening her eyes. She blushed as she realised the other girls were staring at her.<br />
<br />
&quot;You ok over there?&quot; Jerri asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mm hmm.&quot; Joy replied, looking down at her 6 breasts. &quot;No really, I am. Can we just keep going?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok, if you say so.&quot; Jerri rattled the dice in her hand. But as she rolled them across the board, several more muffled pings joined in the rattle of the dice.<br />
<br />
&quot;I thought you said you were fine!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I ah- I am now? Just pick up your card please!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okaaaay.&quot; Jerri reached for the deck.<br />
<br />
Satisfied no one was looking, Joy took a quick peek down her pants. Her face turned bright red as she saw 4 pussies staring back up at her, barbell piercings through each little clit!<br />
<br />
She closed her legs and quickly looked up again, only to find Sue staring back at her, smiling.</p>
