<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Ugh,” Jackie groaned. “What am I doing here?” Jackie bit her lip as she gazed around the dance hall. Things were beginning to get out of control. Jackie and the others hadn’t realized that the newly regressed seniors would party so hard. As she gazed around she noticed a group dancing wildly, swinging their partners around at speeds she had not anticipated. As she looked over at her friends she could see that they appeared in over their heads as well.<br />
<br />
Diane and Naomi were happily chatting with another lesbian couple. While the two grown up teens seemed happy, Jackie had experienced adulthood enough to notice the couple seemed to be propositioning the two inexperienced girls into joining them in their room. The young couple, while physically mature, had zero experience dealing with other adults in regards to relationships. It appeared now that the recently regressed couple were swingers back in there day and wished to bring Naomi and Diane in on the action.<br />
<br />
Felicia was fairing no better as the woman she was speaking with was now asking if Felicia had a picture of her boyfriend. Felicia for her part was dong her best to try and change the subject, however the woman was quite persistent. Felicia quickly made eye contact with Jackie trying to convey a silent message to Jackie, she was running out of excuses and the woman’s persistence was wearing her down. There was no way Felicia  could show this woman a picture of Adam. If she couldn’t produce a picture then Jackie could see that the woman wanted to introduce Felicia to a friend of hers.<br />
<br />
Finally Jackie gazed at Sasha and Gloria before shaking her head. The two girls were extremely inebriated at this point, practically falling over as they laughed and talked. Their behavior though was drawing attention. Jackie could see a group of men now approaching Gloria and Sasha. The guys were smirking, talking quietly with one another. Jackie could see that they now saw the two drunk women as easy targets. They would try and talk the two of them into going back to their rooms. Gloria and Sasha were both drunk enough that it probably would take much convincing but what then? If the two girls felt threatened, would they use their rings to defend themselves? <br />
<br />
“I have to get Katie and Kellie now,” Jackie stated as she quickly made her way out of the dance hall.<br />
<br />
***************************************************<br />
<br />
Katie smiled as she rubbed her foot along Kellies leg. The two lovers now lay in bed, enjoying a bag of popcorn as they watched a movie in their hotel room. “So is this better than the playroom,” she said softly. Kellie smiled, nodding as she gently kissed her fiancé cheek. “Yeah and better than the dance,” she said softly. “The whole party scene is kind of worn out at this point.”<br />
<br />
“Mika and Claudia would love it though,” Kellie chuckled as she ran her hand along Katie’s thigh. Katie could only laugh, shaking her head as she turned towards Kellie. “Not anymore,” she said. “Talked with them the other day. They’ve gone full mom mode with Kari, Claudia was telling me Mika’s trying to teach her Japanese and English at the same time.”<br />
<br />
Kellie could only laugh as she now lovingly gazed at Katie. Smiling, she now ran a hand along Katie’s leg, moving her dress up slightly as her hand drifted closer to her groin. Exhaling she now placed a passionate kiss on Katie as she pulled her on top of her. “Well we don’t have to worry about a baby tonight,” she purred. “How about you and me have some adult time?” Katie smiled, slowly lowering herself down as she began to inch Kellies dress further and further up her legs.<br />
<br />
“Oh god she’s coming!”<br />
<br />
“Already,” Katie questioned. “I haven’t even done anything yet.”<br />
<br />
“No not that,” Kellie grumbled. “Jackie, she heading towards the playroom. We have to get down there before she realizes we left.” Katie exhaled in disgust as she turned towards where Kellie was pointing. Kellies spell showing the girls was still active, sure enough it now showed Jackie quickly leaving the dance hall. The grown up teen appeared slightly distressed as she now tried to remember where exactly the children’s play area was.<br />
<br />
“Ugh great,” Katie sighed before looking down at her girlfriend. “To be continued.”<br />
<br />
“You better,” Kellie smirked. Katie laughed softly as she now snapped her fingers, causing the two college age women to vanish in a flash of light from their room.<br />
<br />
Jackie burst into the playroom, frantically looking for Katie and Kellie. It appeared most of the kids were gone at this point, which only added to Jackie’s anxiety. “Katie, Kellie where are you,” she said quickly. Glancing towards a large play castle in the back Jackie watched as a 5 year old Katie and Kellie exited the castle. “Hi Dackie,” Katie lisped.<br />
<br />
“Oh thank god,” Jackie sighed. “I was worried you two were gone.”<br />
<br />
“We was playing,” Kellie said happily as she now approached Jackie. Jackie nodded as the two girls now approached. “We’ll play time is over now girls,” she said. “I need your help but first.” Jackie’s ring now began to glow as she made her wish.<br />
<br />
Katie and Kellie now began to grow older once more as Jackie worked her magic. The two tiny 5 year olds now began to grow in size as they aged. By the time the two became 11 Jackie could see them beginning to experience puberty once more. Small bumps became conical breasts that slowly increased in size as they aged into their teens. Katie and Kellie watched with interest as they grew up once more, slowly but surely aging back into young adulthood. As the progression completed Katie and Kellie ran their hands over their bodies, smiling as they returned to their 21 year old selves. “Okay Jackie what’s up,” Katie asked.<br />
<br />
Jackie now explained everything leading up to now. How Gloria and Sasha had gotten really drunk, how the party was getting out of hand, and how Jackie ain’t sure if changing everyone back was a great idea considering how happy everyone seemed to be. “And that’s everything,” Jackie sighed. “I’m not sure what to do. Sasha and Gloria are way too loaded to help and even though everyone seems happy I just don’t know for sure.”<br />
<br />
Katie and Kellie nodded as they looked between themselves and Jackie. “I get it Jackie,” Katie said. “It’s hard especially when you see how happy everyone is, but you have to think about these people’s lives. Making this many changes could really mess up people’s lives. Sure some people might be better off but it’s hard to know for sure.”<br />
<br />
“So how can you tell,” Jackie asked.<br />
<br />
“Well the Ring will kind of guide you,” Kellie said. “When you make a change the ring will help guide you. You can feel it when you’ve made a good change. Have you felt that tonight?”<br />
<br />
“No,” Jackie said quietly. <br />
<br />
“Well that’s a sign then,” Katie said warmly. “So why don’t we change everyone back together.” Jackie nodded as the three of them now went about wishing for everyone to return to their proper ages except for Jackie’s friends. As they felt the magic flow through them they sighed. “Did it work,” Jackie asked. Katie and Kellie now made their way towards the dance hall. Peaking inside the three of them sighed in relief as they noticed the once wild party was now much calmer as the seniors had been returned to their original ages. The confused group of seniors now looked at one another trying to figure out what happened. <br />
<br />
“Hey where are Gloria and the others,” Jackie asked. Almost on que Jackie noticed her friends stumble out of the hotel bar, confused by what had happened. “Hey weren’t we just at a party,” Gloria slurred, wobbling in her heels.<br />
<br />
“Yeah you were,” Kellie said. “But we just changed everything back and transported you five to the bar instead.”<br />
<br />
Gloria and the others nodded as thy gazed around the empty hotel lobby. “Can we call it a night,” Felicia asked. “I think I’ve had enough fun for one night.”<br />
<br />
“Aw Cmon,” Sasha said loudly. “It’s still early..we..we..have *burp* a whole night a head of us.”<br />
<br />
“You can barely stand Sasha,” Diane frowned. “Let’s save it for tomorrow.”<br />
<br />
As Sasha was about to argue, Gloria took that moment to vomit onto the carpet. “I don’t feel good,” she whimpered as she vomited a second time. Gloria’s friends came to their friends aid as Katie and Kellie winced. “Let’s call it a night girls okay,” Katie said. “Why don’t you guys head upstairs and get some rest. I’ll take care of my sister.”<br />
<br />
Despite some protests from Sasha the girls complied, helping their drunk friend into the elevator as Katie and Kellie took hold of Gloria. “So much for alone time,” Kellie grumbled before smiling. “I’ll make it up to you later,” Katie smirked. “Having to cleanup Gloria hear is going to take all night. She definitely owes us a weekend of babysitting Morgan after this.”</p>
