<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">	It had been a little over twenty-four hours and he still wasn’t still sure on a number of things. After he’d transformed into Jason, he couldn’t remember when he’d taken off the cat collar, or if it had broke off at some point during the change. He was unable to recall when he had put on his brother’s clothes, now his, nor how he’d gotten back downstairs, where he waited for Kathy for about a half hour before he shut down the computer, left a note for the teenage girl’s mother, and headed home.<br />
<br />
	When he returned to what had been his former home, and was once again where he lived, he found more changes that went beyond simply him going from being a female cat to a teenage human male. His mother was now a struggling single parent who just barely squeaked by, whilst his father was not in the picture, apparently leaving some time after his only son was born. Whether any of these changes had occurred when he’d become Rune, when the original Jason became Kathy, or because he’d become Jason, he was not sure. Just as he didn’t know if all the use of the medallion had caused something he’d discovered about Jason, or if it was something normal.<br />
<br />
	He’d never really given his brother’s love life much consideration. He’d always thought his brother was a swaggering, foul-mouthed git, often acting like a young version of their father, and that he could have dated any girl he wanted. But now that he was Jason, he found that his brother put on a brash front for all to see, except for the boy he dated. Shocked to learn that Jason was gay, and that he was in a serious relationship with a guy named Devon, he didn’t know how to take this, but thought it might explain some of the way his brother had behaved.<br />
<br />
	“Especially as I can vaguely remember Devon and that the two where always hanging out when I had been Jason’s younger brother,” he thought to himself.<br />
<br />
	Whether any of things were the norm, or if they had been caused because of use of Amulet of Zulo, he wasn’t too certain. On one hand, he wanted to find out. But, on the other hand, he was loth to remain as Jason any longer than he had to. Which left him conflicted on if he was mucking up the older boy’s life somehow, or would do so by what he wanted to do.<br />
<br />
	His plans still hadn’t changed. He wanted to explore his options. And if they didn’t pan out, go back to being a cat, though, now he was unsure whether he wanted to go back being a girl or a boy cat. Taking the necklace out from where he’d hidden it, he bounced it loosely in his hand and thought about his options. Knowing the one thing he didn’t want to be was Jason, he considered that the first thing he should do was to change himself into someone else.<br />
<br />
	But the question he kept asking himself was who. He understood that, if things worked out the way he wanted, he’d eventually try to be a human female, yet felt he wasn’t quite ready to do so. Thinking over what he could do, something he’d been doing for almost the last twelve hours or so, he found himself returning to what he felt was the most logical thing. Wanting to go back to being who’d he’d been before he’d found the medallion, curious to know how much his life might change, he was stumped on how he would do that. Thinking over his options, he finally settled on that, if he wanted to do this, the best way to do that was to find an article of clothing he’d owned.<br />
<br />
	The problem was there were none. Something about the magick that had erased his original human self had also removed all other traces, including anything he might have worn. Even the clothes he’d left behind the shed had disappeared. Frustrated by this, he felt that his only course was to buy something and hope it turned him back into his fifteen-year-old self, which presented another issue.<br />
<br />
	What exactly he’d had worn, he couldn’t recall. Racking his brains in an effort to remember, he decided in the end to guess on his former fashion choices, as well as size. Collecting wallet, and making sure there was enough inside, he headed for the nearest department store. There, he spent an aggravating forty some minutes wandering around the teen section, looking at boy’s clothes, hoping something would jog his memory. Not finding anything, he grabbed a shirt that looked like it had been tossed on a shelf amongst shirts that weren’t the same style. Unfolding it, he saw that it had red three quarter length sleeves and that the main torso section was black, whilst the collar was the same shade of red as the sleeves. Figuring it would do, he checked the price. Finding it within his budget, he folded it back up and, exasperated, headed for the checkout, forgetting to check the size.<br />
<br />
	Back home, he pulled the tags off it and weighed whether he wanted to use the amulet now, or wait a little longer. Knowing there was a chance the Amulet of Zulo could disappear, he felt this was good enough reason to try now, he took it out from where he’d hidden it and touched the two to an exposed part of his skin.<br />
<br />
	And nothing happened. A second attempt revealed the same thing and wondering if he was doing something wrong, he tossed the shirt on his bed, returned the medallion to where he kept it hidden. Figuring there was only one thing he could do, he gave the garment a disparaging look as he left his bedroom, grousing that he’d have to go up to the library, the nearest place he could find a computer with internet.<br />
<br />
	Hours later, and not feeling the greatest, he returned to his room and flopped down on his bed. Absently, he ran a hand through his short hair, laced his fingers behind his head, and stared up the ceiling. From what he could find, the transformation could happen either fast, like his change from Rune to Jason, or slow, something he hoped wouldn’t happen. Turning over on his side, which helped to ease some of the discomfort he felt, something he chalked up to the meal he’d grabbed on the way home, he stared out at his room and listened to the empty house.<br />
<br />
	With mom on the graveyard shift, he had the place to himself. At any other time, he would be take advantage of this and watch what he wanted or, as his memories insisted, invited Devon over. But now, he really didn’t feel like it. The uncomfortable feeling settling in his lower abdomen, down into his groin, upper legs, and up into his chest, he rolled over on his back, stretched, sat up and looked at the shirt he’d left on his bed.<br />
<br />
	Unsure why he had even bought the garment, as it seemed to not worked, and he was still unsure if it was something he would have worn when he was that other person, he felt his mind start to wander. Yawning after a bit, he realised that he’d started to fall asleep and deciding he might go to bed early, he reached for the shirt and stood. Shucking off everything but his underwear, he pulled on the shirt, turned off the bedroom lights and crawled under the covers. Curled up in a semi-fetal position, worried he was sick, he drifted off into an uneasy, dreamless sleep, oblivious to the fact that the necklace’s magick had already start to work and that his bedroom was changing around him.<br />
<br />
	Morning sunlight streamed through curtains that weren’t quite shut all the way and he came awake with a stretch. Feeling better than he’d felt the previous evening, he lay for a moment, snuggled under the soft, thin blanket, trying to decide if he wanted to get up or go back to sleep. A glance at the small table next to his bed and the alarm clock set atop it and he noted the time as a pressure on his bladder insisted that he should get up. Pushing the covers away, missing that they were a kaleidoscope of exploding pastel colours, and that the sheets on his bed were a soft, robin’s egg blue, he stretched and padded across his room, out the door and down the hall toward the bathroom, all the while adjusting how his underwear sat on his hips and covered his backside.<br />
<br />
	Inside the loo he flipped on the light that was above the mirror and started for the toilet, but stopped when he passed the mirror and caught from the corner of his eye his reflection. Backtracking, he peered into the reflective surface and suddenly awake, he found himself at a loss by what he saw.<br />
<br />
	The angular, masculine face of his brother was gone, now replaced by one of a round, young woman’s. His hair was now down to shoulders and looked fuller, silkier. But what really got his attention was how the top part of the shirt he had on was stretched out, with two prominent dimples exposed. Afraid to touch the area, he stared for a moment before, with trembling hand, he reached down, grasped the hem of the garment and pulled it up until the two C cup mounds of flesh were exposed. Staring at his breasts, noting the erect nipples and the pink area around them was larger, he also took in his now pinched waist and flat stomach. Eyesight drifted down from there and he found himself unable to look away from the panties he now had on.<br />
<br />
	Now a cute shade of light, pastel purple, the area in front was flat, whilst the underwear sat low and, in his opinion, barely covered him down there. Turning one way, then another, he examined himself, noting that his hips, thighs, and butt were a more pronounced, and after a moment, let go of the shirt, which stayed up and left his tits still exposed, and with a fumbling hand, pushed down first on the front of the panties, then down on waist band that rode high on his hips. Revealing a small square patch of curly, dark pubic hair that he somehow knew would be soft to the touch, he stared at the small cleft that he could just barely make out through the hair, which he knew left no doubt that his genitals were now betwixt his legs and that he was indeed a girl. Letting go of the panties, which snapped back up, but not quite in place, he looked back at his reflection.<br />
<br />
	Thoughts meandered through his head and for a moment he was unable to form a cohesive thought. Finally settling on, “It was a girl’s shirt,” he let his new memories play out as he came to terms that he was still the same age, twenty, but he was now a young woman.<br />
<br />
	The pressure on his bladder reminded him why he’d come into the bathroom in the first place and with a sharp tug, he pulled the shirt back down before he turned to the toilet. Sitting down to do his business, he found it didn’t phase him when he pissed from an area of his body he couldn’t see. “Unless I use a mirror to look down there,” he thought to himself as he recalled having done so. Reaching for some toilet paper when he finished, he started to wipe himself front to back, whilst he thought that, on one hand, he was glad not to be Jason any longer, but, on the other hand, he hadn’t wanted to be a girl just yet, let alone one who was five years older than his original age.<br />
<br />
	Conflicted about what he should do, he stood, pulled up his panties and figured, “I’ll just have to deal with it,” as he flushed, knowing that, if he wanted to try to change himself again, that he’d have to wait twelve hours. Figuring that this was an option, and that the option would be to stay as a young woman long enough to explore his feminine world, he headed back to the sink to wash his hands.</p>
