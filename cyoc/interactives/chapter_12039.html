<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">At their separate homes, both Tony and Jack were quietly frantic.  Both wondered what the hell was going on.  Tony absolutely denied to himself that he was gay, as did Jack.  Tony tried to reach Jennifer but she either wasn't home or wouldn't take his call.  He thought of another girl who he knew was looking for him to call.  He dialed her number but she actually was out.  With a sigh, he decided to stay in and watch TV.  He checked the listing of movies, at 8pm, there was The Birdcage, Tea and Sympathy and The Boys in the Band. No!  Tony watched some sports.  He gradually fell asleep, waking up just enough to stagger to bed after midnight.<br />
<br />
His sleep was fitful.  Twice, Tony woke from dreams and almost had anxiety attacks.  Both times his reveries were of sodomizing Jack.  He lovingly kissed his fair skinned friend all over then pressed his palms to Jack's modest buns pushing them apart, then thrusting deep into-<br />
&quot;Aaaarrrrgggghhhh!&quot;  Each time he woke with a half shout gasping for breath sweating profusely.  He wondered, desperately, if there was some way he could control his dreams and what would fill them.  He thought only of Jennifer as he went to sleep, but each time, the uncontrolled wanderings of his mind concerned the naked body of his redheaded friend and invading it.<br />
<br />
Tony dressed and went to school feeling tired and miserable.  When he saw Jack in the hallway, Jack kept his distance and faced Tony at all times, refusing to turn his back toward him.  Oh my god, did he have the same dreams?  How?<br />
<br />
All the anxiety over his new homosexual enthusiasms kept him from concentrating at all on his teachers, until his study period when he sat down and felt an electric shock.  &quot;Yeow!&quot;  He tapped the steel tubing of the desk.  That didn't usually happen.  But he went about his day from then on and relaxed.  He concentrated on all his teachers' lectures.  At least he did until the string of classes that Jack was also in.  Jack sauntered into english class and flashed a big grin at Tony who leered back.  Tony honestly tried to focus on Mrs. Horowitz, but just a few feet away was Jack's tight little ass.  Iambic pentameter or tight little ass?  Tony had to walk out of the room with his books over his crotch and it wasn't because he was happy to see a certain rhyme scheme.  <br />
<br />
He could barely keep his hands off Jack, even knowing the repercussions in homophobic high school.   What was more, he knew that Jack felt likewise from the look in his eyes.  If that wasn't enough, the way he ran his fingers playfully up the side of Tony's ass might have sufficed as a clue.  <br />
<br />
By the middle of their last class, Tony was out of his mind with desire for Jack, to run his hands over his pink, perfect skin, through his fine red hair to take him.<br />
<br />
The bell sounded ending the last class Tony and Jack made a beeline for their lockers and it was only when they ran into Emma Chase with their interlocked fingers that Tony realized they'd been holding hands the whole way. <br />
&quot;Jeez.  Get a room you two fruits!&quot; she laughed and a score more kids joined her in the laughter.  Tony and Jack let go of each other's hand but ran outside with their ballet tights in their bags.  They started down the street toward the dance studio.  But they couldn't wait.  In full view of scores of students, Tony leaned over and kissed Jack who enthusiastically responded.  They heard derisive catcalls and shouts and ran across one yard then another to a side street. They ran down the side street a couple houses and then into the back yard of a particularly quiet, secluded one.  They threw their bags aside and Tony ripped Jack's shirt off him while Jack undid Tony's belt and pulled his pants down past his knees.  They kissed hungrily and Tony yanked Jack's pants down to his ankles.  He grabbed Jack from behind kissing him hard behind his ears and on his neck.  He threw Jack to the ground and spread his legs with his knees.  Tony rocked back and with one powerful thrust slammed his shiny purple glans into Jack's rear, or he tried to, but it could not fit.  Tony thrust again.  &quot;Ow!&quot;  Jack squealed, unable to accept Tony.  <br />
<br />
And then Tony felt dizzy.  He lost his balance and rolled off Jack who seem similarly incapacitated, rolling over onto his side.  In a few seconds, Tony came out of it.<br />
&quot;What the fuck!&quot; he shouted <br />
&quot;What the fuck's going on!&quot; seconded Jack.  Both hyperventilated as they frantically pulled their clothes back on.  <br />
&quot;Jesus christ!  I spend all night with these horrible dreams of you fucking me up the ass, dreaming of being fucked up the ass!  Think about that!  And now you almost do!  You, my buddy!?&quot;<br />
&quot;Hey man, I don't know what's going on either.  And I dreamed of jamming you all last night.  What . . what the fuck's going on?&quot;<br />
&quot;I don't know, Tony.  I got a shock from a desk or carpet or something and couldn't stop thinking about your ass.  Honest to god&quot;<br />
&quot;Wait a minute.  That's the same thing that happened to me.  I got a shock and then my mind turned to mush, gay mush.&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh fuck.  We kissed in front of half the school.  We're dead.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tony sat and thought for a minute.  &quot;So, you had dreams of me jamming it up your butt&quot;  Jack nodded sadly.  &quot;Do-do you have these intermittent periods of clarity where you wonder what the hell you're doing?&quot;  Jack nodded again.  Tony described his sudden realization that he was dancing ballet.  Ballet!  Jack described a similar period of anxiety.  Tony described his sudden problems in school.  Jack said he'd experienced the same thing.  They both remembered their kiss in the showers and how suddenly they'd thought they'd gone insane.<br />
&quot;That wasn't just, like misgivings at realizing I'm gay&quot; said Jack.  &quot;It was like a twilight zone episode or something.  I literally came out of a trance kissing you and stroking your johnson&quot;<br />
Tony nodded agreement at the account of the experience.  <br />
&quot;I'm not gay, man and something bizarre is going on here.  I go along doing bizarre shit I can't believe I'm doing and then I have this short period where I can see how fucked up everything is and then I fall back into the trance&quot;<br />
<br />
Tony and Jack sat there in the secluded back yard trying to figure out what was going on but they couldn't come up with anything.  Tony idly watched a very old woman through the picture window of a nearby house cleaning her carpets.  The woman had amazing energy at her age to devote to such an insignificant task.  She should start her own company Tony sniffed.  Crone-a-vac.<br />
<br />
Tony jumped to his feet.  &quot;That's it!  That's it!&quot; he shouted.  <br />
&quot;What's it?&quot; asked a skeptical Jack still sitting on the grass.<br />
&quot;The chronivac!&quot; shouted Tony.  &quot;The chronivac.  Somebody's fucking with us using the chronivac!&quot;  Jack's eyes widened and his face slowly burst into a grin as he recalled the chronivac.  <br />
&quot;Holy shit, Tony.  That's it.&quot;  He jumped up and high fived Tony.  &quot;But what do we do now?  If we don't go to ballet, whoever's fucking with us will figure out that something's up.  On the other side, man, I have had my fill of showing my little ass to everyone.  It'd be one thing if I was like you . . &quot;, he laughed and Tony gave him a solid punch.<br />
&quot;We've gotta find the machine now, before we go soft again and end up sucking each other's cocks or something&quot; said Tony and both he and Jack shuddered.<br />
<br />
They went to Tony's house, first, looking for his backup dvd copies of the four profiles.  On the way, a couple football players derided them in the most abusive terms possible as gay lovers.  As they walked into Tony's house, his brother gave the two of them a look that said he'd either heard or suspected the same story.  Tony ran upstairs with Jack right behind and made a beeline for a wall corner next to his closet.  He pulled off a piece of paneling revealing and empty space.<br />
&quot;They should be here!&quot; he groaned and turned to Jack.  &quot;They should be here.  I hid the dvd's right there.&quot;  Tony reached around and came up with only a small, dusty orange post-it note.  There was a 1-800 number on it.  Tony sat on the bed next to the pillow and picked up the phone.  After just one ring, a woman answered.<br />
