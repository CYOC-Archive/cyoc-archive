<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The Genie smiled devilishly and snapped his fingers, Jeff&#39;s mouth reappeared and the restraining force dissipated. The Genie laughed and collapsed on the bed, propping his head in his hands. &quot;Oh, the look on your face, it was delightful! That instant you realized I could make you 30 years older in an instant and only live out the shitty parts of your dad&#39;s life. HA! Though, I am kind of hurt you thought I&#39;d do that to you. You go on with such suspicion about me, then make the vaguest wish possible, and treat me like the bad guy for not even knowing what you want out of it. Honestly, I am mischievous, not evil. You could have been an indestructible sentient screwdriver for the rest of existence if I wanted to be mean... but here you are, flesh and blood. Do I get an apology? Do I get a &#39;Thank you Genie!&#39;?? Of course not. Well, you know where to find me if you need me.&quot; and with that the Genie poofed back to his lamp.<br />
<br />
While the Genie was monologuing Jeff was frantically patting himself down and making sure he was as he remembered. Vaguely aware the genie was talking he looked up to see him roll his eyes dramatically and vaporize into the lamp... Jeff then ran to the bathroom to triple check he wasn&#39;t turned into a copy of his father or aged into one of his dad&#39;s friends and nearly cried to see the same 16 year old boy he expected.<br />
<br />
The thought struck Jeff like a load of bricks, if Jeff is the same, his dad might be incapacitated in some way mentally or physically. That would be a mean prank a genie would pull. Jeff may not be turned into an adult, but Jeff&#39;s usefulness would skyrocket if Mike were turned into a toddler, or worse yet, an infant.<br />
<br />
Jeff bolted downstairs to find his dad outside taking care of chores, no indication of reduced mental capacity or physical capability. &quot;Hey Dad, how ya doing?&quot; Jeff was wracking his brain to figure out how the wish was granted, maybe he gained a specific skill or skillset, or maybe his dad is unintelligible to anyone but Jeff... He wanted to find out before chaos ensued.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m good, just doing a little trimming. If you have some time to kill, it would be a big help if you could gather the trimmings and take them to the fire pit in back.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff paused, no insane compulsion to obey, that&#39;s a plus. &quot;Sure.&quot; Jeff began with collecting twigs and his dad continued trimming making more for Jeff to clean up until he grabbed a garbage bin and Mike began dropping the twigs in while Jeff used another bin to pick up the existing mess.<br />
<br />
Jeff&#39;s trips were faster than either of them expected and Jeff was moving into picking up branches that were cut back. &quot;Oh, That one is extra heavy, you might need to wait for me and we can do it together.&quot; Mike gestured to a 5ft branch as thick as his thigh and covered in shoots. <br />
<br />
&quot;Alright&quot; Jeff said swapping his freshly emptied garbage can for Mike&#39;s half full one. Jeff continued gathering bigger branches and dragging them back to the fire pit, fighting branches in one hand, garbage can in the other. Eventually he was maintaining his father&#39;s fresh cuttings and had cleared out his prior work, so Jeff was left fighting with the log his dad had cut. It was a struggle but Jeff kept working at it and it eventually gave way to Jeff&#39;s determination finding a new home in the fire pit to dry out.<br />
<br />
Jeff reported back to his father, &quot;Getting slow old man.&quot; Jeff said panting from exertion as he swapped out the garbage can again. Mike scowled at Jeff&#39;s jab but looked around seeing the clean yard. &quot;Well damn, good job Jeff. I guess I have time to start on the gutters now. Feeling tall?&quot; He said with a grin but cocked his head when he looked at Jeff, &quot;You must have worked hard, you look... pumped. Let&#39;s save the gutters for tomorrow, if you&#39;re up for it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, okay.&quot; Jeff grabbed the garbage cans while Dad grabbed the various trimmers and saws. Jeff beat his father inside and went to the bathroom to wash the sweat off his face before it dried and turned into a salt scrub. Jeff glances down at his arms, noticing why Mike decided to change plans. Jeff was noticeably thicker with defined muscles. A realization hits him. The genie&#39;s wish has enhanced his physical abilities. Jeff&#39;s eyes widen in surprise and a mix of excitement and fear. He&#39;s not sure what to make of this newfound physique, thankfully the transformation is at a level that could be dismissed from inattentiveness but any more and he&#39;d have to explain overnight growth.<br />
<br />
Jeff returns to his room, still reeling from the transformation. He grabbed the lamp summoning the genie. &quot;Genie! I need to talk to you!&quot; The genie appears, a mischievous grin on his face.  &quot;Well, well, well. Looks like you already got some use out of your wish.&quot;<br />
&quot;What did you do to me? Why did you make me stronger?&quot; Jeff asked careful to lower his voice and shut his bedroom door. <br />
&quot;I didn&#39;t make you stronger, I made it so you could be useful to your father, of course, as you wished.&quot;<br />
&quot;You didn&#39;t do this to me?&quot;<br />
&quot;How can I say this clearly and accurately? The last time I altered reality was to grant your wish, enter my bottle, and then exit my bottle when you summoned me just now.&quot; The genie grinned like a politician. <br />
Jeff was rightfully skeptical, &quot;So are you saying how you granted my wish had nothing to do with my transformation?&quot;<br />
The genie sneered, &quot;Don&#39;t be foolish, I&#39;m saying I didn&#39;t dictate your change and you must improve your line of questioning.&quot;<br />
&quot;Did I do this to myself somehow? To help dad with the trimming?&quot; Jeff&#39;s eyes grew wide with excitement.<br />
&quot;A much better question, but still not the right one. Do you wish for me to enlighten you?&quot; The genie inquired.<br />
&quot;Oh no. You aren&#39;t going to catch me using a wish that way!&quot;<br />
&quot;You really cant blame a genie for trying, especially given how you worded the last wish.&quot; The genie smirked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well out with it, what were the specifics you imposed on making me useful to my dad?&quot; Jeff asked irritated.<br />
&quot;I&#39;m obligated to grant wishes not answer your questions. But I do think this could be fun... for me.&quot; The genie did barrel rolls in the air maintaining eye contact the whole time, &quot;So, your goal is to make someone, more fun to someone else. Now, change reality to make it happen, what do you do? And remember, they get to be vague but YOU have to be specific.&quot;<br />
Jeff laughed, &quot;Easy, I make them funnier, and more spontaneous. Maybe even rich so they can do fun things? Yeah, that sounds fun!&quot;<br />
&quot;For you. But you don&#39;t know the second person, maybe their idea of fun is quietly reading a book, reliable plans without interruptions, and the comfort of knowing they can always participate in this activity with no cost and therefore their fun isnt just relegated to a vacation, expense, and adhering to plans? You don&#39;t know, but you have to make this person see your master as more fun and the wish has already been made, you can feel the magic burning within you, waiting for your plan to unleash itself. What can you do?&quot; The genie grinned as Jeff&#39;s brow furrowed in frustration.<br />
&quot;Right, and now that you mention it, even something this person likes, they wouldn&#39;t want it all the time... in your example the person might like to go for a walk or sometimes a carnival, so making the master only love going home and reading would eventually make them less fun.&quot; Jeff reasoned.<br />
&quot;Very good Master! Keep going, how could you grant the wish assuming you&#39;re actually trying to be helpful.&quot; a fresh chocolate chip cookie appeared out of nowhere in Jeff&#39;s hand.<br />
&quot;Well, rather than setting The Master up to be one way in particular, I&#39;d set them up to like the idea of anything the second person found fun, in the moment, while together. I&#39;d have to, because I don&#39;t know what they will find fun. The wish itself means they are committed to making this person happy so they&#39;d probably be okay with always... oh no.&quot; Jeff looked at himself in this new horrific light, &quot;This wasn&#39;t what I wanted!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Isn&#39;t it though? You wished for it... This way you could always be useful to your dad. Just get within earshot and as soon as he needs something you can&#39;t provide you will change to become able to provide it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah but he can tell that I suddenly beefed up. So I&#39;m sure everyone else can too. How long until I shrink back to normal?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Back to normal? This is your new normal unless I forgot something you specifically stipulated in your wish, and until your father needs you to be different. He needed you stronger and so you are, he didn&#39;t need others to see you as stronger. I do wonder however, how long you will remain as you are.&quot; A wry smile crossed his lips. &quot;How long until he needs something his young son cannot provide as is? Dare I hope he craves fatherly wisdom from a wizened old man, or a retreat with a comrade? This wish is sure to become quite fun very soon though, I suppose you could ruin my fun and wish it undone. Well, when you&#39;re ready you know how to call on me.&quot; The genie began dissipating like paper turning to ash.<br />
<br />
Jeff&#39;s face fell, &quot;You mean my dad could overwrite my identity all together?&quot;<br />
<br />
A disembodied chuckle filled the room, &quot;Not fully, it wouldn&#39;t be fun if you forgot ALL of who you were.&quot;</p>
