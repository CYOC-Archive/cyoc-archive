<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Before Mila could so much as raise her voice the two were already piling into the bathroom, pulled along by Siya’s excitement. Mila stammered a protest, but it was lost to Siya’s ramblings about her plans for the evening, which were so chaotic she spent a significant time probing her own ideas, all while gesturing and setting up the shower. Mila’s uncomfort hit boiling point, standing there as she tried to stammer out a request for a pause, before it all melted away.<br />
<br />
Siya’s jumper came off, discarded by the door, her nipples bleeding through a lacy bra. She was chubby, her softness giving her curvy hips all too often hidden underneath baggy clothes, her breasts always deceptively large. Mila watched on, the sister’s body raising a thousand questions of her own, chief among them ‘am I that hot?’<br />
<br />
Siya looked back, her once confident posture menting under her sister’s gaze.<br />
<br />
“Sorry, I get excited, do you want to…”<br />
<br />
“It’s f-fine.” Mila smiled, locking the door and pulling off her hoodie. “We are sisters, so I guess it&#39;s normal, and I have had girlfriends. Nothing I haven’t seen before.”<br />
<br />
That was a lie. It wasn’t the first time Dan had been with a naked woman, but this wasn’t a naked woman, it was a naked Siya, and Siya was a cut above. She was a bronze statue to a fertility goddess, and now she wasn’t alone, and Dan had his hands all over the other.<br />
<br />
Siya looked away, her undressing slowed with nerves, but only allowing Mila more time to eye her up. Siya was more than just like a sister, always had been, Siya was the kind of person Dan had felt comfortable relaxing with, felt comfortable just being with, comfortable making mistakes around, and part of that still lingered. Mila knew her sister would never judge her, not about her attitude, her curiosity, and especially her body. <br />
<br />
She wondered if her nipples were going to be that dark, and without thinking she took off the oversized, manish top, looking at herself, looking DOWN at herself. The soft brown figure was much the same, slight rolls only accentuating her femenine figure, adding a layer of inviting plushness. Her breasts heaved with each breath, jiggled under the slightest provocation, and were peaked with a rich and deep brown, accentuating the tawny mass. They were new, very new, and fun even in concept, but they had nothing compared to what came next. <br />
<br />
Pulling their pants down, Mila at last laid eyes at the concentrated darkness around their vagina. Their. Vagina. It was hard to see, sitting at the bottom and hidden behind thick thighs, but she felt it, and the more she thought about it the more it responded. She wanted to touch it, wanted to explore the tingling folds, but more than that she wanted to play with something else.<br />
<br />
Siya was nude too, her nerves melting to just a slight blush that reddened her cheeks, her eyes more hungry that Mila’s in how they scanned over every inch. They shared a smile, as Siya slipped into the stream, inviting her sister in. a tentative Mila moved forward, stepping into the stream, at her sister’s side.<br />
<br />
For a moment the two just stood there, both equally aware that, despite what they were telling themselves, this wasn’t normal. Siya stood there, hands on a scrubber, moving towards her twin and pressing the soap-sodden mass against her, embarrassment now pushing her eyes anywhere but on her doppleganger, eyes glazing over. Mila was, by contrast, burdened by the reality of the moment, that she was Dan, that Dan was a girl, and that Dan was currently in a shower with his figurative - and now literal - sister. His heart thumping in his throat, his hands came to rest on her sister’s, the fidgeting fingers idling.<br />
<br />
“Wash my back?” Mila asked. Siya nodded. “Make sure you don’t overdo it. Very sensitive skin now, like yours, right?” Siya nodded again, something else in her expression. Regret? No. Something about Siya was telling Mila she was very into this, but just holding it all back. Conflict? Yes, but that was unhelpful. WHY was she conflicted? WHY was she conflicted NOW?<br />
<br />
Mila turned, Siya lingered, but as Mila turned to ask if she was okay she started rubbing the soap into Mila’s back. Mila moved under the water, the warmth highlighting every nook and curve, every aspect of her outspilling femininity, but even then Mila could still sense something about her sister. Without warning she turned again, wanting to say something, catching Siya’s hand withdrawing away. All at once, every question Mila had crumbled, and she let out a sigh of relief.<br />
<br />
Three years ago, when Mila was dating someone for the first time, she went to Dan to talk about an odd conflict, one he felt an echo of there. She had fidgeted on the edge of his bed, while he sat there, reassuring her nerves were fine, as she explained that she wanted to spend every moment hugging their partner, but every time they came near Siya just froze. <br />
<br />
“I can’t stop fantasising about it,” she had admitted, face glowing, “but the second they get near I just, I can’t not feel like a perv.” On that occasion Dan just told the partner to just hug her a few times, break the boundaries, but only after asking first. This, Mila thought, was going to require something a little bold.<br />
<br />
“Your turn?” Mila asked, beaming. Siya looked up, nodding, a smile sneaking back onto her face.<br />
<br />
Mila re-soaped the scrubber, but unlike her sister she didn’t hesitate. This was normal, Mila told herself, sisters around the world do this every day. She rested a hand on Siya, on her shoulder, the scrubber sliding up and down, vigorous but not too abrasive, letting the sisterly glow on her face flow into her actions. Siya first looked worried, her heart and breathing increasing, but as she settled something else emerged. As Mila began cleaning low Siya began relaxing, the smile returning to full bloom. <br />
<br />
Turning back around, a blushing but smiling Siya gestured with one arm, half raising it, but stool too shy to ask. Mila just raised it the rest of the way herself, scrubbing her pit, forcing herself on the other. With that clear Siya and Mila giggled, the sisters relaxing into one another, relaxing together at last, letting their instincts take over. Mila kissed her twin on the cheek, saying something benign, but only getting the first few sounds, before the words were stalled in her mouth, interrupted by Siya’s lips, by their first kiss.</p>
