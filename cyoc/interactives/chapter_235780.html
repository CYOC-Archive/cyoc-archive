<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Alec wiped his brow on his arm as he settled the portable amp into place, helping his cousin set up on he edge of the beach where the ground was less sandy and a bit more solid. Sure it was a little bit away from the fire, but as long as there were tunes no one would notice. Devin, Alec&#39;s cousin was busy talking to his band mates, though he did shoot Alec a smile of thanks, no doubt they&#39;d be able to talk later, but the trio of the band began tuning their instruments.<br />
<br />
Alec was about to make himself scarce, when, &quot;Working hard?&quot; came a jovial voice, causing Alec to spin on his heels to face Dylan who had come up behind him. He had long ago stopped blushing in the presence of his muscular friend, the first few weeks they hung out it was hard, especially when it was more of a tutoring relationship than real friendship, but that was years ago. And Alec had given up on anything happening between them, what with Dylan&#39;s revolving door of girls he never seemed to keep around more than a few weeks. More so when they got the off campus apartment with Vince during sophomore year, generously paid for by Dylan&#39;s dad, and Alec had to deal with the Dylan&#39;s latest conquest not so subtly sneaking out in the morning. &quot;It&#39;s a party, bro, you need to unwind a little.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry, I was about to go get myself a beer...&quot; Alec&#39;s voice trailed off as he looked at Dylan. Something was off with the surfer. It was hard to tell against his tanned skin, but there was a dusting of blond fuzz along his pectorals, and even a bit of scruff along his jaw. Dylan was fastidious when it came to his grooming, keeping himself shaved, in face Alec wasn&#39;t even sure if Dylan had chest hair or not with how smooth he kept himself. Without thinking, Alec picked up the camera hanging around his neck and started flicking through the photos he had taken.<br />
<br />
Dylan just shook his head. &quot;Don&#39;t stare too much at that peek I gave you, bro.&quot; He said, still sounding amused as he gave Alec a little nudge then waved over to an arriving guest. &quot;I&#39;ll check on you later, and you better be drunk.&quot; He said before wandering off to greet the newest guests.<br />
<br />
Alec flicked at the display screen on his camera, zooming in on the pic of Dylan surfing. Maybe the camera didn&#39;t catch it, but he looked his usual smooth self in the photo. Alec&#39;s eyes slipped down to the surfer&#39;s plump exposed cock and felt some heat coming into his cheeks. He&#39;d seen it before, especially when Dylan dragged him to the gym or even just walked around the house naked.<br />
<br />
He shook his head, pulling his attention away and dropping the camera down as he looked around the beach. Something was going on here. Frowning, he scratched at his chest again, and this time, with his thoughts on Dylan&#39;s fuzz, he noticed something off with himself. He grabbed the zipper of his hoodie and yanked it down further to pull the fabric aside. &quot;The fuck?&quot;<br />
<br />
He had always been a little fuzzy since puberty hit, but not like this. The black hair across his chest was thick, almost hiding the pale skin under it, a strip going down his stomach and disappearing beneath the waistband of his shorts. Not caring who was watching he pulled the waist band away and peered down, seeing the thick bush around the base of cock, semi-hard from his picture voyeurism a few moments earlier.<br />
<br />
Waistband snapping back into place as he let it go he glanced around the beach once more. He only knew a few people well enough to tell if something was off with them, and the only one close enough was his cousin, who seemed fine for the moment, but was wearing a tee-shirt and shorts so maybe not. Then again, he and Dylan had been here longer, and Vince was no where to be seen. He whipped out his cell, not sure how that was gonna help, but groaned in annoyance. No reception.<br />
<br />
Not even bothering to reclaim his sandals, he padded across the sand toward the trail through the forest to the parking area, at the very least he needed to get away and clear his head. Something was definitely wrong but he couldn&#39;t think clearly. In his worry he didn&#39;t notice his bare feet handling the rocky, rooted forest path fine, the thick pads growing on the soles of his feet cushioning his feet as he strode along.<br />
<br />
Finally, he saw the trees opening up ahead for the clearing they had used for parking or so he thought. As he burst past the tree line, the ground under his feet gave way to sand as the beach lay spread out in front of him as he left it. Starting to panic, he turned around and ran. He must have gotten turned around, but as he once more reached the tree line, he stumbled out onto the beach.<br />
<br />
&quot;Woah there!&quot; He heard as a strong arm reached out across his chest and kept him from tripping down into the sand. He stared and the pale, freckled limb and look up to see the face of its owner. His face and shoulders were pale and freckled as well, with a mop of curly red hair atop his head with a short matching beard. He was broad and muscular, a bit shorter but more solidly built than Dylan. The face was familiar from campus. Another senior? Maybe a grad student?<br />
<br />
The man smiled, flashing white teeth. &quot;You okay? You look worried.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alec opened his mouth, wanting to share his discoveries, but they sounded insane to his own ears even before speaking them. He just shook his head. &quot;No, I uh..&quot; Alec&#39;s mouth felt dry as he stepped away from the redhead. God he was hot, and for a moment, he couldn&#39;t even remember why he was worried. He stared at the semi-stranger, the bonfire blazing behind him and his anxieties cooled, while other feelings began to flare, making him adjust his shorts with an embarrassed blush. &quot;Just thought I forgot something.&quot; Then after a moment, he found himself grinning bac. &quot;Hi, I&#39;m Alec.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Jeremy.&quot; The redhead replied with a grin and a speculative gaze. Alec couldn&#39;t help but feel he was being undressed by those eyes. &quot;Wanna get a beer?&quot; He asked, jerking his thumb over his shoulder to the refreshment coolers.</p>
