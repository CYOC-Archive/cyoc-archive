<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Anna and Greg woke up to wet diapers, they felt cold and damp in their sleeper pajamas. They shrugged it off and continued sucking their pacifiers that stayed in their mouths overnight. <br />
<br />
Suddenly, their mother came in and changed them out of their wet diapers and PJs, then she took them in the kitchen each with a new, fresh diaper. She fed them mushed bananas for breakfast and then took them back to the nursery. When she got there, she set them down and went to go retrieve some clothes for them to wear for the day. While she was out, Anna and Greg had a small discussion:<br />
<br />
&#39;Wah nah?&#39; said Anna. Greg looked confused. &#39;Thood we be biggoo aggeh?!&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;No&#39; said Greg, &#39;I doh wanah!&#39; He crossed his arms over like a pouty child. Anna thought it was quite cute as she giggled. <br />
<br />
&#39;Buh wah abow Fweh an&#39; Dim?!&#39; said Anna, &#39;We hafa geh dem bag!&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Ow?!&#39; asked Greg. &#39;We widdoo!&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;We gah-ah geh owdah!&#39; said Anna. <br />
<br />
&#39;Buh, I wike be-uhn widdoo!&#39; said Greg. &#39;I wike my dibees! I wike my geeko doo!&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Geeko?&#39; questioned Anna. <br />
<br />
&#39;Geeko Weeko!&#39; exclaimed Greg, pointing at the jar of pacifiers on the changing table. Anna looked and saw what he was pointing at. She looked like she understood now. <br />
<br />
&#39;Oh pathifwie-uhs!&#39; said Anna. Greg tried to explain that he would call his pacifiers &#39;geekos&#39; when he was a baby. Every time he wanted it, he would say &#39;Geeko Weeko!&#39; and one of his parents would come swooping in ready with a pacifier in hand for him to nurse on. Anna thought it sounded babyish, but then again, she was now a baby again. <br />
<br />
&#39;Ok, buh we nee-doo geh owduh soo.&#39; said Anna. <br />
<br />
&#39;Dis many dayths?! said Greg, holding up a 2. <br />
<br />
Anna nodded in agreement. <br />
<br />
&#39;Yaaaaaaaay!&#39; sais Greg enthusiastically. He enjoyed being this little again and escaping the stress of regular life. He wanted to cherish as much of this as he could. <br />
<br />
Their mother came back in with clothes for them to wear that day. She dressed them in toddler clothes, then took them out to the minivan. Once she got there and buckled them into their car seats, she explained what was going on, &#39;We are going to the park today!&#39; she said in a manner to get the kids excited. <br />
<br />
&#39;YAAAAAAAY!&#39; both of them shouted. <br />
<br />
&#39;We are gonna have fun today! Yes we are!&#39; said Mom. She pulled out a pacifier for each of them  and placed each one into their mouths. They started sucking eagerly in excitement to the day ahead. <br />
<br />
&#39;Momma will be right back!&#39; she said as she went inside to get the diaper bag and double stroller for them. <br />
<br />
When she went inside, the babies looked at each other while smiling behind their pacifiers. Greg took this opportunity to have a little fun with Anna, &#39;GEEGO WEEGO!&#39; shouted Greg, his pacifier shield bobbing around his mouth while he was shouting his childhood phrase. Anna broke into a hysterical laughter, pacifier falling out of her mouth while she was laughing so hard. <br />
<br />
Greg looked back at Anna laughing and suddenly found that he was staring at her. He really loved her even as a toddler, she was beautiful at the age of 18 months as she was at age 23. He found himself sucking a little bit harder on his pacifier as he continued to stare at her. <br />
<br />
Anna picked up her pacifier that fell in her lap and put it back in her mouth, honing back into her rhythm of sucking before it fell out of her mouth. She looked over at Greg and saw him staring at her while curiously sucking on his pacifier. She raised her eyebrow, then waved a hand at him as if to snap him out of his thoughts. He snapped out of his trance and quickly turned away, blushing while doing so.  Anna could tell he was blushing and giggled behind her pacifier. <br />
<br />
Their mother arrived back at the minivan and packed the diaper bag and stroller up for them in the back. She then went to the driver&#39;s seat and sat inside, starting up the vehicle. She turned around and looked at her babies, &#39;ready to go?!&#39; she asked. <br />
<br />
They both nodded excitingly. They were really cute babies. She chuckled, &#39;all right then let&#39;s go!&#39;<br />
<br />
They made their way to the park. <br />
<br />
On the way there, Greg looked out the window and was surprised at how big everything seemed to be. He felt a little intimidated at some of the big things he saw passing by, luckily for him the pacifier in his mouth kept him calm and content, sucking steadily with each passing moment on the way to the park. He became bored on the way over there, feeling annoyed that he was buckled in his seat with nothing to do. He started playing with the handle of his pacifier, trying so desperately to keep himself occupied, until he just gave up and relaxed into the car seat, sucking his pacifier at a more steady rhythm. <br />
<br />
Anna on the other hand, seemed to relax a bit more as she took in the surrounding environments on the way to the park. Her pacifier kept her concentrated on the things outside as she observed them, sucking at her own rhythm to keep herself focused on her surroundings. <br />
<br />
They were both just anxious to get there and enjoy the day.</p>
