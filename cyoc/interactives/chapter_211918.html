<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kenny was annoyed.<br />
<br />
Both his friends were gone and some assholes had come in and ruined the party. The couch was completely ruined. When he’d tried putting back upright, he found rips in the fabric and one leg had completely broken off.<br />
<br />
So he painstakingly dragged the couch out the double-doors and tossed it to the curb next to the trash. A skinny young man clinging to the arms of a big-bellied old professor walked past him. The Professor winked at Kenny and Kenny blushed. He didn’t know either of them, though there was something vaguely familiar about them…<br />
<br />
Kenny shook his head and started back inside. He nearly tripped over a football. Angrily, he kicked it away, and almost tripped over two big, black dildos that someone had placed on the lawn outside the front window. He picked them up and considered tossing them but they were strangely warm to the touch, which kinda grossed him out.  The last thing he wanted to be doing right now was carrying two dildos to the trash after they’d just come out of someone’s ass. <br />
<br />
Kenny just dropped them where he’d found them – hopefully whoever left them here would come take them back before tomorrow morning.<br />
<br />
Walking back inside, Kenny took a glance into the bathroom before deciding not to get involved in someone else’s problem. Some burly repair man was in there on top of a younger guy, loudly fucking him. He’d never told Steve, but Kenny was gay. Deeply closeted, of course. There were weirdly hot bears running around now.<br />
<br />
“What the fuck is going on with this party?” Kenny shook his head.<br />
<br />
The place felt even more deserted now, he realized. <br />
<br />
Maybe thirty people out of the 150 most of their ragers would pull. The lights flickered again. Maybe it was the fact that the power kept going out, Kenny reasoned. Even the music would skip. Not exactly great for a party.<br />
<br />
He went back to the living room and stared at the blank spot where the couch used to be. Kenny sighed. This rager had really gotten out of hand. He looked around for somewhere to sit, but everything else had been claimed by tired or drunk party goers to snooze on..<br />
<br />
“Boy, I wish I there was an incredibly comfortable fucking couch in here.” Kenny said sarcastically.<br />
<br />
Immediately, warm red light engulfed him.<br />
<br />
Kenny saw the lights flicker and wondered what was happening. He was stretching, growing longer, body warping at unnatural angles. The young jock didn’t even have time to scream as he found himself on all fours. His back had folded at an angle, and everything about him felt…puffy.<br />
<br />
A few moments of pleasurable warmth later, and Kenny dizzily realized he could still see…sort of. He could see things above him, like the ceiling, and a little towards his front. He could feel himself squishing against other parts of himself. There was a stiff rigidity to his form that was less uncomfortable and more sturdy.<br />
<br />
He glanced at the fireplace’s glass doors and saw the living room reflected back. Strangely, he couldn’t see himself in it. Just a very comfortable-looking couch in the place of the old couch, right where it had been situated. With growing horror, Kenny realized he was the couch.<br />
<br />
Kenny tried to strain his limited vision to see who’d done this to him. The jocks from before were nowhere to be found, however. They would have been the most likely culprits. Kenny tried to calm himself, but he was feeling angry and scared and very comfortable.<br />
<br />
The former jock paused. That was odd. Well, he was comfortable, that was simply a matter of fact. Sitting in front of a fireplace in the middle of a stately living room, it was all very cozy. The idea that he was accepting this new state scared him, but he couldn’t move.<br />
<br />
Hours passed and the house grew emptier.<br />
<br />
A few strange things happened between that point. Kenny thought he heard howls and strange, primitive ‘ooks’. There was the sound of a bunch of dogs running around the house, then more silence. The music shut off and the lights automatically dimmed.<br />
<br />
Two men lumbered into the living room. One was the husky, burly repairman and the other was the short, stout young man he’d been fucking hours ago. Again, Kenny was struck by a sense of familiarity with the two, though that was impossible.<br />
<br />
Both of them appeared to have taken a dip in the Jacuzzi out back, toweling off their hairy forms and looking around the frat house. They were wearing swimming trunks and soft t-shirts, and the trunks looked a bit wet. Kenny was terrified of them sitting on his dry fabric, getting it wet. Wet fabric got musty!<br />
<br />
“That dip in the Jacuzzi was nice, son.” The bigger, older man said, scratching his beard.<br />
<br />
“Yes, daddy.” The younger guy said.<br />
<br />
“Heh, see!” The older bear slapped the cub on the back. “This job does come with perks! Weird how empty the house is.”<br />
<br />
The cub nodded. “Yeah, and the fact that we found towels and clothes that fit us.”<br />
<br />
Kenny waited for a light to shine on them. It was the only thing he could think of that could have triggered his own transformation. But nothing happened.<br />
<br />
He saw the burly bear backing up towards him.<br />
<br />
Kenny panicked. He’d gone the whole night without anyone sitting on him. What would happen to his mind if they did? He was already thinking kinda like a couch-<br />
<br />
The plumber sat himself down and Kenny found himself focusing on the burly man’s ass. Kenny could feel him squirming, shifting his large form into a more comfortable position. It was strange and he felt himself becoming fluffier and firmer at the exact right spots for the big man. <br />
<br />
“Oh yeah~” The big man crooned, wriggling himself deeper into the cushion. “This feels damn nice, Chris. Should be perfect for our needs.”<br />
<br />
Chris? Kenny’s mind raced as he took in the chubby cub’s features. He DID look like Chris! Holy shit, had he been changed too? Was that what happened to everyone else?<br />
<br />
Chris walked over, poking a cushion with a thick finger before flopping down on the opposite side of the couch. Kenny got a deep impression of his plump ass as well. The cub wriggled himself deeper in the same manner the plumber had before.<br />
<br />
“You’re right, Jim!” Chris said excitedly, his voice an octave higher than Kenny remembered it. “Maybe we should keep it, daddy!”<br />
<br />
“Maybe we should… “ Jim mused.<br />
<br />
So the plumber was Jim. Kenny realized he had an opportunity to try to warn them. He strained with all his might, but couldn’t even move an inch. Despite his best efforts, he remained a perfectly  comfortable couch. The thought gave him an alien sense of pride that he’d managed to make them feel relaxed. <br />
<br />
But how had he managed to alter his softness and firmness so perfectly to fit their rumps if he couldn’t move?<br />
<br />
Kenny tried to ignore the strange thrills whenever the two shifted themselves on his cushions. His body seemed to sense their warmth and shapes and automatically adjusted his own firmness to match. He was concerned with the comfort he himself felt about being mere furniture, but the more information he had, the better he could figure out a way to escape.<br />
<br />
“I’m gonna snag one of those beers.” Jim said, and Kenny could hear a smile in his voice.<br />
<br />
“Get me one too?” Chris asked.<br />
<br />
“Sure, cub.” Jim chuckled and left for the kitchen.<br />
<br />
The second Jim was gone, Kenny was startled to find Chris undressing. He pulled off his shirt and swim trunks, revealing a completely different body than he’d had a few hours ago. Gone was his running back’s build and smooth, evenly tanned skin he shaved to show off his muscles. Now his muscles were hidden away beneath a half-inch of firm fat, a little beer belly pooching out where firm abs once lay. Chris’s body hair had grown in, a thick treasure trail that spread across his chest in a dense forest.<br />
<br />
Chris laughed to himself softly as he posed and took a picture of himself with his phone. Then he sat his now bare ass on Kenny. The cub positioned himself in a more lewd position on the couch, reaching down and giving his thick a few rubs.<br />
<br />
Kenny was in a panic. He was glad the soggy swim trunks were no longer on his precious cushions, but now he had the distinct impression of the cub’s hairy ass cheeks on his cushions. Worse, he was pretty sure Chris was going to rub one out on him and he certainly wasn’t interested in THAT. With a silent groan of anguish, he realized he could feel the cub’s balls on him, his body supporting them rather comfortably.<br />
<br />
The cub let out a soft moan, his cock fully erect, and took a quick pic of himself lewdly stroking off.<br />
<br />
“So it’s like that, huh?” Jim chuckled.<br />
<br />
The burly man sauntered into the living room, a clear bulge tenting his trunks. Chris smirked and wriggled his butt. Kenny was silently screaming, realizing exactly where this would all lead. Had it been how he’d phrased his words? Kenny had said he wanted to be ‘an incredibly comfortable… FUCKING couch’.<br />
<br />
“Flip over, son.” Jim growled when he got to the couch.<br />
<br />
Chris giggled and flipped over onto his arms and knees on the couch, wriggling his fat bubbly ass in the air invitingly. Kenny moaned in horror as the burly plumber disrobed, revealing a perfectly masculine form. Jim was like something out of a dictionary under the ‘burly working man’ gay archetype.<br />
<br />
Kenny couldn’t believe it. Even as the man carefully lifted himself up onto the couch, Kenny couldn’t process it. The two gay men were going to fuck on top of him, unaware of him. It was an oddly arousing thought. He wouldn’t mind them doing the deed if it weren’t going to take place on him. The fluids that would seep into his foam… the very thought made him wish he could shiver in horror.<br />
<br />
“Ah!” Chris gasped. “Are you good, daddy?”<br />
<br />
“Kinda, but I wish this was a bed.” Jim said. “This isn’t very comfortable.”<br />
<br />
Immediately, a tingly wave of warmth washed through Kenny’s form. <br />
<br />
Kenny recognized it as the same thing that had transformed him earlier, though less powerful and oddly soothing. Clearly, it was transforming him into a bed now. But why? Why was it responding to Jim’s wishes and not transforming the bear into a bed instead?<br />
<br />
“Should we really be doing this on the frat’s couch?” Chris asked.<br />
<br />
“Who cares? No one’s around except passed-out drunks.” Jim grinned.<br />
<br />
The couch found itself widening. Jim and Chris clearly didn’t notice, too caught up in lust to care. The bear leaned forward and licked his son’s hole, making Chris moan in pleasure. Saliva and precum dripped onto Kenny, dampening his fabric and soaking into his pliable foam.<br />
<br />
If they got to get their wishes granted, why couldn’t Kenny? Another moan and giggle came from above him. He didn’t care what the warmth transformed him into as long as he wasn’t bothered by all the sex.<br />
<br />
The warmth paused, tingles lingering, as though considering what Kenny was thinking. The moans continued above him, drops of liquid soaking into his fabric. Then the gentle warmth filled him again in long, pleasant waves.<br />
<br />
Kenny wanted to moan, feeling warm and comfortable and tingly. He could feel the two above him begin humping hearing their happy moans and sighs. His own body began to relax, his backrest slumping over, cushions merging together into a single mattress. With more space to play on, Chris rolled back over and Jim lifted his legs over his burly shoulders. <br />
<br />
The warm tingles continued in Kenny’s mind as he grew ever more larger and sturdy. He could feel the two lovers continue to hump, the big burly plumber taking in the cub’s shaft. The moans and fluids were some how bothering him less and less. Coaxing warmth guided his thoughts the same way that Jim guided his thick cock into his cub’s stretched-out hole. His mind and thoughts were growing simpler, but the bed did not know that.<br />
<br />
Kenny was directed to focus on making sure the couple were comfortable. As Jim gave a rumbling moan and came inside his son’s ass, a burst of pleasure shot through Kenny’s mind. In that brief burst of bliss, he forgot his name, or even that he was human.<br />
<br />
Smaller and smaller his mind grew, focusing less on the pleasure it received or even on the occupants above it and more on its function. The bed’s brain was smoothed and prodded into a small microchip that merely responded to warmth and pressure. Kenny’s mind no longer thought, really, if it did, then merely in if/then statements.<br />
<br />
The rest of the night passed, the bed’s microchip unaware of the passage of time, only in the shift of the occupants. When they awoke, it would find itself carefully dismantled and taken back to Jim’s small house at the edge of town. Far, far away from help.<br />
<br />
Not that any would ever come.</p>
