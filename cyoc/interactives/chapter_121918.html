<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ryan was freaking out! How was he looking down at his own body? Foam leaking out of his mouth, his eyes rolled back into his head. He recoiled backwards, running into some student’s and desks before he fell on his butt. School staff was rushing into the classroom now, attempting to remove the students from the room and revive his seemingly lifeless body. Ms. Smith from across the hall approached Ryan, still sitting on the floor, “Megan, are you alright, honey?” she asked with a thinly masked panic in her voice, “look at me honey, not at Mr. Morris, come on lets get out of here.” <br />
<br />
Ryan was trying to get out an explanation of what had happened, but couldn’t form the words. “The blue juice” he stammered, “my body, why did it happen?” Ms. Smith rushed him down the hallway into the cafeteria with the rest of the students. “I’m Ryan Morris” he finally said with enough force to get her attention. Ms. Smith looked down at him with concern and sympathy. “Ohh dear,” she said, “you have been badly shaken. Sit down here and we’ll call your parents.” Ms. Smith sat Ryan down at a table by himself, “sit here and relax, honey” she ordered. <br />
<br />
As soon as Ms. Smith left Ryan got up and went to the bathroom. He felt like he was going to puke. He made it to the sink and threw up. When he pulled his head up from the sink and looked in the mirror he saw the cute cherib face of Megan, a ditzy girl with more looks than sense. Megan was 14 years old, she stood 5’2” tall and had a lean frame and B cup breast that were coming in nicely. She had dark blonde hair with piecing light blue eyes that allowed her to wrap boys and men around her little finger. Ryan opened his mouth, the reflection in the mirror did the same, he raised his left hand and the mirror copied. Ryan was at a loss for an explanation.  Just then boy came out of the stall, and looked shocked.  “Hey, Hey Megan” he said his voice cracking, “what are you doing in the boys room?” Ryan ran out without responding. He had to get back to the liquor store and find out what was in that flask. <br />
<br />
Ryan ran out the restroom and the cafeteria taking up a quick jog towards the strip mall. Ryan could feel the lean power of Megan’s muscles, the energy that her young body possessed. In his own body Ryan would have been exhausted by now. After 20 minutes at a quick clip, Ryan was at the store, the old clerk sitting lazily at the counter. Ryan stormed in and the clerk smiled. “So you drank it?” he said amused, “and you survived.” Ryan was taken aback. “You, you?” he stuttered. “Yes I know its you” the clerk said, “you regretted you mistakes you wanted a fresh start, so I gave you one.” Ryan was speechless. “Your essence is now detached from your physical form” the clerk continued, “it will take some practice but you will be able to switch forms at will. Just make sure you’re not out of a body for too long or you will fade away.” Ryan was still speechless, when a police officer entered the store. The clerk waived him over, “I believe this girl is lost.” The Police officer had just received a report about a student missing from the school and collected Ryan and returned him to the Junior High.<br />
<br />
Ryan got a polite talking too about leaving the school and going to a liquor store, but it was chalked up to the extraordinary circumstances of the day. Megan’s mother arrived at the school to take her home for the day. All the while Ryan had remained silent. Thinking about the old clerks words. As Megan’s mother escorted who she thought was her daughter out of the school, he turned and asked “How is, umm, Mr. Morris?” she asked, “is he alive?” The principal thought for a moment and then answered, “He’s alive but in a coma.”<br />
<br />
In the car Ryan checked Megan’s phone, his finger opened it right up. There were 20 text messages from different girls and guys asking what had happened and if she was ok.  He scrolled through the different text chains as more came in.  Some of the boys had even sent her scandalous pictures.  Ryan thought he’d use this phone to keep from being too obviously out of the loop.  As they drove Megan’s mother asked her a few questions about how she was feeling and what happened.  Ryan could only respond with “I don’t know” over and over again. He really didn’t. The old clerks words were repeating in his head.  Ryan knew that what had happened was impossible, but then again here he was so it must be possible.  He was beginning to wonder if maybe he was in some sort of coma and this was the dream state when they arrived at Megan’s home.  <br />
<br />
Megan’s family lived in a two story home, it was boxy but big. With a well manicured lawn, in one of the older but nicer parts of town.  Ryan didn’t know much about Megan’s family structure.  He could tell by the size of the house and the number of bedrooms that she was not an only child.  Ryan went upstairs and found the room with “Megan” in big bubble letters on the door.  He went in. Ryan had no idea what he was going to do.  Megan’s phone continued to ring as he sat in the room.  He looked, the text messages just kept coming in.  He was amazed by the number of messages of concern and offers “if she needed anything.” People had never been this nice to Ryan in his whole life.  Just because she had a nice form and bigger breast than the other girls her age. <br />
<br />
Out of curiosity Ryan started texting the people back.  Some of the names he knew, others he didn’t.  Letting them know he or rather Megan was ok. The text just never stopped. He scrolled down and it became obvious that some text hadn’t warranted a response from her.  Some boys had gotten ignored.  Ryan heard a knock on the door, it was Megan’s mother.  “Hun get changed and come down for a snack.  Ryan turned to the dresser and picked out a few items he thought worked together and began to strip.  <br />
<br />
Megan looked even better naked than with clothes.  After years with his ex-wife, Ryan was not use to seeing such a tight nubile body.  Everything held in place by muscle and taut skin.   Ryan looked down at Megan’s tight perfect vagina and wondered if anyone had been inside her yet. Ryan figured as long as he had Megan’s body he might want to explore it a little before figuring out how or even if he could get his back.</p>
