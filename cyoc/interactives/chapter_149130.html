<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The next few days had gone by in whirlwind of activity. Kaiden had moved in, having to sell a large amount of his old possessions to fit everything in just one room.<br />
The plus side was that all his recently gained money had covered his (significantly lower) rent for the entire year, paid in advance.<br />
Kaiden had even been able to fit his car in the garage, as only him and Jace drove, everyone else being full time students.<br />
Kaiden had gotten to know Jace, Ryan and Paul quite well, but he had barely met any of the other frat brothers, all of them being so shy and busy.<br />
<br />
Jace was studying sports medicine on a scholarship, and had become the leader of the Beta house as the oldest at the beginning of the year. The Beta reputation had also started with him, as one of the Alphas had torn his pants clear off him in an exhibition soccer match against another university. Jace&#39;s small dick had been shown to the entire campus on the college Jumbotron at the time, and pics had circulated around, causing friends to leave him and teachers to snub him, forcing him to <br />
work twice as hard for the A grades he needed for his scholarship.<br />
<br />
Ryan and Paul were both studying Business Law, with Ryan in his first year and Paul in his third mentoring the young man. They had rooms next to each other, ate, studied and socialized with each other, and Ryan had introduced Paul to the frat, after seeing each others cocks at the urinal during a night out drinking.<br />
<br />
Kaiden saw that these guys were genuine, kind and friendly. Not  deserving of the harsh treatment everyone threw their way. Yet he was struggling, as day one in class, one of the Alpha&#39;s named Jared had publicly interrupted the class to single him out, causing hoots of laughter and jeers. The lecturer couldn&#39;t maintain control.<br />
<br />
Kaiden had ended up storming off after 10 minutes as it was clear that the class wasn&#39;t going to continue and that the lecturer was unwilling or unable to discipline Jared. Heading into a bathroom, Kaiden had hidden in a stall, taking a few minutes to gather his breath and questioning his choice to join the Beta&#39;s.<br />
<br />
He had talked himself into staying as he only had one subject shared with undergrads and the rest were smaller groups and online assignments, so he wouldn&#39;t have to deal with the Alpha&#39;s anywhere near as much as the others. His thoughts lingered on Jace and the raw deal the poor bloke was suffering. Kaiden knew that as bad as things felt, ALL his frat brothers had it so much worse. <br />
He was barely there and had an average 6 inch cock. If Jace was to be believed, he outclassed every one of his fellow Beta&#39;s, by a good 2 inches.<br />
<br />
Standing up to leave, he heard a loud banging as someone rushed in, locking the main door behind them. <br />
“No, no, no. Calm down. Just another minute. Shit, shit, SHIT! Don&#39;t do this, oh fuck, oh fuck oh FUCK!”<br />
Kaiden peered through the crack in the stall to see an unfamiliar guy, with shaggy brown hair and geeky glasses tearing his belt off and undoing his fly. His 7.5 inch cock flopping out into the open.<br />
Although flopping wasn&#39;t really the best word. <br />
Flailing was more accurate.<br />
The guy&#39;s cock was lurching and flailing, while the geek talked and begged for it to stop, red faced and chest heaving. Kaiden&#39;s hand found its way down to his own hardening crotch as he stared mesmerized at the strange display, before he suddenly gasped.<br />
The guys cock was suddenly expanding.<br />
The geek look straight at kaiden, locking eyes, shock on his face, as his cock suddenly ballooned out, stretching out into the shape of a naked man, before suddenly separating from the geeks groin, leaving a small smooth bump in its place.<br />
“Oh fuck, oh fuck, oh fuck.” The geek rambled as the nude figure stumbled to his feet, looking around and suddenly dashing to the door.<br />
“No WAIT!” The geek cried out before the naked figure ran screaming down the empty corridor.<br />
<br />
A long moment of frozen terror sat on his face before he quickly did his pants and belt back up, talking directly to the stall Kaiden was in.<br />
“You better come out now, we have to leave before he comes back with someone, and you don&#39;t want to be corroborating his story unless you want to end up in the loony bin.”<br />
Kaiden slowly exited the stall, not sure what to say.<br />
<br />
“Don&#39;t say anything. No time for the long. The short. I&#39;m Dennis, that guy was turned into my dick against his will, I wasn&#39;t strong enough to keep him there and if we don&#39;t leave, everyone will think WE kidnapped and brainwashed him. I need an escape, you know the area better then me, I don&#39;t actually go here, I WILL bring you down with me if you don&#39;t help me. MOVE.”<br />
<br />
Stunned, Kaiden led him down the coridoor, out to the carpark and soon they were driving downtown.<br />
“Good.” Dennis said yawning.  “Drop me off downtown at the bus station and I&#39;ll leave town from there.”<br />
“What did you do to him?” Kaiden managed to whisper as Dennis started nodded off, his tired mind letting a short answer slip out before he started snoring. <br />
“Cock magic.”<br />
<br />
The rest of the drive was over quickly, however Kaiden waited a few minutes before waking Dennis up. His understanding of the world, and the infallibility of science had just been blown apart.<br />
<br />
“Thanks man. I know I came across as a bit of an asshole, blackmailing you and shit, but I was in over my head. I wasn&#39;t powerful enough to mess with this shit. Here, take this book, but be careful. That guy escaped after only an hour as my dick.” Dennis smiled as he hurried into the terminal, leaving the small printed book on Kaiden&#39;s seat.<br />
<br />
Hurrying home to the Beta house, and rushing to his room, Kaiden was finally ready to examine the book. The plain black cover had the word Phallomancy faintly written into it, barely visible without tilting the page slightly for the writing to shimmer.<br />
<br />
Opening the book, Kaiden almost laughed, finding its layout out just like a D & D lore book. Stories and spell details, a few tips and tricks written in pencil along the sides, but nothing formally fleshed out. Just like fantasy, the idea was that you simply had the power or didn&#39;t, although people often needed something to focus the energy on.<br />
<br />
Chuckling slightly Kaiden open his laptop, compiling the different tips together. <br />
1. The spell shouldn&#39;t be cast directly on the person, but through a reflection or lens. Many casters will need an item to assist focus of the energies to prevent misfiring.<br />
2. Depending on the spell, people would have full awareness, and if their willpower was great enough they control their new body and even possibly break the spell. <br />
3. Once merged, attuned, or turned, converted or otherwise changed &#39;Phallus-like&#39;, the subject will be totally, physically the mentioned body part, including the functions and sensations involved.<br />
4. The subject will not need sustenance if connected to a living person, or if independent, they will feed of the magic of the caster.<br />
5. The subjects willpower can be lowered by causing them to ejaculate while transformed.	<br />
	With each ejaculation flooding them with pleasure and draining their willpower.<br />
Kaiden laughed as this seemed just like a games formula. Where the number of inches inches + 1d8 was the number of times they had to cum to mentally break them, with the subject recovering 1 point every 24 hours they don&#39;t cum while transformed, and 3 every 24 hours they don&#39;t cum after returning to human.<br />
6. Once their willpower is broken, the transformation no longer required any energy to maintain, and if returned to human, they will require significant therapy or counseling to start regaining their humanity back.<br />
7. If the subject is pressed against another person groin while transformed, they replace the persons groin, which will regrow over 24-72 hours after the subject is removed. Longer times for longer time with the transformed cock.<br />
8. It is ideal for the caster to weaken the subjects mind quickly once transformed if they intend to prolong the transformation.<br />
9. An experienced caster cannot be transformed unless they are incapacitated prior. Natural sleep does not count.<br />
<br />
<br />
Seeing several more hints that were smudged and illegible, Kaiden started reading through the spells, finding the one Dennis used with the page dog eared. Merging someone with your own cock.<br />
Dennis had obviously tried to merge the unsuspecting person, but had not had the time to weaken them, being in a crowded college campus.<br />
 Flicking through the spells Kaiden found them to be small variations for the same theme. Temporarily shrink someones cock to grow their muscles, drain or steal some cock size, force someone&#39;s balls to be hyper productive for a day. <br />
Similar things all focused on manipulating the casters and or someone elses cock.<br />
<br />
However the last spell caught Kaiden&#39;s eye.<br />
<br />
Pure Phallomancy.<br />
<br />
With the word dicking written beside it in pencil.<br />
<br />
Kaiden read quickly. <br />
A high powered spell that will transform a persons entire body into a sentient version of their own cock and balls. They will have some limited movement, and will  have a telepathic link to the caster that diminishes with distance. This spell takes a lot of energy to perform, but once the target is weakened enough, is the only spell known that can be maintained indefinitely.<br />
<br />
CAUTION<br />
There are many potential side effects of such powerful magic, however there have been few strong enough to be able to study what is known, and they advise casters be secretive and selective.<br />
<br />
This was the spell Kaiden needed to know right now.<br />
His eyes flickered to the bottom of the page, as the words started glowing. The light causing his yellow tinted glasses to shine.<br />
Suddenly the knowledge was in his head, the way to access and manipulate the magic being played out inside his mind like a movie as he crawled to his bed. The entire room spinning around him.<br />
Kaiden laid down and fell into images, the spell forming itself inside his brain. Wordless and formless but undeniably powerful.<br />
<br />
When he awoke, It was Tuesday and he had to prepare for class.<br />
Kaiden stumbled to the bathroom, his bladder bursting full. <br />
He was vaguely aware of someone showering as he pissed, his head slowly settling from a night without any mental rest. <br />
As his bladder emptied his vision cleared, and with it came a heightened sense of awareness.<br />
He washed his hands in the sink and stared at his reflection, large dark brown eyes that glimmered in the light, a slight tan, a classically Italian jaw, short dark hair tussled from his restless sleep. <br />
Kaiden was not ugly in the slightest.<br />
<br />
A familiar face peered over the shower curtain, catching Kaiden by surprise. <br />
Jared.<br />
<br />
“Hey baby dick. Did you come to get a look at a REAL man&#39;s dick?”<br />
Jared leered as he pulled the curtain back revealing his tall 6 foot 5 frame,  strong arms, defined pecs, muscular thighs and his hard 8 inch dick in his hand.<br />
Kaiden stared incredulously. Why was Jared in their frat?!?”<br />
“Oh don&#39;t look so surprised ya limp dicked faggot. The Alpha house is out of hot water, I wanted a hot shower, and I told your buddy Jace I would slash both your cars tires if ya didn&#39;t let me shower.<br />
Didn&#39;t think I was going to get an audience.” Jared sneered as he his soaped up cock, his other hand spreading suds over his torso that streamed down his chest and legs.<br />
“Better yet, rather then wait for Jace to come and suck my dick in exchange for not trashing his car and spreading his little dicklet over the internet again, Why don&#39;t YOU get on you knees and choke on this thick man cock. I ain&#39;t gay, but watching one of you Beta&#39;s service a real man makes me feel nice and powerful. Because lets face it, the simple truth is fags like you were put on this planet to serve superior men like me.”<br />
<br />
Jared cackled as he wiggled his hips, not caring about the soap and water going all over the bathroom floor.<br />
“Why the hesitation? Don&#39;t worry, no one knows I&#39;m here, and no one would believe I would let a Beta touch my superior cock. Its just me, and you, on your knees, my cock down your throat.”<br />
<br />
Kaiden was still stunned. He was gay and Jared had a nice body and nice dick....<br />
But his admission to terrorizing Jace was beyond too far.<br />
A sharp stabbing pain in Kaiden&#39;s forehead suddenly  appeared as the spell he had learned in his sleep last night poured out of his, flowing from his eyes and building within his glasses.<br />
“what ya waiting for cup-BLURB?”<br />
Jared&#39;s words were cut off as his mouth suddenly overflowed with clear fluid, his hand no longer jerking his cock but somehow unable to release it.<br />
Jared stared for a long moment as suddenly his entire body drew into itself, a small puff of smoke erupted from where his body had been, as a small meaty thud drew Kaiden&#39;s attention downwards.<br />
<br />
Jared was now his own 8 inch fuck stick, his shaft and average balls lying in the bottom of the shower.<br />
“Oh. Hey Kaiden, what are you doing in here?”<br />
Jace appeared, surprised to see Kaiden and looking visibly shaken.<br />
“Oh, I&#39;m, I&#39;m, just about to take a shower. Sorry Jace, I-I forgot to close the door.”<br />
Jace stared quizzically at Kaiden, briefly glancing in the shower and seeing it was empty before stepping backwards.<br />
“Allright. I just thought someone else was in here. Someone I needed to chat with urgently. Ah, never mind. I&#39;ll catch you later Kade&#39;s” Jace said as he retreated.<br />
Kaiden sighed as the door closed. He had just dicked the intruding Alpha on his attempt, and managed to hide the fact.<br />
<br />
Looking around, Kaiden realized he needed to shower after saying as much to Jace. Quickly stripping down, he stepped under the warm water, and gently picked up Jared&#39;s hard, leaking form.<br />
<br />
Merely looking at Jared, Kaiden could hear his thoughts, and immediately decided not to listen until the leaky dick calmed down and stopped mentally screaming. <br />
<br />
“Hey Jared.” He whispered as he started massaging this full balls while stroking the long shaft.<br />
“The simple truths is, cocks like you were put on this planet to serve superior men like me. So shut up and enjoy being nothing but a big, hard, leaky, cock.”<br />
<br />
Stroking faster and faster, it only took Kaiden a few short minutes to bring Jared over the edge, the disembodied cock spraying his load all over the shower wall.<br />
Kaiden listened in, and hearing the mental noise silenced by the overwhelming pleasure of a full body orgasm, proceeded to shower, before sneaking Jared back into his room.<br />
<br />
Kaiden laid Jared down on the bed, before checking his schedule. He only had afternoon classes, which he could stream online, and doing the mental math. Jared would take anywhere from 9-16 total ejaculations to break provided he didn&#39;t get any rest time. <br />
Kaiden briefly wondered about how much energy  was needed to maintain the transformation, and the sharp stinging in his head returned, but slightly less then before.<br />
The other thing that hit Kaiden, was a sudden thirst, and looking down at Jared he knew what would quench it.<br />
<br />
<br />
Three hours later and Kaiden had finally cum himself, having jerked off, sucked off and even fucked himself with the disembodied Jared cock. <br />
He had now made Jared cum a total of 7 times. The stinging in his head had continued to ease with each time Jared came, but more with each time Jared&#39;s cum ended up inside Kaiden.<br />
He had tuned his mind back in on Jared, getting off on the cycle of begging and pleading, followed by his reluctant hardening,  his slow acceptance of the pleasure rocking through his entire body, followed by a frenzied begging for permission to cum, permission which Kaiden had started with holding, letting the lust madness consume Jared more and more.<br />
<br />
Right now Jared&#39;s mind lay blank as he bathed in the afterglow of so many loads, his balls completely empty.<br />
Kaiden knew he would need to head off to class, but had a plan for tonight to continue the changes.<br />
The first step was to ensure Jared wouldn&#39;t go anywhere without Kaiden knowing. <br />
So picking him up, Kaiden pressed Jared&#39;s now limp but still substantial cock against his own, feeling the strange sensation of his own cock receding and the feelings of Jared&#39;s spent cock and slightly aching balls flowed into his body.<br />
Jared was spent for the time being.<br />
<br />
Smiling, Kaiden left for his classes.<br />
<br />
<br />
 <br />
Later that evening, Kaiden had showered again, and gently removed Jared from his groin. The headache was pretty much gone, and strangely enough, the smooth bump left on his groin was starting to reform into his cock and balls. Having reached a full inch of growth after 3 hours.<br />
<br />
Kaiden put on a jockstrap and lubed up Jared, sliding him into his whole and slowly bouncing him self up and down. Mentally he was listening to the man&#39;s plea&#39;s for mercy. Jared realizing that the insane pleasure was wiping his mind and each time he came, he lost more of himself.<br />
He could hear Jared&#39;s fear, and also his growing lust. Jared couldn&#39;t get enough of Kaiden&#39;s ass, and within 2 hours had cum another 4 times, bringing the total to 11 times.<br />
Kaiden was tempted to push for another two or three loads up his ass, but he had decided that Jared was going to pay Jace back for his torment.<br />
<br />
Cleaning Jared up, Kaiden crept downstairs and found Jace having a nap on the couch by himself. Perfect he thought as he edged forward, pulling Jared out of his jacket pocket.<br />
Realizing that he wasn&#39;t going to be able to pull Jace&#39;s running shorts down, Kaiden check by lifting the material up by the leg, and found Jace was free balling under his shorts.<br />
Jackpot.<br />
Stroking Jared to hardness again, he slid Jared&#39;s shaft and balls up Jace&#39;s thigh, a sudden bit of suction pulling Jared&#39;s last inch from Kaiden&#39;s hand. Jared was attached.<br />
Gently fondling Jared&#39;s cock head, Kaiden smiled as pre cum started to leak from the head.<br />
“Mate, why are you fondling my cock?” Jace said through sleepy eyes as he started to sit up.<br />
Kaiden stepped back, not sure what to say, so he just turned around to run, his shorts catching on the door handle and tearing. <br />
With his muscular, jock strap framed ass on display to his frat brother, Kaiden went bright red before running upstairs.<br />
<br />
10 minutes later Jace barged into Kaiden&#39;s room, naked, hard and with a strange look in his eyes.<br />
“Now I&#39;m no expert on dick, but Ive had THIS fucker shoved down my throat too many times to not recognize its Jared&#39;s dick. What I really want to know is why I can hear Jared in my head, and why he is so hard and leaky for your meaty ass?”<br />
Kaiden&#39;s heart was pounding in his chest as he stepped forward, gently stroking Jared&#39;s shaft, smearing his pre cum all over himself, as he whispered into Jace&#39;s ear.<br />
“He&#39;s a total dickhead, and if you cum enough times with him  over the next few days, he&#39;ll stay your big leaky cock.”<br />
“That right?” Jace said, his tongue licking his lips as he grabbed Kaiden&#39;s still bare ass.<br />
“You gonna help me with that?” Jace&#39;s breath hot in Kaidens ear before he pushed him to the bed and lifted his legs over his shoulders.<br />
“I&#39;ve always wanted to be a top.” Jace said with a hungry look in his eyes as he slowly sunk his new cock inside Kaiden&#39;s ass, the pleasure clear on his face as he started using long deep strokes for the first time in his life.<br />
<br />
“So how many times I gotta make the bastard cum to keep him as my dick?”<br />
He asked, his hips picking up the pace and preventing Kaiden from answering as his own mind was drowning in pleasure.<br />
<br />
Leaning down, his ears right next to Kaiden&#39;s, Jace times his words with his thrusts.<br />
How. Many. Times. Do. I. Need. To. Make. Him. Cum. Before. He. Stays. My. Cock. Forever!<br />
<br />
“Oh, fuck! Anywhere from once to five times tonight.” Kaiden stammered out as his own regrowing cocklet threatened to cum within his jockstrap.<br />
“Then buckle up Kade&#39;s, I&#39;m dumping all 5 loads inside this nice fucking ass tonight.”</p>
