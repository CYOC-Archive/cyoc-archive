<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Melissa was having brunch with her best gay friend Copri when she got a text message &quot;Press *this* word and you and whatever friends you have with you to a beach resort where anything you want can happen.&quot; It was from Johnny... still this seemed a lot like a scam. Maybe he was hacked? Then there was a picture of Chris and some pretty girl with large breasts smiling at a beach resort with a table full of food. <br />
Melissa asked &quot;Hey Copri your an engineer and do you know if deep fake technology can make a picture like this?&quot; Melissa then showed her phone to Copri who said &quot;Unless you think that guy doesn&#39;t look odd. Probably not, although I&#39;m wondering if the girl&#39;s body was photoshopped a little. Still I&#39;m not sure how much I&#39;d trust it.&quot; <br />
Melissa went for a different approach and texted back &quot;Hey Johnny, you might be hacked.&quot; <br />
Johnny texted back &quot;I wasn&#39;t. I&#39;m being serious, You turned me down because you &quot;you&#39;re a good looking guy, but I only swing for girls.&quot; right?&quot; <br />
Melissa angled the phone to Copri who said &quot;Was those words recorded in anyway? or something someone else could have heard and gossiped about?&quot; Melissa shook her head and said &quot;I don&#39;t see how some random hackers would know about a specific phrase.&quot;<br />
Melissa said &quot;Well... I trust him so...&quot; Melissa tapped the button and a few minutes later their server was wondering where the two Brunchers went to as he brought their food. <br />
<br />
Back at the island Johnny, Chris, and Christine were waiting around Johnny and Christine still having their genders swapped and Chris having returned to his normal form... With maybe his genitals kept the same as punishment for annoying Johnny. Then as Melissa tapped the button she and Copri were teleported in a sitting position with their feet touching the sand of the beach... Meaning they fell a few feet onto their asses. A bit of cursing later the two newly inductees were staring around. Copri said &quot;...That actually was truthful... how?&quot; <br />
Johnny said &quot;I recently got powers to do whatever I want so... I didn&#39;t know what to do and decided to invite you here Melissa... whose that?&quot; <br />
Melissa arched her eyebrow and asked &quot;Well... He&#39;s my gay bestie and you are?&quot; <br />
Johnny realized she didn&#39;t know anything and said &quot;Well... I&#39;m Johnny... I guess... maybe I should figure out a new name...I made a gender booth for my sexually confused friend Christine here and then she brought me in while I slept and.... This has kinda stuck for now...&quot;  <br />
Melissa looked back to Copri who looked like he was about to burst a gasket and asked &quot;Wait you have a... gender booth?&quot; <br />
&quot;Sex Chamber!&quot; Chris stated <br />
Copri asked &quot;How does that even work?&quot;<br />
Christine said &quot;You just push a button an-&quot;<br />
&quot;I get he idea!&quot; Copri snapped and then he took a few deep breathes and asked &quot;But what about the mechanisms? The button is the input and I assume the output is a sex change, but what about the middle? What turns a button press into a sex change?&quot; <br />
Eyes went to Johnny who questioningly stated &quot;Magic?&quot; I was an honest answer that might have some truth, but Melissa could tell that answer was frustrating to Copri who was now looking at some super tech. <br />
Melissa asked &quot;Or... Did you use magic to make that hyper tech?&quot;<br />
Johnny said &quot;I guess I just willed it into existence? Maybe it doesn&#39;t run on magic?&quot;<br />
&quot;Toolset...&quot; Copri stated <br />
&quot;huh?&quot; Johnny asked<br />
&quot;I need Tools to figure out what makes that thing tick...&quot; Copri restated <br />
Johnny held out her hand and a box materialized and said &quot;Just think about what tool you need an-&quot; Johnny could tell that was a slight mistake since she could see Copri&#39;s brain start to hypothesize about the new tool box. <br />
Melissa said &quot;Copri one thing at the time. The sex chamber!&quot;<br />
Copri said &quot;Right... the sex chamber... how does that even work?&quot;<br />
<br />
Johnny pointed to the sex chamber and said &quot;It&#39;s right over there.&quot;<br />
Melissa a nurse asked &quot;Say... does that thing have any side effects?&quot;<br />
Johnny thought and said &quot;...I don&#39;t know... I didn&#39;t intend for any side effects...&quot; <br />
Melissa said &quot;Well then mind if I tried? Always wondered how having a dick felt!&quot; <br />
Johnny said &quot;go ahead... It&#39;s not running out of power or anything... I think...&quot; and the woman wondered if she should stop giving Copri more information about the fantastical powers of this machine. Melissa went inside, and she was pretty visible from the outside and with a press of the button she immediately turned into a hairy man with a pair of slacks and Hawaiian shirt on. <br />
Copri muttered &quot;Instantaneous, whatever is changing user is unobvious, whatever is emitted is unobivous...&quot; <br />
Melissa was enjoying her foot and a half of height over Johnny as he chuckled and enjoyed his new physique. He was also somewhat enjoying the form of someone of the opposite gender for once before Christine was starting to get a little jealous, and the two ended up getting into a bit of a fight. Mostly wrestling although Johnny just watched in concern while Chris cheered the two on. Copri on the other hand went into the booth examining what he could. The whole booth looked like mostly a thin frame with a lot of glass... Nothing that you could hide most anything in... So basic estimations put the area with the button as the place where any amount of electronics would be in... <br />
<br />
Everyone was enjoying themselves, although while everyone outside of the booth were having a ton of fun watching the fight in one way or another Copri was excited as he dismantled the front of the box bit by bit... He carefully removed the plating and found a black box with wiring connecting it to the sex change button. Thrilling excitement came as Copri would start to attempt to open the black box with a tool designed to just cut open the surface of the black box and... <br />
&quot;She&#39;s my girlfriend!&quot; Christine yelled as he managed to roll on top. <br />
Meanwhile Melissa said &quot;Well she&#39;s cute! and this is-&quot; and then there seemed to be a boom from the sex chamber. The booth itself was completely intact for the most part. The thing that wasn&#39;t intact was the sex button which was dangling off the chamber&#39;s far side with a bunch of random springs and wiring exposed. Melissa went in first concerned about his gay best friend and then saw a woman on the ground looking a little dazed with a massive rack, tiny waist, and wide hips that had mostly burst out of Copri&#39;s regular clothes. Those exposed nipples, and clothes ripped and barely clinging to that woman&#39;s thighs was starting to give the new man a hardon in a way Melissa hadn&#39;t expected. Melissa crouched and asked &quot;Are you ok? Copri?&quot; <br />
Copri dazed asked &quot;What happened?&quot; <br />
&quot;An explosion happened and you turned into a woman!&quot; <br />
&quot;huh?&quot; Copri looked around and saw the mess she had made and then... looked down and blushed. Her voice starting to crack &quot;What happened!?! Shouldn&#39;t my clothes have changed too?!? How will we change back!!!?!!!!&quot; <br />
Johnny followed shortly after and said &quot;I could just change you all back... probably revert the sex chamber as well...&quot; <br />
Copri covering herself a bit better said &quot;Great, could you just-&quot; and then found that her clothes changed into a rather revealing blue bikini which made her want to cover herself up even more. <br />
&quot;Not gonna though... Least not right now. I just want everyone here to make suggestions and have fun... Also the Sex Chamber just became a lot more annoying than I imagined...&quot; Johnny said as she folded her arms. <br />
<br />
Copri saw Melissa offer her a hand up and she took the hand and as she rose she felt like her whole body was jiggling even though it was mostly just her oversized breasts and ass. Melissa&#39;s male form was what Copri looked for in a man. Being bigger and comforting... Meanwhile Melissa&#39;s junk were going crazy over Copri&#39;s somewhat inflated form. <br />
Copri looked out and asked &quot;We&#39;re still... just gay besties right?&quot; <br />
Melissa said &quot;I think we may be straight now, but... yeah...&quot; The two &quot;gay besties&quot; walked out together feeling awkward more because of the other&#39;s gender change than their own.</p>
