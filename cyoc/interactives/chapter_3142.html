<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kirk's father had always been athletic.  He'd been in the Marine Corps and served as the local high school's football coach before becoming a professional gym owner.  At 35, he was a prime example of manhood.  Jesse decided to pay him a visit at work.
<br />

<br />
Jesse approached Kirk's father, Eli.  Eli had short, dark, lustrous hair sticking up a few short clumps up top, but mostly smooth and uniform black, shaved close on the sides, and was positively massive.  His arms were especially impressive, they were both long and meaty, bulging out on top and bottom (he was wearing a sleeveless shirt), and they were tanned just enough to make them lustrous as well in the dim gym lights.  Jesse wanted to lick the sweat off them, and thought that later, perhaps that could be arranged.  Eli had hollowed eyes, very Italian, and looked very approving upon himself in a nearby mirror, hunched on a dusty leather gym belt, and wore a flimsy tank top and an excellently shadowed 2-day old beard, which he scraped with his hands as he watched his underlings clean equipment.  Jesse looked hungrily on Eli's wide chest that rounded nicely to form a bulge of muscle that lifted his shirt off his chest...scraggly wires of chest hair peeked out, not too much and not too little...the man looked like he could to any trade with rigour and confidence.  He'd look good with a couple power tools around him, and draped with black leather vest and matching pants, thought Jesse.
<br />

<br />
&quot;Hey, man.&quot;
<br />

<br />
&quot;Hey.&quot;
<br />

<br />
&quot;Hey, you don't know me, but...our kids know one another.&quot;
<br />

<br />
&quot;Oh yeah?&quot;
<br />

<br />
&quot;Yeah, Kirk is friends with my little Tyler.  That's him waiting outside,&quot; said Jesse, waving hi.  Tyler looked up from his gameboy and managed a smile and a wave.  He hated the thought that he couldn't go into the gym and strut his stuff anymore.  Stupid Jesse.  He still felt like he had *some* freedom as a child, but the overwhelming truth that Jesse could now tell him what to do, and did, without even a thought!...well, it made him seethe with jealousy.  Well, it couldn't last forever.  He'd grow up eventually, in just a few years.  For now he should just grin and bear it.  Shouldn't he?  After all, what could he do?
<br />

<br />
Inside, Jesse struck up a rapport with Eli concerning Tyler and Kirk.  
<br />

<br />
&quot;You know, we outta get those kids in here together, get em' started young.&quot;
<br />

<br />
&quot;I know man, I know,&quot; agreed Eli, smiling.  &quot;But what're ya gonna do...your kid, he looks like he could be an athlete, you know, but mine?  I love im' but he takes after his mom.  Doesn't stick up for himself, doesn't want to.  It's pathetic.  He's so little for his age.  I try and get him into sports and tell him what can happen when you work out, how he should do it because its the only way anyone'll ever look up to ya.  You know, man, cause you know the score.  You work out like we do, and you become a wanted man, you know?&quot;  He smiled.  Jesse sighed inwardly at the crinkles in his face, the crust of his beard, freshly dewed with sweat beads.  &quot;I mean,&quot; continued Eli, there's this whole world out there, but guys like you and me, we pretty much rule it without a doubt.&quot;
<br />

<br />
&quot;Yeah, you know...we should get together some time.&quot;
<br />

<br />
&quot;Totally man, totally.&quot;
<br />

<br />
&quot;Well I'll see you around.  And you know, I think Kirk just might get into bodybuilding yet.&quot;
<br />

<br />
They smiled and parted ways. 
<br />

<br />
&quot;What was that all about?&quot; asked Tyler.
<br />

<br />
&quot;I'm just tryin' to make new friends, that's all.&quot; said Jesse, keying up the car.  &quot;All my old ones were little kids...it'd be weird if it were to stay that way, you know what I mean?&quot;  Jesse smiled and Tyler shifted uncomfortably in the passenger's seat.  JEsse certainly had taken to driving and was now doing it with panache.  He'd been settling into the dominant role, with too much zeal, he realized.  He didn't like it.  He felt jealousy and resentment burn within him.  
<br />

<br />
That night Kirk dug through all the drawers in his father's study, and sure enough found some of the vouchers.  According to his father's livejournal (he'd been reading it for quite some time without his father even knowing...he may suck at sports but he was expert at computer navigation, etc) the vouchers were meant to be originally used years from now...when Eli was older he intended to switch with some poor young sap and become a 20 year old stud again.
<br />

<br />
Little did he know his son had other plans.  Kirk rubbed one of the vouchers and made his wish.  Amazingly it combusted, the fire startling Kirk.  He stamped it out with his foot.  Nothing happened.
<br />

<br />
He went to bed that night as usual.  He didn't feel any different, and his heart raced with anticipation.  When he woke up...when he woke up the world would be different.  Or so he hoped.  Hoped with every fiber of his being like he'd never hoped for anything before.  Could this really work?  He could hardly stand the excitement!
<br />

<br />
He finally fell asleep and dreamed strange dreams of running and pulling large objects and testing his body to incredible limits and acheiving incredible feats of strength...his body large and unchallenged.
<br />

<br />
In the morning he awoke.  He was struggling to remember what was going on.  He was in his father's bed.  Had he had a nightmare and crept in during the middle of the night?  He stumbled over the side and grumbled.  It was so deep he felt like he must have a head cold or something.  Worried he walked across the room in a blur, without his glasses and surprisingly everything was clear and unproblemed.  He stood still, very still.  The door.  He was...it appeared to have shrunk!  But how could that be?
<br />

<br />
He was taller.  He rubbed his bristly chin.  Bristly?  How and what?  What was on his face?  MY GOD, he thought and looked down.  His legs were covered with scawling hair, making it's way down.  He knelt down and scratched at it, tugged a few to make sure they were real.  He stood back up again.  He hopped on one foot.  He walked precariously into the bathroom, and the image that stared back at him was that of a hunk.  His father.  Breathless, he took off his shirt, and rubbed his smooth, massive pecs.  
<br />

<br />
&quot;Oh my God,&quot; he said, with his father's voice.  He flexed a bicep.  He couldn't believe how round it was, how solid.  How everything coursing through him felt of power and strength.  He felt ENERGY! Stamina!  He felt like he could run for ten miles and not even drop.  He felt like he could fight anyone, anytime.  In fact, he kind of wanted to.  Unfamiliar urges flowed through him.  He made his way over to his new bed and it groaned under his weight.  He immediately began to masturbate, stroking his now engorged penis (god, my dad is hung!, he thought) and smiled, feeling his new stubble proudly.  He stroked and stroked until he came.  He made his way over to the bathroom again.  Lucky for him he had no mother, and that this plan was so perfect.
<br />

<br />
Now, the confrontation with his father, trapped in his body was inevitable.  It was going to be amazing.  Absolutely amazing! He got on a pair of navy blue boxer shorts and headed out.
<br />

<br />
&quot;Hey!  Hey, get up!  Hey, get your ass out of bed!&quot; he commanded in his strong adult voice.  &quot;Little pissant.  How's it feel now, huh?  How's it feel to be the one who's smaller??!&quot;
<br />

<br />
The child in the bed had just been waking up and was now fully alert, standing up on the bed. 
<br />

<br />
&quot;This can't be happening.&quot; he said, wide eyed and afraid.
<br />

<br />
&quot;Oh but it is,&quot; said Kirk, sticking his glasses on his father's head.  &quot;I used YOUR vouchers to make this happen and now you're stuck this way unless I say different.  So march into that bathroom and get changed.  Cause you're going to go to SCHOOL today, mister!&quot;
<br />

<br />
&quot;No!  You can't do this!&quot; screeched Eli trapped in Kirk's body.
<br />

<br />
&quot;I can do anything I want, squirt.  I'm your DADDY now,&quot; he said smiling.  Get used to it.&quot;
<br />

<br />
&quot;This isn't possible!  You can't do this!  Think of what'll happen!&quot;
<br />

<br />
&quot;Oh I already have, dad&quot; said the grown man to the little boy.  &quot;And I like my odds.  So unless you wanna be billed as the local crazy you'll start answering to the name Kirk, and you won't say anything about any of this to no one.  So...how's it feel?  Huh?  You always came down on me for not being like you?  Well NOW I AM!&quot;  the son finished in his father's beaming body, showing off his new bicep.
<br />

<br />
&quot;You can't do this.  It's unnatural!&quot;
<br />

<br />
&quot;What??  YOU were gonna do it...I read it on your journal.  Well now the tables have turned.  Get crackin.  You have tests today.  And a meeting with the local community center.  I think I'll sign you up for a few...classes.  Now go.  Get dressed and ready to go. March!&quot; Kirk demanded, now asserting his control.  Astonished, his father backed away.
<br />

<br />
&quot;You aren't thinking clearly,&quot; he said, getting dressed.  &quot;I CAN'T be you.  People will notice the difference in personality!  And...and we aren't meant to live as each other.&quot;
<br />

<br />
&quot;Well we ARE going to for a while.  I really LIKE being an adult for once, and you are going to do EXACTLY what I say, when I say it and don't you forget it.&quot;
<br />

<br />
&quot;Fine!  But this is ONLY temporary.&quot;
<br />

<br />
&quot;If I SAY it's temporary,&quot; said Kirk admonishingly, crossing his arms.  &quot;And I don't like your tone.  From now on, you will be more respectful of me, and my age.  I'm your elder, and don't you forget it.&quot;
<br />

<br />
Exasperated, his father put on schoolclothes and got his backpack.  
<br />

<br />
&quot;Good.  Let's head out.&quot;
<br />

<br />
&quot;Uh...I think you're forgetting something.  You have no idea how to drive!&quot;
<br />

<br />
&quot;That's why we're getting a ride.&quot; Kirk said, shutting the door behind him.  Waving from a red truck was Jesse, who opened a door and stepped out.  
<br />

<br />
&quot;Hey, son.  Ready for a big day?  Your pop and I are gonna teach you how to play football, it'll be lotsa fun.&quot;  Jesse patted Eli's shoulders.  And the three set off for what was to be a very momentous day.</p>
