<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Sarah did as Mike instructed and stepped away from the other two.  Her arms lifted her top over her head and dropped it on the floor.  She was not wearing a bra and her smallish breasts hung free in cool air.<br />
<br />
&quot;OK, Sarah.  Don't worry this will be really fun.  For me.  But I don't intend to hurt you too badly.  I'm kind of a geek and I like sexy, cartoonish girls.  So I want your breasts to grow now.  To be like two large, tight balloons that sit on your chest round and fake.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kimmy groaned at Mike's words.  He shot her a look saying he did not want to be judged.  She glared at him in boredom, that said he was not very original and sexist and misogynistic.  He smiled in a way that said he did not care and neither should she.  Kimmy lifted her hand and tried to stay detached from the scene.  Whenever Mike finished talking Kimmy would twitch a finger and the magic did the rest.<br />
<br />
Sarah's breasts inflated.  They soon took on the size indicated and were indeed round and fake looking.  Her nipples seemed to stand out like thick nobs that begged to be looked at if not played with.  Her entire rib-cage was subsumed by her round tits.  If Sarah could whimper she would have.<br />
<br />
&quot;Next, I want your hair to be pink.  Not really pink, but lightish-pink.  Like a baby-girls room sort of pink.  And it should be cut in a short bob-that frames your face nicely.  You would look good with short hair.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sarah could feel her scalp tingling as her hair shortened.  Her head became lighter and she wanted to shake the few strands that had fallen into view, away.  But she could not move and she saw them turn a lovely warm pink.<br />
<br />
&quot;Next I want you to have two white-furred cat-ears on the top of your head.  Not realistic ones, but ones that look like costume ears but more real.  Does that make sense?  They should feel good to have and to touch but they don't have to be real ears.  You can keep your other ones but they are always hidden by your hair.&quot;<br />
<br />
Her hair moved as two triangles of fur-covered flesh sprouted out.  Her ears were covered and she wanted to touch the new-fake ones just to see how sensitive they were.  When he released her the first thing she would do was find a mirror.<br />
<br />
&quot;And now just so you really fit the bill, a cat-tail will form on you just out from the top of your but.  It should move normally but never get in your way.  You can feel it like any other part of your body but you really don't much active control over it.  It will swish when you walk and flick when you stand and it will tuck under and wrap about your leg when you sit or lay down.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sarah felt her white skirt shift down low on her hips as a new appendage grew out of her lower-back.  It was long, she could guess because it touched her calf.  But it was soft and fuzzy and warm like her little Gus when she was a child.  Sarah did not want to admit to it but she was almost happy with this change.  Her tail sprung to life and swished in a way that said she was happy.<br />
<br />
&quot;OK, so that is really hot.  Sexy to me at least.  I hope you like it.  And it is just normal enough to fool others.  But I don't want to ruin your life so let's give you some triggers to bring it out and put it away.  Alright?  First, you will normally be your plain old Sarah.  But whenever you drink beer you will start to change.  Your first sip of beer will cause your breasts to grow to the size they are slowly finishing about when you finish the beer.  When you are a third of the way done the beer your hair will become this lovely pink bob.  When you finish two thirds of your beer you will grow the ears back and the tail pops out when you finish the glass.  Second, the hair, ears and tail will last until you have two full hours of sleep.  The breasts will last until you have an orgasm.  Do you play with yourself Sarah?  You might have to start.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sarah felt her body tingle and become less sure of its state.  Things would now change and her body would be always in question.  It sucked that she like to drink.<br />
<br />
&quot;OK, Dares.  One, you will always drink at least one beer whenever you eat pizza.  Two, you will forget and never noticed that beer is the trigger for your changes.  Three, you will love being topless whenever it is possible for more than like ten minutes, especially when you are at home.  I think that covers it.  No wait, you will also not want to harm me and will not want to hunt me down and exact revenge.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sarah felt the changes take hold and stood aside as she was directed.  She watched as her friends were changed also.  Steph was given almost the exact same treatment.  Her hair became light-purple and her bangs were forced to fall over one eye all the time.  Her cat-ears were smoky-gray and one was instructed to curl over slightly all the time.  Her tail, like Sarah's played about her legs but it was fluffier. Steph's tits became large globes just like her own.  Mike seemed to really like big tits.  Steph's triggers were the same as was her dares.<br />
<br />
Cloe was slightly different.  Her breasts became the third matching pair of huge and fake balloons.  Her hair became deep-red and long.  It fell about her face like a lion's mane and reached down her back.  Her ears were round, yellow and spotted with oval, brown marks.  Her tail was long and spotted like her ears, becoming almost ringed by the tip.  She looked like a wild-cat to the other two's placid house cats.  Cloe was given was given similar ending triggers but her activation one involved her being angry or excited.  Mike also added a subtle trick that she would feel a tickle on her left nipple when ever she heard the word 'integrate or integral' and on her right nipple when she heard 'differentiate or differential.'  That would be some fun for her calculus courses.<br />
<br />
When the three were done Mike bid them all adieu, and left with Kimmy.  They went upstairs to find other girls.  A minute passed and then all three found themselves able to move again.  Their bodies reverted to normal and they could move.  Looking at each other they soon notice that they were topless.  But to each of them it did not seem necessary to return to being fully clothed.  The smell of pizza reminded them of why they had come down in the first place.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let's eat,&quot; said Cloe diving in.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll get some beer out of the fridge,&quot; Sarah said.  She could never eat pizza with out beer.</p>
