<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">    You let Lady Lyaa take the lead as the three of you walked towards the main council chamber which you were told by Lyaa to be one of the largest rooms within the castle excluding Lord Hugenstore&#39;s throne room.<br />
<br />
     You made idle chatter with Lady Lyaa always being polite and attentive to her as she is the wife of your Master. Despite her natural charm and confidence it seemed that more often than not her .... &quot;Spoiled&quot; features always seemed to pop up in front of any positive traits she had. Every other sentence always had some form of boasting or gossip within it making you wonder what made Master Harauphar choose her for a wife, much less have a child with her. Was it a political marriage? Or perhaps simply for Lady Lyaa&#39;s looks?<br />
<br />
        You kept thinking, nodding and occasionally replying to Lady Lyaa and her rants about various things from politics to even some of the techniques Lady Lyaa uses in bed<br />
(The fact that she decided to tell you this makes you suspicious of how faithful she is to Master Harauphar but you felt that was a story for another time.<br />
<br />
           As you both neared to the council room the activity seemed to increase. Various members of the castle staff rushed through the halls and you saw various politicians and the occasional mage walk through the halls with an air of prosperity and wealth. Whenever you used your soulsight your vision was nearly overwhelmed by the dozens of souls that surrounded you, most of them a pale white but the souls of any mages were of a variety of colors that almost made you drool as you imagined how their souls must taste. Lady Lyaa walked through the gathering crowd of servants bustling in and out of the large oak doors that lead to the council room. The servants recognized Lady Lyaa immediately and they almost seemed part like flowing water when Lyaa neared, giving both of you room as you two entered the council room with you immediately going in awe of the sheer magnificence of the room.<br />
<br />
     In here magic seemed to flow everywhere just like within the city walls of Bettsworth itself.  Magical artifacts littered the walls of the council room which unlike the regular stone walls of the castle, the walls within the domed room seemed to be made of a shiny golden material that almost seemed to glow with a white aura basking the room in a pure light without the need for any windows of torches. Speaking of which, the air inside the council room was fresh and crisp just like the air of a spring forest. You took several deep breathes almost tasting the air and it&#39;s nearly rejuvenating feel.<br />
<br />
             The general layout of the council  was similar to that of a court room. In the center was a podium where presumably one would give their speech to the audience within the stands and the raised eleven seats ahead of the podium that was were presumably for Lord Hugenstore and his collection of the Nine Royal Mages sat as well.  (The eleventh seat belongs to Lord Hugenstore&#39;s wife)<br />
<br />
   Several politicians sat down on the side stands waiting for the meeting to begin. Lady Lyaa had already left your side, moving to one of the stands to take a seat with Sara still in her arms. <br />
<br />
   Looking up on the main platform once more where the ten seats were you saw Master Harauphar already sitting down on his seat motioning towards you to come to him. At the moment Harauphar was the only one sitting down on the main platform of the council room. <br />
<br />
  Strange I didn&#39;t see him there before.<br />
<br />
           You move to the side of the room, making your war to the other side as you go up the soft carpet stairs that led up to the main platform. Master Harauphar nodded to you not saying a word as the final members needed to start the monthly council meeting began.<br />
<br />
        Master Harauphar waved to a standing servant nearby, who promptly laded down a cushion for you to sit on the floor. You take a seat and make yourself comfortable as several figures emerged from the oak doors. One of them you recognized as the frost wolf Organa walking in time beside another man,  tall and lanky with a unkept beard and wearing several necklaces. He wore a fine cyan vestments and a quick sight of his soul revealed to you his soul, a swirling mass of powerful blue energy that seemed to periodically speed up and slow down.<br />
<br />
  To his right was a another human male this time much more horrendous and strange. This man was short and plump, wearing a loose tunic that was too small for him, revealing his bloated purple belly.  His Features were distorted and mutated in a way, his hair seemed to ooze a purple slime and you saw several mushroom clusters growing off of seemingly random parts of his body. You didn&#39;t even need to use your soul sight to confirm that this man was a hivemind like the one you faced before and most likely the Royal Mage who was both a peer and rival to Master Harauphar. Turning around to see your Master you see Harauphar give a small sneer to the hivemind who promptly gave him a smirk back once they made eye contact, the hivemind still not noticing you yet.<br />
<br />
      On the other side of the group was a man wearing pure white cloak that completely covered his face. All you could tell was that he was tall and had a confident stride in him. His soul was a pure silver, unmoving and almost reflective in its visible texture. Beside him was a woman around her forties, with pure black hair and a bit of a limp in her left foot. Her soul was a mixture of several colors including black, white, and silver.<br />
<br />
    In the very center of the group was the man who had the most confident strike imaginable and the man who most resembled like a fat pig who could barely walk. Wearing royal vestments and jewelry that practically flowed with arcane power, he led the other figures up to the main platform where you and Harauphar were sitting on now, occasionally having to stop for the man to take a breath.<br />
<br />
  When the group arrived to the top of the platform, they all sat in their respective seats. The fat man who you were sure by now was Lord Hugenstore taking the central seat which was also the fanciest of them all. The hivemind mage sat the furthest from Hugenstore on the last seat on the right, the hooded figure sat two seats to the left of you and Harauphar (Harauphar was about three seats on the right from the center) with his female companion standing next to him, not sitting down. <br />
<br />
  Organa and the man who was presumably her master sat to the right of Master Harauphar. Organa gave you a sly wink as she sat down beside her master. Almost immediately you felt your erection begin to stir so you promptly looked away from Organa, waiting for the meeting to begin.</p>
