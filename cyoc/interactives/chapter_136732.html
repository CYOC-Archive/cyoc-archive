<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Authors Note: I kind of like the idea that the 2nd to previous person had to my story, so I’ve adapted it a bit. So the main character is now Jodie, Angela is controlling everything that is happening. Anyways enjoy what I and others manage to create.<br />
<br />
Jodie said, “Who are you guys??”<br />
“I’m Carl,” said a brown haired kid with a fairly muscular physique,<br />
“I’m Jenny,” said a girl with tan skin and C cup breasts,<br />
“I’m Rupert,” said a blonde haired kid who was pretty scrawny, he had glasses and a very slim physique,<br />
Jodie had a pretty fine body in her opinion, she had a pretty fine chest and was confident about it. Except she was currently in virtually the end of the world.<br />
<br />
They all spoke for a little while and then looked out the window of the Pizza shop. They saw that there were other teens in the building across the street from them. “Should we run over there??” Said Carl,<br />
“No, lets let the, come to us,” said Jenny, she motioned them to come over. One of them who was a black haired boy started to run over. Just as he was leaving it suddenly started to rain, he was covered in the rain almost instantly, his body started to get thinner, his arms got so thin that they broke off from his body and turned into giant matchsticks, his fingers and legs did the same. His torso turned into a giant box of gum, his head turned into football. They all rolled down the slight slope on the street. Carl luckily hadn’t had the door or window open so he wasn’t hit with any rain. He looked back and saw that the window near Rupert was still open, he mangaged to close it but before he did, a small amount trickled down and touched his leg. His leg started to grow awkwardly into an orange hard material, his leg started to turn into bricks. His leg turned into bricks and flowed with them until it touched his neck, “Tell people I was pretty cool,” he said before the bricks turned into a sculpture of himself lying on the floor.<br />
<br />
It was about an 15 minutes before the rain stopped. They had eaten half a pizza while waiting, luckily none of the now three teen had any sympathy for people they didn’t know, so they were pretty much fine mentally. The rain stopped suddenly, the residue dried up incredibly fast. The other group ran outside of their building and ran over to them. “Are you guys comin’??” Said a girl with ginger hair, she appeared to have taken as the captain of their group, Carl was probably the captain of Jodie’s group even though they hadn’t discussed it.<br />
<br />
They travelled through the street as a pack, all 5 of them, the other group had only 5 people left in it, the ginger one was named Hannah, the other was a blue haired girl with piercings on her nose and lip, her name was Alex, Jodie assumed she was a punk chick. They continued walking and came across another group of 7, they spoke for a few minutes but parted separate ways. They found a stray boy looking clueless on his own, they asked if he wanted to join the party, he did and his name was John. Jodie and John got along quite well and spoke calmly for a while while the rest of them spoke as a unit. When they had approached a supermarket, they all went inside to find something to eat and drink, they all split into groups of two and would meet back at the entrance, Jodie went with John, Hannah went with Jenny, Carl went with Alex. They searched for a while when Alex looked back at Carl and said, “Dude what the hell, really at this situation!?” She looked at his crotch and saw an erection,<br />
“Wait what, why is my, I’m not even turned on, you’re like the opposite of my type,” he tried to push his erection away. The same happened with John, “Wait this doesn’t make sense,”<br />
“What doesn’t??” Said Jodie, she looked and saw the erection,<br />
“I’m gay so this isn’t me doing it,” he said in return,<br />
Then Jodie’s nipples became hard, so hard in fact it showed through her bra and the shirt, the same happened with all the girls. Actually it happened with every single girl and guy on the earth. They had to walk around the next part of town with erect nipples or penises which was one embarrassing and two quite annoying, since they were quite sensitive. The erect ‘devices’ calmed down after an hour, the group were in a gas station at that point.<br />
<br />
They had managed to find quite a large amount of water, general drinks, food, and a car. Luckily for them, Alex knew how to drive. They were driving around and grabbed a map while they were at it. They had planned to go to a hotel since none of them wanted to let everyone into their homes, they started to plan who would go where, then remember that there was no one left earth who run it. Also everything is free.<br />
<br />
They arrived at the hotel and saw another group there. They spoke and said that they were going to spend the night there. Most of them stayed by themselves in their own room, but Jodie and John decided to stay together because they didn’t feel comfortable alone. They had no sexual or romantic attraction to each other best they did like each other as friends.</p>
