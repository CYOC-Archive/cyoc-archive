<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The Landlord has since forced Ben off the house for obvious reasons but that didn&#39;t deter Ben. Being as intimidating as he was he was able to get a new contract signed with a company that gave Ben an estate that he had full control over. Transformation.net truly transformed his life. His family none the wiser, out of a shitty job, and best off living the high life he always dreamt but never thought possible. Of course being the 27-foot giant he was there were troubles with fitting in but most of the world allowed him peace in his own home probably because of how big he was. A name on a plaque in Hollywood for his role as the &quot;green giant&quot; and other roles as giants scored him large amounts of dough that went into his body maintenance and lavish lifestyle. With all this success you would think he would have scores of fans wanting to date or elope with him. It never seemed to materialize well both because no one can really date such a larger-than-life man, but also, he has been more reclused keeping to his filthy pleasures fiddling his next scheme with Transformation.net. Its been nearly 3 months since his last escapade and he&#39;s been itching for more. He was able to get away with the soft lie that he has incredible growth spurts all his life despite some people vaguely remembering a Ben that was 6&#39;2&quot; and 190 lbs. His success (and intimidation) probably went hand and hand in silencing potential conflicting information that he rather not have his adoring fans realize. <br />
The 27-foot behemoth lumbered his way into his gated sanctuary. An imposing 50-foot door was built with his specification in mind. Pushing the massive door would be an undertaking of many people but for the 5 ton man-machine it was doable. At least now his house is big enough curious eyes would have a hard time even to enter his place without him being there to help them around. Everything about this house was supersized to his body and his suggestion. he had a golden Suana that was lined in gold and mirrors. with a nice chandelier on the top barely illuminating the 80-foot hallowed halls. Of course, the largest part of his house was actually the Living room at a staggering 100ft stunning everyone when camera crews were allowed to enter his estate. Despite not being able to see the ceiling Ben loved seeing very clearly the small lights on the ceiling barely breaking the dark band around the top of his living room. Climbing up to his Giant 60 foot Coach he had fashioned for this very occasion his legs barely able to touch the edge of the seat was a sort of new high he had while he waited to outgrow its own day. he had moved his cart containing his computer closer to him so he can begin his next growth spurt. Logging into Transformation.net he clicked the familiar options of Muscle and Height and began to feel the warm tingling growth return to his body. Still clothed in this turn, he wanted to enjoy slowly growing into his new estate. The loose Shirt and Shorts he wore began to fill as he began to loosen the rope that once fastened his pants on him. In about 5 minutes the rope was pulled off because he now properly fit into his pants.  hoping off the coach he made his way into the Suana to relax. There he waited for a bit as he continued to flex in his clothes, which now clung very tight on him. With one huge lunge, he burst out of his clothes. Feeling a nice and relax he decided that he should take a nice muscle relaxation in the jacuzzi. He closed his eyes as the mellow warm waters carried him away. CREAK, Ben still asleep his body began to move on its own accord. the area warming around him greatly. He began to rapidly expand. His Giant Ass was the last thing pushing him out of his Jacuzzi once he finally outgrew it. The Lapping water across the Suana began to steam as the room began to warm with the expanding body. causing his body to expand faster. <br />
SMASH, Ben woke up an hour and a half later to the feeling of tightness. Realizing in a Sudden Panic tried to move his bulbous body in the now darkened room of the Suana. Trying to process where everything was. As the world came into focus. he saw the Chandelier right in front of him crushed against his Giant pecs. as they continued to expand. He tried to move but everything felt so tight. he could feel the Plaster from the ceiling snowing on him as he continued to struggle to see where the exit was. He couldn&#39;t feel his Arms moving as they struggled un-wedge themselves against the wall they have been pinned to. He continued to struggle as the plaster continued to get chipped away. craning his neck down he could see endless rows of muscle in the remaining bits of mirror that was not consumed by his muscles. He continued to struggle as room continued to close around him. &quot; P U N Y R O O M, M E B I G, M E C R U S H&quot; he moaned overwhelmed again by his intoxicated growth. Soon the mirror he saw moments earlier were crushed under the weight of his Quads as they stretched for a good portion of the room. He continued to struggle as his muscle and height continued to fill the Suana room soon the Suana room ceiling collapsed giving him the headway he needed to squeeze through the 90-foot arch that separated the sauna from the main living room.  Finally, with a little bit of headroom, he began to make his way to the computer.  Despite it only being 200 foot away from him it suddenly became a struggle to get there. As his body slowly unraveled from being trapped in the Suana room. He exploded in Size. His body stretching in all directions as each step became a flex. Unable to stop it. He can feel the ceiling suddenly scrapping up on his traps again after just three steps. Immobilized again he bent down a bit to give himself more leeway as he continued his agonizing slow approach to the computer. AGAIN his traps began to scrap the ceiling. Struggling to bend further down he further slowed down. The computer now only 100ft away from him but obscured by his bulbous pecs which began to get squeezed upwards due to his gargantuan biceps which he saw from his periphery vision. Reduced to crawling he felt his pecs smothered the coach where they rest. the Giant couch began to become a hindrance as his Pecs dug itself into it. Trying to push the computer to the wall to see it, the ceiling began to scrap alongside his giant traps. Finally able to push the button he was able to stop his height growth. in time for the couch to give out from under his giant pecs. which caused him to suddenly no longer dig himself into the ceiling for a bit. trying to reposition himself he was able to click the muscle growth off. as his traps slowly scrapped the ceiling again. Resting in his awkward position he tried to recollect his will. <br />
Finally together again Ben surveyed the wrecked Suana which dug into his Lats. He shuffled himself so he left the devasted Suana to one side of the room. He placed the computer stand gently on one of the ridges of his canyon abs. Carefully leaning against a solid wall finally was able to settle inside his living room. Trying to move his arms around was a challenge as his pecs proved a strange obstacle to surpass. As if coming out a nap, Ben instinctually did a nice morning stretch only to realize the mistake he made. His body heaved in all directions again. Pushing his traps up into the ceiling again. the house around his groaned in response. The pressure all around his body was still intense. as if the residual growth in it was still not complete, which he knew was probably the case still. He tried to moving his arms slowly as to not suddenly do his decagonal flex. Seeing the flab of muscle that formed around his shoulders he did a flex anyway. Causing his body to shake again. Ben fell over as the weight of his pecs swelled. in an awkward sitting position, he kept accidentally flexing in odd unnatural angles. Causing him to swell more and more. Breathing in and out he continued to struggle as his muscle expansion caused great amounts of sharp pains as they expand and consume the other furnishing around his living room. His neck muscle bulged forward pushing forward his head. He gasping began to grow uneven as he watched as his neck muscle fused with a second set pec forming from the ridge of the blimp pecs in front of him. His traps also pushed his back head leaving him in an awkward position where he can now not move his head. After seemingly the growth ended he tried to sit up again only for his traps to push him down again. Grumbling rocked his body as the hunger surge came over him again. His hand shoved itself into the refrigerator and the pantry clearing out everything in it. His body lurching forward as it began to search for more food. shoving food into his mouth Ben struggled against his own body to satisfy its own needs. His giant arms then punched through the glass wall and began to consume the backyard orchard. Eventually, his hunger while not gone was sedated such that he was able to regain control of his arms. His body heaved forward more as expanding to fit the food he shoved into himself. The living room once the largest thing in the house has become a cell to the largest thing to grace Giant-land, Ben. <br />
Despite his traps eating the ceiling, Ben was able to have some mobility crab-walking to the wrecked glass wall while one hand was fishing his ab canyons for the puny computer stand. the glass wall was dusted by the touch of Bens muscles, so he surprisingly didn&#39;t get any cuts or scratches. Freeing himself from his own home he stood up for the first time in 3 hours, against the sunset skies.  looking down at his estate. His body twitched again as the new space caused his body to tense up and expand again. A giant groan was released from Ben. as he shot upwards. The rush of air around him was exhilarating. Causing his muscle to expand another great leap until finally, the air around him returned to normal. Feeling himself before crouching down to his estate. To pick up his clothes that he himself placed on the top of the estate nice and folded. no one noticed these set of cloth he had asked the big and tall to make which he finished all but a week prior. <br />
Ben calculated how he was gonna fit in these clothes well enough to look decent for clothes that better fit him. Unable to find think of one he decided to try regardless. Oh, how he overestimated his ability to guess his new size. his Underwear snapped before ever reaching his private regions. He tried the pants only to have it nearly give out containing his private region. He felt the pants dig into his members like very tight thongs. He continued to moan as he tried to suppress ripping off the pants-thong. Trying to get some extra point he grabbed his shirt and tried pushing it over his pecs and his bicep, the sleeves burst instantly. and his pecs barely were covered under the flimsy shirt. he sighed. This will have to do. he moved to his secret stash in the neighboring forest. revealing another large pair of clothes that the employee prepared by wrapping the pants-thong around a cloth layer which finally concealed his giant members. Eventually, he placed a tarp with a hole cut for his neck and wore it like a prize. He looked like a hobo being reduced to a giant tarp dress but he didn&#39;t mind tomorrow was a new day and he was gonna cease it. Reading the final results after placing the computer stand on his chest it reads:<br />
Ben--- Final Results----<br />
220 feet<br />
3580 tons</p>
