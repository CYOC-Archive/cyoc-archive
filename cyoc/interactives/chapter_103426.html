<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Making up his mind on what he was going to do, Dave started writing.<br />
&#39;While I am in this office, no one will bother me until I am ready to see them. This means they will ignore any and all noises or actions that I might do unless I invite them in. If they needed to talk to me for any reason, they will instead drop a slip of paper through a mail slot that will appear on my door now. Also, there are no security cameras or audio devices in this room aside from those that I bring in myself. Finally, there are opaque curtains over the windows facing the rest of the building.&#39;<br />
As soon as he finished writing, the changes were made. Curtains swished from nowhere to cover the windows, the small security camera in the corner of the room disappeared and a little brass mail slot opened up on his door. Deciding to have some fun as his cock was still throbbing at him, with his new cunt getting increasingly wet, Dave started to stand up. Before he did though, he thought of something else to write.<br />
&#39;No matter where I am or what I&#39;m doing, I can wear any sort of clothing I want. This includes being naked. Any changes that I make to myself or others(this includes direct and indirect changes) by using the pen will be accepted as normal unless I state otherwise.&#39;<br />
Now satisfied, Dave stood up from his desk, before quickly stripping out of his clothes. Looking himself over, he tried to decide what to change next about him. Shrugging, he just laid back on the office floor, before starting to pleasure himself. One hand was gently pumping his cock, while the other was fondling his balls and playing with his new, sopping twat.<br />
The combined feelings proved to be too much and he soon exploded, cum arching into the air and splattering over his chest while his pussy spasmed and squirted some liquid onto the floor below him.<br />
<br />
Sighing in contentment, Dave levered himself back upright. Looking down at his crotch, he realized his still hadn&#39;t seen what he truly looked like. To remedy that, he quickly wrote on the paper.<br />
&#39;There is a large, full-body mirror on the wall in the corner of this room.&#39;<br />
As the mirror appeared, he sauntered over, before turning and bending over, his ass in the air and facing the mirror. Looking over his shoulder, he grinned at what he saw, his cock springing back to attention as he saw his, tight slit of pink flesh sitting just behind where his Ping-Pong-ball size balls hung, the soft mounds and folds incredibly enticing. That gave him an idea...<br />
<br />
Getting up and moving over to his desk, he once again picked up the pen. Quickly, he jotted down his next change.<br />
&#39;The following changes will take 10 seconds each to complete, and they proceed in the order they are written. The skin on my chest area will become very feminine, with no chest hair to speak of. I will grow a set of perfectly formed and very bouncy C cup breasts, each with an apropriatly sized feminine nipple and areola. Each of my balls will grow to the size of a large grapefruit, the two of them together producing half-a-cup of semen. My cock will grow to be 3 feet long, but only half-again as thick as it is currently. Next, my all of my sexual organs(including breasts and nipples) will become twice as sensitive as they are normally, though I will last just as long as I normally do before having an orgasm. I can have as many orgasms in a row as I want, and my cock and nipples will never go soft and my cunt will stay moist until I decide I&#39;m done pleasuring myself. Finally, my cock is also completely prehensile.&#39;<br />
<br />
As he set down the pen, Dave could feel his chest start tingling. As he watched, his sparse chest hair shrivled and vanished back into his now much lighter and softer skin. As he watched, small, soft mounds of flesh bloomed from his chest, as his nipples and areola grew in proportion to them. Within a few seconds, they stopped growing at a respectable size, the unfamiliar weight making him shudder slightly. Reaching up, he lightly cupped them, moaning at the new sensations. Before he had any chance to play with his tits, he felt a churning in his balls. Looking down past his tits, he saw them start to inflate, getting bigger and heavier till they were tugging quite pleasurably on the skin of his crotch as they laid on the front of his legs. By now, Dave was about ready to blow his load simply from watching and feeling the changes happen. Then his cock twitched, before starting to pour more and more length out from his groin, but only getting a little thicker. As soon as the length topped out at two feet, Dave felt a tingling through his whole body, before he nearly doubled over, gasping in pleasure as the slightest breeze caressed his stiff cock, the movements of his body making his tits bounce and sway, the soft leather of his chair stimulating his cunt. For the next ten seconds, he just felt a tingle pass through him, before it centered around his dick once more at the end of those ten seconds. As he watched, he could suddenly feel some new, tiny muscles appear, as well as his cock go slightly soft without loosing any length. Concentrating, he managed to make it twitch a few times, getting more and more movement out of his dick before at the end of the time, he could tie it into a knot or wrap it around himself like a belt. Grinning as the energy of the pen finally left him for now, he pondered what he should do next.</p>
