<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Shortly after his first female orgasm, Sean fell asleep on Christina&#39;s bed. <br />
<br />
He awoke in the morning, somewhat disoriented. The strange weight on his chest (Christina&#39;s breasts), the strangely long hair, the void between his legs... they took him momentarily by surprise until he remembered. &quot;Oh, yes, I&#39;m in Christina&#39;s body.&quot; <br />
<br />
He looked at the clock. It said 8:00. Now... when was Christina&#39;s algebra test? He rummaged through her papers and found her schedule. Her algebra class met at 9:00. That gave Sean an hour to get ready. He quickly took a shower, running his hands all over Christina&#39;s sexy wet body. He could feel a growing horniness that was only exacerbated as he rubbed between his legs and massaged his breasts... but, no, he didn&#39;t have time for that this morning!<br />
<br />
Then, after drying his hair, he had to decide what to wear, still with a great sense of arousal. That led him to choose the most sexually appealing items he could find: a black lacy thong to cover his lower regions, a garter belt and thigh-high stockings, and a very short black miniskirt. Now, what to wear on his upper half, he wondered? He looked at the bras and decided he could probably go without... as he didn&#39;t want to try to figure out how to put one on. Instead, he simply grabbed a tight-fitting low-cut shirt, exposing quite a bit of cleavage. <br />
<br />
He looked at himself in the mirror and thought, &quot;Wow, she&#39;s hot,&quot; and it took a moment for him to remember that he was the &quot;she&quot; in the mirror. There was something not quite right though: she wasn&#39;t wearing makeup. Sean looked at Christina&#39;s makeup but realized that he didn&#39;t have time to experiment this morning. And in fact, he needed to hurry to get to the test on time.<br />
<br />
So, he ran out of the room, wearing simple flats on his feet, and made it to the classroom with a few minutes to spare. He sat up front (as most of the rear seats had been taken already), not sure where Christina would normally sit. The teacher-- a reasonably attractive man Sean supposed... if he were into men, that is-- soon passed out the tests. Sean looked at the test and couldn&#39;t believe how easy it was. It was just algebra after all. Algebra. A class that people take in high school. Heck, Sean had taken *Calculus* in high school, so the thought of algebra being a college class seemed laughable to him.<br />
<br />
And because the problems were so easy, it was hard to concentrate on them, especially when he had other things distracting him. He was still feeling quite horny... maybe he should have masturbated in the shower after all? And the constant weight of the breasts on his chest made it hard to forget that he was a woman now, and that just made him even hornier. It was one thing to be a woman in the privacy of his own room (or Christina&#39;s room), but to be a woman out in public? That was crazy. <br />
<br />
Still, he tried not to get too distracted. He took his time working each problem. making sure not to make any careless mistakes. He wanted Christina to get her money&#39;s worth, as it were. So he checked his arithmetic and double-checked it. He worked problems two or three different ways, just to make sure he got the same answer each time. And so he wasn&#39;t paying attention to the way he was sitting, with his legs spread wide open, or to the way one of his hands would occasionally slide to a breast to fondle it distractedly. He was focused on the test, not paying attention to what his body was doing. <br />
<br />
And then before he knew it, time was up. He looked up and realized he was the last person in the class. Everyone else had turned their tests in already.<br />
<br />
Sean ran up to turn in his test, satisfied that he had done well. As he gave the test to the teacher and turned to leave, the teacher said, &quot;Christina, can I talk to you for a moment?&quot;<br />
<br />
Sean paused and then turned around, wondering what this was about. As Sean came closer to the teacher&#39;s desk, the teacher said, &quot;Look, I know you&#39;ve been having a rough time in this class, but your behavior today isn&#39;t going to help.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Behavior? What do you mean?&quot; Sean asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know. Flashing your panties at me or groping your chest until your hard nipples poke through your shirt. I mean, yes, I appreciate that. But even the sight of your black lacy thong panties isn&#39;t going to improve your grade you know!&quot;<br />
<br />
Sean immediately blushed with embarrassment. Sean had unintentionally given the teacher a heck of a show. Still, Sean rejoined with, &quot;But I know I did well on the test this time. Go ahead and check it if you like!&quot;<br />
<br />
The teacher gave Sean an &quot;I doubt you even got one problem right&quot; look, making Sean wonder just how badly Christina was doing in this class. Still, he pulled out a red pen and started grading Christina&#39;s test. And Sean saw a strange look of surprise in the teacher&#39;s eyes. &quot;I can&#39;t believe it,&quot; he told her. &quot;You got them all right!&quot; He then paused and thought, &quot;So, who were you cheating off of?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nobody,&quot; Sean said in exasperation. &quot;I just, you know, studied for the first time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Really?&quot; he asked. &quot;So tell me, what&#39;s the quadratic formula?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Negative b plus or minus the square root of b squared minus four ac all over 2a,&quot; Sean replied automatically.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, maybe you are improving,&quot; the teacher told her. &quot;Good for you.&quot;</p>
