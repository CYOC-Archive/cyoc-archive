<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff went into the kitchen and looked around. There ought to be something in here that could be transformed into a gorgeous woman. The cantaloupe and the milk jugs were a little too obvious for the breast factor. A peach would have been equally obvious for the ass factor. There were so many different types of food, it was hard for Jeff to pick just one.<br />
<br />
Then he noticed something on the counter. It was a box from the local bakery. Opening it, he saw there were plenty of cookies left inside it. Among them was a gingerbread man. Well, gingerbread girl. The bakery wasn&#39;t just one of those typical mass-producing sweets stores. The owners put actual effort and art into their confections like their ancestors did after they immigrated from Germany.<br />
<br />
The icing that had been put on the gingerbread girl made the difference in showing it was meant to be a girl. It was mostly covered in a dress made of light green icing. The bottom part of it was shaped right to show it was wearing an actual dress. There were also a pair of little red shoes and white gloves. The dress was decorated with a few yellow stripes and two purple gumdrop buttons. The face was simple, but the red icing for the lips and the tiny eyelashes around the green eyes showed it was female. The red hair that surrounded her head also aided in its feminine appearance. The cookie was surprisingly intact. Most cookies would have crumbled to bits on the way back home.<br />
<br />
Jeff looked at the gingerbread girl. Too easy? Perhaps, but it seemed like the best choice. Picking up the cookie, he headed back to his room. He held it up to the computer&#39;s camera and let it take a picture of it. He then placed it on the floor where it will have plenty of room to grow. Once that was done, he started working on the profile the gingerbread woman will have when it becomes a real girl.<br />
<br />
Scrolling down, he spotted all the information of the type of human a user would turn an inanimate object into. Everything from gender, age, race, IQ, occupation, status, sexuality, even a clothing option that the inanimate object turned human would have clothing that matches what the newly created human use to be. There were other options too on the choices you make, like if the human is female, there will be breast size, or male for muscle definition. And at the bottom of the options is the duration of the change, and returning the human to its original state, with the option next to it and says, ‘Permanent’ or ‘I’ll change it for later’. Eventually, he selected these options for the gingerbread girl.<br />
<br />
Gender: Female<br />
Age: 25<br />
Race: German-Irish<br />
Body Type: Voluptuous<br />
Breast Size: CC<br />
IQ: 150<br />
Occupation: None<br />
Status: Single<br />
Sexuality: 50%<br />
Clothing to Fit the Change: Yes<br />
Mental Changes: Yes<br />
Awareness: Yes<br />
Duration of Change: 1 Minute<br />
Time to Change Back: I’ll change it for later<br />
<br />
Jeff double-checked his work to make sure that&#39;s what he wanted. He wasn&#39;t sure if he&#39;d want to keep the gingerbread girl after he was finished so he didn&#39;t make the change permanent. He might be able to alter reality so that the girl would have an actual past, but he&#39;ll work on that if he felt like keeping her. He executed the program before turning around to watch the results.<br />
<br />
The results were immediate. The gingerbread girl twitched before it sat up, its body remaining uncracked even as it bent. As it got to its feet, it became clear that the cookie was growing larger. The back of the cookie was completely blank and unadorned. But now the icing was spreading across the back of it. The dress, gloves, and shoes were soon as obvious on the back as they were on the front. The red icing that made up the hair covered the back of the head before trailing further down the back.<br />
<br />
It was at that point where the details actually started coming in. The gingerbread girl&#39;s generic cookie shape started taking on a more specific form. The waist sank in as the hips became more defined. Elbows and knees were easier to distinguish as the arms and legs became slimmer. The gloves appeared to be cracking until five fingers formed on each hand. The icing on the face became a lot more detailed, adding a nose, eyebrows, actual shapes to her eyes and mouth. As it approached Jeff&#39;s height, it looked less like a cookie and more a 2D depiction of a pretty woman that was somehow able to balance on its flat feet.<br />
<br />
The flatness was not going to remain long. With a crunch/popping sound, the feet started taking more definitive shape. As the feet formed toes, ankles, and heels, the shoes morphed into the right shape to hold them, red heels extending from the back of them as they became high-heeled shoes. The changes extended further up the legs, making them rounder, curvier. As the shoes&#39; icing became plastic, so did her legs transition from gingerbread to real flesh. As the changes got up to the hips, Jeff could swear he heard two pops as her buttocks began to form and swell. Her hips were becoming rounder as they formed into something real under the dress, which was now made less of icing and more of cotton.<br />
<br />
The gingerbread girl looked strange with the upper half of a flat cookie and the lower body of a real woman, but the changes were not finished. The dress completed its transition from green icing to green cotton, the purple gumdrop buttons shrinking down and becoming normal buttons. The torso became less flat as the gingerbread became flesh as functioning organs formed. It became less flat as with two distinct pops, one breast started forming followed by the other. The arms also became real flesh as bones formed and gave them more structure. The white icing of the gloves shaped around real fingers underneath them before they became real cotton.<br />
<br />
Finally, the head was making the final transition. The face began pushing out as icing details grew more depth. The red icing mouth gained actual lips before teeth, gums, a tongue, a uvula, and tonsils formed behind them. The back of the mouth opened and connected to the throat before they became real flesh and bone. Her nose extended out from her face as the nostrils opened and took in air. The green dots that were her eyes gained black dots for pupils as whites formed around them. New eyelids covered them briefly before opening to reveal functioning eyes. The red icing that formed her hair puffed out as it became true hair that framed a face that was awake and aware.<br />
<br />
As the minute ended, the gingerbread girl had become a real woman. Her clothes were no longer made of icing, but real material. Her skin was a much lighter shade of brown, though perhaps a little tanner than what her new ethnicity usually was. Her hair extended to the small of her back and was a ginger red color. Her face was gorgeous, with green eyes and red lips. And there was no overlooking how sexy and curved her body was as her dress was rather skintight. The woman looked at herself with amazement before saying, &quot;I&#39;m alive.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes you are,&quot; said Jeff, &quot;What do you know?&quot;<br />
<br />
The woman closed her eyes for a moment and said, &quot;I seem to know what every woman my age should know. I know how to eat, how to sleep. I can cook, drive, and have sex. I even have a college education.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So I guess you&#39;d be one smart cookie,&quot; said Jeff.<br />
<br />
The woman gave him an amused look and said, &quot;Cute, but I think I&#39;d rather have an actual name.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Would you be okay with &#39;Ginger&#39;?&quot; asked Jeff.<br />
<br />
&quot;A bit obvious, but I like it,&quot; said &#39;Ginger&#39;, &quot;Now what about a last name?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I guess we can&#39;t let it be just &#39;Bread&#39;. Maybe a foreign word for bread. Or maybe we could name you after the bakery store,&quot; said Jeff.<br />
<br />
&quot;The bakers, wouldn&#39;t they be my parents?&quot; asked Ginger.<br />
<br />
&quot;I suppose they would technically be, but I&#39;m not sure if they would see it that way,&quot; said Jeff, &quot;I suppose we could alter reality to make you their daughter if we want. The possibilities are just about limitless. What do you want to do?&quot;</p>
