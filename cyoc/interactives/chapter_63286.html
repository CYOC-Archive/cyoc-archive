<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">There was a silence for some time before either spoke up.  Dan cleared his throat.  &quot;So... you're into this too, huh?&quot;  He gave his belly the lightest push, letting it sway just slightly.  Sean laughed awkwardly.  &quot;Yeah.  I mean.  I didn't really think I was.  Till I saw your gut sticking out over your boxers.  I couldn't stop thinking about it.  I was hoping I'd get another peek... didn't really expect to see absolutely everything though.  Sorry, I know you're not gay.  I hope you're not too mad about that.&quot;  Sean said scratching the back of his neck, averting his eyes.  Dan shook his head &quot;I'm not.  haha...  well.  I'm a little embarrassed... but for some reason I kind of like that you saw me.&quot;<br />
<br />
  Sean smirked.  &quot;Kind of liked it the same way you kind of like being fat, you mean?&quot;  Dan got a bit flush and laughed, but nodded.  Maybe this newfound fatboy was a bit bi-curious, Sean thought.  Time to test the theory.  &quot;Hey Dan.  I know it's weird for me to ask... but can you drop the towel?  I want to see what's going on with you.&quot;  He said, as seriously as he could manage.  Dan thought for a moment.  This would help him test his own theory.  He was a little soft now.  He dropped the towel, exposing every inch of his newly fattened form to Sean.  Sean took it all in.  Every pound that had found it's way onto the once skinny Dan.  He watched as his flabby roommate started to get hard again.  &quot;You do like it.&quot;  Sean said with a grin &quot;I mean, you like showing me this.  It doesn't bother you at all?&quot;.  Dan shook his head.  &quot;Not really.  Especially now that I know you appreciate it.&quot;<br />
<br />
  &quot;Oh I definitely appreciate it.&quot;  He said, stepping closer.  &quot;Can... can I feel it?  I want to see how it feels.  If it's really fat.&quot;  Dan went flush again, but eventually nodded.  Sean got in close, his hands grasping Dan's stomach, feeling the fat depress under his fingertips, belly conforming and shaping to gravity as he played with it.  It was real, that was certain.  He kept exploring. Fingers riding over the rolls and creases Dan had gained.  Dan was feeling his own sensations in all this.  Having his flab caressed and held by Sean was keeping him hard as a rock.  He was drifting off a bit into his imagination when suddenly he was jarred back by the grip of Sean's meaty hands grabbing his enlarged ass.<br />
<br />
  &quot;Dan... I've gotta tell you right now... you being like this has got me going.  Shit... I can't even tell you how badly I wanna do you right now.&quot;  And with that, Sean locked lips with Dan, half expecting resistance.  He got none, however.  Dan seemed to melt into him.  When he let go, Dan half-grinned.  &quot;I gotta admit... I kind of want to, too... but I don't think I can go from thin to fat and straight to gay in one night.  Gotta keep my options open though, I guess.  Steph's totally going to dump me when she sees how fat I am.&quot;<br />
<br />
  Sean shrugged a bit.  He understood.  &quot;Well, what if it's not permanent.  Maybe you'll change back soon.  I mean, the weight came out of nowhere, maybe it'll go away just the same?&quot;  Dan tilted his head &quot;Yeah, I guess that'd be fine.&quot;<br />
<br />
 &quot;You guess it'd be fine?  You mean you don't mind if it doesn't leave?&quot; Sean asked, slightly surprised.  He thought maybe Dan was just caught up in some side effect from the chronivac that had him turned on by all this.  Dan nodded. &quot;I... I don't really want it to leave.  I've been a thin guy my whole life.  Tried hard to put weight on, but no luck.  Now, out of nowhere, I'm bigger.  On top of that, it's bigger in a way I've always fantasized about!&quot;<br />
<br />
  Sean blinked in amazement. &quot;Wait, you've always fantasized about being fat?&quot; a wry smile crept across his face. &quot;Wanna tell me about those fantasies, fatboy?&quot;  he said groping Dan's ample ass.  Dan laughed.  He enjoyed that...  &quot;Well. I dunno.  Remember how when we were kids, every cartoon seemed to have at least one episode where someone got fat?  When I was a teenager, I'd think of those cartoons, and it just did it for me.  As I got a little older, I'd just lay on my bed, imagining what it'd be like to get really fat.&quot;  He covered his face with his hand for a second.  &quot;I even used to stuff pillows under my shirt to pretend.&quot;  Sean gave Dan's stomach a pat &quot;And, how fat would you say you got in these fantasies?  As big as you are now?&quot;<br />
<br />
  Dan laughed nervously &quot;Uhh... no... bigger. I would daydream about being one of those guys who's gut always just makes it's way out of a massive shirt, gets winded walking 10 feet...  If I had to put a number on it... at least 500.&quot;  <br />
<br />
  Sean's mouth gaped.  He imagined it.  Dan, covered in thick layers of flab, rolls bunching, belly heaving out.  Growing all over.  Turning into one of the huge men he'd described.  &quot;Shit... that's hot.&quot;  He sputtered out.  &quot;You think so?&quot;  Dan said, pleasant surprise coloring his words.  Sean nodded &quot;Hell yes.  I wouldn't be able to keep my hands off you at that size.  And you said &quot;at least&quot;... that means you've imagined more.  That just makes this even better!&quot;  He said shaking Dan's gut.<br />
<br />
  He stopped for a moment &quot;Hey Dan... you think... maybe what's happening...  maybe your fantasies are coming true?  Maybe you're turning into that kind of guy?&quot;<br />
<br />
  Dan was quiet... what if he was right?  &quot;I didn't even think of that... shit, that's a lot of weight.  I mean, fantasy is one thing, but to be a big porker like that?&quot;  He said, slight concern in his tone, but something else was there too.  Sean spoke up &quot;even if it's real, you think it's hot, don't you?&quot;  He pressed himself up against Dan, letting their stomachs touch. &quot;Think about getting up every morning, heaving that huge body out of bed.  Feeling every inch of your quake when you take a few steps.&quot;  He said with a sly tone, watching Dan's reaction. &quot;Think about trying to awkwardly get into those tent-like clothes, or showering, exploring every inch of your massive frame.  How you'd bounce like a jello mold when you walk down the street, and people talk about how gigantic you've become.  Think about the effort involved in just moving around every day.&quot;<br />
<br />
  &quot;F...fuck.&quot;  Was all Dan stammered out.  Sean got his answer when Dan's hard member pressed up against his bulge.  &quot;Well?&quot;  Sean asked, giving Dan's belly a playful squeeze.  &quot;Y..yeah, it's hot.  Fuck, it's hot.  You're good at this...  I guess, if that's what's happening to me, I can get used to it.  Who am I kidding?  I'd fucking love it!&quot;<br />
<br />
  Sean laughed &quot;Thought as much... maybe we'll see you like that soon enough.&quot;  He looked at his watch.  Jay, the other room mate would be home soon.  Might be awkward to be seen standing around with their now fat, naked friend Dan.  &quot;You try and cover up.  Jay's going to freak out enough about your weight.  He doesn't need to see your dick, too.  I gotta go check on something.&quot;  He said just before planting another kiss on Dan's lips and leaving the room.  He made a bee-line for the chronivac... what was he going to do?</p>
