<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">If Juliet Renard-Argenté had a flaw she was willing to admit to herself, it was that she had a need to be in control of her situation. Miss Juliet would argue that she had been fighting to maintain control for most of her life. After what had happened to her poor brother, Juliet had to work hard to maintain ownership of her estate as a spinster. Then she had to struggle to keep the school she started for children with mental impediments open. Converting into Animalians didn’t make it as much easier. While it improved everyone’s health and got Juliet an extension of life, they all now had to deal with their increased libido. At least the French government was more willing to help out, though they also wanted to cash in Animalia’s reputation. Miss Juliet wasn’t fond of having Belle&#39;s Bêtes on her land, but at least no students were working their unwillingly. There were a few too many working there willingly for her tastes.<br />
<br />
So Miss Juliet would say a lot of her controlling nature was justified. It was only towards matters that were unrelated to school that she might say that she was a bit of a control freak. One such thing was trying to plan her wedding to Raoul Renee. She had intended for it to be in autumn while allowing her students to attend. However, managing the autumn schedule was more time-consuming than she had anticipated. She didn’t want to admit it, but she was over her head when it came to wedding planning.<br />
<br />
Then the French government gave her what most people would see as a godsend, perhaps more literally than usual. Out of recognition of both Juliet and Raoul’s humanitarian efforts towards the improvement of education, particularly those with learning disabilities, the government was not only going to foot the bill for covering the wedding and reception, but the wedding itself would be held in Notre Dame de Paris as soon as it was open to the public.<br />
<br />
While most women would be over the moon about this opportunity, the cynical side of Juliet saw that the government was using this as a PR stunt. Admittedly, it benefited all parties in spades. Though Juliet’s pride stung a little about her wedding being turned into a circus. Then again, there was also her inner child who had always dreamed of a fairy tale wedding. And to have it at Notre Dame, it was hard to get an honor higher than that unless the pope himself oversaw the ceremony. Though more realistically, it would be a normal priest performing.<br />
<br />
Miss Juliet nearly balked at the whole thing when she saw her wedding dress, which consisted almost more lace than solid fabric. Admittedly, it was not nearly as sheer as it could be, but she was getting married in the most sacred cathedral in France. She couldn’t walk up the alley looking like a giant doily. It took quite a bit of assurance from her bridesmaids not to call off the whole wedding. Fortunately, they were able to soothe Juliet’s anxieties and get her to go though with it. Though the bride did demand another layer of fabric be added so she would look more presentable in a church.<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
Juliet would have to admit that she couldn&#39;t find a more spacious place to have room for all her wedding guests. And the inside of Notre Dame was magnificent, much brighter than expected after centuries of soot have been cleaned off the walls and ceiling. Perhaps the cathedral was ostentatious, but Juliet just decided to go with it. Besides, it&#39;s not the wedding itself that matters, it&#39;s her marriage at the end of it. It might seem a little odd for a human groom to have a vixen bride, but France is nothing but open-minded towards <i>lamour</i>. The priest never made any fuss about the odd pair, particularly as they won&#39;t be different species for long. Rather, he spoke of how much work they&#39;ve done for the betterment of others, even after all they&#39;ve had to personally sacrifice.<br />
<br />
Juliet had her own vows to make. &quot;For most of my life, I&#39;ve had to rely on myself. What happened to my brother has always haunted me, and I suspect it always will. But I think my brother would be happy to have me finally find someone to share my burden with. Someone who knows about putting others before himself. And I know I cannot replace your first wife, but I hope the life we build together will be able to honor her memory. I love you, Raoul.&quot;<br />
<br />
Soon after that, they were pronounced Mr. and Mrs. Renee-Argenté (the couple decided that since their family names were so similar, they should combine them.) The bells of Notre Dame rang out to announce their marriage. Fortunately, the bell tower was high enough for the knells to not cause pain for the more sensitive-eared Animalians. Once on the steps, Juliet tossed her bouquet, which caused quite a bit of a scuffle for it. But the bouquet ultimately ended up in Desiree&#39;s hands who flashed a wide grin towards Juan. Juliet didn&#39;t mind so much. She knew Juan to be an upstanding gentleman who would make a good husband. And it would finally put those rumors between them to rest if he became her stepson-in-law.<br />
<br />
Fortunately, the reception was in a warm, insulated place to keep out the December chill. Some may wonder if it was a good idea to be married on Friday the 13th, but Juliet and Raoul couldn&#39;t care in the slightest. If anything, it proved that day wasn&#39;t as unlucky as everyone feared. And after the party was over, they&#39;ll be off on their honeymoon. First a brief stop at Costa de Cabra, then they were flying to Ao Guang.</p>
