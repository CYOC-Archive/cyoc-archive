Across town…<br />
<br />
While Eric would have liked to have some more alone time with Cassie, he was glad to have the additional help with his homework. And it would appear that Nate needed all the help he could get.<br />
<br />
“Ugh, I’m such a block head!” Nate threw himself back against the thankfully carpeted floor of the Anderson’s living room. <br />
<br />
“No, you’re just overthinking things.” Alex pulled Nate upright, and again tried to show him where his mistakes lied. But to Nate, looking at graphs was like looking at Chinese. <br />
<br />
“Guess Eric got all the smart genes. Because I’ve got nothing. Just sawdust and brain juice.” Nate woefully quipped. Eric stifled a laugh, and went back to helping Cassie with her math homework. Ben was notably missing from their group. Deciding Nate needed a temporary distraction, Alex asked if anyone knew where he was.<br />
<br />
“I dunno. He said he had somewhere to be this afternoon.” Eric shrugged. <br />
<br />
“Huh, maybe he’s got something to do for his moms.” Cassie said.<br />
<br />
“Or he could be doing about a million other things. Wish I could be doing something else.” Nate grumbled. His self loathing was getting a bit annoying at this point. Eric half-threatened to glue the math textbook to Nate’s head if he kept complaining. <br />
<br />
When the brothers were younger fights like this usually ended in the two wrestling until a parent intervened. Now that they were older, and had fangs and claws at their disposal, things were a LOT more dangerous. And Alex didn’t want to get the Anderson’s carpet dirty with blood. Martha had enough on her plate. <br />
<br />
“Okay, I think you two need a break from each other. Gotta say I enjoy being an only child, don’t you Cassie?” Alex said, stepping in between the increasingly annoyed brothers. <br />
<br />
“At times like this yes.” Cassie said, though deep down she was very amused. And a little turned on. Eric was normally such a perfect gentleman. Seeing him get all riled up was pretty hot. <br />
<br />
Alex packed up their things, and then ushered Nate out the back door. Cassie slid across the carpet, closer to Eric. <br />
<br />
“And here I thought you two were getting along better.” Cassie said. <br />
<br />
“Sometimes. Most of the time really. But we’re brothers. It’s our job to piss off the other one.” Eric huffed, glad Alex had dragged Nate out of the room. He seriously doubted things would have escalated to a fight. Still, better safe than sorry. <br />
<br />
“So, want to keep going? Or do you also need a break?” Cassie asked, hoping for the latter choice, <br />
<br />
“Probably could use a break. Why? What did you have in mind?” Eric was eager to exert some of his excess energy. <br />
<br />
“I know what you’re thinking, but I’ve found that “sex-ercise” isn’t all its cracked up to be. I’ve got a better idea.” Cassie got to her feet and once Eric was on his, lead him out the front door. Eric wasn’t sure where Cassie was leading him. To her house, to an underground missile silo? Either way he was intrigued. Eric barely had time to grab his phone and keys as Cassie snatched her bag from the ground. <br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------- <br />
<br />
“Feeling better?” Alex asked. He’d dragged Nate deep into the woods behind the Anderson’s house. It only took a few seconds for Nate to practically tear his clothing off and wolf-out. He spent the next ten or so minutes digging his claws in a tree, and skinning it. <br />
<br />
“Yes. Sorry, I’ve got my uncle’s temper.” Nate wasn’t sure if his blush could be seen through his fur, but it was there. <br />
<br />
“No problem. Everyone gets frustrated now and then. Probably doesn’t help you that Eric’s such a smarty pants.”<br />
<br />
“A regular Einstein.” Nate rolled his eyes and collapsed to the ground. A cloud of dirt went up around him when he did, making Nate cough and gag. <br />
<br />
“Smooth move Stud. Really smooth.” Alex chuckled overhead. He looked down at his currently transformed boyfriend smiling as Nate continued to wave the dust out of his line of sight. <br />
<br />
“Oh shut up.” Nate coughed. Alex continued to laugh, so Nate kicked his leg out and knocked Alex over. Being smaller, since he wasn’t transformed, Alex landed in a much smaller puff of dirt. Nate growled in annoyance and took a deep breath. <br />
<br />
“I hope things are going better for my mom today.” he said. <br />
<br />
“I’m sure she’s fine. She’s having a baby, not conducting nuclear experiments.” Alex joked. <br />
<br />
“True. But there’s always a chance something could go wrong. And she’s been so, you know, emotional since my dad died.” Nate sighed. <br />
<br />
“You worry too much. Just like with the math, you overthink things. Chances are things are going great, and Wilma’s healthier than ever.” <br />
<br />
“Still don’t like the name much, but thanks.” Nate rolled over, fur coated in dirt, and licked Alex’s face. <br />
<br />
“Ugh, now I get why people don’t like that. Not usually on the receiving end of dog kisses.” Alex wiped the saliva from his brow and cheeks. <br />
<br />
“Hey, wolf. Werewolf, not a dog. Do I look like a Border Collie to you?” <br />
<br />
“A little around the eyes…” Alex got cut off when Nate planted another slobbery lick on his face. This time right over his lips and nose. And that naturally led to the two sharing a real kiss. Which went from wolf on human, to wolf on wolf. And then wolf IN wolf. <br />
<br />
Alex didn’t even care that his clothing was ripped to little bits as he transformed, and Nate’s claws tore even more away. He just wanted to be as close to Nate as physically possible. Nate positioned himself above Alex’s wolf-cock, ready to skewer himself as soon as Alex was. <br />
<br />
“Well what are you waiting for?” Alex growled, about ready to burst. The tip of his red rocket was shaking with excitement. Nate slowly lowered himself onto his boyfriend’s hard cock, until he felt Alex’s knot enter. <br />
<br />
Both howled in pleasure, their bodies locked together as wolfish love making started. <br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------- <br />
<br />
Cassie led Eric from his house, past her own (only so she could drop off her school bag), and to the pack grounds. The thick trees provided a perfectly shaded area for any hikers, or in this case two werewolves. <br />
<br />
“Uh, what are you doing Cassie?” Eric asked when he saw her pulling her shirt over her head.<br />
<br />
“Taking my clothing off, duh.”<br />
<br />
“But won’t we get in trouble? It’s only three in the afternoon.” Eric said, nervously looking around for any normal people. Ever since their run-in with Claire, he’d been extra vigilant. Especially when the two were in public places together. In their fursonas or not. <br />
<br />
“Don’t worry. Hikers don’t come this way since there aren’t any marked trails. And it’s almost December, what normal goes hiking in December?”<br />
<br />
“Claire was.” Eric pointed out. Cassie was down to her underwear now. Eric tried not to stare. Even though she was his girlfriend he felt a little bad for leering. <br />
<br />
“Yes, in the park. This is forest, untouched and unmarked by civilization. Trust me, I run here all the time. So do lots of other pack members.” Cassie said. She reached around to unhook her bra. At that point, Eric decided to throw caution to the wind. <br />
<br />
Like Nate, he practically tore his clothing from his body, as Cassie finished taking off her underwear. By the time she’d finished transforming, Eric was standing in his Spiderman boxers. Cassie noticed that both Spidey and Eric had a bulge in the same spot. <br />
<br />
“Nice underwear.” Cassie said. Eric blushed a bit, and slipped his boxers off. His erection grew harder as he transformed. His boyhood doubled in size, as did the rest of his body. Eric felt a rush of endorphins as his spine elongated, and his legs stretched. His tail was wagging behind him, and thick pads developed on the bottoms of his growing feet. <br />
<br />
Eric gripped his throbbing cock with a clawed hand, growling as his face pushed out into a muzzle. As the transformation finished, Eric came. It wasn’t a very large load for a werewolf, but it was when you compared it to anything Eric would have produced with his normal equipment. <br />
<br />
“Sorry. Still getting used to…”<br />
<br />
“Believe me, I know. I’ll make a deal with you. If you can catch me, you can fuck me all you want.” Cassie smirked. Eric was about to say something, but Cassie took off into the woods. <br />
<br />
“Hey, no fair!” Eric shouted after her. With his wolf ears he could clearly hear Cassie laughing. <br />
<br />
“All’s fair in love and war.” she called back to Eric. There was a spark ignited inside Eric’s chest and he raced after his mate. At first on two legs, but Eric quickly realized that wasn’t going to get him very far. So he dropped onto all fours. And was amazed how much faster he was going. <br />
<br />
His blood was racing, and instincts took over. Eric’s nose locked onto Cassie’s scent, and he pushed the muscles in his legs to go faster. Faster and faster until the trees became a green and brown blur. He saw her tail streaming out behind her as she ran. Eric almost ran into a tree as he made a sharp turn. <br />
<br />
“You’re gonna have to be faster than that Eric.” Cassie mocked, fleeing from the scene. Eric growled in frustration, and started after her again. His mind was pretty much blank. All he could think about was catching his prey. Cassie glanced back, and saw Eric’s amber eyes locked on hers. <br />
<br />
“Really getting into this, isn’t he?” she thought. Cassie was glad Eric was enjoying himself. He needed more “fun” in his life. And as “fun” as sex was, it was good to show him the two could have fun doing something a little more freeing. <br />
<br />
Cassie though Eric needed a little more enticing, so she lifted her tail up to give him a full view of her wet folds. Still running behind her, Eric felt drops of something wet hit his muzzle. Licking them off, he knew what they were the second his tongue touched the warm liquid. And it had the effect Cassie wanted. <br />
<br />
In a surge of energy and hormones, Eric launched himself forward. He pounced on Cassie’s back and the two rolled on the ground until Eric was on top. His rocket well out of its sheath, and a very hungry look in his eyes. <br />
<br />
“You win.” Cassie said, playfully weak. Eric smirked and wasted no time in taking his prize. In the distance, he heard another wolf couple howling. <br />
<br />
“Nate and Alex?” some small part of him wondered. But soon his own howls filled the air, and then Cassie’s. Moon Lake’s forests were full of happy werewolf howls, and devoid of woodland animals who feared they’d be eaten as soon as the wolves finished copulating. Of course neither couple had any interest in eating the local chipmunks or squirrels. They were far too busy enjoying themselves.</p>
