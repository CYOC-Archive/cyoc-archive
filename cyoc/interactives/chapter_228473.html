<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><br />
After Jeff input new parameters, TJ felt a queasiness. He stumbled and fell...<br />
<br />
He was still standing only now things were very.,..different. The house had changed. It wasn&#39;t quite the same. It was a different house. Much bigger than before. He was standing and immediately knew he was much taller than he had been before. He was six foot two, and he caught his reflection in a small round mirror. <br />
<br />
He had gray to white hair and a face that could only belong to a man in his fifties or sixties. Not sixty yet, he though with a grin. He flexed his enormous arms. And I could beat the shit out of most younger men. Look at this fuckin&#39; muscle. <br />
<br />
Muscle? He returned his gaze to the mirror and then headed to the bathroom. Jeff was soon there, all twelve years looking up with total admiration at his new grandfather. <br />
<br />
&quot;What did you do, Jeffy?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Isn&#39;t it obvious, Grandpa?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Grandpa! I&#39;m only...fifty six years old! I&#39;m not old enough to be...oh wait. I had your father when I was young. Knocked up your grandmother...she left when I came out and...whoa! I was in the Marine Corps!!??&quot; <br />
<br />
A whole new lifetime of memories flooded into him. Jeff&#39;s father was no longer in the picture. TJ was raising his grandson Jeff by himself. The two of them had a great life together. TJ was a silver haired bodybuilder. A real man. A short white goatee was the piece de resistance. He grinned. This was way better than being a little boy! <br />
<br />
&quot;Do you like it?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I...do. I think. I think I need to really explore it first.&quot; <br />
<br />
Grandpa TJ walked around his new house. It was decorated with a very masculine ideal. No frilly things. Lots of military memorabilia, photos of himself in uniform. He looked down at Jeff and felt such pride. My grandson! he thought. <br />
<br />
&quot;I know. Let&#39;s go for a ride in my new truck. I&#39;ll drive.&quot; <br />
<br />
Grandpa&#39;s truck was sleek and black and had huge tires. He drove it around the neighborhoot and out to the countryside. He found a nice isolated little area near some farmland and got out to stretch his new tall legs. <br />
<br />
&quot;Boy, this is great. I never drove before today but it&#39;s like I&#39;ve been doing it for decades! That little machine of yours sure is great, boy.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;It also changes reality, Dad.&quot; <br />
<br />
Dad? That&#39;s right. Raising his grandson, he encouraged the boy to call him Dad. Jeff&#39;s father was currently a bum who had abandoned Jeff, but Greandpa TJ was much more of a man than his son. He was raising Jeffy with old fashioned valued. No liberal TV or movies to corrupt his grandson. They watched lots of war movies and fight videos. <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll say it does. These muscles sure are impressive. Not bad for an old man, huh Jeff?&quot; He flexed for his grandson, who looked at the bicep ball up with eagerness and a certain fascination that could only come from a young gay boy who was just beginning to realize that his grandfather was a walking sex magnet. Everything from TJ&#39;s stubble and the lines of his face to his voice and hair was entirely sexy. A silver DILF all the way. <br />
<br />
&quot;Your muscles are amazing! Can I feel? Please, Grandpa?&quot; Grandpa TJ smirked as his grandson felt up his enormous arms. Little queerbait loves my fuckin muscle, he thought proudly. Why wouldn&#39;t he? I&#39;m a sexy man and the sexy apple doesn&#39;t fall far from tht tree. <br />
<br />
&quot;How about I use em to lift you up in the air, sweetheart?&quot; Grandpa TJ lifted up Jeffy in his arms. Jeff felt so safe and protected. His grandpa smelled so good. The musky smell of jock sweat, cologne and cigar smoke wafted from grandpa&#39;s mouth. Grandpa talked to him in a soothing tone. &quot;Now then, Jeffy, do you like having a nice strong daddy, hmm? I like being a nice strong daddy and I can&#39;t imagine going back to being your little brother again. I think we should stay in this reality for now. What do you think?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d like that very much.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I think it would sound better to call me Sir after you say that. It would feel right to have you call me Sir,&quot; Grandpa TJ told him. &#39;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, Sir.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s a good boy.&quot; He gave his new grandson who he thought of as a son a peck on the cheek. Grandpa TJ&#39;s rough stubble felt scratchy on Jeffy&#39;s prepubescent cheeks. He blushed. Then he was overcome with affection and boyish exploration. With his heart beating fast, he kissed his grandpa on the cheek. Grandpa TJ&#39;s eyes widened. He gently kissed his grandson on the mouth briefly. <br />
<br />
&quot;Did you like that, son?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, Dad. Yes, Sir.&quot; <br />
<br />
Grandpa TJ held his grandson to his muscular chest and stroked his back as he held him, his little legs straddling his grandfather&#39;s torso. <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m starting to think we should get back home. There are a few things I&#39;d like to explore in this new muscular adult body of mine, son.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, Sir.&quot; <br />
<br />
When they god home, Grandpa TJ got out a couple of beers. <br />
<br />
&quot;Now, since I&#39;m in charge, I get to say if my grandson gets to do anything and I think you&#39;ve been a very good little boy lately. Why don&#39;t you enjoy a beer with me, son?&quot; Grandpa put the beer in his grandson&#39;s hands. Jeff smiled and blushed. <br />
<br />
&quot;REALLY??? WOW, THANKS, GRANDPA!&quot; Jeffy exclaimed as he drank his first beer. As a teenager he had experimented and snuck beers out of the fridge a few times, but this was the first time drinking a beer in this reality. It was strong and he liked it. Grandpa TJ hugged him. <br />
<br />
&quot;Look at that, my little man is growing up, isn&#39;t he?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Not unless you want me to, Grandpa.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I think I&#39;ll keep you in little boy form for a bit longer. You&#39;re very sexy at this age, you know that? I like it. I like the difference between us. I love how much BIGGER and MANLIER I am than you now, boy.&quot; They finished their beers after having a conversation about their new bodies and ages before Grandpa suggested they move to the couch. He put on a ball game as he cuddled with Jeffy, who felt safe and protected by his big strong grandpa&#39;s muscular frame. He spooned grandpa on the big wide couch and Grandpa TJ could definitely feel himself growing more than aroused...<br />
<br />
It wasn&#39;t long before he was kissing his grandson deeply, passionately, with true paternal love and affection, claiming his absolute love for Jeff as he kissed him, licked him, took his clothes off and then shucked his own off. He had military tattoos adorning his still muscular dad bod. Jeff looked in shock and awe at his grandpa&#39;s giant schlong, dangling there in all its banana sized glory. <br />
<br />
&quot;Not bad down there, either, huh boy? You like that? Why don&#39;t you feel it? Go ahead, don&#39;t be shy, boy.&quot; <br />
<br />
Jeff gingerly touched his grandpa&#39;s enormous and hefty rod. He wanted to taste it so bad....<br />
<br />
And soon he was sucking off his new grandfather, who was moaning and stroking. It wasn&#39;t too much longer after that before Grandpa TJ was pumping cum into his grandson&#39;s mouth for the first time. He creamed all over Jeffy&#39;s face after that and decorated his new submissive grandson all over with his endless supply of man juice. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hell yes, a chip off the old block. What a great gift you are! A wonderful little cocksucker you are, Jeffy!&quot; Grandpa scooped him up in his arms and kissed him deeply again, passionately, and declared he was in love with Jeff. He told him that he would always protect him and keep him safe, and that he would always be Jeff&#39;s big strong protector.</p>
