<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was not unusual for an uplifted Animalian to fall in love with a human, before or after conversion, so quickly. Some would think it may be because that since they have relatively little past experience of their own when they were simple animals, they weren&#39;t as judgemental as humans could be. Others would say their mutated hormones were telling them to find an available mate as soon as possible. Either way, Animalians had an uncanny way of quickly finding people who could be their perfect mate.<br />
<br />
Even with this common &#39;fact&#39; known, it was still rather surprising how quickly Meryl and Olly fell for each other. It didn&#39;t seem like they would bond so readily over witty barbs and sarcastic remarks. While Meryl was wearing a hearing aid so people wouldn&#39;t have to yell to make her understand, she retained a very strong stubborn streak with a heavy flare for sardonic. Now some people were wanting to take the hearing aid away.<br />
<br />
But apparently Meryl&#39;s mulishness really appealed to Olly. Apparently, he liked a woman with a sharp tongue and wit. Some other guys would think he was crazy. It wasn&#39;t hard to see why Meryl fell for Olly. Even while they were trading barbs, he did compliment her on the cleverness of her words. And the fact that he was built like a super heavyweight bodybuilder was probably the icing on the cake. Or vice versa.<br />
<br />
Meryl might have converted the same day she met Olly, but her brother, Ulysses, told her to wait. Firstly, it was Thanksgiving and it would be unseemly to act so...lewd on a special holiday. And secondly, she only just Olly and she should know if she can really bond with him before making a life-altering decision. Meryl personally thought that Ulysses can take his consideration and stuff it where the sun don&#39;t shine. But perhaps Meryl should get to know her stud a little more. Olly really liked being called &#39;stud&#39; and was happy to get to know her better.<br />
<br />
Still, the time of knowing each other was remarkably short before they decided to go for it. Olly got the de-vaccination which made his brand of the Animalian virus active again. The two of them then headed for Olly&#39;s apartment which he shared with his sister. Nelly was getting her gym bag packed for a long day away from home. &quot;Hey, sis,&quot; said Olly, &quot;Hope you have fun today.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, yeah,&quot; grumbled Nelly before shouldering her bag, &quot;You have your filly fun while I&#39;m out in the cold trying to keep in shape.&quot; She headed for the door before turning to Meryl. &quot;Don&#39;t take advantage of him,&quot; she said before she walked out.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s her problem?&quot; asked Meryl.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I think she&#39;s jealous that I&#39;ve gotten a mate before her,&quot; said Olly, &quot;Not as many guys want to be a mule as opposed to a horse or a donkey.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe I can help change some minds,&quot; said Meryl.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, don&#39;t worry about them now. It&#39;s just us today,&quot; said Olly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Right, so how do you want to start-&quot; began Meryl. She let out a squeak of surprise when Olly easily lifted her up to make her face meet his. Meryl quickly got what he was getting at and put her lips to his. It was a bit awkward, considering the big size differences of their mouths. Meryl&#39;s tongue could barely get past Olly&#39;s teeth and his tongue would have gagged her. But the important thing was that their saliva was mixing and the reactivated Animalian virus was getting into Meryl&#39;s system.<br />
<br />
The noticeable change was when Meryl&#39;s mouth didn&#39;t seem to be overshadowed by Olly&#39;s. Her lips were growing bigger as her face was beginning to push out. Her canines were becoming flat as her teeth were becoming broader. Her face was also pushing out into the beginning of a muzzle. She would have been happy to continue kissing, but her shoes were feeling cramped. She pulled away from the kiss and said, &quot;Olly, put me down. My feet...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, right,&quot; said Olly before taking her over to his bed and putting her on it. He noticed she was already a little heavier. Kneeling down, he started pulling off Meryl&#39;s shoes. The socks were removed to reveal white socks of fur were growing around her ankles. Her toes were hardening as they became covered in keratin, fusing together into one mass. Olly massaged her changing feet as they finished the transition into hooves.<br />
<br />
Meryl sighed and said, &quot;That feels surprisingly nice, for such big clumsy hooves.&quot; She gripped the bed with fingers that were growing larger, keratin spreading over her fingertips to form miniature hooves. Her body had been swelling in size for quite a bit. After all, Jack was the offspring of an Ardennes and a mammoth donkey, which made for a really big mule. Her pants were ripping from the pressure of keeping her growing legs contained. Her hips had stretched the backside hard, allowing her growing tail room.<br />
<br />
Olly looked up at Meryl&#39;s face, which was halfway to a mule&#39;s muzzle right now. Her ears had grown considerably as they were about halfway up her head. She had kept her black hair at shoulder length before, but now her shoulders were getting farther away as her neck grew out. Her shirt was also looking too small as her mass increased, especially to her bust. &quot;You wanna take those clothes off or are you trying to look like a kid in denial of growing up?&quot; asked Olly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well if I must...&quot; said Meryl with a groan. She had been wanting to She-Hulk her way out of her clothes, but they were proving harder to rip than she thought. It was actually a relief to start peeling them off, feeling the air on her growing fur. Olly took the time to admire her new coat, which already looked to be winter length. She was most black like him, but she had some white parts too, namely on her feet, the tip of her muzzle, and her stomach and chest. Olly liked the way her now-black nipples stood out on her white breasts.<br />
<br />
Meryl looked over her new equine body as she felt the transformation come to a stop. She was bigger, no question. From her current point of view, she looked more like a horse. But she hadn&#39;t seen a mirror to see how her ears and muzzle were much more like a donkey&#39;s. And yet, this wasn&#39;t all she was expecting. &quot;You know, I feel good, but I don&#39;t that great. And shouldn&#39;t I be bigger?&quot; she asked. She hefted up her breasts, which while a little bigger were still sagging. And she didn&#39;t look as jacked as Nelly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, that was just Dose One,&quot; said Olly before unzipping his pants, &quot;Here comes Dose Two.&quot; The phrase &#39;hung like a mule&#39; isn&#39;t as common as &#39;hung like a horse&#39; or even &#39;hung like a donkey&#39;. Meryl thought this was a grave injustice for overlooking such a piece of natural art. True, mules were infertile hybrids, which means they don&#39;t see much action naturally. But as far as Meryl was concerned, Olly was twice as much male as any stallion or jack. And she wanted him really badly.<br />
<br />
Meryl lied back on the bed and said, &quot;Well, are you just gonna stand there like a flagpole or are you going to put that somewhere?&quot;<br />
<br />
Olly grinned before stripping off his clothes. Looming over Meryl, he really overshadowed her. &quot;Get ready for a wild ride,&quot; he said before thrusting into her.<br />
<br />
Meryl let out a loud moan as she felt him enter. She had never felt so...so full before. And when he started rocking, it was more than she could describe. The eager mule was already leaking into her, starting the next set of changes. Her muscles had grown before, but she wasn&#39;t toned. That was quickly changing. Her arms were getting thicker as her muscles became more visible through her skin. Her somewhat paunchy stomach was flattening out before her abs started pushing up to the surface. Her legs were becoming real pillars of strength, stronger than human could hope to be. But they were also growing more curvy. This was complimented by her hips growing a little rounder and her ass filling out. Her breasts were losing their sag as they became rounder, filled with renewed life and milk. Meryl never felt so much energy, the grey hairs in her hair become swallowed up in the reinvigorated black. She was thrusting back harder herself, pushing them closer to the edge. Then the two mules let out loud brays that faded into whinnies as they hit the peak. Olly unloaded a large amount of semen which was more potent than a true mule&#39;s.<br />
<br />
The two of them panted a little, their dark fur coated with sweat. Meryl twitched her ears before reaching up and pulling out her hearing aid. She couldn&#39;t believe she had forgotten that. But her hearing was still loud and clear. &quot;First time with a real mare, big boy?&quot; asked Meryl.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, there are plenty of mares around,&quot; said Olly, &quot;In fact, there&#39;s a real surplus of them these days. But they don&#39;t have enough jenny in them like you do.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I&#39;d like to have a little more jack in me,&quot; said Meryl before extracting herself from under Olly. She took some to admire her younger, stronger, sexier self. She was definitely a match for Nelly now, though Nelly has probably been training longer. But Meryl didn&#39;t want to train right now. She positioned herself on the bed, allowing her rear to pointed towards Olly, her tail swishing invitingly. &quot;What do you think, stud?&quot; she asked.<br />
<br />
Olly looked at her perfect round buttocks and said, &quot;I think I&#39;m an ass man.&quot;<br />
<br />
Meryl groaned and said, &quot;That pun was almost bad enough to put me off.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Really?&quot; asked Olly with concern.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, get in here,&quot; said Meryl, &quot;But no more pillow talk.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think you&#39;ll grow to like it,&quot; said Olly before putting his cock into her again.<br />
<br />
Meryl groaned before saying, &quot;Don&#39;t count on it. I&#39;m pretty stubborn.&quot;</p>
