<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;And now, more details are emerging about the mysterious assailant to which social media has ascribed such colorful monikers as &#39;The Ballsack Brute&#39; and &#39;The Nutsack Savage&#39;... I&#39;m here on location at Argendale High School where dozens of boys have become victims of a series of brutal assaults.... The boys have little in common, and the identity of their attacker is as of yet unknown.... The singular common thread that joins these seemingly random attacks is the method, and of course, the gender of the victims. It seems each boy received a powerful blow to the genital region, most are recovering at home but at least three boys have been admitted to St.Vincent&#39;s hospital for monitoring...&quot;<br />
<br />
Lyle slowly emerged from a deep almost comatose state... he groggily opened his eyes, surprised to find himself seated alone in the living room. His body was sunken deep into the generous padding of the old, seldom used, leather recliner. He was covered with a billowy down comforter from the linen closet, and he wasn&#39;t wearing any pants...<br />
<br />
&quot;How did I get in here?&quot; He wondered, taking in his surroundings. Nobody ever spent time in the living room, it was mostly his Mom&#39;s personal canvasing space for displaying the familie&#39;s &#39;nicest&#39; and most delicate things... Lyle wasn&#39;t even sure he was allowed to be in there...<br />
<br />
Suddenly becoming aware of his full bladder he tried adjusting his weight forward slightly to stand up but was immediately greeted by an intense body consuming pain that radiated from his testicles.<br />
<br />
&quot;GOD.... JEEEEZ!&quot; he cried, taking a moment to recover from the shock... &quot;Mom?!.... MOM!... I can&#39;t get up!...&quot;<br />
<br />
He strained to listen for any signs of activity in the house but there didn&#39;t seem to be anyone around, all he could make out was a stupid news story playing on the TV in the other room. Lyle never had any use for the news before but this report seemed different, he was picking up random words here and there that made him start to take the story more and more seriously... &quot;Hey, That&#39;s my school!&quot; He realized, starting to absorb the reporter&#39;s words in earnest.<br />
<br />
&quot;School officials have yet to release the names of the Nutsack Savage&#39;s victims, some families are calling for privacy in these uncomfortable times, but police investigators are eager to shed new light on this disturbing onslaught and are calling on the public to provide any information they can that may aid in apprehending this cowardly menace...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh... Sweetie... You&#39;re awake.&quot; His Mom said, appearing silently in the doorway behind him. &quot;How are you feeling, do you remember what happened? Did you see the boys who attached you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh?.. I... I got attacked?&quot; He said with confusion, having to clear his throat which felt dry and slightly puffy...<br />
<br />
He looked down at his crotch as it dawned on him that HE had been one of the boys the news lady had been talking about.... He strained to recall what had happened to him, how he had ended up in that chair with a pair of swollen marbles, but he couldn&#39;t be sure of anything he was able to piece together...<br />
<br />
&quot;I got called to the office... I was in the hallway and I... I think someone attacked me, it hurt SOOOO bad...&quot; He groaned, feeling the pain anew as his balls twinged yet again with an aching tenderness that seemed to vanish and reaper in unpredictable, random waves.<br />
<br />
&quot;I gotta pee... but I can&#39;t get up, Mom&quot; He said pitifully... <br />
<br />
&quot;I brought you this.&quot; She said, handing Lyle a plastic canister with an angled opening. &quot;You&#39;ll have to pee in this until you feel better, Lye. And until you&#39;re able to move enough to reach the toilet you&#39;ll need to stay down here in the comfy chair, and we should restrict your diet-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not hungry&quot; He said miserably, cutting his mom off and fiddling with the urine canister... &quot;I&#39;m sorry Mom.. This sucks.... There&#39;s not even a  TV in here...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You can use my tablet... I&#39;ll get the charger and you can use it as much as you want, no limits on screen time...&quot; she replied, eager to accommodate.. She fished the electronic device out of her bag and handed it to him with an encouraging smile...<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks, Mom.&quot; Lyle said, relaxing a little... It WAS nice to be doted over...<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll give you your privacy now, but I&#39;ll be in the kitchen if you need me, sweetheart. I&#39;m going to try out that special brownie pan that makes every brownie an extra chewy edge piece just like you like...&quot; She said with gentle enthusiasm, wrapping her arm under his chin and up around his face, planting a kiss on his cheek lovingly with that creaky, indulgent, groaning sound she always made whenever she was loving on her boy... Then she retreating off to the kitchen, leaving Lyle by himself...<br />
<br />
Lyle did have some trouble using the urine canister. It was impossible to manipulate the clothing around his package, let alone move his own dick without causing extreme pain, but eventually he accomplished the task... While he had his junk on display, he decided he might as well take a look at the damage. Investigating as gently as he could, he was able to get a pretty clear glimpse of his balls. They were huge! The skin was pulled tight and he couldn&#39;t tell if it was full of fluid or what, but the colors he saw were disturbingly varied and vibrant... There were shades of blue and purple, red there were even some bright yellow and shadowy dark areas. Not wanting to see any more, and praying things would look more normal the next time he took a peek, he settled in for some relaxation and much needed entertainment and diversion.<br />
<br />
His social media feeds were FLOODED with chatter about the BSB (Ballsack Bandit), seems social media had settled on that over the various other names reported on the news. People were making countless memes and cracking all kinds of jokes. It was all anyone was talking about. It looked like the whole thing was going viral...<br />
<br />
Suddenly Lyle&#39;s attention was drawn to a notification bubble alerting him to the fact that his buddy Camden wanted to chat. He eagerly opened the chat window, excited to talk to somebody about all the madness...<br />
<br />
Camden L. Fisher - Hey Bro!<br />
<br />
 	Uh... hey... BRO?!? ( &#865;&#9684;&#8239;&#860;&#662; &#865;&#9684;)<br />
<br />
Camden was always a bit of a goober and enjoyed adopting random, idiosyncratic language for no reason... It made Lyle feel good to be talking with his pal again and the bro speak affectation was just a welcome part of the charm, but for some reason it felt good responding in kind... Maybe he was just in a weird mood but it felt satisfying acknowledging their brotherly closeness...<br />
<br />
Lyle dismissed the unusual thought with a shake of his head... That was dumb.<br />
<br />
Camden L. Fisher - Sorry we didn&#39;t get to hang yesterday, <br />
I bet you&#39;ve been wondering what happened to me at school... <br />
Well, you&#39;re not going to believe this, but... <br />
I got sacked by the BSB!<br />
I just got back from the hospital!<br />
My balls are HUGE and I can barely move! O_o<br />
Doctor says I need to come back for surgery if the swelling doesn&#39;t go down...<br />
I can&#39;t believe how this is blowing up on-line...<br />
People found out it happened to Jason Moro and he&#39;s being socially CRUCIFIED for it... &#65340;(&#9678;o&#9678;)&#65295;&#65281;<br />
So, obvi don&#39;t tell anyone it happened to me, K?<br />
<br />
 	You got it Camden. :) Truth is... <br />
 	It happened to me too. (-_-;)<br />
 	I just woke up... I can&#39;t get out of this chair!<br />
 	<br />
Camden L. Fisher - NO WAY! That SUCKS Bro!<br />
How are your Nards?!<br />
<br />
 	Not well, I&#39;m afraid... A little swollen I guess, kind of bruised maybe.<br />
<br />
Camden L. Fisher - Mine are totally trashed! The skins pulled TIGHT.<br />
They&#39;re Black and blue and red all over... I can&#39;t even describe...<br />
The doctors almost had to make an incision to relieve the pressure...<br />
but decided to wait and see... thank GOD!<br />
You&#39;re lucky yours aren&#39;t so bad.<br />
I&#39;ve got a whole home treatment regimen I need to do to<br />
bring the swelling down and prevent necrosis...<br />
<br />
  	What are they having you do?!<br />
 	...Asking for a friend. (^_^)<br />
<br />
Camden L. Fisher - Ice packs, NSAIDs...<br />
glute flexes to keep the blood flowing...<br />
Rest and fluids...<br />
Are you a little worse off than you made it sound?<br />
<br />
  	Nah... Ship shape.. :)<br />
<br />
Camden L. Fisher - &#9684;_&#9684;<br />
...Well I gotta go. <br />
My mom&#39;s having the cops over for tea and interrogations.<br />
<br />
  	Really?<br />
  	We gotta chat afterward... This is insane!<br />
<br />
Camden L. Fisher - You got it Dude.<br />
<br />
Lyle adjusted himself in his seat trying to get comfortable and He experimentally flexed his glutes every so often to keep his blood flowing, just in case... After a while he was starting to feel really hot under the highly insulating down comforter so he yanked the blanket forcefully away from his foot causing the corner to fold away from him, leaving his left leg fully exposed to the cooler living room air. He could immediately feel the fine layer of perspiration begin to evaporate off his leg, bringing a brief refreshing chill.<br />
<br />
Lyle spent the next few hours chatting off and on with Camden, growing hotter and hotter as the day went on. Eventually he had to ditch the comforter and even wound up asking his mom to set up a pedestal fan to help him stay cool. He was starting to sweat like crazy, and it was making him stick uncomfortably to the leather recliner...<br />
<br />
&quot;FUCK!&quot; he shouted as his frustration boiled over. He couldn&#39;t take any more of the maddening discomfort he was feeling as he was forced to sit in that sticky leather chair.<br />
<br />
&quot;Lyle Allen! What on earth?&quot; His mom chided from the other room. &quot;Language young man!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Mrs.Winters.&quot; he wanted to reply in an insubordinate, mocking tone, but was somehow able to suppress the urge...<br />
<br />
Lyle took a deep breath and tried to reign in his frustrations. He just felt like he was out of control... His muscles were tensing, he clenched his jaw and balled his fists, slamming them at his sides with abandon... He couldn&#39;t stop, he was PISSED like he hadn&#39;t been in a long time.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is bullshit!...&quot; He thought to himself, continuing to let the unfamiliar emotions flow since it seemed like they couldn&#39;t be stopped.<br />
<br />
After a few more minutes of stewing and small physical outbursts the torrent of anger seemed to fade and he found he could once again tolerate his uncomfortable, slimy surroundings, but his output of sweat had actually grown worse! Constant beads of sweat were forming and condensing in his armpits, oozing drop after drop of chilly liquid down his sides... His hair was matted with perspiration and his shirt had visible dark bands around the collar, underarms and deep into the chest...<br />
<br />
&quot;What was all that about?&quot; His mom said appearing again behind him. &quot;Oh my. You&#39;re drenched... Are you running a fever?&quot;<br />
<br />
She felt his forehead finding it to be cool and clammy, and a quick temperature check showed he was just fine. Not wanting to leave anything to chance she called Coach Dun who put her mind at ease. It seams acquired hyper hydrolysis is a possible side effect of acute testicular injuries caused by hormonal shifts, similar to menopausal hot flashes. It might improve or even go away over time... but either way it was not a cause for concern, it was a totally medically benign condition so long as he stayed hydrated. He also told her not to be concerned by other signs of increased hormone output, and that, believe it or not, any such change would be a good sign that the testicles were healthy and functioning well.<br />
<br />
Lyle decided he should try to take his mind off the whole BSB saga and watch a movie for a change. He found a pretty standard action flick that he&#39;d never seen before. It had a hot female lead with a rockin&#39; bod and it was turning him on more than usual. He had always been straight but never had much of a libido. It had certainly never been strong enough to distract him from any other aspect of his life, but there was a deep yearning welling inside him to act out some increasingly perverse fantasies with this movie heroine... It wasn&#39;t his fault really... After all, the movie was serving that chick up to him like a piece of meat. The skimpy clothes, the inventive camera angles... It was sexual CANDY for his lizard brain, he&#39;d just never quite appreciated it as much before... He hadn&#39;t even realized but his dick had been hard for the last 20 minutes and it wasn&#39;t going away.... He had to jack off!.. But how could he? His balls were so sore and he was sitting out in the open, uncovered...<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom!&quot; He called expectantly.<br />
<br />
&quot;What is it dear?&quot; Came the reply<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m hungry...&quot; He said, thinking it was a lie but suddenly realizing it was profoundly true.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re trying to keep you light on food, Hun. Are you feeling like you can make it to the toilet?&quot;<br />
<br />
Lyle shook his head exaggeratedly with a telltale grimace on his face, but he needed her out of the house and he needed FOOD!<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I don&#39;t know what you can have... Maybe, chicken broth?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;PROTIEN!&quot; Lyle burst out louder than he had intended, feeling kind of manic... &quot;Egg whites... I mean, not just egg whites, LOTS of egg whites. Like a whole carton of egg whites... 32oz of egg whites, no 64oz... and salsa.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lyle was fidgeting and scratching himself... His Mom was concerned about his behavior but assumed it could be hormones... She didn&#39;t want to bother the Coach again so she decided it would be best to get Lyle what he wanted... She got her things together and headed out to the store to pick up lots of egg whites, NSAIDs, and sports drinks to keep Lyle hydrated.<br />
<br />
As soon as his mom was out the door Lyle started delicately extricating his modest erection from the confines of this moist boxers. Every little movement sent flashes of pain through his groin but he was driven by a primal urge he couldn&#39;t refuse. One thing was for sure, he was going to have to be gentle... He played delicately with his foreskin, teasing it back and forth as softly as he could, trying not to put any undue stress on the base of his shaft. In his desperate need for every bit of possible lubrication he instinctively dribbled a clear string of spittle from his mouth onto the shaft of his penis, its path aided by the constant breeze of the pedestal fan. The fan-cooled liquid sent a renewed feeling of pleasure and a comfortable slick sensation into his generous ministrations as his perverse thoughts mingled with his horny teenage drive. He knew he shouldn&#39;t be doing this, his balls were in no condition to perform, but he felt like he had no choice. He was lost in a sexual torrent that he couldn&#39;t fight... He had to play his part, and his balls would just have to play theirs... Wanting to feel that renewed sense of slickness again, he sent another slimy string of spit from his lips. It strung along silently through the breeze like liquid silk, joining the wet slurry of fluids that were already delicately sliding around the folds of his cock&#39;s flesh. His fingers were moving on their own now, they knew their limits and were moving gently with delicate care to arouse and stimulate without causing pain, leaving his mind free to entertain him with deviant images of perverse pleasures he&#39;d never imagined before... <br />
<br />
It happened suddenly, when Lyle hadn&#39;t even expected it, but he felt he&#39;d reached the point of no return. His penile muscles were contracting and bearing down for the final event. He closed his eyes and braced himself for the long awaited release. There was an unusual hesitation as the involuntary contractions kicked in, as though they were being forced to pump an unnaturally lumpy load of curdy jiz, but as the first spurt of cum cleared the tip of his penis, the floodgates seemed to lift and spurt after spurt of hot creamy cum slid effortlessly and pleasurably from his shaft. He could actually feel the relief in his balls as the hot gooey liquid coursed though him, it felt like the involuntary pumping actions of his muscles were unnecessary, it was as though the jiz was being propelled by the constant pressure that had built up in his balls. It was unlike anything he&#39;d ever felt before and it was magical...<br />
<br />
Opening his eyes and coming to his senses, Lyle was horrified... <br />
<br />
What had he done? <br />
<br />
Not only had he totally lost control of himself in a way he would NEVER do, but there was cum EVERYWHERE!<br />
<br />
It had gotten all over the arm rests of the recliner, all over his shirt and boxers. Even his his mom&#39;s tablet had a few drops of goo seeming to melt and liquefy as they flowed obscenely across the tablet&#39;s glass panel, pooling and drip disgustingly off the side.<br />
<br />
What was he going to do? He couldn&#39;t move, and he didn&#39;t have anything to clean this mess up with... His mom could be back any minute!..</p>
