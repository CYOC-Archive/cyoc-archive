<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">  &quot;Well, Dad, I know you love me and wouldn&#39;t want to change me for anything in the world but I have overheard you talking to Mom about how you wish you had a son to carry on the family line. I don&#39;t hate being a girl or anything like that but I would like to become the boy you&#39;d never had.&quot; Jessica turned to the shop clerk. &quot;That is what I want, please make me a guy,&quot; Jessica informed them.<br />
  Andrew had tears of pride in his eyes as he said, &quot;Jessica, I love you very much and you don&#39;t have to do this for me but I accept whatever you want to do. I&#39;m glad to have you as my child, son or daughter.&quot; Turning to the clerk himself, he affirmed, &quot;Let her have everything she wants.&quot;<br />
  Jessica hugged her father and said, &quot;Thank you, Dad. I love you too and I gladly would sacrifice anything for you, even my girlhood. I&#39;m proud to have you as my father.&quot;<br />
  &quot;Alright, then&quot; remarked the clerk. &quot;You shouldn&#39;t be surprised to hear you aren&#39;t the first set of parents and children to make such a request. We have what you need right over here.&quot;<br />
  The clerk quickly walked to a nearby display of various necklaces, amulets and medallions and selected an amulet set with a deep purple stone. &quot;This amulet will be able to change you and any possession or accessories you touch them to into a form appropriate to the gender you want to have.&quot; She turned to Jessica and queried, &quot;May I demonstrate its use?&quot;<br />
  Jessica nodded enthusiastically and said, &quot;Whatever you need to do.&quot; The clerk touched the amulet&#39;s stone to Jessica&#39;s overalls. The change was subtle, the overalls changed only slightly to more of a boy&#39;s cut instead of a girl&#39;s style, including gaining a slight bit roomier in the crotch.<br />
  Jessica&#39;s eyes went wide as she watched the change. She was still herself but now she was wearing boy&#39;s overalls. The clerk then touched her hair to it and Jessica&#39;s hair began to redo itself in a male hairstyle, the ponytail holder falling to the floor with nothing it hold in it.<br />
  &quot;You may use the amulet to modify the clothes you&#39;re wearing now or we have a selection of clothes you can choose to buy and we&#39;ll package up your existing clothes to take home with you.&quot;<br />
  &quot;I&#39;d like to take the amulet with me to the changing room and see what happens,&quot; replied Jessica. <br />
  &quot;That&#39;s perfectly fine,&quot; said the clerk. &quot;It&#39;s right over there and we&#39;ll wait for you outside.&quot;<br />
  Jessica took the amulet, picked up the hair tie from the floor and went into the changing room the clerk has indicated. Still a bit astonished by the altered overalls she was wearing, she took her high tops, overalls and the red t-shirt she&#39;d been wearing off and looked in the full body mirror in the room. She looked funny with a boy&#39;s haircut, a training bra that barely had to cover her small A cup breasts, panties and socks.<br />
  She lightly caressed her breast and said, &quot;I guess this is goodbye, girls. I hardly knew you.&quot; She was about to touch the amulet to herself when she decided instead to remove her undergarments as well while it would still be easy to do so. <br />
  She unhooked her bra and set it aside, removed her socks and looked at herself in panties for the last time for the time being. It was odd thinking this would be the last time she&#39;d wear such underwear she&#39;d worn since finishing potty training. She stripped them off as well and made a little pile of clothing she had come in wearing.<br />
  Doing a quick intake of breath and then releasing in slowly, she said to herself, &quot;Well, now&#39;s the time.&quot; And then picking up the amulet from where she&#39;d set it, she touched it to herself. <br />
  She immediately noticed she was growing in height and her shoulders were growing out to make length. Her arms extended out further then they&#39;d ever been before and her hands began growing. Her breasts sank back into her chest, instead becoming an average teenage boy&#39;s pectoral muscles as the abdomen widened out to masculine proportions. Her legs and feet grew to match her arms and hands. <br />
  Her throat grew a lump in it, forming her new Adam&#39;s Apple and her face altered to a more boyish appearance. Then she felt her vagina tingling as it began closing up permanently, her clitoris growing long and thick as it formed into a penis with the urethra opening up in the glans.<br />
  Her labia fused together and expanded into a scrotum and caught her now descending testicles while her hips sank inward to be even with her abdomen. Her backside hadn&#39;t grown out that much but it still shrank into a male form. Looking up and down, she was now fully a guy top to bottom. <br />
  Going through the clothes she&#39;d come in with, she selected the training bra and touched it to the amulet and watch the cloth grown out and change form into a tank top she then put on.Next choosing the panties, she considered what kind of men&#39;s underwear it would turned into and mentally chose boxer briefs before touching the rock to them, the panties changed exactly the form she pictured.<br />
  Fascinated by the prospects, she pictured different colors and designs and watched as the boxer briefs went from design to design, finally choosing one she liked and put them on, positioning her new genitals comfortably in the pouch. She next changed the socks to the appropriate size and desired design. She was now fully dressed in masculine undergarments for the first time in her life.<br />
  Next she chose the red tee, it didn&#39;t fit her new body, she touched the amulet&#39;s stone to it and watched it grow to fit her. The overalls were next. She didn&#39;t have to do anything to it as it was already guy sized so on went the Tee and overalls.<br />
  The high tops grew to fit with a mere touch and on they went. Tying the laces, she look at the hair tie she&#39;d brought in with her. She wondered what it would become but didn&#39;t chose a form, she let it happen to become whatever it would be. It turned rigid, doubled into two round sections with tinted lenses and little arms on the side. They were now a pair of sunglasses, she put them on her hairline just above her eyes.<br />
  She was now done completely. She hadn&#39;t brought a purse in with her so she didn&#39;t have to consider what to do with one. Now she had fully transformed into a 13 year old boy. She once again looked in the full mirror, seeing her full masculinity for the very first time. She thought herself quite handsome as a dude.<br />
  &quot;Well, time to show myself off,&quot; Jessica said to herself, picking up the amulet and dropping it in her pocket, opening the door and leaving the dressing room.<br />
  Walking back over to her father and the store clerk, she said, &quot;Alright, here I am! What do you think, Dad? I&#39;m your son now. Call me Jesse from now on.&quot;<br />
  &quot;Well, Jesse, it&#39;s nice to meet you,&quot; remarked Andrew, giving his now son a hug. &quot;I&#39;m proud of you and love you now matter who you are, what you look like or what sex you are. You&#39;re my boy now.&quot; He once again had proud tears in his eyes.</p>
