<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Thanks to Juan Tiller for encouraging me to continue and contributing the rough draft for this chapter!</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Rusty walked his beat, fuming. Normally he’d have his service vehicle, but Lenny had taken the day off, so he was stuck doing lame jobs like community outreach and soup kitchens. He plastered a smile on his face, but inwardly he wanted to punch something. He’d hoped the walk would take his mind off his recent embarrassment at the hands of the Auditor, but instead he stewed over it, rage barely simmering beneath the surface. He walked past a shop window and noticed himself-muscular, perfect. Troy didn’t believe that he, the perfect cop, best on the force, could keep him safe.<br />
<br />
“Fuck the Auditors.” Rusty slammed his fist against a wall and the brick cracked.<br />
<br />
He never felt so weak.<br />
<br />
Worse, all day his radio had filled with chatter about missing people and anthros. Other canine units reported the chemical signature of muscle relaxants near the areas the missing people had been taken. He knew who was behind it all. Right now, though, he was on the look out for the person RK had told him to meet with, lend him the edge he’d need to beat the Book of Transmutation.<br />
<br />
Rusty took a turn that would take him to a local coffee shop. He needed a pick-me up after all the stress the day was causing him. As he walked into the shop, he smiled as everyone looked up from their coffees and laptops and gawked at his perfect body. He could smell the tension in the air dissipate at his appearance. Rusty put people at ease.<br />
<br />
He went around the counter towards the tables in the back, hoping for some privacy, when he saw a massive young man sitting in his usual spot. If Rusty was a body builder, this guy was a power-lifter, absolutely huge, buds of horns poking through his dirty-blonde locks. Ears like a cow flicked when a barista called for ‘Tex”. The enormous man stood, golden furred tail flicking behind him, and he sauntered passed Rusty. Rusty sniffed the air, smelling a rich, masculine scent, like a barnyard and sun-baked grass and the earthy scent of precum.<br />
<br />
“Thanks,” the huge man, Tex, spoke, his voice deep and reverberated in the small shop. He took two cups and sat back at his table. <br />
<br />
That was when Rusty noticed the smaller man seated next to him. He was ruggedly handsome, Rusty would peg him at least in his mid-thirties. They were both clearly from out of town, as they scoped out the customers in the place. The man’s eyes landed on Rusty, and a strange smile lifted his lips.<br />
<br />
Rusty nodded at him and turned to the barista to place his order. He could overhear the two as they spoke to each other excitedly over their coffee. Rusty knew they were talking about him. He thanked the waitress and took the table next to the two out of towners. The smaller one eyed him up. Rusty winked.<br />
<br />
“I gotta admit, you are one hot dog, officer.” The man grinned at Rusty. “Not quite as big as ol’ Tex here, but real nice.”<br />
<br />
The bullish young man next to him, Tex, looked away shyly, blushing. “You are very fetchin’, sir.”<br />
<br />
“Name’s Rusty.” Rusty held out a paw.<br />
<br />
The man shook it. “Sam. This prime bull here is Tex.”<br />
<br />
“Pleased tah meet yah, officer.” Tex drawled.<br />
<br />
“So bio-modding is really catching on around here too, eh?” The smaller man asked.<br />
<br />
“Yup. Part of joining the K9 unit. But believe me, this muscle is all-natural.” Rusty flexed, popping a button on his uniform. “So what brings you folks into town?”<br />
<br />
“We’ve got a package to drop off to someone.” The bullish man looked to the smaller man, who tinkled the bell around his neck. The bullish man sidled closer to his partner, blushing.  <br />
<br />
Rusty sniffed, and detected a strange scent. It was almost lost underneath the masculine scent of the bullish man. He wasn’t quite sure what it was. It was clinical? Chemical? Kind of like latex.<br />
<br />
“In the mean time,” The smaller man turned to Rusty, “I’m using this town as inspiration for my product line. We’ve been taking in the sights and I bought a warehouse for sculpting my prototypes.”<br />
<br />
“You two stay safe.” Rusty warned. “There ‘s a killer on the loose.”<br />
<br />
“We will officer. I’ve got my big bull here to protect me.” The man stood and laid a tip on the table. “But I gotta make a quick pit stop at the warehouse. You alright with walking to the hotel, partner?”<br />
<br />
The bullish man nodded and stood. They both left, bullish man walking to the left, the small man turning right and heading farther into the downtown area. Rusty contemplated following them. They could be friends, they could be enemies. If one of them had the Book…there wasn’t much he could do except try to get the drop on them.<br />
<br />
Rusty watched the smaller man, Sam, as picked up speed, his eyes set on a figure thirty feet in front of him. A cougarman. The cougarman seemed to sense Sam&#39;s approach, glance behind him, and walk faster and turned into an alleyway. Sam followed him.<br />
<br />
Rusty’s hand fell on the butt of his gun and he took a step forward, but he hesitated. If this gun went off, people would come looking. Innocent bystanders who stood no chance against the Book would be put in harm’s way all to soothe Rusty’s ego.<br />
<br />
So instead he pulled up the side of his pants leg and fished out a small handgun and a small silencer. Subsonic ammunition and a small caliber meant a virtually silent shot. He’d brought them along on this patrol for exactly this reason. If this ‘Sam’ guy was the owner of the Book of Transmutation, Rusty was determined he would never let him have a chance to use it. He screwed on the silencer and checked his magazine before padding silently into the alleyway.<br />
<br />
The alley was filled with empty plastic bags and bushes. The stench of piss and sex and garbage that filled the passage way grew stronger the further in he got. Up ahead, the alley turned left. Rusty leaned against the corner and peered around it.<br />
<br />
“Inanimate!” Sam’s voice called.<br />
<br />
Rusty jumped and ducked back behind the safety of the corner, heart pounding. He heard something that sounded an awful lot like a body hit the asphalt with a thump. He controlled his breathing and took another look down the alley. His eyes widened and he cursed silently.<br />
<br />
Sam was leaning over the cougarman, hand on his muscular chest, gently rubbing the fur. At his touch, the fur altered, something in the way the light in the alley played off it, and it looked…artificial. Faux fur. It spread across the cougarman’s body. His muscular limbs shrank away into nothingness and the cougar’s cock rose from out of its sheath and stiffened. The man flicked it and it bobbed stiffly, unnaturally, the red colored cock had the sleek shine of latex. <br />
<br />
Soon, the only thing left was the cougarman’s eyes, but Sam stuck a finger in the cougar’s exposed anus and Rusty heard a whir.The cougar’s eyes glazed over, what clothes still left on his reduced frame shifting from street clothes to cheap Old West ruffian-style clothes.. Sam pulled his finger from the cougarman’s anus, some kind of fluid sticking to it, and wiped it off on his pants.<br />
<br />
Sam stood, hands on his hips, as though admiring his work. Rusty saw the Book of Transmutation laying on the ground next to the new sex doll. Slowly, he raised his pistol.<br />
<br />
“Another fine specimen for the product line. You ain’t quite done, still need to put some finishing touches on you. I know you’re scared, ya big pussycat, but when I’m done with you, you’re gonna love it.” Sam said. “Now let’s get you back to the workshop.”<br />
<br />
Sam picked up the cougarman, tossing the book on the sex doll&#39;s chest and that when Rusty fired. A doubletap, centermass. Sam stumbled and dropped to the ground, cougarman and Book falling with him. He lay on the ground, unmoving as the doll next to him. The Book was right underneath him.<br />
<br />
Rusty inched forward, looking for any signs of life from Sam’s prone body, and carefully leaned in to disarm him of his…Book. He kept his gun trained on the man’s head. He tugged, but the Book wouldn&#39;t budge. He shifted, setting the gun down to take the Book in both hands, when Sam rolled over.<br />
<br />
“Inanimate.” Sam wheezed, slapping Rusty’s arm.<br />
<br />
Rusty leapt up from the body and reached for his gun but his fingers wouldn’t grip the handle. His fingers felt soft and small. He stared at them as they disappeared into his palm and then his whole arm puffed out into a soft furry tube. <br />
<br />
He turned to run, but his feet felt soft and then he felt his legs puff out into useless soft stumps and he collapsed. Rusty tried to scream, call for help, but he couldn’t breath anymore and he realized his chest was filling with fluff and swelling. His eyes watered from lack of air and then his face felt puffy and his mind fogged and then the world was shrinking around him and so were his thoughts.<br />
<br />
Sam staggered towards him, unbuckling his shirt, revealing a Kevlar vest. He removed it, gasping, and shook out the two small calibers bullets. Rusty managed to fight through his warm, cottony thoughts to realize his error. If he’d used his service revolver, Sam would be dead, the Kevlar vest useless against .44 caliber rounds. <br />
<br />
“Weird. I was thinking teddy bear not police dog plush.” The man bent over and picked up Rusty and turned him over in his hands, examining him in fascination. “I know you can hear me. I don’t know if you realize it, but your town is not normal. Some guy with a magic book is running around changing you all into anthros.”<br />
<br />
“I’m obviously another book owner and for some reason you aren’t responding properly to my spells.” Sam plucked at Rusty’s tiny cute fake police dog outfit. “So I’m guessing you must have been close to the owner. A neighbor or someone who’d gotten too nosy.Bad luck for you is good luck for me. I’m happy I could find so many new models for my sex line.”<br />
<br />
Sam squeezed Rusty’s crotch. Nothing was there, he was sexless, but it still felt oddly pleasurable. Rusty wanted to resist it, but his mind was too clouded with cotton to even try.<br />
<br />
“I bet that felt good. Been experimenting, seeing how aware people are.” Sam smiled. “And if you’re wondering if Tex knows, he doesn’t. I’m keeping him in the dark. Once I’m done with you, you’ll be as loyal to me as he is.”<br />
<br />
Rusty watched the man tear a strip of cloth from his shirt and tie it tightly around his eyes and ears. He could hear nothing, only feel the sensation of being carried somewhere and then set down and then carried again before he settled onto a hard wooden table. It felt like an hour had passed but Rusty couldn’t be certain. Plushies didn’t have a head for time.<br />
<br />
A felt something odd hit him, altering his shape, his fundamental being, and for a moment he thought he was a cute bull police plushie. Then his body reverted. The sensation hit him again and again, only to revert each time. Rusty could barely gather his thoughts together coherently anymore. He couldn’t figure out what he was supposed to be.<br />
<br />
The blindfold lifted and he found himself sitting on a thick wooden work table in a small warehouse. In front of him was a mirror. A German Shepherd police dog plush was staring back with lifeless black beads for eyes.<br />
<br />
Anthro manikins lined the walls and a few anthros sex dolls like the cougarman were on other tables. Shipping containers and plastic wrap rolls were stacked in the corner. Various dildos and sleeves for fleshlights lined shelves. A computer sat near the door, with what looked like an inventory spreadsheet on it.<br />
<br />
Sam, the rather nondescript yet handsome man, appeared behind him in the mirror. He was frowning at the cougar sex doll. <br />
<br />
“Object.” He pointed at the cougarman. <br />
<br />
The cougarman’s limbs grew back, but then the entire sex doll altered, becoming more feral, until a realistic cougar lay on the table, legs in the air. Sam flipped it over onto its paws and placed a spiked collar on it. Sam rubbed his hands and turned his attention from the cougar to Rusty.<br />
<br />
“Alright, now to deal with you. Object!” Sam pointed at him.<br />
<br />
Rusty wished he could groan as his body gained mass, stubby limbs melting away, and he grew back to his original form. Like the cougar, his fur was fake. His mouth creaked open and his cock grew erect against his will. The spell ended and he lay there, helpless, looking at himself in the mirror. His face was the greatest offender. It was frozen in a particularly stupid, love-struck expression.<br />
<br />
“I gotta admit making you guys like Hank is getting easier and easier.” Sam grinned and wandered around the table to inspect Rusty properly. “Flawless. You look almost exactly like you did when you were alive.”<br />
<br />
Sam pressed a button near Rusty&#39;s groin and his cock vibrated, pre-cum oozing from his dick. Rusty wanted to write in pleasure. Then Sam stuck a finger in his mouth and his throat whirred to life and he felt something trying to suck the finger down, undulating. Sam removed his finger and stuck in Rusty’s anus. A similar whirring sound came from somewhere in his anus as the suction came to life. He felt something warm ooze out of his hole and around the finger. Sam pulled his finger out with a pop and wiped it on his pants.<br />
<br />
“Kinda gross, even knowing it’s just lube.” Sam said and eyed Rusty’s cock as it juddered. “Want me to turn that off?”<br />
<br />
Rusty wanted Sam to stroke him to completion because the pleasure wouldn’t stop rising and it was driving him nuts. Sam pondered Rusty’s cock for a minute and then pressed the button and Rusty’s cock stopped vibrating. If he could gnash his teeth in frustration, he would.<br />
<br />
“I’m not sure why you’re proving so difficult to change. I tried to change you into a bull while you were blindfolded but you kept resisting it somehow.” Sam sat down on a stool, exhausted. “And I know you’re thinking ‘why doesn’t he just find a bull anthro’. There aren’t any. Isn’t that nuts? A whole town full of anthros and somehow no one is a bull.”<br />
<br />
“Animate.” Sam pointed at Rusty.<br />
<br />
Rusty found he could move his head. He worked his jaw, which felt stiff. The rest of his body could flex but movement was limited to wiggles. He wanted to glare but his face wouldn’t move. <br />
<br />
“Why not change the unchanged townspeople.” Rusty rasped, his throat strangely dry.<br />
<br />
“Because I like the challenge.” Sam shoved his hand down Rusty’s throat.<br />
<br />
“Mmmph!” Rusty wanted to move and expected to gag, but instead his throat whirred to life and tried sucking off Sam’s fingers. He tried inhaling from his nose but that simply increased the suction. It took Rusty a moment to realize he wasn’t breathing. The whir of his throat was oddly pleasurable and he found himself drifting off, enjoying being used.<br />
<br />
Sam pulled his hand out and wiped his fingers on his pants and Rusty shook his head, clearing away the odd sex doll thoughts.<br />
<br />
“Enjoying the new addition I gave you?” Sam smiled. “You’re going to co-operate with me, and here’s why. If you don’t. you end up like that cougarman over there and go full feral. Before that, though, I’m going to change what breed you are.” Sam held up Rusty’s Driver’s license. “Also, I checked your address. It lines up with the shipping information on Hank. You wouldn’t happen to be Rustytrombone69?”<br />
<br />
“What do you want from me you sick fuck?” Rusty spat lube from his mouth. “Turn me back to normal!”<br />
<br />
Sam chuckled and retrieved a two dildos and a cock-sleeve from the wall. He placed the cock-sleeve on Rusty’s cock and flicked a switch at the top. It began to vibrate and squeeze Rusty’s big fake dick. Rusty moaned. One rather thick looking horse dildo that resembled Clint’s was fed into Rusty’s anus. It whirred to life and Rusty gasped. Throat whirring, lube spilling down his mouth, he felt inch after glorious inch get sucked into his asshole smoothly. He felt so full, so well-used. The final dildo easily slid into his mouth where his throat started to whir and undulate.<br />
<br />
Rusty lay on the table quivering as all his holes were used, and then the man pressed the button at the base of his groin that turned his cock on and pleasure washed through him. He struggled to keep his mind focused but it was so easy to fall into sex doll thoughts, the whirring of his throat and ass giving a pleasurable hum that lulled his thoughts into submission.<br />
<br />
“You’ve still got two hours left until the end of your shift.” Sam grinned. “I think you’ll be much more pliable by then.”<br />
<br />
Sam mouthed a word under his breath and Rusty saw a placard appear at his base. Words etched themselves into the brass. Randy Raw-dog and his Big Red Bone. With all those dildos crammed in his holes and his huge cock juddering, Rusty had to admit he did look like he was being fucked silly and enjoying every second, especially with that expression on his face. <br />
<br />
Randy-no, Rusty shook the thought away. He wasn’t some horny fucktoy!<br />
<br />
But, well, he was horny. And his huge cock was a fucktoy. Rusty tried to ignore the constant pleasure that was assaulting him, watch the man, keep himself aware. But the man saw him looking and wandered back over.<br />
<br />
“Sorry, forgot to add the final touches.” The man held up ear muffs and a blindfold. “No distractions.”<br />
<br />
Rusty wriggled but couldn’t stop his sense from being blocked. He lay there in the dark, only the whir and thrum of his orifices and the constant pleasure and fullness to keep him company. He tried to hold on to his thoughts, but he was so…so randy and the pleasure wouldn’t stop.<br />
<br />
Rundy felt himself slip away for a moment, then another, so hard to keep track of his mind. Under the blindfold, his tormented expression slackened. Ten minutes passed, then thirty, and then when Randy resurfaced from the pleasure he felt happy and his face twisted into a dopey smile around the dildo in his mouth. A throb, a squeeze, a whir, and his mind was pulled away in the thrum of pleasure, enjoying being put to good use.<br />
<br />
He resurfaced one last time an hour later. Randy’s face pulled itself into a rather dumb, love-struck expression, accepting his place as a fuck toy. And then he didn’t think anything at all, mind lost to the thrum and whir and suck and squeeze. <br />
<br />
Fuck toys didn’t need to think, after all.</p>
