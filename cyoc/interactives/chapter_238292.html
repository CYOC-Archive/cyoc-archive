<br />
“No, assassin, it is you that are outmatched.” <br />
Hinata stated.<br />
<br />
Hinata began to glow and they all prepared to fight. Once again Hinata displayed her amazing speed. In an instant she was right in front of them. Abolith went to strike her, but as soon as she appeared she was gone. Then she appeared behind Anjelica, the vixen struck but Mason was faster and blocked the attack, receiving a stab wound to the chest and his arm being cut off. Hinata jumped back and shot foxfire at the group, scattering them.<br />
<br />
“Mason no!” The teen witch cried.<br />
<br />
“Don’t worry.” The hybrid spoke.<br />
<br />
“Mason?” She asked.<br />
<br />
“No, it is Fenrir speaking, we are fine. Until Ragnarok I cannot die. But we must separate for now.” He explained and the two separated in a flash of blue light.<br />
<br />
“Oh thank goodness!” Anjelica squeezed Mason tight, her eyes pouring tears.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile Kari and Haley engaged Hinata. The green tigress delivered heavy attacks and blows putting the eight-tails off balance for the black vixen to make precise strikes.<br />
<br />
“Why do you fight for Fukushu? He’s only using you, he doesn’t care for your safety. If he did he wouldn’t have sent you to your deaths.” Hinata explained.<br />
<br />
“Piss off! Mind games won’t work on us!” Haley roared and slammed her hammer down.<br />
<br />
“You children aren’t ready for war.” Hinata said.<br />
<br />
“We won’t back down. We know what we’re fighting for! We choose to be here! We’re ready for this!” Kari replied.<br />
<br />
“No, one rarely is.” The kitsune woman said quietly.<br />
<br />
Hinata stood still. The two siblings were confused but decided to attack. The second Kari’s sword reached the black kitsune, she counter attacked and before either of them could defend. The two girls laid on the ground fighting unconsciousness.<br />
<br />
“I will not kill innocent children trying to impress a monster. Tell Fukushu-san to send real warriors…not his naive nieces…family are too precious to lose.” Hinata spoke almost softly.<br />
<br />
“Leave them alone!” Stephanie shouted as she flew straight into Hinata.<br />
<br />
The armored woman flew the kitsune into the air before attaching cluster rockets to her chest, sending her soaring into the ground. Once Hinata slammed into the earth Stephanie launched all of her artillery into the crater Hinata’s body had formed. She landed feet from her target and produced two light construct blades from her wrists. As the black haired woman predicted; Hinata lunged out of the crater but was now in firing range of two auto cannons Stephanie had set up prior to their engagement. Without her sword, Hinata found herself unable defend against the cannon fire and was blasted back.<br />
<br />
“Ha! How do you like my tech?!” Stephanie smirked beneath her helmet.<br />
<br />
An explosion of foxfire blasted away the cannons and Hinata lept into the air. Stephanie took flight immediately and flew at the kitsune. When the two met the black vixen caught the armored woman’s arms and crushed the gauntlets, destroying the energy emitters for the blades. She kicked the woman and directed her landing towards her sword. But before she could reach her weapon Mason took it. However just as soon as he touched it his body began to seize and he fell unconscious. Hinata walked over to the teen and retrieved Moonslayer.<br />
<br />
“Only those with the will of the gods can wield my blade.” Hinata explained.<br />
<br />
During the battle Hinata had infused her chi into the blade and by extension her will. Only someone of equal or greater strength could wield her sword. Mason was strong but not strong enough yet. Hinata holstered her katana and turned.<br />
<br />
Just as she did Abolith was right behind her, the elf now moved with speed and stealth the kitsune didn’t know was possible. Before she could react, Abolith had unholstered her scimitar and had slashed the vixen’s shoulder to her neck. The next strike was interrupted by an explosion of foxfire that kept the assassin back. Once she had some distance, Hinata unsheathed her sword once again and the two clashed. Hinata could tell this sword was stronger than the daggers she’d been using, this one would not easily yield to Moonslayer. The woman herself fought differently than before, more precise and vicious. Hinata couldn’t believe this was the same elf she had been throwing around earlier.<br />
<br />
This time Ablolith was able to strike the vixen, the two appeared to be practically evenly matched. The assassin deflected another attack but instead of a follow-up she jumped away and threw poisoned daggers forcing Hinata back as well. When the kitsune landed the smell of powder hit her nose instantly and she was engulfed in flames. This distraction was temporary as she simply used her own foxfire to swallow the fire. Once that was done she looked to see Abolith had disappeared.<br />
<br />
“Don’t tell me you’ve left to get your precious nieces and nephew to safety.” Hinata growled.<br />
<br />
Then another impossibly stealthy surprise attack landed Abolith’s scimitar right through the vixen’s shoulder.<br />
<br />
“I’m not some soft, doting aunt. They knew what they were signing up for.” Abolith said coldly as she slowly pulled the blade from her enemy.<br />
<br />
“I see. You didn’t want your kin to see the real you.” Hinata spat.<br />
<br />
Just as the elf predicted: Hinata once again used her kitsune fire magic to push her attacker back. Abolith landed on Stephanie’s unconscious form and stabbed the suit’s supply of distilled Yggdrasil water, coating Hinata in the substance, ensuring she could not explode into foxfire for a while. Now Abolith was on the offensive, with the foxfire taken care of for now she could maintain close proximity to Hinata. Then Abolith kicked Hinata after another deflected attack and threw bombs at the vixen’s paws, blasting her into a windmill. Ablolith entered through the hole and instantly knew Hinata was above her, she dodged the downward thrust from Moonslayer and wall-ran up the stone walls. Hinata follows and the two exchanged attacks as they circled up the windmill’s interior. Once they had reached the top Hinata suddenly dropped and slashed the air either her sword, an arc of energy cut through the whole building and sliced off the top half of the windmill with Abolith in it. The kitsune jumped in the air out of the tower and kicked herself off of a chunk of flying debris and landed in the nearby river. Washing away the Yggdrasil substance from her. She looked for the elf’s next attack but like before she had seemingly disappeared. Hinata’s ear twitched as she heard throwing knives flying towards her direction. The eight-tailed kitsune knew this tactic, it was textbook misdirection, a trick used by shinobi. Hinata let the daggers land in her flesh as she blocked the incoming surprise attack from the opposite direction.<br />
<br />
“Does Fukushu-sama know you fight like this? Poison, bombs, sneak attacks, backstabs. I doubt he approves of such…dishonorable tactics.” Hinata said as she pushed Abolith back and pulled the knives from her flesh.<br />
<br />
“He knows I do what must be done. I am no samurai, I care little for honor.” Abolith spat.<br />
<br />
Now Hinata understood, Abolith didn’t want Kari, Haley, and Mason to see this side of her: the ruthless and cruel assassin who fought without mercy. A cold blooded killer.<br />
<br />
“This has been enlightening. But my attention is needed elsewhere.” Hinata stated.<br />
<br />
“We’re not done here!” Abolith yelled as she prepared another attack.<br />
<br />
“I know. But I am. I do not wish to kill you Abolith-san. Your husband would only seek revenge, encoring the further wrath of your family is not my intention.” Hinata said.<br />
<br />
“Then why fight us? Why challenge Lord Shizen?.” Abolith replied angrily.<br />
<br />
“I have no choice. This is the only path I can follow. You could never understand, there is nothing left in this world for me to fight for. Ryoma-sama and the Tentai no chitsujo believe me to be the rightful ruler of my people. Who am I to deny them that?” Hinata explained, refusing to attack.<br />
<br />
Abolith moved to attack, believing nothing Hinata said. Hinata dodged and counter attacked. Hinata was once again in the defensive. She noticed Abolith slowly directing their fight into the forest, where the elf would be at a greater advantage. She shot out blasts of foxfire to create some distance and sliced behind her, all at once the trees of the forest were cut and they all fell, crashing into each other.<br />
<br />
Hinata then steadied herself and held her katana parallel to her body. Just as she was about to swing her sword another sword blocked it. It was Mason, he was back in his human form but his strength seemed to hold out against Hinata’s power. However he wasn’t focused on his surroundings and Hinata kicked his leg out from under him and prepared to strike. Abolith jumped at the him and tackled him away from the kitsune.<br />
<br />
“What are you doing?!” Abolith hissed.<br />
<br />
Mason was confused by his Aunt’s words and the tone of her voice.<br />
<br />
“I-I’m helping you!” He replied.<br />
<br />
“No. Stay down, let me handle this.” She whispered trying to compose herself.<br />
<br />
She got up and prepared her stance to fight, Mason did the same but was blindsided by Abolith. She kicked him away and onto the ground when he tried to get back up he noticed several needles sticking out of his chest. He then fell unconscious.<br />
<br />
“I told you to stay down.” Abolith said coldly.<br />
<br />
The substance on the needles were not dangerous, they would only help him knocked out. She couldn’t let him get hurt, she couldn’t let him see her like this. She turned her attention back to Hinata but she was nowhere to be seen. Abolith cursed to herself and sprinted out of the destroyed forest in pursuit of Hinata.</p>
