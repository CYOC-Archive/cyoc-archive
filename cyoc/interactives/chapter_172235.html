<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Alice exercised on her treadmill, but it felt like it was no use.  She just got tired so quickly!  Frustrated, she kicked the frame of the device, which only hurt her foot.  &quot;Damn it all!  I wish this stupid treadmill was at the North Pole!&quot;<br />
<br />
With a soft *bamf* noise, the treadmill vanished, only to mysteriously appear on an ancient glacier.  &quot;What...what?!  How...&quot;  Alice couldn&#39;t believe her eyes.  The treadmill had vanished!<br />
<br />
She laughed bitterly.  &quot;Of all the wishes I&#39;d ever wanted, THIS is the one that gets granted?  Damn it all!  I could have wished for anything!  Like, I wish my foot didn&#39;t hurt anymore!&quot;<br />
<br />
And just like that, the pain was gone.  Suddenly feeling paranoid, she looked around the room.  But no, she was alone.  &quot;Ok...either I&#39;m going crazy, or this is Have Your Wishes Granted Day.&quot;  She resolved to make a GOOD wish, in case whatever was happening had a time and/or wish limit.  &quot;Ok, I wish I had the body I did back in High School!&quot;<br />
<br />
A warm feeling spread throughout her body, and she felt energy returning to her limbs as her flab seemed to melt away.  She shed her years rapidly, wrinkles and crow&#39;s feet vanishing as her skin became soft and youthful once more.  Her clothing became baggy and loose on her dwindling frame, and her vision sharpened.  Her shorts slid off of her thighs, and her panties followed suit.   Her shirt now hung on her like a dress, and she gasped, her voice sounding higher and clearer.  She rushed to the nearest mirror, and was shocked at what she saw.<br />
<br />
She&#39;d intended to return to the glory of her teenaged years, back when she was Prom Queen.  But instead, the wish had been interpreted in a different way- she was once again a fourteen year-old Freshman girl!  Still, she couldn&#39;t deny this was a vast improvement- her nose was smaller, and she looked very cute.  &quot;Oh My God, this is amazing!&quot;<br />
<br />
She laughed, then giggled, at how ridiculous she looked, and she shucked off her shirt and the now-useless bra (intended for the sagging, large breasts of an overweight old woman, as opposed to the 34 A she now possessed).  Now naked, she marveled at the reflection in the mirror, even as she cupped her small breasts in her hands.<br />
<br />
Her nipples instantly hardened, and she made a soft purring sound at how good this felt.  But as much as she enjoyed being a teen again, she was much too young!  She couldn&#39;t drive, and nobody would believe that she was really Alice Cross.  There was a soft thump of something hitting the carpet, and looking down, she saw her wedding ring.  The gold ring she&#39;d found in the garden, on the other hand (no pun intended) still fit snugly.<br />
<br />
She reached down to pick up the ring, but paused.  That ring belonged to Bill&#39;s wife.  But she now had another chance at life.  She decided to leave it where it was.  &quot;I don&#39;t want to be the wife of Bill Cross.  I&#39;m Alice North.  Hell, at this age, I haven&#39;t even met Bill yet!&quot;<br />
<br />
She decided that this would be the first day of her new life.  &quot;I wish I was wearing clothes a 14 year old girl would wear.&quot;  Once again, since she didn&#39;t specify, she found herself wearing white denim cut-off jeans, and a burgundy sleeveless blouse, along with a pair of white tennis shoes, and pink ankle socks.  &quot;My, kids wear a lot less these days.&quot;  She laughed again as she modeled for herself in the mirror.  &quot;But who cares, I look great!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I wish I had a bank account, in the name of Alice North, that has 40 million dollars in it, along with a debit card.&quot;  With a tiny flash of light, a plastic card appeared in her hand.  She&#39;d chosen 40 million because that&#39;s what last night&#39;s lottery had been worth.  Now a young millionaire, she headed out by the back door, and climbed over the back fence.  When she&#39;d been younger, she&#39;d been a real tomboy, limber and agile, able to climb like a cat.<br />
<br />
It felt great to be able to do that again!  Of course, being 14 again meant she couldn&#39;t drive, and she would need a place to live, but for now, she made her way to the bus stop.  About halfway there, she remembered that it was 11 in the morning on a Tuesday.  She frowned.  &#39;Darn it, any adult who sees me is going to wonder why I&#39;m not in school.&#39;<br />
<br />
&quot;I wish it was Saturday!&quot;  She blurted out.  For a brief instant, the entire universe seemed to go dark, then it returned.   Where it had been sunny and warm, now it was cold and raining.  &quot;Oh what the hell!?&quot;<br />
<br />
The sky was overcast and gloomy, and it was definitely later in the day.  It occured to her that she hadn&#39;t specified THIS Saturday, so she had no idea what the date or time was!   &#39;I need to be more careful with these wishes!&#39;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ahem, I wish that it was Saturday, May 5th, 2019, at 11:15 A.M.&quot;  She recalled that the bus was scheduled to arrive next at 11:30.<br />
<br />
Again, reality blinked out, and when it returned, it was a nice Spring morning.  She was still soaked, though.  &#39;Oh well, you can&#39;t win them all.&#39; She thought, as she made her way to the bus stop.  As the bus pulled up, she realized she didn&#39;t have any bus tokens or cash on her.  Doh!  &quot;I wish I had a cute little designer purse, in a nice pink color, and whenever I reach into it, I&#39;ll find exactly what I want.&quot;<br />
<br />
There, now THAT was a smart wish!  The purse appeared on her arm, and it did, indeed, look cute and nicely pink in color.  She reached into it and produced bus fare, allowing her to board without incident.  The driver smiled at her, and she smiled back.  It felt great to be beautiful again!<br />
<br />
She took the bus to the train station, and headed into the city.  She wanted to make a day of it, and maybe see how young people spent their days.  On the train, she noticed everyone was glued to looking at their cell phones- she&#39;d never owned one, but now she wanted one.  She reached into her purse, and took out a slender little phone, the same pink color as her purse.  It purported to be a Samsung Galaxy Note 5.  Of course, she&#39;d never used a cell phone before, and she had a little trouble with it.  &quot;I wish I was a genius so I could figure this out&quot;, she grumbled.<br />
<br />
Suddenly she felt her thoughts seemed sharper, and clearer.  New ideas popped into her head, and she quickly fiddled with the phone&#39;s settings so it would do whatever she needed it to.  By the time she reached the station, she had her day planned out.<br />
<br />
She visited the Natural History Museum first- she&#39;d always loved it as a child, but she hadn&#39;t been there in decades.  While there, she watched every teen girl closely, curious about their fashion and interests.  She saw a pair of girls a little older than herself (well, physically, at least).  They were walking together, and holding hands, seeming to be having a great time.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, how wonderful.  They must be good friends.  I wish I was that happy!&quot;  As nothing immediately changed, Alice didn&#39;t notice she&#39;d made another careless wish.  A few moments later, she saw the girls looking at an exhibit, and the two of them shared a kiss.<br />
<br />
&#39;Oh my!  Girls didn&#39;t do that in public when I was young.&#39;  Alice blushed, but at the same time, she couldn&#39;t help but be happy for the girls.  More than happy.  She swore she could hear her own heartbeat, and, watching the girls, she felt something she hadn&#39;t in a long time.<br />
<br />
Alice tore her gaze away from the girls and fled the area, not stopping until she was alone in a quiet corner of the museum.<br />
<br />
&#39;What was that?&#39;  She gasped for breath.  &#39;Was I...did that...turn me on?&#39;<br />
<br />
And it did.  She couldn&#39;t deny it, she was incredibly aroused.  She tried to focus on the good times she&#39;d had with boys in the past.  And Bill, back when they were in love. <br />
<br />
Nothing.  It was as if all that had happened to another person.  Not her.<br />
<br />
She must have wished for something, without even thinking about it, and now, despite having been straight all her life...now she was a lesbian.  She thought about wishing it away.  Going back to the way she was.  But...thinking back to those two girls.  Watching them had felt good.  Imagining herself kissing a girl like that.  Being kissed.<br />
<br />
She wanted that.  She wanted that bad.  Sure, she could go back to the way she was.  But why would she want to?<br />
<br />
Having gathered her thoughts, she thought about what to do next.</p>
