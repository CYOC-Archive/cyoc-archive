<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">David shrugged their upper body&#39;s shoulders, though there was a slight lift of their front from just above their mustang front legs as well.  &quot;Honestly,&quot; David considered.  &quot;It&#39;s not explicitly <i>bad</i>.  I guess, just... zip me up?&quot;  Alex glanced up at David as they looked back at him.  &quot;It&#39;s fine.  I mean.  It&#39;s probably too early to tell...&quot; said the new centaur.  &quot;I&#39;ll give it some time,&quot; they offered.<br />
<br />
Alex nodded, zipping David up.  &quot;This is so cool,&quot; Alex smiled.  &quot;You are taking up a lot of space... but maybe we should figure out how much of the rest of the world we&#39;ve messed with,&quot; he offered as a thought.<br />
<br />
David was nodding as they opened up the photo application on their phone.  &quot;Well... two Easters ago, it looks like I was human,&quot; they say, holding their phone where Alex can see it.  The centaur had to kind of reach down to give him a good look.  A moment later, David was moving to the couch to lay down on it... though doing so meant they took up the whole couch.  &quot;Is this better?&quot; the asked, holding the phone up from where they laid.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ve absolutely ruined my couch,&quot; Alex grumbled as David showed them the photos.  &quot;OK, so.  That means a lot of life is like it was supposed to be up until that part.  Maybe you got cursed, or there was a magic awakening or something?&quot; he wondered, sitting down with his back to the couch.  His breasts shook against his chest as he put one hand on the phone.  &quot;Oh, hey... I&#39;ve got pictures from LARP and birthdays,&quot; he realized.  Pulling up his own phone, they were able to see a number of photos that had David as a centaur and also not.<br />
<br />
&quot;So... sometime in the last three months... between Hero&#39;s birthday and Shaniqua&#39;s,&quot; David figured, rubbing their chin... the heat in their loins cooling down.  &quot;Wait.  What about that trip we took?  The white water rafting trip?&quot;  They watched over Alex&#39;s shoulders as they swiped through their photos.  Sure enough, there was pictures from before they departed where David was human... and then phots at the end where they looked embarrassed about being a female horse at the lower half.<br />
<br />
Alex frowned.  &quot;Seems like that would be a bigger news story.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It was,&quot; David agrees, showing Alex what they had opened up on their phone as a search result.  &quot;&#39;Local Man Altered, New Magic Curse&#39;,&quot; they read off the screen.  &quot;Links out from the WTNS story say that, sometime at the start of this decade, magical artifacts began being discovered around the world... scientists are baffled.  Apparently I&#39;ve recently been released from testing by some facility,&quot; he offered.  &quot;I dunno this is a good thing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just, the next time the phone says &#39;It is strange David is a centaur&#39; just alter it to say &#39;normal&#39; instead,&quot; Alex chuckled.  They moved the back against the couch.  &quot;Man, this is uncomfortable.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;OK, OK.  I get the idea,&quot; David said.  Using the 3D mapping of the TMS app.  They selected the couch and the sentence that appeared was &#39;The sofa is old and well-worn&#39; but David couldn&#39;t think of how to modify that.  They showed the sentence to Alex.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s start with old to new,&quot; he offered.  David did so and was lifted upwards as the couch was suddenly much more plump beneath them.  The next sentence was, &#39;The new couch was not designed with centaurs in mind,&#39; but before Alex could say anything, David altered the sentence by deleting the word not.  &quot;I didn&#39;t know you could just delete words.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah I found that earlier.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alex blinked.  &quot;Instead of changing one word or deleting a word, can you just add a word?  Like that game with the items you build from words?  Add an adjective or something?&quot;<br />
<br />
David glanced from the phone, to Alex, then back.  &quot;Maybe?&quot; they asked, stretching the word out for a moment.  &quot;I hadn&#39;t thought about that,&quot; the admitted.  &quot;I think I said, the app doesn&#39;t care of your grammar is off.&quot;  And with that, consideration out there, David tapped the Submit button on their changes.<br />
<br />
It was at that point that Alex was pushed a bit forward as the couch got deeper.  David&#39;s legs no longer fell entirely off the side while they laid on their side.  Also, the armrests were much larger now, making it much more comfortable for David to lounge their human torso over the sides of the couch.  Additionally, Alex was able to stand up and sit on the opposite armrest as if it were its own seat because of it&#39;s new width.<br />
<br />
&quot;How&#39;s that?&quot; David asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Much better,&quot; Alex said, leaning back against the back of the couch, laying partly against David&#39;s tail.  &quot;Now... can you give me a penis?&quot;  David looked at him.  &quot;C&#39;mon, dude.  We turned you into a centaur.  You knew I was going to ask.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I randomly got cursed to be a centaur mare in the last few months.  If we make you male, biologically, does that alter your whole life, making you cismale?  Are you cursed too?  Like, what happens?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe it&#39;ll assume that I got surgery as has always been the plan,&quot; Alex offered.  &quot;Or, you could just Check the box that makes the whole world be aware I&#39;ve changed and we could just have no explanation what-so-ever,&quot; he offered for consideration.<br />
<br />
&quot;And when people ask questions?&quot; David wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck&#39;em.  I want to be a guy,&quot; Alex said.  &quot;You&#39;re already super-awesome as you are,&quot; he insisted, leaning forward and turning to face David.  &quot;C&#39;mon, dude.  Penis me!&quot; he grinned.<br />
<br />
David looked down at the phone, selected Alex, and hit Refresh a few times to bring up other sentence options: Alex craves a large penis of his own; the thought of impregnating someone turns Alex on; the apartment seems to small now for his centaur friend; Alex dreams of making good people happy and punishing the wicked.  David blinked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hm,&quot; David said.  <i>These are all 100% true statements written by the application,</i> they realized.  He glanced up at Alex who looked like they were about to ask &quot;What&quot;.  &quot;Oh,&quot; they began.  &quot;Just admiring how the application respects your pronouns,&quot; they said with a shrug.<br />
<br />
&quot;Makes sense,&quot; Alex offered.  &quot;It makes 100% true statements, yeah, but it&#39;s also <i>your</i> application.  If it&#39;s magic, I bet it reads with the bias of the user in mind,&quot; he posited.  &quot;I doubt it&#39;s going to write things in a way which oppose someone&#39;s political or religious views or else the application is forcing judgement.  A proper tool is indifferent to its purpose beyond proper use.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So you think a racist would get racist suggestions?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d bet on it,&quot; Alex nodded.  &quot;Or, more-relevantly, someone who thinks that my nice ass and tits—as Goerge at work keeps pointing out—makes me a woman, would see me instead described with female pronouns,&quot; he explained.  &quot;Truthfully, it actually reflects on <i>you</i> that it&#39;s doing that, but maybe I&#39;m anthropomorphizing an inanimate object?&quot;<br />
<br />
Alex&#39;s green eyes met David&#39;s brown eyes expectedly.  He wanted that penis.  &quot;OK,&quot; David said, finding the perfect sentence.  &quot;Preferences?&quot; they wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, yeah... but its your app and I trust you... so, surprise me,&quot; he said.  &quot;Just make sure <i>I</i> know it&#39;s changed, otherwise we might create a situation where I become a transwoman instead of a transman and wouldn&#39;t that be confusing?&quot; Alex chuckled.<br />
<br />
&quot;OK,&quot; David said, glancing down at the phone screen.  The application&#39;s display read: &quot;The transman is currently the same sex as the centaur before him.&quot;  Staring at the screen, David considered their options before changing one word and hitting Submit.  They really hoped they didn&#39;t screw this up.</p>
