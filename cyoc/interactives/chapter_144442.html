<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mr. Evans was teaching away. Judging by the time, the lecture could not have started more then a few minutes ago, but the blackboard was allredy so cluttered it looked like he hadd been on it for hours on end. <br />
<br />
His thinning dark brown hair was as Emily hadd expected stared balding and his beer gut was infact larger. He hadd an 9 o&#39;clock shadow, sideburns and stress lines on his forhead. He hadd an expretion of almost as mutch boredom as his students. He wore a plain white dress shirt, gray dress pants, unremarkable shoes and he hadd an cheap looking digital watch on his wrist. There were clear sweat stains under his armpits and his fly was open. <br />
<br />
He turned away from the blackboard for a moment to address the class that was when Emily took the picture.<br />
<br />
Mr. Evans hadd now turned into a very busty, voluptuous woman with a slim waist, killer legs and a larg jussy butt. Even tho she was the same age as before it were obvious that she was aging far bether then what Mr. Evans ever did. The stress lines were gone from his forhead, however there were now some smile lines under her eyes and around her mouth. Alltho one could barely see it, do to her makeup. Nevertheless there were still deffently som sort of family resemblance between this woman and Mr. Evans. She look like his very very good looking sister.<br />
<br />
She had shoulder length wavy dark brown hair that was tied back in a ponytail. She had a designer purse on her shoulder. She was wearing a white sleeveless button down blouse. The uper buttons were unbuttoned, revealing an expensive looking necklace resting on her massive cleavage. The blouse were tucked into a grey pencil skirt. And she had on high heel sandals, so you could see her pedicure which matches her manicure. She also had a  bracelet that matched her earrings as well as the aforementioned necklace. She also wore a few rings, one of which Emily recognised as the one the cop turnd shoplifter hadd tried to steal earlier today, alltho judging by &quot;Mr&quot; Evans new appearance, clothes and other accessories it was a pretty save bet that she had either bought or received the ring as a gift. <br />
<br />
And sure enuff, the woman started talking as if nothing hadd happend. She said somthing in the lines of &quot;Sorry guys and gals, but as I allways say better late than ugly.&quot; befor gigeling at her owne joke and continued telling a the class that she was late due to an &quot;old hag&quot; as she uncharitable put it. And that this &quot;old hag&quot; hadd stolen the new ring her husband Noah was about to buy for her. <br />
<br />
Emily now noticed that the blackboard were now complete clean as well as the new &quot;mr&quot; Evens very feminine mannerism and hand gestures. <br />
<br />
As Emily watched in amzement she felt a quik tap on her shulder. It was Rick. Rick then said &quot;Emily I really don&#39;t want to know who or what Ms. Kingsley used to be. Okay.&quot;<br />
<br />
Emily shot him a confused look and ask &quot;Why?&quot; Rick then looked very embarrassed. Emily then realised that &quot;Ms. Kingsley&quot; most have been the subject of some of Rick&#39;s sexual fantasys. <br />
<br />
&quot;You have a crush on her, don&#39;t you?&quot; Emily ask.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well yeah, but so have every other guy who take her class.&quot; Awnserd Rick in an clearly embarrassed tone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well let&#39;s just say the camera clearly still work.&quot; Emily then tok the picture of the &quot;new&quot; Ms. Kingsley out of the camera and handed it to Rick. &quot; Her you go, some wank material for you to enjoy tonight&quot; She said mokingly wile giving him a playfull wink.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ha Ha very funny Emily.&quot;<br />
<br />
Emily glanset back into the class room. Ms. Kingsley was still talking. Even tho she had allready come late for her class. Emily lisend to what she was talking about. And it now seemed as if she was blabbering about an completely unrelated story from when she had worked as a stewardess.<br />
<br />
This was truly fascinating. When she hadd used the camera on the people at the mall, they hadd just been randome strangers. This however was diffrent. This was someone she used to know. Well sort of. She hadd probably learnd more about Ms. Kingsley personal life from overhearing this parts of this stewardess story, then she ever did about Mr. Evans in the tree years he was her teatcher.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you hear this Rick?&quot; She askd in almoust disbelief <br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean?&quot; Rick ask confused.<br />
<br />
Emily just pointing at the door. And say &quot;Do you hear what she is talking about?&quot;<br />
<br />
Still confused Rick awnser &quot;What? She is just telling the story about the time when she almost delayed a flight. I mean I most have heard she tell that story about a hundred times...&quot; <br />
<br />
Then it went up for him&quot;..But you have not, have you. Let me get this straight Emily. You don&#39;t remember any of Ms. Kingsleys stewardess storys? Do you remember her beauty pageant storys or the story about how she become prom queen?&quot;  <br />
<br />
&quot;Nope&quot; Emily awnserd.<br />
 <br />
&quot;Do you remember: It&#39;s all natural boys&quot;  Rick said clearly imitating Ms. Kingsley while motioning to his chest and butt.<br />
<br />
Emily just shaked her head. Not getting the in-joke.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you remember anything about Sandra Kingsley? Or Sophie? Do you remember her? Do you remember Sophie Kingsley?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No I don&#39;t, should I?&quot; Emily said with a hint of unease in her voice.<br />
  <br />
&quot;well you have been babysitting <br />
Sophie since she was five years old and now she is almost nine. Not to mention that you often refer to her as the littel sister you never hadd. So yes you should.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I have what?&quot;</p>
