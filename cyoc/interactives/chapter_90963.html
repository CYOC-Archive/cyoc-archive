<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The baby&#39;s squalling woke Ty from a deep slumber. She blinked in the darkness, then rolled her head to check the clock radio across the room.<br />
<br />
4:12 a.m.<br />
<br />
Ty stretched her arms and legs slowly, then rubbed her hands down her face. Her sixteenth birthday. Happy Birthday To Me, she thought.<br />
She sure didn&#39;t feel like sexy sweet sixteen, with her baby weight and her unsexy flannel pajamas. She groaned slightly under her breath, and started to sit up.<br />
<br />
She felt a hand on her shoulder, pressing her back down.<br />
&quot;I got this one,&quot; Dustin murmured in his foster sister&#39;s ear.<br />
<br />
Dustin crossed to the small console fridge they&#39;d put in the room they now shared. Mark and June had paid a contractor to take the wall out between the two bedrooms, and Dustin had saved his wages from his after-school job to buy a queen sized bed.<br />
Inside the fridge, Ty and Dustin had stored several small bottles of Ty&#39;s breast milk. Ty used a breast pump so their baby girl always had mommy&#39;s milk, even when Ty was at school.<br />
The baby slept in a bassinet by the foot of her parents&#39; bed.<br />
Ty watched Dustin by the feeble pre-dawn light, holding baby Jenna in one arm and feeding her. She couldn&#39;t see his face, but she imagined him smiling while he rocked Jenna gently, singing in her ear.<br />
Ty couldn&#39;t hear what Dustin was singing right now, but she knew from experience, she was singing &quot;Hey Jude&quot; as a lullaby, replacing the name Jude with Jenna.<br />
<br />
After several minutes&#39; gentle coaxing, Jenna finally fell back to sleep. Dustin laid her carefully back in the bassinet, draped the pink blanket June had made her over her tiny shoulders, then crossed back to bed with Ty.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well,&quot; he said, placing a hand on Ty&#39;s belly where her jammies had ridden up. &quot;That&#39;s one baby girl put back to sleep. Let me get started on the other.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dustin&#39;s hand slid up to his foster sister&#39;s milk-swollen breast and began drawing slow circles around her nipple.<br />
Ty made a sleepy attempt to push Dustin&#39;s hand off her, and failed. &quot;Stop it,&quot; she said. &quot;You don&#39;t have to pretend. I know I&#39;m fat and smell milky and you&#39;re not attracted to me anymore. Let&#39;s get our sleep.&quot;<br />
Dustin leaned in so close to Ty&#39;s face that she could feel his breath on her lips.<br />
&quot;All that baby weight, Tyler Michelle Foster, you and I made that together. If you&#39;re fat, I&#39;m fat. I love you, Ty. You and I made life together. And I want to celebrate that with you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dustin kissed Ty firmly on the mouth, and after a moment, Ty kissed back. Dustin&#39;s hands danced slowly over his foster sister&#39;s body. After a moment, he slowly climbed aboard her.<br />
He unbuttoned her pajama top and spread it open. She lifted her hips so he could slide the bottoms and panties off her. As they kept kissing, he slipped slowly inside her.<br />
<br />
Ty&#39;s powers came back the minute Jenna emerged from her body. She felt her powers return, like air rushing into a vacuum when a hole opens in the surface. She could&#39;ve changed anything.<br />
Anything.<br />
She could&#39;ve turned back into a boy. She could&#39;ve made herself an adult, and walked away, and left Dustin to raise this baby. This baby he still didn&#39;t realize was conceived magically, without him.<br />
But she couldn&#39;t bring herself to do that. As the baby grew inside her, she fell in love with it. She also fell in love with her former bullying brother, who turned into a real gentleman when he had something to care for.<br />
Simply put, Ty liked being a girl. She liked being a mother. And she liked being her foster brother&#39;s common law wife.<br />
<br />
She&#39;d used her powers, certainly. She&#39;d magically calmed the crying baby more than once. She&#39;d magically stopped fights with Dustin, or between Mark and June.<br />
One time, when she&#39;d been home alone with the baby, she&#39;d magically given Jenna the power to speak English, so they could communicate about the baby&#39;s frustrations.<br />
<br />
She hadn&#39;t used her powers to make the legal troubles go away, though.<br />
Since she&#39;d been one month pregnant on her fifteenth birthday, that means she and Dustin had conceived the baby when she was only fourteen. Sixteen was the age of consent.<br />
The courts had decided that, since Dustin was also a minor, and the age gap was only one year, there was no real crime. They&#39;d wagged a finger at him for that.<br />
Less obvious was the status of Ty&#39;s foster arrangement. Since the state had entrusted Ty to Mark and June, the law was murky on whether Ty and Dustin&#39;s relationship constituted incest.<br />
<br />
Ty didn&#39;t want to admit it aloud, but the accusation that she was engaged in regular incest... well...<br />
It was a real turn-on.<br />
<br />
Dustin wasn&#39;t Ty&#39;s real brother, of course. But legally, it was a different question. And before anyone knew it, all the lawyers got involved.<br />
Once, about a month after Jenna was born, Mark&#39;s lawyer and the state came really close to a no-fault agreement. Ty used her powers to stir things back up again.<br />
She wanted people to think she was flagrantly breaking the rules every time she made love to her brother-husband. The risk of getting caught in incest made her horny.<br />
<br />
Once Ty and Dustin came out with their relationship to Mark and June, they&#39;d made love like newlyweds. Mark and June gave their blessing.<br />
They made love nearly every day, sometimes two or three times a day, for the first seven months. Their grades in school slipped behind the time they spent having sex.<br />
About a month before birth, sex became too awkward and uncomfortable for Ty. Dustin had sulked at first, but he understood.<br />
Then, when Jenna was around six weeks old, Ty realized, she was ready. She&#39;d regained most of the spring in her labia, and the feel of Jenna sucking Ty&#39;s nipples was indescribably sensual.<br />
She&#39;d asked Dustin if he was ready to start work on their second baby. He&#39;d grinned. Ever since, it was like a whole second honeymoon.<br />
<br />
Ty and Dustin both arched their backs and groaned with exquisite pleasure. It pleased Ty that they almost always finished at the same time.<br />
<br />
After if was over, they lay spooning, closer than husband and wife, better than brother and sister. Ty nuzzled back into her brother-husband&#39;s muscular teenage form.<br />
His hand lay draped against her belly. He loved touching her belly. She took that hand and raised it up so it cupped her breast. She guided it in stroking and massaging her nipple.<br />
<br />
An idea suddenly crossed Ty&#39;s mind. She&#39;d never revealed her powers to Dustin. But<br />
She might have a good way to use her power to make herself, and her brother-husband, happy.<br />
<br />
Ty turned her head to look at Dustin. &quot;Dustin? Honey?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yeah?&quot;<br />
&quot;Do you trust me?&quot;<br />
&quot;Of course I do. Why do you ask?&quot;<br />
&quot;Because I want to try something. You just have to trust me and do exactly what I say. Will you do that for me?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes I will, baby. You know I love you.&quot;<br />
&quot;Good.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty smiled, pulling her power together for the biggest feat since she&#39;d changed her gender and made herself pregnant.<br />
The room stayed dark, but she felt like blinding light had filled her from the inside out. And she let it fly, transforming...</p>
