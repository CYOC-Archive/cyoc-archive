<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Joseph and Sol continued to fuck until Joseph finally had an idea. He explained his plan to his mate as they kept fucking. He knew it was risky, but he was going to call the police to his house and he and Sol would corrupt them. They smiled devilishly and Joseph slithered to his cum-coated (yet still working) phone. He picked it up and dialed the police, or just 911 because he felt lazy.<br />
<br />
On the other end a voice picked up. &quot;911, what&#39;s your emergency?&quot; Joseph responded, &quot;There&#39;ssss been a weird ssssmell coming from my neighbor&#39;sssss housssse. I would like someone to ssssee what&#39;sss going on.&quot; After a very short discussion with the 911 operator, a dispatch team was sent to check out the house. The police car strolled up against the curb in front of Joseph&#39;s house, and the young officer in the passenger&#39;s seat looked at the house. <br />
<br />
&quot;The house looks normal to me,&quot; he said. The person in the driver&#39;s seat tapped his thumb against the steering wheel as he set the gear into parking. &quot;You&#39;re new to this job, right Thomas? You never know when something is normal until you look inside.&quot; &quot;I suppose that&#39;s true. Wait here, I&#39;ll go ask the person who lives here.&quot; Thomas got out of the car and made his way to the front door. He knocked on it once, and there wasn&#39;t an answer. A small note slid under the door. Thomas picked up the note, noting the parts of it he didn&#39;t touch looked sticky and had a musky smell. It read, &quot;Pleasssse use the backdoor. Frontdoor needsss repairsss.&quot; Thomas squinted his eyes. He didn&#39;t trust it at all, obviously. He sighed and left the note back on the front porch and walked to the backdoor. Obviously he didn&#39;t seem to be doing anything he was allowed to do as a police officer, but eh. As Thomas passed by a window, a strong and musky odor left it. He got an erection and quickly ran away from the window, confused as hell. &quot;The fuck? Why did it smell so good?&quot; He sighed and continued to walk to the back padio.<br />
<br />
After he passed by the window, Sol slipped out and closed the opening behind him, slowly slithering to Thomas&#39; partner&#39;s car. Thomas reached the backdoor and slowly opened it. He was quickly blasted with the aroma of the house, and his erection grew bigger. He tried to ignore it, entering the hot and dark house and closing the door behind him. The house was pretty hot, and he began sweating. He pulled out his phone and turned on the flashlight, looking around the cum-covered rooms. Besides the flashlight, several lights were still working, but didn&#39;t do my do to being covered in semen. The only other lightsource were glowing, bulging sacs that littered all kinds of surfaces. They seemed like the eggs of aliens or something that someone would see in a sci-fi movie. Suddenly, a voice called out to Thomas as he stared at the throbbing sacs. &quot;Enjoying me and my mate&#39;ssssss work, officer?&quot;<br />
<br />
Thomas backed a little, startled. He shined the light in the direction of the voice, Joseph&#39;s long body and massive drooling cock in view for the officer to see. The officer&#39;s erection only grew as he backed away a little more. However, Joseph quickly slithered over and coiled himself around Thomas, trapping him before he could pull out his gun.  &quot;I have to thank you, officer. Coming to my aid when I needed it, you are a true hero.&quot; Thomas didn&#39;t know what to say. &quot;Now that you are here, I must remove your weaknessssss...humanity........it must be replaced by sssomething more...ssssexy...&quot; Thomas squirmed and tried to call out for help, but was silenced when Joseph brought his scaly hand to Thomas&#39; mouth. &quot;Sssssshhhh............thisss will feel good...let me insssside of you...&quot; With that Joseph released his grip and kissed Thomas passionately. The officer squirmed as hard as he could, getting nowhere as the naga invading his mouth slobbered his throat with his cum and forked tongue. Thomas moaned uncontrollably as his cock began to grow, tearing out of his underwear and pants. He began to return the slobbery kiss to Joseph as his tongue became forked and his face slowly pushed out, blue scales covering it. Joseph and Thomas swished their cum in their maws, swallowing it and causing Thomas&#39; blue scales to spread down his neck as his hair falls out and a hood forms around his head. The scales travel down fast over his toning muscles and stomach, to his groin, where his cock grows bigger and bigger, rivaling that of Joseph&#39;s. &quot;Yesssssssssss...let yourssself become ssssexier...&quot; Thomas&#39; legs meld and become the rest of his long body and his cock pumps out load after load of his new naga cum coming from his bulging and throbbing ballsack. The pair tumble into the massive cum-mess on the floor, wrapping themselves together and continuing to fuck.<br />
<br />
As they kiss, Thomas winces as he feels his cock throbbing wildly as something travels through his urethra. He hisses into the kiss, a sack just like the one covering the floors and walls erupting from his bulging dick. He hisses pleasurably as he stares down at the sack. Joseph smiles. &quot;You are now one of ussssss, brother.&quot; The sack slowly opens, a small cum-covered snake with a big dick slithering out onto Thomas&#39; hands. The snake slithered off his hands and onto his cock, slithering back inside of him. Thomas moaned as the snake invaded his urethra again. Joseph hissed happily and left Thomas to his pleasure and he opened the blinds and looked out the window, seeing the police car completely flooded inside with cum. Sol and a new naga were fucking like no tomorrow, cum spewing everywhere inside. Joseph smiled devilishly and looked back at Thomas.<br />
 <br />
This was just the beginning.</p>
