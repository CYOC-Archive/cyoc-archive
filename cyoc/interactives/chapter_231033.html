<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I opened my eyes, feeling the bed beneath me. I looked at my crotch. I still had a penis, so it must have been a dream.<br />
&quot;Hey sleepyhead, you&#39;re going to be late for class,&quot; I heard from behind me. I turned and saw Katie walking into the room, naked and dripping wet from a shower. Her firm breasts bounced as she walked toward me. She climbed onto the bed and straddled my waist, her warm, soft thighs touching my legs. The contact reminded me of the dream, and my penis responded to this. I knew it would go away when she walked back out.<br />
I reached up and pulled her toward me, bringing her into a deep kiss. She smelled amazing, and felt even better. She pushed her hips downward as I pressed upward, and her lips touched my dick. She slowly engulfed it, and once more I wished.<br />
All of a sudden, everything spun out of control.<br />
I&#39;m not sure why I wished I had a vagina, and why I would use it for my first sexual encounter with one. There is nothing I could think of to explain it except some unconscious reason that even I do not understand. Regardless of that, everything turned upside down and I suddenly realised I was straddling my brother, and his penis was lying against my new cunt. I paused in thought for a brief moment, and then remembered his long, thick cock sliding inside of me. I immediately did not care where this cunt came from, only about where Kevin&#39;s cock could go.<br />
I spread my thighs wider and eased the tip of his penis into me. It was a lot wider and stretched me. As his head was firmly wedged in there, I was breathing heavily, trying to control my nerves. It hurt a little bit, but the lust that burned from earlier told me I didn&#39;t care about a little pain.<br />
Slowly I lowered myself more, taking in as much of him as I could, but a little less than half-way. I lifted off his cock, the head just outside my vagina, and pressed back down. I picked up the pace slowly, and the pain slowly gave way to pleasure as I worked more of him into me. At his width, I could only handle half the length of him, but as soon as I could handle more, I was going to get it.<br />
I increased the pace even more, and the pleasure quickly overtook the slight pain and built quickly. I suddenly was shocked with an orgasm, a sensation completely foreign to me but entirely too pleasurable and welcome. It was pure bliss. As it subsided and I regained control, I leaned back, his penis still mostly in me, and put both my hands on his shins behind me to lean on.<br />
&quot;I wish....&quot; I muttered without realising it.<br />
Everything spun out of control again, and I found my hands had pushed down as I started grinding on the cock still in my cunt. What did I do? I opened my eyes, and I saw... Amanda. She was fucking me! Did I turn myself into her? But the pleasure and sensations were wonderful. In my haste I wished again, this time forcing a mind-shattering orgasm out of Amanda/myself, and that felt.... different and pleasant. Suddenly she fell over onto her side as Kevin pulled himself from her... from ME.<br />
I&#39;m so confused. I must have hit my head or something, but these dreams are just too... weird. I have a nagging suspicion that, whatever I&#39;m doing, someone else is feeling. There&#39;s a faint... sensuality... on my neck? What? Did I imagine the words coming from my mouth, or was someone else saying it, thinking it, forcing me to say it, or maybe a bit of everything.<br />
&quot;I wish ..... that.&quot;<br />
Just as I finished the words I saw things spin again, and Kevin&#39;s cock, I thought in the very back of my mind, is lined up perfectly between Amanda&#39;s... my thighs, which parted just the perfect amount. &quot;Someone wishes this,&quot; I thought briefly, before pushing my thoughts aside as Kevin&#39;s long cock rubbed against my wet clit, pushing downward and driving deep inside my... no, her pussy, filling me up and pulling back, then back in again and again. God that felt good!<br />
&quot;this can&#39;t end&quot; I could not tell if that came from within my thoughts or out loud, it doesn&#39;t matter as the sensations were incredible.<br />
All of the sudden everything spun wildly as a strong arm pulled me close from behind, causing Kevin to pull his cock out of my... hers... his mouth was beside my ear and he whispered to her. I wasn&#39;t quite able to make out his words, as the whirl of things flying past me had my head spinning. He was inside me, a cock in my pussy.<br />
&quot;ooooooooaaaaaaaaaahhhh......................&quot; was all I could mange to whisper out in complete pleasure. I could not focus on what was around me, not could I tell if I had a penis or if I was a guy. I was taking it like a woman, and loving every second. Suddenly it got wilder and faster and my pussy quivered, or was it him quaking and filling my pussy full of his cum as my insides quivered with excitement. As I started to breathe normal again the whirlpool seemed to subside and the surroundings formed again.<br />
&quot;that felt nice&quot;, I hear Amanda think.<br />
No! Stop it. STOP!<br />
 The sensation was overwhelming. What felt like eons was no more than a few seconds. For those moments, I experienced more of the pleasures of sex, with another person, with myself, as a different gender, as several genders, and even enjoyed it... all at the same time! This was getting more complicated. Not the physical things I&#39;ve done, the sex has been amazing, but the mental strain.<br />
I decided a beer was needed. Or three. Or twelve.<br />
It took me a moment to recover from that. When I got up, Katie and Amanda were still on the bed. I shook my head. Whatever else was going on, this had been a wild time. I slipped my shorts on, and headed to the door, barely glancing over as I heard the noise of them getting it on.</p>
