<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Sarah walked into the room and nearly tripped over the family dog, Anna. She was a small husky pup who was only adopted a month ago. The dog was looking around almost like she was confused, as she yipped at her paws. Sarah looked up and gasped as she saw her little girl leaning on the family computer. <br />
<br />
&quot;Uh oh.&quot; Greg whispered as he fell onto his but. He looked at his hands and saw they were tiny and fat as  he had clearly become younger. He didn&#39;t even need to look at his crotch to know he had switched genders. He saw Anna&#39;s mother walk over to him with a cross look on her face. Greg wanted to explain himself but all he could say was &quot;Sawah wai-&quot; before she scooped him up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Gracie what are you doing?&quot; She yelled in a concerned tone. &quot;I said no &quot;puter&quot; time without mommy or daddy ok? And why are you naked?&quot; She slightly chuckled as she carried Greg out of the computer room. Greg did his best to try and point at the computer but his new &quot;mother&quot; didn&#39;t notice her child&#39;s desperate gestures.<br />
<br />
Greg looked down and saw the small puppy that was Anna looking at him with a look that would equal panic in a human. Sarah opened a door down the hall and they walked into what looked like a child&#39;s bedroom. There was a pink bed with a child guard rail around it with drapes like a princess&#39;. The walls were light purple and there were dolls and dresses scattered around the room. Colorful letters on the wall spelt &quot;Grace&quot; and Greg sighed.<br />
<br />
He continued to squirm as Sarah placed him on a changing table. Greg just grumpily sat on the table as Sarah happily humid a tune. She pulled a pull-up from beside the table out and wrapped it around Greg&#39;s new female parts. She then placed Greg&#39;s now tiny body back on the ground as she walked to the closet. Greg thought about making a break for the computer but he figured with his tiny legs he wouldn&#39;t be able to do much before Sarah caught him.<br />
<br />
Sarah pulled out a pink dressed and forced it over Greg. She spun him around and greg found himself looking at himself in a mirror. What he saw was a little girl no older than 3 or 4. She had curly brown hair and a face that looked like a softer, younger version of his normal one. The pink dress was a little puffy and had flowers that made him look even girlier than he should otherwise.<br />
<br />
&quot;There we go Gracie, you look so cute little girl!&quot; Sarah said delighted as she played with her &quot;daughter&#39;s&quot; hair.<br />
<br />
Greg just frowned in frustration. He hit random options out of desperation and had accidentally made himself into a little girl. He looked to his left and saw the little husky puppy which he knew was Anna. The dog looked like it wanted to bite him and Greg understood why. Sarah walked out of the room and Greg ran over to make sure she was gone. <br />
<br />
Greg watched her walk down the hall, and then close the door to the room with the computer in it. She then walked downstairs as Greg closed the door to his new room. &quot;Gweat.&quot; He groaned under his breath as he sat at the foot of his bed. Anna walked over and started to growl. Greg tried not to laugh at the little puppy as he knew she was pissed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey I&#39;m sowwy Anna, I didn&#39;t mean to make you a doggy. I just hit the puter keys twying to not get found by Sawah.&quot; Greg apologized. <br />
<br />
Anna stopped growling. She understood Greg made a mistake but was still frustrated. She curled up next to Greg as Greg hugged her. <br />
&quot;Don&#39;t wowwy. We just have ta wait till Sawa lets us have puter time and then it&#39;s just about hitting one button.&quot; he reassured her.<br />
<br />
The two cuddled while Sarah prepared lunch. Paul, meanwhile, opened the door to the computer room as he had work he needed to get started on. He sat down at the computer but found something odd instead. It looked like a video game or virtual doll house or something. He could see the entire layout of the house, and there were virtual figures that looked like his family. He could see his wife Sarah in the kitchen and his daughter Grace with the dog in her room.<br />
<br />
He selected his icon and watched in disbelief as stats popped up next to it. The weirdest part was that it wall all accurate. His age, height, weight, relationships, all of it was there and accurate. He couldn&#39;t believe it was in this much detail. &quot;Christ even my dick size is here.&quot; He said shocked. He got annoyed looking at the number four. He figured it must&#39;ve been some program his wife downloaded or something.<br />
<br />
He looked over his shoulder to make sure Sarah wasn&#39;t there and then edited his dick size from 4 to 10. His dick suddenly expanded rapidly as the still soft dick filled his crotch to a noticeable degree. Of course, Paul was still selected as unaware so he had no idea anything had changed. He couldn&#39;t believe his wife put everything in such detail. He double checked everything on his file to make sure it was accurate. Just as it was before everything was perfect. He was a little annoyed that it noted he had started to lose hair but smirked again at the 10 next to his dick size.<br />
<br />
He wondered if he could change anything so he decided to see what would happen if he messed around. He decided he&#39;d rather be 17 then 35 so he changed his number as a little wishful thinking to himself. He laughed as his height shortened slightly. His brown wave hair grew thick again while his clothes morphed into a sweatshirt and jeans. His 5 o&#39;clock shadow vanished as he laughed. He couldn&#39;t believe his mom would use a program like this.<br />
<br />
&quot;Man, Mom usually can&#39;t do anything computer related... maybe dad had something to do with it?&quot; Paul wondered as he looked around the program. He looked around trying to see all the other stats. He checked on his little sister Gracie&#39;s and it all looked completely accurate. He wondered if he should change the stats to see if it did anything but he didn&#39;t want to ruin anything if his dad was working on something. <br />
<br />
He selected their dog Anna&#39;s stats and decided if he should change any of them then he should change her&#39;s. He decided he&#39;d try a big change to make sure it really worked so he selected species and hit human. Meanwhile, inside Greg&#39;s room, Anna started to change. Greg dropped her in shock as her fur vanished and her body grew. Her snout went in as her teeth shifted back while golden hair sprouted from her head. A purple dress folded around her newly grown arms and she gasped in surprise.<br />
<br />
&quot;Greg? Greg what happened? I&#39;m a perthon again!&quot; Anna happily shrieked.<br />
<br />
Greg laughed as he hugged Anna tightly. Around them, the room shifted again as a second bed appeared and letters on the wall now read &quot;Grace and Anna.&quot; More toys appeared as reality set again. Back in the computer room, the teenage Paul sat stumped. He didn&#39;t know why his dad or his mom would make such a program.<br />
<br />
He looked around and saw everyone in the house. His mother, his little twin sisters, and himself. He sighed as he tapped on the mouse confused. &quot;Man, I fell like I&#39;ve been staring at this thing for a while. But... didn&#39;t I just find it?&quot; Paul thought confused. He was unaware, which meant every time he made changes the program had to adjust his memory. It was slowly becoming harder and harder for the program to logically explain it. <br />
<br />
Paul sighed as he tapped on the keyboard. He was struggling to remember when he accidentally deleted the 1 from 17 in his age. His body rapidly shrank as his clothes adjusted again. His face softened as a cars shirt appeared. The seven year old Paul looked at the computer and laughed at the video game he found. He was about to select something when the door opened.<br />
<br />
&quot;Paulie? What are you doing on the computer?&quot; Sarah asked angrily. <br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry mommy.&quot; Paul sadly apologized.<br />
<br />
&quot;First Gracie and now you.&quot; She sighed. &quot;What am I gonna do with you kids.&quot; She somewhat chuckled. Paul hopped up and walked out of the room. Sarah glanced at the computer for a second and was about to check it out when she decided against it. She laughed and shut the door. <br />
<br />
Greg and Anna had been talking for some time now about what they could do. They had decided they would ask Sarah tomorrow, and just as they finished Sarah opened their door. &quot;Gracie, Anna, it&#39;s lunch time kids!&quot; Sarah happily announced before walking back downstairs. The &quot;twins&quot; looked at each other and nodded. They had dinner with their family, realizing someone must have messed with the program with the younger Paul. They had their food and shuffled off to their rooms, hoping to get their chance.</p>
