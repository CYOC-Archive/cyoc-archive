<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Samantha stared in shock at the man standing outside the door. He had a head of black hair, looked cleanly shaven, and wore semi-formal clothing. The musk of cologne filled her nose as his gaze swept up and down her body with attractive brown eyes. He was handsome for sure but that wasn’t what Samantha was focused on. Her parents greeted him as Brian and an air of familiarity was established. Clearly Samantha had been dating Brian for some time and though she had no memory of who he was she did recognize him and her crotch tingled with pleasure as she recalled it.<br />
<br />
When Renee had shrunken down and made her pregnant she had wilted away and got smaller and smaller until she felt an orgasm in reverse with a man thrusting in and out of her. Brian’s face matched that man’s meaning she was face to face with the guy containing the sperm that had once made up Renee and she had a sneaking suspicion that the date that night or a date sometime in the future would end with Samantha being on the receiving end of a dick and getting impregnated.<br />
<br />
Samantha just stood there in shock while Brian talked to her parents and she was so lost in this shock that she didn’t even react when Brian put a hand around her waist and led her out the door while talking about a restaraunt. She didn’t retain any of it and sat down in his car still baffled at what was facing her. She didn’t want to go on a date with a guy, she had been a girl for a full day and yet now she felt like she was expected to have sex and get pregnent on that exact same day. It was overwhelming and combined with the whole experience of being on the female side of a date really messed with her head. She only snapped out of her trance when Brian started speaking.<br />
<br />
“You look lovely tonight,” he smiled and Samantha both felt attracted to his clean white teeth and repulsed by them. Her body was no longer directing her and she felt like she was in charge, that choices she made would affect her reality. She ended up blushing very hard in embarrassment and flattery. Brian drove along while movie soundtracks played through the AUX cord. It was the perfect kind of music for Samantha and it relieved some of the tenseness from her shoulders. They drove until they reached a nice restaraunt and Brian parked. They walked into the doors and got in line. Samantha was suddenly feeling very self conscious. She was getting looks from guys and felt really exposed. She squealed in fear when Brian’s hands fell on her shoulders and began to massage them.<br />
<br />
“It’s not that fancy, don’t be nervous,” he requested and Samantha felt her shoulders relax, mostly from the massage. It felt really nice and she felt waves of calmness pour through her, clearing her mind. She liked his touch, no she loved his touch. That was her thinking too and not just her body making changes. Samantha could recall massaging Renee’s shoulders sometimes and being on the receiving end just made her mind to blank and get lost in Brian’s touch. He let go however when telling the lady at the till about their reservation and Samantha blushed hard upon realizing what had just happened. She followed Brian to a table and sat down across from him and had menus put before her. The waitress told them about the specials that night and asked if they wanted anything to drink. A million thoughts raced through Samantha’s head but she eventually just managed to push out a simple, “Water.”<br />
<br />
“No chocolate milk?” Brian asked with a laugh and Sam felt a blush run through her again as she realized she must have ordered that a lot.<br />
<br />
“And that too,” she added in a barely audible whisper. Brian ordered the exact same thing and the waitress left. Samantha then opened the menu and stared at it with no idea as to what anything was, or at least at first. Her baking skills kicked in and the longer she’s stared at the menu the more she understood it. She relaxed a lot and Brian flipped through the menu in a confused manner she found kind of cute. That thought of finding him cute made her blush hard and hide behind her menu. She liked girls, or at least she thought she did. She enjoyed the bouncing of breasts and wet swimsuits. She could recall jacking off to sexy women either nude or in skin tight clothing, and she could definitely recall enjoying the curves of Renee’s body and her other partners back before she had met her. But now those things didn’t seem so attractive, now she found Brian attractive and she wasn’t sure if she was ready for that change. Sexual thoughts about breasts and feminine asses were being exchanged for thoughts of dicks and masculine asses. She began to feel aroused at the thought of a manly butt and blushed even harder when she realized what was going on. But glancing across the table at Brian caused her to blush again but in another way. She recalled that reverse orgasm and the pleasure involved and licked her lips. Breasts didn’t seem so attractive now. What was really making her feel good we’re thoughts of that dick buried in those pants and the more she thought about it the less embarrassing it became. She was a woman and being attracted to members of the opposite sex in her new reality was no big deal. <br />
<br />
By the time their food came Sam was comfortable holding hands with Brian, being on a date with Brian, and finding Brian attractive. She was referring to him as her boyfriend now and it just felt right. She liked the idea of having a boyfriend and the more he talked the more she liked him. From what she could gather most of her interests and hobbies had carried over from being male and the more she thought of it the more she realized she would have been all over a girl like her when she was male. She liked superhero movies, still read comic books, and had an overall geeky demeaner. As much as she was Samantha the baker she was also still Samuel the university student.<br />
<br />
Talking to Brian made her wish she did in fact have some of her new life’s memories because she felt this overwhelming comfort and familiarity that could only have been created thanks to a long time dating.<br />
<br />
Dinner was very good and for once in her life Samantha didn’t end up paying for it. Brian teased her about it being payback for her buying movie tickets last week and Sam blushed hard and laughed feeling like paying for something under Brian’s nose was exactly what she’d do on a regular basis. They stepped outside where some gentle rain had begun to fall and Brian placed a hand on her hip and pulled her in for a psssionate kiss. It surprised Sam for a second before she shut her eyes and leaned into it. They held their lips locked for a few seconds before parting. She wasted no time in grabbing his cheeks and pulling him in for another with tongue involved this time. She loved the feeling, she loved the idea, and she loved the reality of it. She was a girl with a handsome boyfriend and clear baking skills. She couldn’t have been happier. They walked back to the car and Brian started to drive. His hand kept shooting to her leg and she let him rub it in a sensual manner. About halfway through the drive Samantha realized they weren’t heading back to her place and realization washed over her.<br />
<br />
The sexy looks, the nice dinner, the passionate kisses. She recognized the movements from her own previous life as male. She knew what the end goal was and realized she had responded positively to these signs. They were on their way to Brian’s place to have sex. The reverse orgasm she had felt was about to be played forward and panic began to fill her as she faced with more than just a choice on sex. Did she let the sex happen and let Renee be conceived again or did she do something to prevent Renee from being born again. It was hard to think about and she began to feel panic as she realized her choice would decide if a human being she had loved would be born again or not. The choice was demanding but suddenly the car stopped and Brian helped her out getting all touchy with her as he swiped a key card over a lock and entered the building locking lips with her. It felt really nice and intimate and Sam got lost in the passion as they climbed into the elevator, rode up to the sixth floor, and entered his apartment where his roommate was playing video games on the couch. They entered a shabby bedroom and the door was shut before he grinned and began playing with her breasts.<br />
<br />
Samantha moaned and kicked her heels off as Brian undid his belt and began to remove her dress. Her dress slid off leaving her in her underwear and his dick popped out. Samantha opened her mouth to say something as the realization that her decision about Renee had to be made now.</p>
