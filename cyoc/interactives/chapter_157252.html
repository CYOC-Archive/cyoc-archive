<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jen kept her face buried in her paws as the woman taunted her; still too ashamed to look at her. But upon hearing a man’s voice, Jen couldn’t help thinking that it sounded familiar. Out of curiosity she quickly glanced upwards, only to see a young man chatting to Mrs Adams. <br />
<br />
Her heart raced when she realised who it was: it was the same man who had bought Max earlier!<br />
<br />
“Here she is! I can assure you that Jen is a friendly dog” Mrs Adams continued as she talked to the young man, “she’s just a little unfamiliar with her surroundings, that’s all.”<br />
<br />
“Hmmm, she doesn’t seem awfully pleased to see me” the man said, clearly not satisfied with seeing the dog hiding in the corner of her cage. “In fact she seems to be just as unhappy as Max…”<br />
<br />
Hearing that name instantly triggered something inside Jen’s mind. She remembered how eager Max had been to meet her. She thought back to her daydream, and how wonderful it had all felt.<br />
<br />
“…anyway” the man continued, “my wife and I figured that he was probably just lonely. And then we remembered how much Max wanted to get to know Jen here…”<br />
<br />
Hearing that name again set more thoughts off in Jen’s confused mind. If this man bought her, then she could be with Max forever! She just had to make him like her, and then she would be taken back to a warm home, a loving family, and a wonderful companion.<br />
<br />
Naturally the human portion of Jen’s mind was still desperately trying to suppress her body’s urges, but it was clear that this was a one-sided battle. The temptation to fully give in was building as she acted, and was treated like, any other dog.<br />
<br />
In fact, Jenkins’ sanity suffered another blow as his body acted on its own. Despite the doctor’s mental protests, Jen soon found herself walking to the front of her cage to greet her potential new owner. She wagged her tail and licked the man’s fingers when he stuck them through the holes of the cage.<br />
<br />
“Wow! Hello there girl” the man said with a chuckle “I guess you can be friendlier than you led me to believe.” Jen let out a bark of approval as she sensed the man’s growing affection for her.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile Mrs Adams watched the scene with a smile. Dr Jenkins deserved this fate more than most and it was oddly pleasurable to watch as he gradually accepted his new role in life. She imagined seeing Jen with her mind fully broken, acting like an obedient pet. The thought alone made her shiver with delight.<br />
<br />
A few moments later Mrs Adams was broken from her trance as the young man held out his hand. “… Hello? Miss? Do we have a deal?”<br />
<br />
“Of course,” she said after a slight pause, “I’m sure she will make you, and Max, very happy!”<br />
<br />
That name made Jen’s heart beat faster again. She leapt up to greet the young man as he came into the cage. The man chuckled as he tried to calm her down before he fixed the lead to her collar.<br />
<br />
Jen continued to pant and wag her tail as her excitement continued to build. “Thank you miss,” the man said “come on then Jen, time to meet Max again.”<br />
<br />
There it was again! That name always set something off inside the former man’s hazy mind. She started pulling at her lead as her desire to be reunited with Max reached a fever pitch.<br />
<br />
“Pleasure doing business sir,” Mrs Adams replied with a smile. She was amused to see the effect that the word ‘Max’ was having on the horny rottweiler. And so, as a parting shot, she decided to tease Dr Jenkins one last time: “run along now Jen,” she said before pausing for effect, “you don’t want to keep MAX waiting do you?!” <br />
<br />
Hearing that name again made Jen lose what little self-control she had left. She pulled hard at her lead, dragging her new owner along as she headed for the Kennel’s exit. <br />
<br />
The man and dog fought for control all the way to the car that was parked outside. It was then that Jen saw the dark shape sitting in the back of the car. She could see it was him! <br />
<br />
It was clear that Max was just as excited to see her as he barked out to his new companion. He pawed against the car’s back windscreen, desperately trying to get out.<br />
<br />
But instead of Max, it was a young woman who got out of the car. Jen instantly recognised her as the man’s wife, and therefore as one of her owners. The former man didn’t seem to find this concept worrying anymore; now it was just a simple fact that she was their loyal new pet.<br />
<br />
However, what was worrying Jen was the fact that she was still separated from Max. She felt her vagina throb as it begged for some action. Her thoughts narrowed to the point that she was only thinking about submitting to her soon-to-be mate.<br />
<br />
“… and she doesn’t seem to be trained at all.” The man’s wife was clearly having second thoughts about their new pet as she argued with her husband. “She seems to be a bit too lively for the kids. Maybe we should take her back?”<br />
<br />
“Nah she’s just excited to meet everyone, that’s all.” The young man tried to reassure his wife as best he could, “she was really friendly with me just a moment ago, trust me.”<br />
<br />
“You’re just saying that ‘cause you want to start some stupid breeding business on the side.” The young woman put her hands on her hips as her husband seemed to be caught off guard. “Don’t bother denying it; I’ve checked your search history.”<br />
<br />
“Ok, ok, you’re right about the breeding thing, but doesn’t a bit of extra cash sound good? Plus I’m sure she’ll make a fine pet once she’s calmed down. Maybe we could go to a dog training class just in case? And then we can keep a puppy or two for the kids, they’d love that…” The man couldn’t decipher his wife’s thoughts as she stared at him with her hands on her hips. <br />
<br />
The young woman paused for a while as she thought. “Fine, but if she puts a paw out of line we’re bringing her straight back.”<br />
<br />
Her husband nodded his approval, completely surprised by her reply.<br />
<br />
“And,” his wife continued, “the same goes for Max.”<br />
<br />
Hearing Max’s name yet again left Jen practically exploding with need. Her tail wagged furiously as she pawed against the back of the car. Her canine pussy felt hot and wet as her juices started to dribble from between her legs.<br />
<br />
“Yes Jen” the young man said “time to meet your new playmate.”<br />
<br />
Jen watched like a coiled spring as her owner opened the boot of the car. And when he undid her lead she instantly leapt into the car where Max was waiting to greet her.<br />
<br />
The young couple watched as the two dogs re-introduced themselves. However, whereas Jen had been shy during their first meeting, this time she was clearly delighted to see Max up close. She instinctively sniffed under his tail, savouring the same strong masculine scent that had filled her cage. But now the smell was much more concentrated, ensuring that Jen was turned on very quickly.<br />
<br />
Luckily for her the feelings were mutual. Max’s tail also wagged as he sniffed at Jen’s swollen pussy. The bitch shivered in excitement when she felt his broad tongue lapping up her sticky pussy juices. Her tongue lolled out as she moaned in delight. She closed her eyes in ecstasy, which caused her thoughts to slowly drift back to her erotic daydream.<br />
<br />
To Jen’s sheer delight, Max began by teasing her needy pussy with his tongue by licking back and forth over her sensitive mound. However, one key difference from her daydream was that this time Jen was feeling ten times the pleasure. The way her pussy clamped down over his tongue as it wedged her open was pure bliss!<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, the dogs’ new owners had noticed the commotion in the back as they drove along. The young woman clearly wanted them to stop, while her husband saw their attraction as a good thing. In the end the radio was turned up in order to drown out the loud noises of canine passion that were filling the car.<br />
<br />
In fact it wasn’t long before Max decided to shift things up a gear. Just like in Jen&#39;s dream, Max withdrew his tongue before landing roughly on her back. Max steadied her with his front legs as he jabbed urgently with his cock. He missed a few times before finally slipping inside Jen’s virgin pussy. The bitch howled in delight as the sensation of having Max’s stiff member stuffed inside her tight snatch filled her with joy. The way her inner walls hugged his shaft as it sank into her depths was indescribably pleasurable.<br />
<br />
Jen’s pleasure continued to build as Max started roughly humping her, ramming his dick all the way into her again and again. Warm fluids squelched out around Max’s pumping shaft as they spilled out of her stretched vagina. Jen now felt hot all over as she neared an amazing climax.<br />
<br />
Thankfully, Max seemed to be willing to give the bitch what she wanted. Jen felt weak in the knees as Max’s knot bulged inside her, stretching her even more and sealing her fate.<br />
 <br />
Jen braced herself for the release that she knew was coming. The two dogs both howled in delight as they pushed each other over the edge. And then, as Jen had anticipated, Max’s sticky cum started to splurge inside her. She felt herself being filled up as her mate’s knot prevented the mixture from escaping. The warm semen felt good inside her as she milked Max for everything he had.<br />
<br />
By the time they were finished, Jen’s heat had dissipated. She could now think clearly again, which in some ways was unfortunate. Now her human senses were able to return to some degree, meaning that what remained of Dr Jenkins could feel the full magnitude of what had happened. <br />
<br />
The doctor could feel Max’s dick stuffed inside her bitch pussy as the couple waited for his knot to fully deflate. She could also feel Max’s warm semen as it pooled inside her passage and congealed in her fur. The notion of pregnancy instantly haunted the doctor’s thoughts. Surely things couldn’t get any more humiliating than this!?<br />
<br />
Just as she thought this, Max finally extracted his softened member with a wet *pop.* Jen yelped out in surprise as more cum spilled out of her. Clearly overcome by her ordeal, Jen tried to lie down for a nap. Maybe she would wake up to find that this was all some horrible nightmare.<br />
<br />
But Jen had barely put her head down before she was startled. She yelped in shock as she felt Max’s slobbery tongue lapping at the mess been her legs. He stood over her dominantly as he cleaned her crotch attentively. <br />
<br />
It was at this point that Jen noticed that Max’s cock had never returned to its sheath. In fact it was rock hard and covered with various sexual juices, suggesting that he was preparing her for another round. And as much as her human side told her to stop, Jen couldn’t help responding positively to his advances.<br />
<br />
The result of this was that Jen felt obliged to return her mate’s affections. She lovingly cleaned her mate’s shaft with her slobbery tongue before she turned to present herself for another round. She was relieved to feel Max’s comforting presence as he loomed over her yet again. Before long the two dogs were going at it again, wildly fucking in a state of pure animalistic passion.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile the dogs’ new owner smiled as he watched the display in the rear-view mirror. At this rate his planned puppy-selling business would be a terrific success!</p>
