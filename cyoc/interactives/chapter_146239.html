<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">67 year old Velma Hill (A.K.A The old woman) hadd just left the mystical store. On her way home she tried to figure out how the rings were suposed to give her grandchildren. And how would she manage to get her boys to wear them. She thought it would be easiest to get Melvin to wear the ring since he spent most of the day just sleeping on the sofa and she could therfor just slip it on his finger when he was asleep. Jared was going to be more difficult. She did not get to see him all that offten. He was allways so busy with his job. And he lived clear out on the other side of town.<br />
<br />
When she finally got home, she went down to the basement. It was were Melvin&#39;s room was. She peekd her head into his room.<br />
<br />
And there Melvin was. Sleeping on the sofa. Snoring loudly. He hadd cheeto dust on his fingers and around his mouth. He was wearing a Star Trek T-shirt, greay sweatpants and a dirty black hoody. He was very pale. He hadd unkempt greasy brown hair, a scraggly beard and altho he was not in any way obese, so was he deffently out of shape. <br />
<br />
Ther were some empty beer cans laying on the floor and next to the cheeto bag. So Melvin hadd clearly been day drinking igen. This was somthing Velma really could not stand. At all. And she lost her temper as she usually did when diss occurred. And she started to yell at Melvin.<br />
<br />
And the usual arguing and bickering commenced. All thoughts of magical rings dissepeard. At least for the moment.<br />
<br />
A few week&#39;s later, at Velma&#39;s 68th birthday &quot;party&quot; (witch was really just Jared coming over for dinner) however, while Velma as she waited for her oldes son Jared to arive at the &quot;party&quot; she started looking through a old photo album she felt old igen. As she looked at the pictures her wanting for grandchildren grow. The pictures hadd been mostly taken by her late husband Conner Hill whom had died 14 years ago do to kidney failure. And now all that was left of her family was herself and her two singel childless middel age son&#39;s. Velma started thinking about the rings igen. Should she try to get them to use them during the &quot;party&quot;.<br />
<br />
Jared finally arrived. He was about a half hour late for the &quot;party&quot;. Jared was a real workaholic.<br />
<br />
Jared was clean shaven and bold. He was wearing a suit but no tie. He was in bether  shape then his littel brother, but not by mutch.<br />
<br />
After giving his mother a quick hug he just as quickly excused himself and left the room to take an phone call from an important client. <br />
<br />
Velma followd him into the kitchen. She patiently waited for him to  finish his phone call. After about 10 min or so, were he finaly finished. Velma then presnted him with one of the magical rings and sheepishly asked him to take it on. Jared arggued that the ring clearly was a womans engagement ring and a kind of cheep looking one at that. Moreover he sincerely doubt that the ring would even fit him. And lastly so did he just find the request plain odd. But after a bit more whineing he rolled his eyes in utter annoyance and gave in to her stupid request.<br />
<br />
Prepared to be underwhelmed by whatever this superstitious humbug his mother had gotten into her head he hold his hand out and let his mother put the ring on his finger. <br />
<br />
Surprisingly the ring went on with out any problem. Jared was about to comment on it. But then an intense pink light flashed from the ring. The flash lasted no longer then a single picosecond. But the effect was clear as day.<br />
<br />
Vilma was completely taken aback by what she saw, for were her son Jared Hill the loathly upstate lawyer hadd been standing the picosecond befor, stod now what only could be described as the daughter she never had. The familly resemblens was almost uncanny. It was most deffently a female vertion of Jared. <br />
<br />
She was wearing a cute pair of sandals, some makeup, a bracelet, the engagement ring, a wedding ring, and a belted withe cardigan over a black maxi dress. She had her middback lenght dark brown hair in a low chignon bun. She was also clearly pregnant. In her third trimester to be exact.<br />
<br />
Jared was even more perplexed then his mother. As he hadd gone from bieng a fair bit taller then his mother to suddenly being on eyelevel with her. Looking down on his new small, delicat, feminine, manicured hands. Looking down on his new breast and pregnant belly. Feeling the soft fabric of the dress and female undergarments, as well as the straps of his bra and hair on his head. Smelling the sent of chocolate cake and hearing chatter from the living room?<br />
<br />
Jared thought they hadd been alone.</p>
