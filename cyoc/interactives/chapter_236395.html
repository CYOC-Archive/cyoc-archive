<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">2041<br />
<br />
To look at the small town in Eastern Connecticut, it would be easy to dismiss it as just another quaint New England town. Appearances though, as it is often said, can be deceiving.<br />
<br />
Within this town lived a group of wizards. A group who for 25 years protected not only the mortal realm but the supernatural as well. Katie O&#39;Toole, wife of Kellie Carlson, and their friends helped usher magic back into the world, protecting humanity from creatures large and small that wished to cause harm. As the years passed, more would join their cause. Dhamphirs, powerful half vampire hybrids. Kitsune, a mystical race of fox humanoids from Asian mythology. Demon Hunters, humans sworn to defend humanity from the nightmares that dwell in the shadows. Fairies, whimsical creatures of nature. All manner of allies flocked to the wizards side, from secret government agencies to entities that reigned over the very essence of creation.<br />
<br />
The early years were hard, Katie and the others forces to fight for their very survival. All manner of villain attempting to stop what Katie and the others hoped to create. These darker forces sensed subconsciously that Katie would shape the world, a world where magic and the supernatural were no longer shunned but accepted. It was during those times that Katie would be identified as the Catalyst, a magical entity that would shape human history for the remainder of the century. By 2024, Katie and her friends, along with a second Catalyst of the future, would beat back one last foe; securing a prosperous future. In time, this first generation would settle down, having children of their own. Of these children the most prosperous would be a family instrumental in Katie&#39;s rise to power.<br />
<br />
The Harris family.<br />
<br />
Oldest of this second generation was Tom. Tom &quot;Tommy&quot; Harris was the eldest of the Harris family. At 24, he was the eldest son of Cole and Kumiko Harris. Possessing magic like his aunts Claudia and Mika, he along with his younger sister Yuriko were forging a path for their future. A future that currently seemed dim for the young adults.<br />
<br />
Tom was at a crossroads. As a police officer, he found himself in the center of an investigation. In order to defend the life of his partner, he had tapped into his magic, injuring the person who tried to take their lives. Magic though, was not something the police department was ready to acknowledge as Tom now found his career in limbo, awaiting a review boards ruling.<br />
<br />
For Tom&#39;s sister Yuriko, she was hoping to change her future. Always a skilled wizard, the 21 year old Yuriko was hoping to graduate college in the spring before marrying her college boyfriend Benjamin Mishimura. Although a powerful psychic, Yuriko was unhappy with what she believed to be her fate. From a young age she learned that it would be her task to train the next Catalyst, a boy in the 22nd century named Darren McKenna. For the young Yuriko it seemed unfair. She was no teacher, she barely liked babysitting her younger cousins when she was in high school. It seemed so unfair for her life to already be determined. She wanted nothing more than to settle down with Ben, start a family, start a career. To think that her life was already predetermined led the young woman to rebel slightly.<br />
<br />
Although Cole&#39;s children were prominent in the Wizarding community, it was the children of Claudia and Mika that garnered even more attention.<br />
<br />
Kari Harris, the 22 year old adopted daughter and kitsune heiress to Mika and Claudia. Prim, proper, respectful, these were the terms used to describe the young three tailed kitsune. As the oldest of four siblings, Kari was the one to set an example. To be the rock for her twin siblings Aaron and Haley, to nurture her little brother Mason or to be the confidant to the adopted daughter of Katie and Kellie, the former Morgan Lefay, Morgan Carlson. Still, Kari did struggle internally, pulled between the human and kitsune realms. Raised by two human mothers while being the daughter of kitsune royalty led the young woman to want to prove herself. In time, she would need to choose one side or find balance.<br />
<br />
Balance is something Kari&#39;s sister Haley was in desperate need of. At 21 the kintaro woman was a being of pure chaos. Feared by enemies and fretted over by family, the young woman lived in the now, giving her mothers more gray hair than they cared to count. All they could hope for was that at some point, Haley would begin to settle down. Haley&#39;s twin though was another story entirely.<br />
<br />
Aaron Harris, Haley&#39;s 21 year old twin brother was the picture of responsibility. Trained as a demon hunter since the age of 3 by the Moreland family, Aaron was the epitome of professionalism. Beloved by the Moreland family and his best friend, Chase Moreland, Aaron was seen as the future by his surrogate father Caleb Moreland. Still, under the tough exterior, both Mika and Claudia worried about their eldest son.<br />
<br />
As a child Aaron witnessed the death of his mother, an act that was altered thanks in part to the intervention of the entities Life and Death. Instead, Aaron was witness to the death of his grandmother. Despite the entities power to bring back his mother, they could not erase the experience leaving the young kintaro haunted. Despite his boasts of being okay, both Mika and Claudia had their doubts. Aaron was quiet, keeping to himself. He was protective of his siblings, especially his younger brother Mason or surrogate siblings in the case of Chase Moreland and Charlotte Moreland. While Caleb believed that Aaron was perhaps the greatest hunter the Moreland clan had ever seen, his mothers worried about the young man&#39;s demons and if they would surface. Connor Moreland and his wife, Spark Moreland try to make sure that never happens.<br />
<br />
With the worries Mika and Claudia had over their supernatural children, it was seen as a blessing that their youngest son was not apart of that world. Mason Harris, their 16 year old son, was a pleasant surprise in more ways than one. A gift from the entity Life, Mika and Claudia expected the boy to follow in his siblings and cousins footsteps, becoming a powerful wizard. Instead, the boy appeared non magical, much to his chagrin. Throughout his life, the boy longed to be like his siblings, to be powerful, to be magical, to be a hero...like they were. Instead, he appeared to be as normal as any other teenage boy. While his mother&#39;s always told him he was special and his siblings loved him unconditionally, the boy always wanted to prove himself. In his opinion, the Harris family were heroes and he wanted to be one too. The one he confided in the most and the one who he had seen as his long time friend was Anjelica O&#39;Toole-Kirkman, who like him, was a gift to her parents, Ann and Jackie, from Life as well. Anjelica was very much loved by her mothers and her older sister, Stephanie and her husband,Travis, the son of Life and Death themselves. Anjelica and Mason had been inseparable since being toddlers and while neither one wants to admit it, they&#39;re both developing feelings for the other.<br />
<br />
Now 17 years after securing their future the Harris children find themselves on the brink of history. Unknown to them, their lives are about to change for better or worse. How those changes affect the remainder of the 21st century though is anyone&#39;s guess.</p>
