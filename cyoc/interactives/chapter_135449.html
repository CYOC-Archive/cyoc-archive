<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Marcus didn&#39;t want to wake up but something was pushing him so he opened his eyes. After the first foggy seconds, he realized he wasn&#39;t in the cabin anymore.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m so happy you&#39;re awake.&quot; James, one of his cabinmates told him.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the hell!?!! Where are we!?!&quot; Marcus panicked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shh!!&quot; Sam, another of Marcus&#39; cabinmates said. &quot;They still think we&#39;re sleeping.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Who?&quot; Marcus whispered this time.<br />
<br />
&quot;The aliens.&quot; James said. &quot;We&#39;re on a spaceship. We&#39;re abducted.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Abducted?! Holy shiit!!!&quot; Marcus shouted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shhh!!&quot; Sam repeated. &quot;I told you to be quiet.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hold on a second.&quot;  Marcus said. &quot;Where is Mason?&quot;<br />
<br />
Both guys stayed quiet for a moment until Sam spoke again.<br />
<br />
&quot;I saw it...&quot; He paused. &quot;He woke up earlier and panicked, just like you did; but he was seen...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He was vaporized.&quot; James continued. &quot;Only his clothes remained. Over there.&quot;<br />
<br />
A pile of clothing was on the floor near to where Marcus was standing. There wasn&#39;t any sign of flesh, blood or anything. After seen it, Marcus tried to scream but he held it back. Tears began to came out from his eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry.&quot; Sam said as he put a hand over Marcus&#39; shoulder. &quot;I know he was your best friend. We haven&#39;t touched it, so you can be the first to hug the last of him.&quot;<br />
<br />
Marcus kneeled and grabbed the clothes but, at that moment, he felt something odd inside. He began to look what was in there and what he discovered was nothing like what he expected.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hahahahaha!!!!&quot; James and Sam began to laugh uncontrollably to the dildo in Marcus&#39; hands. &quot;Look at your face!! What a joke!! Hahaha!!&quot;<br />
<br />
Marcus&#39; face turned red of shame. He was holding a huge pink dildo as a part a joke. The &#39;spaceship&#39; was just a small montage that his cabinmates made in order to prank him. They pushed it down revealing  that they were at their cabin.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re so innocent, Marcus!!&quot; James laughed. &quot;Aliens. Did you really believe that?! Hahaha!!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Shut up!!&quot; Marcus yelled completely embarrassed. &quot;I truly believed that Mason was vaporized!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hahaha. He&#39;s fine. He&#39;s outside waiting.&quot; Sam laughed. &quot;Come on, Mason!! You can come in!!&quot;<br />
<br />
They waited a moment but no one came in.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mason! The joke was done. It was a complete success!!&quot; James shouted but Mason didn&#39;t come in. &quot;Mason?&quot;<br />
<br />
When they realized that Mason wasn&#39;t answering they began to worry. Except for Marcus, who thought that they were still joking at him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on,  guys!&quot; Marcus said. &quot;I won&#39;t fall twice.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re not joking now.&quot; Sam said as he came close to the door. &quot;Mason, are you ok?&quot; But he didn&#39;t get an answer. He opened the door but ot was completely dark outside. &quot;It&#39;s too late and he didn&#39;t have a flashlight. Where could he have gone?&quot;<br />
<br />
Sam walked a little until he could no longer be seen in the dark. Marcus and James waited for a moment, but neither Sam nor Mason came back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sam!!&quot; James shouted but didn&#39;t get a response. He slowly approached to the door until he was next to the night darkness. &quot;Sam! Mason!&quot; He took a step but stopped when he felt he&#39;d stepped on something. He slowly crouched and grabbed what was on the floor.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on! Another dildo?!!&quot; Marcus shouted. &quot;You said that you weren&#39;t joking this time!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, it&#39;s not a joke.&quot; James said. &quot;We only have one dildo.&quot; He rubbed a little at the thing in his hands. &quot;This feels weird... like if it was real... like of it was ali-!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
James didn&#39;t stopped his sentence when a mysterious green laser beam shot him. Marcus was seen completely astounded how James body was contracting, like an implosion. His arms and his legs were sucked inside his torso in an instant. His clothes vanished at the same time and he was just a head, a torso and... genitals.<br />
<br />
In the weirdest way possible, his torso moved inside his dick closely followed by his head until what was left of James were just his dick and balls which fell on the floor after the green light dissipated.<br />
<br />
Marcus was speechless, he can&#39;t believe what he just saw. His friend was turned into his genitals and then he realized that the &#39;dildo&#39; that James found a minute before could be Mason or Sam. Something outside had turned his friends into dicks and probably he could be the next.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, he closed the door and all the windows in the cabin. He grabbed his bat and blocked the door with a bed. Whatever that was outside wasn&#39;t going to get him so easily. He hid behind another bed and waited. A silent minute.<br />
<br />
Then, some pushings began to sound from the door. It didn&#39;t cease for several minutes until it suddenly stopped. Marcus waited, he was so scared that he didn&#39;t dare to approach.<br />
<br />
After almost an hour, he thought that whatever that was outside could have left the place. He sighed relieved but his work wasn&#39;t done yet. He looked for what was left of his friends.<br />
<br />
He quickly found James and whoever the other dick was. He knew that the last one can&#39;t be in the cabin, so he slowly opened the door. He was so frightened that he didn&#39;t move for almost five minutes until he felt it was ok to go out.<br />
<br />
He didn&#39;t go far when he found the last dick on the ground. He ran back to the cabin and closed the door as soon as je could do it. He breathed a sigh of relief and closed his eyes for a second. That was a mistake.<br />
<br />
Before he could do anything, the green ray beam shot him. He could feel how his limbs were moving inside his body at the same time that his clothes vanished in the air. It wasn&#39;t painful but extremely arousing and, in fact, his dick was completely hard since the beginning. He hadn&#39;t thought about it, but all his friends where raging erections. That&#39;s why they looked like dildos.<br />
Maybe those were his last rational thoughts because the arousal that he was feeling was so strong and powerful that he wasn&#39;t scared anymore, he didn&#39;t screamed or anything. He just felt the pleasure of being turning into his dick.<br />
When his torso was sucked inside and just his head was left, except for his genitals, he said his last word.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck!&quot; He shouted before his head disappeared and a big load of cum came out from what was now the disembodied dick of Marcus.</p>
