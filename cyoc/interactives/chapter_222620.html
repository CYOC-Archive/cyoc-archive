<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It felt like Antonio had never left, the pain of that night once again fresh in his mind as he stood at the entrance of the charred den entrance, gazing down at the few charcoal husks of some desperate chemelimen, a few nightmare wolves as well, all desperate to escape the inferno that night. Antonio then felt a hand on his shoulder, turning to see Lilith gazing at the den entrance, her free hand stroking over her brood filled womb &quot;listen kitty, we can find another place to stay, if this it too painful for you&quot; she said, leaning her head against his arm.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, I need to do this, I need to let them go&quot; he said with a sad sigh, the flames on his body going Dom before he stepped forward and stretched out his hand &quot;my pack, my followers, servants, friends, you are no longer bound to this place&quot; he said as he prepared his skill &quot;be free now&quot;<br />
SKILL Earth manipulation, Soul domination ACTIVE: releasing targets from Soul domination.<br />
<br />
With a sigh he watched as the burned remains of everything and everyone emerged from the cave, turning to dust as it was sent swirling into the dense clouds above, just as the last of the remains were sent skyward a snowflake could be seen fluttering down from above, melting as it got close to Antonio&#39;s solar heat, looking back he saw Heleli and Helen bringing what equipment from their previous camp they could find<br />
&quot;Leave it ladies, let&#39;s get inside before the snow starts coming down&quot; he called, both of them nodding as they dropped everything at the foot of the hill, Lilith hastily floating into tha cave, Helen slithering past with a hint of fatigue, clearly the cold weather wasn&#39;t fit for Lamia&#39;s.<br />
<br />
Lilith waddled forward, stopping when she saw Antonio wasn&#39;t following &quot;hey big guy, you still with us?&quot; She said with a chuckle, but Antonio didn&#39;t move, giving him a sad smile she waddled over to him and took his hands, placing them on her belly &quot; hey, these little brats are gonna need their sire when they&#39;re born, so that means I&#39;m gonna need you too, we all are&quot;<br />
Antonio sighed, and after a pause gave a simple nod before walking into the den.<br />
<br />
Upon entering  the den the beast-man set to work, slamming his hands into the stone and enforced his will upon it, forcing the surroundings of the cave to shift to his desire, the cave became large and circular, creating a ring around the edge as the center seemed to buckle upon itself, dropping into a black abyss, the entrance to the den grew grand, being formed of a shiny black stone, deeming to grow and shift from the walls, there were beams angling downward from the top of the den entrance, which seemed to grow tall, retaining it&#39;s original width, connecting to large triangular sheets of black stone angling in opposite directions of eachother on either side, the to of the beams being connected by what looked to be a long ribcage made of the same material, the front of the caves ring extended into a balcony, with a round fire encircled stone plate in its center, which Antonio now knelt upon. Around the edge of the pit large archways formed, large pillars growing up from the depths connecting each together, growing in the corners like spiderwebs of stone, creating angled interior structures, this pattern continued down into the pit, crosswalks and pillars floating suspended in the air, branching from one side of the abyss to the other in various positions and angles as the darkness below swallowed it up, all three women watched in amazement as all this happened, untill their eyes were drawn across the pit, opposite to where they stood.<br />
<br />
There at the opposite side of the pit grew another large balcony, extending to the center of large abyssal drop, a design similar to that of the entrance growing from the black stone two triangles rose towards the ceiling, facing opposite sides of eachother, two large beams erupted from their tips, sprouting and curving like horns as they merged with the cave wall behind them, a large circle growing between the triangular walls before spider webbing towards the center point, stopping as a miniature sun grew into existence, it&#39;s light a ghostly blue, pulsing like a beating heart in perfect sync with Antonio&#39;s, a waterfall of that blue fire began to pore from its ghostly heart, castcading into the abyss, it&#39;s light being swallowed by the only black.<br />
<br />
A glowing membrane sprang forth between the circles black spider web, glowing and pulsing in time with the ghostly sun, like a stain glass window of sorts, the horns then sprouted stone plates, angling in sync with the triangular walls, before going straight as they came towards the floor, the perfect hight for someone at least ten foot tall, a large door appearing on either side of the pits top ring, another black ribcage forming on the underside of the black buildings balcony, it&#39;s spine and ribs angling and embedding into the wall below, the obsidian like substance that made up the structure cracking and reforming stronger and stronger each time with each feature placed, it was then that the floors and walls of the top rim came to life, vines sprouting up from the darkness, wrapping and clutching to the pits arches and crosswalks as it twisted and wove their way to the top, blooming into red leaved trees at the top, basking in the pale suns light, patches of red flowers sprouted on the floor and walls, some sections of the walls looking to be made of hundreds and hundreds of bones.<br />
<br />
Finally all was still, all was quiet, the three women looked around in awe at what Antonio had created in what felt like a matter of seconds, the beating of the keeps solar heart sending pulses of warmth and energy through their bodies, curiously Heleli floated down to the ground and plucked a flower from the wall, examining as it unraveled into a beautiful bloom, hair like tendrils uncoiling from the petals, letting free a fragrance of sugar and honey, so sweet to the senses, Heleli was so overwhelmed by it&#39;s sweetness she took a bite, squealing in excitement at the eruption of sweetness on her tongue.<br />
Lilith didn&#39;t move from her spot, she stood there in awe, in awe of the structure Antonio had build, in awe of his power, in awe of him, she brought her hand to the iron collar around her neck, her mind, body and soul belonged to one of the most powerful being in the realm, with a lustful grin she then brought both hands to her collosal womb &quot;and I&#39;m carrying his brood&quot; she said aloud, feeling as her orb of life stirred with movement from within, grimacing slightly from their strength, but now relishing each and every movement<br />
&quot;Yes, yes my children, grow big and strong like your side&quot; she cooed, caressing her pregnant belly, her attention then brought upward as the ring of fire erupted higher, Antonio now hidden from view in the flames, only his silhouette visible, all three watched as Antonio dug his hand into the plate he stood on, grasping a shard of the obsidian material, and drew it from the ground, it&#39;s form twisting and growing, the solid mass becoming as playable as bread dough, sharpening, stretching, twisting, untill the flames died, Antonio&#39;s bodily flame now matching that of the cool blue heart of fire, his flames now being drawn into a black sword he held aloft, it&#39;s surface cracked and splintered, the flames knitting the sword into one mighty weapon, one side perfectly straight, the other, rugged and jagged like a tooth or stone, the cross guard appearing as two wings of fire.<br />
<br />
Antonio then held the sword in both hands, the tip resting on the floor as he let out a laugh of triumph &quot;ladies, your king welcomes you home, with this blade, I will take what I must from others so we may live the lives we choose&quot; he said, stepping down from his plate of stone and standing Infront of Lilith, looking over at Heleli as she continued to nibble on the flowers around the pit before Antonio beckoned her over, the tiny succubus being more than happy to fly over, nuzzling her naked form into Antonio&#39;s chest, lust filling her eyes, Antonio then placed a hand on Lilith&#39;s belly, sighing in content before turning and walking along the ring of the pit, the three demon women in tow until they at last reached the door to the keep, each side of the door guarded by two statues, their spears crossed above the door, the wall seeming to look like it was made of overlapping panels of vertical slats of black shining stone.<br />
<br />
Antonio then attached the sword at his hip before turning to face them with a warm smile &quot;ladies, your king welcomes you to your new home, welcome to The Hellmouth&quot;</p>
