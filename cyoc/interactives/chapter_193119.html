7. If you have seen the aquarium, leave immediately and call the phone marked on the map to inform.<br />
8. Don&#39;t feed the rabbits. The rest of the animals are fine.<br />
9. The rabbit does not laugh. If you hear laughter obviously not coming from the direction of tourists when visiting the rabbit park, please tear off the dotted line on the map and hold it before leaving the park. Do not leave your hand when you leave the zoo completely.<br />
10. If you have violated any of the above and find that you are lost and separated from other acquaintances, please find the nearest beverage store within a quarter of an hour and inform the salesperson in blue overalls there (note, if you see The salesperson in black overalls, please pretend not to hear whatever the other person says to you), he will immediately take you to the work passage of the Lion Park. Don’t be afraid, the lions here will not attack you, hide behind the rockery. After all the white lions begin to roar, the staff will take you out of the park (please make sure he is in blue). At this time, your family and friends Will be waiting for you at the gate of the Lion Park. After all this, leave the zoo immediately.<br />
11. There are only four white lions in this garden. If you see more than four white lions roaring in the situation described in Article 10, do not leave the park and inform the staff to wait until the number of white lions recovers to four before leaving.<br />
12. You can buy any animal toys, including rabbits, for children 12 years old and below; children 13-17 years old after buying the rabbit doll, please throw it away within one month; people 18 years old and above are not allowed to buy rabbit toys.<br />

14. The Lion Park is safe. If you encounter any dangerous incident that you cannot solve and cannot seek help, please go to the Lion Park immediately, unscrupulously, and do everything possible.<br />
15. Be wary of friends who have been away with you more than once, especially when they repeatedly advise you to go to the aquarium or elephant park.<br />
<br />
As long as you follow the above rules, you will have a pleasant zoo journey! Both you and your children will receive countless happiness and knowledge! Follow the rules, pay attention to safety, and wish you and your family and friends have fun!<br />
<br />
================================================== ==============<br />
employee rules<br />
<br />
The park has extremely high employee benefits, ten times overtime pay, a large amount of annual leave, and insurance for all employees. I hope you will work hard to ensure your safety while keeping in mind the staff rules. Life is precious, only this time, for your family, please protect yourself and abide by the following rules.<br />
<br />
1. If you find the escaped rabbits, don&#39;t catch them directly, and don&#39;t approach them. Lead them to the lion park. Please leave the rest to the white lions.<br />
2. There is only one street in the Ape Park. If visitors report that there are two streets and the animals on display include rabbits, please lead the tourists who have entered the park to the left street and close the entrance of the park. After all tourists leave the park, block the ape park for at least ten minutes.<br />
3. If you notice that the elephant you observe is seriously inconsistent with the image of the elephant on the sign when inspecting the elephant park, stop observing and repeatedly tell yourself that the real elephant is like the creature on the sign, not what you saw .<br />
4. If you work in a beverage store, please check the shelf every hour. If you find &quot;rabbit blood&quot; appearing out of thin air, put it away immediately and store it properly.<br />
5. Prune the shrubs in the rabbit park every other month, and try not to let the park appear shaded.<br />
6. There is no aquarium in this park. If your colleague mentions the aquarium to you and is sure that it exists, stop the conversation immediately. This colleague is no longer someone you know.<br />
7. If you see the aquarium, do not enter, tell yourself that it does not exist, and leave immediately.<br />
8. The interval of feeding rabbits is once every seven days. Do not feed any snacks other than the prescribed ingredients.<br />
9. If you hear laughter that is clearly not in the direction of the tourists in the rabbit park, tear off the last page of the employee handbook along the dotted line and hold it in your hand, then go to the elephant park and throw this page into the lawn in the park. Other staff will know what happened and will not blame you for throwing garbage.<br />
10. If a tourist asks you for help, claiming to be separated from family and friends under the premise of violating the tourist regulations, immediately take the tourist to the Lion Park and hand it to the staff at the Lion Park, they will know what to do. During this period you may meet colleagues in black overalls trying to participate in your work, refusing and ignoring them. They are not your colleagues.<br />
11. There are only four white lions in the Lion Park. When the number of white lions suddenly increased to more than four, show them the &quot;rabbit blood&quot; and splash it on the first white lion that ran over immediately. After doing all this, leave immediately. Don&#39;t stalk the extra white lions during this period.<br />
12. Don&#39;t hide/organize/restock/use rabbit surroundings. Try not to touch the surrounding rabbits in this garden. If the tourist proposes to buy the rabbit surroundings, make sure that the person who will own it is underage, otherwise don&#39;t sell it.<br />
13. If you see a person with rabbit earrings entering the elephant park, immediately disperse the nearby tourists and stay at the door of the elephant park until you hear the screaming of children in the park.<br />
14. It is normal to feel tinnitus/chest tightness/migraine/red and swollen eyes within five minutes, so don&#39;t worry too much. But if the phenomenon lasts for more than five minutes, stop working immediately and do whatever you can to go to the Lion Park as quickly as possible.<br />
15. Treat the white lions kindly. When there are only four white lions, there is no need to take any precautions against them. They have been trained to be close to humans since they were young. If you are unfortunately attacked by a white lion in a normal state but did not die on the spot, rules 6 and 7 shall be invalidated. Don&#39;t rush to the hospital, you won&#39;t die. After leaving the Lion Park, head to the Aquarium, you will find it soon. You will put on black work clothes.<br />
================================================== ========<br />
A notice posted at the entrance of the Aquarium<br />
<br />
If you are lucky enough to see this notice, please keep it quiet. It is taboo to let others discover that you can see. I believe you can see from the rules on the map that this zoo is not safe, even weird. We are an unannounced government organization dedicated to protecting innocent tourists. Please follow the rules below to ensure your life. This is the only way for you to escape from this zoo.<br />
<br />
1. Enter the aquarium, there is no one here, just pick up a black uniform to put on at the door. This is the only way to send signals to our staff to be rescued. When you are walking outside, our staff will notice your clothes. Don&#39;t worry about official zoo employees making trouble for you, they won&#39;t take care of you.<br />
2. Don&#39;t go to the Lion Park.<br />
3. Make sure there are rabbits wherever you are, running rabbits, toys around the rabbits, people with rabbit earrings, or &quot;rabbit blood&quot; in the drink shop. Rabbits are our secret sign, they symbolize &quot;safety&quot; and &quot;protection.&quot;<br />
4. When visiting the Elephant Park, do not look at the signs.<br />
5. Don&#39;t believe any slogan on the map, and don&#39;t follow it. If you do any of them, please check the dotted line on the map provided by each person at the entrance of the zoo immediately, tear it off along the dotted line, go to the rabbit park, and feed this piece of paper to the rabbit as far as possible without being found. Then stay here. When you hear the laughter obviously not coming from the direction of the tourists, you can leave the park. After this, please go to the Ape Park, the safety exit is at the end of the street on the right.<br />
================================================== =======<br />
A note picked up by a tourist, with the scribbled &quot;Escape and Live&quot; written in the corner<br />
<br />
1. &quot;Rabbit blood&quot; does not exist, it is &quot;goat meat&quot; (this article has been repeatedly written and crossed out, and the crossed out content is not clear)<br />
2. The goat area is an elephant (a crooked elephant with bunny ears is drawn below this sentence)<br />
3. Rabbits can eat apes (this sentence is crossed out, and a question mark is circled on the word ape), and cannot talk to the staff in the ape park, cannot go out, cannot feed the apes, and cannot be when there is only one road Enter<br />
4. Cannot enter the aquarium when there is no one<br />
5. Only &quot;goat meat&quot; is edible<br />
6. If the aquarium turns off the lights at night, you can spend the night in the aquarium, they will not lock the door<br />
7. The first four white lions are apes, the fifth white lion is a goat, the rabbit is an elephant, and blue is black (this sentence has been emphasized)<br />
8. You are an elephant (this sentence is extremely scribbled)<br />
9. I am a goat (this sentence is very neatly written)<br />
================================================== =======<br />
Notices posted inside the aquarium<br />
<br />
1. Do not enter the aquarium when there are people. If you are received by a staff member after you come in, please find an excuse to leave immediately after reading this notice.<br />
2. If you see this notice, no staff has appeared, you can stay to visit and rest. The food here is free and you can take it yourself, but do not eat &quot;goat meat&quot;. If you see such food on the shelf, please ignore it.<br />
3. If you enter before 16:00, stay in the aquarium for no more than half an hour.<br />
4. If you enter after 16:01, stay in the aquarium for at least four hours.<br />
5. This is the aquarium, which only stores marine life. If you see an elephant swimming in the water in the whale zone, please don&#39;t shout loudly or make a public reaction. It is a 3D projection effect placed for fun. Treat it as usual and pretend that it is a whale.<br />
6. The aquarium can be used for overnight stays. On the left hand side of the jellyfish area, there are temporary rooms for homeless people or tourists on travel. If necessary, please turn off the jellyfish night light built in the room before going to sleep.<br />
7. Our staff wear red clothes uniformly, and only carry out daily cleaning and inspection of the aquarium after 12:30 in the evening. If you meet someone in black overalls who claim to be a staff member of the aquarium, you can talk to them, or agree to let them serve as temporary guides, but don&#39;t give your map to the other party, especially the part torn off along the dotted line.<br />
8. Violation of the above regulations, security issues at your own risk.<br />
9. The aquarium exists and does not serve any organization.<br />
================================================== =====<br />
Oceanarium Staff Code<br />
<br />
1. The aquarium does not need to work during the day, and your working hours are from 12:30 in the evening to 6:00 the next day. It is possible to arrive late and leave early, but do not arrive early and work overtime.<br />
2. The hourly room on the left hand side of the jellyfish area is prepared for the nearby homeless and tourists in need. After work, please check if they turn off the jellyfish night light before 1:00. If not, remind them until they close. You have the right to forcibly turn off the jellyfish night light, no matter what, do not let the jellyfish night light remain on after 1:15.<br />
3. The corpse of the elephant drowned in the whale zone is an experimental 3D projection technology. No matter how real it looks, just ignore it. Don&#39;t explore the switch position either, it is not necessary to be turned off.<br />
4. The equipment in the monitoring room has been damaged and inconvenient to repair, so please patrol once an hour. Sudden power outages and unknown noise are normal, so don’t worry about the safety of those fish. If you feel uneasy, you can rest in the jellyfish area. The power supply equipment in the jellyfish area is complete, and there will never be a power outage.<br />
5. It is normal for foreign tourists to hold a zoo map. Don&#39;t answer the topic of &quot;Where is the aquarium in the zoo?&quot; If the other party insists on asking, you can leave immediately.<br />
6. Remember to charge the jellyfish night light before going off work on Sunday, no matter what, don&#39;t forget it.<br />
7. Change the food on the shelf once a day. If you find unfamiliar food labeled &quot;goatmeat&quot;, please receive it separately in the storage box in the whale area. Someone will handle it for you.<br />
8. You can take a walk anywhere in the hall during work, but do not leave the aquarium. If overnight visitors try to leave before 6:00 am, discourage them as much as possible. If you can&#39;t stop it, you don&#39;t have to have physical conflicts, and you don&#39;t have to leave with them, just continue to do your own thing.<br />
9. If the lodging tourists wear black overalls similar to yours, refuse them to stay overnight and use tough methods to drive them away. Electric shock rods and anesthesia guns are placed on the workbench in the jellyfish area.<br />
10. If the lodging tourists carry around the rabbits, steal them after they fall asleep and put them in the storage box in the whale area. Visitors won&#39;t ask you when they wake up.<br />
11. If the guest who is staying at the hotel tries to chat with you, you can chat, as long as you don&#39;t delay and turn off the lights in time. Don&#39;t mention &quot;zoo&quot; in the topic. If the other person mentions it, change the topic immediately.<br />
12. The aquarium is operated independently and there is no zoo outside. Keep this in mind.<br />
A post-it note posted by a security guard working in the Elephant Park three years ago in the security room<br />
Hello, people who change shifts with me, people who come to the security room by accident, or new people who see this note in the future. During your work, please do in accordance with the requirements of the sticky note. This is the work experience that I have accumulated to maintain safety and mental stability. I don&#39;t want to lose another colleague, and I don&#39;t want to experience inexplicable things again. I believe you don&#39;t want it either. After reading these advices, just pretend to do your thing without seeing it.<br />
1. Always remember the color of your clothes. It can be any color, red, blue, black. Don&#39;t change the color of clothes. It is very important to maintain firmness in self-awareness. Don&#39;t let &quot;it&quot; find that you are hesitant and uncertain about the perception of the outside world.<br />
2. To believe. To believe. To believe. Humans are worthy of youOnly humans deserve to be trusted.<br />
3. Rabbits can eat people, but people with rabbit earrings will not. The shade can eat people, but the shade trimmer will not. Elephants can eat people, people who watch elephants can&#39;t, and people who don&#39;t watch elephants can&#39;t. White lions can eat people, but glowing jellyfish cannot. (Immature like a child&#39;s handwriting: because jellyfish have no brains?)<br />
4. &quot;It&quot; will cry if it is blocked, and laugh if it succeeds. Don&#39;t care what &quot;it&quot; is, as long as you find &quot;it&quot;, you must stay away. They don&#39;t know yet.<br />
5. Food that appears on the shelf inexplicably anywhere is a temptation. Don&#39;t look at the sign on the food, and don&#39;t care how others call it. Ignore it, buy it as normal food if necessary, and eat it. Don&#39;t let &quot;it&quot; know that you have noticed &quot;it&quot;.<br />
================================================== ==<br />
Zoo Director’s Office Document<br />
(No title, no introduction, just a printed document, stuck on the wooden table with tape)<br />
1. Accept any employee, no matter what color they wear. Although the zoo only provides blue overalls, if someone shows up wearing the same style of black/red overalls, please treat them as employees.<br />
2. When there is no one, it is normal for children to cry and laugh outside the office. Ignore, pretend not to hear, and never show restlessness or irritability.<br />
3. Employees are not allowed to bring pets to the zoo. If someone insists on breaking it, there is no need to fine, just ask the other party to bear the consequences.<br />
4. Check the number of white lions in the Lion Park every three days, and record the frequency of changes in the number of white lions, and store it in the table in the computer folder &quot;it&quot;. Don&#39;t ask what &quot;it&quot; refers to. Do not rename the file. Do not talk about this folder with others, including family members.<br />
5. Each map must have a part that can be torn off by the dotted line, and the map must be produced by a specific manufacturer. The manufacturer&#39;s contact information is in the word document in the folder. The office needs to keep at least three maps for use at any time.<br />
6. No matter how frequently the security guards in the Elephant Park resign and how outrageous the requirements are for welfare, treat them kindly and meet their requirements as much as possible. They are not making trouble unreasonably. But it is best not to go into the reasons for their request.<br />
7. When inspecting the work of employees, if you see the employees catching escaped rabbits, retrieving dried jellyfish, or rabbits killed by a white lion, it is normal, and there is no need to blame or ask; but please check that they have indeed handled them properly.<br />
8. The office must keep the lights on before 1:15~6:00 in the morning, even if there is no one. The power supply equipment here is stronger than any park. Power failure is an abnormal phenomenon. If it occurs, immediately tear off the spare map on the right hand side of the desk by the dotted line, and then walk out in your hand. Tell the first employee you meet, no matter what color the other person is wearing or what they are going to do, ask the other person to help you deal with the power outage. He won&#39;t refuse you.<br />
9. Don&#39;t delve into whether the aquarium exists. But if you see the aquarium, you can go in for a walk. Please observe the notice posted at the entrance outside the aquarium, and observe the notice posted inside the aquarium. If there are contradictions in the notice, decide which one to respect based on the position of your body when you see the notice.<br />
10. Only the monkey doll and the white lion doll were placed on the sofa in the office. When the goat/rabbit/big elephant toy appeared, there is no need to work indoors today. Leave until the monitoring room staff informs you that the extra toys are gone.<br />
11. You can take a nap, but if you decide to go to the night shift, no matter what method you use to cheer up, don&#39;t take a nap. If you don&#39;t ensure your mental state, don&#39;t go to night work.<br />
12. The monitor will occasionally be damaged. To determine whether it is normal damage, please check whether there is animal hair on the camera. If so, do not repair the monitor within one month. If necessary, you can prepare a miniature camera to replace it. The Finance Department will reimburse the cost of the camera after the situation is notified.<br />
13. It is normal to see dried jellyfish in the trash can. Just a reminder when the cleaner comes to throw out the trash.<br />
14. If you violate any of the above and spend 13 hours in the office pretending that nothing happened, please order a takeaway meal and contact the staff to bring it in for you. Don’t leave the office, don’t look at the delivery staff and employees, don’t look in the mirror. Always remind yourself that humans have two eyes, and only two eyes.<br />
15. Always remember that the safety of human life is more important than that of animals. Sacrifice any animals if necessary. Don&#39;t be soft-hearted, you don&#39;t know if they are animals.<br />
================================================== ==<br />
The paper left in the guest room on the left side of the jellyfish area in the aquarium has been placed in the locker in the whale area by employees.<br />
(The beginning and the edge of the paper are filled with &quot;I&#39;m afraid&quot;, &quot;I want to go out alive&quot;, &quot;Don&#39;t believe&quot;, &quot;Believe&quot;, &quot;All messed up&quot;, &quot;Must write it down&quot;, and the place where the title should be written is rewritten with aggravated black pen &quot;If you don’t do this, you will never get out.&quot;)<br />
1. Apes and white lions can see &quot;it&quot;, jellyfish and rabbits can comfort &quot;it&quot;, elephants and goats are dolls of &quot;it&quot;<br />
2. Believe in the white lion; the white lion bites the saved, the white lion bites the unsaved, the white lion&#39;s roar is a warning bell to expel &quot;it&quot;, and the white lion&#39;s roar is a lament to mourn the dead<br />
3. Changing clothes will be found, don’t change clothes (scrawled and crazy handwriting notes: unity, courage and unwavering loyalty are the greatest strengths of mankind)<br />
4. The security guards in the elephant area can be trusted, but they will get off work at 1:00 am every day, so ask for help before that<br />
5. &quot;It&quot; likes light, especially at night, &quot;it&quot; hates confined spaces, and you have to rest in a dark confined room<br />
6. Fuck me! Goat meat is really raw meat! (This sentence is more scribbled than the others; there is a slightly less scribbled note at the end: It is fucking edible)<br />
7. You will not be spotted when you stand with apes<br />
8. Humans have two eyes, arranged sideways, on either side of the nose. The rest are not humans. The appearance of human beings has changed, which means that they are being watched by &quot;it&quot;. Remember human beings and don’t believe in human beings that are not humans.<br />
9. Don&#39;t pay attention to the tourists who are on the tour with a smile, they have found nothing. Look for tourists who are as scared as I am, they are trustworthy, they already know<br />
10. Thank you for the dried up jellyfish and the drowned elephant; remember that they all died to protect humans<br />
11. There is an exit, not in the Ape Park, I don’t know what it is to go out of the Ape Park<br />
12. Always remember that you are a human, not an animal</p>
