<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Danielle at some point nodded off, and went she woke up, she felt gassy and bloated.  “Ugh.  I feel terrible.”<br />
<br />
“Aw, did Baby have something a little rich for her tummy tum?”  Gemory teased.<br />
<br />
“I guess I had this coming.  I&#39;m sorry about this.”  Danielle admitted, managing to sit up.  Her stomach felt queasy.<br />
<br />
“Oh you mean for having fun without me, like we agreed?”  Gemory grinned.<br />
<br />
Dani nodded, looking glum.  “It just sort of happened...Toni wanted to give me my punishment, and then it got out of hand.<br />
<br />
She was surprised when Gemory hopped up and gave her a kiss on the cheek.  “All is forgiven, darling.  I mean, I would have liked to be here, but it&#39;s good that you and Toni are getting along.  And there will be other times, I&#39;m sure.”  She put her arms around Dani&#39;s neck.<br />
<br />
“Thank you, love.  Ugh, I might have to throw up.”<br />
<br />
“Oh, here, let me help.  Demon milk is a bit much for you, it seems.”  Gemory put a hand on Danielle&#39;s stomach and a warm sensation spread from it.<br />
<br />
“...not to mention angel and demon cum.”  Danielle added.<br />
<br />
“Oh my, Ami too?”  Gemory shook her head.<br />
<br />
“Where are those two, anyways?”  <br />
<br />
“Oh, once Amielle woke up and was able to grow to her normal size, they went to go swim in the pool.”<br />
<br />
“There&#39;s a pool here?!”  Danielle blinked.<br />
<br />
Gemory laughed.  “I guess you haven&#39;t seen much of the place.  Say, have you talked to your father?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, he was worried, but I told him you took me for a surprise vacation.  I think he misses having me at work, since I&#39;m his best employee, but I bet he misses your cooking more.”<br />
<br />
“We should return home soon.  I&#39;ll have to get the girls their own place- I don&#39;t think Jack would survive having a couple of love freaks around.”<br />
<br />
“Oh man.  I don&#39;t know how I&#39;m going to keep this part of my life separate from the rest.  I hate lying to him, but how can I explain that my fiancee is literally hot as Hell?”<br />
<br />
Gemory gave Danielle a kiss then.  “You really think so?”<br />
<br />
“Duh, I&#39;d have to be blind not to.  Oh and I feel better, thanks.”<br />
<br />
“My pleasure, dearest.  There&#39;s a lot of raw power in the stuff you were consuming, and humans can&#39;t really digest that.  A minor adjustment to your metabolism was required.  The good news is, you&#39;ll burn more of what you eat from here on out, so there&#39;ll be less going to the bathroom.”<br />
<br />
“Oh that sounds amazing.  I guess if I was a full demon I wouldn&#39;t have to at all, huh?”<br />
<br />
“Basically, yes.  Now, the one thing I should mention is, if you keep coming into contact with, ah, shall we say, angelic and infernal essence, it will cause changes.  You&#39;ll become less human over time.”<br />
<br />
“Oh uh.  Do I have to worry about wings, horns, a tail or anything?”  Danielle actually didn&#39;t mind that thought very much.<br />
<br />
“Probably not, but you don&#39;t seem too upset by the possibility.”  Gemory grinned.<br />
<br />
“Well, I mean, wings are cool, and the things Toni can do with her tail...” Danielle shivered.<br />
<br />
“Oh yes, Succubus tails are lovely things.  Well we can get you one if you want, my darling.  Say, what did you three get up to, if you don&#39;t mind my asking?”<br />
<br />
Danielle gave Gemory the play by play, though she did make a face when she explained the part where she pissed in Toni&#39;s mouth.  “Kind of disgusting, isn&#39;t it?”<br />
<br />
“Yes, it is, but that&#39;s Succubi for you.  They have to be able to embrace all manner of perversions in their line of work.  Poor Amielle though!  She had a rough morning!”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, it sure looked like it.  So what did you have to go do, by the way?”<br />
<br />
“Ah, well, since I&#39;m going to be spending a lot of time on Earth, I had to make some arrangements, and talk to my Second-in-Command, Belzazel.” <br />
<br />
“Oh, what&#39;s he like?”<br />
<br />
“She, technically.  Bel is incredibly loyal, I trust her implicitly.”<br />
<br />
“Technically?”  Danielle raised an eyebrow.<br />
<br />
“Oh, her preferred form is a hulking 8&#39; amazon woman with gigantic breasts and a dick to match.  So really she&#39;s a hermaphrodite.  But right now, as punishment, she gets to run my palace and is stuck in her female form.  Which is a lot less impressive, to be honest.”<br />
<br />
“Oh wow.  Demons come in all shapes and sizes, huh?”  Danielle tried to imagine having a penis.<br />
<br />
“You have no idea.  I mean, you saw Francesca, for example.  My harem includes a pair of Dragonets, a few Slime Demon girls, and an Erodaemon.”<br />
<br />
“A what, a what, and a what?”  Dani blinked.<br />
<br />
Gemory laughed again, sitting down in her lovers lap.  “Dragonets are half girl, half Firedrake.  Ah, that doesn&#39;t help much.  So when we got to Hell, we discovered it greatly resembled an earlier version of Earth.  The life forms were more primitive, but used to living in that world.  Demons can&#39;t create life, but we can modify it.  The ancestors of Firedrakes are dinosaur-like reptiles.  We gave them the ability to fly and breathe fire, so they are basically dragons, though not terribly bright.<br />
<br />
A Dragonet, on the other hand, is a pretty girl with dragon wings, scales on parts of her body, horns, long wild hair, and their arms and legs end in clawed talons.”<br />
<br />
“Oh wow.  That sounds neat.  So they can fly and breathe fire?”<br />
<br />
Gemory nodded.  “Slime demons are about what you&#39;d expect.  Their  bodies have no bones or muscle, just a mass of protoplasm.  They can thicken their cell walls to the point they can hold a shape, and can even form organs like eyes, or shape their slime into hairlike strands.  Of course, they can revert any or all of their bodies into so much warm goo.  Sex with a slime demon is an incredible experience.”<br />
<br />
“Goo girls.  Neat.  And Erodaemons?”<br />
<br />
Gemory frowned.  “You know all you need for a Tempter is someone who is good at manipulating others.  A Succubus really just needs a soul that is enthusiastic about sex.  Now some people have both traits in abundance.  In life they used their bodies and sex appeal to further their own ambitions.<br />
<br />
Such individuals are very useful, but also need to be humbled, as they are proud and haughty.  I want to point out I&#39;ve never made one- I acquired Minuet from another Fallen.”  Gemory paused.<br />
<br />
“To create an Erodaemon, you need the souls of two people with those traits.  Male, female, it doesn&#39;t matter.  You meld them together into one body.  I want you to imagine a centaur.  You know, man up top, horse on bottom?  Well an Erodaemon is a woman on top...and bottom.  That is to say, where her waist should be, is instead the headless body of another woman.  The hips melt into the shoulders of the lower body.  So an Erodaemon is forced to crawl around naked on all fours everywhere she goes.”<br />
<br />
Danielle tried to imagine that.  “So they have two minds?”<br />
<br />
“No, the process merges them into a single being with one mind and personality.  There are some variations- some Erodaemons have smaller, almost child-sized upper bodies, and their lower bodies are much larger.  Minuet doesn&#39;t have that luxury, both parts of her body are to scale with one another.<br />
<br />
Obviously, as you might expect, Erodaemons are very strong, but don&#39;t move around very quick.  They exude sex appeal on a level that even a Succubus would be jealous of, and are master manipulators.  Minuet is basically in charge of my harem, keeping the other girls in line.<br />
<br />
I only send her out on special missions.  Personally, I find her talents are better used for organization and diplomacy.”<br />
<br />
“Man.  That&#39;s crazy.  Who dreams up these weird punishments for demons anyways?”<br />
<br />
Gemory laughed.  “Well, we all do, but some are more extreme than others.”<br />
<br />
“I mean, what do you have to do to become a slime?”  Dani shook her head.<br />
<br />
“Ah, well, slimes were very submissive and co-dependent in life.  They existed by latching onto others and making people take care of them.  No matter how pleasant they could be, they were parasites, and that&#39;s how they ended up in Hell.”<br />
<br />
“Huh, that&#39;s wild.  And I bet shapechangers are even wilder.”<br />
<br />
“Some can be, yes.  Though most shapechangers have limitations, there are very few Protean Devils- that is, demons who can assume any form they choose.  You can&#39;t start off as one, you basically have to evolve to that point, and most shapechangers have certain forms they prefer.  A Protean Devil can be anything or anyone, and is always changing.”<br />
<br />
“Speaking of changing, you keep shrinking on me.  Are you going to get as small as Toni?”<br />
<br />
“Oh, don&#39;t you like it?  I thought I was cute.”  Gemory frowned.<br />
<br />
“Oh no, you&#39;re adorable, honey.  I don&#39;t mind.  Heck, Amielle gets a lot of use out of her ability to change size.”<br />
<br />
Gemory smiled.  “Well, I admit, part of it is due to how my feelings are changing.  I find I like being smaller and more...submissive towards you.”<br />
<br />
“And less threatening.”<br />
<br />
“Do I frighten you, my love?”<br />
<br />
“Oh man, do you.  You&#39;re super smart, you know just about everything, and you can do anything it seems!  Even light fires with your eyes!”<br />
<br />
Gemory looked up at her fiancee and pouted.  “I don&#39;t want you to be afraid of me.”<br />
<br />
“I know.” Danielle kissed the smaller girl.  “And I know you won&#39;t hurt me, ever.  But you are frightening, and the one with the real power in our relationship.”<br />
<br />
“Does that bother you, that, we&#39;re not...equal?”  <br />
<br />
“Hey.  No, not at all.  I&#39;m perfectly fine with you being older, more experienced, and stronger than me.”  She rubbed her lover&#39;s arms.  “And I think it&#39;s so sweet that you try so hard to submit to me, when you could snap me in half like a toothpick.”<br />
<br />
Gemory hugged Danielle.  “I don&#39;t deserve you.”<br />
<br />
“I don&#39;t deserve you either, but here we are.”<br />
<br />
“Say, my love, I made up with Raphael.”<br />
<br />
“So you did.  I guess you want me to have boobs again?”  Dani chuckled.  “I have to admit, it&#39;s been liberating not to have them, but I do want to feel like a girl again.  I was wondering, would you mind if I gave myself smaller breasts than before?”<br />
<br />
Gemory thought about that.  “I guess I don&#39;t really mind.  So A cups, then?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, that&#39;s what I was thinking.  Small enough I don&#39;t need to wear a bra, big enough for you to play with.”<br />
<br />
The demoness nodded.  “I accept these terms.”<br />
<br />
Danielle touched her breasts and wished herself to have cute little A cup breasts, nice, perky, and extra sensitive.  “There how about that?”<br />
<br />
Gemory rose up and took a breast in her mouth, sucking on it.<br />
<br />
Danielle gasped.  “Oh...fuck that feels good.”<br />
<br />
Gemory let go and looked up.  “Then carry me to our bedroom, so I can get acquainted with your new breasts better, my love.”<br />
<br />
“Yes Ma&#39;am!”  Danielle got up, scooping up Gemory in her arms, and carried her off.<br />
<br />
The demoness giggled and kicked her legs helplessly as she was being manhandled.</p>
