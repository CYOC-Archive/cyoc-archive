<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Not sure where to begin, Jeff looks through the settings and finds a checked box marked as &quot;condensed mode&quot;. Toggling that off, he discovers that several more options have become available, including a blank text box. <br />
<br />
Starting simple, Jeff goes for the text box and enters in a single change. &quot;Everyone will become the opposite sex from below their waist.&quot; After pressing enter, Jeff suddenly felt a draft and looked down. He tensed up as he found a pair of hairless legs, slightly hidden beneath a short skirt where his normal legs should be. Not only that, but nothing was stopping his legs from being tightly crossing, something most men norally should not be capable of doing, including himself. Plus his chair was notably more comfortable, and upon further inspection, it was his bubble butt ass to thank for that. <br />
<br />
Standing up, Jeff took notice of how his skirt only went down to his mid upper thigh, leaving the rest of his long smooth legs fully exposed. Looking around the room, he found a few new shelves had been installed, each absolutely filled with numerous different styles and sizes of high heels. His underwear drawer was now double the size and was full of panties, stockings, knee socks, pantyhose, and tights. His shorts were significantly smaller, and he had several pairs of skin tight leggings and yoga pants now too. <br />
<br />
There were a few packages of feminine hygiene products too, which reminded him of the situation between his sexyier, thicker thighs. He was curious. Just a quick peak and he would be satisfied for now. <br />
<br />
Just as he was about to pull on his panties, the door flew open. Turning towards it, he watched as in walked his neighbor, Kathleen. She was a year older than he was, significantly more physical too. But they were mote than just friends, after spending last summer together on a trip they had been planning to take. <br />
<br />
Kathleen entered and laid down on the floor. &quot;I&#39;m so fucking bored man&quot; she complained. Jeff took note of how she was wearing boy shorts and was sporting a bit of an impressive bulge... he shook his head. That wasn&#39;t important right now. Absent-mindedly, Jeff put a small bit of distance from Kathleen&#39;s head and made sure she couldn&#39;t see up his skirt. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hahaha, relax man. It&#39;s not like I haven&#39;t seen your pussy before. Or did you forget about that night we spent sharing a sleeping bag?&quot; <br />
<br />
Jeff blushed a little, but he didn&#39;t know what she was talking about. It was true that they went on a trip together last year, but they never shared a sleeping bag... or, did they? The more he pondered it, the more he realized that likely, only he knew anything was different. To everyone else, he had always had a pussy, and Kathleen had always had her impressively long dick. He didn&#39;t delve deeper into finding out how he knew that she had an impressive cock though. He just knew that she was big enough to impress him and that was all.<br />
<br />
With a sigh, Jeff stopped protecting his crotch and took a seat, crossing his legs rather naturally, almost as if he had years and years of practice doing so. He looked down at Kathleen, stealing a glance once again at her crotch, then her chest. His pussy stirred a little, and he could feel the insides start to moisten a little as his nipples hardened against his t-shirt. Why was he getting so damn aroused by her? Clearing his head, Jeff asked Kathleen what it was she wanted him to do about it.<br />
<br />
&quot;I dunno, wanna go out shopping or something?&quot; Suggested Kathleen, moving from sitting on the floor to one of the chairs. Jeff glanced back at the program as he thought it over. But Kathleen didn&#39;t miss that and stood up. &quot;Hey, whatcha doing on there? Watching some porn or something?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;NO! Shouted Jeff in a rather embarrassed manner as he tried closing the program. He couldn&#39;t let her of all people see what he did. He would never hear the end of it if she found out. In his haste however, he had accidently clicked a box labeled &quot;adaptive changes&quot;, enabling it before the program finally shut down. <br />
<br />
Jeff felt a little relieved as Kathleen didn&#39;t make it in time to see what he was up to. She clicked her tongue at missing her chance, then gently pulled him up out of the seat by his arm. Oddly enough, he was pulled by her with ease. Had he always been this weak? It made sense though. He wasn&#39;t exactly the pinnacle of physical fitness, and she did work out almost daily. <br />
<br />
As he was pulled through the house, his little sister walked by, wearing her normal crop-top, but a pair of boy-ish pair of shorts like Kathleen was. With a grin, Kathleen declared jokingly &quot;Hey there Erika. I&#39;m taking my bitch out for a walk. I&#39;ll have him home before it get&#39;s dark.&quot; <br />
<br />
Erika smiled back and smuggly replied &quot;have fun with him, lord knows he could use some fresh air&quot; and left for her own room. Jeff rolled his eyes. The two of them had always been close friends, mainly due to their shared interests and similar personalities. Jeff always was a little intimidated by them, as he was a few inches shorter than Erika, and knew that both girls could easily overpower him if they felt like it. <br />
<br />
He felt a hand grab his ass and heavily blushed as Kathleen gave it a nice squeeze. He didn&#39;t exaxtly dislike the feeling of her doing it though. She pushed him along with her hand groping his ass underneath his short skirt as he stumbled to the door. He saw a pair of cute, strappy, high heeled sandals an put them on his notably smaller feet before he saw how Kathleen looked ready to pick him up and carry him to her car if he didn&#39;t move faster. He grabbed the matching purse which had his ID and money inside, and was princess carried out from his house, having finally depleted all of what little patience Kathleen had left by taking too long. He was embarrassed by how much his pussy was squirming in excitement by witnessing Kathleen&#39;s strength. Plus he could feel her slightly erect cock poking against his left ass cheek as she carried him in her arms.<br />
<br />
Once in the passenger seat, he buckled up, letting the belt pass through the slightly formed valley in his chest before she got in the driver&#39;s seat and took off towards the mall. </p>
