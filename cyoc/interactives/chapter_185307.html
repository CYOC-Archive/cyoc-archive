<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The day had been a quiet one, which was, usually, to Niamh&#39;s preference. Only a few people had come through, and all of them had ended up taking little trinkets of minimal magical potential - odds and ends that&#39;d never do anything dramatic enough to cause a catastrophe or get her in trouble, much to the Irish girl&#39;s great relief. She wasn&#39;t sure if she could endure another round of the entire world getting transformed into mermaids or something - Adie had sworn up and down that it was okay, and that everyone forgave her, but the redhead just wasn&#39;t sure.<br />
<br />
Closing time would be approaching soon, and Adie had left her to man the front of the store, busying herself with working on some fancy amulet in the back rooms. As such, she was alone at the counter when the door burst open to reveal two girls who were... <i>interesting</i>, to put it mildly. One of them looked like every stereotypical dumb blonde cheerleader slut who ever lived, and the other looked like the same thing but half-Chinese... only there was something about her that was odd. Different. Familiar, as if Niamh had seen her before, but she couldn&#39;t quite place it.<br />
<br />
The girl seemed to recognize her, though, as she marched up and addressed the redhead by name. &quot;Oh my god, Niamh, you&#39;re gonna have so much fun with us tonight!&quot; She leaned over and placed a kiss on the confused girl&#39;s hand, before marching right over to the potion aisle like she&#39;d been here before. Her friend, meanwhile, was just oohing and ahhing over the various artifacts on display. &quot;Oh, this is Anna, she&#39;s like, my new super hot bestie! She&#39;s taking me to a party tonight, and once we make you hot, you&#39;re totally gonna come with us and be my super sexy date!&quot;<br />
<br />
Alright, they had her. Niamh had no idea what the fuck was going on. &quot;Do uh... do I know ye, sorry?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course, silly, it&#39;s me! Terri!&quot; She scoffed, rolling her eyes as she marched back up to the counter with a vial of pink liquid in her hand. Niamh started moving to stop her from opening it, but she quickly realized there was no stopping this girl. &quot;Like, I can&#39;t believe you don&#39;t remember me after I saved you from that mean demon guy, but whatever! You&#39;re still, like, gonna be so super - oooooo, I know!&quot; She reached over and yanked at Niamh&#39;s messy hair, plucking a red strand as Niamh yelped in pain. &quot;You&#39;re like, already kind of almost a cool hot girl, so...&quot; She plucked one of her own hairs, then dunked both their hairs inside the bottle, swirling it around and causing some sparks to fly out.<br />
<br />
Before Niamh could insist that she stop or call for Adie, Terri was shoving the potion in her mouth, forcing her to drink the whole thing. Anna spun around, hurrying over and grinning as both blondes waited to see what would happen - and they didn&#39;t have to wait long. Almost instantly, Niamh was left leaning against the counter, her mind thrown for the biggest of loops as she processed what had just happened. She knew that potion - and she kneww damn well that you weren&#39;t supposed to mix in multiple people&#39;s relics. Otherwise, things started to get... a bit unpred... unpre... how.. how was that word... how did you spell it again?<br />
<br />
Oh, why did she even care about how to spell words? It wasn&#39;t like she was here to write good. No, Adie just kept her around to man the counter and look pretty. And she was pretty, but god, she could&#39;ve been so much prettier. Inside her head Niamh wished she could be as hot and pretty as the girls in front of her - and suddenly she felt a rumbling within herself, as the wish started to be granted. A hand reached up to her head, now feeling much, much emptier as it grasped at her thick, curly red hair - very thick, and very red. The color of blood, she realized, and falling all the way down to her chest.<br />
<br />
Her chest. Oh shay begorra her chest was starting to look a lot bigger, and feel a lot bigger - and so good! She moaned without shame as she grabbed both her boobs, squeezing them while they seemed to grow right in her hands! They were ballooning up, finally becoming respectable, even starting to get as big as Terri&#39;s, and soooo sensitive! She wanted to rip her shirt off to squeeze them, but god, it instantly made her wet just having the fabric rub up against her tits, making her nipples so hard that they could&#39;ve cut right through solid steel. Her hips were almost buckling from it, and god knows they were getting wide too, almost too wide for her skirt.<br />
<br />
The poor bra snapped on her, and she quickly pulled off her top so she could get at it and throw it away. That gave the blondes a full view of her skin, all beautiful and tanned now, and just covered in so many freckles! She was the perfectest Irish lass, a bit taller now, all freckled and fire-haired and looking at the girls with the biggest, greenest eyes. &quot;Oh me god, thank ye thank ye thank ye!&quot; She shouted, realizing just how nice Terri had made her feel. &quot;Lucky charms and Dublin whiskey, this is the nicest thing anybody ever did for me!&quot; She leaned in and kissed Terri with her newly-plumped lips, taking a second to smush her boobs against the other girl&#39;s huge rack.<br />
<br />
Anna, meanwhile, was almost drooling. &quot;Like, it made her soooooo hot!&quot; She squealed. &quot;Terriiiiii, we like, totally need to bring more of that stuff to the party! We can make everybody sexy!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh shite, ye&#39;re right!&quot; She glanced over her shoulder. &quot;Auntieeeee! I&#39;m gonna head out!&quot; With that, she bounded right over the counter, her heart-shaped ass swaying as she rushed to grab a whole armful of potions, dumping them into a bag. Beauty potions, plus a whole bunch of other transformation potions - they wouldn&#39;t make people sexy bimbos themselves, but they could do all sorts of cool things! Hefting her haul of vials, the blondes giggled and took each of her arms in one of theirs, the three of them laughing and excited as they headed out of the shop and out to Anna&#39;s car.<br />
________________<br />
After giving Niamh some of her sexy clothes - god they hugged her body so nice! - Terri ended up making out with Niamh most of the way there, having to fight the urge to drag Anna into things too while she was driving. She was soooo jealous, of course, and as soon as they got to the party and parked, Terri pulled Anna right out of the car to spend a minute kissing her, feeling up her huge boobs and her perfect hourglass curves. She only snapped out of trying to pull up the other blonde&#39;s dress when the Irish girl tapped her on the shoulder, reminding her of the party - and taking the opportunity to plant her own kisses on Anna&#39;s thick lips.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ohhhh, how are we gonna, like, give people potions!&quot; Terri asked excitedly as they walked up to the building, a rather large and luxurious home in the best part of town that already had tons of people on the lawn, plus more inside, talking and eating and enjoying the music. They could start just grabbing people and giving them potions, that&#39;d be super easy, but other people might get mad. Oh, they could dump potions in the punch, so everybody started drinking it and didn&#39;t know until they turned super sexy! Oh oh oh, or they could play potion pong, like beer pong, and everybody would totally <i>want</i> to lose so that they could be hot like Anna and Terri and Niamh!</p>
