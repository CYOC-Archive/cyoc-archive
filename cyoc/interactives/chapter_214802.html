<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Is there anything I can do to help with this?&quot; Rachel finished when she was sure that Monique had not left, with one of her feet sliding her shoe on the tiled floor of the bathroom in the college&#39;s English department building.<br />
<br />
All of this had generally come by surprise and something she couldn&#39;t explain. She&#39;d gained control over her transformations, particularly after finding that her mother and sisters wouldn&#39;t turn on her. It was all something that helped her hold things together and got her over inducing a transformation due to stress. And for the most part, being around the other weres on campus hadn&#39;t triggered anything like this, either, though most of them weren&#39;t werecats. She couldn&#39;t tell fully how she knew they weren&#39;t werecats, or what kind of were they were, but it was like there was something in the back of her mind that told her what kind of were some of the students at Moon Lake College were. But now, she&#39;d been sitting near another werecat and apparently her pheromones were enough to get Rachel&#39;s mind to wander and lose some of her control. That lack of control was the biggest thing she feared, partially because it also included the fear of harming her mother or sisters... or becoming like Leslie.<br />
<br />
&quot;You understand how to change and change back, right?&quot; Monique asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just the basics,&quot; Rachel answered as she thought back on what had happened in Florida after Leslie had run off after raping her...<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
The area was soft, and Rachel couldn&#39;t complain on that too much, but she was still trying to process everything that had happened. Leslie had slipped her a Mickey and lead her out here to where she was now. It was only after she had taken on her present form, a werecat based on the Domestic Shorthair with a solid black coat. Rachel&#39;s mind was racing a million miles a minute, particularly as a pair of women from the Cat&#39;s Eye Club made their way closer. All of them were in heals or some other kind of dress shoe, nothing designed to go wandering around palm fronds and where one could wander onto a Coral Snake or Cottonmouth. The bigger thing was that these women smelled sorta like Leslie and herself now... It told Rachel that they were werecats.<br />
<br />
&quot;Miss... Miss, are you okay?&quot; one of them asked to Rachel.<br />
<br />
Rachel only blinked as she was still trying to process all that had happened. She wanted to demand something from Leslie, but Leslie had run off with the club&#39;s bouncer chasing after her. Eventually, Rachel did find her voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;You... you smell like me,&quot; Rachel said slowly, staring back toward the woman, who was joined by another who had moved even more slowly than the first.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes... my girl and I are werecats, like you are now,&quot; the woman answered in a calm voice and looked away in the direction that Leslie had run, &quot;and it would appear that the kitten had plans for you tonight... Did you know she was a werecat?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Werecat?&quot; Rachel asked blankly.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think the girl she was with raped her,&quot; the other woman answered, &quot;she doesn&#39;t know about weres... at least... probably not more than those stupid horror movies. And we really don&#39;t know on what stage of the transformation she&#39;s in... she could be incomplete... particularly how out of it she seemed when the other one took her out of the club.&quot;<br />
<br />
The first woman gave a hissing sigh, showing supreme irritation and then looked back to Rachel.<br />
<br />
&quot;Listen, miss...&quot; the woman began.<br />
<br />
&quot;Rachel, Rachel Covaks,&quot; Rachel managed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Miss Covaks,&quot; that woman began, &quot;it would appear that the girl you came to the club with... that she&#39;s had some sexual plans for you...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Leslie&#39;s wanted to... for a while,&quot; Rachel said quickly, &quot;but between school and my dad being a bit of a homophobe... I was never comfortable with going all the way, at least not yet. Some of the idea of doing it just to stick it to him was there, but not on the night after high school graduation.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The kitten rushed things then,&quot; the second woman commented, practically hissing &quot;kitten&quot; before continuing, &quot;Listen... her games have changed you. You aren&#39;t a normal human anymore, and she never was. You&#39;ve become a werecat. Think like a werewolf, but all werecats are female, and we&#39;re all at least bisexual if not homosexual...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I was already a lesbian,&quot; Rachel answered, her mind still trying to process everything that had happened to her, &quot;but werecats... that can&#39;t be real...&quot;<br />
<br />
The first woman carefully took Rachel&#39;s hand and lifted it up so that Rachel could see it. She saw the five fingers she always had, but they were now covered in a coat of black fur and as the woman&#39;s hand slid under Rachel&#39;s, Rachel also had the sensation of the woman&#39;s skin rubbing over something just beneath her fingers and at the tips of her fingers. It was like Rachel had a hard pad of skin there that had just enough nerve sensations to just touch something, but not enough where it would be troubled by much. After a moment, Rachel watched as the woman then squeezed on the tip of one finger, and to Rachel&#39;s surprise, she felt something sliding forward from the top of that digit and then saw hooked claw extend out through her fur.<br />
<br />
&quot;This should be more than enough to show to you that weres are real,&quot; the first woman said slowly, &quot;we aren&#39;t the mindless monsters that horror movies make us out to be. In many ways... we really aren&#39;t too different from any other person; we can just turn into an anthropomorphic cat at will.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This was against my will!&quot; Rachel answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;We know... your friend raped you,&quot; the second woman said slowly, &quot;you looked really out of it when you left the bar, and the bartender sent the bouncer after you two. We came to help in case something like this happened. Though... our shoes made it hard for him to move as quickly as he could have. We&#39;re sorry for what&#39;s been done to you... and we will make sure your friend is reported to the police for what she&#39;s done. However, for the moment... there is one thing we need to check.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That being?&quot; Rachel asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you feel any need for the girl you were with?&quot; Rachel asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Need? As in?&quot; Rachel inquired.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sex with her,&quot; the second woman commented, &quot;it&#39;s the most common way normal humans become weres. The were has one they love, and can trust with their secret. They then tell them and offer to turn them. They have sex and that starts the transformation and then another round is needed to complete the transformation.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The only thing I need from Leslie is an answer as to WHY she did this to me,&quot; Rachel answered, &quot;anything sexual... that really went away just before you all arrived.&quot;<br />
<br />
The first woman gave a relieved sigh, &quot;so your transformation is complete... again, we&#39;re sorry the kitten got pushy with you and she should know better. That&#39;s ultimately a good thing, and we can get started on helping you change back.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Change back?&quot; Rachel answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; the first woman nodded, &quot;the bouncer will catch your friend and she will be turned over to the police. The club already attracts some bad attention from the governor as it is. The last it needs is a rape going unreported and then exploding out later. And because we weres want to keep our existence secret... even if humans find out about weres in general, we&#39;d want our individual identities hidden. Thus, you will need to return to your human form.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rachel looked down to her paw like hands again, and she could understand that. She&#39;d never had any interest in horror movies before, but as a lesbian, she also knew that she was already someone that a great many people didn&#39;t like and didn&#39;t want to tolerate. Particularly in Florida. Reporting being raped in her present form wouldn&#39;t help.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay...&quot; Rachel said slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Control isn&#39;t too hard,&quot; the second woman encouraged, &quot;but it is something that takes mental focus and control. Think on your human form and above all your desire to be in that form. To have soft pink skin and the sensation of that...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s all?&quot; Rahcel raised an eyebrow.<br />
<br />
&quot;It sounds easier than it is,&quot; the first woman commented with a glance to her partner, &quot;and under the present circumstances... gaining full control may be difficult. But right now, we can only start. Just focus on your desire to be in your human form.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rachel closed her eyes for a moment and clinched her fists, silently wishing to be in her human form. For a moment, though, nothing happened.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t try to force it or rush it,&quot; the second woman told her, &quot;That&#39;s actually something that would lead you away from controlling your new abilities as a werecat. In a way, it&#39;s where you need to be able to remain calm.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rachel sighed and thought heavily on her human form and her desire in that form. She tried not to be panicked, though after what had just happened to her, she had a hard time keeping that completely away from her. But after a few moments, her fur began to recede back inside her skin, her claws began to blunt and flatten out before resting down on the top of her fingers as they returned to being fingernails. Her face flattened a bit as her mouth and nose separated as her muzzle retracted back into a human face and with her teeth flattening as well. There was some sort of crackling as her feet shortened and flattened, her tail withdrew back into her spine, and her ears returned to the sides of her head. The sounds of it told Rachel it should hurt, but it didn&#39;t... or at least not in a way that would be horrible. When Rachel opened her eyes, she found herself looking down to her normal human hands again.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m me again...&quot; Rachel began slowly and wanted to thank the two women only to have Leslie&#39;s voice ring out in the darkness, even if it didn&#39;t seem as dark to Rachel anymore.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let me go you big lug!&quot; Leslie was heard to shout, &quot;she wanted it! Wanted me!&quot;<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;And not much beyond the basics,&quot; Rachel then finished as her mind came back into the present.<br />
<br />
She heard Monique whistle through the bathroom stall door, and that made her blush a little bit under her fur as some other things flashed through her mind.<br />
<br />
&quot;The basics is a good starting point,&quot; Monique sighed, &quot;but only as a STARTING point. Transforming is something we all have control over... but any intense emotion or pressure, be it stress, love, anger, or what probably happened here for you... lust... can trigger that transformation. You take on what is your true form in the hopes of attracting attention...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I...&quot; Rachel began, &quot;I didn&#39;t mean to sexualize you...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, trust me, you didn&#39;t,&quot; Monique answered, &quot;at least not in any way that any were would be turned off by. I mean... we are in control of ourselves, but we do have a much higher libido than the average normal human. And for us werecats, while we aren&#39;t the most &quot;sexual&quot; were... because we&#39;re a mono-gendered were and are all at least bi... running into another werecat can trigger a lot more of that attention in our minds, as most other weres are straight or are bi and have boyfriends. So, you probably caught my scent and instinctively knew I was someone who might be interested. Shoot, some of this could have happened if you were with a female were you knew was a lesbian even if she wasn&#39;t a werecat. And even I can feel that way at times.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rachel only looked down for a moment. Her mind going over the fantasying thoughts of Monique making love to her as she changed. It was something that ashamed her as she realized it, as it made her feel like Leslie, who had wanted her and decided that when Rachel wasn&#39;t going to leap into sex, drugged her to force it on her. She really didn&#39;t want to be like that.<br />
<br />
&quot;And to a degree, other weres can be like that with each other at times,&quot; Monique continued, &quot;partially as sex seems to be pretty popular among all weres... even if it&#39;s only casual.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That... that doesn&#39;t sound like what I was raised on...&quot; Rachel managed.<br />
<br />
&quot;If you&#39;re new to Moon Lake and new to were society, I&#39;m not surprised,&quot; Monique answered, &quot;in pure theory you have control... but there is so much that&#39;s going to be new to you, some things will be a bit of a surprise, and if you were attacked or something else happened in how you became a werecat, that could well mean that you haven&#39;t had the exposure to weres that those of us that have grown up here have. So, we know how to respond to these things better...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But doesn&#39;t... doesn&#39;t that make me like the one that turned me?&quot; Rachel asked, forgetting for the moment that only a few people at the college knew the full story, like Cynthia. Most of the rest knew she was new and a new werecat, and that the circumstances around her transformation weren&#39;t great. But that often-left things vague.<br />
<br />
&quot;If the one who turned you... turned you against your will, no you wouldn&#39;t have to be like HER,&quot; Monique spoke, &quot;but you are a werecat now and everything that you are... will be shaped by that. That includes all the desires any were has, and every werecat in particular. And in this... accept that you are a werecat... meet with the existing prides here in Moon Lake, and in time, your control will improve and being around my pheromones... or those of any other werecat won&#39;t give you any trouble.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rachel was silent on that for a moment, as that was something that she wasn&#39;t sure on. She could accept certain private levels of attraction to Cynthia or Monique, but a lot of that related more to the fact that she&#39;d been a lesbian a lot longer than she&#39;d been a werecat. And memories of what Leslie did was enough to keep her hesitant on some things in that regard.<br />
<br />
&quot;Anyway... I&#39;ll let the professor know that you&#39;re fine and are just going through some... adjustments to being a new were in Moon Lake,&quot; Monique spoke, &quot;that&#39;ll give you time to get yourself under control. Breathe deep and transform back to your human form. In time... you&#39;ll join a pride and they can then help you get better used to things... at least things specific to werecats.&quot;</p>
