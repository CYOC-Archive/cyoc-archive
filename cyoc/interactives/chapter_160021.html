<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">While Arnold slept on the floor, Espinoza came back in. The man wouldn´t wake up to soon, as his food was laced with a sleeping drug. So he would be out for at least an hour. Espinoza smirked when she saw that Arnold already had lost one hand, but he would lose the other really soon. He had fallen asleep within reach of the remaining bowl-half, so Espinoza could simply put his other hand on it. And so she did, pulling his arm out from under him and then drop it so the hand landed on the bowl.<br />
Like with his other hand the bowl wrapped around his hand tightly. While it balled into a fist underneath, thumb tucked neatly inside. A minute later the rubber encasement cracked open and dropped to the side, revealing another paw where Arnold&#39;s hand had been moments before. Like the other it was covered in dark-brown fur, had small claws on the tips at the end oft he shorter former fingers and soft paw pads on the underside.<br />
Espinoza smirked again. Arnold wouldn´t steal anymore, at least not like before without his hands. But she wasn´t finished with him for now, even if the next change would have to wait for him to wake up again. As she could lift the rubber without any consequence she took the four broken of parts of rubber, placed them near Arnold&#39;s bare feet and used the device she had with her on it. The rubber parts melted into a puddle right around Arnold&#39;s feet. Leaving them by millimeters of empty ground. With that Espinoza left the room again, still smirking.<br />
Arnold slept longer than he expected, not that he had any way to know for sure, but his nap seemed longer than he thought it would. It was around two hours after Espinoza left him alone again. When he woke slowly, at first he wasn´t aware of what happened until his muzzle was clear to see. With a yelp of shock he tried to rise up, only for him to notice his former hands position. He looked shocked at it, now both of his hands were useless to him, trapped as paws. When he tried to move his body around to lift it on all fours his toes hit the rubber puddle encircling his feet. Without pause the rubber clung to his toes and encased both of his feet in a few seconds. Arnold looked on horrified when they were encased in a rubber ball, which cracked after a minute. Underneath were paws like around his hands, if a bit more stretched like hind-paws of a dog were. He inspected them after his shock had worn off, finding it just as hard as with his hand before to rotate them, only able to do so with turning the whole leg. They were really similar to his front paws, complete with tiny claws and paw pads, covered by dark brown fur.<br />
Arnold pondered when his other hand had been turned into a paw and where the puddle came from. The remaining bowl was missing, so had he hit it with his hand while he slept? Why hadn´t he woken up? Before his eyes the former encasement melted into a puddle again. „That´s were it came from“ he thought. But why had it been around his feet when the encasement from the first changed hand was near the bowl before?<br />
Without much thinking he crawled around to get a hang on his paws. It was a strange feeling through the paw pads. He stayed clear to the puddle of rubber, not wanting to change more.<br />
When his thoughts went further as he thought more, the speakers in his head got on again.<br />
„A good dog doesn´t think to much, you want to be a good dog, you want to obey, you want to serve. A good dog doesn´t think to much, you want to be a good dog, you want to obey, you want to serve. A good dog doesn´t think to much, you want to be a good dog, you want to obey, you want to serve.“<br />
With a yelp Arnold jumped as he had not expected them to go off. And just his luck, lands in the rubber puddle with his knees and elbows as he tried to stabilize his landing mid-jump. Without mercy the rubber encased both of his arms and legs, forcing Arnold to stretch them straight. This way his ass was pointed up, raised higher then his head as he was trying to block the message, without much use. When his arms and legs were completely encased he felt a pressure on them, as the rubber pressed them into shape. His ass slowly lowered as his legs grew shorter until they were the same length than his arms.<br />
When the encasement cracked and dropped away Arnold looked down at his now front-legs, whining loudly. That got only worse for him the more he changed. The only thing positive was he wasn´t forced to crawl anymore, not that he thought so with the speakers still penetrating his hearing and therefore slowly his mind.<br />
Arnold&#39;s new legs were covered in light-brown fur and were forcing him to stay down on all fours.<br />
The message went on for two hours, more and more breaking any clear thought Arnold could get down to simpler things. That, together with raising his thoughts of obeying his master or mistress. Before Arnold would fight thinking such nonsense, but the longer the message repeated that he wanted to obey as a good dog the more it cemented in his mind as the truth.<br />
He already felt a strong need to obey and serve. When the message finally stopped Arnold was laying on the cold floor. He still had a small bit of hope that he could escape somehow, but any plans he had tried to make before were now in pieces. His though patterns were simpler than before, not that he really noticed his losses of to complex thoughts.<br />
When Espinoza finally returned Arnold looked up at her and growled. Even with his need to obey that didn´t mean he wouldn´t show his anger towards her. Espinoza smirked as Arnold yelped when the speaker went on again. Unbeknownst to him she could activate them and the message would be generated by his behavior.<br />
„A good dog doesn´t growl at his masters, you want to be a good dog, you want to obey, you want to serve. A good dog doesn´t growl at his masters, you want to be a good dog, you want to obey, you want to serve. A good dog doesn´t growl at his masters, you want to be a good dog, you want to obey, you want to serve.“<br />
Arnold yowled at the new assault, ignoring or forgetting Espinoza was still in the room.</p>
