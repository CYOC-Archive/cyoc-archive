<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I had always loved stories about mind controlling people into different sexuality or gender identity.  I decided that would be really fun to do with the ring.<br />
<br />
As I walked home, I passed a park.  There were lots of people there so I stopped to look around and change whatever I felt like changing.<br />
<br />
I saw two women jogging together.  One was running in a pink sports top and leggings, and the other was wearing lime green.  I wished that they would go jogging together every day and would gradually fall in love with each other.  They would jog to a secluded area of the park and let their love slowly bloom, eventually leaving their husbands and children to pursue a relationship together.<br />
<br />
I saw 3 jocks trying to hit on some girls who were sitting on a bench studying.  I picked two of the jocks and wished that they would fall in flamboyantly gay love for each other.  <br />
<br />
I wished that they liked sucking each other&#39;s cocks and swallowing all of the cum.  I wished that they liked sucking cock so much that they would fight over who got to do the sucking when having sex, and that they would bond over finding gay men with enormous cocks they could share.  I wished that these men would prefer engaging in sexual exploits in public and putting on a show for others but that no one would find this to be a problem and some people would even enjoy watching.<br />
<br />
As for the 3rd jock, I wished that the smallest of the 3 girls they were previously hitting on would grow an enormous 12 inch cock but otherwise remain unchanged.  I wished that the 3rd jock would be a slave to that girl&#39;s cock, and she would be happy to keep him as her cock slave.<br />
<br />
I looked at the middle girl, who was now next to her friend receiving a blowjob on her massive cock.  I wished that middle girl would gain new knowledge not by studying, but by masturbating instead.  If she rubbed herself and use dildos and vibrators on herself and made herself orgasm she would gain knowledge for her classes in the same way that studying does for normal people.<br />
<br />
The third girl was largely ignored by the jocks because she was somewhat fat, though in my opinion even though she was overweight she still had pleasing curves.  I wished that this girl was a secret dominatrix to her professor, who would give her a high grade as long as she dominated him, especially with spankings. and piercing his ass with a giant strap-on.<br />
<br />
I could see the two jogging women on their way down the path toward some trees.  The two newly gay jocks started flirting with each other and walking away from the bench.  The third jock waited there, looking at the girl who&#39;s dress now showed a big bulge in the crotch area.  She looked up, said something to him, then went back to studying.  He immediately dropped to the ground and began licking and kissing her high heeled shoes.<br />
<br />
The larger girl got up and walked away.  The other girl reached into her purse and pulled out a dildo.  She slid it under her dress and as she began to work it a look of bliss came over her face, as she continued reading her textbook.<br />
<br />
I was happy, but not done yet.<br />
<br />
I saw a business man walking by on the sidewalk.  I wished that he was wearing panties.  I then wished that he loved cross-dressing but was too scared to while in public.  At home he would wear only women&#39;s clothes and his wife would love it and support him.  She would have him dress as a French maid and clean the house for her and serve her in other ways as well.  <br />
<br />
I saw him quicken his pace and he had a happy look on his face.<br />
<br />
I saw a man and woman couple watching their young 7-year-old daughter playing on the big play-set in the sandbox.  I wished that the father wished to be a little girl like his daughter.  I wished that he had discussed this with his wife and daughter and that they supported him and wanted this for him so he could be happy.<br />
<br />
He reached into a duffle bag they had brought with them and pulled some things out.  Then he headed for the park restroom.  A few moments later he came out wearing a purple shirt with a princess on it with sparkles and sequins, a turquoise ruffle skirt that came down to his knees, and (though you couldn&#39;t see it right away) pink little girls&#39; panties.  He also had on a purple headband, though he didn&#39;t need it yet, and small sparkly earring studs.<br />
<br />
He went into the sandbox and onto the play-set and began playing with the other children, especially his daughter, who started referring to him as her sister.  <br />
<br />
Some of the other parents started to grumble about a grown man playing with their kids and how inappropriate it was.  I wished first that the dad/little-girl would never be inappropriate towards other children.  Then I wished that anyone who started to think his new lifestyle was inappropriate would change their mind and be supportive of him.  The grumbling parents started talking about how nice it was that this dad could live his dream of being a little girl.<br />
<br />
Some time had passed, so I decided that was enough for now.  I started to head home.  I wanted to get back to Tabitha.  I wondered what was in store for me next.</p>
