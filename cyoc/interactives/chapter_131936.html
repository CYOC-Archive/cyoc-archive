<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Marcus didn&#39;t like the overall situation one bit. He had no real idea where Albert was, particularly in the sense that they had agreed to keep in contact with each other as they proceeded to drive around Washington State to locate the Charleston family. He&#39;d tried to call his older brother, but had only been able to leave a message on his phone. He had gotten in touch with Vito, who had apparently found a &quot;comfy&quot; spot in a bar in Morton, which was to the northwest of Mount St. Helens, but beyond getting possible &quot;local&quot; help in the search for the Charlestons, Marcus didn&#39;t think Vito had found much. The rest of what he&#39;d run into only made things worse in the sense of spotting a Federal Agent walking along one of the trails near Mount Saint Helens.<br />
<br />
Marcus could tell if the guy was FBI or some other Federal Law Enforcement agency, but he recognized the suit and the way the man carried himself as he walked. There weren&#39;t too many kinds of people that carried themselves that way, though none of them were really the sort that Marcus really wanted to get involved with. One was another mobster, which could be hazardous, or at least potentially so, as so many mob groups had often had certain agreements to respect other&#39;s turf and territory, and the Gambonis had their territory in the New York area and primarily in Brooklyn, but the chase to find Karen Charleston had been a lengthy one and gone over various parts of the country that was often difficult as it took them beyond their turf.<br />
<br />
Street gangs could always be bought out and other mob groups could be negotiated with, but Marcus knew that most street gangs weren&#39;t much more than small time thugs that were usually pretty easy to turn by the police. Those that weren&#39;t easy to turn were often big enough to have the potential to threaten actual violence against the Gambonis, which wouldn&#39;t be great either. Sure, they could retaliate and probably outsmart a street gang, but a turf war with a group of thugs looking to sell meth off street corners wasn&#39;t worth the effort. Especially as the further the Charlestons fled from Brooklyn, the less likely the Gambonis would stay in the new location once Karen Charleston was found and &quot;freed.&quot; Other mob families could be negotiated with, but they could be suspicious and it often took time to assure them that the Gambonis had no intention of staying in any one area, and it was really these sorts of things that had often kept them behind the Charlestons.<br />
<br />
And the fact that Marcus thought he saw a gun strapped to the man&#39;s chest, he figured that if this guy in the suit was another mobster, he WASN&#39;T there to negotiate, which would make discretion the better part of valor in that case. And that was assuming the guy was a mobster. The guy could also be FBI or a Federal Marshall or something like that, which might well have some trumped up charge on him to arrest him on, and beating the charges would take time, so for the moment if that was the case, it was best to avoid contact. The last possibility was that this guy was the spy type... CIA or KGB or some other intelligence agency, and they often operated in ways that Marcus understood, but Marcus also knew that if this guy was CIA and had something on him, there was the potential that he&#39;d end up shot and dumped somewhere, the way the courts worked be damned, which made avoiding him all the more important.<br />
<br />
Especially as things around Mount St. Helens had seemed so quiet. It was largely a National Park with few people living close to it, likely a result of the 1980 eruption, but it was in a sense too quiet and the frustrations of chasing the Charleston family around the country had been trying. Negotiations with other mob groups often took time and allowed the Charlestons to escape before they could close the net, as had keeping their lawyers on speed dial to keep law enforcement delayed or at arms length, which in some sense seemed to get harder and harder as the chase continued, likely because the Charlestons had continually told local police units all sorts of stories about the Gambonis being criminals and Marcus found that his pursuit of his &quot;beloved&quot; was often derailed by these sorts of things, but he wouldn&#39;t give in. He would find Karen Charleston and claim her and while he liked the pizzas that Moe Charleston cooked, some lesson would have to be taught to Karen NOT to run but to OBEY Marcus, as any good woman should.<br />
<br />
However, the search hadn&#39;t gone well. Albert had lost touch with the bug on Moe&#39;s phone which made pinpointing where the Charlestons were all the more difficult and they&#39;d split up to try and find what was blocking that signal and find a way around it, which would restore the connection and enable them to track the Charlestons down again. It was a trying process, but one that Marcus wouldn&#39;t give up on. After all, Karen seemed fairly pretty and also the sort that could run the &quot;legal&quot; side of the business that the Gambonis often depended on to keep conversations of what they planned to do from making the news or that crimes committed wouldn&#39;t come back to the, and Marcus figured he could win Karen over one way or another. Love was great, as his father and mother had loved one another, but the important thing was to keep the organization running which would rely more on a way of thinking than anything else... And Marcus figured that in time Karen would come to love him.<br />
<br />
But they had to FIND her first, and at present that was becoming difficult. In that they&#39;d gotten no leads, which frustrated Marcus as he tried to find out what was doing the most to block the signals they&#39;d been using to track the Charlestons and lead to him taking out a park ranger that had caught up to him and said something that he didn&#39;t expect. The shot killed the ranger and Marcus left, but as he&#39;d reached his car is when he saw the guy in the suit, and that had sent him &quot;running&quot; to get away for the moment. There were a few other visitors to the park, so Marcus figured that there would be no clear way to prove that he had been the one to kill the park ranger so long as the murder weapon wasn&#39;t found, but that would only mean more work done later. There were other visitors, but most of them appeared to be old families, which could well lead to enough suspicion that law enforcement might come after him on principle, and then they could find the gun that would only confirm what Marcus had done.<br />
<br />
He now needed to not only find Karen Charleston and kill her parents, but also find Albert, collect Vito, and dispose of the gun in a way that no one would know where it was or who had even used it. It was frustrating and would take time before he could get the Gambonis back to safer territory, but Marcus couldn&#39;t give up until he&#39;d gotten what he&#39;d been searching for and that was his bride. He knew it would be tough and might even require new planning, but if that was what it took, then that is what it would take.</p>
