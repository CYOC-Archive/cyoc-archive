<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Ah, you are finished dressing. Now let´s get some ground rules settled for you. First, beside the already given speaking rules of being respectful and truthful you are unable to talk about the phone. That includes changes made with it, so you can´t say anything about not being my slave before as anyone will see it as you have always been. Not that you could say much, because as soon as I can I will alter reality and erase your friends and you won´t remember them anymore, at least Michael and Patrick as they are now my sneakers and will be nothing else anymore in an hour. Second, you can´t take this phone in your hands, and the only exception is if I ask you to get the phone for me, but you will be unable to use that phone in any way. Third, you are unable to hurt me or damage anything that belongs to me. Forth, you are unable to remove your suit on your own, you will always wear it. And last for now, as you are my slave you can´t harm yourself and can´t run away from me. But you are allowed to move again on your own.”<br />
<br />
Shannon laughed as Jeremy fell down to the ground after his frozen body regained free movement again. He struggled a bit to get up again but was finally able to stand by his bed again. “What now, master?” he asked before looking horrified for calling Shannon that. Shannon himself laughed a bit more before replying: “Okay, I forgot a ground rule for you. You will always look happy and satisfied with your new role, but you won´t call me your master if we are not alone. Any other questions to your situation?” <br />
Jeremy started to smile at him, but he could see it didn´t reach his eyes, but that way he could see the torture in his brother. Only one other question came up from Jeremy: “If I can´t remove the suit, how do I get to the toilet, master?” That was easy to answer: “There should be a zipper hidden by your ass so you can open it wide enough to use the toilet. And before you ask, you won´t need to shower your body as your suit will keep you clean, you only wash your hair and face. Something other?” <br />
Jeremy was disgusted by that and so was Chris, but both couldn´t do anything. After thinking shortly Jeremy shook his had no for remaining questions. <br />
“Okay, then now to your first tasks. First you turn off that game and the tv, as you won´t continue to play it for now. Then you hand me the sneakers over. Afterwards you can go buy some dog food for Brenda, I´m sure she will be hungry later and I forgot to get some new for her beside some small treats. When you are back you will start cleaning your room, as a servant your room should be spotless and organized. You can even start sorting out your clothes to be donated as you won´t need them anymore. If you need another set of clothes I can just change the look of your working clothes on you. When finished I can give you something new to do, so come to me then.” <br />
Smiling, Jeremy turned the game off before giving the sneakers to his brother. He heard his friends scream at him, but could do nothing for them. “Any specifics on the dog food, master?” “No, not for now. Brenda has eaten any food I gave her, so you can choose.” <br />
While Jeremy nodded and then left to buy the food, Shannon moved back to his room, sneakers in hand, enjoying their complains to him. In his room he again looked at the phone to alter reality. The world beside him would forget about the older man he encountered on his walk, as well as Michael, Patrick and Chris completely. Only Jeremy would remember Chris for now, if he erased him later he could change that too. Then he altered it so that everyone thought Jeremy did everything that Shannon ordered out in his own free will and calling him his slave was more a joke to anyone hearing it. As long as Jeremy couldn´t tell otherwise he was safe that way. <br />
Satisfied Shannon looked at the remaining timers. He put the ones for the treats away as they have finished, not wanting them gone for now. The older man would need half an hour still while Patrick and Michael would need fifty minutes. Chris timer was also placed away, for now he wouldn´t erase him to further torture Jeremy. He then put the phone on his desk before laying down on his bed, still fully clothed and quickly drowsed off.<br />
<br />
He didn´t hear Jeremy returning, putting the dog food in the kitchen before starting with his room while still trying to fight against Shannons orders. Nobody had said anything to him or about his outfit and he didn´t even know he had forgotten his two best friends already. Chris screamed at him to fight, but Jeremy couldn´t talk with him to say that he tried.<br />
<br />
Shannon woke up when his phone beeped the second time. He hadn´t heard it for the older man, but now Michael and Patrick were ready. He erased only the man as he wanted to grind the other to in the dirt on his next walk with Brenda. Which soon came up as Brenda had drunk a bit much water while he dealt with his brother. “You need a go again, girl?” He slipped into his new sneakers before fastening the leach on Brenda and moving out, seeing Jeremy work in his room on the way. Like Carlo had done before both his sneakers were really noisy, even when not knowing Shannon could hear their screams. They screamed in pain whenever he made a step, pushing his weight in them. When Brenda finally took a piss he enjoyed to step into the puddle, making them gag even more as from his feet in them. When he found a pile of dog shit on his way back he jumped at the opportunity to torture them further. But all good things must end, so after grinding them in the dog shit and some more dirt he only said: “Now I had enough fun torturing you both. As fun as it is, your screams are annoying, so bye to you, Michael and Patrick.” And while they were still registering he had heard them the whole time he erased them, and cleaned his sneakers with the phone and returned home in peace.</p>
