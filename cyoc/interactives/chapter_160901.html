<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><br />
Anna and Greg woke up to wet diapers, they felt cold and damp in their sleeper pajamas. They shrugged it off and continued sucking their pacifiers that stayed in their mouths overnight. <br />
<br />
Suddenly, their mother came in and changed them out of their wet diapers and PJs, then she took them in the kitchen each with a new, fresh diaper. She fed them mushed bananas for breakfast and then took them back to the nursery. When she got there, she set them down and went to go retrieve some clothes for them to wear for the day. While she was out, Anna and Greg had a small discussion:<br />
<br />
&#39;Wah nah?&#39; said Greg. Anna looked confused. &#39;Thood we be biggoo aggeh?!&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;No&#39; said Anna, &#39;I doh wanah!&#39; She crossed her arms over like a pouty child. Greg thought it was quite cute.<br />
<br />
&#39;Buh wah abow Fweh an&#39; Dim?!&#39; said Greg, &#39;We hafa geh dem bag!&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Ow?!&#39; asked Anna. &#39;We widdoo!&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;We gah-ah geh owdah!&#39; said Greg. <br />
<br />
&#39;Buh, I wike be-uhn widdoo!&#39; said Anna. &#39;I wike my dibees! I wike my geeko doo!&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Geeko?&#39; questioned Greg. <br />
<br />
&#39;Geeko Weeko!&#39; exclaimed Anna, pointing at the jar of pacifiers on the changing table. Greg looked and saw what she was pointing at. He looked like he understood now. <br />
<br />
&#39;Oh pathifwie-uhs!&#39; said Greg. Anna tried to explain that she would call her pacifiers &#39;geekos&#39; when she was a baby. Every time she wanted it, she would say &#39;Geeko Weeko!&#39; and one of her parents would come swooping in ready with a pacifier in hand for her to nurse on. Greg thought it sounded babyish, but then again, he was now a baby again. <br />
<br />
&#39;Ok, buh we nee-doo geh owduh soo.&#39; said Greg. <br />
<br />
&#39;Dis many dayths?! said Anna, holding up a 7.<br />
<br />
Greg thought carefully about the idea of spending an entire week as a baby but he finally nodded in agreement. <br />
<br />
&#39;Yaaaaaaaay!&#39; said Anna enthusiastically. She enjoyed being this little again and escaping the stress of regular life. She wanted to cherish as much of this as she could. <br />
<br />
Their mother came back in with clothes for them to wear that day. She dressed them in toddler clothes, then took them out to the minivan. Once she got there and buckled them into their car seats, she explained what was going on, &#39;Are you excited to go to the daycare!?&#39; she said in a manner to get the kids excited. <br />
<br />
&#39;YAAAAAAAY!&#39; both of them shouted. <br />
<br />
She pulled out a pacifier for each of them and placed each one into their mouths. They started sucking eagerly in excitement to the day ahead. <br />
<br />
&#39;Momma will be right back!&#39; she said as she went inside to get the diaper bag and double stroller for them. <br />
<br />
When she went inside, the babies looked at each other while smiling behind their pacifiers. Anna took this opportunity to have a little fun with Greg, &#39;GEEGO WEEGO!&#39; shouted Anna, her pacifier shield bobbing around her mouth while she was shouting her childhood phrase. Greg broke into a hysterical laughter, pacifier falling out of his mouth while he was laughing so hard. <br />
<br />
Anna looked back at Greg laughing and suddenly found that she was staring at him. She really loved him even as a baby. She found herself sucking a little bit harder on her pacifier as she continued to stare at him. <br />
<br />
Greg picked up his pacifier that fell in his lap and put it back in his mouth, honing back into his rhythm of sucking before it fell out of hIs mouth. He looked over at Anna and saw her staring at him while curiously sucking on her pacifier. He raised his eyebrow, then waved a hand at her as if to snap her out of her thoughts. She snapped out of her trance and quickly turned away, blushing while doing so. Greg could tell she was blushing and giggled behind his pacifier. <br />
<br />
Their mother arrived back at the minivan and packed the diaper bag and some supplies. She then went to the driver&#39;s seat and sat inside, starting up the vehicle. She turned around and looked at her babies, &#39;ready to go?!&#39; she asked. <br />
<br />
They both nodded excitingly. They were really cute babies. She chuckled, &#39;all right then let&#39;s go!&#39;<br />
<br />
They made their way to the park. <br />
<br />
On the way there, Anna looked out the window and was surprised at how big everything seemed to be. She felt a little intimidated at some of the big things she saw passing by, luckily for her the pacifier in her mouth kept her calm and content, sucking steadily with each passing moment on the way to the park. She became bored on the way over there, feeling annoyed that she was buckled in her seat with nothing to do. She started playing with the handle of her pacifier, trying so desperately to keep herself occupied, until she just gave up and relaxed into the car seat, sucking her pacifier at a more steady rhythm. <br />
<br />
Greg on the other hand, seemed to relax a bit more as he took in the surrounding environments on the way to the park. His pacifier kept him concentrated on the things outside as he observed them, sucking at his own rhythm to keep himself focused on his surroundings. <br />
<br />
They were both just anxious to get there and enjoy the day.<br />
<br />
After a while, they finally arrive at Happy Trails Daycare<br />
Mom parks the car and picks up both babies. She then carries them inside the daycare and one of the employees meets them.<br />
&#39;Welcome to Happy Trails Daycare! You must be Sarah Wright and this must be your little ones, right?&#39; the employee said.<br />
&#39;Yep, that&#39;s us!&#39; Sarah replied. <br />
&#39;Okay, and how old they are?&#39; the employee replied<br />
&#39;They&#39; re both 18 months old&#39; Sarah replied. <br />
&#39;Really!? Awww. Aren&#39;t they just so cute.&#39; the employee replied<br />
By the way, I brought some diapers and supplies for each of them.&#39; Sarah replied<br />
&#39;Oh fantastic!&#39; the employee said, taking the bag and handing it off to another employee.<br />
<br />
The employee takes Anna and Greg and their mother kisses them on the cheek before leaving the daycare.<br />
&#39;Come on little one. We are going to have a super fun day today. &#39;<br />
The young employee takes Anna and Greg to one of the baby rooms.<br />
Then place the two babies in the play area.<br />
&#39;Now be good babies for Belinda. Call me if you need me.&#39; the employee told them.<br />
<br />
When the employee finally left the room, Anna and Greg began to look around the play area. There were a lot of fun baby toys that they didn&#39;t know where to start.</p>
