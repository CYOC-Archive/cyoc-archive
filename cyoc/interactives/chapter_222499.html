<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Drake followed Alan to class. One of the things he always loved about the guy was how studious he was and was constantly looking out for Drake. If not for Alan, Drake would have been skipping a lot more. However, even though Alan was now 6&#39;4&quot; and built like a truck, no one seemed to treat him any differently. His nosy, nerdy personality seemed to still seemed to put a lot of people off.<br />
<br />
Drake and Alan took seats towards the back of the classroom as it was about to start. Drake leaned over to his best friend. &quot;Hey, could I have my lamp back for just a minute?&quot; he asked. Even if he trusted Alan completely, something in the back of his mind kept telling him that he should have it back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh?&quot; a devilish smirk filled Alan&#39;s face. &quot;You want to make a wish?&quot; His voice cut out, but Drake couldn&#39;t help but feel like he saw Alan say something. The feeling quickly passed. &quot;How about I guess what you want to wish for? If I get it right, I&#39;ll just make it for you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ehh...&quot; Drake was about to protest. That wasn&#39;t what he wanted, he wanted the lamp back. Then he could wish that Alan forgot about the whole thing, but then Zack walked in. Drake&#39;s stomach twisted in knots as an instant boner formed in his shorts. He desperately tried to hide it as the huge linebacker took his seat on the other side of the classroom. However, the more he tried to massage it down, the worse it felt.<br />
<br />
All his life, Drake considered himself to be straight, but the moment that he saw that 6&#39;7&quot; 300 pound wall of muscle and meat walk in front of him, he couldn&#39;t look away. His mind drifted off and all sorts of images he&#39;d always mocked others online for having were slamming into his brain. Even just those imaginations were better than anything he&#39;d seen with a woman. <br />
<br />
&quot;You want Zack to suck you off? Don&#39;t you?&quot; Alan teased.<br />
<br />
Drake&#39;s body seized. He gripped his desk tightly as he tried not to finish in his pants again. The smell would linger through class and he didn&#39;t want to have to deal with that again. However, a nod still escaped him. He couldn&#39;t deny it. Having that giant of a man come over to him, get on his knees, pull down Drake&#39;s shorts and then suck off Drake&#39;s cock was one of his favorite fantasies.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry bud. I got you,&quot; Alan said as he rubbed the lamp.<br />
<br />
Drake didn&#39;t understand what Alan meant. Especially as Zack got up from his desk. He&#39;d clearly just gone over there to set down his stuff before coming over for their session. &quot;You ready?&quot; Zack asked. His tone was harsh, but it was obvious that he loved it. He wouldn&#39;t be doing it every chance he could if he didn&#39;t. Sometimes even coming over on days they didn&#39;t have class together just to do it. <br />
<br />
&quot;Y-yeah!&quot; Drake smiled innocently. He&#39;d still get a bit red in the face from the situation. That only seemed to make it all the more fun. Even though people were shuffling into the class room, no one seemed to pay it any mind. <br />
<br />
&quot;Good,&quot; Zack grunted as he rubbed his own tiny boner. Drake had only seen the inch and a half rod a could of times, but figured it was just out of embarrassment from how small it looked next to his monstrously large cock. Women had complained it was too big. That&#39;s why Drake was so surprised the first time Zack was able to deep throat it. Barely even a gag came out of the man as Drake&#39;s cock slid effortlessly to the back of his throat.<br />
<br />
The feeling was amazing. Every time Zack sucked Drake off, it felt like the first time all over. Drake would squirm in his seat. His small body gripped onto the desk or chair or even Zack to hold onto the feeling as long as he could. His small body would flex and writhe under the pressure of the other man. Each lick or twist of the tongue around his cock sent Drake for a loop. Drake couldn&#39;t hold on. The stimulation was too much. He finished, thrusting his hips into Zack&#39;s mouth, fucking it.<br />
<br />
Zack clawed at the floor as his mouth was flooded with cum. He did his best to swallow it all, but a bit dripped out of his mouth, onto his ginger beard. He stood up and wiped it away with his fist before giving the extra a lick on his hand. However, his attention turned to Alan. &quot;What?&quot; he said in his standard gruff, standoffish voice. They weren&#39;t friends. Never had been.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nothing!&quot; Alan smiled. There was clearly something behind it, but Zack didn&#39;t dig into it. He went back to his desk.<br />
<br />
Drake looked at Alan skeptically. &quot;Did you wish for something?&quot; he asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you think?&quot; Alan smirked.<br />
<br />
Drake felt his stomach turn in knots. He couldn&#39;t help but feel as though the answer was yes, but didn&#39;t know why.</p>
