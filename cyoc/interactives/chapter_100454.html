<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Torturous&quot;, Lindsey finished. &quot;Knowing you, it&#39;s probably the mildest of any of these options&quot;. I giggle to myself, &quot;In that, you are wrong&quot; and flick the wand at her. She shrieks as she shrinks quickly, clothes and all, ending at a size a little smaller than a barbie.<br />
<br />
I grin and approach her bed, shying away from my giant form, she stumbles backwards trying to escape as my hand reaches down. She fails of course, it takes barely a second for me to grasp her in my hand as she struggles, crying out for mercy. I wait until she calms down, sniffling, before talking to her again, &quot;Before I begin your torture, I&#39;m going to tell you a little about your situation.&quot; She immediately turns to me like I knew she would. She&#39;s a reasonable person, she knows when she&#39;s beat, and she knows that information might make things easier for her. &quot;That&#39;s a good girl.&quot; I coo towards her. &quot;As you can see, I shrunk you. I did a few other things too. The main one is that while you&#39;ll still feel pain the same as before, your body will heal from any permanent or fatal injuries immediately. Effectively, you&#39;re invincible, but you still feel pain, understand?&quot; She nods dumbly and I smile maliciously, &quot;Think of it this way, at least on this one, once the punishment is done, it&#39;s finished. That wasn&#39;t the same on some of the others.&quot; Fearing I had given her too much hope, I append, &quot;Of course, the torturous punishment I have planned lasts pretty long.&quot; She visibly gulps and I grin in response.<br />
<br />
Deciding I had dallied long enough, I grab her leg between my fingers and swing her upside down. She yelps as I do that, and I take a second to embarrass her, rubbing my finger between her legs. As she reaches up in a helpless attempt to fight off my finger, I pin her arms together for a brief moment, then rip her shirt off, she reaches to cover her chest, still covered by her bra, and I quickly take advantage of this to slip off her sweat pants. I then toss her lightly back onto her bed. Clad in only her underwear, she cowers nervously before me, unsure how to hold her hands to best cover herself. I soon solve the problem for her by once again pinning her hands, this time to her bed. I prod her panties, enjoying the anxious look on her face at the clear knowledge that I&#39;ll soon see under them. &quot;Please don&#39;t do this,&quot; she whimpers, but I merely grin and move on to her chest. I carefully, slowly, remove my Ex&#39;s bra as she mewls in fear. I poke her newly exposed breasts around for a few seconds before quickly turning her upside down and stripping her of her last article of clothes. That done, I toss her onto her desk beside the bed and watch as she tumbles to a stop.<br />
<br />
Tentatively, Lindsey gets up, covering herself in the process under my watchful gaze. I walk over and flick her on the butt to get her out of the way, then I grab a pencil and some glue. After sharpening the pencil, I lather the glue in a pile in the middle of the desk and stick the pencil eraser first into it. I use the wand to speed up the drying of the glue as I hold then pencil in place with one hand. Storing the wand in my pocket, I use the other hand to flick Lindsey around some more and just otherwise feel her up. I wiggle the pencil slightly and, feeling that the glue finished drying, let go of it and take one last look at Lindsey as she takes a momentary breather. I feel a moment of pity for the sobbing figure before me, not just at the trials she just endured, but also what is to come. Regardless though, I&#39;m committed. You must understand, now I have to do it, I don&#39;t have a choice! I know in my heart though, that after this is all done, I&#39;m probably going to love and care for her like I would to my own dog!<br />
<br />
I snap myself out of that mindset though, while those thoughts may be productive later, right now they get in the way of what has to be done. I grab Lindsey gently, spilling her into my palm as she curls into the fetal position. I tilt her upside down and flatten her out with my fingers before grabbing the glue bottle. Angling it into her pussy, I squeeze the bottle gently. Her eyes go wide as she feels the white liquid enter her and realizes what&#39;s happening, but her struggles are for naught. Clearing the excess off of her skin, I carefully position her over the sharpened pencil and lower her slowly. Her struggles only increase as the pencil enters her, expanding her vagina beyond what should be possible. Her cries of pain are easily audible, a feat at her size. With one last push, her legs separate unnaturally and I let go. Despite her struggles, her legs can&#39;t even touch the pencil any more. I grab a tissue and carefully dab the remnants of the glue squeezed out of the orifice away, holding her in place. The glue dries quickly due to my earlier wish, and I release her to view my masterpiece. It&#39;s really a work of art if I do say so myself. Her body is held aloft by a thin pillar, her body the cornerstone of the piece. Best of all, the look of pure agony on her face, sating my desire for revenge.<br />
<br />
I watch her squirming form, entranced at the majesty of it, the justice of the piece, through it, I have a strike of inspiration and I quickly extract the wand. I wish to know just how much pain, how much delightful agony, Lindsey is experiencing. Realizing how the wand might interpret this, I quickly append that whatever the wand does should only last for a second or two. I&#39;m instantly transported into her body, my mind joins with hers, and I can only think of one thing: pain. It encompasses everything, it is all I can comprehend. Just as quickly as it happened, it ends and I&#39;m left to catch my breath. The sheer extent of her pain is amazing, despite it all though, a frown deepens on my face. She&#39;s not even aware why she&#39;s being punished. As much as I want her to just be tortured, it holds no value if she can&#39;t realize why. As such, though it pained me to do it, I flicked the wand and reduced her pain to the point where she can think, but only just barely. For good measure, I lock her mind on the idea that this is only happening because of the brutal way she tore apart my heart on my birthday. She could have been ruling this power with me, but she left me for a dirty cheat.<br />
<br />
My lingering urge for the revenge to mean something satisfied, I sit back and relax to her calming screams. When her throat goes sore and she can just whimper, I pull out my phone and watch a movie or two, all while watching her silent agony off to the side. Eventually, I get tired and flop onto Lindsey&#39;s bed, her whimpering quickly culling me to sleep.<br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
I wake up around noon and stretch, magicking up some cereal as I see my favorite captive still locked in her painful trap. As much as I enjoy watching her though, I know it&#39;s time to end her torture. I gently wrap my fingers around her and lift lightly, using the wand to disperse the glue. With a gasp, Lindsey rises in my hand off of the pencil. I gently lay her down on the table as her shattered hips repair themselves. She quickly curls into a fetal position and this time I let her, even grabbing a few tissues to use as blankets to cover her with. As I finish my cereal, her breathing slows down to a steady rhythm, still interspersed with whimpering.<br />
<br />
Her torture over, I&#39;m left with the question of what to do with Lindsey. I have limitless possibilities at my fingertips, but the real question is how much do I still care for her. That stray feeling of compassion from early has re-surged with a vengeance, but the memory of the beauty of her torture still lingers in my mind. Peeling back the tissues blanketing the girl I once loved, I see a sleeping, blissful, and most importantly, terrified form. A strong contrast to the pure agony of moments earlier. Weighing both the memories, I finally decide that I will...</p>
