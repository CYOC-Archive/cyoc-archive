<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The Benson farm pasture was where the escapee pony mare Margery had leaped the fence and ran far into the cattle pasture. Marg felt alone, although she knew the cattle herd were somewhere around in that pasture, she felt sure they would not cause her any harm. The eastern boundary of the Benson farm as set next to the Gilkey goat farm, Marg could recall that, as she remembered the barn-devil talking, he said something relating about Debra.<br />
<br />
Marg cocked her head to check where the sun stood in its path to give her an idea as to the time of day. <br />
Her being a girl scout and later in life a scout leader, she knew many tricks about being away from urban lifestyle. She wanted to head toward where Reverend Manson resided, he being her best hope of getting back her human existence and lifestyle. The Reverend lived at the house beside the church, it given to him to reside there as part of his wage for leading the church congregation.<br />
<br />
As for her to get to the church property she, Marg would need to cross the Gilkey farm and then the northern pasture of the massive Killingsworth ranch. Marg picked up her pace to trotting, as trying to being careful as the pasture had some earthen mounds what told her that woodchucks were near, and if while galloping she stepped into such a hole, she could break a leg and then be in a deadly situation.<br />
<br />
After a mile or more and Marg arrived beside the Gilkey farm fence. Marg stopped to check the fence, and was pleased to see of no barbed wire what if when she leaping the fence could cut her belly, or give a cut to her legs.<br />
<br />
She saw no Woodchuck holes anywhere there and this gave her courage to galloping a wide circle and running fast at the fence, she cleared over the top with her pony athlete ease. With the fence behind her, Mar began to gallop across the goat pasture, as she kept a wary view for any aggressive buck goats. <br />
<br />
Marg galloped up a steep hill and when she reached the peak, she had a good view of the goat farm. As from her stance she saw in the distance the yellow corvette that Debra owned and drove, it being the only such color of a Corvette in the county. Her seeing the bright sun-yellow car, her memory did a flashback, Marg recalling then of what the Devil in the barn said about Debra.<br />
<br />
“Debra was driving fast, and when some other driver backed out of a driveway to blocking the oncoming lane, Debra was passing a slow moving truck. She had no place to go but hit the truck or leave the road, as did she drive through a pasture fence and into the Gilkey goat farm. <br />
<br />
That Devil said she lived through the experience, remarking as of good cars those Corvettes. Debra was as alive, unhurt but left there by the truck driver and the person driving their car. Poor girl, she was as the Devil said, humanly alone but not totally alone. <br />
<br />
When she opened her car door and sat dazed after the incident, sat there seated in her car.<br />
<br />
What then did the Devil tell, as of Max, the prize Kiko breed buck goat, the herd sire for the Gilkey farm?<br />
<br />
A bold brute is Max, as much a guard dog mentality about trespassers or strangers when at the farm; the brute reacts with a temper. And there sat Debra, her car door flung open and she dazed. Very likely that Max would smell from her a scared and aroused scent.<br />
<br />
That Devil told the Reverend about Debra, as she turned her head and saw then Max. He and she were both feeling aroused but from differing reasons. The Devil reached his power to inspire in Debra to thinking about Max as a prospective lover, as that Devil placing in her mind hints to her wanting of feeling something erotic. <br />
<br />
He caused her to slipping her legs free from inside the car, as letting them hang outside. The erotic passions getting the better of her, she spread her legs, pulled down her panties and lifting her dress, gave Max the view of a horny female wishing he would mate.<br />
<br />
Max was well known for his techniques at corralling a doe goat and then mating, as did buck goats they would mating, breed with a doe goat in six to seven quick sessions, assuring a doe became as impregnated. Poor Debra had no idea what Max could do, and both the buck goat and Debra were likely then inspired by that damn Devil.<br />
<br />
It is easy to imagine that like had Jasper did to me, Max aroused Debra by him giving her pretty virgin body an alluring tongue licking. The buck licking was his courting, as hinting to her for his fond hopes that he, a big buck goat would then want to mount and mate.” Marg was the daughter of a rancher, so she being the wife to a breeding farm owner she knew the ways of animal husbandry well.<br />
<br />
She trotted down the steep hill and kept going toward where she saw the car. As Marg trotted, she liking her agility, the mare form offered, was different than when as a human she was feeling the age of her years as a mother and housewife.<br />
<br />
Marg stopped her trot, and stood then listening, she hearing the sounds of a likely aroused woman moaning, groaning, possibly enthralled by a man pleasuring her sexually.<br />
<br />
“Marg is that the new you,” Marg heard the voice of Debra ask a fool question.<br />
<br />
Marg turned and walked slowly closer toward a thicket of tall Honeysuckle bushes where she saw two human bear feet protruding from beneath the thick stems of the bush.<br />
<br />
“Max, Max how I do la la…love you, Naa…!” Marg heard Debra exclaim.</p>
