<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Several months had passed since Jen received the curse. She had no idea what had happened to her, and her life was in shambles.<br />
<br />
Her alarm went off. She sat up and stretched. As she yawned, she leaned over and scratched an itch on her thigh, almost two feet from her torso. With a grunt, she heaved herself out of bed.<br />
<br />
Her naked ass cheeks slid out of bed with a thunderous clap. Even though Jen expected it, their sheer weight threatened to pull her back onto her bed. She leaned forward to compensate, waddling her way to the bathroom. Each of her gargantuan ass cheeks was larger than an exercise ball, and full of fat and water. They sloshed back and forth with each labored step.<br />
<br />
She squeezed through her bathroom door sideways, something she started having to do only two weeks prior. Her hips and ass cheeks were far wider than almost any doorframe. As she let her shower heat up, she took a few moments to look at herself in the mirror. Above her waist, she was her normal, skinny, athletic self. She hasn&#39;t gained an ounce up there, and she was starting to wonder if she&#39;d actually lost weight on her upper half.<br />
<br />
Her lower half, however, was different. Her hips jutted out, fat and soft, almost 4 feet wide. She turned, and her ass sloshed. It stuck out from her back almost another 2 feet. Each cheek was well-defined and round, however, a pocket of fat over her ass crack made reaching it difficult. Her cheeks hung almost to her knees, where a fold differentiated her beach-ball esque cheeks and her thighs. Her thighs also held quite a bit of fat, each knee being as wide around as her waist. Her calves were muscular and toned, much like her upper body, and had grown significantly carrying her newfound weight around. She sighed, and pinched one of her cheeks, feeling the soft flesh below.<br />
<br />
She waddled into the shower. The warm water immediately soothed her. She felt it course over her body. She shampooed and conditioned her hair, feeling the product run over her vast butt. As she leaned forward, bracing herself on the walls, she grabbed her sponge. It had been placed on a long stick a month ago, to help her reach areas of herself her arms no longer could. She scrubbed her thighs and as much of her ass as she could, taking special care to clean out her deepening, sensitive folds. As she leaned all the way forward, in a yoga-like position, she felt her fat shift forward. Water finally entered into the cleavage between her ass cheeks and thigh, much to her relief.<br />
<br />
She spent several more minutes in the shower, enjoying the warm water. As she stepped out, she grabbed her large towel, and began to dry herself off. It was becoming more and more difficult to get the towel around her ass, and she feared she soon wouldn&#39;t be able to reach. A familiar tingle ran through her ass as it expanded another inch. Jen sighed. When would it end?<br />
<br />
As she shuffled her naked, absurdly pear shaped body back into her room, she wondered what she was going to wear. She paused while looking at her cheer outfit. She missed being on the team, her old friends, her mobility. And the skirt was so small! It mocked her.<br />
<br />
She grabbed one of her leggings, all of which were stretched to the breaking point. She had to slowly shuffle the leggings up her legs, careful not to tear them. It was hard to find clothes that fit, and she soon feared she&#39;d outgrow 6XL pants. She also threw on a large skirt. On anyone else, it would have covered them waist to ankle, but on her it barely reached her knees. She slipped on her C cup bra and a normal, small t shirt, and waddled sideways through her door. These days she didn&#39;t even bother with trying to find underwear.<br />
<br />
Now her next challenge awaited, stairs.<br />
<br />
She&#39;d grown to hate them. Despite her parents&#39; huge mansion, the staircase was no longer wide enough for their ever growing daughter. She had to slowly make her way down sideways, one step at a time. Her cheeks bounced with every step, threatening her balance. It was perilous, but soon, it was over. She made her way to the kitchen, where her parents had left some breakfast foods out for her. They lived busy CEO lives, and so were already well out of the house when she had awaken. She sat down on not one, not two, but three dining room chairs pushed together. They groaned as her cheeks spread out. She chowed down on the toast and sausages, feeling her ass grow a little bit as she ate.<br />
<br />
She heaved herself back up, grabbed her backpack, and went outside to wait for the bus.</p>
