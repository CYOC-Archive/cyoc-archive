<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The 9 hour long firefight claimed the lives of 3 officers and 7 of the terrorists - the 18 individuals inside were heavily armed, and even were prepared with gas masks and a flamethrower to continue fighting during tear-gas raids.<br />
<br />
A civilian by the name of &quot;Josiah&quot; is credited with beginning the initial process of the final successful raid by running straight into the firefight and, with his slime-like mutant properties, absorbing 204 bullets from various directions, as well as 2 quarts of gasoline in the form of flames.  His act confused the conspirators long enough for law enforcement to finally gain an effective foothold in the building.<br />
He was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom.<br />
His only regret is not having arrived at the scene earlier.<br />
<br />
<br />
With the great deal of evidence gained from the raid on the Tennessee apartment and other locations and hideouts of the conspirators from around the world, the picture was finally put together.<br />
<br />
The group called themselves &quot;The Humans&quot;, and had been planning for months to perform an act to frame mutants that was so sever that they would be shunned by the rest of the &quot;pure&quot; human society for generations to come.<br />
<br />
They had originally banded together online as a mutant hate group, harassing the transformed for fun and &quot;justice&quot; before they began to enact their &quot;master plan&quot;.<br />
<br />
All members were untransformed individuals, and some had already been working in the toothpaste plants since before the Fusion Wave. Many others joined after, and unfortunately, their plan to secretly contaminate hundreds of thousands of tubes by mixing in a hyperaphrodisiac mutant substance into the paste had succeeded.<br />
<br />
And so, only one piece of the puzzle remained - who was and where was the plant-like mutant whose secretions had started this all?<br />
Had she cooperated with the terrorists, or was she forced to comply?<br />
<br />
The WTEA and the world received their answer 2 days later during a search of a storage locker in Romania that had been leaked by multiple members of the terrorist group during and after interrogation.<br />
<br />
Inside lay the emaciated, barely alive body of Adela Mrazova, a Czech girl that had been missing for over 2 months - a plant mutant.<br />
She had disappeared while walking home to her apartment from a party, taken by members of the terrorist group in a van who had discovered her secretions&#39; extreme effects.<br />
Having been cleared for a legal WTEA permit to sell her secretions in small doses, the reason why the WTEA was unaware initially of the plant she had fused with was because she had unknowingly fused to a Gingko Biloba tree sapling of her next-door neighbor.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The state Ms. Adela was discovered in was nothing short of horrifying.<br />
Evidence of torture was found.<br />
<br />
Having been restrained in the same location with numerous handcuffs, zip-ties, ropes, tape, and chains, the girl&#39;s lower body had begun to rot and mold.<br />
The red and blue lights that she had been situated under for a while to &quot;help her grow and generate the liquid,&quot; as stated by a few of the terrorists, had been switched off presumably to let her die, a slow, withering death.<br />
<br />
Her ears, tongue, and eyes had been cut out and off, and burned at their tips.<br />
<br />
Ms. Adlea&#39;s four arms and two legs had been forcibly removed - some with a saw blade and others with a blunt fireaxe, while one of her arms appeared to have just been pulled off - as evidenced by the many remaining torn sinews.<br />
They were all burned at their ends.<br />
<br />
Still attached to her six penis-nipples and her three groin-situated penises were the tubes to an industrial milking machine - they were switched off, and moldy pools of her aphrodisiac secretion were found in them.<br />
<br />
Evidence was found that Ms. Adela was sexually abused as well.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Ms. Adela was quickly rushed to a hospital where, after it was determined that her brain was still functioning, despite having suffered injury, emergency surgery and treatment was given to her, removing all sections of rot, mold, and burned tissue as possible from her body.<br />
<br />
An effort was then made to expose Ms. Adela to as much red and blue lights, as well as sunlight, as possible, along with giving her necessary nutrients, in hopes of helping her recover faster. <br />
<br />
The security detail assigned to Ms. Adela was bolstered by the local police as an angry mob of both transformed and untransformed individuals surrounded the hospital in efforts to punish her due to her &quot;integral involvement&quot; in the terror attacks.<br />
<br />
A full blockade was ordered around the hospital when rioters used a water-balloon launcher to hurl a Molotov cocktail up and into the window of the room next to Ms. Adela&#39;s.  Though there were no deaths, a great deal of property damage from the fire was reported.<br />
<br />
<br />
Hopes of Ms. Adela&#39;s fast recovery were exceeded as she gained her eyes, ears, and tongue back, along with their functions, within two weeks.<br />
She then took the opportunity to explain her ordeal to WTEA representatives and the world as she tearfully apologized for her unwilling hand in the calamity in a live television event.<br />
<br />
All riots died down after that.<br />
<br />
Some members of the terrorist group &quot;The Humans&quot; still remain on the loose.<br />
All captured members are either looking at life in prison or capital punishment - which Ms. Adela is advocating against.<br />
<br />
Ms. Adela is expected to make a full recovery and gain back the full use of her arms, legs, lower body, and genitalia by the next month.<br />
The WTEA has assessed and is putting into motion her requests for assistance with all individuals who were victims of this terrorist attack.<br />
<br />
A memorial was erected in honor of all of those whose lives were prematurely silenced in Tennessee, USA.</p>
