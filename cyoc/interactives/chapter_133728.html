<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Breanna wasn’t spared from the gut extension as her own belly began to swell to pregnant proportions while she moaned loudly. Soon Breanna and Stewart were both pregnant sixteen year olds and they looked at one another with panic before pleasure overcame them both as their bellies swelled and they began to age up. Breanna crossed seventeen years old and suddenly her inflated stomach was gone and she held a baby girl in her arms. Stewart was still sixteen when the same thing happened to him. They both panted and moaned as they got older and their children switched to car seats and then into regular strollers. Both women found themselves outside in the park now fully clothed and Stewart moaned and groaned as she passed nineteen and watched Breanna gain a graduation cap and gown while she didn’t. Instead a ring appeared on her finger as they passed into their twenties and their kids began to run around. Stewart’s son and Breanna’s daughter playing in the mud together. Breanna shook her head and began to talk about university while Selene’s stomach began to swell again with another pregnancy. Months passed and Breanna’s points of topic began to change as she passed classes and entered new semesters. Breanna swelled to nearly nine months pregnant and soon enough she was holding another baby boy while Breanna’s daughter Bree and her son Tyrone looked on. She nursed the baby gently beginning to feel at home with it as it grew larger in her arms. Breanna talked about her second year in university while Selene felt her stomach prick again and by the time she put Pryce down she was pregnant again. The location changed again to a backyard with a picnic table and old tree. Bree climbed the branches while Tyrone and Pryce watched. Breanna gave a swift, “Be careful!” To the clumsy five year old before she returned to talking about university. Selene began adding to the conversation talking about her husband and children as she turned twenty two and her third child appeared in her arms. A little girl she instinctively knew as Harriet.<br />
<br />
Seasons changed around them and soon Selene had memories of dropping her oldest son off at kindergarten and how he now had more friends than just Bree. Breanna talked about university, she talked about her husband and her stomach began to extend again as she put Harriet down. She got heavier and heavier as occasionally a man in a suit appeared to kiss her and squeeze her ass or something. Breanna was soon in graduation attire again from university. Five years of it down and Selene was holding her fourth child, a baby girl she called Quin. She wasn’t even surprised when immediately after she got pregnant again. Breanna began to talk about dental hygiene and her new job while Selene began to grow comfortable. Breanna and her entered twenty five and by that point Selene had five children with Carson being the latest. Here Breanna began to talk about maybe opening her own dental practice, then she was talking about opening it, then she was talking about it. She talked and talked and Selene felt arms wrap around her as Breanna and the backyard vanished. Her husband was atop her fucking her. The pleasure was intensified as thy aged and she began to grow pregnant again. Her climax was accompanied by another birth and Raylee was born before the thrusting continued suddenly in real time. Her husband was pounding her doggy style and she felt every part of his fucking. It only sped up once he came in her womb. She was sipping through another pregnancy and only stopped eight months in dressed fancily as she stared at Breanna dancing with a very handsome man in a tux while she wore a flowing white wedding dress. She smiled for her best friend and things sped up again. She gave birth to Felicity and began trying to pitch having a baby to Breanna while her seven children ran about her house screaming. They were in their thirties when time slowed down again and Breanna revealed she was pregnant. Selene screamed and revealed she was as well before time sped up again and Breanna gave birth to her daughter Lisa two hours before Selene pushed out Xavier.<br />
<br />
Time sped up a little more and Breanna went about her time raising a baby and going back to work as a dentist while Selene cleaned the house, baked, and generally  acted as a housewife. It brought her pleasure and made her happy. So happy that when time stopped speeding forward at age thirty six with another baby on the way. She smiled warmly as she sat next to an equally pregnant Breanna watching Tyrone in a formal tux dance with his wife Bree while family and friends gathered around them cheering and clapping.<br />
<br />
“I’m surprised she didn’t wear a suit,” Selene commented while Breanna laughed.<br />
<br />
“She likes dresses, he just has to know that her true love is her ant farms,” Breanna laughed while looking at her entologist of a daughter smile blissfully in her husband’s arms.<br />
<br />
“Ever wonder what it would be like if we hadn’t gotten pregnant in high school?” Selena asked while Breanna laughed.<br />
<br />
“At this point in my life I really couldn’t care less what dither versions of me are doing,” Breanna replied before tapping her husband on the shoulder. He took her hand and swept her up joining the throng of people joining the dance floor. They swayed back and forth happily while Selene watched them, too pregnant to stand up thanks to twins instead of one child like Breanna had. Her husband rubbed her back and she leaned onto his shoulder with a smile. For a second a scream of agony and dissatisfaction yelled from the back of her mind. She thought of the name Stewart but shook her head and it was gone. She focused back on her son with a smile certain she wouldn’t have life go any other way.</p>
