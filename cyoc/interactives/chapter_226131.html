<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Well this is the end of chapter 1, a looooooooooot longer than I expected. Very tiring but very happy. This has always been the story I wanted to write, although it has changed a lot. Feel free to use it.<br/>
In my first draft, the protagonist appeared in a Port-city alley. When he was cluelessly wondering, he was targeted by a pair of thug bro, and after feinting them and escaping, he drilled into the small alley, luring the small one in and turning him into a skinsuit. Impersonating the small one, he easily takes down the large one and transforms him into a skinsuit as well.  Then a twist happened: he could only keep one skinsuit on, and the small one came back to life, but he was forced to obey because the protagonist had merged with the big one. And find out they are docker in urge for a lot of cash, the protagonist seal a deal with the big one, and with modern knowledge and marketing skill, he quickly got the money.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I rapped politely on the heavy wooden door. &quot;Max, I&#39;ve returned!&quot;<br />
<br />
The door creaked open to reveal Max on the threshold, eyes widening beneath snowy brows. His white fur standing on end in surprise. He exclaimed, “Ghost? What the hell? Where did you find this tailless and furless monkey body? It looks weird. And creepy.”<br />
<br />
I chuckled at his misunderstanding, as in a world without humans, he had no idea what I was. I corrected him, “Actually if a monkey had no tail, it would probably be a chimpanzee. But I’m not a chimpanzee, either. I’m a human.”<br />
<br />
Max stared, taking in my lack of fur and strange pink skin with new interest, but quickly snorted and acted unimpressed. He said, “Whatever. Matters not what you are - did you find aught useful?&quot;<br />
<br />
Sigh inwardly, I steeled myself for his reaction. His tail swished anxiously as I spoke. &quot;About that, I’m sorry to tell you this, Max, but I couldn’t find any injustice in your incident and compensation claim. Both the rabbit&#39;s memory and reports revealed no foul play in your case. It seems that you are just unlucky and they claims their right properly.&quot;<br />
<br />
Max&#39;s ears flattened in dismay. Muscles tense beneath scarred fur, disappointment etched on familiar features. My heart sank to see his hopes thus dashed.<br />
<br />
Gently, I continued. &quot;I know this is not what you wanted to hear, and I feel sorry about it. Please don’t be angry with me, Max.&quot; <br />
<br />
Max&#39;s muscles bunched and bulged as he clenched his fists, shoulders tense with anger and crushing disappointment. When he glared at me, eyes aflame, I saw the depths of his desperation - and knew my failure cut him deeply. <br />
<br />
&quot;Useless!&quot; Max snapped, teeth bared. &quot;All that hoping for nothing!&quot;<br />
<br />
Max&#39;s chest heaved as he fought to calm himself. Slowly, the tension drained from his massive frame. Meeting my gaze once more, Max sighed heavily. Aw, hell, ghost. I knew the chance was slim. It&#39;s just... I really wanted to maintain my dignity, you know? Don&#39;t wanna give back all that hard-earned cash.&quot;<br />
<br />
I gave him an apologetic smile, trying to lighten the mood, &quot;There may yet be ways, Max. Let&#39;s think positively. Maybe we could find some ways to make quick cash to cover the compensation. You know, like selling some stuff or…”<br />
<br />
Max cut me off, waving his hand dismissively. “Yeah, yeah, we’ll figure it out. Enough talk now, leave this creepy body and put him back in his place. You can use my body instead, helluva lot better than this scrawny monkey.” His tail began to wag, swatting my legs in its enthusiasm.<br />
<br />
I rolled my eyes, feeling a bit offended. “Hey, stop calling me creepy. I know I must look strange, but that’s how I was born. Show some respect. And I have muscle too, just not as huge as yours.”<br />
<br />
I reached out and took Max&#39;s hand, demonstrating my newfound strength from the heritage upgrade while channeling Possession. I readied to fuse our forms once more - but was halted as I felt a strong resistance, and he suddenly grabbed my hand with force. A gasp escaped me at the strength behind it.<br />
<br />
Max looked at me with shock and disbelief, his eyes wide and his muzzle open wide. He yelled, &quot;The fuck? You got a body of your own? You ain&#39;t no fuckin&#39; ghost?&quot;<br />
<br />
I nodded, still perplexed by his intense reaction. Gesturing to my backpack hanging on the wall, I explained, “Yes, this is my real body. And no, I’m not a ghost. Didn’t you notice my bag? I brought it with me when I possessed you.”<br />
<br />
Max shook his head, still holding my hand and said, “I… I never paid it no mind. I thought it was some loot you found. Why the hell have you never corrected me you’re not a ghost?”<br />
<br />
I shrugged, fingers idly plucking at my worn shirt. “Well, growing up as a scrawny guy with special hobbies, I’m used to being called names. As long as it’s not negative and referring to me, they don&#39;t much bother me. Besides, you seemed to like calling me a ghost, so I played along.&quot;<br />
<br />
Max finally released my hand. He let out a long breath and began pacing around the room, his tail swishing anxiously behind him. He was a bulky wolf beastman, who towered over me with his muscular frame and furry coat. His irritated look should be intimidating, but I knew he won&#39;t hurt me, so I waited patiently for him to calm down.<br />
<br />
After a while, he stopped and stared at me as if he was seeing me for the first time. He asked in a small, vulnerable voice, trembling with emotion &quot;Then...why...why stick around? You&#39;ve legs that work - find some posh noble and take their lives. Not a lowly beastman like me with naught but troubles, working my ass off, got fired, with no money and no future. You can just ditch me, why helping me so much?&quot;<br />
<br />
His crimson eyes, usually so bold, now held a muted pleading. A deep well of emotion lay bare beneath gruff words.<br />
<br />
I hesitated, unsure of how to express my feelings. “Max, I don’t see you that way. And… I have to admit, I&#39;ve grown quite fond of your company. At first, when I stopped you from taking your own life, I sensed your hopelessness and anger, and I couldn&#39;t turn a blind eye. But as I got to know you, I realized that there&#39;s more to you than meets the eye. You are a certain good host that I find quite endearing. Your wolf beastman form is quite impressive, I must say.&quot;<br />
<br />
Max&#39;s expression turned sour, his brow furrowed in discontent. &quot;Fond of me? Ha! You keep talkin&#39; bout my body like kinda pet or toy? Do you even see ME, or you just like havin&#39; me as your meat puppet?&quot; <br />
<br />
I felt a pang of guilt, realizing that my words may have come across as shallow. I tried to rectify the situation. “No, no, that’s not what I meant. Max, I do care about you as a person, a lot. You have certain...merits, a strength that I admire. You&#39;re brave, Max, facing death and me, a stranger who stole your body without fear. And despite your gruff and exterior, you have a good heart, a willingness to listen and learn. Your spirit is also what I’m fond of, you make me laugh, and you make me feel accomplished. You’re… you’re special to me, Max.”<br />
<br />
Max gazed at me, awash in hope, fear and longing for understanding. My answer seemed to calm the turbulent waters within him. He gave me a warm smile and said, &quot;You mean that? F&#39; real? You think I&#39;m special er somethin&#39;?&quot;<br />
<br />
I nodded, feeling a surge of affection for him. I said, &quot;Yes, Max. I do mean it.  You’re special to me, can’t be measured by fortune or status. I… I don’t know if this is love, or something else, but I know I want to be with you. I want to help you, support you, protect you. I want to make you happy, and I want to be happy with you. I want to spend the rest of my days by your side.&quot;<br />
<br />
He put his hands around my shoulders, brought his muzzle close to my neck, and blew into my ears. “I want that, too.”<br />
<br />
Thrilled by his acceptance yet heart pounding, I felt my face turn red and quickly looked away shyly. I realized what I had just said, I had confessed my feelings to Max directly. I had never been so honest and vulnerable before, and I didn&#39;t know what to do next.<br />
<br />
Max grinned, threw back his head and howled with laughter at my expense. He said, &quot;Hah! You&#39;re still blushin&#39; after all this time you done with my body? You&#39;re as cute as a button when you&#39;re flustered.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, shut it,&quot; I muttered into my hands.<br />
<br />
Max barked out a harsh laugh. &quot;Lookit you, all stutterin&#39; an&#39; as red as a beet! Thought you were so slick with your words.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Can&#39;t blame you fer likin&#39; all this.&quot; Cracking his knuckles, Max flexed his bulky arms, showing his snowy fur and cords of muscle. &quot;The ears, the tail, the whole package - I know I&#39;m one good lookin&#39; beastman.&quot; Max flashed me a cocky smirk. &quot;So which part of me you like best, huh? The brawn or the fluff?&quot;<br />
<br />
He puffed out his barrel chest, daring me to admit just how much his wild appearance appealed, making me feel even more flustered.<br />
<br />
Max&#39;s sharp grin faded some, but his eyes stayed intense as he scratched at the scruffy fur below one pointed ear. &quot;I mean it. You keep things from gettin&#39; dull, that&#39;s for sure. Without you rattlin&#39; around in my head, don&#39;t know what I&#39;d do.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You are special to me, too.&quot;  He pulled me closer to him, and whispered in my ear, “So, Why don’t you possess me again, and feel my body for yourself? I don’t mind sharing it with you. It is quite exotic in fact, I like it when you’re inside me. You make me feel things I’ve never felt before.” <br />
<br />
I nodded silently and sheepishly, unable to resist his invitation. I wanted to be with him, to feel him, to possess him. I channeled Possession again and hugged him tightly, like wanting to blend together. But nothing happened. No flash of light, no sensation of life force, no change of perspective. We were still two separate beings.<br />
<br />
Max looked at me, a cocky smirk spreading across his face. “What’s wrong? Can’t do it? Or you just enjoyin&#39; the moment?”<br />
<br />
I felt a surge of panic and called out the panel to check my ability. Then I realized that due to my failed last attempt, Max was immune to my powers for 24 hours. I sighed and said, “Bad news, I forgot about the cooldown. I can’t possess you  until 24 hours later.”<br />
<br />
&quot;Well ain&#39;t that a bummer! Guess we&#39;ll just have to wait, eh?&quot; Max&#39;s red eyes glinted with amusement. &quot;S&#39;not like I&#39;m goin&#39; nowhere. Where we off to tonight, anyhow - grab a room at the inn?&quot;<br />
<br />
I shook my head, feeling a bit embarrassed. I said, “I don’t think I have the currency to do that…”<br />
<br />
Max&#39;s brows shot up, surprise giving way to skepticism. &quot;No money, eh? Prancing about in fancy duds like that?&quot; He cocked his head. &quot;How come?”<br />
<br />
His direct questioning caught me off guard. Unused to outright queries, I fumbled for a believable half-truth. &quot;It&#39;s... a rather long story.&quot;<br />
<br />
Max stretched out with a yawn. &quot;Ain&#39;t got no plans. Yap at me with your story - you said it&#39;s of good things, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
His brusque offer actually eased my nerves, knowing that he listened to me. I felt a surge of trust for him and decided to tell him the truth. The bizarre truth of my life as an outsider from another world. Even though it sounded irrational and crazy, I hoped he would believe me.<br />
<br />
“About that…” I began, feeling a knot in my throat. I told him my story from the start, giving him some background about Earth and how I had been transported into this Isekai by a god.<br />
<br />
He settled in to listen, furry ears perked up as his snout twitched. Looked interested, curious, but also like he was tryna solve a damn puzzle. &quot;That&#39;s a lot a mumbo jumbo,&quot; he grumbled. &quot;Don&#39;t make a of sense to me but I trust you. So this means somewhere you come from but not here, and ya got no home, money or folks?&quot; He sounded confused, but also concerned. He shuffled closer to me, his fur brushing against my skin. He wrapped his arms around me as if he wanted to offer comfort in his gruff way. <br />
<br />
I nodded, feeling a bit sad as he summed it up in such an oversimplified way. I said, “I try not to think about it. And the way you said it sounds so miserable, but yeah, no one but you.” I looked into his eyes, hoping to see some acceptance and affection.<br />
<br />
Max caught his breath and clapped me on the shoulder. He smiled warmly and said, “Don’t you fret none, ghost. You can bunk here till we sort things out. Consider it repayment.”<br />
<br />
Max shoved me toward the empty bed that belonged to Adrian, which was quite a disaster with his fur and drool. He said, “You can crash on that runt’s bed. He ain&#39;t due back tonight anyways, or ever by the looks of it.&quot;<br />
<br />
I shook my head, feeling uneasy. I said, “No, it’s rude to sleep in his bed without asking. And if Adrian comes back and sees me sleeping in his bed, things are going to get ugly and awkward!”<br />
<br />
I couldn&#39;t believe the words that were about to escape my lips, but I took a deep breath and let them out. &quot;What if we... cuddled?&quot;<br />
<br />
To my surprise, Max simply shrugged, his wolfish features displaying an easygoing demeanor. “Fine by me.” he replied without a hint of hesitation.<br />
<br />
He lay down on his bed and gestured for me to join him, his large frame occupying most of the space. <br />
<br />
With a curious mix of excitement and reluctance, I approached slowly. &quot;Are you sure?&quot; I hesitated, noting the limited room available. &quot;I mean, there&#39;s not much space left. I might end up being more like a fork than a spoon.&quot;<br />
<br />
He let loose a gravelly laugh that shook his whole frame. &quot;Don&#39;t fret none about it. We&#39;ll manage. And I ain&#39;t no spoon, I&#39;m a damn ladle!&quot;<br />
<br />
Max pulled me closer, he positioned himself as the big spoon, comfortably lying flat on his back, while I nestled into his embrace as the small spoon, my body facing down on top of his. <br />
<br />
His well-built physique and soft fur provided a delightful cushion, transforming him into a cozy, living bed of warmth and comfort. With my head resting gently upon his invitingly sculpted abs, I marveled at the intimacy we shared, relishing in the genuine connection we had formed. Max&#39;s massive arms enveloped me entirely, creating a sense of safety and protection that melted away any lingering worries. As I gazed up, our eyes met, locking in a tender exchange that spoke volumes without a single word.<br />
<br />
Somehow, we fit together perfectly. I rested my head on his chest, feeling his heartbeat, a comforting lullaby that whispered serenity. When I peered up, our eyes locked and we shared a smile, both relaxed in each other&#39;s comforting presence after the day&#39;s troubles.<br />
<br />
Max tapped my skull with his jutting chin, neither soft nor harsh. &quot;Sleep now, quit your fussin&#39; over tomorrow&#39;s troubles. Save it for then.&quot; <br />
<br />
His gruff yet caring tone soothed my lingering worries. As darkness overtook my vision, I felt at peace. In these uncertain times, having  Max by my side brought relief. For now, that was enough. Sleep came easily, my wolf&#39;s steady presence keeping all negative at bay. Tomorrow would come as it may, for tonight, all was calm in this safe place.</p>
