<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dana crept out of her apartment carefully, making her way to the laundry room.  One of <br />
her neighbors, Mrs.Miller, had a pair of girls, and if Dana remembered right, one was very <br />
close to her current age.<br />
<br />
Sure enough, there were clothes in the dryer.  Jackpot!<br />
<br />
She'd return the clothes later, of course, but it was a little weird, putting on another girl's <br />
panties.  It was a cute outfit, if a little big on her.  Denim jeans with little hearts on them, <br />
and a blue baby-tee that had stars and more hearts printed on it with silver glitter.<br />
<br />
She couldn't believe Mrs. Miller let her girl wear this, the jeans were &quot;low-riders&quot;.  For a <br />
preteen girl to show off that much skin was...well she wasn't sure how to feel about it.<br />
<br />
Especially since she was the preteen girl currently showing off her flat tummy and, well, <br />
more.<br />
<br />
She didn't have any shoes to wear, but fortunately, it was a warm day.  It was a bit of a <br />
walk to the mall, but she had more energy than she'd had in a long time.  Her body felt so <br />
light, she felt like skipping, but decided not to call any more attention to herself than was <br />
necessary...although she did peform a few cartwheels in the grass.<br />
<br />
She'd once had dreams of becoming a gymnast, before her mother died.  A strange <br />
thought came, unbidden.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why can't you?&quot;<br />
<br />
She shook her head, as if to clear it.  But still...<br />
<br />
Finally, she reached the mall.  She kept an eye out for rent-a-cop's, she didn't want to be <br />
tossed out for not wearing any shoes.<br />
<br />
She entered the Wal-Mart, deciding not to spend too much money on clothing...but once <br />
she started, it was hard to stop.  She wasn't just cute, one glance in a mirror proved that <br />
she was beautiful.  Had she been this pretty before?<br />
<br />
She rather doubted it...maybe a side effect of whatever the Professor had done to her?  <br />
However he'd done it...it was hard to believe a can of soda could make someone younger, <br />
but unless she'd completely gone mad, the proof was hard to deny.<br />
<br />
She finally decided to wear one of her new outfits after purchasing it.  She used to love <br />
wearing skirts, but it had been a long time since she felt comfortable doing so.  She found <br />
an adorable red skirt..a little shorter than she'd liked, but it looked so good on her!<br />
<br />
She matched it with a pink blouse, and bought a matching ribbon to tie in her hair...if <br />
there was one thing she'd always prided herself on, it was her long hair.<br />
<br />
Oh sure, it had darkened considerably as she got older, but that problem was now <br />
remedied.  She walked into the mall proper with a pink backpack over one shoulder, <br />
stuffed with her clothing.<br />
<br />
Strolling into the food court, she found something reasonably healthy at the China Max.  <br />
Well, at least it had vegetables.  She swore not to let herself get overweight again.  <br />
Exercise and watching what she ate was a small price to pay, considering.<br />
<br />
Everywhere she went in the mall, she found things she'd been wanting, and now, had few <br />
reasons not to purchase.  The balance on her debit card was unreal; the Prof must be <br />
loaded to set her up with that kind of cash!<br />
<br />
She decided to forgive him...yeah, things weren't going to be easy, but...she couldn't <br />
imagine going back now.<br />
<br />
Strangely, despite the fact she was carrying several bags by the end of the day, the weight <br />
didn't bother her at all.  She was apparently a lot stronger than she looked..curious, but <br />
she wasn't going to complain about it.<br />
<br />
Still, walking home didn't sound so great, especially with her breaking in a new pair of <br />
shoes, so she took the bus.<br />
<br />
All throughout the day, she'd noticed that she got a lot of attention.  it was a little creepy <br />
from the guys, sadly, but she didn't mind too much...it had been a long time since she'd <br />
gotten that kind of attention.<br />
<br />
It was the girls that confused her.  Oh sure, there were quite a few jealous glares, but <br />
more often than not, she'd see a girl looking at her with...well, awe.<br />
<br />
Was she really that pretty?  <br />
<br />
It was something she'd have to find out.  <br />
<br />
She finally got back to her place around seven.  She was exhausted, it had been a long day, <br />
so she decided to take a bath and get some sleep.  She could return the 'borrowed' <br />
clothing in the morning...plus, she had more shopping to do tomorrow.<br />
<br />
A growing girl has to eat right, after all.</p>
