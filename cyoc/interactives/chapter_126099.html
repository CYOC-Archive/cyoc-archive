<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The smell of the football teams locker room should have disgusted Jason, but it didn&#39;t. He was just following Simon in a daze, anyways. They walked in and Simon gestured for Jason to sit down.<br />
<br />
&quot;What is it, bro?&quot;, Jason asked in his deep, dull voice. Simon smiled as he pulled something gold and shiny out of his pocket; it was a good hypnotists watch. Simon began to slowly swing it back and forth.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoa dude, what is....&quot;, Jason began. He didn&#39;t get to finish that sentence, as he slowly dazed off, his eyes glazing over, becoming totally focused on the watch. A line of drool slowly dripped down Jason&#39;s newly bearded face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Listen to my voice, Jason&quot;, Simon repeated. Jason slowly nodded, obviously under the spell of the watch.<br />
<br />
&quot;You like being a jock, don&#39;t you Jason. I know it&#39;s all so new. The muscles, the hair, the big dick. What do you think about it?&quot;. Jason&#39;s big strong hand lazily began twirling his fingers through the long curls sprouting from his chest, as his other reached down and cupped his balls. He softly moaned in his new deep voice. &quot;I fucking love being a jock Simon. Thank you!&quot;.<br />
<br />
Simon smiled and continued; &quot;All that hair, your new smells, being constantly horny, none of that bothers you, does it? In fact, you love it!&quot;. Jason lifted up his strong arm and took a deep whiff of his hairy armpit. The strong BO hit his nostrils and his dick twitched in response. Jason did love it! He was so grateful to be a jock.<br />
<br />
&quot;And that big dick, you love it, don&#39;t you? So thick, sensitive, strong. And those balls! So big and hairy!&quot;. Jason&#39;s hand wandered down to his cock again and began to slowly stroke it. By now it was already hard and dripping precum.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh Simon, I can&#39;t believe I&#39;m a jock. I love it. I can&#39;t wait to put this huge dick into one of those hot cheerleader girls! I can&#39;t wait to fuck one of them with this!&quot;, Jason went on, still in a daze from the hypnosis. Simon continued to swing the watch; this was the hard part.<br />
<br />
&quot;So Jason, that&#39;s the problem. There are too many of us jocks, and not enough cheerleaders to go around. When I turned you into a jock, we were already a bit low on the numbers of fuckable women here. And, as you know with a set like that, we are constantly horny and we need to fuck constantly...&quot;<br />
<br />
Jason&#39;s eyes glazed over as he tried to process this; &quot;What are you saying? I won&#39;t be able to fuck one of those girls?&quot;, he asked, sounding almost pitiful and sad.<br />
<br />
&quot;No Jason, sorry. Those are reserved for me and the other jocks. But, I have a solution for both our problems! Just keep staring into the watch. I want you to think about all the things that make you horny, get you turned on!&quot;<br />
<br />
Thoughts of women and breasts, pussies and long legs raced through his brain as he drooled and stared blankly at the swinging watch. Jason moaned as he felt his already hard cock swell even harder. His huge hairy dick stuck straight out, and he was so horny.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, that&#39;s it Jason. Get horny. Keep thinking about all those hot women. Picture those images and thoughts&quot;. Jason closed his eyes and licked his lips; he was obviously deep in thought and fantasy.<br />
<br />
Jason as their, staring at the watch, as pictures of shirtless girls passed through his head. &quot;Now, Jason, as I said before, there are just not enough women to go around for another jock like you, so, we are going to make it so your not attracted to girls any more! Your going to be attracted to your jock bros!&quot;<br />
<br />
I want you to think about all your jock bros. All the football, basketball, lacrosse players. I want you to think about them. Picture their muscular bodies, their scruffy faces, their hairy chests, their musky odors from working out&quot;. Jason did as he was told. He moaned; The images of all his friends and fellow players raced into his mind. Big dicks, hairy chests, stinky armpits, hairy asses, large balls bulging out of jockstraps. He tried to fight the changes! He didn&#39;t want to be gay! He loved girls! However, the images kept racing through his head and he found himself getting a bit aroused by his thoughts.<br />
<br />
&quot;Simon, please stop. I don&#39;t want to be gay. I like girls. Please!&quot;, he weakly begged. &quot;Oh Jason, this will be better for both of us. If you were straight, you would never get any pussy. Youd be horny all the time. This way you can get off by pleasing us and all the other jock bros have another outlet to bust a load in. It&#39;s a win win for both of us!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jason felt his mind shifting, felt his desires for breasts and girls changing. He felt wild fantasies coming into his head; having sex with the whole football team, letting them do whatever they wanted to him. He dreamed of sucking dick after dick of all the jocks, over and over. He thought of sniffing hairy armpits ripe from practice. All of these thoughts were making him severely turned on. He was unbelievably horny. He felt a tear run down his scruffy cheek as the last images and desires associated with females left his brain forever. He was left hopelessly, totally gay, and totally obsessed with the jocks at his school.<br />
<br />
Simon stopped swinging the watch and Jason slowly regained control over his body and mind. He surveyed his surroundings; the locker room. It smelled like pits and BO, but for some reason the smell turned him on like no other. He glanced over at Simon, staring at the hairy chest, the thick pit bushes, the huge cock in the stretched, nasty jock strap. His dick lurched at the sight. &quot;God, Simon is hot!&quot;, he thought to himself. Almost without a thought, he crawled over on all fours to Simon.<br />
<br />
Jason started at Simon as he slowly got up. He had an aching hard on. He stared at Simon, this huge hairy jock. That was when Jason lost control. He shoved his face right into Simon&#39;s rancid pit, sniffing and huffing the body odor. The long bushy hairs tickling his face. He moved on, licking and sniffing Simon&#39;s hairy chest. He would have stayed there, except a huge, powerful hand grabbed his head and pushed him down. Jason didn&#39;t even resist as he fell to his knees, face to face with Simon&#39;s smelly yellowed jockstrap. It looked absolutely stuffed with meat and some bushy pubes stuck out. He was so turned on and he couldn&#39;t look away.<br />
<br />
Simon slowly lowered the jockstrap, letting his huge floppy cock out. Jason moaned at the sight of such a huge, hairy member. A wave of crotch stink washed over him and he shuddered in pleasure. He didn&#39;t even care if this was his new life; it felt too good.<br />
<br />
Simon stoked it a few times, letting his member come to life. Without having to be asked, Jason started sucking. He was having a hard time with how big Simon was, but he was doing everything he could to please him. The nasty member stunk and tasted like sweat, but Jason loved every second of it. He reached up and started massaging the huge hairy orbs below the impressive cock. Simon started moaning and softly bucking his hips. Jason&#39;s nose was buried in the wiry pubes, getting even more of their scent on him.<br />
<br />
With a deep grunt, Simon came. He gripped Jason&#39;s head with his strong hands and bucked his hips. Jason gagged on the amount of cum that came out, but he did his best to swallow it. Simon pulled his sticky cock out of Jason&#39;s mouth. &quot;Thanks buddy, that was the first of many of my loads your going to take&quot;<br />
<br />
Jason looked up at Simon and his drooling cock. He knew he was straight, but his mind was telling him this was his purpose; to suck dick, be fucked, and serve the football team. They worked so hard on the field, and it was Jason&#39;s duty to relieve their stress in other ways.<br />
<br />
Simon started pulling on his yellow jockstrap as they both heard a bunch of deep, rambunctious noises. The football team was coming back in. &quot;Jason, the practice is over. Now is the time for you to shine! All those hairy, sweaty, stinking football players are going to to need to get off!&quot;<br />
<br />
The horny football jocks rounded the corner and Jason saw them, instantly becoming hard at the sight. He had to smell them. He had to service them.</p>
