<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;I wish Mark was 300 pounds.&quot; he muttered, a smile playing on his lips. &quot;And...was 8 inches shorter.&quot;<br />
<br />
   Behind him, his foster father cried out in shock! &quot;What? Hey! Ty, what...what's happened to me?&quot;<br />
<br />
   Ty walked down the steps, and laughed at the sight. Mark was now only 5'2&quot; tall, and the added poundage made him stagger. Ty sees that, under all that fat, Mark has lost his athletic build. It's easy to see, as Marks clothes have been torn to shreds by his sudden growth.<br />
<br />
   &quot;Yeah? What's up Mark? What do you need?&quot; Ty says with a smile. He watches as uncaring his foster father reaches out and steadies himself against the sofa.<br />
<br />
   &quot;Ty...I don't know...what...How this could have happened. I'm...&quot;<br />
<br />
   &quot;Naked, for one thing.&quot; Ty says with a chuckle. &quot;Let's get you some...appropriate clothes.&quot;<br />
<br />
   Ty makes another wish, and suddenly his foster fathers doughy form is wrapped in yards of black cloth that quickly takes on a recognizable form. A great, black dress with white lace at the neck, sleeves and knee-length skirt. It looks like the sort of garment an old fashioned maid or housekeeper would wear.<br />
<br />
   Ty laughed as Marks face twisted into anger. &quot;YOU! You're doing this to me! How...&quot;<br />
<br />
   &quot;Woah, Marqessa. Wait until I'm done. Then you can thank me.&quot;<br />
<br />
   Mark started to waddle towards Ty, but he was now far to slow. Ty made more wishes, and grey hose formed on Marks legs while black flats encased his feet. His hair grew long and was pulled back into a tight, dowdy bun. Muted make-up formed on his face, adding slight color to his lips, cheeks and eyes. Mark now looks for all the world like a short, fat woman. <br />
<br />
   &quot;Now, Marqessa...&quot; Ty said, with a hint of amusement in his voice. &quot;...what are you doing lazing around the living room? Shouldn't you be in the kitchen making dinner? Mistress June will be home in a few hours, and you don't want her to be cross with you. After all, she might just fire you. Then you'd have to go back to Jamaica. You wouldn't want that, now would you?&quot;<br />
<br />
   Mark suddenly felt his blubbery flesh tingle, and he saw his skin darken to a shade of deep mahogany. His nose got bigger, flattening and flaring, while his lips thickened and swelled. Unconsciously, his bigger lips formed a natural smile. His hair turned black and nappy, and though he knew he was a wealthy, white man who owned this house and was married to &quot;Mistress June&quot;, he also knew that he was an obese, black woman named Marqessa. A fat, Jamaican woman who worked for this family as a cook and housekeeper.<br />
<br />
   His body shifted inside the uniform, as huge breasts formed and his cock pulled up into his body, becoming a set of VERY female genitalia. His hips broadened and his butt swelled amusingly. When it was done, Mark had gained another 50 pounds!<br />
<br />
   Mark tried to curse at Ty, but what came from her mouth was a lilting and musical sing-song chatter of &quot;Ty-boy, dis a bad ting you done! What gonna be tol' to my wife when she get home an' Mark ain' heah? What you gonna say, Ty-boy? An what 'bout my sonny Dustin?&quot;<br />
<br />
   Ty smiled and reached out, cupping his former foster fathers buttocks and guiding her towards the kitchen. He'd wished that the newly minted Marqessa couldn't tell anyone who she really was, and that she couldn't refuse any request of Ty's. As opposed to ordering him around, Mark would be taking orders. Instead of being wealthy and impressive, she would be poor and unintimidating. At 5'2&quot; and 350 pounds, she looked helplessly out of shape.<br />
<br />
   &quot;Now, get into the kitchen, Marqessa. And remember, once you enter the kitchen, you'll feel VERY comfortable. Very much at ease. You'll feel quite natural, and you'll be happy. You'll remember who you realy are, but you'll be unable to tell anyone unless I give you permission. But you won't worry about it, as you're just soooo happy.&quot;<br />
<br />
   And Ty was right. Mark...or rather Marqessa (a nice name) was suddenly happy and contented as she waddled about, getting supper ready. She tried to put on an apron, but she was too fat to reach behind her and tie the strings. Ty stepped in and helped her, and she suddenly felt that she loved Ty as if he was her son. A contempt for that spoiled brat Dustin came over her, and she smiled up at the saintly, friendly Ty.<br />
<br />
   &quot;Thank's, Ty-boy...&quot; she lilted happily as he stepped back &quot;...whut you done to me was wrong, but ah forgives you. Ah feels jus' so good inside. You always bein' such a nice boy.&quot;<br />
<br />
   Marqessa kissed Dustin on the cheek - giggled - then turned back to her work.<br />
<br />
   Ty left the room, pleased yet stunned by the scope of his powers. He'd jusy re-made himself into a tall, handsome teenager...and replaced his unpleasant foster father with a jolly, loving woman who thought the world of him. He listened to Marqessa as she sang and cooked, sounding like any happy woman in her kitchen. <br />
<br />
   He looked up at the clock, and saw that June should be home in an hour, and who knew where Dustin had run off to. He had to decide what to do with them. He thought he might keep Mark as he was (Marqessa was quite an improvement), but wasn't sure. <br />
<br />
   He had to think.</p>
