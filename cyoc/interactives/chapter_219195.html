<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The next morning, Corinne felt... the same. She looked down at herself and saw no real difference. Her breasts had shrunk all of half a cup, and her waist was 3 millimetres wider than before. That was it.<br />
<br />
She grabbed the bottle from her bedside table and read the label carefully. &quot;Treatment takes place over 2 - 3 months. What?!&quot; She slammed the bottle back down. &quot;I wanted something quick and easy that could be over in a week! Not several months. I could medically transition quicker than this shit!&quot;<br />
<br />
Grabbing a handful - half of the pills - she shoved them into her mouth and downed them in a few large gulps of water. Her body shivered, but nothing happened. She waited a few moments more. While it felt like her body was filled with electricity, nothing outwardly was happening. She sighed and reached for the rest of the pills. Just as she had grabbed another handful, however, a tremor shook her body, and she spilled them down onto the floor.<br />
<br />
Corinne looked down at her hand as her fingers pulsed larger and meatier, inflating with each heartbeat. Her shoes were beginning to feel tight too, and she quickly removed them to find her feet were three sizes bigger and growing quickly. She stripped off the rest of her clothes as well, not wanting to miss the rest of her transformation.<br />
<br />
Her biceps bulged along with her thighs as she began to grow taller. Her jaw became squarish, chiselled and sharp as her long hair receded into her head, the elastic falling to the ground. Stubble began to cover her new, manly jawline, lending her a roguish, handsome look. Abs made themselves known on her stomach, along with larger shoulders and lats, creating a lovely V-shaped taper to her body. Hair grew across her arms and legs, spreading to her chest and down toward her pubes. Then, the final changes occurred. Corinne&#39;s clit grew swollen and red, pulsating larger, extending out from her vagina a few centimetres. She groaned, hearing her voice crack as she did so. A large Adam&#39;s apple appeared in her throat, as her pants became husky and deep. She moaned, her thick, meaty hand wrapping around her budding cock as it grew out, a nice 7-inch, uncut manhood that sat stiffly in her fingers. Or rather, his fingers, as he finally transitioned from female to male pronouns in his mind.<br />
<br />
Corinne, or Cory, looked himself over in the mirror. He was a gorgeous guy, something like a Hemsworth, with a little less swagger that made him cute. He&#39;d kept that bookish, quiet part of his personality, and it was evident in his appearance. Still, he wasn&#39;t lacking in the looks department, his short blonde hair curled in a slight wave, his muscles not massive, but still enough to give him a good figure. And his cock, while not huge, felt amazing as he stroked his hands across it. <em>Alright, time to test this out</em>, he thought to himself. He was already hard, and being new to all the sensation it gave him, he was sure he&#39;d be quick to blow his load. Except, that didn&#39;t happen. For a whole minute, Cory stood there, jerking off his meat to his reflection, but he just couldn&#39;t cum. He sped up his movements, feeling his precum slick against his 8-inch boner...<br />
<br />
Wait. 8 inches?<br />
<br />
Cory looked down at his hands and found his cock was swelling larger, straining his grip until he couldn&#39;t wrap a whole hand around it. Cory&#39;s eyes widened as he began to panic. The now foot-long cock kept growing longer and larger, reaching, 14, then 15 inches, stopping at a huge 17-inch rod of thick, hard man meat. &quot;No, no, this isn&#39;t supposed to happeeeen-&quot; Cory groaned as his balls followed suit, growing to the size of grapefruits in his grasp.<br />
<br />
His muscles began to swell as he surpassed his old 6&#39;2 height. Growing upwards and outwards, he soon found himself a huge 8-foot bodybuilder, muscles so large he could barely see over them, each one glistening with sweat. Veins rippled across his skin, pulsing with his heartbeat, as his enormous pecs and 8-pack abs shifted with each breath. His hair grew long and wild across his shoulders and arms, covering his chest in a pelt of golden fur. His pubes were a thicket, his legs covered in a good coat as well. He hunched over, his hands stroking harder and faster down the length of his cock. His voice dropped to a rumbling baritone so deep you could feel it in your bones.  <br />
<br />
But the biggest change came in his mind. It felt like his very being was being ripped apart, torn between two voices. <em>You are Cory. You&#39;re shy, you like reading and watching anime, you study and get good grades. You&#39;re fine just the way you are,</em> whispered one. The other voice whispered back, <em>But why just be Cory when you could be so much more?</em> As Cory&#39;s movement sped up, he felt the two different personalities war, each yelling louder and louder. But only one would win. As he climaxed and painted the wall white with his spunk, the winner emerged.<br />
<br />
Cory looked at himself in the mirror. A hulking, hunched beast of a man, his breaths coming in deep growls as he stared himself into his own wild eyes. His muscles twitched, incredible power held just below the surface. His veins throbbed angry red lines across his skin. He bared his teeth and saw his canines had sharpened to points. The giant drew himself up to his full eight feet of height. He breathed in and roared. The house shook, his deep voice echoing through the neighbourhood.<br />
<br />
He was Cory, a beast, a monster. He was strong and powerful. He would dominate everything in his path until the world itself bent to his will. <br />
<br />
He didn&#39;t bother with cleaning up, nor covering his huge, muscular body before he stomped downstairs in search of his first prey.</p>
