<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">(authors note: I accidentally added an S to my name. I don&#39;t feel like retyping each option so check the other one I made for options.)<br />
<br />
the four suddenly felt their bodies change once again. this time changing into forms similar to their old selves with some differences. selves minus Maalu of course. his was simply being able to talk in broken English with a bit of effort. the first to change was Ayzo.<br />
<br />
his spine altered from a quadruped to a bipedal stance as his front hooves separated. this brought his height to Maalu&#39;s former height of four feet. his front legs quickly returned to arms as tinges of dark red fur were added to his muddy yellow coat. these areas were his tail, hoofs, and raised ankles. even thicker dark red fur grew on his elbows, shoulders, chest, crotch, and jaw. He also grew a large mohawk-like mane down his neck and upper back.<br />
<br />
apart from a large muscle gut and a slight amount of fat on his body, it was now incredibly muscular. the final change was his body&#39;s internal clock. he rapidly aged four years until he and Kalo were the same age. the same was quickly done with Maalu and the three were now all 18 years old. Kalo stretched as his front legs once again became arms.<br />
<br />
red fur was seen under his arms as he moved to a bipedal stance. red fur then traveled down from his mane to his crotch finishing the 7&#39;10&quot; lion mans changes. Last but not least Muv grunted as a second torso regrew above her current one. This time however it was the same thickness as the lower one. Once Muv reached 7&#39;2&quot; feet tall two growths appeared from his brand new shoulders.<br />
<br />
These new arms were thick like trees and had only three fingers (including the thumb). the winkles of age disappeared as Muv&#39;s body clock reversed until he was 18. the last bit of magic seeped into them changing their relationships. the former mother was now the fourth quadruplet brother. while they still remembered their old lives they found themselves embracing their new ones.<br />
<br />
&quot;can... talk... hard... though...&quot; Maalu said now finding it even more difficult to speak English. &quot;well bro at least you got us beat in one category&quot; Muv chuckled as he pointed to the gorilla&#39;s large flaccid cock. turning to the lion man Ayzo asked &quot;So was this in your dream too Kalo?&quot;. smiling Kalo gave a fang-filled grin. &quot;dreams can change all the time. My new one is making the most of our lives&quot;.<br />
<br />
they spent quite some time figuring out how to shift between their two forms with Maalu being the observer. eventually, they found their musk was the key. by focusing on it and imagining it changing they could shift at will. let&#39;s just say this led to a few orgies. these became less frequent as they felt something wasn&#39;t right.<br />
<br />
it wasn&#39;t like they didn&#39;t want to have sex. it was that their instincts wanted them to mate with a female. they also had the urge to spread this gift they had been given. Kalo vaguely remembered the latter was part of the dream he kept having. they soon smelled something different.<br />
<br />
This wasn&#39;t the pheromones or any nice smell. instead, it smelled like smoke. The brothers were worried something was amiss so they followed their noses. to be able to move faster they shifted to their feral forms. Maalu simply jumped on Muv&#39;s back.<br />
<br />
the sun had already set on the African plane as they approached the cause of the smoke. it was a fire in the middle of a campsite. they soon saw several cages filled with African animals and realized why this place was vacant. they saw three men huddled by the fire and laughing. while they hated poachers even before changing this opened an opportunity. they made sure to discuss their plans out of earshot from the men and then split off. they needed to be careful as they waited for one of them to split off from the group.<br />
<br />

<br />
&quot;...and then the beast charged at me and fell right into the trap. one bullet was all it took to stop its struggle&quot; a man said. &quot;Jude we&#39;re supposed to take them alive remember? the boss wants his own little Africa on his property&quot; another man said after drinking from his canteen. &quot;Jayden dude relax. besides we got the boss plenty of them. back me up Steve&quot; Jude said.<br />
<br />
an African man looked up from the cooking meat with a solemn face. &quot;your stunt cost us a lot of money. Be glad you are good trapper&quot; Steve said with a deep accent. &quot;whatever I&#39;m gonna have a nice rug at my place and...&quot; Jude stopped as he realized the boss was coming out of his tent. &quot;if you wanted a rug you should have gone to a store.&quot; the boss said with a deep Mexican accent.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry, Mr.Hughes. it... it was getting loose and I had to think of the team&quot; Jude said making a poor excuse for his actions. Mr. Hughes was not in any way gullible enough for that. &quot;Remember where your traps are, there is no one within screaming distance here... besides us of course,&quot; Mr. Hughes said. the threat worked as Jude&#39;s hands were trembling while a nervous smile was on his face. the other two immediately focused on the fire.<br />
<br />
&quot;sir the food is ready,&quot; Steve said. Jayden walked over to get the plates when he noticed the tent was open slightly. Jayden quickly grabbed a net figuring it was some foolish critter. entering the food tent he was grabbed before he could even turn on the light. with nothing but the fire&#39;s light coming from the tent flap, it was hard to see exactly who was grabbing him.<br />
<br />
it looked vaguely human but not at the same time. it suddenly shoved his face into its body. he tried to resist but soon the scent of cooked meat made him relax in a daze. Jayden found he couldn&#39;t stop breathing in its musk. As this was going on his body began changing...</p>
