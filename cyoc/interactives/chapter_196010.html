<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Are you sure this is wise Boss?&quot;<br />
<br />
The Boss now glanced back at Casseus, his glowing red eyes narrowing before turning back to the monitor. &quot;Positive,&quot; he grumbled. &quot;We know where Abolith is, so I&#39;m going to have my men infiltrate her home, steal back those files, and blow the place up.&quot;<br />
<br />
Casseus frowned. He had never agreed with Fukushu or his elf lover, yet he knew they would not be so foolish to remain in their home after what Abolith had done. Despite his objections the Boss was determined to recover the files, even if Casseus thought the idea was a waste of resources.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wolf Pack report!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No sign of the target or the objective,&quot; a voice crackled over the air waves. &quot;The area appears abandoned.&quot; The Boss sighed angrily, his hand disappearing under his hood as he rubbed his eyes. &quot;Set your charges and perform another sweep,&quot; the Boss said. &quot;The information they stole is crucial to the Normal.&quot; The soldier acknowledged the orders, Casseus and the Boss watching as the eight man team began setting demolition charges throughout the room.<br />
<br />
It still amazed Casseus how clear the ocular cameras were on the soldiers of the Normal. Casseus felt as if he was in the room himself as he gazed at the monitors.<br />
<br />
&quot;Did you hear something?&quot;<br />
<br />
The image on the screen began to scan the room, Casseus and the Boss watching as the team they had sent in clicked off their safeties as they began to scan the room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wolf pack report,&quot; the Boss stated.<br />
<br />
No response came, the Boss watching anxiously as his soldiers began to slowly survey the area. For the Boss he thought he saw the briefest movement in the shadows. &quot;Wolf pack?&quot;<br />
<br />
Before the Boss could issue an order the attack began. It was fast, darting in and out of the shadows, systematically eliminating his soldiers one by one. Panic now ensued, soldiers shouting, random blasts of fire erupting from rifles as the soldiers tried to mount a defense. All the Boss could make out was the flash of steel or the briefest glimpse of what looked like a tail.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wolf pack fall back to the extraction point!&quot;<br />
<br />
It was over before it even began. Casseus and the Boss watching as an orange blur darted toward the last soldier. The angle of the camera now shifted, tumbling before coming to rest on its side. The Boss noting the heads body now lying several feet away. Under his hood the Boss watched as a pair of digitgrade feet now approached, a pair of furry orange hands reaching down to pick up the decapitated head. As the camera now steadied itself, the Boss found himself staring eye to eye with a very angry Fukushu.<br />
<br />
&quot;All you have done here is sign your death warrant,&quot; Fukushu stated. &quot;I&#39;ll see you soon.&quot;<br />
<br />
Fukushu now dropped the severed head of the soldier, vanishing into the shadows as the bombs now detonated, causing the video to go black.<br />
<br />
***** the next day ******,<br />
<br />
Fukushu now gazed at Yuriko&#39;s home. After finding a safe house for Abolith and Raiden to stay, he had returned to his lair to wait. While not pleased that Abolith had gone off on her own he understood. Abolith was not a patient woman and would seek revenge faster than he would. What was unexpected was what she had discovered.<br />
<br />
As much as he didn&#39;t want to, he realized that the Catalyst and Yuriko needed to know what they had uncovered. Inside those files was information not only on the Normal but on Casseus, Evan, and several other projects the Normal were involved in. Pushing the door open, Fukushu now entered Yurikos home, his eyes growing wide in surprise. <br />
<br />
Yuna and Dashon were still on the couch, the young husband still coming to grips with his wife&#39;s family friends. As the front door opened, he sighed as he gazed at the nine tailed fox man. &quot;So who the hell is this then Yuna?&quot;<br />
<br />
Yuna was speechless, her eyes growing wide as she slowly began to skirt away. Yuna knew who this was and feared him greatly. &quot;Fukushu,&quot; she whispered in horror.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yuna Mishimura,&quot; Fukushu grinned. &quot;My, my has it been so long. It must be, what? 20 years since I last saw you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Yuna said nothing, Dashon noticing the color drain from his wife&#39;s face. &quot;Honey whats wrong?&quot;<br />
<br />
As Fukushu now began to approach, Dashon now stood up, standing in between Fukushu and his wife. &quot;Who are you and what do you want with my wife?&quot;<br />
<br />
Fukushu simply raised an eyebrow, a frown forming on his face. &quot;Step aside child this is none of your concern.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Child,&quot; Dashon exclaimed. &quot;Yo who you talking to? Step back from my wife before I smack the shit out of you!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fukushu,&quot; Yuriko said quickly, noting the kitsune was only seconds away from attacking Dashon. &quot;When did you see my granddaughter and what are you doing here?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I have information that you and your Catalyst could use,&quot; Fukushu replied icely as he continued to stare at Dashon. &quot;As far as your granddaughter is concerned I visited the girl decades ago. Shortly after Gloria&#39;s funeral.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I needed to see if the girl possessed magic,&quot; Fukushu stated. &quot;The best way to do so is by frightening the child.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You frightened my grandchild to see if she had magic,&quot; Yuriko replied angrily.  &quot;Bastard you know none of my children or grandchildren have magic!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And have you ever wondered why,&quot; Fukushu asked.<br />
<br />
Yuriko paused, she had; however it was something she never put alot of thought into it. She had always just assumed that her children had no aptitude for magic. Now, it appeared Fukushu knew the reason for this. &quot;Tell me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;When Casseus kidnapped you he began performing experiments,&quot; Fukushu said. &quot;Casseus was convinced he could sever a families connection to the arcane. It appears his experiments were a success.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My grandmother was experimented on,&quot; Yuna said in alarm.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes as an infant,&quot; Fukushu stated. &quot;I didn&#39;t learn about it until years afterwards. By then Yuriko was already a mother. Still, I was curious, which is why I have visited Yurikos grandchildren throughout the years. Just to be sure.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You experimented on my wife&#39;s grandmother,&quot; Dashon exclaimed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not me an old allie,&quot; Fukushu corrected. &quot;I am a killer but I&#39;m not a monster. I don&#39;t torture children.&quot;<br />
<br />
An awkward silence now seemed to linger amongst everyone. Yuriko shaken by the revelation of what happened to her while the others stared uncomfortably at the nine tailed kitsune. &quot;Catalyst,&quot; Fukushu stated. &quot;We need to talk. There is much I wish to share with you.&quot;</p>
