<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ten minutes before the clock struck six.  a group of college football players were in the locker, washing up and refreshing after a long afternoon of training.  One of the players was observing himself in the mirror and flexing himself with a few quick poses.<br />
<br />
Wearing just his boxers, he marveled at how he looks.  At 20, he was quite the stud with a flat and rock hard chest, eight-pack abs, and toned and muscular arms and legs without a single once of hair anywhere.  His face was crossing between a teen and a young adult as his face was clean shaven, a pronounced jaw line, and a short buzzcut hair.  Starring at himself, he smiled and licked his teeth with a cocky attitude.<br />
<br />
&quot;Damn Matt, you look smoking today.&quot; he said with such arrogance.<br />
<br />
One of his college buddies looked to him and gave a deep sigh.  &quot;Easy there, Matt.  I know you work hard on that body, but you shouldn&#39;t love yourself so much.&quot;  <br />
<br />
Matt heard him and turned to get to the bench where his clothes are.  Approaching his friend, he told him, &quot;Sorry about that.  It&#39;s just that I need to look good for my date with Cathy.  You know how she likes be strong guys like me.&quot; <br />
 He soon started to dress up, starting by putting his demin pants on first.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yes, how could I forget.  Your big date with the college head cheerleader.  You are quite the lucky son of a bitch.  So what&#39;s your plan with her.&quot; his friend said.<br />
<br />
Putting on his socks and running shoes, he smirked and said to him.  &quot;Oh, I have everything planned out.  First we head out to eat at her favorite place.  And then we&#39;ll head to the movies to watch some horror flick.  You know how horror movies get a girl worked up just to snuggle on a guy.  When it&#39;s all over, we&#39;ll take a romantic stroll through the park and finally, we go and back home and make a little lovin&#39; all night long.&quot;<br />
<br />
The friend heard that and asked, &quot;Your place or hers?&quot;<br />
<br />
Putting on his shirt, he chuckled and said, &quot;Isn&#39;t it obvious?  My place.  No doubt my family will be turning in early before we arrive.  When we arrive, we&#39;ll be in the living room doing some work, if you know what I mean, Jeff, Amy, and dad won&#39;t even know what happens.&quot;<br />
<br />
As he was putting on his varsity jacket, he heard a notification on his phone.  Taking it out of his jacket pocket, he noticed a text on it and it said.<br />
<br />
&#39;Hey babe.  Sorry, but I came to your place early then expected.  Going to be walking your dog for a while before meeting up with you.  Be back as soon as you get home.  Luv U!  Cathy.&#39;<br />
<br />
Seeing the text, he sighed as his friend peeked and said, &quot;Huh...  Looks like your girl has beaten you to the punch.  Guess you better get back there soon before she gets intimate with someone, or something, else.&quot;<br />
<br />
Matt gave a deep groan as he puts his phone away and said, &quot;Please...  Like I&#39;m going to be jealous of the family dog scoring first base before me.  Sides, my place is just an hour from here.  She&#39;ll have to wait until I get there.  Besides, I&#39;m sure Buddy will keep her company.&quot;<br />
<br />
He soon got his duffle back and turned to his friend saying, &quot;Anyways...  I&#39;m off.  See you at practice tomorrow.&quot;<br />
<br />
His friend smiled back and waved him off.  &quot;Sure thing dude.  See you tomorrow as well.  And good luck on your date!&quot;<br />
<br />
Matt chuckled and said, &quot;Oh...  I will...&quot;<br />
<br />
Walking away, he left the locker room and out of the football field.  Entering the parking lot, he approached his Cherry Red BMW Z4 convertable sports car and unlocked it with the roof opening up.  Walking to the side of his ride, he traced his finger on the edge and said, &quot;Hello beautiful...  You miss me?&quot; Matt soon chuckled and responded with, &quot;Oh yeah...  That is what I will say to Cathy when we start our date.  And she will enjoy this ride that I got when I started college.  I can imagine how she&#39;ll appreciate it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Popping the trunk, he place his bag in before closing it and headed to the front seat to get into the driver&#39;s side.  Starting the engine, he revved it before leaving the parking lot and campus, taking the streets and freeway.  During the ride, he soon thought, &quot;Hmm...  Wonder what my family is doing.  Hmph...  Probably dad and Jeff watching football while Amy is doing homework.  They won&#39;t be much of a bother later on when Cathy and I will have our own fun.&quot;<br />
<br />
As he was going to drive down the long hour trip back home, the clock has struck six and unknown to Matt, something was about to happen.  <br />
<br />
Emerging from Jeff&#39;s computer was a massive ripple that, in just mere seconds, had crossed the entire globe. But more importantly it allows the Chronivac to find the targets it needs for it&#39;s changes. And one of these targets was Jeff&#39;s Brother, Matt<br />
<br />
As the wave of reality washed over him, a small shiver ran down the jock&#39;s spine. With it&#39;s target in sight, the Chronivac whirred as it prepared the changes. After a few moments, the program dinged and multiple progress bars appeared, each showing it&#39;s four targets. Once it was done with Matt, he&#39;d become a strong father for Anita.<br />
<br />
As Matt drove, a strange feeling emerged within him. As each minute passed, various aspects of the man&#39;s body adjusted themselves. All of which functioned in relation to Matt&#39;s age. Muscles built up further as he moved through his twenties, his shirt and varsity jacket feeling slightly tighter as he grew more masculine and imposing. 20s shifted into 30s, with Matt&#39;s buzz cut beginning to recede at the front as the signs of aging began to creep into him. His burst of power rapidly declined, Matt&#39;s muscles quickly fading under layers of fat. A bit of his t-shirt rode up his belly as a sizable gut emerged from his tummy. His eight pack got consumed, the lower half melding into the man&#39;s gut as the upper half grew softer. His pecs had also suffered a similar fate, strength melting away into soft moobs. His arms and legs weren&#39;t spared from the changes either. Both limbs grew longer, forcing him to move his body to the point his back touched the chair. The muscles in both arms also got consumed by the fatty tissue. His hands and feet then expanded, wrinkles and calluses forming upon them as they caught up with Matt&#39;s age.<br />
<br />
Matt&#39;s face had also shown signs of aging. His youthful looks drained as wrinkles etched themselves throughout his face. Stretch marks had formed on the sides of his mouth, and some notable crow&#39;s feet formed at the edges of his eyes. His face grew wider, and his jaw squared off more. A small second chin then formed. The ridges above his eyes pushed forward slightly, giving him a permanent scowl. His shirt began to tear a bit as his neck widened and shoulders broadened. The lump in his throat grew larger, Matt&#39;s voice becoming loud, intimidating. After 20 minutes, Matt&#39;s age settled at a solid 45.<br />
<br />
Matt continued to drive while blissfully unaware that he&#39;d rapidly grown older. But despite his new age, the Chronivac wasn&#39;t quite done with him yet.<br />
<br />
Matt&#39;s hairline continued to recede by just a bit. Meanwhile, on the back of his head, various follicles thinned while others went back into his skin. A small bald spot was quickly forming. While his hair maintained it&#39;s short style, the color darkened from brown to black. Bits of grey had also been sprinkled in there, particularly around the edges. As he lost some hair on his head, he had also gained some. Black fuzz trailed down from the sides of his head before meeting at his chin. The hair then surrounded the man&#39;s mouth. A thick bush of hair emerged from his upper lip, a mustache materializing on his face. Meanwhile, the facial hair around his mouth became more boxy in shape, forming into a goatee. Some grey and white hairs emerged in his chin. His eyebrows had also grown bushier.<br />
<br />
Hair then trailed down his body with a thin line of fluff growing down the middle of his chest. Bushy hair branched out from that trail, quickly covering Matt&#39;s chest and stomach with some of it being visible through some of the rips in his shirt. Light dustings of hair then covered his arms, legs, hands, and feet. Bits of white and grey had shone themselves on this new mat of fuzz, giving it a salt and pepper look. While his body gained an influx of hair, his skin had also undergone its own change as it seemed to tan.<br />
<br />
Most of Matt&#39;s physical changes had then reached completion. Another wave was then sent out by the machine, this one containing the final bits of information to finish Matt&#39;s transformation.<br />
<br />
Matt drove up to a stoplight right when the thing turned red. The man grumbled in frustration, his deeper voice practically reverberating through the air. As the wave washed over Matt, multiple things occurred in his body at once.<br />
<br />
First was his clothes. Much of them were now torn or barely holding on, but this was quickly rectified. All of his attire enlarged to fit Matt&#39;s body. His t-shirt quickly restitched itself while the neck deepened to a V, showcasing the man&#39;s upper chest hair. His jeans shortened, the denim hardening into leather as they became a pair of leather shorts. A black belt slithered around his new pair of legwear. His running shoes expanded, the tongue and collar of them raising slightly higher than his ankle. More string materialized and tied themselves, and the color of his now boots became brown.<br />
<br />
The most drastic change, however, was his varsity jacket. The halves of the jacket grew closer. The split stitched itself together, various buttons sinking back into the material. The sleeves of his jacket shrunk before they were the same measurement as the t-shirt he was wearing. Both pockets disappeared, with a breast pocket forming on the right side of the shirt. The upper portion of the jacket&#39;s split remained with the collar of the shirt collapsing to the sides. With a quick change in color, from red to yellow, Matt was now wearing a polo shirt. As a finishing touch, a gold engagement ring formed around his left ring finger.<br />
<br />
While all this went on, Matt felt a migraine coming on. With another grunt, he moved a hand to his head and rubbed it while the other hand gripped the steering wheel. His college years were now far behind him, Matt now thinking of himself as a father. His view of his now former brother changed, an annoyance with the kid forming due to how Jeff was always hitting on his daughter. But Marco managed. Anita liked the kid, so Marco had to come to accept it. Despite this, a strong protective desire still rooted itself in the man&#39;s brain. He still had his duties as a father.<br />
<br />
English quickly became more of a second language to Marco. Spanish, on the other hand, was changing to be the man&#39;s first language. Marco&#39;s vocal cords shifted again, this time introducing a Spanish accent to the man&#39;s voice.<br />
<br />
Next on the mental agenda was the man&#39;s life. Long gone was a football playing college student, with those thoughts and knowledge being replaced by a rather extensive life as a police lieutenant. A sudden pain in Marco&#39;s chest hammered this home, a scar forming with a pacemaker materializing in his heart. As he clutched his chest, he shook his head, the memory of being shot in the chest having formed in his mind. Once the portion of his life as an officer was laid out, a new area laid itself out. A sudden pain surged on his left arm due to black ink embedding itself beneath his skin. A tattoo was drawing itself on him, prompting memories of Marco to recall his former status as a gang member.<br />
<br />
As his headache died down, Marco opened his eyes, the emerald green of the irises darkening to brown. Regaining his composure, he looked back up at the stoplight right when it turned green. Putting his foot on the gas pedal, he continued his drive back home.<br />
<br />
The Chronivac had now finished it&#39;s changes on Matt. With one last reality-shifting wave, it changed Matt&#39;s sports car into Marco&#39;s police cruiser. A roof formed atop the vehicle, windows materialized, and the paint job shifted from red to black. The district&#39;s emblem emerged on one of the doors, and a siren bulged out of the top of the roof. The last change involved the car&#39;s shape, the vehicle shifting to a more boxy appearance.<br />
<br />
Marco pulled his car up to the apartment complex his family, alongside the Kendricks, resided in. He&#39;d just gotten off work. Exiting the cruiser, he closed the door (although it came off more as a slam) and walked up to the front door of the complex. Once he walked through the threshold, he turned his head to find his daughter and Jeff snuggling up with each other on the couch in front of the TV. He hummed, right, it was date night.<br />
<br />
Anita seemed to be the first to notice him, &quot;Hey papa! Mama&#39;s up in our apartment. How was work?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff seemed to avert eye contact, but mumbled something inaudible. Marco raised an eyebrow, but decided not to press. &quot;I can talk about it later, you two continue your little… date night.&quot; Marco then ascended up the stairs to meet his wife.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh!  And can you tell mom to not worry about dinner for me.  Jeff and I have ordered pizza so we can enjoy ourselves.&quot; Anita soon yelled to her dad.<br />
<br />
Marco groaned a little and said back, &quot;Sure, mi hija.  I&#39;ll let her know.&quot;<br />
<br />
Climbing up the stairs, he had reached the top where there are just two doors leading to each apartment.  One door goes to the Kendricks, the other door goes to the Ramirez&#39;s.  Turning to the Remirez&#39;s door, he took his key out and turned it to open.  Once he&#39;s in that room, he walked down the hallway to get to the master bedroom and grunted to himself.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sheesh...  Qué día... El trabajo sigue acumulándose y no hay suficientes oficiales para mantener la paz en la ciudad. Un tipo como yo no puede tomar un descanso. Sin mencionar que mi hija está saliendo con ese chico desde hace un tiempo. ¿Cuándo va a recibir el mensaje de que él podría ser una mala noticia? Lo último que quiero es que Anita pierda su vaginidad a una edad temprana o peor... Se quedaría embarazada si no tiene cuidado. Ese chico estaría tan muerto si eso sucede.&quot;<br />
(Sheesh...  What a day...  The work keeps piling on and the there&#39;s not enough officers to keep the peace around the town.  A guy like me can&#39;t catch a break.  Not to mention that my daughter is hanging out with that boy for some time.  When is she going to get the message that he could be bad news.  The last thing I want is for Anita to loose her vaginity at a young age or worse...  She would get pregnant if she isn&#39;t careful.  That boy would be so dead if that happens.)<br />
<br />
He rubbed the temples of his head and imagine that scenario playing in his head.  Indeed, Anita is growing up to be a fine woman and has a bright future ahead of her.  But hanging out with someone like Jeff could be troubling.  If only she would ditch him and find someone who is more caring, then maybe he would be all right with it.  But Anita wants Jeff and the two hit it back when they were kids.  He can&#39;t change that.  Giving a sigh, he mumbled in full Spanish since he and Anita can only speak Spanish in their apartment since Catalina is the only Spanish speaking person in the household.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh bueno... Es la elección de Anita. Si ella quiere pasar el rato con ese delincuente, entonces no puedo detenerla. Pero si ese chico le hace algo que podría lastimarla, supongo que podría tirarlo al porche y dejar que se pudra allí hasta el día de su muerte. Oh, eso sería rico. Pero ya veremos. Hasta ahora no le ha hecho nada, todavía. Mejor espera hasta que haga ese movimiento. Por ahora, tengo que monitorearlo en caso de que ensucie a mi Anita.&quot;<br />
(Oh well...  It&#39;s Anita&#39;s choice.  If she wants to hang out with that delinquent, then I can&#39;t stop her.  But if that boy does something to her that could hurt her, I guess I could throw him in the slammer and let him rot in there till the day he dies.  Oh, that would be rich.  But we&#39;ll see. So far he hasn&#39;t done anything to her, yet.  Best wait until he makes that said move.  For now, I have to monitor him in case he does the dirty on my Anita.)<br />
<br />
He finally reached the main bedroom and opened the door.  By the time he entered, he could see his wife, Catalina, sitting on the king size bed watching her telenovela on her laptop.  In actuality, she was once Amy, Jeff&#39;s little sister.  But when the Chronivac made the alteration, she has not become Catalina, Marco&#39;s wife and Anita&#39;s mother.  Looking at her, he could tell that she was dressed as sexy as ever.  Her black and white tube top hugs her upper body and exposes her huge breasts with the cross is squeezed in between.  Her Chetah latex overalls made her legs long and sexual while it shows off her huge rear.  Her hair was done up in a bob cut  with a gray line down the side.  And her face was as beautiful as ever, even with signs of wrinkles and creases.  That&#39;s the one thing that made Marco smile, returning home to see her wife showing off her MILFy body.  Even if she&#39;s in her forties, at least she still keeps her body fit just for the two of them to have their private time after a long day of work for the officer.<br />
<br />
Catalina looked up to see her husband enter and was pleased to see him come home after a long day of working.<br />
<br />
“¡Hola Marco! ¡Bienvenido a casa!”<br />
(Hi Marco! Welcome home!)<br />
<br />
Marco looked to her and was a little tired.<br />
<br />
“Hola Catalina…. Anita me dijo que estabas arriba. Pude ver que estabas ocupado viendo tu telenovela y no haciendo la cena.”<br />
(Hey Catalina…. Anita told me that you were upstairs. Could see you were busy watching your soap opera and not making dinner.)<br />
<br />
Catalina heard that and looked to her digital clock to see what it’s already seven and was surprised.<br />
<br />
“¡Mierda! ¡Olvidé por completo que tenía que hacer la cena! ¡No te preocupes, te lo compensaré a ti y a Anita con un festín abundante!”<br />
(Aw crap! Totally forgot that I had to make dinner! Don’t worry, I’ll make it up to you and Anita with a bountiful feast!)<br />
<br />
Marco waved it off and told her to not to.<br />
<br />
“No te molestes. Vi a nuestra hija y a Jeff comiendo pizza juntos. Así que seríamos tú y yo esta noche.”<br />
(Don’t bother. I saw our daughter and Jeff having pizza together. So it would be you and me tonight.)<br />
<br />
He soon approached his work station and turned on the screens to see the many security cameras dotting across the their side of the condo and the lower level of the house. He sat on the swivel chair, which hasn’t change since the Chronivac altered both of them, while Catalina shifted her body to the side and asked about his job.<br />
<br />
“Entonces, Cómo estuvo el trabajo hoy”<br />
(So… How was work today)<br />
<br />
Marcos sighed and told her what happened at the office, even though and hour ago, Matt was practicing for the next football game before the change started.<br />
<br />
“Argh… Frustrante... Tenía que estar manejando la cantidad de papeleo con respecto a todos los tiroteos en las zonas rurales de la ciudad. Combine eso con toda esa mierda de desfinanciamiento durante todo el año, y tenemos una fuerza policial limitada que no puede manejar todos los delitos en un día. Política... No saben por lo que tiene que pasar el estadounidense promedio a menos que se saquen la cabeza del culo.”<br />
(Argh… Frustrating… I had to be handling the amount of paperwork regarding all the shootouts in the rural parts of the city. Combine that with all that de-funding bull shit all year, and we got a limited police force that can’t handle all the crimes in one day. Politics… They don’t know what the average American has to go through if unless they pull their heads out of their asses.)<br />
<br />
Catalina looked on and notice that he was focusing on the living room camera where Jeff and Anita were sitting on the sofa, watching TV, eating pizza, and getting a little intimate. Seeing that, she could tell that her husband is still worried for her.<br />
<br />
“Aún me preocupa un poco que nuestra hija salga con un estadounidense, querida. Sabes que Anita se está convirtiendo en una mujer independiente y que tomaría sus propias decisiones. Déjalo ir.”<br />
(Still a little worried about our daughter dating an American, dear. You know that Anita is growing to be an independent woman and would make her own decisions. Let it go.)<br />
<br />
Marco sighed and turned to her to explain why he’s worried.<br />
<br />
“Lo sé… Es solo que nuestra Anita necesita tener un futuro mejor que el que tuvimos que pasar en México. ¿Pero Jeff…? Parece un delincuente en busca de problemas. Quiero que mi Anita tenga un novio que parezca seguro y feliz. No un alborotador de la escuela secundaria que puede hacerle cosas terribles cuando crezcan.”<br />
(I know… It’s just that our Anita needs to have the better future then what we had to go through in Mexico. But Jeff…? He looks like a delinquent looking for trouble. I want my Anita to have a boyfriend that seems safe and happy. Not some high school trouble maker that can do some terrible things to her when they grow up.”<br />
<br />
Catalina gave a chuckle and remembered the day when they were young and hopeless.<br />
<br />
“¿Necesito recordarte que ambos éramos alborotadores en casa? Eres un pandillero rudo y rudo. Yo una stripper rebelde. ¿Olvidaste esa parte?”<br />
(Need I remind you that we were both troublemakers back home? You a rough and rugged gang member. Me a rebellious stripper. Did you forget that part?)<br />
<br />
Marco heard that and remembered when they were just a troublesome pair.<br />
<br />
“No... no lo he hecho... Pero Jeff es diferente. Me temo que podría salirse con la suya con nuestra hija en poco tiempo. Quiero decir, ella todavía es virgen por el amor de Dios. Si él le hace algo malo, voy a...”<br />
(No… I haven’t… But Jeff is different. I fear that he could have his way with our daughter before long. I mean, she’s still a virgin for God’s sake. If he does something bad to her, I’m going to-)<br />
<br />
That’s when Catalina stopped him and told him that it’s going to be all right.<br />
<br />
“¡Detente, Marco! ¡Estás siendo paranoico! Si conozco a Jeff, es un chico amable y se preocupa mucho por nuestra hija. Él nunca iría tan lejos para volverse loco con ella a menos que sean mayores. No le hará nada malo a Anita a menos que le dé la gana. Y sé que él no podría hacer eso. Solo déjalos vivir sus vidas. Sé que serán felices juntos.”<br />
(Stop, Marco! You are being paranoid! If I know Jeff, he’s a kind boy and cares so much for our daughter. He would never go so far to get freaky with her unless when they are older. He won’t do anything bad to Anita unless he feels like it. And I know he couldn’t do that. Just let them live their lives. I know they will be happy together.)<br />
<br />
Marco heard that and knew she had a point. Jeff and Anita have been together for a while and nothing bad happen between the two. But he still was concerned if that could really happen.<br />
<br />
“Aun así, todavía existe la preocupación por el hecho de que Jeff podría hacer algo que haría que Anita perdiera su virginidad. Me sentiría mal si Anita...”<br />
(Even so, there is still the concern over the fact that Jeff might do something that would make Anita loose her virginity. I would feel bad if Anita…)<br />
<br />
That’s when Catalina approached him and pecked him on the lips, snapping him out of it.<br />
<br />
“Todo va a estar bien, Marco. No te preocupes demasiado por eso. Estarán bien.”<br />
(It’s going to be fine, Marco. Don’t get too worked up about it. They’ll be all right.)<br />
<br />
Marco looked at her and felt a little aroused by the peck.<br />
<br />
“Sabes qué... Supongo que tienes razón. Anita es una niña grande ahora. Ella puede cuidarse sola. Solo espero que Jeff nunca haga nada pervertido. Hablando de pervertido... Estaba un poco sobrecargado de trabajo. Tal vez un poco de alivio me haría sentir mejor.”<br />
(You know what… I guess you’re right. Anita’s a big girl now. She can take care of herself. I just hope Jeff never does anything kinky. Speaking of kinky… I was a little overworked from my job. Maybe a little relief would make me feel better.)<br />
<br />
Catalina heard that and had some sexual tension as of late. Probably from the after effects of the Chronivac altering Amy, Matt, and the reality around them. Placing her long manicured nail to her face with her finger that has her wedding ring magically appearing, she smiled and knew where this is going.<br />
<br />
“Oh, pero por supuesto... Yo también estoy un poco reprimida últimamente. no sé por qué ¿Por qué no tenemos nuestro pequeño tiempo libre mientras Anita y Jeff están abajo?”<br />
(Oh, but of course… I too am a little pent up as of late. I don’t know why. Why don’t we have our own little free time while Anita and Jeff are downstairs?)<br />
<br />
Marco looked to her and said back with a tempting grin.<br />
<br />
“Pensé que nunca habías preguntado.”<br />
(I thought you never asked.)<br />
<br />
With that, the two started to kiss each other on the lips and they were smooching each others faces. The problem is that what they are planning to do now the Matt and Amy has become Marco and Catalina?</p>
