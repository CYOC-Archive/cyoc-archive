<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ty looked dissatisfied at his brother who was pinned up on the wall by the back of his underwear.  Dustin's underwear almost to his neck in the back and the sides were pulled up to his ribs but even so he dangled forward away from the wall.  He did not look like an art piece so much as a teen in a hanging wedgie.<br />
<br />
Ty's sighed in mild frustration shrugged his shoulders and started to pace.  He was seemingly distracted by his intent on revenge and had forgotten that he himself was just in bikini briefs and that he was still painted up from being turned into a poster boy.  He still couldn't believe that his brother had laminated him and essentially bound him in a poster.  Sure, it looked like a nice beach scene but the reality was that he had been flattened, pasted, painted and displayed in his underwear hung on a wall at school for his classmates to see.  An idea started to form in Ty's scheming mind but first he had to improve his art project.  He had stopped pacing and was staring at the stack of DVDs next to the television and got an inspiration.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; said Ty turning back to his dangling brother.  &quot;You're not going to get anybody an A hanging like that.  You're half sculpture, half hanging art and not good enough at either to reflect well on me, the artist.&quot;   Dustin was inclined to answer his brother's sarcasm with twin middle fingers but reflected that discretion might be the better part of valor or even survival at this point.<br />
<br />
&quot;First of all, you're in good shape but not the chiseled physique of the classic sculptures.  So let's make some modifications there.&quot;  Power flashed in Ty's eyes as Dustin felt his body change.  The first change he noticed was that his body hair was disappearing flaking to sand and falling away.   Except, now that that he squirmed a little, the sand that had been pubic hair that now gritted back and forth in his wedgied briefs.  The shifting warm sand was also massaging his balls a bit which was the one slight bright spot in his current situation.<br />
<br />
The next change he noticed was an increase in the pressure of the wedgie and Dustin realized it was due to the increase in mass as his muscles thickened.  His arms and legs flexed with increased lean muscle and his tight abs showed a nice six-pack and tight obliques.  He felt his glutes firm up around the stretched fabric of his skivvies actually adding a little more pressure to the overall unpleasant experience of a hanging wedgie.  He could feel his chest and shoulders also expand with muscle and a quick hand to his face made him suspect he had a little more a muscled jawline as well.<br />
<br />
&quot;The makeover was the silver lining,&quot; Ty joked, &quot;Here's more of the cloud.&quot;  Dustin floated off the wall and down to the floor.  As he floated down he quickly pulled his briefs out of his ass crack and got his undies back where they belonged dumping out the remaining sand.  He wanted to bolt before Ty continued but knew it would be futile.  Ty explained.  &quot;See the problem is you were hanging too far forward.  But I know how to fix that you can thank Borat for the idea.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dustin could take or leave Borat although it was a favorite of Ty's.  But Dustin was momentarily baffled as to why he should thank Borat.   Borat?  What could Borat....oh no!  Dustin's hands came up as though he were going to plea for mercy but Ty's wishes were already in motion.   The sides of Dustin's bikini briefs looped out from his hips and circled up and over his shoulders.  The back waistband rose up to the back of his shoulder blades like a suspender strap.  Dustin's hands fell back to naked hips and one hand felt his glutes and the thong riding up them.  He looked down at himself in disbelief.  His blue briefs were now a blue Borat mankini.  Despite his new muscular physique, he thought he looked ridiculous.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let's try that and see if it works better,&quot; Ty said smirking.  Dustin figured he must be in denial if he kept focusing on trivial items like looks while his powerful vengeful brother was still plotting. He felt a force grab the back of the mankini and lift him off the ground and place him back on the wall in the frame Ty had conjured.  He gasped as he settled back into this new wedgie.  Hard as it was to believe, this wedgie was even more uncomfortable than the previous one.   This thong forced him upright with his powerful back and glutes being the only parts touching the wall.  Without the support of the sides of his briefs, all his muscular weight was riding through the crotch and ass of this torture thong.<br />
<br />
Tears of pain gathered in Dustin's eyes as he grabbed at the &quot;suspenders&quot; in front and tried to lift himself up to relieve some of the pressure.  &quot;Uh uh.  No fair.  I didn't get to use my hands.   And I think I kept my composure when you had me hanging on the wall.&quot;  Ty binked and Dustin's hands released the fabric.  He could no longer touch the thong that held him suspended on the wall.  He could not even touch his own body.  Likewise his legs pushed away from each other as though carrying like magnetic charges.  His tears dried and his expression calmed although anybody looking closely could still see the deep concern Dustin had over his fate at his brother's whims.<br />
<br />
Ty looked at his brother hanging on the wall.  Dustin's muscles gave him a nice sculptural look while the mankini thong kept him hanging upright on the wall without the slouch.  Ty folded his arms and nodded in satisfaction at the direction his art was taking.  &quot;With great power comes great responsibility,&quot; Ty solemnly spoke.  &quot;And since I have great power, it is my great responsibility to make you a great piece of art as well as teach you a lesson about messing with me.&quot;  He paused.   &quot;I think I'm done for now but you're a work in progress so don't be surprised when there's more changes over the next couple of weeks.&quot;  With that Ty sat down on the couch grabbing a handful to munch as he watched Dustin hang there shifting around in a futile attempt to find comfort.  Ty smiled and leaned back with this hands behind his head contemplating the continuation if his revenge.</p>
