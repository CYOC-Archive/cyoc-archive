<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">He gazed into the water, the images flicking between each of the girls, and smiled that the magick he&#39;d cast was at least working for them. Thinking about the other two that had been afflicted, the fat man wondered why, and then had an idea. Turning away from the basin of water, he stepped as quickly as his girth would allow him to the table that held his spell books. Flipping through one book, he eventually slapped it shut in disappointment. Selecting a different tome, he repeated the process until, on the fifth try, he found the spell he&#39;d been searching for.<br />
<br />
Hastily glancing at the five statues, one of huge warhorse, another a monstrous Irish Elk, the third a dire red fox, and the fourth a very large bull, he made sure the four were fine, ignored the fifth, and instead hurried from the room. Muttering as he did, he mentally figured the components he&#39;d need, certain that the spell would reveal why the girl&#39;s brother and the other girl&#39;s boyfriend had been affected and whether any others might be.<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
Jason blinked sleepily at the dark room, confused. Thinking he must have fallen asleep, he tried to sort of why his shoulders felt uncovered and why the room was so dark. Clumsily reaching toward his nightstand, something making an odd rustling sound from beneath him as he did, he slapped the table for a moment before locating his alarm clock. Flipping it so it was face up, he blinked at stared blearly at it before understanding the time he was reading was nearly 7.30. Dropping it so that it once again lay face down, he groggily sat up and muttered, &quot;I&#39;ve fell asleep for nearly two and a half hours?&quot; and believing it must be because of how strenuous soccer practice had been, he stood and stumbled across the room, fumbled a moment with the door before finally remembering it was locked.<br />
<br />
Outside in the hall, as his bare feet touched the cold wood floor, Jason had another moment of perplexity, as he couldn&#39;t figure out why it seemed he didn&#39;t have any pants on. Something soft brushing against his legs, he shivered, but more from the draft that was coming from somewhere in the house. Silently moving downstairs, he quickly located the source of the cold as being both the fridge was open and that somebody had left the backdoor wide open. Suddenly scared at the prospect of some stranger being in the house, Jason quickly shut the door and listened.<br />
<br />
Not hearing anything, but still not convinced, he considered turning on all the lights, but talked himself out of doing so as he moved quickly over to the fridge and, without giving a second thought to what he was doing, slapped the door shut, missing completely the raw chicken lying on the floor. Tiptoeing through the house, Jason made a thorough check, even going to far as to peek into April&#39;s room. Finding he was alone, his search ending with his room, he breathed a sigh of relief and started back downstairs, as he realised he was hungry and hadn&#39;t dinner yet, but detoured toward the upstairs bathroom. Inside, he flipped on the overhead light, turned to close the door and promptly uttered a high-pitched scream when he saw somebody else standing in the room.<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
A warm, flushed feeling of arousal washing over, feeling her penis starting to grow hard, Diane tried to cover herself with her pants, but the soft fabric brushing against the sensitive tip of her penis only seemed to make the situation worse. Across the room, Chad nervously bit his lip as he stared at his girlfriend&#39;s hardening member, enraptured, starting to feel a warmth he couldn&#39;t at first identity settling between his legs, and thinking that he should look away, but finding it difficult to do so.<br />
<br />
From where she sat, Diane leapt up and tried to pull on her pants. Hopping about, she eventually managed to pull the jeans on, but only barely. Her penis and scrotum not fitting, no matter what she did, Diane grunted in discomfort when the area just behind her sack became pinched at the point where the pants split at the front. All to aware that Chad was peering not at her, but the monstrosity, as she thought it, she wanted to tell him to avert his eyes, but instead found herself looking down at his crotch. Thoughts about taking him, bending him over, mounting him, flooding her mind, making the horny feeling she was experiencing worse, Diane tried to say, &quot;No,&quot; but only managed a soft whimper that sounded, to both her and Chad&#39;s ears, like a noise of excitement.<br />
<br />
As if almost possessed, Chad slowly flounced across the living room. Stopping in front of Diane, he lovingly reached out and caressed her cheek, telling her, &quot;You don&#39;t need to cover it up,&quot; as tried to fight not only what he was doing, but what he was feeling.<br />
<br />
&quot;Stop,&quot; Diane whispered as she leaned stepped closer and breathing deeply a pleasant scent, she added, &quot;We shouldn&#39;t,&quot; as she reached out, slipped an arm over Chad&#39;s shoulder and drew him closer.<br />
<br />
The sixteen-year-old boy, losing the struggle he was trying to put up, nodding and accepted the invitation to draw closer. Feeling Diane&#39;s penis pressing against his flesh, he felt the warmth between his legs grow. Nodding, he whispered, &quot;Yes, we shouldn&#39;t,&quot; half halfheartedly as he reached down and gently grasped the erect shaft and began to run his hand up and down it.<br />
<br />
A moan of pleasure escaping Diane, she tried to say, &quot;No. You&#39;ll likely only make it worse,&quot; but, instead, she began to fumble with her pants, trying to get the garment off.<br />
<br />
Chad, as if knowing what she wanted, began to kiss Diane as he slowly dropped down to his knees. When he found himself looking at Diane&#39;s erect member, he found himself torn between wanting it inside him and weirded out by how the two were acting. Seeing the girl&#39;s fumbling hand as she tried to push down on, Chad reached out and grasping her pants, thinking they were awfully tight, he pulled down, stopping when they were down around her ankles and, without giving a second thought to what he was doing, he leaned forward and ran his tongue over the Diane&#39;s erect shaft.<br />
<br />
As if suddenly awakened, Chad thought, &quot;What the hell am I doing,&quot; even as he found himself relishing what he tasted and standing, he tried to push away, but instead stepped closer. Feeling the skin to skin contact, hearing Diane try and say something, Chad whispered, &quot;Take me. Satisfy this ache I feel between me legs,&quot; as his nipples disappeared and two lumps began forming down on his belly.<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
A high-pitched scream escaping him, Jason quickly backed up and away from the figure. Hitting the edge of the sink, feeling once more something brushing against his legs, he suddenly recalled what he&#39;d been doing earlier that evening. Putting it together with the fact that he was staring at the full-body mirror his sister kept in the bathroom, he giggled nervously at the image and stepped closer. Peering into the reflective surface, studying the dress, he again tittered uneasily as he found it unnerving that he thought the person looking back at him looked like a girl with short hair. Reaching up, tracing a finger around the edge of his face, Jason muttered, &quot;Even my face looks like a girl&#39;s,&quot; and thinking that he looked like a short-haired girl wearing a dress, his mind flashing to the tomboy in his class who&#39;d been forced to wear a dress by her mother on picture day.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe I&#39;m taking this too far. Losing myself,&quot; he decided a moment after staring his reflection and turning away, he looked at the toilet and considered whether he should stand up to pee or sit down before deciding he&#39;d had enough of pretending to be a girl for one evening.<br />
<br />
The fabric making a soft, pleasant sound as he gripped it and lifted up, Jason stepped closer to the toilet and reached down to grasp his penis. Only, to his surprise, he couldn&#39;t find it. Muttering, &quot;What the...&quot; he struggled to look past the breasts forms and the hunk of dress he was holding, but finding it difficult, he turned back to the mirror.<br />
<br />
Again, another shrill, high-pitched scream escaping him, Jason stared at the smooth, flat skin, flummoxed and terrified by what he was seeing. Unable to deal with it, he started to turn away, but stopped and, after a moment&#39;s hesitation, lifted up one of his legs and placed his foot flat against the mirror. Staring at the area between his legs, scared by what he was seeing, Jason eventually shifted the dress so it wouldn&#39;t get in the way and, with one hand, began exploring his new set of genitals, but stopped after having noted that he had a clit, lips major and minor, a vagina opening, everything that a girl had, and merely stared at the whitish, pinkish area, wondering how it was possible, until a pressure on his bladder reminded him why he&#39;d come into the bathroom in the first place.<br />
<br />
Back in front of the toilet, he balked at the idea of sitting down to pee, as he realised he didn&#39;t know what to do. Hiking up the dress, Jason lifted the lid and, after thinking for a moment, straddled the toilet and, after only a second or two, relieved himself sitting down. When he&#39;d finished, he didn&#39;t move and instead thought about what had happened to him. Muttering, &quot;I fell asleep a boy, I&#39;m sure of it. But I wake a girl?&quot; he absently took some toilet paper, wiped himself, stood and flushed.<br />
<br />
At a loss how to explain what had happened, unaware that the change had begun before he&#39;d fallen asleep, Jason headed over to the sink to wash his hands. Staring at his reflection, he no longer believed that it was the dress that made him look like a girl and that his face was rounded like a girl&#39;s. Drying his heads, Jason glanced at the full-body mirror and thought he even his height looked slightly off, though he wasn&#39;t sure and would have to get a tape measure to be sure. Glancing at the bathroom scale, he wondered if his weight had also changed, but, instead of checking, he huffed and muttered, &quot;What am I going to tell mom and dad,&quot; and, as an after thought, &quot;What is April going to say?&quot; before flicking off the light, exiting the bathroom and, after deliberating on whether he should take off the dress and put on some of his actual clothes, he headed downstairs to find himself dinner.</p>
