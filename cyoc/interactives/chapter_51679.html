<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The triplets and Kaylee, the clink, Amy, Sarah and Ulysses, Zack and June, all strangely <br />
came to the Master around the same time in the office that used to be his father's and the <br />
one where Jenny and Bart and their younger siblings had been reborn as members of the <br />
pack. They had all taken precisely enough wrong turns (which was odd enough consider <br />
three of them had worked at the Mansion for years) so they all bumped into each other at <br />
exactly the same time outside Jensen's office. What was even strange was how June <br />
seemed to lose Amy's scent, back tracked, found it again, and thus wound up showing up <br />
at the same time as the others.<br />
<br />
Jensen was a little surprised to see so many outside his office door at once. June of course <br />
hugged Amy telling her not to be so disconnected with her own mother. Amy merely <br />
nodded in her mother's bossom. <br />
<br />
Amy of course wanted to speak first, before any more tragedies like ther gargoyles <br />
happened. She also didn't know what it was, but there was a faint stink in the dark. <br />
<br />
Sarah didn't know WHY she was going along with this, maybe just cause she didn't want to <br />
see Ulysses in trouble. <br />
<br />
And with the thirdteen wolves there, that was when Abbey came out of the mirror, the <br />
glass pup followed by Margot, Megan, and finally to everyone's shock, Ashley. Everyone <br />
however did quickly take note of the bruises and cuts on Megan and Margot's bodies.<br />
<br />
&quot;What happened?&quot; Jensen asked first ominously. Strangely not looking at his packmate <br />
returned to him safe and sound (which actually felt a bit confusing to him in hind sight).<br />
<br />
&quot;Blue Light Blue!&quot; Kaylee declared in amazement and happiness to see her precious <br />
packmate returned to her. Then Zack and Kaylee looked at Megan. &quot;You did it didn't you?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Did what?&quot; Jensen asked. <br />
<br />
Zack said, &quot;Megan wanted us to go AWOL and retrieve Ashley on our own Master.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What-?!&quot; Jensen said in alarm and surprise. <br />
<br />
Zack said, &quot;Megan tried to convince me, Margot, and some others that we should charge <br />
into the police station via the mirrors and smash and grab Ashley.... I thought she gave up <br />
on it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Megan said, &quot;I'll... I'll admit it was stupid, but a small group of wolves had a better chance <br />
I realized of getting through than a big one! And ... You can't argue with results!&quot; <br />
<br />
Ashley repeated, &quot;I do agree it was dangerous and reckless Master, but Megan and Margot <br />
suceeded! You can't argue with that!&quot; <br />
<br />
The triplets echoed intense, &quot;Did you put Abbey in dangerous without my permission!&quot;<br />
<br />
Megan and Margot started stepping back but Megan said in reply, &quot;Never. I gave Abbey <br />
strict instructions to NOT leave the mirror until Ashley was saved.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;And?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;She didn't leave the mirror until after Ashley was rescued I can assure you.&quot; <br />
<br />
Abbey nodded, &quot;I promise mommy I didn't.&quot; Abbey said, she was no Alice but she picked <br />
up on Megan's choice of words. <br />
<br />
Megan and Margot had both done a count in their heads, no good, thirdteen counting <br />
Jensen... Even if the Transform somehow effected the other two twins at the same time, <br />
that would still leave one would unaccounted for. <br />
<br />
&quot;Was Ashley-san hurt?&quot; Amy asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not in the least.&quot; Ashley said, &quot;The lions and police were actually very civilized. I don't <br />
think we really need to go to war with them or flee Glendale, I think we can reason with <br />
them.&quot; <br />
<br />
Julie smiled at this idea. After all, the last thing she wanted to do was have the pack fight <br />
the pride when it had people like Penny on it. True Kaylee had offered them an easy way to <br />
avoid having to take part in the violence, if it came to that it was for the good of Master <br />
and the Pack, but still, she didn't like the idea of violence... Maybe it had to do with all the <br />
medical knowledge the curse had dumped into her head. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ashley... I'm very very very happy you've been returned to us, please go outside my office <br />
until I tell you to come back in.&quot; Jensen's voice was ice cold. <br />
<br />
&quot;M-Master, why would-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I command it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ashley had a sick feeling in her gut, but knew if she refused, it would be a neon sign that <br />
something was wrong. She looked at Megan and Margot one last time and inched out of <br />
the doorless portal. <br />
<br />
She was surprised to find Anne sitting outside also. <br />
<br />
&quot;Anne?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;ASHLEY?! You're alive!&quot; Anne hugged her packmate dramatically, more than the wolves <br />
who had been in the office very strangely. In particular with how open the wolves had <br />
become about their emotions. <br />
<br />
Ashley hugged her back, &quot;It's okay, Megan and Margot rescued me.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You're kidding!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;No I'm not! But it's okay! And the lions and police aren't evil and they aren't dangerous! <br />
Before Megan and Margot helped me escape they really really seemed interested in us just <br />
peacefully co-existing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You've got to be kidding...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I swear to God I'm not.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Ashley .... I'm just... I'm just so happy you're alive... I was so scared those lions had done <br />
something to you... &quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They didn't... why are you outside Master's office?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I was going to ask for permission for me to visit a church each week while we're on the <br />
island or allow me to bring a priest into the pack. I'm pretty sure I'm the only catholic in <br />
our pack, but still... kindness welcomes all right?&quot; <br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Anne...&quot; Ashley asked, sound a little unsure of how to act around one of her pack mates <br />
still set to think like a slave and a Big Bad Wolf-supremacist.  &quot;I need to ask you... I've <br />
been wondering about something. Do you think these bodies belong to us? Or did Master <br />
murder the people who these bodies used to belong to and just created us out of the <br />
ether?&quot;<br />
<br />
Instead of being alarmed or shocked at the question, Anne looked at Ashley, and <br />
thought... and honestly did think about it. <br />
<br />
 &quot;To become a better person, is to in fact become someone else. Thus the person you are <br />
has to die. Thus, in order to be born again, you have to die. Yet those who convert others <br />
to a new theology are never called murderers, in spite of how the person from before <br />
ceases to exist. And people who become different from how they were, are not considered <br />
to have committed suicide. So I think it's rather silly to call Master such.  We aren't the <br />
same people we were when we were five, and aren't considered to stolen those bodies, <br />
and we have no more control over the outside elements that influenced who we became <br />
anymore than Master's wording of the game.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ashley thought for a moment then said, &quot;But where does free will come into the picture <br />
then?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Eh?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We're packmates so I know you won't take this the world way. But I think God allows for <br />
freedom of will in SPITE of being all powerful, then otherwise this universe would hold no <br />
meaning.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You're christian?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Prodastan.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah.&quot; Anne nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;So what's your response?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess free will is where we chose to act on that stimuli and experiences...not the stimuli <br />
and experiences themselves... Memories are just records. Senses are just information. <br />
Love is a chemical reaction. They aren't us. They're not our soul. The choice we make are <br />
what decide what they are... After all, regular triples raised together aren't like the betas <br />
really.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Right... So Anne... do you think we really have free will?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course we do, within the confines of our loyal and devotion to Master and the Pack of <br />
course, same as any civilization.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But didn't you say unless we chose to follow along with those rules then it's not really free <br />
will?&quot;<br />
<br />
Anne opened her mouth, then a deep voice came from inside the room, &quot;Margot, Megan, <br />
Transform or Dare.&quot; <br />
<br />
Ashley, and Anne, and the voice of Amy all gasped. Ashley and Anne turned to see the <br />
pastel green Roger also gasp, a look of surprise and alarm in his good eye as he had <br />
learned a short ways down the hall. What was he doing here too? Wasn't he supposed to be <br />
rest?<br />
<br />
Ashley immediately ran back in, Roger rushing in and accidently knocking her to the side, <br />
Anne was nearly knocked unconscious as Roger steam rolled past her towards his sister. <br />
He didn't even seem to notice the rescued she-wolf he was willing to die for the same as <br />
any pack mate. <br />
<br />
Megan and Margot almost felt like the words were thrown up out of their mouthes. <br />
&quot;Transform.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You've disobeyed your alpha, you've thus betrayed him, thus you've betrayed the pack, <br />
you won't be forgotten. You'll be an example. Transform into marble statues, be nothing <br />
but statues, assume a ballarina and the other an archery pose. You'll think of only being <br />
pretty beautiful statues.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;NO!&quot; Roger shouted. <br />
<br />
A passive entranced look came to Megan and Margot's eyes, a wide happy simple smile <br />
formed on their muzzles. Margot stood on the balls of her digigrated feet, and slowly rose <br />
her paws upward arching her back. Megan knelt down on one knee and positioned her <br />
arms as if she was aiming a bow, the smiles and entranced gaze never leaving her faces. <br />
Then, in the blink of an eye they were marble, in the next blink of an eye there was base <br />
with their names underneath them. <br />
<br />
&quot;ALPHA HOW COULD YOU!&quot; Roger took hold of Jensen's shoulders, what had happened to <br />
his sister shocking him, Jensen assumed he was attacking in a moment of Paranoia struck <br />
him. Roger was horried at what happened as he was struck back, avoiding the two statues <br />
by inches. <br />
<br />
Amy meanwhile stared in absolute horror, her body having gone slack and her muzzle <br />
hanging open. A strange memory she didn't remember rememebring came of a drunk <br />
brother killing two female confidents of hers... but... that never happened to her this life... <br />
but... Megan... Margot... no... please no... they were pack... like all the pack they were -<br />
family-, and ... no... <br />
<br />
Roger as he was knocked back hit Amy, knocking her out. Zack grabbed Roger intending <br />
to ask what the heck he was doing, and to stand down, but Roger, since he was just <br />
accidently knocked out Zack's child, and given Zack's incredibly had reputation among the <br />
pack, assumed he was attacking him, and returned in kind. <br />
<br />
The office quickly degenderated into bedlam, the triplets and Sarah and Ulysses quickly <br />
being dragged into it, Abbey fled into the office's mirror before it was accidently smashed. <br />
Ashley and Anne weren't sure what to do... but a strange, entrancing urge that cause all <br />
other thought to dissolve into mush came, and without being hit they simply began to <br />
drag the two statues away to the gallery were they belonged acting little better than the <br />
shadows. <br />
<br />
The curse clapped to itself. Everything had gone exactly has it had desire, it had failed in <br />
getting Lawrence into the bloody brawl, but no matter. Jensen and Kaylee would return to <br />
their Big Bad roots. They would make sure no wolf would ever defying them again. And <br />
the pride would come expecting to be greeted with open arms, and instead a bloody <br />
ambush would come forth... Oh the beautiful BEAUTIFUL MISERY!  <br />
<br />
It now but had to deal with one last loose end. <br />
