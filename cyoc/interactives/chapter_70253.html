<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Mirror, Mirror, tell me true, oh, what shall We do?&quot; the Queen asked standing in front of the polished <br />
crystal. <br />
<br />
Her reflection moved independently from her own movements.<br />
<br />
&quot;The child is a child yet.  Without Prince Charming, she cannot beget.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, Charming, heh, heh, heh!&quot; laughed the Queen. Then she commanded, &quot;Show him to me!&quot;<br />
<br />
The image in the mirror quivered hesitating, it wanted its rhyme. <br />
<br />
The Queen sighed and said, &quot;Mirror, Mirror, hear my plea, the image of Charming, let me see.&quot;<br />
<br />
The mirror positively glowed as the reflection in the glass shifted.  <br />
<br />
&quot;I cannot believe my uncle sometimes!&quot; exclaimed the prince as he strode down the stone stair and into the <br />
royal paddock. He sounded exasperated. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, sire, every young prince must have his quest and adventures,&quot; said his page in a conciliatory tone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Quest?  What quest? He just wants me out of the kingdom until that Princess Snow White is of age, and we can <br />
be wed.  Seriously, she's like ten years younger than me, though mother and father were worse,&quot; he chuckled.<br />
<br />
The Queen sighed.  She knew only too well about the prince's mother who had been placed under a dark fairy's <br />
potent spell of sleeping death for nearly a century.  Then the prince's father comes along and breaks the <br />
spell.  Technically, the prince's mother was over 100 when he was born and her consort was only 20.  At least <br />
that was the story.  She stared at her looking glass and frowned.  It had been unable to penetrate the magical <br />
aura that surrounded Prince Charming's mother, and the Queen found that disquieting.  How could she a mere <br />
mortal be shielded from the all-seeing and all-knowing mirror.  The mirror's unsatisfactory answer was &quot;Fairy <br />
Magiques Old and Powerful Conspire To Confound The Image and Knowledge which you desire&quot;.<br />
<br />
She reached for a book.  There had to be a spell or way to break through that murky aura.  She opened it <br />
casually and a piece of gossamer wing fell out.  She had forgotten about the fairies she had pressed between <br />
the book's pages. A crushed dried out green and yellow fairy crumbled and tumbled out of the book. The queen <br />
set the book down gently, and swept up the fairy dust and put it into a bottle from the same shelf as the <br />
book.  <br />
<br />
The mirror hummed.  It wanted to say something. She ignored it, and continued to study her grimoire.  The <br />
humming grew more incessant.  The image of the prince mounting up on his majestic white stallion, while his <br />
page followed with two pack mules.  They were leaving the castle.  That was good. Her ally had done well, the <br />
prince's fate would be sealed when he crossed the last bridge and entered the Dyre Wood.  The mirror hummed <br />
louder.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright!&quot; the Queen exclaimed, &quot;Mirror, mirror, tell me, do, What ever it is that you're dying to!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not your finest rhyme, my queen this time. But it will suffice for your humble device,&quot; answered the mirror.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well? What is it?&quot;  She bit her lip and glaring said, &quot;Tell me, whatever it is you're dying to!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just this oh Corinth's fairest, the spell you seek you'll find in that book ne'erest.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Never?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The spell book powerful as you are fair, cannot reveal what you seek within it, because it is not there.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright,&quot; she said alamming the tome.  &quot;No spell or cure in this book exists to penetrate Sleeping Beauty's <br />
Mists.  But somewhere in time or space, there does exist a way or place?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Tis true your highness, there is a way.  To penetrate the mists, and the rival royal family slay.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Reveal it now, ere I loose my bow,&quot; the Queen said raising a black ebony quiver.<br />
<br />
&quot;Right you are oh, noble queen, but things so delicate are not mean,&quot; the Mirror answered.<br />
<br />
The image of the prince dismounting as he leads his horse under low boughs as he and his page enter the Dyre <br />
Wood.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sometimes the meanest is the keenest, behold!&quot; the Queen cackled with glee as the page filled a goblet with <br />
the liquor the Queen had supplied the prince's uncle. <br />
<br />
&quot;Your highness is hot and thirsty?  We are far enough from the castle and onlookers, let me help you out of <br />
that doublet and give you some fine wine.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My uncle really believes that enemies plot against me, and that by going off on a quest, I will be safe from <br />
assassins?&quot; Prince Charming said lifting off his heavy gold brocade doublet, and setting it across his horse's <br />
saddle.  He takes the goblet from the page who stares expectantly waiting for his master to drink.<br />
<br />
&quot;And what's up with the king and queen? They've been shut up in the blue tower for nigh on a fortnight, and do <br />
not even emerge to bid me farewell?&quot; the prince sounds angry and swirls the wine in his goblet spilling some <br />
carelessly. The Queen and the page both wince as this happens.  The prince is oblivious, he continues, &quot;I'm <br />
surprised uncle didn't enlist the fairies to hide me. Perhaps as a stout oak or noble stallion - that's what <br />
fairies do don't they?  Transform people into things, I mean?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, and the fairies have always taken a special interest in your family and kingdom, sire. Now drink, you're <br />
spilling the nectar.&quot;<br />
<br />
The prince took a deep drink and looked up from the cup. He spoke, &quot;Nectar - as in fairy nectar?  How hast <br />
thou poisoned me and why?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;For your own good sire,&quot; the page said undoing more of Prince Charming's garments. <br />
<br />
&quot;What am I to be?&quot; the prince roared.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well,your uncle said,&quot; here the page paused as he struggled to recall verbatim the Viceroy's words. &quot;He said, <br />
&quot;In short speed, this potion will transform young Charming into a fine steed,&quot; that's what he said.&quot; The page <br />
sighed in relief as he removed the prince's surplice.  The prince's shoulders and torso were growing, as were <br />
his now gangly limbs. Fine hairs were covering all his bare skin and rapidly growing coarser.  <br />
<br />
Prince Charming tossed the goblet and its contents on the ground, and started to stroke his stallion's muzzle.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, looks like it'll be just us two studs in a bit, boy,&quot; the prince said to his horse.<br />
<br />
The page interrupted, &quot;No, sire.  Not two studs. Only one.  Your uncle explained it thusly, ahem,&quot; and he <br />
deepened his voice and quoted, &quot;You cannot have two stallions, they would fight, and we can't geld the prince, <br />
so this potion will transform him into a mare.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A mare?!&quot; exclaimed the shocked prince.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, sire, and it looks like your gender is changing before your species,&quot; the page said staring at his <br />
master's swelling breasts and deflating codpiece.<br />
<br />
&quot;NO!&quot; the prince shouted covering his chest.<br />
<br />
The page quickly pulled down the hose and codpiece to render the prince's nether regions naked.<br />
<br />
The scent of womanhood caused stirrings in the page's loins, and he licked his lips.  The prince was quick to <br />
notice the gaze and demeanor of his page change, and the tenting outward of the lad's jerkin.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't even think about it!&quot; ordered the prince in a high pitched voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;If you weren't so comely I wouldn't.  Besides, your uncle means for your stallion to stud you, so why <br />
shouldn't I have a go too?&quot;</p>
