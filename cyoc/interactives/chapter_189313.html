<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">First she needed to know why he did these things, so she asked for them. He simply replied, without lifting his head up from preparing the sandwich &quot;Well, dunno. I just thought that doing so was right. Like tying your shoes when you see that they are open, you just do so without thinking much about it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, I see,&quot; but Kimberly decided to test the waters a bit more, she knew that couldn&#39;t be all, &quot;But you just gave me your sandwich. Why didn&#39;t you tell me to prepare my own one? I mean I asked you quite harshly.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You asked? You just said &#39;Hey, brother. I am late and you still have got time to make yourself another one.&#39; but I knew what you meant and gave you my sandwich, no big deal.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; she was once again a bit confused but wanted to reassure her suspicion how it works, &quot;but then, why did you suddenly took it back and put it into a lunchbox for me? Did I say you to do so?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, no you just said thanks, but it felt off to me to give you the sandwich without putting it into a lunch box; I mean, how are you supposed to take it with you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&#39;Yes, exactly as I thought,&#39; Kimberly grinned inside her head, &#39;but I have to make it absolutely sure know, that I can control his mind for real, giving him a task that he otherwise would never do.&#39;<br />
<br />
&quot;~Timmy, get down on your knees and bark like a dog.~&quot;<br />
<br />
A second later Timmy was on his knees and began to bark, an average *woof*, like Kimberly expected.<br />
<br />
&quot;~No, higher. As if you were a Chihuahua.~&quot;<br />
<br />
Without any hesitation he changed his voice to a very high pitched and whimpering kind of bark, that Kimberly simply had to laugh at.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hahaha. ~Alright, stop now. ~&quot; <br />
<br />
Jimmy silenced but still knelt before her on the floor, looking up to her face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jimmy, what was the last thing I said?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Before you asked me this question?,&quot; Kimberly nodded her head and Jimmy went on, &quot;I think it was that you asked me why I did the sandwich into a lunch box. Why do you ask?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, nevermind,&quot; she grinned and looked down at her brother, kneeling at her feet, &quot;Oh and by the way, I like your new attitude; seems like you finally know your place.&quot; Kimberly turned her head and began to smile.<br />
<br />
&#39;It works! And just like I thought. Whenever I give him a command he will do it without remembering that I commanded it. And also when I correct his execution of my command, he doesn&#39;t remember, thinking that he made those decisions on his own. … Well, I don&#39;t know why all this excites me so much but I have to keep that going for me. (*sighing*) Haaahh, my obedient little brother… I could get used to this.&#39;<br />
<br />
She again turned towards him.<br />
<br />
&quot;~Okay. Now, whenever I call you &#39;doggy&#39; you will respond to it as if it was your name. However, no matter what I tell you to do then, you will do it without questioning. And you will also agree to those commands by saying things like &#39;Yes Kimberly&#39;, &#39;As you wish Kimberly&#39;, &#39;Whatever you say Kimberly&#39;.~&quot;<br />
<br />
He didn&#39;t react. The only thing he did was getting up from the ground, feeling a bit ashamed that he had kneeled there before her.<br />
<br />
He was just about to fix his own sandwich when Kimberly said &quot;Doggy?,&quot; he turned his head and looked at her, &quot;go into my room and put my school stuff into my bag. Then bring it down to me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;As you wish Kimberly.&quot; And without any other word he let loose of the sandwich slice and hurried up the stairs into her room.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Maybe 2 minutes later she heard steps on the stairs again, while tapping on her phone. Though it was not Jimmy but her dad that now came into the kitchen.<br />
<br />
&quot;Morning Princess.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Morning Dad.&quot; Kimberly smiled. She and her dad always had have a really good connection. Since she was young he often called her princess and until today she really likes it, especially today however even more. It gave her tingles through her entire body. And while she really liked her dad, she had to know if her powers were also working on him.<br />
<br />
While he went over to the coffee machine she untied her left shoe and got up again. Looking at her father&#39;s back while he was preoccupied.<br />
<br />
&quot;~Dad, tie my shoes. But when you do so you&#39;ll not understand why you do so and it will feel as if you couldn&#39;t control your body yourself anymore.~&quot;<br />
<br />
In a blink of an eye he turned around and walked to her, then getting down on his knees and starting to tie her shoe. However his facial expression told her, that it was very awkward for him.<br />
<br />
&quot;I am sorry Kim, I don&#39;t know why I am doing this,&quot; it was obvious that he was trying to solve this situation by overplaying it, &quot;I just thought you could need some help with your ties. Don&#39;t want you to fall as soon as you walk you know.&quot; he sheepishly laughed, but Kimberly knew that it wasn&#39;t the real reason.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh that&#39;s very nice dad, but you know I can tie my shoes myself since I was 5, don&#39;t you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes of course. I don&#39;t know why I did that, it felt very odd. As if it was a reflex or something, I just couldn&#39;t control it. So…ehm… I think I will go on with my coffee now…hehe.&quot;<br />
<br />
He turned around still a bit embarrassedly looking.<br />
<br />
First Kimberly smiled, but something felt off. Her Dad was something like a friend to her and seeing him feeling embarrassed somehow made her feel bad. <br />
<br />
&quot;~Dad, you will forget that you tied my shoe.~&quot;<br />
<br />
She didn&#39;t saw a change while looking at him from behind. However in his face the embarrassment and confusion had disappeared and he returned to his joyful attitude.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Jimmy came down and obediently gave Kimberly her bag. The tingles returned and Kimberly couldn&#39;t resists to utilize her control over him a bit more. &quot;Thank you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Then she took his cereal bowl and placed it on the floor. “~Now eat from it as if you were a dog.~”<br />
<br />
Quickly obliging he got down on his hands and knees and began licking and chewing out of the bowl just by sticking his mouth into the bowl. Kimberly could see how the milk quickly was all over the lower half of his face, and enjoyed the loud sounds of his munching.<br />
<br />
Of course also her father heard it and turned around to see, what was something she had forgot about, because of fully enjoying the view of her brother before her on the floor, her new little puppy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Kimberly, why did you tell your brother to do so? And Jimmy!? Why are you doing so? You spill the milk all over yourself… and the floor!&quot;<br />
<br />
Quickly Kimberly turned to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;~Dad, you will forget that Jimmy ate on the floor or that I commanded him to do so. Further you will not be able to sense him in anyway until he has finished eating.~&quot;<br />
<br />
&#39;That should do it&#39; Kimberly thought, though after a few moments noticed that without letting her dad suffer he could be somewhat useful for her next plans to use her powers. So she added &quot;~You will also offer me to drive me to school in your car.~&quot;<br />
<br />
Just after another blink of his eyes he happily smiling asked her &quot;Shall I drive you to school Kimberly?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh thanks dad, that&#39;s so nice of you. Why don&#39;t you already get into the car. I&#39;ll come immediately.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure. I&#39;ll just put on my work suit and drive you.&quot; And with this words he got upstairs again.<br />
<br />
Everything was perfect. Her mother was already gone to work, so she couldn&#39;t find Jimmy eating at the floor and being confused by it. Though there was one more things to check before Kimberly headed to the car.<br />
<br />
&quot;Doggy? Tell me what the last thing was you heard me say before I thanked dad for driving me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kimberly crossed her fingers and hoped for the best, otherwise things would be more complicated.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whatever you say Kimberly. You said &#39;Thank you&#39; to me, as I gave you your bag. … oh and by the way, please tell dad I am sorry. I couldn&#39;t response while I was eating but of course I will clean everything from the milk when I am done. But why did he say that you told me to do so? I wanted to eat like this myself.&quot; He said and immediately got back to munching his cereals like a dog.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I will tell him. And don&#39;t know why he thought he heard me saying this.&quot; Kimberly innocently replied.<br />
<br />
&#39;Awesome!&#39; Kimberly thought. It was even more perfect than she hoped for. &#39;It seems like when someone is under my mind control, so doing something because I commanded so, they are unable to hear the commands that I give other ones. But as Dad proved, non-controlled ones can hear and remember me giving commands to others. Secondly, even the people under my control seem to be aware of their surroundings.&#39; she assumed by Jimmy&#39;s statement of being aware of dad telling him to stop. But she wanted to gain assurance and also test if he could respond in anyway while executing one of her orders; at the moment being to eat his cereals on the floor.<br />
<br />
So she lifted her right foot and with a quick push on the back of his head she dunk him into the milk even more, which was now also covering his nose and eyebrows.<br />
<br />
&quot;Heh, stop that.&quot; he hissed, then went on eating.<br />
<br />
So her assumptions were true… now, before leaving, it was time to make him useful for herself.<br />
<br />
&quot;~After you cleaned yourself and the floor you will go up into my room and tidy it up. Then you will vacuum clean it with much diligence. After that you will wash my laundry, put them it into the dryer, fold everything neatly and put it onto my bed. Of course you will wash delicate pieces like my bras, panties and pantyhose on your hands in the bathroom tub, then air dry them. When you are done you will go into your own room and forget everything you did for me.~, ~Oh, and don&#39;t worry about school. You don&#39;t need to go there today.~&quot;<br />
<br />
In this moment Kimberly really felt the amount of power she now possessed, and she absolutely loved it. After watching her brother eat for a few moments more she got into her dad&#39;s car and waited for about a minute. Then he got in a started the engine.<br />
<br />
&quot;~Dad, before you pull out you will call the school&#39;s secretary and tell her that Jimmy is sick and can&#39;t go to school today. You will forget that you did so when you hang up again.~&quot;<br />
<br />
Her Dad did as he was told, calm and collected, as if he really thought that everything he told her was true. He also made up himself which symptoms Jimmy &#39;has&#39;, to make his story even more reliable. The secretary seemed to accept Jimmy&#39;s sick note without any problem.<br />
<br />
Then her Father drove down the garage path, when Kimberly said. &quot;Wait. I changed my mind. ~Don&#39;t drive me to school. You will drive me to…</p>

Where does she want him to drive her?</h3>
