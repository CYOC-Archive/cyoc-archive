<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ben was enjoying how these former bullies were now terrified of him and begging for mercy. He wondered who&#39;s next to be changed before he chose l the afroamerican boy. He was tall for a kid, but really skinny with no visible muscles on him. Ben smiled as he prepared his transformation.<br />
<br />
The boy felt a weird jolt run through his body as Adam glanced at him with a smirk. His entire body felt sore and stiff, as if he&#39;s frozen. &quot;What are you doing to me?&quot;<br />
<br />
Ben smiled. &quot;You&#39;ll have to wait and see. After watching your friend&#39;s transformation, I want to be a little more.. experimental with you.&quot;<br />
<br />
The boy glanced at his arms, then looked down at his body. He can notice they had started to swell with muscle. Also, the stiffness was becoming more intense like if he was turning into stone or so, he was now crying desperately. But Ben was still grinning. He tried to walk, straining with every step, just to realize that his legs had already grown big and strong like a bodybuilder&#39;s. Even his feet had grown too, they looked more like belonging to a man than a boy. But the movement was getting difficult. It felt like his knees would lock up at any moment.<br />
<br />
As everyone else were watching at him, his friends were blushing as they realized that his ass was turning into a perfect bubble butt. He wanted to look at it but he noticed that he couldn&#39;t turn his hips without moving his entire body at the same time. His legs were almost stuck in place, while his arms were difficult to move. &quot;What&#39;s happening to me? Why can&#39;t I move? Are you turning me into a statue?&quot;<br />
<br />
Ben just smiled. &quot;You&#39;re close... I was thinking that since you&#39;re already that small, I&#39;d turn you into something more suitable. Give it a few minutes and you&#39;ll get there.&quot;<br />
<br />
The boy didn&#39;t appreciate the secrecy, especially as his body was being morphed against his will. He didn&#39;t want a surprise, he just wanted to know what was happening to him. He looked down and realized that he was practically a full adult now, manhood included.<br />
<br />
However, instead of the roughness he expected, his skin did look oddly perfect and flawless, with a somewhat shiny sheen to it. With a bit of a struggle, he brought a hand up to his face. He felt unnaturally smooth. Even his newly grown stubbly cheeks had no roughness to them. It was almost like his stubble was painted onto his face. Even his hair had taken on an almost perfect appearance, immaculately styled and gelled into place.<br />
<br />
&quot;Woah, that&#39;s freaky...&quot; Richard muttered under his breath. The new man turned, having to waddle like a penguin to do so, and asked with a deeper voice, &quot;What? Do you know what&#39;s happening to me?&quot;<br />
<br />
Richard shook his head, he seemed pretty worried but not about his friend. He was worried that the same is going to happen to him. &quot;You look like a mannequin.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wha... What?&quot; The black guy waddle-turned back to Ben, unable to bend or twist his torso any longer. He slipped a stiffening arm on his belly and raised an eyebrow in surprise. His torso was perfectly sculpted and missing his recently grown coating of body hair. He stroked his abs with curiosity, cringing at the rigid, artificial feeling. It took rock hard muscle to a new meaning. He rapped a hand against his hard abs and gulped as they made a sickening hollow sound. He lifted his hand higher to check out his pecs, which looked as solid as his abs.<br />
<br />
While his newly grown chest hair had vanished, there were several cartoonish swirls spread across his pecs in a pale imitation. He wiped his hand across them, feeling nothing but that plastic-like smoothness. He tried to move his arms back down but his elbows had locked into place, and his shoulders were close to seizing up as well. Having them stuck in the air let him focus on his hands.<br />
<br />
He tried to spread his fingers but it felt they were glued together. Or he thought they were until he looked a little closer to see they had actually all merged together into one vaguely fist shaped blob. There was a noticeable seam around the sides as if his hands had come out of a mould. He tried once more to separate them but his struggle only caused them to bend inwards until it looked like he was gripping something. He watched as his wrist joints sunk inwards, a noticeable gap forming between his fist and his forearm. The same thing happened around his elbows, and presumably his shoulders. They looked like the basic points of articulation you&#39;d find on a doll of some sort. He was now desperately crying after realizing his fate. &quot;Please, don&#39;t turn me into a toy! Please! I prefer to be your slave than being a lifeless object!!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Haha, but you&#39;ll still be conscious!&quot; Ben cried out, enjoying the transformation just a little too much. &quot;You could still see, hear and feel through his plastic skin. You&#39;ll become more than a regular doll.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re going to trap me inside my own body... You describing a prison, a nightmare!! Anything was better that turning into a fucking toy!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hahaha! Maybe.&quot; Ben growled, still grinning. &quot;But I can imagine several destinies worse than this. I could have turned you into my underwear, for example.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;At least, don&#39;t make me conscious! I don&#39;t want to remember this horrible moment of my...,&quot; The black dude stopped talking he felt something happening within him, he tried to turn to look down, only to realise he could no longer move anything below the neck. He clenched his teeth and turned his head side to side, the only part that moved. He twisted it until he saw Richard, who was staring at him in complete horror. He would have raised an eyebrow in concern if his face muscles weren&#39;t beginning to freeze.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is this the end?&quot; He said as the last tears moved through his plastic face. He&#39;d twisted his head backwards, in the same position of his round butt. He tried to move his head again but the fleeting moment of flexibility had passed. He looked at Ben with pleading eyes and growled. &quot;Please... Help me!&quot;<br />
<br />
Ben stood up from his seat and smiled, &quot;Don&#39;t worry, it&#39;s almost done.&quot; The plastic guy tried to close his eyes but he was finding it difficult to even shut his eyelids. Ben&#39;s delicately twisted the guy&#39;s head back towards the front of his body. &quot;There we are!&quot;<br />
<br />
The black guy tried to say something, but his lips wouldn&#39;t move. His jaw was shut tight. His lips were pursed together, the stern pout merely moulded onto his face. His hair was a solid clump of sculpted black plastic atop his head. His eyebrows were drawn on, as were his eyes. They were no longer real, they were merely painted replicas. However, he was still able to see out of them. He was stuck looking forward, unable to swivel his eyes or even blink.<br />
<br />
Richard noticed there was a slim line around the middle of his friend&#39;s neck, the point where his head was able to be twisted and, presumably, be detached from. He shuddered from the thought of his friend getting decapitated.<br />
<br />
Suddenly the new doll felt off balance. He felt his heart jump as he fell backwards. He tried to brace for impact but none of his body reacted. He hit the table with a thwack but he didn&#39;t feel any pain. &quot;Mmmm... MMMMMM!!&quot; he mumbled aloud, he sounded really desperate.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t be scared, you&#39;d become the best looking action figure I&#39;ve ever seen.&quot; Ben lifted his new toy up by the waist. If he could tremble in his new form, he&#39;d be shaking like a tree in a hurricane. He was just an action figure now! He could feel Ben gripping him in his huge palms, his fingers pressed against the entirety of his plastic torso. It felt a lot like being underneath a duvet cover. He tried to make a sound but his voice was now a thing of the past.<br />
<br />
Ben was admiring the quality of his new toy, it looked perfect like made by a professional. He had a good shape and handsome facial structure, he even had grey cheeks to emulate an unshaven face. He delicately poked the toy in the face, afraid it may come to life and bite him. But it stayed completely lifeless. Feeling bolder, Ben held the head between his thumb and finger and gave it a little squeeze. The soft plastic deformed underneath his grip, regaining its original shape once letting go.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh man,&quot; Ben chuckled in awe. &quot;This is amazing... Are you watching this? Some of you could end up like this very soon.&quot;<br />
<br />
The remaining boys were appropriately horrified. Their friend could feel Ben&#39;s grip around his entire body. He could feel his head getting squished between his captor&#39;s giant fingers. He could even feel the soft swish of air from inside his skull as his malleable head reinflated. It was unnerving to say the least. There wasn&#39;t a drug or simulation around that could recreate such vivid feelings. He really was just a small plastic toy, held hostage to the whim of this man.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Ben was getting more daring. He rubbed a finger over the toy&#39;s hard, plastic muscles. He laughed at the fake curly hairs that were printed onto his chest. A mischievous grin spread across his face at the sight of his toy&#39;s empty crotch. &quot;Looks like you have lost more than your mobility!&quot; he said, finally erupting into a hearty laugh. If the former boy could blush, his whole body would have turned red in embarrassment. His recently enlarged cock and heavy balls had completely disappeared, leaving him with the genital-less crotch of an action figure. He felt Ben&#39;s grip tighten around his arms and torso as he laughed, but the tight squeeze didn&#39;t feel painful.<br />
<br />
Ben held the limbs in-between his fingers and moved it about, testing out the joints. &quot;Heh, my old toys never moved like this.&quot; Ben grew a little too overzealous. He gasped as he accidentally snapped the leg out of its hip. &quot;Whoops!&quot; he cried, the plastic joint dangling between his fingertips. He carried his new toy over to his desk and clumsily set him down.<br />
<br />
The man was crying out in his mind. Ben pulled off his leg! Sure, his leg was plastic, but it wasn&#39;t great! If his leg was detachable, that meant any of his joints could suffer the same fate! Now he&#39;d been dumped onto Ben&#39;s desk, surrounded by other bullies. His separated joint was clutched inside Ben&#39;s rough fist, and he could feel his tight, sweaty grip across its entirety.<br />
<br />
Ben pinned down his new toy and carefully managed to stick his leg back into its joint with an unsettling yet painless snap. He stood him back up on two feet, adjusting his pose so he could stay standing, and grinned at the naked toy. &quot;Oh man, I just got an idea. Wait here!&quot; Ben snorted at his poor attempt at humour and turned away from his desk, heading out of his room.<br />
<br />
His friends couldn&#39;t believe it. First, their friend was turned into an adult, then he was literally transformed into a play toy, and now he&#39;d been stripped and humiliated as such. They were terrified of what&#39;s coming next.</p>
