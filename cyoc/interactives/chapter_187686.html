<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After quite some time pondering, Adam chose to put the ring aside for the day. The decision was just too hard to make, and he couldn&#39;t help but feel spooked out by the permanence of the swap, a stern warning from the letter. <br />
<br />
(The next day...)<br />
&quot;What do you mean, this ring can make you swap bodies?&quot; said Lucas, one of Adam&#39;s friends. <br />
<br />
Adam and his group of friends were sitting together for lunch when Adam brought the ring to their attention. Technically, &quot;friend&quot; is not the correct term here, as Adam had trouble fitting into this group of popular kids. Adam just chose to hang out with them because they were an attractive bunch, just like Mr. Bugdale. While they were welcoming for the most part, Adam was basically the ugly duckling of this group, as he tried desperately to gain any sort of attention. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah. I got this from a guy in black at a school yesterday. The person said that it was a special ring, which was probably why everything sounded so shady.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lucas picked up the ring and eyed it carefully. &quot;Are you sure you&#39;re not messing with us? It could just be your dad&#39;s wedding ring for all we know.&quot;<br />
<br />
Adam considered pulling out the accompanying letter, but stopped short of actually doing so, remembering that the letter alluded to his obsession with Mr. Bugdale, something he definitely did not want to share with the group. &quot;Just...trust me on this. Maybe we could try it?&quot;<br />
<br />
Lucas was about to scoff when Damien, sitting adjacent to Lucas, snatched the ring and asked, &quot;Fine, how does it work?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So I was told that once you wear the ring, you have to say the full name of the person you want to swap with for three times, close your eyes, and picture the person in your head.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see,&quot; Damien nodded slowly, but his snickering undertone implied that he, too, was skeptic. <br />
<br />
Damien slowly slipped on the ring, which might have been a little tight, before chanting, &quot;Nicole Langley, Nicole Langley, Nicole Langley.&quot; He then closed his eyes, most likely imagining his hot english teacher&#39;s face. Adam couldn&#39;t blame him. When it comes to female teachers, Ms. Langley takes the cake, as she had one of the most shapely figures in the faculty. Being only 26 years old, Ms. Langley was more tender than the grouchy senior teachers, but she certainly wasn&#39;t lacking in the intelligence department. <br />
<br />
Damien squinted his eyes shut for several seconds before opening them. Lucas asked, &quot;Did...it work?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Did what work? Of course not! This is the kind of stuff you would only find in science fiction novels, or an idiot&#39;s dream. You should learn to tune out from some of his outlandish stories. Honestly, if I was in a worse mood, I would&#39;ve already tossed this ring in the garbage bin.&quot; He took off the ring with disapproval and slid it back to Adam.<br />
<br />
(After lunch...)<br />
&quot;Are you kidding me? The ring didn&#39;t work? Was it a prank all along?&quot; Adam thought to himself as he entered the restroom. Glancing at the ring, Adam did agree that it looked like a typical sterling silver ring, one you could get for a fairly inexpensive price. Even putting the ring on his finger did nothing to change his opinion. <br />
<br />
Sighing, Adam was about to admit that he had messed up once again and made himself look like a fool in front of his peers. But somehow, Damien&#39;s last words stung. They have stung before, but it hurted a lot more this time, since Adam really thought he was telling the truth. Perhaps Adam had enough, and he was not letting them get away with dismissing his words once again. This time, he was willing to do anything to prove himself. As he used the urinal, he inadvertently repeated the words that Damien spoke earlier. &quot;Nicole Langley, Nicole Langley...&quot; he began, as he closed his eyes to picture his teacher&#39;s silky pearl face. <br />
<br />
Almost immediately, he felt a pulse through his body, but it wasn&#39;t like a shiver. Instead, he felt his body go numb, like the effect from taking valium. Luckily, the feeling was evanescent, as Adam felt himself regain his composure instantaneously. Everything came to a standstill, as Adam was greeted with the whirring of the air conditioning system and a mild, beeping noise that reminds one of a machine error.<br />
<br />
Adam opened his eyes, and he was greeted with a window view of the school backyard. The beeping came from a malfunctioning printer in front of him. Adam found himself in the copy room. <br />
<br />
&quot;Huh? Why am I here?&quot; Adam asked groggily, before realizing that something was dripping down his leg. Looking down, he pressed against below his belly in an effort to cease the leak. &quot;Shit, did I just wet myself?&quot; he asked. <br />
<br />
Of course, it wasn&#39;t Adam&#39;s fault, as he was reliving himself when the change occurred. The action must have carried over to his new setting, which was obviously unprepared for it. Trying to inspect the mess he made, he tried peering down, only to be distracted by a set of DD cup boobs. The low cut, frilly blouse did not help hide this distraction. Feeling his face reddening, he continued lowering his gaze, coming face-to-face with a small wet stain on the carpet between his legs. Speaking of his legs, they were so thinner now and encased softly by brown nylon. The tight garment retained some wet streaks through the length of his legs, but they mostly reminded him of the dampness between his legs, an area that felt emptier than usual. The draft from the air conditioner made him realize that his legs were scantily covered, as the only other piece of clothing on his lower half was a tight black skirt that struggled to reach mid thigh. Briefly glancing above revealed that it was complemented with the matching black suit jacket. The lone button could barely hold together the bulging protrusions on his chest. Besides clothing, Adam could also feel that his hair has gotten longer. Much longer, in fact, that he could feel them past his waist. A few strands flew across his face, seemingly begging for him to realize that his hair is now raven-colored. And if these clues weren&#39;t enough, the orange scent constantly wafting into his nose should&#39;ve given it away.<br />
<br />
&quot;Am I....Ms. Langley?&quot; Adam asked softly. It was almost rhetorical, as his voice was one he has associated with his English class in years past. <br />
<br />
Adam proceeded to pat himself from his smooth face down to the shiny heels he was now wearing. His exploration, however, was cut short, when he heard a voice behind him. <br />
<br />
&quot;Nicole, are you done with the printer?&quot; Adam recognized the voice, as it belonged into Ms. Daniel, the blond math teacher who resembled like a soccer mom. <br />
<br />
Adam was at a loss for words, as he still wasn&#39;t accustomed, but the printer seemingly took care of that. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my god, did the printer break down again?&quot; Ms. Daniel shook her head as she stampeded to the printer. From her attitude, this was probably a regular occurrence. &quot;Ugh. Guess I have to call maintenance again,&quot; she sighed before turning back to Adam. &quot;Although I am a little surprised that you didn&#39;t try kicking the printer like you did before. I guess you learned that it wouldn&#39;t work,&quot; Ms. Daniel chuckled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, haha...&quot; Adam followed, knowing that he had nothing better to say. &quot;So, Ms. Langley has that side to her...&quot; he thought. <br />
<br />
&quot;Um... I&#39;m going to head out now,&quot; Adam started. He needed some more introspection and more pondering on his newfound ability.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure. I&#39;ll let you know when it&#39;s up and running again. See you around, Nicole!&quot;<br />
<br />
Adam waved as he stepped out. His new footwear ensured that his gait was slow, as the 3-inch heels were not doing Adam any favors.<br />
<br />
Stepping into the bathroom at the end of the hallway, Adam stared in the mirror in awe at his new appearance. As the old adage goes, seeing is believing. &quot;Wow, I really did turn into Ms. Langley. So the ring DID work after all.&quot; Adam did a slight fist pump in celebration, which looked odd with Ms. Langley&#39;s professional look. Adam couldn&#39;t help but laugh at his self-inflicted humorous scene. <br />
<br />
The laugh brought a shiver down his spine, as he was reminded once more of the wet spot in his crotch. &quot;Right, I pissed my, well, Ms. Langley&#39;s pants. I guess the ring will switch without warning, which is something I have to get used to. At least I lucked out that Ms. Daniel didn&#39;t realize the puddle on the floor back in the copy room. She was too distracted with the printer. I also suppose that Ms. Langley was lucky she didn&#39;t have a full bladder back then, or else I might&#39;ve made a bigger mess!&quot;<br />
<br />
As much as he knew he should feel embarrassed, he couldn&#39;t help but enjoy the sensation. For some reason, the wet spot felt...arousing, not just a sign that some organs were foreign between his legs. It was like pushing the right button down there, as Adam slowly felt his crotch heating and swelling.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ugh, stop it!&quot; Adam yelled at himself. Further exploration will have to wait, since he had to figure out the details of the ring. For starters, if the body swap was successful, Ms. Langley should be in his body now, and she was probably less than thrilled at this development. Also, raising his left hand revealed that the ring was not in his possession, so it must still be with his body.</p>
