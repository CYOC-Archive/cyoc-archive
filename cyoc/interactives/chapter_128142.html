Lisa fired the device again, shrinking Danica from 4&#39; 10&quot; to 4&#39; 6&quot;. Lisa would now be near a whole foot taller than her friend. She watched her friend’s body diminish. Danica&#39;s clothes definitely looked more loose and baggy than before.<br />
<br />
What a rush, Lisa thought before firing again. This time Danica went from 4&#39; 6&quot; to an even 4&#39;. Danica hadn&#39;t noticed anything amiss, probably due to the fact she was sat on the couch engrossed in daytime TV.<br />
<br />
Lisa decided to have a bit of fun with her friend. She put the device in her pocket and walked over to the couch. <br />
<br />
&quot;Mind if I join you?&quot; asked Lisa.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not at all,&quot; replied Danica.<br />
<br />
Lisa sat next to her diminished friend. Even sitting Lisa was a head taller now. Danica&#39;s clothes looked very baggy, like a young teen wearing her older sister&#39;s t-shirt and jeans. Even her socks had slipped down around her ankles.<br />
<br />
Danica looked over at Lisa, then realised she had to look up into her friend&#39;s face. Danica&#39;s brow creased as she frowned, trying to work out what was wrong.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s up?&quot; asked Lisa, knowing full well it was her that was &#39;up&#39; and Danica that was &#39;down&#39;.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not sure,&quot; replied Danica, still frowning. &quot;I think I&#39;m a little more exhausted that I originally thought!&quot; <br />
<br />
Danica looked up at Lisa.<br />
<br />
 &quot;You look....bigger!&quot;<br />
<br />
Still playing along Lisa looked down at her dwindling friend.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh nice! Just because I don&#39;t go jogging every day you think I&#39;m getting fat!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, no! I don&#39;t mean it like that!&quot; replied Dania &quot;I mean, you look...taller!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh don&#39;t be silly,&quot; laughed Lisa. &quot;People don&#39;t just get taller!&quot;<br />
<br />
Lisa looked down at Danica.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re just tired, that&#39;s all! Come here and rest you head on my lap!&quot;<br />
<br />
Lisa reached over and pulled Danica by her shoulders. Danica slipped sideways, slid her legs over the arm of the couch, and rested her head on Lisa&#39;s lap. Lisa started to massage the diminutive girl&#39;s forehead. Soon Danica had closed her eyes and was resting peacefully on Lisa&#39;s lap. <br />
<br />
Lisa took the opportunity to pull the device out of her pocket. She checked that the settings hadn&#39;t changed and then quietly fired the device at the resting girl again. <br />
<br />
&quot;Mmm, that&#39;s nice, Lisa,&quot; moaned the dwindling girl. &quot;You give wonderful head massages!&quot;<br />
<br />
Lisa smiled and continued to dwindle her friend. The thrill and excitement of slowly shrinking Danica was having its own effect on Lisa - her nipples had suddenly become very hard and erect and she felt a tingling between her legs.<br />
<br />
Danica was down from 4&#39; to 3&#39; 5&quot;. Her socked feet slipped back off the arm of the couch as she shrunk. The now very loose socks got caught on the edge of the arm and her still dwindling feet slipped out of them. Lisa admired Danica&#39;s pretty feet. Even though she was a runner, Danica had kept them well looked after. Her soles were very soft and smooth. She&#39;d had a French pedicure recently, making her toes looked very pretty. Before long the perfect little feet disappeared into the legs of Danica&#39;s jeans as her entire body was pulled into itself.<br />
<br />
Lisa continued massaging her friend’s head, while dwindling her with the device. Now down to 3&#39;, Danica looked like a little girl playing dress up in her mommy&#39;s clothes. Lisa increased the setting on the device. She wanted to shrink Danica as much as possible before Danica noticed, which wouldn&#39;t be too long. <br />
<br />
At 2 feet Danica felt strange. Her t-shirt arms felt like they were down past her elbows. She had no socks on and her feet seemed to be inside her jeans, which no longer felt like the tight, sexy jeans she wore to show off her curvy sexy figure. <br />
<br />
Danica opened her eyes and saw Lisa hide something.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, something’s wrong! What was that? Why are my clothes so baggy?&quot; <br />
<br />
Danica sat up.  Her bra slipped off her usually large D cup breasts.  Her t-shirt was hanging off her. She looked around, then Danica saw how huge Lisa looked. Danica had to crane her neck to look up at her friend sitting behind her. <br />
<br />
&quot;What..what happened to you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Lisa looked down at the tiny teen, trying to suppress a smile. <br />
<br />
&quot;Umm, I don&#39;t think anything has happened to me! But I think you&#39;ve shrunk!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What!? People don&#39;t shrink!&quot; <br />
<br />
Danica got up and swivelled around on the couch.  Her once tight jeans slipped off her legs and into a pile on the floor. <br />
<br />
&quot;What the..!?&quot; <br />
<br />
Danica slipped down off the couch, which was now quite a bit higher than normal. She stood before Lisa like a little girl wearing a large toga, as she tried to hold up her huge panties and t-shirt. <br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s happened to me?&quot; <br />
<br />
Danica started to panic.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shh, shh, it&#39;s ok little one! We&#39;ll find out what&#39;s happening, don&#39;t panic!&quot; cooed Lisa.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t panic! I&#39;m a god damn munchkin!&quot; shouted Danica.<br />
<br />
Danica turned and tried to walk away, but her feet got caught in the over sized t-shirt.  She let go of her panties, which slipped to the floor, just as she tripped over. Lisa got a nice view of diminutive girl&#39;s bare ass poking out of the t-shirt and giggled. She fired the device one last time at Danica, dwindling her to 1&#39;.<br />
<br />
Danica was in a heap on the floor, covered in her oversized t-shirt and panties, trying to climb out. Suddenly she felt something large pick her up and carry her. She squealed in fright. Before long Danica felt the giant t-shirt around her being removed.  Suddenly there was light and she could see. What she saw scared her, and Danica let out another little squeal. A giant Lisa towered over her like a 30&#39; tall giantess. Behind her was Lisa&#39;s bedroom, decorated in pink, with posters of bands, peace logos and a cannabis leaf.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shh, shh, it&#39;s OK Danica! I&#39;m not going to hurt you!&quot; whispered Lisa.<br />
<br />
&quot;W-what happened?&quot; asked Danica<br />
<br />
&quot;OK, I&#39;ll tell you. But you have to promise not to get mad! I was only having a bit of fun!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You did this to me!&quot; shouted Danica, in a mix of shock, and anger.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, but I was just playing about. And it can be reversed!&quot; replied Lisa.<br />
<br />
&quot;How did you do this?&quot; demanded Danica.<br />
<br />
&quot;I got this device this morning.&quot; Lisa pulled out the device and showed it to Danica. &quot;I needed to test it on someone, so I decided you&#39;d be my first test subject!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I thought we were friends! I can&#39;t believe you did this to me! Without my permission!&quot; shouted Danica.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know, I&#39;m sorry,&quot; said Lisa apologetically. &quot;But if I had asked, would you have let me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes....well no! I don&#39;t know! But you should still have asked,&quot; said Danica.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know, and I&#39;m sorry ... again!&quot; said Lisa. &quot;Look, all I&#39;m asking is for you to trust me and let us have some fun with this thing!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fun! How is this fun!?&quot; shouted Danica, crossing her arms.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, come on, Danica. Use your imagination! You&#39;ve always said you&#39;d like to see what it&#39;s like being inside that dollhouse you have in your room, that you spent so much money furnishing out! Just think - now you can use all those teeny tiny cups, plates, and other things you buy for it!&quot;<br />
<br />
Danica thought it over.<br />
<br />
 &quot;And isn&#39;t your favourite film &#39;Attach of the 50 foot woman&#39;.&quot; <br />
<br />
Danica nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;And you love &#39;Land of the Giants&#39;, right!&quot; <br />
<br />
Again Danica nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just imagine being able to play with a real Giantess! I can pick you up and hold you, let you climb all over me if you want! Or you can be boring, grow back to normal, and miss out on this opportunity!&quot;<br />
<br />
Danica thought it over for a few seconds, and then decided ....</p>
