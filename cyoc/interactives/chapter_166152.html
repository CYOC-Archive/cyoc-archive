<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Boots made a quiet tip-tap noise on the tile as he hastily moved across the bathroom. Scared to knock on the stall doors, Dion breathed a sigh of relief when he found that he wouldn&#39;t have to and that the three doors were already open. Relieved that he had the bathroom to himself, he turned toward the sinks and headed towards the nearest of the mirrors. Peering into the reflective surface, a girl looking back at him. he idly fingered the studs in his ears, started to touch his now long hair, but stopped at the last moment and instead looked down, thinking of what had brought him into the girl&#39;s toilet, scared at what he might find.<br />
<br />
The strange sensation had started during the drive toward church. At first, Dion couldn&#39;t figure out how to describe it, nor understand what might be going on. As they pulled into the church parking lot, he found himself worried that he might have to pee, which led him to dreading that he&#39;d have to use the girl&#39;s bathroom. Climbing out of the car, careful that his skirt didn&#39;t ride up and expose anything, Dion trudged toward the church.<br />
<br />
Inside, he was inundated by the noises as both adults and some children talked with friends and neighbours, whilst other children, mostly those that were really young, ran about screaming in joy and play. The matter almost driven from his mind, Dion refused to let it and after finding that nobody was calling him out, something that was both a relief and a mystery, he slipped off to the side. Standing by himself, waiting for the signal that class was about to begin, he tried to come to terms with what he was feeling. Certain it was in no way a need to pee, he was also sure that it was only situated in his groin and abdomen.<br />
<br />
Finding it hard to set on and describe, he thought it odd and that it was almost, but not quite a sort of ticklish sensation, mixed with a tugging and blossoming feeling.<br />
<br />
&quot;Almost like what I imagine a flower feels when it opens up,&quot; he mused to himself and hearing the call for all children to come to class, he heaved a sigh and pushed away from the wall. Wondering what was wrong with him, why his family insisted he was a girl, how it was possible that his hair had grown so long and his ears had somehow become pierced, Dion trudged to across the foyer and down the stairs.<br />
<br />
Now, as he stood in front of the mirror, a huff escaped him as he thought how the strange sensation in his groin and abdomen had slowly vanished midway through class. By the time he and the rest of the class was escorted upstairs for mid-morning services, he could no longer feel it and had started to get a sinking sensation as he thought he knew what it might mean. Turning away from the mirror, he tiptoed as fast as he could across the room and ducked into one of the stalls.<br />
<br />
Inside, he stared at the toilet, wondering what he should. Trying to decide if he should lift the skirt up and push the tight and underwear down, or simply push down on all three garments he began to worry his lip. After a moment, still undecided, scared of what he was sure he would see and find, he lifted up on the front of skirt and stared at his groin. Seeing that everything was flat, he tried to remember how much of a bulge his twig and berries had made, certain they hadn&#39;t gotten tucked back, but also feeling that they had created a noticeable bulge in the fabric.<br />
<br />
&quot;If only a small one,&quot; he told himself as he reached down and with a shaking hand, ran it over the front, then slipped it between his legs.<br />
<br />
The instant he felt the crotch portion of the panties press into the area between his legs, Dion pulled his hand away, started to stumble forwards and caught himself at the last moment. As if watching himself from a great distance away, he clutched the skirt tightly in one hand, causing the elastic band to pull tight and the garment to slip up past his waist, and with his other hand wrestled with the waistline of the tights and undies he had on. Pushing them down to about midpoint of his upper legs, he gasped out, &quot;No, no, no. It&#39;s not fair,&quot; in a whimpering tone and then sat down as he continued to stare at the smooth, flat skin and the bare hint that told him what was now between his legs.<br />
<br />
Somehow, he was certain that he was a girl and that whatever had caused him to turn into one had finished. Figuring that, except for the long hair and that he now had girl parts instead of boy parts, there wasn&#39;t really that much difference between a boy and girl, Dion thought angrily, &quot;Dammit. I do not want to be a girl,&quot; as he thought his height, four foot four, hadn&#39;t change, which he based on Holly&#39;s height when she&#39;d been ten, then wondered if his weight had dropped, increased, or remain the same. Standing, pulling up the tights and underwear, disliking how they felt pressed into his privates, now betwixt his legs, and adjusting the skirt, he exited the stall and headed back to the sink.<br />
<br />
As he stood before it and washed his hand, he muttered a bunch of different words, the cursed, &quot;Dammit,&quot; before exclaiming, &quot;I even sound like a girl,&quot; and drying his hands, he wondered what he had done to be deserve being turned into a girl.<br />
<br />
Unsure, he exited the bathroom and aware of how he was walking, the way he stood, his posture, he found he wanted to cry as none of his was like a boy. Finding his parents, wondering if they would be leaving soon, Dion listened half-heartedly as his mom told him, &quot;Why don&#39;t you go outside and see if any of your friends are here. Your father I want a chance to catch up with the Pearsons and Donalds before we go,&quot; and giving her a nod, Dion turned and ambled away.<br />
<br />
Outside he stopped and looked about. Seeing the boys roughhousing and carrying on, he wished he could go over there and do the same. But looking down at what he was wearing, knowing what he had become, Dion knew he couldn&#39;t at the moment and turning away, he began to meander. Seeing a number of girls, all in different groups, each talking in animated tones, he thought about joining them, then changed his mind. Not wanting a reminder of what he had become, he wanted away.<br />
<br />
His thoughts drifted for some time and as he walked, he asked himself, &quot;If I turned into a girl, could I turn back,&quot; and reaching down to scoop up a piece of leather he thought was off an animal harness from when the church had their fair, he mulled over how it was he had become a girl and how it might be possible for him to become a boy again.</p>
