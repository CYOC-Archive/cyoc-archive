<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It took me much longer than usual to fall asleep.  Even when I did I was extremely restless.  I kept finding <br />
myself in the middle of dreams that were disturbing, depressing, or worse.  Most of them involved some kind of <br />
unpleasantness between me and Nicole.  Some of them involved Nicole dying in some form.  Each one of those <br />
immediately jarred me awake.<br />
<br />
I had one of those dreams and my eyes immediately opened.  I found that I was laying on my side and looking <br />
directly at my alarm clock.  It indicated that it was 3:45.  Terrific, I thought, a night with no sleep.  I <br />
was about to roll over on my other side when something felt amiss with my bed.  There was extra weight on my <br />
blankets which prevented me from shifting positions.  I tried to focus my eyes as best as I could.  My blurry <br />
eyes cleared up enough to reveal Nicole sitting on the edge of my bed.<br />
<br />
I was startled and sat up immediately.  Even though she was sitting on the bed, she had her back to me, as if <br />
she didn’t want to face me.  I noticed that she was wearing a robe of some kind.  Then her soft voice said, <br />
“Joe, I…I’m sorry.”<br />
<br />
“I haven’t been able to sleep anyway,” I mumbled.  My voice was groggy and barely intelligible.<br />
<br />
“I couldn’t either,” she said.  “That’s not why I’m sorry.”<br />
<br />
“Then what?” I asked.<br />
<br />
She turned around and faced me.  “I’m sorry for everything,” she said.  “I’m sorry for lashing out at you.  <br />
I’m sorry for hating you.  I’m sorry for…for…for fucking you.”  Her voice cracked at the end.  Again she <br />
sniffled and wiped at her eyes.  I almost made a wish for her to stop crying, but as I realized what words ran <br />
through my thoughts, I caught myself.<br />
<br />
“Why should you apologize?” I asked.  “Did I stop you?”  I wanted her to return to herself.  This wasn’t like <br />
her at all.  I didn’t want her to blame herself.  No matter what she might have felt, I must have felt it too.  <br />
Otherwise there was no reasonable explanation for me letting her do what she did.<br />
<br />
“But I forced myself on you,” she said.  “It’s…unforgiveable.  It’s not normal, it’s not right.”<br />
<br />
“Then why?” I asked.  “Why did you do it?”<br />
<br />
“Because I…I couldn’t help myself,” she said.  “Every reasonable and logical part of me kept screaming ‘No!’ <br />
but I ignored it.  I let my desires run away with me.”<br />
<br />
I didn’t want to make her feel like I was interrogating her.  But I just had to know what she thought and why <br />
she did this.  So I asked, “How long have you had this desire?”<br />
<br />
“I don’t know,” she said.  “I don’t think until recently.”<br />
<br />
“After Dad died?” I asked.  <br />
<br />
She nodded.  “My life has felt so meaningless since then,” she explained.  “The only times I’ve felt good have <br />
been when I’m with you.  We’ve been so close since we were kids and…I know we understand each other.  I go on <br />
all these dates and all I do is compare them all to you.  This one isn’t as funny as Joe.  This one isn’t as <br />
sensitive.  This one is just a total asshole.  Everything keeps coming back to you.  So it just hit me.  I <br />
love you.  I need you.”<br />
<br />
I was amazed.  It seemed that she never had serious relationships for the same reason that I never did.  She <br />
compared any guy she went out with to me, just as I compared all the girls I went out with to her.  That was <br />
too big a coincidence.  How could we both behave the same way unless there was something else?  Was this all a <br />
product of how we grew up together, how we depended and relied upon each other?  Was this because of the jokes <br />
and games we played?  <br />
<br />
She was waiting for me to say something to her.  I felt myself beginning to sweat, even though I wasn’t <br />
wearing a shirt and it wasn’t particularly warm in my room.  I was sweating because I just had too many damned <br />
thoughts running through my head.  They pulled me in all sorts of directions but they all came to the same <br />
endpoint.<br />
<br />
“Nicole,” I said.  “You know I never meant to hurt you.  You know I never would.  I tried to handle it as best <br />
as I thought I could.”<br />
<br />
“Joe, look, we’re past that now,” she said.<br />
<br />
I held up my hand and she stopped.  “What it did was get me to thinking,” I explained.  “My only thought as I <br />
walked home after doing that was about you.  About us, really.  My first thought was that I hoped you would <br />
have a good date.  But it got me to thinking about what we’ve done since Dad died.  I thought about all the <br />
dates I’ve been on and I realized why none of them went very far.  None of them were you.  We’ve rejected <br />
everyone else because they aren’t who we want them to be.”  I took a deep breath.  “When we…well, you know…it <br />
just felt…right.  It felt natural to me, like it was supposed to happen that way.  It was as if we fit <br />
together like two halves of a whole.”  I reached out and gently stroked her cheek.  “I need you.  I love you,” <br />
I said.<br />
<br />
She took my hand and kissed it softly.  “You know what this means?” she asked.<br />
<br />
“I do,” I said.  “But I don’t care.”<br />
<br />
She stood up and unfastened her robe.  She slid it off her shoulders and let it fall to the ground to reveal <br />
her naked body.  I smiled at her and stood up as well.  We kissed each other as I pressed my body close into <br />
hers.  She moved her hands to my hips and slipped her hands under my shorts so that she could remove them.  <br />
<br />
We got back on the bed and this time we assumed a more traditional position with me on top.  We made slow <br />
passionate love, quite different from our first encounter.  It ended with both of us climaxing at the same <br />
time.  This time there was no pulling out either.  If we had crossed a line in our first session, we now moved <br />
so far past it that it ceased to exist.<br />
<br />
After I positioned myself back on the bed we found ourselves staring into each other’s eyes with slight smiles <br />
on our faces.  Nicole proceeded to ask, “So what else can this ring of yours do?”</p>
