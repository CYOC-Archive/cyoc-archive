<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ty stumbled backwards in surprise, but he caught himself and raised his hands. &quot;I won&#39;t fight, I won&#39;t fight!&quot; He cried out, dropping to his knees to make himself look smaller. &quot;Please...please don&#39;t kill me...&quot; His voice dropped to a whimper slightly as the huge wolf in the lead approached him. It was an alarming sight- the wolf was practically the size of a horse, and clearly bore the power to take Stella down in a single hit. The weak magic at his disposal would do nothing to hit a monster like that.<br />
On the wolf&#39;s muzzle there appeared to be what was practically... a grin? Between his telepathic abilities and that lifelike smirk on his monstrous fangs, he appeared to have the intelligence of a human. What he did next, though, made it clear he was just as feral as he initially appeared. <br />
&quot;Humans give much better blowjobs, you know.&quot; The voice in Ty&#39;s mind was low and husky, but it was accompanied by the audible sound of a pleased growl in the wolf&#39;s chest. &quot;Maybe it&#39;s those pathetic, tiny teeth. And I love the feeling of fingers around my knot...&quot; The wolf strode forward with swagger in every heavy step until he stood nose-to-nose with Ty, with his hot breath stroking the wizard&#39;s cheeks. &quot;Tell you what? You suck me off, and maybe some of my boys, here, too... and I&#39;ll let you go in the castle. First one in a hundred years.&quot;<br />
<br />
It appeared like a choice, but it wasn&#39;t. That cruel look in the monster&#39;s eyes made it clear that his initial threat stood. If Ty didn&#39;t submit, he would be maimed and transformed. With that in mind, Ty dropped to his knees and crawled forward, until his entire body stood kneeling beneath the monster&#39;s chest, though he did have to duck down a bit to make it happen. Ty looked up from the ground to find himself face-to-face with the wolf&#39;s sheath. Immediately, his nose wrinkled at the strong scent. It wasn&#39;t bad or unpleasant, necessarily, but unfamiliar and very unexpected. If he had to describe it, it would be somewhere in the triangle of smoky, musky, and spicy, though even that didn&#39;t cover it.<br />
He didn&#39;t have much time to contemplate it, anyhow. The wolf shifted his weight onto his left forepaw and moved his right down to his sheath, shaking up his package and coaxing his cock into the light. As it unsheathed, Ty let out a small gasp of surprise. He tried to crawl back slightly to give himself space, but the wolf&#39;s massive paw abruptly landed on his small ass, holding him still. The canine cock quickly emerged to its full size, almost a foot in length and horribly thick. Purple veins ran along the scarlet skin, from the small tapered tip to the bulbous knot close to the base. As it emerged, the cock slapped lightly against Ty&#39;s cheek before he recoiled, and just for a second, he felt the powerful heat of that shaft, and it send a shudder through his body.<br />
The grip of the paw on his asscheek tightened, forcing Ty to lean forward. Knowing his life and freedom were on the line, he let the thick tip slip into his mouth, tonguing the cockhead somewhat reluctantly. At the same time, he reached up with one hesitant hand, gently stroking the underside of the beast&#39;s heavy balls. Immediately, the wolf thrust his hips forward, driving his monstrous shaft straight down into the wizard&#39;s throat. Ty choked and coughed in surprise, but couldn&#39;t resist as the red rocket drove straight forward. His lips kissed the base of the knot, which was undoubtedly far too big to take, no matter how rough it got. Without giving his new toy any time to adjust, the canine began to thrust heavily.<br />
Ty simply squeezed his eyes shut and tried to keep his choking under control for a steady airflow. Furry balls slapped against his chin and a knot repeatedly hit his nose almost enough to bruise, but by some miracle, he kept conscious. After some time of this rough thrusting, the wolf pulled almost his entire shaft out from Ty&#39;s throat and left only the very tip between the wizard&#39;s pursed lips. The canine cock throbbed, and cum poured out in powerful jets, quickly painting and filling his throat. Ty coughed and pulled away from the fountain of cum, which soon covered his face and shoulders in the sticky fluid. <br />
<br />
The next hour or so of harassment felt like twenty for Ty. Mere seconds after the alpha pulled out, he was replaced by an equally eager wolf. Ty gave blowjobs to every no less than five of the beasts. Some pulled out to give him a facial, and others deepthroated him and pumped even more cum down his stomach. All were rough, and none cared for his well-being.<br />
Then, at the blink of an eye, it was over. The last wolf stepped aside, and the alpha returned to stand in front of the young mage. &quot;You kept up your end of the deal. We keep ours.&quot; His voice was a startle after an hour of silence, but Ty didn&#39;t even bother to respond. He coughed up some blood, and took a few minutes to try to wipe his face clean of wolf cum. It was only when he looked up again that he saw most of the pack had cleared out, and the last few stragglers were dragging Stella&#39;s new wolf body away.</p>
