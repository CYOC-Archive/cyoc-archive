<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff thought of what he would want to become for Christmas.  Being Santa or Ms. Clause would be an obvious choice.  And the idea of a Reindeer or a Christmas Tree is also too easy to decide.  Jeff wanted to become something unexpected, something random, something that no one would see coming.  He soon made quite a decision that would be completely unique.<br />
<br />
He want to be a candy cane!<br />
<br />
Yes, it&#39;s weird to think about it.  But in Jeff&#39;s perspective, he always loves candy canes during Christmas season.  Whether it be tasting the minty flavor, or to see it hung on the tree, he always loves to see candy canes around the holiday season.  In face, there is one time at a play that he was dressed up as a Candy Cane based when he was young.  It makes him want to feel like he would be an actual candy cane, to either be hung or to be tasted.  And with the Chronivac in his possession, he has his chance in becoming a delectable decoration.  Licking his lips, he said to himself, &quot;Time to become a sweet treat for the holidays.&quot;<br />
<br />
Selecting that option, he soon noticed an information bar where he needs to start inputting his profile before initiating the changes.  Knowing this is a setback, he decided to continue with his plan and inputted not only his information, but how his change in being a Candy Cane would be about.  Once done, he skimmed through it to see if he didn&#39;t make any mistakes.  It reads like this...<br />
<br />

<br />
Looking into his stats, he knew what he was planning.  He will spent the first five minutes changing into a candy cane followed by an hour staying at a treat to get the feel of one.  Once the hour is up, he will have another five minutes in reverting back to normal.  That way, there is time before his own family would know that they have gone missing.  Jeff even set certain parameters that will make him believe he is an actual candy cane.  After all, a candy like that couldn&#39;t think like a human, let alone wear clothes.  It needs to be lifeless both physically and mentally.  In short, Jeff would be just a simple Candy Cane with no heart or soul.<br />
<br />
After he finished skimming through, he knew that he was ready to become what he likes in all of Christmas.  A simple, yummy, piece of candy.<br />
<br />
&quot;All right, looks like everything is ready.  Just need to hit the submit button and I&#39;ll become a Candy Cane in no time.&quot; he said with anticipation.<br />
<br />
Hover the pointer over to the submit button, he clicked on it and was ready to experience his change.  But just as he did that, a warning window appeared that said...<br />
<br />
‘Warning: You are about to be transformed into an inanimate object.  By agreeing to be changed, Chronivac Technology isn’t responsible for damage and/or death of the target.  Do you wish to continue?’<br />
<br />
Below it is a Yes/No option, wanting him to continue or not.  Seeing this, Jeff sighed and said, &quot;Seriously?  A stupid warning message?  That&#39;s so lame.  As much as I understand the risk, this is my opportunity in becoming a literal Candy Cane.  Besides, it&#39;s not like my family will be checking in on me for over an hour or nothing.  Let&#39;s get to changing!&quot;<br />
<br />
Clicking on yes, another message appeared that said...<br />
<br />
‘Thank you for choosing the Chronivac 4.0.  We hope you will enjoy your new transformed self.’<br />
<br />
He soon saw a new window giving the timer of the change and a progress bar below it.  The timer started to tick down from 5:00 to 4:59 as the progress bar was up to 1%.  Jeff smiled and knew what was happening.  &quot;Looks like the changes have started.&quot; he said with anticipation.  Leaning back on his gamer chair, and looked up and said, &quot;Now to wait and see what happens.  I mean, I&#39;m going to be an actual Candy Cane for crying out loud.  That would- *yawn* That would be so sweet.&quot;<br />
<br />
As he was saying that, he felt a little tired as fatigue was taking over.  Jeff&#39;s eyes were starting to get droopy as he yawned once more.<br />
<br />
&quot;Man...  Am I...  *Yawn*  Am I getting sleepy...?  I never felt this tired since my first orgasm two years ago...  I...  *Yawn*  I need to rest...  But...  *Yawn*  I can&#39;t sleep...  Not now...  I need... *yawn*  Need to see the changes...  Can&#39;t... <br />
*Yawn* Sleep now...&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff was trying his best to fight off the Sandman&#39;s power, but it was impossible.  He could feel his strength and energy leaving him as his body was slumping down his gamer chair.  With his eyelids getting heavy, he watched the blurry screen of both the timer and progress bar only up to thirty seconds.<br />
<br />
With his yawns getting longer and his words getting slurrier, Jeff was loosing his battle and muttered, &quot;Can&#39;t...  Stay...  Awake...  Must...  *Yawn*  Rest...  Maybe...  A...  Few...  Minutes...  *Yawn*  Night...&quot;<br />
<br />
After one long yawn, Jeff gave up the battler and slumped on the gamer chair.  With his head turned, he was fast asleep as he dreamed of Candy Canes dancing around his head.  What he didn&#39;t know is that the Chronivac was starting to do it&#39;s work on him as the program put him into a deep sleep.  But that was already to beginning as the program continue to do the request he made.<br />
<br />
While he was sleeping, Jeff&#39;s breathing starting to slowing down while his heart was beating at a slower pace.  To Jeff, it would mean he was in a deep and restful sleep.  But what the Chronivac is really doing to him was slowly shutting off his vital organs.  After all, inanimate objects shouldn&#39;t be alive at all.  And with him becoming a Candy Cane, that is no exception.  Jeff&#39;s breathing and heartbeat was getting slower and fainter as his body was starting to get limp and lifeless.  Pretty soon, he breathed his &#39;last&#39; breath while his heart beat it&#39;s &#39;last&#39; beat as all other bocily functions ceased.  Even his brain was stopped working as his dreams were cut short and all of his senses were nulled.  In short, Jeff is technically dead as his lifeless corpse lay limp on the gamer chair.  Once his body is inoperable, the Chronivac soon begin the next phase and starts to remove the one thing that will prevent the change, his own clothing.<br />
<br />
Moving onto the next phase, Jeff&#39;s clothes were slowly deteriorating away so that the body will change easily without any clothy obstacles in the way.  Starting at the feet, the laces of his sneakers begin to untie themselves until they grow smaller, going through the holes until they vanished completely.  Then the stitches unstitch themselves and the soles around his feet curled up and exposed his socks, sinking right up into the soles.  And then the soles begin to shrink under his feet until they disappeared completely.  Once the shoes were gone, his socks were next to go at the tips unravel to expose his toes and traveling up his feet.  As soon as they were got, the seams of his blue jeans were unraveling as well and traveled up his legs.  Reaching the top, the zipper lost it’s metal and the button grew smaller until it popped out of existence.  The belt then got affect as the buckles separated and the ring around it split and shrank while the pointer shrunk as well, vanishing completely.  The belt itself soon shrank by itself while the little holes disappeared one by one.  It spread around his waist until is disappeared into the ether.  With his pants gone, his shirt was next as the bottom seems of his waist and upper arms unravel and spread up his chest and shoulders before that too was long gone.  His watch he had one was affected as well as the hands on them shrank and sucked in while the surface of the watch crumpled and was removed.  The gears soon disappear one at a time until it was bare and the ring around it lessened from the inside and wiped away.  The leather straps of the watch soon unravel from the spot where the watch was and the buckle end did the same way as the pant’s belt, leaving his wrist armless.  The only thing that was left were the boxers he had on until it too unstitched itself and vanishes away, exposing his penis and rear.  Now a lifeless Jeff was fully naked, making him look like he died by masterbating on the computer.  But that scene won&#39;t last.<br />
<br />
Once the clothing was out of the way, the actual changes commences.  Starting with the feet again, the toe nails started to suck up into his skin as the toes themselves drew closer together and merged into one stub on each foot.  Then, the knee bones cracked, forcing the legs themselves to lift upwards and are evenly aligned with the thighs.  It was then that the legs themselves drew closer together and once they touched, melt and merged with each other as the bones and muscle tissue dissolved away and solidify from within.  The merged legs soon took shape and gain a cylinder mass with a flat bottom.  That would be the base of the candy cane.  When the changes reached his thighs, his penis and balls started to shrivel and sink into his skin, melting away into complete nothingness.  The same can be said with his butt as his ass crack got zipped up and sealed the anus, leaving him without butt cheeks to begin with.  When those were gone, his hips compressed and rounded, matching the same shape as the base.  This back soon begin to crack and straighten the slouched body, leaving Jeff in an awkward position on the chair.  Once it was straightened out, his arms were next to go.  Like with his feet, his fingers nails sunk into the skin.  But unlike his feet and legs, the arms and hands were rising up into upper body, getting shorter and thinner.  It was to the point where his fingers grew tiny and sunk into his smaller hands.  The shortening arms went up to his shoulder blades and sunk right into the body, leaving Jeff completely armless.  that soon led to his shoulders rounding and smoothing over.  The body soon started to deflate and rounded into the same shape like the base as the nipples were assimilated and the belly button filled in.  In his body, all the vital organs dissolved away as the cavity was filling up leaving behind no trace of any insides.  With most of the body looking like a cynlinder shape, only thing left of Jeff is the head.  It started with the neck inflating and sharpening into the same cylinder mass.  This in turn lead to his esophagus expanding, sealing off his throat.  Pretty soon, his head was the last thing to go as parts of his face disappearing.  The hair on top of his head shrank up the top of his head and left him completely bald.  His eyes automatically close and zip up with the lashes sinking into the skin, eyebrows thinning and vanishing, earlobes growing smaller to nothing and the holes sealed shut, nose flattening and the two nostrils closing, and lips getting ironed out and the mouth sealed shut.  With his head completely featureless, it soon compressed and thinned, sharpening into a cylinder and became the top part of the candy cane.  That top part started to automatically bend into a 180 degree angle and leaving a fold at the top.  Pretty soon, Jeff became a human sized candy cane made of flesh laying awkward on the gamer chair.<br />
<br />
With the changes wrapping up, the peach skin of the Candy Cane was getting drained of it&#39;s color, looking paler and paler.  In a matter of moments, the complexion was completely white as the texture was hardening and gain a shine.  Then two red strips appeared and wrapped around it, one coming down from the top, the other rising from the bottom.  The two joined together before going the opposite direction.  Once the stripes reached their designated spots, it was clear that it was just a big Candy Cane laying on the chair and not a teenage boy.  But that was going to change as the last thing that happened.  The Candy Cane started to shrink on the gamer chair until it was an actual size, leaving it laying on the chair it sat on.<br />
<br />
By the time the timer reached zero and the progress bar reached 100%, the changes were done as a new message appeared, saying...<br />
<br />
&#39;Transformation complete!  Enjoy your change!&#39;<br />
<br />
A new timer soon appeared, marking the duration of the change.  Once the time started in 1:00:00, it soon ticked back to 59:59 and then 59:58, meaning it started the duration.<br />
<br />
Within five minutes though, Jeff became nothing more then a lifeless candy cane, just like he dreamed of.  The only problem is that he cannot think, nor feel, as he set the program to not only remove his mental capacity, but also leaving him with no awareness.  Because of this, he was left to remain where he was for a full hour until he can change back.  And for an inanimate object, an hour would be forever.  All he hopes, if he can think, is that no one comes into his room and see him in that state, or if something bad happens to the program.  For now, all Jeff can do is lay on the gamer chair and look tasty.</p>
