<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Karyu&#39;s rage almost reached its boiling point, he felt like he wanted to take flight and burn down all of the inhabitants of the kingdom of Valarius, but then something struck him. The citizens weren&#39;t born with the disloyalty, no... The Cultists plagued the kingdom, they were pests, they were destroying resources, civilizations, families... The word &#39;family&#39; kept circling around Karyu&#39;s head, he feared the worst for his Rider and lover, Luka. He feared the worst for his close friends, Avelia, Vaestro, Vrackie and Anija. The cultists harmed all of them in a way or the other, Anija even told him when the crew entered the kingdom that she could feel the pain of every citizen, most of them hated the Cultists, they hated their leader for following their commands, but the citizens couldn&#39;t protest, nor could the guards, because if any madman who followed the leader who willingly surrendered to the Cultists with the promise of strength and wealth, would hear those words coming out from the lips of any citizen, that certain citizen would instantly be placed down under the guillotine, Karyu could even see the fear in most of the eyes of the citizens of Valarius.<br />
<br />
Karyu&#39;s rage for the unloyal quickly shifted into rage for the cultists, the fact that they were alive, the fact that they were still existing made Karyu slowly enter a blind rage, the Heart of Apollyon disapeared, its powers becoming one with Karyu&#39;s, he went towards a small pond near him, looking at his reflection, evil black demonic scales adorned most of his body, the soft cream scales that covered his chest and neck changed into dark red ones, yet they were still soft, diabolical bat like wings adorned his back, the tip of his tail developed a sharp axe like head, his horns changed into long diabolical ones, its texture changed resembling crystals that were shaped into horns, the color resembling the same coloration the Heart of Apollyon had, Karyu&#39;s tender bronze eyes changed into evil blood red eyes.<br />
&quot;They will pay...&quot; Growled Karyu, with an eldritch voice, the new demonic dragon spreaded his wings, taking flight towards a village completly populated by people who willingly followed their blind leader and Cultists.<br />
<br />
Eventually Karyu reached the village, which didn&#39;t resmble like one at all, Karyu was on the tallest building of the village, his scales completly cloaking him from view, his eyes resembled stars adorning the night sky, this didn&#39;t stop some of the citizens to see him, after a few seconds most of the citizens grouped up in one spot, looking at Karyu, who laid motionless, Karyu could hear the voices and the thoughts of the citizens, then suddenly, Karyu shot a fireball in the sky, erupting like a volcano as smaller fragments of flames rained down, multiple screams filled the air as the citizens ran in panic, while Karyu&#39;s flames feasted on the buildings and the bodies of the citizens.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Luka was laying on the couch waiting impatiently for her dragon to arrive, she took small sips from a glass of wine in attempts to calm down her thoughts of fear, she looked at a pocketwatch that Elisa recently gifted to her, thirty minutes have passed since Karyu went inside the forest, this made Luka more stressed, Luka went towards the balcony and looked outside, she saw smoke and fire deep in the forest, her lips started trembling, &quot;Karyu!&quot; she shouted as Luka went to her room, quickly putting on an evening dress and a pair of sandals, and quickly went outside heading towards the forest, Luka ran as if she was being chased by a wild animal, fear completly taking control of her mind, did the cultists cast a spell that made the forest emit that evil source of magic that Karyu felt? Did they capture him? Were they torturing him for information? Luka kept running, faster and faster, she ignored the sharp branches scratching her arms, legs and face, the only thing that mattered was to find Karyu. Little did she know that her own dragon was reponsible for the inferno.<br />
<br />
Only three minutes have passed, and Karyu completly engulfed the village on fire, most of the houses burnt on the ground, only ashes remaining, the corpses of the citizens laid on the ground, darkened due to the flames, some of them were still burning, Karyu flew around the destroyed village checking for any survivor, an evil smile formed on his scaled lips as he watched the bright flames burning.<br />
Meanwhile, Luka barelly arrived at the village as she covered her nose and mouth with her hands to avoid breathing in the smoke, in the corner of her eye, she could see and black and red figure flying throughout the sky, she looked around trying to identify the figure, until she saw the figure, it was a black and red dragon, flying through the sky, circling the destroyed village, while looking at the dragon, she realized something, it almost resembled Karyu! At first she thought that the smoke was playing tricks on her, but she got a better glance at the dragon, it indeed resembled Karyu.<br />
&quot;K-Karyu...?&quot; Asked Luka quietly, as she kept looking at the dragon flying through the sky, the dragon&#39;s head was raised a little.<br />
&quot;KARYU!&quot; Shouted Luka, fully grabbing the dragons attention, who looked at her, Karyu&#39;s rage instantly disapeared as his heart dropped, how was he gonna explain this to Luka?<br />
<br />
Eventually Karyu landed close to Luka, with a sad look on his scaly visage, &quot;Karyu... Is that you?&quot; asked Luka, as she looked like she was about to break into a sob, &quot;Y-Yes, it&#39;s me.&quot; said Karyu, with the same eldritch voice, this scared Luka a little as she fell into her knees, breaking into a sob, Karyu felt even worse, &quot;Please... Luka, stop crying!&quot; begged Karyu as his voice became weaker, Luka stopped for a second as she looked at him, &quot;Why... Why did this happen to you?!&quot; asked Luka as she looked at Karyu&#39;s red eyes, &quot;I-I will explain to you what happend, but please let&#39;s get out of here.&quot; said Karyu as he let Luka mount him, flying back into the rented house.<br />
<br />
Shortly after, Karyu explained what happend, &quot;I think one of the magical artifacts did this...&quot; said Karyu as he looked at his demonic claws, Luka ran her hand across Karyu&#39;s new scales, they didn&#39;t feel as soft as before, they were also warm, not a threatening warmth but a friendly warmth, even with a changed form, Luka could still see her lovely dragon, Karyu quickly laid his snout on Luka&#39;s lap, making himself sure that he didn&#39;t harm her with his new long crystaline-looking horns, &quot;Luka... I&#39;m so sorry, i shouldn&#39;t have let rage get the most of me, i shouldn&#39;t have burnt down that village, please forgive me!&quot; begged Karyu, awaiting for the cold judgement of his Rider, who instead patted him, &quot;Don&#39;t worry, everything&#39;s alright, besides, that village was supporting the cause of the Cultists.&quot; said Luka, &quot;But please try not to do that again.&quot; finished Luka, as she gave a cute kiss on Karyu&#39;s forehead, who smilled in return.</p>
