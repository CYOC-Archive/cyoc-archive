<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“… Let’s go ahead and let the beast out!” He moaned in a seductive and sensual whisper directly into Paul’s ear.<br />
<br />
Paul moaned and shivered as his hot breath bathed his sensitive flesh that was tingling and growing in intensity. He could feel his body giving way to whatever this stranger was helping to bring out in him, but Paul was incredibly curious to know exactly what he was becoming.<br />
<br />
“So… stranger… what do you mean ‘let’s go ahead and let the beast out’? Also, I never did catch your name.” Paul moaned slightly and huffed as he felt a searing hot sensation build at his heart.<br />
<br />
“Oh Paul… I am sure by now you can feel an animal lurking inside of you, pacing back and forth, waiting to be released. Can’t you?” The man said as he circled around Paul, deftly and lightly brushing the flesh of his neck sending waves of pleasure to his brain.<br />
<br />
“Y-yeah… I can.” Paul stammered, “When the blood from my broken gums pooled in my mouth, I reveled in how it not only tasted… but how it made me feel!” He finished answering in a slight growl.<br />
<br />
“Yeah… and I bet you’d like to have more… wouldn’t you?” The man asked with a sly grin on his face.<br />
<br />
“I would… just the thought of it is making my insides burn with this strong hunger!” Paul moaned a bit louder.<br />
<br />
“That’s it Paul, let your beast out to play! Though I do know what lives inside of you, as it does me, but there is more to it. It’s something dark… something sinister and evil. Though… that’s good! As I have been at this for a while, living on Pleasure Island for a very long time, I’ve been this way so long that I have seen almost every type of change that could happen here, but you are something new!” He said as his lips pulled into a sinister sneer, pleased with what was happening. “Oh… and before I forget, my name is Blake.”<br />
<br />
“So then… Blake. Tell me, what are we?” Paul said as his mind and body gave in further to the beast within, not caring any longer about his thick, throbbing cock out for Blake to enjoy visually while he licked his own lips in hunger as he quickly looked down and watched the pre drip from his own thick slit.<br />
<br />
“I guess I can spoil the surprise because you are already showing signs of what I initially thought was happening to you… a brother of mine in species.” Blake said growling at the end; his eyes locked onto Paul’s face as he watched it puff up slightly while his face grew hairier, sporting a nice dusting of beard growth.<br />
<br />
Paul just grinned at Blake, curious to know, but not really caring. He felt good… better than he had ever felt in his life. Paul could tell that all of the cares of the world and humanity had nearly faded away from his thoughts. It was such a freeing experience, but at the same time he could feel a heat… a darkness begin blossoming within his being. He could feel his desire for what he wanted intensify even further as a craving for blood clung to his pallet, but he also lusted for the massively thick cock attached to Blake’s pelvis. The entire time, Blake had been watching Paul as the changes slowly took hold and manifested in him. His claws were pushing out from his nail beds; his fingers and palms became slightly thicker and darker; his ears became pointed and hybridized between man and wolf; even his cock pulsed harder, growing thicker and thicker, begging for release… release Blake would gladly offer, but only after his own meat was drained. Blake wasn’t dumb and he wasn’t a pushover… a dark and sinister presence lived in him, begging for release and not only did Blake know Paul would be that key… Blake would remain Alpha and subdue this new werewolf… even if Paul was new and different. In fact, Blake was happy this new pup to be had wandered in to the bar’s bathroom, considering it was rare for another wolf to be born as most became foolish fucking donkeys. Now and then a bear was born. Those were fun to play with, but nothing ever compared to a fellow wolf. Paul, however, was different… he was special and that made the prospect of playing with him all the more enjoyable.<br />
<br />
“So then… what are we? What am I to be?” Paul asked with a coy grin as his voice deepened.<br />
<br />
“I am a werewolf my dastardly fellow. You… I think you are a werewolf, but you could be something else… something… more.” Blake answered, pausing for effect and then continued, “I believe you may be one of a few things because there is a great darkness and evil in you. I know you can feel it. It awoke the moment you relished and savored the taste of your own blood. I could see it in your eyes my friend, you delighted in it!”<br />
<br />
“Yeah… I did enjoy it… in fact… I want more! I feel a great hunger in me growing, begging to taste the fresh warm crimson fluid flowing on my teeth and into my gullet.” Paul growled as the dark form within continued to spread through his body.<br />
<br />
“Yes… that’s it! Let it go! Let it all go! Give in to your beast and let your humanity die! It’s weak and pathetic. Not a thing for the likes of us to be! Paul… I believe you are either becoming a Hell Hound, a Cerberus, or a Demon Werewolf. Your penchant for blood confirms it, but there is more to it. If you seek to end life and usher them to the firey gates of hell… then you are a Cerberus. If you are a guide for others to join you, you would be a Hell Hound. Though, if you seek the souls of those you choose for damnation, enlisting them to be a part of your army… then you are a Demon Werewolf! I would have to say, all three are definitely interesting, but I am most interested in seeing a Demon Werewolf.” Paul explained grinning deviously the entire time.<br />
<br />
What Paul didn’t know was Blake had an incredible evil within him… one that would be able to usher in a new era of existence. Blake would be his master and Paul would be a tool… an instrument in his arsenal to not only awaken his true form, but to subjugate and rule over humanity with the rest of his Demon Werewolf kind. The only question left to answer was, which beast would Paul be?</p>
