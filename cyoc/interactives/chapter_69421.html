<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ty looked June over for a moment and tried to feel guilt for messing with her, but it was impossible. This was the woman who had bullied, humiliated, and mindfucked him for years. And while Mark was the undisputed head of the house and was eager to put the fear of God into Ty, it was June who was truly evil.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmmm.&quot; Ty grinned. &quot;How can I pay you back?&quot; Then a light bulb clicked on in his demented brain.<br />
<br />
&quot;June... you're such a cold bloodsucker. So you're going to slowly and painfully turn into a teensy tiny little mosquito. I'm not going to let you off easy, though. You're going to remember everything about who you are and retain your consciousness in your new body. But you'll be a slave to your own instincts, never totally in control of yourself.&quot;<br />
<br />
All at once, June jolted and cried out in pain. &quot;Ow!&quot; She cried. &quot;What the hell?!&quot; She put down her glass of wine and grabbed her suddenly aching stomach, doubling over. &quot;Ow! Ow! W-What the... what the hell is...&quot; She cringed, screamed, and fell forward onto her hands and knees, wincing. When she looked up and opened her eyes, her face had turned to stricken panic.<br />
<br />
&quot;D-Dustinnnnn!&quot; She wailed. She paused, gasped, and fell onto her side, grabbing her gut and beggining to cry. &quot;W-What... oh God! Oh God!&quot; She began to sob as the first of the changes racked her body. Her skin began to grow coarser, as if it was quickly drying out. The pain was incredible. &quot;Dustinnnnnnn!&quot; She cried again weakly, and convulsed as spasms of burning sensations began to spike through her nerves.<br />
<br />
Her skin continued it's bizarre progression, turning from a healthy pink to a sickly leathery black. She rose on her knees for a moment, clutching her sides and grimacing, and with tears in her eyes she moaned and then let out a terrible scream of agony as her entire body made awful crackling noises. As June sat there, overwhelmed with pain, her outer flesh began to harden into an exoskeleton, slowly overtaking her. All lines and softness on her body vanished as her flesh solidified to a solid mass.<br />
<br />
As the horrible insensity subsided June opened her eyes to wipe away the tears and found her predicament. She screamed again, raised her own hand to her strangely emotionless face, and her jaw dropped. She raised slowly, feeling nothing but numbness, and stared down at the gleaming black armor that had become her skin.<br />
<br />
She flexed experimentally, finding all her segmented joints fully functional, and barely comprehended what was happening to her. &quot;I... I...&quot; She stuttered. &quot;I must be sick.&quot; She concluded, too shocked to comprehend what was happening. &quot;I need a mirror.&quot; The closest mirror was in the upstairs bathroom.<br />
<br />
Walking forward, June found herself standing on changing feet, each toe hardening into wicked gripping claws beneath her. Her heels had raised too, placing her weight on the front of her foot. He ankles snapped, twisted, and her stance changed. &quot;O-Oh God.&quot; She finally realized. &quot;This isn't... this isn't right.&quot;<br />
<br />
Even as the words left her mouth, her long brunette hair began to fall out. The sound of something falling onto the carpet caught her attention and she turned her head to see her own hair at her feet. In horror, she bent down and picked some up in her now clawed hand, watching it with shock. The last of the strands on her hair detatched and fell away down her body, and she reeled in disgust. &quot;W-What's happening to me?&quot; She asked softly, morbidly fascinated by the unknown process.<br />
<br />
There was another crackle and she winced, shivering as her body temperature cooled from mammalian to insect in seconds. Fear now gripped her as she felt two... somethings growing out of her side. Her horror grew as she saw two tiny copies of her hands slip out from under her shirt. They began growing faster and faster as did June's bewildered fright. She reached down to raise her shirt, trembling, and let out another scream as her two new arms joined the effort, all four hands gripping and shirt. She pulled it off over her head, tossing it away, and held out four well proportioned but no less hideous insectoid arms. Now in her bra and pants, she staggered forward, seeing the glint off her yellow/green belly plates, interlocking down her neck, chest, and abdomen.<br />
<br />
&quot;Have to...&quot; She walked forward, stumbling on legs that were a little thinner and daintier. &quot;Have to get... help. Fast.&quot; As she reached the kitchen another awful crackle brought her down to her plated knees and she cried out again. In horror, she raised all four hands to the source of her pain - her head - just in time to find her ears shrinking away and her face beggining to lengthen. Her lips pulled forward like clay, vanishing, as her entire skull began to press forward. At the same time, her vision fractured into a kaleidoscope as her human eyes split into hundreds of tiny versions of themselves momentarily, before they glossed over into a gleaming solid orange. She cried out again, her original two hands staying on her growing face while her new lower arms reached up to touch her back. Two gossimer wings began to enlarge from her exoskeleton, set firmly on her back, and she felt them growing larger and heavier behind her. Her face continued it's horrible relentless push outward as her skull reformed. Her nose, meanwhile, ejected two long feathery feelers from her nostrils before sealing up forever.<br />
<br />
&quot;N-No!&quot; June screamed, her voice becoming raspy and strange. &quot;Oh God, no! I'm a bug! I'm a fucking bug!&quot; She rose frantically, clacking her clawed feet with increasingly inhuman digits, and scrambled towards the phone. She needed to call 9-1-1! She needed to do something! The unfamiliarity of her devolving body was a hinderance, however, and she fell several times as her hips and legs slimmed further, as did her four arms. Her entire torso, in fact, had drastically lost size, and her breasts had all but faded. Her face lengthened out further, into a long sharp proboscis with a small mouth on the end, and her balance shifted as her ass began to press out. She looked behind her, sprawled on the floor as she was, and let out a muffled cry as she saw an insectoid abdomen growing full and large behind her.<br />
<br />
She rose slowly, this time, carefully, and what stood up was neither totally human or mosquito, but a clear blend between both creatures. Tall and skinny, June had lost all the definition of her human form, standing on two long stick-like legs that bent at alien angles. Her four arms were just as long and spindly, with her thumbs all but gone and three long clawed fingers. She looked down past her sword like face and gulped. There were no words to be said.<br />
<br />
Frantically, she bolted forward as her fear returned, and with her imprecise hands she grabbed for the phone on the wall. It was getting colder and June felt increasing pain. The last stage of her transformation was building and soon the strange bug woman would be nothing but a true bug.<br />
<br />
She raised the receiver carefully in fumbling fingers and with her second set of arms she tried to dial a number. It was no use, though, her bug-like hands too inhuman to even dial a phone, and in wailing frustration she threw the receiver against the wall.<br />
<br />
She turned away, holding her top arms to her head, and hugged her second set around her still slimming waist. She looked down, seeing her comically oversized jeans and panties hanging around her knees, and angrily kicked them away, sending the clothes flying across the room.<br />
<br />
She called up the stairs again, but all that came out was a strange humming buzz. She lurched in horror and tried again. Nothing but the same odd sound. With a start, she realized what had happened. She had just lost speech.<br />
<br />
It was at this point that Ty removed his apprent invisibility, standing behind June. She had gotten even taller and slimmer, and as she wheeled around at the strange sensation of feeling something warm close she felt relief. Greatful for anybody, really, she threw herself at Ty and clutched him in all four arms. She looked down at him, saw his eyes staring back at her own multicelled version, and tried her best to be expressive despite her totally inflexible features.<br />
<br />
Her eyes were clear, though. Ty stared back and saw her desperation. Help me, she was saying. Just help me. Make it stop! Her arms clenched tighter around him as Ty willed the knowledge that he had begun her changes to be known. The desperation increased. She held the boy against her hard exoskeletal stomach and trembled.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sorry, June.&quot; Ty offered, in an almost concilatory tone. &quot;But it's too late. You'll start shrinking now. And soon you'll go all the way.&quot;<br />
<br />
June reeled at this and let go, taking dainty steps backwards from Ty. She lowered her gaze, stared at the floor, and flapped her wings several times in an unconscious flick. The gust startled her and she jumped, staring back at herself. She looked back to Ty frantically, held all four of her hands together in each other, and shook them violently in a strange approximation of begging him.<br />
<br />
Ty stared coldly, fascinated by his step mom's weird body, and wondered what it must be like to lose one's humanity like this. It was at that point that there was another constant crackling, and June began to slowly compress.<br />
<br />
She stood there for a moment in shock, watching her view of the world lowering, and then in sudden realization she looked down at herself and saw her scale lessening. She looked back up and screamed - a tiny buzz - as she stood no taller than Ty's chest. He stepped forward gently, placing his hands on the shrinking mosquito woman's hips. Her hands raised, the lower set gripping his hands, the upper set gripping his arms, and she trembled again as she shrank away. As she became no taller than Ty's waist the boy hefted her up and held her out to look on. She looked down for a moment, seeing how tiny she had become, and looked up at him pitifully once more as her proportions began to alter.<br />
<br />
Her torso shrank quickly, scrunching down and thinning further, while her neck seemed to pull into her body. Her &quot;arms&quot; grew longer, matching her legs, while her stance quickly shifted. She was no longer upright, taking on all the appearance of a giant mosquito in Ty's grip.<br />
<br />
She flailed her arms frantically, shrinking further still, and then went still. Only two feet long, her abdomen curling as a new appendage. She stared helplessly at Ty, just waiting for the nightmare to end.<br />
<br />
&quot;Look at you.&quot; Ty said in amazement. &quot;Soon you'll be gone forever. No more June.&quot; He squeezed her side firmly and set her to squirming in his grip. &quot;A little smaller, and I can crush you like the bug you've becoming.&quot;<br />
<br />
She flailed again, trying to escape his grip, and at one foot long Ty released her, letting her fall to the floor. Once on the tiles, June struggled to stand, tipping from one side to the other, and as she reached only six inches long she stood, crawling forward on unfamiliar legs. All six of them.<br />
<br />
&quot;You're trying to escape, aren't you?&quot; Ty grinned. He raised his foot gently and pressed it down on June's back, pinning her. She shrank further still, four inches, and in a frenzy she tried to escape. He was going to crush her! He was going to squish her! Ty brought his foot down harder and June felt her guts straining against her exoskeltal body, dangerously close to exploding from within her.<br />
<br />
Ty lifted his foot, watching June's feelers fall in relief, and watched as she continued to crawl forward. &quot;There we go.&quot; Ty smirked. &quot;Keep running. And remember, June, how helpless you just felt. Remember that you did that to me for too long. And that's why you're this... thing.&quot;<br />
<br />
June stopped, turned, and at two inches long she stared up at the giant Ty. For the first time in her life, she felt a true pang of guilt. Then her transformation began to complete, and she shuddered in agony once again as her mind deteriorated fast. She brought her front legs to her head, trying to relieve to the throbbing, and as she shrank past one inch long, it all became clear. Her mind fell apart, collapsed, but deep inside her new insect brain she was still there. A woman locked in a bug's body. Just on the edge of being in control of herself but feeling the other presense firmly in command.<br />
<br />
&quot;N-No!&quot; She screamed in her head. &quot;No! Not this! Anything but this! No! I'm sorry! I'm sorry!&quot;<br />
<br />
Instead, the mosquito fluttered its wings as it stopped shrinking, almost a spec, and Ty willed it to fly away out the open window. The mosquito obligued, zipped into the air, through the screenless window, and vanished.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now that...&quot; Ty grinned. &quot;Was satisfying.&quot;</p>
