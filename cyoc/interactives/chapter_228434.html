<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">With everything that was going on, both Kellie and Misery decided that if the two girls were going on a date someone should be around. Needless to say both girls weren&#39;t exactly thrilled by this concept, eventually agreeing to Annie coming over to Liliths to watch a movie. As Annie now anxiously approached Liliths apartment, she smoothed out her shirt before wiping her sweaty palms on her jeans. As the door opened, she felt the color drain from her face as she gazed into the eyes of a vampire. &quot;Hi is Lilith here?&quot;<br />
<br />
Bong nodded, releasing a cloud of smoke from her cigarette as she beckoned the teen inside. Annie was still a bit uncomfortable, especially considering the stern expression on the Korean vampires face. &quot;So you&#39;re Annie,&quot; she asked. Annie nodding, her mouth feeling dry as she tried to introduce herself. &quot;Look kid relax,&quot; Bong said firmly. &quot;Lilith is with Set and Jolie getting ready. Just have a seat.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; Annie squeaked, making her way towards the expensive looking couch. As she studied the apartment carefully, Annie was impressed by what she saw. Everything was clean and appeared brand new. After setting up this movie night, Annie had done a little bit of digging on the people Lilith was staying with. When she discovered it was a chaotic and destructive punk band she expected the place to be a mess. Instead, she found the apartment to be in emaculate condition. Annie now wondered if the band had cleaned the place up just for her.<br />
<br />
As Lilith now exited a side room, Annie&#39;s pulse quickened as she beheld the goth teen. Dressed casually, Lilith was sporting a long sleeve black and purple blouse with dark jeans and dress boots. Apparently Jolie and Set had helped the girl with her makeup as the dark colors accented her beauty. &quot;Hey,&quot; Lilith stammered, her cheeks blushing. &quot;Hey,&quot; Annie replied, feeling just as nervous. &quot;You look great.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lilith blushed offering a soft thank you as she shyly approached the teen. &quot;Okay well you two have fun,&quot; Set smiled. &quot;Jolie and I are going out.&quot; Jolie paused, raising an eyebrow as she curiously gazed at Set. &quot;We are? I thought we were going to spy on these two to make sure nothing bad happens to Lilith?&quot; Set sighed, elbowing Jolie in the side as she began dragging the necromancer outside. &quot;Just remember we&#39;ll be watching,&quot; Jolie exclaimed, furrowing her brow as she pointed at Annie.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow they&#39;re kind of intense,&quot; Annie whispered as the door slammed. Lilith blushed, offering a small nod as Bong now stepped forward. &quot;Okay listen,&quot; she said. &quot;I&#39;m going to lay down. I&#39;ve had a long night and need some sleep.&quot; As the two teens nodded, Annie watched as Bong leaned in giving Lilith a small hug. As she did Annie could swear she heard the vampire utter a single sentence to her. <br />
<br />
Be yourself and have fun, you got this.<br />
<br />
&quot;So,&quot; Annie asked nervously. &quot;What do you feel like watching?&quot; Lilith shrugged, the girl fidgeting with her clothes as she stared at the floor. &quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; she shrugged. &quot;Maybe a horror movie or something. I sure as shut don&#39;t want to watch some lame rom-com.&quot; Annie chuckled, agreeing with Lilith as the pair shyly looked at one another.<br />
<br />
The sound of a bowl of popcorn being slammed down on a coffee table made both girls jump in alarm. &quot;Hey girls,&quot; Luca exclaimed loudly. &quot;Just figured I&#39;d bring you some popcorn for your movie night!&quot; Annie gawked, gazing up at the massive werewolf in front of her.<br />
<br />
Luca had fully transformed into a massive werewolf. Standing around 7 feet tall with wild brown fur and massive fangs he now focused his attention on Annie. Annie gulped, gazing into the fearsome amber eyes of the werewolf. &quot;Thanks Luca,&quot; Lilith sighed. &quot;Would you two like some soda,&quot; he said loudly, his voice more of a growl than a question. &quot;Um thank you Mr. Luca,&quot; Annie whispered nervously.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mr. Luca,&quot; he chuckled. &quot;Mr. Luca is my dad. Just call me Luca. The werewolf that would tear you to pieces if you hurt Lilith.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Luca you&#39;re embarrassing me!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry, sorry,&quot; Luca replied sheepishly, his voice still menacing as he stared at Lilith and Annie. &quot;I just want you to have fun Lilith. And I want you to have fun too Annie, just as long as you&#39;re six feet from her. Remember social distancing!&quot;<br />
<br />
Lilith groaned, watching Luca March into the kitchen. &quot;Sorry about him,&quot; she blushed. &quot;He&#39;s a bit overprotective.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thats okay,&quot; Annie smiled. &quot;I think it&#39;s kinda cool having a werewolf as an older brother of sorts.&quot; Lilith seemed to appreciate the comment, offering Annie a soft smile as the pair began looking for something to watch. Settling on what looked like a particularly disturbing Japanese horror movie, they began to settle down to enjoy the show.<br />
<br />
Twenty minutes into the movie, Annie and Lilith had begun inching closer to one another. Accidentally making contact with eachother, the two paused as they shyly gazed into eachothers eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey I brought you some sodas!&quot;<br />
<br />
Annie and Lilith screamed as Luca came barreling out of the kitchen. The werewolf had indeed brought the teens some soda, he just also happened to have a fully running chainsaw with him.<br />
<br />
&quot;The FUCK are you doing with a chainsaw!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
Luca released the lever, the chainsaws motor now idling as he looked at Lilith in confusion. &quot;Oh I was um about to cut down some trees,&quot; he replied, Lilith angrily glaring at him. Slowly the werewolf now turned to Annie, a maniacal grin on his face, causing the goth teen to squirm. &quot;You know,&quot; he smiled. &quot;The chainsaw was originally designed for cesarean sections. Doctors designed it to cut through a person&#39;s pelvic bone. Some say it can still do that.&quot; Annie paled, her eyes wide with fright at the werewolves threat.<br />
<br />
&quot;GET OUT LUCA!!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
Luca shrugged, placing the soda down as he once more vanished into the kitchen. &quot;Um maybe I should go,&quot; Annie said weakly. &quot;No,&quot; Lilith said quickly, reaching over to grab Annie’s hand. &quot;No please stay. Look I&#39;m sorry about him he&#39;s....he&#39;s been super overprotective of me since we ran into that assassin and I saved his life.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You faced her before,&quot; Annie gasped, to which Lilith nodded. The teen now holding up two fingers to signify just how many times she had avoided death at the hands of Hinata. &quot;Wow,&quot; Annie said breathlessly. &quot;You&#39;re amazing Lilith. I can&#39;t believe you were brave enough to face her twice.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks,&quot; Lilith blushed. &quot;But it wasn&#39;t anything that amazing. I was more scared than anything.&quot; Annie smiled, reaching over to take Liliths hand. &quot;That&#39;s usually the case,&quot; she said softly. &quot;Trust me I know I&#39;ve been there but, you did something I couldn&#39;t do. You acted to save people. I wish I could have done that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lilith smiled softly, squeezing Annie&#39;s hand tightly as the gazed into eachother eyes. So rarely had the teen been complimented and here she was being complimented by a cute gurl she was crushing on. Lilith could feel her heart race, the two teens slowly approaching eachother as they looked to share a first kiss.<br />
<br />
WHO WANTS ORANGE SLICES!!<br />
<br />
Lilith and Annie screamed turning back towards where Luca had yelled. The werewolf had apparently been listening from the kitchen. Smashing through the wall separating the kitchen and living room like some sort furry Kool Aid Man as he bared his fangs at the pair. The two teens now held eachother in fear, screaming at the top of their lungs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay that it!&quot;<br />
<br />
Lilith and Annie turned, watching as Bong now stomped out of her room. Grabbing the werewolf by the ear, she now twisted causing Luca to whine and drop the plate of orange slices he held in his hand. &quot;Sorry about the mutt,&quot; she sighed. &quot;He&#39;s not house broken yet. I&#39;ll just take him outside so you two can finish your movie.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You have a really weird family huh,&quot; Annie stated watching as Bong now dragged Luca outside. Lilith paused, she had never even considered the idea that anyone would care about her, let alone think of them as family. &quot;Yeah,&quot; she smirked. &quot;I guess I do.&quot;</p>
