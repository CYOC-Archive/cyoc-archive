<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Rick looked at himself in the mirror with frustration and fascination. What he saw was an older, female version of himself. It was a curly haired redhead with makeup applied through magic instincts. She had large breasts, a hot red dress, and an ass to die for. Unfortunately, Rick couldn&#39;t even enjoy her beauty as she was him!<br />
<br />
&quot;Dammit.&quot; Rick muttered to himself in his feminine voice. &quot;I&#39;m not even turned on by her... me? Am I just not attracted to someone who looks a bit like my mom or am I still straight but female straight.&quot; Either answer troubled him so he shoved the thought from his mind. He stood up straight, fixed his bra, and made his way downstairs.<br />
<br />
Despite being in heels for the first time ever, Rick was somehow able to walk normal. The camera apparently made sure that however you changed, you wouldn&#39;t stand out. He gently came down the stairs to see his &quot;husband&quot; talking with Emily and Marion. Marion was playing with her curly brown hair as she looked bored. Emily, meanwhile, seemed to be trying to at least pretend like he was listening but she clearly wanted out.<br />
<br />
Rick figured both of them wanted to find the camera ASAP and he couldn&#39;t blame them. Rick walked up to them and Emily tried not to laugh as she saw what her boyfriend looked like now. Marion, meanwhile, didn&#39;t seem to care as she took the opportunity to leave. Ben turned and smiled as he gave Rick another kiss.<br />
<br />
Rick wanted to punch him again but knew it was no use with the camera restricting some behaviors. During the kiss, however, Rick felt worried for a different reason. He felt his new female parts start to warm up. Rick felt no attraction to the man, but his body said otherwise. Rick knew he had to find the camera, at the least before they got back from this client conference thing. <br />
<br />
As Ben and Rick walked out together, Rick looked back at Emily and gave her a &quot;hurry up&quot; sort of stare. Emily nodded as she began to search for the camera. A half hour later and Rick was seated with Ben at a fancy restaurant. Rick focused on the menu, but couldn&#39;t help but notice all the stares he was getting from the male staff. He felt embarrassed as he tried to cover his breasts a little.<br />
<br />
&quot;So.&quot; Rick decided to ask. &quot;where are the other work people?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh Ricki my ditzy beauty, there is no client conference.&quot; Ben lovingly laughed. &quot;I just wanted to take my special girl out on a lovely date.&quot; He replied happily.<br />
<br />
Internally, Rick was pissed that he was there for nothing, but of course, his body betrayed him.<br />
&quot;Baaaaby. That&#39;s like, so thoughtful of you.&quot; Rick found himself forced to say.<br />
<br />
The next hour was torturous for Rick. He sat there and tried his best to fill the space with useless banter. Ben and &quot;Ricki&quot; chatted away while Rick counted the minutes. Rick found he was still able to speak his mind, but the second he tried to say anything too out of character, he would find himself saying something completely different. Ben kept eyeing and poking at Rick&#39;s boobs and Rick was a minute away from knocking him out.<br />
<br />
Finally, Rick got a break as Ben spoke up.<br />
&quot;I gotta go to the bathroom. When I get back I&#39;ll pay the check.&quot; He then pinched Rick&#39;s butt. &quot;Then we can go back to the bedroom.&quot; He whispered with his best seductive growl.<br />
<br />
Rick pretended to smile but inside was mortified. He watched as Ben walked off and as soon as he was out of sight Rick started thinking about his options. He could try to run, but he would&#39;t get far in heels. Then he remembered Emily was still back at the house. He took out his phone and dialed her as fast as possible.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, hello?&quot; Emily asked confused by the contact name.<br />
<br />
&quot;Emily, it&#39;s me Ricki!&quot; Rick said. He quickly realized he was too loud as others could hear him, so his speech became altered. &quot;I mean... oh you know. Did you find the camera?&quot; He asked desperately.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry Rick but we looked everywhere and couldn&#39;t find it. Marion thinks that it may be inside something somewhere. If it isn&#39;t, then it&#39;s likely taking its time to show up again. Apparently it can be &quot;mischievous&quot;, somehow, so it might appear in a terrible way. On top of that, she also told me some more info about it, like that if you switch the right button on it no new people can be aware. Also, apparently she thinks there might be a way to control what changes happen better, but we just need to find it!&quot; She explained.<br />
<br />
Just as Emily finished her explanation, Rick noticed his purse suddenly bulge. He realized what it probably meant as he opened it up. As he thought, he found the camera now sitting in his purse.<br />
<br />
&quot;Emily, it just appeared here with me!&quot; Rick said astonished. <br />
<br />
&quot;What!?&quot; Emily yelled. &quot;Well get back here pronto!&quot; She replied.<br />
<br />
Before Rick could respond, he suddenly felt a hand on his shoulder.<br />
&quot;Who are you talking to Ricki?&quot; He asked politely.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, it&#39;s just Emily. I called to..... check on Marion! They&#39;re doing well.&quot; Rick lied as he hung up the phone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Great to hear.&quot; He responded, sitting back down. &quot;Where did you get that camera?&quot; He asked confused.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh...&quot; Rick began to say before Ben swiped it. He looked it over and accidentally switched a few buttons. Rick could tell one was the awareness one, but he had no idea what else the camera could do. He sat with his breath held as Ben looked it over. Just then...</p>
