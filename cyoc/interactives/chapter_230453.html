<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">With a peeling motion, Darren quickly placed his sister&#39;s face and vagina back to their rightful positions, and with a quick wish - she was again none the wiser - definitely not screwing with him.  <br />
<br />
Darren experimented with his sister&#39;s body and his own for the next five minutes, trading and swapping arms and legs, breasts and chests, hands and feet, lips, noses, eyes, ears, and hair.  His sister would always be puzzled as to the reason for his unsolicited change just before he made the wish to alter her perception of reality, but always would instantaneously return to her indifferent, slightly tired, and altogether oblivious mental state upon its activation.  <br />
<br />
The two had woken up an hour before everyone else that Wednesday for his sister&#39;s makeup routine, so Darren, not certain if others were affected by his ability if he only used them on a singular individual, put no time to waste in plunging into the true depths of his curiosity for the rest of the available time. He had switched and unswitched features multiple times - his legs with her arms, her nose with his penis, twisting her upper body backwards, replacing her feet with his hands, conjoining himself with her, etc., etc.  <br />
<br />
At various moments that morning, Darren&#39;s sister had been given varioud mutant-like forms, and no matter how bizarre, she continued to apply makeup as if they were nothing:  <br />
<br />
1. By exchanging his legs for her arms and sacrificing his two pinky fingers to make a makeshift tail that he placed at the start of the crack of her behind (attaching to her spine), Darren given his sister an optionally quadrupedal form that she seemed to appreciate.  Walking on two legs at some times and on four at others, the young man&#39;s sister nonchalantly sighed and kept good conversation with him, and even rolled her tongue out and tackled him like a dog as a joke,wagging her &quot;tail&quot; all the while (which poked through a small hole now present in all of her underwear and legwear).  After she complained about how his big feet (that she now used as hands) were always unbearably stinky, she began shaving the &quot;never-quelled&quot; curly hair along his legs, with unnatural dexterity.  Not wanting his legs shaved, Darren, with a wish, hurriedly switched them back with his sister&#39;s arms - to find both all his leg hair still intact, and the &quot;tail-hole&quot; in his sister&#39;s garments now absent . . .  <br />
<br />
2. Darren, out of curiosity, had performed a simple headswap (with neck) like he had done so many times before - but this time used a &quot;wish.&quot; The unexpected reality change hit him like a truck.  With the change in genitalia, and thus supplied hormones, the decorations and aesthetics of his and his sister&#39;s rooms had almost completely swapped, as well as their sexualities - a realization to which Darren reacted to with an unexpectedly feminine gasp.  Indeed, with the reality change, Darren and his voicebox had gone full girl, while his sister had gone full on tomboy bodybuilder.  Exiting her room covered in sweat, shirtless, with a noticeable bulge in her(?) boxers and a much deeper voice than he remembered, beckoned him to the restroom: <br />
&quot;Hey big guy, wanna put on makeup for the day?&quot; <br />
With a giggle, bouncing D-cups he was momentarily no longer sexually attracted to, and multiple sways of his wide hips and new shapely behind, Darren had ran to the sink mirror, and spent about 20 minutes having the best time of his life applying makeup aling with his sister and making his face as feminine-looking as possible - to the point that his sister admitted that it made her hard (he was unrecognizably cute).  With a girly sigh, Darren switched back their heads, realizing only 18 minutes were left on the clock before they would actually have to prepare for school.  And, with a wish, their rooms, bodies, mannerisms, voices, and sexualities were instantly reverted.  All the makeup on his face had disappeared.<br />
<br />
3. After observing the messy results of two separate experiments (The first was replacing his testicles with his sister&#39;s breasts - yes, he had a mind-breaking orgasm in the shower and nutted about a gallon of milk ; The second was exchanging his sister&#39;s tongue for his penis, and placing her tongue inside her vagina that he moved up to between her breaststroke - yes, he could hear her moaning from outside the bathroom as she masturbated/self-sexed herself), Darren went with his first ever conjoinment experiment while testing his newfound ability.  As his sister hummed, applying eyeliner, he carefully removed his sister&#39;s well-endowed breasts and head, placing them all on his chest, his sister&#39;s head attached to his sternum.  Next, he took her arms, attaching them to each side of his chest, just below his personal ones.  After detaching her body from the waist down and fusing it, facing forward, to his spine, he touched his sister&#39;s featureless, limbless chest and stomach and disconnected all connection between he and his sister and it - it was still living, but controlled as of now by no one.  The moment after Darren ceded control of his sister&#39;s limbs to his now conjoined sister, he made the wish, and a flood of new sensations flooded him.  Looking in the mirror, his face again did not look unlike a cute girl, the makeup having returned - along with a pixie cut. His sister, done with the eyeliner, moved on to lipstick, her legs behind his crossed, before beckoning him to walk to the closet, which they performed in perfect synchronization.  Stripping out of their feminine pajamas, of which their &quot;torso-wear&quot; curiously had four arm holes and a neck hole for his sister&#39;s head.  Gazing at their bare body and his sister&#39;s impressive behind that sat just behind his, Darren jittered nervously and even became aroused - something to which his sister guffawed at - it was a hilariously common occurrence, apparently.  First donning a large black bra, then a soft white shirt followed by a cropped polo shirt (made for four arms) that well presented their shared bust, the two pulled on two light blue jeans, one over Darren&#39;s boxers, while the other struggled sexily over his sister&#39;s behind and thong.  Examining themselves in the mirror, the two did not look unlike a pair of sexy, well-dressed mutant sisters.<br />
<br />
4. Running out of time after a couple of additional experiments (Queen Conjoinment, Face-to-Face Conjoinment, switching his buttcheeks with his sister&#39;s breasts, swapping her eyes with her nipples, replacing his penis with her head and neck that had its nose and mouth swapped with her vagina, etc.),  <br />
And witnessing his sister&#39;s glorious fashion sense applied to each of the ridiculous forms, Darren made one last daring modification.  Placing his head and neck directly next to his sister&#39;s he remotely controlled his body to arrange his and his sister&#39;s body parts like puzzle pieces to make a humantaur. With some difficulty, he had managed to move his arms up to his sister&#39;s main torso while fusing his armless, headless body to her spine.  It was glorious - with their four legs, the two pranced around the room with their shared control over their strong body in their jeans and boots, rolling around on the ground, kicking their legs in the air and giggling - his sister loved the form.<br />
<br />
The only time when Darren&#39;s sister had stopped putting on makeup was when Darren had taken all four of her limbs, chest, and stomach away, attaching them to himself and gaining control over them.  His sister&#39;s head, mounted on the stump that was her legless hips and buttocks, had beckoned him to apply makeup for her - information he had gained when she remained in that form.  And every time, Darren&#39;s inquiries were met, no matter how bizarre her appearance, with a humorous, puzzled response:  &quot;Uhhh . . . Are you still sleeping dude? The Fusion Wave did this to me.  Though I would like if you used you power to fix me straight for a bit.&quot;</p>
