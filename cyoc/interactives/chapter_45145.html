<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">In as much Ken realized his seeing and feeling of having then the male equipment belonging to a bull should make him disgruntled as why it happened, he felt elated by it. The added sensations thrilled him in his thoughts, he who had done and tried his manhood with a few young women, suddenly added to his thoughts of conquest the possibility of him going into a pasture and there hump a cow.<br />
<br />
Down inside his vindictive mind, Ken knew the difference of what he had as a manhood maleness the day before, and of what it had since become. He knew he should be looking for the reasoning of why this happened, or if the last young woman her did, did something to taint his maleness. He had not an inkling that this became him by way of his little sister and of Circe getting their new style of seeking revenge on those who caused for Anna any sort of discomfort.<br />
<br />
Seeing of it was to find appreciation of having bull size balls, a bovine shaped sheath, and the best of it was the thrill of feeling the elongated, heightened of sensual touch, and looking very bestial, Ken felt delighted for having lost his sign of Christianity, that the circumcision he always felt was not in his best interest.<br />
<br />
A great inhaled breath, Ken then let it out with a hearty snort from his nostrils. He did this several times, gaining odd, but wondrous sensations throughout his bodily self, and unknowingly, it began to broaden his nose to look the part of a bovine muzzle.<br />
<br />
Huffing his breathing, Ken had chores to do about the homestead, and he went to do it with a renewed sense of determination. Aroused in more new ways that of what hung between his legs or set attached  then to his lower abdomen, Ken enjoyed the being outside the house, free of any confinement, and doing something that seemingly helped his body to mature. <br />
<br />
Work became more as fun and the love of feelings and sensations. All of this due to growth of a massive amount of muscle, bovine conforming muscularity, thickening shoulder muscles, hearty big upper arm muscles, and from striding walking came leg muscular changes; Ken barely took note of his legs bones shifting and the walking on toes in their own changing way of becoming cloven hooves.<br />
<br />
Insurgent with his work, Ken did more that what his father had wanted done, and did so thinking of what Dad said about his son, &quot;That he, (Ken) was so lazy and bullheaded, he should have been better born as a bull!&quot; This less than admiring sentiment toward Ken by his father, became the driving force behind a young man gaining and deciding that the becoming more like a bull might delight his father.<br />
<br />
Engrossed and enthused, Ken began to do given cores he never before thought to do or complete, but the added stress on his changing body help it to change and made him liking it. He changed, Ken and his body from the neck down became ever-more bull like, and he enjoyed it all until late in the afternoon when by chance Anna saw him and Circe inside that young mind did suggest she visit with her brother before he became lost to her in living as would a bull.<br />
<br />
&quot;Brother, you have done more than father expected to get done from someone as lazy as you are when your more normal self.&quot; Anna said the words, but Circe thought of them and their proper order to give Ken a dig, as such to wave before an almost transformed male human a red cape and yell &quot;Toro.&quot;<br />
<br />
Whirling around with such rage and force, the turn made the equilibrium of how Ken stood and held himself standing upright made him lean and fall down to stand properly then on all four legs.<br />
<br />
Angered by the words and their suggestive meaning, Ken snorted and began pawing at the ground, he showing the signs of anger aroused in a bullish bovine mind and body.<br />
<br />
Anna was ready to back away from this beast, but Circe has experience with said such males, and she stepped very closer with Anna to the bull. The pressing of the ring on what Anna then had permanently upon her finger, put against the snorting nostrils of an angered bull, calmed it, and returned a few moments of sanity to a brain and mind set upon living life as would then being a bull.<br />
<br />
Snorting turned to a sudden realization and a sound as if brother bullish Ken realized his new self and said, &quot;Huh!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Brother, I am more than what you reckoned with in years past and as from this moment and for some years to come, my brother has run away from home. That is what shall be the story told by our parents about a bull headed son. Bullheaded and embodied as well, you being as what is common around here, you are to anyone looking at you now but a large, matured, Black Angus big bull.&quot; Anna said, as Circe chided and did her usual demeaning manner to assure of any man she made into an animal knew of it and remembered what he was once.</p>
