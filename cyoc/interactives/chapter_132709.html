<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Eventually, Tad watched as a small smirk appeared on Amy&#39;s face which puzzled him a bit, and it lasted until she began to chuckle a bit.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, what&#39;s so funny?&quot; Tad asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; Amy chuckled, &quot;I just had to mess with you a little. Just a little bit.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mess with me?&quot; Tad wondered raised an eyebrow.<br />
<br />
&quot;Moon Lake does play a football game every Thanksgiving, and it generally is scheduled to allow people to have their dinner and see at least one of the NFL games on television,&quot; Amy explained, &quot;but the game is solely within the school itself... Moon Lake doesn&#39;t actually involve itself in many extracurricular activities that would have the risk of exposing the town&#39;s secret. Most of the things that will relate to schools outside Moon Lake are all academic, music, or theater based. Any sports that we play are entirely within Moon Lake High.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d originally thought it&#39;d be something like that,&quot; Tad commented, &quot;as obviously...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You couldn&#39;t join any of the teams elsewhere,&quot; Amy nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;But when you said...&quot; Tad began and stopped when he noticed that Amy&#39;s smirk remained, &quot;Come on... you can&#39;t mess with me like that just because I&#39;m technically new to Moon Lake.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry,&quot; Amy managed after a moment, &quot;I couldn&#39;t resist... I actually thought you&#39;d call me out on it before we got this far... but...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, yeah,&quot; Tad huffed and turned his head away to feign irritation, &quot;very funny.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Did you want to play?&quot; Amy wondered, &quot;They may have already started with practices by now... but...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nah,&quot; Tad said slowly, &quot;there might be some interest... but as I said, much of what I&#39;d do for physical exercise might be enough to stay in shape. Maybe we could go watch the game, but I&#39;ve generally been more interested in computer and video game types of things... that even if I could have joined those other school&#39;s teams without risking revealing that I&#39;m a werewolf... I probably wouldn&#39;t have.&quot;<br />
<br />
Amy chuckled again, and their lunch moved onto other subjects with Tad&#39;s curiosity on the advertisements for the game satisfied and Amy getting her joke out of her system. The two remained quite friendly and Tad didn&#39;t even hold anything against Amy for her joke. He supposed he walked straight into it, given that he was new to Moon Lake and that the game was likely something that Amy had grown up with. It made for some humor at lunch but didn&#39;t get to the point where anyone was angered. As he ate, Tad hoped his mom was doing okay, as he knew that she had one of her job interviews today as well.<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
Jen, meanwhile, was making her way up the steps to the Wells Fargo Bank that stood quietly next to DiMaggio&#39;s, where it had always been. Moon Lake, while it did do a lot to keep itself secure and protected, especially with regard to the were secret, couldn&#39;t keep a modern town functioning without some outside support. This often meant allowing companies from outside Moon Lake to come in and do business, and with regard to banking, Wells Fargo, had proven to be the one that Moon Lake trusted the most to come in and do business alongside the local bank that had been built with Moon Lake. These sorts of deals kept investments and potentially jobs coming into Moon Lake, which kept the town economically viable, despite having only around six thousand people.<br />
<br />
And that sort of deal was a great benefit to Jen as she was reestablishing herself in Moon Lake, as college wouldn&#39;t be free for Tad and there would be plenty of things that would require money, and that would require a job. The teller position that Wells Fargo had available fit one of the many odd jobs that Jen had had over the years while Jeff was on deployment or at different bases. She had showered and dressed up for the interview and made her way in with a confident feel about her to give the best showing that she could with the interviewer and she had every intention of using her wide array of skills to show how good she could be.<br />
<br />
The bank wasn&#39;t that busy as she entered, and she made her way up to a small rectangular &quot;help desk&quot; that was away from the main teller positions and approached the man seated there.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello, I&#39;m Jen Decker, I had an interview today for the open teller position,&quot; Jen said to him as she reached his desk and he looked up.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ll want to go to the human resource desk,&quot; the man said to her as he looked up and then pointed down the aisle that was formed between the two rows of desks that had clear name plates for the various roles that would be carried out at a bank, &quot;that&#39;ll be two desks up on your left.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you,&quot; Jen answered, &quot;Have a nice day.&quot;<br />
<br />
She then made her way up that aisle and found the desk she was looking for. It was neat and orderly with a lone wooden chair in front of it. Jen guessed the desk was made out of something synthetic, but she wasn&#39;t completely sure. The one thing she noted was the name plate on the front of the desk, which read: Brian Wilcox, Human Resources. She checked her watch and saw it was 9:59 AM, her session with Frances might have taken a bit longer than expected, but she was grateful to be on time. After a moment or two, Brian Wilcox looked up from his desk, where he was shuffling some papers around.<br />
<br />
&quot;Would you be Jennifer Decker?&quot; Brian Wilcox asked as he looked to her.<br />
<br />
&quot;I am,&quot; Jen spoke, &quot;I hope I&#39;m not late...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, you&#39;re right on time,&quot; Brian answered and gestured to the seat that was opposite him.<br />
<br />
Jen carefully took it and looked to him as she sat down. She kept herself calm in expectation of any sort of question that Mr. Wilcox might have for her. She could tell he was a were, and a wereskunk at that, but he was also well dressed with regard to what would be allowed and had his hair very well combed.<br />
<br />
&quot;So... to start with, why don&#39;t you tell me a bit about yourself,&quot; Brian spoke politely.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, to start with I was born and raised here in Moon Lake, and met Jeff Decker after his family moved to town,&quot; Jen spoke, &quot;We went through college and I fell very much in love with him. And so long as he lived, I was dedicated to him and am presently dedicated to providing for our son, who&#39;s now eighteen.  Over the years I&#39;ve picked up various hobbies and interests that would leave me healthy and ready to face anything.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes... now on your resume and application, many of the positions you&#39;ve had haven&#39;t necessarily been for very long in any one place,&quot; Brian spoke, &quot;can you explain that? Particularly with the few banks that you&#39;ve listed in your work history?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... Jeff was in the Marines,&quot; Jen answered quickly, &quot;and from time to time, his unit would be transferred to a new base or he would be transferred to a new unit for various reasons. This often meant that we frequently had to move and that I had to leave those jobs that I had. It was never about my work ethic or anything like that. It&#39;s just that the family would be moving and Jeff&#39;s new base wouldn&#39;t be close enough to that job site to justify commuting. There were some times where he had combat deployments, and in those situations I couldn&#39;t obviously follow him, and it was during those times that my length of employment was longer.&quot;<br />
<br />
Brian nodded, &quot;We also noticed that you have had a fair number of positions that weren&#39;t exclusively related to banking and the position to which you&#39;re applying...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve found that a wide array of experiences helps make for better person to person contact and relations,&quot; Jen answered, &quot;Which would be good for the bank, as it would allow your tellers to be friendly and capable of relating to all topics of conversation. In that, a lot of my prior experience would help in that regard and hasn&#39;t hindered my experience with other teller positions that I&#39;ve held in the past.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see,&quot; Brian spoke in reply and wrote a couple of notes down on a notepad he had in front of him.<br />
<br />
And things continued to go that way through the interview with Brian asking Jen various questions that related to what would be expected from a teller. Jen made her way through them fairly well and shared what information she could that would relate to difficulties that might be faced and reflected her own skills that would relate to the position. As they went along, Jen felt that Brian was rather impressed with some of her answers, though he didn&#39;t outright say anything. Eventually they did reach the end and Brian stood up with a somewhat warm smile as he did so.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... I must say you have left a very good impression,&quot; Brian spoke as they stood up and shook hands.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you,&quot; Jen spoke with her best smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re just getting into the start of the interview process, so I&#39;m afraid it may take a little while before we can get back to you,&quot; Brian spoke, &quot;Do you have any problem with that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, you do what you need to do,&quot; Jen answered.</p>
