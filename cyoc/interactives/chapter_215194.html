<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Not feeling picky about this latex mask of a rat As you were slowly looking at the designs while holding it up that it was almost breath taking for you were looking at all of the angles from the front, to the sides, and even to the back. You were astonished by the craftsmanship as it looked more like it really was an actual head of a rat in the size of a human&#39;s that even the smell of latex was drawing you in to wearing the mask, like you could hear it calling while begging to be put on. Were you going to do on what this latex rodent of a rat wanted, to bring the mask up to your face?<br />
<br />
You don’t see why not and shrugged the thought out as you figured what the hell for you&#39;ll look cool with this on, excessively since you seen a bunch of rat show characters like Redwall, gary the rat, the franchise of the TMNT shows over the years, higher mission (AKA) ratpocalypse, flushed awawy etc. That the mask of this grey rat Puts them all to shame compare to it. Thinking about this latex mask now that it leaves you with only one question in mind, how well will this actually fit you? soon enough though that you decided to try on the latex grey rat mask on for size, yet as you were examining the mask is where you shortly noticed something odd about the mask. Getting a better look on this rodent mask from the editing of its details is where it seems to be featuring what looks aggressive as there were some differences to make it seem a bit more... well, in a way that it was kind of cute.<br />
<br />
You weren&#39;t bothered by the mask&#39;s details for you even shrugged about this because you were extremely into rat stuff like this that In a way, it kinda makes you like it even more as you play a skaven in a RPG (role play game) board game with your friends while playing D&D (dungeons nd dragons) and a bit of time with Warhammer. seeing the contrasting intimidating face with the gray rat was looking that it was kind of incredibly awesome as it looked really good in quality. you wiped the sweat off from your face as you decided to open up the mask and put it on, yet the smell of latex was making your nose hairs curl up again that you beging to lift the mask up and over your head.<br />
<br />
You slipped into the mask as it was a little tight at first, but it eventually latches on and was touching to your face for it fit over your face like a glove while also taking in the sent of latex all around you that even your ears were crushed to the sieds. your forehead was compressed tightly by the top of the grey rat&#39;s face as you spent a few minutes on trying to get the mask into the right position which was now on your head that The inside of the mask somehow felt of warmth moist while it had a keen sort of smell. it was also oily in a way as it was with a bit of that rubbery smell to it while the eye holes were just under the fake molders for this was the only way to see out of the mask, and this proved difficult to see through for it was like the mask wasn’t ment to be worn. Being that it was now on your head as you were curious on how well you looked with this mask on, so what&#39;s the harm of taking a good look and see for yourself?<br />
<br />
fortunately, Navigating through your basement wasn&#39;t an issue as it was plenty large enough to walk around in as it was about 60 Feet long by at least 25 Feet wide that it still proved difficult with the thin eye slits of the mask. You didn&#39;t want to take off the latex grey rat mask till you saw how you looked, even if you stumped into a few poles that held the house up from falling as you also were struggled with bumping into a few tables here and there while wondering on just how well you looked. Eventually, you finally reached the location as to where the mirror was by crawling on your hands and knees to get there that you shortly after stood back up to stair into your own reflection and see the mask wasn&#39;t cheap for nobody could even find this at a nearby retail costume store. The mask was of high quality that only a place like Hollywood with it&#39;s special effects studios could make a piece like this, even if It&#39;s a decent looking mask to have with a nice Halloween costume for one night out of the year.<br />
<br />
The eye ports of the mask aliened fairly well with your own eyes as they were perfectly well hidden to everyone else for they&#39;ll only see the molded latex eyes while not bothering to notice the two small black holes, even you start to think that way too. Your nose slipped into a grove, enough that even the lips on the inside were touching yours as this was somehow giving you a friendly comfortable feeling. Everything about your body was exactly the same, except for the latex rat head as it blended perfectly with your skin that the neck hide smoothed down while looking like it was attached to your neck for even your cramped ears showed no signs of where they were to have two rounded rodent ears up on top to which filled the indentation inside the mask. This somehow aloud you to still hear very well with the latex mask of the grey rat on that while looking at yourself in the mirror still, you love it to consider saving it for Halloween and thought about trying to make a complete costume for it.<br />
<br />
Just messing around a bit as you also thought of saving this mask for a very good movie on which you could make with it one day that You had a ridiculous moment or two of playing around with it on for you even started to like it even more than usual. It looked real good for you could pass yourself off nicely as the thought of having your fun with it on that you decided to do some poses, even ones with your shirt and pants off when you later slipped them off. While you were still posing with your pants back on as you shortly started to stare at yourself longer and longer that you later find yourself more and more like you were pleased with it on, soon becoming unwilling to ever take it off.<br />
<br />
Slowly, you began to stroke your fingers across the mask a couple of times as the teeth seem to be very sharp that you could of swear this mask was your face now. You thought it was pretty neat on how well the head looks on a normal persons body that You started to chuckle to yourself a bit to laugh, yet it looks very nice on you at the same time. When you were Ready to move on, still looking at yourself in the mirror a bit more that You began to realize on how much time you were wasting by this as you then decided to pulled out your phone from the right pants pocket to check out the time.<br />
<br />
realizing on how much time you&#39;ve spent by fooling around and see that it was an an hour later, You&#39;ve decided it was time as you were having enough fun of this to see your breathing was heating up the mask. Seeing as this was probably the best time to take it off, before your sweat makes the mask stick tightly to your skin that you try pulling on the mask off of you and decided to get back to what you were doing before. you only succeeded in distorting the face however as you were injuring yourself that your sweat somehow stuck the mask to your skin. Great was what you thought, but that wasn’t all as you were still tugging on it to get this thing off of you that you suddenly noticed on feeling pain in your ears on were the face ears should have just been hollow latex.<br />
<br />
You couldn&#39;t explain it as you bring up your hand to one of the ears to where it was to rub it, you hear a deafening squeaking sound that you were shocked to feel the stimulation from the mask. this was getting too weird and freaky enough for you as you try pulling off the mask even harder now, but you were only hurting yourself more as you begin to panic that a thought of sticking your fingers underneath the seam of the mask. So why didn&#39;t you think of this of these things before?<br />
<br />
As you were ready to try it though that there was a problem with the idea as you couldn&#39;t find were the grey rat&#39;s mask ended and you began on where latex meets flesh, seeing the seam of keeping the two materials apart wasn&#39;t there for this confirms your worst fears. The mask wasn’t just stuck on you, but it was somehow BECOMING ONE WITH YOU as this brought you back to when you watched Goosebumps the tv series of the 1995 program of episodes 1 and 2, &#39;the hunted mask&#39;. You started to think of trying this on in the basement alone wasn&#39;t such a good idea as you didn&#39;t want to believe that the mask was now apart of you that you pulled harder and harder while letting out pained cries for help, but the latex was firmly attached to your head. as of now, it was sticking to more and more of your skin while you pulled on it that You don’t know how much strength you have left to pull off this grey rat&#39;s face.<br />
<br />
Finally though, you gave up and resign yourself to your fate. The fate of having this latex grey rat&#39;s head as if it was your own. Though not completely merged just yet as you felt submissive to defeat by the mask that you were unaware of this, but the mask sensed the detection of this for it shortly after doubles its efforts on you.<br />
<br />
Wiping away the sweat that was beading on your face, the mask was getting tighter as you felt your face stretch out before you for you felt it filling in the muzzle. Your human skull was immediately flowing into the hollow rodent features of the mask that your eyes are now pressed up against the roof of the mask&#39;s eyes, forcing yours to close for a moment as they were reopen to reveal nothing but darkness for you shortly after though open them a second time to see the world through outside of the mask. However, your perspective was set in two different directions that it didn&#39;t take you to long on figuring out on how the printed rat eyes on the outside of the mask works to being your new eyes as they were now yours. Trying to get used to your new perspective was having complications on working with your brain as this was sorting itself around it, even if it was causing a-lot of difficulty to give you a headache. Still though, the two black holes that once served as your only view to the outside for your new eyes were now permanently sealed up to nothing while the mask takes in the world around you even better.<br />
<br />
Still feeling your face being stretched out more as you feel your jaw extending out to fill in the void like no human head could that it soon reached to the end of the mask of the full length of the muzzle, where the sent and taist of latex grew its strongest. With your nose and mouth now pressing up against the edge of the mask as they were shortly after dissipated that for the first time in a while, you smelt something other then latex. You smelt everything in the basement, even to what was on the metal poles from every stain that you took it all in with enough detail as it was Enough to blow your mind.<br />
<br />
Soon after, the long latex muzzle started to part with very none latex teeth and a rodent like red tongue that the teeth were now sharp with two buck like teeth in front as the muzzle merged with your mouth. This was making it your new mouth as you start to feel with your new tongue across your teeth, feeling how sharp they were while taisting the latex at the edge of your mouth on your lips. You suddenly felt a swift tingling at the top of your spine as you feel the plastic conjoined with your face, digging the false mask with yours for it roots into what&#39;s left of your new rodent skull.<br />
<br />
Without a second thought though that as the changes were now completed, the mask was now one with your new head for there was no way to hide this out in public. You let out a very rat like squeaking sigh as you rub your head, feeling the stimulation through out the latex that you somehow knew this was now merged with your face. It felt like you went though hell and back as you shortly realized that something was amidst here while getting extremely frustrated to when you decided on tugging the rat face off of yours, not believing this to be true when you then screamed in pain. it was like you were pulling on your own skin that you swallowed your fear to be true, when you began to see your reflection on what your latex rat face doing with yours as you shortly gave up on the tugging of the mask.<br />
<br />
&quot;WHAT THE HELL.....!?&quot; You said out loud as you then froze for the mask was perfectly mimicking on what your actual face was doing! you then tried squiggling your nose as you were treated to the sight of the pink Rodent nose moving too while also finding that you could open and close the muzzle at will by easily moving up your mouth, doing a little bit of pretend panting with the sight of the pink rat tongue sticking out for a bit.<br />
<br />
Just standing there while looking at yourself that you couldn’t help yourself as to remember why you were actually wanting to wear this latex grey rat mask in the first place, even if you twisted around in front of the mirror once to view all of the angles on what wearing this actually meant to you. it looked like the latex had also lenghened a bit in fact, back to when it had begun to cover your face. You look down at yourself that reality starts to set in, It&#39;s as though the latex head was placed onto your human body. If you were into furry stuff that your new head of a latex grey rat looks incredibly hot, even to you.<br />
<br />
&quot;OH MY GOD!&quot; You said out loud as A sudden shiver of cold air ran down your spine as it had a sudden sensation that In a sudden fit of desperation, you let out a animalistic cry of shock. Quickly after this shocking turn of events that you hurried and covered your snout in fear of what you just did. You try to resist letting another out, but it was no use as You unwilling cock your head back and let out a cold chilling cry of a loud squeak that you were having tears falling out of your eyes.<br />
<br />
You were Blushing red about this as you were just signaling there&#39;s something in the basement, even if it came out of you that shortly after releasing this Screech is where no one bothered of checking out the sudden out burst you made. Everyone out side thought that you were watching a strange horror movie or something as they payed no attention to this and went off on to their own business, like usual. this gave you a sign of relief as You sighed while looking out from the basement window that you return your sights back to the mirror, thinking that this how egyptian gods looked like with their animal like heads. You found yourself not looking like you, but still somewhat human that you were quietly talking to yourself for you didn&#39;t noticed earlier on how your voice was sounding a little different, almost squeaker then usual.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok, just... calm down. you can fix this. you&#39;re just stuck with this mask on, that&#39;s all. Nothing to worry about. Still, it is cool for a good look rat. That said, how do I take it off? People are going to think weirly about me, with this on. Besides, my friends are coming over tonight as it&#39;s game night for Warhammer. If it doesn&#39;t, then maybe I can convince them that I decided to wear a rat mask while helping me out with my character in the game. Not telling them that it&#39;s real, let alone on what happened to me. I mean, come on... I&#39;m A rat man. the only thing that I&#39;m missing is a tail. still, at least thighs can’t get any worse than this... right?&quot; You said while mumbling to yourself as you were getting nervous on what the others will think of you, let alone on how they will take it that something was building up inside of you. Not sure as to why you said that when things can always get worse.<br />
<br />
Panicking was only going to make things worse that on option of fleeing far away out of your home, you needed to get out of the house as soon as possible. However, that wouldn&#39;t solve anything for what good would it do you in a state your in. Even if you did as you would be stuck with this latex face of a rat for the rest of your life that you would not be knowing on how to take it off, let alone on why this was happening to you. so the only option for you was to stay here and enjoy your erotic looks as you took deep breaths, taking in the fresh air while thinking of your next plan was at.<br />
<br />
Leaving the mirror behind that you began to enjoy the sexy sense of enjoyment from the mask as you walked away of it. if anyone was seeing you now, they would never believe that you were once a kind person you were before wearing this mask on. Shortly thinking about your parents that, maybe you shouldn&#39;t have donned the latex mask of the grey rat on.<br />
<br />
&quot;Crap! My parents! What will they think of me? Especially if they see me with... this.&quot; You said out loud, Or at least try to as it mostly came out by squeaks. Ludicrously for within a moment as you instantly catch something to your eye, there was only one thought that was running across your mind. what are you going to do now?<br />
<br />
