<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Janace &quot;Ranch&quot; was a small and tranquil place that Jess had envisioned. The land had been part of an old west mining town in Colorado that went bust when the silver that was being mined there ran out. Jess originally pictured raising sheep there in a sort of simpler life than what she had had to deal with in Fee City, and thus for years a portion of her paychecks went to buying the land. The vision had changed with the Chakat Virus outbreak in Fee City and the decision to start over. Janace Ranch wasn&#39;t the first Chakat community, thanks to the outbreak, THAT honor went to Fee City, but it was the first founded by Chakats. Jess&#39;s idea for it now was shi, her mate, and hir family could get to a more private and secluded life than they would in Fee City. Even with the city being populated by Chakats and Foxkats and with all the changes to the city&#39;s laws, that didn&#39;t mean that people didn&#39;t come in and ask rather intrusive questions. For those that liked the spotlight, it wasn&#39;t too bad, but Jess wasn&#39;t like that, and shi was also fairly certain that hir mate and family wouldn&#39;t want it either. So, the new start was to give them some privacy.<br />
<br />
However, the call requesting they go to Paris had raised some confusion.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wonder why they want all of us,&quot; Sally wondered quietly to Charlie as they waited in front of their home, waiting for Jess to come by with the truck that had been made for them, &quot;not that seeing Paris is a bad idea... but why all of us? We aren&#39;t soldiers or scientists... shoot, my job in Fee City was retail and you were an accountant...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And now we&#39;re sheep ranchers,&quot; Charlie nodded, &quot;maybe it&#39;s because you&#39;re Jess&#39;s sither and they know Jess helped solve the issue in Fee City... so they figure you can help.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sally looked over Charlie watching as Charlie held their two kittens. The coloration on the Chakat kitten that Charlie gave birth to was a bit of a surprise, as no cat was naturally pink, and Sally wasn&#39;t pink, Charlie wasn&#39;t pink, and Nikole wasn&#39;t pink. It was ultimately Maurice and Snowy that explained that since every species of cat&#39;s DNA went into the Chakat Virus, it was quite possible that some things mutated genetically with regard to colors in ways that couldn&#39;t easily explained. The sight of hir mate holding their children to hir furry breasts made joy rise inside her and she didn&#39;t care so much about how they looked. She also got the feeling that Charlie didn&#39;t care either as both kitten&#39;s nursed from hir breasts, as a contented smile was on hir muzzle.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe,&quot; Sally then agreed.<br />
<br />
&quot;More then likely it&#39;s part of our parole,&quot; came Snowy&#39;s voice.<br />
<br />
Both Sally and Charlie looked over to see Snowy coming up with Maurice behind hir. Snowy was presently four months pregnant the first real signs of a baby bulge in her lower half&#39;s &quot;belly&quot; was becoming obvious. It was hard to tell where the &quot;belly&quot; on a Chakat or Foxkat was, mostly because of their taur bodies. The area where their stomachs and reproductive organs were in their human torsos was solid muscle, all the way to their spines, allowing a Chakat or Foxkat to hold their torsos erect while standing on their four feet. Their stomachs, intestines, kidneys, liver and other such organs were in the &quot;chest&quot; of their cat or fox-like bodies protected by a second set of ribs and their first set of hips in front of them.  Their reproductive organs were back near their rear legs, but since that belly area wasn&#39;t also containing other organs, Chakats and Foxkats had very large ova, uterus, and internal testes. This allowed for Chakats and Foxkats to give birth to fully formed infants and not having to give birth prematurely the way mundane cats and foxes did in the wild.<br />
<br />
&quot;We could have been charged with the various assault and rape charges that came out of the Chakat Virus,&quot; Maurice then continued, &quot;the government agreed to grant us a parole under the condition that we deliver Jess&#39;s Foxkat Vaccine to them for distribution wherever the the Chakat Virus might spring up again and that Chakat Industries be dismantled to pay those that had personal grievances against us... the parole also included having to name persons responsible... and we chose Jess and Nikole for what they did in Fee City.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sally and Charlie nodded, remembering the exact details that they had explained while on the way to Janace Ranch. Sally and Charlie didn&#39;t forgive the two quickly, but the fact that they were apologetic and had helped remodel the houses had earned it. Especially when Sally, Charlie, Nikole, and Jess entered their ninth month of pregnancy and felt more content to relax and feel their infants move inside them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... whatever the reason,&quot; Charlie commented, &quot;Perhaps this will be one grand adventure.&quot;<br />
<br />
The others nodded as Jess and Nikole arrived in the customized truck. It was essentially an old WW2 deuce and a half&#39;s frame with alterations to allow for a lot of cushioning and space for their taur-like bodies. As Jess brought it to a halt, Charlie, Sally, Maurice, and Snowy easily climbed in, even while Charlie continued to breast feed hir and Sally&#39;s kittens.<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
They drove only as far as Denver where they were greeted at the airport by a Foxkat wearing what looked like a bulletproof vest with the letters FBI in gold capital letters on it. Like Jess, she was based off a Fennec Fox, though hir fur was a lighter shade of creamish tan than Jess&#39;s was. Beside hir was a Chakat that gave all of them a bit of a start. Unlike all other Foxkats and Chakats that they had seen, this Chakat had no fur and was wearing a cotton tank-top that covered a rather impressive set of breasts.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello again, Jess,&quot; the Foxkat said politely, &quot;we&#39;d like to thank you all for coming.&quot;<br />
<br />
At the sound of hir voice, Jess recognized one of the volunteers that had come from outside Fee City&#39;s quarantine zone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello, Maria,&quot; Jess said in a friendly voice, &quot;I didn&#39;t expect to see you again...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You know hir?&quot; Nikole wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, this is Maria Sanjaro of the FBI,&quot; Jess answered, &quot;Shi&#39;s one of the FBI agents that came in during the outbreak in Fee City.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Rodriguez now,&quot; Maria answered, &quot;This is my mate, Juan.&quot;<br />
<br />
Shi then gestured to the Chakat with her. Shi had no fur, but hir skin seemed to have two color shades to it, one was pink and the other was black.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m a Sphinx based Chakat,&quot; Juan said slowly.<br />
<br />
The others then nodded at the recognition of the hairless breed of cat.<br />
<br />
&quot;Anyway, I&#39;ve been tasked by the FBI and our contacts with Interpol to take you to France where it would appear that the Chakat Virus has spread and perhaps even mutated,&quot; Maria answered, &quot;though Juan and I can not remain in France. You&#39;ll have to work with Interpol and French Law Enforcement agencies when you arrive there. Though we will expect some scientific reports...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course,&quot; Maurice and Snowy nodded. They didn&#39;t remember the Foxkat exactly, but they were fairly certain that shi was probably part of the group that had found the proof that Chakat Industries was responsible for the outbreak in Fee City and the smaller outbreaks that occurred in the cities near Fee City.<br />
<br />
&quot;We have a cargo plane to go in that has been furnished for Chakats and Foxkats,&quot; Maria answered, &quot;hopefully things go well...&quot;<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
The flight went relatively well with Maria and Juan ultimately fawning over Janice and Pinkie, Sally and Charlie&#39;s kittens, and Silky and Foxy, Nikole and Jess&#39;s kit/kitten hybrids. The infants seemed to enjoy the attention, but preferred to remain close to their respective parents. They eventually touched down at Charles De Gaulle International Airport outside of Paris to be met two men in French police uniforms and one man in the dress uniform of the French army. They were also flanked by several scientists and lower ranking officials.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good evening,&quot; the French general spoke in perfect English, though with an obvious accent and a tone that indicated that he would much rather be using his own language rather than English.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good evening,&quot; Snowy came forward, &quot;I&#39;m Catherine Snow and this is Maurice Chakat... the rest here are &quot;friends&quot; that will help us with whatever has happened. We also apologize for our mistakes affecting your country.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You had better be sorry,&quot; the French general answered gruffly, &quot;It is bad enough your government encourages your people to call us cowards at every opportunity but now you&#39;re own attempts at playing God is now plaguing us.&quot;<br />
<br />
One of the men looking more like a scientist came forward and scolded the general in French, &quot;Calmez-vous, Claude. Ils sont là pour vous aider avec quelque chose que nous n&#39;étions pas préparés pour.&quot;<br />
<br />
Maurice understood enough to understand that the French scientist was getting the French general to back off, at least a little. The scientist then turned to them.<br />
<br />
&quot;I apologize for General Heroud&#39;s lack of tact in the matter,&quot; the scientist said slowly, &quot;his sister is believed to be one of the virus&#39;s victims.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And it is the Chakat Virus?&quot; Snowy asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Or at least something similar,&quot; the scientist nodded, &quot;It started in the northern part of Paris, but the population has not been turning only into Chakats.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not only Chakats?&quot; Maurice asked, &quot;There are Foxkats too?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They are turning into hermaphroditic taurs of various woodland creatures, many of which are American woodland creatures,&quot; General Heroud grumbled, and his voice was very icy when he said the word &quot;American.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The greater problem is that the Foxkat Vaccine that your country has given us is only in syringes to vaccinate any Chakat that might be carrying the virus,&quot; the scientist cut the general off, &quot;we do not have any Foxkats here that could stop it&#39;s spread. And that isn&#39;t the prime issue... the prime issue is that we believe the virus is now airborne... you are likely immune as the genetic data we have on America&#39;s Chakats and Foxkats would indicate that you&#39;re immune and that the vaccine might stop the spread... but...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If the virus has been altered to allow it to spread that way as well through sex, you&#39;re looking at a potential pandemic that will not stop until it engulfs everything,&quot; Snowy finished.<br />
<br />
&quot;And the resulting Chakats and similar creatures are actually violently aggressive if they face potential resistance,&quot; the scientist nodded, &quot;they killed four policemen when they tried to set up the quarantine and infected twelve others. It took the army to complete the quarantining of the northern part of Paris, and not without killing five Chakats that rushed toward them. &quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If it&#39;s airborne, quarantining the section of the city won&#39;t work,&quot; Snowy warned, &quot;it could easily blow across a street or down a street and people who didn&#39;t come in contact with it could become carriers and not know it until they start to physically become &quot;kats&quot; and by then it could be too late.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you saying we need to evacuate the capital of France?!&quot; General Heroud blurted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Quite possibly, along with blood testing centers to see who&#39;s been infected and who has not,&quot; Jess spoke up, her own years as a medical doctor coming to the fore, &quot;if one is infected we can give them the vaccine. It won&#39;t prevent their eventual transformation and they probably will still be somewhat aroused when they do transform... but if the vaccine still stops the virus, even in its mutated state, the new &quot;kat&quot; won&#39;t be able to infect anyone and will be in control over themselves.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This is Jessica Cain-Wise,&quot; Snowy introduced Jess, &quot;She actually developed the vaccine that stopped the spread of the Chakat Virus in America. Shi and hir mate and hir family are here to help us.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re actually hoping you all can go in and spread the vaccine,&quot; the top French policeman spoke up, &quot;once they&#39;re in their right minds again we can begin to go in and find out what brought your virus here, and the army will make sure that no one can escape the quarantine zone.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We can do that,&quot; Nikole spoke, &quot;but Jess can look at what data you have and help scientifically and Maurice and Snowy can obviously provide you with more exact details on the original Chakat Virus.&quot;<br />
<br />
That seemed acceptable to the French officials. Even the grumpy French General Heroud seemed to accept that.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you have a place to stay?&quot; the French scientist asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Snowy answered, &quot;My niece lives in Paris. We intend to stay there.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She can also look after our babies,&quot; Jess commented, holding Foxy to her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay then,&quot; the Scientist nodded, &quot;We&#39;ll let you get settled and then you can get a start on the work tomorrow.&quot;<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
Meanwhile at Kelsey and Alexis&#39;s apartment the young American resident in France hid quietly in a small closet thankfully after finding and dumping enough perfume to make it difficult for the Skunkat Danna to smell her out. Alexis could hear Kelsey and Mikkie mating furiously out in the dining room. However, that was the least of Alexis&#39;s concerns.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come out, Alex!&quot; Danna called from Alexis&#39;s bed, &quot;I... only... oh yes... want to... fuck!&quot;<br />
<br />
Alexis only watched as the Skunkat continued to rub hir new penis with her taur side&#39;s forelimbs and had brought hirself to another orgasm firing a large load of semen that hit something across the room that Alexis couldn&#39;t see. She hoped it was only the wall. At the same time, Danna was also flicking hir black and white tail about furiously and it was spreading a very different perfume about the room. It smelled... arousing... and Danna hoped someone would come to her rescue before the Skunkat or the two Chakats outside found her... or before she grew too wet to resist the perfume that Danna was spraying.</p>
