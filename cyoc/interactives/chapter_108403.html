<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><b>&quot;OH WOW!&quot;</b> exclaimed the weretigress, collapsing on top of her werepanther, the barbs of his penis still keeping his hard shaft buried deep inside her moist and very hungry vagina at the moment. &quot;Talk about animal magnetism!&quot;<br />
&quot;I know,&quot; agreed Lance Knight, as he held Lila Carpenter&#39;s furry body against his, caressing the soft curves even as his paws teased her rump and the base of the weretigress&#39; tail. &quot;You are definitely an insatiable animal in bed my lady.&quot;<br />
&quot;Not quite <i>that</i> insatiable,&quot; she teased, smiling at him before she started preening his neck and muzzle with her tongue. &quot;I may always be wanting more of a certain werepanther, but you fill and satisfy me VERY well,&quot; proclaimed Lila, before she started kissing him.<br />
<br />
After her brother Rick left after helping his sister move into her new boyfriend&#39;s home, Lance tried helping her unpack and settle in, but the only thing on Lila&#39;s mind was how quickly they could undress, assume their respective fursonas and start having sex together. &quot;I REALLY needed that, and you,&quot; she purred, before Lila laid her head on Lance&#39;s shoulder and started nuzzling his neck.<br />
&quot;Tough day at the office?&quot; he asked, referring to her job as Assistant Comptroller for Moon Lake, while gently stroking her back and shoulder blades.<br />
&quot;Busy,&quot; Lila clarified. &quot;I still have to grab my laptop and finish prepping those budget expenditure reports for tomorrow.&quot;<br />
&quot;For better or worse, you&#39;re not going anywhere just yet honey,&quot; said Lance with a smile, before twitching his cock to prove it was still well secured inside her. &quot;While we&#39;re waiting, if you don&#39;t want to talk about your own past, can you at least tell me why my brother is on your brother&#39;s hit parade?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Rick inherited sole ownership of the garage from our father, as well as co-ownership of the house we grew up in with me, when our parents decided to travel to Africa to do missionary work with a pride of weretigers there. Something about getting back to our animal ancestral roots or something like that. Mom and dad are barely into their 160s, so personally I think they just wanted to experience hot sex in the wild, but anyway... One day Rick thought he scored a major business coup by getting the service contract to the local fleet of Knight Industries&#39; automobiles here in Moon Lake.&quot;<br />
&quot;Which, depending upon exactly when we&#39;re talking about, could range between 12 and 24 vehicles for local employees to use when on duty and company business, which would be a nice profit for a garage,&quot; replied Lance.<br />
&quot;One would think,&quot; agreed Lila. &quot;But whether it was Benton Knight himself, an intermediary acting upon his behalf, or some flunky who thought Benton should get the most for his money; someone started complaining about just about everything my brother and his employees did. It even got to the point where they would start nitpicking about minor stuff like finding a gum wrapper in an ashtray, or a map not being folded properly in the glove box.&quot;<br />
&quot;That last part sounds more like my sister-in-law Amanda, but she rarely has anything to do with the business besides enjoying Benton&#39;s money and social status,&quot; observed Lance. &quot;Please continue.&quot;<br />
&quot;When the initial trial period on the contract expired, Knight Industries didn&#39;t renew it. Rick had mixed feeling about that, but what really pissed him off was the fact that even though he honored his commitments and finished up the work he had in progress, the garage was never paid for that because Knight Industries considered it unauthorized repairs after the contract had expired,&quot; explained Lila.<br />
&quot;How much are we talking?&quot; wondered Lance.<br />
&quot;Not sure if interest can be applied, but 5 years ago when this happened, about $3800 and change. Rick was told it wouldn&#39;t be worth going to small claims court over, considering who he&#39;d be dealing with. Obviously the garage has survived the outstanding debt, but the situation still gnaws at my brother, which is why he won&#39;t have anything to do with the Knight family.&quot;<br />
&quot;Except me,&quot; said Lance, before kissing Lila.<br />
&quot;Considering our relationship, technically you&#39;re on probation with Rick until you prove your worth in his eyes.&quot;<br />
&quot;But you?&quot; wondered Lance.<br />
&quot;I&#39;m here, and madly in love with you,&quot; said Lila, before kissing Lance. &quot;Now then, can I ask you a question?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I have no secrets. Ask away,&quot; said Lance, while turning so the couple were now laying on their sides together.<br />
&quot;Being a were, I couldn&#39;t help overhearing both sides of the conversation with your brother about the werepanther meeting Tuesday night.&quot;<br />
&quot;I see,&quot; said Lance, thinking he knew what Lila was about to ask. &quot;Well, obviously neither of us are virgins, but even though I&#39;m only 32, I sowed most of my wild oats back between having my first transformation and my early 20s. Nowadays, I&#39;m looking for something much more in a relationship than just sex.&quot;<br />
&quot;That&#39;s funny. So am I,&quot; said Lila with a smile, before nuzzling closer to him.<br />
&quot;Even if I wasn&#39;t the temporary werepanther representative on the Elders&#39; Council now, I&#39;d want to be at the meeting tomorrow night at least long enough for Frieda&#39;s friends to be inducted into the pride. But afterward, I intend to come directly home to you,&quot; he promised.<br />
&quot;Aww....&quot; said Lila, before kissing him again. &quot;That&#39;s sweet. But what I really wanted to know more about was your brother saying I couldn&#39;t attend the meeting unless I was your wife.&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh...&quot; said Lance, realizing what was on his new girlfriend&#39;s mind. &quot;You can rest assured that I&#39;m not going to stray or cheat on you. But when it comes to love and romance, I&#39;m kind of more of a traditionalist, so moving in together has been a pretty big and sudden step for me. On one paw, it shows how strongly I feel about you Lila Carpenter, because you&#39;re the first woman who has spent any significant amount of time here. My niece Frieda obviously doesn&#39;t count and anyone else hasn&#39;t been here more than a date or two at the most.&quot;<br />
&quot;I see, and on the other paw?&quot; she wondered.<br />
&quot;A much stronger and longer commitment has been on my mind since we started getting serious, but please let me proceed at my own pace,&quot; requested Lance. <i>Besides, I wasn&#39;t going to go engagement ring shopping until closer to Christmas.</i><br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re right. I do tend to come on strong at times,&quot; agreed Lila.<br />
&quot;I thought that was a positive sign of being strong willed and assertive,&quot; said Lance.<br />
&quot;Thank you kind sir,&quot; she said, before kissing his cheek. &quot;Like I said before, I initially wasn&#39;t planning anything more your first night at the Elders&#39; Council beyond just meeting the new guy, but the moment I first saw you...&quot; purred Lila, while gently running a paw across his chest. &quot;There was just something special about the handsome werepanther before me that said <i>HE&#39;S THE ONE!</i>&quot;<br />
&quot;Really? There&#39;s been no one in my life like you before.&quot;<br />
&quot;Then face it panther, you just hit the jackpot!&quot; said Lila, misquoting a comic book of her brother&#39;s youth.<br />
&quot;We&#39;re both fortunate, my love,&quot; purred Lance in return, before events led to Lila having a longer wait than originally planned before her panther&#39;s penis finally slipped out of her tigress cunt so she could finish her budget reports.<br />
Not that neither of them complained about the delay...</p>
