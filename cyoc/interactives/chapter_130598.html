<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After three hours of driving, and no further accidents, Kaitlin and Laura found themselves only an hour away from their destination. Despite their worries about the dice rolling again both women sheepishly admittedly that being back in their twenties wasn’t exactly a bad thing.<br />
<br />
“Well as crazy as this is it’s not so bad,” Kaitlin mused as she hefted her breasts up. “I mean I’ve probably dropped about 10 pounds around my hips and stomach and more boobs are definitely perkier.” Laura laughed as she glanced over at her friend. “Okay maybe,” she smirked. “Being 28 isn’t too bad. Okay sure my skirt is a little loose but we do look good. I never realized just how tired I was looking. Knocking 15 years off myself makes me look....so refreshed.”<br />
<br />
“See,” Kaitlin smiled. “Now all we have to do is turn the dice over to whoever owns them and then poof we can hopefully stay like this. Turning 30 in a few months definitely sounds better than turning 40.”<br />
<br />
“Forty isn’t so bad,” Laura said. “I mean at least it wasn’t for me. Still though I’ll be happy to give these dice back. I’m still worried about the dice rolling again. Being 28 is nice but what happens if it rolls again? A big roll by either of us would put us back in college and then after that...well I don’t want to think about it.”<br />
<br />
Kaitlin glanced at the attractive brunette, Laura still looked nervous as they continued down the road. While Kaitlin was thoroughly enjoying her newfound youth Laura seemed apprehensive. The way Kaitlin looked at it the two women had been given a second chance. While Laura may not want it Kaitlin certainly did, being single in her late thirties wasn’t exactly appealing to her. Kaitlin had never found anyone after a string of unsuccessful boyfriends. As she crept closer to forty and saw most of her friends settling down and even having kids she was beginning to worry she would end up some ancient spinster alone with a house full of cats. It was the reason she and Laura got along so well. Laura, although she didn’t want to admit it, was also worried about growing old alone. <br />
<br />
Laura , despite taking her marriage for granted, had enjoyed having someone to come home to at night. On the few occasions she had come to Laura’s home before the divorce she could see how at ease she was being married. Laura may have been an independent woman but a part of her loved having a significant other. Kaitlin grinned trying to put her friend at ease. “Laura relax,” she said. “Listen we’ve gotten the box secured at this point and nothing has happened. All we need to do is return the dice and We should be okay.”<br />
<br />
Laura nodded stiffly before looking down at the dashboard. “Ugh down to a quarter tank,” she groaned. Looking down the road she noticed a rest station. Pulling into the right lane Laura made her way towards the pump. Turning off the engine Laura took a deep breath, momentarily staring out towards the brightly lit rest stop. “Kaitlin,” she started. “Listen I’ll pay for the gas but I’m kinda hungry too. You think you can grab us some food?”<br />
<br />
“Sure no problem,” she said. “But why do you look so nervous?”<br />
<br />
“I...I’m nervous about leaving the dice alone in the car,” Laura whispered. “What happens if someone steals them or if something happens to the box while we’re out of the car.” Kaitlin smiled at her friend, taking her hand in hers she now tried her best to put her fears at ease.<br />
<br />
“Laura listen to me,” she soothed. “Look it’s late and no ones around. The box is pretty stable right now but if you’re that nervous then maybe one of us should hold on to it then.”<br />
<br />
“What if we drop the box?”<br />
<br />
“Will you stop,” Kaitlin giggled. “Look if your that freaked out why don’t you just put them on the hood or something. Whatever you do though just make sure your comfortable alright. I’m not worried Laura and I think you should just try to relax Okay?”<br />
<br />
Laura nodded stiffly and sighed. Kaitlin did have a point, she was worrying about things far too much. Yes if the dice rolled things could get very bad but they had secured the box to the best of their ability. In the last couple of hours nothing had happened to the dice, they were safe for now. She should be careful yes but she shouldn’t be irrational about it. “Okay your right,” she mumbled. “I guess I’m just freaking out that’s all. Still maybe we should hold on to the dice if we’re not around just in case.”<br />
<br />
Kaitlin rubbed her chin thoughtfully before nodding in agreement. “Good idea,” she said. “Listen just put them on the trunk or something while we’re not in the car. That way you can keep an eye on them.” Laura agreed, as the two women exited the car Laura went to pay for gas while Kaitlin waited. As soon as she returned Kaitlin placed the dice next to Laura while she pumped gas. <br />
<br />
WAtching Kaitlin enter the rest stop Laura couldn’t help but feel foolish as she looked at the box. She was being overly cautious, normally just pumping gas wouldn’t give Her this much concern. That she was this concerned about someone taking the car showed just how worried she was about the dice. “Get it together girl,” she sighed. As the pump shut off Laura removed the nozzle, replacing it back in the pump. Looking towards the rest stop Laura could see Kaitlin emerging with a couple of bags of food in hand. Kaitlin waved and smiled putting Laura more at ease.<br />
<br />
Suddenly without warning a strong breeze picked up around the car. Laura hugged herself as she looked around in bewilderment. Turning towards the box Laura’s eyes went wide as she saw the box begin to move. Before she could do anything she watched as the breeze swept the box off the car causing it to tumble towards the ground.mkaitlin and Laura’s eyes went wide as the box hit the floor, breaking its seal and spilling the dice. Laura and Kaitlin made a mad dash towards the dice as they rolled.<br />
<br />
“Twenty nine and Twenty eight years you have both walked this world. Now those numbers are but twenty three and twenty two. Each roll of the dice returns what you have lost.”<br />
<br />
Kaitlin and Laura could see themselves glowing as orbs of light began to float from their bodies. “I’m 22,” Laura thought in horror as Kaitlin and her made their way toward the dice. Both women left at the dice to grab them befor anyfurther harm could come to them. “Watch out,” Kaitlin screamed, still glowing. Laura and Kaitlin now awkwardly tried to avoid eachother as they tried to grab the dice. Unfortunately both women accidentally knocked the dice again causing them to roll away from them.<br />
<br />
“Noooo,” they screamed.<br />
<br />
“Twenty three and twenty years you have both walked this world. Now that number is but twenty and nineteen. Each roll of the dice returns what you have lost.”<br />
<br />
Kaitlin and Laura listened to the ghostly voice as they conintued to glow. Laura watched as her friend continued to grow younger. She could see as her face became younger losing the maturity of adulthood as she inches closer to her teenage years. Kaitlin’s outfit also seems to be somewhat looser on her as her hips narrowed while her breasts became perky, losing their fullness.<br />
<br />
As the lights finally faded the two girls now gawked at eachother. For Laura she was almost inconsolable. “Nineteen,” She’s thought, noticing how loose her skirt was now. “I’m only nineteen! What’s going to happen to me now?” Turning to Kaitlin she could see the college coed gaping at her appearance.<br />
<br />
Laura was now a somewhat skinny teenager with beautiful brown hair and a youthful face. The girls clothing seemed several sizes too big on her. Kaitlin could see Laura absentmindedly grab at a skirt that was in danger of sliding down her narrower hips. Kaitlin’s once proud breasts, while perkier than before, seemed to have lost some of the mass of adulthood. The girls breasts now seemed a little smaller than before despite still being c cups.<br />
<br />
Tears fell silently between the two women as they carefully grabbed the dice and returned them to the box. Slowly they stood in silence before entering the car and closing the door. They had been so careful with everything that they were dumbfounded how this could happen. The only answer they could come up with was that the dice were trying to roll themselves. If they didn’t move quickly they could easily find themselves reliving their childhood.</p>
