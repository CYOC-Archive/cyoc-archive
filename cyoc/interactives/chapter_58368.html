<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Fran's dog Chester the Chihuahua didn't seek much in life, as long as his belly was full <br />
and his masters gave him the attention he sought, he was happy.  He thanked Fenrir <br />
that those giant cats were finally leaving! They were even larger than the bright colored <br />
'big cats' that he smelled on occasion.  Now he could come out of hiding…  The dog <br />
enjoyed Mr. P's company, and knew the giant cats were friends with his masters, but <br />
enough was enough.  While god-like entities angst, police chiefs started new lives, and <br />
apes went to go live with ponies, the little Chihuahua with no clue what had transpired, <br />
and no memory of any timeline except this one, simply hunted for his food bowl. And <br />
life went on. <br />
<br />
++++++++<br />
<br />
In the forest Jack and Marcine slept together. Having no memory of ever being human <br />
in a timeline that no longer existed. Jack and Marcine Jr also slept nearby. Adam slept <br />
alone his doe and child no more thanks to Kurse. <br />
<br />
The Gold Deer had survived, lived and died in North America for centuries, millennia.  <br />
Not a single thing about the golden deer had changed in that time. The predators were <br />
much the same even if the numbers of different threats had increased and decreased <br />
over the generations. But the same names had been passed down from parent to child <br />
in an endless cycle. And the Golden Deer were perfectly happy with that. Besides, this <br />
silly thing called 'civilization' that the two legged creatures engaged in would certainly <br />
collapse on it's own any day now . . . <br />

When Father Paul arrived at Ponyland Farm he was immediately greeted by a group of <br />
cartoon horses, a few that looked smaller than the others. <br />
<br />
&quot;Everyone.&quot; Never-Star said, &quot;This is our new live in priest Father Paul, he'll be joining <br />
our farm.&quot; <br />
<br />
Ruby innocently crept closer and looked up at the big man, &quot;You're big.&quot;<br />
<br />
Father Paul nodded and signed hello.  Valentines seemed to be able to read his sign <br />
language. <br />
<br />
Father Paul realized perhaps they had made a grievous error. 'I wished I could speak.' <br />
<br />
At once Father Paul's orange fur and black skin became orange hide, extra hands <br />
became uniform stump 'hooves' as a faded orange horse mane and tail grew and his <br />
face pushed out and his ears moved to the top of his head became triangular.  A cross <br />
appeared on his rear as he grew long eyelashes and his eye became baby blue. She still <br />
had her cross around her neck. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hello! I'm Orange Tang! Ha ha!&quot; She could SPEAK!  She calmly walked several feet from <br />
the rest of the farm houses and gently scratched the dirt. <br />
<br />
A pink and white church rose out of the ground almost at once, providing a place of <br />
worship for those who wanted. And Orange Tang sang songs of praise, she could <br />
SPEAK!  'Just wait till brother sees me NOW!'  &quot;Glory to God in the highest! And Peace to <br />
his people on Earth~.&quot;  <br />

Of course the leomans being released from the lupman's medical wing had an <br />
immediate side effect of causing the leoman cascade to spread to their families and <br />
their family's friends in a viable explosion. Not the leoman noticed. <br />
<br />
There were plenty of civil suits of course for loss of business by those with particularly <br />
deep pockets. Those who had been offering has been models the chance to live out <br />
eternity as door dummies or works of art appealing to their vanity.  And no talent <br />
hacks who had the gall to call themselves artists who had used the game to cover up <br />
their lack of creative-voice. And of course the lowest of the low thinly veiled human <br />
traffickers who should have already been in prison who used the game to turn people <br />
into slaves. And of course the precious few people who used the game to HELP THEIR <br />
FELLOW MAN. <br />
<br />
Mayor Joseph Hune was attacked on all sides  by those who had been using the game <br />
for one scheme or another. It was a relentless assault. <br />
<br />
Eventually Joseph Hune had to step down as mayor to get away from the wrath of <br />
corporate wolves who had their paws in the edge of Glendale wanting to keep the curse <br />
their own. Now that the game was gone, they had little reason to remain and vacated <br />
the town, leaving many suddenly laid off. <br />
<br />
No one said taking the dagger out was going to not lead to scars. <br />
<br />
&quot;HOW DARE YOU DO THIS!&quot; The doctor roared, &quot;IT'S BAD ENOUGH YOUR KIND HOLDS <br />
BACK MEDICAL SCIENCE FOR YOUR SUPERSTITIOUS PHOBIAS BUT NOW THIS?!&quot; <br />
<br />
Father Mike was surprisingly calm (to say he wasn't scared would be a lie) when the <br />
doctor -the state's local gun store waiting period later- screamed at at the priest who <br />
had discovered and produced Merlin's cure. <br />
<br />
That was when Anne got between the doctor and Father Mike. <br />
<br />
&quot;Out of the way. This killer needs to be punished! Because of him people I could have <br />
saved are going to die!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;That game nearly killed my family and DID kill two friends of mine!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;AND IT SAVED LIVES!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Did you ever think to just use it to give yourself the power to heal others so you <br />
wouldn't be spreading the curse?!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;If I did that, then when I died, it would die, but by giving others the game they can <br />
help others too!&quot; <br />
<br />
Father Mike sighed, &quot;You'll find most didn't use it like that--&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;YOU BE QUITE!&quot; <br />
<br />
That was when several lionesses tackled the doctor to the ground, and an orange My <br />
Little Pony out of nowhere used herself as a shield, the bullet fall off her after it made <br />
impact like it was a rain drop. <br />
<br />
Father Mike later refused to press charges. <br />
