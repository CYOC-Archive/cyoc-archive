<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As the two walked into the room and the door closed behind them, Rusty could feel the energy from the portal peak and it flooded the entire room. Suddenly, Rusty&#39;s eyes go wide, feeling the full werewolf in him begin to emerge. As Ben and David walked toward Rusty, Rusty smiled showing off his new fangs.<br />
<br />
David spoke in his average voice, which fit his average looks. &quot;Sir, are you feeling fine or do you need some help?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh no, I am just fine, in fact I feel better than I ever have!&quot; Rusty loved the way his voice sounded so deep and rough, then continued. &quot;I think it is the two of you that will need some help!&quot;<br />
<br />
Not knowing what that meant, Ben and David looked at each other quizzically. Then David spoke again. &quot;Rusty, we are both fine and in fact you look like you need help.&quot;<br />
<br />
The power of the portal flowed even heavier in the room now, forcing Rusty to change even further. Rusty&#39;s chest bloomed with muscle, while his entire arms and legs thickened even more with an insane amount of muscle. Rusty looked his new changes over, seeing that the cloth at the cuffs at his shorts that were once right at knee level, but were now a few inches above that from his thicker thighs. Rusty smiled even wider now, allowing Ben and David to see that his bicuspids were now long and sharp fangs. Still looking at himself, he saw that his exposed skin was tanned to a medium darkness, with rich and thick, dark brown body hair covering them. With Rusty&#39;s eyes opened wide, Ben and David saw them flash an amber color which was enough for them to want to vacate the room.<br />
<br />
Feeling that he had total control over the energy of the portal, Rusty created a sort of forcefield along the walls so they could not escape. These two men would be the first of his werewolf family, which Marcia would not be able to stop since there would eventually be enough that even she could not handle. When Ben and David got to the door they came in from and tried to touch the handle, the door disappeared as if it had never been there before. They quickly looked to the only other way out of the small room, but saw that it too had disappeared.<br />
<br />
Ben, whose voice was a nice baritone, spoke with fright. &quot;How... how is this possible?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my soon to be fellow werewolf, you don&#39;t get it do you? The portal, the one everyone has been looking for... it is here in this very room and I am it&#39;s guardian. It has given me total control of it&#39;s power to do as I please and now, it looks as though you two will be the first to be added into my new family.&quot; Rusty said as his body bulked up in a bit more muscle, his hands and feet had formed into paws with thick black cushy paw pads as well as long, sharp claws.<br />
<br />
As Ben and David cowered in the corner, Rusty walked up to them menacingly, while he completed his change into the werewolf. Rusty&#39;s face pushed out into a lupine snout, his nose black and moist, his ears longer and pointed, his long wolven tail sticking out of the waist band. Now standing in front of the two, Ben and David saw that his shirt was tattered and hanging loosely on his now muscular body. They also saw that Rusty&#39;s jean shorts were also tattered, with his thick fur poking through in large tufts. Enjoying the fear that they were emanating and the smell that came from it was invigorating. With the deep and gruff voice, Rusty decided that he would speak to the two.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... you two certainly are afraid of me... aren&#39;t you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Ben and David just nodded, not knowing what to do at this point. They were stuck with this werewolf in front of them and all the doors magically gone.<br />
<br />
&quot;I thought so! The smell of fear from you two is invigorating and I just love it! However, it is time to bring you into the fold and then we will take this house to be our den! AAAAAAAAAWWWWWWWWWWRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRROOOOOOOOOOOOO!&quot;<br />
<br />
Rusty made a quick slice across both of their chests in one fall swoop, infecting them with his new genes. Screaming out in pain and agony, blood pouring from the slices, Rusty made the energy build and cover the both of them. Almost instantly from the energy hitting them, the wounds were gone and they were quickly on their way to turning into werewolves themselves. Both Ben and David were average in every fashion of the word. However, they were quickly covered in mountains of muscle like Rusty was. Dark brown fur blossomed all over Ben and David, making them feel more like the animals they were becomings. As quickly as it started, Ben and David stood before Rusty in their wolven glory, with their shirts tattered and hanging loosely with their jean shorts in the same condition as Rusty&#39;s.<br />
<br />
&quot;Howls my brothers! Shall we go and transform all the male staff first, then kill the females?&quot;<br />
<br />
Ben and David answered simultaneously. &quot;Yes! Let us make the men here our brothers in the pack! The women are not privileged enough to receive the glorious gift that you have given us!&quot;<br />
<br />
Rusty howled once more, with his two brothers joining in on the cacophony. Rusty knew that his gift as a werewolf meant that because he was gay before this, everyone man that he or his brothers infected would act and feel the same way Rusty did along with Ben and David! Rusty couldn&#39;t wait till the house was theirs and when it was theirs, all of the werewolf family would celebrate however they wanted. For now, the focus was on the take over and the eventual death of Marcia Caldwell.</p>
