<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Perfect Lay Body Wash&quot; was the name brand printed on the label of the bubble-gum pink bottles of body soap. It had the image of the foot of a bed with a single bare leg sticking out of the side of the sheets. &quot;Get dirty with every wash.&quot;<br />
<br />
To say Carson was surprised by what he found would&#39;ve been an understatement. He blinked several times, staring at the bottle in his hand. He had a difficult time processing what he was seeing. In the open box was at least twenty more bottles of this stuff. And there were two more boxes! Carson quickly opened the other two boxes and found the same pink bottles in both. He stood up and massaged his forehead in irritation. He wasn&#39;t so much concerned about the quantity. It was a large number of bottles, but Hendricks had a tendency to buy more of something than what is needed. He was more concerned about the brand. There is no way Coach Hendricks had intentionally ordered this brand of soap. Carson looked at the shipping label on the box and noticed that a phone number was printed on the box directly in case of any problems. Carson groaned and called the number while also looking at the order number listed on the shipping label.<br />
<br />
The girl on the other end of the line answered with a cheerful voice, &quot;Thank you for calling C.C. Helios. This is Angela speaking. How may I help you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi Angela,&quot; Carson said, trying to keep his irritation out of his voice. &quot;I&#39;m calling in regards to Order #0093744024781-H, which was just delivered.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh huh,&quot; Angela replied, following what he was saying.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not the one who placed the order, and I just want to make sure the items I just got were what was ordered,&quot; Carson explained.<br />
<br />
&quot;I see,&quot; Angela said. &quot;Can you repeat the order number for me?&quot; Carson did. &quot;Okey dokie, it says here that the order was for three boxes of body soap. Is that what you received?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I suppose it <i>is</i> body soap,&quot; Carson reasoned. &quot;But can you tell me what brand it should be?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, let me see here,&quot; Angela murmured. &quot;Ah ha!&quot; The brand should be Perfect Lance Body Wash. I believe that&#39;s an athletic brand of soap.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, that is not what I am staring at.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh no, that&#39;s not good. What brand do you have?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Perfect Lay Body Wash. It appears to be a kind of soap typically intended for romantic evenings or something.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow. Okay then. That&#39;s quite a difference. I apologize about that, Mister...?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My name is Carson. Is there a way that we could ship these bottles back to you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If I literally worked anywhere else, my answer would be yes. But the thing is, Carson, it&#39;s company policy that we can&#39;t take back any items we&#39;ve shipped. Liability concerns and all that jazz.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But, what we can do is, should you choose, we can send out for a team to pick up those soap bottles for safe disposal. We would then send you the correct soap bottles once we hear back from out pickup team that they have received the incorrect ones.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That sounds reasonable. Let&#39;s do that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okey dokie. Give me one second while I pull up our pickup team&#39;s schedule.&quot; There was a slight pause. &quot;I&#39;m really sorry, Carson. But it appears our pickup team will not be available at all today. And the system doesn&#39;t let me make requests for different days. Tell you what. How about you or whoever placed the order calls in first thing tomorrow morning, and I can send our pickup team before they get swamped.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, if that&#39;s the only option, that&#39;s fine I guess. I mean it is just soap.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, sorry about that, Carson. Is there anything else I can help you with?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, I think that about covers it. Thanks, Angela.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re welcome, Carson. Thank you for calling in, and I&#39;ll keep an eye out for your call tomorrow if you decide not to keep the soap. Have a good day!&quot; Angela hung up the phone as did Carson. He stared at the boxes of pink soap bottles. Maybe he could explain to Coach Hendricks and not waste his time filling up the soap dispensers with this stuff. He suddenly heard four loud and long tweets of the Hendricks&#39;s whistle. That usually meant he was not happy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Screw it,&quot; Carson grumbled. &quot;It&#39;s just soap. I&#39;ll just fill up the dispensers with it. I&#39;m just doing what I&#39;m told.&quot; Plus, he could always get the correct bottles of soap tomorrow without Coach Hendricks knowing. He grabbed a box and walked into the shower area. There were two main cubicles of shower heads, each with ten pairs of soap dispensers. The one on top was for shampoo, and the other was for body soap. Carson opened one of the bottles and took an experimental whiff. The soap smelled nice and had a hint of a flowery scent. But the scent wasn&#39;t overpowering. Maybe the guys won&#39;t even notice that it had a scent. Maybe there won&#39;t be a need to get the bottles replaced after all.<br />
<br />
In any case, Carson got to work. He started filling up the body soap dispensers, which all have been bone-dry for the past three months. Not the shampoo dispensers, just the body soap for whatever reason. This would be a nice surprise since the team wouldn&#39;t have to keep using their own soap after practice. Plus, none of them would have a reason to leave without showering. Carson found that thought to be a little odd but shrugged it off. The soap itself was completely opaque and solid white color. Occasionally, Carson thought he saw a streak of red or pink in the soap, but when he blinked, it was gone. Each dispenser could hold one and a half of the bottles. Maybe it was a good thing that Coach Hendricks bought so much extra. After a little over halfway with one cubicle, Carson had cleared almost half of the box.<br />
<br />
He opened up another bottle and accidentally squirted some on his shirt. He grunted irritably and pulled the shirt off. He set it back by the lockers before resuming. He then accidentally got some on his pants as he finished up the first shower cubicle. Shaking his head, Carson went back to the lockers to take off his pants. He took off his socks and shoes for good measure as well. All he had on when he returned to the shower cubicles was his boxers. He failed to notice that his cock was a little hard at the moment. The thought of simply wiping off his shirt and pants had not occurred to him.<br />
<br />
When he went to retrieve the second box, Carson remembered that Coach Hendricks had a personal shower in his office. Maybe he should get some of the new soap too. Carson opened the second box and grabbed the next bottle when he accidentally squeezed a good amount right on his crotch. Carson could feel the coolness of the soap through his boxers.<br />
<br />
&quot;Practice isn&#39;t over for another thirty minutes,&quot; he reasoned. &quot;I can take these off while I finish up. It&#39;s more important that the guys can shower with this soap anyway.&quot; He found that reasoning to be a little odd and figured that he meant that since Coach Hendricks had ordered him to do so before practice was over. He stripped off his boxers and set them down out with the rest of his clothes. Now completely naked, he walked through Coach Hendrick&#39;s office and to the personal bathroom and shower. Sure enough, there was an empty body soap dispenser next to the shower. Carson dutifully filled the dispenser up completely with the new soap. When he was done, he walked back to the shower cubicle and continued filling those soap dispensers. His cock, now fully hard, bobbed out in front of him as he walked.<br />
<br />
Carson was done with the dispensers sooner than he had expected, but the bottle in his hand had some soap still leftover. He looked at the bottle for a while, not moving from his spot. Without taking his eyes off of the soap bottle, he turned the nozzle on the closest shower-head. Warm water starting pouring down on him. He turned the bottle over and squeezed some out into his hand. He stared at the soap and inhaled its scent, which somehow seemed stronger now.<br />
<br />
Carson then gave into the urge that had been growing since he first took off his shirt. He began rubbing the soap on his chest. He squeezed more onto his body. He dropped the bottle and tried to get the soap all over him. He massaged it into his firm pecs and slight two-pack. He kneaded his ass cheeks with the soap, even unconsciously slipping a finger with soap along his crack. He used the soap like a lube and began pumping his hard dick with slow movements. He rubbed the soap into his toes, between his fingers, up and down his arms and legs, and all across his face. He even ran the soap through his hair. Carson didn&#39;t care. All he cared about was getting the soap evenly coated over his whole body. He then stopped moving, allowing gravity and the water pressure to rinse his body off. He closed his eyes and breathed the warm scent again. He smiled. When he opened his eyes, he was a little disappointed to see that the soap had gone. But somewhere in his mind, he felt like the soap had done its job.<br />
<br />
Carson shut off the water, grabbed a towel from the pile, and dried off his naked body. He felt so much cleaner than any other shower he had taken. He felt like something was radiating off of him, and it felt incredible. He begrudgingly pulled his clothes back on. He grabbed the final box of the Perfect Lay Body Wash soap and placed it inside the storage closet, but keeping one bottle to take home for himself. He closed his eyes and breathed deeply. He couldn&#39;t smell the soap anymore, and the fog from his mind seemed to drift away.</p>
