<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>two very different branching options, I might write both?</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You woke up at around the same time as your disconnected body, feeling the sheets move as it stretched next to you. It was mid-morning judging by the light, and coming properly awake, you blinked and then watched as it sat up. <br />
<br />
It was weird to think that your head and your body had slept independently, as if you were both two distinct living creatures. You guessed that it was true, in a way.<br />
<br />
Temporarily, you told yourself. Definitely temporary.<br />
<br />
Reaching a foot-hand up, your dick-headed body gave the fat semi-hard shaft a light rub, like it was wiping away sleep dust from its eyes. The dick plumped up a little from the touch, partially rising into the air. Now seeming to be fully awake, the body felt around the edge of the bed for the sword, which was leaning on the nightstand.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey! I hope you remembered what you said!&quot; You called out.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, it wasn&#39;t able to hear you without ears, but you soon realised that it had something else in mind. Grasping for you, the dick-headed body picked your head up. Feeling around your facial features, it brought the sword close and with a surprising amount of dexterity for having feet-hands, it carefully sliced out your right eye. It was a bit freaky, your instincts to dodge out of the way of a blade aimed at your face, but you reminded yourself it couldn&#39;t actually hurt you.<br />
<br />
Bringing the borrowed eye up, the dick-headed body attached it to its own chest, just under the collar bone.<br />
<br />
It opened and closed rapidly a few times, then darted around, adjusting to having vision. Now able to see, your body continued what it was doing with more precision. Cleaving off your right ear, with no better location, it transplanted it to the right of the eye on its chest. You were about to ask it what was going on, since it could then hear you, but the window of opportunity quickly vanished. You felt the blade deftly cut under your lips, removing your mouth entirely, before moving it across to place on the chest too, just beneath the eye and ear.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, that&#39;s better. Being able to see and hear and talk is great.&quot; The mouth smiled, the eye glancing down at you, your body holding you in its lap, and you stared back in amazement at the makeshift face it had given itself. You wondered why it hadn&#39;t just inserted the dick into your neck again and taken your head, but your body seemed to anticipate the thought and read your mind.<br />
<br />
&quot;Having a head is cool, but I figured it would be fairer to you to split the senses. Well, except for speech. Only one mouth you know, so I should probably have it.&quot; The dick-headed body shrugged and grinned. &quot;Okay, now I know I said you&#39;d be back in control today, but I had too much fun yesterday. So, just one more day. By tonight, I promise you&#39;ll have what&#39;s yours. Besides, this isn&#39;t so bad. You get to stay free, and I don&#39;t have to be erect all the time. It&#39;s a win-win.&quot; It chuckles. &quot;Though being hard is kinda my thing. Expert, I think.&quot;<br />
<br />
You continued to stare in disbelief, your left eye glaring. One more day?! You weren&#39;t sure this was any better than being along for the ride, but at least you still had your own head.<br />
<br />
&quot;Speaking of erections, I should thank you for last night. That was a really good time.&quot; Reaching up in a reflex, your body gave its shaft another quick rub, and your attention was drawn to the dick above, sitting on what used to be your shoulders. Seeing your body without a normal human head -- your head -- was jarring, but you knew by now what you&#39;d gotten yourself into, so there was no reason in stressing about it more. The shaft thickened again, lengthening slightly, and it was then you thought you noticed something odd.<br />
<br />
It seemed like it was a little ... larger ... than before? Your balls too, seemed to be a bit bigger, a little heavier.<br />
<br />
Maybe you were imagining it, but ...<br />
<br />
&quot;Anyhow, I want to eat.&quot; Monologue done, your body made use of the sword, briefly removing the female feet and then reattaching your original hands. &quot;Easier to cook this way,&quot; it smiled, flexing your fingers. &quot;Hmm, this is neat.&quot;<br />
<br />
Taking you to the kitchen, it sat your head on the bench, and you watched as your dick-headed body fumbled around as it learned how to cook an early lunch. A few minutes later it had successfully made a fried meal. Bacon, eggs, hash browns. It ate the whole plate, mumbling in fascination at the flavours the whole time. Though the food looked pretty good to you, you didn&#39;t feel hungry yourself. The sword&#39;s magic also somehow made it possible for your body to swallow and digest the food with a reconfigured mouth. You thought it must be the same way you had a functioning vagina on your neck, or that your body had a dick instead of a head and was still walking around like normal.<br />
<br />
&quot;That was amazing!&quot; Your body said. It put the dishes in the sink and then found the sword. Slicing off the hands again, it reattached the female feet to the arm stumps. &quot;More fun with these. Now I want to relax.&quot;<br />
<br />
Picking you up again, it took you to the bathroom and placed you on the counter. Running itself a bubble bath, the dick-headed body stripped off and climbed in. It sighed, settling down to enjoy the warmth, and began to slowly wash itself. Using its feet-hands, your body covered itself in liquid soap and bubbles, and lathered all over. The dick sitting between your shoulders began to lazily swell where it lay, liking the attention.<br />
<br />
Again, you noticed it had changed. It was now even larger than earlier. Everything was still in proportion, balls included, but scaled up. It looked maybe twice the thickness, like a salami, and twice the length, close to a foot.<br />
<br />
Was it growing? There had to be a reason for it, you told yourself.<br />
<br />
Something was going on here.<br />
<br />
The feet-hands were done cleaning and moved up to massage the shaft directly. It began to rise from where it was draped over the left shoulder, becoming stiffer and stiffer until it was pointing straight up. You could confirm your suspicion, the obviously erect dick-head matching your earlier estimate of thickness and length.<br />
<br />
Definitely bigger.<br />
<br />
Moaning, your body kneaded and squeezed itself. You watched as your dick masturbated its head until climax, and twitching and jerking, shot several jets of cum that splashed down on its chest and in the water. Your body then rinsed itself off and breathed out in contentment.<br />
<br />
&quot;That was great! Baths and showers are so enjoyable. They make me want to fuck.&quot; Climbing out, your body dried itself and then dressed again.<br />
<br />
It picked your head up and together you went to the lounge, to sit on the couch. Not having much imagination, your dick-headed body just decided to laze around for a while and watch TV. Growing bored, your anxiety at the whole situation faded as you dozed off for a while, stuck motionless and voiceless while your autonomous body sampled the range of your cable selection.<br />
<br />
Waking a fair bit later -- later afternoon, early evening you guessed, by the light -- you blinked your single eye, and glanced up at the body next to you, to see what it was doing.<br />
<br />
The first thing you noticed was that your dick was MUCH larger than earlier, and the difference was now clearly visible without any closer inspection. Even from your lower angle, you could tell, though it was hard to know exactly the amount. It looked like the dick was maybe six inches wide at the base where it connected to your neck stump. Hanging flaccid across the right shoulder, it was about a foot and a half long. Similarly, two testicles, the size of large oranges, sat just above the collar bone in a soft, smooth, sac.<br />
<br />
Undoubtedly, the change was something magical to do with the sword, but what ... and why?<br />
<br />
&quot;Awake again?&quot; Your body chuckled. Seemed like it hadn&#39;t noticed the increased size or didn&#39;t care too much about it, despite how obvious it was to you. &quot;It&#39;s late enough in the afternoon. I think it&#39;s time, since you&#39;ve been a good sport.&quot; Retrieving the sword, your dick-headed body sat next to you and looked down. You began to get excited.<br />
<br />
Was this it, your ticket back to normality?<br />
<br />
It lifted you up briefly and sliced the vagina off, then placing it next to the female legs. &quot;I&#39;ll just get this out of the way, but I&#39;ll leave the other things where they are, you can do whatever you want afterwards. Thanks for the memories, it&#39;s been a blast. You ready?&quot;<br />
<br />
You rocked your head up and down, your best attempt at a nod.<br />
<br />
You could hardly believe it. You were about to escape out of this humiliating ordeal, after a day&#39;s worth of fear and worrying. You couldn&#39;t wait to return to how things were.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, here goes.&quot;<br />
<br />
Your body reached up and sliced the overgrown dick and balls off, causing them to fall off the side and onto the couch with a gentle thud. Eagerly you concentrated, ready to resume and start fixing yourself, but ...<br />
<br />
Nothing happened.<br />
<br />
The dick wiggled around, kinda like a beached fish, and your body spoke again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow!&quot; It said. &quot;I can still feel everything! I&#39;m still in control! Guess I bonded with my body more than I thought.&quot;<br />
<br />
The words &#39;my body&#39; filled you with more horror than you thought possible, the sense of assumed ownership making you queasy ... but ... like a flash of lightning, the realisation hit you, and it all came together at once!<br />
<br />
This ... this was meant to be YOUR body, but ...<br />
<br />
You realised that the magic at work had &#39;officially&#39; paired your dick with your body.<br />
<br />
They had &#39;bonded&#39; together! As far as the sword was concerned, the dick-headed body was the &#39;real&#39; you, and your dick was your &#39;real&#39; head. It had even been slowly enlarging your dick to be a closer match to a regular human neck and head, giving it a greater girth and mass than otherwise.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well,&quot; your body said, &quot;in this case I think I should ... &quot;</p>
