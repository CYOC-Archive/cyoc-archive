<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was early in the morning and Joseph had gone out for an early morning jog to get to a popular donut place in hopes that if he got there at 5:30 in the morning that he&#39;d only have to wait till 6 when the place actually opened. Sadly thanks to tourists and everyone else he&#39;d be gone till around 6:30 giving Jamie a decent enough window of time to grab Jess out of bed. The little tween not being able to consciously understand why she was being woken up so early, but the little Jeff dancing in her mind had some sort of twinge of hope that it could be what he thought it was. <br />
<br />
Jamie took out her laptop that housed the chronivac program and opened it. Jamie said &quot;So Jess, do you think it was an accident that you were born to beautiful well off parents? Cause it really wasn&#39;t. A simple computer program was able to alter my fate and give me all this. Including you in an odd way.&quot; <br />
Jess concerned said &quot;Mom... your acting weird...&quot; <br />
Jamie hit herself on the forehead jokingly and said &quot;Right Jeff, I hadn&#39;t actually give you your awareness back. One small click an-&quot; <br />
&quot;Mom please ex-&quot; Jess held her head as the rest of Jeff&#39;s memories and personality flooded into Jess. It was a little hard to handle. <br />
&quot;There there, now Jeff you must see that in your life as Jess tha-&quot; Was about as far as Jamie got before her little girl started grunting and struggling with herself on the ground. <br />
<br />
&quot;Gah, So your the one whose! And you! RUINING MY LIFE!!!&quot; the little girl was clutching her head as two people&#39;s worth of memories and personalities were fighting each other. Jeff angry at both Jamie for essentially ending his life and Jess for both stealing his life and making the bit of him that was still existing extremely frustrating. Jess on the other hand was really angry at Jeff for making her life incredibly harder. She wanted to love daddy, but because of Jeff&#39;s influence her heart really couldn&#39;t love Joseph the way it should&#39;ve. She was a big tomboy at the start, but the biggest part of Jess knew she loved magical girls from Spectacle. Sure those magical girls were a bit boyish in ways, but you couldn&#39;t deny the femininity they had as well. The way their skirts and dresses fluttered, their hobbies, their mannerisms... all of which the little niggling of Jeff in her head made it impossible for her to truly act like the girl she wanted to be. Always put on the shorts and pants not the skirts and dresses, never the pink stuff, and oh that childhood crush? Besides those things she also acted odd because of Jeff and ended up not being able to really start or maintain most friendships. I mean she probably could&#39;ve had friendships with guys but Jess herself wasn&#39;t that interested in them most of the time... Besides Charlie, but with Jeff yanking down on the crush part that wasn&#39;t going anywhere. Really being turned to 100% aware showed Jess how much her life had been screwed up thanks to the chronivac, Jamie, and Jeff. She couldn&#39;t bring herself to hate mommy, but the new chronivac and Jeff was something she could easily pin the blame on.<br />
<br />
Jamie had taken a look on the chronivac forums and while her specific unbirth into birthing another individual, but some other users had found out that after having someone unaware transformed for an extended period of time... Making them aware had the possibility of giving the person a split personality. There were two ways of fixing this... Either making them unaware again or use an &quot;defusion&quot; transformation package someone developed for just this situation. It was a little cumbersome, but Jamie activated it, selected Jess/Jeff&#39;s profile and a few clicks later the little girl got a rather splitting headache as Jeff&#39;s personality and memories were being ripped out of her mind as they were transferred to a a 16 year old guy&#39;s body who was materializing a few feet away. <br />
<br />
Jamie sighed and asked &quot;So kids, how about w-&quot; <br />
&quot;What the fuck mom!?! You trapped me in the brats body for these years and all that?!?&quot; Jeff complained<br />
&quot;Trapped in my body?!? Your little tugs and pulls was ruining my life! So much feeling off because of you I had even considered... I want a redo!&quot; Jess yelled. <br />
Jamie looked at the chronivac and said &quot;That is something I think we could potentially do... How about we rewind us all about eight years? Jess would be able to redo the majority of her young childhood and Jeff could easily find his place in our family.&quot; <br />
Jeff yelled &quot;Do you think that matters?!? You got rid of me entirely and... It&#39;s like you don&#39;t even care about Dad anymore!&quot; <br />
Jamie said &quot;I will take the blame for all that. With the way the Chronivac gave information I thought you and Jess were literally the same, and the unbirth was because when I was dating I thought having a child already could be a turn off to many. However I don&#39;t think Joseph is that sort of man. I ask you at least give what I&#39;m asking a try. If not for my sake then for the sake of your half-sister here who would cease to exist if I just tried to revert everything.&quot; Jamie saying nothing of Jack as... Well as much as she cherished her time with Jack. Her 12ish years with Joseph had very softened her original love of Jack. <br />
Jeff grumbled and snapped &quot;Fine! But we&#39;re both going to be aware and we can have some access to the chronivac as well! It was originally mine after all!&quot; <br />
Jess said &quot;...Can we just get this over with... I&#39;d like to try to reclaim what I had lost.&quot; <br />
Jamie started typing in the changes and then noticed something and said &quot;I&#39;m going to be regressing the two of your knowledge. Not of what is going on, but so Jess isn&#39;t a 3 year old with a lot of math, history, etc. and similarly the same with Jeff. We&#39;d rather have a somewhat normal life right?&quot; Jeff and Jess looked a little uneasy, but Jess having seen know it alls not being that popular nodded. <br />
<br />
Joseph came back home with a bakers dozen worth of artisan donuts with enough sugar to keep the kids energetic for the whole day... and the next day... probably safe to say the entire week. He smiled as he saw his beautiful wife, adorable three year old daughter, and 8 year old stepson... He hated that he couldn&#39;t get closer to Jeff, but he was away on work for awhile and Jeff had really loved his father and probably saw him as some Replacement for something irreplaceable. Worse he may have seen his half-sister as some annoying addition to his life as well. After all the majority of her life she was crying, screaming, or sleeping in some form. <br />
Jess ran up to her daddy as fast as she could yelling &quot;Daddy Daddy Daddy!!!&quot; and seeing the donut box said &quot;OOO!!! I Want One I Want One!&quot; The 11 year old in Jess kinda knew she was being a little overenthusiastic about the sugar, but she was actually able to show her love without restraint... Now which flavor to... Wait what flavor did she like the best again?... Before today in altered reality they rarely gave Jess a lot of sugar much less a whole donut from the specialty store. It was a multi-colored treasure box of deliciousness that she&#39;d have to randomly pick from and it was exciting to the little girl who decided to pick the pink donut with red sprinkles. A sugar bow on top that kind of looked like the ribbons Red 6 used in the magical girl program she liked. Jeff got a donut himself once the box had been set down.<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry, he&#39;ll get used to you and Jess eventually.&quot; Jamie said<br />
Joseph said &quot;Jess for sure maybe... in a tolerant way depending on if he just sees her as annoying. Me though... I&#39;m not sure if he&#39;ll ever really accept me.&quot;</p>
