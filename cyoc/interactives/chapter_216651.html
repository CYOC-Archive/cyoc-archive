<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Thanks to Zak, today has actually been enjoyable. At least the latter half of it, avoiding that Naga and Centaur was pretty stressful. But just walking with this beastman and having a nice chat, it&#39;s been good. But it makes you wonder one thing, something that you have to verbalize.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, Zak.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why&#39;re you helping me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Cause I want to. You worried I&#39;ll make you look better by adding fangs and fur?&quot;<br />
<br />
The hyena offers a wink and smile as he says that. Zak as relaxed as ever with that answer, and yeah, you are a little worried. Why would a monster not convert you? It&#39;s an instinct with them, a drive to spread and make more of their kind. But Zak seems so comfortable with the current dynamic.  There still has to be a reason, maybe if you ask a bit more...<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I&#39;m worried. Let&#39;s be real, you want to make me into a beastman.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course I do.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then... why aren&#39;t you? I was so vulnerable there, you could&#39;ve easily done it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wasn&#39;t a good time for it. You want me to get caught by that village? They&#39;re not limited to only making humans into centaurs. I&#39;d have been top half hyena, bottom horse if I stuck around.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But you reversed their magic, you didn&#39;t have to make me stronger or get rid of that spirit.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course I did. You think I want to talk to someone that&#39;s possessed or just begging me to fuck them? Where&#39;s the fun in that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then why not now?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m a thief, not a fighter. Yeah, my muscles are bigger than yours, but you&#39;d know how to throw a punch better than I do.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then why not lure me into a trap? Or just take me to your village, to other beastman or something.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Because I can&#39;t.&quot;<br />
<br />
His abrupt answer is followed by him shuffling to your side. Putting a hand on your shoulder, and giving a gentle squeeze.<br />
<br />
&quot;Probably won&#39;t help relax you, but I mean it when I said I don&#39;t want you turning right now. I like travelling with you.&quot;<br />
<br />
He grins, you looking into the sharp teeth of this beast once more. Feeling comforted by those words, as you have finally worked out this man’s intentions. He doesn&#39;t have anyone else, and if he scares you off, it&#39;s back to being alone. Zak returning to his own place near the fire. Rolling onto his back and closing his eyes, though not before giving you one last look and wink.<br />
<br />
&quot;Night, friend. I better be in your dreams tonight after all I&#39;ve done.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Heh, night.&quot;<br />
<br />
You don&#39;t dream that night, or at least don&#39;t remember it. The day’s events having tired you out completely as you snooze, and wake to the faux sky shining brightly. The fire long extinguished, Zak awake and snacking on an apple. Watching you the entire time, sharp eyes noticing that you&#39;re up, and a devious look returning to the beastman.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dream of me last night?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe, not telling you though.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Glad to hear I left an impact, hard not to though.&quot;<br />
<br />
He tosses you an apple, which you eat and then prepare to leave. Once more on the road with Zak, who you&#39;re really starting to consider a friend. He&#39;s a reliable guide, keeping you out of the path of monsters, and serenading you with stories of his robberies. From picking pockets of sleeping goblins, to scavenging the aftermath of a centaur raid, to sneaking into fortresses and grabbing anything that isn&#39;t nailed down. Most of it is exaggerated, but Zak is good at making it seem otherwise. Adding that dramatic flair to his tales, and always coming out on top.<br />
<br />
Zak starts to slow down as you begin to walk up a small hill. The trees here being cut, leaving you with a good look of the barren area. There&#39;s no one, and nothing around either. Though if there was, you&#39;d be so easy to spot. Why is Zak taking you here?<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey buddy, mind if we take a quick stop?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, why?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There&#39;s an orc tribe nearby, they&#39;ll be out right now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You want to steal from them?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yep! Best time of day to do it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Considering how nonchalant he is, this is probably one of his regular targets. Zak already changing your direction, veering slightly to the east as you continue to scale this hill. An extinguished fire seen in a stone pit. Six large tents pitched, the excellent make of their fabrics leading you to believe they probably came from the surface. There are weapons near the exits of each of them, swords and axes, far too big for you to wield. As you get closer, Zak pats you on the back.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll take the right three, you take the left.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;C&#39;mon, a little bit of thieving never hurt anyone.&quot;<br />
<br />
He disappears into the nearest tent, and you&#39;re forced to follow along. Taking instruction as you go to the left three, moving aside the flap and getting hit with the stink of orc. It&#39;s a powerful musk that&#39;s been absorbed by the tent, and given the bits of discoloration on the messy bedroll, you can imagine what&#39;s causing it. Though apart from the bedroll, there&#39;s also a small silver box which you quickly open. Seeing gold coins and red jewels inside, now this is what you&#39;re really after.<br />
<br />
You can&#39;t help but have a toothy grin on your face. There&#39;s some odd thrill in this, taking what someone else has. The entire box stolen by you, held in one hand as you scour the rest of the tent but find nothing. Moving over to the second which stinks just as bad as the first. In fact the smell is a bit stronger. As your nose turns to a black dot, you sniff the air to confirm your suspicion. Yep, this one is worse. But it won&#39;t stop a thief like you. Your sharper eyes seeing several crates towards the back of this tent. Boxes and barrels that you dig through, your nails hardening to claws to better help you find what you seek. Fur covering the upper part of your hand, skin becoming tougher to protect against any splinters. <br />
<br />
Though as much as you search, there&#39;s nothing in this one. Just food and drink, could those orcs not raid a bit better? You can&#39;t help but feel disappointed at this poor showing of loot, maybe that last one will be a hit. As your tail starts to form, you get out of this tent and into the last one. It stinks, and is basically empty, great. But on top of the bedroll is at least a few coins. Your dextrous and athletic body lowering as you gather up your prize, and store them in the silver box that you took earlier. You letting out an animalistic cackle as you&#39;re proud of your work, pretty average plunder, but for an easy job it&#39;s a fine haul. You leave the last tent, Zak having just finished with his three.<br />
<br />
&quot;Everything went fine?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You have to ask? Of course it did!&quot;<br />
<br />
You flash Zak a toothy, confident grin. Knowing that it&#39;ll impress that hyena, and impress it does. His eyes going wide as he looks at you, your hands now claws, fur reaching up to your elbow. Orange mixed with spots of black. Your face having stretched into a muzzle, overtaken by fur completely, with ears now points at the top of your head. Matching that animalistic visage of a hyena beastman. Your chest a bit more muscled, but still kept nice and lithe for a run, can&#39;t steal if you&#39;re too big after all. With your tail complementing the start of your changes, swaying behind you, showing your excitement and pride.<br />
<br />
&quot;N-nice man! But uh, you looked at yourself recently?&quot;<br />
<br />
What does he mean by that? You only now realize that something is wrong, that you shouldn&#39;t have claws or fangs. That you shouldn&#39;t feel so proud of common theft. Your new friend hands you a recently stolen mirror, which you quickly bring closer so you can see just what is happening. It&#39;s hard to look at yourself thanks to the dirty glass, but even with that difficulty, you immediately see what is the problem. Your face, it&#39;s the exact same as Zaks, you&#39;re the spitting image of him. Your claws, your build, it&#39;s the same as well. Though you haven&#39;t completely become his clone, your chest and legs are still human, as is the upper half of your arms. Your eyes narrow as you look to the man you are turning into. This must have been a trap.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;d you do?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nothing! I swear, I didn&#39;t do anything!&quot;<br />
<br />
He drops all of the gold he had gathered, wincing as he hears the coins clutter to the ground, and rushing over to your side.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can fix it, there&#39;ll be a way to. Just come with me and I&#39;ll fix it I promise!&quot;</p>
