<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Lucile had never thought she&#39;d ever reply to any of those mails that had spammed <br />
her mail account for so long. Those mails were most vile and disgusting, promising <br />
a lot and undoubtly giving only a little if anything in return. Or so she thought! <br />
At least this was an offer she did not have to spend any money on. &quot;What harm is <br />
there in trying?&quot; she thought. <br />
<br />
Surprised about herself and &quot;only to give it a try&quot;, as she repeatedly assured herself, <br />
she gave in to the offer of that company offering penis enlargement pills for a <br />
study. &quot;They don&#39;t ask for any details like credit-cards and only ask for detailed <br />
anonymized information as to the results of the medicine! There is no harm in <br />
trying it out is there?&quot; The product was to arive at the end of the week and Lucille <br />
did not really know what to expect. <br />
<br />
On Friday there was a small package brought by the postman. Lucille did not know <br />
whether she was relieved or disappointed when she was handed a rather unobtrusive<br />
little package, wrapped in brown paper with only her address on it and an anonymous <br />
P.O. box as sender. &quot;It could have been anything, the postman would not know. Maybe <br />
if it was pink or with some half-nude ladies on it or ...&quot; After all Lucille was relieved. <br />
If anything the packaging assured her, that it had to be sent from a serious institution <br />
and no shady, backstreet company selling dried tiger-penis in vinegar as potency <br />
remedy. <br />
<br />
&quot;Mom? Are you downstairs?&quot; Raul shouted down. &quot;Yes, honey. Im just fetching the <br />
mail!&quot; Lucille replied. &quot;I was waiting for my comics to arrive, are they&#39;re there yet?&quot; <br />
her son was asking, while coming down the stairs. &quot;No, sweety. Im sorry! Nothing <br />
for you today. They must be delayed again!&quot; ... disappointed her little boy turned on <br />
his heels and trudged back to his room. Lucille closed the front door, checked the <br />
rest of the mail - adverts, adverts, bill, advert, bill, invitation for some church event ... <br />
&quot;Well, that can wait!&quot; Lucille thought, grabbed the little brown package and went to <br />
the kitchen. <br />
<br />
She opened up a drawer, took out a kitchen knife and sliced open the wrapping, <br />
put it into the recycle bin, put pack the knife and sat down at the kitchen table, <br />
to take a closer look at what she had received. There was a little white carton box, <br />
with only a small number written on top of it, accompanied by a plain letter for <br />
instruction. <br />
<br />
&quot;Dear Mrs. L., <br />
we are very pleased and grateful that you are willing to participate in testing our new <br />
product. Our product aims at men of all ages suffering either erectile disfunctions or <br />
low sexual desire that might either occurr due to growing age, often starting as early <br />
as at the age of 45 or due to stress or psychological issues. <br />
Since we are aware of that men often find it difficult to address these kind of issues, <br />
we were especially adressing women who are naturally also highly affected by the <br />
lack of sexual desire or ability of their partners asking for their assistance in this <br />
study. <br />
The enclosed product has undergone a thorow testing in our laboratories and is <br />
considered safe for human use. The medication is delivered pulverized in 50 sachets, <br />
each of them containing the daily portion for an adult man of average size. You might <br />
find the effect to be slightly stronger in men of small build and considerably lower <br />
in men of higher body weight. Our current test-runs have been very promising as to <br />
the sexual focus of the test subjects as well as extend of erection and the endurance in <br />
sexual intercourse. Side effects might lie in a considerable prolongation of erection as <br />
well as exessive lubrication pre- and post-erectile. We are most interested in the <br />
frequency of those effects in relation to the built of the subject and the relation to the <br />
amount of medicine taken. <br />
The medication is odourless and neutral in taste and can easily be added to meal or <br />
dessert, als well as being dissolved in any beverage without having any effect on its <br />
taste. We would prefer if the test subject had no bearings of knowing about taking <br />
the medication as we hope to minimize possible placebo effect. <br />
Please administer one sachet per day either in one portion or to be delivered over <br />
tha course of the day. We have set up an account for your use on our online-portal, <br />
where we would like you to take notes of your observations. There is no need for <br />
constant administration of the product on a daily basis. The product administered <br />
twice or thrice a week should have a strong effect on the very day of taking, but <br />
still a recognizable effect on days it had not been taken. Please note your observations <br />
clearly for days of administering the product and on days it had not been taken. <br />
Thank you very much for your cooperation! <br />
Sincerely, xxx&quot;<br />
<br />
Lucile put down the letter, opened up the box and there it was: lots of small <br />
paper-sachets, all of them white exept for a serial number written on each of <br />
them. Lucile decided to keep them safe in her medication box. She took ten <br />
sachets and stuffed them into a box of aspirin and put the rest for safety on <br />
top of the kitchen cabinet. <br />
<br />
She took one sachet and looked at it. &quot;So this is for one day?&quot; shewhispered <br />
to herself. Hear heart was beating and her head felt funny. Was it the excitement? <br />
One portion was meant for an adult men with erectile disfuncions. What kind <br />
of an effect would it have on her 12-year old little boy? Observing him every <br />
night with her camera had made it very clear that he had no disfunction <br />
whatsoever. <br />
<br />
Lucille opened up the sachet and sniffed at it. There was no smell to it! <br />
It looked a bit like sugar, but it was much finer in texture. A bit like milk-<br />
powder maybe. Lucille opened up the kitchen door &quot;Raul?!&quot; ... <br />
&quot;Yes mon?!&quot; he replied from out of his room. &quot;Would you like some orange-<br />
juice?&quot; &quot;Yeah, thanks!&quot; came the prompt reply!  Lucile smiled, turned to <br />
the drawer, took out a glasse and mixed the content of half a sachet with <br />
some orange-juice she had taken from the fridge. &quot;Half a portion should do!&quot; <br />
she thought. &quot;Lets start slowly!&quot; <br />
<br />
With that she walked up the stairs, knocked at the door of Raul&#39;s room <br />
and brought him his glass of orange juice like a good mother would.</p>
