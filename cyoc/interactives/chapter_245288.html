<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Bianca&#39;s stuff arrived over the next week, week and a half. Not knowing what to do with it, Richard waited until everything had shown up before using the Chronivac to become Bianca long enough to sort through it all, determine it all fit and was as ordered, wash the clothes, then put it away. Afterward, going back to his male form, Richard began to consider what he might do as Bianca, and what he hoped to gain.<br />
<br />
The biggest thing he hoped to get out it was a better understanding of how to approach people, make a connection. Believing this might be easier to do as a woman, though not looking forward to becoming one, let alone going out as one, he started to procrastinate. Find he had the time to do so, he’d make excuses, with most based on how he felt as if he wasn&#39;t ready, that there still felt as if he&#39;d forgotten something. And if it wasn&#39;t this, he&#39;d on purposefully shift his schedule so he&#39;d have work to take home, or there&#39;d be something else to keep him become Bianca.<br />
<br />
Weeks slipped by, and still Richard wouldn’t use the software again. Sitting outside his usual place to eat lunch one day, picking at what he&#39;d ordered, he again watched people across the street as they greeted each other, lovers embraced, and friends joked amongst themselves. Observing all the different things the various people engaged in, longing to have what they had, he soon grew angry with himself. Taking a bite of his food, he thought to himself, &quot;You have a way, but you don&#39;t use it. Well, here’s the thing. Use it, or don&#39;t. But stop shilly-shallying.&quot;<br />
<br />
Goaded by these words, he resolved to either use the Chronivac to become Bianca or he&#39;d find another way to deal with his loneliness. Turning his full attention to his lunch, then, after he&#39;d finished, the rest of the work day, Richard arrived back at his apartment at his usual time. An idea for the evening ahead already in mind, he sat down in front of his laptop. Running the thing through its usual start-up process, he pulled up the Chronivac, stared at Bianca&#39;s profile, and again hesitated as he tried to figure out what he&#39;d forgotten. Seeing he was about to do what he&#39;d done every single time, he gritted his teeth, hissed, &quot;No,&quot; and standing, thinking what he was about to do was surely bonkers level crazy, he reached out and tapped the icon to initiate the change.<br />
<br />
It happening like it did every other time, Richard dealt with the sudden sexual arousal the same way. Shucking off his clothes as he headed for the bathroom, working his meat as he did, even as it, his nuts, and sack morphed in the female exterior genitals, he managed to get into the shower before he cumed. His now feminine folds and sensitive thighs slick, he, now she, still continued to diddle herself now as her body developed secondary female characteristics. Waist pinching, hips, butt, and thighs getting more pronounced, chest pushing outward into a B cup, height and weight dropping, face looking more and more feminine, she orgasmed a few more times before the transformation was complete and the person standing in the shower was now a woman of twenty. Feeling the sexual arousal slowly leave her, Bianca sighed in contentment, leaned against the wall a moment before reaching for the knob to turn on the spigot. And after stepping out to collect several things, she took her time having herself a shower.<br />
<br />
Showered, smelling strongly of feminine products, she headed for the bedroom. There, she selected a strapless maxi dress which was a cream-white colour with a blue floral print, a pair of low-rise bikini briefs, and a cute pair of sandals to compliment the outfit. Dressing, she did her hair up, and purse in hand, she took a final look at herself in the mirror before heading out the door. Her first stop a place to eat, Bianca at first was nervous. Knowing she wasn&#39;t really a woman, but had become one due to a computer software, she soon relaxed as she discovered she enjoyed quite a bit of the attention she got, as well as learned, unlike Richard, she could talk to people with more ease. Daring at one point to use the woman&#39;s lavatory, sure this was pushing it, she relieved when the one or two other occupants acted like she was just another woman there to pee, she considered where to go next as she did her business. Deciding to head first to a couple clubs, Bianca made her choice, paid in cash for her meal, and headed to what she soon learned was a place frequented by lesbians.<br />
<br />
This she soon didn&#39;t bother her, and after she&#39;d ordered an ice tea, too scared she might be do something stupid if she started drinking alcohol, she sat and listened to the music as she checked out the other patrons. Seeing one in particular had noticed her after a bit, she was steeling herself to go over to the other woman and introduce herself when she was distracted by a sudden commotion. Music suddenly cutting off, just as someone shouted, &quot;You do this every time. I think you&#39;re targeting us because of our clientele,&quot; Bianca watched as a large group of men, one of them telling someone Bianca assumed was the speaker to shut their mouth, began herding the patrons to one side as they systematically zip-tied the wrists of certain people.<br />
<br />
Caught up with the rest of them, Bianca cursed her luck of choosing a place ICE just happened to raid. Thinking if she could slip away, she could turn herself into an otter, she never got the chance as a man grabbed hold of her. Before she could think better of herself, she told him, &quot;Take your meat hooks off me.&quot;<br />
<br />
The man grinned at this, and as he zip-tied her wrists, he demanded, &quot;That&#39;s a beautiful accent. Tell me, where&#39;d it come from?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I want my lawyer,&quot; someone exclaimed, and seeing it was the woman who&#39;d been checking her out, anything else she might say was driven from Bianca as she cursed again as she suddenly realised something she&#39;d forgotten.<br />
<br />
Hauled out of the club with a bunch of other women, all who either were medium to dark skin colour or spoke with a noticeable accent, Bianca was frightened by the situation as she thought about how she hadn&#39;t included anything in the profile which would say she was a natural citizen. Having no birth certificate, photo. ID, nothing, Bianca&#39;s mind worked furiously as she tried to figure out a way to get away as she was forced into the back of squad car with two other women, one of whom was the one who&#39;d been checking her out. Having not set any timer, she knew the only way for her to become Richard again was to activate the software, which she understood meant none of the safety features meant to protect the Chronivac and the user would engage. Seeing no way she’d be able to transform herself into her animal form, she again cursed her luck as the cars pulled away from the club.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t catch a break, no matter how I use that fucking programme,&quot; Bianca thought to herself and gazing out the window, she wondered what was going to happen to her, even as she felt she had a pretty good idea.</p>
