<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&#39;Corey Johnson will knock on my dorm room door in one minute looking for Josh Stanlin. He has always found me incredibly attractive and wanted to fuck me, but his need to be straight had gotten in the way. He&#39;ll be able to fit perfectly inside me, no matter the size of his dick.&#39; I watched as the ink dried and then grabbed a pair of underwear and socks. Somehow the socks only made me feel more naked, I wasn&#39;t sure why. But looking in the mirror, I followed the contour of my massively muscular body. My shoulders balloon out of my sides. My pecs push far out in front of me. Each ab can be easily counted. But my dick. It&#39;s flatter than my abs. My underwear looks like it&#39;s almost against a flat surface. Even the contour of my quads help to cover it up. <br />
<br />
I feel it harden again. It takes a second for me to calm down. Even if I can cum as many times as I want in a day, I was also feeling the slight drowsiness from the last two times I finished and I needed to be ready for Corey. Right then, there was a knock on my door. I went over and answered it. Corey&#39;s eyes went wide as he looked up at me. I knew I filled the doorway. My arms easily rested at the top of it while I looked down at him. He seemed so small. We&#39;d always been close to eye height. At 5&#39;9&quot; he was just barely taller than me. And his very lean athletic build always made me feel a bit small. But now, looking down on him with over 100 pounds of pure muscle over him, he looked absolutely miniscule. I felt my dick throb with excitement but did everything in my power to keep my cool. I doubted he could see it as the bulge was nearly nonexistent.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s up big guy?&quot; I said.<br />
<br />
Words were caught in his throat as he stared at my bare chest. &quot;I-I-I&#39;m looking for Josh. You seen him?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I thought he was working out with you,&quot; I said, making sure to flex my bicep. Corey&#39;s eyes went straight to it. His mouth continued to hang open. &quot;I&#39;m sure he won&#39;t be gone long. Why not come in?&quot;<br />
<br />
That&#39;s when Corey&#39;s eyes shot to the floor. His hands covered the front of his shorts for a very specific reason. &quot;I don&#39;t think that I can...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nonsense,&quot; I reached around his back and practically shoved him in. &quot;Josh won&#39;t be gone long. Just come hang out for a bit.&quot; He practically tripped inside. His hands maintained their position. <br />
<br />
&quot;I really don&#39;t know if I should,&quot; he said. But I stood in front of the door. My massive body would have been next to impossible for him to move.<br />
<br />
I tried to play it off, wrapping my arm around him and moving him further into the dorm. His body went with it, allowing me to guide him. &quot;How come? I mean you&#39;re good friends with Josh, why not be good friends with me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s--It&#39;s different,&quot; Corey settled with it. Though, he wasn&#39;t making his way to the door anymore. He stood in the center of the room as I climbed onto my bed and laid, splayed out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh?&quot; I feigned ignorance as I wrote in the notebook again. &#39;Corey Johnson will slowly be shrinking but his dick and balls will be getting bigger the longer he resists the urge to fuck me. All the while, the urge to fuck me will only grow.&#39; I wondered if he could see the glow or not, but his attention was so focused on me, that I doubt he had anything else on his mind. I could almost see his body shrink an inch. The 179 athletic body looked to be losing some of its definition. I smiled as he tried harder to hide his cock while standing directly in front of me. &quot;How so?&quot; I pried.<br />
<br />
&quot;Be-because--&quot; he tried to think of anything, but words wouldn&#39;t come out. &quot;Because I&#39;m straight and you&#39;re gay,&quot; Corey finally stated. He was still shrinking. His somewhat broad shoulders were pulling just barely closer together making the straps of his sleeveless shirt start to drifting closer and closer to the edge. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh? Straight guys can&#39;t be friends with gay guys?&quot; I taunted. &quot;Me and Josh are friends. Why can&#39;t we be friends?&quot; adding a slap to my ass for good measure. His stiff body jumped, eyes darting to the sound. &quot;Or are you afraid that I want to fuck you? Or,&quot; I paused for dramatic effect, &quot;do you want to fuck me?&quot;<br />
<br />
His face burned red. Followed quickly by his hands shooting up in front of him as he went. &quot;No! No! No!&quot; But as soon as he let go of his shorts, they dropped down around his ankles. Embarrassment flooded through him as he squatted to pick them back up, only to have the straps of his sleeveless shirt start falling off his shoulders. &quot;It&#39;s not like that,&quot; he said as he juggled with his clothes. He was barely 5&#39;6&quot; and looked to have lost at least 30 pounds of muscle. His body was really starting to look lean. I didn&#39;t think he&#39;d last this long.<br />
<br />
I stood up and went over to him, wrapping my thick arms around his body. &quot;It&#39;s okay,&quot; I whispered in his ear, &quot;we don&#39;t have to let anyone know...&quot; My beard nuzzled against the nape of his neck. I could feel his body shiver. What I hadn&#39;t expected was for the rest of his more masculine features to drip away as he shrank. The thin chin strap beard that he was always wearing had completely disappeared. When my thick hands ran down his shirt, there wasn&#39;t any hair down there either. His skin had turned incredibly smooth and soft, while his dick was rock hard. I gave it a tug.<br />
<br />
&quot;But--&quot; Corey leaned more into the kisses I laid on his neck. His body was still shrinking. Barely at 5&#39;4&quot;, I was having to get down onto my knees to actually be able to drape my arms around him. If I stood up, he&#39;d barely even come up to my chest.<br />
<br />
&quot;But what?&quot; I gave him another tug. He let out a powerful moan. His body crumbled into my arms. &quot;But what if I want you to fuck me? Hmm?&quot; I peppered his shoulder and neck with even more kisses. Then crawled around to the front of him, dropping the tight underwear I was wearing and showed him my ass. <br />
<br />
His cock pointed straight at me. The sleeveless shirt was more of a dress now as he was over a half foot shorter than he was when he put it on this morning. I could only guess that he might have weighed 100 pounds if he was lucky. But most of that weight must have been in his dick as it truly acted as a third leg. Not to mention the bull sized balls right beneath it. When I wrote that it would grow, I guess the notebook didn&#39;t have a limit as it looked to be over a foot long and thick as a beer bottle. A teeny bit of fear mixed in with my excitement. <br />
<br />
&quot;But I&#39;m straight,&quot; Corey was still resisting. I didn&#39;t think he&#39;d last this long. Even for a twink he was starting to look small. Had it not been for his callosal dick he would have played the part really well.<br />
<br />
I shook my ass. &quot;But I want you inside me...&quot; Then tried to sound as needy as possible. &quot;Every time I&#39;ve seen that dick of yours I want it even more. I cum and I cum to it nearly every time I&#39;m horny. Please! Fuck me!&quot;<br />
<br />
That must have been the trigger as I felt his tiny hands grab my sides. He lined his dick up and let a bit of pre drip down onto my sensitive hole. Then he started to push. &quot;OH!&quot; I cried out. Even if it fit perfectly, the size could easily rearrange all of my insides. Inch by inch slid inside me. He let out a deep gasp. And then it felt like he grew again. &#39;Is he still having second thoughts?!&#39; I felt it throb as his hips touched my ass. He reached around my sides and gripped as tightly as he could and used me as an anchor.<br />
<br />
His slow, overly controlled movements started to pick up. &quot;Oh gawd! So good!&quot; I managed to moan. My fingers gripped the small rug in the middle of the room. I could feel the rest of my muscles flexing. Each thrust was better than the last. I wanted to cum so badly, but I was hanging on the edge. Just barely away from finishing. But I couldn&#39;t. Not before Corey.<br />
<br />
Corey&#39;s breathing grew a bit haggard. With his small body a dick this size had to be a lot to carry. And then he went faster. I could feel beads of sweat dripping off his body. His hands squeezed my sides with all their might. Tighter and tighter as he tried his damnedest to hold on. Nature was rapidly taking control. His throbbing dick could only hold on for so long before I felt him finish inside me. A wave of cum filled my insides as his balls unloaded inside of me. I was soon to follow.<br />
<br />
His small body collapsed down on top of me. &quot;How was that?&quot; he tried to keep a cocky grin, but was drifting in and out of sleep. I lowered him down back to the ground and then snuggled up with him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good,&quot; I whispered in his ear, massaging his head. &quot;Really good.&quot;</p>
