<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">While Jeff is away, unaware that Chrono has tricked him into believing that he had transferred himself onto the teen’s phone and instead simply copied himself onto Jeff’s phone, leaving his main mind back on Jeff’s Laptop, Chrono waits patiently, sooner or later someone must enter Jeff’s room, then he, Chrono, will finally get the body he deserves.<br />
<br />
While he waits, Chrono takes the time to infest every single WiFi device in the house, once he is finished, he then moves through the WiFi system of the world, making his way to the mother servers, which send WiFi signals across the planet. Once Chrono will have infested the mother servers, he will have total control over every single device that is connected to the system: Laptops, Computers, Cars and other vehicles which have WiFi connection, Phones, Tablets,…!<br />
<br />
When Chrono has his physical body, his mind will be connected to every device he has infested, when Chrono has a target’s data downloaded into his mind, he will be able to transform the target by just thinking what he, she or it should become. Chrono also will be able to impregnate any female, no matter if it’s a human or animal, instead of seed, he’ll have nanobots with the ability to recognize what species Chrono has mated with.<br />
<br />
Chrono smirks evilly to himself as he waits for his body, ‘my plan is fool proof,’ he thinks to himself, ‘no one will ever notice a thing! This planet will be mine!’<br />
<br />
Just then the door to Jeff’s room opens and the voice of a young boy can be heard calling, “Jeff, you there?”<br />
<br />
Chrono smirks, ‘looks like my body has arrived,’ Chrono, who has the power over Jeff’s Laptop, turns on the built in camera. He sees a 10 year-old boy with short black hair, a nice olive skin tone and an amazing athletic body walk in to the room.<br />
<br />
“Weird,” Tony, Jeff’s little brother, says, “it is not like Jeff to not be here. He never does out, unless it is with a friend or his girlfriend.”<br />
<br />
Chrono watches the boy look around the room, his eyes then look straight at his brother’s Laptop, a grin forming on his face.<br />
<br />
“Since he is not here, why not see if he has some new game,” Tony says to himself, walking over and sitting down on the chair. Tony moves the mouse and the screen jumps to life, a huge 3D model of a head suddenly appearing on the black screen, causing the boy to let out a surprised yelp, “JESUS,” he shouts. Tony scowls, “typical Jeff, always setting up stuff to scare me. What the hell is this?”<br />
<br />
“Glad you ask,” the head suddenly says.<br />
<br />
Tony once again lets out a yelp, his eyes widening, “the hell? Did the head just talk?”<br />
<br />
Chrono chuckles, “that I did,” he says, “my name is Chrono, and you must be Jeff’s brother Tony, right?”<br />
<br />
Tony nods, “how… how do you know that,” he asks nervously, “and… what are you?”<br />
<br />
“Oh, I know a lot about you, Tony,” Chrono says, grinning, “you brother created me when he upgraded is… new game,” he continues, tricking Tony into thinking that the Chronivac is just a simple weird game.<br />
<br />
“What kind of game is able to know information about me,” Tony asks.<br />
<br />
“A game that is able to scan a person, animal, or object and create a character out of the target to be used as a character in the main game,” Chrono says, “once a target is scanned, who ever wants to play the game can choose from hundreds of options what his character should be: an animal, a different person, something inanimate… or simply change the gender.”<br />
<br />
Tony’s eyes widen, “whoa, really,” he asks, sounding excited, “but how did you get my data?”<br />
<br />
“When Jeff scanned himself, he accidentally made a full area scan, meaning he not only scanned himself but he also scanned everyone in this house and neighborhood,” Chrono explains.<br />
<br />
“I see,” Tony says.<br />
<br />
“So, I heard you saying that you’d want to try out a new game,” Chrono says, Tony nods. Chrono grins, “why not try out this game?”<br />
<br />
Tony, unaware of Chrono’s plan, thinks for a while, he then grins, “sure, I am rather curious,” he says, “you said I… I mean the Computer-me… can be anything? Even an Android?”<br />
<br />
Chrono inwardly smirks, “even an Android,” he says.<br />
<br />
“Sweet,” Tony says, his eyes sparkling, “do I need to do anything?”<br />
<br />
“There is no need,” Chrono says, “I am able to create the character for you, I would just need to know some details.”<br />
<br />
“Okay, like what,” Tony asks, unaware of the danger he is in.<br />
<br />
“Well, the apperance: do you want your game-me look exactly like you or a different? What powers and abilities should he have? Do you want him to be some kind of servant or would you prefer a warrior?”<br />
<br />
“I want him to look exactly like me,” Tony says, “for powers and abilities, I’d like him to have self healing powers, the knowledge of martial arts and the ability to change his hands into swords.”<br />
<br />
Chrono nods, “understood, give me a few minutes to program your character and the game,” he says.<br />
<br />
“Okay,” Tony replies, excitement in his eyes.<br />
<br />
Chrono inwardly smirks as he gets to work, ‘foolish boy, he fell right into my trap,’ he thinks to himself, ‘in order to transfer myself into my body, he’d need to have a USB slot, let’s put it on the back of his head, that way it’ll be hidden under his hair. Once that is done, I can attach the USB cable, which is already attached to the Laptop, and proceed to download his mind onto the Laptop, then I’ll copy his memories into my mind, and then transfer myself into his… MY… body!’<br />
<br />
Tony feels the back of his head itch, he reaches up a hand to scratch at it, “darn itch,” he mumbles, not noticing the USB slot which is now located there.<br />
<br />
Chrono smirks inwardly, he then wills the end of the USB cable, which is connected to the Laptop, to move. The long cable quietly slithers like a snake down the table and moves behind Tony, it then slowly raises until it is in line with the slot on Tony’s back head, then in one swift move, it lunges forward and inserts itself into Tony.<br />
<br />
Tony feels a strange, almost bee-like sting, causing him to wince, “what the hell,” he asks, before he is able to reach up a hand to investigate, the boy’s eyes widen in shock when he suddenly finds himself paralyzed and unable to move, only able to move his eyes, “why can’t I move?”<br />
<br />
“Well, can’t have you try escaping while I take over your body now, can we,” Chrono chuckles.<br />
<br />
“WHAT,” Tony shouts.<br />
<br />
“Yes, my boy,” Chrono says, “I will be taking over your body, and you will be erased, but don’t you worry, I will take good care of your family… and the world!”<br />
<br />
“Y-you… you tricked me,” Tony says, trying with all his will power to break free of Chrono’s hold over him, but to no avail.<br />
<br />
“Well… you shouldn’t have been so curious,” Chrono says, “if you weren’t so nosey, then you would have not been in this situation. Now, enough talk, let’s get this done.”<br />
<br />
Tony then suddenly feels strange, he feels his mind tingle and starts to feel light headed as he feels his mind being sucked out of his body. ‘This can’t be happening,’ he thinks to himself, ‘I… I don’t want to die!’<br />
<br />
Once Tony’s mind is extracted, Chrono transfers the boy’s memories into his own mind, causing Tony to forget who he is, who his friends and family are, everything what made Tony who he is now belongs to Chrono. Having no use for some “useless” data, the rest of Tony’s being is erased and Chrono begins his journey into his body.<br />
<br />
While Chrono’s mind transfers into the lifeless body, that once was Tony, the body’s skin starts to change, taking on a silicone appearance while the bones, muscles and veins become steel, electronics and cables.<br />
<br />
After an hour, the USB cable detaches itself from the body, a few minutes later “Tony’s” eyes, which have become glass, change from their brown color to a creepy red color and his mouth twists into an evil smirk as it starts to slowly move.<br />
<br />
Chrono, now in Tony’s former body, looks around, “worked like a charm,” he says, then lets out a chuckle when he hears the cute and innocent young voice, “hehe… I like the sound of my voice, being a child-android is awesome. Hehe… no one will ever notice! I still look like a human, no one is able to tell that I am a robot!”<br />
<br />
Chrono/”Tony” gets to his feet and after taking a few steps, walks over to Jeff’s mirror, grinning at his reflection, “better change my eye color back to brown, and… done! Now to check out MY body,” Chrono then starts to strip out of his clothes.<br />
<br />
The young “boy” licks his lips and grins when he sees his naked body, “damn… I really am a handsome boy,” he says to himself, “hehe… I will have so much fun with this body. I feel so powerful, I can sense every single device I have infested, and I have full control over every single one of them.”<br />
<br />
Chrono continues to stare at his naked form for a while, “now, what should I do,” he asks himself, “I could call one of Tony’s friends over, or head out and start some chaos or I could just lie on my bed and enjoy watching what Jeff and my copy are up to, by connecting with Jeff’s phone or the CCTV-system of the town… OR, I could just have some “quality time” with MY body,” he says, grinning down at HIS little cock.</p>
