<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Despite how calm he was due to the music, Paul still felt a sense of confusion, hesitation, and uncertainty. The shocks from the medallion have been unpredictable, the circumstances he found himself in broke every law of physics he knew, he did not understand how to return things to normal, and he didn’t know anything about who this ballerina is, why she looked like him, and why she wasn’t wearing a leotard. <br />
<br />
The ease that he was feeling briefly cut out when his medallion shined one last time. Glowing, the medallion floated in the air, with Paul floating upwards too. His anxiety returned, though the music reduced the fear he was facing. Paul started to feel like he was in danger, and tried to resist the spell the music was putting on him. This worked for a second, and he thought for a second that he could see the room he was originally in, but returned back into the mysterious white room with the ballerina. The spell of the music put his fears away once again. <br />
<br />
Still, Paul knew he was in danger. The music just reduced the anxiety and put him at ease despite this. <br />
<br />
He started to float again, below where the medallion was floating. He found the room, the medallion, and the ballerina all growing. Or, it was that he actually started to shrink. Paul didn’t want believe that at first, because he didn’t feel like changes were happening in his body, but it became undeniable. Paul was shrinking. <br />
<br />
Paul estimated his height to be about 3’6”, and about one and a half feet shorter than the ballerina in front of him. <br />
<br />
The more he shrank, the more at ease he was again. This time, more so than before. He even started to dance in the air along with the music. <br />
<br />
Paul’s movements started to resemble the ballerina in front of him. Soon enough he was completely in sync with her. Paul knew deep down that he didn’t know how to dance like this, and he was the one being manipulated. <br />
<br />
The medallion floated towards the ballerina, with Paul forced to float behind it. He couldn’t tell how far away he was from the ballerina. He was synced perfectly with her movements, and thus, facing away from her. <br />
<br />
While floating, Paul realized that his clothes were fading away. Once his clothes completely disappeared, he started to notice his skin color darkening. <br />
<br />
Paul gently collided with the ballerina. His shoulder levels completely matched the ballerina’s, and Paul’s crotch surprisingly aligned with the ballerina’s. Paul didn’t feel any physical changes, but his proportions apparently did change. His legs were very small, his fingertips couldn’t even reach her wrist, and his body matched the size of her’s perfectly. The medallion he was following landed on top of the ballerina’s, and started to merge with it. <br />
<br />
Prior to that moment, Paul did not sense the changes in his body. Once his medallion combined with the ballerina’s, this changed. <br />
<br />
Paul immediately began to sweat, heavily, as if he was in the hottest sauna that he ever set foot in. Or at least, that is what it felt like to him. In reality, the insides of his body were turning into  cotton Lycra fabric and slowly exiting his body. The more Paul “sweat” the more empty he felt in his body and the more surface area was able to be felt on his “body.” His hands, fingers, chest, and most of Paul’s body above his crotch felt this transformation. His arms to his fingers were all in a more lighter and transparent fabric, as opposed to the more solid fabric of the rest of the outfit. This fabric turned out to be lace. His legs, private parts, neck, and head did not experience any transformation quite yet. However, due to the movement’s of the ballerina’s dance, his head leaned forward and his legs flailed around, surprisingly not affecting her dance at all. <br />
<br />
Within a few seconds, Paul lost most feelings of his bodily functions. He no longer could breathe nor feel his heart beat. He was starting to notice how flat his body was becoming. It was so flat that his body was slowly being wrapped around the ballerina’s body. <br />
<br />
The next part to start transforming was Paul’s penis. Paul felt a sting in his best friend, as it was stretched behind him. The more it stretch, the more it flattened. The sting turned into a feeling of being squeezed really tightly. Eventually, the tip of his penis touched two sides of fabric that was formed from his body, in between the ballerina’s tights, and past her butt. When the fabric connected, a huge sting was felt, and the parts merged. <br />
<br />
Paul’s neck and head began to sag next. As the fabric formed from his body tried to connect together behind the ballerina’s body, the less material was available from the front. Paul’s neck started to pinch together to make up for the lost material. Then the top of his head was level with the neckline. The force from the woman’s breasts were enough to squeeze the back of Paul’s head towards his face. He was surprised that he maintained his ability to think and feel all his senses, despite his brain turning into fabric. As the force from the boobs started to reach Paul’s face, his face had no choice but to round out and then flatten, with his eyes, nose, ears, and mouth being consumed with fabric. Soon enough, Paul began to feel a line of stings throughout his back and arms, as his fabric has merged and completed the leotard. <br />
<br />
The last part of the body to change was surprisingly Paul’s legs. The entirety of a leotard was complete, so what was supposed to be next?<br />
<br />
His legs started to also wrap behind behind the ballerina’s butt, already merging with other parts of the fabric, giving Paul a huge sting. His legs then felt the same feeling of sweating that he felt throughout the transformation. This time it was lace, similar to the sleeves. This process ended up being faster than the rest of the transformation, with the legs flattening like it was being rolled under a rolling pin. The length of the legs reached down to the middle of the ballerina’s thighs. Both ends of Paul’s feet merged for the final time, forming a complete skirt and completing the transformation. <br />
<br />
Paul’s senses throughout his body became more and more sensitive after the transformation completed. Every movement, from the sleeves to the skirt, caused Paul to feel a strong breeze. Paul began to soak up some of the sweat on the ballerina, feeling like he fell into a couple of small puddles. Yet, as the ballerina danced, and the music played, Paul felt at ease. He knew he was inanimate, never able to move on his own, see his friends, or speak again, but the spell of the music prevented this reality from fulling being realized. All Paul wanted was to feel the air and experience the elegance of the most talented ballerina he has ever seen. Paul’s final form was a beautiful long sleeved black leotard with a skirt. <br />
<br />
The ballerina’s medallion shined, and the music slowed down. The white room started to disappear, and you found yourself and the ballerina in a studio near the spot Paul originally put on the medallion. <br />
<br />
Time begins to start again slowly. Paul can hear, in a slow voice, his mother. He was able to make out her words to be “there you are, Pauline. Glad to see you are almost ready. Here, let me put your hair in a bun.” As time began to speed up back to normal, the ease Paul felt from the music started to fade. Reality was beginning to hit that Paul became this girl’s leotard. And her name is Pauline. She must have replaced Him. <br />
<br />
Pauline removes the amulet from her body and drops it in a box.</p>
