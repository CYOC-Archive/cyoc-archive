<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jack didn&#39;t understand what was happening to his body. Small things about him just kept changing over the last month that he couldn&#39;t quite explain. even though he&#39;d been going to the gym consistently since his sophomore year in college, he&#39;d suddenly found himself having more difficulty lifting the same weight he&#39;d been lifting. It was like he kept losing mass and strength. Well, everywhere other than his ass.<br />
<br />
All of his shirts had started feel a bit bigger on him but all of his shorts and pants were starting to strain against his butt. Two large mounds pushed far out from behind him making anything other than flexible shorts a chore to wear. Even with them, he couldn&#39;t help but stare as he would turn to the side and see the massive trunk behind him. While he&#39;d been trying for the last year to actually bulk his upper body up more, somehow all that training seemed to only effect his lower body.<br />
<br />
Stranger still was his shoes. He&#39;d thought his feet would have stopped growing by now, but he couldn&#39;t ignore just how tight his shoes were getting. Luckily it was getting close to summer and he could just wear his shorts and flipflops around campus without drawing too much attention to himself, though the loud sound of them slapping against the ground did draw a lot of attention to him. And those eyes seemed to linger on his body longer than he would have thought normal. He would have said liked, but somehow feeling the leering stares from his classmates seemed to turn him on.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know what you&#39;re complaining about,&quot; Mike said. He was busy eating his cheap pizza by the slice and chugging down a soda. &quot;I&#39;d love it to get more people to look at me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jack continued munching on his salad. Another strange thing he couldn&#39;t quite ignore. All he wanted was fruits and vegetables, even forgoing dressing to get the normal taste and crunch of the plants. &quot;Yeah... Yeah... Count your blessings or whatever. But I don&#39;t get it. I&#39;ve only lost weight over the last month and can&#39;t seem to gain it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Probably because of that plant based diet,&quot; Mike said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe you should try it,&quot; Jack snarked back. He instantly regretted it. Never one to actually comment on other&#39;s appearances, Jack didn&#39;t know why he said it. He was just frustrated that Mike wasn&#39;t really listening to him. And he knew how much the bigger guy hated when people would comment on his rather rotund size that had only gotten larger since they started college. Without anything stopping him from getting as much soda and greasy food as he wanted, Mike had blown up quite a bit each year as he continued to gain weight. It was just as bad for his skin as pimples only grew more pronounced. &quot;Sorry,&quot; Jack added quietly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh-huh,&quot; Mike went quiet as he finished his food. &quot;I&#39;ve got class.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jack finished up around the same time. &quot;I think I&#39;m going to the gym,&quot; he added. Mike didn&#39;t quite say anything to him. A pit formed in Jack&#39;s stomach a bit deeper than it had been. He changed and went over to the free weights trying to ignore the feeling. However, he was surprised to feel a massive hand slap his behind. His small body naturally jumped at the sudden touch. <br />
<br />
&quot;Woah there,&quot; Steven, one of the regulars at the gym, said. A soft smile filled his handsome face as he took a step back. &quot;Didn&#39;t mean to scare you so much man.&quot; His thick pecs jostled as he laughed.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s fine,&quot; Jack&#39;s face still burned bright red as he tried to calm himself down. It didn&#39;t help that his heart rate was already up from trying to work out his arms.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thought you&#39;d be doing another leg workout with all that junk in that trunk,&quot; Steven joked.<br />
<br />
Jack felt blood rush away from his arms and into his penis as the handsome jock looked him over. &quot;No... Just trying to get a bit bigger.&quot; He&#39;d been focusing arms more lately, though that didn&#39;t seem to do anything at all. Not like he was going to say that to the guy who gained and lost weight on a whim. &quot;What&#39;s up?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not too much. Just coach riding my ass. He says I need a tutor. None of the other guys are u to it, so I thought maybe you&#39;d have some spare time,&quot; Steven said. <br />
<br />
&quot;Sure!&quot; Jack accidently said too excitedly. &quot;I mean yeah. That&#39;s fine. I&#39;m free tonight. I&#39;ll keep my door unlocked.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sounds good,&quot; Steven smiled. &quot;See you tonight,&quot; he added, then went back to his own workout.<br />
<br />
Even though there was still the discomfort in Jack&#39;s shoes, Jack couldn&#39;t lose the smile on his face as he finished his workout. Though, that smile did start to falter as he went into the changing room as a small stomachache overcame him. He brushed it off at first. Yet, through the rest of the day the pain persisted. Even with some antiacids, he couldn&#39;t get it to subside.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t ruin this for me...&quot; Jack complained to his stomach as he prepped a lesson for his and Steven&#39;s shared math class. He&#39;d been dreaming of this day since he&#39;d seen the jock freshman year. The jock only grew more handsome with age as his muscles grew bigger and more defined, his jaw widened and his clothing pulled tighter against his body. The only thing that didn&#39;t change was his perfectly styled blond hair that was trimmed fairly short.<br />
<br />
Just thinking about Steven in his room was turning Jack on. &quot;Shit...&quot; Jack muttered as he felt his erection fill his shorts. It was still a little bit before Steven was supposed to come over and Jack couldn&#39;t deny just how much he was wanting to rub one out. He pulled up a few pictures for inspiration and went to work.<br />
<br />
His hand started off slow. Just soft motions as blood started to engorge his cock even more. Each one drawing him deeper into the fantasy with the man on the screen. He continued to pull and tug at his cock, polishing the end each time a wave of pleasure shot through his brain. &quot;Oh fuck yeah...&quot; he moaned picturing Steven&#39;s body more. <br />
<br />
However, the stomachache he had, flared up again. &quot;Fuck!&quot; Jack cursed loudly as the pain in his stomach made his body crumple. However that pain turned into something else rather quickly. Something was pressing up against his asshole. He tried to stand up and go to the bathroom but the pain shot back through him. His body crumbled again. Whatever it was, it was hard. A hard oblong shape pushing against his backdoor. Jack tried to force his body to get up, but couldn&#39;t get off his knees.<br />
<br />
His hands tightened against the sheets of his bed. &quot;Shhhhhiiiiiitttt...&quot; he grunted and groaned as whatever was inside him was pushing its way out. He bit down on his mattress and gave a push. All he could do was hope that it wouldn&#39;t create too much of a mess. &quot;F-fuck...&quot; he breathed several haggard breaths as he tried to regain his composure. A bit of sweat dripped from his brow as he relaxed against his bed.<br />
<br />
Jack looked down at what he passed. &quot;What the hell...&quot; he stared blankly at the colored egg on the floor. He picked it up. It was perfectly clean. &quot;What the hell?&quot; he repeated as he examined it a bit more. That&#39;s when a funny feeling started happening around his tail bone. A strange stretching and pulling feeling. Jack leaned forward, mouth agape as the absolute foreign sensation ran up through his spine. Without thinking, he dropped the egg and ran to the bathroom to see what was happening.<br />
<br />
Twisting and turning around he saw his spine elongating and then twisting upwards. Soft brown and white fur started to grow on his new appendage. &quot;WHAT THE HELL!?&quot; he screamed as he pulled the tail and could feel it in his brain. <br />
<br />
In the other room he heard his phone start ringing. He let it go to voicemail as he continued to gawk at his body. None of this made any sense. He couldn&#39;t understand how he just shit out an egg and then grew a tail. That&#39;s when his phone started ringing again. He slowly made his way to it, then back to the bathroom to keep looking at his tail. It was his parents.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey son,&quot; his dad said. &quot;How&#39;s it going?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m kind of busy right now...&quot; Jack responded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh?&quot; his dad asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ask him. Ask him,&quot; his mother whispered. &quot;Put him on a video call.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey bud. I&#39;m going to put you on a video call,&quot; his dad said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d rather not...&quot; Jack responded.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, I think you should...&quot; his dad said. The message came up and Jack reluctantly accepted it. Only to be surprised to see his father with massive bunny ears on top of his head and a pink upturned nose. &quot;I think we&#39;ve got something to talk about...&quot; Jack dropped his phone at the sight. There was no way something like this could be real. &quot;Jack? Jack?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Jack?&quot; his mother appeared in frame. However, her blond hair was a far more golden sheen along with two downturned golden retriever ears. &quot;It&#39;s alright. I know it&#39;s a lot to take in but you need to listen to your father.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck man...&quot; Jack cursed again.<br />
<br />
His dad ignored the language. &quot;Son? I need to tell you that we&#39;re easter bunnies and around this time of year we lay a lot of eggs. I thought it was going to skip you because I started when I was 18. It was right around the same time I met your mother.&quot; He clasped hands with his wife. &quot;But you need to make sure to keep those eggs safe until they disappear. Alright?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure. Yeah...&quot; Jack said. His mind was still whirling from what was happening. He couldn&#39;t concentrate and didn&#39;t know what was real or fake any more. His thoughts swirled around making it impossible to make sense of the world.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ll have a really strong urge to hide them,&quot; his father continued. &quot;Just make sure after you lay them you keep them hidden from everyone else. Keep them in one area where you know no one can find them. Alright? They&#39;ll disappear after a little while and then you don&#39;t have to worry about them anymore.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure... Yeah. Whatever...&quot; Jack muttered. <br />
<br />
&quot;Good man. Now we have to go. Keep those eggs hidden from everyone,&quot; his dad repeated.<br />
<br />
&quot;And know that we love you!&quot; His mom added. &quot;We&#39;ll be coming up in a few days to check on you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay... Yeah. Love you too,&quot; Jack said back.</p>
