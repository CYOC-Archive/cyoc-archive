<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The sand covered beach was warm but the sun was warmer as the two of them lied down in the sand to “work” on getting a suntan but in truth they just wanted to spend some time alone. While the vacation house was big enough for everyone it wasn’t big enough for everyone to have their own private room and having sex in a room with another couple was something neither of them wanted. <br />
<br />
“This is nice.” Said the red-haired women as she lied face down in the warm sand in a small private cove away from her friends and everyone else. She wasn’t alone however her boyfriend of 4 years lied beside her on his stomach enjoying the sun as well. <br />
<br />
“I am just glad we didn’t step on any more shells.” Said her boyfriend, both of them unaware that the bottom of their feet where the “shells” had hit them where already transforming as new scales began to form. <br />
<br />
“Just relax Nate.” Said his girlfriend, Rose as lied in the sand. Nate lied down beside her and then he began to run one of his hands down her back rubbing multiple spots earning a slight moan from her. <br />
<br />
Neither of them noticed that their skin was losing every blemish or scar, old injuries where being healed as their bodies began to change. An old ankle injury on Nate disappeared as it became covered with scales. So far none of their legs had been forced together however the skin had turned to scales almost up to their knees. <br />
<br />
The first thing they actually noticed was that the sun was feeling abnormally hot but not too hot, they didn’t know that their bodies were adapting to live an aquatic life. <br />
<br />
“Nate can you do me a favor?” inquired Rose with playfulness in her voice.<br />
<br />
“Of course.” Answered Nate as he kept rubbing her back causing her to be almost totally relaxed.<br />
<br />
“Undo my top.” Requested Rose as Nate grinned as his hand moved to the white strap holding on his girlfriend’s bikini top. With skill he undid the strap caused the top to fall away even if she still lied face down in the sand. He didn’t know and Rose only had a slight notion that her top was getting tight, not painfully tight but still tight as her bust grew in size even as her waistline narrowed and her core began to strengthen. <br />
<br />
Nate didn’t notice any of this as he got up onto one elbow and gave her a kiss on her forehead, Rose closed her eyes and enjoyed his touch as he moved to kiss the back of her neck. All the while he was beginning to change as well, his core strengthened as well, he grew a little broader in the shoulders and his manhood grew in size even as it hardened. <br />
<br />
Both of them began to move flipping over neither of them looking down at their ever-changing legs as the scales moved up to beyond their knees. They where getting lost in the moment as Nate got on top of Rose, his knees on either side of her legs even as one of his hands held himself up while the other pulled on the strings of her bikini bottom letting that fall away just like her top had. For her part, Rose was pulling down Nate’s swim trunks as he helped her by kicking them off. She noticed his increased size but chalked it up to a trick of the light, he had always been enough for her even if she did wish he was bigger. Nate had just enough time to pull a condom out from his swim trunks before kicking them to the side, with Rose’s help it went on to his larger manhood. <br />
<br />
Then with one last long kiss he slid within her earning a load moan of his name from her lips as they began to have sex on the beach form all they knew they where alone. <br />
<br />
They where not, sitting on a small rock, which sat halfway out of the water so that her top “Human” half was out of the water along with a third of her tail was Shelly. She watched as the two former humans began to make love. <br />
<br />
Merfolk society was much more open than human society, seeing a couple make love in public was totally acceptable and was encouraged to help boost the population. Gay, Lesbians and even poly relationships where all acceptable as long as all parties where of age and everyone worked toward adding to their shrinking population. <br />
<br />
Shelly watched as the humans changed some more, the women’s red hair turned even brighter shade of red as her neck narrowed and her face became even more beautiful. Her lover was changing as well, his jaw line became stronger, his face more handsome and his blonde hair became a dark golden blonde. She watched as some slits opened up on their sides as they rolled over and the women took her turn on top riding the man even as their gills came in and their hands became webbed. <br />
<br />
They both climaxed at the same time, the condom they had put on had broken a long time ago under the growth which was happening to the man but it had no real value anymore. Human birth control didn’t work on merfolk and as far as Shelly knew the women was going to get pregnant from this, she hoped she did at least. <br />
<br />
For a moment the two lied there, the women lying on top of the man, the man still within her as the final changes swept over them. Their ankles snapped together and lengthened, merfolk where much longer then humans but mostly in the tail. At their feet spread out forming the end tail. Their legs merged together as bones shifted and their muscles moved around. The scales had stopped around their waist line aside from some scales around their gills which sat by the rib cage. <br />
<br />
The final changes couldn’t be ingnored by them as they looked down in a mixture of horror, disbelief and wonder as their legs merged together, the man’s dick still within the women. A merman’s dick was internal to help with swimming but came out when it was time to mate and it was still out. The women’s tail quickly became covered with a mixture of dark red, bright red and a few pink scales while the man’s tail was a mixture of dark gold, orange and a few blacks. Now the key moment, part of the transformation was a quick acceptance of merfolk hood and the sea but that wasn’t for sure. If they didn’t accept the sea right away everyone could be in trouble.<br />
<br />
“My God.” Said a breathless Rose as she looked at her tail in disbelief.<br />
<br />
“What the?” added Nate as he reached down and touched his tail, it was real.<br />
<br />
“Hello there.” Came a voice as Rose and Nate looked toward the beach to see a beautiful women about their age, she was nude aside from what looked to be a top made of sea shells and sea weed but left very little to the imagination. “I am Shelly and I welcome you two to the merfolk race.”</p>
