<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">He knew it in his heart. He knew that would happen. He knew that the moment he and Dillon entered that dining hall, their already tattered reputations would be destroyed beyond repair, and all because the first things they happened to see upon entering were the bananas. Before they could even think about stopping themselves, the two boys had wholeheartedly began pleasuring the bananas and, in turn, themselves. By the time Johnathan caught himself, the entire cafeteria was watching him sluttily lick the banana, moaning like a bitch in the heat. It didn&#39;t take long for the blonde man to forcefully remove the two bananas that Dillon had been deeepthroating and throw all three phallic objects in the trash before storming out of the room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, fuck this! I&#39;m calling reinforcements,&quot; Johnathan announced once they were safely out of earshot.<br />
<br />
&quot;Reinforcements?&quot; Dillon asked, slightly fearful of what that meant. For the most part, the asian twink was just disappointed their fun had ended early. Dillon thought that this session would&#39;ve been Johnathan&#39;s ticket to twinkhood but clearly the dumb asian needed to try harder. Still, more conspiracy theorists would make Dillon&#39;s goal much more difficult.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I never told you guys about them in case one of you got compromised, which clearly was a good call. Now, come on,&quot; Johnathan ordered.<br />
<br />
******************************************<br />
<br />
The first flag that something was wrong should&#39;ve been the music. Like Johnathan, the blonde leader&#39;s reinforcements hated music in any form, so this was quite the shock. Nonetheless, Johnathan was quite fond of this group, so he simply assumed there was another purpose to the nefarious music and knocked on the door, unaware that he was swaying with the beat as he sealed his fate.<br />
<br />
The door quickly swung wide open. The second flag should&#39;ve struck Johnathan like a truck but the blonde&#39;s judgement was too clouded to run. Lube and sex toys were scattered across the floor, as were multiple porn magazines, all clearly gay. Leaning on the computer desk with one leg in the air, a blonde with numerous tattoos and piercings all over his body was shouting all sorts of obscenities as he was getting roughly plowed. Nestled in perfect position behind him, a redhead was mercilessly plowing the blonde with a cock beyond compare. The force with which the redhead fucked the blonde shook the desk and Johnathan and Dillon were mainly surprised that they hadn&#39;t heard the fuck session from outside.<br />
<br />
Had it just been those two twinks inside, Johnathan might have escaped from his fate. Instead, both visiting twinks were drawn to the man who had opened the door. One only needed Dillon&#39;s current intelligence to recognize that the man at the door was another twink, just further along in the process than Johnathan and his crew. He had brown hair that was perfectly styled and green eyes complimented his perfect face in such a way that it had already gotten the visiting twinks hard. There was just something about him that seemed to make everyone think &#39;FUCK ME&#39; and the two boys were no exception. Even the way the brunette examined the two, biting his lip in a practiced manner that practically screamed &#39;I wanna fuck&#39;, entranced the boys.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey sexy boys, what can I do for you?&quot; the twink finally delivered, his voice as smooth as silk. It took everything Johnathan and Dillon had not to come right then and there. Even the brunette&#39;s voice was both hypnotic and arousing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi, um, can we fuck -- I mean, see -- Micheal or Lucas?&quot; Johnathan asked cautiously.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait a minute, I recognize that voice. Johnny? Is that you? You look so hot!&quot; the brunette said breathily and sluttily. &quot;And gawd, don&#39;t call me Micheal, that sounds so boring. Mikey sounds so much hotter. Come in!&quot;<br />
<br />
As the boys entered, a chill ran down Johnathan&#39;s spine. He recognized the couple fucking on the desk. The emo, foul-mouthed blonde on bottom was Kyle, the furiously Christian theorist who was the group&#39;s go-to guy on all things satanic in nature. He hated homosexuality more than any of the conspiracy theorists and definitely would never have gotten so much as an ear piercing for fear of being too trashy. He certainly wouldn&#39;t have gotten a giant tattoo that read &#39;SLUT&#39; across his chest and certainly wouldn&#39;t have allowed himself to be fucked by Eric, the redhead top that was formerly the university&#39;s wrestling captain before he had joined the theorist forums. He had maintained his form, as did Kyle, though neither of them were anything like the skinny twinks they were now.<br />
<br />
Upon the shaking desk, Johnathan noticed a computer with a video from a Chinese conspiracy group about the changes on the forums. Immediately, he nudged his partner. &quot;Hey, what are they saying on that computer?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How the hell should I know? Like, I don&#39;t speak Chinese,&quot; Dillon explained.<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you talking about? Mandarin is your native tongue. You spoke it fluently with your mother yesterday morning!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My mom doesn&#39;t speak Chinese either Johnny. We were both and raised here. The most I know about anything Chinese is, like, fortune cookies and stuff. That was totes racist,&quot; Dillon chastised, not realizing the plethora of irony in his statement.<br />
<br />
Then Johnathan made his last mistake and lost the closest thing to an ally in his situation. &quot;Dillon, stop being a fucking idiot.&quot;<br />
<br />
The statement sent an already on edge Dillon to climax. The asian twink dropped to his knees, moaning as his pants grew wet from jizz. Johnathan could do nothing but watch as his friend came in buckets, crumbling the raven haired twink&#39;s last vestiges of his former self. Each spurt from the twink&#39;s dick caused his hair to lighten and style itself while his ass grew in volume and perkiness. When he was finished, the asian was now a strawberry blonde and his brown, doe eyes now had a hunger in them.<br />
<br />
The twink stood, dropping his pants as he did. As his bubble butt popped out of his pants with a jiggle, he spoke in an incredibly effeminate voice. &quot;Honey, it&#39;s Dill. You know, like a dick? Anyways, I&#39;m totes done with pretending like I don&#39;t want all these juicy cocks hanging around. Especially this sexy redhead&#39;s tool. Damn that&#39;s big! Johnny, honey, stop acting like you don&#39;t want this and just give in darling. It&#39;ll feel totes better once you do.&quot;<br />
<br />
With that, Dill stripped off his shirt and dove for Eric&#39;s massive dong, leaving Johnathan speechless and shocked.<br />
<br />
It took a while, but seeing Mikey lick his lips and stare at him hungrily forced Johnathan to act. &quot;Mikey, where&#39;s Lucas?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You mean you haven&#39;t noticed? Man, those pheromones are really good, aren&#39;t they Luke?&quot; Mikey asked. Johnathan followed Mikey&#39;s eyes to see the reason he never should&#39;ve come here. On the bed right next to Johnathan, a twink with platinum blonde hair was giggling and moaning madly as he slipped his fingers in and out of his slopping wet boypussy. His bright blue eyes did nothing to hide the lack of intelligence behind them he licked his lips upon seeing Johnathan&#39;s gaze.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hiya Johnny! I&#39;m a slut now and you should be one too!&quot; Luke explained excitedly. Johnathan noticed that the closer he got to Luke, the more his mind clouded over. Was that honey he smelt? Was that coming from Luke&#39;s boypussy? Why couldn&#39;t he call Luke&#39;s boypussy a boypussy? This Luke was nothing like the cold, intelligent survivalist Lucas that Johnathan once knew. This Luke would probably use a rope for BDSM or something, not the hundreds of knots Lucas knew how to tie. This Luke didn&#39;t know how to hunt for fish or gather fruits. All he knew was to hunt for cock and gather cum. And he was probably very good at it. Johnathan kept this group as his backup specifically for Lucas, since the man&#39;s appetite for the realities of the world rivaled his own. At least, they used to.<br />
<br />
All this was too much for Johnathan. He did the only thing he could think of doing besides dancing and stripping off all his clothes.<br />
<br />
He ran.</p>
