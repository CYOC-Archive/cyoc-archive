<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">(author&#39;s note: the reason this has been going on for so long is I&#39;m feeling better after being sick.) <br />
<br />
Lucy and Marcus left the house. They stopped when they saw their street. While it had been a mess before now it was ravaged. Several mailboxes were broken and warped with dried cum covering them. The trees had deep gashes. One tree was even in the road. Several fences were broken including theirs. Worst of all was all the broken windows. It would be a miracle if anyone around here isn&#39;t a were-beast of some kind. &quot;damn it!&quot; Marcus said as he passed by shattered pots. Lucy soon followed his gaze and gasped. Their car was flipped and burned.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Did Chen do this by accident?&quot; Lucy walked over to her husband. He shook his head as he pointed to the hole in the gas tank. &quot;this was arson&quot; he then glanced around and saw more wrecked cars. He had seen some on his way here but was too worried about Lucy to care. &quot;wait, who would do something like this&quot; Lucy could smell several scents. Her were-form had a better smell and these scents seemed hours old. &quot;I don&#39;t know but it looks like they were thorough&quot; he noted that each living room window except for theirs was broken. He clenched his fists &quot;They wanted to change everyone they could find&quot; he said. &quot;my mom lives a few streets down we have to get to her&quot; Lucy said. She was afraid that they wouldn&#39;t stop on this street. Marcus nodded and they sprinted down the road. As they ran they saw more destruction with it smelling slightly fresher each time. He noticed that each fire hydrant was busted and each street name sign had been ripped off. &#39;They made sure humans would be changed&#39;. They finally arrived at Lucy&#39;s mom&#39;s street.  <br />
<br />
Both of them couldn&#39;t help but notice the absence of anybody between here and their home. They expected people to be like them and be out. However, apart from the birds and a broken car going off there was nothing. &quot;well this street seems less destroyed&quot; Marcus said as Lucy ran to her mom&#39;s house. Before her change, Marcus never knew her for her running as she would always be panting. Now both she and he had increased stamina and speed. He followed her and saw her distressed face. The living room window was broken. &quot;Mom!&quot; Lucy yelled. Not hearing a response she climbed in the window. She winced as a small shard of glass cut her leg. She was thankful to see it heal quickly.  <br />
<br />
Marcus grabbed a yard decoration and cleared the glass before following her. The scent of cum was thick as they walked down the hall. They soon opened the busted door and saw a figure under a blanket. &quot;Mom?&quot; Lucy called out. The figure seemed to stir. The sheet fell off of it as it rose. The figure was revealed to be Lucy&#39;s mom, half naked with only the blanket covering her lower half. Marcus covered his eyes quickly as Lucy turned as red as he. &quot;Lucy,&quot; Clara asked. The woman rubbed her eyes as she felt like she woke up from the best dream of her life. Seeing Marcus covering his eyes though made her confused.  <br />
<br />
Looking down she squealed and grabbed her blanket for cover. She was sure she had worn a nightgown to bed last night. &quot;what are you two doing here?&quot; she asked trying to avoid the embarrassing conversation. &quot;didn&#39;t you get my message?&quot; Lucy responded with a question of her own. Clara shook her head. &quot;my phone broke yesterday at the grocery store. Fell right out of my hand&quot; She sighed and took a deep breath. She then smelled the weirdest aromas. From her daughter, it smelled like a barn and her son-in-law smelled like the savanna. She didn&#39;t even know what that meant but she smelled some musky smell and a strange stickiness all over her blanket. Suddenly that fever dream she had didn&#39;t feel like a dream anymore.  <br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
A werewolf smiled as she managed to convert another human to their ranks. The man was now a dark red werewolf that towered over her. She growled until she grabbed a vial from her bag. It was the only thing she had on her. Opening it she waved it in front of the male. His eyes dropped as he became more obedient. &quot;good now go to the woods, Blaze. Follow your nose and you arrive at our pack&quot; She smiled as he nodded and lept out the living room window. She then saw her mate busy ripping off the street name signs. Their alpha wanted to confuse any humans who tried to escape.  <br />
<br />
Of course, none have gotten lucky enough for that. Out of the last few streets they passed they have had several male werewolves added to the pack. Females were far less because she did most of the work. Unfortunately, even with her special werewolf veil she took there were still some humans who didn&#39;t fit their goals. Looking up to the sky she sighed as she could tell morning was coming soon. They would only be able to do a few more. &quot;Aries we have to speed this up forget the unnecessary destruction&quot; she called out. Aries whined as he kicked the car causing it to go off. &quot;come on Viki. It&#39;s so much fun&quot; he punched the hood of the vehicle before complying. &quot;you take this and do the left side of the street and I&#39;ll take the right&quot; She handed him a sack from her bag. In it was the stuff she had used. Viki and Aries then split up to double the results.  <br />
<br />
She pounced through the living room window as she had done to the last couple of houses. The only times she didn&#39;t were those houses with the non-werewolf were-beast scents. She stepped carefully as she walked down the hall to where the human slept. &#39;this one must be a heavy sleeper&#39; she thought as she opened the door. It was a woman with some grey in her hair. Smiling Viki just put her hand in her pussy and dipped it into the woman&#39;s open mouth.  <br />
<br />
The woman woke up with a gag and screamed at the werewolf looming over her. She saw the woman&#39;s nails sharpen and her teeth making Viki smile. Her joy fell flat as she saw green scales grow randomly from her skin, and her hourglass body began to fill out with fat and muscle. The woman freaked out as she looked at her growing hands. Her clothes were ripped apart by her growing frame as her breasts sunk into light green scales. Her muscles surged as a long scaly tail grew from her rear as she fell off the bed. Her vagina reformed into a scaley sack as a scaled penis grew above it her hair began to fall out as she grabbed his massive thirty-inch cock and jacked off. The scales then started to connect across his skin and his muzzle grew. Large ridges ran up his tail and to his new forehead. His nipples and belly button vanished as he cummed. His eight-foot body now had a muscly box shape.   <br />
<br />
Sighing Viki stopped the were-crocodile from grabbing her and pushed him to the bed. &quot;sorry dude but I&#39;m on a deadline&quot; She pulled out another vile and waved it in front of him. The were-croc got woozy and passed out. She quickly put the cap on and returned it to her bag. It was similar to night smoke but mixed with a potion that removes short-term memories. She left the were-croc covered in the blanket she found him under. She looked back at the house and sighed. At least he would be able to enjoy his gift come morning. She jumped through the next living room window and repeated this until the end of the street where she met back up with Aries. &quot;we best get back to the woods. If we&#39;re not past the barrier we&#39;ll be just like these mortals until the next night&quot; she said and the two ran. They stopped after passing a circle of rocks with ancient-looking carvings. Once they were inside the circle the carving glowed bright blue and both they and the circle of stones disappeared. The area suddenly went from dawn to a moonlight night. The two found their newest recruits all bowing to the alpha. He motioned the two forward. &quot;these are the newest members&quot; he asked. Like them, he wore nothing but a bag on his back. His ten-foot body towered over everyone. Vicki and Aries walked up the stone steps to his throne and got on one knee. &quot;yes sir, some we changed, others were like before&quot; Viki stated. The alpha smiled. He had been a wizard in the Dark Ages who found mixing lunar dust with his potions could change him into a werewolf. Over the centuries he&#39;s recruited new pack members to his cause. He even went as far as to make a parallel world filled with his wolves. Every night he would send out some members to get more werewolf&#39;s for his pack. By now he had enough to cover a continent yet he still wasn&#39;t satisfied. He then found out about these concoctions called drugs. he let himself be human again to share his recipe with these drug lords. Sadly their batches weren&#39;t like his and resulted in any were-beast rather than his pure werewolf one. Regardless he did &#39;recruit&#39; any of his pack found who were werewolves. &quot;um sir not to question our amazing numbers but won&#39;t the humans notice this many missing&quot; Aries stated. The alpha waved his hand and Aries was thrown into the crowd. &quot;the city fell into chaos. They will be confused for days.&quot; he then looked at the obedient stares from the werewolves. They were male and female, kids to elders. &quot;now we begin the initiation&quot; he motioned to a blond werewolf girl. She bowed down and he plunged his cock into her mouth. Viki pulled Aries off the ground and pushed him into her pussy. He began licking as all the recruits started having a massive orgy. Soon those already in the alpha&#39;s pack joined in. <br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Clara fell into a deep slumber as the potion made him forget what had happened. In his dream, he was a lifeguard in a Florida swamp. It was nighttime and he had just rescued a beautiful female crocodile who rewarded him with a blowjob. Over the next hour, her would cum in his sleep until the sun rose. Clara would return to her human form unaware of what happened. <br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Lucy could see some changes to her mom not that she was clothed. Her winkles were less noticeable and her hair was less grey. It was also very short. Her teeth looked sharper and larger in her mouth and her eyes were now amber instead of brown. Even her scent was different. It smelt like a swamp mixed with testosterone. The three of them went to the living room to talk. While Lucy and Clara began Marcus went to the shed out back and came back with a hammer, a box of nails, and some boards. &quot;better keep the boards up until we can replace the window&quot; Marcus said as he began to hammer. Lucy told her how she was infected by the lunar ecstasy in a sugar package and how she became a big black were-bull. She then told her about all the events leading up to finding Marcus and the were-unicorn herm in her bedroom. &quot;wait you both male were-beasts?&quot; Clara said. She was worried as not all couples stayed together after something like that. &quot;Yeah but he accepted my new form&quot; Lucy answered. She then told her about the trip here. &quot;as much as I loved catching up we need to find the kids,&quot; Marcus said after putting down the hammer. Nodding Clara tossed them the keys to her car. &quot;I assumed they didn&#39;t check the garage&quot; She hugged her daughter as they said their goodbyes. Once she heard the car door and the garage be forced open she looked out the peephole. She saw them drive down the road.  <br />
<br />
Once they were gone she sighed in relief and pulled down her pants. Her panties did little to hide her most drastic change to her human form. Instead of her vagina with a small cock like her daughters, there was only a seven-inch cock with large hairy balls. Not only was it bigger than her late husband&#39;s but it also looked younger. She might never know this but the were-beast that infected her had a pure version of lunar ecstasy. one that can permanently change parts of the individual like making them young and immortal and making their appearance similar to their were-forms. It would not be just her as some of Vicki&#39;s other victims would find their bodies changed far more drastically than the usual effects of lunar ecstasy. Clara touched her new member and felt a rush of manly hormones enter her brain. She began to jack off as her bush grew thicker and aged back to her prime. She let out a moan as she arched her back and ropes of cum hit the door. &#39;how am I going explain this when they come back&#39;? She thought as she pulled up her pants. They were the baggiest pants she had and she could still see her cocks outline just a bit. Thankfully neither of them had noticed. Something deep down told her this wasn&#39;t going to end anytime soon.</p>
