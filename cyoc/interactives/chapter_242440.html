<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">My tears are dripping on the floor, proving to everyone the despair that I am feeling. I can feel their own mind fighting to keep collected unlike me...<br />
<br />
Myself: &quot;I don&#39;t...*sniff* I... I don&#39;t want to diiiie! *sob*&quot;<br />
<br />
Hadley: &quot;Hey there Vivian... we shouldn&#39;t get ahead of ourselves now... we don&#39;t know anything about what&#39;s happening, so maybe were not in danger! It may be a TV show of some sorts... Or a prank from of our friends!&quot;<br />
<br />
Farim: &quot;I don&#39;t have any friends.&quot;<br />
<br />
Abigail: &quot;You&#39;re not helping!&quot;<br />
<br />
Myself: &quot;Do...*sob* do you really think... that we&#39;ll be okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
Hadley: &quot;Yeah! We just have to stay together, and we&#39;ll be alright.&quot;<br />
<br />
Revand: In any case, crying on our despair can only worsen the situation. Let&#39;s try to keep hope until we at least know what&#39;s going on. <br />
<br />
Trevor: &quot;Yeah... Let&#39;s stay positive!&quot;<br />
<br />
I hugged Hadley, who had kneeled to my side earlier. She seemed surprised at first by my reaction, but she joined my embrace soon after. She is so warm and comforting... We stayed there a moment, until I stop whinning that is. I pulled away and I wipe my tears.<br />
<br />
Myself: &quot;Thank you...&quot;<br />
<br />
*Hehehe! Sorry to interrupt this wholesome moment, but I have an announcement to make!*<br />
<br />
The sudden voice made us all jump out of surprise. It seemes to come from the every directions at once, and from the walls themsleves.<br />
<br />
*Allow me to indroduce myself... even though you all already know my name... It is me, Tristan Shavarom!*<br />
<br />
Hadley: &quot;Tristan?&quot;<br />
<br />
Abigail: &quot;OH! SO YOU&#39;RE BEHIND ALL THIS! WHAT THE HELL DO YOU THINK YOU&#39;RE DOING?!&quot;<br />
<br />
*How dear Abigail... I am simply taking my revenge! An eye for an eye as we say!*<br />
<br />
Trevor: &quot;Who are you? And why would you take revenge?&quot;<br />
<br />
*Haha! Let me explain... Each and every one of you had participated in making my life a living hell! You all are people who deserves to be punished for what you did to me!*<br />
<br />
Revand: &quot;What did we do to you? I don&#39;t recall meeting a Shavarom in my entire life...&quot;<br />
<br />
*Oh Revand... but you did. You did ruin a piece of my life! Don&#39;t you remember? We were in highschool... I was the best one in every single matter in class, always at the top of the class. This could have led me to a prestigious school, followed to my dream job! But no, you came in at this point. You saw me as a target, and it didn&#39;t take long before you bullied me. Asking for my homework, helping you cheat in exams... Only so that my own score fall...*<br />
<br />
Revand: &quot;I... Tsk... I didn&#39;t mean to...&quot;<br />
<br />
Abigail: &quot;Okay but kidnapping someone? Because of mere school score?&quot;<br />
<br />
* Ohoh! Abigail, as fiery as always! I do remember you as well, but do you recall what you did to me? I came at every single one of you concerts, followed you through every single one of your tours... And when I finally had time to talk to you, you dismissed me. As if I was not anything. A mere bug to step on...*<br />
<br />
Abigail: &quot;I can&#39;t respond to all of my fans! Some gets an autograph, and some not! That&#39;s it!&quot;<br />
<br />
Hadley: &quot;You got a fanclub?&quot;<br />
<br />
She has a fanclub?<br />
<br />
Abigail: &quot;Later.&quot;<br />
<br />
*Ah yes! The dear Hadley, oh so pure of heart. She wouldn&#39;t hurt a fly wouldn&#39;t she? She could not do anything wrong or bad right? She couldn&#39;t possibly have taken a crucial place in the hospital, replacing my sister, costing her life WOULD SHE?*<br />
<br />
Hadley: &quot;I... I heard about that girl... But I was pregnant! I couldn&#39;t just...&quot;<br />
<br />
*Was you life at stakes? Would it have cut short if you didn&#39;t get some urgent help? I THINK NOT! But obviously they would prioritize the pregnant helpless woman, than the girl, who had &quot;just a bad cough&quot;!*<br />
<br />
Samilla: &quot;Okay but... they didn&#39;t mean it! They don&#39;t have to get kidnapped over it!&quot;<br />
<br />
*Oh my! How could I forget! The pure and joyful Samilla, always helping the helpless! Or is it really? Maybe she just is as bad as I think of her. Do you all want to know what she did? She took my pride and joy! My imaculate car, that I&#39;ve managed to buy through my difficulties! I was making a first run around town, I was going slowly on the less populated area... When suddenly, a bright pink racecar come crashing into mine! I was unscathed, but I did not have any time to pay for assurances, and now, I was left broke. All my money left at the same time as the other car fled the crime they had just commited...*<br />
<br />
Samilla&#39;s expression went from a smile to worried panic.<br />
<br />
Samilla: &quot;I was in a big hurry! I couldn&#39;t possibly stop! I was just...&quot;<br />
<br />
Trevor: &quot;That is enough! Will you keep monologing all day or let us out already?!&quot;<br />
<br />
*Ah yes... Mr. Madicky himself... That one is easy. I&#39;ve been working hard all my life, ever since I had lost my sister, making my parents abandon me... Moreover, whitout proper education, finding jobs was becoming hard, and I even had lost all my money on a car that didn&#39;t even last a day and travels to see my favorite idol only to be dismissed. Under all this difficulty, I found a light. This little hope that this grand industry of electricity, the Senji industry would hire me was all I had. I did my interview... I was better than the other candidate in every way, I had knowledge, experience, and a good background... But it all went down because my opponent was a woman. A sexy one by the way. This was all it took for Trevor over here to chose the look over the skill.*<br />
<br />
Trevor clenched his jaw, he seemed about to scream.<br />
<br />
*Then we have the quiet Farim. Simple as always, all they did is rob me a while back. No, I&#39;m not kidding. We got a criminal in the room! I had just barely the time to see their face before they jumped out of the window. They took the little I had... I was left with nothing...*<br />
<br />
Farim simply squinted their eyes at these words, maybe trying to recall the actual event.<br />
<br />
*And here we have it. Vivian, the one who shattered completely my world. The one that started it all.  The worse out of any of you!*<br />
<br />
All eyes were on me... The name Tristan did seem familiar... But... wait... It can&#39;t possibly be that right?<br />
<br />
*We were in middle school you see, she was the beauty of my eyes. The pure elegance and grace at which she moved. I couldn&#39;t bring myself to not look at this star! My first and only love... And what a woman you became Vivian! Keeping this same charm that made me flinch... It was on a monday when I decided. I had to tell her, I had to tell her how she enlightened my days, how she radiated in the best of ways... And when I arrived in front of her, my eyes shinning with enticipation... She said no. A simple, striking, heart breaking no. My world crumbled over this word. My whole sight was blurred in sadness.*<br />
<br />
Yeah... I was 13 when that boy came to me... telling me such wonderful things about me. His words were rolling in a ethereal song. I wanted to say yes. I was about to. But... was I really the one he described? I had looked at myself in disgust... I didn&#39;t deserve this praise, this love. He should have given it to someone else, someone more worthy... I didn&#39;t know that this choice would affect me up to this day!<br />
<br />
Myself: &quot;I&#39;m sorry Tristan...&quot;<br />
<br />
*Oh don&#39;t worry! You will have all the time you need to be sorry! It&#39;s probably time that I explain your punishment don&#39;t you think?*<br />
<br />
Abigail: &quot;Shut the fuck up and let us get out of here you psycho!&quot;<br />
<br />
Trevor: &quot;We... We won&#39;t listen to your words! Help will come for us!&quot;<br />
<br />
*No I don&#39;t think so. Not after what will happen here...*<br />
<br />
Hadley: &quot;And... what is that?&quot;<br />
<br />
*Finally an interested! So you see, I&#39;ve recently stumbled upon... How can I say it... Some new ressources! These beauties hold incredible capabilities! I don&#39;t know exactly how they work... Probably some genetic or chemical type of things... But I thought that there were no better way to use them than to finally take revenge!*<br />
<br />
Samilla: &quot;Genetic? Chemical? What&#39;s that all about?&quot;<br />
<br />
*So you see, these items, objects and others have mysterious scientific potential! They have the strange power to transform any human who touches them! The transformation ranges from an additional toe, to a complete change in the genetic code! These are incredible!*<br />
<br />
Abigail: &quot;What kind of delirious bullshit is that? Ain&#39;t no transformation taking place. That&#39;s just crazy talk.&quot;<br />
<br />
*Is it really? You haven&#39;t seen it for yourself yet... Don&#39;t worry, you&#39;ll see soon. Anyway, as I was saying, these transformation could do anything to you! They could change you phisically, psychologically, or even socially, in your relations you know! So it thought of my plan that way: I&#39;m soon going to open that door, it&#39;s when it will begin. You will be able to move freely into a living area especially made for you all! There&#39;s going to be a pool, a garden, multiple dorms, a kitchen etc. The thing is, every single thing in there could be one of the transformative items! And there is no way for any of you to realize it before its too late! I myself don&#39;t even know what will happen to you in there!*<br />
<br />
Myself: &quot;This is crazy...&quot;<br />
<br />
*I know right?! What&#39;s even better, it&#39;s that the changes are irreversible! Unless it is replaced by another change that overlap it! So if you do manage to find a way out, you&#39;ll be changed forever! and whatever recue mission come to find you won&#39;t recognize any of you! This is so exciting!*<br />
<br />
Revand: &quot;There is absolutely no way that this is real. Genetical induction cannot be made by simple skin contact and cannot be this drastic. &quot;<br />
<br />
*Believe what you believe, but once you&#39;re in there, I would be careful If I were you... Any droplet of water, any piece of food, any mundane object, might change your life forever!*<br />
<br />
Trevor: &quot;This can&#39;t be real... I won&#39;t believe it...&quot;<br />
<br />
*Well! I&#39;ll let you think this through for a bit! I&#39;ll open it soon so, be prepared to live a completely normal life in this incredible mansion! With a little twist that is. Ciao!*<br />
<br />
Myself: &quot;We&#39;re in real danger... I... I... *sob* I don&#39;t want to die...&quot;<br />
<br />
Hadley: &quot;... I... I don&#39;t know what to think...&quot;<br />
<br />
Samilla: &quot;This is really weird...&quot;<br />
<br />
Abigail: &quot;I&#39;m gonna find him. I&#39;m going to find him, and make him eat is stupid shitty revenge attempts! I&#39;m gonna kill him!&quot;<br />
<br />
Revand: &quot;There is no way, genetical modification over object contact? There is no way, it needs a chirurigical operations usually! There is no way... There is no way... There is no way!&quot;<br />
<br />
Trevor: &quot;...&quot;<br />
<br />
Farim: &quot;...&quot;</p>
