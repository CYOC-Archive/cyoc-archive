<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">A bright light interrupted Jeff&#39;s blurry field of vision and a horrific crackling sound filled his giant ears as sparks flew from the device. He backed away, startled. The smell of electrical smoke filled his nostrils.<br />
<br />
&quot;What did I just do?&quot; he thought in a panic.<br />
<br />
He looked around when it ended, carefully checking that he hadn&#39;t started a fire. He breathed a big sigh of relief with his big donkey lungs. Then he felt a twitching around his torso.<br />
<br />
The twitching grew into a squirming, and then he felt new parts of himself dangling onto the ground and wrapping themselves around his fur. He had nearly panoramic vision as a donkey, so he could see he the growths that had emerged from his sides, but they just looked like fat blurry masses through his donkey eyes.  &quot;This isn&#39;t normal,&quot; he thought anxiously. Then his whole body and mind froze up as he was splashed with a tidal wave of new sensory information from his strange additions. It turns out they were extremely sensitive, and he could distinctly feel very fine details from every surface any of them was touching, including individual hairs of his fur. For a moment, he thought he had somehow managed to lick the floor, the walls, and himself all at the same time, until he realized that he actually had taste sensors at concentrated locations all along his new masses. &quot;This is REALLY not normal!&quot; said his mental voice, his donkey body still locked up in a stupor as its alien appendages dances around.<br />
<br />
Jeff hawed weakly from the ocean of sensations surrounding his donkey body that he wasn&#39;t entirely in control of. It was like each of his new growths almost had a mind of its own. When he had finally adjusted enough, he mentally counted them: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. He managed to make some voluntary movements, and then he decided he had to see more clearly what had grown out of him. He mentally directed one of them to lean forward, and he brought it close to his right eyeball. The colors were muted, but he could clearly see the suction cups all down the sides.<br />
<br />
&quot;Damn, I&#39;ve got tentacles! Like a fucking octupus!&quot;<br />
<br />
That wasn&#39;t all that happened, though. If Jeff&#39;s new tentacles were sensitive, they were at least rivaled by what was growing out of his head. Long, hard, and crooked, two stick-like monstrosities twirled around above his face. Each movement a pulse of sensation into his skull and a chill down his donkey spine. These were ant antennae. He could almost form a mental image of the room just from the pressure differentials and chemical signatures they were picking up. He smelled the bedsheet fabric, the stuffy indoor air, his own fur, the arousal hormones coursing through his body from his masturbation session. He could even hear through the things, better in fact than even through his donkey ears. His joints cracked inside him, the Chronivac clicked its broken cooling fans, and suction cups on his tentacles popped in both his ears and his long antennae.<br />
<br />
&quot;What is this thing doing to me?&quot; he thought. &quot;What have I done to MYSELF?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff let out a screeching bray when his tail locked up behind him. It became stiff as a board behind him, and then there was a crack as it broke in the middle. Wait, no, it wasn&#39;t a break, it was a joint! He mentally assigned a couple of his tentacles back to check on it, and they reported back to him with the tangy coolness of metal as they wrapped around it. Two prongs opened up on the end as another joint formed. He couldn&#39;t really see it back there, but he didn&#39;t need to. His tentacle senses made very clear that he now possessed a crane-like robot arm in place of his tail.<br />
<br />
That wasn&#39;t about to be the only out-of-place feature on his body, though, because he was about to get one of his old human parts back! He didn&#39;t know what to think at first about the fleshy arm stretching forward out of his chest, but he was both disturbed and slightly relived when it turned out to actually be an arm. He felt five lumps sprout out the end of it which grew out into the dexterity of his fingers which Jeff so sorely missed. He waved his fingers around in front of him in pleasure, smelling their salty, oily skin through his antennae.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m a freak.&quot;<br />
<br />
His wish for better vision was about to come true, but not exactly how he might have wanted. His donkey eyes stayed where they were, but a couple of pits formed on the front of his long neck, which were quickly filled up with something round. He couldn&#39;t identify them at first, but when he tried out a couple of new muscles, his new eyes opened in response, and he immediately recognized his old human vision. His wonderful, lively, colorful human vision! He closed his donkey eyes for a moment just to take it in. He saw the underside of his donkey chin, but he also saw his human hand sticking out in front of him. It was kind of freaky, but it was even stranger when a camera came online between the clamps in his robotic tail-arm, apparently so he could see whatever he chose to grab with it. He waved it around, marveling at the range of motion and his ability to turn it back to face his own chimeric body. He saw his tentacles really clearly for the first time, and then he swiveled the tail arm some more, taking in the full 360-degree range of motion. The light hum of its motors echoed in his donkey ears and vibrated along his antennae. He opened his donkey eyes again and to get the full panoramic view, as he could now see all the way around him: out front with his human eyes, sideways with his donkey eyes, and out back with his robocam.<br />
<br />
&quot;A donkey with a rearview camera,&quot; he thought. &quot;How rediculous.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff was actually kind of relieved now that he had seen (and smelled and felt and tasted) what the broken Chronivac had actually done to him. Sure, he was hideous, but at least he could actually do stuff now. The tentacles were semi-independent but dextrous, the robot arm was precise, and he even had one of his human hands again. Plus, he could actually see what he was doing now, and his other senses were so powerful that he almost didn&#39;t need to see anyway. Maybe, just maybe, there was a chance of fixing the Chronivac and getting himself out of this.</p>
