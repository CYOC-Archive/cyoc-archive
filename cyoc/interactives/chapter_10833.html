<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jim glanced back to the trailer office where Pete was working. He considered for a moment getting him to come with him, but then quashed that idea; he had just turned 20 and didn't want to be portrayed as a wimp who couldn't go into a house at night by himself. Flexing his muscles slightly to comfort himself, Jim walked in through the door frame. <br />
<br />
What sounded like foot steps echoed throughout the house. Jim fumbled through the darkness until he could feel the wall on his left. Quietly, he stalked through the shadows, trying to find the source of the noise. More foot steps from his left. Jim spun around and looked into the room on his side. Empty. Jim wiped his forehead with the back of his hairy arm; his fear was taking hold of him. Shaking slightly, Jim walked into the half-built kitchen. More foot steps, coming from the adjoining room. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hello?&quot; Jim asked unsurely. Nothing answered. Whatever was in the next room, he could hear its breath faintly. As slowly as possible, Jim walked to the side of the doorway. He was now concealed by the wall and ready to pounce through the door and catch whoever was in the next room. Counting slowly in his mind, he prepared to attack.<br />
&quot;3....2...........1!!!&quot; Jim sprang around the corner and began shouting wildly in hopes of startling his opponent.<br />
&quot;Arhhhh!!!........&quot; Jim trailed down confused. The room was empty. He got out of his &quot;fight pose&quot; and looked over the room. No one besides him was there. Shrugging, he turned to leave, when suddenly, something shoved him to the ground from behind.<br />
<br />
Gasping in shock, Jim attempted to get up off the ground, but the attacker had thrown his body on top of him, holding him tightly to the floor. Jim desperately tried to hit whoever was lying across his back, but his hands only fumbled over the assailant's smooth body and down towards his ass. Instead of groping at clothing though, all he could feel was the warm muscular back, and further down was something that felt like a Speedo. His confusion didn't have time to set in though, for within the next few seconds, who ever was holding him down grabbed at Jim's arms, holding them forcibly behind his back. <br />
<br />
&quot;This will just take a second...&quot; a familiar voice sounded from behind Jim. <br />
&quot;Cam?&quot; Is that you?&quot; he asked as he continued to struggle. <br />
&quot;Shhh...&quot; Cameron whispered into Jim's ear. Jim moaned slightly in disgust as he felt what seemed like a boner tucked into a Speedo press against his lower back.<br />
&quot;What are you doing?&quot; Jim asked. Cameron, who was holding both of Jim's arms together with only one of his muscular arms reached forward and ran his free hand over Jim's back slowly through the loose green singlet. Then, Cam gripped the neck hole tightly and tugged it backwards, ripping the singlet down to the bottom of his chest, the waist of the singlet remaining in tact. Jim's back wasn't nearly as defined as Cam's, but Cameron's lust was far too driven to give a second thought; he'd make him better...<br />
<br />
Leaning forward across Jim's back, Cam began to drape his own body around Jim.<br />
&quot;Get off me!!!&quot; Jim pleaded in a half sob. Ignoring his plea, Cameron licked his lips and placed his head directly above Jim's soft neck. Sighing with ecstasy, Cam bit gently into Jim's flesh.<br />
&quot;Arghhhh!!!&quot; Jim cried, but within seconds his cry had faded away as the change began to take form.<br />
<br />
Cameron watched happily as the skin across Jim's back began to tan in the shadows, and his back began to develop muscles that protuded outwards, inviting Cam to touch them. Jim's slightly developed arms grew longer in Cameron's hand, their biceps growing larger and larger. Jim lifted his head and gave a low moan of joy, causing the transformation to continue. Jim's waist expanded as a set of abs pushed forwards, tearing away the thin remainder of his green singlet. Cameron let go of Jim's arms now; there was no going back at this point. He smiled as Jim began to hump the floor instinctively, his shorts tightening to breaking point.<br />
<br />
Cameron lowered his head to greet Jim's ass as it popped through the seam across the rear of the shorts. Jim's black briefs already were mostly red, the soft material was changing to a tighter combination of spandex and as Cam licked Jim's ass through the changing fabric, the black briefs instantaneously morphed completely to a pair of red Speedos. The tattered shorts burst apart as Jim's legs developed muscles speedily. Now, clad only in red Speedo like Cameron, Jim howled into the night, and Cameron joined him as they began to kiss each other and let each other's tongues caress their hairless chests softly. Both of their boners were screaming to ejaculate, but they paused momentarily: they could smell the scent of a straight man close by.</p>
