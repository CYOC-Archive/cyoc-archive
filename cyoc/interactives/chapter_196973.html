<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Maureen formulated a plan. At 7 pm he took a selfie of his face. Going back to this body would be his fall back position. He judged the black eye was fading but wanted a picture to show Liz.<br />
<br />
He then took off the bike shorts and panties. He placed the bike shorts in a plastic bag which he labelled ‘Roger. Black eye’ and placed it in Liz’s wardrobe where she had begun storing other clothing items for potential future use of the medallion.<br />
<br />
As soon as the clock ticked past 7.09 he used the medallion and touched it to some panties he found in a bag labelled. ‘Liz 33 tall C-cup’. Maureen correctly figured this was Liz’s new preferred body. <br />
<br />
30 minutes later Maureen was completely female once more, this time in Liz’s new younger body. She felt gorgeous. She dressed in a red lace cocktail dress and matching heels then did her makeup, before texting her old phone. ‘On my way over to collect more of R’s clothes’<br />
 <br />
She then hopped into Liz’s car and headed back to her own house.<br />
…….<br />
Liz had just sat on the couch next to Roger and was considering how best to entice him to bed early when she heard Maureen’s phone ping back in the kitchen. She ignored the sound and snuggled next to her temporary husband. “I’m feeling much better. Do you think we could have an early night?” She traced her fingers along Roger’s thigh. <br />
<br />
Roger responded “If you think you are up for it, I certainly am” he was amazed at how forthrite about sex his wife had become. In years past she would have used such a severe case of sunburn to abstain from sex for weeks. The change seemed to have happened since that night when Liz stayed around. Maureen had even taken to wearing sexy sleepwear. Roger was not going to complain.<br />
<br />
“I can see that” his wife responded her hand had found his hard penis pushing against his trousers. <br />
<br />
Roger watched as Maureen’s fingers undid his belt and fly and released his member. It sprung to attention. Then with a grin Maureen began giving him a hand job. <br />
<br />
“Should we take this to the bedroom?” Roger suggested.<br />
…….<br />
Things had moved on from the hand job when they heard a car pull up outside. Then the clicking of high heels up the driveway prompted Roger to pull out of Liz mid fuck, muttering “Who the hell is calling around at this time of day” He quickly tried to dress but the doorbell rang as he pulled his trousers on. Liz, stayed on the bed and just pulled the doona over to hide her nakedness.<br />
<br />
Shirt in hand Roger approached the front door “Who is it?”<br />
<br />
“Hi Roger it’s me” Maureen said. Being in Liz’s body it was Liz’s voice that came out of her mouth.<br />
<br />
“Liz? We were not expecting you. I thought you were hiding. You have come at an awkward moment. Give me a minute” He began to button up his shirt.<br />
<br />
Hearing her own voice at the door Liz quickly figured out who the visitor must be. She slipped out of the bed and into the ensuite where she turned on the shower. <br />
<br />
Maureen waited patiently. She was eager to see Roger’s face when he got his first glimpse of the new improved Liz.<br />
<br />
Eventually Roger opened the door. There was Liz looking glamorous in a red dress.<br />
<br />
“Hi Roger. I thought I would drop in and see how the patient is going. As you can see my skin has healed wonderfully. I feel so young” <br />
<br />
Roger’s eyes popped. Liz did look great. The crow’s feet around her eyes were virtually non-existent and her skin looked almost flawless. “Yes you do…” <br />
<br />
Maureen liked that Roger looked flummoxed. She giggled with delight then leaned into Roger “Well aren’t you going to invite me in?”<br />
<br />
“Ah! Of course!” Roger stepped aside to allow Liz in. He heard the shower running. “Maureen is in the shower. I’ll let her know you are here” <br />
<br />
Maureen headed to the kitchen making sure she exaggerated her bum wiggling just in case Roger was watching. “I’ll put the kettle on”<br />
<br />
Roger dashed back into the bedroom opened the ensuite and told his wife “It’s Liz. She has come to check on you” <br />
<br />
The real Liz stopped the water and replied “I heard her. Amuse her for a few minutes. I’ll be out as quickly as I can”<br />
<br />
Several minutes later Liz emerged in Maureen’s bath robe and joined ‘Liz’ and Roger in the kitchen. She figured there was no point being shy about being in Maureen’s body with the real Maureen.<br />
<br />
Liz was a bit taken aback on seeing Maureen wearing her own young enhanced Liz body. She really did look glamorous and sexy. Maureen was in the red dress Liz had worn to a  wedding the previous year. Liz also noticed Maureen was wearing her new black heels. She looked as though she was headed out somewhere. “You caught me by surprise. I was going to visit you in the morning. Are you heading out somewhere?”<br />
<br />
Maureen had not planned on going anywhere else but she did suppose that with Roger present she needed to explain why she was so dressed up. She quickly made up something “I’m meeting a friend for a drink. Thought I would see how Maureen was going”<br />
<br />
“You can see I’m starting to peel” Liz replied. She glared at Maureen. How dare Maureen use her body to go out. Was she meeting that professor again? Liz did not want to get trapped into another relationship. However Roger was in the room and she could thought voice her thoughts<br />
<br />
“Well as you can see my peeling has stopped. My skin is so soft and young looking. I’m sure you will look and feel as good as I do in a couple more days”<br />
<br />
“I certainly hope so” uttered Liz sarcastically. “I hope this treatment is worth the pain”<br />
<br />
“Don’t worry Maureen. I was looking as red as you are a few days ago. Look at me now. My skin hasn’t felt so good in years” Maureen then turned to Roger “Roger would you mind if I had a word in private with your wife”<br />
<br />
“Of course not. I’ll just go to…”<br />
<br />
“No. You stay here. We’ll go to the spare room” ‘Liz’ went to the spare room where she had put the box of Roger’s clothes. The real Liz in the Maureen body followed.<br />
<br />
In the room and with the door shut Liz turned on her friend. “What are you doing here and who is this friend you are meeting?”<br />
“Don’t get your knickers in a knot. I just came over to get some more of Roger’s clothes to try out. I’m not going anywhere else. I just had to explain to Roger why I am so dressed up”<br />
<br />
“Why are you so dressed up? They are $1000 dollar shoes”<br />
<br />
“I’m pretending to be you and you always look good. Did you want me to turn up in scraggy clothes?”<br />
<br />
“I wasn’t expecting you to turn up at all. But since you are here what clothes are you after?”<br />
<br />
“This box” said Maureen as she took the box of her own and Roger’s clothes that had been hidden in the shed for 15 years. “I may as well take the lot”<br />
<br />
“What are you planning to do?”<br />
<br />
“In the morning I’ll try something else of Roger’s. The version I was today was perfect except for the black eye. I’ll show you. I took some selfies” Maureen proceeded to show Liz the photos she had taken of herself when she was in the young Roger body.<br />
<br />
“Wow. It’s easy to forget how much of a stud young Roger was”<br />
<br />
“Yeah. Not that he’s exactly ugly now. But I can vouch his muscles were much firmer 16 years ago”<br />
<br />
“Is the black eye that bad? It’s fading”<br />
<br />
“I suppose that could be our fall back. Having a black eye for a few days is an easy price to pay for being young and fit again”<br />
<br />
“It’s certainly a smaller price than being laid up in bed with horrible sunburn” added Liz.<br />
<br />
“I’ll need some more of Roger&#39;s clothes to wear if I’m successful. I found out your wardrobe doesn’t exactly suit Roger. I was wearing just your bike shorts all day. Undies, shorts and a shirt will do. I won’t be going anywhere”<br />
<br />
The thought of Roger wearing her clothes gave Liz a giggle. She collected the wanted items and added them to the box.<br />
<br />
“Well I’ll collect that box and get going. Roger will be wondering what we are talking about”<br />
……….<br />
The two women came from the spare room with Liz carrying an old cardboard box. Roger quickly hurried across and took it from her “I’ll take that. What’s in here?”<br />
<br />
“Just some old clothes Maureen doesn’t want anymore. I’m giving a load to charity myself and Maureen said she had a few. I can drop them off at the same time as I drop off my own”<br />
<br />
“I’ll carry it to the car for you”<br />
<br />
“Thanks Roger” The apparent Liz turned to her friend “I’ll see you tomorrow Maureen”<br />
<br />
“See you Liz” the real Liz replied.<br />
<br />
Roger carried the box of clothes out to Liz’s Mazda and placed in in her boot. “So where are you off to?” He casually asked<br />
<br />
“The Omega” the real Maureen replied thinking of the first venue that came to mind. “Thanks again Roger”</p>
