<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After Karyn finishes sucking me off, she rolls over onto her other side and starts crying. Maybe I did this all too fast. I reach over to rub her shoulders but that only makes her tense up. I should try to take things slower with her; she is my wife after all.<br />
<br />
I stand up and walk myself over to the sink to clean off my hands and grab a wet towel.  I get back down on the floor next to my wife and touch her shoulder. She tenses up again. &quot;Maybe I was a bit too rough with you for our first day.&quot; She stays mad. &quot;I mean the wish made sure you enjoyed it. So don&#39;t be so mad, this could work out great for us.&quot; I don&#39;t know if she relaxes because I convinced her or if the ring made her but Karyn allows me to touch her again. I wipe the tears off her face and I see her beautiful brown eyes again. &quot;There you go, now let me look at you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Karyn holds her belly in place as she rolls onto her back. She starts to tear up again. My other wish&#39;s effects have definitely kicked in as her breasts are blowing up right before my eyes. &quot;Oh come now, let&#39;s not cry.&quot; I wish her to float and be laid on top of the bed in my room gently. I follow her and crawl up next to her. I get a good look at her new kahongas and they sure did grow. Her apron, already stretched out by her belly, is squishing her massive mams against her chest, finely outlining their swell. Her boobs fill up her top as her cleavage grows up and out of her apron and shirt. Buttons are popping off her white barista polo and I hear a snap as she breaks through her b-cup bra. The apron&#39;s necktie is digging into to the back of her neck, poor thing. &quot;Here let me help you.&quot; I climb on top of my wife and undo the neck. Instantly, her face relaxes some as the pressure recedes. Then I reach behind her hips, untie the back, and toss the apron across the room. With a snap of my fingers, her bra disappears and stops stabbing her sides. &quot;Now doesn&#39;t that feel better?&quot;<br />
<br />
Karen wipes a tear from her face. &quot;Yes it does. Thank you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;See? This isn&#39;t so bad. And I know you enjoyed it too; the wish made sure of it. Let&#39;s just make the most of this.&quot; I gently spread kisses all over her tummy. I can feel her relax under my touch so I know she agrees. &quot;Great. Oh Karen baby, it&#39;s going to be so hot being married to you. Let&#39;s go do something.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Like what?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s go to the mall. We&#39;re gonna need to get you some new clothes and maybe we can catch a movie and grab a pretzel or two.&quot; Karyn&#39;s tummy growls loudly. &quot;Maybe pretzels first then shopping.&quot; I smile and rub her belly. &quot;Sure thing, babe.&quot; I kiss her on the lips and when she opens her eyes, we&#39;re in a booth at the mall food court. She jumps but ultimately stays calm. &quot;That&#39;s gonna take some getting used to.&quot; I climb off her and help her sit up so she can have a proper look around. She rubs her tummy and licks her lips at all of the options. &quot;I don&#39;t think a pretzel or two is going to cover it, is it Karyn?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever been this hungry in my life.&quot; I hold my wife&#39;s hand from across the table. &quot;Well don&#39;t hold back. You need to keep your strength up and this ring will foot the bill.&quot;<br />
<br />
She taps her fingers on her tummy to think. &quot;First, how &#39;bout some nachos with extra everything.&quot; A piping hot tray filled with gooey, spicy, and cheesy chips appears on the table and Karyn goes to town inhaling them. Broken chip crumbs go flying as she crams them into her mouth, some of it landing inside her open shirt. Dripping cheese stains her shirt but she doesn&#39;t even notice and keeps going. A few chips short of finishing the whole thing, she stops to breathe. &quot;I could use a large soda to wash this down with. Orange please.&quot; The ring glows and a tall cup filled with bubbly orange soda appears next to the nachos. Karyn wipes her face off with a napkin and takes a large swig, cutely burping after. &quot;Excuse me. Ooo, do you know what I could really go for? Pizza. With pepperoni, mushrooms, and...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What else?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Its weird but I&#39;m seriously craving pickles. Can you even get that on a pizza?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You can now.&quot; The ring glows and a perfect medium pizza takes its place on the table. Karyn pulls off a slice and chows down. It&#39;s a little strange but she seems to like it. Soon enough she&#39;s going after her third slice. It&#39;s really something to watch her put it all away; she must&#39;ve been starving.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoa! Someone&#39;s hungry&quot; a voice calls out leaving from a vendor. It&#39;s our friend Frank walking with a very pregnant girl. Wait, is that...&quot;Miranda? Is that you?&quot; Miranda is another one of our friends but I hardly recognized her with that big belly grabbing my attention.<br />
<br />
She tosses her hair like this isn&#39;t weird. &quot;You know it. Frank was just treating me to lunch. Can we join you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Karyn takes an uneasy sip from her soda. &quot;Uh sure. Go ahead.&quot; As they slowly walk over, Karyn grabs my hand tightly. &quot;What the Hell Joe? Why is she so big? I just saw her yesterday.&quot; I look around the food court and I don&#39;t know how I could&#39;ve missed a key detail: almost every woman in the place is sporting a large swollen belly. Then it clicks.<br />
<br />
&quot;Remember my wish? It made all women want to get fucked and knocked up, not just you. I guess it changed more than I though it would. Let&#39;s just act normal and see how this plays out.&quot; She nods and Frank finally leads Miranda over and helps her sit down in the booth next to Karyn. &quot;So Karyn, do anything interesting lately?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well Frank and I just got back from the doctor&#39;s office for an ultrasound. We want to be surprised so we don&#39;t know the gender but the baby is healthy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Karyn stops eating, too shocked to take another bite.&quot;You and Frank? He&#39;s the father?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I might be. Karyn doesn&#39;t know for sure. It could be... how many did you say?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Six other guys.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, six other guys.&quot; Holy shit. Six other guys? Karyn stutters &quot;Wow that&#39;s...&quot; I gently squeeze her hand. &quot;... a low number for you. Don&#39;t you normally keep a few more guys in your roster?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah but Frank and I had been getting closer and I let some of the others go to spend more of my time with him. His dick is amazing! I know you&#39;re off the market Karyn but this thing is a monster.&quot;<br />
<br />
Frank blows her a kiss. &quot;But no matter who the father is, I plan on being a good friend and going with her to all her appointments and helping her out around the house.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;...even when I bring home other guys. I don&#39;t know how you do it, Karyn. Just sticking with one guy, not sucking off rando&#39;s when you&#39;re apart. I like Frank alot but the temptation is too... hot.&quot; Miranda takes a deep breath and licks her lips while slowly moving her hand beneath her dress.<br />
<br />
Frank jumps up. &quot;You good Frank?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, it&#39;s just her hormones have her hornier than normal. You know how it is. Miranda, do you need some right now?&quot; If I had a soda I would do a spit take. Oh man, is he serious right now? We&#39;re in public. But Frank doesn&#39;t look embarrassed.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m super horny. Can you cover me?&quot;<br />
<br />
I hear metal clicking, and look down to see Frank undoing his belt and pulling out his dick. &quot;Sure thing, Hon.&quot; God damn that thing is huge, Miranda wasn&#39;t kidding. It&#39;s at least 8 inches and it&#39;s not even hard yet. Frank stands up from our side of the booth and starts pumping it himself to get it up. Miranda swivels in her seat to face the big boy and lifts up her dress to point her baby factory at her supplier. Frank goes faster and I can&#39;t believe I&#39;m watching him get himself stiff but I&#39;m not the only one. Girls walking or waddling by have stopped and are all watching Frank like a piece of meat. Even Karyn is hypnotized and her nipples are hardening through her already strained white polo.<br />
<br />
I admit I&#39;m jealous.<br />
<br />
I get the other women, but Karyn was supposed to want to fuck me. Logic says being so close to the demigod penis has scrambled her brain beyond my wish, but I feel cheated. Karyn&#39;s not actually fucking him but she&#39;s still my wife.<br />
<br />
Frank finally gets to full mast at, I think, 10 inches and kneels down next to Miranda. He carefully spreads her legs wide and lifts them onto his shoulders, like she&#39;s in stirrups. Miranda leans back onto Karyn; she doesn&#39;t fight being apart of their public screw. Frank braces himself and fucks her hard. With each blow, Miranda cries out and plays with her boobs in her hands. And judging from the look on Karyn&#39;s face, she&#39;s enjoying this too and will probably want a turn.<br />
<br />
I am pissed. I look at my ring and decide to make another wish. &quot;I wish I had the most desirable dick in the world. Whenever a woman sees me she instantly gets super horny and will do anything I want to get me inside her. And it will always satisfy them better than any other man ever could so she&#39;ll keep coming back for more.&quot; The ring glows and the magic gets started, I can feel it. And it&#39;s really working. My dick is getting heavier and my jeans are getting pulled tighter in the crotch as the material is trying to stretch to cover my package. But there&#39;s no hiding my new growth. Karyn stops watching Frank and Miranda and turns her head to look at me confusedly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Joe. What did you do?&quot; She tries to get up but I want to enjoy this for a while. &quot;I wish you were six months pregnant with quadruplets.&quot; Like a balloon, her stomach blows up even more, the weight anchoring her to her chair. Her shirt rips as it&#39;s forced to ride up over her tummy, exposing her bare stomach. &quot;Joe! Why did you do that? How am I supposed to move?&quot; A bright purple wheelchair appears next to her as she tries to pull her shirt back down to no avail. &quot;Okay but I&#39;m still mad at you. Why did you add...?&quot; I ignore her complaints and get up and walk over to her, showing her my powerful new organ pressing through my jeans.<br />
<br />
&quot;Does this do it for you? Now you don&quot;t need to fantasize about Frank or any other man&#39;s dick. Because you&#39;re married to the ultimate lover; the King Cobra. This is all you&#39;re gonna need.&quot; I unzip my jeans and the button pops off as it all falls out. Karyn starts salivating. Even Miranda, who is actively getting fucked by Frank, looks over at my package which has pulled my underwear so tight that my balls are completely exposed. Karyn tries to reach out to touch it but instead I help her into the wheelchair.<br />
<br />
&quot;Later baby. But now we have to go pick out some new clothes for us. We&#39;ve both gained some unexpected weight during this pregnancy. Is that okay with you?&quot; I stand next her so my open pants are right next to her face. I scratch the lowest part of my happy trail to get her attention. &quot;Um yeah sure. We sure did grow.&quot;<br />
<br />
I smile knowing I have her now. &quot;Alrighty. You guys enjoy your lunch. See you around Miranda.&quot; Frank nods goodbye as he tries to finish off Miranda. Miranda blows me a kiss. &quot;Karyn&#39;s a lucky woman.&quot; I throw her a wink and she shudders; I guess she orgasmed.<br />
<br />
I wheel my wife away from our friends towards the stores. I get plenty of attention from all sorts of women on the way: enormous belllies, some not showing, some with their tongues down some other guy&#39;s throat. Tons of women end up following us asking for me to satisfy the masses. But I shoot down every offer to fuck...for now. I stop in front of an upscale boutique. &quot;Ladies, ladies. Look you&#39;re all beautiful but I can&#39;t take care of all of you right now. I&#39;m trying to shop for my wife. Maybe some other time.&quot; They all sigh in disappointment but before I push Karyn inside, I blow the ladies a kiss. They all shriek and mob around the boutique&#39;s windows like a bunch of fangirls. This is going to be fun.</p>
