<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Cadet Carter was preparing himself for another day in Hell. He&#39;d been stuck in a nightmare boot-camp for what seemed like months but had really only been less than a week. That first day when they felt so close to freedom seemed like a distant memory... It was a day that brought up a lot of contentions among the ranks. Everyone remembered it a little differently and Cadet Carter would be happy if everyone could just let it go... <br />
<br />
&quot;At least my hair is starting to grow back&quot; Cadet Carter reassured himself as he inspected his appearance in the communal mirror. Brushing his hands against the lengthening stubble on either side of his scalp... &quot;And I&#39;m really starting to fill out!&quot; His arms and pecks had grown swollen and perky and his shoulders had broadened considerably. He was feeling much more confident wearing so little clothing around the others. He&#39;d even challenged the both of his platoon mates to a wrestling match or two. &quot;Looks like all of Cadet Steven&#39;s progress is going to muscle and nothing to hair.&quot; He observed teasingly looking over at his platoon mate. His haircut looked as clean and immaculate as it ever had.<br />
<br />
Cadet Stone was fighting the control tooth and nail but he had only been given very rare chances to work with any level of autonomy. Whenever he was given a chance to carry out orders with any level of discretion, he refused to work. Spending his time instead on vain attempts at escape or passive resistance. Cadet Stevens saw him as a major liability to the harmony of the platoon, but as long as Sir was in charge he was always kept in adequate order. Cadet Carter suspected it has been Sir&#39;s intention to turn the platoon against Cadet Stone to keep him in line, but Cadet Stone didn&#39;t seem to care if his platoon mates suffered because of his misbehavior. He was more concern with the injustice of his confinement. The other cadets were merely pawns of the system, easily ignored.<br />
<br />
Cadet Stevens was becoming more and more entrenched in the Cadet life. He had internalized his mission of making Sir proud, and he was keeping tabs on his fellow Cadets to do it. He&#39;d been finding it impossible to function as a platoon with a Cadet like Cadet Stone. He was becoming the antithesis of order and it was getting to the point that something had to be done.<br />
<br />
The Cadets hadn&#39;t had a single day without the Officer on site since the first day the Cadets began their training, but today they would be unsupervised yet again. The Officer had already left for a day&#39;s long court case at the capital and the Cadets were expected to be on their best behavior. It was going to be a major test of the platoon and each Cadet had their own plans for the event. A plan of order, a plan of anarchy, and a plan of escape. It was going to be interesting.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;d better start getting ready Cadet Stone&quot; Cadet Stevens pleaded. &quot;We need to start construction period soon.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cadet Stone lay on his cot swaddled in his military boxer briefs waiting to be forced back into his stupid uniform. He&#39;d tried wearing the wrong clothes from time to time, but it usually didn&#39;t work. Once he was able to drop trow and prance around in the nude as a form of protest, but once Sir found out about it he could never pull his skivvies down in the communal area again. Eventually as time drew close to construction period his body leapt into action of its own accord dressing him neatly in the dress uniform he so despised. He wasn&#39;t going to put it on himself no matter what happened to him or the other cadets. They used to be his friends, but when his parents forced him to join their platoon they acted like they hated him, and as far as he was concerned he didn&#39;t do anything wrong! Though it WAS hard to remember the details.<br />
<br />
Not long after, the cadets approached the site of their new construction task. It was to be a 30x8x3 foot trench covered by logs that the Cadets would eventually navigate over and under, possibly filled with a few inches of water. Skill wise the task was simple. It was just going to take a lot of work to dig the trench and the excess dirt would need to be spread around evenly. Cadet Stevens and Carter began breaking ground while Cadet Stone looked on impotently as expected.<br />
<br />
&quot;Lets go Cadet.&quot; Cadet Stevens encouraged. This is going to take every man we&#39;ve got.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not interested, Thanks&quot; Cadet Stone replied over dramatically. &quot;Disobedience is the test of free will and all&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This isn&#39;t going to go well&quot; Cadet Carter thought to himself. It already looked like the two were going to come to blows and the day had just begun. Cadet Stevens was FUMING.<br />
<br />
&quot;I see... I see what the problem is!&quot; Cadet Stevens said seething. &quot;We lack a defined command structure. We need a leader and we need subordinates!&quot;<br />
<br />
With that he trudged off to the house without any resistance from the enchantment. Had it been lifted?! Cadet Carter attempted to follow but couldn&#39;t. He tried to flee in any direction but was stuck. How had Cadet Stevens managed to go into the house?<br />
<br />
Cadet Stevens soon emerged from the house, looking empowered and pleased with himself.<br />
<br />
&quot;Did you get it?!&quot; Cadet Carter asked desperately, &quot;Did you take the stone so we don&#39;t have to be Cadets anymore?! Where is it?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s where it belongs, in Sir&#39;s office.&quot; He replied dismissively, &quot;I merely used it to do my part to make you Cadets be what this bootcamp wants you to become. I used it to make Sir proud.&quot;<br />
<br />
It was then that Cadet Carter noticed the rank insignia on Cadet Corporal Steven&#39;s shoulders. He had given himself rank. He intended to take control of the platoon.<br />
<br />
&quot;Cadet Stone&quot; Cadet Corporal Stevens began &quot;The day you arrived you deliberately shirked your responsibilities and left your platoon mates to assemble construction project 1.A on their own. That night you proceeded to break curfew and bore sole responsible for the punishment brought upon this platoon. You were not at the abandoned train yard, you were NOT a civilian, you WERE culpable and entirely in the WRONG! Is that understood Cadet?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sir, Yes sir.&quot; Cadet Stone replied somewhat quietly but internally he did accept what was said as truth. As did Cadet Carter.<br />
<br />
&quot;You will follow all order and proceed to dig this trench is that understood?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sir, y.. sir...... no sir. No SIR!&quot; He grabbed his head in agony the Cadet was compelled to obey but the newly promoted Cadet didn&#39;t quite have sufficient authority to dominate Cadet Stone&#39;s mind.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then you leave me only one option.&quot; Cadet Corporal Stevens replied <br />
<br />
&quot;Cadet Carter, remain here and complete what you can of the project. Cadet Stone and I will be back shortly. <br />
<br />
Cadet Stone is due for a trim.&quot;<br />
<br />
With that the newly minted Cadet Corporal dragged the poor Cadet down the drive and into the distance.</p>
