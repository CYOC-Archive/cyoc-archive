<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Rachel walked in silence alongside her brother, Rob, Megumi, a werefox friend from school, and her cousin, Aaron.  As she gazed at Aaron, memories of their tryst from the previous night welled up in her thoughts and she quickly looked away, her face turning red.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you okay?&quot; Rob asked as he looked at Rachel with a bit of concern on his face.<br />
<br />
&quot;I...I&#39;m fine...&quot; Rachel replied weakly.  Aaron and Megumi looked at her and then at each other.  There was a bit of a frown on their faces as they continued on their journey from their houses to the school.  Rachel made sure to stay on the far side of the group as far away from Aaron as possible.  Even this morning, she couldn&#39;t say what came over her last night and what caused her to behave the way she did last night.  She couldn&#39;t say he raped her, as it was she who approached him, and it seemed more mutual than anything.  There was a part of her that wanted to finish what they started that night, and if it weren&#39;t for the presence of both Aaron and Megumi, she might find herself trying to seduce Aaron again.  It wasn&#39;t too long before the four approached the high school.  Rachel scanned the crowd before she saw a familiar red-headed girl.  &quot;Mel?  Mel!&quot; Rachel called out to her friend who turned around to face Rachel.  The two girls squealed as they gave each other a hug.<br />
<br />
&quot;Rachel!&quot; Melissa called out as they embraced each other.  &quot;Did your dad find you?  I&#39;m so glad that you got home safely.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah...&quot; Rachel said as she looked to the side, &quot;I did get home...um...&quot;  She looked around before speaking softly to Melissa, &quot;Is there a place we can talk...in private?&quot;<br />
<br />
Melissa noticed the worried look on Rachel&#39;s face before asking, &quot;Is everything okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just...let&#39;s not talk here...&quot; Rachel replied as she continued to look around.  Melissa pursed her lips a little before taking Rachel&#39;s hand and led her into the school.  <br />
<br />
The two went to the library.  At this time in the morning, school and study hall hadn&#39;t started yet, and there were few people around to hear their conversation.  Melissa led Rachel to a secluded corner and then started to talk with Rachel.  &quot;Okay, now, what&#39;s wrong?&quot; Melissa asked softly.<br />
<br />
Rachel took a deep breath before starting.  &quot;Um...&quot;  She paused, trying to figure out the best way to ask this question.  &quot;When Trevor made you a werecow...was it by...um...you know...sex?&quot;<br />
<br />
Melissa blinked and looked surprised by the question.  She paused for a moment and then answered, &quot;Well, the night he changed me, we did spend it doing...um...yeah.  My first time changing was after our first round...of...um...&quot; Melissa trailed off as her face turned red.<br />
<br />
Rachel nodded as she asked another question, &quot;How long did it take...after...you know...&quot;<br />
<br />
Melissa took a note of the awkwardness of the conversation, but she swallowed a little before continuing, &quot;From what I remember, it wasn&#39;t that long...maybe a few minutes.  I mean, I had enough time to catch my breath before the changes began.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I...I see,&quot; Rachel stammered.  She looked down at the ground, looking a little embarrassed.<br />
<br />
Melissa took her friend&#39;s hand in hers before she asked, &quot;Rachel?  Did something happen last night?&quot;<br />
<br />
Rachel sighed as she leaned back and answered, &quot;Yeah, something did happen.  Um...&quot;  Rachel paused as she tried to figure out her thoughts and words, &quot;I ended up going to the Tachibana house before going home.  Megumi offered me the shower so I could clean up before going home.  My dad tracked me down there while I was taking that shower.  As I was getting out, Aaron came by to tell me that, but he saw me coming out of the shower.  Next thing I know...and I&#39;m not sure what came over me, I was wrapping my legs around his waist and..um...he started...and I...&quot; Rachel&#39;s face turned bright red as she couldn&#39;t continue her sentence.<br />
<br />
Fortunately for Rachel, Melissa understood what her friend was saying.  &quot;And did he...you know...cum into you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I...don&#39;t think so,&quot; Rachel said as she looked around to make sure no one was listening to them.  &quot;Megumi came in while we were...you know...and I can&#39;t remember what happened next.  All I remember is...feeling really good and I could see his...thing...outside of me, but shooting out his...um...sperm, I think?&quot;  She rubbed her head as she said, &quot;Megumi said she got it out, but I&#39;m just...not sure...if she got it out in time.  If you know what I mean.&quot;<br />
<br />
Melissa noticed the worried look on Rachel&#39;s face and then said,&quot;I think I understand...&quot;<br />
<br />
Rachel sighed and said, &quot;I mean...am I going to be...or am I...a werefox?&quot;<br />
<br />
Melissa turned away for a moment as she thought, &quot;Well, if you were, I&#39;d think you&#39;d be changing by now.  Like I said, when Trevor changed me, it wasn&#39;t long before I became a werecow.&quot;  She took a quick look at Rachel and said, &quot;The fact that you haven&#39;t changed might mean that he didn&#39;t...you know....shoot into you.&quot;  Rachel sighed in relief as Melissa continued, &quot;But, I&#39;ll admit...I&#39;m new to all this too.  I mean, it wasn&#39;t long we were here before dad went all weretiger and I went werecow.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What should I do?&quot; Rachel asked, her eyes looking into Melissa&#39;s.<br />
<br />
Melissa took a breath before replying, &quot;Have you tried visiting the school nurse?  Like I said, I&#39;m no expert at this, but I doubt that you&#39;re the first person this has happened to.&quot;  She looked around before continuing, &quot;Maybe they can give you a test or something.  Or at least help you out.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Rachel said, &quot;I think you&#39;re right.  Maybe I&#39;ll give them a quick visit before going to class.&quot;  Rachel gathered her backpack before she stood up.  &quot;And, um...thanks Mel.  I think I needed to talk with you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Anything for a friend,&quot; Melissa replied as she also stood up from her chair, &quot;And stay safe,&quot; she added before the two of them left the library to go to their morning classes and Rachel to the school nurse.</p>
