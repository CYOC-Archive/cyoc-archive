<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Curt was standing at the far end of the estate in the back yard of the guest houses on a makeshift stage. Pam and her crew were keeping the perimeter secure so nobody would be around to notice what was going on, he doubted anyone would try something, but it was hard to feel like one was being cautious enough given what happened.<br />
<br />
Skyla sat beside him, having been provided a cession for the time being, and it seemed that with how her neck worked while on all fours, she seemed to raise her head taller while seated.<br />
<br />
&quot;Pam has organized those arriving into three major groups; the school, a second group that has less pronounced symptoms but share a motto of servitude, and a third group for everyone else the children hit including themselves, though we&#39;ve scheduled some after time for the mothers of any kids especially babies so they know to raise their children to seek their own path... Since the kids did hit a few infants, young children, and even some adults became kids&quot; she said, maintaining the head maid persona while in front of everyone, &quot;have you thought about what you&#39;d say since this morning?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Kind of... But more like things to think about while using the gun...&quot; Curt started. &quot;I thought about how Anna was worried about relationships being broken up... And I couldn&#39;t help but think that the reason people like Kitty and Susan still had feelings for each other was in part because we didn&#39;t want them broken up... But do kids even know that two girls being attracted to each other romantically is even possible?&quot;<br />
<br />
Skyla sat thinking for a moment. &quot;I don&#39;t know, the rules suggest no, but then again it sounds like a grey area... It seems like something a lawyer might debate.&quot;<br />
<br />
+++<br />
In some abstract space between reality, two ethereal legal teams were looking over whether or not they wanted to set a precedent with regards to the children&#39;s actions.<br />
<br />
&quot;The children&#39;s actions have likely drastically altered at least two couple&#39;s sexualities and/or romantic preferences. A dating couple lost most of their romantic interest in each other when they became dolphins, and one proposing couple was tripped up at the last moment when they became an otter and a weasel; these being the most explicit cases, though we could find more. By all accounts, this should have been considered a breach of the rules,&quot; one voice said, coming from a teal coloured figure.<br />
<br />
A purple coloured figure made a motion similar to a shrug, though more with its hands than its shoulders. &quot;The rule, as stated, is that it cannot force sexual attraction, not that it cannot change the options they&#39;d consider for such things. With the vast number of people already using it this way to open a path that they later walk the hard way, to court someone the old fashioned way, forbidding any changes to sexuality in that sense would be a dangerous precedent to set. Especially given that as things stand, blocking off that possibility entirely will both prevent the scenario the kids caused from being fixed, but also result in many relationships being irreconcilable if the male partner in a relationship is changed, even if users such as Curt would not wish that to be so.&quot;<br />
<br />
A white figure seemed to squint hard into the space between the two, before looking to the purple figure. &quot;By all accounts, you&#39;re right. However, we need a pragmatic solution to cover such scenarios while covering the points brought up against it. The safest option is that all should retain their original preferences along with any additional ones the wielder desires, rather than erasure. This is in line with the desire to prevent more persona deaths, as it allows more options for choice and thus individuality; not to mention that many people would consider their own biologically imposed preferences a limitation; though that may be beyond the scope of our discussion.&quot;<br />
<br />
A dark red flowing figure seemed to &#39;sit&#39;, as if watching events on a world &#39;bellow&#39;. &quot;Implement that idea as a test, if it is considered fine by all users, we leave it as the default. If not, we&#39;ll decide to add the original setting as an upgrade at a later date.&quot;<br />
<br />
The three figures made a nod like motion, and both them and the ephemeral space disappeared.<br />
<br />
+++<br />
<br />
Curt sighed. &quot;Well... Aside from that... I think the three groups you mentioned need a slightly different speech for each... I&#39;d probably need to explain to those from the school fair that I not only that I want them to go back to the way they were, but that doing so is what would make me more happy that way... Maybe also state that it would serve me better to have diverse skills and personalities.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;... And the other two groups?&quot; Skyla asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not sure about the group that became overly loyal... Its possible they got like that because their old lives were empty, but maybe not... All I can think of is to just tell them to take a good amount of time off to figure out what they enjoy outside of serving.&quot;<br />
<br />
Skyla hummed. &quot;Taking the rest of summer off would probably be good for all three groups... The rest of us should also have a vacation as well now that I think about it. You should be wrapping up with your current projects at work, so I suspect this would be a good chance... Though we may have to set up a schedule that keeps a skeleton crew for the estate on board.&quot;<br />
<br />
Curt chuckled. &quot;That would be a good idea,&quot; he said, &quot;as for the third group... I can&#39;t really think of anything other than asking them to think about how much of their life they want to go back to, and of they&#39;re unsure just telling them to merely try so they know if they&#39;d still be happy that way.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That should be fine... I can&#39;t see what more we could do if we overthink it,&quot; Skyla said.<br />
<br />
The two noticed the Lion squad letting Silvy through early, as she walked up to the stage. Skyla sort of wincing as she thought of how she must have looked when Silvy saw her last.<br />
<br />
&quot;Morning Master Evenson,&quot; Silvy said, &quot;it looked like you were saying something important.&quot;<br />
<br />
Curt nodded. &quot;Mostly just trying to figure out what to say... But we&#39;ve figured that everyone also needs a summer vacation.&quot;<br />
<br />
Silvy held a pawed hand to her chin. &quot;I&#39;m not sure if that would be something those from school would be content with... I mean, even if you explicitly told them that you want them to get away from being a maid for a while, they may find themselves drawn to hang around the estate, or even try to follow you to wherever you go for vacation Master Evenson. Though some may justify it as being a good thing to be on hand in an emergency.&quot;<br />
<br />
Skyla&#39;s ears stood to attention. &quot;Hmm... &#39;get away from being a maid for a while&#39;, I said something similar this morning... Maybe you should say that,&quot; she said, looking to Curt, &quot;though I don&#39;t think it would be reasonable to stop them doing either of those things... If they&#39;re not doing work around here, they can easily be encouraged to loosen up by the maids hanging around just to mingle and have fun. We&#39;ve got a pool, and plenty of rooms full of means to entertain themselves.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That said,&quot; Curt started, &quot;if they do come with us, maybe you should come just in case. It would be good for them to have someone who knows them to show them the point of a vacation.&quot;<br />
<br />
Silvy smiled. &quot;I like that idea. Hopefully my parents don&#39;t mind, but based on what I saw from them last night, they seem to be okay with me being... Well... Your servant, Master Evenson. So they might be fine if I&#39;m doing this because you asked, though I imagine they&#39;d want to come along to be sure I&#39;m okay.&quot;<br />
<br />
Curt sighed. &quot;I should make a statement that everyone is to just call me &#39;Curt&#39; until summer vacation is over.&quot;<br />
<br />
Silvy and Skyla both flinched, like it took part of the fun of being a maid away, but as they looked at each other they both sighed and nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now that all that&#39;s sorted, its about time that we deal with the hardest group,&quot; Skyla said, &quot;I&#39;m sure this will be uncomfortable for us... But It will likely be just as uncomfortable for them.&quot;<br />
<br />
With a nod between them, Skyla gave the signal to let the school into the area; a square laid out on the ground for everyone to line up on was there to make it easier to hit everyone with the ray gun; a thought that made them nervous, but it couldn&#39;t be helped.<br />
<br />
The long process began.<br />
<br />
+++<br />
Outside, Kitty was waiting outside the event with Anna, since it was decided that it would be better for Kitty to sit in on the later groups than watch the worst her kids had done. They were not really sure what to talk about, when a thought occurred to Kity.<br />
<br />
&quot;... If the maids were all hit by that ray gun, and some of them were guys once... Would that mean Susan was...&quot; She trailed off.<br />
<br />
Anna&#39;s ear&#39;s drooped. &quot;That&#39;s my fault... I zapped him, and I&#39;ve been regretting it ever since I found out he had something like a girlfriend, since it might have taken away the chance for you two to... You know.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kitty sighed, but followed it up with a smile. &quot;Its fine... I barely understand any of this, and yet I&#39;ve been surrounded by it for... My whole life I guess... I just... Do I join her? I don&#39;t even know how this mind control would even feel, so I don&#39;t know what she&#39;s going through. Would I be closer to her if I did?&quot;<br />
<br />
Anna&#39;s eyes widened. &quot;Not the questions I thought you&#39;d be asking.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kitty shrugged. &quot;Well, what did you expect... Between the growing magic in this world and the pace of science, reproduction should become a non-issue... Eventually,&quot; she said, &quot;though... Maybe why you&#39;ve been using it would be nice to know. I&#39;ve heard from Skyla what she and Master Curt have been using it for, but what about you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... Mostly I used it on people I didn&#39;t think had any choice, aside from Susan I mean... I went to an old person&#39;s home to save a few people from old age, I helped fix my friends&#39; brains that were... Well... And then there&#39;s Cassidy, who... I&#39;m sure you can guess.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kitty nodded, and looked off into the distance.<br />
<br />
+++<br />
Simone was pouting, overlooking the whole estate from the roof of the mansion, not really sure what was going on. Whatever insanity had happened last night had dragged Master Curt away long enough that she couldn&#39;t remind him of her recital. It wasn&#39;t a big deal, at least she tried to tell herself that, but with whatever official business taking up his time, she couldn&#39;t stand the impatience welling inside her. Especially given how she was being left out.<br />
<br />
Suddenly she heard and practically felt someone land next to her, turning to see a twin tipped tail over one side of her shoulder, and turn the other way to see Sophie.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, hey... I was just... Uh...&quot; She started.<br />
<br />
&quot;Eavesdropping?&quot; Sophie said, &quot;same, they called me to listen to them in the third set, and so far the first one sounded like a funeral, while the second is starting to sound like a guidance councillor meeting... Not that I&#39;m allowed to tell you what they&#39;re actually saying.&quot;<br />
<br />
Simone looked away. &quot;Would it be shameful for me to say that&#39;s a relief? That it makes me feel better that they&#39;re not leaving their princess out of a fun event; that they&#39;re trying to spare me some kind of grief?&quot;<br />
<br />
Sophie giggled. &quot;What&#39;s the alternative? Wishing you knew what they were grieving over so you could be closer to your crush?&quot;<br />
<br />
Simone blushed. &quot;When you put it that way...&quot;<br />
<br />
Sophie let out a much louder laugh. &quot;Its so amusing seeing another mythic wondering the same things I did at their age. You probably know as much about sex as your class mates, and yet your body is more naïve about it than you can imagine.&quot;<br />
<br />
Simone continued to blush, scrunching her face up a little, only to sigh. &quot;I guess so... But its not because I&#39;m mature or anything.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sophie just smiled. &quot;Spoken like a true princess of any age,&quot; she said, &quot;that said, I forget which day it is... Was it Sunday or Monday?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sunday,&quot; Simone said, &quot;if I don&#39;t remind Master Curt by the end of today, I won&#39;t be able to see him on Monday since... School... And if I don&#39;t remind him myself, he may get swept up in his &#39;duties&#39; to the rest of us.&quot;<br />
<br />
The two turned as the second group seemed to finish and the third was being funnelled in. Sophie shrugged at the idea of going in and continued talking.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll be able to catch him once he leaves, or even some time after,&quot; Sophie said, &quot;I overheard Skyla&#39;s plans for her, Master Curt and Anna outside of this confidential meeting, she&#39;s mostly just planning a massage today. There&#39;s also talk of everyone getting a vacation soon, and she seems to be treating it as a vacation from herself.&quot;<br />
<br />
Simone laughed. &quot;What is a vacation from one&#39;s self even supposed to mean?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess it would be like you getting away from the day to day stresses of being a princess,&quot; Sophie said, &quot;and before you say being a princess has never been stressful, just wait until the queen is hung over, the king has gone missing, the prince is leading the charge, and you&#39;re the only one keeping the court together.&quot;<br />
<br />
Simone looked down. &quot;When you put it like that...&quot; She noticed the meeting in the back of the estate seemed to be wrapping up, there was only a handful of mothers and children left. &quot;... Speaking of duty, aren&#39;t you supposed to be down there?&quot;<br />
<br />
Sophie gave a cheeky grin. &quot;I&#39;m pretty sure I only have to listen, besides, I already knew what this was about. Though, I&#39;m sure you won&#39;t tell them I was up here instead of down there.&quot;<br />
<br />
Simone sat up straight, holding as regal a pose as she could muster. &quot;Only if you don&#39;t tell them I&#39;ve been speaking so casually with you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sophie winked, and with a quick motion she slid off the roof and was long gone before Simone could even track where she went.<br />
<br />
&quot;How does she do that?&quot; Simone asked nobody in particular.<br />
<br />
+++<br />
Curt and Skyla walked away from the speeches with both feeling sick and in pain, Skyla from feeling the dull throb of magic that close up, and Curt from having to speak loud and clear for close to half an hour.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t think anyone should have noticed the magic from the ray gun back there,&quot; Skyla said, &quot;it might have been since we had it on aware the whole time, or the fact they barely changed physically this time... But it wasn&#39;t as bad as with the school.&quot;<br />
<br />
Curt lay against the side of the side of the building, his throat parched from the speeches, and even worse from the hot weather. &quot;Remind me never to become a politician,&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
He saw a bottle of water lower down into view, and looked up to see Simone hovering above him. He took the bottle and gulped it all down in a quick motion.<br />
<br />
&quot;I hope you weren&#39;t out there telling us all you&#39;re dying,&quot; Simone said.<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; Curt said, &quot;even if I was it wouldn&#39;t be for... I don&#39;t know... Sixty to a hundred years?&quot;<br />
<br />
Simone smiled. &quot;I hope you live even longer, I can&#39;t just let you slip away the moment I&#39;m old enough to claim you for myself,&quot; she said, &quot;and knowing you, you&#39;ll find a way. After all, you&#39;re going to find a way to be like me won&#39;t you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Curt grinned. &quot;I&#39;d like to see someone stop me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Simone made a little girly squeal before composing herself. &quot;... And um... My recital... Tomorrow, I wanted to remind you,&quot; she said blushing.<br />
<br />
Curt&#39;s eyes widened. &quot;Oh yes, I&#39;ve been meaning to ask what time it was.&quot;<br />
<br />
Simone smiled. &quot;Its not until six in the evening, you shouldn&#39;t have to skip work to get there in time,&quot; she said, &quot;also... I heard rumours of a vacation... Is that true? When is it? Where would we be going?&quot;<br />
<br />
Curt gave a look to Skyla, who sighed. &quot;From the sounds of it, after your recital would be the earliest, but given most of the schools wouldn&#39;t have closed for summer break until next week... I think Friday night or Saturday morning works,&quot; Skyla said.<br />
<br />
Simone nodded. &quot;I&#39;ll be there, and I&#39;d like to see anyone keep this princess from you,&quot; she said before flying off.<br />
<br />
Curt and Skyla stood there watching Simone fly off, and for a moment there was silence.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know...&quot; Skyla started, &quot;you could become a male dragon if you made your parents dragons... But then you&#39;d be physically eight or so if Simone is anything to go by, and then... We&#39;ve already had to think a lot about the other complications already, but would it make you too young to have dated Meredith?&quot;<br />
<br />
Curt sighed. &quot;I know... Though I can&#39;t exactly put this whole thing off till I&#39;m older, my parents won&#39;t live forever either if we don&#39;t do it, nor would my grandparents,&quot; he said, &quot;that said, I might have had to wait until my parents came to visit, or I went to visit them to try it... But there were upgrades to the Ray.&quot;<br />
<br />
Skyla&#39;s eyes widened. &quot;Don&#39;t leave me in suspense here, go on,&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
Curt opened up the messages, and passed the ray gun to Skyla, who grabbed it in one of her tails. Reading the message, she blinked. &quot;I mean, this splash mode might not work on you directly, but it might work through you... Or failing that, it might work through Anna.&quot;<br />
<br />
Curt sighed. &quot;May as well test it on me first, if I&#39;m going to risk anyone to test this then it may as well be myself.&quot;<br />
<br />
Skyla carefully adjusted the settings with a paw, making sure to have images of colourful dragons going through her head, and thinking about Curt&#39;s parents and grandparents as she aimed with her tail. &quot;I hope you know what you&#39;re doing...&quot;<br />
<br />
 Curt closed his eyes as Skyla pulled the trigger... And then...<br />
<br />
+++<br />
<br />
Around the same time, another newly minted young pink dragoness wearing a nurse styled maid outfit was throwing up clear fluid into some bushes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh god... Now I know why I became a teenager instead of a child,&quot; she said, &quot;I should be like... Six? Eight? Ten at the most.&quot;<br />
<br />
Anna happened to be walking by, having left Kitty to talk to her kids, and she overheard this and walked over. &quot;What happened?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I have to be pregnant,&quot; the nurse dragoness said, &quot;I was an adult when I took him in the old reality, but... Let&#39;s not think about how old I was in this one.&quot;<br />
<br />
Anna gaged as she realized the implication. &quot;Yeah... No, let&#39;s not... You feeling better now?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A little,&quot; the nurse said, &quot;I don&#39;t think I can do anything but lay the eggs, if I go to anyone else I&#39;d probably ruin either my co-worker&#39;s reputation or my own.&quot;<br />
<br />
Anna&#39;s ears folded back. &quot;Okay... We&#39;ll help you though, we&#39;re basically family now, like it or not.&quot;<br />
<br />
The nurse smiled. &quot;Thanks... And... My name is Pearl, though maybe I&#39;m not the only girl named Pearl you&#39;ve met.&quot;<br />
<br />
Anna giggled. &quot;I haven&#39;t met as many as you&#39;d think.&quot;<br />
<br />
+++<br />
Wanda and Gia were having an awkward moment as they snuggled together on a sun bed out near the pool of the estate. Wanda trying to find the right words.<br />
<br />
&quot;Gia... I... I feel like I messed up,&quot; Wanda said.<br />
<br />
Gia smiled and rubbed her body against Wanda. &quot;Its okay, we were interrupted by two kids with a magic gun, its in the past... But if you&#39;d like to continue from where we left off...&quot;<br />
<br />
Wanda pulled out a ring from within her maid dress. &quot;Will you... Marry me?&quot;<br />
<br />
Gia grinned. &quot;Yes, as many times as it takes. Even if we loose this chance, I&#39;ll be with you again and again until it sticks,&quot; she said, &quot;... though if we need a father for our children, Jax is still a good option.&quot; <br />
<br />
Wanda giggled, and pushed her muzzle to Gia&#39;s in a kiss, their jaws locking together as they were cooled of by the spray coming from the two dolphin girls in the pool.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know, you could have proposed to me,&quot; one dolphin said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Doubt we&#39;ll get another chance, unless you know a guy who makes rings for these,&quot; the other said pulling her arms out of the pool.<br />
<br />
Both Dolphins laughed at their joke, making lots of dolphin click noises as they did.<br />
+++<br />
<br />
Skyla stared down at Curt. &quot;You can open your eyes now,&quot; she said.</p>
