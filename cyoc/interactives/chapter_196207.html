<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Edna&#39;s attention was grabbed by the sound of an argument.  An older woman was berating a young person working at the A&W counter about something or other.  &quot;What a witch!&quot;, she thought.<br />
<br />
She decided the woman would be the perfect test subject.  Would making her smaller make her appear younger as well?  There was no logical reason to think it would, but it was worth testing.  There was the problem of disintegrating the woman&#39;s clothing, but Edna had already worked out how to avoid that from happening, at least.  Making some adjustments to her device, she waited for the bitter old crone to sit down at a table with her (unfairly comped) food.<br />
<br />
The lady took out a newspaper and began reading as she ate.  Edna used a magazine to conceal her actions.  She kind of regretted now making the device look like a toy ray gun, but it had amused her at the time.  Ah well.<br />
<br />
The woman looked to be roughly 5&#39; 8&quot;.  She set the device for it&#39;s lowest setting, 1% reduction in mass, so she could slowly shrink the woman, and hopefully she wouldn&#39;t notice immediately.  The morning sun shining through the skylights was brighter than the flash of the device, at such low intensities.  She fired.<br />
<br />
Losing 1.4 pounds wasn&#39;t going to make much of an impact, so she was careful, only firing every few minutes or so.  The woman&#39;s clothing must be getting looser, but she didn&#39;t seem to notice.  Was her hair getting darker?  She couldn&#39;t be sure.<br />
<br />
The woman continued to dwindle, and she started to push back her sleeves absently.  Yes, her hair -was- getting darker!  Amazing!  The woman was noticeably smaller by this point, her feet no longer touching the floor as she shuffled in her seat.<br />
<br />
Then there was a loud -thunk- as one of her shoes fell off her foot, hitting the floor!  The woman looked down, and gasped, not understanding what had happened to her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oops, I went too far&quot;, Enda realized, frowning.  However, rather than screaming or making a fuss, the woman got up from her seat, slipped her tiny foot back into her shoe, and made her way for the restroom.  Her dress hung on her loosely, and Edna guessed her height to be close to 5&#39; tall.  Her hair was almost fully black now, and as she rushed by, it was obvious her wrinkles had faded, making her look to be in her early 30&#39;s.<br />
<br />
Edna got up and followed after her, at a discreet distance.  She fired a few more shots at the woman as she followed her, before the woman vanished into the door to the lady&#39;s restroom.<br />
<br />
Edna waited a few minutes, and slowly opened the door.  Slipping inside, she saw the woman staring at her reflection in a mirror in shock.  She had slipped off her shoes and it was obvious she was just under 5&#39; tall (still taller than Edna herself), and she looked to be in her late 20&#39;s.  She wondered how far this could go.  Would a sufficiently shrunken person regress to infancy, or just become a very tiny child?<br />
<br />
She really wanted to find out, so she turned the intensity of the device up to 50%.  She fired, and the woman gasped as she rapidly shrank, until her clothing looked like a tent on her.  At this point the woman wailed.  <br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s happening to me?!&quot;<br />
<br />
Edna walked up to her, and the woman...well, girl, now, looked up at her, her eyes wide and frightened.  She was really pretty at this age, and was no taller than a six year old, though she seemed older than that.  &quot;I&#39;m afraid that I&#39;m happening to you.&quot;  She grinned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Make it stop!  I&#39;m too little!&quot;  The woman pleaded.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m afraid I can&#39;t do that.  I can&#39;t have you telling people about this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I swear, I&#39;ll leave, I won&#39;t tell anyone!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mhm.  I don&#39;t think I can trust that.&quot;  She fired again.<br />
<br />
The girl shrank to the size of an 18 month old, though there didn&#39;t seem to be any other physical change.  Interesting.  So the youngest someone could get was late childhood.  Another blast reduced her to the size of a 2 month old, who was now bawling, struggling to cover herself.  Another shot, and she was now the size of a preemie.  She fired again, and again, until the girl was mere inches tall.<br />
<br />
She picked the girl up, who was screaming, but at her height, she didn&#39;t have much volume, and her high pitched voice was amusing to Edna.  &quot;Quiet, or I&#39;ll make you the size of a bug.&quot;  <br />
<br />
She girl flinched, and instead started whimpering quietly.  A quick adjustment to the device, and she was able to make the woman&#39;s clothing become nothing more than some frayed threads.  &quot;Now, what to do with you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Edna took the girl into a stall, and sat down, thinking.  Then she remembered one of her earlier attempts at revenge.  It was an app on her cell phone that could hypnotize people!  Unfortunately, it would require them to listen to it for some time before it would work, which is why she&#39;d begun work on the size changer.<br />
<br />
Putting her earbuds in (so she wouldn&#39;t hypnotize herself), she held the phone next to the tiny girl and started the app.  Frequencies inaudible to humans were then emitted from the phone, and soon the girl became still (all while Edna was listening to some Pink Floyd).<br />
<br />
About an hour later, the app switched off, and she held the girl up to her eye level.  &quot;Who am I?&quot;<br />
<br />
In her tiny voice, the girl replied.  &quot;My Mistress.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And what is your purpose?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;To do whatever you ask.&quot;  The girl answered.<br />
<br />
Perfect!  <br />
<br />
&quot;What is your name?&quot;  Enda inquired.<br />
<br />
&quot;Rachel Morgan.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hm.  No, your new name is Rei.&quot;  She smiled, thinking of one of her favorite anime characters.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Mistress, I am Rei.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You will forget your old life, though you will retain anything you have learned.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rei shook her head, but then looked to face her.  &quot;I obey.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright Rei.  I&#39;m going to make you smaller and put you in my bra.  Hold on, so you don&#39;t fall, ok?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Mistress.&quot;<br />
<br />
Edna shrank the girl even tinier, and put her between her breasts.  Rei obediently clung to the material of her bra.<br />
<br />
Edna then exited the stall and went back to her locker.  Now if she made Rei about her size, she could shrink and try on her new outfit, and be accompanied by her &quot;older sister&quot;.  This was going to be fun!</p>
