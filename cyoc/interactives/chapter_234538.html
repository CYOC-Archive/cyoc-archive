<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After wearing that security guard uniform, Alex turned into a manlier version of himself. He&#39;s only 12 years old, so after his transformation he looked around 25 or 30 years old. He got huge muscles, long limbs, over 6&#39; in height and a copious amount of body and facial hair.<br />
<br />
It seems he didn&#39;t remember his past life as a kid and, after he noticed Sophie&#39;s presence at the surveillance room, he used his deep manly voice to ask her to leave. Sophie start crying, she can&#39;t believe what&#39;s happening. The magic transformation was shocking but Alex&#39;s change of attitude was worrying her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alex, it&#39;s me! Sophie! We&#39;re siblings!!&quot; She desperately cried while he pushed her out of the room. &quot;I&#39;m sorry, young lady. You&#39;re too young to be my sister. And my name is not Alex. You can call officer Duncan. If you&#39;re lost I suggest you to go to talk to the receptionist. She could help you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Officer Duncan took her out of the surveillance room and then he closed the door. Sophie stood there a few minutes, wondering what to do. It&#39;s obvious that uniform did something to his brother. He doesn&#39;t even consider himself the same person. So, she went back to her room to organize her thoughts.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, the former Alex was trying to retake his job when he realized that he wasn&#39;t properly dressed. Of course, he&#39;s wearing his uniform shirt and pants that he proudly keep clean and ironed. It was getting tight but it was because he was getting bigger. Besides his job, his muscles were his only other occupation.<br />
<br />
&quot;What I was thinking when I dressed like this?&quot; He wondered when he noticed that under his uniform there were tattered kid&#39;s clothes around his muscles. Even his briefs were constricting his waist and his privates. And he felt embarrassed when he realized that he&#39;s totally barefoot.<br />
<br />
As he remembered he used to do, he looked around to see that no one is around and he began to undress. He preferred to go commando that keeping those constricting fabrics on him. He closed the door&#39;s lock and then he proceeded to take his pants off.<br />
<br />
&quot;I must consider shaving down there...&quot; He told himself and then he wondered why he said that. He had never shaved his legs before, that&#39;s not what a man does. Then, why was he thinking that? &quot;My feet are huge, I wondered what foot size I am.&quot; Another weird thought crossed his mind and more were coming.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s happening to me?&quot; He asked while he hold his head confused. It&#39;s like his mind was mixing his thoughts with the ones of another guy. Someone quite different from him. He was getting a headache so strong that he quickly took all his clothes off and stood there naked for a while waiting his pain subdued.<br />
<br />
After several minutes walking around with confusion. His mind finally calmed down. &quot;I&#39;m not a security guard. My name is not officer Duncan. I&#39;m Alex and I&#39;m just a guest at this hotel.&quot; He said aloud while he stood there watching at the uniform he dropped at the ground. &quot;What&#39;s going on?&quot;<br />
<br />
Alex looked around and realized that he was alone at the surveillance room. He can&#39;t remember how he got there, but he remembered he was with his sister, so he decided to look for her. He made a step forward when he noticed something else. Something even more shocking that his brief lost of memory.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m naked!&quot; He shouted in surprise. But not just because he wasn&#39;t wearing anything, he shouted when he noticed that his body was completely different from what he remembered. All those muscles and hair were foreign to him, he was humongous in every place and it was shocking him right now.<br />
<br />
&quot;What happened to me?!&quot; He shouted and he realized his voice was a very deep bass. Completely different of what he&#39;s used to. &quot;I&#39;m huge! I&#39;m older and bigger and stronger!!&quot; His voice had a mix of panic and surprise that made hard to conclude how he&#39;s feeling right now. &quot;I can&#39;t go out looking like this!&quot;<br />
<br />
He quickly explored every corner of his new body, taking out the tattered clothes remaining around his body while he rubbed his thick muscles and the copious hairs on them. &quot;I&#39;m a furball.&quot; He said while his hands moved down from his chest to his crotch. &quot;And this is my dick now? It&#39;s ridiculously huge!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I need to find Sophie, she could know something about what happened to me.&quot; He told himself. &quot;But I can&#39;t go out naked. Even less with a body like this. I need to find something to wear.&quot; He looked around and noticed the uniform on the ground, and next to it a box of lost and found clothes...</p>

What&#39;s he going to do?</h3>
