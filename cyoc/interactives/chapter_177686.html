<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Hi guys, this story is based on another idea that was sent to me. Hope you like it :)</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Hello there my dears,” Vicky said as she lifted the lid off the glass terrarium in front of her, “how are you two feeling? Is my therapy making you feel any better?”<br />
<br />
From where you were standing you couldn’t see who or what Vicky was talking to. The walls of the terrarium weren’t see-through, which meant that you had to move closer to look down on whatever, or whoever, lived inside. <br />
<br />
Greeting you was a rather elaborate set-up. The terrarium was split into two compartments by a transparent glass screen that ran down the middle. You also realised that the four walls were lined with mirrors, which explained why you weren’t able to see in from the outside. However, by far the main attraction were the animals being housed inside this container. In one compartment lived about a dozen scuttling cockroaches, while the other contained a writhing mass of long, slender garter snakes!<br />
<br />
“How are you doing Fiona,” Vicky said towards the cockroaches, “I see that you are getting comfortable with your new body.” As Vicky said this you peered in to get a closer look at who she was talking to. You figured you soon had an answer when you saw two of the insects sat together, with one on top of the other. Seeing this made you feel uneasy as you suspected that at least one member of the couple was once human and, more worryingly, that they were currently busy mating right in front of you!<br />
<br />
“Ooo I bet that feels good dear,” Vicky said with a sinister grin, “however, once you are finished I think you ought to have a break. After all, I mustn’t let you get too worn out before I show you the little surprise I have planned for you!” After this, you heard a distinct chittering cry coming from one of the mating cockroaches. However, this only lasted for a few fleeting moments before the insects’ coupling seemed to reach its conclusion.<br />
<br />
Another screech rang out from inside the glass terrarium as the female cockroach was presumably pumped full with her mate’s semen. Following this, the male cockroach promptly scurried away, after which a few of the other insects appeared to surge towards the motionless female. <br />
<br />
“Sorry boys,” Vicky said as she darted in to extract the freshly-bred female cockroach, “you’ll get Fiona back soon. Now though, I think she deserves a break; after all, such intense psychological conditioning really can take its toll on both the body and the mind if left unchecked.” <br />
<br />
Listening to this made you feel nervous. Hearing Vicky mentioning words like ‘therapy’ and ‘psychological conditioning’ set alarm bells ringing in your head, as you suspected that ‘torture’ was a more accurate description of what Vicky was inflicting upon her victims.<br />
<br />
You continued to dwell on this as Vicky brought the stunned cockroach out of the terrarium and placed her on a nearby table. “There you are Fiona,” Vicky said as she loomed over the terrified insect, “ now you wait here while I try to fetch your husband…”<br />
<br />
This made you snort loudly as you nervously followed Vicky’s gaze over to the writhing mass of snakes in the terrarium’s second compartment. “Now where are you?” Vicky said as she scanned over the thirty-or-so garter snakes, many of whom seemed to be locked together into one single mass.<br />
<br />
“Ah ha!” Vicky said as she finally found what she was looking for. She then proceeded to plunge her hand deep into the ball of snakes and pull out her quarry; or, at least she tried to do that. Instead, Vicky brought up two snakes, one of which was firmly entwined around the other. Based on Vicky’s chuckle you already knew what they were doing, even before she pointed out the male’s hemipenes as they sank into the female’s scaly cloaca.<br />
<br />
“Oh my Jemma,” Vicky said as she held the two snakes up for you to see, “it looks like you are also starting to acclimatise to your surroundings. Don’t worry, you will be placed back in your ball of loving mates before too long. Before that though, I think you and your wife deserve a hard-earned break...”<br />
<br />
You snorted in disbelief when Vicky said this. You stared at the female snake in Vicky’s arms and instantly saw a look of horrified human intelligence etched across her scaly face. She seemed utterly terrified as she struggled uselessly in the stronger male’s grip, even as he continued to press forcefully into her cloaca. Whatever ‘therapy’ techniques Vicky was using clearly haunted the former-man, as she now looked at you pleadingly, hoping desperately that you could somehow make it stop.<br />
<br />
Sadly, you knew you were powerless to act while Vicky was watching. You knew that trying to help the unfortunate snake or her wife would likely fail; and would thus only result in further punishments for all of you. With this in mind, you felt terrible as you just stood still and watched the snakes building towards their inevitable climax.<br />
<br />
The mating finally concluded a few moments later as Jemma let out a long, passionate hiss of acceptance as her whole body started to twitch and jerk within her mate’s coils. Vicky then made sure you had a good view as she brought the two snakes even closer to you. This allowed you to see everything in grizzly detail as the snakes shuddered together, before a powerful wet spray shot out of the female’s cloaca.<br />
<br />
Vicky laughed as the female garter snake trembled in both disgust and unwanted delight. However, Vicky quickly returned to business as she untangled the male snake and placed him back with his friends. Following this, Vicky carried Jemma over to where the female cockroach was sitting on the nearby table.<br />
<br />
“Right Princess,” Vicky said proudly, “allow me to properly introduce you to Jemma and Fiona; two of my most promising patients to date!” In reply, the snake and cockroach hissed and chirped respectively as they looked at each other with sad expressions on their faces. <br />
<br />
“Go on,” Vicky said in mock kindness, “why don’t you two have a little reunion while I tell Princess your story?” <br />
<br />
Following Vicky’s suggestion, the cockroach and garter snake continued to call out to each other in their new animalistic languages as they slowly crept towards each other. You couldn’t help feeling bad for the couple as Jemma started to flick her forked tongue out over her wife’s face in a clear expression of their love for one another.<br />
<br />
“Aren’t they sweet?” Vicky said as the tragic couple continued to nuzzle and rub against each other, “the poor dears were so scared and lost as humans, I think their new bodies suit them much better.” Upon hearing this, the snake and cockroach both called out to Vicky in protest. However, when Vicky answered with a threatening glare, the couple quickly quietened down and resumed their sad reunion with one another.<br />
<br />
“As I was saying,” Vicky continued, “Fiona and Jerry were both quite pathetic individuals when I first met them a few weeks ago at the Zoo. I overheard them both arguing about which exhibits they outright refused to visit. It seemed that Jerry had a terrible fear of snakes after he was bitten and nearly killed by one as a child. He simply refused to go anywhere near the reptile house, since apparently even the sight of a snake would cause him to have a panic attack. As for Fiona, she seemed to feel the same way about insects, though she had a particularly acute phobia of cockroaches after they once infested her family home.”<br />
<br />
Hearing this made you feel ill as you looked down at the two terrified animals on the table. You could only imagine what Fiona and ‘Jemma’ were currently feeling, now that they had become the very creatures of their nightmares.<br />
<br />
“After hearing their distress,” Vicky said upon noticing your reaction, “I went over to try and help them overcome their fears. However, both of them just spat at my kindness as they told me to ‘get lost and mind my own business.’ I persisted, but that just earned me a tirade of abuse from the two of them. That’s why, after following them home, I decided to carry out a more dramatic procedure to help them overcome their fears!”<br />
<br />
With that, Vicky picked up the terrarium where Jemma and Fiona lived and tilted it so that you could see into it more clearly. Inside, the snakes and cockroaches continued to move around impatiently, presumably because they were already missing their female companions.<br />
<br />
“Here we are,” Vicky said proudly as she looked into the terrarium, “this whole set-up is designed to help my two patients quickly overcome their phobias. The mirrors on the wall are there to let Jemma and Fiona study their new bodies and to hopefully learn that they never had anything to fear from the species they are now a part of.”<br />
<br />
“Furthermore,” Vicky said giddily, “I also thought it would be important to let my patients interact with others of their kind. Generally, the most powerful form of interaction between two individuals comes from sex, which is why both of them have been supplied with a healthy number of mates to keep them company. As a matter of fact, all of the animals that Jemma and Fiona live with are male, which means that they are almost always being mated, and are thus constantly learning to appreciate how loving and compassionate their supposedly-terrifying suitors are.”<br />
<br />
Listening to all of this made you feel nauseous as you looked at the writhing mass of snakes and the scuttling group of cockroaches. You could only imagine how horrific it would be to live in these conditions, even if you didn’t have an innate fear of your new lovers. Worryingly however, Vicky seemed to feel the exact opposite. She licked her lips eagerly as she looked down at the males slithering and scurrying around the terrarium, clearly already anticipating putting Fiona and Jemma back in there with them. <br />
<br />
“Right then you two,” Vicky said to Fiona and Jemma once she snapped back to reality, “I think that’s enough of a reunion. It is time to reveal the little surprise I’ve been keeping for you!”<br />
<br />
With that, Vicky briefly left the building, practically skipping along in excitement. In the meantime, you wondered why Fiona and Jemma weren’t trying to escape as they remained huddled together on the nearby table. However, as you studied them more closely you saw that both of them looked completely exhausted. Clearly, Vicky hadn’t been exaggerating when she said that the couple were almost-constantly mating. Indeed, seeing the sticky wet trail Jemma had left when slithering over to her wife really struck a nerve. Being stuck as a mare now almost seemed like a blessing, given that you could have ended up like these poor, terrified creatures.<br />
<br />
These harrowing thoughts continued to circle your mind until Vicky came back into the building. You looked up at her quickly and were immediately startled by what you saw. Now, following Vicky into the building was a small, white-furred, female pug! <br />
<br />
You shifted about nervously as you watched Vicky proudly leading the small dog by a short pink leash. The pug was clearly unhappy as she yapped loudly and pulled back against her captor. However, Vicky was much stronger than this small canine, meaning she was easily able to tie her to one of the legs of the nearby table. Then, she briefly turned to address you and the other terrified animals.<br />
<br />
“Now then,” Vicky said excitedly, “this adorable little bitch is Rianna, and she is going to help me to treat Fiona and Jemma’s phobias.” Upon hearing this, the angry pug started to growl in between her frustrated yips. However, Vicky simply chuckled in response as she bent down to stroke the outraged dog. The pug clearly wanted to bite Vicky, but when she saw the woman staring back at her threateningly, she instead decided to bite her tongue and refrain from attacking her tormentor.<br />
<br />
“Good girl,” Vicky said as she continued to pet the seething dog, “now then, why don’t we show Jemma and Fiona what surprise we’ve got in store for them today…”</p>
