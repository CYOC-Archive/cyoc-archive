<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">There was another reason Drake had changed his name thusly. Sure, it was eons more intriguing than just &quot;Bob&quot;, but there was more to it. For most of his life, he&#39;d always had a fascination with dragons. At first, it started as just innocent curiosity. He met his best friend through wondering out loud about dragons, since Ethan himself had a fascination with medieval history. As their friendship grew over the years, so did their passions. That&#39;s why, Drake thought, Ethan is a history major now. Just like Ethan, his passion for dragons continued to manifest. However, since he couldn&#39;t really make a career out of it, he bottled it up. Now, his major was in business with a focus on money handling, which Ethan got a real kick out of. Multiple times, Drake now remembers, Ethan poked fun at his name and how he seemed to like money. The only moments of his affinity for dragons that he indulged in was in private in bed late at night and anonymously on forums.<br />
<br />
He rubbed the lamp in the quiet of his dorm room and hall. It was still early in the afternoon, so barely, if any at all were there to hear him. As quickly as he had vanished before, Beldazarr materialized in front of Drake. Just as awestruck, the student watched the off-colored smoky figure fill the room. The Djinn made no effort to make himself smaller, since the room was plenty big enough with only Drake in it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Greetings Again, Mortal Master And Friend!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Hello.&quot; Drake said meekly. He was so close to his desires it was becoming hard to think straight.<br />
<br />
&quot;What Is Your Wish Or Desire?&quot;<br />
<br />
Drake calmed himself, and prepared to wish for what he desired.<br />
<br />
&quot;All right,&quot; he began, &quot;I want to be a dragon-- but I don&#39;t want to be a mindless dragon! I want to continue living my life like right now, just as a dragon.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;As It Is, Master? Do You Wish To Mean That Everyone Treats You As If It Were Normal For You To Be A Giant Serpent? In That Case, Would You Prefer To Be Half Man, Half Serpent, As To Lessen The Impact Of Your Transition?&quot;<br />
<br />
Drake hadn&#39;t really thought about it, but it sounded like a good idea. He could be a being that half dragon, and half man. He was well aware of how they appear, countless pictures of such creatures online.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s sounds perfect, Beldazarr. Please make me a dragon man, with all the best and key parts of a dragon!&quot; he said, excited about how it was all coming together.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hm, &#39;all the best and key parts of a dragon&#39;? Are You Sure, Still So Friendly Master?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Absolutely. I wish it so.&quot; Drake said finally.<br />
<br />
&quot;It Is Done.&quot; Beldazarr said, and the cloak of fog receded back into the lamp, taking the Djinn with it.<br />
<br />
Immediately, Drake felt prickly all over his body, as if he had just woken up and his hand was still asleep. As the prickling feeling grew more intense, Drake hunched over his bed, expecting it to turn into pain. Much to his surprise, instead of pain, the sensation grew pleasurable. His eyes grew wide as he watched the skin on his hands and arms quickly tint until it was an unpolished gray. Looking down, his whole body was the same color. Watching his hands as the pushed into the bed, he watched his hands grow course. As his skin became rougher, it also seemed to crack, uniformly, into chute like shapes. It immediately dawned on Drake what was happening, his skin was turning into scales! Sure enough, the cracked skin hardened, taking on a metallic sheen, while also jutting out. He stood up and took a step back from his bed, and watched as all his skin grew into a steely dragon hide.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, somehow being able to feel his clothing through the rough scaly texture of his new hide, Drake realized how he still had his clothes from earlier on. Quickly, he stripped as fast as his body would let him. Before he could get it off, the soft wool of his T-shirt caught on one of his triangular scales and cleanly ripped a hole, as if someone had cut it with a pair of scissors.  Frowning, he held up the shirt with his hand and flipped it over. The hole was too large to ignore, and straight down the middle of the back. Angry, Drake squeezed the shirt in his new scaled hand, which turned out to be a bad idea. Immediately as he squeezed, sharp, ebony colored claws pushed out from and replaced his finger nails, completely piercing the fabric with ease. Swearing, Drake threw the shirt from his hand onto the other edge of the bed, now thoroughly ruined.<br />
<br />
With a little more care, he removed his underwear and jeans and shoes. His socks fared about as well as his shirt did, but he could replace them. Now completely naked, Jake could see his new hide without any obstruction. On his belly and in between his arms and legs, the steel glittering scales become more dull and easier to bend, as well as smaller. Drake noted how those scales retained the sensitivity of his old skin. The prickly feeling returned before he could get a real good look at himself, this time on his head. When he moved his clawed-hands to the prickly area on his head, he could feel that it was his hair, which was rapidly receding into his scalp. He was a little surprised, but realized that most depictions of dragons don&#39;t have hair. He lost his balance as he felt a sharp pulling against the top of his scalp, the end of his chin, and the base of his neck. He fell back and landed on his roommate&#39;s bed as his head began to dramatically alter.<br />
<br />
The tugging at the top of his scalp continued until two horns, as black as his claws, pushed out behind him from the top of his head. As they grew out, they thickened, taking on the texture of ivory, curling more and more the further they grew from Drake&#39;s head. The stopped around a half-circle&#39;s length. As they grew, they overtook the area where his ears were, which in turn rapidly diminished to simple pinholes. Drake clenched his teeth as the combined pressure became all he could focus on. His teeth shifted as he clenched, becoming akin to razors, capable of slicing anything should he bite hard enough. Then his jaw started bulking up to accommodate the new terrifying teeth, growing huge. His chin had given up resisting the pulling sensation, and quickly moved forward from his face, taking his nose with it. Once it was about ten inches from where it started, his nose flattened along with his chin, which fused to his jawline. As his nose flattened to two individual nostrils above his stretched lip,  the familiar dragon muzzle took shape on Drake&#39;s face. The area where his eyebrows used to be in response flared up and outward, making his eyes sink in slightly. Not to be outdone, his nostrils flared upward as well, until they resembled the proper nose of  dragon. Even though he couldn&#39;t tell, Drake&#39;s head looked close to resembling that of a dragon, albeit with a stubby neck.<br />
<br />
The stubby neck did not last long however, as the pulling sensation overcame his neck as well, which began to move upward, increasing Drake&#39;s height by a good margin. As it stretched upward, it bulked up to match the size of his new head, which was rather large. His neck finally settled in a fusion of connecting to the bottom and back of his head, which was very indicative of a dragon. The bulking up of his neck caused a chain reaction in Drake&#39;s body however, as the rest of his body began to take on a more muscled physique. Underneath his softer scales, his pectorals swelled, moving upward while growing larger than what would be on a human.  Along with them, his biceps, deltoids, abdominal area, and triceps all grew to proportions too big for a human, but almost too small for a dragon. This size, perfect for a hybrid dragon man, moved down his torso to his lower body. His legs bulked up considerably up to his knees, but seemed to stop there. Drake, now no longer captivated by the stress in his head, craned his neck downward when the sensation growing muscle didn&#39;t continue past his upper leg.<br />
<br />
Watching past his huge thigh muscles, he saw the balls of his feet pull upward until the arch of his feet are as long as his shin. After that, both his shin  and the new joint quickly continued to bulk up. The end of his feet accommodated with the lack of surface area by growing as thick as his hands. His big clawed toe moved to the side of his foot, allowing to get a better grip. In wonder, Drake lifted his feet and gave a test squeeze with his new digitrade claws. Before he can experiment further, a familiar pressure begins exerting itself on his tail-bone. Expectantly, Drake stood up from his roommates bed. Free to grow, his tail snaked downward until it was as long as his leg, not including the new height the extra joint on his leg gave him. Along with his tail, a pair of wings stretched from the small of his back. They weren&#39;t large enough to allow for flight, but they were key to being a dragon. Too much for a human, too small for a drake, but perfect for a hybrid.<br />
<br />
<br />
Jake began to stretch, feeling as if the changes were finished. Before he could get his new scaled arms and claws into the air however, an intense pressures exploded in his crotch. Drake grew flushed as the force quickly grew extremely pleasurable. In response, his still human genitals became erect. It felt like someone was giving him the best handjob he could ever receive and he let his forked tongue fall out of his mouth as he bent over his roommate&#39;s bed. His cock twitched and ached before it eventually started swelling, much like how his other muscles had. Drake breathed heavily as his cock grew in length and thickness until it was almost as thick as his forearms. In conjunction his balls pulsed, growing to match. The growth finally stopped at what felt like over a foot and a half in length, and thicker than a soup-can. Comically too large on a human, but much too small on a dragon. Perfect for a hybrid. However, unlike the growth, the pleasure didn&#39;t stop for Drake. His thick member throbbed, as dark as his horns and claws.<br />
<br />
He couldn&#39;t take the magical teasing any longer. Drake grabbed the erect monster with his clawed hand and started jerking as fast as his serpentine muscles would let him. As he stroked, distracted by the pleasure he was bringing himself, the more mental aspects of being a dragon began to creep into his mind. He became more domineering, greedy, voracious, and lusty. Emotions and personalities much too overpowering for a human, yet rather feeble compared to a dragon. Perfect for a hybrid. The new dragon-man&#39;s self-pleasure didn&#39;t last much longer, as he quickly approached climax. With a roar, he came strong and hard. The last truly human part of him, his semen, shot out before being covered by  more opaque, more virile dragon semen. He clenched his sharp teeth as he unloaded his monstrous seed onto and around his roommate&#39;s bed.<br />
<br />
Drake slowly opened his eyes as his orgasm slowly faded. His slitted irises-- as steely as the rest of him-- looked around. Slowly, he stood up. He still felt extremely horny, despite just finishing blowing his load. He looked down on the bed. Several thick strands of white rope lay on and down the side of his bed, pooling on the wooden floor. Drake realized that this wasn&#39;t his bed, but his roommate&#39;s. He tried to feel bad, but he couldn&#39;t really. He honestly considered the bed to be his. I mean, the uni board gave me the room, he thought, so it must be his. His roommate can just deal with it. <br />
<br />
He continued to look at his semen. He could smell it vividly with his steel colored scaly nostrils. The scent was intoxicating. It made him wish he could continue to jack off, but his member was unable to follow his command, hanging down at only a half-chub. The dragon man continued to eye his semen and then his lamp. The new, eternal wonder of what more he could have saturated his thoughts, and soon his decisions.</p>
