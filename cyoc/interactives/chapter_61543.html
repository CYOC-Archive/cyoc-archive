<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Dammit. I gotta pay rent though.&quot; said Tony as he looked pleading in to the eyes of his little brother.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just like you to welsh on a bet Tony. Pay up.&quot; said Kit extending his hand.<br />
<br />
Roger was about to make the losers do just that, when Tony spoke up and the idea sounded too good to be true.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok guys fine. This game is over but there are seven in the series. Who wins the whole thing should decide, and lets put down double or <br />
nothing!&quot; Tony grinned pleased with his idea.<br />
<br />
Roger stuck out his lower lip in thought, then smiled. &quot;Seven in the series should mean times seven or nothing.&quot; He liked the idea too.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine&quot; said Hulk, reaching across the table and taking Rogers paper and pen. &quot;Me and Tony bet the Phillies are gonna take the whole shootin <br />
match. You and Roger go for New York. Deal?&quot; He wrote down the two teams, two names next to each.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure.&quot; said Roger, hoping the guys were drunker than he was. His head buzzed slightly, but it was clear the others were barely holding on to <br />
their equilibrium. &quot;And I'll set the terms here. The losers must spend a minimum of 48 hours each week as whatever the winner chooses. If the <br />
loser falls short by even half an hour, then the loser has to spend the entire next week as whatever the winner chooses.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Is there a maximum per week. What if I arranged to burn through the entire total in one summer?&quot; babbled Tony finishing his current glass of <br />
beer.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright but I think it would be more fun if we didn't burn through the entire total in one summer. &quot; Roger said. &quot;Let me get my calculator and . <br />
. . Well you couldn't burn through 291 and 2/3 of a day in one summer anyway but let's say that for every hour per week above 48 that you <br />
spend as whatever the winner wants, you get to spend an hour as whatever you want as long as it's something very different from yourself.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You guys will be so sorry when the Phillies win!&quot; Tony said as he passed out.<br />
<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
The series came down to a real nail biter, just like the game that started the wager that would decide who would be owned and who would be <br />
an owner. But this game had several differences. The first was that there were only four watching this game, and that it was being watched at <br />
the home of Tony and not at the frat. But the biggest difference was the outcome. <br />
<br />
Tony, Kit, and Hulk were drinking and cheering their hearts out, while Roger sat nervously on the edge of his couch cushion. He was the only <br />
one that clearly remembered the contract they had all signed those several games back. And with the Phillies leading in the bottom of the <br />
ninth, he was beginning to regret ever signing that contract.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes!&quot; Hulk and Tony cheer together as they jump up from their seats. The Phillies's pitcher had just thrown the winning strike of the game. Kit <br />
cussed a little while leaning back in his seat, while Roger's face paled. His only hope being that no one brought up the contract- &quot;Hey Rog, <br />
where is that contract we made up? I wanna see what kind of messed up thing we bet for while we were drunk.&quot; Tony said, making Roger curse <br />
under his breath.<br />
<br />
Roger begrudgingly pulled the folded up contract from his pocket and tossed it to Tony. As Tony read Roger tried to think of a way to get out <br />
of this, lie? Make another bet? What ever it was he had to do something before either Tony or Hulk gave him or Kit an order.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh man... we were so hammered when we came up with this guys.&quot; Hulk laughed when Tony handed him the contract. &quot;It says the losers, aka <br />
Roger and Kit.&quot; He and Tony share a knuckle bump. &quot;Can be turned into anything Tony or I want for 48 hours per week for a total of 7000 <br />
hours.&quot; Hulk and Tony both smile and laugh a bit, even Kit joins in. Roger feigns a laugh himself, but on the inside he was on pins and needles.<br />
<br />
&quot;That is so ridiculous man.&quot; Kit laughed harder. &quot;I mean imagine one of you being horny and then having me become your dream girl to chop <br />
your wood.&quot; Kit bursts into laughter on the couch while Hulk and Tony just snicker. <br />
<br />
&quot;I could use a hot piece of ass now that you mention it Kit.&quot; Tony snickers. &quot;How about you turn into a tall blond with basketball sized tits and <br />
a perfect bubble butt.&quot; Tony snickers. &quot;And big puffy cock sucking lips.&quot; Added in Hulk with a gentle jab to Tony's ribs.<br />
<br />
Roger's eyes shoot wide open as he hears this, then he jerks around to stare at Kit, just in time to see him suddenly go completely ridged. <br />
<br />
Kit, lets out a terrible groan as his skin constricts all over his body for a second, then relaxes and begins to warp into a new form. His shirt <br />
starts to tent up as his chest starts to expand into two incredible spheres, his hips and butt not being out done fallow suit, lifting Kit's lower <br />
body off couch some. His groan changes pitch to a higher pitch as his face softens and his lips puff out comically for a second before deflating <br />
to a human size.... albeit still very puffy and sexy. <br />
<br />
As soon as it is over Kit jumps to his feet, his clothes clinging to his new curves like a second skin. His hands fly all over his body and face. He <br />
lets out an incredibly girly scream as he looks up at a mirror that is hanging over the fireplace. His hair now a very yellow blond, hanging down <br />
to his shoulders. &quot;Oh my god! What have you done to me!&quot; Kit's new voice sounding a bit squeaky like a bimbo blond.<br />
<br />
Tony and Hulk stared at Kit in total shock, Roger also staring, but more out of dread knowing he could have just have easily been transformed <br />
that easily, and still could be.<br />
<br />
Tony was the first to stand and walk up to Kit. Kit stared at him with tear filled eyes, unsure what to do. Tony on the other hand, got a wicked <br />
smile on his face as he shoved Kit back onto the couch and started groping him... now her gigantic breasts. Kit screams for Tony to stop, but is <br />
soon moaning despite herself. &quot;Kit, I order you to not resist me physically.&quot; And with that said Kit's struggles stopped, though she still made <br />
her distress known.<br />
<br />
While Kit began to rip off Kit's over stretched shirt, Hulk leaned in toward Roger, a wicked smile on his own face too. Roger looked up at him, <br />
just in time to get his first order, and see what it was like to be on the receiving end of what he normally did others.<br />
<br />
Hulk's hand pressed against the door above Roger's head. His palm delivered all the Hulk's body weight, there was no exit for Roger that way. <br />
Roger turned to face Hulk, and found himself face to armpit with Hulk's hairy stinky pit. It startled him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You're lucky I got a girlfriend, Roger. But what I lack, you can make up for. How'd you like to be my unit and make me proud.&quot; Hulk said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ooooormgh!&quot; was all that came out of Roger as he bent over and backed up toward Hulk.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeow!&quot; yelped Hulk.<br />
<br />
Roger was gone. His empty clothing collapsed in a heap. A massive cock and balls hung from Hulk's open fly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Damn that hurt!&quot;<br />
<br />
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Roger was aware the entire time. Hulk had been busy with his new equipment and Roger could see, hear, feel, smell, and taste everything the <br />
whole time. He'd spent the whole evening as Hulk's equipment but it was morning and per the contract, Roger was released to go to classes.<br />
<br />
Roger understood the magic well enough to know there was no escape. Even if he tried to escape, the magic would find him and drag him back <br />
for a whole week as Hulk's equipment. Roger was so busy thinking about the contract that he wasn't paying attention in class. But he finally <br />
struck on an idea. &quot;If I can't escape it, I can at least try to get as much out of it as I can.&quot;<br />
<br />
He went up to Hulk later and said, &quot;Spring Break is coming up. I had plans but I'm going to cancel my plans so you can have me for the entire <br />
break. Than you can really impress everyone and I earn some hours to be what I want.&quot;<br />
<br />
Even with that arrangement made, Roger was dreading more and more as Spring Break approached.<br />
<br />
The time came and Roger was walking toward Hulk's door still debating about whether to go through with this or not.</p>
