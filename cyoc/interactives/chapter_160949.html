<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Gloria&#39;s stomach was in knots as her stepmom Lisa now drive to the DMV. Yes she had faced down Morgan Lefay, kitsune assassins, humanoid monsters know as Voids, and even beat back epilepsy but this was destroying her nerves.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nervous,&quot; Lisa asked as she gazed at the teen. Gloria nodded, today her and Jackie turned 16 and would finally be taking their driving test. &quot;Terrified,&quot; Gloria sighed. &quot;I wish I could have gotten more practice at Katie&#39;s wedding.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And I wish your sisters wedding wasnt invaded by interdimensional monsters bent on our destruction,&quot; Lisa smirked. &quot;Unfortunately it seems in this family we cant get what we want.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How can you be so cavalier,&quot; Gloria frowned. Lisa shrugged, smiling at the girl. &quot;Gloria listen,&quot; she said. &quot;Since your sister  gave you that ring I&#39;ve seen you take on things that would make grown women scream in fear. I know it&#39;s a huge step but trust me, you&#39;re ready.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How can you be so sure mom,&quot; Gloria asked. &quot;Because Gloria,&quot; Lisa smiled. &quot;In case you havent noticed your amazing.&quot; Gloria gave her mom a weak smile as they pulled into the DMV. She appreciated Lisa&#39;s confidence in her but she was still nervous. As she exited the car she immediately noticed Jackie and her mother. &quot;Hey Jackie,&quot; she called.<br />
<br />
Jackie gave her friend a timid wave as Gloria and Lisa caught up with them. As Lisa and Jackie&#39;s mom Hannah talked the teens stepped away. &quot;So you nervous,&quot; Jackie asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Terrified,&quot; Gloria sighed. &quot;How about you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A little,&quot; Jackie whispered. &quot;But I&#39;ve had practice driving to Ann&#39;s. Still it&#39;s kinda nerve racking.&quot; Gloria could only nod, as the teens turned towards the testing area they were surprised to see Gloria&#39;s boyfriend Nate and his brother Adam exit. &quot;Nate you took the test,&quot; Gloria said in awe.<br />
<br />
Nate nodded, reaching into his pocket as he now produced his newly minted license. &quot;I passed,&quot; he smiled.<br />
<br />
&quot;How about you Adam,&quot; Jackie asked. The large teen smirked as he now threw down his license. &quot;Guess whose on the road,&quot; he exclaimed, pointing to himself. &quot;This guy!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jackie and Gloria chuckled softly as Adam now boasted of driving Felicia all over town over the weekend. &quot;So any suggestions,&quot; Gloria asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah hopefully you dont end up with this old dude Travers,&quot; Adam stated. &quot;Guy is a total dick and an old fart to boot.&quot; Gloria could only nod as she now heard her and Jackie&#39;s names called. Nate now leaned in giving his girlfriend a gentle peck on the cheek. &quot;Good luck,&quot; he smiled.<br />
<br />
As Jackie and Gloria entered they were first prompted to fill out some forms and take a written test. The test itself was not difficult, Gloria had been studying the DMV exam book for the past couple of months. Happily it seemed the questions were common sense. Gloria and Jackie easily finished it, happy to discover they aced the exam. As the two friends now waited for the driving test they found themselves engaged in small talk. The two trying to put eachother at ease.<br />
<br />
&quot;Gloria Turner?&quot;<br />
<br />
Gloria looked towards the front desk, noticing a woman beckoning her forward. Kackie wished her luck as Gloria now followed the woman. &quot;Ms. Turner,&quot; she said. &quot;This is Mr. Travers. Hell be conducting your exam.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gloria&#39;s blood ran cold as she gazed at the elderly instructor. If Adam was right the 60 year old man with grey wispy hair was a stickler for the rules and had a reputation for failing first time drivers. &quot;Hello,&quot; Gloria stammered as the elderly man gave her an icy stare.<br />
<br />
&quot;Step into the vehicle Ms. Turner,&quot; Travers said coldly. &quot;And dont dawdle the exam begins now.&quot; Gloria nodded as she now sat in the drivers seat. Checking her mirrors and buckling her seatbelts, she now placed the key into the ignition and started the car.<br />
<br />
&quot;Forgetting something,&quot; Travers said coldly. Gloria&#39;s blood ran cold as she broke into a cold sweat, she wasnt forgetting anything was she? Gloria glanced over at the old man as he now began writing on his clipboard. &quot;Pull out Ms. Turner and follow my directions.&quot; Gloria nodded, putting the car into drive as she pulled out of the parking lot.<br />
<br />
Gloria had driven this road before with her dad and knew her way around. As she drove she could see Travers shaking his head in disgust. &quot;Do you see the posted speed limit,&quot; he grumbled. Gloria looked at the speed limit. &quot;Its 25 sir.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then why are you speeding,&quot; he said angrily. Gloria looked down at the speedometer, she was currently going 26 mph. &quot;I&#39;m going 26 sir,&quot; she said nervously. Travers grumbled as he began to write.<br />
<br />
Gloria was sweating now, slowing the car down to 25. He was going to fail her! Gloria could feel tears beginning to form in her eyes. As she now turned on the turn signal she noticed her ring begin to glow. &quot;Oh no!&quot;<br />
<br />
Gloria was to concerned with driving to really see what was happening. As she listened Travers she could hear the man&#39;s voice becoming stronger and more youthful. Chancing a glance, Gloria stifled a gasp.<br />
<br />
Travers looked at least 30 years younger now and was still going. The man&#39;s wispy grey hair had filled back in turning from gray to it&#39;s natural brown. Travers eyes were now bright while his face was devoid of wrinkles.<br />
<br />
&quot;Turn left here,&quot; Travers stated, his voice sounding clearer. Gloria complied, turning onto the street. &quot;Oh pull up there,&quot; Travers said excitedly. Gloria gazed at the now teenage driving instructor, noticing a skinny 18 year old with well combed brown hair and baggy clothes. Gloria looked to where the teen was pointing, a look of confusion on Gloria&#39;s face. &quot;McDonald&#39;s,&quot; she thought.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah pull into the drive thru,&quot; a now 16 year old Travers said excitedly. &quot;I&#39;m starved.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gloria complied, pulling on line for the drive thru. Unfortunately there were quite a few cars in front of them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aw man,&quot; Travers groaned going from 16 to 15. &quot;I freaking hate waiting.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gloria said nothing, occasionally glancing over at her continually regressing driving instructor. Travers appeared to be 14 now, having left high school behind. The teen was now reliving a growth spurt in reverse as he now traveled back through junior high. Gloria could see the boys face becoming rounder and more innocent, his clothing becoming increasingly baggy on his narrow frame.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can I get a large fri,&quot; Travers asked as he became a preteen of 12. Gloria gawked at the boy as he now shrank smaller. Travers clothing was practically hanging off the boys frame. The neckhole gaped around him while his feet were slowly but surely leaving the floor. Gloria bit her lip anxiously as she watched the boy grow even younger, the shoulder strap sliding further up his body. As he went from 10 to 9 the boy grumbled in disgust as he slipped the shoulder belt off his face.<br />
<br />
&quot;You um should probably wear that,&quot; Gloria said sheepishly.<br />
<br />
&quot;It keeps hitting me in the face,&quot; Travers whined as he became 8. &quot;Hey can I get a Happy Meal I want to have the toy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Um sure,&quot; Gloria responded as she placed her order.<br />
<br />
Placing the order Gloria now pulled to the window. Grabbing the Happy Meal Gloria could see the teller giving her an odd look. &quot;Isnt your brother a little young to sit up front?&quot;<br />
<br />
Gloria glanced over at Travers, her eyes bulging as she noticed the 5 year old boy shoveling fries into his mouth as he now began playing with the toy inside his meal. &quot;Umm his carseat is broken,&quot; Gloria said quickly as she now drove off.<br />
<br />
Gloria thankfully pulled into the DMV without any issues. Looking at the 5 year old Gloria could see the boy playing happily in the front seat. Travers feet no longer reached the floor, his khakis acting like more of a blanket than pants at this point. Travers was so small now that only the top of his head was now visible in the passenger window. &quot;Um we here,&quot; she said sheepishly.<br />
<br />
Travers hummed to himself as he now began to drink his apple juice. &quot;Tanks lady,&quot; Travers lisped. The boy now handed Gloria the paper he was holding, a paper that now was covered in childish drawings but also stated that Gloria had passed.<br />
<br />
&quot;You nice,&quot; Travers smiled. &quot;Maybe we can get Donald&#39;s again later!&quot; Gloria smiled, nodding as she now exited the car. It may have been the starngest driving test ever but Gloria now officially had her license.</p>
