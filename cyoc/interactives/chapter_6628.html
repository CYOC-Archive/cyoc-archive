<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The class periods were just changing when Trisha and I left the locker room.  Other people started pouring out into the halls.  None of them gave Trisha, stark naked, so much as a second glance.  Well, other than the usual leers she got from horny boys.  She didn't seem to act any differently, either.  I heard her alternatively scoff and giggle in response to those she noticed gazing at her.<br />
<br />
&quot;You think it's a good idea to do that?&quot; I asked her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do what?&quot; she asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Make eyes at other guys,&quot; I said.  &quot;I don't know, it might effect how I plan on treating you.&quot;  We were still walking as I made this conversation.  I peered out of the corner of my eye and saw that a look of fear washed over her face.<br />
<br />
&quot;You wouldn't,&quot; she said, attempting to call out my bluff.  Only problem was I wasn't bluffing.<br />
<br />
&quot;If it makes you feel better, than you just believe that,&quot; I said.  &quot;But don't start to believe I won't try something if I think you're not giving me the proper respect.&quot;  Jeez, I thought.  I sounded like a slavemaster.  I reassured myself that I wouldn't actually do anything harmful to her.  I might alter her to make her learn a lesson, but I wouldn't make it permanent.  After all, she deserved some humiliation.<br />
<br />
She didn't say another word as we proceeded to our next class, which was chemistry.  Let me just say that I found this to be the worst class I had.  The subject was just boring for me.  And our teacher, Mr. Phelps, simply didn't make it more interesting.  He might have been able to if our school had more money to buy up to date equipment, but alas.  Maybe I should use the ring to help the school, I thought.  I'd save that for another day.<br />
<br />
As we walked into the class I remembered that Trisha and I sat on opposite ends of the room.  No matter, I thought, the ring would fix that dilemma.  I wished that Trisha and I would sit not across the room, not even next to each other, but at the very same desk.  I wished that we had a desk that was big enough for both of us to fit under, in such a way that Trisha could sit on my lap.  I also remembered to wish that everyone would think this was normal.<br />
<br />
I looked to see the desk where I usually sat become wider and taller, just as I had wished.  This would be an interesting fit, I thought.  &quot;Is that seat for both of us?&quot; Trisha asked as we walked up to it.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Yep,&quot; I smiled.  &quot;Should make it easy for us to engage in a little chemistry of our own.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, is that what you plan on doing?&quot; she asked.  I couldn't quite tell if she was being coy or just plain dumb.  &quot;Because it's just been too long since we last did it,&quot; she said.  Again, I didn't know if she was being dumb.  Ordinarily I would have taken that statement as a joke.  But now she had this intense desire for me.  Could she really only last 10 minutes without having my cock inside her?  <br />
<br />
Suddenly I realized I was thinking about this much too hard.  I decided to end that.  I wished she would just tell me if she was being coy or stupid.  &quot;Joe, I was just joking,&quot; she said.  &quot;Yea, I need your cock, but I can go a little while without it.&quot;  I guess Lindsey was some kind of raging nymphomaniac even without my wish aiding her desires.  Trisha appeared to be able to keep hers under control.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Alright take your seats,&quot; Mr. Phelps said, entering the room.  I sat down and Trisha sat right down on my lap.  We both fit perfectly fine under the desktop.  I put my arms around her waist and she leaned back into me.  Mr. Phelps didn't look at us at all.  He just started teaching.  A few minutes later he clearly saw us when he was scanning the class to see if someone knew an answer.  He didn't react at all.  God, I loved this ring's power.<br />
<br />
After 15 minutes of absolute boredom, I decided I could take it no more.  I wished that no one at all would react in any way to what we were about to do.  I wished that everyone would be able to ignore whatever noises or movements either one of us would make.  I leaned over to Trisha's ear and whispered, &quot;It's time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Let's do it,&quot; she whispered back.  <br />
<br />
She started to adjust herself, but I held her firmly in place.  &quot;No,&quot; I said.  &quot;Let's try it this way.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;OK,&quot; she said.  &quot;You have quite the imagination, don't you?&quot; she giggled.<br />
<br />
&quot;You ain't seen nothing yet,&quot; I said.  An odd thought popped into my mind.  What if I didn't have to take my pants off?  This was too good to pass up.  I wished that my cock would slide into her through my jeans and boxers.  I felt a rush of air around my cock.  I couldn't see since Trisha was practically sitting on it, but I imagined that a hole had formed in my clothes so my cock could escape.<br />
<br />
My cock became erect almost instantly and I felt it slide into Trisha's pussy.  She moaned sharply as she felt her womanhood penetrated.  In order to enhance the experience, I reached around and started to fondle her breasts.  She loved the feelings as she leaned back all the way against my body.  From there, I started to kiss her neck.  She started to moan in quick succession as she started to ride up and down my cock.  She turned her head to face mine and we kissed.  <br />
<br />
After a few seconds, I stopped kissing her and looked around the room.  No one was looking at us.  Everyone else in the room was looking at Mr. Phelps, save of course for Mr. Phelps himself.  It was unbelievable.  Here we were fucking each other in front of 25 other people, and no one even cared.  <br />
<br />
I resumed my necking of Trisha as she started to ride my cock harder and harder.  She was really getting into it, judging by the sounds coming from her lips.  She had been moaning loudly, and now they had become almost like screams.  Her screaming didn’t last long because she climaxed soon after they started.  She calmed herself as I came into her.  I found it odd that she came before I did.  Did this desire for me make her a little too eager for it to happen?  Or did she just let herself get all worked up?  This was something to which I needed the answer.</p>
