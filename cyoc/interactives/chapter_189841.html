<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;No idea sadly. So we are just as likely to wander in circles as we are to find something useful or dangerous. Luckily for us, I hit like a god damn freight train and you are stupidly tanky. So let me handle all of the attacking, Miss. Masochist&quot; smirks Brenda. You want to argue back, but then again, she isn&#39;t exactly wrong right now. With your current body, you do get off by being struck or physically forced. As if to prove this point, you remembered how before you met up with her, you were rubbing up against any textrued surface to just make yourself cum. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ok, while I can&#39;t deny that, please just use my name&quot; you ask with a slightly disheartened sigh. Brenda laughs but agrees, saying that it was just a joke. &quot;Sure think, Luka. Ha ha ha! Or, or are you more of a Lucy kind of girl?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My name is Lucas, Brenda.&quot;<br />
<br />
Brenda foulded her massive arms and looked down on you as she towered over your body. &quot;Not with those tits. Your a woman now, so you need a better fitting name or the immersion will be broken.&quot;<br />
<br />
You throw up your arms in protest to her argument. &quot;Really? That breaks the immersion? We are literally IN THE GAME!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Exactly, so you need to play accordingly to our usual rules.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck, fine, Luka then. Anything else about me breaking immersion for you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, but you could be a bit happier. This has been pretty fun so far. And as I said before, you make for quite the good looking girl, so you should just enjoy this while you still can. And since its your own body, you can touch and feel everything you want to.&quot; <br />
<br />
You sigh, unsure exactly as to why you are so frustrated all of a sudden. You know Brenda is right too. You should still be playing to your current role, even if things are not going quite as you had been expecting them to. &quot;Anyways, let&#39;s roll and whoever has the higher roll gets to pick the direction we head in.&quot;<br />
<br />
You roll a 28 and she roles a 31. So Brenda chooses to keep moving in the direction she was heading in originally before she found you. She also offers to carry you on her back as she is stronger, so caring you won&#39;t be any issue for her, and also, she can move without orgasming every few hundred feet. You reluctantly agree with her and climb onto her back. Funny enough, your slime actually can make you stick you to her if you want it to, so she doesn&#39;t even need to hold you in place. It is the same &quot;stickiness&quot; that allows you to grip surfaces and to hold your sword without it slipping out of your slime coated hands.<br />
<br />
While Brenda runs through the forest, you look again through your character information to try and find all of the changes. One thing you hadn&#39;t realized at first, is that your race no longer even is fully human, as it is actually now &quot;Human/Slime&quot;. You actually are now part slime, which you kinda guessed at already. But to confirm it, really makes you feel a bit off. <br />
<br />
Another interesting thing is that while your health recieve a massive boost, apparently so did your magic abilities. Of course your &quot;Slime Commander&quot; and &quot;360 Degree Vision&quot; abilities are there. But also some new abilities like &quot;Water Absorption&quot; and &quot;Hydrotherapy&quot; which are both categorized as self buff/healing abilities, as well as a new passive ability called &quot;Liquid Body&quot; which basically makes your body behave as if it were a fluid that didn&#39;t need a container.<br />
<br />
You are intrigued by this and try reshaping your body by giving yourself a second pair of arms by splitting your current ones in two, and it actually works. &quot;Woah! Hey Brenda, take a look at this!&quot; You say excitedly from on her back. She stops running and looks up at you as your top pair of arms hold her cheeks while your lower ones cup your boobs. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my god! Is that an ability?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure is! My body can act like a fluid and without needing a container. It&#39;s weird, but cool too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah it is, what else can you do?&quot;<br />
<br />
You think for a second, then grin mischievously as you slide down her back and onto her front. You slip into her armor, you wrap her body with your own, leaving just your head in tact as you set it to stick out from inside her cleavage. Brenda flicks your head, causing you to quiver a bit. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, that spot isn&#39;t a head rest you know&quot; laughs Brenda. You just turn your head to face her and stick your tongue out playfully as this is your way of paying her back from earlier. Unexpectedly though, she actually leans her head forwards and puts your tongue into her mouth and begins kissing you. You quickly pull away and sink beneath her armor then down her leg and land on the ground in a pool of slime. <br />
<br />
You pull yourself together and retake your normal human form and re-adhear yourself to Brenda&#39;s back without saying a word. She just laughs and carries on moving. You need to think about things for a bit as well, so for about 10 minutes you travel in silence as you gather your thoughts. <br />
<br />
You can taste her sweat though and the memory of her kissing you is hard to get out of your head. Specifically you were unsure as to why it made you so excited that you panicked. While deep in thought, an arrow passes right into your forehead and burries itself a good few inches into your head. <br />
<br />
You are not dead, or even severely damaged, as your life is now bound to the slime core in your pussy, but the arrow in your head is making you cum your brains out. And while you are uncontrollably moaning and cumming while stuck on her back, Brenda turns around to face the archer while she reaches behind her and pulls out the arrow from your skull with a single motion.<br />
<br />
&quot;Who&#39;s there?&quot; Shouts Brenda as she readies her log sized spear. <br />
<br />
&quot;A friend. You had a monster stuck on your back, so I took it out for you.&quot; Says a voice from above you both. Then a man drops down in front of Brenda. However, she is pissed and goes to attack him. You quickly move in front of him and tank the hit (having yet another orgasm of course due to the impact) as you are fairly certain that this man is your friend, Ned.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the fuck Luka? He just tried to off us, so why are you protecting him?&quot; Asks a frustrated Brenda.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ned?&quot; You ask. The archer has a shocked look on his face for a moment, then returns to his normal grimace. &quot;Yep, that&#39;s Ned.&quot; You quickly say to Brenda. <br />
<br />
&quot;How do you know?&quot; Asks Brenda as she holds her spear towards Ned&#39;s neck.<br />
<br />
&quot;Because this dumbass is still trying too hard to stay in character and act cool even though he is about to shit himself in fear of your spear. Plus what dumbass besides Ned attacks someone then just lands right in front of them as if he deserves thanks for trying to kill his friend just now.&quot; You say, directing the latter half towards Ned sarcastically.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck, ok so my name is Ned, who the fuck are you two then?&quot; Complains the archer.<br />
<br />
Brenda answers him after lowering her spear. &quot;It&#39;s me, Brenda, and that is Luka. You know, your friends.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ned&#39;s eyes widen at hearing this. &quot;Oh, sorry about that Brenda. Wait, Luka? You mean Lucas somehow became a girl? Ha ha ha, that&#39;s hilarious. Oh you would somehow manage something like that with your shitty luck. But still, if that is Luka, then why did she get flagged as a monster attacking you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My race got changed into a half slime, and I wasn&#39;t attacking her, per say, as all I was doing was just absorbing her sweat. But I guess the game thinks otherwise about that. Good to know.&quot; You say as you pull yourself together from the splattered puddle your upper body had become. You also get a good laugh at seeing Ned&#39;s face once he sees your bikini armor clad, slime coated body. <br />
<br />
&quot;Um, wow. You uh, you look good.&quot; He says nervously. &quot;Hey, relax. It&#39;s still me in here you know. And I am not interested in your dick, so stop hitting on me.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I-I was not. And I know that you are.&quot; He quickly denies. You look at his eyes, then down at the erection tenting his pants, then back up to his eyes. &quot;Really? Because I was kidding about not being interested you know&quot; you say while being intentionally flirtatious with him. Of course this is all just you teasing him as payback for shooting you in the head with an arrow. But perhaps you are being way too convincing, as even Brenda raises an eyebrow at your sudden claim. <br />
<br />
Ned bites your bait though and fully commits to selling himself to you like a fool. You let him carry on about how he has an amazing dick and how he promises to treat you well and such. Then right as he loosens his pants you smile and say &quot;There, now we are even from you shooting me in the face&quot; and flip him off. <br />
<br />
Brenda falls down laughing and Ned&#39;s face turns red in embarrassment, realizing he was just making a fool of himself. &quot;Fucking hell man. Don&#39;t tease me like that. But yeah, I guess we are even now.&quot; You shake hands, and then he wipes the slime off of his hand with a slightly grossed out look. &quot;So where are the other two?&quot;<br />
<br />
You shrug your shoulders. &quot;No idea. But with the pattern this is showing, I am to be hit with at least 2 more friendly fire attacks.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Nah, we&#39;re cool now. It was a great shot too&quot; you say as you retake up your spot on Brenda&#39;s back. <br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks, I guess&quot; says Ned. With that the 3 of you leave in search of your last 2 missing party members. You definitely also did not mention how your body makes you orgasm through physical contact, or how shaking his hand just now had made you cum just a bit since his grip was so firm.</p>
