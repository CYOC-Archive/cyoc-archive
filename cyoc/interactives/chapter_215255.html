<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was one of the men whom she had seen while she fled. He was definitely not her friend or ally, that&#39;s for sure. Delilah noticed this and quickly pulled Jane out of sight before the man could notice them. <br />
<br />
&quot;It appears you may have been tracked. Thankfully it&#39;s been some time since you arrived here, so I doubt it was done by tailing you. Meaning that they have no solid proof that you actually are here. Unfortunately though, now we have to be a bit creative. Come with me, but be quiet&quot; explained Delilah. Jane nodded and silently went down into the cellar, which seemed to be where Delilah brewed her potions. <br />
<br />
&quot;Please remove your clothes and take a seat over there until it&#39;s ready. This won&#39;t take long&quot; whispered Delilah while pointing to a wooden chair on the far side of the room. Jane did as her mother asked and sat down naked on the chair with her legs curled up between her arms as it was a bit chilly. Delilah clicked her tongue at how ignorant her daughter was about female bodies, but didn&#39;t have time to correct her exposing posture. <br />
<br />
Delilah prepaired the potion, throwing in several already pre-prepaired ingredients from various jars and shelves, then she began mixing it over the fire. It brewed for about 4 minutes until it turned a wine-like red color. Delilah scooped up a bottles worth and emptied over half of it back into the cauldron until she had the right amount, then gave it to Jane to drink. <br />
<br />
Despite it just being boiled over a fire, the liquid was rather cool and easy to swallow. It had the faint taste of strawberries too. Jane suddenly felt her body begin to warp and stretch. Her legs became longer and her thighs filled out a bit more. Her upper body gained a few inches as well, though her biggest development was in her boobs, which practically ballooned out from her body as it finished undergoing a rather rapid puberty. And even though her body had already been mostly through one puberty before, it still underwent this second forced one without any issues. <br />
<br />
Delilah broke the silence once the changes were finished, while helping Jane get onto her feet, as Jane&#39;s typical center of balance was now heavily offset by her JJ-cup breasts, wider hips, bigger ass, and hair that now reached down to the back of her thighs. &quot;There, you should be about 19 now. And I doubt that anyone could claim that you and your prior appearance could even possibly be the same person, given your new, well, you get what I mean.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;T-thanks... I think. But I feel all weirdly cramped in my chest now, is that normal?&quot; Asked Jane as she slowly adjusted to her new, more mature body. Delilah clicked her tongue after hearing that. &quot;Damn. You wouldn&#39;t happen to have stomach issues after eating cheese would you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I-I use to, back when I was a kid. I don&#39;t usually eat a lot of cheese though, so I don&#39;t know if I still do or not. Why? Is that bad?&quot; <br />
<br />
Delilah sighed while shaking no. &quot;It&#39;s not perticularily life threatening or detrimental to your health, but you were likely lactose intolerant. Unfortunately that potion uses cow milk, and a lot of it at that. The potion would have cured that, however because it was there to begin with, and I didn&#39;tknow about it, nor really have time to adjust for it either, but there is going to be an inconvenient side effect that you will just have to get use to dealing with until you can get back to your normal appearance. I&#39;m sorry about that. But for now, put these back on and let&#39;s go get you a proper wardrobe.&quot; Delilah handed Jane her gown back after adjusting it to fit her new adult body. She also gave Jane a pair of women&#39;s shoes with a short-ish, 2.5 inch heel that was enchanted to provide the wearer with optimal balance. &quot;Wear these too. You don&#39;t have all day to get use to your new body, so these should at least make you able to walk normally. This way you can adapt as we shop without raising any suspicion.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jane did as told and put on the heels. She immediately found her balance, despite never wearing heels with such a thin point before. Even her formal boots she would wear back when she was still a prince, which had raised heel, used a bulky block instead of this thin little heel. <br />
<br />
&quot;There called stilettos and while typically not for everyday wear unless you need to look presentable at all times, like in a governmental position, they are sometimes worn by women who are clothes shopping, so not many should find it odd for you to be wearing them. But you should never wear them when you are out doing farm and field work, understand?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes mother&quot; replied Jane as she took a few practice steps, feeling how her body moved in its new form. &quot;Are my boobs always going to be bouncing around this much whenever I walk? Or will they settle down eventually?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm? You don&#39;t know? Haven&#39;t you ever laid down with a woman before? We use special kinds of clothing, like corsets or bras to keep them managed. But, the bigger the boobs are, the less effective the clothing is at keeping them managed. In your case, bras won&#39;t cut it, so a corset, and maybe even a tighter dress will have to do. But likely one with a wide and lower neck line for easy access.&quot; Delilah had whispered the last bit to herself as it was more just her thinking out loud than conveying information to her daughter.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s quite unfortunate to hear. But I suppose having bouncy breasts isn&#39;t as bad as what could... would happen, if I am found by the rebels. So I will just have to take them as being the lesser of the two evils&quot; accepted Jane, trying to look at her situation in as much of a positive manner as she could manage. She was alive, and was being protected without being asked for her to do anything unreasonable in return nor was she being extorted by these kind people in return for keeping her hidden. So these little inconveniences here and there meant nothing in comparison to the grander scope of things. <br />
<br />
When they finally walked upstairs, the man was still there, and Carlisle was sitting at the table with him, aparently waiting for something. And upon seeing them walk in, Carlisle paused for only a split second upon seeing his now older daughter and her newly well endowed figure. But he recomposed himself before anyone but Delilah could notice and announced to the man, &quot;ah, see. There they are. These beautiful ladies are my wife, Delilah, and our daughter, Jane. So no, as I have said, I haven&#39;t seen any young girls around here. My daughter is 19, and she&#39;s clearly still the youngest person in the room. But definitely not some 12 year old kid, for obvious reasons.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;14, but I get your point. We are looking for a much more petite girl anyways. Sorry to bother you sir, ladies. If you happen to see her though, please do inform us about it right away. She is dangerous, and we wouldn&#39;t wish for anyone of you to be hurt by her&quot; said the man before taking his leave. <br />
<br />
Carlisle closed the door behind him, then turned to face his family. &quot;Well now, it would appear that your mother has done a bit more than just helped you do your hair.&quot;<br />
<br />
Delilah explained everything, including how Jane was likely to be lactose intolerant. Carlisle unintentionally grimaced upon hearing that, but quickly stopped and controlled his expressions so as to not worry Jane about her likely condition. <br />
<br />
So after about a 20 minute discussion, Delilah and Jane were finally ready to leave and go shopping. But Jane looked a bit off. &quot;Is something the matter Jane?&quot; Asked Carlisle.<br />
<br />
Jane didn&#39;t answer right away, but after a few moments nodded. &quot;My breasts feel stiff and sore, and the gown rubbing on them is now irritating them even. Plus they bounce a lot when I walk, which only started to hurt once we left the cellar. Actually it was around that time when they really began to feel sore.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Damn, I though we would have had more time&quot; huffed Delilah. She then sighed and sat down beside her daughter while placing an arm around her in a half hug. &quot;Its going to be alright Jane. That&#39;s almost certainly because of that side effect I mention earlier. I was going to explain it further after you had some time to adapt first, but I guess we wern&#39;t so lucky. The short and sweet of it is that you are lactating. Quite significantly so. It&#39;s so much that your breasts can&#39;t contain it all, thus why they feel so sore, swollen, sensitive and stiff. They basically are letting you know that you are nearing your capacity limits, and that they need to be drained as soon as possible.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jane looked at her mom in bewilderment. &quot;I&#39;m lactating? And now I need my boobs to be drained?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Exactly. It&#39;s a really poor example, but it should get the picture across. You are essentially like a cow in human form in terms of milk production. So you will likely need to milk yourself at least once a day, if not more. We can help you do it too, if it becomes too difficult for you to do it yourself. I can only imagine how sensitive to touch they must be right now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Carlisle smiked and proposed something a joke to brightened the mood a little. &quot;Or if you&#39;re interested, we could try hooking you up to the auto milker like the rest of our cows? You&#39;ll be completly empty and in practly no time at all if we did that. Though unfortunatly there&#39;s no helping the smell inside the milking parlor. Cows don&#39;t know where they are not supposed to crap after all. But if you do it in there, nothings stopping you from doing it too. What do ya say?&quot;<br />
<br />
Delilah shot him a pissed off glare, but then Jane laughed, so she let his bad joke slide this time. <br />
<br />
Jane looked towards her Father with a smile, &quot;So if I do it in there, can I also crap on the floor?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why not? It&#39;s practically part of the service, plus you get a nice big trough of fresh hay to eat from too!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ooh, sounds delicious. Do I need to stand on all fours too and moo?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If you don&#39;t, then the other cows will definitely start gossiping about you behind your back.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my, I wouldn&#39;t want that! Do you have a pair of gloves I could use? Or am I expected to be naked?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We can put a bell around your neck if you&#39;d like. But cows don&#39;t typically wear clothes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s true, guess I will just need a bath then afterwards. Will you be scrubbing me down, or should I just walk into the river?&quot;<br />
<br />
Delilah finally had enough and loudly groaned in order to stop their gross foolishness. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh relax, it&#39;s just a joke between us guys&quot; quipped Carlisle. <br />
<br />
&quot;She&#39;s our daughter! You shouldn&#39;t be treating her like some kind of animal, even if its just a joke!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But didn&#39;t you just call me a cow in human form, Mom?&quot; Pointed out Jane. <br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s... that was just an example! I even said it was a poor one at that. You&#39;re certainly not a cow!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jane and Carlisle laughed some more. But now that their joke was stopped, Jane returned back to their previous conversation and gave her answer. &quot;Thanks, but I would like to try doing it inside the house for now. Though haha, I will need to keep that offer in mind Dad, if for example, say my hands get too tired to finish myself off...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh alright Jane. There are milk buckets out back you can use. Just rinse one down before you bring it inside though&quot; said Carlisle while pointing towards the back door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Grab two sweetie. One may not be enough for you&quot; corrected Delilah. &quot;I&#39;ll teach you how to do it once you get back inside.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jane nodded, then slowly made her way out through the back door, trying not to bounce her boobs around as best as she could.</p>

What does Jane do once she comes back inside?</h3>
