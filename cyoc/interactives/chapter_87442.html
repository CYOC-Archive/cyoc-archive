<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Benjamin scrolled through the list of options and found an interesting one; Neanderthal. Ben had always thought cavemen were cool, so he clicked into that option window. Also, Ben was very under-developed for an 18 year old, and thought that being covered in body hair and muscles might be fun for a change. Being impatient, Ben clicked through the options fast without reading them. He did select for himself to be “aware” of the transformation, and chose to keep his mental functioning unaffected. He also chose for the transformation to occur over a 48 hour period, being a fan of slow and gradual transformations.<br />
He felt a tingle pass through his body as he started the transformation. Ben played some video games to pass the time for a few hours. He didn’t notice much, except that his forehead, his limbs, and his back were a little achy or sore. He also found himself feeling a bit more horny than usual. Unimpressed with the changes 4 hours in so far, Ben decided to call it an early night. While he slept, his body was going through a lot of changes. Ben woke up very sore and groggy, and glanced over at his computer. “16 hours into transformation: 33% complete”. He remembered the changes he started last night and bolted out of bed.<br />
As he ran to the mirror, he felt something strange hitting his leg. He glanced down and saw it was his newly enlarged cock flopping against his leg as he ran. “Wow, it has to be 6 inches soft, at least, and it is way thicker too”, Ben thought to himself. Ben also noticed that a thick foreskin had grown back on his head and his whole member seemed a bit darker. Arriving at the mirror, Ben could see the extent of his changes. The first thing that was apparently noticeable was the drastic increase in body hair. Ben had a thick patch of dark brown hair in the center of his chest, and some thick hairs sprouting around his nipples. He had a patch of hair around his slightly more toned abs, with a thick trail spreading down into his boxers. “Whoa, I have chest hair?!” he exclaimed in a deeper and more masculine voice. “Huh, my voice!” said Ben, as he reached up and felt a thick adams apple sticking out of his neck. With his arm raised, Ben could see a thick brown bush of hair sticking out from underneath his arm. He raised his arm and grabbed the bush with his fingers. “Wow”, he said, feeling how long and thick his new armpit hair was. Examining his body, Ben also noticed he had a few stray, but thick, hairs sticking out of his chin and cheeks. Ben’s newly enlarged cock started to harden at the thought of actually having some hair to shave. He also noticed a couple dark hairs scattered on his upper arms and his shoulders. “Wow, if this is only 33%, than I am going to be a furball by the end of this!”. The other changes to his body were less drastic or apparent. Ben did notice that he was a little shorter than usual and his back was hunching over a little bit. His hairy arms did appear to be a little longer and that his forehead seemed to stick out a little bit. He also noticed his eye brows were bushier and he had a little unibrow growing.<br />
All of these changes were making Ben very horny. Just the thought that he was only a 1/3 of the way done was really turning him on. He grabbed his longer and thicker tool and closed his eyes, and began to stroke it with his longer arms. Reaching down, he cupped his balls and realized they felt a lot larger and were covered in thick hair. Probably about the size of jumbo eggs, he thought. While thinking of how primitive, hairy, and devolved he would become, Ben came very quickly with a deep and masculine grunt. It shot out a substantial amount more cum than he could usually produce, and he got it stuck all over his new chest hair. Cleaning himself off, he realized he was sweating and he smelled a little musky. Sticking his nose is his wiry pit bush, he found that he was producing a stronger body odor than usual. “Oh well, if being a little smelly comes with all these awesome changes, that’s fine by me!”, he thought to himself.<br />
Just then, he heard a knock on his door; it was his mother. “Ben, breakfast in 15 minutes”. Ben panicked; he tried to make his newly deepened voice sound like his much higher normal voice. “Be right there!”, he replied in a slightly deeper and gruffer voice than usual, his new thick adams apple bobbing up and down his neck. Thankfully, his mother didn’t notice. “Okay, time to change back I guess; I can’t get caught looking like a hairy stinky ape”. Clicking “revert” and trying to change any other options was to no avail. He kept receiving the same message; “Unable to make any changes or revert to default until the current transformation is complete: time remaining: 35 hours and 35 minutes”.<br />
“Oh God”, Ben thought, “What am I going to do? I’m stuck as a hairy, smelly caveman for the next 35 hours! I can’t be seen like this, and the changes are only going to get more noticeable!”…</p>
