<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;I feel a little funny, Coach,&quot; John groaned as he stood up from the bench he&#39;d been sitting on. A strange tingling sensation was coursing through his body, originating within his chest but quickly spreading to his outer limbs. Feeling a little dizzy, John stumbled forward, resting his head on Coach Ryerson&#39;s shoulder for support.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s okay, John,&quot; Ryerson replied comfortingly, wrapping his hands around his student in an embrace. Coach gently stroked John&#39;s back as he hugged him, and John let himself relax. Ryerson still had his jockstrap around his ankles and his 11 inch member was as hard as ever, despite emptying his load into John mere moments ago. John was still wearing his black boxer briefs, but his own 7 inch erection was exposed from when he had been jerking himself off.<br />
<br />
John slowly started to grow taller as Coach Ryerson continued to caress him. After a moment, John pulled back from Ryerson&#39;s embrace and was surprised to see that the two of them were now the same height, looking Coach directly into his eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Coach?&quot; John asked, but Ryerson silenced any further queries by leaning in and kissing him. John started stroking his cock as he massaged Coach&#39;s tongue with his own, closing his eyes and embracing the feeling of euphoria running through his body. Coach pushed John&#39;s smaller frame against the lockers as they continued to make out. The feeling of Ryerson&#39;s boner pressed up against his stomach made John jerk off even faster.<br />
<br />
John&#39;s shoulders started to broaden as he began to pack on muscle. He had had the toned, lean frame of a runner, but he was starting to look more like a linebacker as his body bulked up. John&#39;s firm and tight ass rounded out as Coach squeezed John&#39;s buns, giving John&#39;s behind some cushioning. John&#39;s legs began to thicken up with muscle as well, losing some of their definition as his calves bulked up.<br />
<br />
Coach Ryerson got down on his knees in front of John, grinning with glee as he watched the changes happening to John&#39;s body. John&#39;s arms started to tone up as his biceps began to bulge out into vein-covered muscles, his forearms also inflating with muscle. Ryerson slid the tip of John&#39;s cock into his mouth, tasting John&#39;s salty precum. Coach was a master at giving blowjobs, and John had to lean back on the lockers behind him for support as Ryerson slid his tongue back and forth along the tip of his dick. John had never felt so horny before, and was amazed at the sensation of his cock growing even harder in Coach&#39;s mouth. As Coach continued to suck him off like a pro, thrusting his head back and forth, John&#39;s cock was rapidly expanding. It grew 4 inches in a matter of seconds, reaching a new length of 11 inches while doubling in thickness. John&#39;s felt his balls drop lower as they also expanded, quickly filling with semen and increasing John&#39;s pleasure tenfold.<br />
<br />
Coach was easily taking in all 11 inches of John&#39;s thick cock, sliding his tongue along the shaft of John&#39;s dick as John moaned in pleasure. John&#39;s moans started to deepen into more manly grunts as his voice matured and his adam&#39;s apple grew more prominent. John&#39;s washboard abs slowly started to smooth over as he started to pack on some additional weight, ending up with a slight belly protruding. His pecs inflated with muscle while also gaining some fat, causing his previously tight pectorals to droop over his belly ever so slightly. John&#39;s pale complexion slowly darkened into golden tan, his smooth skin roughening into a rougher leathery texture. Coarse dark brown hairs grew across John&#39;s body from head to toe; his body was now identical to that of Coach Ryerson&#39;s from the neck down.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m so close, Coach,&quot; John moaned, surprised to find that he couldn&#39;t even recognize his own voice anymore. He didn&#39;t know what was happening to him, but he didn&#39;t care either. John was with Coach Ryerson, the hottest man on the planet, and that was all he cared about.<br />
<br />
As John started to cum, his wavy black hair shortened into a crew cut, lightening to a brownish hue. His facial features began to shift; rounded cheeks gave way to defined cheekbones, sky blue eyes shifted to sea green, his circular jaw squared out. His face began to age rapidly, becoming a facsimile of Coach&#39;s.<br />
<br />
Coach Ryerson wiped the cum off of his face, looking up to see his identical twin staring down at him with a sexy grin. Somehow, his cum had caused his student to become an exact clone of him. He laughed in delight at the thought of using his cum to create even more copies of himself to play around with, stroking his dick at the thought.<br />
<br />
&quot;So,&quot; the new Coach Ryerson asked as he helped the original one back up to his feet, given him a quick kiss on the lips &quot;What should we do now?</p>
