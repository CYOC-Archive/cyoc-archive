<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">While Jimmy J.R, Roxy and Sora were inside watching a movie to pass the time until thhe fireworks began; Oliver and Paul were enjoying the playground that Edward had erected for his son Adam, who was also running up and down the slide. While Dusk was hanging around with his grandfather Michael Proudhoof, his twin sister Dawn was busy getting reamed by their mother Brittany. The Anthro Wolf fury getting tired of Dawn’s cold attitude as she continued to sulk. Everyone paused from their conversation to hear Dawn’s shrieks as Brittany drags her anthro doe cub from next to the shed towards the picnic table.<br />
<br />
“Enough is enough,” Brittany scolding Dawn; “this is supposed to be a fun time with family. So stop trying to ruin it for everyone with your Oscar the Grouch routine!”<br />
“I want to go home,” Dawn pouting as she slumps on the bench looking all huffy; the pink splotches dotting her fur, a punishment for her earlier actions at school prior to summer break.<br />
“No,” Brittany looking at her daughter; “you just want to hide away because you got shamed for doing something foolish. Well that’s not happening,” Brittany looking stern; “your punishment is to remind you not to pull your foolishness, and to stop your lying. So no more hiding for you,” Brittany looking at Dawn; “you will socialize, you will stick it out and most importantly you will get along with your cousin.”<br />
<br />
“Is there a problem,” Denise approaching the frustrated wolf fury; handing her a drink, she watches Brittany sip it as the two head towards the makeshift bar that Jimmy S.R is running while both Edward and Michael fiddle with the fireworks they were setting up.<br />
“Nothing that a frustrated mother can’t handle,” Brittany taking another sip; “this is good, what is it?”<br />
“Sex on the beach,” Jimmy S.R answering as he continues to mix drinks; “you want to try a Screaming Orgasm next?”<br />
“Is this the dirty drink hour,” Alison chuckling at the thought of having multiple of those later tonight; “you going to mix up an orgy next?”<br />
“Russian or Chocolate,” Jimmy S.R grinning from his muzzle as he finishes what looks like a dirty martini for Rachael; “or would you prefer a flaming orgy?”<br />
“Just give me a cosmo,” Alison shaking her feline head at her son-in-law’s dirty drink menu.<br />
“Well your no fun,” Jimmy chuckling as he grabs the vodka and cranberry juice; “I’m going to make a couple of Blow Job shots if anyone is interested.”<br />
“What the hell,” Lucas laughing at the dirty cocktail names; “I’ll try one of those.”<br />
“Don’t be surprised if you get another one later tonight,” Rachael speaking quietly in her mate’s ear; “sex lottery is happening tonight.”<br />
<br />
Lucas turns to look at his anthro lioness mate as she licked her lips hungrily at the thought of getting frisky with multiple partners. Seeing the excitement within her eyes, the wolf fury knew it was going to be an adventurous evening after the fireworks.<br />
“Excuse me,” Bob approaching the couple talking quietly; “what is a sex lottery?”<br />
“Oh you and your mate are in for a treat,” Lucas accepting his shot from Jimmy; “its where we all get together and draw names. Whoever we pull, is who we rut with.”<br />
“And if you pull your mate’s name,” Rachael drinking her dirty martini; “you put the name back and try again.<br />
“So,” Bob looking at the various fury adults looking eager for fireworks and an after party encounter; “so I could pull Alison and…”<br />
“While your mate could pull Michael over there,” Lucas pointing to the anthro stag-deer setting up some canisters; “the purpose of the sex lottery is to have a wild good time.”<br />
“Even if it is a same sex coupling,” Rachael purring; the dirty martini beginning to take effect; “personally I want another go with Denise.”<br />
“You had her the last time we did this,” Lucas chucking; “let someone else catch a tiger by the tail.” Lucas’s last comment even caused Bob Clawfoot to chuckle at the perverted use of an old idiom.<br />
<br />
“Will someone collect the cubs,” Edward getting up from the ground and returning to the milling adults; “we are just about ready for the show.”<br />
“I’ll get them,” Alison heading to her backdoor to collect the three watching t.v; walking inside as Jake looks to see where Dusk and Dawn are at. Noticing that they are sitting at the picnic table he motions for them to come to him while Lucas wrangles his cubs. All walk towards Alison and Jimmy’s side of the back yard just as Jimmy J.R, Roxy and Sora are escorted out. Sora quickly Joins her parents while Roxy sticks with Jimmy J.R just as the first motor lights up and shoots a crimson jet that explodes into a kaleidoscope of sparkles.<br />
<br />
“More,” Roxy jumping as another firework is launched and explodes with a load rapport that all the furys shudder in discomfort.<br />
“Sorry,” Edward shaking his head; “some of them are designed to make big boom that might hurt the ears. This was confirmed as a few more were launched that made more noise than flash. This was followed by a combination of exploding silver and blue that surprised the cubs with a secondary burst of sparkles. Red, blue, green, gold; multiple shades of colors exploded and sparkled into the night sky as the cubs squealed in delight while most of the adults stayed silent enjoying the spectacle.<br />
“Everyone get ready for the grand finale,” Edward grinning as he lights the fuse to a large box. Seconds later multiple motors shoot up into the sky and explode in a chaotic mix of colors; the rapid fire of the rockets lasting only a minute but made for a lasting impacted as along with Roxy, Oliver and Paul were dancing around for more.<br />
<br />
“I think we should have gotten more fireworks,” the fox fury looking at the excited crowd full of content furies.<br />
“I think that was an appropriate amount for the ten minutes it took to fire them off,” Michael responding; picking up his daughter as she looked eager to see more. “we could always get more next year.”<br />
“I think we should all chip in next year,” Lucas steering one of his cubs inside; Rachael doing her best to wrangle the second.<br />
“Are you certain you don’t want to join us,” Edward looking at his daughter and her mate Jimmy S.R; “you are more than welcome to join us for a good rut.”<br />
“No offense dad,” Alison trying to be tactful; “but I don’t want to pull yours or mom’s name and be forced to engage in a potential incestuous sex act.”<br />
“Same here in regards to pulling dad or Jake,” Jimmy answering; “besides, we have our own fun once the cubs are all asleep.”<br />
“Your loss,” Edward sighing before perking up; “Everyone else to my basement! Adam you stay here and be with your big sister and nephew,” the fox fury smiling; “think of it as a sleepover.”<br />
<br />
“Alright you miscreants,” Alison looking at the various cubs that are starting to get sleepy; “some of you are going to be bunking together. That doesn’t mean you get to stay up half the night with horseplay. Go to sleep and in the morning pancakes for breakfast.”<br />
“Who is with who,” Dawn looking around as she knew trying anything now would be a bad idea.<br />
“You and your brother will be together in the guest room with Oliver and Paul,” Alison responding; “Adam and Roxy will be with Jimmy J.R. As for you Sora,” Alison pausing; “any group you want to be with?”<br />
“Can I be with Jimmy,” Sora asking; “I like Dickens and want to snuggle with the cat some more.”<br />
“Alright,” Alison nodding; “everyone to bed, and keep it down.”<br />
“Dawn,” Brittany staring at her daughter; “no funny business. Do I make myself clear?”<br />
“Yes,” the anthro doe cub answering as she follows is half lead to the guest room while watching her cousin enter his bedroom along with Roxy, Adam and Sora.<br />
“We will be checking on you from time to time,” her father speaking; “so don’t think you can pull something tonight.”</p>
