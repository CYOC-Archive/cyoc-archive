<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Bedtime was approaching, and Jeff headed up to his room.  As he walked, he felt an unusual sense of dread.  Amy may now be a part of his family, but she was still his butt.  And though he had no control over her, he could still feel the pressure building at the back of her throat.  Amy seemed comfortable with the idea earlier, but Jeff still felt guilty about what he was about to put her through.<br />
<br />
At the very least, Jeff was glad he had his own bathroom.  There was no concern over his family walking by and hearing the strange conversation that was about to occur.  Though just in case, he did lock both his bedroom door and bathroom door.<br />
<br />
Before getting to Amy, though, first order of business was emptying his bladder.  This part didn&#39;t bother him so much, though it was just a little awkward having someone in there with him while he did his business.  Amy spoke from behind him.  &quot;I&#39;ve never had a male organ, before.  It feels interesting being used.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You can feel this?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course.  I can feel your whole body, even if I can&#39;t control it.  Like I said, my body was merged into yours.  You&#39;re basically peeing from between my front legs.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff couldn&#39;t help but chuckle at the thought, but then he sighed.  &quot;You know what&#39;s coming next, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
Amy smiled.  &quot;Yes, I can feel that, too.  And I am looking forward to it.&quot;<br />
<br />
That put Jeff a little more at ease, though not completely.  Regardless, this was not something either of them could avoid.  Not without making a change with the Chronivac.  And he wasn&#39;t sure the deed could wait until he reinstalled it.<br />
<br />
So Jeff turned around, looking behind himself as Amy positioned her head face-down into the toilet.  Jeff hesitated, wondering if he could at least try to hold it in and reinstall the Chronivac.  But without his command, he felt the muscles in Amy&#39;s throat relax and push the awaiting log into her mouth.  Much like how Amy had control over herself, it seemed that she also had control over Jeff&#39;s bowels.  Jeff was thankful Amy seemed potty-trained.<br />
<br />
For the moment, Amy still had her mouth closed.  Jeff could feel the poop brush across her tongue, and Amy&#39;s face scrunch up a bit as it did.  The poop finished filling her mouth, and she held it in there for a few moments, before opening her mouth and letting it drop into the toilet bowl.  She lifted her head out of the bowl, and pulled the toilet lid down with her chin.  She then pushed her nose against the handle to flush it.<br />
<br />
Jeff was naturally concerned.  &quot;Um... how did it taste?&quot;<br />
<br />
Amy turned to look at Jeff.  The smile was there again, but a little weaker.  &quot;Well... it tasted like poop.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry.  Like I said before, I didn&#39;t know the Chronivac would actually work.  I was just trying out the weirdest options to see where they would lead.  Look, I&#39;ll reinstall the Chronivac and change you back!&quot;<br />
<br />
Amy looked panicked.  &quot;Please don&#39;t!  I... want to stay this way.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why?  It tastes bad, doesn&#39;t it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes.  It is definitely an acquired taste.  But it is a change I am excited for.  You see, I have been in the Chronivac&#39;s simulations for so long, waiting to be called upon for some sort of change.  And I promised myself that whatever change my future user would decide for me, I would accept.  You have gifted me not only with my first change, but one far more creative than I had imagined.  I am fulfilling a purpose nobody else could, and that makes me happy.&quot;  Amy smiled again, this time far more sincere.<br />
<br />
Jeff was conflicted.  This dinosaur had just poured its heart out to her.  Maybe it was because they now both shared a heart, but he found himself feeling the emotion behind her words.  He could tell she really did want this, despite the awfulness of the situation.  After a moment&#39;s thought, he smiled back and pet her on her head.  &quot;Okay.  I promise I will let you stay this way as long as you want.&quot;<br />
<br />
Amy grinned and nuzzled her cheek against his.  &quot;Thank you.  I am so glad to be a part of someone nice like you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Reflexively, Jeff pushed Amy&#39;s face away.  &quot;Ugh!  Sorry, but your breath reeks!  Guess I should probably wipe your mouth.&quot;  Amy giggled at this.<br />
<br />
Jeff turned towards his toilet paper... only to find that the roll was empty.  In fact, not only was there no roll, there was no holder.  Jeff opened the cabinet under his sink, hoping to find a spare roll there.  But there was none.  &quot;Where&#39;s the toilet paper?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Toilet paper?&quot;  Amy thinks for a moment.  &quot;Oh!  Because of the reality change, you do not use toilet paper.  You use the toilet brush.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What???  But I use that to clean the toilet!  Isn&#39;t it, you know, unsanitary to put it in your mouth?&quot;<br />
<br />
Amy giggled.  &quot;My mouth is used to release your poop.  The toilet brush is probably clean by comparison.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If you say so.&quot;  Jeff reached for the toilet brush.  With Amy&#39;s instruction, he scrubbed across her tongue with the brush, rinsing it in the freshly-flushed toilet bowl.  He didn&#39;t know what was weirder: cleaning a dinosaur&#39;s mouth with a toilet brush, or the feeling of a toilet brush on the tongue inside his butt.  He was at least thankful she didn&#39;t have any teeth.  That would&#39;ve made cleaning more complicated.  Repeating the cyle a few times, he finished scrubbing Amy&#39;s mouth clean of any residue poop.<br />
<br />
Following that, Jeff gave Amy a cap-full of mouthwash, both to freshen her breath and ensure her mouth was as clean as possible.  He could feel his transformed butt sloshing the liquid inside her mouth, before spitting it into the toilet bowl, and giving the toilet another flush.  &quot;That tasted a lot better than the poop.  I will look forward to that part of my day especially.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff sighed at this.  &quot;Look, I know you&#39;re okay with staying this way, and I&#39;m gonna let you.  But this is still a bum deal you got, without me asking for permission.  So let me make things better for you.  I can use the Chronivac to make any change you want.  Either to yourself, or to me.  Are there any changes you want me to make?&quot;<br />
<br />
Amy looks at Jeff in surprise, and thinks for a moment.</p>
