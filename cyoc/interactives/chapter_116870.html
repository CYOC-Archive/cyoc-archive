<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">St. Patrick&#39;s Day...<br />
<br />
Joe could hardly have expected his turn of luck. He never anticipated that he&#39;d end up winning a free Animalian conversion during the St. Patrick&#39;s Day celebration. The odds of him winning must have been mind-staggering. And it was a very big surprise to meet the Animalian he was to meet. It was none other than Sabine the spitting cobra, one of the first Animalians to go into advertising by becoming a spokes model for Olay. She still worked with the company, but she was also enrolled in the Animalia Modelling School to better learn how to do her job.<br />
<br />
Sabine was a lot more patient than Joe was expecting. She didn&#39;t insist on transforming Joe immediately. She actually wanted to get to know him better. The two of them chatted for quite a while and even played some games on the Xbox that was in Sabine&#39;s room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow, you&#39;re really good at this,&quot; said Joe as he struggled to keep up with Sabine.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve had plenty of practice,&quot; said Sabine with a smug tone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, for a species that doesn&#39;t even have arms, you&#39;re very good at using them,&quot; said Joe.<br />
<br />
Sabine turned to Joe and asked, &quot;Do you have a problem with my species?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What? No, no, not at all,&quot; said Joe, &quot;I think it would actually be cool to be a cobra, though that&#39;s not the only surprising thing about your species.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What else was a surprise?&quot; asked Sabine.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, when that prize told me to go to the Reptile House, I was kinda expecting to be meeting a lizard of some time instead of-&quot; started Joe.<br />
<br />
&quot;A snake?&quot; asked Sabine. Joe nodded and Sabine looked briefly hurt before saying, &quot;Oh, wait, I get it. Because St. Patrick apparently drove all the snakes out of Ireland.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, just noticing the Irish irony,&quot; said Joe, &quot;So how did you end up being in that Pot o&#39; Gold lottery thing?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I volunteered,&quot; said Sabine, &quot;Yes, the people running the casino were surprised by that too, which I guess it&#39;s more obvious why in hindsight. The thing is that I wasn&#39;t just offering to change a human, I was looking for a mate. And being part of that lottery sounded like a better guarantee to get a mate than going through the dating service.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sounds like you left a lot up to chance,&quot; said Joe.<br />
<br />
Sabine smiled and moved closer to Joe, allowing her breasts encased in her green turtleneck to bump into his chest. &quot;I think I got rather lucky tonight,&quot; she purred.<br />
<br />
Joe perked up at that. This was going to be a very interesting night.<br />
<br />
====================<br />
<br />
About a week later, on another side of the globe...<br />
<br />
Harold and Kirana were heading back to his room in the repurposed airbase right after the luau. Harold was surprising how fast this was going, but then it has been rather tormentingly slow by Animalian standards. The uplifted sea krait had feeling for Harold longer than he should have realized. Perhaps not since the day she was uplifted, but clearly at some point not far from that she feel in love with him. For all his scientific brilliance, he was a fool to not notice that earlier. He was a greater fool for not responding in kind sooner as well. He thought that the two of them needed time to get to know each other first. He was probably right about that, but he might have took too long before realizing they were right for each other.<br />
<br />
Harold led Kirana into his room and said, &quot;Well, it&#39;s not spacious, but it&#39;s cheap.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s room enough for me,&quot; said Kirana, coiling near Harold&#39;s bed, &quot;But more importantly, it&#39;s room enough for US.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re not going to wait any longer, are you?&quot; asked Harold.<br />
<br />
Kirana completely unbuttoned and tossed off her blouse, her bikini top and wrap following soon after. &quot;Does this answer your question?&quot; she asked, hefting up her bare breasts.<br />
<br />
Harold grinned and said, &quot;Well, I think you&#39;ve managed to convince me.&quot; Kirana smiled and leaned for a kiss. Harold pushed her head back and said, &quot;Er, not just yet. You still have very potent venom and I&#39;d rather not be poisoned before I gain a snake&#39;s immunity.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh,&quot; said Kirana a little sheepishly. She thought it over for a moment before rubbing her black nipples until milk started dripping out. &quot;No venom in here,&#39; she said seductively.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think I can work with that,&quot; said Harold before leaning in and latching onto one of Kirana&#39;s nipples. Kirana moaned with pleasure as Harold started drinking her transformative milk.<br />
<br />
====================<br />
<br />
It was a little odd for Joe to be suckling at a snake&#39;s tit, but it certainly beats the possibility of kissing her and getting poisoned. Sabine certainly seemed to like his nursing judging by her moaning. It was a little hard to describe the flavor of her milk. Since reptiles don&#39;t have mammary glands, the breasts on certain Animalians like Sabine was a bit of an oddity. Joe definitely wouldn&#39;t say that Sabine&#39;s milk tasted like cow milk or goat milk. It had an odd tang to it and yet its texture was just as creamy. But even if it was a lot different from any other milk Joe had tasted before, he still drank with eagerness.<br />
<br />
Sabine ran her fingers through Joe&#39;s hair as he nursed from her breast. The large breasts she grew when she was uplifted were very strange to her at first and she wondered why women would want them. But now she was fully understanding the pleasure that came with them. As she ran her fingers through Joe&#39;s hair, he could feel it getting shorter. That wasn&#39;t that much of a surprise. People had a chance of losing their hair when they changed into a reptile or amphibian, males having a larger chance than females. But of more interest to Sabine was the feeling of Joe&#39;s head flattening and widening. She pulled Joe&#39;s head away from her breast to take a good look at him. It was clear she was holding him by what was the beginning of his cobra&#39;s hood. His mouth was already starting to extend from his face as his nose was fading away to two slit nostrils. His pupils were already contracting into slits.<br />
<br />
====================<br />
<br />
Kirana helped Harold out of his clothes. She was very eager to see him transform. His skin was already turning paler and a little dryer. Kirana ran a hand down his chest and felt the forming scales under her fingers. Harold was certainly interested to observe his shifting form. His legs were currently going through the most intensive change. It had started with a loss of feeling in his feet as they flatted, the toes melting together into a thin rounded end. His legs weakened as they lost their rigidity. Kirana helped him sit on the bed before Harold could collapse. Harold&#39;s thighs were pressing tighter together as the divide between them was disappearing. Already his kneecaps were losing form as they became more vertebrate in Harold&#39;s extending flexible spine.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re coming along quite nicely,&quot; said Kirana with approval.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t...describe how peculiar this feels,&quot; said Harold.<br />
<br />
&quot;I imagine it would be,&quot; said Kirana before a mischievous look appeared on her face, &quot;Ooh, what do we have here?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What? What do you-&quot; asked Harold before letting out a hiss of pleasure as Kirana grasped his erect penis.<br />
<br />
====================<br />
<br />
Joe hissed with growing arousal as Sabine rubbed his dick. The hissing part was actually involuntary as his mouth continued to change. His teeth became a lot sharper and fewer in number as some disappeared. What grew in particular were his incisors which were becoming sharp fangs. They also became hollow as new channels opened to connect to his growing venom glands. The fangs had a tiny hole in the front of them for injected venom. But instead of being small and round like most cobras&#39;, the holes in Joe&#39;s fangs were slits that could spray out his venom. His tongue was also becoming a lot slimmer as a fork appeared at the end of it.<br />
<br />
Sabine was paying particular interest to Joe&#39;s dick as she rubbed it. It was getting longer in her grasp as well as thicker, much thicker. It swelled out from side to side, becoming more than a handful for her. Then she felt a fission in the middle of it, spreading lengthwise along the length. She rubbed his dick with more vigor, encouraging it to grow more. With a slight pop, it split in two in her hands. She continued to rub both of them as they grew longer and more pointed at the end. Before long, Joe had a proper serpentine hemipenis. In contrast, his ball sack had shrank as it pushed into his fused thighs. As Joe&#39;s dick completed its mitosis, his balls disappeared completely from view. But that didn&#39;t mean they vanished. On the contrary, now that his testicles were interior, they swelled even larger, building up a large storage of semen that was as potent as his venom.<br />
<br />
The rest of Joe&#39;s body was completing its metamorphosis. The fingernails on his fingers were replaced by reptilian claws, his legs finished merging together as they stretched out into a complete tail, his hood was spread wide, crowning the serpentine head he now possessed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ooh, you&#39;re an impressive specimen,&quot; said Sabine with approval.<br />
<br />
Joe flexed his slightly-thicker arms and said, &quot;I haven&#39;t even had my sssecond dossse.&quot; He paused and frowned with annoyance at the hissing sound he made.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ll be able to speak without hissing eventually,&quot; said Sabine, &quot;It took me a while to get used to. Now about your second dose...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, you weren&#39;t giving a double handjob for no reassson,&quot; said Joe.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, but I have a confession to make first,&quot; said Sabine, &quot;There&#39;s a particular reason I&#39;m looking for a mate. I&#39;ve entered my reproductive cycle, what mammals would call their heat. I&#39;m not just seeking a mate to bond to, but someone to give me eggs to lay. Joe, if you&#39;d rather not be bonded like this, I understand. I&#39;ll just give you a second dose and you can go. I won&#39;t force you into being in a relationship with me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Joe thought long about this. On one hand, he barely knew Sabine which would be enough to make most people leery about getting into a relationship, let alone that involved babies. He wasn&#39;t sure if he could support a family, but then Sabine made plenty of money with her modeling career. But was Joe responsible enough? And yet, Joe felt a strong desire for Sabine. Part of it was his new mating instincts recognizing a female in heat in front of him. But he could also see that Sabine was a very kind soul that he could feel comfortable with being bonded to for the rest of his life. The thought of eggs was starting to entice him and raising hatchlings didn&#39;t seem so terrible.<br />
<br />
Mistaking his silence for a denial, Sabine sighed and said, &quot;Well, I&#39;ll just give you your second dose then I&#39;ll-&quot;<br />
<br />
Joe gently cupped Sabine&#39;s jaw chin and pointed her face up towards him. &quot;I don&#39;t want you to leave,&quot; he said, &quot;I&#39;m not sssure if it&#39;sss sssmart, but I think I do want to ssstart a family with you.&quot; With that, he gently kissed her on the lips.<br />
<br />
Sabine quickly responded, becoming more passionate as she wrapped her arms and tail around Joe. When her opening slit slid against Joe&#39;s hemipenis, Joe pulled back a bit. He indicated the nearby bed and Sabine nodded. Helping Joe slither for the first time, she guided him towards the bed. Sabine laid down on the bed first, using one hand to open her slit more. Joe slithered on top of her and got ready to lower into her. However, he was having trouble getting both heads into her slit. Sabine reached down and gently grasped his shafts, pushing them together. Then she guided him down until his two heads were past her lower lips. With a grunt, Joe shoved all the way, cause both him and Sabine to let out a hiss. Once Joe was fully in, he started pulling back, but pushed back in before his shafts could separate too far.<br />
<br />
====================<br />
<br />
Kirana moaned with pleasure as Harold pounded into her. He was as sexy a sea krait as she could have hoped for. Kirana was glad that Harold didn&#39;t completely lose his hair. She wondered if their children would inherit his hair. She could imagine combing their daughter&#39;s long hair. A surge of pleasure brought Kirana back to the present. Harold was definitely putting his double dicks to good use. Her snatch was wrapped tightly around them as they thrust into her. She could almost imagine they were growing larger.<br />
<br />
Then Kirana realized they did feel like they were growing. She looked up at Harold and noticed a change in him. His upper body had improved with his change, but she could see it was getting bigger still. His muscles were growing larger and more defined, his shoulders expanding more to contain them. &quot;Harold, you&#39;re growing,&quot; said Kirana with surprise.<br />
<br />
Harold paused briefly and said, &quot;It&#39;s the effect of a double dose. Animalians get more fit when they&#39;ve been exposed to the virus twice. They also get older or younger depending on their initial age.&quot; He smiled at her and said, &quot;Your body is improving as well.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kirana looked down at herself and noticed there were some changes. Her body was in good shape before, but now her muscles were growing. They weren&#39;t becoming bulky, but they were gaining a lot more definition than they had before. Most noticeable was that her breasts were growing larger than before. Kirana touched her stomach, feeling the hardening abs on it. &quot;I wasn&#39;t expecting this,&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
&quot;It just makes you more beautiful,&quot; said Harold before he thrust with more vigor.<br />
<br />
====================<br />
<br />
Sabine was moaning loudly as Joe thrust harder into her. His sculpted torso and thick, muscular arms were really turning her on. Of course, she was a bit more muscular as well now, along with a bigger rack. Part of her wondered if Olay would like her changes but it was overshadowed by the strong mating instinct she was in the midst of. She was pushing back against Joe, feeling his dual dicks drill into her. She was getting too close. She needed his seed, she needed his eggs. She wrapped tightly around him as she felt herself clench more strongly than before.<br />
<br />
The two of them let out a loud hiss as the dam burst. Joe&#39;s internalized balls expanded before firing a double load of serpent semen deep into Sabine&#39;s thirsty womb. The two of them bucked a bit, making sure every drop was going into her. Eventually, they laid down and rested. Sabine could practically feel her eggs beginning to form. She hugged Joe close and asked, &quot;Are you ready to become a father? Will you truly be my mate?&quot;<br />
<br />
Joe smiled back at her and said, &quot;Of course, but on one condition: I want to change my name.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sabine gave him a confused look. &quot;YOUR name?&quot; she asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, &#39;Joe&#39; is such a normal, boring name and I&#39;m anything but normal and boring now,&quot; said Joe, flexing an arm and showing off his larger bicep.<br />
<br />
Sabine stroked his arm and said, &quot;You certainly aren&#39;t now. So what do you plan to call yourself?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I was thinking...maybe Bazooka,&quot; said Joe.<br />
<br />
Sabine giggled and said, &quot;Bazooka? Why would you call yourself that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s from one of my favorite comics,&quot; said &#39;Joe&#39;, &quot;Besides, now I have massive guns and I can shoot a really big load now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sabine smiled and kissed him gently. &quot;I can&#39;t argue with that, Bazooka.&quot;<br />
<br />
====================<br />
<br />
Kirana and Harold coiled together on his bed, sleeping off their excessive mating spree. Kirana felt more at peace than ever. She finally had the mate of her dreams. She knew her place would always be with Harold. Nothing she could think of could make her feel happier. But there was something that would soon bring the two of them joy. Inside Kirana, Harold&#39;s seed was finding fertile ground. A biological chain reaction was beginning, slowly building up into what will be Kirana and Harold&#39;s first clutch of eggs.</p>
