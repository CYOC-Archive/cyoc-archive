<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Romeo was your little more than average guy on the appearence, somebody that seemed reliable to anyone and even clever, but never got his chance to shine. Or better to say he got multiple chances to shine, but he never took them, and even though he was probably worth them he let them go away, for the sake of others at first, and then for no reason at all. Even now at college he decided not to study too much, keeping a little more than average score, too much attached to his old life style. He never even had a girlfriend, just like his two best friends. But the time for something a bit extraordinary into his life was going to come. <br />
<br />
Romeo had to pass the last three exams of the school year, and was staying at his grandaunt&#39;s place for the time being. He always thought his aunt&#39;s place was strange, full of dusty paintings and dolls all around the flat, which wasn&#39;t already very big, just a bedroom, a bathroom, a living room and a kitchen. He thought he&#39;d sleep in the living room, on the sofa, but his aunt just wouldn&#39;t let him, she was way too nice. His grandaunt wasn&#39;t an average old woman, she always told him ghosts existed in a castle were she lived, that memaids really do exist and sailors usually choose their path in order to avoid them and so on. He always listened to her carefully and hoped her stories were true, but deep down inside himself he couldn&#39;t bring himself to believe them for real. How could magic really exist without anyone noticing it? Or maybe was he the only one who never saw any of it? <br />
<br />
Anyway it was his first night there, and he couldn&#39;t really bring himself to sleep, he turned on a lamp and started taking a look at the surrondings. A doll took his attention, since it was one he never saw in his aunts&#39; apartment before, even though he had been there lots of times. It was clearly a typical flamenco spanish female dancer, with a really nice red dress on, and a body that seemed awesome even for a doll. He looked intensely at the doll and thought &quot;Man, if I were a girl like this life would be much much easier, no worries about getting girls, guys would do everything for me, I&#39;d ace all my exams and could live my life Hakuna Matata style... I really wish I could be like that sometimes...&quot; then he started shaking the head. That could never be, nothing could make it happen, right? So he tried to sleep again, and after a while he landed to the realm of dreams...<br />
<br />
The next morning he woke up as usual early, he had to study a lot, so at 7:00 am the alarm was up. His boxers fit really strangely on him, but he didn&#39;t care much about that as he turned off the alarm. He stretched a bit and in front of his eyes fell some hair, that brought his attention to his new breasts. He freaked out a bit, but didn&#39;t scream, maybe his aunt was still sleeping. &quot;What the fuck happened???&quot; he thought. He rushed to the bathroom to look at his face in the mirror: he had the same face of the flamenco dancer doll! Nice soft black hair, dark eyes, full lips, perfect nose not an imperfection! The mirror was small, so he couldn&#39;t see anything but his face, but he could guess some things... His height seemed not much changed, he was never that tall, he was 164cm, and maybe he now was even a bit taller, like 169cm! In the bathroom there was a libra, and weighed himself, even though he had become taller he was much less muscular in certain places, and from 64kg he went to 57! Even though he did gain some weight in some places... like the two breasts he now had! They had to be D cups at least! He fondled them a bit, and they felt too good... Too bad he couldn&#39;t properly check his butt, but he clearly was getting excited. He could try so many things. That&#39;s when it hit him. <br />
No one knew this girl, he was living at his aunt&#39;s place, and he had no ID or clothes. The only thing he could think to work it out was to ask her grandaunt for some advises, hoping she&#39;d believe him.</p>
