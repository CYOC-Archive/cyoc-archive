<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff blinked as some form of reality emerged from the light, walls similar to his room coming into focus, and for a moment he thought the world was back to normal, until his eyes glimpsed a window.<br />
<br />
The sky was almost completely black, no stars, and no sun. Only a faintly glowing moon illuminating the world, and at that point he realized just how much of reality was missing by simplifying down the reality options to only a single planet.<br />
<br />
Looking back to his screen, he saw that the time was somehow &quot;morning&quot;, being only 10:00AM. But as the created reality settled in, the chronivac reopened its subject tabs, showing his mother&#39;s name Lauren, his sister&#39;s name Rosie, and a feminized version of his own; calling him &quot;Jessie&quot;. A fact that made him wonder, but he was more relieved that his mother and sister were alive, or at least recreated... and slowly more concerned about the fact he didn&#39;t seem to have a present father.<br />
<br />
He then noticed that all three entries had a species different than human in them, and he gulped, and looked slowly down at himself.<br />
<br />
Looking down, &#39;he&#39; saw a flat crotch first, a small vaginal slit nestled between it, and her skin around it was covered in pale pinkish scales, framed by thighs scaled on the inner edge but covered in a pale blue pelt of fur on the outer edge and going down her legs, which shifted to a more canine appearance from the knee down. The scales seemed to cover most of her front, with her sides covered in the fur and she imagined so was her back; however she didn&#39;t seem to have much in the way of breasts, seeming to have nipples and a puffy bit of flesh beneath them as she touched them with pawed hands, but they didn&#39;t seem big enough to need a bra, even as she felt a tiny bit of moisture from the tip of one nipple, a great contrast to her wide childbearing hips and soft round butt.<br />
<br />
From her slouched back position, she could see her tail poking out from between her legs, its underside was scaled, but its fluffy top gave more of a wolf-like appearance. And after a bit of a pat down of the bits she couldn&#39;t easily see, she found that her face matched the doglike facets, with tiny horn tips poking out of the hair on the back of her head; while her back seemed to have a couple of tiny bat-like wings she couldn&#39;t believe would be able to lift her up.<br />
<br />
With her self examination sorted enough for her tastes, given she didn&#39;t feel like exploring her depths just yet; she turned back to her computer, and read the species name... &quot;Kobold&quot;... In Jeff&#39;s mind, a bit of an odd twist on the East vs West ideas on the species, of dog vs dragon... But it didn&#39;t really explain anything else... Yet curious, she clicked on a little icon next to the listed species that seemed like an info panel.<br />
<br />
Species: Kobold<br />
Natural Lifespan: ~1200 years<br />
Gender Ratio: 100% Female, 0% Male<br />
Reproduction: Single parent reproduction, triggered by sexual climax.<br />
Average height: 3&#39;6 (Imperial) / 1 meter <br />
Classification: Proto-mammalian reptile, draconic variant.<br />
Ovulation cycle: 1 month, 6 to 12 eggs.<br />
Pregnancy Cycle/Hatch Cycle: 1 week carrying, 4 months to hatch.<br />
<br />
The rest of the details seemed to be even more excessively technical... But the bit she focused on did make her realize... She doesn&#39;t have a father, and even if her father still existed in this reality, he&#39;d be a girl like she was, and he&#39;d be completely unrelated to her... Though maybe if her mother needed help raising the kids, then he&#39;d be in their lives.<br />
<br />
… Then again … Maybe she had more sisters in this reality than just Rosie, they do have more than 6 eggs at once... But if so, where would they be? Who is raising them?<br />
<br />
Suddenly she felt a pair of soft padded hands begin to massage her barely budding breasts, pinching her nipples, making her let out a small whine that trailed off into a moan. Her own voice sounding familiar and foreign to herself at the same time, but Rossie&#39;s giggle in response on the other hand sounded a lot more like her, if more mischievous.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on sis, how can you grow a nice round pair of melons if you don&#39;t give them attention?&quot; She heard Rossie say, &quot;or are you afraid of laying eggs?&quot;<br />
<br />
Before Jeff, or rather Jessie, knew what was going on, her chair was spun around to face Rossie, looking a lot like herself but with an underside more purple than pink, a pair of breasts that could actually be called such as small as they were, and with a plume of purple hair on her head tied in a pony tail; and she drew a shape of light in the air in front of Jess with a claw and tapped it in the space between her would-be breasts, and she soon felt a heat spreading through her, concentrating itself in her loins.<br />
<br />
She panted, feeling a deep need as Rosie leaned in to lick the moisture of lite cream from her nipples, barely getting a sip as she sucked each one; and gave an evil grin as she pulled away. &quot;So disappointing, your milk tastes so good, but you make so little of it... We&#39;ll have to just settle for the egg money&quot;.<br />
<br />
Jess barely had time to react as Rosie stuck her tongue between Jessie&#39;s folds, and every nerve in her body seemed to catch fire, driving her spasming into an unexpected climax as she was left overstimulated by a mere touch that Rossie wouldn&#39;t ease up on, not until Jess instinctually swatted her away as the pain of that overstimulation set in.<br />
<br />
Rossie made a coy look, even as Jess glared at her. &quot;It&#39;s not my fault you&#39;re so sensitive Jess, but look on the bright side, maybe this time you&#39;ll have some eggs for child resources... After all, mom and her girlfriend can&#39;t be the only ones making money around here.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jessie let out a restrained hiss. &quot;Give me one good reason not to get back at you for this,&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
Rosie patted a bulge in her stomach, and made a coy smile. &quot;Because I already did it to myself... Sorry, Jess, if I knew you were eager to see me filled with eggs, I&#39;d have asked you to help.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jess huffed as Rossie skipped off. Still, she did pick up a couple of things from this encounter... First, maybe her father was still around, albeit as a girl now... But second... It seemed like Rosie kept referencing some kind of service that pays citizens who lay eggs for letting them have the eggs, and likely the resulting children... Which might explain why it was only her and Rossie being raised by her mom.<br />
<br />
She still fumed with frustration that her sister had managed to use her newness to this new body against her to make her climax... And probably make her pregnant, as she shuddered at the thought... But soon, she found herself thinking about that light that her sister drew with a claw... Was that magic?<br />
<br />
She found herself looking out the window and realizing how little she knew about this world, apparently sunless and perhaps the only world in this universe... She started to notice glowing trees outside, and motes of glowing pollen drifting up from equally luminous grass.<br />
<br />
She shook off the weirdness and sighed... If she wanted to know more about this world, she&#39;d have a lot of work to do... She could of course try to fix this world, but the reality options were still overwhelming, and she wasn&#39;t keen to try that again, and she wasn&#39;t sure if she could even just turn everyone human, since for all she knew humans might not be able to survive on this world.<br />
<br />
She sat staring at her computer, finding herself staring at a search bar trying to figure out if there was something specific about this world she wanted to know...</p>
