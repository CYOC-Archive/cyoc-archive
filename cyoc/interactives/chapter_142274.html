<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff spent an uncountable amount of time happy and free in his new form, basking in the patches of sun as they swept the forest floor or soaking in fresh cold water when it rained. Sticky, sweet nectar flowed in a slow but constant trickle from the pistil of the enormous flower on his back. It attracted insects, birds and even small animals from throughout the forest, who came to Jeff to get a meal in exchange for the pollen they brought with them on their coats and skins. The pollination had made Jeff ripen over time. His body now rested upon the ground on what had once been his stomach. It was now more of a torso-shaped melon with four vines coming out of it. The only real sign of who Jeff had once been was his still human head; if Jeff pulled his flower into his mouth and if you ignored the fact that he was green, his face looked almost normal.<br />
<br />
It was the animals and insects that first alerted him something was wrong. He was enjoying another day of feeding the forest, his juicy body quivering gently as hummingbirds delicately brushed his stamens with their wings while they sipped his nectar, when suddenly all of them fled, along with some nearby squirrels and robins. He soon realized why as he heard a pair of feet tromping through the forest. After so long alone with only the sounds of nature, the noise was grating and harsh.<br />
<br />
A young man with brown hair, skin and eyes walked into the small clearing where Jeff was planted. He froze when he saw Jeff, and his eyes widened. Jeff stared back, equally terrified. What would the human do to him? He was completely vulnerable like this... and so juicy and delicious...<br />
<br />
The man stepped closer to Jeff. &quot;Can you understand me?&quot; he said uncertainly.<br />
<br />
Jeff&#39;s eyes widened and he nodded.<br />
<br />
The man thought. &quot;Are you human? That is... were you once?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff nodded again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is the person who did this to you still nearby?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff hesitated, but decided to be truthful and nodded.<br />
<br />
The man jumped back, then turned so his back was to Jeff. He surveyed the forest, hand on his sword hilt, but after a few moments turned back to Jeff, still looking wary.<br />
<br />
&quot;My name is Arden, and I&#39;m an adventurer. I&#39;m here to help. Do you need me to fight the person who did this to you to break the spell?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff shook his head emphatically no.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is there something I can do to break it for you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff shook his head.<br />
<br />
The adventurer looked shaken. &quot;Surely there&#39;s something... I could bring a cleric, or a witch...&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff just shook his head again, then looked up at the adventurer and smiled calmly.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re okay with this?&quot; Jeff nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you... like this?&quot; Jeff nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait... did you do this to yourself?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff grinned, the tip of his mouth flower peeking from between his lips, and nodded.<br />
<br />
Arden stared at him for a long time, his face a mix of emotions - and Jeff couldn&#39;t help but notice that Arden&#39;s pants kept tenting away from him too. <br />
<br />
Then Arden leaned in close and said, &quot;Do you regret it?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff shook his head rapidly.<br />
<br />
The adventurer was breathing hard now. &quot;Can I touch you? Your body, I mean?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff grinned and nodded, his mouth flower peeking out in anticipation.<br />
<br />
Arden stood and walked around to Jeff&#39;s side. He reached in slowly and gingerly poked at Jeff&#39;s skin; when nothing bad happened he gently touched Jeff&#39;s shoulder, drawing his fingertips across Jeff&#39;s back toward his flower. Jeff&#39;s skin was cool and smooth, more like a melon&#39;s skin than human skin. &quot;Your skin looks beautiful in the sunlight,&quot; murmured Arden, almost hypnotized. &quot;It changes tones in the sunlight.&quot;<br />
<br />
Arden continued running his hand down Jeff&#39;s body, down along his side beneath Jeff&#39;s back flower. Jeff was big and round now. His butt, hips and stomach had all swollen out together into one big rounded protrusion on his back half, with only a slight, gentle cleft showing where his buttocks had once been. He stayed round up to around where his pecs had once been, where he began to narrow back down, leading up to his shoulders which were only slightly bigger than they had been before his transformation. It didn&#39;t bother him; he was proud of how juicy his back half was and was sure with enough pollination the rest of him would round out as well.<br />
<br />
Arden reached Jeff&#39;s backside, running his fingertips down the cleft that had once been Jeff&#39;s buttcrack. &quot;You must&#39;ve had a great ass...&quot; Arden said dreamily. &quot;I mean... you still do, but... in a different way.&quot; He leaned in and drew his tongue up Jeff&#39;s buttcrack, making Jeff squeal and quiver in a way he hadn&#39;t since he&#39;d first transformed.<br />
<br />
Arden continued up Jeff&#39;s other side, but now he wasn&#39;t trailing his fingers; he was using both hands, and occasionally his mouth, to pleasure Jeff&#39;s firm fruit hide as he went. Jeff was only able to make a soft squeaky moaning noise and wriggle his heavy melon body around, but his helplessness only gave his pleasure a more delicate edge.<br />
<br />
There was only one place Arden hadn&#39;t explored. He slowly worked his way up Jeff&#39;s other side until he reached the top of Jeff&#39;s back, and the flower proudly splayed there. He didn&#39;t even hesitate; he buried his face in the flower, lapping up the sweet, delicious nectar that dribbled down Jeff&#39;s firm, erect pistil as Jeff squirmed silently, his mouth flower now firmly extended and blocking any sound that he might have made. After a minute Jeff heard a familiar wet smacking sound and realized Arden was pleasuring himself as he pleasured Jeff; Jeff only wished he had some way to return the favor.<br />
<br />
Arden kept it up for what felt like hours before finally groaning loudly; Jeff could feel the gooey splatter of cum hit his side and dribble down, leaving a tiny trail of warmth down his rind.<br />
<br />
Arden came around to Jeff&#39;s front and knelt down to stare Jeff in the eyes. &quot;I&#39;ve decided. I want to...&quot;</p>
