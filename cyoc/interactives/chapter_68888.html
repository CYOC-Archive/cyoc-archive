<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Nick was unsure of what she staring at. Before he was a young man that she swore she should know but was unable to figure out who he was and how she knew him. Next to him was a young girl of about four years old. Peering closer, Nick realised that it was herself that she was looking at. Glancing down, she nearly screeched in alarm when it came to her attention that she had no body and that she was some sort of ghost.<br />
<br />
Looking up, confused, Nick reached out for the girl she knew to be herself, but found herself hesitating and instead reached for the young man, calling out, &quot;Mister? Mister? Do I know you?&quot; as she did so.<br />
<br />
To her surprise the  young man and her double began to meld together. Within moments, the two had become one and what she was looking at was the young man. Confused, she called out, &quot;Mister? Where am I?&quot; and then began to move closer, wondering if maybe the girl who looked like her might be behind the young man.<br />
<br />
But before she could take another step, the young man began to change. His hair, brown in colour, lightened a couple shades and took on a blonde hue in some places. The young man's clothes started to shift as his hair stopped growing just past his shoulders. Seconds ticked by and soon, as the young man's muscle mass dropped and his chest and stomach began to push out, Nick found herself looking at a woman a couple years old then the young man, wearing a pair of black stretch pants, an over-sized white tank-top and a white button-up shirt that had no buttons to fasten.<br />
<br />
Giggling out, &quot;You're going to be a mommy,&quot; Nick suddenly felt everything shift.<br />
<br />
Her thoughts shifted and matured and placing a hand over her swollen belly, she realised that it was her that was going to be a mother as she felt the life growing within her body stir. Not fully understanding how it was she had become the transforming man, but knowing that somehow he had been her at one point, Nick lifted up the hem of her tank-top and stared at her swollen belly, knowing that what was growing within her was a baby girl. After a couple seconds, she lifted the tank-top a bit high and stared at her swollen breast, knowing that they were normally a B cup, but had gone up a full cup size.<br />
<br />
Dropping the tank-top down a bit, she ran a hand over her belly and then slowly placed it down the front her stretch pants, suddenly confused about something. Touching the bare flesh, her mind telling her how uncomfortable underwear had become, Nick muttered, &quot;Shouldn't I be a boy,&quot; but found herself torn between the pride about how she was going to be a mother in a couple months, how it was that she had somehow become a girl and if she wanted to be a girl or return to be a boy.<br />
<br />
As Nick attempted to sort out her thoughts and what it was that she wanted, to be a boy or to be a girl, it suddenly dawned on her that she was a lesbian and that her pregnancy was the result of artificial insemination and the first that didn't result in twins or more.<br />
<br />
But before she could dwell to much on it, Nick felt a strange twinge start in her stomach and move up and down her body. Running a hand over her belly, Nick watched as her clothes began to change. As her button-up shirt and tank-top shifted into a tight, white t-shirt, her stomach slowly flattened and her breast dropped a full cup. While the black stretch pants shifted into a pair button-fly pants and a pair of underwear formed, Nick thought that if she could find a mirror, she was sure that she would look like she did when she was about nineteen, maybe twenty. But at the same time found herself confused because she kept thinking that at age nineteen or twenty, she had been male.<br />
<br />
And then another twinge went through her body and knowing that it meant that her body was about to transform again, Nick asked herself, &quot;Am I to become older or younger?&quot;<br />
<br />
Looking down still, she watched as her chest shrank another cup and then flattened out altogether. Deciding that younger and wonder how much, Nick watched as her shirt and pants fused together into one article and then began to change colour as a frilly piece began to form around the waist line. Finding herself wearing the romper she had loved to wear when she had been four, but confused at the same time because she was sure that she had been a boy at age four, Nick looked at her arms and legs, watching as some of the baby fat she had lost grew back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Heather!&quot; she suddenly called out as she sat up, looking wildly about, not knowing who she was or where she was.<br />
<br />
Glancing down, seeing the pink romper she was wearing, it suddenly all came back to her. Muttering, &quot;My name is Nicki and I am not a girl,&quot; failing to realise that she had just addressed herself by a girl's name, Nicki wondered where it was Heather might be, knowing that just because she looked like the older the girl when she had been four couldn't possibly mean that she was Heather, age four.<br />
<br />
Her thoughts fluttering about as the confusion she was feeling continued to grow, Nicki looked about the semi-dark room and after a moment, slid out of bed, disliking the way the romper rode up and hugged her crotch as she did so. Calling out, &quot;Heather?&quot; she wandered across the room, rubbing a fist in her eye and noting the stacks of boxes as she moved across the room. Opening the door to the hallway, she called out, &quot;Heather?&quot; as she heard something that she couldn't really identify coming from somewhere within the house.<br />
<br />
Moving slowly through the house, Nicki realised that the noise she was hearing was coming from outside and sliding open the patio door, she called out, &quot;Heather?&quot; to which a young male voice immediately told her, &quot;Leave me alone. I don't want you to see me like this.&quot;<br />
<br />
As she stepped out onto the patio, something on the other side of the patio moved and calling out, &quot;Wait,&quot; Nicki dashed toward it.<br />
<br />
Catching up, she reached out and touched what she could now see was a young boy of about seven years old. Asking, &quot;Heather?&quot; she tried to get in front of the young boy, whom her mind was telling her was her older brother and asking, &quot;What happened,&quot; Nicki suddenly found herself thrust to the ground as the yelled, &quot;I said don't look at me,&quot; and then took off across the yard and into the bushes that separated the backyard she Nicki was in from the the neighbours yard.<br />
<br />
Sitting on the patio where she fallen, Nicki looked in the direction the boy had disappeared and after a moment, asked aloud, &quot;What is going on?&quot;</p>
