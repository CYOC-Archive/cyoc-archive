<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Despite her diaper being bizarrely comfortable, Leah didn&#39;t want to spend another second in the filthy thing. She reached her hands down and...paused. What was she supposed to do again? While never changing a diaper herself, Leah always figured it was a simple enough process. Looking at it now, though, made her question that simplicity. She guided her hands over the waist, sure something in the design will pop out to her as obvious, but it still looked incomprehensible. She stared at it intensely until she realized she was sucking her thumb again. Ripping it out, she noticed she was staring at her diaper for almost 10 minutes without any progress. Frustrated and a little concerned, she decided to try and brute force it. Jamming her fingers into the sides, she pushed with all her might. However, no matter how much she tried, she couldn&#39;t even strain it. It&#39;s like all her strength just disappears the moment she touches the damn thing. After a full half hour of nothing save for falling on her ass, she called it quits. For whatever reason, the diaper was just not coming off.<br />
&quot;Damn it, did Tina get some kind of super diaper just for me? Tsk, of course she did. Whatever, I can deal with this later.&quot; More disgruntled than anything else, she headed downstairs for breakfast. If Rita was surprised by the loaded diaper, she didn&#39;t show it. Still, Leah was more than a little self conscious of the thing just hanging there out in the open for any to see, stinking up the place.<br />
&quot;I think Tina got some fancy, super glue diaper or something. Couldn&#39;t get it off.&quot; <br />
&quot;Oh? Do you need a change?&quot;<br />
Leah felt a little frustration at the patronizing response.<br />
&quot;No, I just need to know how to take this off!&quot;<br />
Rita gave her a funny look, along with a coy smile.<br />
&quot;Well, I&#39;m certain I could try. Do you want a change before breakfast? Because I don&#39;t think I can stand that smell for too long.&quot;<br />
Leah scoffed in offense.<br />
&quot;Hey, it&#39;s not that bad! It barely even smells!&quot;<br />
Once again, Rita gives her that funny look, and she feels angry and a little embarrassed. With a roll of her eyes, she groans.<br />
&quot;Fine. If you know how to get this off, then give it a try.&quot;<br />
Rita let out a sigh of relief, making Leah&#39;s face grow redder. As they moved to the changing table, she tried to subtly smell her diaper again. No matter how hard she focused on it, though, she just couldn&#39;t smell anything other than poop. Not, like, BAD poo-poo. Just...normal poop? Leah wasn&#39;t quite sure she had the words for it, but she knew Rita was definitely exaggerating. Approaching the table, Leah tried to jump on, but found she had a bit of trouble; she got on so awkwardly, that she couldn&#39;t really get a grip. She made it half way up before she started to slip and fall, saved as Rita picked her up and laid her down on the changing table with ease. The action was so embarrassing, she felt like she needed to justify it.<br />
&quot;I-I&#39;m not used to having such a poopy diaper. It must&#39;ve been weighing me down.&quot; Leah explained.<br />
&quot;Uh huh.&quot; Rita replied with the same knowing smile. Leah decided to keep her mouth shut, and not further embarrass herself. <br />
Expecting some kind of crazy hidden layering (or solvent, or even scissors) needed to remove her impenetrable diaper, she was completely gob smacked when Rita simply reached down and popped the diaper open with the easy of opening a wrapper. <br />
&quot;H-how did you do that?&quot; Leah asked in disbelief, trying to rely in her head the woman&#39;s hand movements.<br />
&quot;I just opened the flags, Leah.&quot; The woman replied with amusement. The action was so easily down, that Leah kept any thoughts to herself. She already showed herself as clumsy, she didn&#39;t want to show herself as incompetent too. <br />
After the change was done, Leah felt a sense of relief to finally be out of her own filth. She sat down in the kitchen where Rita had already laid out some pancakes and poured her orange juice. Happy and hungry at the display, she wasted no time in gobbling down the pancakes. She tried using her fork and knife to cut it into pieces, but something about the utensils seemed off. She had a hard time using them in any efficient manner. She&#39;d cut too hard, scraping across the plate and splattering syrup everywhere, or find it impossible to get a piece of pancake on the tiny end of her fork. She got remarkably close to cutting herself, getting a gasp of alarm from Rita. Frustration only growing, she put the utensils down and just used her hands like when she was a kid. The pancakes quickly disappeared, but left Leah&#39;s face and hands covered in syrup.<br />
A little offput by how messy she was, she reached for the glass of orange juice. However, she underestimated it&#39;s position and ended up knocking it over, spilling the juice all over the table.<br />
&quot;Oh, Leah! Just wait right there!&quot; Rita immediately left, grabbing a roll of paper towels and putting a hilariously large amount down on the spill. Leah, for her part, felt incredibly embarrassed once again; she never meant to make such a big mess. Looking down at herself, she noted that her PJ&#39;s were also splattered and sticky. That, and that she was sucking her thumb again. She spit it out indignantly, accidently leaving a little trail of drool down her face.<br />
&quot;Here.&quot; Leah could do nothing as her aunt leaned down and started wiping the syrup off her face. Leah slapped the hand away with a flushed face, once again angry and embarrassed at the infantile treatment.<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not a baby, Rita, I can clean myself!&quot; <br />
&quot;Oh?&quot; The woman sounded genuinely surprised, making Leah all the more flustered. She couldn&#39;t even blame her, with how much of a mess she made.<br />
&quot;Look, I&#39;m going to get a shower anyways. Thanks for the breakfast, and sorry for the mess.&quot; She tried to end the conversation as quickly as possible. Her aunt stopped her before she got up, however.<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t you need help getting a change again?&quot;<br />
Leah&#39;s face scrunched in frustration.<br />
&quot;I can get it off fine. It was just the one diaper. I can take my clothes off on my own!&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh, no, I meant...Leah, you wet yourself.&quot;<br />
Leah&#39;s mouth opened into a wide O as she looked down and, low and behold, the front of her diaper was yellow. When? When did that happen?<br />
&quot;Are you sure you don&#39;t need any help getting clean?&quot;<br />
&quot;No! I&#39;m fine!&quot; She screamed, now wanting nothing more than to run and hide from her aunt and figure out what the heck was wrong with her.<br />
&quot;Oh, it&#39;s fine Leah. Teens like you have problems like this all the time! There&#39;s no need to be embarrassed.&quot;<br />
Leah did everything in her power to not scream in that woman&#39;s face, taking a deep breath to calm herself.<br />
&quot;I&#39;m fine. Please.&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh, alright. If you need help, I&#39;ll be just down here.&quot;<br />
And with that, Leah ran off to the bathroom. She hurriedly stripped her dirty clothes off and turned the shower on, wanting the relaxing stream of hot water now more than ever. At the very least, she can&#39;t feel like an incompetent baby there. <br />
That is, until she remembered her diaper. Staring down at it, it looked no less incomprehensible from before, even when thinking about how Rita did it. Even worse, she realized the yellow got bigger, meaning she had to have wet herself again without realizing it. Gritting her teeth, Leah...</p>
