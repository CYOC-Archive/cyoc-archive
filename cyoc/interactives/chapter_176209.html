<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After some deliberation, he reaches his hand out and touches the left rune, the one with the toilet sign man and the little upward arrow. A small chain of energy then connected it to the first rune.<br />
<br />
&quot;Start on the Path of the Physical Body by looking more like what you idealize.&quot; The voice announced.<br />
<br />
&quot;This bit of flavor text could have been more helpful BEFORE I touched it, you know.&quot; Said Alex, hoping disembodied voices in parallel RPG-like dimensions were open to constructive criticism. But his feedback was interrupted as he felt a tingle run up his finger and into his forearm. It felt like a mix of a bug crawling on his skin and a tickling feather. He pulled his arm away from the rune as the sensation quickly ran up his shoulder and down his torso. And down his flat belly. And into his dick and balls. And there it seemed to settle for half a second.<br />
<br />
Immediately he felt himself flushing and his dick becoming rock hard. He felt the tingling intensify, and what had felt like tiny little bug legs running around his body now started to feel like tiny little hands tugging and pulling at his cock, and the tickling seemed to turn into soft caresses coming from inside his ballsack.<br />
<br />
Before he could actually rationalize anything, his mind seemed to go into red alert. Whatever this was, it was unnatural, alien and must be resisted. He walked backwards unsteadily until he fell back into the bed. His face flushed red from both the arousal and the exertion from trying to resist it. Despite his efforts, though, he seemed to be loosing the battle. The little hands coalesced into one big hand that was jerking him off masterfully. While his balls were feeling warm, full and under the perfect amount of pressure.<br />
<br />
Then he felt it coming, the fast crescendo of irresistible pleasure as he tried holding back. Until he couldn&#39;t. And so he came. And as the cum landed on his exposed chest and abdomen he felt like his orgasm was expanding to the rest of his body as his muscles clenched, released and grew in waves from his dick, until his orgasm started subsiding, and the waves came on shorter and shorter, the growth decelerating. And soon it was over.<br />
<br />
&quot;Forty three seconds! Hah, much better than the last one!&quot; Said Meljin to himself. Usually they last less than 20 seconds most. And that&#39;s when they&#39;re still instinctively resisting it too. Maybe this was a good sign, Meljin thought. Maybe he could actually expect Alex to be successful where many weren&#39;t. But it is still too soon and he knew better than to get his hopes up.<br />
<br />
Alex looked around, still a bit overwhelmed by everything. Then he noticed his body. Alex got up from the bed and quickly started surveying the changes. His arms were bigger, his pecs were bigger, his ass, his legs... It seemed that every muscle in his body had grown a significant amount, he looked like one of those white preppy gays that are a dime a dozen in circuit parties. And he felt sexy. Well, sexy-er, the voice had said something about becoming his &#39;ideal&#39; body or something, didn&#39;t it? This was miles better than before but was also miles away from his final goal.<br />
<br />
He looked at the washbasin&#39;s direction and noticed the runes were still there, floating in midair. As he approached he noticed some things. First that he couldn&#39;t touch the locked runes, they were still there, but were intangible. He spent a few moments experimenting with clipping his hands through the runes. Then he noticed there were two more runes under the last one he&#39;d unlocked, one with a running male symbol and the other with a cock and two small arrows, one in the top right and another on the bottom right corner of the rune.<br />
<br />
&quot;Really wish I could know what those did before selecting one of them...&quot; He said out loud, hoping that maybe the voice could give an explanation. It did not.<br />
<br />
And he noticed that the symbols themselves in the runes he had selected were tinted with a dark red color. All but a second little arrow on the top right corner of the rune he just touched. That definitely wasn&#39;t there before, he thought. Maybe it meant it could be upgraded further, that&#39;s why he looked like a generic white gay, not like his dream body-- yet.<br />
<br />
Lastly he noticed the little X shaped rune floating at a distance in the upper right side of the &quot;Skill Tree&quot;. It seemed easy enought to understand what it did. He touched it and the whole set up folded into itself and became a bronze bracelet with a oval ruby in embedded on it. He placed it on his left wrist, it fit him perfectly.<br />
<br />
&quot;The bracelet is linked to you. Even if you loose it, it will simply teleport back into your wrist after a few minutes. One press on the stone transforms it back into the runes you can access. Two presses on the stone is for emergencies. Big ones, life or death type of situations. I&#39;ll help you. But seriously, do NOT use it lightly.&quot; The voice pitched in, sternly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok, ok, I won&#39;t, don&#39;t worry!&quot; Said Alex a bit annoyed. &quot;Thanks for the tutorial though. Now what?&quot;<br />
<br />
Suddenly the wind picked up inside the room as the curtains flowed inside from the window. Under it, sitting in a neat, folded pile and illuminated by a bright sun ray, were what seemed to be clothes, and a note that read &quot;Good Luck&quot; in a very caligraphed handwriting.<br />
<br />
The clothes were very simple, there was a thong, very short shorts, a flowy, almost transparent v-neck shirt and some leather shoes.<br />
<br />
The clothes weren&#39;t really his style, but he didn&#39;t seem to have an alternative. As he reluctantly dressed up he pondered what to do next...</p>
