<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Darren and his friends had been startled when Akira appeared before them. At the time Darren, Misaki, Steph, and Hannah had been waiting for Bob.<br />
<br />
Now the teens and the Soul Drive were trying to awkwardly explain to Bob&#39;s girlfriend (and Darren&#39;s crush) Crystal what the hell was going on.<br />
<br />
&quot;So let me get this straight,&quot; Crystal said. &quot;You&#39;re telling me you can do magic. Actual magic, like on movies and such.&quot;<br />
<br />
Darren shrugged, unsure of how to respond, thankfully Akira now stepped forward glaring at the group. &quot;We can have a more formal introduction later,&quot; he said. &quot;Right now we have to go to Yuriko.&quot;<br />
<br />
The others nodded as Akira now led them to Yurikos bedroom, the kitsune having used his magic to transport the group to the elderly wizards home. As Darren now opened the door, he gasped in shock.<br />
<br />
Yuriko lay on her stomach, unconscious, as Ayami now tended to the wound on her back. &quot;What happened to Ms. Yuriko,&quot; Darren asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;She was attacked,&quot; Akira said softly. &quot;By a man we thought dead for almost a century.&quot; Darren said nothing, noticing for the first time the large scar on the right side of Yurikos body. &quot;Did he give her that scar?&quot;<br />
<br />
Akira glanced at where Darren was pointing. &quot;Sort of,&quot; Akira stated. &quot;That wound was caused by a lich. The creature tore through Yurikos body when she was young. That lich was an ally of the one who attacked today. A wizard named Casseus.&quot; Akira now closed the door, leaving his wife to tend to Yuriko.<br />
<br />
&quot;Darren,&quot; Akira stated. &quot;Before Ayami out Yuriko to sleep, she asked that I train you on this next lesson.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What lesson is Darren learning,&quot; Steph asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;The Catalyst has many powers,&quot; Akira stated. &quot;One of those is the manipulation of time. We are going to journey to the past. I want you to see and understand the man that did this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;All due respect Akira,&quot; Hannah said. &quot;But if you guys already killed him once then this should be a piece of cake. I mean Darren already trounced those creeps that attacked me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Those were just pawns,&quot; Akira grumbled. &quot;Casseus, his power is great enough that I fear he could destroy you without proper training.&quot; Akira now studied Bob and Crystal, sighing as he realized he probably should not have involved the two. &quot;It probably means more of you shall have to be trained in magic as well.&quot;<br />
<br />
An excited murmur now floated among the teens as Akira led them to the living room. As the kitsune now stared at the group he found them going silent once more. &quot;Darren,&quot; he stated. &quot;For this lesson I want you to focus on bringing all of us into the past, solely as observers.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why as just observers,&quot; Misaki asked. &quot;I mean couldnt we help. Maybe take out this Casseus guy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Even the slightest change can greatly affect the timeline,&quot; Akira exclaimed. &quot;No we are to watch and watch only. I will use my magic to make us invisible to all. Once in the past you are to take no actions.&quot;<br />
<br />
Despite some protests the group eventually relented. Akira would not allow history to be altered. After all the time manipulation he himself had experienced, further alterations could not be allowed. Akira now asked Darren to focus his magic, taking them all 80byears into the past.<br />
<br />
Darren closed his eyes, the strain of reversing the flow of time causing the teens head to throb. If it wasnt for the assistance of Akira, Darren worried his head might explode. With a flash of light Darren and his friends now felt as if they were being thrown backwards, growing dizzy as they tried to steady themselves. Rubbing their heads the group blinked as they now found themselves inside an unfamiliar building.<br />
<br />
&quot;Where are we,&quot; Darren asked weakly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Casseus base,&quot; Akira said softly. The group now scanned their surroundings, Steph noticing they appeared to be inside some sort of bubble. &quot;What is this,&quot; she asked, raising a hand to touch the structure. <br />
<br />
&quot;A time bubble,&quot; Akira answered. &quot;For a novice such as Darren it is easiest to to perform this spell but creating a space that exists outside of time. It also allows us to remain unseen or interact in the past.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This was easy,&quot; Darren exclaimed in alarm. &quot;My head feels like it&#39;s going to explode.&quot; Akira nodded, motioning to the others. &quot;The discomfort is from traveling so far back and from moving so many people. If not for my assistance this would not be possible. Think of me as...training wheels.&quot;<br />
<br />
Darren said nothing as Akira now pointed towards a metal table in the middle of the room. As the teen now tried to focus he could see a silver haired man and a small infant. The man had a scowl on his face as he now began to probe the child with his magic.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my god,&quot; Misaki gasped, a feeling of nausea overcoming her as the baby wailed. &quot;What is he doing?!?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Experiments,&quot; Akira growled. &quot;Magical experiments. That child is Yuriko.&quot;<br />
<br />
A collective gasp escaped the group as they witnessed Casseus now torture the infant girl. &quot;We have to stop him,&quot; Hannah screamed.<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; Akira exclaimed. &quot;This has already happened. Believe me it tortures me as well, I am Yuriko&#39;s guardian but interfering with these events will alter our future. I have brought you here for the sole purpose of understanding what you are about to face.&quot;<br />
<br />
Darren and his friends felt themselves become sick, watching as this monster experimented on a helpless child. After a moment though Casseus stopped, exiting the room. &quot;Darren move us further along the timeline,&quot; Akira stated. Darren did as he was told, gritting his teeth as time seemed to speed up. Now the group watched as a young teen only slightly older than them entered the room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait is that Yuriko,&quot; Bob gasped. Akira nodded, a sad expression on his face. &quot;Yes,&quot; he said sadly. &quot;Yuriko traveled into the past to save herself. What she did altered the future. It also came at a terrible price.&quot;<br />
<br />
The group watched as the teenage girl now picked up the infant, only for a rotting hand to burst from her chest. The group screamed in terror as they watched the teenage girl collapse to the ground, her friends now rushing to her aid.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s how she got the scar,&quot; Crystal whispered. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Akira sighed. &quot;If not for her friends Yuriko would have died this day. It was only the combined magic&#39;s of herself and the others she lived. Still, as you can see, she was left with a grim reminder of the dangers of time travel.&quot;<br />
<br />
Akira now turned towards Darren asking him to travel further along the time stream. Darren did as he was told, focusing his strength. The image of the building fading from sight, soon the group found themselves in a forest clearing, watching as a seriously wounded Yuriko lay crumpled with her infant self.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why are we here,&quot; Steph asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I have shown you the depravity in Casseus heart,&quot; Akira said softly. &quot;Now I shall show you his power.&quot;<br />
<br />
The group watched as a young auburn haired woman and two teens now scanned the area. &quot;That is Mary Elise, Karen, and Yuriko&#39;s aunt Naomi,&quot; Akira said. &quot;They were allies of the previous Catalyst and quite powerful in their own right.&quot;<br />
<br />
The group now watched as Mary Elise cried out in pain as a spear bisected her. &quot;Casseus crippled her with that blow,&quot; Akira stated. &quot;She would never walk again.&quot;<br />
<br />
The group said nothing, watching as the two teenage girls now began to fight Casseus. For Darren it was an eye opening experience. Karen and Naomi were obviously skilled wizards, experienced, poweful. Darren watched as they performed spells and fought far better than he thought he ever could. The teen now gasped as Karen was struck down by Casseus.<br />
<br />
&quot;We did not know at the time but Karen would never regain consciousness,&quot; he said sadly. &quot;She lingered in a coma for years before finally passing.&quot;<br />
<br />
The group now watched Naomi, amazed at not only her skill but her creativity. While they had seen only a little bit of magic, they found Naomi to be probably the beat they had seen. A collective gasp now escaped their lips as Naomi too now fell.<br />
<br />
&quot;Her injuries would be with her for the rest of her life,&quot; Akira stated. The group shuddered as they now saw Casseus turn towards Yuriko, a sadistic smile on his face.<br />
<br />
Darren and his friends now watched as Yuriko, despite her injuries tried to fight. The teen giving Casseus her all. The two seemed to be on even ground, which only made them more impressed by the Yuriko they had come to know. Still though they could see that Yuriko was being overwhelmed.<br />
<br />
All seemed loss until they noticed movement from above. A collective cheer now rang out as the group saw the past version of Akira spring into action. &quot;Oh hes a dead man for sure,&quot; Bob exclaimed happily.<br />
<br />
At first the others agreed, until they saw now hurt Akira was. Still the kitsune put on a valiant fight. The group thought Akira would win until well placed blast knocked Akira to his knees.<br />
<br />
&quot;Akira hes going to kill you,&quot; the group exclaimed, so caught up in the scene that they had forgotten that this had already transpired.<br />
<br />
What happened next was a both a shock and not a shock to Akira. The kitsune remembered the original history, before Darren had changed Ayami. In that history Ayami had flown from the woods, the succubus taking her claws across Casseus face and biting Akira enough time to deliver a finishing blow.<br />
<br />
Now though Akira watched as Ayami, as an angel of maternity, shot out of the forest, tackling Casseua. Instead of taking her claws across the wizards face, she punched him. Casseus flung the angel from him, enraged he looked to kill her only for Akira to behead him.<br />
<br />
&quot;It is time to return home Darren,&quot; Akira said softly. Darren nodded, the scene whiting out as they moved through time once more. As they arrived back in their present, Darren now gasped for air.<br />
<br />
&quot;Casseus is far stronger than anything you have seen Darren,&quot; Akira stated. He is twisted, cruel, and exceptionally powerful. I fear though that his malice as well as his strength may have multiplied. The time has come to prepare yourself, if you are to be a Catalyst for change you will need to be ready to face threats such as this.&quot;</p>
