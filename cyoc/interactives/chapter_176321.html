<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Alex and Marsyas fucked twice more that night, once with the faun guiding the human on the best way to top, and another with the faun once more demonstrating his technique on the human. Every times their feelings touched with that odd magic blew Alex&#39;s mind. As did the fact that he&#39;d had more sex in the few days he&#39;d been here than in the whole prior year.<br />
<br />
For yet another night, Alex slept comfortably wrapped in the arms of another man, and slept well. The morning came with more than a little soreness, much of it from the days walking, a good deal of it from last night&#39;s activities. Marsyas was already up and grooming. While not giving himself a full haircut or shave, he was giving himself a little trim now that he had a mirror to work with. Alex rubbed at his own stubbled cheeks with a grimace, he&#39;d need to shave soon.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re up!&quot; The faun said chipperly, causing Alex to wince just a little. He may have drunk more than he intended to last night. &quot;Oh, sorry. I forget you humans get those hangover things. I had some cleaning water and breakfast brought up.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s alright, it&#39;s my own fault.&quot; Alex crawled out of bed and found a pitcher and bowl full of still warm water, he grabbed a clean cloth and started wiping himself down and cleaning a day&#39;s worth of road dust off of him. It did bring back memories of his last bath in the pond with Bo, and a little blush. By the time he was done Marsyas was already tucking into a breakfast of oatmeal with fruits and nuts, so Alex sat down and joined in.<br />
<br />
&quot;I figure I&#39;ll take you to see Pascal after we eat up. He lives just up the road, if that&#39;s still your plan?&quot;<br />
<br />
Alex gave a slow nod. &quot;I think so. I mean.. I&#39;m liking this world but part of me needs to know if there is a way back or not.&quot;<br />
<br />
Marsyas nodded. &quot;I think I understand.&quot; He clapped Alex on the shoulder. &quot;Eat up.&quot;<br />
<br />
Finishing breakfast, Alex started getting dressed, this time with just the kilt and his boots. Most of the men walked around shirtless, except those who carried weapons or wore pieces of armor, or those doing work that they needed some extra protection doing. He&#39;d probably stand out less without, and besides, he was coming to like how his body looked with all the changes. Soon the two of them were back out on the street and marching up past rows of businesses, merchants of various types, and one bakery that has Alex slowing to sniff at the air for a moment. But they continued on until they came to another stone building rather like the others, though above the door was a sign that said simply &#39;Pascal - Wizard.&#39;<br />
<br />
Marsyas knocked politely, but after a minute or two with no answer, the faun pounded a little hard. &quot;Yes. Yes! It&#39;s open!&quot; The faun grinned back at Alex and opened the door. It opened into what looked like a book shop, except all the books were behind glass paned doors, along with other items like jewelry, crystals, and what Alex thought might have been a floating, glowing eyeball. Coming down the stairs was what Alex would have called the ghost of Christmas present, not what he would expect from a wizard. The man was burly with a rotund belly, and was fastening a green robe over his paunch with a red colored sash. His hair was fiery red and a beard spilled halfway down his chest, though grey liberally streaked both the beard and the hair on his head. &quot;Marsyas! What the dickins do you want? Another tracking spell I&#39;d wager?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not this time, Pascal. I&#39;m actually here to introduce you to my friend, he has need of your services.&quot; Marsyas gestured at Alex and Pascal squinted in his direction before pulling out his glasses and getting a better look.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nice to meet you, uh, sir.&quot; Alex said under the gaze.<br />
<br />
&quot;This about that werewolf blessing you have on you? Magic&#39;s run its course, and I wouldn&#39;t undo it, I say you got a good deal out of that one.&quot; Pascal dropped himself into a plush armchair which gave a bit of a groan but held up well enough.<br />
<br />
&quot;He&#39;s from another world, Pascal.&quot; Marsyas said with a sidelong grin to Alex. &quot;Wants to know about a way back.&quot;<br />
<br />
The wizard&#39;s brows shot up, that got his interest. &quot;This true?&quot; At Alex&#39;s nod, Pascal snapped his fingers and pointed to a wooden chair that sat facing his armchair. &quot;Sit, boy. I need to delve.&quot;<br />
<br />
Marsyas gave Alex a little shove, perhaps sensing his worry, though with another encouraging nod he sat in the chair, feeling a little hopeful until Pascal held out a wooden bowl. Was he going to need blood or.. &quot;2 silver.&quot; Right. Alex grabbed his coin purse and opened it up, looking at the few measly coppers he got on the farm. He wasn&#39;t totally sure of the conversion rate, but he was almost sure he didn&#39;t have enough. He opened his mouth to make an excuse only to see two silver pieces drop of Marsyas&#39; hand into the bowl. He shook his head as he noticed Alex was about to protest.<br />
<br />
&quot;You can owe me.&quot; Marsyas said with a smile and found a stool to perch on.<br />
<br />
Pascal was satisfied as long as he got paid and leaned forward placing his hands on either side of Alex&#39;s head. &quot;Focus your thoughts on coming to this world, what you did right before, and what you did after.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I was..&quot;<br />
<br />
Pascal interrupted. &quot;In your mind, boy.&quot; Alex bristled a little at being called boy again but did as instructed, starting his mental recollections with leaving work and heading home, all the way to waking up in the woods and finding the help of Roc and Raf. He felt a strange tingle going through his body the whole time, but he wasn&#39;t sure if it was from the magic or from his own expectations. Finally the wizard sat back with a nod. &quot;Strange world you come from, I&#39;d like to hear stories of it sometime. And it was smart of Raf and Roc to send you my way, but futile I think.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So.. you can&#39;t help me?&quot; Alex strangely felt his heart sink a little.<br />
<br />
&quot;No. World hopping of this magnitude is beyond me, or any wizard really. We&#39;re not talking the next dimension over, you are far, far out of place my boy. A god did this, there&#39;s no doubt about it, and only a god could undo it, and they are not inclined to do favors for mortals.&quot; Pascal shook his head. &quot;Sorry, boy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alex cringed. &quot;Why would a god do this?&quot;<br />
<br />
Pascal shrugged, &quot;Who knows, it could be anything from a prophecy to something to entertain them. The best advice I can give you is to make peace with your lot. This isn&#39;t a terrible world to be stuck in, there are far worse ones. If you&#39;re absolutely set though, you should make your way north to High Peak. There&#39;s an oracle there, the only true mouth piece of the gods we have. You could get an answer there. Maybe.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;High Peak?&quot; Marsyas sounded a bit strangled. &quot;That&#39;s a rough journey in the best of times. And I&#39;ve heard the minotaur tribes have been coming out of the mountains, not to mention having to traverse the Orc lands.&quot;<br />
<br />
Pascal shrugged again. &quot;It&#39;s the only option I know. Or you can make this world your new home. In fact..&quot; Pascal was stroking his beard looking Alex up and down. &quot;I could help you on that front. You might be exactly the solution to another problem.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What problem?&quot; Alex asked when his curiosity finally got the better of him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nothing I can share right now. Come back this afternoon and we&#39;ll see if you fit the bill.&quot; Pascal was grinning through his beard.<br />
<br />
Marsyas came over to Alex and offered him a hand to help him up. &quot;Thanks for your help, Pascal.&quot; Then with an urging nod from the faun Alex followed him back out to the street.<br />
<br />
Though as he was walking through the door the wizard hollered, &quot;Remember my offer boy. It&#39;s the chance of a lifetime.&quot;<br />
<br />
After a minute or so of silence where Alex walked alongside Marsyas the faun finally spoke up. &quot;Well, looks like you have some options. High Peak. Pascal&#39;s offer.&quot; There&#39;s a moment of silence. &quot;I&#39;ve also been thinking of maybe taking on an apprentice.&quot; Marsyas fished the room key out of his belt pouch and handed it over to Alex. &quot;Why don&#39;t you think on it, I have to meet up with some of my contacts, I&#39;ll be back in a few hours.&quot;<br />
<br />
With that, Alex decided to head back to the pub for now. He had a lot to think on.</p>
