<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The tarantula girl decided to teleport with another insect. She liked her black chitin skin and her slender and toned legs so she thought that teleporting with the ant would perfectly accumulate whit her previous changes. With that she opened the glass box of the ant tribe and aimed for one of the ants. Whit her enhance speed, the ant did not stand a chance, as for Mary, it looked like it was moving in slow motion. Carefully she picked the ant up before she rushed over to the teleport chamber. Initializing the teleport process the room was filled with the familiar humming as Mary and the ant began to vanish. After several seconds, the receiver chamber got activated and a silhouette began to solidify inside the chamber. Soon Mary gained consciousness and the door slowly opened. Stepping out of the teleporter, Mary began to examine her changes.<br />
<br />
<br />
Her appearance hasn&#39;t changed much, only her insect features were accentuated a bit more. Her skin had darkened a bit as it got really hard. She moved her hands in excitement over her body and felt the hardness of her skin. Her chitin armor must be as hard as steel. Her waist has slimmed down a bit now showing perfectly formed chitin abs. Her legs also got a bit thinner being in a perfect match to her tight butt. Her four additional limbs got a bit slimmer now looking more like big spikes rather than legs. She felt the hardness of those legs and got aroused. She couldn&#39;t make the smallest dent into them.<br />
<br />
Moving up to her arms, she liked how they were still muscular and toned. She was pretty sure that they were a lot stronger then they looked. She rushed over to a mirror and checked the changes of her face. Hey eyes and hair had turned pitch black. Her hair must have grown a bit as it went straight down her back below the four additional limbs.<br />
<br />
The combination of her chitin armor and per pectoral muscles pushed her breasts up. They looked firm but not to big. She must be only something around 4 feet now. Over all, she really liked how she looked now. <i>A good choice</i>, she thought.<br />
<br />
With lightning speed she rushed to the backyard. Mary was a bit surprised as she noticed that she was even faster than before. Not having tested her strength so far, she assumed that her enhance strength also increased her speed. Spotting the purpose of her last teleport, Mary rushed over to the container. With confidence she bend her knees, placed her hands under the container and pushed her knees up. This time, was able to lift it. In fact, she was a bit surprised that it was so easy. She didn&#39;t really feel the weight of the container. Mary assumed that this thing must weight several tons but it felt weightless to her. In delight she moved further under the container balancing the full weight overhead. With a big grin on her face she released one arm low lifting the weight with just one arm.<br />
<br />
Another thought came up her mind as she moved her four spider legs to the container, easily cutting through its steel floor. She was able to get some hold inside the container as she now released the second hand, still holding the tons of weight over her head. Bending over, she moved down to the ground starting to do some push ups. She accelerated her action ending in an complete blur doing push ups with tons of additional weight. After several seconds she counted, <i>One thousand</i>, satisfied form the test of her strength.<br />
<br />
Still holding the container she stood up and headed towards the woods once more. She wanted to try her speed with the additional weight so she started her watch and began to run her normal 6 miles track. She ran with unbelievable speed carry several tons. And after barely 5 seconds she was already back at the start. Mary was shocked when she realized how strong she got. In excitement she went for another 10 laps but it was not really a challenge for her now.<br />
<br />
As she rushed through the forest, Mary passed by a mountain with a 200 feet scarp. She balanced the container on one of her arms and dug her spider legs deep into the rocks. Step by step she climbed up the scarp eventually accelerating her action. She was able to move overhead and sideways and even headfirst down.<br />
<br />
<br />
Satisfied with the outcome and the demonstration of her strength Mary rushed back to her home before placing the container down.<br />
<br />
Not knowing how to test her strength Mary tried to estimate how strong she got. The ant must have weighted only a few milligrams and she estimated the stone, which the ant carried earlier, to weight 50-100 grams. Her eyes widened as she did the math which resulted in factor up to 100000. <i>One hundred thousand</i>. Mary got thrilled. Estimating her own weight to be 50kg as she was rather small bit her chitin skin must weight a bit, Mary realized that she could carry 5 million kilogram or 5 thousand tons. Maybe a bit less because she got not the full strength of the ant but on the other hand was rather strong before...<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Like she was on autopilot, Mary guided the four spider legs to her womanhood gently tingle its entry. She was so turned on by her power that she started to masturbate right there. Pushing her legs deeper and harder inside her she fast began to orgasm in satisfaction.<br />
<br />
Laying on the ground Mary thought about what to do next.</p>
