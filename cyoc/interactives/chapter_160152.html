<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dan writhed as they approached the kitchen.<br />
&quot;No, stop!&quot;<br />
&quot;Come off it, this is what you wanted. I didn&#39;t turn you into such a fat lobster, by the way, I turned you into your *inner* lobster. You *wanted* to be this delicious looking, Dan!&quot;<br />
He stopped writhing as they came into the kitchen as he saw the instruments of his impending demise. Kat had planned ahead. There was already a pot of water boiling, a plate, a lemon wedge, some butter, a lobster shell cracker, and lobster fork.<br />
<br />
He felt, to his shame and elation, his arousal building as he looked at the pot he would soon be in, the plate he would soon be on.<br />
&#39;Oh God, it&#39;s happening...&#39;<br />
He made one last feeble attempt to save himself.<br />
&quot;You wouldn&#39;t...wouldn&#39;t really eat me, would you?&quot;<br />
&quot;Totally would,&quot; Kat said, before chucking him in the boiling pot and slamming on the lid.<br />
<br />
For a millisecond, he felt like he was really being boiled, before the pain suddenly shifted, became different, number. He screamed, even so, in pain...and arousal. His limbs ceased to answer to him. He saw his shell slowly becoming bright red. It was as if he were being stretched on a rack. As if he were getting the best blowjob of his life. As if he were being flayed. As if he were being fucked senseless. All at once.<br />
He tried to call out at one point, feebly, but not only was there no answer, it was as if the connection was gone. At that point, Dan realized that Kat must have tweaked his telepathy when enchanting him to not die this way; since he&#39;d reflexively call for help at a moment like this, he&#39;d been muted. He was totally helpless; he moaned internally. Without worrying about Kat overhearing him, he had to admit it was a moan of mostly arousal.<br />
<br />
His sense of time was off. He had no idea how long he&#39;d been there, but suddenly the lid was off and there were the tongs again. He was bright red.<br />
&#39;Like a proper cooked lobster...I *am* a proper cooked lobster...I&#39;m...*FOOD*! Reduced on the food chain! I&#39;m...oh God, it&#39;s amazing...&#39;<br />
He was put on the plate, and he felt a sense of transportation. His senses had all been foreshortened, somehow. He no longer saw like a lobster, or like a human...he saw himself as if in the third person, but also as if he had eyes all over himself. It was surreal, but he knew what it amounted to: he would see every bite Kat was about to take, from every angle.<br />
<br />
Kat took the cracker after tying on her bib, licking her lips. Deftly, she cracked open Dan&#39;s shell. He screamed in orgasm in his head - a strange sensation, disembodied orgasm. He felt it throughout his entire being, but also a shock of pain.<br />
His meat now exposed, Kat squeezed a bit of lemon over him, which felt to Dan like being electrocuted and smothered in cheerleaders at the same time.<br />
She poured melted butter onto him, which felt like he was being covered in boiling oil and an all-body handjob.<br />
Satisfied, she began to eat him<br />
<br />
It was terrifying. It was excruciating. It was better than sex.<br />
<br />
Dan watched as each morsel of his flesh was dug out, entered his sister&#39;s mouth, was chewed and then vanished from his perceptions.<br />
Finally, there was only a bit of him left. A tiny morsel on the end of Kat&#39;s fork.<br />
She grinned at him, butter dripping down him.<br />
&quot;Well, I was right, Dan. You are...were...delicious.&quot;<br />
And then she swallowed him whole.<br />
<br />
Darkness.<br />
<br />
Darkness, and pain. Not torturous pain. Pain like major intensive workouts, over and over again, for days. Time meant little, or nothing.<br />
<br />
A bottle of water pressed to his lips. He drank messily, gratefully.<br />
<br />
Struggling, he opened his eyes.<br />
&quot;Easy, careful. Your eyes are technically brand new. I shut out all the lights to be sure. I&#39;ll raise them gently.&quot;<br />
Slowly, light and color return. His sister, holding a water bottle. His room, with his bed on one side and tank on the other.<br />
Himself, on the floor, strange runes slowly fading around him, naked as the day he was born.<br />
<br />
Dan groaned, moving to cover himself but too exhausted to do more than that.<br />
&quot;Urrrgh...well...at least the respawn works...&quot;<br />
&quot;And faster than I thought it would; you were only down for an hour. How do you feel?&quot;<br />
&quot;Like I just served as the practice dummy for the football team for an entire season in one day.&quot;<br />
Kat nodded, and handed him the bottle again. He drank deeply, spilling less now.<br />
&quot;You could do that, you know. Not now - inanimate transformation takes lots and LOTS of practice to do right - but you can do it. Supposedly we&#39;ve got a great uncle Owen who helped in WWII by making himself into replicas of neckties belonging to German officers and then strangling them.&quot;<br />
&quot;Good for Uncle Owen...&quot; Dan said tiredly. &quot;Ok...question.&quot;<br />
&quot;Shoot.&quot;<br />
He glared at her.<br />
&quot;*Why.*&quot;<br />
<br />
She smirked.<br />
&quot;Two reasons, one you&#39;ll agree with and one you&#39;ll like but won&#39;t admit it.&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh for-&quot;<br />
&quot;The first and most important reason is, by breeding for two weeks you missed the natural third-day end for my enchantment. We basically had to reset your form anyway, and this was the *least* painful way.&quot;<br />
&quot;...oh. Uh. Fair.&quot;<br />
&quot;Naturally,&quot; Kat said primly.<br />
&quot;...alright, now what&#39;s the second one?&quot;<br />
<br />
Kat looked at him deviously, and smirked.<br />
&quot;Because you&#39;re natural prey, and I was hungry.&quot;<br />
Dan scoffed, trying to ignore his sudden chubbie.<br />
&quot;Fuck off.&quot;<br />
&quot;No. I know Mom and Dad won&#39;t like the idea, which is why we won&#39;t tell them, but you know I&#39;m right. You want, you DESERVE, to be eaten. To be nothing...but...food,&quot; she added with seductive emphasis.<br />
<br />
Dan gulped, tried to wave her off.<br />
&quot;Go away, damn it...&quot;<br />
&quot;You know I&#39;m right. I can already tell.&quot;<br />
&quot;How?&quot; he said, fearful.<br />
&quot;You&#39;re a shifter. Until you learn control, your body will react to your innate desires. My enchantment is gone, now, it&#39;s all your own power. So tell me: why is your left hand a lobster claw again?&quot;<br />
Dan jerked his head and saw it was true.<br />
<br />
He shuddered, looking away.<br />
&quot;I...I don&#39;t...I don&#39;t want to...don&#39;t want to *want* to be eaten...&quot;<br />
Kat stroked his hair, gently, soothingly.<br />
&quot;But you do, don&#39;t you,&quot; she asked, not teasing, gently.<br />
&quot;...I do...&quot;<br />
&quot;My spell turned you into what you really are deep down. You were a lobster, but more importantly, what were you? What *are* you, Dan?&quot;<br />
He looked at his claw, closed his eyes, took a dry gulp.<br />
&quot;...Food.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kat patted his head. She spoke gently, but matter-of-fact.<br />
&quot;You&#39;re going to learn to control your shifting. You won&#39;t worry about turning into anything human. You&#39;ll focus on animals, specifically edible ones. You won&#39;t tell Mom or Dad, and neither will I. We&#39;re going to get along just fine from now on, but when it&#39;s just you and me and they aren&#39;t around, you will take your proper place. Understand, food?&quot;<br />
Dan&#39;s cock was so hard, he could barely conceal it.<br />
&quot;...Yes, Kat.&quot;<br />
Kat nodded, and rose.<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t you forget it.&quot;<br />
<br />
As she turned to go, however, she stopped, turned, knelt back down and kissed his hair. He looked up at her, confused, to find genuine affection in her eyes.<br />
&quot;Hey, don&#39;t worry, little brother. There&#39;s plenty of folks in the world with this fetish or weirder. You just get to act it out, safely. Now, I&#39;m gonna let you take care of Little Dan, then I&#39;ll be back to help you start training enough to shift back that claw. Then you can get some sleep, and dream about being all sorts of amazing dishes.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dan felt a strange mix of fear, arousal...and...comfort. He was safe at home.</p>
