<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After a moment, Michael looked up to Diya and told her his decision.<br />
<br />
“I think we should catch you up to speed on what’s been going on this week” Michael decided. <br />
<br />
Diya and Freddy smiled as Michael began to fill her in on the events of the last week. She listened carefully as he recalled all of the crazy and often times painful details. At certain points, Freddy rubbed Michael’s back as he got emotional over certain things. Diya looked on with empathy as he broached difficult topics with tears in his eyes. Finally, when it was all laid out, Michael looked up to Diya to see what her reaction would be. <br />
<br />
“Wow, what a week” Diya began as she slowly processed the information. “That may be one of the craziest things I have ever heard and certainly the craziest for something that actually transpired.”<br />
<br />
Michael looked at Diya as she got up from her chair to pull something off of her shelf. He tried to take a look at it before she hid it away from him.<br />
<br />
“Uh uh,” Diya said as she blocked Michael’s view while she sat back down. “Not yet. Before I agree to help you, you have to agree to some conditions first.”<br />
<br />
“Conditions?” Freddy asked incredulously. “Are you serious? Michael, come on, I don’t think it’s worth having to break this spell under her terms. Let’s go.”<br />
<br />
Freddy tried to pull Michael up before he swatted him away. <br />
<br />
“Let’s hear her out” Michael replied before Freddy begrudgingly sat back down. <br />
<br />
“Anyways” Diya continued. “The first thing condition is that, to confirm I’m not in a hallucinatory state right now, I want Freddy…or rather, Fido….to come out to play.”<br />
<br />
“Here? Freddy asked nervously. “Now?”<br />
<br />
“Yes, Freddy. Now. I want to see for myself how this curse works and what we’re dealing with specifically.”<br />
<br />
“I don’t know if that’s such a good idea, Diya. What if your parents come in?”<br />
<br />
“First of all, they won’t. They know better than to interrupt me when I have company over. Secondly, even in the off handed chance that they come in and catch you as a dog, I’ll just lie and say it’s a hologram. They’ll be none the wiser.”<br />
<br />
“Well, won’t they hear me? Or smell me?”<br />
<br />
“All of that can be replicated with holographic technology. That’s what I’ll say to them and they will believe it as they have no reason to doubt me. Now come on, let’s see what we’re working with here.”<br />
<br />
Freddy paused for a moment before he turned to Michael.<br />
<br />
“She’s right, Freddy” Michael responded cautiously. “Let’s just get this over it. The sooner she can meet Fido, the sooner she’ll agree to give me what I need to orchestrate my plan.”<br />
<br />
“You never told me what your plan is, Michael” Freddy replied as he hesitated to stand up. “Don’t you think I should know what we’re getting from her before I go dog out right here in her bedroom?”<br />
<br />
“Just trust me.”<br />
<br />
“No, tell me what we’re doing first and then I’ll change.”<br />
<br />
“Freddy…” Diya replied as he turned to her. “Freddy, it’s getting late and we don’t have time to quarrel over this right now. Please change into a dog so I can confirm what you’re saying is true. I promise you that as soon as you do, I’ll insist that Michael tell us what the plan is before he changes you back. Ok?”<br />
<br />
Freddy, unsure of how to respond, looked to Michael who nodded at him with encouragement. <br />
<br />
“Ok” Freddy replied as he got himself up from the chair on the floor. “But don’t wait for me to change back before you tell me what we’re going to do and what you’re giving Michael. After I dog out, you have to tell me what the plan is and then Michael will change me back.”<br />
<br />
“Do you think you’ll remember it if we tell it to you as a dog?” Diya asked as she stood up as well. <br />
<br />
“Yes. I may be a dog, but I still have my human memories in place.”<br />
<br />
Freddy stood awkwardly for a moment as he turned to see Michael get up from his seat to join him. <br />
<br />
“Uh” Freddy murmured as he awkwardly looked at Diya and then back at Michael. “Does she have to be here when we do this?” <br />
<br />
“She has to see it for herself in order to believe that it’s happening” Michael responded. “Now come on, take off your clothes.”<br />
<br />
“Woah woah woah” Diya said as he backed away from the boys. “No way. You’re not getting Freddy naked in my room.”<br />
<br />
“He has to, Diya” Michael responded assuringly. “It’s so he doesn’t rip his clothes.”<br />
<br />
“He’s right, Diya” Freddy added. “Unless you’d rather me just not to do, which I’m more than happy to…uh…not do, then I have to take at least some of my clothes off in order to do this. I have to be able to have something to wear when I leave your house tonight.”<br />
<br />
Diya paused for a moment before she spoke up. <br />
<br />
“Fine, but leave your underwear on, please.”<br />
<br />
Freddy nodded as he began to strip. He pushed off his dirty shoes and socks and set them aside. He pulled off his shirt, throwing it to the floor, and then hesitated before he chucked off his pants and piled them on top of his other articles of clothing. Beginning to blush, Freddy stood in front of Diya, nearly exposed save for his tightly clinging tightly whities. Michael eased the situation by beginning to grab at Freddy’s underwear. <br />
<br />
“Ew!” Diya exclaimed as she turned around. “What are you doing?”<br />
<br />
“It’s what triggers the curse” Michael replied as he continued to rub Freddy’s crotch through his underwear. “When Freddy gets turned on, that’s when he dogs out.”<br />
<br />
“Ok, just do what you have to and then tell me when it’s starting.”<br />
<br />
“Ok”<br />
<br />
“Michael?” Freddy asked nervously as his penis continued to get squeezed. “Maybe this isn’t such a good idea. We don’t have to do this right now.”<br />
<br />
“Relax” Michael responded. “If you let your inhibitions go a bit, then it’ll be easier to trigger the change.”<br />
<br />
Freddy paused for a moment before he nodded as Michael continued to rub his dick. After a minute of feeling high bouts of anxiety, he began to relax as he could feel his dick twitching and coming back to life. Soon, Michael felt Freddy’s dick mutate as his canine sheath returned again.<br />
<br />
“Diya” Michael called to her. “It’s about to start now.”<br />
<br />
Diya turned around nervously to a see furry Freddy standing before her. <br />
<br />
“Woah” she gasped as she marveled at the sight in front of her. <br />
<br />
Freddy began to sprout fur all over his body. His stomach saw a growth of creamy white fur as his legs and arms turned black and brown, while his back turned exclusively black. He could feel his feet beginning to shrink as they turned into the paws of a dog, while his rapidly growing canine claws gripped to the floor below. <br />
<br />
“Let me help you down” Michael suggested as he grabbed Freddy’s rapidly morphing body and eased him down onto the floor in a hands and knees position. <br />
<br />
Freddy’s back legs rapidly shifted into hind legs as his tail sprouted out, tickling Michael’s legs. He could feel his back muscles shrinking to fit those of a dog. <br />
<br />
“Michaeerth?” Freddy asked, as his voice began to turn growly. “Willth yoooouthh takkeeee offf myyyetth unndderrtthhweaarrr preeath?”<br />
<br />
Michael nodded as he bent down and held onto the elastic band of the underwear before carefully pushing it down off of Freddy’s hind legs. Freddy shifted around to ease them off of himself. Diya then noticed that Freddy’s red dick was swaying from out of his sheath. <br />
<br />
“Ugh gross!” she cried as as furry faced Freddy looked down to notice his swinging tool. <br />
<br />
“Sorreetththh” Freddy growled as his mouth began to push out as he looked up to her, embarrassed by his dick’s appearance. <br />
<br />
Freddy felt his upper body shift as his arms turned into the front legs of a dog and his hands mutated back into paws. His teeth grew sharp as he saw his wet, black nose push out in front of his eyes again. His vision of the world turned from color to something less vibrant. His ears grew back up and he could hear the vibration of the noise cancelling machine ringing in his head. Soon, where Freddy once stood mere moments ago was Fido, the German Shepherd dog. <br />
<br />
Diya quietly stepped back as Fido cautiously approached her. Michael got up from his bent position as he looked at her curiously.<br />
<br />
“I would think that I was on some sort of hallucinogenic drugs if I didn’t see this for myself” she composed herself enough to say.<br />
<br />
Fido stopped at her feet as Diya hesitantly bent down into a squatting position. <br />
<br />
“Can I pet him?” she asked Michael. <br />
<br />
Michael looked nervously to Fido as he nodded his head in approval. <br />
<br />
“I’m not going to do a full on pat down” she said to try to reassure Fido. “Let me just pet your head briefly, ok?”<br />
<br />
Fido nodded before he began to feel a sense of joy overwhelm him as she scratched at his head and then behind his ear. His back leg began to pound on the floor as he happily wagged his tail and panted. <br />
<br />
“I think you should be careful, Diya” Michael said to her nervously. “That tends to make him ejaculate on the spot.”<br />
<br />
“Ack!” Diya shrieked as she fell back onto the floor, causing Fido to whimper as he reached down to lick at her face. <br />
<br />
Freaked out, Diya pushed Fido back as he whimpered and then began to lie down on the floor. <br />
<br />
“So, is Freddy still in there?” Diya asked as Michael helped her up off the floor. <br />
<br />
“He is” Michael responded. “Freddy…”<br />
<br />
Fido looked up at them curiously. <br />
<br />
“Nod your head if you are really Freddy Benson.”<br />
<br />
Fido nodded his head. <br />
<br />
“Nod your head if you know where we are right now.”<br />
<br />
Fido nodded again.<br />
<br />
“Do you know who this is?” <br />
<br />
Michael pointed to Diya as Fido nodded his head.<br />
<br />
“Would you say the two of you are friends?”<br />
<br />
Fido paused for a moment. He felt that, while Diya had helped him up until this point, he still wouldn’t say that that made them friends. After an awkward moment where both Diya and Michael looked down at him with concern, he shook his head no. <br />
<br />
“See?” Michael said to Diya. <br />
<br />
“That’s unbelievable” she replied. “It defies the laws of physics. One minute, your boyfriend is standing there in his underwear and then the next, he’s a dog.”<br />
<br />
Fido looked up at her, cocking his head slightly. <br />
<br />
“If it wasn’t for Freddy’s clothes piled up on my floor” she continued “I wouldn’t have believed it in a million years. It defies everything I’ve ever know about the laws of the universe, but I have to admit it. It has to be true.”<br />
<br />
Diya thought for a moment before she turned to Michael. <br />
<br />
“How does this work, exactly?” she asked. “What’s causing these transformations?”<br />
<br />
“It’s the ring that’s at my house” Michael replied “though Freddy somehow has the power to summon it to him when he’s in human form.”<br />
<br />
“Can Freddy change back so I can see it?”<br />
<br />
Fido whimpered. Diya said Michael was going to tell them about the plan first before he changed back again. Why was she adding new conditions now that he was in his canine form? <br />
<br />
“Uh” Michael responded, unsure of how to answer. <br />
<br />
Michael looked down at Fido to try to gauge his reaction. Fido shook his head no as Michael looked back at Diya. He stared at her while she looked at Michael with a mix of emotions on her face; wondering what his answer would be. After a moment to think it through, Michael composed himself enough to answer her. <br />
<br />
“Diya….” he began.</p>
