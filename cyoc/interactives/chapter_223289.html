<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Paul was left alone in Mr Dawson’s office with the dress his mother wanted him to wear. He was currently wearing his school shirt not tucked in over his torn trousers with the seam over his bum crack ripped and even then, the fly would not do up. But Paul just wasn’t sure if he was ready to take the step of wearing a dress. <br />
<br />
He felt the material. It was perhaps a light cotton garment. The roses were big and red against a black background. It would no doubt look very nice on his mother, or should that be Mr Dawson currently. His mother certainly couldn’t wear it at present.<br />
<br />
But Paul could wear it. He was currently in the slim body of an attractive blonde girl. A girl called Chelsea. An opera singer of all things. He recalled the reflection he had seen in the bathroom mirror. Chelsea was a pretty girl and would no doubt look very attractive in the dress. More attractive than wearing an ill-fitting boys school shirt and torn trousers. But was Paul ceding his masculinity by wearing a dress?<br />
<br />
Then he saw something else was in the bag his mother had removed the dress from. There was not one but two new bras in the bag. Paul removed them. One was pink and one was black. Other than the colour the bra’s seemed identical. Tentatively Paul examined the black bra. The label described it as ‘Lace soft cup underwire bra. Size 12 B’. He guessed his chest was about the same size as his mother’s or should that be Mr Dawson’s. Would wearing a bra help to hide that his nipples were erect? The rubbing of his nipples against his shirt was a bit irritating and he could see clearly the nubs showing through his shirt. <br />
<br />
Unable to make a decision, Paul tentatively opened the door a crack and peered out. Immediately he could hear Mrs Scully (Alex’s Mom) fussing over Mr Dawson “Just sit down Mary and let me examine you. What happened to you sounds quite serious” That would be right. Mrs Scully was a nurse and his mother’s best friend. She would be wanting to find the cause of Paul’s mother’s alleged ‘turn’.<br />
<br />
However, Paul quickly shut the door again when he noticed Alex still in the foyer apparently checking the contents of Paul’s school bag. What was Alex doing? <br />
<br />
Alex must have noticed the door closing as 10 seconds later there was a knock on the door. “Is that you in there Paul? I’ve got some great news” The door began to open.<br />
<br />
Paul gave a high pitched shriek and pushed hard against the door. “Stay out! I’m getting changed!” he said in his feminine voice.<br />
<br />
Alex and Paul exchanged fleeting eye contact before Alex backed off. “Oh sorry Miss” then through the closed door “I thought it must have been my friend Paul in there. His bag is here but he’s nowhere to be found”<br />
<br />
“Well stand guard for me and don’t let anyone else come in” Paul demanded as if affronted.<br />
<br />
“Yeah sure” was the muffled reply.<br />
<br />
Now Paul was in a dilemma. He now had to change. He did not know whether Alex had taken note of what Paul had been wearing but he could not take the chance. He figured he now had no choice but to wear the dress his mother had given him.<br />
<br />
Quickly he figured out how to wear the bra and removed the tags. Then he took off his shirt and tried to put the bra on. It was much harder than Paul had imagined to put on. He fumbled behind his back and after what seemed like an eternity managed to get the clasp to catch. The bra seemed to be a pretty good fit, perhaps a smidgeon tight.<br />
 <br />
With his breasts finally covered by the black lacy material Paul undid his belt, took off his shoes and socks and then his trousers. He was wearing bikini style briefs, which were not a perfect fit anymore but they were able to stretch a little and would just have to do. He then contemplated the dress. <br />
<br />
It had a zip on the back and was easy to step into. Doing up the zip was relatively easy compared to clipping on the bra. There was also a belt around Paul’s now narrow waist that was simple to do up. The dress only went down to Paul’s knees but that was alright. Paul’s new legs were hairless and dare Paul say shapely. He had no doubt that he now looked good. <br />
<br />
He placed his school clothes in one of Mr Dawson’s cupboards, including his shoes, Paul being fearful that Alex would recognise them. He could always borrow a pair of his mother’s ballet slippers if there was nothing else in the lost property. Paul was ready to leave.</p>
