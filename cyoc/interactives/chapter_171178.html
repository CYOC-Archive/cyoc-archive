<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Upon exiting the library, Harvey saw his best friend Randy. He was dressed in his usual attire, mesh shorts and a muscle shirt. His lean and athletic body had a good amount of muscle and a nice tan for a white man, likely due to the time he spent out on the soccer field. His curly black hair was mostly close cropped, except for the top which poofed above his sweatband. <br />
<br />
&quot;Randy, salutations!&quot; Harpinder greeted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, it&#39;s the Turbanator. What&#39;s up?&quot; Randy, who looked like he woke up not too long ago, took a sip of his coffee.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just picking up some books from the library. Are you on your way to class?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I&#39;m on my way to the kinesiology building.&quot; He took another sip, &quot;classes are already crazy, I guess that&#39;s why we haven&#39;t seen each other in a while.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No problemo, I&#39;ve been busy myself. Would you like to meet up tomorrow night to catch the game?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Catch the game?&quot; Randy laughed, &quot;Bro, you don&#39;t know anything about sports.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Pardon me, Randy,&quot; Harpinder glared, &quot;but I am well informed on sports. You know my favorite team is...&quot; he trailed off. He had the name of the team on the tip of his tongue, and now it was lost on him. Harpinder realized he even forgot which sport was playing tomorrow.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey don&#39;t sweat it, there&#39;s no shame in not knowing. You&#39;re not the most athletic guy after all.&quot;<br />
<br />
Harpinder nodded, it was true that he valued acedemic knowledge more than sports trivia. &quot;You&#39;re right Randy. I don&#39;t know why I said that. I meant to suggest we play that association football simulator.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure, I&#39;m always down to play some Fifa. Though, do you think you can go easy on me this time? As a player on the college soccer team, it&#39;s embarrassing losing to a nerd that doesn&#39;t know the game.&quot;<br />
<br />
Harpinder laughed with a nerdy snort, &quot;it&#39;s really not that hard when you study the meta game. Besides that I just pick the team with a uniform that looks keen.&quot;<br />
<br />
Randy smiled and shook his head, &quot;How did I become friends with such a big nerd? Oh, by the way, you want some of my coffee before I take off?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Certainly&quot; he took a sip from Randy&#39;s cup, happy that it had a creamy texture and sweet taste rather than being served black. &quot;Thanks&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh oh, I should have warned you there&#39;s milk in this. You&#39;re lactose intolerant, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You must be thinking of someone else. I&#39;ve never been-&quot; Harpinder was interrupted by a churning sound in his stomach, followed by a loud fart from his fat sedentary ass. &quot;Excuse me!&quot;<br />
<br />
Randy bust into laughter. A few onlookers took notice of Harpinder&#39;s repeated flatulence and joined in laughing and pointing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Randy! You&#39;re making a scene&quot; Harpinder&#39;s face was totally flush with embarrassment, but even more embarrassing was the fact that he was getting hard from all of this attention. This was the only time he was thankful his cock shrank during the transformation, as no one would notice. Each jeer from the crowd made his micro dick twitch more. His ass started to burn as he remembered, no, fantasized about the wedgie he received moments ago. &quot;That&#39;s all that&#39;s missing from making this even more embarrassing&quot; he thought as he stifled a grunt, &quot;someone giving me a wedgie, stretching my undies to their limits, then taking a whiff of my nasty, nerdy stench.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m so sorry Turbanator&quot; Randy finally controlled his laughter, &quot;that was just too funny.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uhg, &#39;Turbanator&#39;&quot;, Harpinder thought, &quot;I know he means well, but I have all these memories of being insulted for my turban... along with being insulted for being a nerd.&quot; He grinned, &quot;On second thought, Harpinder is such a strong name. A dorky nickname fits me better&quot; he let out a moan, though his high and naisley voice made it sound more like a squeak.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, ahem, I&#39;ll be fine. I&#39;m excited to game with you tomorrow night.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Me too. I&#39;d better run to class now, kinesiology is pretty far. I&#39;ll see you tomorrow!&quot; Randy sprinted off. Harpinder was glad he still had time before his first class, there was no way he could run as fast as Randy.<br />
<br />
Harpinder&#39;s classes went by without much incident. Still, he was having a hard time calming down. Evey time him felt his cock was softening, something would excited him again. Being so proud of his academics, Harpinder loved to answer questions in class, and each time he could hear a snide comment from the students sitting behind him. Some would make fun of his accent, one whispered &quot;I bet his turban is so tall to hide all that extra nerd brain&quot;. Of course, there was also laughter from the occasional lactose induced flatulence. All this teasing was making his ass burn again. &quot;Criminey, my gluteus maximus sure is itchy.&quot; he whispered to himself as he arched his back and rubbed his cheeks against his seat. He imagined one of those teasing classmates behind him reaching into his pants and yanking him to high heaven.<br />
<br />
&quot;-and that is the end of today&#39;s lecture.&quot; came the voice of the professor, interrupting Harpinder&#39;s fantasy. &quot;Make sure you check the web portal for this week&#39;s assignments.&quot;<br />
<br />
Harpinder shook his head as he grabbed his book bag, &quot;I need to get a grip, it&#39;s not like me to daydream in class.&quot; He thought, &quot;at least I&#39;m done with classes. I still have a few hours before my study date with Rupi.&quot; Checking his phone, he noticed he received an email from the university administration. Apparently it was requested he report to the office of the dean of students at a scheduled time. &quot;Curious, perhaps I am receiving recognition for my academic achievements?&quot;<br />
<br />
Arriving in the administration building 15 minutes before the specified time, Harpinder was lead into the Dean of Students&#39; office by the receptionist. The impressive office had a grand wooden desk in the center, behind which sat a leather seat for the dean. On the other end were two swivel office chairs for students. The only thing that looked out of place in the office was the fact that the bully, who Harpinder encountered in the library, was sitting in one of the swivel office chairs. &quot;Wha- what are you doing here?&quot; Harpinder asked sheepishly. The bully glared with no verbal response.<br />
<br />
&quot;The Dean will be here shortly&quot; the Receptionist left and shut the door behind her.<br />
<br />
Harpinder sat at the other swivel chair and set his book bag in the floor in front of him. The bully was the first one to break the silence. &quot;Damn snitch, making a big deal out of nothing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I-I didn&#39;t say anything. Someone- another student reported it, remember?&quot; Harpinder stuttered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well it wouldn&#39;t have happened if you didn&#39;t make a scene&quot; the bully spat, &quot;you rag heads have what&#39;s coming to you. I should have pounded that other wimp too.&quot; His glare grew more intense. It was the first time Harpinder got a good look at the man&#39;s face. He had thick eyebrows sitting on his large brow, frown lines on his forehead, and dark circles under his cold blue eyes. His wide nostrils flared like a bull&#39;s, and he sported a chestnut brown goatee around his frowning mouth. He turned the focus of his angry eyes to Harpinder&#39;s book bag. &quot;What&#39;s this?&quot; He reached in and pulled out a white turban cloth. &quot;Damn, how many of these do you guys carry?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wha- how did that get in there?&quot; Harpinder winced he recalled a scrambled memory.<br />
***<br />
Harpinder was in a small office. Mandeep offered him a box full of turbans, &quot;Please, take that box home with you. It will be your supply for turban day.&quot; When Harpinder got back to his dorm that night, he placed most of the turbans in his wardrobe, but also put a few in his book bag.<br />
***<br />
&quot;That must have been from the memories I lost of last night&quot; Harpinder thought, &quot;but why did I bring so many turbans home? Never mind that, I can&#39;t let this guy keep that turban! Or else he might end up like Harri.&quot; Harpinder grabbed the other end of the white turban cloth and tried to pull it away from the bully. &quot;Please, give it back.&quot; Harpinder requested.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, let go you wimp&quot; the two stood in a rug of war for the turban. With one extra strong pull, the bully was able to free the turban from harpinder&#39;s grip. However, without Harpinder anchoring him, the bully stumbled backward and and fell back into the swivel office chair. It spun him around and around, wrapping the turban around his head.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh no no no, it&#39;s happening&quot; Harpinder tried to grab the turban to stop it, but it was spinning to fast. The turban was wrapping itself in an unusual way that Harpinder didn&#39;t immediately recognize. The white cloth spread down to the rest of the man&#39;s body, turning his western clothes into white kurta pajama. As the spinning slowed down, Harpinder started to see the rest of the changes. The man’s skin darkening to a Punjabi brown, darker than Harpinder’s skin. His cold blue eyes became brown and warm. There was a bright kindness to them. He still had dark circles under his eyes, but they now seemed less intimidating. More so the quality of a man wiser than his youth. His nose became more hooked, though his nostrils remained wide. He was taking deep, peaceful breaths. His thick eyebrows bridged together into a unibrow, no longer furrowed in anger. Frown lines disappeared from his forehead as he gained smile lines around his plump, smiling lips. His now black goatee got Thicker and grew up to meet the hair on his head. Once the spinning stopped and the turban finished wrapping itself, Harpinder recognized it was a Namdhari dastar, completing the man’s transformation into a Namdhari Sikh.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sat sri akaal&quot; the man greeted, placing his hands together as if in prayer. Before Harpinder could respond, the door to the office opened. A caucasian man wearing a suit in his early 40s walked in. He had dark hair that was greying at the temples and was clean cut like a politician. <br />
<br />
&quot;Good afternoon, Boys&quot; the older man said. &quot;I&#39;m Jonathan Patrick, the university&#39;s Dean of Students. You must be Harpinder Singh and..  Gus Robinson?&quot; Jonathan read the report he was holding, &quot;Excuse me, I misread that. Gursewak Randhawa.&quot; He butchered the Punjabi name.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Sir&quot; Gursewak nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure you both realize why you&#39;re here. It was reported that you, Gursewak, assaulted Harpinder here in the library.<br />
<br />
Gursewak bowed his head, &quot;I apologize, but that was an unfortunate misunderstanding. We Namdhari are pacifists. I would never attack a Sikh brother.&quot;<br />
<br />
Harpinder adjusted his glasses, he was in disbelief at what he saw. &quot;He&#39;s like a completely different person. When Harry became Harri, his personality stayed relatively the same. Now that Gus is Gursewak, it&#39;s like he did a complete 180. Has that happened to me as well? I&#39;m finding it difficult to remember who I was before I transformed this morning&quot; Harpinder thought.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you care to explain how this is a misunderstanding?&quot; Jonathan asked, &quot;The report makes it sound like a clear act of aggression.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gursewak nodded, &quot;I was in the library when I decided to introduce myself to a Sikh brother who was studying there. Satvinder if I recall. When I saw Harpinder walk towards us, I noticed he was about to trip and fall. I tried to catch him but by the time I could react, all I could grab was his underwear. I must have not realized my own strength as I lifted him off the ground.&quot; Gursewak smiled longingly Harpinder before bashfully looking away, &quot;er, accidentally of course! Once I realized what I&#39;d done, I released his underwear and it snapped around his gol parna. That&#39;s what our Sikh sister saw when she reported the scene.&quot; <br />
<br />
Jonathan took pause and blinked, withholding his expression of doubt. &quot;I can certainly see how that would be misunderstood... Harpinder, is this true?&quot;<br />
<br />
Harpinder thought to himself, &quot;I remember Gus being a typical racist bully. But now I also have memories of Gursewak&#39;s story being true. Since he&#39;s no longer the man who bullied me, I guess there&#39;s no point getting him in trouble.&quot; He sighed, &quot;Yes, Gursewak is telling the truth. It was neato of him to try and catch me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well then, I see no reason to repremand either of you. Please, let our conversation today be a warning to avoid these accidents in the future. You can imagine this looked like a fight to your fellow classmates. As the Dean of Students, it&#39;s my job to unite our diverse student body into one campus community. It will be harder for me to accomplish that goal if your classmates perceive infighting within the Sikh community.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I agree&quot; Gursewak beamed, &quot;it is the goal of all Sikh to stand united with people of all backgrounds. You share the Guru&#39;s wisdom, Mr. Patrick. Perhaps you would make a fine Sardar ji!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jonathan chuckled, &quot;Oh I don&#39;t know about that. Although I may look the part on the campus&#39; Turban Day. I hope to see both of you there, the Sikh Student Coalition could use more volunteers.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s right, Turban day&quot; Harpinder thought, &quot;that&#39;s why Mandeep gave me all these turbans. If I volunteer, will more people end up like Harri and Gursewak?&quot;<br />
<br />
Gursewak said, &quot;I&#39;ll consider it, it could be fun.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll let you boys enjoy the rest of your evening. Thank you for meeting with me today.&quot; Jonathan filed the report in his desk. Harpinder exited the administration building, followed by Gursewak.<br />
<br />
&quot;I am truly sorry for this morning, I pray you were not harmed&quot; Gursewak folded his hands and bowed his head.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s okay... It really wasn&#39;t that bad&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Really?&quot; Gursewak grinned &quot;well, is there anything I can do to make up for it?&quot;<br />
<br />
Harpinder felt his ass burning again.</p>
