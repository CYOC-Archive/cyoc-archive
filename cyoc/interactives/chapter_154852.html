<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You and Alex spend the following day on a futile attempt to search the jungles, but after hours and hours, you don&#39;t find anything interesting, except for some coconuts and bananas, both of which are foods that you and your cousin haven&#39;t tasted in weeks.<br />
<br />
The day after that, you search along the sea-cliffs, but you don&#39;t find any caves or openings, either under the water or above, except for the one that you know about but haven&#39;t explored yet, behind the waterfall in the lagoon. So you decide to head over to the lagoon and see what there is to see. Plus, you haven&#39;t interacted with any of the other mermaids since Yasmin left, and you and Alex both are starting to feel a little lonely in spite of each other&#39;s company.<br />
<br />
With three days left until the mermaids experience their egg-time, you return to the lovely lagoon, with its sea-lilies and rock-pools and natural waterfalls.<br />
<br />
And there are mermaids there: several of them, most of whom you&#39;ve met (and most of whom either you or Alex or both have made love to). Being the only merman around, you&#39;re instantly mobbed by a bevy of eager mer-girls as soon as they notice your arrival, and Alex is once again more than a little jealous at the attention you get from them. But you only have eyes for one mermaid: you can see Yasmin hanging out under the waterfall with Sally, trying to hide behind her girlfriend and make herself appear very small and invisible.<br />
<br />
You politely excuse yourself from your many admirers, and Alex runs interference for you, plenty happy to draw these bawdy mermaids&#39; attentions away from you and take them off your hands. While Alex makes herself the center of attention and cranks up her flirting skills to maximum, you swim across the lagoon and make your way over to where Yasmin is sitting.<br />
<br />
Before you can reach the waterfall, there&#39;s a small splash, and Sally floats in your way. &quot;Nuh-uh, don&#39;t even think about it, fish-boy,&quot; she says. &quot;Yaz told me what you did to her. She is *not* ready to forgive you, and I&#39;m not gonna *let* her forgive you anytime soon. You asshole.&quot;<br />
<br />
You try to argue. &quot;I was telling the—&quot; Wait. There&#39;s no point in arguing with Sally when Yasmin is right here. You say to her: &quot;I was telling the truth! Every word! Only now, me and Alex are stuck here with you, same as all the other mermaids!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuh. Sounds like you both just broke Rule Number Two, and after we warned you not to: you&#39;re dead. You&#39;re a fish. And you&#39;re never gonna leave here or ever be human again. Accept it, or you&#39;re just in denial and makin&#39; yourself and all the rest of us miserable.&quot; Sally folds her arms over her generous bust and glares at you.<br />
<br />
You look past Sally and up at Yasmin, perched on her rock, her eyes cast down to her tail. She idly splashes the water with her flukes, but she doesn&#39;t look up while you speak to her. &quot;Please,&quot; you say earnestly. &quot;I don&#39;t want us to be apart like this. Please, just let me apologize.&quot;<br />
<br />
Yasmin still says nothing. Then, after a moment, she too slides into the water, flits up to you and looks you in the eye. She says quietly: &quot;I suppose . . . it&#39;s only fair to make some allowances. I&#39;ve been here for decades, and it&#39;s only been weeks for you. Being turned into a mermaid . . . it was a lot to take in. And I&#39;d be lying if I said that I dealt with it gracefully.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sally shakes her head and says, &quot;Hm-mm, girl, you are *not* just going to take him back like that!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yes I am!&quot; Yasmin suddenly snaps. She throws her arms around you and plants a quick kiss on your lips.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just like that?&quot; you say.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just like that,&quot; answers Yasmin. Then she leans in very close and whispers into your ear, &quot;You&#39;re still *mine*. I&#39;m not going to let some other siren hussy sink her hooks into you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sally makes a chiding &quot;tsk-tsk&quot; noise and says to Yasmin, &quot;Girl, you&#39;re crazy. And you, Johnny-boy, you&#39;re still an asshole.&quot;<br />
<br />
You splash some water at Sally&#39;s face. &quot;None of us even *have* an asshole.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, what-EVER,&quot; Sally scoffs. Then she turns around, wiggles her but in the air as she flips her fin to dive underwater, and goes off to join Alex and the rest of the flirting mermaids in the lagoon.<br />
<br />
Yasmin touches your cheek and turns your head to face her, then kisses you, deeply and passionately. In short order, the two of you are sinking together down to the lagoon floor, wrapped in a tight embrace and exchanging heated kisses. You want to take it slowly and just enjoy being with your girlfriend again, but it&#39;s been a couple of days now, and you&#39;ve really missed her. <br />
<br />
So it&#39;s little wonder that you can&#39;t help yourself: you immediately go for her luscious boobs, groping her mounds, teasing the nipples until they&#39;re hard as pebbles under your fingertips and thumbs. You bend down and take one into your mouth, playing at the areola with your lips and flicking the hard little nipple with your tongue. Yasmin gasps and lets out a mouthful of bubbles that rise to the surface. Several minutes of this love play go by, and her frantic gasps of &quot;Don&#39;t stop, don&#39;t stop,&quot; and her clinging to your head by the hair, eventually gives way to frustrated cries of &quot;Stop—okay, stop now,&quot; and soft scratches across your back, when she at last can&#39;t take it anymore.<br />
<br />
You release your mermaid lover, and she gazes at you lovingly, her face flushed red with agonizing arousal and unresolved sexual tension. Then she smiles wickedly and attacks your chest in much the same that you attacked hers. You know, at the frenzied pace Yasmin is taking, you won&#39;t be able to stand this for very long. You can tell already that after a short few minutes you&#39;ll be at your limit and begging your beloved to stop.<br />
<br />
Only, this time, it&#39;s different. This time, it doesn&#39;t happen that way. When Yasmin started in on teasing and kissing your nipples, you were resolved to just lean back and enjoy the sensations for as long as you stand them, in spite of the fact that you knew you couldn&#39;t cum. But instead of reaching a frustrating brink where your nipples become overly sensitive and your need for Yasmin to quit becomes overwhelming, this time around, you come up to that edge and you find that your body is riding it—and riding it—and riding it—and it stays there for minute after minute. <br />
<br />
After ten minutes, Yasmin is giving you questioning looks, but you just look down and meet her eyes (she looks so incredibly fucking sexy with her big brown eyes lifted up to meet yours while she kisses your chest and tongues one of your nips) and smile and nod, and she shrugs and keeps going. After about fifteen minutes, her lips and tongue are actually starting to feel numb, but you&#39;re breathing heavily and whispering to Yasmin, &quot;Oh God—Oh God—don&#39;t stop—don&#39;t—yes—keep that up—yeah, just like—hrrrk—OOOOOH YEEEAAAAH!&quot;<br />
<br />
Yasmin is even more astonished than you are when you suddenly COME, from nipple-play alone, shooting your fish-milt out of your genital vent. Like a round from a paint-ball gun, it splatters all over her stomach; and even under water, the stuff is sticky enough to cling there. Yasmin just stares down at the mess of fluid coating her human belly, luxuriating in its warmth, and wondering at what&#39;s just happened.<br />
<br />
Your breathing starts to become regular again, and you heave out, &quot;Holy . . . mother of . . . that was . . . that was a real . . . what the hell got into you, Yaz?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Into me!?&quot; she asks. &quot;What got into you! That&#39;s not supposed to be—I mean, it should even be possible!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe it really is different for mermen,&quot; you speculate. &quot;Maybe, if the conditions are right . . .&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If so, that makes you the luckiest bastard in the universe,&quot; says Yasmin. She moves down along your body, peppering cute little kisses down your chest and stomach as she goes, until she crosses the line from skin to scales and takes a good, close look at your tiny fish-slit. There still a bit of white fluid clinging there, and you can feel the muscles around the vent still quivering from the aftershocks of your first orgasm in well over five weeks—and apparently, you realize, the first and only orgasm ever experienced by a mer-person.<br />
<br />
Yasmin kisses your slit, and you gasp. It feels *really* good. &quot;Oh, baby . . . if you do that a few more times, I might just—&quot;<br />
<br />
Your words are cut off when Yasmin kisses the scales outside your slit and tongues at the slightly-gaping opening. &quot;You know,&quot; she says to you between licks, &quot;Even without being able to come, making love as as a mermaid is still enjoyable. The lack of release is frustrating, but we all still keep on doing it. Because we love how it makes us feel.&quot; <br />
<br />
She dips her tongue as deeply into you as it will go (mere millimeters only — your vent is *not* by any means designed to be penetrated by anything), and you shudder and quiver and gasp out another fevered cry of &quot;Oh God!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;But you know,&quot; she continues on, while at the same time continuing to give you head (vent-ilingus? the odd term crosses your mind), &quot;I&#39;ve realized that I also really miss giving pleasure. Making a man squirm. Just . . . going down on a guy and sucking his cock.&quot; She increases the pace of her tongue on your slit, and you feel another contraction of muscles within yourself, and a second burst of semen shoots out into the water, this time catching Yasmin quite unexpectedly in the face.<br />
<br />
&quot;All right, just *what* in the hell is going *on* here?&quot; she exclaims.<br />
<br />
You stare at Yasmin&#39;s unexpected facial, and she stares back at you while she wipes the jizz off and pulls globules out of her hair.  Then you notice something else that&#39;s out of the ordinary, and a thought occurs to you.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait just a goddamn minute,&quot; you say. You take off the Atargatis amulet that you found in the shrine, and you gaze at the weirdly compelling object as you hold it in your hand. Then you place it around Yasmin&#39;s neck. She doesn&#39;t know quite what to make of this, but she doesn&#39;t resist when you start kissing her and pleasuring her again, much as you had been a short while earlier. <br />
<br />
* * * * * * * * * <br />
<br />
Yasmin&#39;s cries of unrestrained pleasure are loud enough to get the attention of the whole lagoon. By the time they arrive to investigate, Yasmin is quivering in your arms, her tail drooping and all of her muscles reduced to jelly from the chain of multiple, full-body orgasms you&#39;ve induced within her from kissing at her boobs and playing with her egg-slit. Yasmin finally opens her eyes, still glazed and half-lidded from the volcano of pleasure that had just erupted from her breasts and her loins, and she gazes at you and says, &quot;That was amazing, my love. You&#39;re incredible. Best I&#39;ve had in forty years.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sally and Alex swim up to the two of you, and Alex asks, &quot;What just happened?&quot;<br />
<br />
Sally gawks at you and Yasmin, and says, &quot;If I didn&#39;t know any better, I&#39;d think you just rocked her world!&quot;<br />
<br />
You take the amulet off of Yasmin&#39;s neck and pass it to Alex. &quot;Actually, I think we found a magic sex charm.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alex goes wide-eyed and peers closely at the amulet. &quot;A sex charm?&quot;<br />
<br />
You nod. &quot;I was able to come while wearing it. Then I put it on Yaz, and so was she.&quot; (Alex looks up at you, pleadingly.) &quot;Go on, take it for a while,&quot; you tell her. &quot;You could really use a good lay.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alex says not one more word. She just puts on the amulet, grabs Sally by the hand, swims over to where Liesl is gossiping about this scandalous new development with Xiuying and Fiona. She leads all four of them out towards the center of the lagoon. &quot;Someone find Menana and Nyah,&quot; you hear her order as she swims away. &quot;And Sakura, Bianca, and Jane. It&#39;s time for us to have some real fucking *fun*!&quot;<br />
<br />
Once all of the other mermaids are gone, and you are alone with Yasmin, you cuddle up with her, the both of you now sated and content.<br />
<br />
&quot;Word of that magical item is going to spread like—like a wildfire,&quot; says Yasmin. &quot;It will be hard for everyone to share.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ll make it work,&quot; you say, kissing Yaz on the forehead. You lie back on the sand. Now it suddenly feels like being here and living as a merman isn&#39;t such a bad deal after all; even if all the mermaids on the island have to take their turn with the amulet, it&#39;ll come back around to you and Yasmin eventually. And in the meanwhile, it&#39;s not like you and your girlfriend can&#39;t make love at all—like Yasmin said earlier, even without release, the sex-play is still enjoyable, and you&#39;ll keep doing it anyway because it still makes you feel good.</p>
