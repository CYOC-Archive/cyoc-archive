<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;... Sam older!&quot; Declared Jimmy as he lift his arm confidently pointing them towards Sam, who was bursting with excitement. Seconds passed as the duo waited while Jimmy as too busy trying to transfer what appeared to be energy beams from his hand with no success. &quot;So... do you feel like you&#39;re getting older?<br />
<br />
&quot;No... not really&quot; Sam replied disappoint.<br />
<br />
&quot;See I told you those rings are bogus&quot; Sneered Conner.<br />
<br />
&quot;They are not! My sister was there when it work with her friend, maybe she knows how to use them.&quot; Jimmy said as he open the door to his room. &quot;Hey Jennifer! Come up here for a second!&quot; Jimmy then shouted.<br />
<br />
It took a while but they soon heard the sluggish steps of his little sister as she made her way upstairs.<br />
<br />
&quot;What is it Jimmy?&quot; Jennifer asked as she saw her brother.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Jennifer you know how these rings work don&#39;t you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jennifer first reaction was to ignore her stupid brother&#39;s little game, but taking a closer look at the rings she notice it was the rings of age. At this moment Jennifer wanted to burst out and ask him where he got it. But she knew if Bobby somehow lost it, and that Jimmy kind of knows what the power it, then she had to use the adult mind Bobby left her with in order to trick her brother by playing innocent.<br />
<br />
&quot;Those wing are pwetty&quot; Jennifer replied, looking at them with amazement.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah yeah, I want to know how to change people ages with these, you know how right Jennifer?&quot; Jimmy insisted.<br />
<br />
Jennifer though continued to act innocent, tilting her head in order to feign confusion.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on Jimmy, your sister clearly has no idea what you&#39;re talking about.&quot; Conner stated.<br />
<br />
Jimmy was believe itself a bit even though he knew it was true, but at the same time maybe he was wrong. With frustration he pulled both ring out as he tossed them on the floor.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do we do now?&quot; Sam asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know what do you guys want to do?&quot; Jimmy followed up, &quot;...Hey Jennifer what are you doing?&quot; Jimmy asked as Jennifer was busy picking up the rings he drop on the floor.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your little sister just wanted to play with those bogus rings you stole.&quot; Conner answered while Jennifer slipped them onto each of her tiny ring fingers as the rings resized to fit perfectly.<br />
<br />
Jennifer then stood up, turning to face her brother and his friends with a smile over her face as she decided to show them a little surprise, not wanting to wait any longer, and their mom was out as well. &quot;I wish I was 5 years older&quot; she then said.<br />
<br />
The boys didn&#39;t expect much, but were shock when they saw her tiny little body tremble as it began to rise taller. The boys now watched with gaping mouth as Jennifer continue to rise taller by the second, her arms and legs getting longer and longer as the tiny clothes she wore grew tighter against her growing body. It wasn&#39;t long before they noticed her rising head quickly caught up to their own, only to pass it slightly with a final spurt as she reached the age of ten, making her now a little taller than her own older brother at the same age.<br />
<br />
The boy still looked over at disbelief, what used to be their friend&#39;s little sister was now a girl about the same age as them wearing clothing too tight for her body as her t-shirt now exposed most of all her stomach now. They watch as she let out a small grunt as she twists her body, feeling the constraint the clothes now brought her.<br />
<br />
&quot;I told you those rings were the real deal!&quot; Jimmy finally  said, &quot;Now Jennifer, can you make us all older too as well?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm... I don&#39;t think so,&quot; Jennifer smiled, &quot;I think my little brother needs a little punishment for stealing these rings from Bobby instead.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;L-little brother?&quot; Jimmy asked, &quot;You mean YOU&#39;RE my little sister, right?<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t think so Jimmy, not anymore&quot; Jennifer giggled as wished her brother to become 5 years younger.<br />
<br />
Jimmy felt something strange with his body as he began to dwindle in size.<br />
<br />
&quot;N-no Jennifer, you can&#39;t be...&quot; Jimmy whimpered as he realized the situation.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is what you get for being such a bad little boy&quot; Jennifer laughed as her brother continued to regress.<br />
<br />
Jimmy friend couldn&#39;t help but watch in horror as they saw their friend turn back into a little kid by his once younger sister, now older. It wasn&#39;t long until Jimmy regression was over, leaving a little 5-year-old boys&#39; head poking out from clothes much too big for him.<br />
<br />
Now that Jimmy was done de-aging, Jennifer thought it was time for a little growth for herself, giving Jimmy&#39;s friends a little show as she wished herself another 10 years of age.<br />
<br />
The boys now turned their eyes to Jennifer as she began to grow again. &quot;Here they come&quot; Jennifer smiled thrusting her chest out as she felt cones push out from her breast. Puberty hit Jennifer like a truck as her body quickly became shapelier by the second. The sounds of rips covered the room as her tiny shirt and pants could no longer keep up with her widening hips and inflating breast, and were at their breaking point.<br />
<br />
The boys couldn&#39;t look away as her clothes finally burst free with a final spurt against her teenage body, leaving only a tatter mess on the ground. The boys expected a growing naked brunette teenager to be standing in the middle of the room, but to their surprise Jennifer was wearing a blue bikini that quickly began to fit her figure.<br />
<br />
Jennifer had worn that blue bikini underneath her clothes, to surprise Bobby, but she couldn&#39;t wait any longer for him.<br />
<br />
The boys watched as Jennifer finished her growth, their heads tilted up only to see her massive tities swell out once more as her hips finished widening, giving her that perfect heart-shaped ass.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my god! This top is so tight! My boobies are going to burst!&quot; Jennifer gasped as she stretched her adult body a bit.<br />
<br />
Sam and Conner couldn&#39;t believe their eyes, what used to be their friend&#39;s little 5-year-old sister, was now a sexy grown woman wearing a scantily clad bikini which showed off her amazing assets, her massive boobies and round ass.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just where do you boys think you&#39;re looking?&quot; Jennifer giggled as she turned towards the two boys. The two boys though watch a bit as her breast jiggled, noticing her hard nipples poking through the soft material of the bikini. This made their face flush red as their turned their heads.<br />
<br />
Jennifer couldn&#39;t help but giggle at the innocent act of the little boys, but remembered she had something to asked them.<br />
<br />
&quot;So tell me, did you boys help my brother steal this rings for another kid?&quot;<br />
<br />
The boys face quickly return back to fear remembering what happened to Jimmy.<br />
<br />
&quot;N-No we didn&#39;t, that was all Jimmy idea, w-we didn&#39;t even know he took the ring from that kid, I swear&quot; the boys fumbled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is that so&quot; Jennifer replied. &quot;What to do now then...&quot; Jennifer wondered.</p>
