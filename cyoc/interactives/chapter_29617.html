<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><br>With his head raised up, David waited for the kiss from his father, no matter how wrong his actions might be. David wanted to be like his dad now, more than he ever had before. Rob was in decent shape before, lightly tanned and somewhat furred, with light brown hair. Now Rob was very muscular, with round and bulging pecs, toned biceps and triceps, and a flat stomach. His thighs were just as thick and meaty, his calves following suit being somewhat smaller, tapering down to his bare feet. Rob's whole body was covered in dark brown hair, from his hands and fingers, up his forearms to mid bicep/tricep, resuming at his collar bone, covering his entire torso. Underneath the man fur, Rob had a darker tan that developed rather quickly as he walked up to the door of his house.</br>
<br>Rob waived at the stranger as he closed the door behind him, meeting his son, face to face. Rob smiled, happy his son had reconsidered as he was extremely horny now. Rob hoped that his son would be willing to go as far as Rob wanted, but he wasn't going to push anything... right away at least. As Rob looked at David, he could feel his cock stir within his boxers. Slowly, his cock grew to full hardness, finding the hole to pop out and brushed against the side of the fabric, sending a chill of pleasure through his body. David, still looking up at his father doesn't notice the cock sticking out.</br>
<br>"David, I want you to keep looking at my face and not look away. I want you to keep eye contact with me at all times. Is that understood?"</br>
<br>"Yes sir, crystal clear!"</br>
<br>"Good, now that things are understood, I want to talk to you about something. I know you want to look like I do now and I know that you can't do it on your own. I have watched you try over the years, lifting weights, drinking bulking and protein drinks, even injecting yourself with pure testosterone to increase your manliness in every aspect. Right now, I am sure you are willing to do this because you are desperate to try anything, knowing that this has a very high chance of working. I know that you are aware, once I kiss you, you will automatically become gay and want to do whatever with me. I just want to be sure you are ok with that. Honestly, I really want you to be happy. Ever since your mother died, I have no contact with anyone, up till a few moments ago. All of that built up sexual tension grew when the other guy and I rolled around in the grass. David, that stirred some things up inside of me... and... I need release! Just don't be hasty in your decision, as I just want you to be happy."</br>
<br>"Dad... I know this is a big step and I really don't want you to think I am moving too hasty in this decision, but this is what I want. I am happy as long as you are happy, and I know you have been unhappy since mom died. This curse or whatever it is, may be a blessing. I know that the curse change from being gay red speedo men, to bearish and hung gay men isn't that much better, but I would be happy to be a gay bear man with you over anything else any day!</br>
<br>As David finished his sentence, David rose up onto the balls of his bare feet and kissed his father right on the lips. At first, Rob was in total shock, but with David's lips still planted on his father's, Rob relented and gave in. Rob opened his mouth, while David opened his and they allowed their tongues to swim around in each other's mouths. David and Rob took turns passionately sucking on each other's tongues and lips. When they pulled apart, Rob and David looked at one another, enthralled in eroticism, smiling at the other. Rob motioned down toward his freely hanging cock, but David didn't look as he was told not to.</br>
<br>"You are such a good lad David, you listen very well and for that I have a prize for you. Go ahead and look down, that is your prize and you may do what you want with it."</br>
<br>Only a few moments ago, David would have been repulsed by what he was about to do, but the passionate swapping of saliva changed all of that drastically. David thought kissing this man was normal and sexually arousing. Rob was no longer his father, he was just a sexual playmate. David could even feel the changes coming to his body. David tore off all his clothes, driven to do so, feeling restrained. As David looked over his body, his bones lengthened and thickened. His hands and fingers became meatier, all of his muscles bulked up and ballooned to look like his fathers. Dark brown hair grew out quickly, covering the same parts with dark brown hair and his skin tone deepened to the same as his dad's. David's face was also covered in a dense, dark brown beard, which would make any real man and his father proud. Rob  looked his son up and down, approving of the changes, especially to David's cock. His cock resembled Rob's cock to a tee and even though their bodies were the same, their faces remained different.</br>
<br>David looked at Rob's cock which was massive. The head was an inch and a half deep as well as a nicely shaped mushroom head, equally as girthy as Rob's shaft. The shaft of Rob's cock was an average seven and a half inches long, with no foreskin, but it was as thick as the widest part of a forty ounce bottle of beer. As David went to grab it, his hand slipped along the head and down the shaft, while covering David's meaty hand in precum. David knelt down and took the head of the cock in his mouth, savoring the flavor of the pre. As David went down slowly, Rob moaned in pleasure and his cock tensed. Thinking he was going to lose the opportunity of having more tasty, David pulled back to the tip quickly and Rob cringed in sensitive, low intensity pain.</br>
<br>"David, watch those teeth of yours. You went down on me perfectly, but when you came back up, you scraped me with your teeth.</br>
<br>David pulled off completely, not really wanting to in fear of losing the tasty liquid, to check his teeth. As David slowly brushed his tongue across his teeth, he noticed that they were much sharper than they were before David had a taste of Rob's meat.</br>
<br>"Uh... Rob... I think something is wrong! Check your teeth."</br>
<br>Rob does the same and realized that his too were sharper and longer than they were before engaging in their sexual deviance. Somwthing was definitely going on... but what?</br></p>
