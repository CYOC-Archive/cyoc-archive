<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It had been a few days now, and Jen was finally able to taste cooked meat once again. It tasted so good! It made the last few days worth it. She had nearly broken her streak when a dog had gotten a little too friendly with her crotch, but managed to just change her objection to sound like a loud growl just in time. <br />
<br />
Today is also the next grooming session too. If it was anything like last time, then it wouldn&#39;t be so bad, hopefully. When she was lead to her appointment, Jen had her wraps replaced again, and tightened a bit too. Her muzzle was adjusted and resecured into place after having come slightly loose from all of the catching she was doing.<br />
<br />
Jen just stood on the table like a good dog until one of the handlers brought out a needle. Jen felt a little timid upon seeing it, and even more so when they grabbed her mouth and stuck her tongue. Jen felt her tongue lose tension and slacked out the side of her mouth. Because of this, she slowly began drooling. But she didn&#39;t realize that the injection had a special purpose. It would only be the following morning when Jen would discover the true reason for her injection.<br />
<br />
Upon waking up from her night&#39;s sleep Jen let out a yawn, stretching her muzzle open wide, and curling her tongue in the process. She then used her tongue to lick her front teeth and lips of her muzzle clean of drool, when it finally registered with her. Her tongue shouldn&#39;t be this long. She could stick it out the front of her muzzle now with ease and pleant more of it to spare. <br />
<br />
Jen hurried to the water bowl and looked at her reflection. Sure enough, her tongue looked a lot more canine, and definitely was longer. With a sigh, Jen began lapping up the water, only to find it was now much easier to do with her new tongue. <br />
<br />
She then went over to gnaw on her bone for a while, and found that with her new tongue, it quickly became coated in her own slobber for once. And not only that, but when she was bored with it, her tongue loosely hung out the side of her muzzle while she panted. <br />
<br />
Panting was one of the new &quot;habits&quot; that was being ingrained into Jen. It started a few days ago, and was being routinely and also randomly trained into her body. As it wasn&#39;t normal, it had taken her a full day in order to find a good rhythm to pant to, but ever since she had, it has gone pretty smoothly. She was even learning to do it whenever tired or hot too, which was practiced in temperature controlled rooms set to be abnormally warmer than usual by having her run around until she was exhausted. Needless to say it was pretty effective as she almost didn&#39;t have to think about doing it now. <br />
<br />
They say that it takes 21 days to form a habit, but Jen was doubting that, or at least wanted an asterisk next to that saying that it is much faster if being forced and trained to become a dog. Or perhaps this was just the curse&#39;s fault for making her have to become a good dog? Either way, she was progressing through the indoctrination at a relatively decent pace.<br />
<br />
When the light on her kennel turned on, Jen got up onto her &quot;paws&quot; and stretched. She then followed out through the opening door and ran to the play area as she has been trained to do. Her tail was wagging with genuine excitement as she entered the open yard and took a deep sniff of the outdoor air. It was refreshing to say the least, and the sun felt nice on her bare skin too. <br />
<br />
Someone blue a whistle, and Jen let out a bark and ran as fast as her bound hind legs could towards the source, before taking a seat on the ground. It was one of the staff, Helen, who Jen particularly liked more than the others due to Helen giving her a bit gentler and kinder attention than the other staff members. Helen also was the granddaughter of that older man, and could get away with showing Jen just a tad more humanity than the others. So naturally, Jen became quite fond of her.<br />
<br />
But even if Helen would speak to her kindly, she still did so in a way an owner would speak to their pets. She was always the one who would keep an eye out for her too, and would stop the more &quot;frisky&quot; males from exploring Jen further than a prolonged sniff, or lick in Rex&#39;s case. She knew Rex was special to her favorite puppy, so she would let Rex do a little more than the others. <br />
<br />
What Jen failed to understand though, is that Helen was not doing this to be kind. She if anything, was even more involved with the dog-ification process than her grandfather. She loved watching people degrade into dogs and Jen&#39;s case was no different, though she did hold a particular interest in her since she had a dog kennel mate whom she would be going home together with once fully converted. <br />
<br />
It was Helen&#39;s own personally set goal to make Jen and Rex into proper mates by the end on their training, thus why she wouldn&#39;t scold Rex&#39;s actions too much. It also was why she was secretly lacing Jen&#39;s meat chunks with a chemical that would make Jen&#39;s urine smell (to dogs) like she was going into heat. <br />
<br />
Of course, Jen figured that the other dogs just felt that she was one of them now and didn&#39;t think anything further about their advances. She never would have guessed that it was due to her crotch smelling like she&#39;s a bitch in heat that is begging to be bred. Though she realized that Rex was a little more excited to be near her now than he had been. <br />
<br />
That night, while Jen was all curled up besides Rex and fast asleep. Helen snuck into her kennel and sedated both of them. She then extracted Rex&#39;s musk and Jen&#39;s scents as best she could, and created a mixture for each of them. She then injected the mixture of Rex&#39;s scent into Jen&#39;s nose, and did the same with Rex using Jen&#39;s scent. The chemical would alter Jen&#39;s olfactory nerve to find Rex&#39;s musky scent incredibly appealing and arousing, and she did the same for Rex with Jen&#39;s scent. <br />
<br />
So the following morning, Jen had a scent in her nose that she recognized from sleeping next to each other for almost a week, was Rex&#39;s. Only for some reason, she loved the smell even more than normal. In her hazy half asleep state, she turned around and placed her face near Rex&#39;s crotch, where the scent was strongest, and closed her eyes again, only now with a nose full of that wonderful smell that was kinda making her horny.<br />
<br />
Rex too, now with Jen&#39;s crotch near his nose, was growing aroused in his sleep and got errect. Jen had to open her eyes when something poked her face, and was shocked to find Rex&#39;s red and hard cock jabbing into her cheek. She wanted to pull her head back right away, but the smell. It was so strong. It was so inviting that Jen couldn&#39;t decide whether to pull her head away or push it closer. And before she even realized what she was doing, Jen started licking it. She may have given it a few good links before it clicked with her and she forced herself away even though she really didn&#39;t want to stop. <br />
<br />
As the scent lost strength now that it was further away, Jen was able to control herself much better, and tried to keep her distance from Rex for as long as she could for the rest of the day. But as per usual, that stopped once it became time to sleep, and Rex became very adamant about sleeping right beside her. She tried disueding him, but he just began ignoring her barks and growls and would flop right down next to her every time she moved. So, she reluctantly gave in and just let him sleep beside her while she did her best to not succumb to his inviting scent again, no matter how much she wanted to.</p>
