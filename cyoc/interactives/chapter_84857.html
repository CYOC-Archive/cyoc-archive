<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The next morning, Ty felt groggy. He looked at his clock before cursing, &quot;Shit! I&#39;m late!&quot;. It was 8:40, no way could he get ready for school in such a short time. He leapt out of bed and hurried to his wardrobe, but stopped suddenly as he caught himself in the mirror, and smiled. <br />
<br />
It was real. He was still the hottest 16 year-old in school, and he hadn&#39;t dreamt up the previous evening. Ty smiled, he realised what this meant, or at least implied. He inhaled, then exhaled deeply, calming himself, before saying: &quot;It is actually 7;00 this morning, and everyone else in the house is asleep. Nobody knows that time just changed.&quot; He opened his eyes. Sure enough, the light that had been slipping through the curtains was almost gone, the sun having reverted back to its position in the sky over an hour previously. Satisfied that he now had plenty of time, Ty walked over to a desk in the corner of his room, booting it up. <br />
<br />
As he logged on, he very quickly opened up his internet browser in a private tab. This was his routine since he discovered internet pornography; wake up early and whack off. Of course, back then he&#39;d been significantly smaller and less developed. Now, he was a total stud who everyone would love. Ty frowned at this. He realised that meant that girls would be interested in him and, being the gay guy he was, he wasn&#39;t going to enjoy that. Once again he closed his eyes and thought hard, &#39;Girls will not be interested in me, but guys will not refuse my advances&#39;. He didn&#39;t feel any different, though he was sure it would be apparent when he went to school. Sighing, he went back to browsing for illicit entertainment, and he soon found his favourite kind of video: rubber.<br />
<br />
yes, even back in his more nerdy days Ty had stumbled across rubber clothing online. When he&#39;d first seen it for what it was, he felt weird and soon became turned on. Now it had developed into a proper fetish, though for obvious reasons there was no way he could buy his own yet. Then he realised. He closed the browser at once and shut the laptop down, thinking to himself about what his powers could bring.<br />
&quot;Who needs porn when I can make whatever I want happen?&quot; He smirked. He stood up and made his next wish under his breath, &quot;I wish that I was made of rubber, stuff that will always regenerate whenever it gets damaged. It will never get dirty, it will not be affected by water, and my member will be at full attention!&quot; At first, nothing happened. Ty seemed quite confused at this, wondering why it hadn&#39;t taken effect. No sooner had these doubts crossed his mind when he suddenly doubled over, seemingly in pain but actually in ecstasy. He held out his hand in front of his face as he collapsed onto his bed, watching the tips of his fingers turn black and shiny, the rubber coat quickly moving down along his fingers, his wrists, his lower arm. Within a minute, it had migrated to and taken his entire torso, spreading down and up. It encroached on his newly-large penis and began to rubberise it, and as it did so it became permanently hard. Ty moaned in pleasure and couldn&#39;t resist tugging on his new cock, the feeling completely indescribable. The rubber coated his legs and toes, and then spread up his neck and reached his head. As it did so, his hair began changing all at once into a slightly thicker rubber that could be distinguished from the rest, and his face was soon taken. When he opened his eyes and came back to reality, Ty realised he had just sprayed a huge load of black semen which now contrasted the white which he had created last night. He looked at himself in the mirror once more and couldn&#39;t resist blowing a kiss. He was perfect now; the rubber had taken on the same colour as his skin and hair, and as a result he was still the hottest guy in his school. Then he realised that it was still noticeable that he was made of rubber. Time to fix that, he thought. And he wished away any chances of people realising that he was now a latex person, unless he wished it.<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
At about 7:45, Ty basked in a lovely hot shower. The water coursing against his new body felt astounding, and he wondered if he could make others like him. He then remembered Dustin, who he had vowed to take revenge on the previous night. But that could wait - he had potentially forever to do what he wished, he was effectively a god now. Beaming, he shut off the water and wiped himself down with a towel, his rubber body glistening as though beneath a photoshop effect. Normally Ty would have enjoyed his breakfast, but then he realised that since he was rubber both inside and out, he didn&#39;t need to eat, and presumably he wouldn&#39;t sweat or need the toilet either. Completely perfect...<br />
<br />
So Ty decided to pass the time with some video games. He had several consoles (all previously Dustin&#39;s) to choose from, and he eventually settled with a strange action-RPG game for his Playstation Three. It was an enjoyable experience; all the male characters were interesting and more importantly to Ty they were really hot. He pondered about making them real, but decided against it for now - there&#39;s plenty of guys at school he could have fun with!<br />
<br />
At 8:50, Ty caught the morning bus to school. As he boarded with Dustin at his side, he sexily scanned the bus with his eyes, trying to single out someone he could take an interest in. Dustin hadn&#39;t noticed the rubber change - how could he, when he wasn&#39;t given an exception clause like when Ty had wished to be the hottest guy? Eventually he settled near the back, sitting next to a guy the same age as him with long, blond hair and green eyes. The boy seemed like a bit of a recluse, and in all honesty Ty hadn&#39;t noticed him before. But now things were different, and Ty caught the boy eyeing him up every now and then. <br />
&quot;See something you like?&quot; Ty smirked. The boy became flushed very quickly.<br />
&quot;N-No, I don&#39;t, It&#39;s just nobody sits next to me on the bus.&quot;<br />
&quot;What&#39;s your name?&quot; Ty asked, curious.<br />
&quot;I&#39;m Chris. Chris Parker, I usually sit at the back of your class.&quot; Chris responded. Ty remembered now, the little nerdy guy at the back who never said a word. Well, he thought,that will all change.</p>
