<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The chilly night air felt heavenly to Cole, as he continued to bounce through the neighbourhood. His body, especially his plump, foxy ass, still felt burning hot and hiding between his furry cheeks, his black hole was still slightly gaping and leaking Foxy’s pre. With each step, it quivered and clenched around nothing, trying to keep the juice from escaping, but it was a losing battle. Before too long, he had a trail running all the way from his puffy black hole, to his swollen balls.<br />
<br />
It wasn’t the only thing leaking though. The bobbing piece of fox meat between his legs still stood stubbornly erect and ready for action. Twitching in tandem with his hole, it was sending his own foxy essence all over his fluffy belly and the ground beneath him. Without realising it, the seven-years-old fox boy was spreading a trail of thick and virile musk through his neighbourhood.<br />
<br />
Cole’s panic about his mother managed to dissipate rather quickly, thanks to the surges of pleasure his brain was constantly receiving. Before too long, the more-fox-than-boy was idly walking through the night, instead of running for his life. <br />
<br />
“Foxshie!” Called out Cole, even if his words were more yipping than talking at this point. Sadly, he did not receive an answer, outside of some dogs barking in the distant. The disappointment caused his tail and ears to droop a little, but his pleasure-drunk mind could not feel sad for long. His friend must have been quite spooked by his mother, but he was sure they would find each other again.<br />
<br />
With his mind a bit calmer now, he really began to came to terms with what was going on. He really had done it! He had run away from home and could now life as a fox. Happy emotions bubbled up inside of him, causing his tail to raise up and wag in the air behind him, flashing his leaky cheeks to anyone willing to look.<br />
<br />
His dream had come true… that would show his parents for being such a bunch of mean and boring humans. Though, there was one thing he was sure he would miss, his mother’s cooking, especially her roasted chicken. The memory of its crispy skin and juicy insides was making Cole salivate, or well, it would, but all it created was a dry feeling in his mouth.<br />
<br />
All the panting, running, and leaking must have dried him out quite a bit. The last thing he had to drink was the cola after all, and that one had quickly left his body again. In the back of his mind, a strange feeling of pride bubbled up as he remembered how he marked his territory earlier and his cock flexed along with it, as if it was trying to nod in agreement.<br />
<br />
Thankfully, he was close to their local playground/park and he knew for a fact it had a pond. With a target now in mind, Cole darted through the night, while still keeping an eye out for flashes of orange. He found their playground without problems, it was strange to see the place at night, if he was honest. The play area felt so death, without his friends playing and laughing… not to mention the toilet building looked creepy. But alas, he was here for water and nothing else. The pond was as clear and clean as it had been earlier today and as he stepped closer to it, he could not help but admire his reflection in the moonlight.<br />
<br />
He really had turned into a handsome fox, in his opinion. Unlike some pictures he had seen, of foxes all thin and gangly, his legs were plump and his fur looked fluffy and healthy. Without knowing why, he turned around and lifted his tail higher, then turned his head to look at his ass. His cheeks were still soaked and glistened in the moonlight and for the first time, he laid eyes on his rubbery-black hole. He did not know why, but the sight was causing his cock to swell harder, throbbing against his belly. It took a moment for him to snap out of it, but then he turned and plopped his ass down on the dew-covered grass. The feeling of the wet grass against his hole made him shiver, it just felt so nice. Rubbing his ass down against it, he leaned forward and dipped his muzzle into the pond.<br />
<br />
The second the cold and refreshing water had made it past his lips, Cole began to greedily guzzle it down like he hadn’t drank in days. Gulp after gulp, the liquid filled his stomach, filled what room had been made during his change. As his stomach bulged under the amount, the boy meanwhile enjoyed the cool feeling rushing over him. It was like whatever fire had been started inside him had been quelled for the moment. He had no clue how long he sat there, but as he finally lifted his head and stood up, the extra weight made him quite wobbly on his legs.<br />
<br />
Water sloshing in his belly with each step, Cole was slowly making his way back to the road, he wanted to look for Foxy after all.<br />
Before he even made it a foot however, the spicy aroma of his favourite potato chips reached his nose and soon after it was joined by the sweet smell of gummy bears and other snacks. Not able to help himself, the fox followed his nose to the nearby hedge and pocked his head through it.<br />
<br />
A well-kept garden greeted him, filled with all sorts of toys, both new and old. In the centre of a large path of grass stood a brand-new tent. No lights could be seen, but he was able to hear a faint snoring. It was the house of Jim, the classmate that had traded him his foxy pill. Cole vaguely remembered the boy saying he got a new tent and was going to test it out today. He must be smelling the snacks he had stashed inside his tent and while he had food just a while ago, he still would not say no to them. Not to mention, he would be able to show off his new form to his friend… but then again, there was also Foxy still out there. What to do…</p>
