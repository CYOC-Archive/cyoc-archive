<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">While Ben gets used to his… her… new body, Lucy arrives at the office where Lisa is waiting for her, “ah, Lucy,” Lisa says when Lucy walks in, “good timing, I have just finished typing the contract and preparing the documents you’d need to sign. Please read the contract and other documents thoroughly, if you have any questions, just ask”.<br />
<br />
Lucy nods, taking a seat at Lisa’s table, “okay,” the 8-year-old says and begins reading the documents, starting with the contract:<br />
<br />
ADULT STUDENT CLAUSE:<br />
This Agreement, dated the ________ day of ________________, 20___ is made between Rainbow Riding Academy Inc.<br />
and _______________________________________(STUDENT). These parties warrant<br />
that they have the right to enter into this AGREEMENT.<br />
MINOR STUDENT CLAUSE:<br />
I, ______________________________________, (Parent/Guardian) have contracted with Rainbow Riding Academy Inc. on the _________ day of _______________, 20____ to give<br />
_______________________________________ (rider‘s name & age) riding lessons. These parties<br />
warrant that they have the right to enter into this AGREEMENT.<br />
This agreement is binding and will remain in place until 1 CALENDER MONTH‘S written notice by<br />
either party is given. All notices will be emailed or hand delivered to the other party. It is hereby<br />
agreed that: The STUDENT wishes to enrol for riding lessons at Crindle Stables under the<br />
following conditions:<br />
<br />
1) PAYMENT:<br />
1. Riding Lessons are to be paid in advance on the last riding session attended of each month.<br />
Only bank transfer, pay pal, and cash is acceptable and is payable to Crindle Stables. Please<br />
place all cash in an envelope with your name on it so as not to confuse your payment with<br />
another student’s payment.<br />
2. Late Payments will incur a $5 penalty.<br />
3. Annual Crindle Stables subscription of $20 payable to receive reduced rates.<br />
<br />
2) LESSON FEES:<br />
• Lessons are weekly and are taken on a monthly basis and are scheduled per student on the<br />
agreed day and time.<br />
• Lessons will be paid for the following month depending on the amount of lesson weeks in the<br />
month (either 4 or 5 lessons per month)<br />
• The fees are fixed from January 2024 to December 2024.<br />
• December riding lesson fees are payable as per normal payment rules as lessons to be missed<br />
while the riding school is closed will be caught up in advance.<br />
• MINOR STUDENT LESSON FEES: ON A SCHOOL HORSE OR YOUR OWN HORSE:<br />
30-minutes $15-$20 per lesson or 60-minutes 50$ per lesson.<br />
Lessons for children under 7 years of age may be shortened based on the attention span of the<br />
child. Some younger children get tired of an activity after so long and can only pay attention for a<br />
short period of time. The lesson will end early if your child loses their attention to the activity as<br />
this would be considered unsafe.<br />
Private Riding Lesson, Equine Therapy Lesson, Group Riding Lesson (No more than 3<br />
riders)<br />
30-minutes 40-minutes<br />
<br />
<br />
3) ABSENCES AND RE-SCHEDULING:<br />
1. In the event of your lesson coinciding with poor weather, such as rain and where riding<br />
conditions are considered unsafe, such a lesson must still be attended and will be held as an<br />
unmounted lesson.<br />
2. In the event that a student needs to reschedule a lesson for any reason such as illness or in an<br />
emergency, it is at the discretion of the Riding Instructor and their availability. We will make all<br />
attempts possible to try to reschedule a lesson, but please understand that if the riding program is<br />
full there may not be available slots to make up a lesson.<br />
3. Only 1 lesson per month may be re-scheduled unless prior arrangements are made with the<br />
relevant Riding Instructor.<br />
4. Riders must call to cancel a lesson AT LEAST 24 HOURS in ADVANCE, otherwise it will<br />
automatically be considered absence without notice. If you do not call to cancel the lesson, you<br />
will not be permitted to make up the lesson and will be deemed as taken and be required to be<br />
paid in full.<br />
5. In the event of an emergency or sickness, please call to cancel the riding lesson as soon as you<br />
are aware that you will not be able to attend the lesson but no later than 3 hours prior to your<br />
lesson time.<br />
6. Please do not send an e-mail, text or WhatsApp to cancel a lesson. We cannot guarantee we<br />
will receive the e- mail or WhatsApp message prior to the lesson. Only phone call cancellations<br />
will be considered for excused absences or make-up lessons.<br />
<br />
4) PUNCTUALITY:<br />
1. I understand that lesson times are planned and that I need to be on time. CS aims to be on<br />
time however with animals there is an element of unpredictability. If the lesson is started late due<br />
to Crindle Stables the lesson time length will remain as planned.<br />
2. If I am more than 15 minutes late from my scheduled time, I will not be permitted to participate<br />
in the lesson unless otherwise agreed and it will be considered an unapproved lesson absence,<br />
unless I have made prior arrangements.<br />
3. I further understand that even if I am late, the time for ending the lesson will remain as<br />
scheduled, if the lesson commenced late. If we can accommodate extension we will try to do so.<br />
4. The only condition for extending my lesson time is if the Riding Instructor is not present<br />
at the scheduled lesson time.<br />
<br />
5) INSTRUCTORS AND PONIES/HORSES:<br />
1. I understand that Crindle Stables reserves the right to substitute a riding instructor in the event<br />
that their regularly scheduled riding instructor is unable to be present at the lesson.<br />
2. I understand that it is my responsibility prior to entering the lesson area to inform the Riding<br />
Instructor of any new medical or physical problem which may impact my safety or ability to<br />
perform correctly during my scheduled riding lesson.<br />
3. There are horses available for each level of riding from the beginner rider to the more advanced<br />
rider who needs to be challenged. Beginner horses in our Stables are known for their quiet<br />
dispositions to help our beginner riders build confidence and learn the basics of riding. As the<br />
rider becomes more comfortable with the basics of riding, they will move to the more advanced<br />
horses. These horses will challenge the rider and will take them beyond the basics.<br />
4. Crindle Stables does not guarantee that the student will ride the same horse/pony every<br />
lesson, nor do we believe that this is conductive to rider progression; and / or said horse might be<br />
ill or have sustained an injury which makes it unable to be ridden. Riders will be allocated a mount<br />
that is suitable for their ability.<br />
<br />
6) RIDING WEAR:<br />
1. Proper attire must be worn for riding lessons, which is to be long pants with the ability to<br />
stretch i.e breeches/jodhpurs, shirt, shoes/boots with at least a half inch heel, and an approved<br />
riding helmet that fits correctly with an attached harness. Students are not required to provide<br />
their own helmet.. We have helmets available for use in the event the student does not have his/her own helmet but recommend that each student has their own correctly fitting helmet.<br />
2. A rider must wear a helmet at all times when working with and when mounted on the horse.<br />
3. Half chaps or gaiters and riding gloves are recommended for junior and adult riders.<br />
<br />
7) INDEMNITY:<br />
1. I recognise the inherent risks of injury involved in any type of horseback riding generally and in<br />
learning to ride in particular. Horses are animals with minds of their own. No horse is a completely<br />
safe horse. Horses are 5 to 10 times larger, 20-40 times more powerful and 3-4 times faster than a<br />
human. If a rider falls from a horse to the ground the distance fallen may be from .5m to 2m and<br />
may consequently cause injury to the rider. If a horse is frightened or provoked it may divert from<br />
its training and act according to its natural survival instincts; which may include but not limited to:<br />
stopping short, changing direction or speed at its own will, shifting its weight, rearing, biting,<br />
bucking, kicking, or running from danger.<br />
2. No lesson will be given unless this contract is completed in full and a rider registration form<br />
completed.<br />
3. In taking lessons at Crindle Stables, I assume any such risk of injury and further, I voluntarily<br />
release Crindle Stables, its instructors, managers, grooms and agents from any responsibility on<br />
account of any injury I or my child or ward may sustain while receiving instruction or while riding in<br />
connection therewith, and I agree to indemnify and hold harmless Crindle Stables, its instructors,<br />
managers, grooms and agents on account of any such claim.<br />
4. Likewise I accept full responsibility for friends and visitors accompanying myself to CRindle<br />
Stables property.<br />
5. Crindle Stables, its instructors, managers, grooms and agents are not liable for an injury to, or<br />
the death of, a participant in equine activities resulting from the inherent risks of equine activities.<br />
<br />
8) LESSON POLICY STANDARD:<br />
• A Pony Toddler or beginner Lesson is 30 minutes in length, A Private Riding Lesson is 30 -40<br />
minutes in length, A Group Riding Lesson is 45 minutes in length and can consist of grooming,<br />
tacking up, mounting, tack adjustments, exercises while mounted, cool down time,<br />
dismounting, and untacking.<br />
• After the Riding Instructor determines that the student is advanced enough to tack up on his or<br />
her own, students will be permitted to arrive no more than 15 minutes early to groom and tack<br />
up their lesson horse. Rainbow Riding Academy Inc. and its instructors feel that it is very important not just<br />
to teach riding but to also teach safety, proper grooming techniques, horse handling, and how<br />
to properly tack your horse. Good horsemanship skills are essential for anyone handling or<br />
riding a horse.<br />
• The Riding Instructor additionally has the responsibility of safety for riders, volunteers, and<br />
horses at all times; therefore, the Instructor has the right to deviate from the above lesson<br />
outline when safety is a concern<br />
<br />
9) IMPORTANT:<br />
• Parents are encouraged to watch their children’s riding lesson.<br />
• Please do not use lesson time to discuss issues with the Riding Instructor. Riding Instructors<br />
and volunteers must stay focused on the current lesson for safety reasons. Please call the<br />
Riding Instructor on 098666718 outside of lesson times for all questions and<br />
concerns that you may have.<br />
• The Riding Instructor has other lessons scheduled after your lesson and cannot be discussing<br />
issues during lesson time.<br />
• Please do not talk with your children during their lesson. It distracts your child and<br />
compromises their safety.<br />
• Rainbow Riding Academy Inc. hosts training Show Jumping, Equitation, Eventing, Showing and Dressage<br />
shows on a regular basis and riders are welcome to partake. Crindle Stables charges a<br />
separate rental fee which is not included in the show entry fee.<br />
• Cars parked at Rainbow Riding Academy Inc. are done so at the owners own risk. Rainbow Riding Academy Inc. accepts no<br />
responsibility.<br />
• Rainbow Riding Academy Inc. have merchandise available for purchase. It is nice to see Crindle Stables<br />
Riders partaking in the CS ethos.<br />
•<br />
10) STABLE RULES:<br />
1. Horses may be loose on the premises and all students, visitors and children must stay within<br />
designated areas.<br />
2. Please do not go to the grazing paddocks without being accompanied by an employee,<br />
manager or agent of Rainbow Riding Academy Inc.<br />
3. Children under the age of 12 must be under their parents supervision at all times.<br />
4. Only students, riders and instructors are allowed into the riding arenas.<br />
5. Parents/ Guardians to lead or provide leaders, ( if a volunteer is requested to lead please<br />
reward them) please arrive 5 min before to allow leaders to receive guidance on how to lead.<br />
6. No loud shouting, swearing, whistling, clapping or banging around horses and riders.<br />
7. No playing of balls or throwing things is permitted.<br />
8. Please do not litter – use the dustbins provided around the stable yard area to dispose of<br />
garbage. NO SMOKING POLICY on site.<br />
9. Horses are unpredictable and do bite and kick and, even if in their stables, should be<br />
approached with caution – children who do not have their own horses stabled at Crindle Stables<br />
are not allowed to go near or enter a stable without instructor or supervision.<br />
10. For your own safety - all instructions by Stable Managers or Instructors must be adhered to at<br />
all times.<br />
11. Remember carrots for your noble steed! Please place on the ground for them to enjoy. Small<br />
treat bags of meal are available to purchase.<br />
12. Instructor will determine lesson ability and people may up & down to improve skill and<br />
promote confidence.<br />
13. For those who had ridden before a private lesson to assess ability is recommended.<br />
I, the undersigned, have read and understand the above contract, which I agree to abide by in<br />
total, and I have kept a copy of this contract. I further understand that if any of Crindle Stables<br />
policies or rules are not followed that Crindle Stables has the right to cancel this contract in full<br />
without any refund of money.<br />

After reading the massive text, Lucy looks up at Lisa, “sounds all good to me,” she says, smiling, “so, since I’m a minor, my parents need to fill this out and I’ll bring it around when I start my lesson tomorrow?”<br />
<br />
Lisa nods, “correct,” she says.<br />
<br />
“Okay,” Lucy says, then she focuses on the other documents: one is about breeding and the other is about having her “Horse” checked out by a Vet. Lucy looks up at Lisa, “what does “breeding” mean,” she asks.<br />
<br />
“Breeding is when a male Horse mounts a female Horse, mounting is when the male jumps on the back of the female, and inserts his pee-pee into the female to make babies,” Lisa explains.<br />
<br />
“Hm… nah,” Lucy says, “I don’t want Star to be bred,” she says, ‘I’ve already done enough to Ben, I don’t want him to go through having to birth a baby horse… I mean… I am not THAT cruel,’ the little girl thinks to herself.<br />
<br />
“Okay, no problem,” Lisa says, “hand me that form and I’ll just put it aside,” and Lucy hands the lady the “breeding agreement” form.<br />
<br />
Lucy then reads the form about the Vet, “so, the Vet would give star shots to keep her healthy?”<br />
<br />
Lisa nods, “correct,” she says, “our Vet knows what he’s doing and he’ll make sure that Star will always stay healthy! Would you like Star to only get her shots or the whole package? I personally would recommend you to have her receive the complete package”.<br />
<br />
“Hm… yeah, I think it would be the best if Star would have the Vet check her over,” Lucy says, “and I guess, to prevent anything serious suddenly to happen, the complete package sounds like the right and best thing for her. I mean, I just got her, and I don’t want something bad to happen to her”.<br />
<br />
Lisa smiles, “very well, I’ll have him check her and do his stuff in the morning before your lesson,” she says, “don’t worry, Star will be fine, I promise. I assume she isn’t registered and not chipped?”.<br />
<br />
Lucy shakes her head, “no, does… does she have to be chipped and registered?”<br />
<br />
“Of course,” Lisa says and explains what punishment could come if the justice system would find out.<br />
<br />
Lucy thinks for a while, ‘I don’t think it’ll be so bad,’ she thinks to herself, ‘I assume that, when Ben transforms back in two weeks, that the chip and registration will be deleted when the reality returns to normal’. She then looks up at Lisa, “okay, I’d like her chipped and registered in my name, since she is mine!”<br />
<br />
“That can be arranged,” Lisa chuckles, “I’ll have the Vet do everything before you arrive! He’ll send the invoice to your parents”.<br />
<br />
Lucy smiles, “sounds good to me,” she says, unaware to Lucy, the whole package also includes having “Star” not only chipped and registered as HER Horse, but also that “she’d” have a GPS tracker implanted.<br />
<br />
“For now, we have every we need, just remember to bring the filled out contract back tomorrow,” Lisa says, “if you or your parents have any more questions, don’t hesitate to ask”.<br />
<br />
Lucy nods, “will do, thanks Lisa,” she says, “I can’t wait to start my lessons tomorrow!”<br />
<br />
Lisa chuckles, “I can tell,” she says, “I’ll see you tomorrow at 3pm, if something should come up, like, if Star needs time to regain her composer after the treatment, I’ll let you know and we’ll simply move the first lesson to the day after!”<br />
<br />
“Okay,” Lucy says, she then grabs her and Ben’s belongings and heads home, beaming all the way.</p>
