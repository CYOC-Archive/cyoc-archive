<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Getting close to eleven and knowing that Susie was getting to the point of &quot;quarantine&quot; was nerve wracking and made me rather nervous. In some ways it was strange to be nervous over what happened to everyone over the past forty years, but it was. For I&#39;d learned a lot since I&#39;d first asked mommy about quarantining those that were starting to go into puberty, as to a degree, that was something that the smart kids and some of the adults that had more self control over others. Some of it was also recognizing how some adults behaved as well and being able to see how they behaved more often and it let me better understand how the quarantine system worked.<br />
<br />
It wasn&#39;t quite like Susie was going to be taken to some walled camp and locked away until she completed her transformation and released into the woods. That had been part of my initial fears as there were often a lot of places around town that made that kind of thing seem more possible. Old warehouses and things that often had walls around them, kid society largely used them as large indoor playgrounds for days when it was rainy. In reality, the &quot;quarry&quot; was another section of town that was closer to its edge and in a sense could be easily accessible to those kids in the inner sections of the old town as well. The only thing that separated them were some open fields and had enough distance that Susie would be moved to a new house of her own to live in, with others going into the last stages of puberty and await her final transformation.<br />
<br />
It also meant that little kids could in theory visit, so long as they were accompanied by parents, as it had been seen that even adults that had limited self control over their lusts were still instinctively protective over their little kids and wouldn&#39;t let another adult or puberty charged young-adult bring any arm to their &quot;baby.&quot; Though it was still something that adults that had low self control generally didn&#39;t stay in town, and only came in shortly before giving birth and then raising their little ones. And during that time, they would spend a fair amount of time traveling from &quot;home&quot; to the woods outside of town to sate their lusts, which was sort of how mommy operated. She had more self control outside the full moon and less during the full moon. But one of the adults at the school who helped the smart kids teach others had provided assurance that adults weren&#39;t dumb. They were just running so high on libido driving hormones that those with low self control didn&#39;t necessarily show it, and it also meant that once fully mature they&#39;d often have the sense to leave little kids alone.<br />
<br />
But Susie wasn&#39;t a little kid anymore. She was nearly 19 and in the general time frame when most kids began going into the second stage of puberty and in that time, as her changes accelerated her urges would have the potential to climb even higher than the adults while going through that transition. She might not truly pose a threat to little kids, in which some of her own fears were likely wrong, but that didn&#39;t mean real control was there. Thus the &quot;quarry&quot; was easier for her to adjust to new and ever stronger drives without either risking me or embarrassing herself when someone she took interest in took a sexual interest in mommy over her. Though that didn&#39;t necessarily mean that I really wanted Susie to go. I remembered her being there throughout my life and we had been the only two children that mommy had had.<br />
<br />
Now, as I sat by a window in a small and modest house, I was essentially waiting for the last time I would be able to talk with Suzie before she had to go in the &quot;ambulance&quot; to quarantine. Most of the ambulances for this were typically a horse drawn wagon with cushioned seats as they were the things that could be easily maintained. For when most of the adults became super horny hermaphroditic &quot;monsters&quot; those that knew how to repair car engines weren&#39;t available and the heavy industry needed for the parts were no longer operating. The result was that fewer people drove anywhere and left the use of things like cars only for emergencies, and most of the ones you&#39;d seen were often parked on the side or roads or other places and largely rusting away under the weather. The wagons, though were easier to replace, less complicated to build and maintain, and the horses bred naturally. How they tolerated their &quot;monster&quot; or children handlers was something I&#39;d never considered for long and most of what I knew was based on what teachers and friends had told me.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re waiting for them?&quot; came another voice from behind me, and I turned to find Suzie standing there.<br />
<br />
Like mommy often did, Suzie was standing their naked a duffel bag hanging over one shoulder and coming down to her hip. Adults often were naked as their monster forms often made clothing uncomfortable. Fur made it itch, those that grew extra limbs couldn&#39;t wear standard clothes and for many as they felt their libido&#39;s super charge to the point where sex was about all they could think about. Even those entering the second stage of puberty began to lose that sense of shame, and it was pretty clear that Suzie was well into that phase. Her boobies were smaller than mommy&#39;s as was her &quot;peepee,&quot; but it was pretty clear that Suzie was going into stage two, and the ambulance for &quot;the quarry&quot; would be arriving soon.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wanted to be able to say... to say good bye,&quot; I said weakly with a few tears.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s not necessarily good bye,&quot; Suzie answered, &quot;if you can get message ahead and have mom escort you... you may be able to visit from time to time. But it will need to come a message ahead to schedule that visit... as otherwise... you&#39;ll walk in on me having sex. And even if it&#39;s not that...&quot; Suzie paused and let out a rather heavy moan while one hand came up to one of her budding boobies. &quot;Then in a year or so... when I complete my transformation... maybe I&#39;ll come visit with my first baby. By then mom will probably have had another kid and you can help us look after both of them. You know, like how a lot of adults count on their kids to help with the really little kids. It&#39;ll be your responsibility, just as I helped mom with you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But I don&#39;t want to be alone,&quot; I said weakly and looked down to the rather plain clothes that kids wore.<br />
<br />
&quot;And you won&#39;t be,&quot; Suzie answered, &quot;you got your friends at school. You got mom for parts of the month. I know she&#39;s probably out looking for a fuck right now... mmmm... a... fuck.... but still. You won&#39;t be alone. And in time we&#39;ll see each other again. In a few short years, you&#39;ll start to hit puberty too and begin your journey to becoming a monster. And then we can meet again in the woods and go looking for mates together.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s still like seven years away,&quot; I answered weakly.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know... but you&#39;ll have to be strong,&quot; Suzie answered, &quot;and I know you can do it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know,&quot; I answered, &quot;I love you, Suzie.&quot;<br />
<br />
Suzie gave a bit of a smile, almost the same sort of sisterly smile I always remembered her having, though it was also interrupted by a knock at the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;I love you too, Molly,&quot; Suzie spoke, &quot;Just like mom loves you. And that&#39;s why I need to go. I know what&#39;s coming... and I can&#39;t know how much control I&#39;ll have until I&#39;ve finished becoming a monster. Hopefully, I&#39;ll have enough control to be able to come back and at least provide you with some protection.&quot;<br />
<br />
With that, Suzie then blew me a kiss and walked around the couch and approached the door. She reached for it and opened it to reveal a pair of kids that worked with the town&#39;s security and medical services. They were gray shirts and pants and carried a pair of wooden baseball bats. As I slowly moved from the chair by the window to a stop a bit behind Suzie to look out, I could seethe wagon that was the ambulance that often took those going to &quot;the quarry.&quot; It wasn&#39;t huge but the rear area was large enough to hold four, the two guards, Suzie, and one adult monster, who&#39;s form like a Satyr. She was known to have good enough self control to be able to manage those going into puberty.<br />
<br />
&quot;Susan Trench, with your mother out hunting, you are to come with us,&quot; the Satyr said firmly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course Mrs. Swarzz,&quot; Suzie answered, recognizing the Satyr as someone our mother occasionally went out with during the full moon. Before she went out the door, Suzie looked back to me, &quot;See you around, squirt. And remember, I love as only a big sister can.&quot;<br />
<br />
With that Suzie went with them. I followed to the door, but went no further. I stood their and watched as the medical team too Suzie off to the &quot;quarry,&quot; or at least as far as I could see the wagon. Once they were out of sight, I shut the door and then went to sit the middle of the living room... alone...</p>
