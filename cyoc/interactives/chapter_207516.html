<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>This is an alternative before of Amanda regressing Candy to the point of no return.  This time, it will involve the husband entering to help unmake their daughter.  It is a unique way to regress and unborn and could lead to many possibilities soon after. </div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Candy is now a fetus of 8 months, 23 days, 12 hours, 2 minutes and 30 seconds.  Amanda feels bad as she rubs her belly.  She better say something to the door so she can have her alone time.  &quot;I want to regress more.  I want to see how my baby gets more younger.&quot; Said Amanda.<br />
<br />
The clock timer appears showing the age of the fetus.  It is currently 8 months, 23 days, 11 hours, 45 minutes and 12 seconds.  Now the clock timer is going down fast as Amanda&#39;s belly starts to feel her regression.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile inside Amanda&#39;s womb, Fetus Candy is sleeping soundly as she starts to shrink further and further.  She is still happy that she is in her mom&#39;s womb but it will be the last of her once she reaches her over limit.<br />
<br />
Candy is now 7 months, 14 days, 20 hours and 44 seconds inside the womb.  Amanda is having her mood swings as she enjoys her belly a lot.<br />
<br />
Candy is now 6 months, 22 days.  5 hours and 30 minutes inside the womb.  And Amanda is taking her good nap while she rubs her belly.  She is dreaming about her and Baby Candy jumping over a field of flowers.<br />
<br />
Candy is now 5 months, 10 days, 2 hours, 44 minutes and 19 seconds inside the womb.  Using her ultrasound device, She sees Fetus Candy who is now 5 months in pregnancy.  She waved hello.<br />
<br />
As time continued, the regression keeps on going.  Candy is down to 4 months...  Amanda was sitting at the kitchen table, eating peanut butter and cucumbers.  She even went from a maternity dress to a heavy sweater and sweat pants, trying to conceal her growing, or shrinking stomach.<br />
<br />
3 Months...  She was standing in front of a full-length mirror and wearing nothing but a black bra and panties set.  Turning to the side, she could see her stomach jutted out, making it difficult hide from everyone.<br />
<br />
2 Months...  She was wearing just an extra large Spring Break 2000 shirt and was holding a pregnancy test, showing two lines.  She was shocked, well; fake shocked, finding out that she was pregnant with the future Candy.<br />
<br />
1 Month….  Amanda was crouched near the toilet dressed in just her pajamas, puking her guts out and experiencing motion sickness.<br />
<br />
Half a month, she stood up, wearing a long black dress that goes down to her feet white gloves, and a black veil concealing her face.  She was feeling sad as if she lost someone close to her while holding a bouquet of purple flowers.<br />
<br />
She placed her hands on her stomach as she feels her bump getting smaller and smaller as weeks turned to days, then hours, then minutes, and finally seconds.  “Well…  Looks like it’s almost time for Candy to leave me.” Amanda said. She sighed that her daughter is going to cease to exist at this point.  When Candy reaches into an egg cell state, Amanda was immediately on a king size bed and she was completely naked.  Looking at it and feeling the silky blankets, she realized this bed and knew what it meant.  Just then, the door to the age room opened up and someone stepped into the room, who she saw shocked her completely.<br />
<br />
Coming in is a naked man at twenty-seven with a mop of brown hair with a small mustache and goatee combo, and light blue eyes.  His body was that of a medium body builder with broad shoulders, slightly bulging pec, six-pack abs, and bulging arms and legs with a body hair on his arms, legs, chest and treasure trail.  On his right arm, there is a military tattoo showing a rank and a dog tag around his neck.  But what got her attention the most is his dick that is at attention and was ten inches long.  Looking at this person, she knew who he was.<br />
<br />
“Tom!  Is that you?”<br />
<br />
Indeed, it is Tom, Amanda’s former husband.  She knew him since they were kids and they were both together for so long.  He was a military man that married a classic girl next door and had their honeymoon; it was on that night that the two made out hard and created Candy in the first place.  Of course, he left for his service and died in Afghanistan a few weeks before Amanda was pregnant.  Now here he is, alive, well, and looking horny.<br />
<br />
Tom though was in some sort of trance as he looked like the only thing he was thinking is making out with his wife.  Amanda blinked and wondered why he wasn’t listening.<br />
<br />
“Tom?  It’s me.  Amanda.  Can you hear me?”<br />
<br />
He was listening, instead he was slowly approaching the bed Amanda was on and looked ready for some lovemaking.  Amanda soon looked to the room and asked, “Hey!  What’s going on here?  Why is my husband here?  Why is he not listening?”<br />
<br />
The room heard her and told her, “You decided to regress your child to before she is born.  To do that, you need your significant other to make it work.  Otherwise, there will be a white puddle in the floor.  Its sort of a fail safe incase the customer or the mother made the choice to regress to nothing.”<br />
<br />
“Then why isn’t he listening to me?  It’s almost like he’s in some sort of trance or something.” She continued<br />
<br />
“Because he’s in a hypnotic and sexual state.  It helps ease the unconcieve better.  He will only snap out of it when the unconcievement is done.  Until then, sit back and enjoy Candy’s last moments of life in reverse.” The room’s voice finished.<br />
<br />
Tom was already approaching the bed and lay down next to her.  Slowly getting over her, he looked dazed, as he was ready to make some serious love to his wife.  Amanda watched on and was amazed that her own husband is back, only to unmake their daughter.  Though under all honesty, she knew that he died before she found out she’s pregnant with their daughter after his death and funeral.  So on hindsight, he never knew she was ever pregnant up to that day of death.  But that will soon change when it was getting close to the day Candy will be no more.<br />
<br />
Looking at Tom’s hypnotic eyes, she gave a warm smile and said, “Oh, Tom…  I so missed you…” <br />
<br />
The husband didn’t hear her as he was more focused on what matters the most.  Instant lovemaking.  He soon planted his lips with hers and the two were slowly going at it with each other, mushing each other’s faces in the process.  When they started to grope their bodies, Tom’s penis was brushing up Amada’s thigh and she was just as turned on even before the penetration.  Slowly Tom guided his dick to his wife’s pussy and slowly slides it inside.  He slowly started to gyrate as Amanda bit her lip with bliss.  The pushing and pulling was starting to got faster and faster with him getting harder and harder.  Amanda was feeling it, as her body movements were getting aggressive with her breasts jiggling up and down from the motions.  The two were panting and moaning as they were reaching the climax.  But what is really happening is that they will be experiencing a reverse climax with the only victim behind inside Amanda’s body.<br />
<br />
Inside Amanda’s room, Candy was nothing more then a fertilized egg that’s going into the final stages.  Candy knew something was off when she couldn’t hear, see, taste or use any of her senses.  But she can still feel it and knew that she was about to reach her limit.  Suddenly, she feels something sticking out and was trying to separate.  What is happening is that a tail popped out and it was pulling out of the egg, unfertilizing it in the process.  After a few quick seconds, Candy could feel herself getting separated in two as her sperm side slip with her egg side.  The two were swimming separately as the sperm part was gathering with more sperm that magically appeared and swam backwards through the body and into Tom’s shaft.  All the sperms return to one of the testitcles and swam around without a care in the world, leaving Candy’s sperm lost in the shuffle.  At the same time, Candy’s egg was swimming back through a tube and entered one of the ovaries joining with the many other eggs waiting for their turn, squeezing into the group.  Once both sides nestled into their proper place, Candy could feel the last of her consciousness going away.  She forgot everything about her life, including her name.  Now they are just an egg and sperm cell, waiting to penetrate each other, wanting to be female.<br />
<br />
At the same time, Tom and Amanda were banging each other harder and harder as their moans were getting louder and louder.  Both of them were dripping in sweat and were on the verge of climax.  But Amanda felt something and knew that it was time.<br />
<br />
“Oh shit!  This is it!  I can feel a part of Candy leaving me!  C’mon Tom!  Finish this!  Unmake our daughter!  Make us parentless!  Do it!”<br />
<br />
Tom didn’t hear any of that as he was still in that trance until it’s all over.  But he instinctively pumped harder.  In a matter of seconds, they both screamed in orgasm as they helped their former daughter reach her limit.  As they reached climax, Tom’s balls were being filled with all the sperm that had Candy’s while the egg went back to Amanda’s ovaries.  Both of them collapsed on the bed and immediately passed out, going into a deep sleep after working to unconceive their daughter.  Candy’s timer on the room’s wall all ticked zeros and erased itself on the board now that she no longer exists.  But Tom’s and Amanda’s name and age appeared on the board as they are now currently in the room their former daughter was in.<br />
<br />
The room watched the two sleeps peacefully, just so it doesn’t disturb them.  But it was shocked and amazed of what just happened.  What was a ten-year-old girl entering the room, was now a couple that just made out.  But for Candy, it was an amazing experience regressing all the way to before she was ever made and she had no regrets in doing so.  Now the room watched intently as it wondered what would happen to Tom and Amanda.</p>
