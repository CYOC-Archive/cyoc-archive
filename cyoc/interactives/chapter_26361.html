<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Weeks passed. One saturdayy Andrew sat in his playpen. He was just playing a bit with the toys. He got used to being a baby, 

but he was sure he could never accept it. First because he knew he didn't want to be a one year lld, and second because he 

remembered the old man's words: "...changing things when I want...". Andrew is a slave to the magician's magical powers, and 

there is nothing he can do about it. <br>&nbsp<br>
"Boys it is time for the soccer tournament", Mom called to upstairs.<br>
Then someone run down the stairs. <br>
"Easy on the stairs Mike."<br>
"Ojak i know mom. Did you get my stuff?"<br>
"Yes your clothes are in your bag. As well as your brothers clothes. The shoes are at the door. Don't forget to take Kurts 

clothes."<br>&nbsp<br>

Mike and Kurt are Andrew's brothers. Mike is seventeen and Kurt is fourteen. They never give much attention to him. As a baby 

he was not very interesting for them. Being a baby was actualy boring as hell. As a fourteen year old he would die to go and 

play soccer with them. But he is only fourteen in his mind. Babies don't play soccer matches. Little did he know that he 

might go to the match afterall. He would soon find out that being a baby isn't that bad at all.<br>&nbsp<br>

Kurt came rushing down the stairs. Halfway he tripped... felt.. and landed on the tip of his toe with his full weight. Kurt 

felt something break, grabbed hit foot and yelled. Mother shocked "Kurt, Kurt are you allright?" "No!", Kurt cried ,"I broke 

my foot"<br>&nbsp<br>
"I tell you guys so often. Easy on the stairs. But you never...".<br>&nbsp<br>

Andrew watched the whole scene, and then like time stopped still his mother and brothers froze. Everythis was standing still. 

Even the clock didn't tick anymore. But Andrwe could move. What is this? he thought, but than the magician appeared. Andrew 

started to grow. All his clothes dissapeared and the growth stopped when he was old enough to walk and speak. <br>&nbsp<br>

"I'm bored with you being a drooling baby."<br>
"Can I go home?"<br>
"Hehe... Go Home... No I have other plans for you"<br>
The magician walked to Kurt "This boy has a broken foot"<br>
"Yeah so what has that to do whi..." <br>
"You are going to replace it"<br>
"What? NOO! Please don't"<br>
The magician pointed his hand to the foot. It disappeared. Andrew was being pulled towards the boys footless leg. Andrew 

feared what was going to happen next "Noooooo!" He knew he could do nothing about it. <br>
Andrew was getting smaller and smaller until his butt touched the end of Kurts leg. His butt fused with the boys ankle, and 

Andrews legs dissappeared. Andres watched in horror when he felt hes boned reorganize to form foot boned. His feet reappeared 

on hes shoulder. Then his arms shrunk down till his hands where on hos shoulder as well. He looked like a haf human half foot 

 creature, but the changes went further. "You will be a complete foot when i leave. Ha ha. All for my amusement". Andrews 

skin was changing. His fels something in his groin area. He tried to reach out to his dick, but his hands couldnt reach 

anymore. He could only watch when his dick flattend out until only a thick skinned heel was left. That was when the smell 

started. In all the terror he forgot what was properbly the worst of being foot. The smell, or from now on his own smell. The 

changes moved further upwards until his neck down he was completely a foot. The his hands became toes. It was like something 

blow them up from inside. All his fingers disapeard. His left hand was even becoming bigger. He is a right foor. Next are his 

feet. Andrew is almost a complete foot now. Only his head is left. <br>&nbsp<br>

"Please stop. I can't.. Please i don't... I will do everything for you but.. Please.."<br>&nbsp<br>

"O course you will do everything. I can make you do everything. For now you will this boy's foot for as long as I want. Maybe 

I let you grow old with Kurt, or maybe I don't. Just know that you are completely in my control. Now just be a good size 

eight foot. Okay? See you. Haha"<br>&nbsp<br>

The magician disappeared, and the last part of the change stated. Andrew felt his face disappear and turn into toeskin. He 

lost his hear and he felt something hard pres through the back of his head. It was a nail that formed on the back of his 

head. He was now completely foot and he was no longer in control since he was Kurts foot and Kurt was frozen in time.<br>&nbsp<br>

Time restarted. <br>
"Auww..." Kurt stopped screaming. Kurt grabed his foot again. Nothing. No pain anymore. <br>
"....listen, What is it" his mom asks.<br>
"Nohing. It dosn't hurt anymore"<br>

Andrew felt sick. A whole new wave of senses overwhelmed him. His odour was terrible, but Kurt wiggling his toes and moving 

his feet is so strange. Andrew is no longer human. His is just a foot and there is nothing he can do about it. <br>&nbsp<br>

"Try to stand up" <br>
Kurt tries. He  even jumps.There is no pain. Nothing is wrong. <br>
"You are lucky young man... Now put your shoes on we go to the soccer fields.<br>&nbsp<br>

When Kurt was stading, Andrew felt the full weight on his body. It didn't hurt. His body was now flat on the floor. It was 

cold. Also Kurts jumpung didn't hurt. <br>&nbsp<br>

Kurt walkedto his Socks and shoes an sat down. Andrew saw a huge sock opeing come his way and entered. He felt the sock slid 

all arround his body. These aren't clean socks, Andrew smelled, but as a foot he could't complain but it was terrible! The 

foot rested on the floor while Kurt put on his other sock. Andrew couln't see much anymore because the sock blocked most of 

his view. But he could see something come his way. That must be his shoe. Kurt wore his Converse shoes most of the time. 

Andrew entered the shoe. He  felt the shoe fit perfectly around him. It was already thight, but than Kurt started to lace him 

up. He was firmly pressed into the insole of the shoe, and Kust wasn't even standing. Andrew was crieing inside. This is 

going to be how he is gonna spend most of his days. Inside a smelly size eight converse shoe as this guys foot.<br>&nbsp<br>

Today is gonna be the worst day to start being a foot. The boys got their soccer clothes and shoes packed and they are on 

their wat to the tournament.  <br>&nbsp<br></p>
