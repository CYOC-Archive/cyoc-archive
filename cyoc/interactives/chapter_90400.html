<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Once the lunch break was concluded, Danielle returned to work, but not before seeing that Amanda had left for the ladies room, and when she’d returned to her desk one of her nipples was exposed now, as was the entirety of her crotch, from the waist, down between her legs, and to her tail that flicked as she restarted her work.  <br />
<br />
Danielle typed away, compiling the statistics and numbers for the company finances, as well as the expected costs for Ross’s security scheme.  <br />
<br />
Speaking of, she spotted him as he patrolled the office on (bare)foot, his thick muscular chest on display as he paused next to Amanda who now had her lower right breast free.  <br />
<br />
A little over 90 minutes later, and she was almost finished with her day’s work when a knock was heard on her door, letting her in, Janet was there, down to her heels and stockings.  <br />
<br />
“Danielle, these contain the details of your assignment.”  She began, showing her a folder which Danielle took, as she glanced over the contents of it.  “It requires that you leave on Wednesday, and will return on Friday.”  <br />
<br />
“The Wednesday and Friday of this week?”  Danielle asked her.  <br />
<br />
“That is correct.”  Janet confirmed.  “I trust you can do it.”  <br />
<br />
“I can do it.”  <br />
<br />
“Good.  I expect to hear good things from them and you on Friday.”  Janet replied before leaving.  <br />
<br />
Returning to her desk, Danielle properly looked over the task she’d been given.  Travel on the Wednesday and Friday, with Thursday being when she did the work itself.  And being close enough that she could drive the distance, even if it was six hours travel time each way.  By her mental math, if she left here at about noon, she should make it by early evening, while a morning leave on the Friday would have her back here in time for the afternoon.  <br />
<br />
Ditching what was left of her sweater and trousers, she lifted her bare feet onto the desk as she read the entire checklist and task details, leaving nothing out.  Quite a bit to do, but nothing unmanageable for her.  Perhaps an easing in to her new responsibilities?  It would seem about right to her.  And she suspected the reason for the afternoon leaving was so to make certain she could attend the Wednesday Meeting where Ross’s security upgrades were the first item.  <br />
<br />
Since she was running ahead of schedule, she chose to look over the details of the company car that she’d been provided with.  A fairly basic sedan, but a good size and not too expensive to operate.  But it wouldn’t arrive until the next day, just in time for her to need it.  <br />
<br />
“Quite a step up.”  She mused to herself as she stood up to see what was happening outside her office, seeing Amanda with both of her large breasts out in the open, and Cassie already having ditched her clothes as well as she furiously typed away.  <br />
<br />
Satisfied, Danielle returned to her work, expecting to be done with time to spare.  <br />
<br />
[+]<br />
<br />
“How was your day?”  Ashlee asked as Danielle returned to their apartment.  <br />
<br />
“Good, it was a good day.”  Danielle replied cheerfully, her hells back on while a thick overcoat kept most of her body hidden.  <br />
<br />
“Nice to hear.  Did anything nice happen?”  She way she asked told Danielle that she was talking about her long-winded wish.  <br />
<br />
“Got a company car now, and I’ll be away from Wednesday to Friday for work related reasons.”  Danielle told her.  <br />
<br />
“Excuse me?”  <br />
<br />
“They’re having me head to another office to do a snap check on their finances.  I leave on the Wednesday, and return on the Friday.  Entirely related to the promotion.”  <br />
<br />
“Talk about a step up.”  Ashlee spoke quietly.  <br />
<br />
“Say?  What about your day?”  Danielle asked her to shift the topic.  <br />
<br />
“Me?  Well, they really loaded me down with work…”  Ashlee began before faltering.  <br />
<br />
“So you used the Pen to cut your workload.”  Danielle finished for her.  <br />
<br />
“Yes.”  She admitted, eyes downcast.  <br />
<br />
Danielle sighed slightly before coming in closer, opening one button on her coat and pulling it wider to reveal some of her hefty firm breasts.  “Shh.  It’s not easy to resist using it, I know.”  She consoled Ashlee with a firm yet gentle embrace.  “Besides, it was quite a small use, was it not?”  <br />
<br />
“Yeah, I suppose you’re right.”  Ashlee whispered as she rested her head on Danielle’s breasts.  “But it does make me think, was I too hard on you earlier?”  <br />
<br />
“Maybe.  Maybe not.”  Danielle replied softly.  “But let’s try not worry about that, too much.”  Working the next button loose, she now managed to get both her breasts out, the coat effectively propping them up and pulling them into each other.  <br />
<br />
[+]<br />
<br />
That night, they were resting next to each other, Danielle on her side which she found far more comfortable given her large thick tail, but sleep wasn’t coming easy for Ashlee who still worried about the Pen and how easy it was for her to use it for her own ends.  <br />
<br />
“Say dear?”  She began.  “I’ve been thinking.”  <br />
<br />
“Hmm, about what?”  <br />
<br />
“What do we do about it?  The Pen?”  <br />
<br />
“Well…”  Danielle began, having a good idea as to what Ashlee was getting at.  “Let’s do it like this.  You know everything I’ve done with it, correct?”  <br />
<br />
“Yes.”  <br />
<br />
“And you know what it’s capable of.”  <br />
<br />
“That I do.”  <br />
<br />
“Then here’s the deal.  Up to and including what I’ve done with it in terms of scale.”  She shifted a bit to get a proper look at Ashlee’s face.  <br />
<br />
“Sorry?”  <br />
<br />
“While you hold it, up to and including the things I’ve done with the Pen, I won’t mind you doing.”  She gazed deep into her eyes.  “And while we’re on the subject, since I’ll be needing to head out on the Wednesday, you can hold it for tomorrow the second of you in-office days.”  <br />
<br />
“While you’ve got it for the Wednesday to Friday.”  Ashlee worked out.  “I, I can live with that.”  She decided as she pulled herself closer to Danielle.  <br />
<br />
“It’s a deal then.”  Danielle spoke through a yawn.  “Night then.”  <br />
<br />
“Night.”  Ashlee murmured as sleep took her.</p>
