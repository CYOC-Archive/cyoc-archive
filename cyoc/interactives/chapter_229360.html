<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;I think I want you to try the medallion on.&quot; Marina said as she took off the medallion and placed it around his neck. As she did so, she felt a strange sensation, almost like a current of water passing through her body. She looked at Adrian, nervousness written all over her face. &quot;Here goes nothing,&quot; she muttered under her breath.<br />
<br />
Marina can feel her tail split apart into legs, her scales shift and change into smooth, soft skin, and her fins shrink and disappear. &quot;Seems like I&#39;m only a mermaid when I have the medallion on,&quot; she murmured to herself, looking down at her reacquired legs. As for Adrian, he could feel his body growing warmer, his legs began to tingle and felt like they were fusing together, and his feet flattened out into webbed fins. He stares in shock as he saw scales forming over his legs, slowly covering them until his entire legs were a shimmering, iridescent green. his toes also began to elongate and fuse together, forming a flipper-like appendage. as the transformation completed, his legs turned into a merman tail, his skin now smooth and scaled like that of a fish, his tail fluid and strong, capable of propelling him through the water with ease.<br />
<br />
&quot;W-wow,&quot; Adrian stammered, feeling a mixture of surprise, disbelief, and a strange sense of exhilaration course through him. He flexed his flippers experimentally, however it&#39;s mass was revealed to be much heavier than he expected, as it took some effort to control his newfound tail, only on water can he move it usefully.<br />
<br />
Marina, on the other hand, was still adjusting to her reacquired legs. She carefully took a step forward, she balanced on her two legs. She glanced over at Adrian, studying his merman form with curiosity.<br />
<br />
&quot;So,&quot; she said finally, her voice still sounding a little hoarse, &quot;how do you feel? Any new abilities or sensations?&quot;<br />
<br />
Adrian shrugged, still getting used to the feel of his flippers. &quot;Not really, no. I feel... different, but not in any special way. Maybe a little heavier, with this tail, but that&#39;s about it. You?&quot;<br />
<br />
Marina smiled, relieved to hear that Adrian wasn&#39;t experiencing anything out of the ordinary. &quot;Well, nothing much since i&#39;ve only been a mermaid for a few hours. But, I can tell you that swimming and moving in the water is a whole lot easier and faster with a tail than legs, though it&#39;s kind of useless when your on land since you can&#39;t exactly walk or stand up.&quot;<br />
<br />
Adrian looked at his merman tail with a mixture of fascination and surprise. He wonders how it would feel to swim around underwater, to move through the water with such ease and grace. His curiosity was piqued, and he found himself eager to try it out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, if you&#39;re sure you&#39;re okay with it, I&#39;d love to go for a swim,&quot; he said to Marina, nodding towards the ocean in the distance. &quot;I mean, it&#39;d be a shame not to test out this new... tail of mine.&quot;<br />
<br />
Marina smiled, nodding in agreement. &quot;Of course! I&#39;d be more than happy to show you around. I&#39;m still getting used to walking on two legs again, but I&#39;m sure I can manage.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Though.. can you help me get there? I mean I cant exactly walk on land with this tail...&quot; Adrian pointed at his new merman tail.<br />
<br />
Marina laughed, &quot;Of course! I&#39;d be happy to. Just let me take your hand and carry you while you hold unto me so I can take you to shore.&quot; She held out her hand to him. &quot;And after that, I&#39;ll show you how to move on water with your new tail. It&#39;s actually quite easy once you get the hang of it!&quot;<br />
<br />
Adrian nodded gratefully, Marina took Adrian&#39;s hand began to carry him towards the shore. He looked down at his merman tail, still taking in the strange sensation of having such a foreign appendage. As she walked and carried him, he felt the soft sand beneath his flippers, and the salty tang of the ocean air filled his lungs. &quot;This is all so surreal,&quot; he muttered, mostly to himself.<br />
<br />
Marina glanced back at him with a reassuring smile. &quot;It takes some getting used to, that&#39;s for sure. But once you&#39;re out in the water, it feels so natural.&quot; They continued their slow progress towards the shore, since Adrian was much heavier than he looked with his new merman tail. The sand under her feet was warm and gave way easily to their touch, revealing a hidden world of tiny creatures and crustaceans scurrying about their business.<br />
<br />
As they drew closer to the water&#39;s edge, Marina slowly let go of Adrian, allowing him to lower himself down gently onto the wet sand. He felt the coolness of the water envelop his flippers, Out of excitement, he forgot that he had a tail and tried to stand up and run into the ocean. It was only then that he realized his newfound lack of balance and struggled to keep himself upright. He then fell down into the shallow water, splashing and flailing his flippers..<br />
<br />
Marina burst into laughter, amused by Adrian&#39;s clumsy attempts to adjust to his new tail. &quot;Take it slow, my friend,&quot; she said between giggles. &quot;Remember that you have a tail for now instead of legs.&quot;<br />
<br />
Adrian felt a mixture of embarrassment and annoyance as he struggled in the shallow water. He glanced up at Marina, he looked embarrassed. &quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; he muttered, &quot;I&#39;m just not used to this tail yet, or being a merman in general.&quot;<br />
<br />
Marina encourage him with a gentle smile, &quot;It&#39;s alright, take your time. Let me guide you how to move on water with your new tail. It&#39;s actually quite easy once you get the hang of it, though the water here is shallow so we have to go deeper, here let me help you.&quot; Marina took Adrian&#39;s hand and lead him into deeper water. &quot;Okay, now that we are deeper, let&#39;s try this. You have to think about how you want to move, and your tail will follow your thoughts. For example, if you want to swim forward, imagine yourself swimming forward, and your tail will propel you forward, like how dolphins do it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Adrian nodded, taking a deep breath and letting the cool water flow over his body. He closed his eyes, focusing on the sensation of his tail fin moving through the water. He pictured himself swimming gracefully, mimicking the movements of a merman he&#39;d seen in a movie once. To his surprise, his tail responded perfectly, propelling him through the water with surprising ease. He opened his eyes and looked at Marina, a newfound excitement coursing through him.<br />
<br />
&quot;W-wow,&quot; Adrian breathed, still getting the hang of his new tail. &quot;That&#39;s incredible.&quot; He took a few more strokes, marveling at the feeling of weightlessness and power in the water. Marina smiled proudly, watching as he began to gain confidence.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Adrian, if you want to go deeper and explore the ocean then go for it, though I can&#39;t exactly go there since I don&#39;t have an extra medallion to become a mermaid.&quot; Marina chuckled softly, watching as Adrian seemed to get more and more comfortable with his new tail. As he swam deeper into the water, the schools of colorful fish darted around him, their scales reflecting the sunlight like stained glass. The ocean floor was a kaleidoscope of colors, with coral reefs and underwater caves beckoning to be explored.<br />
<br />
After exploring, Adrian came back to the shallow waters and dragged himself to shore, feeling a mix of exhilaration and exhaustion. He sat down on the sand, panting heavily as he looked back at Marina with a wide grin. &quot;That was amazing!&quot; he exclaimed, still trying to catch his breath. &quot;I can&#39;t believe how good it felt to be a merman!&quot;<br />
<br />
Marina smiled warmly at his excitement. &quot;I&#39;m glad you enjoyed it, Adrian. It truly is an incredible experience, isn&#39;t it?&quot; A they sat down and chatted, they noticed that it&#39;s getting late.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think it&#39;s getting late, let&#39;s head back to your house,&quot; Marina suggested, standing up and brushing the sand off her legs. &quot;You can try out your new tail some more tomorrow, if you want. Maybe you can find a deeper part of the ocean to explore.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, can you carry me back to my house?&quot; Adrian asked, still adjusting to his new tail. &quot;I cant walk with this.&quot; Marina smiled and picked him up, holding him bridal style. As she carried him back to shore, she noticed that Adrian seemed to be enjoying the sensation of being close to her. She could feel the warmth of his body through her bathing suit, and the scent of his skin filled her nose. It was a pleasant feeling, knowing that she had helped him experience something so incredible.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know Adrian, you can always take the medallion off whenever you want to become human again,&quot; Marina said softly, her voice laced with concern. &quot;It&#39;s entirely up to you.&quot; She felt the warmth radiating from his body and found it strangely comforting. As they come back to his house, she lowered him to the couch. &quot;You can rest here if you want, I&#39;ll make us some dinner.&quot;<br />
<br />
Adrian nodded, still adjusting to the sensation of having a tail instead of legs. He watched as Marina moved around the kitchen, humming softly to herself. The scent of herbs and spices filled the air, making his stomach rumble. He couldn&#39;t help but feel a strange sense of contentment and peace wash over him. It was as if he had found a newfound connection with the world around him, one that he had never experienced before.<br />
<br />
He now want&#39;s to come near here while she is cooking, so he took the medallion off and began to wait for his tail to slowly turn back into legs.</p>
