<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The pressure behind Jess&#39;s eye was beginning to make her head throb again. For weeks now she&#39;s been staring at the tomes liberated from behind the false wall in the living room; sheafs of paper, notes, scribbles, and drawings all scattered the table around her. <br />
<br />
Rubbing her temples she looked up and around the room blinking, eyes needing to focus on something, anything other than the damned book.<br />
<br />
The cottage bedsit stuck to the barn was cozy, log walls draped with tapestries; hardwood floor covered in rugs; stove in the corner keeping the room toasty warm; and a huge log bed, with heavy blankets where Henry normally satt, cross-legged, tome in hand and scribbling on a piece of paper; now vacant.<br />
<br />
She smiled wistfully to herself. Two weeks they had been happily living together in the cottage, no longer hiding from her mother. Joan, since then, had been a non-entity, Jess hadn&#39;t even seen her in over a week, and that relieved her. Instead she spent her days reading and trying to decipher the books with her father; and the nights... The nights they spent cuddled together, doing their level best to not to succumb to the Cabin&#39;s curse. It was tough, and often, on waking with her father&#39;s cock squashed squarely between her ass cheeks, it was all she could do to drag herself out into the cold, fill a pail with ice-cold water, and throw it over herself. From these early morning trials, Jess knew what her next change would be. Every time she found herself in that position, her pussy would begin to tingle, and she would feel it getting puffy. No doubt her meaty, messy pussy was changing to that of a cow. So far she hadn&#39;t brought herself to look at it, or tell her father that it was the next change. Not wanting to freak him out. She was grateful enought that he liked her current human one, considering how heavy and meaty her labia were. The last thing she wanted to do was scare him off with animal talk. Even if...<br />
<br />
She shifted uncomfortably, lack of sex had made her horny again as the days had dragged by. She knew, deep down that, unless they figured out these books soon, she&#39;d be sporting a brand new vagina.<br />
<br />
Sighing, Jess looked back at her notes. They had made some headway, just not enough. Clusters of symbols seemed to make up syllables, and they had figured out which ones stood for &#39;and&#39; and &#39;the&#39;. Given their frequency, that had allowed Jess to start teasing out other symbols and syllables, but so far that had only added a smattering of words that didn&#39;t add enough context or information. It was slow, tedious work, all the cross-referencing. Jess&#39;s mind drifted to her father again. His handsome face, curly hair, tanned skin. She&#39;d much rather be... She shook her head, shifting again. Sighing and going back to her notes.<br />
<br />
Both had made the agreement early on, that they wouldn&#39;t initiate a tryst, unless they genuinely made progress in leaving the Cabin. Jess and Henry both knew that was risky, and could end up with them losing control at an inopportune time, even possibly with someone or something else. Both Jess and Henry, having been subject to the Cabin&#39;s waves of lust, knew that such a thing was probably inevitable. Still, neither had really discussed it.<br />
<br />
Considering Jess had stolen Henry, her own father, from her mother, by seducing and forcing her to cheat on him, she couldn&#39;t really balk too strongly at the thought.<br />
<br />
*Knock-knock*<br />
<br />
A thump at the external door brought her from her thoughts. Jess stood, glad to be standing. She took a moment righting her dress over her enormous cleavage.<br />
<br />
&quot;Coming&quot; She called as Jess slowly waddled over.<br />
<br />
Jess smiled too herself, she knew that she was changing, even without the Cabin&#39;s changes. For three weeks now, Jess&#39;s ravenous hunger had her eating bucketloads of greens every day. She was beginning to fill out. No longer all knees and elbows, gangly arms and flat ass, boney hips and pointy shoulders. She wasn&#39;t chubby, but she had definitely begun smoothing out the harsh edges. Her ass was a bit more shapely, her hips smooth and inhumanly wide, giving her an hourglass waist. Her arms were soft now, and her thighs thickening; and this morning, for the first time in her life, she felt a proper fold in her stomach as she sat down.<br />
<br />
Seeing how Henry&#39;s eyes ravaged and rolled all over her more and more lately made her happy. Jess was beginning to feel like a woman, not like some gawky teen.<br />
<br />
*Crreeeaaak*.<br />
<br />
The heavy door creaked as Jess unlatched and swung it open to reveal her father, her lover. Just the sight of his curly hair, dusky skin and strong arms made her instantly chest flutter. Blood began pumping as her nipples and teats stiffened. She bit her lip, hard. She&#39;d need a cold bath again before bed tonight.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi Daddy!&quot; she beamed, leaning in and up, eyes fluttering closed and mouth parted, finding his. Lips locked she moaned, happily and leaned in more. Titanic breasts squashed between them. The kiss lingered, but it was Henry who pulled away first. His hands on her shoulders.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jess... I...&quot; He paused. She smiled. &quot;Yes?&quot; She winked at him, seductively. &quot;Jess... I&#39;m sorry&quot;.<br />
<br />
Her face fell and stomach fell like a stone, she knew what that tone, that voice, that apology meant. Stepping back she saw his change, feet, now hooves, just like James, just like Joan.<br />
<br />
&quot;Who?&quot; She breathed, wishing, hoping, &quot;Mom?&quot;. Henry shook his head vehemently, the knot in Jess&#39;s stomach loosening somewhat. Not her mother. Not Joan again trying to interfere with them.<br />
<br />
Her tone more even and controlled she asked, &quot;Who then? Melissa or James?&quot;, Henry&#39;s mouth formed a line. &quot;James&quot; he said flatly, then added. &quot;I think he thinks himself a girl now. He&#39;s changed.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jess stood back slowly backing into the cottage. Her mind was racing. She knew this was a possibility. By waiting this long between Henry and herself, forcing themselves to total abstinence, but living with their object of desire, they were setting themselves up to be taken advantage of. She made it to the bed, sitting and placing her hands beside her. She stared at the ground for a long moment, as Henry entered the cottage, shut the door behind him, and hovered by the door, unsure.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ve all changed.&quot; She finally said, weakly smiling and patting the bed beside her. Carefully and on uncertain feet, Henry clopped across the room and plopped beside his daughter. <br />
<br />
&quot;Jess?&quot; He asked. She leaned over and placed her head on his shoulder. &quot;It&#39;s okay Dad. It was bound to happen eventually. Us holding off on sex for this long was bound to lead to this eventually. I don&#39;t blame you...&quot;<br />
<br />
Henry felt a huge rock of guilt lift from him as he wrapped his arm around Jess&#39;s soft smooth shoulders. She turned, eyes large looking up at him. &quot;New agreement then Dad!&quot; She started, his eyebrows raised inquisitively. &quot;We&#39;ll do our best not to, but if one of us absolutly, positively, must release, then we do it together. Even if there&#39;s someone else. We call and we shout, and the other one comes running.&quot; She raised her hand to his face, rubbing the stubble on his cheek. &quot;I don&#39;t want to miss anything from now on.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jess&#39;s eyes were pleading, and Henry felt a swell of joy and pride. &quot;Anything for you, my love.&quot; He said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Cool...&quot; Jess exhaled. &quot;Because I really, reaaallly, need it right now...&quot;. She went to lean in, then pulled back again, eyes wide in fright hand covering her mouth. How could she forget. A Bovine vagina was next! How would she live that down.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh honey.&quot; Henry started. His own hand taking hers and pulling it from her face, then stroking her rosy cheeks. He wanted to make her feel better. Allay some of her fears.<br />
&quot;I know you&#39;re always worried about growing a muzzle, and me not liking you, well, I think you&#39;re crazy. If you grow one. I&#39;ll still love you, and kiss you.&quot; He leaned in, pecking her lips. &quot;Like this.&quot; He grinned and she giggled sheepishly. He imagined her at that moment, a feminine muzzle, pink nose and wide lips, smiling. The thought didn&#39;t scare him. It didn&#39;t scare him at all. &quot;And if I grow one I&#39;ll kiss you like this.&quot; He pecked her again. She giggled again. <br />
<br />
Jess with a muzzle... He imagined it again. &#39;I mean, it would have happened eventually anyway. Kinda cute I think.&#39;<br />
<br />
&quot;Jess...&quot; He looked at her, she making eye contact. &quot;Is it a muzzle next? Is that why you don&#39;t want to? I honestly wouldn&#39;t mind.&quot;.<br />
<br />
She looked in surprise, she picked up his tone. He sounded almost enthusiastic about it. &quot;You&#39;d like me having a muzzle?&quot;. She asked, incredulous.<br />
<br />
Henry took a moment looking all over Jess. Her face wasn&#39;t very cow-like, apart from the adorable ears twitching and poking out the side of her auburn locks. But her body. Her body was all curves now, all tits, teat and udder flesh. It wade him so horny, all of the time, just thinking about how delicious she looked. Even that tail, swishing about under the dress. It looked very bovine, but if it was more bovine... If she had horns, hooves, muzzle. His previous thought surfaced again. A future where they were both hermaphrodite cattle.<br />
<br />
His cock began to stiffen. Jess was right. They&#39;d all changed. Part of him wanted his little girl, his baby, to be bigger, softer, more fuckable. To be more cow like. <br />
<br />
How could he admit that though. How could he even begin to verbali...<br />
<br />
&quot;I would.&quot;<br />
<br />
The words were out. <br />
<br />
Jess&#39;s eyes bulged, she could see her father&#39;s erection now, tenting. Tenting impossibly big. He must be changing down there. She loved him. She loved him so much. And he, he loved her. Thought her sexy, all because of her new body. She&#39;d never once felt sexy before coming to the Cabin. If this is what her Daddy wanted... Then tonight...<br />
<br />
Henry couldn&#39;t believe his eyes as slowly, painfully, Jess reached behind her, unclasping her dress. In a *whoof* of fabric it fell revelaing her heavy breasts, sagging udder, and rock hard massive teats. The inside of her thic thighs were glistening below the udder.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s not a muzzle Daddy, but you might like it all the same...&quot; She quavered, then lay back on the bed, breasts heavily spreading out to the side, and udder down between her legs. Her hands then scooted under the udder and scooped the heavy pink flesh revealing her glistening cleft. Henry snorted, cock jumping. Her labia looked all wierd, different from her normal meaty lips, instead they looked fat and swollen.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think I&#39;m getting a cow&#39;s vagina daddy.&quot; She said, she wanted to make him happy. <br />
<br />
Henry grinned, happy, and horny. &quot;I think you are my little fuck cow.&quot; <br />
<br />
Jess giggled in her arousal. That phrase was coming back. She kind of wanted to feel like a fuck cow again. She felt dirty and kinky as she asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Want to make me &#39;moo&#39;? Stud?&quot;<br />
<br />
That was the final straw, Henry tore his pants down, reavealing a tapered cock, poking from a sheath, large enough to match his already oversized testicles. It looked perfect.<br />
<br />
<br />
Jess barely had time to register as Henry crossed the room and pulled Jess to the edge of the bed, grabbed her ankles, angled her legs up over his shoulder almost folding her back over herself. Jess gasped with the ease that he did it in, and watched as her udder, again under the embrace of gravity, joined her two breasts in falling back to her face.<br />
<br />
So all-encompasing was the view of all her own tit/udder-flesh, that she could only feel Henry&#39;s tapered cock poking around her enterance. <br />
<br />
For Henry, all he could see was thick thighs, full ass-cheeks clefted by auburn fur, a rosy butthole between them, the underside of an udder, and a sweet swelling growing pussy.<br />
<br />
With his tapered cock he began rubbing around, running it over her swollen vagina. Watching her slimy grool coat his cock, easing the friction. Each rub pushing the fat puffy flesh around, brought more and more moans from his little fuck cow. It looked almost done now. swollen lips with a long pink cleft, a promise of treasures untold; her clit now completely covered by a pointed fat hood that stood out from her crotch. He watched in delight as long hairs, long bristly hairs grew from the point of her hood, all for catching her scent when she was in heat. A cow&#39;s vagina, on his little girl. Perfect.<br />
<br />
<br />
Beneath the fleshbag of tit-flesh, tears of ecstasy were flowing freely from Jess&#39;s eyes. With every rub her pussy throbbed, adn she could feel her vagina lengthening, growing deeper, getting ready. It was destiny, she thought, that both of their genitals changed at the same time. And for once, she thanked the Cabin that everything had turned out this way. <br />
<br />
By the time the poking prodding teasing tip finally penetrated her, she could feel how different everything was, the thin tip entering, pressure building as the shaft pressed more and more against her walls with each inch. By the time Henry had hilted, she almost felt as if his cock must be at her throat, so deep was he.<br />
<br />
Nothing in the world, nothing so far, felt as good as this felt. Sweat pouring from her Jess tried to let Henry know her pleasure, but it only came out in a garbled cry. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hnnnnnggghh-mmmm. F-mmmm&quot;.<br />
<br />
Henry then began to thrust. The bag of tits, ass, and pussy, jiggled, twitched and squelched underneath his power. Each thrust sending his manhandled daughter into another ragged cry. The dank, musky smell of sex began to suffuse the air around him, rising in heat from Jess. Only the smell was nothing like sex up till now, not even Jess&#39;s scent. This was earthier, more base, stronger, sooo much better.<br />
<br />
The stink of bovine pussy drove Henry on again, he was so glad Jess was having this change, he was going to worship his little girl and her amazing body. Put this amazing creature on a pedestal and pray to it.<br />
<br />
Snorting in exertion Henry heard his daughter, still muffled by the mountain of flesh between them begin the startling cry of her mind-blowing orgasm.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh-OH-OH-OOOHHH Hmmnnn. HMMMNNN. n-no. HMmmm-o...&quot;<br />
<br />
The sound drove Henry to the edge as he thrust as hard as he could burying himself to the hilt just as Jess let out her last, and loudest cry.<br />
<br />
&quot;HMMMMOOOOOOOO!!! HMMM... MMMOOOOOO!&quot;<br />
<br />
The call of his little fuck cow was the last straw. A vertiable hose of heavy, thick, semen churned from his balls, all the way down his shaft and straight into his lowing daughter&#39;s bovine cunt.<br />
<br />
He kept spasming and making little thrusts, each releasing more cum in smaller and smaller quantities, as Jess continued to pant and twitch.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mmm.. Mmooo. Moo... Oh... god! Moooo! Oh god Dad. Oh god. That.  Oh-hmmm. Mmooo&quot;<br />
<br />
Dripping sweat and sexual juices, Henry finally, eventually pulled from Jess, and landed heavily on the bed beside her, panting. As soon as he slipped out from under her legs they fell, slinging over the bed and returning JEss to a lying position, udder and tits splayed, and legs hanging over the edge of the bed. She instantly felt a river of hot cum leak from her and run down her hairy ass cleft, matting the fur and wetting the bed.<br />
<br />
&quot;OH... MY... God...&quot; She panted. Heart hammering and face red, but beaming. She turned to her farther who was also breathless and staring at her, eyes wide, taking her in. She leaned in and kissed him. <br />
<br />
&quot;That was amazing.&quot; She said. He nodded. &quot;You said you needed it!&quot; He added.<br />
<br />
She smiled. &quot;I sure did.&quot; Turning on her back and smiling up, patting her belly. &quot;Well satisfied, thank you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Silence descended as both lay there. Neither wanted to say it out loud in the afterglow, but both wondered whether they should bring up their increased bovine behaviour during that mating. Henry wrestling with himself on how he found Jess&#39;s bovine traits more and more alluring with every fuck. And Jess about how sexy and good her new curves and body made her feel.<br />
<br />
Both thought to bring it up, but neither managed before exhaustion and sleep overtook them.</p>
