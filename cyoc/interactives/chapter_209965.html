<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jacob woke up at midnight, he needed to pee. As a 7 years old boy, he used to pee himself while sleeping, so he fortunately managed to go to the bathroom before it happens. He didn&#39;t like that when he was younger and that made him wonder why he agreed to become that young.<br />
<br />
When he returned to the living room, he noticed that Tim was peacefully sleeping inside his sleeping bag like a cute caterpillar. Despite they&#39;re both high school freshmen, Tim&#39;s good looking had helped him to become quite popular at school, especially with older girls who are definitely eager to know how much better looking he will get after a few years.<br />
<br />
After hearing a lot of mumbling about that, Jacob ended up wondering that too. But right now, that seemed too far from present, especially while Tim was a little kid no taller than 4 feet. He even had an arm behind his head, so Jacob can see his armpit and notice that puberty was practically non existent on him at the moment.<br />
<br />
Jacob remembered that Tim used to sleep like a log, so he won&#39;t be awake until the first sun rays crossed through the windows. That gave him an idea. Maybe Tim preferred to be a little kid for the weekend but Jacob could change him briefly into a grown up just to know how his friend will look in a few years.<br />
<br />
He will turn Tim back to his pre pubescent age before he wakes up and he will never know about it. It was brilliant, so he immediately went to his bedroom where his computer was still running the Sims-like game. It didn&#39;t take him long to find Tim&#39;s avatar sleeping in the living room and he picked him to see his info. It wasn&#39;t as detailed as a Chronivac but he can still change his age, which is what he really wanted to do.<br />
<br />
Jacob didn&#39;t care to hit the &quot;aware&quot; toggle because he would change his friend while he was still sleeping. He picked the current age, 7 years old, and then he changed it to 15, a year older than their real ages. But before he hit to apply the changes, he wondered if that could be a good age to really notice a change on his friend.<br />
<br />
Doubting about that, he start to scroll the age to 16, then 17, 18 and on, until he stopped on 28, two times his original age. Cause he had spent so much time wondering about this, he didn&#39;t think twice and hit enter to apply the changes. Tim&#39;s avatar who was still inside his sleeping bag didn&#39;t changed too much, he just looked bigger and that&#39;s all.<br />
<br />
The characters on the game weren&#39;t very detailed after all. So Jacob had to go back to the living room to notice how much his friend has changed. He remembered he didn&#39;t change the &quot;aware&quot; toggle, so he wondered if that could affect reality like it did with his parents who were definitely not aware of any change Jacob had done until now.<br />
<br />
Jacob was a few step from reaching the living room when he realized that Tim was snoring, something that he had never done before. Even, his snores sounded deep like the ones produced by an adult and not by a kid. Jacob was getting excited, but when he came in something took him completely by surprise.<br />
<br />
A strong pungent smell, a manly musk had filled the air in the room and it was coming from the exposed bush of armpit hair that a grown up Tim was now displaying. It was fascinating how a few minutes ago there was nothing there, but now there&#39;s so much hair that Jacob can&#39;t see the skin under it.<br />
<br />
Leaving that aside, if it wasn&#39;t because he made it, Jacob couldn&#39;t believe the handsome man sleeping in the middle of his living room was his best friend. He looked gorgeous like a supermodel or a Hollywood star. He was bigger on everywhere, his muscles, his size, his facial features. He obviously didn&#39;t fit in a children&#39;s sleeping bag, so now he was exposed from waist up. He must be above 6 feet tall now.<br />
<br />
His frame was also way more bigger and the clothes that Jacob lent him was now tattered around his wide torso. Jacob didn&#39;t care too much about it because he can see how his friends muscles had developed through years. It was like he&#39;s going to be a gym rat in his future, because there&#39;s no possible way he could get so big naturally.<br />
<br />
His arms, especially the one he kept behind his head were more thick than Jacobs current leg. His chest had two hefty and plumply pecs that pushed his nipples downside. Jacob could have mistake them for boobs if it weren&#39;t for the hair that had grown on them. Tim wasn&#39;t very hairy, but it definitely was a lot if you compared when he had nothing.<br />
<br />
He also had abs but they didn&#39;t seem as notorious as his biceps and pecs. Jacob can notice some constriction in the sleeping bag and he wondered if Tim legs were also as thick as his arms. He would have to keep wondering because he won&#39;t try to pull him out, it was too risky.<br />
<br />
However, he smiled a little when he noticed a big lump at the bottom which Jacob assumed were Tim&#39;s feet. Judging by his new size, Jacob won&#39;t be surprised if Tim also have big feet like size 12 or so. And some people say that when you have big feet, you also have a big... Jacob blushed in shame. He won&#39;t see his friend&#39;s junk. That&#39;s conveniently right below the sleeping bag border, so Jacob can only see some pubes protruding from above, but he can&#39;t avoid glancing briefly at the notorious bulge in there.<br />
<br />
As a teen just starting puberty, he can&#39;t deny he had thought about grownup&#39;s dicks sometimes, wondering if he will be big enough and what was &quot;big enough&quot; in first place. Was Tim big enough right now? He didn&#39;t know, so he decided to look aside. He still need to check his friend&#39;s face on detail.<br />
<br />
He close his face to Tim&#39;s face who was now occasionally snoring unlike a few minutes ago. Like his armpit, chest and crotch, he also had grown some hair on his jaw, he didn&#39;t have a beard but it&#39;s not like he can&#39;t grow it. It&#39;s just that he had some stubble like he hadn&#39;t shaved for a few days. Jacob smiled at the idea of shaving, because of those tv commercials were people seemed they&#39;re enjoying it. How naive.<br />
<br />
Tim&#39;s nose was bigger, he had thicker eyebrows and despite his haircut looked the same, the new size of his head made it look more stylish and mature. When he was looking at Tim&#39;s neck, Jacob got momentarily mesmerized by his prominent Adam&#39;s apple which was bobbling up and down witch each snore that Tim made. Jacob was also surprised of how thick Tim&#39;s neck had become. It definitely goes well with his bigger body.<br />
<br />
Jacob was so lost in his own thoughts that he didn&#39;t realize that Tim had stopped snoring. And with their faces so close to each other, when Tim opened his eyes for an instant, he immediately got shocked and jump up in surprise. But because his legs were wrapped inside his sleeping bag, he can&#39;t stand up and fell down making a loud thud.<br />
<br />
Without enough time to think properly, he quickly discarded the sleeping bag from his legs. Not noticing how big or hairy they are now. Jacob was also too shocked that he didn&#39;t move and just watched in awe his adult friend standing up and showing off in front of his eyes his naked lower half.<br />
<br />
When he thought that Tim could be a size 12, he was so wrong because Tim&#39;s feet were huuuge, at least a size 16. What he was not wrong about was about the size of his dick. He didn&#39;t know if it&#39;s just a coincidence, but Tim&#39;s cock was as large as his feet,and he even was soft! Well, semi soft...<br />
<br />
When Jacob&#39;s balls dropped, his scrotum was very tight, so his testicles weren&#39;t too separated from his crotch. And a lot of biology books&#39; pictures showed them that way. So, when he noticed that Tim&#39;s balls weren&#39;t just way more bigger, like chicken eggs, but they&#39;re also hanging low in a very loose scrotum like a bull, he definitely can&#39;t take his eyes off them. Their weight and looseness made them very bouncy which enforced that Jacob was mesmerized by them.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Tim was in utterly shock, he didn&#39;t know what was happening, why was Jacob looking at him like that, why he had his face so close to him or why everything seemed so small. He only knew that he was peacefully sleeping as a 7 years old boy inside a sleeping bag in his best friend&#39;s living room when he started to feel cold.<br />
<br />
In fact, he still felt cold, like he was wearing nothing... He touched himself to realize that in fact he was wearing nothing. He didn&#39;t understand why, so when he looked down, he got the biggest surprise in his life. Jacob knew that he must do something before Tim started to scream and wakes up his parents.</p>
