<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">To be honest... Nate was ready and willing to initiate the change then and there.<br />
<br />
But then he thought... Owen did have a point. &#39;Having two satyr brothers, and one unrelated satyr is awkward in any way you look at it.&#39; This feels unnatural to be meeting each other if it isn&#39;t about having a common interest. This needs to change! So Nate started tapping more on his Chronivac screen.<br />
<br />
Nate went ahead and added some Mental Shifts, and Perception Filters. So that way both Allen, and Marcus are also sports fans in their own right. And while it&#39;s happening only Nate, and Allen are aware.<br />
<br />
This may seem counterintuitive, but Nate wanted Allen to know what he&#39;s planning... It&#39;s only fair that he knows. So he asked him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Allen, may I talk to you alone?&quot; Marcus remarks that Nate may have something that would involve him, but Nate stated that he just wanted to ask him for a confirmation that’s all. Though unconvinced, Marcus chose to drop his suspicion, and let Allen go with him to hear his question.<br />
<br />
Nate showed him what he wanted to add. They&#39;re minor, but it&#39;s still worth telling him. &quot;So what do you think?&quot; Nate asked his newly made satyr friend. &quot;Does it go against want you wanted?&quot; Allen thought for a moment. He didn&#39;t seem to like the idea, but remembering what Nates device had said earlier. He can&#39;t say he doesn&#39;t understand where Nate is coming from.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just go ahead, and do it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Bah?&quot; Nate was confused. &quot;Are you sure Allen? You&#39;re find with it?&quot; He ask to make sure. And Allen affirms. &quot;Yeah Nate! Bah, I trust you that you can make this night feel right!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Baah!&quot; Nate bleats happily. &quot;Okay! I&#39;ll start the change!&quot; Nate went back to work on his device. And Allen walks back to where Marcus is at: watching the football game on TV. Allen smiles to myself thinking. &#39;All three of us are going to be Sports Bros! This is going to be a night worth remembering!&#39;<br />
<br />
But as Nate was about to hit confirm, Owens message comes up. &quot;Sir, I still have the suggested parameters available. Would you like for me to add that as well?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A suggestion? Bah!&quot; This thing waits until now to tell him? Nate already got the go ahead from Allen, and now this? Owen doesn&#39;t make this simple for him does he? &quot;... I don&#39;t know... What does it involve?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It only adds a few Reality Alterations, and among other things...&quot; &quot;&#39;Among other things&#39;? What do you mean by that?&quot; Nate is worried now. Owen continues &quot;But don&#39;t you worry... It&#39;s setup so only you, Marcus, and Allen are aware of these changes. If you don&#39;t like it you can always change back after midnight. So what do you say? Would you like to proceed with them?&quot;<br />
<br />
Nate is put in this position now! Should he even go ahead and do it? Allen already said that he trust him. But he doesn&#39;t even know what Owen want to add to the mix. Nate kept hesitating until Marcus shouted. &quot;Nate, what&#39;s taking you? The commercials are almost over!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m coming guys!&quot; Nate can&#39;t keep waiting forever so he begrudgingly accepts Owens suggestion, and went to join with his soon to be &#39;Sports Fans&#39; as he gave himself a defeated &#39;Bah&#39;, and mutter to himself &quot;Good Pan! I hope I didn&#39;t make a mistake.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
---------------<br />
<br />
&quot;Bah! What took you so long Nate? You almost missed the game.&quot; Marcus asked. Nate was blushing, wishing that he prepared some form of explaination.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well.. I uh...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Bah! It&#39;s starting!&quot; Allen says excitedly. &quot;Oh, this is going to fun!&quot; Marcus remarked.<br />
<br />
Allen is still a satyr who is now related to Marcus, But instead of being identical twins, they&#39;re twins with their own unique facial features. Allen for the most part, does look like his human self, but with a few modifications. Besides his satyr features...<br />
<br />
For instance, Allen still has his same eye color, hair color, and his hair is also now uncurled. In terms of what Allen got from Marcus&#39;s family, well, he shares Marcus&#39;s sharp nose, and chin. <br />
<br />
Other adjustments include, his skin being lighter than Marcus&#39;s, Allen also still has his satyr-like beard albeit not as thick as his brother’s, and unlike Marcus who has such a proud wine belly, Allen though he dose have a belly, he&#39;s not as fat as his brother. In a way, Marcus loves his wine, so much so his wears he&#39;s belly with pride.<br />
<br />
But then, something strange occurs... Sports clothes started appearing on him like magic. With a Blue and white oversized jersey, and black sweatpants with elastic ankles. Nate knew he made him a sports fan, but this is too much.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bah! Hey bro?&quot; Marcus is wondering about the clothes. &quot;Have you decided against the no clothes deal?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Bah?&quot; Allen looks at himself. He didn&#39;t how they got there! Or why? &quot;But I didn&#39;t...&quot; As he looks up, something bizarre happens. Clothes starts appearing on Nate, and Marcus&#39;s bodies, and they don&#39;t even know it yet!<br />
<br />
Nate wears a navy blue beanie with holes for horns, a white football T-shirt with the respective ball team logo, and sweat shorts.<br />
<br />
And Marcus is wearing a white loose fitting jersey that did little to hide his belly fat, and he wore white sweatpants with elastic ankles.<br />
<br />
Allen wasn&#39;t sure how to repond to this. &quot;Bah, guys?... I&#39;m not the only one with clothes on!&quot;<br />
<br />
As Allen pointed at them Marcus scoffs. &quot;Bah! Nonsense! I would never be caught dead wearing a stupid jersey like tha-&quot; But as he looked at himself, he is in fact wearing a jersey! &quot;Bah! Great Pan! That is impossible!&quot; And so he tries to take off his jersey with no avail.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile Nate is baffled by this change, &#39;This is not what I wanted! Why did this happen?!&#39; What&#39;s even more bizarre is that the normal itch, the one that tells you that you shouldn&#39;t wear clothes. Well, it&#39;s gone, and in its place is the need to keep up appearance. But why?!<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, Great Pan! Why didn&#39;t I check the settings before hitting enter?&quot; Nate said that out loud to his chagrin they heard that.<br />
<br />
Allen was wide eyed, and Marcus is glaring at Nate. &quot;Bah! What do you mean by that?&quot; Marcus asked with suspicion.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bah! I didn&#39;t say anything, What are you talking about?!&quot; Nate is trying to save face, though it&#39;s less effective.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nate... What did you do?&quot; Marcus crossed his arms over his wine belly impatiently. Clearly not liking where this is going.<br />
<br />
Nate gave it up, defeated he said. &quot;Bah... I&#39;ll tell you everything.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
---------------<br />
<br />
Nate admitted that while he did intended on making Marcus, and Allen Sports fans, but Owen had another idea. And gave him a suggestion that would result in all three of us wearing sports jerseys. &quot;But I didn&#39;t know it would come to this! Bah, I was ready, when I-...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Is that way you took so long?&quot; Allen was so shocked he hadn&#39;t spoken until now. And he is feeling both sad for Nate, and worried about their predicament now. And he ask Nate. &quot;Was this before, or after you showed me your planned stats?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It was after...&quot; Nate admitted. And Allen looked away. &quot;Bah-But you said you trust me, right?&quot; Realizing the mistake of trusting a machine over his better judgment.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes!&quot; Allen say. &quot;I trusted &#39;you&#39;!&quot;<br />
<br />
And Nate looks down in shame. Marcus still fidgeting his loose fitting jersey. &quot;Bah! At least things can&#39;t get any worse, right?...&quot; Nate looks at his device worriedly. &quot;...Right?&quot;<br />
<br />
But it did! Nate entire room starts spinning, it spins, and spins until it slows down, and as everything clears up. They all end up where the audience are at, surrounded by sport fans who wanted to be here. Rather they are myth, or human.<br />
<br />
&quot;We need to get out of sight!&quot; Nate stated as the three of them got to where food, and merchandise are being sold. At least now they can talk privately as he looks at his device. &quot;Owen, why did you bring us to the actual game?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s stated in the stats screen. You did looked at it before you hit &#39;accept&#39;, didn&#39;t you?&quot; Owen asked incredulously. That made Nate blush, of course he didn&#39;t.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bah! Great Pan! That is not the answer to the question I asked, and you know it!&quot; Nate almost shouted at that. When he remembered he&#39;s still in a public space. Marcus is agitated, and Allen is worried. Being in the actual game would be a night worth remembering. But still...<br />
<br />
&quot;Good Pan! Please help me out of these clothes! They&#39;re umcomfortable!&quot; Marcus wishes to be able to pull the jersey off, but was unable to.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nate?&quot; Allen spoken. &quot;Are there any more changes, or is that it?&quot; <br />
<br />
That is a fair question. And Nate looks back at Owen. &quot;Well?... Is there more?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hold on for a moment, while I check to see if there is any more left to change...&quot; Nate is concerned about what he just said. &quot;And what are you changing next exactly?&quot; Nate asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ll see.&quot; Owen said. And so, Nate pulls up the statistic screen. And he simultaneously looks at it, and the game as he witness the inevitable change that is about to happen.</p>

So what did Owen change next?</h3>
