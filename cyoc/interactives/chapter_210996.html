<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After a while of thought and checking himself out in the mirror, Tyler, for some odd reason, feels as if something does not look right. What the boy does not know is that his mind has divided, one part is human, the other part Fox. Both parts of his mind are at 50%, for some reason though, his Fox-mind is a tad stronger, causing the boy to think his lower body should be that of a fox. Tyler watches his tail swish back and forth behind him, his penis still at its 6 inch erect state, “seeing myself like this, gives me the odd feeling that something is not right,” the boy mumbles to himself, “the thought of changing the lower part of my body to that of a fox feels like the right thing to do... in a strange way.” The boy tilts his head, “come to think of it,” he continues, “having the legs of a Fox would be amazing, I bet I&#39;d be the fastest kid in school,” he says, giggling and grinning at the thought, “and... most importantly, my cock would be even bigger, if it were the cock of a Fox.” Tyler licks his lips at that thought, “oh yes... that would be awesome! Hehe... every girl would want to feel and taste it,” so without a second thought, Tyler heads back to Jeff&#39;s laptop and starts to edit his file.<br />
<br />
After confirming the change, Tyler walks back to Jeff&#39;s full length mirror, wanting to watch the change closely. Tyler lets out a giggle, when he feels the tingling sensation run through his body once again, his penis twitches, causing the boy to let out a moan. The boy then feels his feet start to itch, when he looks down his eyes widen when he sees black fur starting to sprout out of his feet. The black fur slowly moves up the boy&#39;s legs, when the fur passes the boy&#39;s knee caps, the fur takes on a nice red color. Tyler strokes his leg and is amazed by how soft the fur feels, a smile appears on his face and his tail wags behind him. The fur continues up his body towards the boy&#39;s crotch, when the fur starts to cover the boy&#39;s sack, penis and hips, the fur turns snow white. Tyler feels the changes stopping and takes a while to take it in, he turns from side to side, “not bad,” the boy says, “I am really happy the way it... wait... my feet feel funny,” he says when he feels a strange prickling in his feet.<br />
<br />
The boy suddenly feels himself being forced to stand on his toes, while his heels start to lengthen, this causes Tyler to lose his balance, but as if he knew what to do, he instinctively moves his tail to balance himself out. Tyler does not think anything of it, he simply assumes that he had moved his tail slightly, what he does not know is that the animal-part of his mind is in more control than his human-part. The boy watches as his toes shrivel and become stubby, his nails become black and long, resembling claws. Tyler then feels a popping sensation on the bottom of his new paws as pads appear, his big to has shrunken away completely. He then feels his thighs pop as the muscles and bones rearrange themselves, giving the boy digitigrade legs. Tyler&#39;s eyes are wide in surprise, “I really have the legs of an animal! Amazing,” he says, then he feels his penis tingle, this causes the boy to let out a moan of pleasure.<br />
<br />
Tyler starts to pant, his eyes glassing over, as he looks down at his privates, he watches as the skin from his penis seems to melt and fuse with the skin on his tummy, soon resembling a furry sheath. The boy feels the head of his penis morph inside of the sheath, it seems to change shape and become bigger. Soon the boy notices the pink tip poking out of his new sheath, slowly becoming longer and thicker. Tyler grins, dazed by pleasure, as he watches his new cock take shape, soon the boy has the cock of a fox, “d-damn... that DEFIENTLY got bigger... at least an inch!”<br />
<br />
The horny fox-satyr, which Tyler now has become, takes his new penis into his hands and starts to stroke it, his lust growing, “s-so sensitive... s-so good...,” the boy breaths, not noticing that his vocabulary seems to sound a bit off. What Tyler is unaware of, the transformation is not yet over, since he had selected to have his lower body become that of a fox, meant his seed also would change. The boy is unaware that his body is preparing to “swap out” his seed, this meant: Tyler would need to empty his balls in order for the animal seed to replace the human seed. So, the boy&#39;s body is causing Tyler to become more and more horny, “ha-hands... no good...,” he says, not noticing as he lets out a whine, “n-need... some-something better.”<br />
<br />
Tyler looks around, he then spots the “Sex Doll”, which is still lying on Jeff&#39;s bed, “perfect,” he says and hurries over.<br />
<br />
Jeff is shocked, when he suddenly sees his brother&#39;s face pop into his view, the look in his brother&#39;s eyes cause Jeff to feel uneasy. “Ty-Tyler... what are you doing,” he tries to ask, then remembering that he is unable to speak, he can just lie there, unable to say or do anything. Jeff&#39;s panic grows when he feels his brother&#39;s hands on his legs, starting to push them apart, &#39;nonononononono... NO! This can&#39;t be happening,&#39; Jeff thinks to himself, &#39;I don&#39;t want to be fucked by my brother! I AM NOT GAY!!!&#39;<br />
<br />
Tyler of course is unaware that the Sex Doll is his big brother, all Tyler knows is that he needs release. Once the “doll&#39;s” legs are spread wide enough, the Fox-Satyr waists no time and rams his 7 inch cock into the “doll&#39;s” tight hole, causing Jeff to mentally scream in pain. Tyler, unaware of his brother&#39;s predicament, starts to thrust wildly in and out of the “doll&#39;s” ass.<br />
<br />
&#39;FUCK! IT HURTS,&#39; Jeff mentally cries, &#39;wh-what has gotten into Ty!? He is not acting normally, he... he is acting like some sex crazy animal!&#39;<br />
<br />
After a few strong thrusts, Tyler feels the pressure in his balls building, he starts to thrust even faster and harder until, with a loud moan, he cums into the “doll”. As he cums, Tyler continues to thrust, “need... to... empty... balls,” the boy moans, “n-not much... longer...!”<br />
<br />
Tyler cums at least another six times, when he finally feels his balls are empty, whith a satisfied sigh, the Fox-Satyr pulls out of the “doll”. The boy pants and looks down, he sees some of his cum dripping out of the “doll&#39;s” stretched anus. He tilts his head, he then lowers his head and sniffs at the cum, he then recoils, his nose wrinkling in disgust, “white stuff... no smell right,” he mutters, still not realizing the lack of vocabulary.<br />
<br />
Jeff meanwhile is crying, &#39;I can&#39;t believe I got fucked by my little brother,&#39; he thinks to himself, &#39;this is hell!&#39;<br />
<br />
Tyler lets out a huff, he then jumps off of the bed and sits down on the carpet like an animal, Tyler does not notice as he bends his back and starts to lick his cock clean. Once he had done that, the Fox-Satyr rolls up on the carpet and falls asleep.</p>
