<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Josh was looking over Anna&#39;s profile when something caught his eye. There was a menu labeled &quot;Memories&quot;, with a number at the top that kept updating. 8,675 ... 8,713 ... 8,791 ... Josh watched the count increase with amazement. The resort had to create an entirely different life for Anna, and in the minutes that had passed since he changed her, it clearly hadn&#39;t finished filling in all the retroactive details. Even now, it was still generating a past for her, the same way that it had filled his head with experiences the two of them never actually had.<br />
<br />
He was immediately tempted to open up the menu and see what their recent fun had looked like from Anna&#39;s perspective. But the idea of violating her privacy like that made him uncomfortable. He would never be the type to go through her phone or snoop on her whereabouts, and this was a lot more invasive than that. He reminded himself, though, that these memories weren&#39;t actually real. None of the events in there, except for the last few minutes of them, had ever happened. They were created by the resort just a few minutes ago, and they would probably be deleted the moment he turned Anna back to normal. So why not take the opportunity to see the world through his fiancée&#39;s eyes for a minute?<br />
<br />
As Josh moved his hand to open the &quot;Memories&quot; screen, he was expecting it to give him some sort of list, probably with the newest ones first, so he could sort through and find the most intriguing ones. But instead, he was suddenly bombarded with a flood of images that passed through his mind, the same way that his own false memories had been inserted into him a moment ago. He had accidentally touched the option right underneath &quot;Memories&quot;, which was labeled &quot;Transfer memories to user&quot;. And it was starting from the beginning.<br />
<br />
A lot of Anna&#39;s earliest memories now involved looking up at the giant faces of her parents, who always had a worried look in their eyes even when their mouths were smiling. The young toddler hadn&#39;t understood this, of course, but Josh could see their anxiety clearly as their faces flashed by. Then, as she got a little older, her mother gently trying to explain to Anna - at first in the simplest of terms, then with bigger words and more details - that she was different from the other children. No, she couldn&#39;t go and play with them. No, she couldn&#39;t do any of the things that the kids on TV could do. And no, absolutely not - she couldn&#39;t go to school. All the terrifying, life-threatening things that could easily happen to her there filled Anna&#39;s imagination.<br />
<br />
It was hard for Josh to even watch, let alone practically relive as if it had happened to himself. This version of Anna had grown up so isolated from the rest of the world. It was for good reason that she had to be homeschooled, of course, but he could feel how frustrated she was as she got older, how badly she wished she could be like the other kids her age, kids that she only knew about from TV. Or, rather, from the small touchscreen that her mom had gotten her, which might as well have been a huge flat-screen TV when Anna sat in front of it.<br />
<br />
And, at the same time, he could see the roiling emotions on her mother&#39;s face, which always hung above her like the sun in the sky - sometimes warm and bright, sometimes blazing with heated anger. Mom, who still held out a desperate hope that her daughter&#39;s condition could be cured. Who was bursting with excitement every time she saw that Anna had gained another millimeter in height, only to realize that her growth was only proportionate to a normal child&#39;s development - that she was never going to catch up. Who couldn&#39;t always keep her honest feelings bottled up - who had shouted, more than once, in a deafening roar, &quot;I wish you could just be normal!&quot; And, all the while, a dad who seemed to be in the house less and less often, until he stopped showing up in her memories at all.<br />
<br />
As the years passed, Anna&#39;s disappointment at being kept away from the rest of the world hardened into resentment, and her worst experiences with her parents fed a rebellious teenage angst. There were more than a few times that she tried to escape from the carefully constructed rooms and appropriately-sized furniture her mother had built around her - a glorified dollhouse, Anna started to think - only to realize that she had nowhere to go if she did get out. She wanted to believe that her mother was wrong to keep her here, that the wider world wouldn&#39;t be such a dangerous place for her after all. But her fear of the giants out there ran deep, especially when she had no idea what it was really like to live among them.<br />
<br />
Puberty came to her a little later than most girls her age. Whether that was related to her condition, the doctors couldn&#39;t say. But when it finally did hit, her sexuality was warped by the knowledge that she would never find a guy that matched her size. No one would ever be... compatible with her, in that sense. The very idea of meeting another person on equal terms, whether that was because they had somehow shrunk or because she had somehow grown, was nothing more than an impossible fantasy to her. It was a fantasy that she indulged in often, in the long, lonely hours after homeschooling lessons were done for the day. More often, though, her thoughts were more realistic, and more degrading. Riding on a man&#39;s enormous cock... drowning in a pool of his cum... She thought to herself that, even if she ever got lucky enough to have some sort of relationship, the most she could hope for was to be seen as a worthless little toy.<br />
<br />
Even so, the isolation was driving Anna crazy. She knew what she was missing out on, and even though she could never have it all, she begged and pleaded with her mom for even the slightest of opportunities to make some friends her own age. Josh had met his future mother-in-law several times, and she had always seemed like a perfectly normal and well-adjusted woman. It was clear to him that, in this alternate reality, life experiences had caused her personality to become a lot different. By this point in Anna&#39;s memories, her gigantic face was haggard, lined with constant worry that had aged her a lot more than sixteen years since the girl&#39;s birth. And she was an almost-literal helicopter parent, always hovering overhead. On the few occasions she <i>did</i> allow Anna to leave the house, she was watching like a hawk the whole time, and effectively scaring away anyone who might be curious enough to get to know her.<br />
<br />
The one solace Anna had in her life, the thing she could always rely on, was the Internet. Without her mother&#39;s permission, she had figured out how to switch the giant phone in her room out of TV mode, and soon she could browse all she wanted. She might not have any real-world friends to speak of, but that just gave her all the more time to meet people online. As she explored social media sites, and inevitably started to seek out porn on them as well as friendly people, she quickly learned that there were entire communities for people who got off on the idea of a tiny person just like herself. But Anna stayed far away from those corners of the Internet, and she tried to forget that she&#39;d ever even seen them. For her, the appeal of the digital world was how it let her pretend to be normal. None of her new friends would ever know that the girl they were talking to was six inches tall, and that was exactly how she wanted it.<br />
<br />
But as Anna grew older, having that outlet just wasn&#39;t enough for her. It didn&#39;t take her mind off the tiny world that her tiny self was confined to. It made her want to get out of there even more, no matter how impractical or how dangerous that might be. She counted down the days to her 18th birthday, knowing that she would be a legal adult with the right to do whatever she wanted. But her birthday came and went, because convincing her mother of that was another matter. No matter what the law said, she physically could not just get up and walk out the door of their house. Plus, in the meantime, the stress of it all had taken years off of Mom&#39;s life - even if Anna obeyed her wishes and never tried to get herself emancipated, there was the ever-present worry that her mother could just drop dead and leave her trapped in an empty house.<br />
<br />
If she was ever going to get out of there alive, Anna knew she needed a plan. She also knew that, as much as she disliked the idea, she would always have to have someone who would take care of her, and protect her, and give her a safe place to stay. Again, the Internet was the only tool she had. She agonized for months over whether she should tell some of her online friends about her condition, with the faint hope that maybe one of them would be willing to help.<br />
<br />
It was around that time that she first messaged Josh. She quickly developed a crush on him, and it wasn&#39;t long before they were sending each other nude pictures - Anna&#39;s always being carefully cropped to avoid giving any hint about her size. She fantasized about him constantly, sometimes in her dreams and sometimes wide awake. Sometimes she imagined him being the same height as her, and sometimes she thought about what he would really look like to her. Either way, she had a crush that kept getting stronger with each passing day. And the longer they e-dated, the more she felt like she could trust him. <br />
<br />
Late one night, she finally worked up the courage to tell him her secret. She figured he probably wouldn&#39;t even believe her when she told him, but he was surprisingly cool with it. It helped that she had some old news articles from around the time she was born, all about a &quot;medical miracle&quot;, that she could send him as further proof. (Come to think of it, Anna had realized as she looked through those articles, that was probably part of why her mother had always been so protective of her. All that intense publicity from before she could even remember - and then the stories abruptly stopped coming the moment her parents went home from the hospital...)<br />
<br />
Once she had gotten over that hurdle, she wanted to meet him in person. She <i>needed</i> to. She understood the risks, but after the reveal went so smoothly, she fully trusted him. But Mom would never allow it. Her mother would be horrified to learn that she&#39;d figured out how to get herself unrestricted Internet access, even before finding out what she was using it for. Anna stewed over it, and had many late-night texting conversations with Josh where they planned out how to get together in secret. All their plans suffered from some obvious flaw that made the idea impossible - except one. And that one would require her to commit to their relationship like she&#39;d never committed to anything before...<br />
<br />
The day that Josh knocked on her mother&#39;s door started like any other, but he and Anna had plotted this out for months before they finally agreed to go through with it. When Mom answered the door, he produced the marriage license that the two of them had applied for online and announced that she was going to live with him from now on. Anna confirmed, as loudly as she could, that this really was what she wanted, while Josh rushed in and scooped up the dollhouse in his arms. By this point in the constant flashing of memories, Josh could barely even remember that he <i>was</i> Josh, watching all of these fictional events happen through his fiancée&#39;s eyes, and not actually Anna living through them. The sight of his own giant self looming over her like that only disoriented him more.<br />
<br />
Anyway, her mother cried and screamed, but there was nothing she could legally do to stop them. Josh walked out the door carrying Anna&#39;s whole living quarters bridal-style in his arms - forcing her to realize, with tears in her eyes, that she would likely never see her mom again. Why was that thought getting to her? She&#39;d made up her mind long ago that Mom was an abusive captor, that she had to get out by any means necessary. She reminded herself of that as she dried her tears and let Josh take her back to his bachelor pad. Both of them were thrilled that they&#39;d actually pulled it off.<br />
<br />
And Anna was certain she&#39;d made the right decision when she saw firsthand how much of a perfect gentleman Josh could be. She watched him, day by day, remodeling her whole enclosure with his bare hands until it was exactly how she wanted it. How carefully he cut up his food until he could hand down a portion that was just the right size for her. Figuring out how to set up his webcam so they could have a Skype call, where the Josh on Anna&#39;s screen looked like he was the same height, standing right in front of her.<br />
<br />
So after all of that... when she eventually found out about his transformation fetish... it felt like a betrayal. The moment she spotted websites like &quot;CYOC&quot; in his browser history, the memory of those online kinks came rushing back to her - she knew exactly what they were. She suddenly felt like she&#39;d jumped out of the frying pan and into the fire, leaving her mom behind only to end up as a man&#39;s personal perverted plaything. Her past anxieties flooded into her head again, worse than ever before. Was she going to be trapped here, effectively his property, for the rest of her life?<br />
<br />
Josh frantically tried to convince her that it wasn&#39;t what it looked like. He swore that he&#39;d fallen madly in love with her before he had the slightest inkling about her size. He pointed out that, unlike that mother of hers, he let her leave the dollhouse whenever she wanted, let her walk around freely on the kitchen countertop and the coffee table and his computer desk - which was, after all, how she&#39;d come across that fetish stuff in the first place. And he reminded her that he&#39;d never once tried to do anything with her physically - the closest they&#39;d ever come to sex was mutual masturbation through the phone line.<br />
<br />
Still, though, he had a lot of explaining to do if he wanted to regain a fraction of her trust. And then the perfect opportunity arrived for him to prove he wasn&#39;t in it for her size. The moment the Transformation Resort was first announced to the public, they agreed to book tickets. Josh and Anna were both a little skeptical that the Resort could actually do everything it promised, but the rave reviews told them it was all somehow real. Forget the Skype calls - the two of them could actually <i>be</i> the same size. And better yet, Anna could walk out of there - not get carried out of there, but <i>walk</i> - as a perfectly normal woman.<br />
<br />
And when the day finally came... the utter bliss she had felt when she saw her fiancé shrinking down to her natural height and reached out to embrace him. Of course, what she really wanted was to grow to his size, not have him come down to match her. But Josh had somehow convinced her that it would be more rewarding this way, and promised that when they were done experimenting, she could take whatever form she wanted and keep it. So she went along with his idea, and the two of them tried out one size after another before she finally got what she was waiting her whole life for. That is, both the increase in size and the passionate, exhausting, unbelievable sex.<br />
<br />
When the parade of her memories had finally caught up to the present moment, Anna sat back in the white void, dazed. Wait, no - Josh was the one in a daze, wasn&#39;t he? He realized that she now had two lifetimes&#39; worth of memories crammed into a single brain, making her believe that he really <i>was</i> Anna just as much as she understood that she was actually Josh.<br />
<br />
The part of him that was Anna was left in a state of disbelief wrapped in anger. To think that her entire life, and all the traumatic experiences that she&#39;d been through, were a fictional construct - inflicted on her by a random whim from the man she loved - was an even greater betrayal than finding out he was into this sort of thing in the first place. She felt as if she was confronting a vengeful god, coming face-to-face with the very being that had made her the way she was - a deformed societal outcast who wanted nothing more than to be normal, and believing up until a few weeks ago that she could never have it.<br />
<br />
But, at the same time, she understood that any revenge he could possibly get, he would be taking it out against herself. Josh - whatever part of her still was Josh - fumbled for the window full of options, and then stopped. He could easily remove all of Anna&#39;s memories from his aching, dizzy head just by pressing that button again. The very thought of doing it made her panic, though, just as it would if she tried to delete all of Josh&#39;s memories and make himself fully Anna. Oh, he had fucked this up <i>bad</i>. How was he going to untangle this mess?</p>
