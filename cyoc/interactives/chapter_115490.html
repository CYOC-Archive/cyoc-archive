<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jules had always worshipped his mother Jenna. She had raised him alone, and<br />
had always seen that he had the best life she could provide for the two of<br />
them. Maybe she was a little overprotective of her only child, but Jules<br />
always loved being close to his Mom, and comsidered her his best<br />
friend. Truth be told, he deeply wished he could be exactly like her.<br />
    Jenna was pretty, with stylish medium length brown hair, and sparkling<br />
green eyes full of fun. Jules admired her taste in clothes--she always<br />
looked so put-together and beautiful to her son. He loved to just watch her<br />
expressions as she went about whatever she was doing; her animation and<br />
enthusiasm for whatever she undertook was contagious. Jules also just loved<br />
her physical grace. he loved just watching her do something as simple as<br />
reaching for the television remote on the coffee table. Her bracelets would<br />
make a gentle sound together and catch the lamp light as her slender<br />
fingers grasped the controller. Her face would show her usual expectation<br />
of something wonderful, though there was usually just the usual dreck on<br />
tv. That was the thing about Jenna, she could make the most ordinary<br />
situations seem fun and full of promise.<br />
    Even though Jules was now thirteen years old, he still loved it when<br />
she would smile at him and give him a hug and a kiss. He was in heaven if<br />
she would let him be in her arms, resting against her, loving the soft feel<br />
of her pretty sweater, the lovely scent of her fragrance that she wore. At<br />
an age when most boys couldn&#39;t be seen with their Moms, Jules made no bones<br />
about the fact that he loved spending time with Jenna, going shopping with<br />
her or to the movies or anyplace.<br />
    Jenna felt lucky. When her friends&#39; kids were driving them crazy with<br />
snotty or dangerous behavior, her Jules seemed intent only on pleasing<br />
her. She was well aware that her son would eagerly do anything she might<br />
ask of him. He acted almost as though...almost as though he were IN LOVE<br />
with her.<br />
    &quot;Well? What of it?&quot; she would think to herself happily. &quot;What&#39;s wrong<br />
with that, if he&#39;s a little bit in love with me? I think it&#39;s sweet.&quot;<br />
    The truth was, Jules would fly to the moon if she asked it of him, or<br />
at least he would try his best. Seeing her pleased and smiling at him gave<br />
him a feeling he wouldn&#39;t trade for anything. So, he helped her around the<br />
house, kept her company and carried things when she went shopping, and made<br />
her little gifts and wrote her sweet notes telling her how great he thought<br />
she was.<br />
    Not that Jules wasn&#39;t interested in girls his own age. In fact, he<br />
spent a fair amount of time mooning over the pretty blonde girl Shannon,<br />
who was in his class at school and lived right next door. He would sadly<br />
watch her come and go, never getting more than rolled eyes from her if she<br />
was alone, or giggles if she was with her girlfriends. Not that Jules was a<br />
geek or anything, he wasn&#39;t. Shannon just didn&#39;t seem interested<br />
somehow. But that didn&#39;t keep Jules from dreaming about her in bed at<br />
night, remembering how beautiful she looked in her cute clothes, with her<br />
hair clean and shining, and her sexy feminine walk that just hypnotized<br />
him. It was a bittersweet feeling.<br />
    One evening as Jules lay with his head in Jenna&#39;s lap, she paused in<br />
stroking his hair and asked him if anything was wrong.<br />
    &quot;You seem so distracted, honey,&quot; she ventured gently. The silky sound<br />
of his mother&#39;s beautiful voice always got to Jules. He absolutely loved<br />
the sound of his Mom&#39;s voice. He turned his face up to look at her. The<br />
lovely roundness of her breasts near his face made him feel safe and also<br />
made him admire her, and want to be even closer to her.<br />
    &quot;Oh. Mom, it&#39;s just Shannon.&quot;<br />
    &quot;Shannon next door,huh? I could tell you were noticing her a lot,<br />
honey.&quot; His Mom always seemed to be one step ahead of him. She traced her<br />
perfectly manicured finger along his hairline. &quot;You like her.&quot; It was a<br />
statement, not a question.<br />
   He sighed and snuggled in closer to his Mom. &quot;Yeah, I do. I&#39;d love to be<br />
with her, to spend time with her and ...you know, kiss her and ...&quot;<br />
    &quot;Make love with her,&quot; Jenna prompted softly.<br />
    Jules was surprised, but not surprised. His Mom was always<br />
straightforward, in her wonderful, gentle way.<br />
    &quot;Yeah. But....she&#39;s not interested.&quot; A thought came to Jules then, an<br />
irrational thought he had had many times and couldn&#39;t seem to put aside. He<br />
thought to himself, if I were beautiful and feminine like Mom, Shannon<br />
might want me then. If I could offer her the same wonderful, soft, sexy,<br />
beautiful things she has to offer, herself, then....<br />
    &quot;It&#39;s funny, Mom,&quot; Jules began.<br />
    &quot;What is, honey. Tell me.&quot;<br />
    Jules had always shared everything with Jenna, and this was to be no<br />
exception. &quot;Well...I not only want to be with Shannon...I want to be LIKE<br />
her, too.&quot;<br />
    &quot;What do you mean?&quot; urged Jenna softly. But she knew.<br />
    &quot;Oh Mom, I wish I could have long soft hair like she does, and look<br />
like her, and just be more....like girls. Girls rule, I admire them so<br />
much...that sometimes I want to be one.&#39; He looked shyly and unsurely up at<br />
his Mom.<br />
    Jenna just smiled warmly at her son, and stroked his face and said, &quot;I<br />
know, Jules. And I can tell you something else about girls...we know when a<br />
boy adores us. And the difference between rude staring and genuine<br />
admiration. Do you think I don&#39;t love the way you always look at me as if I<br />
were made of honey and sunlight?&quot;<br />
    Jules looked away and smiled, then looked up at his Mom again. &quot;I love<br />
you, Mommy!&quot;<br />
    &quot;And I love you.&quot;<br />
    &quot;I wish...I wish that I could be exactly like you.&quot;<br />
    Jenna couldn&#39;t speak. She just leaned over and hugged and gently kissed<br />
her child.<br />
<br />
The next day, while Jules was at school, Jenna took her lunch break to stop<br />
by the local mall and pick up some things for Halloween. A store called<br />
Hart&#39;s Desires had a gorgeous display up, with grinning jack-o-lanterns,<br />
cloth ghosts being blown about by a fan, and all sorts of orange and black<br />
gew gaws. Jenna walked slowly through the aisles, looking at costumes and<br />
decorations. Her face was lit up, her usual ability to take great pleasure<br />
in little things evident in her expression.<br />
   Eventually, she found herself standing near the check out, looking at<br />
the impulse items stacked there. She looked up and found herself looking<br />
into the face of a lovely young woman with caramel skin and wise dark eyes.<br />
   &quot;Hello, love,&quot; she said.<br />
   Jenna was speechless for a moment. The young woman was dressed in all<br />
black, from her ribbed turtleneck sweater to her jeans to her boots, which<br />
Jenna saw when she stepped out from behind the counter. This woman was<br />
absolutely combustible. It wasn&#39;t so much her physical beauty, although she<br />
was attractive, as it was her presence. She looked only about twenty, but<br />
gave off the sense of being timeless.<br />
    &quot;Your face is happy, but your heart has a care,&quot; said the young woman,<br />
looking deeply into Jenna&#39;s eyes.<br />
   Jenna thought about pretending not to know what she meant, but found<br />
herself saying, simply, &quot;Yes. How did you know that?&quot;<br />
   &quot;I suppose,&quot; said the young woman, smiling impishly, and adopting a<br />
sudden accent, &quot;it must be because the blood of gypsy queens flows in my<br />
veins.&quot;<br />
    &quot;Oh! Well...Your Majesty!&quot; replied Jenna with a laugh and a mock<br />
curtsey. They were alone in the store.<br />
    &quot;I am right , though, about this care, yes love?&quot;<br />
    &quot;Yes,&quot; whispered Jenna. What was it about this young woman, she<br />
wondered. If she told me to kneel to her right here in the store, right<br />
now, I believe I would, she thought wildly.<br />
    The girl traced Jenna&#39;s soft cheek with her fingers, trailed them down<br />
her sensitive throat, then placed her small hand over Jenna&#39;s heart, a much<br />
too intimate gesture for a stranger to make. Yet, Jenna made no move to<br />
stop her.<br />
    &quot;There is one who lives here,&quot; said the young woman, in her soothing<br />
way. &quot;And that is the one you worry for.&quot;<br />
    Jenna managed a nod.<br />
    &quot;Woman,&quot; the salesgirl said as sensuously as warm dribbling honey, &quot;<br />
you have the power to change everything...your woman&#39;s heart knows how to<br />
set everything right.&quot; Her hand moved in a slight circle, gently, against<br />
Jenna&#39;s sweater. She felt her nipples harden.<br />
    The girl held up her left hand and showed Jenna the ring that she<br />
wore. The gem began to swirl as if it were alive, and suddenly, Jenna was<br />
seeing Jules walking down the hallway at school, hands in pockets, being<br />
bumped by someone rushing past. He turned to look, and seemed to look<br />
straight at his mother, standing there in Hart&#39;s Desires with a young<br />
woman&#39;s hand over her heart.<br />
    &quot;You created this person that you love as you love your self,&quot; said the<br />
young woman.<br />
    Jenna cleared her throat and said, shakily, &quot;Well, I had some help!&quot; It<br />
sounded lame and untrue.<br />
    &quot;No, love. You know that isn&#39;t true. Your child came from you, and you<br />
alone.&quot;<br />
    &quot;That&#39;s impossible.&quot;<br />
    &quot;No, love. It is simple truth.&quot; They locked eyes a moment. Something<br />
gave way inside Jenna.<br />
    &quot;Yes,&quot; she acknowledged. And she knew in her bones that it was<br />
true. Just as she had always known it.<br />
    The young woman&#39;s delicate, knowing hands widened their circle and<br />
caressed Jenna&#39;s breasts. She stood with her back to the entrance, so no<br />
one coming in could see her touching Jenna.<br />
    &quot;Take your child back, now. You must make him surrender to you<br />
utterly. Trust you, utterly. Only then will he become you.&quot; She caressed Jenna&#39;s excited nipple with her<br />
thumb and finger. &quot;You know how to make him surrender completely to your<br />
will. Don&#39;t you, Jenna?&quot;<br />
    Jenna was aroused now. &quot;I couldn&#39;t do...that,&quot; she pleaded.<br />
   &quot;As you wish,&quot; said the girl, and turned away, leaving Jenna standing<br />
there, breathless. She returned behind the counter and seemed to busy<br />
herself with paperwork.<br />
   Jenna stepped up to the counter on shaky legs. &quot;It would be wrong...&quot;<br />
   The young woman&#39;s gaze was level and peaceful. &quot;Would it, love? You know<br />
in your heart what&#39;s wrong is not the thing I have suggested. You can heal<br />
this hurt...forever.&quot; She showed Jenna an innocent looking packet of Smiley<br />
Pumpkin Faces.<br />
    &quot;Have him eat the Smileys,&quot; said the dark-clad young woman, smirking.<br />
    &quot;What?&quot; Jenna would have thought she&#39;d been made a fool of except for<br />
her deep sense that this woman would not do that.<br />
    &quot;Then, do what we have talked about.&quot; With that, she leaned across the<br />
counter, took Jenna&#39;s beautiful face in her hands, and kissed her full on<br />
the mouth. Her lips were soft, her tongue, knowing. Jenna melted completely<br />
and knew what she had to do. Behind them, a cloth ghost spun in the<br />
air. There was no fan, There was no string.<br />
<br />
Jules arrived home in a sad mood because Shannon had ignored him again<br />
today, despite his attempts to talk to her. But his spirits lifted when he<br />
saw his Mom&#39;s car in the drive, and he walked in and smelled something<br />
baking. She was licking chocolate batter off her fingers when he walked in<br />
and kissed her hello.<br />
    &quot;Wow, Mom, it smells great...what is it?&#39;<br />
    &quot;Halloween cupcakes! And I&#39;m putting these dopey Smiley Pumpkins on<br />
them,&quot; she said, laughing. He loved how his pretty Mom got a charge out of<br />
the silliest stuff. he smiled adoringly at her and then went upstairs.<br />
   When the time came to open the package and put the pumpkin faces on the<br />
icing, Jenna tore open the bag and orange sparks flew in all<br />
directions. She gingerly took out a pumpkin face and her eyes got big as<br />
she saw ITS eyes glowing!<br />
    &quot;Hoo boy,&quot; she said. Then she placed the Faces on the cupcakes. After a<br />
few minutes, the glowing stopped.<br />
   Jenna watched closely that evening as Jules ate several of the cupcakes,<br />
to no apparent effect, except that it made him sleepy. So sleepy that she<br />
had to guide him to bed at eight o&#39;clock.<br />
   She tenderly steered him into HER bedroom. He was too sleepy to even<br />
notice. She laid him down on the bed and undressed him, then undressed<br />
herself, and got into bed with her child. Her body was soft and warm. She<br />
lay gently on top of him and his eyes opened in dreamy surprise and<br />
wonder. She smiled reassuringly and kissed him lightly on the lips. Then<br />
she guided his unresisting hand to the fullness of her breast.<br />
    &quot;Mom...&quot;<br />
    &quot;Shhhh. Relax, honey. Leave everything to me. Do you trust me?<br />
Completely?&quot;<br />
    &quot;Yes, Mom!&quot;<br />
    &quot;Good, sweetie. Just give yourself over to Mommy. Let Mommy make<br />
everything all right.&quot; She kissed him and began moving against him. He<br />
helplessly wrapped his arms around her and yielded to her. She became wet<br />
quickly and rubbed herself against him, but did not take him inside her. He<br />
began to moan with pleasure and kept telling Jenna how much he loved<br />
her. She shifted so that she could whisper in his ear as she moved on top<br />
of him.<br />
    &quot;Give yourself to me, Jules,&quot; she softly urged her only child. &quot;It&#39;s<br />
time to come back to Mommy. You&#39;re helpless, so helpless...and it feels so<br />
good to let Mommy take over once and for all....Jules, honey....there is no<br />
part of you that you can call your own...all of you is under my loving<br />
control. Feel the pleasure building as you surrender to me, honey. You can<br />
no longer resist at all....&quot;<br />
    Jules&#39;s eyes were closed and he was moaning, &quot;Yes, Mom, oh yes, I&#39;m<br />
totally yours, I always have been, oh Mom, you&#39;re so beautiful!&quot; His body began to slowly grow bigger under his mother. His member slurped up into him and started forming into something else. <br />
   Two small buds had formed on Jules chest, Jenna lifted up just slightly, so she could move her nipples against him, this caused the two buds to slowly grow into a full pair of breast,<br />
as she rubbed her sex against her son. &quot;Are you mine, Jules...ALL Mommy&#39;s?&quot;<br />
    &quot;Yes! Yessssss!&quot; He was near orgasm with his Mom. His body had aged to his Mom&#39;s age, his lower body was changing into a mature woman&#39;s. <br />
    &quot;Open yourself to me....give in completely...lose yourself in me....&quot;<br />
    Jules was lost in profound ecstasy underneath his Mom. He sensed<br />
something very powerful flowing between them. It filled him, electrified<br />
him, he felt his very soul opening to her at her slightest whim. His face was stretching and rearanging into that of an older womans. He  felt an<br />
incredibly powerful force gathering within him, about to come rolling<br />
through every fibre of his being. He didn&#39;t care. He welcomed it. He was<br />
entirely hers. He began to come.<br />
    She heard herself saying, &quot;Good girl! Good girl, Jules! Mommy&#39;s very<br />
own girl, that&#39;s right, let it come...&quot; At her words, Jules went into an<br />
ecstatic frenzy, bucking underneath his Mom, screaming that he loved her,<br />
that he was hers, that he was her girl.<br />
    They lay quivering and out of breath for several minutes. Then, Jenna<br />
raised up and looked into the smooth mature face of her child. Her breath caught<br />
in her throat. She was looking at her own face. She smiled and, trying to contain her excitement, took<br />
Jules&#39;s hand and guided it along her child&#39;s body. Jules was now<br />
smooth. Two large but perfectly shaped D cup breasts graced Jules&#39;s chest. She<br />
guided Jules&#39;s hand between his legs....but he was no &quot;he&quot; anymore. She was<br />
now Jules for Julie. She had transformed into a perfect copy of her mother. Julie always wanted to be more like her mom, now she got what she wanted.<br />
    &quot;Mom?.....Sis?&quot; she said, and her voice was high and clear.<br />
    &quot;Yes....Julie...?&quot;<br />
    &quot;Thank you! This is what I&#39;ve always wanted and you made it happen<br />
somehow...I love you so much!&quot;<br />
    They lay together talking and kissing all night. They would never sleep<br />
together again. But their love would be unbreakable and strong as they<br />
became twins from that day on.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t wait until Shannon sees me now!&quot; Said Julie as she admired her new body in the mirror. &quot;She won&#39;t be able to resist you sis.&quot; Said Jenna. <br />
Then Julie sighed &quot;Only one problem though, theres quite an age gap between us now.&quot;<br />
&quot;Why don&#39;t you invite her over? Didn&#39;t you say you two got assigned to the same group project?&quot; Asked Jenna. <br />
Julie turned to her sister and smiled.<br />
<br />
Two hours later, Shannon knocked on Jule&#39;s door. Shannon liked Jules fine as a friend, but she had suspected that Jules wanted to be more than that. Shannon however was gay and she was planned to let Jules down gently today while they worked on there project. <br />
The door opened and Jule&#39;s mom Jenna ( who was really Julie) answered. <br />
&quot;Hello Ms. Belle, is Jules home?&quot; Asked Shannon. &quot;Oh he stepped out for a moment but he&#39;ll be back soon, your welcome to come in and wait for him if you want to&quot;. <br />
&quot;Okay thanks!&quot; Said Shannon. She came in and sat down on the couch and began going over her notes, Julie offered her one of the cupcakes, Shannon accepted the cupcake and ate it down rather quick, it had a strange taste to it but was very addicting to. <br />
Julie watched as Shannon got more sleepy and sleepy with every moment, Shannon looked over at Julie and started to feel attracted to her the sleepier she got. Julie got up and went over to Shannon, she slowly laid her down and undressed her, Then she undressed herself and got onto the couch with Shannon. Julie carefully got ontop of Shannon. Shannon daizily looked at Julie, she gave Shannon a reasuring smile as she kissed her on the lips. For some reason when Shannon looked into Julie&#39;s eyes, she recognized who she really was. &quot;Jules? Is that you&quot;? She faintly asked. Julie nodded. &quot;Shhh, just relax Shannon, I&#39;m giving you what youve always wanted.&quot; The cupcake was messing with Shannon&#39;s mind making her okay with what was about to happen. &quot; Okay, I trust you.&quot; Said Shannon and she reached up and kissed Julie as Julie began moving her body against Shannon&#39;s. <br />
Jenna watched from the top of the steps as Julie and Shannon made love on the couch. Shannon&#39;s arms were wrapped around Julie&#39;s body and her head was over Julie&#39;s shoulder, her eyes were closed and her mouth was open in pleasure. Jenna could see Shannon&#39;s body growing underneath Julie&#39;s body. Her arms grew longer against Julie&#39;s back and her hands grew bigger while her fingers grew longer and dainty. Shannon&#39;s moans grew deeper and more womanly. Jenna watched as Shannon&#39;s head grew, her facial bones started to reconstruct themselves. Her nose get a little smaller and a tiny bit less rounded. The fat on her face reduce greatly as the bones rearranged to sharpen her face. Her cheekbones and jawline became more pronounced. Her lips got slightly thinner and her eyes narrowed some. Finally both women began to orgasm at the same time. As they both calmed down Julie slowly got off of Shannon revealing a now mature woman the same age as Julie and Jenna. Shannon&#39;s body was much bigger, her breast that she had just started devoloping were now full D cups. <br />
Her body was filled out into a hot mature woman&#39;s body. Shannon looked down at her grown body and smiled looking up at Julie. <br />
&quot;Thank you Jules..er..Julie.&quot; Shannon said with a smile. &quot;This is what I truly want!&quot; She got up and Kissed Julie right on the lips. &quot;I love you!&quot; Said Shannon. &quot;I love you too!&quot; Said Julie. <br />
<br />
3 Months later....<br />
<br />
Jenna sat at her kitchen table, positively glowing, as she watched Julie<br />
and Shannon walk hand in hand, smiling and chattering, on their way to the<br />
den to watch a &quot;chick flick.&quot;  She reached out and took her lover&#39;s hand,<br />
lifted it to her lips and kissed it tenderly. the ring on her lover&#39;s<br />
finger always drew her eye, and she kissed that too.<br />
    &quot;I love you, my Gypsy Queen,&quot; she sighed, obviously meaning every word.<br />
    &quot;You&#39;ll make me blush, corazon,&quot; the dark woman said.<br />
    From where Jenna sat, both her lover&#39;s pretty smile, and all their<br />
futures, looked bright and lovely, like the snow outside their cozy home.</p>
