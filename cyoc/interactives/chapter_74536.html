<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><p>Jen watched dark clouds sail across the stars.  She lay on her side, her body curled around Wantross's under his heavy gray cloak, his hand trapped between her thighs.  She sighed happily and ran her fingers across the muscles of his back, and down to squeeze his butt.  He murmured something in his sleep and rubbed his thumb across her pubic stubble.  She gasped as his fingers tightened on her inner thigh, his thumb brushing back across her mons and moving down toward her clit.  She held her breath, and he slowly drifted into deeper slumber. She could feel her pussy growing wet from even so brief a touch. She breathed deeply, inhaling his musky odor, now mingling with her own.</p>

<p>They'd made love all afternoon, pausing only to pull the cloak over themselves during a brief rain shower.  Wantross had shown her more positions, more sensations, and given her more orgasms than she'd ever known before. Jen snuggled closer and frowned as her breasts shifted.  She wasn't positive, but they felt bigger to her. Heavier certainly, her neck and back were sore from them bouncing around as they'd fucked.</p>

<p><i>What had he said the stuff he spread on her was for? Marital chaffing?</i>  She moaned softly as he snorted and began moving his hand again, his thumb sliding easily between her slickened pussy lips and catching on the folds within. That was another thing, she'd always been pleased that even when aroused nothing of hers hung out like a boy's junk, but around dusk she'd looked down and been shocked to see not just her clit sticking out but a fringe of slick wet folds dangling from her swollen vulva. <i>Maybe it's just all the sex that's gotten me swollen.</i> she thought to herself.</p>

<p>Jen rolled onto her back as Wantross began pumping her loins gently with his thumb.  Her soft moans and panting rose in volume and pitch as the God worked his worshiper closer to orgasm.  She had proved most interesting.  Passionate, as water mages usually were, and more sexually demanding than the native humans of his world.  The ointment he'd applied had affected her even more strongly than it did the sowen who brewed it.  He smiled watching her swollen breasts bob up and down with the rhythm of his hand.  By morning the tenderness should be gone, aside from the love bites he'd given her.</p>

<p>His seed had been absorbed and was working its changes on her as well.  It had been some time since he'd made a human priestess.  Already she was taller, more muscular, more graceful and dexterous.  As a human he enjoyed powerful women, and his priestesses were all more than able to hold their own against the brigands and robbers that plagued travelers. He could feel his Godly magic mingling with her water magics.  She was untrained, but she could find a mortal teacher for that.  The woman's thighs closed on his fingers as she shuddered in the throes of another orgasm.  Her capacity for pleasure amazed him, only in some of the beast-kin had he experienced it's like.  She went limp, sated once again.  Wantross quirked his lips and wondered for how long?  If she weren't feeding him such intense devotion he'd have had to release this manifestation long before.  He draped the cloak over her cooling, sweat-speckled body and found her clothing in the dark.</p>

<p>So odd, this cloth and leather, metal and stones that had come into being as Jennifer exchanged places with a native woman of his world.  He'd felt the disturbance, though he hadn't understood what it meant.  It was enough to draw him to her at least.  Concentrating he reached into the stuff of magic and molded it to his will.  She'd need boots, a staff, something more covering than the cotton she'd arrived wearing.  A pack, cloak, and other gear soon followed.</p>

*     *     *

<p>Birdsong roused Jen before the sun had fully risen. She pulled Wantross's cloak around herself and stepped into the woods for privacy.  As she squatted by a tree she gently felt her breasts.  Definitely larger, her nipples too. She smiled, remembering some of the things her God had done to them the day and night before.  She guessed she could begrudge him more of what he'd enjoyed so well.  She finished and stood, looking at herself in the dappled morning light.  The stubble in her loins was growing in faster than natural. "Wantross must like his women hairy." Jen murmured.  Her mons and outer lips looked more pronounced, but nothing seemed to be hanging out now. She picked her way back to the clearing.</p>

<p>A neat pile of gear sat by the place where they'd slept.  Jenny examined everything, exclaiming happily over the bloused silk shirt, leggings, and blue leather boots.  "Wantross?  Where are you?" She looked around the clearing in confusion. She felt hands settle on her shoulders, much like yesterday, and leaned back.

<p>"Our time together, while sweet, must be cut short.  Some adherents of mine have summoned me to their aid, and I must go or be foresworn.  East of these woods is a road.  Take is south and you'll find a city in a marsh by a large freshwater lake.  Seek instruction there in water magics, and know I will always hear you."</p>

<p>Jen spun in place but the cloak, and her divine lover were gone.  She fought back a sudden tide of panic and calmed her breathing.  Wantross would preserve her, he'd sworn to that.  She got dressed, wishing there was some way to wash herself first, and set out towards the east,</p></p>
