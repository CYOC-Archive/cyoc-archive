<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Ok, this is clearly getting out of hand. I’ll call my… ah… supplier and see what he can do,” Gavin muttered, grabbing his phone with shaking hands. His heart raced as he walked into the house, glancing nervously at the chaotic scene in the backyard. The sleepover had devolved into something out of a fever dream, and it was only getting worse.<br />
Once inside, he stared at his phone, hesitating. Calling Dan was the last thing he wanted to do right now—Dan was already going to be furious. So would Andrew, for that matter. He swallowed hard, praying they wouldn’t involve his parents. As much as they’d be pissed about Gavin’s reckless behaviour, Dan and Andrew wouldn’t want to get in trouble either. After all, they were the ones who had inadvertently given him access to the experimental medication in the first place. Gavin was just hoping they’d keep it quiet.<br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
Half an hour later, after what felt like the most stressful phone call of his life, Gavin re-emerged from the house, looking a bit pale. The sight that greeted him outside was even worse than before. Myles had slid down from his own absurdly swollen balls and was now kneeling above Gus, who was lying on his back beneath him. Myles was wanking right above Gus&#39;s open mouth. The rest of the group, except for Samuel, were gathered around with erections at full-mast, chanting in unison, “Drink it all! Drink it all!”<br />
<br />
Gavin blinked in disbelief, his mind struggling to catch up. Just as he was about to demand an explanation, Myles let out a loud groan of orgasm and shoved his cock down Gus’s throat, pushing deep. Everyone watched, transfixed, as Gus’s belly began to rise and swell rapidly, inflating like a grotesque flesh-balloon. Myles kept cumming for what seemed like forever—two, maybe even three minutes of non-stop ejaculation—before finally collapsing in exhaustion and pulling his now limp cock free, pressed back against his nuts. <br />
<br />
Gus gasped, panting for air as he finally had space to breathe again. He was lying trapped under a belly swollen beyond belief. It had inflated so much that his belly button, once an innie, was now bulging outward like a painful, swollen knot. His distended stomach was covered in purple bruises and angry red stretch marks from the rapid expansion. His boyfriend stepped forward and wrapped his arms around Gus’s huge belly in a hug, though he couldn’t even reach halfway around it. As Aaron sunk down onto Gus&#39;s swollen belly, it gave way under Aaron’s weight but didn&#39;t collapse. Instead, it squeezed outward like a tight, overinflated balloon, creating an additional indentation in the middle of the belly where Aaron lay. The skin is stretched so thin they could see Myles’s cum sloshing around inside. The way the skin tightened and shifted as Aaron moved on top of it gave the impression that it might pop at any moment, but instead, it remained surprisingly firm and smooth, undulating slightly with each movement.<br />
<br />
“You did great, babes,” Aaron whispered, kissing Gus’s cheek. Despite his exhaustion, Gus managed a weak smile.<br />
Gavin, still stunned by what he was seeing, finally found his voice. “What the hell did you just do?” he demanded, looking at Myles.<br />
Myles, still catching his breath, grinned sheepishly. “We wanted to see what would happen if Gus drank as much of my cum as he could. After how his body changed just from drinking your load last night, curiosity got the better of us.”<br />
Gavin rolled his eyes. “Curiosity got the better of you?! How is he going to avoid being seen like this once he leaves tonight?”<br />
“Hey, you’re the one getting us the antidote,” Myles said with a shrug. “We figured we’d experiment a little while we wait.”<br />
Gavin groaned. “I didn’t say anything about an antidote! I just called someone who MIGHT know how to fix this. MIGHT!”<br />
Myles shrugged, “Well what happened then?”<br />
“I talked to Da- my supplier. After he freaked out for a bit, he agreed to contact the company that makes the pills. So now we just have to wait for them to call back.” He looked at Gus, whose belly was still grotesquely distended. “Hopefully that’ll be soon…”<br />
Gus patted his swollen body proudly, his breath labored but his tone light. “I’m not going anywhere. I’ve got nothing but time.”<br />
<br />
As the hours passed, Gus’s enormous belly began to shrink back as the cum was slowly absorbed into his body. Just like the night before, his butt expanded to compensate for the excess. His pecs swelled up too, though not as dramatically as before. Instead, something strange started happening to his nipples—they weren’t just getting bigger; they were growing outward like small protrusions. In fact, the group soon realized with a mix of awe and horror that Gus’s nipples were developing into cocks. Thick, veiny, and dripping with precum, just like his original one.<br />
<br />
By noon, Gus had fully absorbed all of Myles&#39;s cum and back on his feet. His stomach was back to being flat and toned with a chiselled six-pack. However, his skin, now tight along his muscles, were still ravaged by the stretch marks and bruising caused by the rapid expansion earlier. His oversized buttocks now jiggled with every step, giving him an exaggerated hourglass figure. His pecs were huge, round, and impossibly firm, looking like they belonged to a man who had spent months doing nothing but chest exercises at the gym. But the most bizarre transformation of all were his nipple-cocks—each about six inches long, jutting out from his chest and leaking precum like they had a mind of their own.<br />
“What do they feel like?” Oscar asked as he watched his mate exploring his new body.<br />
“Honestly, you know the feeling of being super horny after waking up with extreme morning wood? That, but three times as much.” Gus replied, slowly rubbing each nipple-cock out of horny frustration.<br />
Aaron and the twins were unable to resist their own curiosity. They sat Gus down in a chair, and claimed one of his cocks each. The twins immediately latched onto his nipple-cocks, giving blowjobs to the strange appendages. Aaron knelt between his boyfriend’s legs, his lips wrapping around the original cock.<br />
<br />
It didn’t take long before all three cocks erupted in unison, spraying cum onto the eager faces of the three boys. Gus groaned in pleasure, overwhelmed by the intensity of his multiple orgasms. As the last drops of cum dribbled from Gus’s three cocks, the twins and Aaron sat back, wiping their faces with a dazed satisfaction. Gus slumped into the chair, panting, the weight of his swollen pecs pulling his body forward slightly. He gave his nipple-cocks a tentative squeeze, shuddering as the sensation was disturbingly intense. They now drooped down half-flaccid against the top of his abs, mirroring his real cock that was now resting on his balls. <br />
<br />
Not everyone was as enthralled. A few members of the group turned away in disgust, their discomfort evident with this overt display of sexuality. While the strange transformations had pushed them beyond the boundaries of normalcy, going full homo seemed to be their limit. Gavin, watching with Myles on top of his balls, chewed his lip in frustration. This was all spiraling out of control fast. His phone vibrated against his naked thigh and he quickly picked it up, checking the screen. It was a message from Dan.<br />
<br />
***Got a hold of the company. Call me ASAP.***<br />
<br />
Gavin’s heart skipped a beat. He slipped down to the lawn and waddled away from the group, dialing Dan’s number, anxiety creeping up his spine. The phone barely rang once before Dan picked up.<br />
“Gavin,” Dan’s voice was sharp, a mixture of anger and urgency. “This is bad. Really bad.”<br />
Gavin looked back at the group, where the twins were still teasing Gus’s nipple-cocks, giving them gentle tugs and licks.<br />
“No kidding,” He hissed into the phone, glancing nervously back at the group. “My friend has cocks for nipples now. It’s getting worse.” <br />
“Yeah, well, the company finally gave me the details. That stuff you took—it&#39;s a prototype bio-enhancement serum. Not cleared for human trials, not even close. They were developing it for… certain clients with, uh, unusual requests. But they’re nowhere near controlling the side effects, which you’ve clearly discovered.”<br />
Gavin ran a hand through his hair, his heart pounding. “Please tell me they have a cure.”<br />
“They claim they’re working on something,” Dan said, his tone grim. “But it’s not ready yet. You have to promise me you and your friends aren’t still taking the pills. If you keep messing around, it’s going to get way out of control. We’re talking irreversible changes.”<br />
Gavin’s stomach dropped. “How long until the company has a cure?”<br />
“Could be months,” Dan replied. “Maybe longer.”<br />
“Months?!!”<br />
“Unfortunately science isn’t magic Gavin.”  <br />
Gavin swore under his breath. “Alright. What do we do until then? We’re not exactly presentable to the world?”<br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
After a long, disheartening conversation, the call ended, leaving a naked Gavin standing there, phone in hand, heart pounding. He looked back at the group, a pit forming in his stomach. This had started as some stupid game, and now they might be permanent freaks.<br />
He walked back to the group, his mind racing for a solution. Myles noticed him first, flashing a lazy grin. “Good news?”<br />
Gavin sighed, shaking his head. “No. The company’s still working on a fix, and it definitely won’t be ready for school tomorrow.<br />
“This is insane,” Samuel cried out, struggling to drag his balls with him as he tried to return to the group from his spot near the back door. His face was pale. &quot;We need to stop. This is too much. We’ve crossed lines that... I don’t know if we can come back from.&quot;<br />
Gavin nodded, wiping his brow with the back of his hand. &quot;You&#39;re not wrong—&quot; he paused, glancing at Gus&#39;s absurdly enhanced body, &quot;—things might get worse before they get better. But the company is working on something. The problem is, it’s not ready for a while.&quot;<br />
“What do you mean not ready?” Roy asked concerned.<br />
“I mean,” Gavin sighed, running a hand through his hair, “we might be stuck like this for longer than we want. Weeks, maybe months. They’re working on neutralizing the effects, but they don’t have a time frame. Until then, they’ve advised us to keep things calm. Any extreme stimulation could—”<br />
Gavin didn’t need to finish his sentence. Everyone&#39;s eyes turned toward Gus, his nipple-cocks still twitching slightly from the earlier action.<br />
&quot;We’re... supposed to stay calm?&quot; Samuel laughed in a panic. What are our parents going to think?”<br />
“Yours might have to know, but Aaron, Roy, Oscar and myself can hide our changes well enough that ours won’t be the wiser, right?” Axel suggested. <br />
“No, I have had enough. Screw you guys, I’m going home.” Samuel said rushing to the door as fast as his exercise ball-sized nuts would let him.<br />
<br />
Phil, Gavin and Neal tried to get him to reconsider, but his mind was made up. After a quick shower, he put his clothes back on, covered his balls in a blanket the best he could as start walking home. The rest watched nervously as he left, knowing full well that it was time to contact their parents.</p>
