<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Harri was taken aback by the formerly straight man&#39;s eagerness. Still, with Harpinder&#39;s muscular arm around his neck, their faces so close together, feeling the hot air escape his plump lips with every breath. It was difficult for Harri to resist, not that he was trying very hard. No, this was the kind of experiment he wanted. &quot;If you&#39;re sure...&quot;<br />
<br />
Harri closed his eye and leaned forward. Harpinder dove into the kiss. Their soft lips cushioned each other as their tongues locked. Harri suddenly felt weak and practically melted into Harpinder&#39;s kiss. He had to grab onto the gold chain around Harpinder&#39;s neck to keep himself from falling away from their kiss. This weakness was at once new and familiar. The sensation of pleasure only his boyfriend could bring.<br />
<br />
It didn&#39;t take long for Harri to feel something hard brush against his leg. The elastic material of Harpinder&#39;s athletic shorts left nothing to the imagination when his larger and thicker cock pitched a huge tent. Harri&#39;s eyebrows shot up, impressed with his boyfriend&#39;s size. &quot;Someone&#39;s excited&quot;. Though Harri would be lying if he said he didn&#39;t feel the same way. His pants were just better at hiding it.<br />
<br />
&quot;For some reason I got so riled up while I was out. No idea why&quot; Harpinder admitted.<br />
<br />
&quot;If you get this horny while jogging, it&#39;s not wonder why you&#39;re always working out&quot; Harri teased.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, don&#39;t pretend like you don&#39;t like the results&quot; Harpinder flexed his bulging bicep. There was his typical flirty attitude, except this time Harri didn&#39;t find it obnoxious, it was rather charming. Perhaps it was because these comments were now accompanied by a muscular hunk. While admiring Harpinder&#39;s raised arm, he noticed the hairy pit below. He leaned in lightly to inspect it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come, Dear, take a closer look&quot; Harpinder grinned and grabbed the back of Harri&#39;s turban, shoving the smaller man&#39;s face into his pit.<br />
<br />
&quot;No! Harp! Stop!&quot; Harri&#39;s cries were muffled with his mouth pressed against the thick bush. After a few seconds he couldn&#39;t hold his breath. &quot;Hm?&quot; The BO hit his nose, but it wasn&#39;t the fowl smell he expected. It wasn&#39;t bad. He took a second whiff. &quot;Mmm&quot; No, it was bad. But bad in a good way. Harpinder didn&#39;t need to hold Harri&#39;s head against him any more, Harri did that himself now.<br />
<br />
Harri prodded his nose deep into the absolutely drenched pit, looking for the moistest spot. The musk would hit his brain with a shock, making his dick pulse with every deep inhale. As soon as he was done with one spot, his nose would move to the next moistest. Each time his curly mustache and beard would sponge up sweat. By the time he was done, his beard was just as drenched in sweat as the pit, and the lingering musk was enough to keep his member twitching.<br />
<br />
Harpinder stripped off his muscle shirt, displaying his beefy body. &quot;Now I&#39;m not the only one who&#39;s excited.&quot; He placed his hand on top of Harri&#39;s turban and gently pushed his head down. Harri instinctually put his tongue out and licked between Harpinder&#39;s hairy pecs, then slid down to his cut abs, until he was eye level with the larger sardar&#39;s crotch. Harri could smell that this was one of the more potent sources of BO on his boyfriend&#39;s body. Greedily, he pulled down Harpinder&#39;s shorts and boxer briefs, and enjoyed a breath of the musk that was contained within.<br />
<br />
Harpinder&#39;s long brown uncut cock was pointing right at Harri, inviting him closer. He pulled back the foreskin to reveal the beautiful head, and his hand seemed small in comparison. Even for a 6&#39; 3&quot; Punjabi, it seemed disproportionately big. He nursed the dark head in his thick pink lips, the sensation eliciting a deep grunt from his boyfriend. &quot;Yes Dearr, take eet&quot; Harpinder pumped into Harri&#39;s mouth, more of his light accent escaping. As soon as the pubes his his nose, Harri sprang to action. Bobbing his head back and forth, his soft mustache grazing his lover&#39;s dick, with his wet beard fondling Harpinder&#39;s balls. Harpinder was in a wet heaven, &quot;Oh, Waheguru&quot; he called to God with Harri&#39;s tongue exploring his every inch.<br />
<br />
Harri could tell his boyfriend&#39;s throbbing wood was close. He nuzzled into Harpinder&#39;s pubes for one last good suck before pulling his mouth away. Harpinder moaned with the accented vibrato of a Bollywood singer while he shot strings of cum onto the smaller Sikh&#39;s turban and face. Harri took a pause to enjoy the salty smell on him, before unraveling his turban and using the cloth to wipe the cum off his face. Harpinder caught his breath and returned to speaking in his lighter accent, &quot;Good idea, Dear, let&#39;s let our hair loose&quot;. Harpinder reached for his turban but Harri grabbed his wrist.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, don&#39;t take it off&quot; Harri didn&#39;t want to risk Harpinder reverting to Harvey now, &quot;My gift looks so sexy on you. Let&#39;s keep having fun with it on.&quot; He undid his hair bun, letting his long curls flow down.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, I&#39;ll keep it on for your turn.&quot; Harpinder winked.<br />
<br />
&quot;My turn?&quot; It was one thing for Harpinder to get his dick sucked, but Harri didn&#39;t think the formerly straight man would be ready to return the favor so soon. Harpinder unbuttoned Harris&#39;s shirt, practically tearing it off, so he could push Harri into his bed. Laying on his back, Harri looked down to see Harpinder lick his lips and pull off Harri&#39;s pants and underwear. Harri mentally prepared for his boyfriend&#39;s mouth around his already hard cock, but was socked to feel Harpinder spread his ass cheeks.<br />
<br />
Harpinder buried his face into Harri&#39;s ass and licked his hole with frenzy. Harri tightly gripped his bed to keep from squirming helplessly. The way the manly Sardar&#39;s tongue and beard tickled his sensitive hole with such delight, he couldn&#39;t contain his moans. He looked down again and locked with Harpinder&#39;s charming eyes. Already being so horned up, it was enough to send him over the edge, cumming onto his own stomach.<br />
Harpinder chuckled, clearly satisfied with his work. He grabbed Harri&#39;s already cum soaked turban and used it to clean up the twink&#39;s stomach, then threw it in the hamper and climbed into Harri&#39;s bed. &quot;Sounds like you were having fun&quot; Harpinder played with Harri&#39;s curls.<br />
<br />
&quot;That was amazing...&quot; Harri said in a breathy voice, still panting.<br />
<br />
&quot;We should shower up. Who should go first? Or should we hop in together~?&quot;<br />
<br />
Harri giggled, &quot;You&#39;re so bad. Let&#39;s just cuddle for a little bit.&quot; He pulled Harpinder&#39;s muscular arm around him and pushed his back against his boyfriend&#39;s strong chest. Exhausted, the pair were slowly lulled to sleep.<br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
The next morning Harri woke up to Harpinder&#39;s arm still around him. He turned around in bed, expecting both of the to be squished in his tiny dorm bed, but there was actually a good amount of space for both of them. He then looked to where he expected Harvey&#39;s bed to be, but it was gone. He now realized why his bed seemed bigger. His and Harpinder&#39;s bed frames were next to each other, topped with a larger mattress that covered both. His memories told him that he and Harpinder bought the bigger mattress together when their application to live in the same dorm was approved. Harri wondered if the pride turban had changed anything else about reality.<br />
<br />
Thinking of the turban, he saw it was still wrapped around Harpinder&#39;s head. Apparently he tied it right enough to survive both working out and sleeping. Although, it was much looser now than yesterday. Harri considered that he could tell Harpinder to tighten it and wear it the rest of the day. It would be nice to spend another day with his new boyfriend. A small, guilty part of him told him to let the loose turban fall off and let Harvey return to normal. Another part of him wondered how he could experiment with transforming Harpinder next.<br />
<br />
&quot;Harri?&quot; Harpinder barely opened his eyes, still sleepy &quot;Good morning, Dear.&quot; He smiled, holding Harri closer. &quot;Man, I didn&#39;t shower after working out and our fun last night. I must REEK!&quot;<br />
<br />
Harri needed to decide what he would tell Harpinder to do with the turban.</p>
