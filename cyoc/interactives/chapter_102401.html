<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">At the bottom of the Stovall family pool, Eric and Julie continued to enjoy themselves very much. Eric did his best to remember what his father advised with regard to pleasuring Julie as they continued. He had no idea how long they had been at it, but he did know that it was marvelous. The feel of Julie&#39;s breasts, soft yet firm, and the feel of her webbed hands on his back, as if to hold him to her was wonderful. In fact, Eric found that as Julie moved her hands, she rubbed against a series of slits along his back that made him breathe in deeply.  It was in those moments when he fully recognized that he had gills and was even more surprised that they were actually an erogenous zone on his body. It made him moan heavily as he continued to thrust his new and larger member into Julie&#39;s very wet opening.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ohhhh... Eric... keep...&quot; Julie moaned beneath him, &quot;keep goooooooooooo...&quot;<br />
<br />
Eric softly moved down to softly nibble on her neck and felt his girlfriend shudder as she had another orgasm. He was getting close to erupting into her again as well.  He wasn&#39;t experienced with regard to sex in any sense of the word. Just like Julie, before today, he had been a virgin. And while at times he felt like the two of them were going about their love making somewhat clumsily, it was still a wonderful sensation as Julie&#39;s vagina gripped his new merman penis firmly and even tenderly and yet both of them could both just keep going and going and going. It was like weres had an incredibly high sexual stamina and presently he was greatly enjoying it. It felt good to be with her, to pleasure her, and make her happy. Then after a few moments, he moaned again and felt his penis twitch inside Julie&#39;s opening and he gave a heavy moan as he orgasmed again.<br />
<br />
After that, though, he finally collapsed onto her and the two of them began cuddle on the pool&#39;s tile. He smiled to Julie and held her to him. It had been a wonderful day and a wonderful event and he loved it and he loved her.<br />
<br />
&quot;And here we are,&quot; Eric said softly to her as they cuddled, his penis rapidly softening and retracting back into the vent in his tail.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Julie smiled back as she felt her own vaginal vent, which protected her vagina while in her full weremermaid form, &quot;Together forever.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d like to think we&#39;d be that way regardless of what I became,&quot; Eric said to her with a smile that never left his face as he looked to her. Her whole body seemed to be glowing with a bright light, like she was some angel from heaven to love him forever.<br />
<br />
&quot;We probably would,&quot; Julie answered, &quot;I&#39;d love you and want you with me regardless of what kind of were you became... but I am unbelievably happy you decided to be a merman... MY merman.&quot;<br />
<br />
The two shared a soft and loving kiss for a moment before Eric rolled onto his back to look up at the surface of the pool. He marveled at how well his eyes worked or were working now under water. Now, it wasn&#39;t as though he couldn&#39;t see underwater before. The human eye would be able to function so long as there was sufficient light for the retina to catch. The trouble though, was that the human eye couldn&#39;t easily tolerate water or rather the sediments or chemicals IN the water, and thus when a human opened their eyes under water, they had trouble. That was why humans invented goggles, not to make it possible to see underwater, as the eye could theoretically do that on its own, but but that the goggles prevented the irritation to the eye and thus allowed the eye to function as designed. As a merman, though, it felt as though there was a hard lens, maybe a clear scale that covered his eyes and worked like a natural set of goggles that enabled him to see.<br />
<br />
And the things he saw were wonderful, namely Julie&#39;s glowing form next to him, though that puzzled him a bit. She wasn&#39;t glowing before his transformation... was she?<br />
<br />
&quot;You look positively radiant,&quot; Eric said to her after a moment, &quot;Practically glowing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;To you now, of course I am,&quot; Julie smiled knowingly and giggled as Eric raised an eyebrow in confusion, &quot;Remember what I said about weremers being able to see who their true love is at first sight?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh-huh,&quot; Eric answered, &quot;it lead you to me and lead to... to this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, you ARE a mer now,&quot; Julie giggled, &quot;you&#39;re seeing me with a merman&#39;s eyes and using the &quot;love at first sight ability&quot; for the first time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But this isn&#39;t the first time we&#39;ve seen each other,&quot; Eric blinked his now permanently blue eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;True,&quot; Julie nodded, &quot;but like your father&#39;s bond to your mother as a werefox... our true love at first sight ability never goes away. When I saw you... your body glowed with the light of your soul and your love. You still glow with that light... now more firmly than ever.&quot;<br />
<br />
Julie leaned over to him, &quot;And now, my handsome merman... you can see that I glow for you.&quot;<br />
<br />
The two hugged and enjoyed a passionate, though this time brief kiss.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, what do you think about the new you?&quot; Julie asked to Eric.<br />
<br />
The two rose a bit from the bottom of the pool, though staying deep enough that neither would be seen above the water&#39;s surface at any point in the pool. Eric found his movement underwater being perfectly natural as his tail slowly and effectively moved up and down to propel him forward. In a way it was an odd sensation and didn&#39;t quite feel the way one would think if they had seen his legs fuse into his new tail. Some might think that Eric would still have his leg bones, but simply wrapped in his tail&#39;s skin and muscle, sort of like the mermaid/merman costumes that had been made where the legs were held together in a wrapping.  Eric didn&#39;t feel that though, and in fact he remembered that as he changed, he could feel his hips and leg bones painlessly change and reshape. His hip bones altered to better suit a creature that didn&#39;t have legs and his leg bones merged and split until they resembled more an extension of his spine rather than legs. It made his tail very flexible and allowed him to even wrap his tail around Julie&#39;s a bit while they were mating. It was all interesting to him, but from what he&#39;d seen with his parents and his brother, when they assured him that their own transformations weren&#39;t painful it gave Eric some confidence that his own transformation wouldn&#39;t be painful. And it wasn&#39;t painful.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know... when we moved here and all the stuff related to Moon Lake being populated by were-beasts had me stressed and nervous,&quot; Eric admitted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Like a guppy in a fishhook factory,&quot; Julie commented, &quot;and why I wanted you see that despite what you might have thought about weres... we aren&#39;t bad. We&#39;re just like normals... but with a few extras.&quot;<br />
<br />
Eric nodded, &quot;And you did a wonderful job. You helped me get through a lot of things.&quot;<br />
<br />
Julie watched as Eric suddenly accelerated and began swimming around her, going in front and behind her as she swam along and then above and below her, smiling as he went.<br />
<br />
&quot;And now here I am,&quot; Eric answered, &quot;A were... after all the nervousness I had about weres... I AM one.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And what do you think about that?&quot; Julie asked, though she had a sense of what the answer would be.<br />
<br />
Eric settled into a position below her and held her to him. He stared into her blue eyes as she stared into his and they simply held each other.<br />
<br />
&quot;I love it,&quot; Eric said with a smile, &quot;I love being a were... I love being a mer... I love being with you... I LOVE YOU!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh... Eric,&quot; Julie only smiled and hugged him. She felt joy radiate out of every pore in her skin and every scale on her tail.<br />
<br />
And Eric did love it. His transformation had brought about many developments that aside from being with Julie fascinated him and he made mental notes on how things had changed for him as he breathed in Julie&#39;s mermaid scent and ran his webbed fingers through her hair. He relished Julie&#39;s scent. Yes, it smelled rather like fish, thanks to her tail, but underwater and his own mer tastes, it was a wonderful and enticing smell. He figured his own scent mirrored Julies or maybe more like her father&#39;s, since Julie was female and Eric knew he was still decidedly male. <br />
<br />
And with his mind also grasping the abilities and even culture of weremers thanks to his transformation, he did know that weremers in many ways were a combination of many of the other aquatic weres thanks to the fact that unlike other weres that became a full fusion of human and animal, Eric and Julie had very little change in the upper parts of their body while the most obvious changes was only with the lower part of their bodies. It allowed for them to gain excellent underwater vision, similar to various fish and marine mammals, a lateral line similar to sharks, and a shark&#39;s sense of smell (above and below water). His hearing may not have improved, at least outside of a more waterproof eardrum that allowed him to more clearly hear things underwater, but he gained a lot in his other senses. <br />
<br />
His ability to talk under water was more related to his new gills. Humans couldn&#39;t talk under water effectively because their vocal cords were designed to vibrate air pushed over them from the lungs. If water got into the lungs, a human would drown, and when they tried to talk, air in the lungs would push against the water trying to rush in creating bubbles, which made understanding it rather difficult as the bubbles obscured anything that was said. As a merman, though, Eric didn&#39;t have that problem. When Julie had pulled him under after their first coupling of the day, he had simply let his windpipe open and let his lungs fill with water. Muscles in his diaphragm then pushed the water out through his gills on his back, allowing him to breathe and talk underwater. Since no air was pushing against the water, a rush of bubbles didn&#39;t obscure what Eric tried to say when he talked and his vocal cords had altered to make them capable of vibrating the water that passed over them as well as the air when above water.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you,&quot; Eric said to Julie as they swam together holding each other in an embrace, &quot;thank you for everything you done for me. Helping me get used to Moon Lake... comforting me when Yvette was on a rampage... for loving me... and transforming me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re welcome, my love,&quot; Julie answered, &quot;though... you don&#39;t need to thank me. I love you. Everything I did and have done... is because I love you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know,&quot; Eric nodded, &quot;but it feels right and polite to say thank you.&quot;<br />
<br />
They swam along quietly for a while before Eric commented on something.<br />
<br />
&quot;So how do we clean up after this?&quot; Eric wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm?&quot; Julie wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;The pool, how will we clean it?&quot; Eric asked, &quot;the water smells like we had sex in it all day.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Pretty much what we did,&quot; Julie giggled pressing her bosom into Eric&#39;s chest, &quot;but not all of the scent of sex is us...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What...?&quot; Eric asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can smell some hints of my dad and my mom in here too,&quot; Julie nodded, &quot;and they love each other, just as we do... and like any married were... having sex with their chosen partner or true love is something that they enjoy...&quot;<br />
<br />
Eric felt some stirrings in his tail rise again, though he managed a deep breath and let things go back down.<br />
<br />
&quot;And in time we&#39;ll enjoy,&quot; Eric smiled, &quot;though...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You are my true love, and I told you, my mom was in on the plan,&quot; Julie spoke, &quot;I&#39;m still on the pill and will be. But neither of us broke our promises.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Eric nodded, &quot;but... our parents will still be parents... Mom and dad... they seemed clingy and a mix of proud and nervous all at the same time. I didn&#39;t know what to make of it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They probably saw that our love was growing firmly... beautifully,&quot; Julie smiled, &quot;and that you were becoming ready to become Moon Lake&#39;s most handsome merman...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;With its most beautiful mermaid,&quot; Eric smiled to her, &quot;but I&#39;d think... that... at least until we&#39;re a bit older... we aren&#39;t too active. You know, just to assure our folks that we&#39;re thinking things through and that we aren&#39;t letting ourselves turn into some kind of sex addict.&quot;<br />
<br />
Julie nodded in agreement with that. The marathon of sex they&#39;d just had was worth all the pain of it at first, but she did agree that there was more to life than what went on between the sheets. Though, as she came to realize as she and Eric made love to each other, that much of the whole were libido thing was very real. It may not have felt like too much of a pull when Eric was still a normal or before she even knew about her true love, but she could feel it there now and that pull was strong. A good part of her was even ready to simply start another session with him, even though just swimming and talking felt so nice. Keeping things under control would take some effort.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; Julie spoke, &quot;though... we&#39;re going to feel that pull... just as my parents feel it and just as your parents feel it with each other.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Eric agreed, &quot;it&#39;s like becoming weres has been great for my family... It&#39;s something Nate wanted ever since he figured out what werewolves were. And while my mom and dad were taking steps to get over my dad&#39;s past... and he&#39;s even also tried to make it clear to Nate and I that he didn&#39;t want us repeating his mistakes, even before his transformation... but their transformation into weres seemed to accelerate everything between them. And now... it&#39;s cemented my union with you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That last bit is the best part,&quot; Julie smiled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Though... I do wonder what&#39;s really lead to weres being... well... so built for sex,&quot; Eric commented, &quot;My dad was never unfit or ugly, but becoming a werefox... he&#39;s toned... looks practically like he could get a job as a male model... and when Yvette got caught and carried off and you called to invite us to dinner with your folks... I came downstairs, and he and my mom were very nearly... doing what we were just doing... and I could see his... well... it was huge...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re bigger now than you were,&quot; Julie giggled playfully.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know,&quot; Eric chuckled, &quot;but that isn&#39;t the only thing. I mean... my mom was always beautiful... but the things that made her beautiful before are more pronounced. She looks younger... her hips are wider, her bust is bigger... and that seems to go for all the female weres I&#39;ve seen... you start at large and go to enormous.&quot;<br />
<br />
Julie only chuckled a bit at that, as she did figure that he was making a bit of a joke, though she did also know that a female were&#39;s smallest bust size was a D cup and several other were females were bigger than that. Her own mother was an E cup, and Eric&#39;s mother looked to be about the same size, and the adult werevixens that Julie had met were even bigger.<br />
<br />
&quot;That will depend on your theory for where were-beasts get their origins,&quot; Julie answered, &quot;those who believe we&#39;re entirely a magic based creature comment that whoever created the were-curse/enchantment had a bit of a perverted streak in him or her... those who believe in a more scientific explanation think it&#39;s more of a biological need to reproduce. If we&#39;re not killed, we can and will live for a very long time, but weres aren&#39;t impervious to being killed by something... A predatory were, like your parents and brother could be killed by either what they&#39;re hunting or bigger predators. And a weremer could be eaten by a shark or predatory whale at sea. So... from an evolutionary standpoint... weres would need a high libido and attractive forms to help keep a birthrate up to keep around even if members are killed.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hm...&quot; Eric commented, &quot;that makes some sense... lots of animals have adaptations designed to help preserve their species. I suppose weres aren&#39;t that different.&quot;<br />
<br />
Julie nodded.<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Melissa Stovall was pulling her car into the garage after a long day. Upgrading the High School&#39;s computers was harder than expected, but the systems did get put in and were upgraded. Most of the wiring that had gone in was more to help upgrade the school&#39;s internet connection to something that would be more high speed and being able to handle a heavier workload. Some of the stresses, between mice eating part of the equipment installed over the summer, flat tires, and missing parts had lengthened the work, but in the end, the got every thing done. That allowed her to make it home by three forty five PM. They&#39;d finished the work earlier than that, but that didn&#39;t reduce the time it took to drive home. She climbed out of her car and looked across the garage, and then sighed. Martin&#39;s car wasn&#39;t there where it was supposed to be. It often wasn&#39;t when she normally came home as Martin&#39;s work schedule commonly didn&#39;t allow him to come home prior to six PM. The other day when he was able to come home early and they enjoyed an afternoon of passionate weremer sex was a rarity given Martin&#39;s schedules. Most of their time together was normally at night and in bed, though not that she minded that. It was just that after her transformation, there was just something about being in water with Martin that felt even better.<br />
<br />
But Martin wasn&#39;t at work. He was either on the way to California or was in California to deal with his mother and her injury. He had left her a few text messages that essentially said &quot;I luv u. I miss u.&quot; She couldn&#39;t wait for him to come home. However, that wasn&#39;t really the thing that was on her agenda, but to find out how the plan for the day for Julie and Eric had gone. She had wanted Julie to wait until she was eighteen, but she also wanted Julie to be happy and not be tormented by a true love making mistakes. She mentally berated herself countless times for having her questions, concerns, and worries over her relationship with Martin that had made him wait ten years. Once she became Martin&#39;s weremermaid, she&#39;d found happiness that she could never even imagine, and even more joy when Julie was born. But she made Martin wait before being with her and showing her how happy she could be. And regardless of how many times Martin had told her that he didn&#39;t matter that much as it didn&#39;t change his love, and they had still had plenty of happy dates during this time, Melissa still felt that she had deprived him of the love and joy that both of them had felt since their wedding night. She didn&#39;t want Julie to go through that, and while she was young, she had found her true love, and Melissa&#39;s primary goal for her daughter was to be unbelievably happy. It wouldn&#39;t matter if Eric became a weremerman today, so long as Julie was happy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Julie! I&#39;m home,&quot; Melissa called as she entered the Stovall home.<br />
<br />
There was no answer, in fact, Melissa didn&#39;t hear much of anything going on in the house. No television, no music, and no conversation was heard at the moment. She couldn&#39;t quite say that they weren&#39;t in though. While weremers might have better senses under water than other weres did, her hearing overall wasn&#39;t as sharp as other weres were. Most of this related to the auditory properties of water.  Water molecules were closer together than air molecules were and thus allowed softer sounds to carry faster through water than they would through the air. Thus the super sensitive ears that other weres had wasn&#39;t needed for weremers, and might even be a detriment while underwater.<br />
<br />
She quietly made her way through the house, and at first wanted to check upstairs in case they were in Julie&#39;s room. However, she found she didn&#39;t need to get that far. In the living room, she found Eric&#39;s duffel bag. Inside it she could see what looked like a pair of dress pants and shoes as the bag sat open on the Stovall family couch. Laying across the back of the couch was a pair of jeans, a tee shirt, a pair of socks, and Star Wars themed boxers. Melissa noted that and shrugged.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... a sci-fi fan,&quot; Melissa chuckled, &quot;so I suppose the wedding night will be a debate of Luke Skywalker versus Legolas in terms of pitting the main hero of the Star Wars original trilogy versus Julie&#39;s favorite character from &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; trilogy. &quot;But... this probably means they went swimming at some point.&quot;<br />
<br />
With that, Melissa turned and moved to head toward the backyard and the pool. She opened the door and walked out into a quiet atmosphere, which wasn&#39;t entirely what was expected. Normals and other weres weren&#39;t strangers to pools, Melissa knew that. They didn&#39;t have the risk of poisoning from Chlorine the way weremers and weresharks were, thanks to their gills, so they did commonly go to public pools. And Melissa even remembered once having to check on a laptop&#39;s wi-fi signal at the lake once for a family of wererats and found the children playing in the lake with a couple of werecats, all in human form, while they waited. However, because they still had to breathe air, they couldn&#39;t stay submerged for long. With Eric being a normal the last she&#39;d met the teen, he&#39;d need to be near the surface to breathe.<br />
<br />
&quot;Unless...&quot; Melissa mused and crossed one of the deck tables and noticed a lone cellphone sitting on the desk. A lone green light was flashing to indicate that there was a message on the phone, and Melissa assumed it was Eric&#39;s. She then noticed a pair of wet swim trunks laying on the deck chair by the desk and on top of a beach towel As she came closer to the edge of the pool she found one of Julie&#39;s bikinis laying on the tile.<br />
<br />
&quot;Unless he isn&#39;t a normal,&quot; Melissa whispered, as tears of joy for her daughter&#39;s happiness came before she could stop them, &quot;unless he&#39;s a weremer.&quot;<br />
<br />
Her approach to the edge of the pool confirmed it. Swimming in leisurely circles in the deeper part of the pool and well submerged were two weremers, one a merman with a striking blue-green tail that through the water seemed to glisten brightly. The other was a female with the bright orange colored scales of a goldfish on her tail. Both of them weren&#39;t fully mature, as  Melissa could easily see that the female wasn&#39;t as long as Melissa was in her mer form, and this made it clear that this was Eric and Julie.  Both of them, though were close and enamored with each other. To get their attention, she simply bent down and shook her hand in the pool&#39;s water.<br />
<br />
Eric and Julie felt the vibration of something thrashing in the water near the surface almost immediately. Both of them turned to see Melissa crouching by the side of the pool and looking to them with a soft smile as well.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your mom&#39;s home,&quot; Eric said slowly as she brought his hands down, forgetting that his penis was presently within his tail for the moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can see that,&quot; Julie nodded, &quot;Let&#39;s go show her the new you.&quot;<br />
<br />
The two moved over to the pool side and rose out the water a bit until their heads came out of the water near where Melissa was crouched. Julie also did her best to keep her mother from seeing the full swell of her own breasts, even though Melissa knew what breasts looked like.<br />
<br />
&quot;I see you two have had a good day,&quot; Melissa gave a smile to both of them, &quot;I trust things went well?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Julie answered, &quot;better than planned, actually.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh?&quot; Melissa wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... for one, I couldn&#39;t just push it without letting him know what was happening and what our love was building toward,&quot; Julie spoke, &quot;And as you can see... he was very accepting of the idea.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I love her very much, Mrs. Stovall,&quot; Eric spoke as he felt the adult weremermaid look to him, &quot;I... I can&#39;t see myself without your daughter.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So long as you keep her happy, you will have no objections from Martin and I,&quot; Melissa told him, &quot;and so long as Julie stays on her pills, and we don&#39;t become grandparents until after you&#39;ve graduated college and gotten jobs.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;MoooooooooOOOOOOOM!&quot; Julie blushed.<br />
<br />
&quot;I will keep her happy,&quot; Eric vowed.<br />
<br />
Melissa nodded and then looked back Julie who was still smiling, &quot;Is there anything more?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Julie answered and lifted up the necklace to display the lone pearl on the lanyard. It might not be as many pearls as the one her father had given Melissa, but it included a pearl and that was ALL Julie cared about, &quot;we&#39;ll have to wait until after we&#39;ve graduated high school to go through with it... but we will get married.&quot;<br />
<br />
Melissa felt herself shed a few more tears of joy. &quot;Did you two have some lunch?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; Julie answered weakly, &quot;we started swimming shortly after Eric arrived... and we consummated our love just after ten. We only just stopped getting our hormones in order a little while ago.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You both DID have a good day,&quot; Melissa smiled, &quot;Why don&#39;t you two change back and climb out. I&#39;ll make you some sandwiches and you can tell me more about your adventures today and whether or not the Skulk will allow Julie to come as a guest.&quot;<br />
<br />
She was glad to see her daughter happy, and while it may have come sooner that she or Martin had ever expected, Melissa knew that both she and her husband would be glad to see Julie happy. And Eric did make a handsome merman and looked to be happy as well.</p>
