<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Chloe walked down the street, unable to contain her giddiness. Outwardly, nothing was different. But...she knew what she had stashed away in her backpack. She&#39;d seen the results of what it could for herself. She had no idea how that kid had gotten a hold of something like this - had he used it on purpose, knowing what it would do? Or was it something he had also just sort of found, and then witnessed the results of? That was probably more likely - there was no way he&#39;d have dropped it otherwise. <br />
<br />
Oh well. His loss, her gain!<br />
<br />
It didn&#39;t take long to reach home. She entered into the door and smelled spaghetti cooking in the kitchen. Her mom leaned through the door and waved to her. &quot;Hey honey, how was school?&quot;<br />
<br />
Truthfully, after what she&#39;d seen at the park, most of what had happened at school now seemed trivial. But the usual answer easily rose up. &quot;It was fine,&quot; she said. Her mom rolled her eyes; she was always teasing Chloe about her overuse of the word &#39;fine&#39; to describe things. &#39;Not everything can be fine all the time&#39; her mom had said on more than one occasion.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll be in the garage for a bit!&quot; Chloe called.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, don&#39;t get too involved in something, dinner is gonna be ready soon!&quot; her mom shouted after her.<br />
<br />
Chloe eagerly walked over to the bench where she kept a lot of her various projects - usually just simple things, where she&#39;d tinker on stuff. She&#39;d gotten pretty good at disassembling and reassembling various tools and pieces of equipment. She&#39;d learned how to build computers as well when she was younger, and there was a bunch of computer equipment and loose wiring lying around. She swiped it all aside and turned on the small lamp she kept at the bench. <br />
<br />
Then, almost reverently, she took it out. The ray-gun. <br />
<br />
She let out a snort of a laugh. She couldn&#39;t help it! It looked funny. So unassuming. It really did look like some kinda hokey prop from a 50&#39;s sci-fi movie. <br />
<br />
Still, Chloe had seen what it could do. She turned it over in her hands, moving slowly and cautiously - better to play it safe with this thing for the time being, right? She would be lying if she didn&#39;t admit that a part of her wanted to test it out on herself. But...first she&#39;d have to get a better idea of how it worked. She&#39;d love to have bigger breasts, and that girl had <i>really</i> seemed to enjoy the process. But she&#39;d also rather not end up with tits large enough that they anchored her to the ground like they had with that girl. <br />
<br />
Huh. <br />
<br />
Speaking of.<br />
<br />
She turned on her small TV set and flipped to the local news. It was a story about a bakery; nothing interesting. So she returned to the gun.<br />
<br />
As far as Chloe could tell, there were no buttons. No way to configure anything. It was chrome, with no visible seams or openings. No place where something like a battery or ammunition might go. No evident power source. No indication that it had been welded shut. She felt all along the outer edges of it, but there was simply no openings she could exploit - even the spot where the beam had emitted from was simply smooth and shiny. The lack of any visible configuration options was a little troubling - and annoying. Perhaps that meant that there was some other way of controlling it. Maybe there was an additional piece of equipment that was meant to go with it. Like...some kind of goggles or a glove or something. Or maybe it needed special software to configure it. There had to be something - she just had no idea what. <br />
<br />
&quot;Who made you?&quot; she muttered to herself as she turned it over on the bench. &quot;And why?&quot;<br />
<br />
If it held any answers - they weren&#39;t forthcoming for the moment. <br />
<br />
She sighed and sat back in her seat. <br />
<br />
Alright, so.<br />
<br />
The boy had shot the beam at the girl, for a couple of seconds. Maybe...five or so? Without a recording, she had no way of knowing for sure. But about five seconds sounded right.<br />
<br />
Maybe the length of the shot would have an effect on it. <br />
<br />
But she wouldn&#39;t know unless she tried it on someone.<br />
<br />
Obviously, she wasn&#39;t about to try it out on her Mom. That would just be too weird. <br />
<br />
But...<br />
<br />
Rebecca, her older sister...<br />
<br />
Chloe smiled slightly, thinking about it. Rebecca was in college, only a few years older than Chloe. They got along for the most part - arguments about clothes and shower times and the other things sisters usually argued about aside. Like Chloe, Rebecca was mostly flat in the chest department.<br />
<br />
It&#39;d be doing her a favor if it worked, right?<br />
<br />
But...<br />
<br />
She didn&#39;t necessarily want her sister to end up as some kinda...experiment? Or freak? If this went poorly. Maybe it would be better instead to wait for school. <br />
<br />
But Chloe&#39;s curiosity was desperate to know more! <br />
<br />
And so, she gathered up the ray-gun and turned back towards the door leading inside, only just remembering to shut off the light behind her. &quot;Sorry Becca,&quot; she muttered to herself. &quot;It&#39;s for science!&quot;<br />
<br />
Chloe entered the kitchen, and as though fate itself was encouraging her, her Mom turned to her and said, &quot;Can you go tell Becca that dinner is ready?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure,&quot; Chloe said, trying not to smile. <br />
<br />
She darted upstairs, holding the ray-gun cautiously in her hands. As she approached her sister&#39;s door, she hid it behind her back and knocked on the door. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah?&quot; came Rebecca&#39;s voice from within.<br />
<br />
Chloe opened the door about half-way. &quot;Oh, uhh, Mom wanted me to tell you that dinner is ready...&quot; she said. Rebecca was lounging on her bed, flipping through a tablet. <br />
<br />
&quot;Mmm,&quot; Rebecca said, barely glancing up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, hey...can I borrow your charger? Mine is...not...working,&quot; Chloe said, looking down at the charger by the bed.<br />
<br />
Rebecca smirked. &quot;What, take it apart to use in some experiment?&quot; she asked. She leaned over to grab the charger.<br />
<br />
Before she lost her nerve, Chloe took the ray-gun, aimed it at her sister, and pushed the trigger down as softly as she could. The second she felt it depress, she let go.<br />
<br />
Like she&#39;d witnessed at the park, a beam of light - less intense this time - shot out from the gun and struck her sister. Chloe held her breath as she watched, lowering the gun slowly.<br />
<br />
Almost instantly, Rebecca let out a gasp of surprise, the tablet tumbling down from her lap from the movement. Her eyes snapped shut, and it was clear she&#39;d completely forgotten Chloe was in the room. Chloe&#39;s eyes were quickly drawn down to her sister&#39;s chest - and sure enough, through the red blouse that her sister was wearing, she could see her breasts beginning to push forward. Rebecca let out another gasp and a moan, and then her hand snaked down to her pants, disappearing underneath them; Chloe&#39;s eyebrows shot up, and now she felt uncomfortable. But she had to know if the growth was going to be as...explosive as it had been in the park.<br />
<br />
Rebecca was gasping and letting out small moans of pleasure now, but all the while, the bumps on her chest grew larger - in a matter of moments, they began to bounce with her movement, and Chloe watched as Rebecca used her other hand to grab at her chest in surprise. <br />
<br />
They continued to grow larger, bouncing more and more...Chloe watched with rapt attention.<br />
<br />
And then, when they&#39;d taken up a modest amount of her blouse, resulting in a chest that was larger, but not comically so - finally, Chloe stepped back from the door, and ran off to her room, trembling with excitement.<br />
<br />
It had worked. Again! And differently! So how long you fired it...that was the key. That was the key to how much a person&#39;s breasts would grow. Chloe was more tempted than ever to try it out on herself now - breasts the size that her sister now had would be perfect! <br />
<br />
But she was also still very curious. How far could this device push things? Was there a limit to how many times it could be used? And more importantly - was there a way to undo it? Because she kinda felt a little bad about that girl in the park - if there was a way she could make it so she was mobile again...<br />
<br />
And then Chloe let out a laugh as she thought of how much possibility this thing had...<br />
<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s see you try and bully me anymore Sarah,&quot; Chloe muttered. &quot;Insult me or my friends one more time and pow! You&#39;ll have to be carried around.&quot; She laughed again.<br />
<br />
Almost reverently, she put the ray-gun in a drawer of her desk, covering it with some papers. Oh, she was going to have to experiment more with this for sure. <br />
<br />
But for now - dinner.<br />
<br />
She trotted back down the stairs, where her Mom was setting up the table. Chloe smiled at her and began to help.<br />
<br />
&quot;Where&#39;s Becca?&quot; her mom asked.<br />
<br />
Chloe shrugged. &quot;She&#39;ll be down soon,&quot; she said, trying not to laugh.<br />
<br />
Her mom shrugged. The garage door opened and her dad came home, having gotten back from work. He kissed her mom and gave Chloe a hug before going to get changed. Soon, the three of them were sitting at the table. Her dad was talking about his day at work and she was only half listening, still imagining all the possible uses of such a device. <br />
<br />
Then Rebecca walked into the room. &quot;H-hey,&quot; she said, looking flushed and a bit dazed.<br />
<br />
Chloe saw her Mom look up and then do a double, and then triple take, looking surprised. <br />
<br />
Chloe glanced over at Rebecca - her new chest was bouncing a bit in the blouse - which hadn&#39;t been designed for much of a bust - and she had to fight again not to laugh. <br />
<br />
Rebecca took a seat across from Chloe. &quot;Here, you were, uh, you were looking for this right?&quot; Rebecca asked, handing her the charger.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, uh, yeah, thanks,&quot; Chloe said.<br />
<br />
Their Mom was still gazing at Rebecca with a slightly confused expression, her eyebrows furrowed. Their dad was still talking, seemingly having not noticed anything was amiss. Chloe was almost having to bite down on her tongue to keep from laughing. <br />
<br />
As Rebecca scooped up a bit of spaghetti, her Mom finally couldn&#39;t help herself anymore.<br />
<br />
&quot;Becca...I&#39;m sorry...but...are you STUFFING your bra??&quot; she asked incredulously, causing her Dad to cut off mid sentence and Rebecca to look down with wide eyes, her face still flushed. <br />
<br />
And then Chloe couldn&#39;t help it anymore, and her half-chewed bite of spaghetti went flying across the table as she let out a loud, long laugh.</p>
