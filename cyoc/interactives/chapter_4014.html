<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kirk was giddy.  His muscles felt so...heavy under his shirt.  They were ready for some exercise.  Getting out of HIS car, he slammed the door and walked confidently into his new gym.  He surveyed the broad array of equipment.  Mostly what his father ever did was work out there on weekends, manage it during the week, and substitute as the gym coach whenever he was called in.  Those were now, his, Kirk's jobs, and he loved it.  He loved being big, and he loved the fact that he now made a living at it!  Far from being like his father though, he wouldn't be a blowhard about it, and hold it over others.  Still...he had to start enjoying this new body.  He looked like a professional weightlifter...in fact, he was!  Italian good looks and short hair, thanks to a stop on the road.  He'd felt the need to cut it down a few inches.  It brought out his muscles all the more.  He licked his lips and found a couple of the local regulars, fit and bulky with muscle, dripping at their machines...<br />
<br />
Among them was Andy, one of the local college boys who was on his way to football or baseball stardom...hell, he could probably do either.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey,&quot; said Kirk, somewhat nervously.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey!&quot; grinned an unsuspecting Andy, who's curly deep brown hair trickled with sweat.  His hair was beautiful, and he had deep crystal eyes, and a Roman nose, with a light tan and a layer of redbrown stubble on his face.  Andy, he noticed, was now shorter than him!  Kirk felt good for several reasons.  Technically, he looked about thirty, and he fantasized about being the &quot;older&quot; one in a relationship with Andy.  He'd always thought about him when his father took him into the gym.  What did Andy remember?  Probably just that Kirk owned the gym and that &quot;they&quot; had been friends for a while.  The magic of the vouchers was wonderful indeed.<br />
<br />
&quot;So dude, how are you these days?&quot; asked Kirk, eagerly, wanting to lick the beads off of Andy's taut chest.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can't complain, can't complain.  I always love coming here.  It doesn't have the you know, pretensions of other gyms.  Plus uh, you know.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, what?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I don't know if you know this, but a lot of the guys at the college who come here...they sort of...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hook up?&quot; Kirk interjected with a smile?  This was better than he ever could have hoped for!<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, kinda, sometimes.  I mean, not that often, but I've been hoping.  Other guys have met their boyfriends here, I thought...maybe I'd try.&quot;  His look was starting to become one of shyness and reflective avoidance.  Kirk decided to make his move, as his heart was beating out of control.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe you've found the right guy all along, but you didn't...know&quot;<br />
<br />
Andy shot him a look of shock.<br />
<br />
&quot;So you?  But you have a kid!  I just assumed...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Eli...he's such a good *kid*,&quot; said Kirk, having obvious fun with the new reversal.  &quot;But he's actually sort of...not mine.  He's actually...well, my...uh, nephew.&quot;  That would suffice for an official cover, he realized.  Kirk shot a look at himself in the mirror.  He towered over Andy practically, but inside he was jelly, and felt very small.  Things practically swam in front of him, the reflections of the wall making the room seem so much larger.  His face was gorgeous, manly, dark haired, and the slight crinkles on his face gave him a ruggedly, fatherly face that appealed to Andy, unbeknownst to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh...wow.&quot; said Andy.  &quot;You know...if you ever want to...uh...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe...we could uh...&quot; Kirk shuffled his feet nervously.  &quot;Sorry.  Still not used to this.&quot;<br />
<br />
Andy laughed, wonderfully, music to his ears.  &quot;C'mon, dude.  You've got it going on.  If it's anyone who should be squirmin' it's me.  So.  What's goin' through your mind?...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, I really...I really like you,&quot; blurted out Kirk, who was now sweating on his face profusely.<br />
<br />
Andy laughed again.  &quot;God, you're like a little kid or something.&quot;  He touched Kirk's hand and held it.  Kirk had an instant erection throb in his pants and bulge upwards.<br />
<br />
Andy grinned devilishly.  &quot;Hey, what do you say we uh...take a look in back.  In the showers...&quot;  Kirk followed him, unable to even speak, his heart POUNDING so loud it was all he could hear.  He held onto the doorway for a second before fumbling around in his pocket for his new keys.  He locked the door behind him so no one could enter the shower room.<br />
<br />
Andy's chest was taut and covered with a brushy sweep of curly hair.  His eyes were incredibly sharp looking, as was the angular features of his face.  He sat down on a bench between a row of lockers and began to unzip his shorts.  Shirking them off left him with only his briefs.  He walked over to Kirk and shoved him against the side of a row of lockers and planted himself around the larger man's torso.  Grinning, Andy took Kirk's belt and gently threw it aside.  He undressed Kirk slowly, every touch bringing Kirk a slight moan.<br />
<br />
&quot;I...I...I've never done this before!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Shhhhh...&quot; said Andy.  &quot;Why don't you come down here, dude?&quot; he said quietly, the two of them alone in the dank room with bare floors and the smell of manly odors wafting throughout the air.  Kirk managed to spread his legs and bend down, first stroking Andy across his face, and then feeling his widely muscled arms, looking at them with wonder.  He felt his tie being unloosened, his shirt unbuttoned, and then he threw his shirt across the floor, stepped forwards with a carnal grin on his face, and let his pants drop.  His penis was held tightly against his abdomen, throbbing.  He quickened his pace, hurtled his underwear down and let the beautiful penis enter Andy's ass as he chased him onto one of the benches.<br />
<br />
They made exquisite love, as Kirk smelled Andy's ass, groped it, caressed it, massaged it, entered it repeatedly with the condom Andy had slipped him so casually.<br />
<br />
When he had entered after the fourth time the two slipped into a shower and kissed passionately, unstoppably, repeatedly kissing each other over every single part of their bodies, chest, legs; Kirk found he loved licking Kirk under the running water, licking him from his hairy legs on upwards, and he then proceeded to lift Andy up as he hugged him and carry him as Andy wrapped his legs around his torso.  It was difficult but he knew Andy could not do it for him.  He was the bigger man, the one with the unsatiable appetite, the one who locked jaws with Andy, cringing with delight every time Andy flexed one of his large, veined-defined biceps.  Putting him on the ground again, they slapped one another's asses and after it was over, they decided they were officially together in a way that was both startling and completely natural.<br />
<br />
Three days later, after repeated visits to one another's places, Kirk gave Andy a key to his house.<br />
<br />
The problem was...how was he going to explain a resentful parent stuck as an eleven year old boy.  And how was he to explain he was now a mix of adult and little boy, all swirled together in hormonal glee?<br />
<br />
Finally, he came clean with Andy.  He told him everything.  Andy had been at first convinced he was the victim of some terrible gag, a joke, a practical joke that was far too lingering.  He asked Kirk to stop it.<br />
<br />
Kirk conceded to give in and show his powers.  Ever since he had become the dominating adult of the house, he had seized control of his dad's vouchers.  Now he unlocked the vault he'd bought specifically for them, and took one out.<br />
<br />
&quot;What should we wish for?&quot;<br />
<br />
Andy smiled.  &quot;Well, I pretty much have my doubts, but...it is exciting, isn't it?  The idea that you could go from a little spud to the STUD that I love?  If the Madame Illusia can do that, I owe her one.  But still...I would like to see it tried out.  I mean, I love you and all, it's just...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's a lot, huh?  I mean, it's like on TV,&quot; said Kirk.  &quot;You need to see something incredible...it's supernatural like Buffy killing vampires.&quot;<br />
<br />
Andy smiled.  Kirk often said such childish things he noticed.  And then there was his obsession with playing with toys on the floor of the living room, making noises with the tiny cars and robots...<br />
<br />
Wait.  It DID all fit into place.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; said Andy.  &quot;What should we wish for?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't know...think of something!&quot;<br />
<br />
Andy thought.  There were always the anti gay bullies he'd grown up with.  Maybe they could do to be turned into little PIPsqueaks!  And then there was the now growing desire inside him to turn a child into an adult.  The thought really turned him on the more he thought about it.  He hadn't quite appreciated until now how much he'd been responsible for Kirk growing up.  <br />
