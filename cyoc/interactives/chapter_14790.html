<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The sounding of an alarm bell has the Doctor shuffling along at a quick pace but his rotundous form does not move well in a fast mode. He motions for you to come along and soon the two of you are in a speeding golf cart head toward the alarm.<br />
<br />
&quot;What is wrong?&quot; you ask as the concern shows on the Doctor's face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Its Hank!&quot; he replies shortly and drives onward.<br />
<br />
You reach the tall white wooden barn is reminds one of a soundstage at MGM. The Doctor using a pass card opens the security lock and in you both go. A hallway with offices and one leads to a laboratory with a multitude of bubbling experiments doing there thing.<br />
<br />
The Doctor approaches another man dressed in whites and his shirt is spotted with blood. They both stand outside a steel door and peer through a small window at what is inside the next room.<br />
<br />
After aminute the Doctor turns to you and asking, &quot;Hank would have been kept sedated but someone forgot an injection. Now he has awakened and is throwing a tantrum. I want you to enter the clean room with me and if possible comfort him down before he hurts himself.&quot; asked the Doctor sounding very concerned for the child's welfare.<br />
<br />
He opens the door and stands to one side as you walk inside the very clean white room. There on the floor before the both of you is a laboratory tech man laying face down on the floor a severe wound in his neck has a pool of deep red blood on the floor.<br />
<br />
You look at the man and then hear and turn to see Hank crouching in a corner of the room.<br />
<br />
Your gasp of what you see makes Hank stop his crying and you look at the Doctor who just shrugs his shoulders and holding out his hand palm up motions for you to approach Hank.<br />
<br />
The little kid his hunched down half seated on the floor. His right hand is behind his back as he leans there against the corner and wall. He looks up to you and with a jarbuled manner tries to speak your name.<br />
<br />
His mouth now extended has grown into his nose making an almost normal sized snout of a Hog. His face, neck, and chest being he sits there naked are thick with a black coarse bristles of the final form he will become. His ears have changed and stick out as he wiggles then having the animal dexterity of moving them at will. <br />
<br />
As he crouches down his human legs have taken partial transition to those that with help move him about when he be changed into the boar Hog Doctor has planned. His feet almost totally changed as toes be now cloven hooves that supports him as he sits.<br />
<br />
You take a direct few steps toward him then slowing you side step which offers another approach and a different view. Hank's right hand is behind his back but now you can see it. The hand in contorted looking like the fingers are well changed to represent a cloven hoof or the beginning thereof. His is toying with a short tufted tail protruding out his lower spine and plays with the tassle in a nervous sort of way.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hank, its me!&quot; you say kneeling down and holding out your hands and arms offering to cuddle.<br />
<br />
Quickly he moves to a standing position and with arms outstretched either side of his pudgy body he uses them to hold balance as he walks on cloven hooves. The hooves make hard clomping sounds with every step on the linoleum floor. He totters as he walks making you note that walking upright on cloven hooves might not be all that easy. <br />
<br />
As his bristled arms wrap around your neck and he presses his scared body into your the pungent scent of a hog body reaches your nose.<br />
<br />
You try and hug him anyway even though his stench is rather putting you off. His right hand and cloven fingers scratch your neck, while his other hand still quite human of form finger through the hair on the back of your head. His head bowed down and snout digs into your chest there is a noted feeling of his tusks across your flesh.<br />
<br />
Out of muddle words and cries you make out he is asking for his Mommy and Daddy to come and take him home. His words make tears well up as you know they never will come.<br />
<br />
You comfort Hank and he stops crying as he pulls back from hugging you and shows off his changed and still transitioning form. <br />
<br />
Muddled but trying hard he slowly works his snout to form words mostly using his tongue and throat. <br />
<br />
&quot;I ah hauck hiiah!&quot; he says then stops as tears well up he realizes in his young mind that what he was is not what he's going to become.<br />
<br />
Two men in white come in and collect a dead associate which was on the floor. As he's toted out the room Hank snarls at the sight making drool roll out one side of his mouth. He points with his still human like hand making a small fist he shakes it at the Doctor.<br />
<br />
Suddenly the boy shakes like racked from a chilled shiver as his arms drop to the sides of his pudgy body. He lowers his head clamps his mouth tight shut and then moans as arms cross over and hug his belly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Its pitiful!&quot; you remark looking toward the Doctor Thule and his assistant standing there no real expression on either face.<br />
<br />
&quot;You may stay until the sedation takes effect and then exit this room and have one of the laboratory people call me.&quot; says the Doctor as he walks out with the other man.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah hilled ahmm!&quot; mumbled Hank as he points to the pool of blood on the floor.<br />
<br />
&quot;Did he hurt you, I'm sorry, I&quot;m sorry Hank. &quot; you try to console the boy knowing he's soon to be on his own and will find life quite lonely till his sexual lusts are aroused. <br />
<br />
An hour slips by and at last you have a limp creature held and brased up in your arms. Two men come in and return Hank to his small pen centered in the room. They tend to him as one uses a white cloth to clean the boy and the other gives yet another injection to do only Doc Thule knows what.<br />
<br />
The Doctor is called and you are escorted out the building and told to sit outside on of all things a park bench set under a spreading large Oak.<br />
<br />
Doing as told with no reason not to, you watch as handlers walk by with one or another type of animal in tow. Its not long before this bright and pretty young lady comes walking past. She looks like a professional athlete her slim and trim body while well blessed for motherhood someday.<br />
<br />
Until right then you hadn't seen any of females about, save those walking on all fours. She smiles a friendly smile at you and stops to give you a good morning.<br />
<br />
&quot;You work here do you!&quot; you ask in your best and most friendly way.<br />
<br />
She smiles and pivits on one heel looking the wonderous sight of this research facility and the well kept lawns, trees, flowers, and shribs plants in all properly arranged patterns.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, no, I would love to work here but I don't! Did you meet the Doctor, you know Doctor Ultima Thule, he's such a brillant man! I was in awe of him, such a mind, his knowledge and the foundation he heads up, its goals why....!&quot; she says as if her wits are captive of the size and wealth this place beholds.<br />
<br />
&quot;You don't work here, are you just visiting?&quot; you ask with that same old thought of escape even though you know now it would mean a beastly life anyway.<br />
<br />
She plops down quickly on the park bench too. Her face all aglow with wonder. &quot;I'm with a group, we are volunteers is a special project!&quot; she announces as if it be a grand thing.<br />
<br />
&quot;What a pretty young lady such as you wishing to be as, as, as a cow or God knows what?&quot; the words burst out of you after being witha nice little boy well on his way to being a brute beast.<br />
<br />
She smiles but as you her eyes look to a passing pair of Donkeys. The two gray and brown animals are tugging to be free of the reins totting them along. One being purely man is showing his feelings in true equine fashion, his black cock out erect and swaying with every step.<br />
<br />
&quot;That, no those luck souls are now healthy and will be able to live long and fruitful lives now! You know its really something that the Doctor Thule accepts those with total disablements and with the chemicals makes for them a new life and a fine health body to live inside. He' a saint that man, a true to life saint!&quot; says the lady as her praise of the Doc seems to be really heart felt.<br />
<br />
Ready now to argue the facts you stop seeing the Doctor coming a way off on his golf cart and heading your way.<br />
<br />
&quot;If you don't work here are you and your group fact finders, government, or just what?&quot; you ask wondering where she came from?<br />
<br />
She smiles a broad smile as with a wiggle of her butt on the bench she's all thrilled to announce her purpose there.<br />
<br />
&quot;We came as a group, Nudists, we are believers in living as free spirits and the Doctor has agreed to help us find our goal. He and his Foundation has an island where we can live and be f-r-ee!&quot; she tells as you listen.<br />
<br />
&quot;An island, all alone just the group, how will you live, find food, survive?&quot; you ask seeing the Doctor getting closer.<br />
<br />
&quot;We are being prepared for a life as part of the wild and open air. I and three other girls along with four men one a husband now but soon to be divorced, are to be interwoven with a strain of Austrailian Mountain Goats. Then living as part goat and part human we will find our true selves he says within a year. He's a wonderful man!&quot; she says and ends with a sigh as the golf cart pulls to a stop.<br />
<br />
&quot;Florence your due for the next round of injections, please report to your Lab now!&quot; says the Doc as she jumps up kisses the Doc passionately and jogs off.<br />
<br />
&quot;You got her wrapped around your finger, to be sure!&quot; you state as the Doc pulls out a hanky and wipes, wipes, and wipes the kiss mark on his chin.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can't be too careful working around people like her and her on the process too! Nice girl she and her friends will make a wonderful contribution to Austrailia very soon.&quot; says the Doc watching a pretty ass jog off down the road.<br />
<br />
&quot;You making them as almost satyrs in the wild!&quot; you state as if starting an arguement.<br />
<br />
The Doctor turns to face you and with a bland expression he says, Not quite, they approached us through a web page offering free pleasured lives under south sea island conditions, nothing more was said. She, Florence and her friends are in treatment for final placement and repopulation as Austrailian Mountain Goats. I think it quite prim and proper for a group of Nudists to be and live together as Goats, don't you think thats alright?&quot; the Doc puts the subject to rest and vollies the question back at you.<br />
<br />
Before you can say a word he motions you into the cart to ride where he wants your opinion.<br />
<br />
&quot;Florence thinks your quite the humanitarian, taking in all these hopeless people strapped with their infirmaties, you bring them back to health and in fine strong bodies too!&quot; you chid the man for his gaul.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm, propaganda nothing more! Your not that stupid to think I do this for humanity, I enjoy watching them change! I like to see the human spirit fight for to exsist and still lose while getting on sexually with one of their new kind. It is likely they still think themselves human when impreganting the first total beast of one's new species. Why just the other day I had a young man, an escaped prisoner who wandered onto the Foundation property. Security picked him up and brought him to me. He was willing to do anything accept not wanting to return to prison. I saw in him one willing to be hidden, so I am helping him find peace and contentment.&quot; tells the Doc his face half lit with a smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;You made him as...?&quot; you begin a question but almost know the answer.<br />
<br />
Doctor Thule truns a sharp corner and heads for a long building only one story high unlike the many others. As he stops by a door he smiles and again motions for you to follow along.<br />
<br />
&quot;Steve was in my way of thinking a timid man and did not appreciate being put upon by those gay prisoners. He wanted peace, his was a wish to left alone yet remain equal when he needed company. He also had a deep seeded desire to be of help to humanity, so I've given him his wish.&quot; says Thule as he opens a steel security door to of all places a milking barn.<br />
<br />
Pointing down the line in one stall is a shaking brown Gurnsey cow. He motions you to walk along and silently you follow looking at the cows one by one.<br />
<br />
&quot;Steve I brought someone who wishes to see your work.&quot; says the Doc as he stands just far enough back as not to feel a kick.<br />
<br />
You peer down into the stall seeing the rump of a Gurnsey cow and it being milked by a machine snugged onto each teat. A look forward the cow body narrows down till neck and head are of a scared man sweating while his mouth his chucked full of fodder. <br />
<br />
Steve mumbles something, shakes his head as cow ears flop and returns to the dull motion of gorging himself on half rotted hay and grass clippings.<br />
<br />
&quot;That's terrible!' you exclaim.<br />
<br />
The doctor smiles and motions you to return back out the way you came in. Once outside and away from the smell he plops into his golf cart.<br />
<br />
&quot;He's everything the man asked to be but now he will have true peace!&quot; says Thule with a grin. &quot;You think me cruel but in time, a short time for Steve he will become a total Gurnsey cow. His, ah her feelings and wants will conform and with pasturing she will meet a nice bull.&quot; he stops there and looks at you like as if that's the way he should be.<br />
<br />
Plop you go into the golf cart as to why argue it won't help you or Steve. <br />
<br />
&quot;I have something you need to consider as today we shall tour the barns and stable to find what interests you.&quot; says the Doc as you just sit, watch, and think.</p>
