<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Oblivious to her predicament, Jen went on about her day being a dumb bitch. The usual. Sifting through her DMs, putting laugh reacts on memes and dick pics that countless guys send her on an hourly basis. The day she turned 18, she had started an OnlyFans, Patreon, ManyVids, etc. She had already been a successful cosplayer on Instagram since she was a sophmore.<br />
<br />
When she was younger, she had been as flat as a washboard. It helped her win gymnastics competitions to be so thin and limber, but she secretly dreamed of having big boobs. Not too big, mind you, just enough to catch the attention of the boys. A few months after she turned 14, she noticed the telltale puff of her nipples and was ecstatic. But less than a week later, as she groggily stepped into the shower, she realized her puffy nips had developed small cherry tomato sized balls of fat. She was embarrassed by their appearance, and refused to wear a swimsuit all summer, as her almost comical little buds stayed that way for quite some time. Some girls in the locker room at school noticed one day, and she developed several nicknames rather quickly. Cat Tits. Cherries. Grapes. Little Miss Ball Bearings. She was constantly being bullied.<br />
<br />
But within a month she awoke to a tightness in her chest. Her nipples were straining against the tight band T she often slept in. But never again. She quickly donated it to GoodWill, as her buds had bloomed into small mounds over night. There were signs of stretch marks forming were the tiny new bags of flesh met with her chest. She was mortified. The feeling of her tiny little tits dropping the first time she lifted her shirt was surreal. She had always longed to feel this bounce, but the feeling of this new weight pulling down on her chest and rebounding made her cringe. It felt almost dirty. That was a feeling that would always stay with her, and only get worse.<br />
<br />
They never stopped growing after that. But what made matters worse were the coming changes to her bone structure. She had always had square hips, thin thighs that still manage to touch, and a posterior as flat as she had been everywhere else. When her cherry tomato buds had formed, her hips had started to come in as well. Again she was mortified by the stretch marks as her bones creaked and grew over the weeks. Her still thin legs were slowly separating, leaving a noticeable thigh gap. Her locker room bullies loved to walk up behind her, and toss pens and erasers through her thigh gap at opportune times.<br />
<br />
It wasn&#39;t until her swelling incident that her butt cheeks started to accumulate more and more flesh. Whenever she would put on her panties, the new meat she was packing would gently spill out the sides of her panties, which made her feel disgusting. When she was younger, she wanted an ass she could twerk, but this butt was a constant reminder of her budding sexuality. With every step she would take with her burgeoning hips she could not help but sway, a jiggle off her butt cheeks would remind her of the sexual object she was becoming.<br />
<br />
She always had that same feeling about her everwidening tits. Men of all ages would ogle her as she would walk by. It never seemed to matter how often she replaced her bras, her boob flesh was always bloating over the tops of the cups. As she swelled through the ranks of cup sizes, she found it more and more difficult to not look lewd in literally any clothing. Especially as her thighs began to spill over the tops of the thigh high socks she was accustomed to wearing. Why could clothes never contain her for long?<br />
<br />
Ever since she had been more of a dork, she had been a fan of Sailor Moon. She ended up cosplaying Sailor Jupiter, and ended up taking a group photo with a grip of other Sailor Jupiters. None of them really compared to the way she lewdly stretched her top. Especially not since it ripped in the middle just before the shot was taken, exposing the nude swell of her underboob. After that, she was approached by several photographers who helped her launch her cosplay career.<br />
<br />
Even though she hated herself and the way that she continued to feel less and less appropriate, just by existing in public spaces, she soon realized the power that her rapid asset accumulation granted her over men and women alike. Maybe if she had not let all this newfound popularity go to her head, she never would have treated Kyle like she used to be treated, and what was in store for her would never have come to pass.</p>
