<br />
&quot;Hnnng!&quot; Lightning groaned as she turned in her sleep. &quot;Ohhh! Th-They&#39;re so tight!&quot; The condom was ballooning to its max capacity with pre-cum. &quot;I need to cum! I need to cum!&quot; Her massive testicles sloshed on her thighs. &quot;HnnnggGahhh!&quot; Lightning shot awake and sat up. Her breasts bounced down, tightly stuffed inside her tank top, a small wet spot was forming around her nipple. &quot;Haa... Haa... Shit...&quot; Her cock was a great deal larger than it was a month ago, towering next to her face. Her testicles were bigger than soccer balls, resting, and gurgling with gallons of cum, on her legs, tightly stuffed inside her shorts. &quot;Fuck... I&#39;m getting so backed up... Fuck! I want to fuck someone so badly!&quot;<br />
<br />
Stepping out of bed, she was finding it harder to walk and stand up straight due to the increasing weight of her body. She took a single step. *Rip!* Her testicles had finally managed to burst out. They swung down, pulling Lightning down from their weight, causing her to stumble and lean against a table for support. &quot;Oof! Shit! Well... I guess that was bound to happen eventually...&quot; She stood in front of a mirror to see the size of her swelling figure. &quot;Geez... My tits are so big... and these hips... my ass is so huge...&quot; She moved around and watched how her body jiggled and bounced with each slight movement. &quot;Fuck, that is pretty hot...&quot; Her cock was leaking pre-cum onto her carpet, so she wobbled to the shower.<br />
<br />
Lightning was finding herself getting extremely turned on as she showered from rubbing her breasts and ass. She gently washed her cock and testicles, but even the slightest touch caused large amounts of pre-cum to pour from her cock. Her showers were now taking over an hour. Lightning got on another condom and struggled to get her panties on, she was just getting too big. She threw on another wide skirt, that did even less to cover her genitals, and headed to work. In her car, she was now having to sit with her legs far apart, to let her testicles rest on the seat. If she laid them on her thighs they pressed against the steering wheel and distracted her while driving.<br />
<br />
At her workplace, she looked at no one and said nothing, heading straight to her office while sweat dribbled from her head. Her thighs were pressing heavily against her testicles as she walked. In her room when she tried to sit in her chair, her butt was squeezing in between the armrests. &quot;Damnit... My ass is getting too fat for even my chair!&quot; She distracted herself with her work the entire day, doing as much as she could. She didn&#39;t even leave her office for lunch. When it was nearing for her to leave, she got a call from Crystal. Lightning felt relief while answering it. Crystal wanted to ask Lightning if it was alright for them to have dinner at Crystal&#39;s place, which Lightning of course agreed to and told her she would be heading over soon.<br />
<br />
Lightning quickly drove back home and looked for a dress to wear. She found a pretty black dress that was loose at the bottom and was meant to reach down to her ankles. She got it on, but with her growing size it only reached to just below her knees, and her breasts were overflowing out the top, showing a great deal of cleavage. After Lightning finished prettying herself up, she went to Crystal&#39;s apartment.<br />
<br />
Lightning sat in her car for a moment before heading up to Crystal&#39;s room. When Crystal answered the door, the second Lightning saw her she immediately felt the blood flowing into her cock. Crystal was wearing a small, skin-tight dress that ended midway down her thighs, it really showed off her curves. &quot;H-Hey, Crystal!&quot; &quot;Hi, Claire!&quot; They embraced, leading to their breasts squeezing and rubbing together, which didn&#39;t help Lightning with her cock. &quot;W-Wow, Claire... You look... different.&quot; Lightning knew she was referring to her figure, for her hips and breasts were much larger than they were on their first date, even bigger than Crystal&#39;s now. Lightning just nervously laughed it off and agreed.<br />
<br />
Crystal pulled Lightning in and seated her at the table. Lightning looked around and noticed the apartment was cleaned very thoroughly and the place was dimly lit with candles set around the place, two being on the dinner table she sat at. She trembled as she was still feeling her cock slowly grow under her dress. Crystal had informed her that she made dinner for them, so she was in the kitchen, adding the finishing touches.<br />
<br />
Lightning sat in patience, trying to not focus on her cock in the hopes that it wouldn&#39;t keep swelling. When Crystal came out of the kitchen, she brought two ready plates of food and placed one in front of Lightning. &quot;I hope you enjoy it!&quot; It was a big piece of steak with various vegetables on the side. Lightning loved meat, especially steak, so she was excited to dig in. &quot;Wow, it looks really good!&quot; Crystal was relieved as she brought out some red wine and the two ate together while talking about whatever came to their minds.<br />
<br />
After the two finished, Crystal took the plates and brought out some pie with ice cream for dessert. As they ate and conversated some more, Lightning&#39;s eyes glanced around the apartment. That&#39;s when she saw Crystal&#39;s bedroom. The door was only slightly ajar, but Lightning could see the room was also dimly lit with candles. Lightning took a big gulp as her body began to shake. She was feeling more blood rush to her cock, growing it more. Her testicles also shook as they trembled with huge amounts of cum. Crystal was talking about something, but Lightning couldn&#39;t listen. She was feeling her cock continue to harden and lift up her dress under the table. She was stating to pant and breath heavily, which Crystal noticed. &quot;Hey, are you okay, Claire?&quot;<br />
<br />
Lightning&#39;s eyes were darting across the room. Her cock was showing no signs of slowing down. The bottom of her dress was tenting up more the harder she got. &quot;I-I... I need to go!&quot; Lightning quickly stumbled up, holding her enormous cock pointed down. &quot;Huh?! C-Claire! Wait!&quot; Lightning ran out the door and dashed to her car. It was difficult to get in with her semi-erect cock. As she drove her cock kept growing till it was fully hard. *Pop!* Lightning then heard the condom tear off from how fat her cock was getting. Pre-cum begin to pour all over the floor of her car. &quot;Shit!&quot; It caused Lightning to swerve a bit. Along the rest of the way, Lightning&#39;s cock was beginning to sting. It was like it even though it was fully erect, it kept pushing out more. It felt like her testicles were producing more cum as well.<br />
<br />
When Lightning finally made it back home, she stumbled to her door. Her cock had lifted her dress up and was entirely in view. It was pointed in front of her, swinging side to side, dropping pre-cum everywhere it could. She quickly threw off her clothes and got in her shower. Lightning sat in the shower, staring at how enormous her cock was. Pre-cum continually flowed from the tip and down her shaft. She stood their for an hour and a half, waiting for her cock to go down. After getting out, she slowly dried herself, threw on one of her larger condoms, and walked slowly to her bed and fell onto it. &quot;That was fucking terrible...&quot; She looked at her phone. &quot;I had Crystal doesn&#39;t hate me for leaving like that...&quot; She buried her face in her pillow for the rest of the night...</p>
