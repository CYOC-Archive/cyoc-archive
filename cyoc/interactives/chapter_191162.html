<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Min woke up and carefully climbed out of bed wary of any wayward pizzas that might be too close. There wasn&#39;t any but, she couldn&#39;t be too careful could she? She didn&#39;t want to have a second tomato and grease bath two days in a row. She stretched languidly scratching her left breast as her back arched jutting her chest forward. Stepping away from her bed she picked up her clothes from yesterday tossing each piece into the hamper but, lingered with the panties in hand. She noted the smiling face of the girl on the back with a thought drifting across her mind. Could the girl really be that happy if at all to just be a pair of panties? With a shrug she tossed the panties into the hamper with the rest of the clothes.<br />
<br />
She took the hamper to the hamper down to the laundry room without putting on anything. Her sister wasn&#39;t due back from her competition until tomorrow so until then, she ruled the roost. After all, what was the dick and it&#39;s doll going to say about it? Should she clean those by the way? They&#39;re probably a bit nasty after a couple of days... Shaking the thought out of her head, she dumped the clothes into the washer and poured in the soap. With the machine starting to fill, her mind wandered aimlessly again leaving her leaning back against the cold machine. Today, she was going to invite her friends over to give them a private demonstration of her powers. They might&#39;ve been caught up in with everyone else last time since no one else noticed either. This time though, this time they couldn&#39;t miss it.<br />
<br />
It was still early in the day so Marcie would be at class and Kirsten at her part time job. Elaine may or may not even be conscious yet since she didn&#39;t have class today. Heaving a sigh, Min walked back upstairs going back to her room. Sitting back into her chair she logged into her computer and opened the search engine. Typing the name of the lady at the manor she looked at the website for the woman. Pulling that up was a surprise, she&#39;d apparently been some sort of miracle worker... The lady she spoke to looked kind of like the one in the pictures but, not really... Could be doctored up to look better she thought. Suddenly a twitch took her shin straight into the edge of the desk drawers. Recoiling hard as she tried to hold in the pain, she blinked tears out of her eyes. Fuck! The hell was that all about? Hurtfully and angrily she glared at her disobedient limb.<br />
<br />
Huffing, her attention was returned to the website at hand the physical discrepency aside... Her leg twitched almost threateningly toward the drawers. The woman really was beautiful in a haunting sort of way, the photos&#39; eyes seemed to bore through Min. There was a section of comments talking about her performing miracles for them but, not really anything specific. Almost came off as a bit of a faith healer type scam... Thinking on it though, all this powers stuff started after Min had visited about that job... Could the two be related? She balanced the thought in her head wanting to go ask but, not wanting to come off crazy like her friends seemed to think.<br />
<br />
Leaning her chair back, she put her arms over her head and stared at the ceiling. Was her life better now than before like she felt or was she actually in something crazy like a wild dream or coma? Bracing herself, her hand came against her cheek full speed reddening her cheek and causing her chest to jiggle freely. &quot;Ow... Nope... I guess it&#39;s really real after all...&quot; Suddenly getting magic powers didn&#39;t seem like something she could or should search up either. What if she was being watched and she was going to suddenly get whisked away into some secret cult or government facility. Poking and prodding her or even worse... She shuddered at the mental images that were conjured in her mind. She was brought around again by the noise of the finished wash.<br />
<br />
Turning her laundry around from the washer to the dryer, she came across those panties again. Damp from the wash this time, not because she&#39;d been taken advantage of this time. Impishly she stretched them distorting the character&#39;s face on one side and causing the faux lips to part on the other. Even if she didn&#39;t enjoy being panties, Min found the idea just a bit amusing. After all, the girl did REALLY want to enjoy Min&#39;s private areas so now she could whenever Min allowed it. Snickering softly, she tossed the panties in the dryer and finished loading the rest. The buzz of the starting dryer having sounded, Min went onto prepare for her coming visitors. This meant retrieving everything from the past couple days minus the drying panties for now.<br />
<br />
Elaine was first to arrive walking in like a zombie come to life. Eyes still half lidded, hair sticking out in cow licks, wearing one of her pj shirts, and torn jeans. &quot;Mornin&#39; Min...&quot; A sleepy hug was shared and she shuffled past to sit on the couch. It wasn&#39;t morning anymore but... Snoring came from the couch within minutes. Well, she can sleep till the rest of them get here.<br />
<br />
Marcie came to the door next some fifteen minutes later. Still dressed for class so leaving her body a little more on display than she casually would. Her blouse tented forward pulled out of her long skirt in the front. &quot;So we meet at the oh so mysterious abode of Min once again. Twice in a week too, must be a cause for celebration. That or your sis still isn&#39;t home.&quot; With a nod from Min, Marcie smiled and shook her head. &quot;Alright then, Min. I&#39;ll wait over there with Sleeping Beauty.&quot; She gestured with a thumb toward Elaine who&#39;d sprawled out on the couch since shed dozed off. Nudging Elaine&#39;s feet caused her to mumble and adjust accordingly at Marcie sat down with her laptop out.<br />
<br />
Another ten minutes later, Kirsten burst in the doorway totally unannounced and shouted &quot;Honey, I&#39;m home!&quot; She was still in her convenience store uniform, all blue and white, as she kicked her shoes off. Seeing the surprise and glares from the rest she straightened out her act. &quot;Sorry~ I just always wanted to say that ya know? Ah, to be so in love, we could have dinner together, maybe even fall asleep on the couch together~ Ooo, we could even do this or that together while the young&#39;ns are at grandma&#39;s and...&quot; She was cut short by at dull look from Marcie who gestured once more to Elaine. &quot;She&#39;s taken the sleeping on the couch option already, so settle down Romeo...&quot;<br />
<br />
Waking Elaine was always a chore, the girl slept so deep if she didn&#39;t mumble and move, she could pass as dead. Wake she did though, with protest at first and then, Marcie helped her up to walk upstairs. Together the the group entered Min&#39;s cleaned room and without missing a beat, Marcie had to comment on Min&#39;s impromptu body art in the carpet. &quot;Little dish soap and cold water a few times and that&#39;ll come right out. Next time you want to do body art make sure it stays on the canvas, huh?&quot; She laughed taking up a provided seat by Min&#39;s closet. Elaine flopped down on Min&#39;s bed obviously planning to go back to sleep again. Kirsten sauntered in and plopped right down into Min&#39;s computer chair spinning for effect.<br />
<br />
&quot;So whatcha got for us, Minnie?&quot; Kirsten spoke mid spin kicking off into another.<br />
<br />
Catching Kirsten and pushing her away from the computer with her antics, Min uncovered the objects sitting on the desk. Once again the trio was exposed to the teddy gown, the doll with its reverse pink horn, the panties she wore yesterday on full display, and the inkwell propped up for a full visual. Elaine started awake with a flush as Kirsten whistled in appreciation. Marcie held her hand to her head with a shake.<br />
<br />
&quot;Showing off your collection again, Min? I admit, you&#39;ve gotten pretty bold since elementary but, this is something else.&quot; Marcie sighed in exasperation.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah... Min, we&#39;re besties but, this might be... O... versharing a bit&quot; Elaine yawned the last word despite herself.<br />
<br />
&quot;Really though, I mean who need an inkwell in this day and age, right?&quot; Kirsten had already stood taking the inkwell in hand with plug popped. &quot;I don&#39;t even see a fountain pen or quill anywhere.&quot; She eyed Min conspiratorily as she plugged the inkwell and underhanded it over to Marcie.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll give you that this must&#39;ve cost a pretty penny but, I don&#39;t think I buy it being a person...&quot; Marcie examined the inkwell turning it over and looking very closely. &quot;A really pretty penny...&quot; She tossed it gently onto the bed for Elaine to look at.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow... I... I don&#39;t even know if I could afford to even LOOK at this in a store.&quot; Elaine&#39;s eyes bulged finally getting a good look at the object. &quot;I think... I think I&#39;ll just set this over here, yeah?&quot; She set the inkwell nestled between pillows with a gentle pat for security.<br />
<br />
With the inkwell passed around, the next item was of course the panties. Kirsten silenced the room by taking a sniff test of them before acknowledging the others. &quot;What? It&#39;s lavender scented. Oh... So I&#39;m weird for smelling laundry but, Minnie isn&#39;t weird for showing all this off anyway...&quot; With no responses offered, Kirsten returned to her casual inspection of the panties. &quot;Never seen this cartoon before... Mascot maybe? And this frills are just so soft it&#39;s insane...&quot; Pulling the loops around her thumbs she slingshot the pair at Marcie.<br />
<br />
Before Marcie could add her two bits, Min snapped her fingers remembering. She got the ID out of her pack and gave it to Marcie making Kirsten pout. &quot;There! This has got to prove it, there&#39;s an ID that shows the same girl as the panties. FROM OUR COLLEGE!&quot; She added the last bit triumphantly as Kirsten fidgeted about the doll on the desk.<br />
<br />
&quot;All this shows is a cartoon character... Min, this gets real kinky, near dangerously, when you put the two together.&quot; Marcie seemed to lose her snark in the consideration riding her voice. &quot;And then you factor in the subtle vagina sewn on the front... It gets to real pervert levels...&quot; She eyes Min rather sternly for a bit before she passes the panties and ID over to Elaine.<br />
<br />
Elaine was already ready to receive the pair as she&#39;d perked up hearing the design choice. &quot;Oh... Oh wow... Minnie, that&#39;s so bold... Is this character supposed to be you then?&quot; Her eyes becoming fairly innocent as she showed off the ID.<br />
<br />
Kirsten leaned forward to see the ID better. &quot;You&#39;re weird, Minnie...&quot; She paused and looked back to Min. &quot;But, I love ya anyway, I promise.&quot;<br />
<br />
By now, Min&#39;s head was fighting itself, even with the very real ID they still didn&#39;t believe her. What was she supposed to do then? Just how was she supposed to prove it to them, if nothing she showed them worked? If nothing she showed them worked... Showed... If they wouldn&#39;t believe what was in front of them, why not show them through experience? Yeah... Yeah... That could work.. She found her eyes tracking each girl in the room and settled on Elaine.<br />
<br />
There was no realization on Elaine&#39;s face as she pulled her shirt off revealing a moth eaten white bra with her right nipple sticking out of a hole. Neither did Kirsten or Marcie seem to mind Elaine&#39;s sudden stripping. Down slid her ripped jeans revealing a worn thin pair of blue cotton panties. She was kneeling on the bed as she worked at her bra. &quot;Yeah... You&#39;re a good weird Minnie, really.&quot; Her bra unhooked her chest bobbed free and still none of them bat an eye. In response to Min&#39;s strong desires, Elaine pulled the loops of her panties tightly and they came free with a quiet snap, her sex on full display.<br />
<br />
Even now, there was no response from any of the trio. Min stood gawking as Elaine practically flaunted her rich body at them without care. &quot;Elaine, are... Are you ok?&quot; Min asked trying to call attention to her nudity to them all.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m fine, why?&quot; Elaine blinked in confusion as she stretched again arching her body forward as if trying to help.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah... Ok then, you were just a bit quiet is all...&quot; Min tried to cover her tracks as Marcie piped up.<br />
<br />
&quot;What? You trying to work you&#39;re magic on us?&quot; Marcie gave a dry chuckle. &quot;Think I&#39;d make a nice lamp or maybe a pen for the set huh?&quot; She laughed as she posed a few times.<br />
<br />
Kirsten giggled with a couple of &quot;Ooo&#39;s&quot; and &quot;ahs&quot; as she pretended to photo op Marcie.<br />
<br />
Elaine smiled in response to the show as hers continued, now she was laying on all fours like it was normal to be that way. She eased her hips upward and back sticking her ass up high and dragging her breasts along the blanket until her nipples pointed forward fully visible. Her chin was nestled between those soft mounds as she cheerily continued her part of the conversation. Her left arm squeezing the side of her breast as her right arm snaked behind her seeking her sex. With a gasp she didn&#39;t seem to know she uttered, she started fingering herself right in front of all of them. Unsure of what possessed her to do it, Min took her glass of water marching over behind Elaine and splashed it over her backside. Elaine gasped in surprise as her body arched and clenched harshly to the stimulus.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoa... Min, that&#39;s kinda sudden don&#39;t ya think?&quot; Kirsten looked mildly concerned at Elaine. &quot;You ok?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Y-yeah, just a bit wet...&quot; Elaine smiled gently as she didn&#39;t seem to know she was lying for more than one reason. As long ran her finger up and down her wet slit, she huffed softly as her breathing hastened. &quot;It&#39;s ok Min, we got a little carried away, I know. I forgive you.&quot; She turned her head over her shoulder to smile at Min. Her fingers curled as if they had a mind of their own sending the tips flicking gently in and out. While Elaine continued to pleasure herself, Marcie made to stand up.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll get you a towel, Elaine. You shouldn&#39;t have to sit there soaked...&quot; Marcie spoke with a softness she normally didn&#39;t display to anyone. She sat back down at Elaine&#39;s insistence that it was fine. Wasn&#39;t happy about the idea though.<br />
<br />
Kirsten casually grabbed Min&#39;s panties and ID so she could make her own comparison of the two. &quot;This really is a detailed fake though, it looks so real... The Name wouldn&#39;t smudge like that though if it were real...&quot; She sat the panties back down while doing something extremely surprising. She laid a hand on Elaine&#39;s exposed left breast stroking it gently causing her hand to flick the nipple back and forth. At Min&#39;s dumbfounded expression, Kirsten shot her a confused look of her own. &quot;What it&#39;s just a friendly gesture, relax Minnie...&quot;<br />
<br />
Friendly... Friendly?! Min thought to herself as Kirsten groped their friend&#39;s tit like it was natural. Did they somehow think grabbing a handful of their friend&#39;s tit was normal? Did they realize she was nude after all? &quot;You... You know she&#39;s naked right?&quot; Min stared from the dripping backside of Elaine to Kirsten then to Marcie. Both gave her puzzled looks.<br />
<br />
&quot;Min... Are you trying to get Elaine to strip by soaking her with water...?&quot; Marcie crossed her arms with a grimace. &quot;I know you&#39;re Bi but, that doesn&#39;t mean we are...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yep, you&#39;re BI yourself on that one.&quot; Kirsten giggled like a maniac at her poor joke.<br />
<br />
As they bantered back and forth, Elaine was thrusting her fingers in as deep as her position allowed palming her clit with every thrust. Now it wasn&#39;t just water that dribbling out of her slit. Min had disgustedly admitted to herself that she was getting wet just watching Elaine. Where she&#39;d be a panting mess though, Elaine seemed to just go about her business without a care in the world. Suddenly without much warning her slit gushed fluid around her fingers as her body shuddered in orgasm. Yet, her face showed no sign of it nor did she stop her self-penetration.<br />
<br />
Getting a crazy idea, Min moved around front of Elaine taking her torn panties in hand. She then walked in from of Marcie covering her eyes with them. Marcie bat her hands away but, otherwise made no comment about their friend&#39;s underwear being stretched on her face. Tying them into a knot, Min hopped on the bed straddling the once again orgasming Elaine gagging her with her undies. Still nothing as she even tied them to her head and got down.<br />
<br />
Elaine spoke into her gag as if she were unaware of the obstruction, going as far as soaking it in saliva. Leaving Min at an absolute loss as shortly after she tried to speak again with a third orgasm wracking her body, she started to lose size. Slowly but, surely she was shrinking in front of the three of them still going about it like nothing was wrong. Watching Elaine shrink actually brought a panic to Min.<br />
<br />
No... No no no... What&#39;s happening? Why&#39;s she getting smaller? What did I do? How do I stop it? As she puttered about Kirsten and Marcie had taken up a side conversation, seemingly unaware that Elaine was now a full third smaller. &quot;Elaine... Elaine... Look at me...&quot; Elaine looked up and smiled as best she could with the saliva soaked gag in her mouth. She&#39;d dwindled to half her size now. &quot;Shit shit shit! Hold on, I&#39;ll see if I can stop...&quot; Min paused before she could finish as a fourth orgasm spouted out of Elaine&#39;s slit that remained full size taking up a quarter of her size. Her right hand still slick with her juices moved to reflect its mate when her eyes suddenly lit up. With a squeaky muffled scream of ecstasy, she came like a broken faucet.<br />
<br />
When the orgasm waned and finished, Elaine&#39;s slit was permanently parted enough to look inside. She no longer moved and her gag had shrunk along with her the whole way. Cautiously Min reached to touch then pick up her friend, giving her a testing squeeze. Her body retained some of its elasticity and its jiggle but, there was a hardness in there... As she turned the still radiating sex toward her face, she saw with surprise that Elaine was now hollow... Setting down Elaine prompted Kirsten to immediately pick her up without a hint of remorse.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow! Look at this kinky little piggy bank!&quot; Kirsten surprisingly sniffed the slit and recoiled slightly. &quot;Minnie... You&#39;re not supposed to masturbate with this kind of thing... It&#39;s for coins and stuff you weirdo!&quot; She giggled as she searched for said objects and upon finding her quarry... Stuffed a quarter into the slit that swallowed it as if it were alive. &quot;Wow, that&#39;s really fancy though...&quot; She tossed the rattling bank over to Marcie, who looked it over.<br />
<br />
&quot;Min, you really have to find a more decent hobby. I mean, look at this thing...&quot; She turned the bank&#39;s face toward Min. It&#39;s eyes were rolled up as its gaping mouth was kept closed by a panty gag. &quot;This is some really kinky shit...&quot; She pulled the gag loose and rattled the quarter out. Putting the gag back in, she took her turn with the quarter and shook her head. She stuck her finger in next attempting to get the quarter back that way but, the bank only seemed to suck her finger. She sat the bank on the bed next to where a wet stain and clothes were all that revealed Elaine had been there...<br />
<br />
As Kirsten actually made to take the bank for another search, she paused pulling off her work blouse. It seemed that she was next for the demonstration... She dropped her pants next with practiced ease standing in her lacy black underwear casually looking around the room. &quot;You know, Minnie. I really don&#39;t mind your hobby. It&#39;s honestly kind of funny to me.&quot; She giggled as she pulled her bra off letting it drop off to the floor. Her modest breasts barely even budging in their freedom. With her panties coming off next she sat on the carpet rolling onto her back. With an amazing display of flexibility, she lifted then crossed her legs behind her head. With a suck of both hands fingers, she proceeded to follow in Elaine&#39;s footsteps. Spreading her lips wide she stuck her fingers in thrusting firmly.<br />
<br />
Marcie didn&#39;t even budge, she even settled back in her seat having apparently forgotten about Elaine entirely. &quot;I don&#39;t agree with it but, you do you, girl... Whatever floats your boat as long as you leave me out of it...&quot; She lifted a leg over the over and sighed.<br />
<br />
Kirsten kept fingering herself with no signs of stopping or it affecting her. Min just trying to get a rise of either of them regarding this display again did something out of the ordinary. She grabbed a brush, leaned down, and stuffed in Kirsten&#39;s vagina right behind her fingers. Her friend&#39;s body tensed harshly at the intrusion but, her face belied nothing even as the handle wetly worked its way back out to the floor. &quot;Thanks, Minnie but, I don&#39;t really need that right now.&quot; She giggled again as she slipped more fingers inside her slit.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ve been acting strange since we got here and... Hell for the last week...&quot; Marcie leaned forward with that rare look of concern again. &quot;You good? You need some kind of help?&quot;<br />
<br />
I need you to see what&#39;s going on in front of you! A frustrated Min shouted in her own head as she turned back to to Kirsten who was now making a new stain on Min&#39;s carpet. She even spread her lips open wide with her fingers letting the fluids spurt out in wide bursts. She didn&#39;t last quite as long as Elaine before she too started to shrink in size. Her other hand joined the first in pinching and teasing her clit causing an almost immediate reaction in the form of another spurt of fluid. &quot;I think I like you&#39;re wild side though.&quot; She said cheerily from her half sized body. She grabbed her vaginal lips one in each hand and spread them wide open so Min and Marcie could see her glistening pink interior as she reached a quarter of her size. The last gush of fluid left her face in immense pleasure, eyes rolled near to white and tongue lolled out as she flattened as if crushed under a press.<br />
<br />
This didn&#39;t leave her completely flat though, Min swallowed as she picked Kirsten off the ground. She was heavy but, not like a person should be... Her skin was soft silicone wet with her last climax from a glistening opening between her hands. Words were tattooed to her stomach now; &quot;Kirsten&#39;s Wild Fantasies&quot; Worried about what she was about to do, Min opened the friend turned book to the middle pages. There was an artistically render page of Kirsten getting furiously pounded by a very burly man; &quot;Heroine Kirsten subdued by an Orc.&quot; The other page had a strange image of a rubber sleeve in Kirsten&#39;s naked form laying amid scattered gear; &quot;Heroine Kirsten made to serve.&quot;<br />
<br />
Min tossed the book away from her reflexively watching as it bounced off an ass cheek on the back into a roll by Marcie&#39;s foot. Marcie almost on cue picked the book up with a stone face right as she seen the cover. Without looking up at Min, she too opened to a random page and paused. &quot;Min... Why does this look so much like you...?&quot; She turned to show the image stretched across two pages. It was her entwined sexually with the Heroine in the book.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s got to be just coincidence...&quot; Min instinctively tried to play it off. Part of her cried out for Marcie to notice so she could finally feel the gratification.<br />
<br />
&quot;It even has your name, girl. Heroine Kirsten takes respite with Heroine Min...&quot; Marcie seemed right on the edge of realization. Min couldn&#39;t take the anticipation that Marcie would finally believe her. Much to her sudden dismay though, Marcie set the book on the bed as she unbuttoned her blouse. &quot;You commissioned that horny book just to self insert, didn&#39;t you?&quot; Marcie shook her head while she fought with the large bra cupping her chest. &quot;Damn girl, you&#39;re really freaky...&quot; Sliding her bra off, Marcie&#39;s precious orbs bobbed heavily on her chest. Both were as large as Min&#39;s head were squeezed together as Marcie made to undo her skirt. She stood up and dropped her plain blue panties at the same time as her skirt.<br />
<br />
Unlike the other two, Marcie stepped forward grabbing the bank as stepped right in front of Min. Her legs were ALREADY glistening with fluid when she lowered herself into a squat placing the bank beneath her. &quot;Well, since we&#39;re best friends and we&#39;re the only ones here...&quot; She sighed heavily as she squat down, her sex greedily sucking in the piggy bank until it vanished between her and the carpet. &quot;I&#39;ve got my own kinks to work out.&quot; She winked coyly as she stood again hooking her fingers inside her and the bank&#39;s slits. Soon she was thrusting the bank in and out like an improvised dildo. &quot;I really, really enjoy the stares I get... I just bundle up so much so I don&#39;t soak myself in class.&quot; She licked her lips staring at a surprised Min. &quot;Yep, that&#39;s the real me, a dirty girl who gets off on attention.&quot;<br />
<br />
Thrusting the bank hard into herself, Marcie continued like the other two had without a care. &quot;You know, I... I&#39;ve brought vibrators into class... Kept myself horny from start to finish without a soul knowing... That&#39;s... That&#39;s why I was so pissed the instructor failed to show...&quot; Fluids spurted from around the bank dribbling into a rain on the carpet. &quot;Sometimes, I&#39;d hoped you&#39;d catch me just for more of a thrill...&quot; Gasping in rasps, she bit her lip staring Min in the eyes. Pressing forward she pinned Min to the wall with her face buried between her breasts. Min felt wet not just from her own fluttering heart but, from Marcie&#39;s soaked crotch pressed hard against her own. &quot;I know you&#39;re Bi~ You could say I am too. I really don&#39;t care as long as it excites me~ Here we are surrounded by dirty things... All alone~&quot;<br />
<br />
Min watched helplessly as Marcie drew the dildo from the doll and licked it end to end. Giving it a hard bend into a U-shape, Marcie let go of the bank in her sex and pulled down Min&#39;s pants. A wolfish grin grew as she saw Min&#39;s bare and wet sex beneath them. &quot;Oh dear... Look what I&#39;ve done to you~&quot; She eased the dildo&#39;s other head into the bank and then rubbed the tip along Min&#39;s own slit. &quot;Just say yes~&quot; Min swallowed and nodded in Marcie&#39;s breasts, her yelp muffled by them as Marcie pressed the toy in. Keeping a rhythm, Marcie thrust the dildo into Min and into the bank consequently forcing it into herself again and again. She thrust harder and harder feeling Min writhe against her. &quot;Oh dear~ Keep up with me, will you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Min couldn&#39;t believe her situation this time, her best friend was taking her against her bedroom wall. Marcie&#39;s scent was overwhelming as Min felt a climax arriving rapidly. Her mouth taking in a mouthful of breast she howled into Marcie as she came first. Marcie just stroked her head in response. &quot;Good girl~&quot; She made as if she might be taking something off and shoved a nipple into Min&#39;s mouth. &quot;It&#39;s ok, I know you want to~&quot; Min really did... Really really did... And so, as she was encouraged, she sucked and teased that nipple much to Marcie&#39;s delight. Again and again Min climaxed and drifted into euphoria as Marcie guided her down to the floor gently. There was a wet pop and a thump as the dildo and something else hit the floor.<br />
<br />
While Min laid against the wall awash in the afterglow, Marcie had shrunk to half her height. She was propped up on Mins lap with the slick wet bank resting beneath her ass. Neither her ass, sex, nor breasts followed her reduction in size. She laid a kiss on Min&#39;s head with a wink as fluids gushed from before leaving her expression printed on her face as she fell back. When Min came to again, she was sitting on a sopping carpet with the dildo, bank, and a squishy silicone doll with overexaggerated assets. Turning it over and around revealed printed on it&#39;s vaginal lips; &quot;Dommie Marcie&quot; It wasn&#39;t made with sex in mind but, hadn&#39;t stopped her apparently. There was a pair of small cavities in the sex and ass but, not enough to really make effective use of...<br />
<br />
Min set Marcie, the bank, and the book on the desk and sighed contentedly. She wasn&#39;t sure if it was the fierce masturbation session or the sweet dream she had but, she felt fulfilled. As if a burden she&#39;d been carrying was finally relieved at long last. Her gaze couldn&#39;t help but, linger over the three objects with fondness. They were her prized possessions after all, as close to her heart as if they were her best friends. If they could speak, they&#39;d know volumes about her she was sure of it... In fact, she was sure of it... After all, they really were best friends~ She grinned then sneered as that blue glow reflected faintly on the computer screen. Ari would be home tomorrow~</p>
