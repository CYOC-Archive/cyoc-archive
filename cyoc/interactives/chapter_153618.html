<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Arthur took his seat and ate a bowl of brown rice and around fifteen pieces of teriyaki chicken from the local delhi, he still felt that odd tingly feeling in some places, but it seemed to come and go as it pleased. He wondered if he&#39;d been hit with something that just caused that kind of sensation. Maybe it was meant to just be a prank thing - maybe it was meant for some YouTuber to go and mess with people. Guess he saved some randoms from quite a horrid interaction.<br />
<br />
Arthur scratched at his head as his hairline moved up half an inch, a few very slight laugh lines forming on his face...but if anything the healthy and hale body he had worked on developed further. Pecs packed on just a bit more size, and his shoulders broadened out and started developing towards a boulder look.<br />
<br />
The gym teacher scratched slightly at his stomach next as his abs deepened and strengthened, obliques showing more than ever. He just kept eating though, and figured once he was done it would be good to go and hit the gym while it was good out. There was a report about possible rain later on. As Arthur finished and got up he would age another year - his first gray hair showing in his head hair and yet his muscles developed a bit more again;<br />
<br />
His biceps swelled half an inch, his triceps likewise toning up and pushing out, fighting his lats for some room. Arthur grunted and shifted his stance, wondering what that was, before deciding it was most likely just feeling awkward after a meal. Indeed as Arthur went on public transit to go to the gym, he noted with a degree of pride that everyone in the transit was it seemed staring at him. Not many shirtless guys in these spring / summer months had the full package like him.<br />
<br />
By the time he got to the gym, seeing a bunch of guys in his shape exercising within shirtless as he was, Arthur was stoked - and 38. A light patch of gray hair formed near the side of his temple, and though his hair didn&#39;t recede any further or lose ground on his head, the laugh lines and wrinkles developed slightly more. His body however was still developing well - beginning its ascension from merely being the form of a well put together gym rat to the look of a bodybuilder. <br />
<br />
His body was developing an almost insane tone across it, everything well proportioned and sized for aesthetic appreciation. The girl at the front desk almost seemed to stare for a few minutes before taking his name and letting him in. Arthur waved and kept walking, feeling good about this. And as he worked out, progressing from legs to back and then doing abs, he was feeling stronger than he had in some time. Everyone either stared or gave him compliments, and while usually people looking at him like that made him nervous, today he was feeling better for it.<br />
<br />
&quot;...Just means they appreciate my muscles...&quot; Arthur murmured to himself, not noticing that his skin in some spots was more weathered and by far less youthful looking. At 39, after all, he was getting to be developing into his middle age - a very, very fit middle age indeed, but one with all the marks and measures associated with it.<br />
<br />
The gym teacher&#39;s bodybuilder physique thickened just a bit more as he progressed, as if he was proceeding into another year of his physique competitions...<br />
<br />
12 reps 6 sets deadlifts... Arthur almost forgot how intense and almost arousing deadlifts were for him, the sheer exertion burning across his body from the shoulders and back to the legs just set him off exactly right. Owing perhaps to his bodybuilding or naturally high testosterone levels, he had to take a moment to &quot;cool off&quot; after his deadlifts.<br />
<br />
12 reps 5 sets lat pulldown... Arthur deeply enjoyed working his back and then checking out how buffed out his lats were. Something seemed off today, but he couldn&#39;t quite place what it was. He saw the tuft of gray hair and cursed to himself, wondering how he missed THAT sign of age on the horizon, and decided he was going to color his hair ASAP. Couldn&#39;t well have a hot girlfriend and not take care of appearances himself.<br />
<br />
15 reps 6 sets back squats... Arthur filled the gym with the sounds of his groans and shouts as he worked through a strong 275 lbs squat all those sets long. He was firing on all cylinders and almost felt odd with how strong he was. He swore it was like he was much more muscular than he remembered. Ehh, even if he was, it was a nice problem to have.<br />
<br />
10 reps 6 sets DB Deadlift... Arthur was feeling the burn quite intensely and he admitted he&#39;d never had it this good before. His every muscle was standing out on his legs, even his calves were pulsing with strength, and his back was swollen and strong. The pump was good, but there was a slight ache here and there that made him take a pit stop.<br />
<br />
8 reps 10 sets Calf Raises... Arthur was back in it to win it, and it seemed the aches were assuaged by him giving his muscles a bit of a rub and making sure nothing was outta line. He sure hoped that wasn&#39;t a portent of ill things to come.<br />
<br />
And lastly, 8 sets Reps to Failure on Pull Ups. Arthur almost couldn&#39;t fight through it due to his new heaviness in his muscles, and how tired he was already from this gouging workout. But he fought through and got it done, heading back out the gym through the front. He noted that the girl at the front stared at him again and he waved at her. Let her stare, he decided, she&#39;s probably never seen a guy half as ripped as I am and with these kinds of looks.<br />
<br />
Indeed, at 47, Arthur was something else. His body was in the peak of its bodybuilding form, but it was obvious that in time that peak might start to slouch downward if he didn&#39;t undertake certain measures to guarantee his furthered development. Arthur&#39;s hair was settled into a slicked back look that disguised another half an inch of push back along the hairline. His body was weathered and somewhat craggy, but absolutely insanely muscled. <br />
<br />
Arthur had no idea he was now physically of such an age, and still carried himself as if he was a 35 year old hunk just walking home with his shirt off.</p>
