<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>This is the correct chapter version! Sorry for the submission error with the flawed other chapter (Sarah faces her predicament).</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Blinking her eyes repeatedly, Sarah glanced at the watch that she was still wearing. Allowing for the difference in hours of this new world, she groggily guessed that it was now a couple of hours before dawn.<br />
<br />
I’ll have to wind it forward six hours, each time I go to bed… I wonder if any centaurs wore watches in this world? Evidently not in this village, cos’ we’ve not found any – but if they have any towns or cities, maybe there’s a watchmaker’s shop?<br />
<br />
Before her, Xanadu was soundly sleeping. Sarah reached out and slowly stroked his trimmed, brown-coloured goatee beard, admiring his handsome face. Then, using a nearby wooden support pole for the bungalow that seemed to double as a support for the former centaur occupations to get up from their bed, Sarah carefully rose upon her hooves. Stepping across to the window, she saw that the rain had slowed down to a drizzle. Only one of the moons was visible now – the other either lost in cloud, or maybe had already set. For a moment, it seemed to be covered in a blue haze – then Sarah’s sleep-blurred vision cleared up, leaving the moon white.<br />
<br />
She thought of the soulful song involving a blue moon. She thought of her own longing, as she looked back at Xanadu. After retreating to their new, shared home, Sarah had shown Xanadu practical things, such as how to light candles, and how to operate the flue in the lounge, and open and close windows. Then they had talked about their lives so far. Naturally enough, Xanadu’s life as a horse had been simpler to tell than Sarah discussing her childhood, hobbies, and careers. Xanadu had expressed sympathy when Sarah admitted that she was actually glad to be finally free of her strict, religious parents – who disapproved of her breaking away and finding her own way in life. And there was her frustrations that the way she’d been brought up made it emotionally difficult for her to find a man who was just right for her – resulting in her ongoing lack of a sex life. And when Sarah had finished, feeling tired, they had retired to bed and fallen asleep. Only for Sarah’s anxiety to rear up in that crazy dream – reflecting her fear of being left behind, whilst Jessica and their new friends had all found their own slice of heaven with their chosen partners.<br />
<br />
Now, in the near silence, Sarah could now hear only a few things – the light rain outside, including on the thatched, wooden roof; Xanadu’s peaceful breathing; and the thumping of her two hearts…<br />
<br />
Coming to a decision, Sarah walked quietly out of the room, and out of their bungalow. A part of her marvelled that none of the buildings seemed to have locks. Their centaur predecessors evidently had total trust and respect between themselves. <br />
<br />
It’s still like that in some places on Earth…, she mused. I rather wish it could be the norm there. A world without crime… Why are so many people untrustworthy? I guess now that I’m living amongst centaurs, all working together for our mutual survival, I’m starting to view the human race differently…<br />
<br />
Still wearing her den mother blouse, Sarah walked carefully along the empty streets in the drizzle. Her centaur body was still new, still feeling somewhat large and awkward – though she was finding her hooves and gait. And soon, she was inside the church, lightning the lantern. Using one of the wooden support poles, Sarah lowered herself upon the floor before praying to Epona.<br />
<br />
After some minutes, a gentle, feminine voice spoke to her aloud. Sarah looked up, her eyes blinking. The stained-glass depiction of her new goddess was shining with light, and the face was animated.<br />
<br />
“Thank you for curing my cancer, dear Epona!” she whispered reverently. <br />
<br />
“You are welcome, my daughter. You are wondering how I did it. My magic copied some of your friend’s… What do you former humans call it? Ah, DNA. Then I mixed it in with yours. That is why you and Jessica now look nearly identical. And I wanted you to be like her new sister – given that she lost her own sister, on Earth.” Epona’s smiling expression changed to one of concern. “You are troubled, Sarah. What can I do, to help you?”<br />
<br />
“I’ve just had a night-mare, which I understand you may know about. A dream reflecting my anxiety about having sex…”<br />
<br />
“Yes – I sensed it through my magic. I did not create it. It was your own mind’s creation. I felt your anxiety – and I intervened to allow Jessica and Josephine to talk to you, as you all slept. They both mated for the first time earlier tonight. To build upon what Jessica told you, you are not the only one of my children to have been a virgin by the time you were gifted with the form of a centaur. And those others – like all of the mated couples - now have no wish to return to being horse or human. They are all thrilled to be centaurs. I am happy for them!”<br />
<br />
“My goddess… Pardon me for asking – but apart from us worshipping you…, who gets to love YOU, Epona?” Sarah asked, scrunching her forehead in thought.<br />
<br />
Epona sighed, smiling. “Bless you, my daughter. You mortals do not need to worry about the affairs of gods and goddesses. The Greeks and Romans did not capture all of what Zeus got up to – and it would take me too long to tell, before I even discuss the other deities…”<br />
<br />
“Are there…other centaurs on Arcadia Centauri. Besides our colony? Is Rasputin…dead?”<br />
<br />
“Rasputin is indeed dead. She soon drowned at sea. And no, there are no other centaurs on this world, Sarah. In due course, the haras needs to spread out to occupy the neighbouring village on the coast. And explore the nearest town, to gather resources. In the coming decades, I would like to see my children spread across the continent you now live upon. It may come to pass that the portals elsewhere on Earth, outside of your native country, will transport worthy humans and horses to other points on this world.” Epona paused. “I cannot stay long. My magic has been used well, tonight. And I must rest. And then keep watch on the progress of you all. To intervene only when necessary. I am annoyed with myself that a bear endangered the village whilst I rested. Fortunately, Josephine proved her bravery and loyalty to the wider haras. Both then, and later on. And I have rewarded her by saving her life tonight.”<br />
<br />
“My goddess… Can… Can you help my confidence, for me to do…what you want me to do? To complete my transition into a full centaur, along with Xanadu – like the other fourteen couples have done?” Sarah pleaded.<br />
<br />
The face of Epona looked contemplative. Then her eyelids rose again. “Yes. I eased your anxiety – and Jessica’s - during the transformations you witnessed last night, as you pair suspected at the time. I can ease your anxiety again – long enough for you feel the rush of pleasure from your first mating. Do you wish me to do this, Sarah? And, if so, for when?”<br />
<br />
Sarah smiled. “Thank you, my goddess. You have my permission. For right now, please.”<br />
<br />
“Ita fiat” (So may it be) And with that, the illumination of Epona’s image upon the stained glass faded away. A glow drifted out from the image and merged with Sarah, making her gasp as her body tingled. Then, recovering, she beamed and rose – before bowing to Epona’s image, then turning and leaving the church, blowing out the flame in the lantern on the way.<br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
When Sarah returned to the bungalow that was now home to her and Xanadu, she wiped her brunette hair and dun-coloured fur down with a towel that hung in the hallway (evidently, this was what the original centaurs did, to recover from walking in the rain) – then she trotted into the bedroom. Xanadu was just getting to his hooves, looking relieved upon seeing her. The bedroom candle now lit and flickering.<br />
<br />
“There you are, Sarah! I was wondering where you were…,” he began. “Come back to bed and snuggle besides me again.”<br />
<br />
“Actually. I’m not tired, Xanadu. I want to…burn off some energy. If you are up for it, as well.” Sarah grinned at him.<br />
<br />
Xanadu took in his partner’s confident posture, her expression, and the swishing of her tail. “We have only transformed earlier this evening,” he pointed out. “I still have my instincts…carried over…from having been a horse. You…are no longer anxious about this? You seemed to be, earlier, Sarah.”<br />
<br />
“I have just talked to our goddess – and she has given me a confidence boost. I am still rather anxious…, but now I am ready for us to mate, Xanadu. I want us both to be able to read centaur script and feel at home in our new bodies. I want us to stand proudly shoulder to shoulder with our herd sisters and herd brothers. But also, as Abba sang… Voulez-vous. I want you. I want to be your mare.”<br />
<br />
“And I want to be your stallion, Sarah. I want you,” Xanadu replied with a smile. “Teach me how to love, now that I have the upper half of a human. Teach me how to kiss.”<br />
<br />
“Gladly…” Sarah slowly stepped across to him and took his hand in hers. “First – eye contact. Convey your love to me, through your lingering gaze. Smile as if you are imagining running your hands all along my hair, my mane and my flanks… Make me anticipate your touch. That’s it! Your eyes are smouldering… Now, angle your face slightly and purse your lips as we lean in together. Like. This.” And so, Xanadu and Sarah kissed – gently at first. Then again – this time, Xanadu instinctively cupped his partner’s head with one hand, and she did the same to him. He lovingly brushed her hair with his hand. <br />
<br />
“You are a quick learner,” Sarah complimented Xanadu, as they broke apart. Now, onto our hands…” And so, after removing her blouse and bra, Sarah guided her chosen companion into caressing her sensitive areas – particularly her neck and her pert breasts, whilst she felt also turned on as her fingers felt Xanadu’s smooth chest and felt the sturdy muscles underneath his human skin. He sucked in his breath, as Sarah’s hands brushed through his mane and found his ticklish spot at the small of his human back. She did the same, after he tickled her in the same place. Then, after another kiss – this time longer and more passionate – the couple moved onto stroking each other’s equine halves, particularly their flanks. Sarah smiled as she saw Xanadu’s quivering phallus emerging from its sheath – and she squatted down to cup and fondle his huge testicles, make him moan and paw at the floor with a forehoof. Then, nickering, and with her hearts pounding with mounting anticipation she allowed Xanadu to move behind her, to feel her equine udder and trace his fingers along her vulva. At her guidance, he flicked her clitoris – making Sarah yelp. Next, she screamed as he licked it. <br />
<br />
“Sorry! Are you okay, Sarah?” he called out from behind Sarah as she braced her palms against a wall.<br />
<br />
“I’m good, Xan,” she panted. “I wasn’t screaming in pain. It was in…joy!”<br />
<br />
“You are moist… I want to mount you. Now. To claim you as my mare,” Xanadu declared, his voice croaking with emotion. “But from what you told me earlier… It will hurt you for some moments? Because it is your first time? I do not want to hurt you any more than can be helped.”<br />
<br />
“Bless you, sweetheart! Don’t worry about me! I will tell you when to continue after you enter me,” she called out, catching a glimpse of his flushed face as she glanced over her shoulder. “Mate with me, so that we both become centaurs in mind and spirit – as well as in body! We will become fully equal with our herd sisters and herd brothers. We will claim each other!”<br />
<br />
I will not be afraid now… I can do this… I am ready… I am no longer a human woman – I am a centauress. And what I am about to do with Xanadu is natural for our kind. We live like horses. Runaway horses…, she told herself as she sweated, her huge body quivering with her need and her desire. Her tail swishing like crazy, fanning her sex hormones. “Claim me, Xan!” she urged him. “And I’ll claim you!”<br />
<br />
“Yes… And we will then be in love with each other. For life…,” Xanadu sighed happily. He fell quiet for a few seconds. Then, neighing loudly, Sarah saw Xanadu’s shadow rearing up on the wall before her – before he slammed down upon her equine half, making her grunt. Going by instinct now, Xanadu’s forelegs locked themselves around her dun-furred sides and belly. His position secure, he grunted as he inched himself forward. And so, his erect rod entered between Sarah’s folds…<br />
<br />
Sarah cried out, and then gritted her teeth as her hymen was broken. But once the pain and the flashing lights in her vision had both ebbed away, she urged Xanadu on. He obeyed, pushing himself in deeper and deeper into her vagina – until he reached her now-healthy cervix. The pair of them then thrusted and counter-thrusted, finding their joint rhythm. Xanadu leaned forward, so that he could grasp hold of Sarah’s right breast with his right hand – whilst he clasped her left shoulder with his other hand. He kissed her neck, his snorts tickling her mane, making her giggle – then nicker, snort, and whinny.<br />
<br />
“By Epona, Sarah. You sound like a horse yourself!” Xanadu told her.<br />
<br />
She grinned. “I’m surrendering to my inner animal, Xan! Just as you are…, are, aagghh! Ooohhh…” Sarah’s voice rose, as her vaginal muscles continued to clamp onto her partner’s malehood, squeezing him for all of his gift that was presently filling her reproductive system. Then the lovers found themselves building towards their climaxes. Xanadu nickered and whinnied. And Sarah joined in – her forehooves pounding the floor in her exhilaration. Finally, they neighed at the same time as they managed to climax together.<br />
<br />
With her vision swimming again – this time from sheer exhilaration – Sarah collapsed upon her front knees, with Xanadu still locked inside and around her. They panted together and gradually recovered at the base of their bedroom room. After kissing her neck again, Xanadu slowly eased backwards and pulled himself out of Sarah, with a ‘slurp’. Sarah briefly got up, to turn herself around. As the mental transformation flooded her mind, she began to notice the changes. And as his phallus retreated into its home, so too did Xanadu. He stood up and reached for a book.<br />
<br />
“Xanadu?” Sarah called to him, with a dopey smile on her face.<br />
<br />
“I…I can now read this! I could not before. It’s a cookery book. The goddess wants me to help in the cooking of the meat and vegetables we gather. And I feel a pull to helping Josephine in guarding the village – to be a warden.” Xanadu smiled. “I want to help the mustangs to adjust to their new lives as centaurs, as well! What knowledge has our goddess given you, Sarah?”<br />
<br />
She beamed. “Steve and I will help Jessica in teaching the children. And I realised that I could take minutes at the committee meetings that we should hold as a haras. But Epona wants me to work with my hands as well. To track down the potter’s bungalow, and take up her trade. And paint, too!” Sarah began to hum. “Now we are here…, in Xan-a-duuu.” She giggled as she walked over to her mate and clasped his hands, her tail swishing merrily. “Well, Xanadu was in ME – and you were wonderful, darling!”<br />
<br />
“I sense a musical joke. You will have to explain your sense of humour to me, Sarah. But tomorrow, after I have rested… Wait! Your movements just now. You walked with confidence. No hesitation or balance issues,” Xanadu observed.<br />
<br />
Sarah nodded and smiled. “Thanks to you, I am now a fully-fledged centaur. In mind, body, and spirit. I do not wish to go back to being the human halfling that I was. I am now complete, and happy! And I love you, Xan. I look forward to our future matings.”<br />
<br />
Xanadu grinned back. “Same here. I do not wish to be the horse halfling I was, ever again. I am now proud to be a centaur! And I. Love. You. My Sarah.”<br />
<br />
And with that, they put out the lantern. They both caught sight of the moon through the window, before laying back down together on their pillows and bed of hay – eager to catch some sleep before the dawn. Though they realised that they would probably oversleep in the morning. Oh, well – Sarah considered. Xanadu can whip up something for us in the kitchens, if we miss breakfast…<br />
<br />
And after she was lulled back to sleep by the rain, thinking of a blue moon and her longing which finally came true, Sarah dreamt again. But this time, she was able to control the dream. She and Xanadu were back in the hotel corridor – both them human as they headed, hand-in-hand towards the fifteenth door at the end of the corridor. They passed all of the centaur couples, still smiling and holding hands as they stood in their doorways. Then, behind their wide, closed door, Sarah and Xanadu jumped on the bed and tore the clothes off each other in their passionate entanglement. Once naked, they dived into intercourse as humans. And once they had broken apart, Sarah swiftly relived her transformation into a centaur – this time with Xanadu changing in time with her, on the floor. Then, they emerged back into the corridor outside, holding hands, with Sarah feeling proud to now be a fully-fledged centaur. Their kindred beings cheered and clapped them. As they made slowly made their way pass the other doorways, Xanadu’s herd brothers clapped him on the shoulder and slapped him on his equine withers and back – whilst Sarah’s herd sisters hugged her in turn. With Jessica waiting until the enthusiastic Starlight had parted from Sarah.<br />
<br />
“Welcome to the inner haras, Sarah!” Jessica whispered. “Now we wait for the mustangs to pair up and mate! Then all of us adults will be like the children are already – centaurs in heart and soul! Committed to the ongoing survival and expansion of our new kind.”<br />
<br />
“We are fifty-three in number now. A deck of cards and a joker. Probably with Marcus as the joker! We need another female, for balance, my sister!” Sarah pointed out. “No one deserved to be left behind. Or alone.”<br />
<br />
“Very true. But I’m sure that our goddess will think of a remedy…” Jessica smirked back, before urging Sarah onwards to be greeted by the rest of the welcoming haras…</p>
