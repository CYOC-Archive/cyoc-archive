<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The movie started, and Heather could tell by the shaky camerawork and the somewhat grainy quality of the picture that this was an extremely low budget film. Still, Heather decided she'd watch it. She was a firm believer that special effects or high profile actors didn't necessarily make a good movie.<br />
<br />
                It was slightly hard to see what was going on at first, as the movie took place at night, and in the woods. For the first five minutes or so, it was simply a walking scene. The audio seemed low, conversations were happening, but sounded like little more  than mumbling. Heather was puzzled at the lack of credits; this seemed like it would be the perfect place for the credits in a movie, but none were rolling.<br />
<br />
               The camera stopped as it approached a clearing. The sources of the mumbling were revealed-five figures clad in black monk's robes, and a sixth, a woman in a white woolen robe without a hood like the others. The camera focused in on the white-robed woman, and to Heather's amazement, she recognized her. It was one of her mom's friends, a thirty year old woman named Sharon. Heather understood why there were no credits, it was obviously an amateur movie. Heather was more intrigued now though; she'd always wanted to make her own horror movie, but didn't know enough people to fill out the cast. She'd have to remember to talk to Sharon the next time she came over to visit, and pitch her own ideas for a film.<br />
<br />
               The camera shook for a moment, and then sat still, the holder having placed it on a tripod, apparently, as the person carrying the camera came into view, a sixth robed figure, this one in a burgundy monk's robe. Heather couldn't help but snicker as left without human interference, the camera automatically adjusted for the low lighting, and auto-focused in on the action in front of it. The camera actually operated better without the amateur camerawork from its operator.<br />
<br />
               The lighting in the clearing was much better as well, and Heather realized she actually recognized the area as the forest not more than five miles from her home. The five black-robed figures gathered around the woman in white in a loose circle, while the red-robed figure joined the woman in the center.<br />
<br />
              &quot;Is the initiate ready to receive the final blessing from this Coven?&quot; asked the figure in red, another woman whose voice sounded familiar to Heather.<br />
<br />
               &quot;This initiate is ready,&quot; Sharon replied, smiling at the figures, opening her robe, allowing it to fall to the ground. Heather kind of gasped at Sharon's full frontal. Heather wasn't entirely repulsed by it, rather she was simply shocked. She'd been friends with this woman's daughter for years...and now she knew what she looked like naked.<br />
<br />
              &quot;Fellow coven members,&quot; asked the red-robed figure, &quot;The initiate is prepared; she knows what it is to be one of us and to become one of us. Let anyone with an objection voice it now.&quot; heather realized where she'd heard that voice before; it was another family friend, a woman named Lisa Singer. Lisa had a daughter around Heather's age as well.<br />
<br />
              No response came from any of the black-robed five. Lisa, apparently the coven high priestess spoke once more, &quot;Let Luna witness this new member of our family and coven, and let Luna grant her blessings upon her. Let Luna fill her with the power that Luna has granted us! Fellow coven members, cast off your robes and gaze to the sky, and cast off your human form as well!&quot;<br />
<br />
               &quot;What the hell?&quot; Heather muttered as each of the coven members disrobed, revealing their bodies and identities. Heather knew each one of them, and most of them she'd known for YEARS. They were all friends of her mother's, and all had daughters near her age. Except for one. At first, Heather didn't recognize her, but then she stepped into slightly better lighting, and Heather recognized her..it was her MOTHER, naked right along with the rest of the gang. Heather wasn't entirely repulsed by that, either, but that was simply because she had seen her mother in various states of undress over the years. She'd become rather desensitized to it all, really.<br />
<br />
                 Then the red-robed Lisa cast her robes off, revealing a perfect body. A ridiculously perfect body. Lisa's hair almost perfectly matched the freshly cast-off robe, and she stood proudly facing the camera and the other naked women, almost eagerly displaying her body to the. &quot;Holy shit,&quot; Heather mumbled, &quot;She's fucking gorgeous!&quot; It should be noted now that Heather was not (to her knowledge) a lesbian, though she'd had more than her share of erotic dreams about women. And as a bizarre coincidence, she'd just recently gotten quite drunk and kissed Lisa's daughter, who happened to be her best friend, who bore quite a resemblance to her mother.  But Heather's desires and actions to this point had never progressed beyond the occassional erotic dream, or vague wondering stage, aside from that one time.<br />
<br />
<br />
               All of the coven members stared skyward, Lisa included, and a simultaneous tremor went through all of them. A mysterious sound suddenly could be heard, an alien 'popping' sound. The women all began to moan, falling to the ground. The moans turned more to snarling, and Heather was shocked to see the women sprouting fur along their backs as they forced themselves to all fours, heading more to the center of the clearing and the initiate who simply stood still, never running.<br />
<br />
             Now afforded a better view, Heather could see the action much better, as the camera also seemed to have an auto-zoom feature as well. The popping was the sound of their bodies' bones reshaping and muscles growing. More fur grew over their bodies, and the women's nails became taloned. Their ears elongated and grew pointed, now poking through their hair. Their faces stretched slightly, jaws jutting out, filled with fangs, their noses blackening, their brows thickening. <br />
<br />
             The wolf women began to pleasure each other, and Heather was genuinely bothered, seeing her mother eating Lisa's pussy as another woman ate her mother's, causing a tail to sprout from her upraised hindquarters.<br />
<br />
             Heather was even more bothered when she realized her own hand was sliding down the waistband of her pants, and stopped herself. What the HELL was she watching, and why was she so aroused? The fully transformed wolf women pulled Sharon down to the ground, obscuring her from view, though judging from the sounds, it was plain what was happening. Sharon's moans of pleasure turning deeper, turning into snarls, turning into a howl.<br />
<br />
          The wolf women stood up, and with them was a new wolf woman, one who looked quite a bit like Sharon. They scattered into the woods, howling, save for her mother, who walked over to the camera and turned it off with a taloned finger. Then the screen went blank, the movie done.<br />
<br />
           Heather was confused; had her mother REALLY starred in a werewolf movie short that involved lesbians? Compared to the rest of the film, the special effects were phenomenal, reminding Heather of movies like &quot;The Howling&quot;. There was no way that anyone her mother knew could afford to do those sorts of effects. But of course, that led to the only possible conclusion: her mother was in a lesbian werewolf coven or pack or whatever. Could that possibly be true?<br />
<br />
           She was conflicted; part of her wanted to tell her mother what she'd seen, and ask for an explanation. It wasn't like she'd been snooping, or that she'd been in her room without permission. her mother was perfectly okay with her using the bedroom to watch movies. She and her mother had always had a very open and honest relationship, she felt confident that if she asked, her mother would tell her directly what was going on.<br />
<br />
            But on the other hand, werewolves rarely wanted people finding out about them. Her mother might indeed lie about it. Or she might lie to her if she was still in the closet about her lesbian side. Either way, there was still a pretty good chance that she wouldn't get a straight answer. Perhaps doing some investigation might net Heather more information?<br />
<br />
<br />
     Anyway...</p>
