<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">For Lynne and Gloria it had been an eventful weekend. A visit to the other timeline, meeting Lisa’s sister Kellie and finding out Morgan LeFay had attacked Gloria made for a tense situation at home. Lisa and Jason were trying their best to hold things together despite the difficulties. As the girls now began getting ready for school Monday morning Lisa sat waiting for the two teens.<br />
<br />
“Hey you two how are things,” Lisa said wearily as she layer out breakfast. Lynne shrugged as she grabbed some toast. “Okay I suppose,” she said. “Had kind of an interesting weekend. Nothing to crazy but interesting.” Lisa nodded leaning close to see if she could get any more information from her youngest daughter. “Care to share?”<br />
<br />
“Not really mom,” Lynne replied casually. “The thing is don’t want to damage the timeline and such so I should probably keep things to myself.” Lisa sighed in frustration, ever since Lynne’s explosion at her mother returning from the future that had been her response. She wanted the teen to open up to her, to build on their relationship. Unfortunately the girl appeared to be shutting down as far as talking with her family was concerned. While she wasn’t doing anything wrong she certainly didn’t want to talk with anyone in the house. It resulted in a situation where Lisa felt like the girl despised her for something she hadn’t even done. “Okay Lynne,”she replied sadly. “Just...be careful okay? I don’t want anything bad to happen.”<br />
<br />
“I know mom,”she said flatly. “I promise I’ll be on my best behavior. See you when I get home.” Without another word the girl rose from the table, grabbing her things as she ran to Tommy’s car. As she did Lisa collapsed into the chair, a look of sadness and exhaustion crossing her face.<br />
<br />
“You doing okay mom,” Gloria asked. Lisa sighed as she looked at Gloria. Unfortunately this was taking a toll on her relationship with Gloria as well. Lisa was going out of her way to make sure she didn’t show anything that could be remotely construed as favoritism. “Yes just worried I guess,” she sighed. “Has Lynne talked with you. I can’t get through to the girl. She’s shut me out completely.”<br />
<br />
“Not really mom,” Gloria replied. “I mean she’s not trying to hurt me or anything but aside from making sure I don’t do anything too strenuous we don’t talk. She..kind of runs with a different crowd at school.”<br />
<br />
Lisa nodded, ever since Gloria’s illness Lynne had treated Gloria as if she were made of porcelain. While she watched her sister to make sure she stayed well she didn’t go out of her way to connect with the girl in anyway. Gloria for her part seemed petrified of Lynne, it seemed the girl feared that Lynne would attack her if she felt even slightly betrayed. “Gloria,” Lisa said quietly. “I know you two haven’t gotten along great since that....incident last week with the older me but please let me know if anything happens with her Okay?”<br />
<br />
Gloria gulped as she looked at her stepmom. Trying to find out anything about Lynne could prove hazardous to her health, especially considering the threat of binding her magic. “I’ll....try mom,” She stammered. Taking her meds the girl gave her mother a quick hug before running for the bus.<br />
<br />
As Gloria arrived at school she scanned the hallway, immediately noticing her social butterfly of a sister. Despite Gloria’s mother Jennings last week, Lynne had quickly become one of the more popular girls in school. Naturally attractive with a spunky attitude Lynne made fast friends with some upper class men and some of the popular girls in her grade. The fact that she had also gotten Sasha to catch a three day suspension also boosted her popularity. Lynne had explained it to her new friends that she had let the girl hit her to get her in trouble, a half truth the others believed (most likely because of Lynne’s magic).<br />
<br />
“Hey Gloria,” <br />
<br />
Gloria turned to see Sasha waving to her. Smiling Gloria approached the girl hugging her tightly. “Welcome back Sasha,”she said happily. “How have you been?”<br />
<br />
“Fine aside from the fact your bitch sister got me suspended for a few days,” she grumbled. Gloria felt herself break into a sweat as she looked to where Lynne was. “Maybe you should just let it be Sasha,” Gloria said meekly. “Lynne isn’t that bad, she’s just going through a lot.”<br />
<br />
Sasha frowned as she continued to stare daggers at Lynne. “Whatever,” she huffed. “Enough about me though you doing okay?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah I’m dong okay,” Gloria sighed. “I took my meds this morning and I have take take some more after lunch but I’m not doing so bad. Just getting used to it.”<br />
<br />
A sad expression came over Sasha as she looked at her friend, as she was about to say something Lynne approached. “Gloria,” she said before looking to see Sasha standing next to her. “Oh...it’s you.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah it’s me,” Sasha growled. “What do you want?”<br />
<br />
“Just checking to make sure my sister took her meds this morning,” she stated, glaring at Sasha angrily. “She is family.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah except I think I care about her more than you do future girl.”<br />
<br />
“Lynne, Sasha stop,” Gloria exclaimed. Looking at her sister she could see Lynne’s magic was percolating under the surface. If she wanted to she could do some serious damage if Sasha did anything. “Lynne,”she said quietly. “Thanks for checking on me but I’m fine.”<br />
<br />
“Good to hear,”she said, still angrily staring at Sasha. “I don’t want you to get sick, I do worry about you.”<br />
<br />
“I appreciate that,” Gloria smiled. “You know we all have class together next why don’t we walk together.”<br />
<br />
“No thank you,” Lynne said politely. “No offense to you sis but...I just don’t like the people you call friends, especially if their violent.”<br />
<br />
Sasha grit her teeth as Lynne passed by. “Bitch,” she muttered as the girl strode to class. Gloria could only sigh as she watched her sister. While the two were on polite terms the relationship not only with her but with her friends was especially icy. Hopefully things would slowly begin to improve between Lynne and her friends.</p>
