<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was a 10 minute taxi ride to the Karaoke bar, They had been told that they served good food there and had made a booking. They ordered dinner and sat watching the amateur performers. No doubt later Alicia would get up and take on a song herself. Henry with his male voice but apparently female body was just going to have to be a spectator for the night.<br />
<br />
Just as their meals were bought out Henry had another surprise. Alex the golf pro arrived, and joined them at their table. ‘Fancy seeing you here’ he said in mock surprise as he took the seat beside Alicia. Inwardly Henry scowled but outwardly he had to adopt mute Rachel’s pleasant smile. <br />
<br />
Alicia actually seemed to be surprised herself. Henry had to give her the benefit of the doubt that this meeting had not been prearranged. ‘Ah hi Alex… I didn’t expect to be seeing you again’<br />
<br />
‘A last minute decision. I was at a loose end tonight and after you mentioned the Karaoke bar I couldn’t get the thought out of my mind. I love a bit of Karaoke. I hope you don’t mind if I join you?’ Alex glanced at Rachel. It was hard to read Alicia’s sister.<br />
<br />
‘Not at all’ Alicia replied. ‘It’s always good to cheer on friends and singing is certainly out for Rachel at the moment. What’s your specialty? I imagine you would have a very pleasant singing voice’<br />
<br />
‘I think you would say I’m a bit of a crooner. I try, but probably I best stick to golf as a profession. I’ll need a few drinks to get up some Dutch courage. Speaking of which, let me shout you ladies. Canadian Club if I remember correctly’<br />
<br />
‘Perhaps we could do a bit of a duet later’ Alicia suggested, hoping Alex caught on to her meaning<br />
<br />
‘I’d love that’ Alex replied.<br />
……..<br />
Henry had to endure Alicia and Alex flirting all night. He had to sit there pretending to be his wife’s mute little sister. At least Alex kept ‘Rachel’ supplied with drinks. Thanks to the knowledge that they had already taken the satchel Henry literally let his hair down. He drank everything put in front of him. <br />
<br />
Alicia was the first of the group to get up and sing a song. She sang “Hit me baby one more time” Alicia was an above average singer and combined with her looks was very popular. Henry recalled singing that song the night he had Alicia’s voice. There were chorus’s of ‘Encore!’ from the crowd, Alex’s voice particularly noticeable.<br />
<br />
Alicia still at the microphone seemed to be thinking what to do next. Then she announced ‘I will do another song but I will need a little help’. Henry imagined she was going to call Alex up to do a duet and was surprised as Alicia continued ‘I would like to introduce you all to my little sister Rachel. Unfortunately, due to a recent accident Rachel can’t talk, let alone sing but what she can do is dance. So come up here Rachel, you will be my backup dancer’<br />
<br />
Henry sat there stunned. He did not want to get up on the stage in front of everyone. Sure, he knew his disguise was flawless. With his ample breasts and hourglass waist, he looked every bit the young woman he was pretending to be. Wearing his silk dress and the shapewear there was no way that anyone could possibly guess he was male where it counted.<br />
<br />
Alex had stood up and taken Henry’s hand, Henry found himself led up to the stage. It was probably only because Henry was onto his third Canadian club that he did not protest. Soon enough he found himself looking at the crowd in the room. It was quite a crowd. Alicia whispered to him ‘Just follow my lead. You will do great’<br />
<br />
Only then did Henry look up at the screen where he saw the title of the song Alicia had queued up “Murder on the dance floor” Henry knew the song and had danced to it before, but not in the guise of a girl in a dress and heels.<br />
<br />
After a nervous start, where Henry found his timing was out as he tried to mimic Alicia’s movements he soon found himself moving to the tune and watching for cues on the television screen in front of him. He soon picked up the beat and the basic dance steps and was unaware when Alicia just concentrated on singing and left Henry to do the dancing.<br />
<br />
Cheers from the crowd, indicated he couldn’t be too bad so Henry’s confidence grew as Alicia continued to sing.<br />
<br />
Alex was quite impressed by the dancing of Rachel, she certainly knew how to move her body. She was a stunning looking girl even if she did appear to be a cold fish in comparison to her sister. Alex began to wonder whether how he could perhaps farm Rachel off to one of her many admirers and thus increase his chances with Alicia.<br />
<br />
Indeed Rachels dancing soon had several other semi-drunk girls join her on the stage and most of the bar patrons were also on their feet trying to mimic Rachel’s sexy moves. <br />
<br />
Henry actually enjoyed dancing at anytime but dancing with such an attractive body was particularly exhilarating. He loved how he had become the centre of attention. All the same he was relieved when a couple of girls joined him on the stage, that seemed to be the catalyst for the whole bar to get on their feet. The venue was really taking off. <br />
<br />
Alicia finished her song and handed her microphone to a man of Henry’s current height who was evidently up next. Henry went to follow Alicia back to the table but was stopped by an arm in front of him. <br />
<br />
‘Would you three ladies mind staying up here and continue as my background dancers’ the man asked of Henry and the two girls who had joined him earlier. The girls giggled assent so soon Henry found himself swaying to the tune of “Simply Irresistible”. That performance earned a resounding cheer from the crowd and the singer was asked for an encore. Henry didn’t know the next song but mimicked the moves of his companions. Apparently there were no complaints. <br />
<br />
Henry remained on stage as a backup dancer as another woman, then a man took the microphone. Only when he realised he could no longer see either Alicia or Alex did he decide enough was enough and get off the stage.<br />
<br />
He returned to the table they had been sitting at but there was no sign of either of them. Alicia’s bag had also gone but Henry’s handbag was sitting on the table reserving their spot. He decided Alicia must have gone to the ladies and perhaps Alex had gone to replenish their drinks.</p>
