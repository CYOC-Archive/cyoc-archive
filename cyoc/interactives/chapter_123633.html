<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The battle between Dymixious and the police was over and all sides were trying to clean up and put together pieces that had gone on in the battle. Among them was the ultimate issue of Dymixious, himself, two took a bullet in each shoulder and a third that went into his chest, and remarkably close to the heart muscle, if not straight through it. While the Moon Lake Police Department privately had no real qualms with Dymixious going to meet his maker, as the vigilante&#39;s actions had the Feds coming to Moon Lake in an official capacity trying to find out about Dymixious&#39;s connections, which wasn&#39;t something that was going to fit well in the overall atmosphere that had carried to Moon Lake from Lionel Ulysses&#39; arrest earlier. The Police really didn&#39;t want to have to jump through another series of hoops that would likely come if Dymixious lived.<br />
<br />
However, officially they did have to protect and serve, and that included ensuring that Dymixious got access to the best medical care that was available to him. Doctor Hiram Robblestein, the doctor who had treated Henry Jenkins, Huck, for similar wounds was on hand as the ambulance pulled into the emergency parking area. He was rather surprised with the rather reptilian nature of the patient as Dymixious was brought ought with a small bag of plasma hooked up to his arm on a small hook with the paramedics looking between Dymixious and with the route into the hospital.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d gotten a call from the police, they said they had a suspect wounded in the chest...&quot; Doctor Robblestein spoke slowly as he looked over the gurney that Dymixious was laying on, &quot;This is him?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; one of the EMTs spoke, &quot;He has one round in his right shoulder and another round in his left shoulder... but it&#39;s the third that&#39;s the most critical.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;His heart is still beating... but it&#39;s slow and we actually had to shock him once on the way too the hospital,&quot; the second EMT said to the doctor.<br />
<br />
&quot;Take him straight to the surgery,&quot; Dr. Robblestein said nervously, &quot;We need to get the round in his heart sealed up.... and sealed up quick.&quot;<br />
<br />
In this, Doctor Robblestein was very concerned with regard to saving lives. Regardless of whether or not they were criminal, a doctor&#39;s job was to save lives. And while the police call did say that this guy had been quite violent with the officers that were there to do their duty, that wasn&#39;t going to stop Doctor Robblestein from going all out to do HIS job. However, Dymixious was not in a very favorable position. Weres could heal from an awful lot, likely leading to the legends of the rather specific ways to kill a were, but that didn&#39;t necessarily mean that weres were immortal. While weres with proper medical attention may survive wounds that would be otherwise fatal to normal human beings, that didn&#39;t make the job easier. If Dymixious had to be shocked in order to keep his heart beating, that would mean that the wound to his chest had definitely gone through his heart. It may not have lasting damage to his heart, but it had gone through it, and while weres could heal from a lot, a major wound to the heart might just be a wound too far.<br />
<br />
With that Doctor Robblestein followed them in and moved off to a side near the emergency entrance and looked to the secretary that was call there.<br />
<br />
&quot;I want my surgery ready,&quot; Dr. Robblestein instructed, &quot;all nurses there and all equipment for open heart and open chest surgery ready as quickly as possible. If they&#39;re not ready now... they need to be getting things ready.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, Doctor,&quot; the secretary at the emergency entrance nodded and turned in her chair and was soon on the phone paging ahead to the surgery that Doctor Robblestein had the EMTs moving Dymixious toward.<br />
<br />
With that, Doctor Robblestein then moved to head to the surgery and be ready for the very hard work ahead of him, not knowing that Jade Drake was now in labor and was being rushed to the hospital so that Doctor Harris Jones, the OB/GYN who had been assigned to treat Jade Drake&#39;s pregnancy, could deliver the child. Doctor Robblestein&#39;s focus was on his patient, though he honestly wasn&#39;t sure if it wasn&#39;t to a point where there wasn&#39;t any more that could be done, even for a were.<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
Ryan Conner was a bit late in arriving to the hospital, mostly in the fact that he had to report to Chief O&#39;Hara on the results of the attempt to arrest Dymixious Drake, which proved to be as violent as expected. He was thankful that the only one who had been shot was Dymixious, but that didn&#39;t mean he wanted have the fight in the first place. In pure theory, if they could cut a deal with the Federal authorities, there was the hope that Dymixious could have been kept in Moon Lake, where his secret would be safe and ultimately some measure could be made get things better, but that was probably a long shot and would clash with jurisdictional issues based on where the initial crime was committed. The fact that Dymixious Drake had murdered Lionel Ulysses so soon after Ulysses, himself, had been arrested only added to the sort of chaos that seemed to swirl around outside Moon Lake and now seemed to be making its way into the small Washington State town.<br />
<br />
Once his report was made, he was tasked to provide security for the hospital, mostly to protect the officers that had also been wounded in the battle, but in a way, to also protect Dymixious Drake. While the Moon Lake PD would shed no tears if the man died, that didn&#39;t mean they weren&#39;t going to just let some random vigilante barge in and perpetuate the cycle of violence that Dymixious had engaged in. With that, Ryan Conner parked outside the hospital and walked up to the secretary seated at the desk. She eventually looked up to see him approach.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can I help you officer?&quot; the secretary spoke.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, I am to understand that a werekomododragon was brought in earlier, I trust he is being looked after?&quot; Ryan Conner asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, sir, that patient is presently in surgery with three gunshot wounds,&quot; the secretary answered, &quot;we also have three officers here as well...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, they all came from the same incident,&quot; Ryan Conner nodded, cutting the woman off, &quot;the dragon is a suspect who wounded the three officers and was shot while resisting arrest.&quot;<br />
<br />
The woman gave a small frown before speaking, &quot;I&#39;m afraid, officer that you cannot go into the surgery while Doctor Robblestein is performing surgery. The patient&#39;s condition is bad enough already.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t really intend to barge in,&quot; Ryan Conner answered, &quot;My instructions are to provide the doctor and the patient with security, and to double check with the treatment of the wounded officers. If you could let the doctor know that I am here to protect him remotely that would be much appreciated. Other that that, I will need directions to the waiting room near his surgery.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see...&quot; the woman said slowly, &quot;I can do that... first let me page some one down and they can escort you to where you can wait.&quot;<br />
<br />
What followed ended up being a lot of waiting. The officers were generally fine. As Officer Carter had suffered what would be some rather minor rib injuries as a result of catching Dymixious&#39;s tail in the chest. X-rays confirmed that no bones were broken to a point where they would have been out of alignment and thus if they had been broken, lycanthropic regeneration had already put the bones back together. A day or two of rest and then some desk duty was recommended for him. The officer who was bitten was a different case, while his abilities as a were were allowing him to fight Dymixious&#39;s venom far more effectively than a normal human would, the biggest saving grace for him was that the bite was rather open, when prevented a large dosage of the venom from even getting into his system. However, some venom was starting to take some effect, and the treatment on hand was only treating the symptoms and that wouldn&#39;t last forever. Thankfully, by some stroke of luck, Jade Drake was in labor and in the hospital. While she hadn&#39;t reached the point where she needed to push yet, she was in some major discomfort, but she did manage to transform and provide the hospital staff with a venom sample, which would leave the hospital&#39;s lab to synthesize an anti-venom. That left things up to the roughly five month pregnant werehorse in charge of the hospital lab, Dr. Kathy Tucker, but the hospital staff likely knew more than Ryan Conner and he left them to it.<br />
<br />
That ultimately left Ryan Conner pacing slowly as he waited for any news on how the surgery was going. So far, no one had stormed the hospital or tried anything sneaky, which he supposed was a good thing, but that wasn&#39;t the only issue at hand. After what seemed like forever, Doctor Robblestein came out into the waiting room and pulling a sea green surgical mask down from over his mouth.<br />
<br />
&quot;Officer Conner?&quot; he spoke slowly and sounding almost tired.<br />
<br />
&quot;Did he?&quot; Ryan Conner began.<br />
<br />
&quot;The shot to his chest proved too problematic,&quot; Doctor Robblestein said slowly, &quot;while the round only nicked his heart, it appears that in entry, it nicked a rib which threw off its trajectory, making the bullet rotate as it went through him. So, while the bullet still only nicked his heart, the damage it did was far more substantial... Had he gone straight into a surgery the instant you shot him, he might have stood a better chance... but... in the end, the damage he took was too severe.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see,&quot; Ryan Conner said slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;So... is that all you needed to know? Or?&quot; Doctor Robblestein wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;With regards to justice and the law... that IS all I need to know regard Dymixious,&quot; Ryan Conner spoke, &quot;though, I wouldn&#39;t say that we&#39;re left with an all together quiet scene... His wife is pregnant, and is here giving birth. And from a certain point of view, the man did wish to help protect our secret, but went about it in completely the wrong way, forcing us to have to arrest him, and now a wife has lost her husband and a child will never know his/her father as a result. And to top it all off, the Feds are on their way searching for this guy adding into the whole mess of chaos because the Drake Family seems to think it&#39;s still the 1800s where you can go in, shoot some bad guy and leave without serious repercussions...&quot;<br />
<br />
Doctor Robblestein watched as the uniformed officer only sighed.<br />
<br />
&quot;We didn&#39;t WANT a fight this morning,&quot; Ryan Conner spoke, &quot;we really didn&#39;t. Prepared for it... yes... want it, no.&quot;<br />
<br />
Doctor Robblestein could only sigh in frustration.</p>
