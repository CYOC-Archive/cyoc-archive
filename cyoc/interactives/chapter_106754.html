<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Wait a minute! Look I&#39;m grateful that you wanted me to join you... but I have my friends, we are travelling together. I don&#39;t want to leave them.&quot; said Brian.<br />
<br />
&quot;You mean the mean lady that stripped you in the middle of the town?&quot; asked sarcastically one of the boys.<br />
<br />
&quot;She can be like that... but...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Guys, guys... what&#39;s the problem?&quot; said Sam calling attention. &quot;We are the Free boys, free to be free. We stick together because we want too, but you will be free to do as you please. You can be a free boy and be with your friends.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Really? That&#39;s great but I still don&#39;t know what being a Free boy imply.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Damn it. Sam you never explain it properly.&quot; complained the boy with long unkempt hair.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s go to the pool for the initiation and we can explain.&quot; said Sam, the rest followed in tow. Brian and the rest arrived to an underground pool, there were a lot of the light crystal here and moss and flowers bloomed. There were some rocks and Brian was told to sit, Sam and others came with sponges and began rubbing the soil and mud off him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uhmm... there&#39;s no need for that... I can do it myself.&quot; said Brian self consciously at the other boys touching him.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s the tradition to clean among ourselves.&quot; explained the dirty blonde boy. &quot;I remember Sam washed me himself, back when I was a prince, Tommahn the First they called me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You were a prince?&quot; said Brian surprised, remembering that he was the one boy who was covered wallowing in the mud the most back in town.<br />
<br />
&quot;Crown prince to be precise, but I would have been an awful prince, my brother on the other hand had the knack of leadership, but by law I couldn&#39;t abdicate, so I was to become a dreadful king, when one day I came to this village looking for the council of a wizard. I was crestfallen when a young man which would have been a boy himself answered the door, claiming no old wizard lived there. He asked me about my problem, heh you can tell how bad a ruler must I have been if I spilled the beans to a mere commoner child. Lucky for me he wasn&#39;t any mere youth, Prince Tommahn never returned from his travel, the rumor spread that he was probably attacked by some creatures in the forest, when his horse and his torn clothes were found the next day. In fact Prince Tommahn did died that day, and Tom became free.&quot; Tom, the dirty blond boy ended his story and kiss Brian in the cheek. Brian was surprised but didn&#39;t recoiled from it, Tom got up and let another one took his place washing over Brian&#39;s chest while Sam still worked on his feet.<br />
<br />
&quot;The next time Tom and Sam both washed me over.&quot; said the muscular boy, on the better light of the pool room, Brian could see he had several scars that became more noticeable with age. &quot;Back then I was known as Kothar the Temible, leader of a herd of centaurs. I trained during my whole life to take over after my father Kathar the Terrible. But tragedy struck us and we were defeated not by an army as warriors but by magic mares, my whole herd was enticed by a magical corral of some good for nothing wizard, I would have been there too, if it weren&#39;t for two boys who I saved from a snake.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Saved is a strong word, we were swimming by a watering hole and there was a snake which he stomped on, Sam&#39;s magic would have protected us but his heart was in the right track. So when we saw where he was headed...&quot; retold Tom.<br />
<br />
&quot;They tried to warm me, and rode with me to were my brethren were... but it was too late, all of them were already fucking a mare. Tom and Sam helped me out before the charm got to me. But now I was heir to nothing, and my whole clan was done. I have failed. My life had no meaning, but they helped me, my brethren has lost themselves for pleasure, so I followed them and give myself to the joy. I no longer have the weight of my past. I&#39;ve made my peace, and I can enjoy life,  on that day Kot was free.&quot; he said he caressed Brian&#39;s hair, slipping his fingers down his spine. Kot did no more, and once again left the place for another to take his place, he was the darker skinned boy, he started washing Brian&#39;s arm.<br />
<br />
&quot;They were three the day they washed me. Back then I was Jakar the corsair, we worked with a kingdom across the sea plundering rival ships to sway traders to fall into his majesties desire, and for that we were handsomely rewarded. But I wasn&#39;t always Jakar the corsair, but Captain Jakar, my father had being Admiral for the king&#39;s navy so he groomed me from young to follow in his footstep, as such navy life is the only life I knew. I endure and in time I did became captain in the royal army, I thought I would made my father proud, but one day the princess of the realm took a liking to me, she was to be betrothed to another noble, if the affair was discovered my head would roll off, I spurned the princess, she didn&#39;t took it well. There was a great commotion in the castle, the princess accused me of attacking her and I was arrested. I pleaded to the king, and miracle of miracles, he believed me, he knew his daughter well, however, he couldn&#39;t let the princess lose face among the other nobles, so an artifice would be created. I would be dishonourably discharged, lose my rank and everything it conferred, and I was to become a corsair serving the crown in secret. I would have safe haven in his kingdom and after 10 years my crimes would be pardoned. I accepted. What choice did I had? The problem was when 8 years into my sentence, the king died and his daughter came to the throne, the next morning my protection was lifted, I was a wanted criminal with a reward, my own father came really close to sink my vessel once. I don&#39;t know if the king never told anyone about our plan or if the princess didn&#39;t care to uphold it. One night I spied that my crew was conspiring to hand me over for the reward, I wasn&#39;t safe in my own ship. So I left and crossed the sea, I capsized on the shore and walked away from the ocean, I arrived here, no more than a beggar,  and I found them. The reward for Jakar was never claimed, for Jak was free that day.&quot; he finished cleaning his hand with a kiss on his knuckles and other on Brian&#39;s neck he raised letting the final boy take his place, he started washing Brian&#39;s back, he couldn&#39;t see him but by elimination process it was the long black haired boy with green eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Before you I was the one washed, and I this is the first time I wash someone new. Back then I was the son of a rich merchant, and as people with gold usually do, we looked down on the peasantry. But I was alone on that big house. I grew up with toys and riches, but alone. I often went to the stables and the barns to speak with the servants sons, people my age. But whenever I was found, father would have them flogged and replaced to further jobs outside the main house. The rumors didn&#39;t took long and they started to avoid me. I tried to rebel, and my father let a boy play with me, Gus, it was a wonderful days, I believed my father had finally relented and let me be happy. But that happiness became a weapon against me, a few days later we stole some pastries from the kitchen, and father said we ought to be punished, except my punishment would be received by Gus, and anything I did outside of my parents wishes Gus would suffer for it. He kept his word, and worse he became even more strict, any small slip and Gus was beaten for it. Gus came to hate me for it, thinking I was doing it on purpose. I was under my father&#39;s thumb. On a business trip we passed through here, and we saw a group of boys playing, my father scoffed of course, but I only saw what I never had. We stayed in the inn that night, I couldn&#39;t sleep. In the morning I would embark on a ship and be with my father for a whole year learning the trade, this would be the last time in a long while were I could be by myself. And then they came, and whisked away in the night. My father did sail on the morning. There were rumors of him saying that he would disown his son for this, of how he was a good for nothing, only they weren&#39;t rumors, he shouted to everyone to hear, included a group of boys playing. Phillip was lost in the woods and disowned that day, but Lip was free.&quot; he said turning Brian around and kissing him in the lips. <br />
<br />
&quot;Now you know who the Free Boys are. And that&#39;s our secret. Now you tell us your story.&quot; said Sam.<br />
<br />
&quot;I- I- I was an elf... and...&quot; the others looked at him with expectation. &quot;Look the truth is before I came here, before being cursed with youth, before being an elf, I was just a teen boy in another world, I went to school, I had friends and I had a normal life, I haven&#39;t been through half of what any of you have gone through. And I see how you would want to be free, but, I- I am nothing special.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sam caressed Brian&#39;s cheek and planted a kiss on his lips &quot;We don&#39;t care, we feel that you are trapped, that&#39;s why we want to help you being free. And you have said so, you are not from this world, yet here you are. Maybe more than any of your party, you are trapped here.&quot; the others came around Brian. and started to massage him.<br />
<br />
&quot;I- I-&quot; Brian felt the hands of the other boys on his body, he never though of himself like that, he liked Christine, and yet this felt right, he felt safe with them. He wanted this to happen. &quot;I... I...&quot; tears came to his eyes. &quot;Thanks...&quot; he said pressing his forehead against Sam&#39;s.<br />
<br />
&quot;Say it with us.&quot; Sam said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I am Bran... and I want to be free.&quot; he said returning the kiss. he hugged Sam he didn&#39;t want to let go,  they kissed, Jak took his next kiss away, Brian felt how his member was becoming turgid by the moment, he felt the others own erections, pressed against his bare skin. Their asses, and his ass being stroked. He was lost in bliss.</p>
