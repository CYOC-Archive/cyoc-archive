<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Teddy and Marci were a bit curious on what they&#39;d overheard, but to some extent put it on the back burner for the moment. While Moon Lake wasn&#39;t a town in Teddy&#39;s jurisdiction with the FBI, he was well aware of the nature in which town governments worked. Just because local government was smaller than the national government didn&#39;t mean that they wouldn&#39;t have issues to handle. Of course, Moon Lake&#39;s issues could potentially be bigger than others, given that it was a hidden were-sanctuary that he&#39;d stumbled onto while trying to track down Lionel Ulysses, but that didn&#39;t necessarily mean that everything they&#39;d have on their plate related to that.<br />
<br />
Though, he and Marci had agreed that taking some time off for a vacation in the small Washington State town was a good idea, as it effectively solved the biggest hiccup that had been in their marriage. Neither of them had any issues with disloyalty or anything like that, but as a werecat, and thus a member of a mono-gendered were species, Marci, while she was bisexual, couldn&#39;t safely turn her husband. The werecat strain of the were virus would kill Teddy rather than turn him. It had meant that they had gone for years without a moment of intimacy between them, which Moon Lake, as a were sanctuary, was the perfect &quot;fix&quot; for them. Teddy became a weretiger, and the most perfect male one in Marci&#39;s eyes and now they could be together as both were weres.<br />
<br />
This had meant that both had enjoyed making up for lost time and touring what would be a possible site to retire to. Both of them looked forward to that and continued to enjoy walking around the small town. While the battle between the Moon Lake Police and Dymixious Drake was a bit of a surprise in that such an incident occurred in such a small town, it wasn&#39;t really too far beyond the sorts of things that he&#39;d been called to investigate with the FBI. He frequently handled murders in the area running from northern Virginia and into Maryland around Washington DC, and on occasion that did lead to some more major confrontations, and to a certain extent, Moon Lake&#39;s smaller size made for an opportunity to get away from those sorts of events. Teddy still held that position.<br />
<br />
As the houses, while some of them looked rather old, they were also very well maintained. The lawns were trimmed and cared for, though with it being after Halloween would soon mean that the potential for winter to arrive was possible, though Teddy also couldn&#39;t fully guess on what Washington State&#39;s seasonal weather patterns were. Though with the scents of the trees and such, he found it to be a nice environment that he wouldn&#39;t mind living in. There were some times on the east coast where even as a human he could smell all the car exhaust, which wasn&#39;t a good smell. Moon Lake was environmentally much clear in that regard.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s probably a local ordinance regarding parking issues or accepting offers from a company that wants to set up shop here,&quot; Teddy commented, &quot;as that&#39;s often what brings about most of the &quot;important&quot; meetings in small towns like this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Though... they already had a battle between a vigilante and law enforcement,&quot; Marci commented, &quot;with the way some things are going elsewhere... they could well be discussing the consequences of that...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Potentially,&quot; Teddy commented, &quot;though given that there hasn&#39;t been any protest of &quot;police brutality&quot; I don&#39;t think that is going to be an issue at this meeting.&quot;<br />
<br />
Marci nodded as they walked along. She might not work with a firm that did a lot of criminal law, but she did pay attention to many of those sorts of legal issues. Though, while she did follow some of those stories and talked with Teddy for his opinion on the issue, as he could see things from the point of view of law enforcement, she couldn&#39;t really judge the matter that wouldn&#39;t simply be her opinion. Though, that didn&#39;t lower her curiosity at what they&#39;d overheard. Sure, it was probably likely that there was nothing truly major going on based on what they had overheard, as that had been limited to only a couple of lines of dialogue from what looked like High School students, but that didn&#39;t mean she wasn&#39;t curious into what was going on.<br />
<br />
&quot;A shame we won&#39;t be here for this meeting,&quot; Marci gave a sigh, &quot;as I am rather curious.&quot;<br />
<br />
Teddy nodded as well. He was a bit curious about what they&#39;d overheard. While he didn&#39;t think that meeting would amount to much more than some local law that wasn&#39;t going to be that big, that didn&#39;t mean he wished he could stay in Moon Lake long enough to at least find out what this &quot;important&quot; meeting was about, or if it even was &quot;important.&quot; However, neither he nor Marcy really could. They&#39;d only gotten about a week off from their own respective jobs, Teddy with the FBI and Marci as a lawyer with a firm that handled a lot of issues that related to constitutional law. And while they both would have enjoyed more time off, taking the time off, for Teddy in particular, took a fair amount of paperwork to get everything in order, and he was expected to resume his normal routine on the coming Saturday, which would mean flying back on Friday.<br />
<br />
&quot;Me too,&quot; Teddy nodded, &quot;but it&#39;s casual curiosity… as this could be something that is pretty standard for small towns.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Right,&quot; Marci chuckled.<br />
<br />
&quot;And at the same time... even if it IS more important, we do have work that we got to get back to,&quot; Teddy said with a sigh, &quot;though..&quot;<br />
<br />
Teddy paused to look over at the buildings around them and the trees beyond them before he finished.<br />
<br />
&quot;...in a few years, when it comes time to retire,&quot; Teddy commented, &quot;I&#39;d be more than happy to settle down here&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Me too,&quot; Marci smiled as they walked along.</p>
