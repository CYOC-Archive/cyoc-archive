<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Naomi found it harder and harder to do her job, what with her clothing hanging on her like a tent.  She was certain the fit wasn&#39;t that bad when she&#39;d borrowed Mrs. McGee&#39;s old clothing, but this was ridiculous!  The blouse hung down below her hips, and the struggle to keep the pants up was simply not worth it.  There was something strange about this, but she couldn&#39;t quite put her finger on it.<br />
<br />
Even her shoes threatened to fall off her feet, no matter how tightly she laced them.  Plus, the effort of pushing the broom around was getting on her last nerve!  She kicked off her shoes and removed her baggy socks, letting the slacks fall.  Just as she thought, the blouse nearly came to her knees, allowing her to remain decent, even with the overly long sleeves.  Placing her discarded clothing in a garbage bag, she hung it off her cleaning cart and got back to work.<br />
<br />
It was a little harder than it really needed to be, but she had the advantages of youth and a high metabolism, not to mention after years of hard work, she was more muscular than one might expect.<br />
<br />
Wait, years?  She&#39;d only had this job for a few months!  Right?  <br />
<br />
Shaking her head, she tried to push the thought that something was seriously wrong here aside.  Eventually she got her section done, and she made her way to the locker room.  Time to get a snack and head back home!<br />
<br />
Opening her locker, she looked at her reflection in the mirror mounted inside the door.  She really was a tiny thing, and could easily, with her slight figure and small breasts, pass for a young teen, or even, with the right clothing, a middle schooler!  Life was hard at 4&#39; 9&quot;, and while she had no problems attracting male attention, it wasn&#39;t always the attention she wanted.  Most people loomed over her, and it had taken a long time to not feel intimidated.  Her ex was a big part of that- Joshua Kennedy (they had the same last name, but there was no relation) hadn&#39;t been the tallest man, but he was still a foot taller than she was, and there was a notable age gap.<br />
<br />
But he&#39;d been good to her, at first, and she didn&#39;t care.  It wasn&#39;t until later that his controlling nature came out, and she found out about his...desires.  Joshua had a fetish for younger looking women.  He wasn&#39;t a child molester, but the fact she looked underage made her perfect for him.  At first the ageplay and the cute outfits had been fun, but after awhile, his attitude changed, and him looking at her made her skin crawl.<br />
<br />
Even now, the memory of him touching her, or their having sex, made her shudder a little.  He&#39;d made her do a lot of things she hadn&#39;t wanted to do, things far worse than dressing up like a schoolgirl.<br />
<br />
(Really, though she wouldn&#39;t admit it, she still kept a lot of those outfits, as she had liked wearing them.  But she lacked the courage to actually go outside wearing them!  Though, thinking about her borrowed outfit, would it have been that bad to show up for work in a cute dress and saddle shoes instead of basically being half naked?  She frowned, unsure how to answer that question).<br />
<br />
The breakup had been bad, and she&#39;d been left with nothing.  Her family wanted nothing to do with her,  and so she&#39;d had to take any job she could get to pay for her tiny apartment.  And despite the restraining order, she often woke up in the middle of the night from dreams that Josh had come back into her life.<br />
<br />
She thought back to the discussion she&#39;d had with Brittany.  &#39;Men really do suck.  Maybe it would be nicer to be attracted to women?  Not that there&#39;s any way to totally change who you are.&#39;<br />
<br />
But the strange conversation stuck with her, so she figured she&#39;d see if the other girl was still around.  She got a candy bar from the vending machine to tide her over, and padded on bare feet down the hall, carrying the garbage bag of borrowed clothes.<br />
<br />
There was a light on in Lab One, which was odd, since that was Miss Olivia&#39;s lab.  Brittany was supposed to be working in Lab Two.  She knocked on the door before poking her head in.  &quot;Hey, Brittany?&quot;<br />
<br />
Brittany looked up, surprised, like a kid caught with her hand in a cookie jar.  She was looking at her phone, which was plugged into what looked like a Space Age hair dryer.  &quot;Oh, Naomi, you surprised me!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, sorry about that.  I was just heading out.  I managed to get my work done, even with those stupid borrowed clothes.  What a dumb idea, I know.  Sorry if you&#39;re busy, but I was thinking about the conversation we had.&quot;<br />
<br />
Brittany nodded.  &quot;Oh right, about changing yourself.  What&#39;s up?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know, really.  I&#39;m sure that was a weird thought experiment, but I got to thinking, would it be possible to totally change yourself like that?&quot;<br />
<br />
Brittany smiled.  &quot;Well maybe.  I know Olivia has been working on reconfiguring matter and it might be possible to reprogram one&#39;s mind.  But who would really want to volunteer for something like that?&quot;<br />
<br />
Naomi sighed.  &quot;Somebody who desperately wants a change in life.  If technology like that was real, well, sign me up!&quot;<br />
<br />
Brittany seemed thoughtful.  &quot;You mean that?  Because...truth is, this machine makes it possible, but...it&#39;s untested.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No way, really?&quot;  Naomi&#39;s eyes widened (which had the effect of making her even cuter).<br />
<br />
&quot;Really.  Though you need a target with the traits you want, it&#39;s like copy and pasting in a document.&quot;  The taller girl explained, while Naomi walked closer to her, curious.<br />
<br />
&quot;So if, for example, I wanted to be attracted to girls instead of boys, we&#39;d have to find someone else who is?&quot;  Naomi blushed a little.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is that what you really want?  Well that&#39;s not as hard as you might think.  After all, most boys are attracted to girls.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh wow, I didn&#39;t think...so you could take a guy&#39;s traits and put them on a girl?&quot;  She then blushed furiously as she had a though.  &quot;What about...you know...that?&quot;<br />
<br />
Brittany blinked and then she got it.  &quot;Oh!  Well maybe!  That would be an interesting experiment!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ugh, hard pass.&quot;  Naomi shook her head.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh it might be fun to try it out for a little while.&quot;  Brittany headed to a window of the lab and looked out.  Sure enough, there were still some smokers outside.  She scanned a nerdy looking boy.  She checked her phone, having figured out what some of the codes meant.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok, got it.  You sure about this?&quot;<br />
<br />
Naomi shrugged.  &quot;I mean, you could always reverse it, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
Brittany didn&#39;t know that she could, but she smiled.  &quot;Sure.&quot;  She selected the boy&#39;s mental traits regarding sex.  The device didn&#39;t have fine control, so that was the best she could do.  She noted his cock wasn&#39;t a bad size either...which would be good for her own &#39;personal experiments&#39; later.<br />
<br />
She aimed the device at Naomi and hit the trigger.  The beam of light struck the tiny girl and she put a hand to her head.  Previously, the effect of the device had altered reality and even the subject&#39;s memories, but she&#39;d found an option to disable those changes.<br />
<br />
Naomi put a hand to her head.  &quot;Ugh...that was unpleasant...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you ok?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, just feel like my mind has rebooted.&quot;  Naomi blinked, then noticed that Brittany really was an attractive young woman, with a rather healthy bust size.  She caught herself staring.  &quot;Gah!&quot;<br />
<br />
Brittany laughed.  &quot;It seems to have worked just fine.  You now have the &#39;male gaze&#39;!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh wonderful.  Bad enough I have to look up at most girls, now I&#39;m going to be staring at their chests.&quot;  But Naomi was only half-heartedly grouching.  She found she really liked looking at Brittany&#39;s chest!<br />
<br />
&quot;I have a few more experiments I want to try, maybe you should go home and rest?&quot;<br />
<br />
Naomi then...</p>
