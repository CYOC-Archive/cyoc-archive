<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The start of the new week was an odd one after you had convinced George to change not just his body, but even his gender. He was now a beautiful twenty-something blonde woman, with a slim and petite body. A far cry from the bald, burly, middle-aged man he had been before. Despite his initial protests at such a radical change, he did seem to like his new body and loved to flaunt it around the cabin too. He didn&#39;t have much in terms of well-fitting clothing as everything he&#39;d brought with him were designed with large men in mind. Rani offered him a few of her clothes for the time being, along with the offer of advice if he needed it. His glamorous looks and fit body received plenty of attention whenever he went into town. Men were offering their numbers to George left and right when they weren&#39;t catcalling him as he passed. The unwanted attention he kept receiving didn&#39;t take long to get on his nerves. After a particularly aggressive advance someone made on him at the pub, Colby suggested maybe he should dress and act more appropriately. However he was shot down harshly by both George and Rani for suggesting the unwanted attention was his own fault, followed by a glare after you snorted your drink over the table at their combined attack on the poor, older man.<br />
<br />
An even odder occurrence was how flustered you felt when you were around George, how you couldn&#39;t keep yourself from staring at his curvaceous body, and even imagining both your bodies intertwined in passion. You hated to admit that you were actually attracted to him! You had to keep reminding yourself that this stunning woman was really your best friend, the well-meaning prankster who continually bet you to eat obscene amounts of food. He was still that friend even in his new guise, stating as such that he still felt like a man despite his feminine features. Plus, you&#39;re a married man! Well your dad is, and even if you were beginning to resemble his portly older brother now, it would feel wrong to even instigate a relationship with another woman while you were him. Or with a man. Or both! These socks were really complicating the simplest of matters.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately for you, George could definitely pick up on your embarrassing infatuation with him and decided to tease with you as payback for giving him the shoes in the first place. He would lightly brush against you when walking past and whisper dirty things in your ear. He would sit around the den in just his underwear, generously donated to him by Rani, and would change to more provocative positions whenever you entered the room.He would make sexual moans while eating food, much to the bemusement of the others. All were successful attempts at arousing your sex drive, and you&#39;d had more than enough awkward moments alone than you care to admit. Even once was too weird to bare. In hindsight, you wish you&#39;d made him wear a pair of sensible flats instead of the high heels that were left behind after Rani went upstairs. At least then there was a chance he wouldn&#39;t have become so sexy.<br />
<br />
*****<br />
<br />
A few days after the change, you noticed that George and Rani were spending a lot more time together than usual. As he was so inexperienced at being the opposite gender, Rani was happy to help him with whatever problems that arose. You could tell that Colby was frustrated, and possibly even a little envious, of the time they were spending together. Late one morning, you came downstairs in just your boxers after yet another bad night&#39;s sleep. You were still putting on weight by the pound and at this rate, there was no point worrying about it. You were even feeling a bit proud of the amount you&#39;d gained in so little time. You belly shook as you bounded into the kitchen and found Colby sitting at the table, refreshed, dressed and impatiently tapping his feet. You stretch and yawn &quot;G&#39;morning&quot; to him as you turned on the coffee machine and started to make a hearty breakfast. He merely grunted in reply. You note his irritable manner and ask &quot;What&#39;s eating you?&quot;<br />
<br />
He dragged a hand down his weary face, giving his greying beard a scratch, and said &quot;Rani&#39;s normally up and ready to leave for her brainstorming sessions but George has asked her for help with something seemingly personal since neither of them will explain it to me&quot;<br />
<br />
You scratched your own greying beard with a smirk. &quot;You&#39;re not jealous of him for spending more time with Rani are you?&quot;<br />
<br />
He scoffed at the idea. &quot;Jealous? Of that knucklehead? Of course not!&quot; He chuckled heavily in an unconvincing manner. &quot;I just like to stick to a schedule and those two together are messing it up&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re on vacation, It&#39;s not like you have anything important to do later&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe not but it&#39;s still the principle of the matter!&quot;<br />
<br />
You nod understandably. His crush on Rani was growing more apparent to you, but it was also his business and if he didn&#39;t want to talk about it, it wasn&#39;t your place to probe. Instead, you said &quot;Hey, why don&#39;t I cook up some bacon and eggs for you while you wait?&quot;<br />
<br />
He looked longingly at the doorway, hoping Rani would suddenly appear. Eventually he sighed and said &quot;Sure, but not too much. I don&#39;t want to get cramps while on the hike&quot;. <br />
<br />
You cooked up both your breakfasts, including some leftovers for the two ladies upstairs, and you both chatted about how Rani&#39;s ex hadn&#39;t shown up anywhere in the vicinity recently. You all had memorized his car&#39;s license plate from the photo George took of it, and none of you had seen it in the town at all. You talked about maybe loosening the security around the cabin. You hadn&#39;t had a good night&#39;s sleep in days, partially from nightmares, and partially from the night-watch. Colby thought about it and said he would consider it. Half an hour passed before Rani finally appeared with George looking slightly haggard behind her. Colby grabbed his bag and bid you a hasty goodbye, pleased to finally be leaving the cabin with Rani. Meanwhile, George headed straight for the leftovers and scoffed the whole lot down.<br />
<br />
*****<br />
<br />
Finally the week was up. It was midday and Rani had already left with Colby on their usual trip into the forest, at the usual time this time, leaving just you and George alone. He was sat in the den in just a pair of bra and panties. You gulped as you took in his toned body and smooth skin. You sat down on the far end of the sofa, your soft belly resting on your thick thighs, and he gave you a nod hello. You clear your throat and say &quot;So it&#39;s been a full week now, I guess that means you don&#39;t have to stay as a woman any longer&quot;.<br />
<br />
George smirks and replies &quot;Two weeks&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The deal was you&#39;d pick the shoes I would have to wear for the next two weeks and I&#39;m a man of my honor, even as a woman. Besides, I thought you liked my new body&quot;. He crept closer towards you with a grin but you slid further back down the sofa quickly.<br />
<br />
&quot;I do like your body and that&#39;s the problem! It&#39;s so weird and confusing knowing this incredibly good-looking woman is actually one of my best male friends. And you&#39;re making it worse all the time with your constant flirting. Can you please just go back to being a man?&quot;<br />
<br />
George sighs &quot;You know, being a woman has been a lot harder for me than being a man. And I don&#39;t mean all the unwanted attention, and the catcalls, the casual sexism and, uhm, other stuff I&#39;ve experienced this week. I mean that I am a man inhabiting a woman&#39;s body. It feels wrong to have a vagina instead of a penis, to have breasts instead of pecs, and to be so smooth and curvy. I really can&#39;t wait to have a man&#39;s body again. But at the same time&quot; he mischievously smiles again &quot;getting to mess with you might just be the highlight of the summer! I&#39;m pretty sure I can stand another week of this body, but can you stand another week of it?&quot;. He runs his hands down his body and thrusts his chest towards your face with a wink.<br />
<br />
You stutter and stare at his breasts that looked too big for the bra that contained them. You grab a pillow to put in your lap and you mentally remind yourself of the construction worker George had been the week before. Finally you cry out &quot;ALRIGHT! What is it going to take to get you to stop acting like this and returning to the guy you were last week?&quot;.<br />
<br />
He strokes his chin in thought and replies &quot;Okay, I&#39;ll put on a pair of men&#39;s shoes tomorrow -if- you go out with me tonight&quot;<br />
<br />
The colour drains from your face. &quot;Wh-what? Like a-a date?&quot;<br />
<br />
He puts a delicate hand on your chest, playing with the thick hair that coated it. He leans in and softly says into your ear &quot;What&#39;s the matter big boy? Afraid you&#39;ll like it?&quot;. You shiver at his voice and try to stutter an answer before he cracks up in laughter. &quot;Relax dude! It&#39;s only to a burger joint I read about online that&#39;s not too far away. They have a special burger there with like 4 different types of meat and all the fixings. Plus if you eat it all in under half an hour, you get it for free!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course, another food challenge!&quot; You mutter breathlessly. You wipe away the sweat coating your forehead. This might be the first time you&#39;re actually glad to get a food challenge from George in weeks! It sounded though but if it meant putting this confusing period of your life behind you, you were all for it. &quot;OK, it&#39;s a date!&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;Great! But while we&#39;re doing this, I&#39;d like to make things interesting&quot;. Your smile falters. You don&#39;t think you were going to like what was to come. George stood up and paced in front of you, his small feet making no noise on the shiny wood. &quot;If you manage to eat the burger in under half an hour, you get to choose who I have to be for the next week. But if you don&#39;t finish it, I get choose who you have to be for the next week!&quot;. Your eyes widen at the proposition. You had planned to stay as your dad for the entire summer, weight gain and all! And knowing George, he wasn&#39;t going to let you off easy if you lost. He&#39;d tried on almost every pair of shoes he brought with him to the cabin, he would know exactly which shoes had the worst body. That is if he didn&#39;t give you a pair of the women&#39;s shoes that Colby had bought for Rani. Was this really worth having George back to normal, or as normal as he could be? Maybe you could last another week of his teasing. He turned to you and held out a hand for you to shake. &quot;Is that a deal?&quot;.</p>
