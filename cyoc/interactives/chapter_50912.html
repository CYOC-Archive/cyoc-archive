<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Zack looked over the transform that Alice had written for him to follow, and he liked it. Jensen was becoming hesitant to use the game because of the way the game was trying to twist things, and after thinking it over, Zack had to agree. Jensen was the Master, the Alpha Male of the pack. But, at the same time things would come up that might require them &quot;add&quot; to the pack. People could show up at the manor the only way to &quot;get rid of them&quot; would be to transform them.<br />
<br />
Now, Martha could dance, but that would depend on waiting for the New or Full moons, and if someone showed up immediately after one of the two, the Pack would have to hold that person for a long time. Alice or one of her cousins/half-sisters could pull them into the mirrorverse and turn them into glass pups like themselves, but Zack wondered how that would contribute to the pack genetically. Alice, Abbey, and Samantha were glass in the real world. They were only flesh and blood in the mirrorverse. Zack wasn't quite sure if whether or not the glass wolves could have children of their own when they were old enough to have children, and part of him even wondered if they would even age. But that was a different question, entirely. Still, Zack didn't think that an army of glass pups was necessary.<br />
<br />
And that was where his idea came from. If the game wasn't going to do what the Master demanded of it, why not transform someone who could directly transform someone, and not be limited by the time of the month, at will. That'd then cut the game out of the way completely, and the pack would still grow, and of course, the new pups and anyone they transformed would be completely loyal to Jensen.<br />
<br />
Zack hoped Jensen liked his idea, after all, what good subordinate doesn't want to impress or please, his master?<br />
<br />
++++++<br />
<br />
After finishing her review of Zack's &quot;transform&quot; for his parents, Alice returned to the office where Jensen was waiting. The triplets were there with him, and Alice smiled at seeing her mother and aunts. She found it odd that Kaylee was not there, as the Alpha Female was usually right beside Jensen when he decided something or issued orders, but then she remembered that Kaylee was playing with her own pups today. The gem colored wolves, and Caroline, now Cobalt, were there as well.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you remember where the island is, Alice?&quot; Jensen asked as the glass wolf entered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, father,&quot; Alice answered, &quot;I remember.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good,&quot; Jensen answered and then turned to Cobalt and Opal, &quot;Alice will take you to our island retreat through the mirrorverse. You'll likely emerge out of a portion of the water where the water is reflective. If that is too much of a problem, a small mirror will be necessary.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cobalt cut Jensen off by lifting up a small hand held mirror that she had found somewhere in the house. Jensen only nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Once there you are to assess the situation as quickly as possible,&quot; Jensen spoke, &quot;You will have to WAIT if supplies for construction are needed. And if that is the case, be exact in how much will be required. I can not have Alice or one of her sisters staying permanently there while you work. They will help you get between the island and the manor as necessary, but they are not your errand girls.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If we are to construct anything, I doubt we'd be doing that today, Master,&quot; Opal spoke politely, &quot;We need to check out the island first. See where it would be safe to build anything, and what will likely need to be done to make it possible for the deer to subsist in a habitat that would be unnatural to them. Any sort of construction wouldn't be started till tomorrow, local time. And that is at the absolute earliest&quot;<br />
<br />
Jensen didn't answer immediately.<br />
<br />
&quot;This island is in the middle of nowhere, is it not?&quot; Opal asked<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That means that wherever the island is, it is not in Glendale's time zone,&quot; Opal explained, &quot;it could be daybreak here, but dusk there. That is all. I had thought you wished to time things by Glendale's locality.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jensen nodded, &quot;I do. Alice or one of her sisters will be by to get you at dinner time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course, Master,&quot; Opal nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;You may take them to the island now, Alice,&quot; Jensen gestured toward the mirror set up in the office.<br />
<br />
Alice nodded and then turned to the gem colored wolves.<br />
<br />
&quot;It would be best if you all held hands,&quot; Alice spoke, &quot;that way, I may bring you all into the mirrorverse at once.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Will it hurt?&quot; Amber asked, sounding slightly nervous.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, it does not hurt, and it will not affect you as you are part of the pack,&quot; Alice answered and held out her paws.<br />
<br />
The gem wolves slowly and hesitantly took them, or one of their neighbor's until there where two lines of wolves holding onto Alice's paws. She then quietly walked toward the mirror, leading Opal and Cobalt.<br />
<br />
Entering the mirror was much like it always was for Alice, although this was the first time that anyone besides her mother and aunts had come into the mirrorverse that wasn't connected to the pups in someway. She noticed a few looks of surprise as she transitioned from nearly transparent glass into a blond pup in a blue and white dress. Alice was about to explain that this was merely how she looked in the mirrorverse, when she was interrupted by a startled yelp.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my word, I'm in a dress!&quot; came Garnet's voice from somewhere in the line.<br />
<br />
And indeed, all of the gem colored wolves were clothed, again. Although the attire differed from what her mother and aunts wore in the mirrorverse. Her mother and aunts wore what one would assume to be the attire of an upper class woman of the Victorian Era, and Alice thought the triplets looked very pretty in their dresses, even if Julie's was green. <br />
<br />
The gem colored wolves were all in attire better suited to the working class of the same time period. The females were in very plain dresses that covered everything and allowed for some freedom of movement, but held little in the way of decoration. Jasper and Opal were dressed in work pants and shirt of a 1800s working class workman. Unlike the dresses that Fran, Darla, and Julie wore, the clothing now on the gem colored wolves also matched their fur perfectly.<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess this is a facet of the mirrorverse,&quot; Alice sighed, &quot;Everyone who comes in is clothed again while in it. Please do not let go of my hand or the hand of anyone else in line.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's weird,&quot; said Ruby, &quot;it's even modified everything so my tail fits...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It would be better then having it not fit properly,&quot; Alice spoke, &quot;and now for the three steps.&quot;<br />
<br />
The gem colored wolves then looked at each other as Alice took the three steps to take them to the island. They were all amazed by blur of motion that passed by them. When it stopped, the found they were looking up toward the sky while still holding Alice's paws.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why aren't we wet?&quot; came Amethyst's voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Because we are still in the mirrorverse,&quot; Alice explained, &quot;I will move us closer to the island so that way you are not drenched upon returning to the outside world.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You mean the real world?&quot; Tourmaline asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;This world is real, is it not? It is here, is it not?&quot; Alice retorted, &quot;How is it not real?&quot;<br />
<br />
None of the gem colored wolves could answer that question. And in the time, Alice had come to a shallow spot where if they got wet at all, it would only be their feet. She then pulled them toward the surface tension and out of the mirrorverse through it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Amazing,&quot; Jasper said as he noticed their instant return to their naked forms.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes it is,&quot; Alice nodded, &quot;I will leave you to your work to start for today. I or one of my sisters will be by to pick you up for dinner. Do you require anything?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I wouldn't think so,&quot; Opal told the glass wolf, &quot;as I told the Master, we'll mostly be checking things out today.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And we have the small mirror for you and your sisters to use as a gateway,&quot; Cobalt added.<br />
<br />
&quot;Once Zack's parents join the pack we will give you his cell-phone,&quot; Alice promised, &quot;you can call the estate's line directly on it, if you run into anything difficult.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The only think difficult would be the coverage on it,&quot; Cobalt commented, &quot;and the company may eventually decide to discontinue service to that phone when Zack doesn't pay their monthly bill.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We can get the job done in time,&quot; Opal promised, stroking one of Cobalt's shoulders to reassure her, &quot;if it is what the master wants, then it will be done.&quot;<br />
<br />
Opal then turned to the other flesh and blood wolves there.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright ladies and Jasper,&quot; Opal spoke, &quot;we have survey work to do before dinner. Let's get to it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alice, let them get to work, and returned to the mirrorverse to return to the manor and her sisters and their tour.</p>
