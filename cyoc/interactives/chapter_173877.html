<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jenny instantly was overcome with both a feeling of self loathing for wasting her golden opportunity, and excitement that her new kink was now being taken advantage of in full. It was the latter one that eventually won out though, causing Jenny to break out into an eager smile as she began panting with lustful anticipation. Needless to say, this wasn&#39;t the reaction Kyle was expecting, and caused her to take a step back, almost falling due to her not being familier walking in heels. But she managed to quickly recover her balance and regain her superior demeanor. But while she may look the part, mentally, she was still struggling to cope with what just happened, even with her new personality forcing her to act in certain ways.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, well... fuck that is not the reaction that I was expecting. But fine, you at least seem on board with all of this, not like you have any say in the matter anymore. You must be such a huge masochist to intentionally screw yourself over when you had the advantage. But I can role with it. So what if I am an amazon now? I am hot and sexy as fuck. So this is not really a bad thing. Plus... your wording made me a little bit special.&quot; Smerked Kyle as she pulled down her panties. <br />
<br />
Jenny watched as her clit suddenly grew to a massive size, easily extending out over a foot and was likely 2 inches in diameter minimum. &quot;Oh yeah, this baby will do just fine. Fuck it is so much better than my punny little dicklet from before, and feels 3 times as good too. Hmm hmm, just look at you. Drooling all over yourself like a bitch staring at a steak. &quot; Kyle approaches Jenny and puts her right heel onto her face and slowly pushes her until Jenny falls over backwards. She still is panting heavily, and her pussy had become very wet with excitement when she watched Kyle&#39;s clit grow before. Now it was trickling down her ass crack and forming a pool beneath her. She was so horny. Her beloved Mistress was playing with her. Pushing her heel against her face like she was a door mat. It was exactly what she hoped for.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now Jenny, I require a chair as my legs are tired from walking in these gorgeous heels.&quot; Embellished Kyle, emphasizing her legs and feet with her hands. &quot;And it would seem my clit has swollen up again and is in need of some service.&quot; <br />
<br />
Jenny quickly got up onto her knees and held her hands out in front of her, palms up and at neck height. She opened up her mouth as wide as possible too. Finally, she felt her feet bend backwards and her ankles extend, creating a literal set of foot rests. Kyle took a seat ontop of Jenny&#39;s hands and slid her clit into Jenny&#39;s mouth until their lips touched. Lastly she placed her high heeled feet up onto Jenny&#39;s own feet. Jenny felt Kyle pull on her hair as she wrapped it around her back. Surprisingly, it didnt fall, but instead acted like it was a hard object as Kyle leaned backwards into it. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yep, you make for an excellent chair, Slut. Say, how does my clit taste? Pretty god damn amazing I bet.&quot; Berated Kyle as she wiggled her ass around in order to squish it into Jenny&#39;s hands even more. <br />
<br />
Truth be told, it tasted aweful. She could tell it was very dirty, salty, and unwashed as Kyle hadn&#39;t showered after gym class. And she was absolutely loving it, especially the taste. She would love it even if it didn&#39;t taste terrible. It was the taste of her Mistress, how could she hate it? Jenny realized that the longer this went on, the deeper she would fall and the closer she would get to becomming a hopeless masochist. How long would it be until any and all forms of abuse was taken as a positive that brought her immense amounts of pleasure? How long until the concept of becoming a toilet made her mouth water as she looked forward to consuming all of Kyle&#39;s piss and shit? Actually she may be well on her way already, as she remembered how Kyle&#39;s piss had tasted earlier, and found that she was craving for another round.<br />
<br />
Kyle only sat for a few minutes. Just long enough to get her point across. When she stood up, her clit pulled out of Jenny&#39;s mouth, which kept the &quot;O&quot; shape for another few seconds, before it returned to her lustful panting with her tongue hanging out. <br />
<br />
Seeing her like that, Kyle felt that everything was still working out in her favor. Even though she was a she now, it wasn&#39;t too bad. In fact, the more time she spend in this body, the more she found that she loved it and never wanted to return to being her scrawny weak male self. &quot;Guess I should find a new, better fitting name to call myself. Perhapse Kylie? Or maybe Kaylin? Kaitlyn, Kayla. There are so many options.&quot; Mused Kyle. In the end though, she decided to go with Kalyna, as it was kind of unique.<br />
<br />
Kalyna looked at her toy. Jenny was still a panting mess, but she loved that part most about her. <br />
<br />
....Love? When did she ever love Jenny? As much as Kalyna tried, she could deny the feelings of absolute affection she now felt towards Jenny. She was head over heels for the girl but couldn&#39;t understand why she felt so strongly about her. Then she remembered Jenny&#39;s dare. The way she worded it! It seemed that whenever Kalyna was currently not using Jenny as an appliance or something, she would only be able to see her as her lover. In other words, Kalyna no longer hated Jenny. On the contrary, she now adored her above all others. And she loved to make her as happy as possible, by abusing  her to play off of her insane levels of masochism. &quot;Oh this was going to be a lot of fun.&quot; Thought Kalyna with a wicked grin.</p>
