<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">When the Halloween dance was finally over, the last thing Peter Talbot and his new fiance Karen Talbot wanted to do was say goodbye for the evening.<br />
But Peter insisted on being a gentleman, so drove Karen back to her dorm room at Moon Lake College.<br />
He walked her right up to the front door of the dormitory, yet it was a very long time before their lips finally ended what was supposed to be a single &quot;good night&quot; kiss.<br />
Only the security guard on patrol wanting to see their IDs ended their romantic night, but the couple knew they would pick up anew in the morning.<br />
<br />
Karen tried to sleep that night, but found the task hard to accomplish.<br />
It wasn&#39;t just the restless anticipation of becoming Mrs. Karen Talbot next February, let alone Peter&#39;s promise to usher her into were society this coming weekend as his werelioness.<br />
It was also the excitement surrounding the fact that her roommate and best friend Jenny Harper was not only a werevixen, but now Mrs. Jenny Jenkins and happily married to the werefox of her dreams, despite Dieter Wilhelm and Jenny&#39;s father trying to prevent the wedding.<br />
<i>At least her dad didn&#39;t know about that bastard trying to kill Harry, let alone almost murdering his brother Huck in a case of mistaken identity,</i> was about the only comfort Karen could take from the situation, other than the fact it was over and the newlyweds were on their (unfortunately brief) honeymoon.<br />
Karen would see Jenny at school Monday, if not in their dorm room for a while longer, because the apartment the Jenkins were planning to move into over his parents&#39; garage wasn&#39;t finished yet.<br />
<br />
If Karen Yuletide did get any sleep that night, her rest was full of dreams of the future.<br />
She pictured herself on Peter&#39;s arm, by his side, in his life and he in hers forever.<br />
She remembered the time when Peter was trying to teach her about were society in general, and werelions specifically, that he had her stand nude in the middle of the forest.<br />
Now, that scenario repeated itself in her mind. The sensation of the light breeze gently caressing bare skin. The grass tickling the soles of her feet. The way she was sure Peter was staring intently at her beauty, even though she had her eyes closed at his insistence to be more in touch with her tactile feelings.<br />
But Karen was only nude until her fur started growing.<br />
Each individual strand appearing created a warm tingling throughout her body.<br />
Her hands and feet were pleasantly changing into paws, even as she felt her legs stretch to give her added height.<br />
The sensation of a tail forming was quickly followed by her ears shifting to a higher position on her changing head as human features assumed their proper leonine appearance.<br />
The past was but a distant memory. It was the future she readily embraced.<br />
Karen felt a growing moisture between her legs as she raised her head back to the stars above and proudly let out a roar as a happy werelioness.<br />
Then she felt a new warmth overtake her.<br />
It was not only more pleasant than anything she had felt so far, this one was also more primal. More urgent.<br />
She turned and smiled at her mate in all his glory, until werelion Peter Talbot showed his wife just how much he loved her on the grassy forest floor.<br />
<br />
It was with a start that Karen Yuletide greeted reality at 7 that Sunday morning as her alarm clock rang.<br />
Part of her knew she was tired and would need more sleep before class Monday, but now was not the time for rest.<br />
Then again, the dry substance between her legs instantly told Karen how wonderful her dreams were. But dreams were for later, with their fulfillment just days away.<br />
She hurriedly used the dorm building shower and got dressed for the day, then went back downstairs to meet Peter by 8.<br />
The two talked about their potential wedding plans as he drove them back to the Talbot household.<br />
There, they found his mother Regina starting breakfast in the kitchen, although there was no sign of his father Leon yet.<br />
Regina was lost in thought cooking when she heard the backdoor open. The woman was in her werelioness fursona since she was in the privacy of her own home, but did have an over sized apron on.<br />
Regina turned to look at the new arrivals and smiled.<br />
&quot;You already know what I&#39;m about to say, thanks to Joy and Ife,&quot; began Peter, referring to his cousins that were at the Halloween dance last night, &quot;but I still would like the honor of formally presenting my future wife to you,&quot; he added, while stepping back a bit to show off Karen.<br />
A smile crossed Regina&#39;s lioness muzzle as she came to hug her future daughter-in-law. &quot;Welcome to the family,&quot; she said happily.<br />
&quot;I&#39;m so glad to be a part of your pride,&quot; replied Karen, while returning the hug.<br />
&quot;The honor&#39;s ours,&quot; said a male voice, as everyone looked to see Leon Talbot, the Werelion King of Moon Lake joining them. Karen wasn&#39;t sure why he was wearing a very large bathrobe as he drew closer. &quot;My son always said that when he took a wife, it would be for love, and I can see he is a man of his word,&quot; added Leon, while looking at the happy couple.<br />
Then there was a knowing look between Leon and Regina, which she acted upon by taking Karen aside and asking to hear everything that happened first hand, leaving the men alone to talk.<br />
&quot;She&#39;s still a normal?&quot; asked Leon in a low voice.<br />
&quot;Not at her insistence, but mine. I want her first transformation to be truly special. I was thinking this coming weekend, provided I can use our cabin by the lake. Privately,&quot; replied Peter in the same low tone of voice.<br />
&quot;I shall make the necessary arrangements,&quot; promised his father in a whisper. Then said, &quot;Congratulations son,&quot; louder for all to hear.<br />
<br />
After breakfast, the Talbots sat around the kitchen table and listened to Peter and his fiance&#39;s plans.<br />
&quot;At least on my end, I don&#39;t really want or need a big wedding,&quot; began Karen, looking affectionately at Peter. &quot;My parents have been divorced for years, and I&#39;m not really sure where my father is right now anyway. My mother&#39;s still in California, so I would like her to attend, along with Jenny as my Maid of Honor. Add her new husband as Jenny&#39;s Plus 1, and that&#39;s about everyone on my end that I want to make sure is there.&quot;<br />
&quot;You are right that your wedding has the potential to become a much bigger affair than you hope it will. After all, the Werelion Prince of Moon Lake is being married, which will be a cause of celebration amongst all the werelion prides around, not just the Talbot clan,&quot; conceded Leon. &quot;But I shall do what I can to keep all the fuss and muss down to a small roar. No pun intended,&quot; he quickly added.<br />
&quot;Have you set a date? What about a wedding dress?&quot; asked Regina.<br />
&quot;February 14 of next year, if it&#39;s available, and I&#39;d like to design my own. Not sure who I&#39;ll get to make it, especially since Peter says my measurements will change after next weekend,&quot; answered Karen, as she started blushing at the thought of what they had planned, &quot;but I have all these ideas running around in my head...&quot;<br />
&quot;Understandable, with you being such a creative soul,&quot; said Peter, before kissing his future bride on the cheek.<br />
&quot;Do not worry Karen. I have helped all of my brothers with their ceremonies. I can do no less than to promise my own son and his bride to be the wedding of their dreams,&quot; said Peter&#39;s father.<br />
&quot;Thank you Mister Talbot,&quot; replied Karen.<br />
&quot;You&#39;re welcome, and it&#39;s Leon.&quot;</p>
