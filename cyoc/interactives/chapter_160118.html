<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Why not walk on the wild side a bit and exploit this for what it was worth?<br />
<br />
That was the thought that saw the newly feminine looking if not acting Connor sliding on the women&#39;s clothing and dressing up for a day out. He knew this was kind of weird, but his mind was still every bit the sex starved jock, and he saw this as the perfect opportunity. Still, even as he fit on a pair of skinny jeans, he noted he would need to be careful about getting too excited. An erection would probably be really noticeable in these clothes...<br />
<br />
Slipping on a shirt and figuring he didn&#39;t exactly need all of the typical accessories just yet, Connor looked at himself in the bathroom mirror, evaluating how he looked all dressed up like this. He figured he had until 4:30; School got out at 3:30, and Kendall got done with her practice at 4:30. Thus giving him enough time to explore this. Maybe he&#39;d head home after just thirty minutes, maybe there&#39;d be more of a crunch for time...<br />
<br />
All depended on how it went.<br />
<br />
Connor then made sure everything was ready and headed out of the house, more than a little nervous about this but trying to smile and be as bold as he could be. The first change he noticed in how people responded to him was pretty obvious. When he walked into the local coffee shop, he noted some of the guys were checking him out. Heh, they didn&#39;t even notice he was actually a he, though they really had no reason to notice that.<br />
<br />
Connor felt a slight pressure in his chest even as he looked around, and he started to wonder if the changes were done. Hopefully they were. He&#39;d hate to have to cook up some sort of explanation. He guessed right now he looked like some kind of toned, cute young woman looking around. He&#39;d probably have made a move on her if he saw this himself.<br />
<br />
Getting in line, Connor found himself looking at the back of the guy in front of him. Nowhere near as nice and buffed out as Connor&#39;s own back used to be, but still, pretty swole back. He just told himself he was evaluating that, and nothing more. He moved forward with the line when people made their orders and went to sit down, and found himself wondering when someone might cotton on. Hopefully never.<br />
<br />
&quot;Excuse me, maam,&quot; The Barrista said once he was at the front of the line, &quot;What will you be having today?&quot;<br />
<br />
Damn. The Barrista was a hot, tight bodied young woman with a medium length haircut, breasts Connor definitely had no hope of equaling in his present state, and a hot tight derriere no doubt shaped by copious visits to the gym. He bit his lip subtly, just to stop himself from springing a boner. He might be presenting differently, but this tiger could not change his spots so easily.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll...uh, I&#39;ll have a French Vanilla Capucchino, extra vanilla.&quot; One of his favorite drinks, and the Barrista seemed to smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;ll be 2.95. It&#39;ll be ready shortly. Can I get a name for that?&quot; <br />
<br />
Connor handed over 3 dollars, paused, and realized he had not thought of a name yet for this...er, persona. He tried to think of something, he certainly could not well use his male name, that&#39;d give away the game AND reveal what was happening to him. So he had to think of something. Then it hit him, &quot;Celia Connors.&quot; A bit derivative, but it worked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay Celia, I&#39;ll make sure extra vanilla is written down.&quot; And with that the Barrista went off to make his drink and Connor took a seat by the windows. He started to get a look at himself in the window, realizing that his breasts had gone up in size. Probably close to a B-Cup by now. He did a quick check, and his six incher was still both alive and...ohh, well.<br />
<br />
It took Connor a minute to cool his jets, and that was when he looked over to see Mr. Buff Back walking over. Guy looked like he was caught between being a nerd and a jock, he had black framed glasses on, a disorderly curly mass of strawberry blond hair, almond colored eyes, and a frame that looked strong and muscular but wasn&#39;t quite on the next level the way the guys were in Varcity football.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey uh, I haven&#39;t seen you around before...&quot;<br />
<br />
Yep, Connor thought, this dude was probably gonna be hitting on him. He didn&#39;t want this to go anywhere, but on a whim he decided to humor the poor schmuck. &quot;Nor I you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s cuz I&#39;ve uh, been studying out of town. Only recently came back.&quot; He rubbed the back of his head, &quot;I&#39;m Stuart.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Celia Connors...&quot; Connor leaned forward a bit and asked, &quot;You workout a lot, Stu?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not really, I just started last year.&quot; Stuart rolled up the sleeve on his t-shirt and flexed a surprisingly solid bicep, &quot;I got tired being the skinny kid at the back of the room. So I decided to be the buff guy at the back of the room!&quot;<br />
<br />
Funny, Connor thought, though seriously, he found himself contemplating, a year&#39;s worth of training and he gets this far? Give this guy another year and he&#39;ll end up a bodybuilder...<br />
<br />
&quot;Celia Connors, your drink is ready!&quot; Connor got up to get the drink, hoping he could continue his little deception, and as he got his drink he noted the Barrista really seemed to be all smiles and complimented his drink as he headed back to his seat. Maybe...she was into the new Connor too? Did she swing both ways? Connor swore he remembered fucking her when he was his old self. Ah well, more for him now he guessed.<br />
<br />
Returning to his seat, Connor found Stu still waiting for him, and even as Connor sipped his drink he asked, &quot;So what are you going to be studying, Stu?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Probably biology, and a bit of nutrition too,&quot; Stu said, beaming, &quot;My mom says I have the attitude to be a personal trainer, and even though I never really saw myself with that profession I might just go for it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Connor found himself imagining his new self training with Stu, letting him arrange Connor into the right form for an exercise, getting them both nice and sweaty and worn out, then they&#39;d both head out and suck each others&#39; cocks--- Ohh fuck. Connor realized his fantasy was getting too intensive, and he looked down to see his buddy was pound erect. It&#39;d take him a while to get that down. Unless...<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll uh, be right back, big guy. Need to use the restroom.&quot; Connor left his drink on the table, turning so Stu and most of the coffee shop would only see his backside. He hurried off into the women&#39;s restroom there. The restroom was roomy for a single person restroom, had a single toilet, a mirror that showed Connor his lust-ridden facial expression, and a pair of locks at the door. Connor locked both locks, leaving him alone with his...needs.</p>
