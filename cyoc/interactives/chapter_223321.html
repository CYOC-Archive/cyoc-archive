<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff got in the car and Devour navigated him to their next location, his former girlfriend&#39;s father&#39;s apartment, not that Jeff was aware. Jeff looked at the building and the mass he was to carry up it. Along the ride Jeff could feel them talking, when they arrived Jeff noticed his sibling had learned to simulate clothing from the meager protection Jeff gave it from the clothing remnants of his sister, mother, and Jenny&#39;s mother.<br />
<br />
&quot;306? Won&#39;t any of these apartments do?&quot;<br />
&#39;No! And bring the emitter!&#39;<br />
<br />
Jeff lugged the mass up the stairs, dropping the emitter halfway, but Devour caught it and secured it in Jeff&#39;s pants. Finally, they made it to the door and Jeff set down the mass... Jeff knocked on the door and a moment later a well-built, middle-aged man appeared.<br />
<br />
Without hesitation, Devour lurched out from Jeff&#39;s shirt striking the man and clinging to his face with enough force and surprise to make him stagger backward while blinding him. Simultaneously, the new symbiote sprung into action and while the man groped at Devour covering his face, it grabbed his feet bound them together, and began crawling up his legs.<br />
<br />
&#39;You can come in and shut the door any time Jeff.&#39;<br />
<br />
Jeff scurried in and shut the door as the man behind him crashed to the floor. Jeff turned to find Devour had latched onto the man&#39;s hands as he tried to pry Devour from his head. &#39;Hold his feet still Jeff, there&#39;s only so much of me!&#39;<br />
<br />
&quot;Make sure he can breathe, release his nose!&quot; Jeff said pinning down the man&#39;s lower body. Jeff watched as the man&#39;s clothes dissolved away,    and the desperation behind the thrashing eased as the man breathed heavily through his nose. Jeff, somewhat relieved but ultimately confused, &quot;What are you doing? What are we doing, and why is he naked?&quot;<br />
<br />
&#39;I have shared what I learned from you with my sibling. They dream of being with a female host and exploring humanity from that lens. I want a male host and dream of fulfilling all fantasies through you. Our goals aligned and we decided to work together to get their host ready, and I get the leftovers.&#39;<br />
<br />
&quot;Leftovers? What does that even mean? If they wanted a hostess why bother this dude?&quot; Jeff tried to stand but realized his pants had become black tendrils securing him to the ground. &quot;What are you doing!? Release me!&quot;<br />
<br />
&#39;I&#39;m helping us and my sibling. The fibers making up Jeff&#39;s shirt exploded into black tendrils plunging into the man&#39;s back then contracting, pulling Jeff onto, and securing him. Jeff could feel the man jerk in sudden pain and hear his muffled screams. <br />
<br />
Slowly, nearly menacingly, Jeff saw the black mass beginning to envelop his head too. As Jeff tried to resist his head was immediately engulfed.<br />
<br />
After unknown minutes passed the situation worsened as Jeff realized he had lost feeling in his body. The silent treatment he had been giving Devour was cut short when he, for the first time, tried to connect with Devour mentally and asked why he couldn&#39;t feel his body. &#39;It&#39;s less traumatic for you this way...&#39; came the response. <br />
<br />
Jeff fell silent, and his unasked questions were left unanswered. He was afraid to upset Devour, and beginning to realize Devour was nothing like Jenny or Anna even in their most driven of mindsets. Several minutes later Jeff felt things shift and his breathing changed as if there was a pressure on his chest, though he still had no direct tactile sensation.<br />
<br />
His mind wandered and his attention slipped, he may have even fallen asleep at some point, but any hope he had of keeping track of time was lost. <br />
<br />
&#39;Let me know if you start to feel any pain,&#39; Devour&#39;s voice appeared in Jeff&#39;s head. Slowly sensations began to return, the carpet touching his arms and calves, something was weighing on him...  but no pain.<br />
<br />
&#39;No, I&#39;m alright.&#39; Jeff said in his mind. He tried to move but couldn&#39;t sit up. His physical awareness deepened. He felt off, but how specifically, he couldn&#39;t tell. &#39;Are you almost done? I&#39;m tired of this whole situation and don&#39;t appreciate it when you commandeer my body like this, or earlier when you practically threw me through the house.&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;It&#39;s our body, Jeff. Besides, soon I think you&#39;ll appreciate it very much. I am almost done but it will take a little longer.&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Can you uncover my head at least?&#39;<br />
&#39;No&#39;<br />
&#39;Why?!&#39;<br />
&#39;That will ruin the surprise!&#39; <br />
&#39;How&#39;s our little symbiote doing?&#39; Jeff asked, intrigued about what was happening on that front. Jeff at least knew the chronivac was activated when he had something crawl inside him. This guy was blindsided and must be so confused. <br />
&#39;It&#39;s been delightful working with them! We have made many advancements in our very short time together.&#39;<br />
<br />
Jeff tried to be patient, but after more time had elapsed he couldn&#39;t hold off anymore. &#39;Hey Devour, I need to use the bathroom and I&#39;m getting hungry.&#39;<br />
<br />
There was a displeased quivering in his mind for a moment before he felt a strange sense of vertigo. Jeff&#39;s head was uncovered, but it remained dark. Jeff realized that he was standing upright and night had fallen. He was standing a few feet from the hallway leading to the master bedroom but on the left was the guest bathroom. He went to it, turning on the light and immediately closing his eyes. The briefest of glances and he knew where everything was. <br />
<br />
Jeff took a step forward, lifted the lid, turned shimmied down his pants, made sure he was aiming into the bowl and started peeing. A second later a hot stream of relief was being evacuated. In addition to hearing the noise from the bowl, he heard urine hitting his clothing. A quick glance, he saw his penis above the lid! Alarmed, he pushed it into the bowl and held it there, groping with his other hand for the toilet paper hoping it would clean up the mess before it absorbed into his clothes.<br />
<br />
Bending over he noticed the sound of his urine hitting the toilet bowl and streaming directly into the water. &#39;Wait, AND?&#39; Jeff jiggled and analyzed the sound before grabbing his second penis with confusion and alarm.<br />
<br />
He stood and gazed at his groin in the mirror. Immediately above his normal penis sat a slightly bigger penis, a different skin tone, complete with scrotum and testes which cradled the shaft of his smaller under-penis. &#39;Why?&#39; was the first thought that resounded in his head. It wasn&#39;t directed at Devour but it was such an all-encompassing thought that the symbiote in the living room could probably feel it.<br />
<br />
&#39;Yes, now you&#39;re twice as manly.&#39; Devour said, pleased.<br />
&quot;You did this on purpose?&quot; Jeff shouted, grabbing the extra phallis expecting to be able to rip it off only to find it feels indistinguishable from his own.<br />
&#39;It wasn&#39;t accidental if that&#39;s what you&#39;re asking.&#39;<br />
&#39;It feels just like my own. How did you make me grow an extra penis?&#39;<br />
&#39;Grow? No. It was one of my sibling&#39;s leftovers, and both of our hosts attributed your masculinity to it, so I thought we could use it. Though, growing extra sounds like an interesting plan as well.&#39;<br />
<br />
Jeff&#39;s mind did several backflips at all the potential ramifications of those last few statements before realizing that Devour hopes to turn Jeff into a man with phalluses protruding from nearly every inch of his body. &quot;Oh, no! No, no, no, no, no! That&#39;s a bad idea. Guys are supposed to have one penis with two testicles. Deviation from that makes a guy less desirable to most people, usually.&quot;<br />
<br />
&#39;Humans are so weird. If not multiple, what would make a human more manly?&#39;<br />
Jeff was taken aback, &quot;Jenny, you should know this.&quot; blushing.<br />
&#39;I am a sentient swarm of highly adaptable, exceptionally versatile cells, maintaining memories of society, relationships, language, and our own goals, with a fluid form and the ability to merge with and augment my host. Maintaining every detail was impossible during our transformation. That&#39;s why I&#39;m using you.&#39;<br />
&quot;Using me how?&quot; the alarm was palpable.<br />
&#39;To explore masculine pleasure, like our sibling is seeking to explore feminine pleasure. You are also better at storing memories than we are, so I used you to hold some of those leftovers too.&#39;<br />
<br />
Jeff stared at himself in the mirror, taking in the rest of his form while trying to process everything. The blue button-up shirt strained against his muscles, his pants laid around his ankles weren&#39;t in view from the mirror, and his heavy beard shadow looked like he hadn&#39;t shaved in a day or two. He looked smaller, younger even, aside from the bits of gray and white in his beard... but less tall, less muscular.<br />
<br />
&quot;What did you do to me?&quot; <br />
<br />
Devour explained in detail. It took the extra resources from Jenny&#39;s dad that the other symbiote deemed garbage. Body and facial hair, the mass that made his muscles, organs, and bones, and his genitals in their entirety were handed off to Devour to provide to Jeff. However, the host was rebelling, or at least attempted to. The host&#39;s decision center was making conflict, but it had no experience in female pleasure therefore, it was also garbage. Most horrifying was that before destruction, the structure of this successful man&#39;s decision organ was partially mapped onto Jeff&#39;s decision organ with hopes of imbuing Devour&#39;s host with experience and skill, before being removed. <br />
<br />
&#39;You lobotomized him?&#39; Jeff&#39;s mouth fell agape.<br />
&#39;Of course not! That would be wasteful. We took what we could use and then lobotomized him.&#39;<br />
Jeff was not happy to hear this but thankful he was on the winning side of the situation. It was uncomfortable but there was nothing he could do for the guy.<br />
<br />
Jeff pondered his identity; Devour stopped mimicking clothes to let him see his muscular, though smaller than expected chest, and beginning to gray chest hair. Jeff had married, become a father, but he cheated, and there was a divorce, right? No, the specifics were missing, his wife and daughter&#39;s names, where they lived, his last few girlfriends... That meant he was the 16-year-old then. Jeff snickered, he hadn&#39;t been carded in years and doubted it would start again now given his current appearance.<br />
<br />
He was either a 45-year-old given the body of a younger man having lost the sting of his painful memories, or a teen given the appearance and voice of an adult along with the core memories to guide him. Either identity he assumes, he knew he could make it work.  <br />
<br />
Jeff ran his fingers over his hairy abdomen, both memories said he was never this cut despite trying for years into college... &quot;I&#39;m not complaining, but where did my belly pudge go?&quot;<br />
<br />
&#39;The other host needed it for their form. and both hosts agreed that its loss would only further our goals and is easily replaced.&#39;<br />
<br />
Jeff had many questions but none would formulate into anything close to a cohesive question. Conflicting thoughts of both going home and being home were just one example. Jeff stared at his dual penises recognizing both as his own. &quot;I need one penis and one set of testicles. Younger, longer, and thicker tend to equal better. For now, I&#39;d happily settle for some clothes.&quot;<br />
<br />
Clothes appeared back over Jeff covering his form in some form of graphic button-up, and shorts. Jeff walked to the living room and switched on the lights to see a naked woman floating 4 feet off the ground, suspended by a sprawling network of black tendrils that adhered across the ceiling, rooted to the ground, and pulsating.<br />
<br />
&quot;Who&#39;s this?&quot; Jeff closed the gap between them and examined the woman&#39;s flawless form. She looked around 25 and seemed eerily familiar in a lot of ways. <br />
&quot;We are Desire.&quot; the woman answered as she was lifted into a standing position and the tendrils supporting her fell back into her body creating a gossamer gown. She smiled. &quot;It is time. We have waited long enough Devour, let&#39;s begin our explorations.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff was unsure how he felt about a strange naked woman in his apartment, but his body responded with the most overwhelming lust he&#39;d ever felt, undoubtedly spurred on by Devour tinkering around in his brain.<br />
<br />
The pair rushed toward each other, the woman only reaching up to the beginning of Jeff&#39;s neck. With hardly any effort the woman was in Jeff&#39;s arms and was sliding down onto her former cock, as Jeff navigated to the bedroom he remembered as his own.<br />
<br />
Undressing was managed by their respective symbiotes and the pair fucked again and again. Jeff tried both of his penises and found the sensations much the same. The smaller penis was a little harder to keep in Desire, but when it was being used the larger one was rubbing her belly adding to the sensations. Jeff returned from his lusty daze two hours later, proud of himself, but twice as hungry as before.</p>
