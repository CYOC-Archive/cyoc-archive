<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The next morning had been a refreshing one for Johnny and the other conspiracy theorists. After years of fighting globalists and avidly exploring conspiracy theories, today was their first real day of peace. Johnny awoke to find his lips wrapped around Billy&#39;s cock. Apparently, the two were so exhausted from their orgy that they fell asleep like that in their dorm. It probably didn&#39;t help that it turned out that Johnny&#39;s &#39;emergency bag&#39; was actually a massive assortment of sex toys and lubricants. Deciding that there was no reason not to start back up again, Johnny began his morning by giving his best friend a wake-up blowjob. It definitely helped that Billy&#39;s loud moans woke up Nick, who had crashed in their room for the night, which led to a three-way that lasted most of the morning. After that, the real changes to their lives had begun.<br />
<br />
They started out small. Nick called his parents to tell them that he wasn&#39;t coming back home anymore. He had a new life now and he was going to make the most of it. His parents didn&#39;t mind. If anything, they were pleased that their son had dropped that silly writing job and had joined them in the sex industry and all the pleasure it could bring. Dill&#39;s parents had a similar reaction when he came out to them as a slutty twink. They were so proud that their son was pursuing his passion for cock and supported him completely. They were even more pleased when they found out that Eric had become their son&#39;s boyfriend and that the well endowed redhead had convinced Dill to drop out of school. To Dill&#39;s parents, life was about living in the moment and you needed to make the most of what you had.<br />
<br />
Even Johnny and Billy&#39;s parents were completely supportive of their slutty sons. Though the two of them thought they had come from a highly conservative town, it was clear that they had actually come from a prominent gayborhood now and their parents were no exception. Glad that their parents had changed along with them, Johnny began the enact his plan.<br />
<br />
First, Billy&#39;s subservience meant that the only job he could be trusted to do was being a stripper at the local club. The black and pink haired twink took to it like a fish to water. There was no one he couldn&#39;t entrance with his moves on the pole and no one complained about paying extra to receive private access to the submissive twink&#39;s massive bubble butt. If anything, they found themselves becoming quite dominant around Billy, paying repeatedly to roughly fuck him, much to Billy&#39;s pleasure. The result led to Billy gaining tons of experience and raking in tons of cash for the group to use.<br />
<br />
Another great help was Nick&#39;s increasing success as a cam boy. The brunette twink was becoming famous for fucking in the craziest of places: skyscrapers, amusement parks and more. He even gave a blowjob to a random guy in the Big Apple once. People were both impressed and aroused by how easily Nick was able to fuck so blantantly. Either people didn&#39;t care when he did someone, or they actively joined in. Everyone noticed him, but no one complained when they did.<br />
<br />
The result of the combined efforts of these two twinks meant that Johnny&#39;s crew, which was now combined Luke&#39;s crew (since he was a little too ditzy to lead now), had more money than was reasonable. Luckily, Johnny knew exactly how to use the excess cash. It began with offering drinks to the other students on his floor. Johnny would be dropping out of college soon, but he was going to make sure that his entire floor left with him. One taste of the drink, made specially by Luke&#39;s incredible boypussy, and they were hooked. After an entire glass, their intelligence and inhibitions dropped significantly and each man had a corresponding increase in both libido and homosexuality. Then, they were brought to Billy&#39;s strip club, which Johnny had easily been able to buy out due to the group&#39;s massive funds. There, a combination of Eric and Dill fucking on stage and Kyle&#39;s singing (it turned out that the tattooed twink had an incredible voice that was only helped by his ability to turn any song into a much dirty version) made every guy who entered come on the spot. Finally, Mikey would swoop down for the kill, offering this experience for life so long as they signed a contract that basically made them Johnny&#39;s personal slut. No man could resist, especially when Billy offered spread his legs as a &quot;celebratory treat&quot; for signing on. Soon, most of Johnny&#39;s dorm building was empty, while Billy&#39;s strip club was the place to be. The place had hundreds of workers, either as strippers, prostitutes, porn stars or recruiters for the first three. All of them were more than happy to work for Johnny, so long as their bellies were full of Luke&#39;s cum and they had plenty of guys to fuck, which was always the case.<br />
<br />
It was the perfect empire, one that Johnny was more than ready to lead. Plus, it allowed Johnny to live out his dream life. In his club, he could wear as little as he wanted, which meant that he&#39;d basically thrown out all his clothes except for his speedos and thongs. Furthermore, every night he could party as hard as possible, losing himself to the music, the alcohol and the cum. Astonishingly, Johnny found that no matter how much he drank or partied, he always felt good as new the next morning. As a result, Johnny&#39;s strip club and porn empire grew to massive proportions and reach.<br />
<br />
There was one thing Johnny always kept in mind, however, regardless of how powerful he grew. He was, at the end of the day, a slutty little twink. That was why he had been able to do what he did. He made sure that he often participated by working the pole in his club and joining Nick in his livestreams. When his empire began producing its own porn, Johnny made that he was the first actor to get plowed. After all, to be a slutty think, you had to lead by example. So when he happened to stumble across YourTruth.Now once more, Johnny found himself sharing the link with everyone he knew, and it was accompanied by a photo of his boypussy being stuffed with a massive dildo. He had to prove the website&#39;s authencity and it definitely was real. After all, it knew the truth about him well before he even did.</p>
