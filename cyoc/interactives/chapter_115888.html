<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Joan Morningcloud woke up feeling unwell; it was the first time she ever felt sick. Being a were-tigress, her immune system like every other were was just as robust and well rounded. Immune to most major maladies; Joan knew she couldn’t be dealing with a common cold or the flu. However, the symptoms she was feeling were indicative to both; fever, chills, achy pains, congestion and a general sluggishness. It took all her strength just to get up and make it to the bathroom.<br />
<br />
The raven haired native American currently in her fursona, groaned as she lean over the bathroom counter; a wave of vertigo washing over her as she tried to turn and walk at the same time.<br />
“I can’t be pregnant,” she wonders to herself; “I have been diligent with my birth control and Douglas and I never had a chance to canoodle since Friday.”<br />
The continued feeling of dizziness refusing to abate, furthered to confound her as Joan used the hallway wall to keep her upright as she slowly made her way to the living room/kitchen.<br />
“Why do I feel so unwell,” Joan pausing as she ran out of wall to help her stay standing.<br />
<br />
Watching the usual assortment of morning cartoons; Darrel was unaware of Joan making her way from the bathroom to the large room he was in. It was only when he heard a large thud did he turn around. Seeing Joan on the floor passed out and not moving; Darrel got up, curious as he was getting hungry and wanting breakfast.<br />
“Furry Joan,” Darrel grabbing handfuls of orange fur; “wake up. The floor is dirty for sleeping on.”<br />
<br />
While Joan was somewhat still aware what was happening, her body refused to listen to her as she tried to move. Aware that Darrell was poking and prodding her; trying to get her to move. All Joan could do was mumble a disjointed plea for help.<br />
 “Call…uncle yogi. Need help…”<br />
<br />
*******<br />
<br />
Daisuke just shook his head in disbelief over what Douglas and Leon were telling him. The news reports of naked men wander the woods near the border; Frederick’s men that Leon Talbot’s brother and nephews abducted and dropped off. Finding out that the mobster was planning to break his son Daniel out, during the Labor Day picnic; an event that is currently going on as he sits in the sheriff’s office. The information regarding the planned jail break from spying on the mobster’s campsite, and a vivid dream that described Leon’s death. It was enough for the were-fox to sigh as he wished his grandmother present for this; Tachibana No Akane was far older and wiser, able to understand prophecy dreams as she has told her grandson that it’s those dreams that made sure he was alive today.<br />
<br />
“I find this story you two are spinning,” Daisuke sighing; “incredulous at best.”<br />
“Believe it or not,” Leon drinking water as he has had his fill with the horrible coffee Douglas has been brewing; “it’s true.”<br />
“And where exactly is Daniel Parker,” Daisuke shaking his head.<br />
“In the custody of the FBI,” Sheriff Cooper responding; “State Trooper Eugene Talbot assisted with the hand off.”<br />
“So the federal agents have the Parker boy,” Daisuke looking at his phone and swearing in Japanese; “are they going to want Frederick?”<br />
“Unless they want to get into a pissing match with me,” Sheriff Cooper glaring; “over the multitude of attempted murder of a peace officer charges, versus their R.I.C.O case; they better let us have first crack at him.”<br />
“I’d rather hand the man off to the Feds,” Daisuke shaking his head; “it won’t be long before the press gets wind of this. I’d rather not have the major news networks parking their vans outside of city hall and the jail. A were-alert during the last long weekend of the summer was bad enough,” Daisuke looking at the sheriff; “imagine one that lasts for months on end as Frederick’s lawyer’s drag things out through the system.”<br />
“They’ll petition a change of venue,” Sheriff Cooper retorting; “but I do see your point that a noisy reporter could report on more than just a mobster facing a possible death penalty sentence. A were out for a stroll in their fursona or loud animal sounds coming from within a house. I’ll talk to Agent Reed, as she has Daniel in Seattle at the moment.”<br />
<br />
Before Daisuke could continue the conversation with the sheriff and Leon, a deputy knocks on the door and enters.<br />
&quot;Sheriff, I&#39;m sorry to bother you, but dispatch says there&#39;s a young boy calling from your place on Line One. He says it&#39;s an emergency and he needs to talk to Uncle Yogi now.&quot;<br />
Leon watched the color drain from Cooper&#39;s face as the Sheriff picked up the phone. &quot;Darrell? What&#39;s wrong?&quot;<br />
&quot;It&#39;s furry Joan,&quot; said Douglas&#39; cousin. &quot;She hasn&#39;t been feeling well since we got up this morning. She is lying on the floor moaning for you. But that was hours ago and she won&#39;t get up and her head&#39;s really hot; I’m also hungry and we are out of bananas.&quot;<br />
Cooper was about to respond when Leon said, &quot;Wait a second Douglas.&quot; Thanks to his acute hearing as a weretiger, Talbot had heard what the boy said. &quot;You said you had a were-wedding last night but haven&#39;t consummated it yet? How long ago?&quot;<br />
&quot;Almost 22 hours now,&quot; The Sheriff looking at his wristwatch,<br />
&quot;Damn,&quot; replied Leon. &quot;I&#39;ve heard about this before. Your mate is suffering involuntary withdrawal because you two haven&#39;t physically completed your union. The sooner you get home to her and consummate your wedding, the quicker she&#39;ll recover.&quot;<br />
&quot;No side effects or consequences?&quot;<br />
&quot;Just make sure she took her were birth control this morning before you two get physical, otherwise you&#39;ll be a father again before the night&#39;s over,&quot; cautioned Leon with a smile.<br />
Douglas thought about it for a moment, and then said, &quot;Okay Darrell. I need you to listen to me very carefully and do exactly what I say.&quot;<br />
<br />
Daisuke who was present for the exchange, elected not to get involved with this latest issue that Sheriff Cooper is handing. Silently heading out of sheriff’s office; Daisuke makes a cryptic text to his grandmother.<br />
‘The shark tried to bite the bear at his den and got mauled for his troubles.’<br />
Daisuke hits send and quietly heads out of the police station. Choosing to head back to the picnic; Daisuke knew that the press conference the Crawford’s were holding had to have ended by now.</p>
