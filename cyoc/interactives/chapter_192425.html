<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Danielle stood up decisively. &quot;I have decided to go to a polyamorous world. A world where all my submissive fantasies can come true without fear of abuse or persecution.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re sure?&quot; asked the genie. &quot;You have no ties to this world?&quot;<br />
<br />
Danielle looked away a moment, then met the genie&#39;s gaze. &quot;None that I wouldn&#39;t sacrifice for a shot at a new life.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Very well, mistress.&quot; The genie shifted, crossing her legs and pressing her hands together. Closing her eyes, she levitated an inch off the coffee table. A few minutes later, she smiled, and gracefully landed on her feet. &quot;That should work fine.&quot; She opened her eyes, nodding in satisfaction to Danielle. &quot;Just wish for it, mistress, and I&#39;ll take us there.&quot;<br />
<br />
Danielle&#39;s eyes sparkled in anticipation. Other parts of her were also feeling the excitement -- she found herself rubbing her thighs together. She almost dipped a finger into her honeypot again. But she couldn&#39;t wait any longer! &quot;Genie, I wish --&quot; But then she paused. &quot;Wait, can I bring stuff with me?&quot;<br />
<br />
The genie laughed. &quot;Yes. Good thing you thought of that! There&#39;s no limit to the personal possessions you can bring, though moving structures would be another wish.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s okay.&quot; Quickly Danielle gathered together everything she felt attached to, and pached it in a couple of suitcases. She noticed that as she touched things, they changed, becoming feminine to suit her new needs and tastes. She also took the opportunity to change into fresh panties and a somewhat bigger skirt. Just as she was finishing up the packing, she looked wistfully at a beloved console. &quot;Will my GameStation work in this new world...?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Probably.&quot; The genie mused. &quot;Yes, it should be backwards-compatible, and the fact that nobody will know what it is can be explained by it being so obsolete.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh?&quot; <i>What kind of world has she picked out?</i> Danielle thought about asking, but she decided she&#39;d rather be surprised. &quot;Okay!&quot;<br />
<br />
Then everything was ready. Danielle stood in the middle of two suitcases and a carry-on, and took a deep breath. &quot;Okay. Genie, I wish for you to take me to a world where polyamory is normal and accepted.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;At once, mistress.&quot; The genie stepped forward and took the new girl by the hand. &quot;Hold on!&quot;<br />
<br />
The room blurred, becoming a meaningless jumble of colours. Danielle closed her eyes. A sound as of wind rushed past her ears, but she felt no movement. And a few seconds later, the genie announced,<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re here.&quot; A giggle. &quot;You can open your eyes, mistress.&quot;<br />
<br />
As she did so, Danielle caught her breath, and hugged herself. The two females were standing at the entrance of an alleyway, gazing out into a wide, paved street dark and slick with recent rain. Tall, elegant buildings rose all around them, their many lights reflecting in the puddles. Above, clouds were breaking up, revealing a round Moon and a few bright stars.<br />
<br />
There were no cars or other traffic visible, but there were many people strolling up and down the street. Mostly females, they were all clad in latex, or something similarly smooth and tight-fitting, in all kinds of colours and flattering patterns. For some it covered their entire bodies below the neck, while others had cut-aways to show off breasts or stomachs. All seemed to feature a snug plastic crotch piece molded to show the labia beneath. Some had further plastic or metal accessories over the outfit. Some also had rubber paw-boots and clear plastic rainguards over their outifts; others did not.<br />
<br />
For -- as far as Danielle could see -- everyone was some kind of anthropomorphic animal: with &quot;crooked&quot; legs; tails protruding from their suits; perked ears and muzzles on thier heads. She couldn&#39;t identify most of the species, but they looked like humanoid earth animals, mostly canine or feline.<br />
<br />
The few males she could spot seemed to be mostly unclothed, only wearing tight-fitting pants, though leather or denim instead of latex, with large plastic codpieces that both drew attention to their crotches but did not show what was beneath. A couple though wore latex bodysuits similar to the females.<br />
<br />
&quot;Welcome to Talastae,&quot; announced the genie. &quot;Capital of the Grand Duchy of Talestia, on the plant of Arle. Think of it as a combination of Monaco and New York City.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why is everyone a furry?&quot; asked Danielle, eyes wide. She had never been into furry, but then she&#39;d never seen anything like <i>this</i>. The girls were mouth-wateringly beautiful, latex and fur accentuating their curves perfectly. But the <i>men</i> -- she blushed, realising she was starting to soak through her panties again, while her legs were trembled. She wanted to just run out there and spread herself for one of those big wolves or lions! She felt ashamed over feeling like this, even if they were mostly &quot;human&quot;- looking -- but that just stoked her desire!<br />
<br />
&quot;Because,&quot; responded the genie, &quot;over the centuries the humans of Arle engineered various &#39;beastfolk&#39; with their magitech to fill different roles. And since the beastfolk were physically superior, they eventually took over in most parts of the world. But humans are still around -- look.&quot;<br />
<br />
Danielle followed her pointing finger, and saw a sight that made her blush even harder. A handsome dog-looking fellow was sitting at a cafe table chatting with a tiger man. Attached to a belt around the dog&#39;s waist were two leashes, which ran to thick collars around the necks of two human women. One sat at the dog&#39;s feet, while the other stood behind his chair. Except for a long, heavy coat draped over the shoulders of the latter, both were naked. As was a human male whose lead was held by the tiger.<br />
<br />
&quot;The beastfolk treat them as pets. Really, they&#39;re slaves -- the beastfolk don&#39;t treat them like animals. Mostly. But they&#39;re treated kindly, and kept only for companionship. Which does include sex, sometimes.&quot; She gave Danielle an impish smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;I figured you&#39;d like some options, depending on just how submissive you wanted to be. In addition to humans as pets, most beastfolk females are submissive towards the males, though there are exceptions in both directions. Dominants run a household, kind of like roommates if there&#39;s more than one; submissives live with them as concubines and domestic help. I thought you&#39;d appreciate that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Danielle nodded shyly. <i>That</i> idea certainly appealed to her. With a touch of envy, she saw a leopard girl in raincover and body-suit snuggling with a massive, bare-chested sabre-toothed cat holding a folded umbrella.<br />
<br />
&quot;So. I can turn us into beastfolk and help you find a guy interested in taking you as his concubine. Or if you want to be a true sex pet, you can stay human and I can pose as your owner until selling you to your pick of master. You won&#39;t be able to breed with him, but there are plenty of human studs to give you young. And you can always be &#39;uplifted&#39; to a beastwoman later, if you beg your master prettily enough.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I... uh...&quot; <i>Wow...</i> All these things -- she&#39;d never have dreamed of them in any life. Overwhelming possibilities, all of them making her wetter and wetter.<br />
<br />
&quot;Or, if you really want, I can pick out another dimension where humans still hold at least some power. Whether you decide to fit in here or go somewhere else, it still counts as part of your second wish, don&#39;t worry; it won&#39;t be &#39;fulfilled&#39; until you&#39;re happily settled in. I <i>will</i> need time to recharge before reality hopping again, though, and getting something to eat wouldn&#39;t hurt.&quot;<br />
<br />
The genie took her hand again and squeezed it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe you&#39;d like to look around before deciding? We&#39;re invisible at the moment. In fact, we&#39;re basically ghosts -- nobody can sense or interact with us except by magic -- which is a bit more common here as well, I might add, compared to Earth.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ahh, genie, you give me such choices...&quot; Danielle put a finger to her lips. She had never planned on either of the two options presented to her, but... her eyes strayed back to the two beastmen with their human pets. That was a whole new level of submission.</p>
