<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jake thought to himself as he hopped back onto the couch, nearly sitting on his tail. Changing Alex might be fun, just to get back at him for all the teasing he&#39;s done to him throughout the years. Leaving the perception filter off would just add to the embarrassment. Jake leaned forward to use the laptop, which was now awkwardly far away from him with his short gecko body. He positioned the Chronivac&#39;s emitter upright, with the end facing the ceiling. Luckily enough, it detected Alex above him, probably just at the edge of the radius of the Chronivac.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hm, whatcha doing now?&quot; Natalie said as she finished cleaning Jake&#39;s sticky handprints off of the wall.<br />
&quot;Just browsing...&quot; He mumbled. &quot;Thinking about using it on Alex, or maybe making myself a little taller.&quot; <br />
<br />
Natalie threw herself onto the couch playfully, landing behind Jake. She peered over Jake&#39;s shoulder, her entire body stretching along the length of the couch, her tail tapping lightly at the end. Jake leaned back and blushed, landing between her chest and stomach.<br />
<br />
&quot;No way! You&#39;re way too cute like this.&quot; She patted Jake&#39;s head.<br />
&quot;Thanks...&quot; He rolled his eyes.<br />
&quot;Anyways, changing Alex is something I can get behind. He needs to pay for that stupid comment earlier... What are you thinking?&quot; She looked at Jake&#39;s screen.<br />
<br />
Displayed currently was a large list of species, popular choices organized alphabetically. The information obscured Alex&#39;s own, as it was a drop down menu from the species tab. Jake scrolled through it silently for about half a minute, until mousing over one.<br />
<br />
&quot;You wanna turn him into raptor? I mean... They are pretty cool...&quot; Natalie shrugged.<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not quite done yet!&quot; Jake said as he clicked it.<br />
<br />
Jake then checked the &quot;% Species&quot; slider, which by default was at 50%. He would keep it there, wanting to leave Alex as an anthro. He then went over to the gender option, and flipped it over to female.<br />
<br />
&quot;Perfect! So you&#39;ll have a big sis instead...&quot; Natalie said excitedly.<br />
Jake smiled back, before retuning his focus. &quot;Now lets hit up some of the more advanced settings.&quot;<br />
<br />
Clicking on the the three arrows at the bottom, Jake was greeted with myriad options. Specific body dimensions, fine tuned appearance modifiers, precise mental modification, cross species options and more submenus were presented before them. He was overwhelmed for a second and froze, before going into the appearance modifier menu. <br />
<br />
&quot;And what&#39;s this for?&quot; Natalie asked him.<br />
&quot;Well, you see... I was kind of inspired by the 2000s look of the Chronivac. What if I changed Alex&#39;s appearance a little too... Maybe make him a scene raptor girl?&quot; Jake had a bit of a devilish smirk on his face.<br />
&quot;Oh? Seriously...? That&#39;s an amazing idea! Let me help!&quot; She pulled herself closer to the laptop, unintentionally snuggling her body closer to Jake&#39;s.<br />
<br />
The two of them flew through the settings, mostly arguing about hair colour and the shade his lipstick should be. Eventually they settled on giving him some nice blue hair and some darker lipstick, which would stand out well on his new grey scales.<br />
<br />
&quot;Isn&#39;t it a little weird that a raptor can have hair...? I mean, I don&#39;t have any.&quot; Natalie blurted out.<br />
&quot;Eh, well the Chronivac says it&#39;s possible, and the look isn&#39;t complete without it.&quot; Jake responded as he read over the sum of the changes.<br />
&quot;That&#39;s true, he&#39;ll be so mad after he changes!&quot;<br />
&quot;Well, here goes!&quot; Jake said, pressing the &#39;Save Changes&#39; button.<br />
<br />
The Chronivac&#39;s beam shot up through the ceiling of the basement and into Alex, who was texting his friends on the couch directly above Jake and Natalie. It hit him, but the initial impact did not do much. Jake and Natalie were giggling like idiots in the basement, anxiously awaiting Alex&#39;s response.<br />
<br />
Alex continued to scroll through his social media, and occasionally respond to the barrage of messages coming from his group chats. He felt a strange itch along his back thigh. He reached back into his pants, gently scratching the itch, although it seemed to persist. In actuality, dark grey, almost green scales were rippling across his thighs, covering his skin. At the same time, his thighs began to thicken, with his hips widening and looking more feminine. Alex wasn&#39;t really concerned though. He simply adjusted his seat and returned to scrolling. That was of course, until he felt his spine starting to extend. A small nub of a tail grew outwards, slipping out the top of Alex&#39;s pants. Eventually it wiggled under his seat, filling with new sensations.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uff... What the fuck...?&quot; He leaned forward off of his seat, looking back. What greeted him almost made him faint. A growing scaly tail, flopping out of his pants, growing longer every second! It was getting thicker and heavier too, which was clear as he stood up. He fell over, face first into the ground with his ass in the air. Not only was his tail growing to impressive lengths, it completely threw off his sense of balance. He reached back to grab it, but missed as he clumsily swayed it to the wrong side. What he got a handful of instead was a little worse. His ass was expanding considerably to match his growing thighs, looking obscenely feminine as it waved in the air. <br />
<br />
&quot;What the hell is this!&quot; He yelled much louder this time. Jake and Natalie looked at each other.<br />
<br />
Alex&#39;s legs continued to change as scales flowed down them. His knees cracked painfully as his ankles lifted off the ground, changing his stance. His feet lost digits as they grew and pierced right through his socks. They were awkward to get used to, three toed with some long curled claws that he lightly tapped on the hardwood floors. Alex collected himself and stood up once more. Despite standing up, his hips, tail, and feet forced his body into a slightly hunched position.<br />
<br />
&quot;U-unf! N-no!&quot; He gasped, doubling over again. This time, a pain came from his crotch. He pulled down his pants and underwear, which were on the verge of falling down anyway. Alex was greeted to a front row seat of his junk shrinking in short, pleasure filled bursts, becoming replaced by a thin reptilian gap in his scales. He reached down to feel it, but was interrupted by his hands changing as well. They lost a digit each, and gained long claws like his feet, but at least they were somewhat dexterous. The scales moved along his arms and torso at an alarming rate. As they reached his chest, they flowed out in a bubbly pattern, his flesh underneath following suit. The mass of fat jiggled outwards in his t-shirt, becoming large D-cups that rested heavily without a bra to support them.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m a girl... dinosaur?&quot; She cocked her head as she brought her hand up to her breast, resting her hand on it. Her face was the last to change, and perhaps the most drastic. Her jaw pulled outwards as scales coated her head, growing significantly as her skull extruded with it, changing the shape of her neck. Her tongue grew pointed and larger to match her mouth, along with many sharp teeth that lined her gums. Her head felt heavy and large, and her mouth a little terrifying. Alex&#39;s eyes changed to reptilian ones, although they were decorated with a comically heavy amount of eyeshadow. Her hair grew much longer, with her bangs flitting in front of her eyes, an alarming bright blue gradient.<br />
<br />
She paused for a second, still trying to process what the hell happened to her. She picked up her phone again and popped open her camera, something surprisingly difficult with her nails. She stared at herself for around 5 seconds before freaking out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jaaaaaake! Natalie you too! You fucking— Did you— Ugh!&quot; She yelled from upstairs, her voice much higher and taking on a bitchy sort of tone.<br />
Jake and Natalie nearly burst out laughing as they heard him.<br />
<br />
Alex stomped down the stairs to the basement, basically tripping over her own feet. Her tail slapped the walls loudly, and her chest wobbled everywhere due to her hunched stance. She eventually came face to face with Jake and Natalie. She definitely looked like a scene raptor... Although not a scientifically accurate one Jake thought. She looked similar to a movie representation of one.<br />
<br />
&quot;J-Jake, is that you? How did you—&quot; She stared at the now gecko Jake. &quot;Natalie, did you do this?&quot;<br />
&quot;Nah, it was all Jake&#39;s idea. The only thing that was me was making Jake a gecko.&quot;<br />
&quot;Jake you are SO DEAD! I have a party to go to later, and you turn me into some stupid emo dinosaur chick!&quot; Alex screamed.<br />
&quot;Aww, is my big sis Alexis mad?&quot; Jake teased her further.<br />
&quot;How the fuck did you even do this... I&#39;ll make you undo it!&quot; She clumsily charged towards Jake and Natalie.<br />
&quot;W-whoa, calm down!&quot; Natalie yelled back.</p>
