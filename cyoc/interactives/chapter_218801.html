<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">William awoke to the sound of a ringing doorbell. He groaned as he rolled his large body over. He’d almost forgotten how big he was, if it wasn’t for his dream being about everyone becoming incredibly fat all of a sudden.<br />
<br />
He managed to push himself up, and waddled to the door. He opened it to see the butler answering the door,<br />
“Oh I’m sorry, this doesn’t seem to concern you. My apologies,” a woman at the door said. She was wearing a very large sweater with some writing that William wasn’t quite able to decipher,<br />
“Not at all. This ‘pandemic’ seems to have affected us all in some way, please,”<br />
“O-okay… well I think as you have seen, over the last day we have experienced a rather dramatic surge in body proportions,”<br />
“Yes,”<br />
“…and we are here to spread the word of a Divine Interference; as this is not a punishment nor curse, it is a gift from a Higher Power!”<br />
“Indeed!” The butler replied, “of course it is. However you are mistaken, this gift is not from a higher power, it is the outcome of a higher power. To gift one individual with a gift to change the world,”<br />
“I’m sorry… you mean as in… the second coming?”<br />
“No of course not,” the butler said, “this comes not from above, but from below,”<br />
“I don’t understand,” the woman said, “how do you know of this?”<br />
“Please, come inside. I’m sure my master and his friend will welcome you and show you their gifts,”<br />
The butler lead the woman in, holding a stack of flyers underneath her hefty bust. Each of them seemed to promote the idea she was spreading.<br />
<br />
William decided to follow them into the dining room, but couldn’t help but wonder… what did his butler mean? She said it with such confidence. Sure she says everything with confidence, but that’s because she can’t really lie. She knows everything… maybe too much. William wanted to ask her about it later.<br />
<br />
— — —<br />
<br />
William entered the dining room, being greeted by the eyes of the butler, this unknown new woman, and Lila, who didn’t look too pleased,<br />
“Sleep well?” The butler asked, “this is my master, William,” she explained to the new woman,<br />
“R-right,” the woman stammered, “my name is Alyssa, n-nice to meet you,” she said awkwardly,<br />
“Nice to meet you too… ma’am…” William said, unable to stop himself looking right at her breasts. She looked awkward, but wasn’t surprised.<br />
<br />
“So could you tell me more about what you said,” Alyssa said, talking to the butler,<br />
“Of course. You see this is William, he was given a gift…”<br />
“C-can we not just…” William blurted out,<br />
“My apologies,” the butler said. She stopped talking.<br />
The group sat in silence for almost a minute. It was awkward. Very awkward. Alyssa looked especially uncomfortable, and it was obvious. William wasn’t going to just tell her he had a ‘gift’, not that he’d even call it that.<br />
<br />
“William can make wishes!” Lila said suddenly, Alyssa almost choked on the cup of tea in front of her,<br />
“I-I’m sorry?” She said,<br />
“So can you!” William shouted at her,<br />
“How?”<br />
“Like she said, it’s ‘a gift’,” Lila said, teasing William again. He looked angry, “and he gave me the gift as well!” Lila said, “I wished we were both this fat. Trust me, I was skinny yesterday,”<br />
“STOP!” William shouted, but Lila didn’t,<br />
“It’s actually him who wished everyone had massive tits and huge dicks,”<br />
“PLEASE!” Alyssa shouted, everyone returning to silence, “this is… a lot to take in all at once,” she said, closing her eyes and taking a deep breath. She looked at William, sending a chill down his spine, “is this true?”<br />
“I-it…” William hesitated, looking at the butler, then at Lila, who was clearly going to admit it for him if he didn’t, “y-yes,”<br />
“I see,” she said, “why?”<br />
“I…” William hesitated again,<br />
“Because he thought it was gonna be hot,”<br />
“Can you please stop!” William said sternly to Lila. She stopped, looking a little intimated for once,<br />
“Can you prove it to me?” Alyssa asked, “I would like to believe you, but I don’t really see any proof. As far as I know, you could’ve always been this… big,”<br />
“You mean fat,” Lila corrected,<br />
“Y-yes… I suppose, fat would be the correct word,”<br />
<br />
“I can only use a wish once a day,” William started, “and it restarts at midnight,”<br />
“And you’ve used your wish already today?”<br />
“I-I used it to wish Lila had the same as me,”<br />
“And then she used her wish to make you both… larger,”<br />
“Yeah. But I do also have a different ability that I wished for,” William said. He reached into his shirt and pulled out a full can of soda, “I can produce anything if I really want to,”<br />
“Okay,” Alyssa said, “then could you… produce a book?” She asked,<br />
“Sure…” William said, he reached in and pulled out a thick book. It was blank on the front, back, and each of the pages were completely empty. He handed it to the butler, and she handed it to Alyssa. She flicked through it, seeing it completely blank,<br />
“What about another book, exactly the same, but the word, ‘William’ is printed on every single page,<br />
“Um… okay,” William said, awkwardly. He reached into his shirt once again and pulled out an identical book. On the front it’s title read ‘William’, underneath, in smaller letters, ‘William’. He handed it to the butler, to Alyssa. She opened the book, and across every single page, repeated over and over perfectly it read, ‘William William William…’.<br />
She seemed to be taken aback by this. Shocked, even.<br />
<br />
“S-so… I suppose that kind of proves it,” she chuckled nervously, then looked at both Lila, William, and the butler, “so may I ask why you three are seemingly unaffected by this… wish?”<br />
“Master William is able to produce items that can have interesting and unique effects. He produced a small vial to reduce the size of his penis, and a vial to reduce the size of her breasts,”<br />
“And yourself?” Alyssa asked,<br />
“Oh no, I’m not a person. I’m just the butler,” she said, smiling. Alyssa looked uncomfortable by that answer,<br />
<br />
“S-so… William, if I asked you to produce a… mirror… that could… turn me into some fantastical creature,”<br />
“Really?” William asked,<br />
“Yes. That way I can confirm it. As long as you can turn be back to normal afterwards, right?”<br />
“Yeah… I can,” he said, “okay… well a mirror, right.” He said, thinking about what it would look like,<br />
“Just something small,”<br />
“Yeah yeah,” he said, trying not to get distracted. He reached into his shirt, and slowly produced a silver hand-mirror. He looked into the reflection… but saw nothing, “oh…”<br />
“It should have worked, Master William,” the butler said, “hand it to me,” she said,<br />
“Okay… but I think I could do better,” he said, handing over the mirror. She passed it to Alyssa,<br />
“There’s no…”<br />
“Reflection, I know. I think I can fix—”<br />
“N-no… I can see something. Someone… it’s… it looks like,” she said, before suddenly the mirror shot out a bolt light, only covering Alyssa, she screamed suddenly, dropping the mirror to the ground. The butler managed to grab it, “what the… heck!” She shouted,<br />
<br />
“I-I’m sorry, I didn’t mean for—” William started, but as he stared at her, he could see that her skin was becoming, brighter. Glitterier. Her ears started to change, protruding upwards, coming to a point all of a sudden. Her nose turned up a little, her eyes grew bigger and shinier, glittery too. Her face changed to be more angular, and her black hair shifted to a dark yet shiny purple colour,<br />
“What’s going on!” She said, feeling her body morphing, “it’s… I don’t like it! It feels…”<br />
“Pleasurable,” the butler suggested, assuming Alyssa was at a loss for words.<br />
Alyssa’s sweater burst open at the back as a small yet rigid pair of wings started growing. They knocked over a small vase on the windowsill behind her, which the butler also grabbed. They continued to grow… as she started to shrink. Her whole body was reducing, getting smaller and smaller. And as her body reduced, it looked even glitterier, sparklier,<br />
“HELP!” She cried, trying to grab onto the table, but before long she’d completely reduced into her clothes. The room went completely silent.<br />
<br />
“That… was the craziest, weirdest thing I’ve ever seen in my ENTIRE LIFE!” Lila exclaimed, “that was AMAZING!” She yelped,<br />
“NO IT WAS NOT!” A very quiet, high pitched voice said, muffled…<br />
<br />
From the pile of clothes a tiny shimmer of light flew around, bashing itself into the ceiling, into the swinging light, it entered the kitchen, then back to the dining room,<br />
“You made me… a fairy!” She yelped,<br />
“I-I didn’t mean to!” William replied,<br />
“LOOK AT THE SIZE OF ME!” She yelled, “what are my kids! My husband… what are they going to think!?”<br />
“They’re gonna think it’s super awesome!” Lila said, “why’re you complaining! We just proved that magic is totally real, turned you into a magical fairy, like stop complaining, you can FLY!” Lila said, an evil optimism as ever,<br />
“I can’t return to the church like this… you’re… you’re a demon!”<br />
“No I’m not!” William defended, <br />
“I SAID MAGICAL CREATURE! I meant… like make me grow a horn or something!”<br />
“That was not clear,” the butler chimed in,<br />
“SCREW YOU!” Alyssa screamed at the butler, causing her to frown, “I don’t even KNOW what you are, but you’re not normal. You’re… you’re a witch, a DEMON! JUST LIKE HIM!” She looked towards Lila, “and you! You’re nothing but trouble, you’re an evil little IMP! And I’m telling everyone! THE CHURCH! THE GOVERNMENT! EVERYONE! YOU ARE SOOOO—”<br />
<br />
The butler reached over and scooped Alyssa up with a small glass jar. She screwed the lid onto the top, “you can insult me all you want, but you don’t insult my master nor his friend,” she said, setting the jar onto the table.<br />
“That was badass,” Lila said, rushing her wobbly body over to look into the jar. Alyssa was clearly shouting all sorts of profanities, but no sound could leave that jar,<br />
“Is that not going to… suffocate her?” William asked,<br />
“No, Fairies don’t need anything to survive. They run on magic, and their bodies produce magic naturally, at an incredibly high rate. But with their small size, it’s not so much of a problem. They’re essentially immortal, which is why they’re especially great light sources,”<br />
“What?” Lila and William replied in sync,<br />
“How do you know that?” William asked,<br />
“As I have said, I know everything,”<br />
“You know about fairies and magic and stuff?”<br />
“Yes. Where do you think your wishing power is from?”<br />
“I…” William stuttered,<br />
“It’s from wherever the fairies are from, dumbass,” Lila butted in, “that’s why the wishes are so powerful, right? Because we only get one wish per day,”<br />
“Indeed. Well figured out Ms. Lila,”<br />
“Thanks,” Lila replied, smiling. She turned back to look at Alyssa, trying her absolute hardest to force her way out of the jar. Her skin was pink, hair was purple, and she was totally nude. Her butt seemed perkier, waist seemed very thin, legs perfectly toned like the rest of her body. Her breasts, still very large, appeared very firm and full, and by her posture, she hardly seemed affected by their weight. Everything about her seemed… lighter, “I’m almost jealous,” Lila said,<br />
“Seriously?” William asked,<br />
“It’s a privilege to be a fairy, but their reputation is… a little beneath the standards of kindness,”<br />
“You mean they’re assholes?” Lila asked,<br />
“Not entirely. There are some respectable fairies, but most are arrogant. Due to their size, they’re very commonly angry and confrontational, insulting, and frustrating,”<br />
“So that’s why she became so crazy, she seemed so kind before,” William said<br />
“Indeed,” the butler agreed, “but in here, she should tire herself out, then you can return her to normal,”<br />
<br />
“So what do we do with her now?”<br />
“Leave her,” the butler said,<br />
“I feel bad…” William said,<br />
“She has everything a fairy needs to entertain herself,”<br />
“Like what? She’s in glass jar on her own…”<br />
“Exactly. With an essentially infinite supply of magic, plus one of the most sensitive and erogenous bodies in all of magical ecosystem,”<br />
“Okay okay… I get it,” William said, uncomfortable,<br />
“If she really wished to do so, she could send herself into a slumber until someone wakes her up,”<br />
“Jealous…” Lila added, “maybe I could take a look in that mirror, turn myself into a fairy,”<br />
“I’m not sure you would become a fairy,” the butler said, <br />
“Really?”<br />
“Well, the mirror would turn someone into ‘some fantastical creature’, which come be anything from Fairy, to Imp, to Troll… and so on,”<br />
“Oh okay… yeah I’ll pass,”<br />
“I’ll keep this mirror on me,” the butler said, taking the mirror and sliding it into her pocket, despite the size of her pocket… William didn’t want to question it any further. Butler was weird, magical, and he didn’t really care.<br />
<br />
— — —<br />
<br />
William spent the rest of his day producing a number of objects, seeing if he could push the limit of his ability. Once Lila found out, she joined in, asking him to produce new and weird things.<br />
<br />
“Hey… so I was thinking,” she started, William looked up from his newly produced holographic video player, “you know how the rest of the world has like… bigger boobs and dicks and stuff,”<br />
“Yeah, which we’re gonna fix with our wish, right?”<br />
“Yeah… well I was kinda wondering what I’d look like as an adult,”<br />
“Oh… so you want me to make a serum that—”<br />
“N-no!” She said, “I mean I’m going to use my wish to see what I’m like. Just a glimpse, to see what kind of life I’d have, without any wishes and stuff, just see where my life could go,”<br />
“I-I guess… but that means I’ll have to use my wish to fix all the enhancements, right?”<br />
“Yeah… is that okay. If I can do that, I’ll let you fix your body and stuff,”<br />
“Sure!” William said cheerfully, “but only after tonight!”<br />
“Seriously!?” William cried, falling backwards onto the couch, “ugh…” he groaned.<br />
<br />
“Dinner!” The butler called out, “talk more about it later,”</p>
