<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Rick got out of his car to look around. He had brown hair which was getting a little long so the ends curled a bit, hazel eyes, and a bit <br />
of a gut. He stood five foot eight and looked like he didn't get much sun. Well he didn't since he worked at night and slept during the <br />
day. That was before he had the urge to quit and come here to the edge of this forest. Now as he stood there he felt the same pull he'd <br />
been feeling for awhile now. It had gotten to the point that he couldn't ignore it and thus started on his trek to here though he knew his <br />
journey wasn't done yet. Sighing he retrieved his water bottle and backpack from the car and started walking through the forest.<br />
<br />
As he walked he felt at peace here in this forest like he belonged here. A few small animals stopped and looked at him as he passed by <br />
and he had to smile at their curiosity. Some of them seemed almost human and that got him to thinking about the people that have <br />
gone missing around here. There were stories of a witch living in this forest and the stories had people coming into the forest to deal <br />
with the witch and never coming back out. Many said the witch killed and ate them while others said she transformed them. Then those <br />
people would crack up and say there wasn't a witch in the forest. The people who had come into the forest likely got lost and met with <br />
an unfortunate end. There were bears, wolves, and cougars in the forest which could have killed the people. He shook his head <br />
knowing that it was dangerous in here but he just couldn't bring himself to feel like he was in danger. He was being led someplace for <br />
some reason and he wanted to know where and why.<br />
<br />
After walking for four hours he came across a small cabin in a clearing. It seemed that he was being drawn to this cabin which was a bit <br />
of a relief since his feet were killing him. As he walked up to the cabin the door opened revealing a woman who said, &quot;Come in come in. <br />
I've been expecting you.&quot;<br />
<br />
He should have turned around and ran since there really was no way she could have been expecting him. He had come here for <br />
answers though so he stepped into the cabin asking, &quot;How were you expecting me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh not you specifically just a person,&quot; the woman said going to a wood burning stove. She placed a tea kettle on it and asked, &quot;Tea?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes please and thank you,&quot; he said looking around the cabin. It was only one room as far as he could see. In one corner was a kitchen <br />
with a sink, counter, wood burning stove, cupboards, and what looked like a very old ice box. There was a table with a couple chairs <br />
almost in the middle of the room and an oil lamp in the center of it. In the corner opposite from the kitchen area were two beds with <br />
antique looking wardrobes at the foot of them. A small table with another oil lamp on it stood right in the corner with the heads of the <br />
beds facing it. In the other two corners were a couple of bookshelves containing some old looking books. Overall it looked like <br />
something that belonged in colonial America. He was sure that there would be an outhouse and tub outside.<br />
<br />
The kettle whistled and the woman said, &quot;Please sit down,&quot; gesturing for him to do so. Once he did she sat two cups on saucers down <br />
and poured the hot water into them. Once she had sat the kettle down she sat herself and said, &quot;I'm sure you're wondering why you're <br />
here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I actually was wondering that,&quot; he said as the woman took a sip from her cup. He looked in his own and saw that there was tea in <br />
there.<br />
<br />
&quot;I called you here,&quot; the woman said as he took a sip.<br />
<br />
&quot;How?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I am a witch. I'm sure you've heard some stories about the witch that lives in this forest. Well that's me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you going to eat me?&quot; he asked suddenly becoming afraid.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't eat people,&quot; the woman said waving it off.<br />
<br />
&quot;That's a relief.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I do turn those people that come here to kill me into animals though. They're out in the forest somewhere living their new lives.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't you care about them?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not really,&quot; the woman said with a shrug. &quot;They came here to kill me just because of what I am. Now back to you. I want to give you a <br />
bit of a test. If you pass then you are indeed the one I have been calling. If you don't then we'll part on good terms. Do you speak <br />
German?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;About the only word I know in German is Ja.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good,&quot; the woman said nodding. She slid a piece of paper over to him and said, &quot;Read this out loud please.&quot;<br />
<br />
He was confused about the request but took the piece of paper anyway. He didn't see how he was supposed to read it when he didn't <br />
know German. However he found he was able to say, &quot;&Auml;ndern mein K&ouml;rper in einen zehn Jahre alten M&auml;dchen,&quot; as if he had spoken it <br />
all his life. He was suddenly overcome with a wave of dizziness and he closed his eyes. When he opened them again he noticed that <br />
things seemed a little bigger. His feet had come up off the floor and his clothes were loose on him. His shoes and socks had fallen off. <br />
He felt something tickling his neck and when he reached back he felt that his hair was now even longer. &quot;What happened?&quot; he asked <br />
noticing that his voice was higher and sounded like a girl.<br />
<br />
&quot;You passed the test,&quot; the woman said nodding. &quot;I've wanted a daughter for awhile now but another witch made sure that no man would <br />
sleep with me. So I had to come up with another solution. I cast a spell to bring someone who would be my daughter here. That person <br />
turned out to be you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How old am I now?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You're ten now. I'll have to give you a name if you decide to be my daughter.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Will I be able to do magic if I do?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well you were always able to do magic you just didn't know it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think I'll be your daughter. My life wasn't that great anyway.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wonderful,&quot; the woman said the joy evident on her face. &quot;Now to give you a new name.&quot;</p>
