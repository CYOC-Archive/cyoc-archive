<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jennifer decided that the best option was to not to say anything and let her mother do the talking. Silvia run her mouth for a very long time and vented her frustrations and sadness on Jennifer’s shoulder. Jennifer couldn’t understand what her mother was saying as her speech became too slurred. Silvia passed out in the middle of her incoherent grunts and growls. Silvia’s relaxed body became too heavy for Jennifer but she tried her best to lay her mother down on the floor. Jennifer had to keep her mother safe and make sure that when Silvia wakes up from her slumber there’s no issues because of Jennifer&#39;s negligence.<br />
<br />
Jennifer took her bed’s mattress and pulled it on to the floor. Then she pushed her mother on top of the mattress and made sure that Silvia was laid on her side. Jennifer took a look at her mother’s youthful body. Jennifer wanted to make sure that Silvia was her birth mother and she raised her mother’s shirt and lowered the skirt to confirm this.<br />
<br />
Jennifer wasn’t an expert or a doctor but even she could tell that her mother’s hips and breasts for her petite body were bigger than they were supposed to be. Jennifer touched at her own body and felt similar enlargement happening in her body too. The puberty after pregnancy must have put her mother’s body in to an overdrive and that’s why she had so massive breasts and wide hips. Jennifer wondered if curse was making sure that Silvia would birth Jennifer as her mother was always twice as old as she was. Jennifer had to check one thing and placed her hand on to her crotch. Jennifer couldn&#39;t believe it when she felt hair on top of her pussy. It wasn&#39;t just a stubble but instead Jennifer had a big bushy garden on her crotch. Did this mean that Jennifer&#39;s and her mother&#39;s puberties happened earlier than they should had happened or did the puberty happen the moment they showed signs of pregnancy.<br />
<br />
Jennifer looked at her mother and thought that it could have explained her mother’s emotional behavior. The hormones from the pregnancy and the hormones from the puberty must have made her life miserable. Jennifer thought about her own puberty and wondered how much it must have sucked even more if the mood swings were twice as stronger. She couldn&#39;t think how much interesting the boys were to her mother when she was ovulating like crazy.<br />
<br />
“Ovulating like crazy,” Jennifer wondered.<br />
<br />
If the small interest in boys was doubled and puberty came earlier. That would have explain why Jennifer was texting with Frank and lying to Alex. The quirky lovey-dovey attitude would quickly turn it into a lust for men and lead up into unprotected sex. Maybe Silvia had experienced the same in the past and this was the end result. Jennifer could only speculate what the truth was. Did Jennifer’s mother have sex with a man that was way older than she was or did something else happen to her. Jennifer was getting tired from all the thinking and tucked her mother under the blanket. Jennifer then took her phone from the nightstand and left her mother in the bedroom while Jennifer walked back to the living room.<br />
<br />
The living room was a mess and looked like if someone had throw a pipe bomb in there. The whole room smelled beer and all the cans had been thrown all over the living room. The floor was full of liquid. The TV was displaying cartoons and Jennifer couldn&#39;t find the remote. Jennifer spotted her mother&#39;s phone on the living room table. Jennifer got curious and wanted to see what was inside it. Jennifer was shocked to find that her mother didn’t have lock on her smartphone. The another shock came from the fact how barren her mother’s phone’s contacts were. Social workers, Jennifer, Mother, two female names she couldn’t recognize and lastly there was a guy named…<br />
<br />
“FRANK!?”<br />
<br />
Jennifer quickly scrolled through the conversation and found out that Frank had been texting with her mother. It had to be Frank as both of their writing styles matched one to one. Jennifer couldn’t believe what she was seeing in front of her. Jennifer was fuming the more she read. Nine month ago Frank had invited Silvia to a house party that Frank was hosting at his house. Silvia had expressed to Frank that she hadn’t found a babysitter for Jennifer and wanted to decline for the offer.<br />
<br />
Jennifer couldn’t believe when she read from the phone that Frank had suggested to bring Jennifer with Silvia to the house party and pretend that Jennifer was five years younger than Silvia. Jennifer had no idea why Silvia had agreed with Frank’s idea. The conversation continued normally until month after that Silvia had sent a text to Frank that she knew Frank’s little secret. Frank had no idea what Silvia was talking about until she congratulated Frank for being a father. After that point Frank had sent similar looking angry messages to Silvia as Jennifer had received today. It was very clear from the conversation that Frank was panicking and didn’t know what to do. But what made things even more complicated was the fact that how Silvia had blocked Frank from her contacts while Jennifer was keeping Frank in her life. Why would Jennifer do that.<br />
<br />
Unless Silvia was acting like a proper mother who was dealt with a bad hand in her life while her daughter was playing footsies with her ex-boyfriend. Seeing the two conversations side-by-side it could had been a possibility that Jennifer was the one who initiated the whole thing or the she was gaslit to like it. If only Jennifer would had been able to remember what she had done that night then all of those questions would become more transparent. No wonder her mother blamed herself for what happened as it was partially her fault that Jennifer got pregnant.<br />
<br />
Jennifer tried her best to remember and open her mental locks to get a small clue which one was it. But it was useless. Jennifer had no memories of that night except the smell of…<br />
<br />
“Beer.”<br />
<br />
Jennifer looked at the unopened cans which Silvia had left on the table. Jennifer knew the consequences if she even humored herself with the thought. Would it had been reasonable for Jennifer to sacrifice her normal life to become a trailer park trash just so she could maybe remember some crummy bits from her night with Frank?</p>
