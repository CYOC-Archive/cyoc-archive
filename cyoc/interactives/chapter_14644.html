<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Corey sat down on the wooden bench, which was standing in the middle of the men’s locker room. He had just stumbled out of the gym, after having played his worst basketball game ever. None of his shots went in, he got banged up and pushed around, several of his passes were blocked, and he got fouled out of the game as well. It just seemed like this basketball game was a reflection of everything else that has been going on in his life.<br />
<br />
He only had a few friends in school, and that was the only thing that was still going for him. He had a hard time in high school, and he just wished he could take a break from everything and perhaps even get away from it all. He was lonely, burned out, sad, and depressed. How could he get out of all this?<br />
<br />
Several guys walked in, grabbed their bags out of their lockers, and left in order to catch the last bus home. Corey just sat there in silence. He didn’t feel like talking to any of them. They only seemed to care about their own lives anyway. Luckily, he knew of a few he could trust. He happened to enjoy playing basketball with one of them, and he was waiting for his friend to walk out of the gym and make it into the locker room.<br />
<br />
Peter was the very last person to walk into the locker room. That was no surprise to Corey, since Peter was usually the first one on the court as well. At first, Peter didn’t say anything. There were two other guys in the locker room, and both Corey and Peter were waiting for the right moment to talk, after the other two had left. <br />
<br />
The two students started talking about the game, when Peter walked up to them.<br />
<br />
“Hey, guys… I need to have a talk with Corey… Alone…” he said with a grin. <br />
<br />
Strangely enough, the two students immediately obeyed him, for they grabbed their bags, turned around, and quietly walked out the locker room doors. As soon as they were gone, Peter turned around and walked back to the bench, where Corey was sitting, all by himself. Peter grabbed hold of his towel before he sat down next to him.<br />
<br />
“Hey Corey, what’s going on?” Peter asked him. “You didn’t seem like yourself today…”<br />
<br />
“Oh Peter…” Corey replied quietly. “You don’t want to hear about my problems…”<br />
<br />
“How’s class?” Peter wondered. Somehow, it seemed as if Peter knew exactly what questions to ask. <br />
<br />
“It sucks… I’m failing all my classes this semester…”<br />
<br />
“How’s the job at the restaurant, where you were working as a waiter?”<br />
<br />
“It sucks… I got fired from that job the day before yesterday…”<br />
<br />
“How’s Carol, your girlfriend?”<br />
<br />
“That sucks too… We broke up last night…”<br />
<br />
“Oh, man… That explains a lot right there…” Peter replied quietly.<br />
<br />
For the moment, the two young men just stared at the white tiles on the hard, concrete floor in the locker room, not knowing what else to say to each other.<br />
<br />
“LOOK!” Corey shouted out of anger. “Life isn’t just about fun and games, you know? Life really sucks sometimes, especially when it seems like everything is going wrong all at the same time! Maybe you’re doing great in your world, but my world seems to be falling apart right now…”<br />
<br />
“I’m sorry to hear that, Corey…” Peter whispered. “Let me know if there’s anything I can do for you…”<br />
<br />
Peter slowly stood up and turned around, and he quietly walked towards the shower. <br />
<br />
Corey buried his face in the palms of his hands, for he realized that he was now venting his frustrations at his last and only friend who he had in school. <br />
<br />
Suddenly, he remembered something Peter had told him awhile ago. He vaguely remembered Peter mentioning to him that he possessed some magical power, and that he was capable of changing anything or anyone, any way he pleased. Was that true, or was he just making it up? Corey slowly got up, he removed all his clothing except his underwear, and he grabbed his towel, and decided to follow Peter over to the area where the showers were.<br />
<br />
Peter had just walked out of the shower, and he was still dripping wet. Corey stopped and just stared at him for a moment. Corey was 6’1” and was tall and skinny with dirty blond hair, while Peter stood 6’3” tall and was athletic, with brown hair, which was spiked.<br />
<br />
“It would be so cool if I could just spend some time with you, man…” Corey said quietly.<br />
<br />
“That can be arranged! You seem to be in need of some friendship, Corey. Especially now, since you’re so down and depressed, you know?” Peter replied with a grin.<br />
<br />
“I just don’t know what I’m gonna do with my life, Peter…” Corey replied with a feeling of deep sadness. “Everything’s a mess right now… I just want to jump off a cliff or something…”<br />
<br />
“No, Corey… I’m not going to allow you to go that route… Someone needs to watch you and keep you company…” Peter said with a grin, as he stood before Corey, completely naked. “You’re gonna need to remove your underwear, dude… It’ll be too big for you, pretty soon!”<br />
<br />
Corey just looked at his buddy, examining his body from head to toe. Peter had 300 pounds of rock solid muscle, along with a think layer of hair which covered his legs, arms, chest, and his cock. The handsome face, with the big, ice-blue eyes completely turned Corey on. Peter was one of the best basketball players on the team, and for a moment, Corey just wished that he could spend more time with him. Unknown to Corey, Peter had the ability to hear all his thoughts and to know all his feelings and emotions at that point in time. Peter just smiled, as he folded his muscular arms before his pecs, while looking down at Corey with a wide grin on his face.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, Corey looked up at Peter’s face again, and he noticed something odd. Has Peter grown a bit taller? With every passing second, it seemed like Peter was growing bigger and bigger. When Corey looked away and stared at the rest of the locker room, he gasped when he realized for the first time, that the rest of the locker room appeared to be bigger as well! Peter wasn’t growing at all, but Corey was shrinking!<br />
<br />
“Hey! What is this? What’s going on here?” Corey wondered, as he was now only about five feet tall. His legs were shrinking and so were his arms. His body was slowly becoming smaller, and he gasped when he turned to Peter, who was now standing more than a foot taller than him.<br />
<br />
“Peter! What are you doing? I’m shrinking!” Corey gasped, as he looked up at buddy, who was now standing almost two feet taller than him!<br />
<br />
“Just relax, Corey! I’m making you shrink so that you’re big enough to be joined with my body, without being noticed by anyone else. Isn’t that what you want?” Peter said confidently, with a smile, while looking straight down at his shrinking friend.<br />
<br />
Corey’s mouth dropped wide open as he turned around. The locker room seemed huge! He realized that he couldn’t even reach the top row of lockers anymore. But he was in for an even greater surprise when he turned around to face Peter. This time, he was staring straight at Peter’s cock!<br />
<br />
“OH MY GOD! YOU’RE HUGE!!” Cory shouted, as he saw Peter still staring at him, with an evil grin on his face.<br />
<br />
Corey just took a few steps back, as he found himself standing completely in awe of his giant friend. At the same time, he began to feel afraid and he panicked.<br />
<br />
“OH NO… I must be dreaming… This can’t be happening to me!” He said, as he took another step back. He was looking for the door, since the locker room now looked completely different to him. It seemed as if the ceiling to the locker room was over ten feet from the floor! Corey used to be able to touch the ceiling with his hand, but he was much too small for that now.<br />
<br />
When Corey spotted the giant door, he began to run towards it. The door was wide open, and Corey decided to run for it. Suddenly, the door began to swing shut on its own, and it slammed shut with a loud bang!<br />
<br />
To make matters even worse, Corey was now much too small for the clothes he was wearing! His underwear had fallen off, which was the only thing he was wearing. He was now completely naked, and he felt trapped in the locker room with a crazy, giant kid!<br />
<br />
Corey ran up to the steel door just as it slammed shut, desperately trying to reach for the handle. But he had now shrunk so much, that he couldn’t reach the handle anymore! He tried to leap up so he could grab hold of the horizontal handle so he could pull it down, which would cause the steel door to open. But it was no use; he was too short to reach it!<br />
<br />
He tried one more time and made it! Corey was hanging from the door handle, with his right arm extended all the way above his head. He held on to the handle, but the handle wouldn’t drop down! Then it dawned on him, that he had shrunk down so much, that his body wasn’t heavy enough to pull the handle down!<br />
<br />
Fatigue set in, and his fingers couldn’t hold on anymore. Not only that, but his body still seemed to be shrinking, which meant that his hands were shrinking as well! His fingers had become too small to maintain a strong enough grip on the steel handle, and one by one his fingers started to slip from the steel bar.<br />
<br />
“UUGH!” he groaned, when he fell with his back on the concrete floor. It seemed like he had fallen almost ten feet! He was scared, frightened and tired. That was nothing, compared to how he felt when he saw the shadow of a giant being block his view from the rest of the locker room! When he turned around, he realized that his giant buddy was standing right before him! Corey must have shrunk to about six inches in height, for he was now looking straight at Peter’s hairy legs!<br />
<br />
“Alright, Corey!” the giant said, as he bent down before the tiny student. “You’re gonna be with me from now on, and I’ll keep you in a safe place where nobody else can harm you, and you can’t harm yourself either!”<br />
<br />
“No… Oh no… NO!” Corey shouted, as he ran right between Peter’s legs. “GET AWAY FROM ME!”<br />
<br />
Corey raced under the wooden bench, hoping to hide from the giant Peter. But Peter spotted him, and slowly walked towards the bench.<br />
<br />
“NOOOOO!!!” Corey shouted, as he raced towards another bench, which was standing in the middle of the room. Corey hid just under the wooden leg of the bench, thinking for the moment that he had escaped the grip of the giant. He leaned with his back against the leg, breathing heavily as drops of sweat started to pour down his face.<br />
<br />
He looked over to one side, not knowing that Peter had quietly stepped over the bench, and was about to grab Corey from behind.<br />
<br />
Then Corey screamed in horror, as four mighty fingers and one giant thumb had slowly wrapped themselves around Corey’s tiny body! Corey struggled to break free, but the grip had suddenly tightened, and he gave up the struggle, in fear that the giant fingers would squeeze the life out of him!<br />
<br />
“What’s the matter with you?” Peter chuckled, as he held Corey in his right hand. “I’m trying to help you out by doing exactly what you had asked for, and you’re making such a fuss!”<br />
<br />
“Sure, I wanted your help, but not like THIS!” Corey shouted back. He was still trapped inside of Peter’s mighty grip, with no way of breaking free.<br />
<br />
Corey gasped as he looked down! It seemed like Peter was holding him twelve feet from the ground!<br />
<br />
“PUT ME DOWN! LET ME GO!” Corey shouted, as he made one more vain attempt to break loose from Peter’s grip.<br />
<br />
“I’ll put you in the perfect place I have for you!” Peter just chuckled. “You’ll be safe there, and you’ll always be with me, although you’ll be hidden from the rest of the guys in school. Nobody will know you’re with me. And I’ll keep you here for a few weeks, so you don’t have to worry about a thing!”<br />
<br />
Peter gently turned Corey’s body around, so that his back was facing Peter’s stomach. Then Peter lowered Corey’s tiny body, until it almost touched the top of his cock, just in front of his waist. Then Corey’s legs were suddenly absorbed by Peter’s cock, and his small body merged with Peter’s. <br />
<br />
“WHAT ARE YOU DOING? ARE YOU NUTS?” Corey screamed, as he saw his legs disappear inside of Peter’s skin.<br />
<br />
Cory continued to sink inside of Peter’s cock, until his own stomach was just coming out from the top of Peter’s giant cock.<br />
<br />
“Just relax, will you?” Peter chuckled, as he continued to hold on to Corey’s small chest with his fingers, while looking straight down at the tiny student. “I’m putting you in your new home!”<br />
<br />
Corey’s legs were now hanging from the bottom end of the giant cock. Peter’s skin then fused with Corey’s and Corey’s midsection was now merged with Peter’s.<br />
<br />
Peter finally let go of Corey, and looked down at the new addition to his cock. He now had his very own cock slave, and he just stared at Corey with a huge grin on his face.<br />
<br />
“PETER!! Get me out of here!” Corey screamed, as he started kicking with his legs, which were dangling from the bottom of Peter’s cock.<br />
<br />
“Corey, Corey!” Peter said angrily, as he looked down at the six-inch tall man. “Stop kicking with your legs! You’re hurting my balls, dude! Will you settle down?”<br />
<br />
Corey tried his hardest to break free from Peter, but it was no use! He placed his hands on Peter’s cock and tried his hardest to pull himself free, but his body was completely fused together with Peter’s cock! <br />
<br />
After three attempts to pull himself free, he just tilted his head straight up, looking Peter in the eyes. Peter just looked straight down, while still showing the grin on his face.<br />
<br />
“Gosh, Corey! Will you quit fussing around? You’ll wear yourself out that way!” Peter chuckled. “Just settle down and have fun! I’ll take you everywhere I go, and you’ll still be able to follow the lectures when I’m in class. During the day, you’ll be hidden inside of my underwear, and in the afternoon I’ll just take off my clothes when I’m at home! You’ll just sleep on top of me at night, and all you gotta do is take care of our cock! Sounds easy enough?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, I guess…” Corey said with a sigh. He had finally accepted his fate, and he realized that this is how things would be from now on. Peter was the only one with the power to free him, and he just had to live with being Peter’s cock slave!<br />
<br />
“I’m gonna get dressed now. I can hear all your thoughts, so just whisper if you need anything from me, buddy!” Peter said cheerfully.<br />
<br />
Peter grabbed his tower and dried himself off. Then he slipped his long legs through the underwear, pulling it up to his waist. Corey continued to look up at his giant master, until his view was blocked by the elastic band, which snapped Peter’s underwear around his waist. Corey looked around, and he could only see the white fabric of Peter’s underwear. As Peter moved around, Corey felt the motions Peter was making. Suddenly, all light was blocked, when Corey heard Peter pull up the zipper on his jeans.<br />
<br />
“Everything OK down there?” Peter said, as he looked down at his jeans, which were covering his cock.<br />
<br />
“Yeah…” Corey shouted back, while tilting his head up as far as he could go, until the back of his head was pressing against Peter’s waist. “It’s just kinda hot and dark down here…”<br />
<br />
“Don’t worry, little guy!” Peter shouted, as he sat down to put his shoes on. “We got two more periods to go. After that, I’ll take you home, and I’ll give you some breathing room. So don’t worry about a thing, you’ll be living off of my body for awhile. You won’t need a thing, and you’ll just be a part of me from now on. Nobody will miss you at school; I’ll make sure of that! Just relax, kick back, and enjoy the ride!”<br />
<br />
Peter then strolled down the hall, whistling a tune. None of the students would know that Peter was carrying Corey on his cock. And Corey slowly became used to being a part of his best friend Peter. What more could he ask for?<br />
<br />
