<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Matthew studied carefully the suit that Kim had become. Other than the hair on its head and crotch, the skin was just bare. It had the consistency and feel of a rubber glove but it was skin coloured, the tone being exactly that of Kim. The suit even had Kim&#39;s freckles. Indeed there were bikini lines on the suits shoulders no doubt from Kim&#39;s sun-baking by her parent&#39;s pool. The suit had virtually no weight to it, the heaviest part being the long blonde hair.<br />
<br />
Down the back of the suit was a slit running from neck to the small of the back. Matthew looked inside. It was empty, just a bare rubbery surface the same colour as the outside. He even peered inside the &#39;head&#39;, now just a hood. It was also totally empty, again just a bare surface. <br />
<br />
Matthew went back to the console to see what Kim had set the machine to, however he could not get it off the countdown clock screen. The countdown now said &#39;47 hours 53 minutes&#39;. Down the bottom of the screen some smaller writing said. &#39;This machine is locked until the current transformation has run for the specified time&#39;<br />
<br />
Frustrated Matthew looked for the room information booklet. All he could see was was a statement &quot;Some of our rooms are equipped with transformation mechanisms. Instructions are available on the in room computer&quot; Of course the &#39;In room computer&#39; was the console with the countdown clock on it.<br />
<br />
Not knowing what else to do Matthew picked up the room key card and headed down to reception. He explained to the girl &quot;My girlfriend has changed herself into some sort of suit. How do I get her back?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What room are you in sir?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;207&quot; he showed the girl his card.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s one of inanimate rooms. Yes there should be a console in there that would allow your girlfriend to change into a suit&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know that. She has changed into a suit&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t see the problem sir. If that is what she desired then everything is working properly. Do you know how long she set the transformation for? It should show on the console&quot;<br />
<br />
&#39;Two days&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well sir you have two days with your new suit. Enjoy. Remember, even though she may not be able to communicate with you she will be aware of her surroundings. If she is a suit she will want to be worn. I suggest you put her on and enjoy the resorts amenities. She will share your experiences&quot;<br />
<br />
Matthew trudged back to his room. The receptionist had said &quot;She will want to be worn&quot;. That reminded Matthew that he had promised to wear her. He imagined how silly he would look. A man in essentially a body stocking with a long blonde wig. What had she been thinking? She should have just turned into a shirt he could wear. He would have been prepared to become a dress she could wear. He thought when it was his turn to transform that might be what he would become not some stupid body stocking. The suit wouldn&#39;t fit him anyway, he was 6 inches taller than Kim. What should he do?<br />
<br />
Back in the room he once more examined the suit Kim had become. The material was stretchy, a bit like pantyhose, but would it hurt her to be stretched? The woman had said she would be aware of her surroundings. He vented at her &quot;I know you can hear me Kim. What were you thinking? I&#39;ll look ridiculous wearing you, hardly something I can wear to a party. However a promise is a promise. I&#39;ll put you on but I&#39;m going to put some other clothes over the top before I go anywhere&quot;<br />
<br />
Matthew picked Kim up and examined the slit at her back. He could step into her legs first. If he was going to wear Kim under his other clothes he would need to get naked first. He hoped Kim wouldn&#39;t mind cladding his naked body. Perhaps that might be what she actually wanted? It actually felt a bit kinky and he felt himself getting a boner. However if he was going to be naked while wearing Kim he should perhaps have a shower first. They had travelled a long way to get here and he guessed he might be a bit stinky for Kim given how close she was going to be to his body.<br />
<br />
So Matthew showed and shaved, then returned naked to the table where Kim was laid out. He was excited by the prospect of Kim covering his skin and his erection showed that. He couldn&#39;t help himself when he saw her there and picked her up and rubbed her against his penis. He hoped she was enjoying this as much as he was. Feeling daring he found what was left of her face and stuck his penis into the picture of her mouth. That was enough to set him off and he ejaculated into her face. Unfortunately some of his spunk went into her hair. He wasn&#39;t sure if she would like that!<br />
<br />
Feeling guilty now he took the Kim suit to the bathroom sink and washed the semen off her hair and face. It came off her rubbery face quite readily however he needed some shampoo the get the gunk out of her hair.<br />
<br />
He then left Kim on the towel rail to dry and had another quick shower himself to wash the semen off his own groin.<br />
<br />
Finally he was clean and ready to put the Kim suit on. He took her to the bedroom and sat on the edge of the bed.</p>
