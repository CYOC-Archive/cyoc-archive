<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">June was proving to be a rather active month as Juliet looked to manage things with regard to her chateau and the vineyard that was attached to it. There was of course the minor renovation of one of the old wine cellars to serve as the dance club where Chablis could indulge people&#39;s interests in seeing Animalians be &quot;provocative&quot; with a more French flair to it than the Meat Market. Juliet Renard-Argenté was largely glad that her name was not being associated with the club and that she wouldn&#39;t have to be associated with it beyond owning the building in which the club&#39;s activities would take place. In the meantime, she had some pride in seeing that her girls were growing, and in ways that didn&#39;t relate to being Animalians. This had largely related to Olympe&#39;s training and interest in the IAC&#39;s track and field events.<br />
<br />
But this proved to be only part of things that were expected as Juliet eventually got a call from Animalia asking for her help with something in Animalia. It was described as an &quot;educational opportunity&quot; in which she could help someone. She took it that it was a request closer to what she had done with her girls in the past. Essentially take someone in who had some deficiency and then tailor their education to suit their needs. It was something that Juliet took pride in with regard to her girls and thus if someone in America wanted her help, she was not about to refuse to help in that regard. This thus lead to her flying back to Animalia after the interview with Miles was completed.<br />
<br />
Her arrival, though, was not quite what she expected. She knew she was to meet someone named &quot;Mercy&quot; before meeting the person that was said needed her help, but wasn&#39;t quite sure on who that was. It was only when she found a black furred Bat Animalian waiting for her that she began to get some clue as to what was going on.<br />
<br />
&quot;You are Mercy?&quot; Juliet asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Mercy answered, &quot;and I thank you for your help.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I am not versed in criminal psychology,&quot; Juliet answered, &quot;I do not believe I can help with your program.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s not my program,&quot; Mercy answered as she lead Juliet through the airport, &quot;and the request for your help came more from one of the men selected for the program.&quot;<br />
<br />
Against her better judgement, Juliet found herself becoming a bit curious about this. There had been some messages that had been aimed to her after what had happened at the Meat Market, but they were often made online and with little understanding of things beyond lust. It was odd that a request actually came through some one else and without the obvious sexual tones to it. However, Juliet also had her concerns given that she&#39;d had enough attention to know that the people that Mercy was working included those that had found themselves on the wrong side of the law. This then increased her suspicions to make sure this wasn&#39;t some trick<br />
<br />
&quot;And just what sort of man is asking for my help?&quot; Juliet asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Admittedly he&#39;s presently rather heavy set... and was convicted on drug related charges,&quot; Mercy answered, &quot;but he isn&#39;t the irredeemable sort that would want to cause trouble.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And this man wants my help?&quot; Juliet asked as they approached the car that was waiting outside the airport, an Animalia PD police car.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think what he wants is a shot at redemption,&quot; Mercy answered, &quot;which is why I&#39;ve ultimately accepted this sort of thing before he goes into the whole system for crime and punishment. Beyond that I can&#39;t really say at this moment.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I take it only this man can explain himself?&quot; Juliet asked suspiciously as she buckled herself in in the backseat next to Mercy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Mercy nodded, &quot;some of it is related some measure of privacy and other measures of protocol that relate to the case and the program.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Which Mercy is happy to help with, correct?&quot; the Wolf Animalian driving the car spoke with a touch of humor in his voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course,&quot; Mercy grumbled, not sounding enthusiastic.<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
Meeting the man did not come without shock. Mercy had said the man was heavyset, but some of her description may have been a bit of an understatement. The man was massive and wore very baggy clothing, which did little to hid the fact that extremely overweight. Juliet couldn&#39;t know for sure on the man&#39;s size, but it was likely to be beyond what would be healthy for any Human male. His dark hair and tan brown skin gave Juliet some hint that the man was Hispanic, but she couldn&#39;t be sure and given that this was supposed to be some mission of mercy, she wasn&#39;t going to say anything judgmental. He sat in a large chair that looked like it was made for Animalia&#39;s larger Animalians. As with most police/prison visitation rooms they were separated by a thick wall of glass or plastic, though given the man&#39;s slow and pained movements, Juliet doubted he would be a threat to anyone.<br />
<br />
&quot;You came...&quot; the man said slowly and half pained.<br />
<br />
&quot;I am not one to wish to reject helping someone,&quot; Juliet said slowly, &quot;though... I would say that I&#39;m not sure I would capable of helping you...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Juan Teroz,&quot; the man said slowly, &quot;though some have taken to calling me the &quot;breaking bed kingpin&quot; for reasons I&#39;m sure you&#39;re already aware of. And it was more that I wish to help you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You wish to help me?&quot; Juliet asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Juan answered, &quot;they have given us access to reading material and that&#39;s included newspapers, online access, books... and so on. It requires good behavior, obviously, but I&#39;ve never really been the sort to want to get into trouble. And I read that aside from the vineyard that you run... a lot of your work has been dedicated to helping those with various cognitive deficiencies.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, to assure that people gain the skills they need and are not just funneled into things they can&#39;t perform,&quot; Juliet answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;I could help with that,&quot; Juan answered, &quot;a lot of what I did... before... this...&quot; he paused to gesture to himself... &quot;actually related to that kind of work, at least with school systems in the US.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You were a teacher?&quot; Juliet asked curiously.<br />
<br />
&quot;Seems odd, looking at me now,&quot; Juan answered, &quot;but yes. I was a Special Ed teacher in Arizona. It was difficult but rewarding at times, and I liked it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And what lead to this?&quot; Juliet inquired, &quot;they told me you were arrested and convicted on drug related charges?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Largely with a pretty bad accident,&quot; Juan answered, &quot;I was out hiking... fell, busted up my leg pretty good. And the doctors, well they got it back in one piece, but I also ended up addicted to the pain killers they gave me. And from there things went down hill. The doctors wanted bills paid and my insurance decided the accident was not something they covered and my salary couldn&#39;t pay it. I ended up resigning and getting caught in the drug trade as it got me access to those pain killers and eased other pressures. And... well, I knew it was wrong, which then lead to a lot of stress eating and staying out of sight on the assumption of not being seen and thus shamed. I then put on weight... and the heavier I got, the less I could hide myself. Which in turn lead to me getting caught. I&#39;m off things now, but the consequences of that accident are still with me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Juliet nodded and figured this was part of why he&#39;d applied for this program that Animalia was wanting to run to demonstrate their methods worked. Though, a part of her also seemed to get the sense that Juan was more a victim of circumstance than anything else and thus couldn&#39;t escape what he&#39;d been sucked into and generally these people were the ones who were reformed fairly easily anyway. However, Juliet wasn&#39;t involved in the program and wasn&#39;t educated in law enforcement so she couldn&#39;t say as to what should be done.<br />
<br />
&quot;And you&#39;d wish to help as a teacher in France?&quot; Juliet asked, &quot;where standards and regulations will be different from the United States?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Merely the opportunity,&quot; Juan answered, &quot;to be more than what I&#39;ve... become... I can&#39;t do that here, as once I was accused, all my licenses in the US were cancelled out. Schools here won&#39;t hire a drug addict to teach their kids, even if I&#39;m clean.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Officially, France would have similar standards,&quot; Juliet pointed out.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure,&quot; Juan noted, and then looked down, &quot;but I&#39;d figured that since your program was more privately run... I could as to help you. I mean... the conversion would deal with the weight issue, and it&#39;d be nice to fit into more normal sized pants again... but without something that would be in line with where I started before the injury... things would be empty.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see,&quot; Juliet answered, &quot;and this has you wishing to leave this country and go to one where the primary language is not English?&quot;<br />
<br />
Juan responded in French. It wasn&#39;t perfect and the accent clearly betrayed someone who had learned the language, but it was far from the broken French that most American tourists actually had when they came to the country.<br />
<br />
&quot;First, my ancestry is Hispanic, so I am familiar with the Romance Languages,&quot; Juan spoke, &quot;and admittedly my first language there is Spanish, but I learned French as well. It isn&#39;t perfect, but it isn&#39;t bad, either.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... that is impressive,&quot; Juliet said, &quot;the accent betrays that you are a learner... but it is better than pretty much every American tourist that&#39;s come to see France&#39;s vineyards. If you can work through with your conversion and can learn the required rules and regulations in France with regard to the skills needed to teach... I could see what I can do.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;d teach me?&quot; Juan spoke, his voice sounding more hopeful.<br />
<br />
&quot;More to tutor you,&quot; Juliet answered, &quot;France has its own requirements to teach, just as America does. And while I may be descended from a French noble house, I hold no power over the French government. Though... I may ask on what kind of Animalian you would wish to become? For if you do earn your place... there will be other things needed to be altered.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... I hope you don&#39;t take this the wrong way...&quot; Juan said slowly, &quot;but I was thinking on the Red Fox. They&#39;re small, swift, and would be quite nimble. It&#39;d help me avoid the sort of injury that got me onto drugs in the first place.&quot;</p>
