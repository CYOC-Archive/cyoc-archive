<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Nate couldn&#39;t help but feel excited as he crossed the area of forest that separated the street that the Ramsey&#39;s lived on from the street his own family lived on. There was a lot about Moon Lake that had gave him reason to be excited. It&#39;d turned out to be a were sanctuary and that had let him get to live out one his most favorite fantasies... being a big strong werewolf, with power to spare. And he&#39;d seen that when he got to look not only at himself in his wolf form but also in what his human form looked like after he changed back for the first time. That alone was enough to get him excited about things, but there were others.<br />
<br />
Most of the others related things Moon Lake and its secrets had done for his family. While his parents marriage had looked to be recovering and hadn&#39;t truly lost real love when they first moved to Moon Lake, Nate couldn&#39;t help but notice how fast it was healing after both his parents became weres. A werefox&#39;s bond cemented his father to his mother, and his mother&#39;s increased libido as a werecat had made both of them very happy by what Nate overheard coming from their bedroom at night. Nate had also seen Eric&#39;s shyness begun to vanish as he found love with Julie and became a were to be with her. From what Nate had observed, Eric seemed happy as a weremer, and Nate figured that was another great thing to have. The thing that raised the most excitement, however, was that his family was fine with his own sexuality and the werewolf that turned him was now his steady boyfriend. It put a spring in his step has he jogged home and listened to the leaves crunch under his shoes.<br />
<br />
As he saw the back of the Anderson home appear out of the trees as he ran through the woods, Nate found himself thinking of the surprise the Ramseys had given to him and Alex as they finished their homework. That they were planning on expanding the Ramsey family by at least one and that they would have their basement upgraded into a sort of bachelor pad for Alex and that his present room would become the new baby&#39;s nursery. That&#39;d take time, of course, but in a sense that was exciting news as it&#39;d be something for Nate and Alex to use before they could find their own place to live and actually succeed, Alex with his cooking show and Nate as a teacher/author. It was all a start that Nate liked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello, anyone home?&quot; Nate called as he came in through the back door.<br />
<br />
What greeted Nate was seeing Eric come in the front door, likely from walking Julie home with a happy smile on his face and hearing a playful giggle come out of the kitchen.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey! No, AFTER dinner,&quot; came Martha&#39;s voice giggling and sounding like she was being tickled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Said the lady who&#39;s already had desert,&quot; came William&#39;s answer.<br />
<br />
Nate hesitantly poked his head into the entryway to the kitchen, where he could soon seen a fully transformed werefox hugging a fully transformed werecat from behind with his paw like hands trying to undo an apron tied around his mother&#39;s waist. Outside of that, neither was wearing much of anything. Instead of surprise at his parent&#39;s nudity or any sort of negative reaction, Nate found himself smiling as he instinctively thought, &quot;well... they are weres.&quot; They did look happy and Nate even watched William lick affectionately at the side of Martha&#39;s muzzle as he held Martha to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s different,&quot; Martha answered, &quot;we were home alone then. Nate is home.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure he wouldn&#39;t want to watch his parents have fun together,&quot; William&#39;s red werefox eyes remained focused on Martha and he slowly began to sway side to side, swinging Martha with him.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wouldn&#39;t,&quot; Nate said quickly, &quot;but then... guy on girl action isn&#39;t quite what I&#39;m into.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;See?&quot; William gave a smile with his pointed vulpine muzzle.<br />
<br />
&quot;Eric his home too,&quot; Nate pointed out.<br />
<br />
William&#39;s smile faded into a sigh, as Martha remained firm on her point to wait until after dinner. Though neither of them changed back. They were weres in their own home, and even if they weren&#39;t, the sun was down by now. This is what they truly were, William, a dashing and sexy werefox and Martha a drop dead gorgeous werecat. Their children had also both become weres and could understand how they felt, which amounted to &quot;why should we hide who and what we are?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;After dinner,&quot; Martha promised with a small smile on her rounded feline muzzle as Eric came around the corner from the dinning room entrance to the kitchen. She let her long brown furred tail to twitch fairly quickly and in anticipation of what would come after dinner.<br />
<br />
&quot;Which does smell good,&quot; Eric spoke up referring to dinner.<br />
<br />
Martha nodded to that and then glanced over to Nate, &quot;Good. Dinner is just about ready. And how was your day, Nate?&quot;<br />
<br />
Part of Martha&#39;s mindset was to make sure her sons were fully aware and comfortable with how she and William were beginning to move into a more open marriage and letting her enjoy the extent of her sexuality. She had informed that to Eric and felt that Eric seemed to come okay with it, but hadn&#39;t been able to do the same with Nate. With no one else there, Martha figured to work that in to fully assure her sons, but she wasn&#39;t going to drop that bombshell first thing. She would let Nate talk about his day first and ultimately work to her main goal.<br />
<br />
&quot;It went good,&quot; Nate said with a smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;What did the Ramsey&#39;s want?&quot; Eric asked.<br />
<br />
Nate smiled again, &quot;that&#39;s the exciting news.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nate watched as his father&#39;s brush like tail slowly wagged behind him and the tip of his mother&#39;s tail twitched with curiosity. Eric&#39;s blue eyes also seemed to shine with some inner light that showed his own curiosity and Nate was quick to continue.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alex&#39;s parents got some time off from their own jobs recently and they&#39;re going through with it,&quot; Nate began, &quot;in this... they could very well be conceiving a baby brother or sister for Alex.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... that&#39;s certainly nice for the Ramseys,&quot; William commented and looked to Martha and thinking about their own long term plans to try for a daughter at some point. Which with a were&#39;s lengthy lifespan, they weren&#39;t looking at being too old to conceive children of their own for another two hundred years.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Nate answered, &quot;and they ultimately plan to turn their basement into a special bachelor pad for Alex and they asked me keep an eye on Alex.&quot;<br />
<br />
William and Martha both blinked as Nate smiled to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;They asked you to babysit your boyfriend?&quot; Martha wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think it&#39;s mostly just to make sure there are no wild parties or anything like that,&quot; Nate answered, &quot;and since the idea was for them to upgrade their basement into a bachelor pad for Alex... it&#39;d be something we could live in as a sort of apartment until we graduate college.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nate watched as his mother&#39;s green eyes went wide and she reached out to a side, as if looking for William&#39;s hand. William eventually took it. Nate watched as his father patted his mother&#39;s hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;I...&quot; Nate began, &quot;I thought it was exciting.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My baby,&quot; Martha said slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is a bit sudden, son,&quot; William spoke to him, &quot;you&#39;re not even out of High School yet. Martha and I can allow for some sleep overs and for you hanging out with Alex... but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a good idea to move out and be &quot;on your own&quot; at this time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But I won&#39;t be too far away and will be with Alex,&quot; Nate pointed out.<br />
<br />
&quot;I understand,&quot; William spoke as he held Martha too him, &quot;but we would like to be sure that you are ready to be independent... but the world is not an easy place. And... if you and Alex are given full independence, both from us and from Alex&#39;s parents, you&#39;d be legally responsible for just about everything.  We want you to be ready for that...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But Alex is pretty smart, and surely you and mom and his parents wouldn&#39;t just let us go under, right?&quot; Nate asked, looking for some way to get permission.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course we wouldn&#39;t just let you fail,&quot; Martha spoke, &quot;but we&#39;d want to be sure that you&#39;re ready to move out... And right now... it&#39;s too soon. Even if you and Alex are personally responsible enough to do it... it&#39;s still too early. You&#39;re young. You&#39;ll likely have more than three hundred years to live on your own together. Certainly it wouldn&#39;t hurt to stay with us... to let us protect you... to love you... as we&#39;ve always done. To let us give you the freedom to be young and not rush to grow up.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And it isn&#39;t as though we aren&#39;t saying you can&#39;t hang out with Alex or think about your futures together,&quot; William added and reached out touched Nate&#39;s shoulder, &quot;You can help Alex set up his apartment in the Ramsey&#39;s basement... but let&#39;s not rush into anything. Okay? You can even bring Alex over for the night while they&#39;re upgrading their basement and building a nursery... It&#39;s something to NOT rush, okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; Nate spoke. His excitement wasn&#39;t necessarily gone, but it was lessened a bit. He&#39;d still be able to hang out with Alex and would prevent there being a massive party, but for the moment it would seem that a full move in with Alex wouldn&#39;t be in the immediate future.</p>
