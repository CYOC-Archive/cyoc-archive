<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I gasped quietly as I heard the voice inside my head. What had I just 
done? If Rasler got messed up again because of another stupid wish, I 
wouldn't be able to forgive myself. He had already gotten in trouble 
before, but if his body was going to change because of what he thought 
I wanted, it would be because I had led him on. I couldn't help but 
nervously stare into Rasler's eyes. I tried to mutter something, but 
my mouth was too dry to get anything out. There were a few moments of 
awkward silence as I just stood there, turning a little to try to look 
away from him. <BR><BR>
Rasler's hands seemed to shift a little in place as he continued to 
watch me. Even with my head turned away, I could still catch a glimpse 
of his gaze towards me. His arms remained tense as he held his hands 
in place, refusing to let me move. Still, I couldn't turn to face him. 
After his admission, it was pretty clear that he was serious about the 
whole thing, but I still didn't know if I could say the same. I mean, 
we had been friends for as long as I can remember, and sure, we spend 
a lot of time together, but to believe that he had those kinds of 
feelings for me...<BR><BR>
My thoughts were interrupted and I had to give a small gasp when I 
noticed his arm moving. My eyes lingered on it, uncertain of what he 
was doing, but it soon became clear that he wasn't doing a thing, 
every bit of his attention too devoted to watching me. However, as the 
moments passed, it became more and more clear to me that his body was 
still shifting. I could only watch in amazement as his arm slowly 
thickened, growing wider and firmer as the seconds passed. <BR><BR>
"Trent... Every time I see you, I'm glad that you're there, and I know 
that you feel the same. I know that there's nobody else I'd rather be 
with, and if you feel the same way, then I want to make it official." 
I turned my face back towards him, trying to say something. But the 
moment I turned, I saw his eager expression, almost childish in the 
way he gazed at me. Seeing it on him, I couldn't help but break into a 
small smile as well. <BR><BR>
"I... You could get anybody you wanted, you know. Everybody in school 
likes you. I think some of the teachers would jump at the chance to be 
with you. Even if you were with someone else, I wouldn't stop hanging 
out with you or anything." <BR><BR>
"You idiot!" I heard a metallic bang as his hand pushed into the 
locker, his palm making a slight dent in it. I gaped for a moment as I 
saw it, but before I could do anything else, I felt his arms wrapping 
around my shoulders and back, closing tight around me. The motion 
surprised me a bit, but I couldn't do anything about it. It was a 
little tight, and I struggled a little, but the way that Rasler was 
looking at me, I couldn't bring myself to try to get away. "Stop 
trying to find excuses for me. I told you that I want you. Just tell 
me now, do you want to be my guy or not?"<BR><BR>
By now, it was a bit hard to move. The entire thing had been 
surprising, but his grip was only growing tighter with each passing 
second, his arms warm as they held me close and his chest pressing 
down against mine, only getting firmer as I felt myself pulled against 
him. "Rasler... Of course I would. I mean, you're the greatest guy 
I've ever met! But I don't deserve-"<BR><BR>
I didn't get a chance to finish my sentence, losing my breath as I 
felt Rasler lift me up effortlessly. His grip tightened, and his 
excitement was clear as he brought his face close to mine. "You see? 
We both want each other! So don't look down on yourself anymore. No 
matter what you think, I promise, I'm asking this because I think 
you're the best guy I could ever be with." <BR><BR>
I could barely speak. He wasn't exactly making it easy for me. This 
was my best friend telling me that he wanted the two of us to start 
going out or something! It was hard enough to try to talk when I 
couldn’t figure out what to say, but his iron grip on me wasn't making 
things any easier, either. "Rasler... Too tight..." I felt him 
suddenly release, my feet landing on the floor as I took a couple of 
deep breaths. <BR><BR>
Rasler only chuckled quietly as he stood there, his expression a 
little awkward as he looked down at me. "Sorry... Forget to control 
myself." I gave a nervous little laugh as well as I looked at him 
quietly. I can remember him hugging me a few times before, and he had 
been excited then, but I couldn't remember him ever having to control 
it. His grip had grown tighter, and by now, he was as big as I could 
ever remember him being after a hard workout. I mean, I've seen him at 
it a number of times, and we've had more than a few days where I had 
to wait for him to finish, so I knew what he looked like. Was he 
showing off for me back then? I couldn't help but wonder as I saw him 
turn his head down, looking at his feet as he just waited for me to 
recover. Was he worried about me? I mean, he had squeezed a bit hard, 
but it wasn't that big of a deal, was it? <BR><BR>
"It's alright." I looked back up at him, still breathing a bit deeply. 
I turned back to look at him as I did, seeing him awkwardly holding 
himself in his nervousness. Even in this type of situation, it didn't 
seem right to have him that awkward. "Don't worry, I'm okay. It's just 
a lot to take in. I mean... You seriously started working out for me?" 
I couldn't help but stare at him, looking at his chest as he stood 
there. I heard him chuckle as he bent his arms, tensing himself for 
me, doing his best to pose for me. He definitely wasn't experienced at 
it, but he looked impressive, to say the least. <BR><BR>
I swallowed as I kept watching him. If not for the wish I had made, I 
would've said that he was flexing harder with the way his body moved. 
However, the way his body grew was past any pump that I've seen 
before. Before, he had certainly been a stud, but now, I had no doubt 
that he was the biggest guy in the school. His chest strutted out 
inches as he tensed them, and I would need both hands to try to get a 
grip around his arms. His six-pack was deeper than what you'd see in a 
brick wall, and probably harder, too! And as my gaze kept shifting 
downwards, I got a glance at his boxer-briefs, noticing the shape 
underneath. Even though I still couldn't notice a bit of an erection, 
I could still see it there, and-<BR><BR>
"I take it you approve?" I snapped out of it as I heard him speak, his 
grin even wider now. "Ever since I figured it out, I've worked nonstop 
at it, just waiting for you to notice. If I knew this would've gotten 
you staring, I probably would've tried it a long time ago." <BR><BR>
Sure, I was staring at him, but any guy would! I've been envious of 
his body for a while, so it went without saying that I had admired it, 
but seeing it even better than it was before meant it would be 
impossible for anybody to ignore him! It would be impossible for any 
person to just stand there as he just kept on growing in front of 
their eyes! It was all I could do to hold myself, and here he was, not 
even aware that he was even better off than a few minute ago! <BR><BR>
Despite everything that was going on, all he did was stand there, 
eventually releasing his pose as he just looked at me. Despite his 
body, it wasn't hard to pull my gaze up to meet his eyes. I'm not sure 
exactly when he had gotten a head taller than I was, but his green 
eyes and perfect smile seemed as light and as charming as I could 
remember. <BR><BR>
"Trent... You said that you wouldn't mind being with me, and I 
definitely want to be with you, so please, tell me without making any 
excuses... Tell me that you want this." I saw his arm reach around, 
holding the back of my head a he bent down over me. Before I could say 
a word, I felt his lips press against mine, kissing deeply. I nearly 
shouted, but only managed to give a muffled moan into his lips as they 
firmly pressed against me, the feeling unlike any I've had before. I 
couldn't do anything against him as he held me in place, but I don't 
think I was in any condition to try, even if I could. All I could do 
was gently push my lips against his, enjoying the feeling as my arms 
slid forward, holding him as well.<BR><BR>
It was incredibly difficult for me to do anything, or even think of 
doing anything. As my hand gripped his body, I could feel him tensing 
under my grip, the strength of his body clear even though he barely 
shifted. Even when I found a place to hold onto, it was a struggle to 
hold him with his body simply growing outwards against my grip. It was 
simply impossible to press my fingers into him and I could only manage 
to cling onto his arms. It was an incredible feeling, his body holding 
me so close and his lips pressed so tight. I didn't know what to do, 
but it felt as though his mouth was leading mine, letting mine move 
exactly how to kiss back. <BR><BR>
When he finally broke the kiss, Rasler smiled for a moment before he 
immediately began blushing. He mumbled something about not intending 
to go that far, but I could barely hear his words as I tried to 
recover my breath. My mind was everywhere, and I simply didn't know 
what to say. However, as I kept staring, I felt like I had to say 
something before he had changed anymore. He had only gotten hotter 
with each second, and I felt as though I just had to say something 
before it had gone any further. I had wanted to say something now, 
before his body changed any more and make it more difficult for me to 
speak. It was already distracting enough as it was, but if it was 
going to get more sexy, then no matter what I felt, it would be far 
too distracting for me to speak with a clear mind. Okay, so I didn't 
have a clear mind after what had just happened, but I had to say 
something before it got even harder for me to talk to him.<BR><BR>
"Alright... I... I don't know if I actually swing that way, and I 
won't keep you if you ever change your mind, and you find someone else 
you like..." He opened his mouth to speak, but as he started, I 
pressed on, determined to finish before he could interrupt.  "But if 
it makes you happy, then... I'll try to be your boyfriend."<BR><BR>
He held still for a moment, simply staring at me. I looked back at him 
before he nearly shouted, his voice firm despite his excitement. 
"Yes!" He pumped his fist in the air, making a small celebration out 
of the moment, and I couldn't help but laugh at him. I didn't really 
know what I was expecting, but I was just relieved to know that he was 
still the same cheerful guy, even in a moment like this. <BR><BR>
"It's not something to be that excited about, is it? I mean, it's just 
me that you're celebrating over." I yelped as I felt his arms wrap 
around me, picking me up effortlessly as he held me close, my head 
pressed against his chest. I was a little worried, but his grip was a 
lot more careful this time, even though it was nearly as tight as it 
was before. It took me a moment, but I decided to return it, putting 
my arm around and squeezing as tight as I could, though I was certain 
that I wasn't going to be making his body move anytime soon.<BR><BR>
"It is... It really is." He kept me tight, though I could see his grin 
as I turned my head up to him, doing my best not to blush as I saw him 
doing so already. It was surprising that even when he was embarrassed 
that way, he could still seem like such a stud. I didn't really have 
anything else I could do, so I just held on tight, enjoying the 
feeling as he did the same.</p>
