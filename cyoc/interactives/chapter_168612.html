<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Evan Van Der Heide had not been intending to do much of anything that night. A rather chubby man in his late forties with a declining hairline, Evan was dressed in a t-shirt and pants, not exactly something you&#39;d go out on the town in.<br />
<br />
He was just heading out to go do some last minute shopping for his wife at home, keeping a list of all the items he had wanted to buy, taking the list out occasionally to glance over it. He remembered when his life was not quite so monochrome and regretfully day to day. He had once been a hard partying young man in his younger years, enough that his own father had sent him off to military school. That had basically ironed the fun out of him, and now, Evan was left with a life he increasingly realized he never wanted to live, and a wish he and his wife could spice things up a bit. He just didn&#39;t know whether she would be up for that.<br />
<br />
He was just looking at the list one more time on his way to the super market when he came across the door.<br />
<br />
Evan was immediately sidetracked by the sounds and sights of the party going on inside, remembering the world he had once lived in. He looked down at his stocky dad bod physique, and only thought about how direly out of place he was going to be if he tried to step inside. He was then reduced to suppressing a drooling reaction when he saw the doorman. It was like standing in the presence of a physical god - being at awe of this man&#39;s attractiveness, even though Evan had only ever been interested in women.<br />
<br />
“Enter, changing to someone completely new and experience the best night of your life. Or leave.”<br />
<br />
Those words seemed to reverberate through Evan, and he considered his options. He could go on and shop like he&#39;d agreed to, and just forget he saw anything, be the good little guy that his dad always wanted him to be...or he could step inside here, and try and live the life he&#39;d been cheated of. His choice was made as he stepped inside, his eagerness translating into a shaky response as someone tried to offer him drinks.<br />
<br />
The inside was as amazing as he thought it would be.<br />
<br />
Full of young people dancing, making merry and enjoying their lives rather than worrying about taxes or what their parents might think, Evan was immediately envious and wished he could be as he was or better. There was a bar with numerous drinks of a wide variety of colors and sizes off to the side, and people were coming and going, taking these drinks and shotgunning them down. Evan found himself walking over to the bar. He knew he shouldn&#39;t. He had to drive home after this after all! But he couldn&#39;t very well help himself. The enthusiasm and the party atmosphere was contagious!<br />
<br />
The bartender looked Evan over and said with a knowing grin, &quot;I know what you&#39;re gonna want, my friend. Let me give you something to liberate you...completely.&quot;<br />
<br />
Evan watched as a drink was put into his hands quickly and suddenly, almost shoving him back, and was left looking down at a drink that seemed due to the light to be shifting from one color to the next. Amazing what these guys could do with simple alcoholic ingredients he thought to himself. There was still time he guessed to just enjoy the party atmosphere... fuck it, he thought to himself. I never get to enjoy my life.<br />
<br />
So Evan shotgunned it down like he&#39;d seen so many others around here do. Evan was nigh on immediately hit by an amazing sensation, through his face down to his gut and then traveling through his legs and even hitting his manhood. It had been literal decades since Evan had felt his penis reacting like this. It made him give a rather lopsided grin and sway on his feet a little bit. Something was...funny about that drink! Was he drugged?<br />
<br />
He could see a bathroom in the distance, and at first Evan started to try and take a seat, but the noise and activity was making it difficult to get his bearings. He felt weird in his shirt, his gut was rumbling and quivering. He could feel something was going on. His face seemed to be tingling, and he chuckled somewhat dumbly, &quot;I-I think that was a pretty strong drink!&quot; Half way through his sentence, his voice seemed to crack a bit.<br />
<br />
He wondered why that might be. The last time his voice had cracked like that, he&#39;d been some teenager.<br />
<br />
Evan was dimly aware of his shirt starting to feel weird on him. Like it was billowing for some reason more and more. His pants were also feeling funny on him too. He started getting up and making his way over to the bathroom. Walking in these shoes was weird! Evan chuckled, noting his laughter sounded high and similarly like his voice was cracking a bit. Fuck, he thought to himself, I must sound like a teenager! What the hell did that drink do to my voice?<br />
<br />
Evan was sidetracked by one of the women on the floor starting to grind and twerk her ass on him, specifically on his groin. Evan almost felt his eyes roll back from how good that felt, and for a moment he leaned into it. He pressed his errant, rock hard cock against her body, and heard her address him, &quot;Work that body, pretty boi!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Heh, you think I&#39;M pretty?&quot; Evan chuckled, barely even hearing his abnormal voice over the crowd as he had gotten too close to it. After a moment, she seemed to go off and find someone else to delight. He hadn&#39;t even thought to mention he was a married man, but then, he figured if he didn&#39;t say anything about the club, his wife did not have to know. As Evan kept moving, he saw his shirt increasingly hanging off of his body.<br />
<br />
Evan was gonna need to get a new shirt soon! He laughed at the idea, not even bothered any more by his voice.<br />
<br />
As Evan got to the bathroom, he became aware of the fact that all of a sudden it was all quiet. He was alone in here. Alone with a seriously unfamiliar face staring back at him in the mirror. He almost figured he was with someone else in here when he stepped closer and that guy in the mirror stepped closer. Evan&#39;s hand darted to his face.<br />
<br />
He could see himself cradling his face, his new face.<br />
<br />
Evan was now around 21 or so, though his looks made him seem much younger. Everything about him screamed &quot;club kid&quot;. He was a lot thinner than he&#39;d been when he walked in and while he&#39;d always felt like he could use some weight loss, this wasn&#39;t how he envisioned it going. He could see he had a string of small ear piercing rings in just one ear, long and coiffed luscious black hair as opposed to his usual brown, bright blue eyes, and somewhat pale skin. Was he wearing...make up? Fuck, even if he wasn&#39;t, he was gorgeous, almost feminine.<br />
<br />
He chuckled somewhat dumbly when he saw he had red nail polish on, &quot;Wow, whoever I am really goes all in on this. I look like...like...&quot; Again that bubbly, light voice, slight crack to it. Evan was still himself mentally, but there was something more to him now. He felt...free.<br />
<br />
The shirt came off in short order, and Evan stood there in front of the mirror, regarding a well muscled physique. Sure he looked girly face wise, but his body was well toned...though it significantly lacked size. He seemed to be all tone mostly, his ass seeming to be his biggest asset. When Evan went and slapped it, he shivered and felt his cock go ramrod erect again. &quot;Wow, I feel great! I look great, too!&quot; Evan put his shirt back on and winked at himself.<br />
<br />
Sure he should be at least a little unsettled by this sudden transformation and how he was looking and feeling, but this was everything Evan had wanted. He was finally free to enjoy his life. Fuck going shopping, Evan wanted to party right now!<br />
<br />
Even though it was mostly ill-fitting, Evan managed to get his pants pulled tighter via his belt, as tight as he could get it to look good on his ass, and eventually, the shirt came off again as Evan leaned into the increasingly rowdy party atmosphere. Just seemed like everybody wanted to dance with him! He was loving it! A woman brought him into a hot, heavy kiss, grinding her body against his. Sure his dick was long and less girthy now, but the sensitivity was off the fucking charts!<br />
<br />
She seemed delighted by him dancing with her, and even though over the heat and the mess of people he couldn&#39;t really see much of her, she was definitely into him. When she groped his dick between dance moves, he chuckled, &quot;Babe...babe, you&#39;re gonna make me jizz my pants going at me like tha---Oooh!&quot; And there it was. Evan felt it give, and his boxers thankfully absorbed the most of his load. He almost lost his balance and found himself falling into dancing with someone else.<br />
<br />
A guy, surprisingly enough for Evan. Dude just could not get enough of Evan&#39;s tightly muscled ass. &quot;Dude...I&#39;m like...straight and stuff...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure you are!&quot; Was the only response that he got from the guy - at least he assumed that was directed at him. This music was so amazingly loud...<br />
<br />
Evan found himself grinding on his new paramour&#39;s dick just to make sure his dance partner was satisfied. He didn&#39;t want to leave his new friend frustrated, and besides, he knew he was mostly straight, so there was really no problem in a dalliance here or there. It all felt good anyway, so why was there a problem at all? Evan was brought into his first gay kiss by his dance partner, and he knew as they separated he was going to need to do that more often. Women were good and all, and he wasn&#39;t about to go 100% gay, but he needed to experiment!<br />
<br />
The party seemed to go on for hours, and Evan kept going even as people started to leave, dancing and grinding on anyone who would let him. He found himself accepting a necklace around his neck with a golden egg shaped item on it, not even thinking twice about it. He just wanted to have some fun, and if one of his fans wanted to give him something like that, he was not gonna refuse em!<br />
<br />
But before long, the night was well and truly done, and Evan found himself one of the last ones heading out the door. He had a variety of hickies on his neck and upper chest, and his boxers had absorbed a few more of his loads. He was gonna need to get a new pair! As he started to head out, the door man said to him, &quot;As long as you carry that gold necklace, you can retain your present form. Return to what you were by removing it...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, but can you fuck me?&quot; Evan responded jovially, though he took more in than he seemed. The man didn&#39;t respond though, and simply ushered him outside. As the party atmosphere faded, and Evan found himself alone and in his new form standing outside, shirtless and realizing how cold it was, his mind started to return to him.<br />
<br />
He wiped his palm on his forehead, &quot;Ohh fuck, my wife! How---ohh, ohh man! What time is it?&quot; Evan started frantically moving and looked around for a clock. Strangely it seemed to be about an hour and thirty minutes after he left to go get groceries. He tilted his head. He remembered spending literal hours in there. The young man could not see any of his fellow partygoers to try and communicate with about this, and he knew his wife was probably worried.<br />
<br />
But Evan also knew he couldn&#39;t well return home looking like this! But he also didn&#39;t want to lose out on this young, super-attractive form he had came to acquire. Plus...if he could have sex with his wife like this, it&#39;d probably be like, really good. &quot;Wow, I go out shopping and I become this tight, toned young guy. I gotta find a way to experience more of this...&quot;<br />
<br />
Evan heard a car driving by on the road nearby, and looked.</p>
