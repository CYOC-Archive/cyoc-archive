<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">*again, not &quot;officially&quot; back. But I&#39;ve been working on some stuff. Here&#39;s a rather steamy chapter to get back into the swing of things - bj88<br />
<br />
When Spencer returned home to find her father downstairs in just his boxers making coffee. He had shifted back since finishing his mid-morning love making session with Maggie. Spencer was grateful she didn’t have to have the impending conversation (most likely her father lecturing her about breaking his rules again) while staring at her father’s sheath. <br />
<br />
“Spencer, what were you doing out?” Evan demanded. He wasn’t making much of an impact on her, not while standing in their kitchen in his Red Sox boxers. <br />
<br />
“Needed some fresh air Dad, chill. I see you and Mom are finished. What’s with the underwear? Didn’t feel like breathing in all the stank.” she said. If that wasn’t such a good reason, Evan would have derated her for being so sassy. He said nothing further, just shooed Spencer away with a wave of his hand. <br />
<br />
“That girl, what am I going to do with her?” Evan sighed. He finished sipping his coffee and then went to dress for the day. Then called to Spencer that he would be working in the garage. Not that she cared much. As long as her father was home, and without a distraction (meaning her mom), she couldn’t go out. Couldn’t do much of anything. Well there was one thing… And she hadn’t done it in a few days, which left Spencer quite tense and needy. <br />
<br />
She’d grown accustom to getting “relief” at least once a week from her now ex-boyfriend. Spencer wasn’t ready to just send Nate a text and outright ask him if he could scratch her itch. And now he had his sort-of girlfriend. And Spencer didn’t know any other male weres who would be willing to sleep with her. So taking matters into her own paws was the only option for the time being. <br />
<br />
Once in her room, Spencer locked the door and stripped off her clothing. Rooting around in a box stowed deep in her closet, she found what she was searching for. A ten inch dildo shaped like a wolf’s cock. The knot was nearly two inches in diameter. <br />
<br />
Lying back on her bed, Spencer let her fursona out. Black fur broke through her skin, silver and gray in places. The thick undercoat covered her nipples and genitals well. Her ears stretched upwards into near perfect triangles. They twitched as the changes moved to Spencer’s face. Her nose turned black before slowly merging with her upper lip. Her skull made a subtle crack as it pushed forward into a lupine muzzle. <br />
<br />
She had to roll over as her tail sprung from her back. Length to match any panther, but bushy enough for a wolf, with that same gray undercoat. Spencer whipped it back and forth, fanning her hot sex as she did. Pressure built in her feet, claws bursting through the existing nail. Dangerously curved claws that showed the panther in her. Spencer flexed her growing paws and then began kneading her growing breasts. <br />
<br />
They reached what she guessed was a DD cup. The large, furry orbs bounced as Spencer wiggled her hips. She took the pseudo cock in one paw, and aimed it at her snatch. It slide in easily, and Spencer didn’t stop pushing it in until she felt it hit a wall. She was able to take all of it, even the bulbous knot. Spencer stifled a howl as she began pumping the cock in and out of her nether lips. <br />
<br />
A deep purr resonated from her throat, and as Spencer got closer and closer to her climax those purrs turned to deeper growls. At least, her cunt squeezed its muscles around the dildo, and Spencer buried her face into a pillow to muffle her howl of pleasure. <br />
<br />
Downstairs, in the garage working on his Jeep, Evan faintly heard what he recognized as a howl of pleasure. He knew what his daughter was doing, and did his best to ignore it. All were did it, there wasn’t anything unusual about it. Evan would have just preferred not to be party to it. He put a pair of headphones on and continued his work, happy to have music drowning out the increasingly loud howls Spencer released from her self induced orgasms. <br />
<br />
------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Later that same day… <br />
<br />
By the time night fell, Martha and William were both certain something had happened with Eric. Whether it was the previous night, or during his “chat” with Spencer they didn’t know. But whatever the reason, they were glad Eric was happy. <br />
<br />
A little preoccupied by their joy over Eric making friends, the two parents finally remembered they had another son to think about, so they called Nate just before the two went upstairs for some fun of their own. <br />
<br />
“Hello?”<br />
<br />
“Hi Nate, it’s just me. How are things?” William asked casually. <br />
<br />
“Uh, okay. What about you guys? Anything interesting happen?”<br />
<br />
“Not really.” William knew better than to mention Eric’s “date” with Spencer in their backyard. Nate would only tease his brother with the information. Sometimes it was best to just keep secrets. <br />
<br />
“Should we expect you home before dinner tomorrow? It will be a school night.” <br />
<br />
“I don’t know yet. As soon as I figure out my plans, I’ll text or call you.” Nate said. Currently he was sitting upright in bed, Kenya snoozing peacefully beside him. The two went on their walk, and then high-tailed it back to her apartment for some more fun. <br />
<br />
And it wasn’t that Nate didn’t enjoy his time with her, because he so very much did. But he wasn’t interested in pursuing this sort of relationship long term. The whole “friends with benefits”. “no strings attacked” bit was new to him. Truth be told, Nate wasn’t sure if it was “no strings attached”. He did like Kenya. He just wished she’d spend a little more time talking rather than fucking. <br />
<br />
“Alright. Just stay safe. Make sure your lady friend is taking her…”<br />
<br />
“I know Dad, I know! I’ll call tomorrow. See ya.” Nate hung up before his father could get another word in. The panthress beside him stirred in her sleep, but failed to wake. <br />
<br />
Nate sprawled out on the king sized bed, glad his paws weren’t hanging off the edge like they did in his own bed. It was equipped for a teenage boy, not an eight foot tall werewolf. <br />
<br />
“I just have to figure out how to get closer to her. And not physically.” Nate thought to himself. He rolled over, and threw an arm around Kenya’s black furred body. She purred in her sleep at his touch, and Nate brought her body closer to his. His rocket edged out of its sheath, but Nate forced it back down. He wasn’t interesting in doing anything at the moment. Other than lying in bed with this beautiful creature in his arms. <br />
<br />
------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
“So how’s Nate doing?” Martha asked when William came to bed. <br />
<br />
“I’d say he’s doing okay.” William chuckled. <br />
<br />
“Do you think anything will come of this relationship he has?” Martha wondered. <br />
<br />
Since Nate had hit his teenage years, he’d gone on numerous dates. But had very few relationships. Martha worried about him, and more importantly his taste in women. None of the dates he’d brought back to meet his family were up to her standards. They were either flighty, air headed, or simply out for a good time. She hoped Nate would be able to find someone decent, with at the very least half a brain. Martha was getting really tired of all empty headed cheerleader types. <br />
<br />
“And now with him a werewolf, that narrows down the field of eligible women. I don’t doubt there are females of other species willing to go out with him, but are they worth the effort?” Martha wondered. <br />
<br />
“Martha?” William broke his wife’s train of thought. He had stripped down to his undershirt and briefs. Standing at the end of the bed with a worried face. <br />
<br />
“Sorry, I lost myself for a moment.” <br />
<br />
“I guessed so. If you’re worrying about Nate, don’t. He’s a good kid. Hadn’t had the best of luck finding someone he really likes, but then again none of us were experts at his age. Took my twenty years to find you.” William said. <br />
<br />
“I suppose you’re right.” Martha sighed.<br />
<br />
“Of course. But now, I’d like to spend some time focusing on us.” William peeled his shirt off, and then kicked his boxers to the ground. His penis was half erect, a single drop of pre on the head. Martha smiled, and sat up in bed. She was in her sleepwear as well, which just consisted of an oversized shirt of William’s. <br />
<br />
At the sight of her husband’s semi-hard cock, Martha prepared to shift. Stripping off the navy t-shirt, Martha felt her skin tingle as fur started to blossom all over her body. Red-orange fur covered her back, upper arms, thighs and the top portion of her face. The fur on her forearms, calves and feet, and the backs of her soon-to-be pointed ears was black. Her chest size doubled, and with it white fur sprouted over her breasts. It grew thicker and thicker, until the fur concealed her dark nipples. <br />
<br />
Triangular ears swiveled atop Martha’s head as her muzzle pushed forward. She yipped in pleasure, taking a paw to her moist folds. Her toes stretched and flexed as pleasure wracked her body. Then her entire foot started to extend, hard, black pads forming on the bottoms of her paws. Martha felt the final change hit her spine, and soon her tailbone shot from her like a bullet from the barrel of a gun. Her bushy fox tail swished in the air, fanning her scent toward her mate. <br />
<br />
As soon as Martha finished changing into her vixen form, William assumed his fursona. The transformation virtually identical to hers, the only difference came when the changes began to affect William’s cock and balls. Now encased on a furred, orange sack, his balls swelled to match his virility. Martha reached around and gripped the base of William’s tail. <br />
<br />
He yips in pleasure, his cock extending further from his sheath. Once at full mast, over a foot long with a wet and pointed tip, William moves his hips closer to his wife’s wet snatch. He takes a paw and parts her damp slit. The hot flesh inside throbs at his touch. Martha shudders, mouth hanging open at a loss for words. <br />
<br />
“Put it in, do it now!” she screamed. William squeezes her breasts and leans over Martha. His muzzle inches away from Martha’s ear, he whispers. <br />
<br />
“You want it? Do you want me to put my hard cock inside you?” <br />
<br />
“Yes, oh god yes! Put it in William, give me your cock!” Martha begged, pulling William closer by wrapping her legs around him. William licks her cheek and pushes forward. The head of his cock teases Martha’s lips. Martha moans again, pulling him closer and closer. <br />
<br />
“Just say the word, and it’s all yours darling. Tell me what you want, and you can have whatever it is you want” William said. <br />
<br />
“Please?”<br />
<br />
“Maybe not that particular word. I’m looking for more of a phrase. I should have been clearer I suppose.” William almost laughed. Here they were mid-coitus and he was in full teacher mode. Meanwhile Martha was panting in anticipation. Her husband’s red rocket was so close, so very close but not inside her yet. And she more than needed it inside. <br />
<br />
“Fuck me William.” Martha’s voice was barely a whisper. William smiled and obliges. His cock slips inside, the narrow head butting against the top of Martha’s slick hole. <br />
<br />
“Oh yes, more!!! Fill me up William! Fuck me with your cock! Please, more!” Martha cried out. William wastes no time and shoves himself forward. His entire cock pops inside, the knot swollen and locked in tight. Quickly thrusting in and out until Martha was overwhelmed with pleasure. Her body goes half-limp, as William’s cock rams into her walls. Martha regains some control over her body and starts gyrating her hips in tandem with William’s thrusts. <br />
<br />
“Ya, just like that darling. Further, deeper. I know you can. Push more!” Martha moaned. <br />
<br />
William pinched her nipples as he pushed until his balls were pressed against Martha’s inner labia. The lips of her pussy were soaked, and puffed out to show her state of arousal. The heady scent coming from them enticed William to push even further. Until at least his cock hit the end of her love tunnel. His scrotum was wet from Martha’s juice, and his knot was at least an inch inside her. <br />
<br />
“Ready?” William asked. <br />
<br />
“Yes.” Martha breathed. This time when William pulled out, Martha did blackout. Her body was overcome with intense feelings. William’s knot hit her G-spot perfectly, and that did it for her. Though unconscious, her vagina still clamped down on his swollen shaft. Girl cum poured out and around William’s shaft. He continued to make small pumping motions until he too came. <br />
<br />
He wet and bloated balls were yanked up by an unforeseen force. Cum was pumped into his cock, and then shot deep into his wife’s womb. Their cum mixed inside Martha’s snatch, spilling out all over their bed. William fell forward, resting his head between Martha’s large breasts. The two remained like that, peacefully resting wrapped in each other’s embrace and cum, until the restlessness in their loins woke them for another round of intense love making.  <br />
