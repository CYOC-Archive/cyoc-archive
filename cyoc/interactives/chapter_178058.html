<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“MMMH?!” <br />
<br />
Well. This isn’t quite what you expected to get up to today, and boy oh boy, you have a funny feeling that things are going to get worse from here. A feeling SO funny, in fact, that your ass actually kinda… tickles a bit.<br />
<br />
You can worry about that later, though, you should probably get back to getting as far away from this thing as humanly possible. However, as you move to do so, you feel… something else. You don’t really know how to describe it. It’s like your mind is being pulled much like your clothes and limbs were earlier, but much softer than before. That certainly doesn’t make you feel any more comfortable with it, though. You already tore your clothes off from resisting, you’d prefer the same doesn’t happen to your head. You try to scoot yourself back but… your muscles just don’t seem to respond. Your fingers twitch, but don’t move. Are you being held in place? What the hell is this?!<br />
<br />
You try to force your head backwards but your lips stay firmly locked on. You try to move an arm upwards to pry it off, but you feel like your arms have weights inside of them. It’s so hard to move… and the tickling in your ass is starting to get a bit worse. To add even more fuel onto the fire, you actually feel like you’re on fire. Well, you feel really hot, anyways. Regardless, now is a great time to panic.<br />
<br />
You struggle with all your might to lift your hand up to your trembling lips. Reluctantly, you try to prod at the flesh with your tongue, trying to push the flesh away from your lips, but doing so actually seems to have a rather different effect than you could’ve possibly imagined. In fact, the more you poke, it kinda… seems like the Tanuki’s crotch is sinking into itself. The disgusting taste almost seems to disappear… along with your ability to taste anything. Soon enough, you can’t even reach the Tanuki&#39;s flesh with your tongue. Even with just your lips you can start to feel the sensation of its flesh sinking inwards, creating some kind of new opening. At the same time, your lips kind of feel like they’re sinking into the skin as well, to the point where you can’t really feel the seam between them and the Tanuki. You try to pull back your tongue, but it doesn’t come back into your mouth. It… keeps going, deeper and deeper into the new opening leading to the Tanuki’s insides. It becomes numb, you can’t taste anything, but you can swear it’s shifting somehow. Growing. Changing. Stark contrast to the rest of you, as your body continues to feel warmer and warmer you could almost swear the Tanuki is bigger than it was just a second ago.<br />
<br />
You moan, what the hell is happening to you? Almost on cue, the pulling sensation on your head seems to suddenly intensify as you feel as if you’re jolted upwards. However, your body is still seated in place, as you can now see… Wait, why can you see yourself?<br />
<br />
You feel as if you’re having some sort of out-of-body experience, looking at yourself from behind,  but at the same time you’re still very much in your body looking and seeing nothing but a close up of the crotch you’ve become conjoined with. Your ass tickles so fucking much now, your breathing intensified, as difficult as it is with your nose pressing up against the cock. However, you swear that you can see your ass at the same time, and you don’t like what you see. Your anus appears to be shrinking, squeezing tighter and tighter, the flesh becoming stitched together at the molecular level until there is no more opening. At the same time, however, your butt seems to be a bit plumper than you thought it was before.<br />
<br />
Your stomach growls loudly as your ass continues to slightly swell bigger and bigger. Your breath quickens as you try to calm yourself down, but your thoughts are interrupted by a slight itching sensation on your scalp, and then on your nose. You open your eyes. There’s… hair on your nose. YOUR hair. You can feel it, nay, you swear you can somehow see it too, like it’s being pushed out of your skull and dropping down; the sweat from the heat helping the loose hairs maneuver their way down to the floor. Likewise, your body hair also seems to be falling out. It’s so disturbing to feel and ‘see’... but fuck it feels so good. You hate to admit it, but something’s- ah!<br />
<br />
The tickling is beginning to intensify all over your body. Your stomach appears to be gurgling at regular intervals now, your insides shifting and getting closer together. There’s a mild tightness in your insides that causes you to become lightheaded, seemingly making the rest of your hair fall out quicker until you sense something new flowing through your body. Your skin begins to change shade, appearing to become slightly darker, pinker, smoother. You feel new sensations, the wind rustling through fur, the light wiggling of a tail, the nervous system of the Tanuki finally reaches you and makes you one. At last, the moment you were dreading finally comes, as the tanuki appears to move. Its arm seems to be moving on its own, just slowly reaching upwards as if intending to grab at something in front of it. You feel so uncomfortable, you swear you see your body steaming from the heat, the steam carrying away bits of yourself, dissolving your mass away. Your arms are considerably shorter now, no longer touching the ground. Your ass tickles so much, the way you swear that it’s getting bigger… your insides squeezing together into something new, everything is so alien. So arguably horrifying. Yet… you can’t help but feel another trance coming on as your stomach suddenly makes the loudest noise it’s made yet as the squeezing sensation in your body starts to subside. There’s something new inside of you. Something… moving inside of you. Something new being created.<br />
<br />
The groaning of your ‘stomach’ doesn’t stop. In fact, not only does your belly not stop making noise… it begins to feel full. As if you’ve just eaten a large Thanksgiving feast. The growth of your ass, miniscule at first, begins to become much more noticeable as it seems to pick up speed. Along with it, your belly begins to bloat, something pushing against it from within. <br />
<br />
Bigger, and bigger; yet smaller, and smaller. <br />
<br />
You feel a sense of vertigo as the steam appears to steal more and more mass from your legs, your arms now a quarter of their former size. A pressure from within begins to build, forcing your hands to join in with the bloating process as you feel more and more full. Your hands soften, thicken, your fingers being stretched flat into your ever-rounding form. By this point, all of your body hair appears to be gone. The breeze of the cave feels so wonderful on your new pinker skin, you just can’t help but feel so… jealous. Jealous that you can’t rub your hands all over yourself so you can see how smooth you are. You want to feel it, you want to… M- mmmh…<br />
<br />
Almost on cue, you get your wish, the Tanuki’s hand reaches down to you, cupping your growing belly into its paw. You… can feel what he feels now. You’re so silky smooth… so… horny… It continues to rub you as you grow more and more, its paw now almost the size of half your torso. <br />
<br />
Your waist has thickened to the point of your belly being indistinguishable from your buttocks. The weight from both starting to move downwards in your body as gravity starts to take effect. Your legs are now so small that your butt now stretches out further than they do, your feet finally starting to thicken and absorb your toes. Your arms are now nothing but nubs. You don’t think you’re breathing anymore, you can’t feel your nose anymore, but that’s okay. You don’t need to breathe. The Tanuki’s blood is now yours, your body is now his. His fur seems to agree with you. Although your pinkening skin is still relatively silky smooth, short, dark brown, fuzzy fur begins to slowly spread down from where your head once was, spreading the tickles all over your entire body.<br />
<br />
It lets go of your body, standing back up straight and sending you falling back down. You swing from his crotch, your body now too small to touch the ground. That isn’t to say you’re very small, oh no, you’re swelling a lot. Your chest is even beginning to swell. Your insides have already solidified into two new forms, the new organs continuing to swell and fill up. Your former mouth continues to widen as your body continues to shrink and pull itself closer and closer to the base of your host’s penis. Rounder, thicker, tighter, only a slight remnant of your back curve left to signify the little space between the two growing orbs inside. The Tanuki’s hand moves up towards its penis. It rubs itself off, its closed eyes and vacant face now also resembling masturbatory bliss as it begins to pick up the pace. It feels so good...<br />
<br />
Y- You’re so… f- full… mm- MMMMHHH! You didn’t even realize your penis was still there. It’s so puny and pathetic compared to you now, though. You want it to go away, you’re better than it. The orgasm is so weak, only a few drips of what remained of your own cum drip out before it seals up and joins the same fate of your limbs as it is drawn up and stretched flat into just another part of skin that slowly starts to become overrun with hair. The Tanuki’s hand picks up the pace, seeming almost desperate for a release, the body itself slowly starting to awaken as you shrink into your true form.<br />
<br />
You’re absolutely huge as far as testicles are concerned, as tight as you’ve gotten, the tickling never stops. You feel a sense of bliss, a light feeling of peace, as if you know that nothing will ever go wrong ever again. You’re so lucky.<br />
<br />
The changes begin to finalize as the last remnants of your head fade further and further into the Tanuki’s crotch. Your eyes feel so heavy, your brain feels so distant now. You wonder where it went, or where it will go. No, it doesn&#39;t matter. You don’t need it anymore. You don’t need anymore. You just need to do what you’re supposed to do.<br />
<br />
The Tanuki’s grip quickens as you are both submerged into a world of pleasure.<br />
<br />
What you’re supposed to do…<br />
<br />
The Tanuki’s legs wobble. Its mouth twitches, Its eyelids twitch.<br />
<br />
Y- You need to…<br />
<br />
It falls over backwards, releasing its first ragged breath out into the world.<br />
<br />
N- Need to…<br />
<br />
“A- A- A-” The crackling sounds of a voice attempt to escape from its throat, hitched back by his inability to inhale from the pleasure.<br />
<br />
… Need… C… C…<br />
<br />
“A- AAAAAAAAHHHH!” The voice erupts from his throat as you are finally used, and your eyes shut for the last time as a white substance from within. You fall into mindless bliss, quickly starting to work on refilling yourself almost immediately after the process finished.<br />
<br />
Your new host, on the other hand, is feeling quite dazed. He doesn’t even seem to realize what he just did, in fact he can’t quite seem to remember anything... how odd. The cave certainly looks familiar, it’s probably his den, but nothing else seems to stand out to him as immediately recognizable. He shrugs, oh well, it would probably come back to his later. The creature yawned and stretched before scurrying off into the darkness of one of the passageways in the wall, travelling back to the surface in the hopes of finding some sucker to trick.</p>
