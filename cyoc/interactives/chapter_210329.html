<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">On their way to getting ice cream, Little Oliver kept probing Big Oliver about his past life. To prove that Jackson was now, indeed, actually Oliver himself now. Big Oliver answered all of the questions. Where he had lived. What he liked to do as a kid. What his favorite music was. <br />
<br />
Big Oliver, of course, was starting to become irritated with all the questions. But his nephews were five, and that&#39;s what five year olds do. Ask an inexhaustible number of questions that really didn&#39;t have any rhyme or reason. But Big Oliver was patient with the little guy, and just kept right on answering his questions. <br />
<br />
They couldn&#39;t get to the ice cream shop soon enough, in Big Oliver&#39;s mind. Ice cream would do the truck at shutting the kid up. Ice cream always shut up little children as they become too absorbed in the delicuous, sweet, cold, and creamy substance. At least Connor seemed to be pretty quiet, listening to all the interesting questions his brother seemed to be asking about Big Ole Ollie. <br />
<br />
Upon arrival at the shop, Little Oliver was still hopeful about somehow turning back. Even if it meant it would take a little longer than he wished. Afterall, that shop wasn&#39;t going anywhere. He just had to hide his time and act naturally. Or at least as naturally as a 39 year old blue-eyed, blond-haired man could act as a small little 5 year old with big brown half moon-shaped puppy dog eyes and dark brown hair that was so adorably spike up could act. At least any strange anomalies in his behavior could easily be overlooked as a small child just being silly. Which would also be his bane at the same time. He could never be taken seriously, no matter how insistent he might be that he was once a grownup. <br />
<br />
Predictably, in Big Oliver&#39;s mind, the boy DID shut up once his eyes grew really large upon seeing all the flavors of ice cream behind the glass. Both twins had to stand on their tip-toes and put their little bump of noses to the glass to be set to peer in. Little Oliver wasn&#39;t aware just how much he was emulating a typical little kid. He WAS hungry for some ice cream, and he DID need to be able to see in there. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oohh!! I want the blue one!&quot; said his twin brother next to him. &quot;What kind is that, Uncle Ollie!?&quot; <br />
<br />
Little Ollie was about to answer, but quickly caught himself. He wasn&#39;t supposed to be able to read yet. Not big words anyway. <br />
<br />
&quot;Dammit, I have to act like a dumb little kid!&quot; he thought to himself. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah! I want the blue one as well!&quot; he found himself saying, exactly as Jackson would. He looked over at his &quot;brother&quot; for the first time in a while, purposely avoiding looking at him throughout his experience. He had a big wide cute little grin plastered on his face with a row of sharklike baby teeth.<br />
<br />
&quot;Damn!&quot; Oliver thought. &quot;He&#39;s so damn YOUNG! And SMALL!&quot; It sucked that his eye-level was even slightly higher than Jackson&#39;s was! That Oliver was now stuck with! It still hadn&#39;t hit him yet that looking at Connor was almost like looking at a mirror. That would come later. <br />
<br />
Little Oliver looked up to see Big Oliver opening his wallet...OLIVER&#39;S wallet! To pay for the ice cream! <br />
<br />
Seeing that black wallet suddenly made Little Oliver&#39;s stomach drop. He hadn&#39;t realized he was emotionally attached to that wallet. He watched Big Oliver pull out his familiar blue and white bank card. Something came over Ollie where he suddenly really felt out-of-place and strongly felt that should be him pulling that card out to feed his little nephew&#39;s ice cream instead! It was beyond odd to see someone else using his body that was his only just this morning, and spending the money he earned just last week. But what was Little Ollie to do? He had Jackson&#39;s small little five year old body that couldn&#39;t even see into the ice cream case without straining to stand on his tip-toes in little athletic shoes that weren&#39;t supposed to be his! <br />
<br />
Oliver started to get mad and frustrated. Everything was so big! He was so damned small, and having to live at this stature, even for just a full day, was frustrating! <br />
<br />
But....oh, Ice cream!....<br />
<br />
The rest of the walk and bus ride back to Oliver&#39;s, was a blur to Little Oliver as he was stuck boyishly enjoying his ice cream with his slightly bigger twin bro. Big Oliver enjoyed the rest of the time he got to spend with his nephews on the way back to his place so his sister could come get them, especially now that he got that one little rascal to stop asking a million questions.</p>
