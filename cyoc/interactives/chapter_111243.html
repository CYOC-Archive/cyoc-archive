<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Louis’s Collected Souls:<br />
Wolf, Orc, Dragon.<br />
<br />
Hawk’s Collected Souls:<br />
Hawk, Rat, Rabbit, (others unknown).<br />
<br />
<br />
Louis opened his mouth to protest, but all it uttered was a deep, rumbling groan of pleasure. He couldn’t pretend to himself that he hadn’t wanted this. Could he not, just this once, let something happen without being afraid?<br />
<br />
Something shifted around his nethers and he felt something wrap around his cock. He looked down to see a thick, green snake coiled around his own thick, green snake. It looked up at him with what Louis thought was humour. Then it gripped his hard cock tightly and flexed its body.<br />
<br />
Louis stumbled with the pleasure, tripping over his boots. He fell moaning into the soft grass. Still massaging his organ, the snake wrapped itself around his waist and caressed his olive skin. Its tail trailed once around his thigh before snaking between his legs and probing at Louis’s posterior. Louis’s eyes widened. Was it about to do what he thought it was?<br />
<br />
It did. Its tail plunged the depths of Louis’s rump. Louis yelped, grasped the snake and pulled it off and out of him. It coiled playfully around his wrist.<br />
<br />
‘We may have to work up to that,’ said Louis.<br />
<br />
The snake looked put out. It’s tail slithered across Louis’s chest and Louis felt its body swell within his grip. It got suddenly heavy, so Louis dropped it. But instead of falling, its body stayed where it was and two legs dropped out instead. A second later, Hawk was hunched over him and Louis’s hand was pressed against his bare chest. He was grinning.<br />
<br />
‘That was not what I was expecting,’ said Louis.<br />
‘You ain’t never done it with a shapeshifter before?’ Hawk grinned.<br />
‘I’ve never done it with anyone before.’<br />
Hawk looked surprised. Then his face softened. ‘To be fair, I ain’t never done it with a human, so I guess we’re even.’<br />
<br />
He leant forward and kissed Louis, his small mouth fitting neatly between Louis’s tusks. It was a sincere kiss, filled with years of longing and loneliness. Louis’s hand drifted downward from Hawk’s chest to his erection, which he squeezed. It almost filled Louis’s orc hand. He rubbed the shaft with his meaty thumb, enjoying the warm feeling of the first cock he’d held that wasn’t his own. <br />
<br />
‘I’ve wanted to do that since I first saw it,’ Louis said.<br />
‘It ain’t no orc cock,’ said Hawk, taking hold of Louis’s own. ‘If you don’t want to take mine, I’m gonna need something else to take yours.’<br />
<br />
He sat upright, looking at Louis with a knowing smile. Then Louis felt Hawk’s cock growing in his hand, though he was already stiff. He watched Hawk’s grinning face rise up and away from him. For a moment, this alarmed him. He had only seen Hawk take the form of small creatures, and didn’t immediately comprehend what was happening. Hawk’s grin pushed outward into a wide snout while his tattoos vanished beneath thick, brown fur. His own ropey hair shook into a long, matted mane that hung over his shoulders and his sparse beard drooped into a thick tuft of fur that covered his chin, down to his chest. A thin tail whipped out from behind him while two pointed, white horns burst out of his head. And all the while he was growing, his muscles swelling and his body enlarging until Louis’s usually large orc frame was dwarfed beneath a massive bulk of hair and heat.<br />
<br />
Hawk the minotaur dragged his tongue across Louis’s face, revenge from him doing the same when he was a dragon. ‘Not so big, now, are you?’ he murmured, with a voice like moving stone.<br />
<br />
Louis said nothing, but ran his hand through Hawk’s furry chest. His other hand was still wrapped around Hawk’s cock, though his fingertips no longer met.<br />
<br />
Hawk sat up and looked down at Louis from his new height, mane billowing in the breeze. He repositioned himself, his two huge hooves clomping down either side of Louis, then lowered himself onto Louis’s groin, using his meaty hand to guide Louis’s cock into his rump. He let out a low grunt as Louis felt the warmth envelop his organ. He sat there for a moment, then used his great strength to lift himself up and down.<br />
<br />
Louis’s back arced. He found his hips thrusting. He grabbed Hawk by the tufts of fur on each ankle. He didn’t know if the deep voiced moans he could he hear were Hawk’s or his own or both of them together. He wanted to touch him, to feel the muscle and hair, to smell the musk of him. He sat up and pushed Hawk down. He hit the earth like a falling log.Then Louis took the lead, thrusting into him while exploring his body with his hands. The great beast writhed in pleasure beneath him. Louis wanted to kiss him, but his head was too far away.<br />
<br />
As Louis thrust, Hawk pumped his own organ with his huge hand. Before long, he grunted, ‘I’m close.’<br />
<br />
Louis sped up. Hawk let out a sound far too high-pitched for a minotaur and erupted. A gallon of sticky, white semen splattered Louis’s chest and Hawk’s fur. A few seconds later, all the creatures in Louis’s mind screeched, roared and howled as he too decorated Hawk’s undercarriage with fluid.<br />
<br />
Louis fell upon Hawk, a warm, sticky pillow. Hawk held the naked orc tightly and licked his bald head.<br />
<br />
‘I’m so glad I found you,’ Hawk said.</p>
