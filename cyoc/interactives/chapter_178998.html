<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The succubus&#39; gaze seems to pin me to the wall.  It feels like she&#39;s gazing into my soul, which... maybe she is.  I stare back, captivated by her golden eyes, letting the tingling sensation of her nearness wash over me.  The steam catches the light from her eyes&#39; soft glow, making them all the more striking.  They&#39;re... beautiful.  This creature, demon or no, is beautiful, and hot, and sexy, and... and what does she want with <i>me?</i>  I mean, I don&#39;t expect to stack up to a sex demon, but I&#39;m not exactly as in shape as I&#39;d like to be.  She could get whoever she wants, so... why me?<br />
<br />
I break her gaze without taking her hand, glancing down at myself and then away, and grimace a little at the comparison.  When I look back up, the demon&#39;s lowered her hand, but she continues to search my eyes.  She&#39;s silent for a moment, then says, softly, &quot;Mmm, I know that look.  But, oh yes, we&#39;re both in the right place.&quot;  She takes a final step towards me and leans down so we&#39;re eye to eye.  In a husky whisper, she says, &quot;Let me show you <i>just how</i> right.&quot;<br />
<br />
Slowly, she closes the gap between us and gives me a gentile kiss.  As soon as her lips touch mine, the tingling I&#39;ve been feeling blooms into a hum of pleasure, spreading out from the point of contact until my entire body glows with it.  Somehow it&#39;s both exhilarating and relaxing at once, a slow burn of desire.<br />
<br />
Straightening, she puts her palms flat against my chest and begins to rub and squeeze and massage.  Energy seems to pour from her graceful hands and into my chest, and I gape in wonder as it loses fat, hardens, then begins <i>pushing out.</i>  When she&#39;s done, I have a jutting set of pecs, slabs of muscle with a cleft between them.<br />
<br />
Pulling her hands back, she brings her clawed fingers to my nipples, brushing and pinching and rubbing, switching between hard claws and soft fingertips.  Each touch seems to increase my sensitivity, making me more vulnerable to her further contact, but her movements are made with patience, designed to increase my pleasure without making my need spike up.  She switches to making slow, deliberate circles around each areola, and they grow slightly to fit her fingers.<br />
<br />
As she works, I decide to give some of what I&#39;m getting, reaching out for her chest to beginning my own brushing and pinching and circling.  She raises an eyebrow, surprised but not displeased.  I try to mimic the movements of her deft, experienced hands and earn a soft &quot;Mmm...&quot; for my efforts.  She slows, showing every detail of every gesture against my new pecs, giving me a clear example to work from, and I try to master the movements.  Her efforts are turning me <i>way</i> on, but without increasing my urgency.  I&#39;m rock hard, but I feel like I could keep going like this for hours.<br />
<br />
After a time she pulls her hands back and smiles at me, resting her palms on the base of my neck.  &quot;I knew I&#39;d like you.&quot;  She works her energy into me, moving her hands along my broadening shoulders, corded muscle growing beneath her touch.  I lightly grip her breasts, doing some gentile massaging of my own while I rub my palms over her nipples.  She lets out another soft moan as her hands reach my delts, giving a little extra attention to rounding out my shoulders.  Then she reaches down to take my hands and says, &quot;I need these.&quot;<br />
<br />
She puts my palms together and clasps her hands around mine, squeezing a little as my hands grow within her grip.  Then she draws them apart again and starts working her way up my forearms.  As she moves to my triceps, I return one hand to caressing her breast and use the other to slowly run my fingers up her abs, tracing their contours or feeling the hard muscle beneath.  Her eyes close and I earn another sound of pleasure.  I can feel her breathing quickening through her abs, which turns me on even more.  I keep caressing her, switching hands to work on her other breast, as her hands come around to squeeze my rounding biceps—just a little more roughly than before.<br />
<br />
She opens her eyes as her hands reach my shoulders again, and her gaze is intense.  &quot;You&#39;ve got me all worked up.&quot;  The hunger in her voice sends a thrill through me.  I let my hands drop as she moves closer and leans in to lick the ridge of my ear.  &quot;Well...&quot; she whispers.  Her breath in my ear gives me goosebumps.  &quot;Turnabout is fair play.&quot;<br />
<br />
With that, she presses her curved, sensual body into mine and kisses me deeply.  Desire seeps into me everywhere our skin touches, and between the kiss and the press of her, I feel like I&#39;m buzzing all over.  Her tits are crushed against my chest and my dick is pinned to her abs, but she&#39;s holding me too tightly for either of us to make adjustments.  Her fingers rove over back, touching me in ways and places I never thought would feel good, as my lats and traps harden and my waist narrows.  Her new urgency makes need boil up within me, but not for release—for <i>her</i>.  To touch more of her skin, to press into her, to feel more of this buzzing pleasure.  I abandon myself to it, hungrily exploring every sensual contour of her back.  I can barely stop kissing her for long enough to breathe.  She reaches down to grab my ass and I reach for hers, then moan into her mouth as she kneads and caresses my cheeks into a perfect bubble butt, round and firm with muscle.  <br />
<br />
Finally, she breaks the kiss and we try to catch our breath.  She licks my other ear and says, &quot;Now we&#39;re even.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That was amazing.&quot;, I say, and take a moment to look at myself.  Even the places she hasn&#39;t focused on yet are looking more fit and trim.  I&#39;m still buzzing with pleasure all over and I&#39;m still rock hard, but somehow I <i>still</i> don&#39;t feel like I need release <i>right now.</i>  &quot;How have I not cum yet?&quot;<br />
<br />
The succubus smirks.  &quot;What kind of succubus would I be if I didn&#39;t test your endurance?&quot;  She leans down to slowly lick across a nipple, then crouches to work on my legs.  Her hands run down one, then back up and down the other, back and forth.  She massages the muscle of my quads, thighs, and calves, rubbing the length of each leg all the way to my growing feet.<br />
<br />
Looking down, I have a good chance to check out her horns.  They&#39;re as black as her hair and about as shiny, curving up and back.  In a dark room or with the right hair hairstyle, you could probably miss them—though I guess she could probably hide them if she can change her appearance.  Small ridges run across each horn.  Curious, I reach out and run my finger along one from base to point—pulling a full-bodied moan from the succubus, who leans into my touch.  &quot;Wasn&#39;t expecting that.  Huge erogenous zone for a sex demon, horns.&quot;  <i>Perfect.</i>  I set to work, running my hands up and back along one horn or the other or both, sometimes using the back of my nails to change the feel.<br />
<br />
She finishes with my legs and feet, but stays crouched.  After a few seconds it dawns on me that she&#39;s just enjoying the trail of my fingers.  When I realize that what I&#39;m doing feels good enough for this <i>succubus,</i> this master of pleasure, to bring everything else to a stop and just enjoy it, I&#39;m filled with a deep sense of satisfaction.  As I make contact for the next stroke, that satisfaction surges up and floods through my fingertips.  I can feel it pouring into the demon, but it never seems to diminish.  A moment later it&#39;s over, and the succubus lets out a contented sigh.<br />
<br />
As she stands up, she says, &quot;Oh, I <i>like</i> you.&quot;  Before I can ask, she explains.  &quot;We feed on pleasure, but not all pleasure has to do with sex.  Your happiness with <i>my</i> happiness was a fine meal all on its own.  Still, though...&quot; she smiles and makes a show of looking me up and down.  &quot;I intend to finish what I started.&quot;<br />
<br />
She reaches out and starts dancing her hands over my midsection, tracing and pressing and massaging my abs and obliques.  As ridges of muscle form under her clawed fingertips, I reach out a hand to stroke along her entrance while she works.  I side my hand down and back, earning satisfied noises from my succubus.<br />
<br />
I smile to myself.  <i>My succubus</i>.<br />
<br />
As she starts tracing out ridges from my hips down to my dick around my now-washboard abs, I slip a finger insider her.  Slowly, I circle and tease her clit, pulling moans from the beauty before me.<br />
<br />
Finished with my midsection, she steps back slightly and takes in my new form, smiling at her handiwork.  I realize that we&#39;re now at eye level with each other—she must have added some height amidst the other adjustments.  Moving back in, she leans to my ear and whispers, &quot;I saved the best for last.&quot;  Her tongue runs over my earlobe before she kisses her way down my neck, across my collar bone, and down my pec before finally taking a nipple into her mouth.  As she licks and nips and grazes the one, her hand comes up to brush and circle and tease the other, pinning me to the wall again.  At the same time, her other hand takes hold of my sac and begins to kneed and caress my balls.  I moan under her assault.  When her energy flows into my sack a moment later, I arch into her.<br />
<br />
She takes her time, growing my balls slowly, drawing out my ecstasy. I can feel myself fill more and more of her hand with every squeeze, every gentile tug.  She moves her mouth to the other nipple and switches hands, continuing to fondle and caress until my nuts are a full, heavy handful.  Then she brings both hands to my chest and couches down, using her mouth to check her work.  She switches between licking and sucking my sack and taking each ball into her mouth, as if she wants to be sure she got the size just right.  I never knew how good it could feel.<br />
<br />
After she&#39;s finally satisfied, she licks her way up and down my cock, sometimes swirling her tongue around my head or licking from sack to tip.  When she slides her mouth around me, she moves to hold me by the hips.  A moment later, I find out why.  Her energy rushes into my cock, and I stagger under the crash of pleasure it brings, bracing myself against the wall behind me.  With each bob and suck, I can feel myself get more and more engorged, gaining length and girth until I fill her mouth.  She doesn&#39;t seem to mind.<br />
<br />
When she&#39;s done growing me, she and pulls off and goes back to licking my shaft, giving me a moment to get my feet back under me.  I check out my new dick, and it&#39;s huge, long with girth to match.  She envelops me again, humming around me, using her tongue like magic.  Her hands, no longer needing to hold me up, roam every part of my body she can reach—abs, pecs, balls, nipples, butt, legs.  It feels like she&#39;s touching me everywhere at once.<br />
<br />
I moan and writhe in ecstasy under her ministrations.  I can feel myself getting closer and closer to the edge, but just when I think I&#39;m going to go over, she changes something about her technique.  Rather than letting me cool down, though, this somehow pushes me to new heights of pleasure without actually making me blow my load.  Again and again she shatters my threshold, switching her focus to a new place or changing how she&#39;s touching me just when I&#39;m about to hit the point of no return.  It&#39;s not long before she has me so full of pleasure and desire and <i>need</i> that I can&#39;t even form words anymore.<br />
<br />
Finally, after what feels like hours, she launches me over the edge.  As she feels me tense, she hugs her arms around me, holding me up while pulling me in to the hilt.  The orgasm that crashes through me is unlike anything I&#39;ve felt in my life, as if all those almost-orgasms are happening one after another.  I <i>explode</i> into my demon&#39;s mouth.  It seems to go on and on, pulse after pulse, second after second.  She moans as she&#39;s rocked by her own orgasm and drinks my seed like its the sweetest nectar.  Just when I think it&#39;s ending, the energy from my release surges forward and floods through my dick into the demon, pushing me over the edge <i>again</i>.  When I finally, finally come down, I&#39;m expecting to feel completely spent, but somehow I&#39;m energized.  Sweaty and panting, but ready for more.<br />
<br />
My succubus stands, wiping off her own aftermath.  &quot;Mmm, what a fine meal.  And I&#39;m not talking about <i>this</i>&quot;—she gestures to my dick—&quot;though,&quot; she smirks, &quot;that, too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Now...&quot;  she puts an arm around over my shoulder add steps around me, pressing herself into my back.  Her body is warm and inviting, but doesn&#39;t start me tingling this time.  I relax into her, enjoying the feel of her pressing into me.  &quot;How about that cuddling?  Unless...&quot; her hand snakes down to gently tease my nipple, &quot;you&#39;d rather more sex?  After all, I told you I was all yours tonight, and the night is young...&quot;</p>
