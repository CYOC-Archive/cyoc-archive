<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As much as Rachel was satisfied with her enhanced body, she just couldn&#39;t let go of the thought of growing even bigger... just to be sure, of course. Moments before she was able to press the buckle, she heard her mother arrive upstairs.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m back Rachel. Everyone made it out alive!&quot; Her mother exclaimed as she wondered she she could be. She had a bad feeling as soon as she saw the open basement door.<br />
<br />
Rachel knew her mom was going to be here soon, so she immediately pressed the buckle again in order to be powered up again before she stood in front of her. The belt glowed purple and gave Rachel all the more power, just like she wanted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Rachel, I know you&#39;re down there. Show yourself before-&quot; Veronica had just turned the corner and interrupted herself as she saw how much Rachel had changed. She quickly noticed the cause of this, the corrupting belt.<br />
<br />
&quot;Stop right there, Rachel! Give me the belt, you don&#39;t know what evil power it holds!&quot; She closed the gap between her and her 7 feet tall daughter sporting more muscle than any villain she had ever faced yet and curves to make any man gasp at sight. She forcefully held onto the belt. Just as she wanted to pull it off of Rachel, she was flung backwards with great speed.<br />
<br />
&quot;No! Let go!&quot;<br />
<br />
Rachel had instinctively slapped Veronica with the back of her right hand. With her earthshaking strength, she caused her to crash into the wall and leave an imprint of her body in the ground in a straight line for half a mile. Normally, Rachel would&#39;ve felt sorry the moment she&#39;d raised her hand against her mother, but instead she was taken aback by the power she possesed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow...&quot; She said as she inspected her still lithe and smooth hand which had just smashed her mother into the wall.<br />
<br />
While she was distracted, Veronica had prepared for a counterattack. She flew through the hole right towards Rachel, wanting to take her along to trap her somehow. But instead of that, Veronica collided head-first with Rachel&#39;s impossibly dense, unflexed abs. All of her momentum was stopped in an instant and she fell to the ground. She has just knocked herself out while fighting her beginner superheroine daughter. But who needed experience if you possesed unmatched strength like Rachel who, thanks to her latest enhancement, was 20 times stronger than her mother, and it showed.<br />
<br />
A couple seconds later, Veronica got up. Her head was hurting like never before in her supercharged life. She looked Rachel in the eyes, trying to prove her point.<br />
<br />
&quot;Rachel, dear, please take off that belt. It is corrupting you without you noticing it. There was a reason why I locked it up to keep it safe from anyone.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But I&#39;m not anyone. I can handle this power, can&#39;t you see? And don&#39;t try to lie to me about it being evil, you won&#39;t get this off of me with such a poor story.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But Rachel, I&#39;m telling the truth. Why else would I be hiding it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know, in case you&#39;d get weaker some day? Maybe because you feared to be overpowered?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Rachel, I-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t want to hear it. You&#39;ve said it yourself, you&#39;re having worries about me being in danger. But, thanks to this belt, you won&#39;t have to have these thoughts anymore. I can protect myself, and others. And if somehow I&#39;m not powerful enough for the job, I can just do this!&quot; Rachel tried to reason as she pressed the buckle once more.<br />
<br />
Immediately, she shot up to 7&#39;2&quot; in height. Her boobs grew a few cup sizes while her ass jutted outwards. Her incredibly dense abs densened further, widening the gap between her and Veronica&#39;s strength that much more. Her arms and legs erupted with muscles. She was now about 40 times as strong as her mother.<br />
<br />
Her already very tall mother had to look way up now to look her daughter in the eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;See? Even you had problems beating me just now.&quot; Rachel managed to say that a lot nicer than it was, Veronica was completely knocked out by an unflexed muscle group while their wielder was distracted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Stop pressing that button, or-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Or else what? Are you going to take this belt away from me? We saw how far you came with that idea. Why can&#39;t you just let me be and trust me? OR could it be that you don&#39;t want anyone to be better than you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s not about being better, it&#39;s abou-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If it&#39;s not about being better, why does it bother you then? Let. me. BE!&quot;<br />
<br />
As she screamed she stomped on the ground with her left foot, causing a mighty earthquake in a huge radius around them. This also caused the ceiling crumble a bit. A little piece of metal was falling down, hitting...<br />
<br />
...the buckle.<br />
<br />
But unlike before, it had changed color again. Instead of purple, it now glowed bright red, indicating a new level of empowerment. Instantly, Rachel&#39;s height shot up to 7&#39;5&quot; as her back widened some more. Her giant boobs reached the size of beach balls while her ass stuck out over a feet from her hips, which were incredibly wide as well. Her titanic thighs and calves reached new levels of massiveness as her biceps reached the size of grapefruits. Meanwhile, her strength increased so much that she was now 100 times stronger than her superheroine mother.<br />
<br />
It honestly felt weird for Rachel, but not unpleasantly so. Since her muscles were this dense, it felt more like she was moving literal mountains of mass as opposed to her actual body. The power flowing with her was so intoxicating that she just couldn&#39;t get enough of it. Meanwhile, Veronica saw her chances of getting the belt off of her power-drunk daughter diminish. She was already hopelessly underpowered compared to her when she tried to attack her. And worst of all, that happened before the last two enhancements. Veronica could only guess just how impossibly strong she was now.</p>
