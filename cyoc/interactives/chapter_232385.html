<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Nathan readied himself. He wasn&#39;t sure of the etiquette expected of him, and so he leaned to one side, looking at his phone. A flicker of rememberence directed him to that furry app, that he probably should hide a few iof those preferences, but navigating a phone with paws was hard. He barely got to open up a browser before the workers arrived, sliding through the door in unison. <br />
<br />
She was massive. <br />
<br />
There were two there, both female, both furries, but one clearly dwarfed the other. She was a hyena, all hips and curves and breasts, held in a medical uniform a size smaller than it should. She was at least six feet tall, probably more, and atop her head stood two small, stubby horns too, poking through her deep brown fur, her tail also like that of a cow. Standing there, she said nothing, the room so cramped her cleavage was thrust into Nathan&#39;s face.<br />
<br />
Jake stirred, sighing as he realised what his friend was looking at. <br />
<br />
“Afternoon.” The hyena said, accent tinged with Britishness. Even Jake could feel her smile, hidden behind her medical mask, but a moment later it soured. She was just staring at him, as if expecting something.<br />
<br />
“Oh shit, sorry!” Nathan chuckled. His eyes scanned to room, scanned the myriad instructions, before finally spotting what he needed. In a lot of them the furry was doing T-pose, facing away from the door. In a snap, he flipped around, assuming the position.<br />
<br />
Getting to work, the two women assaulted his fur with a kind of roller-brush, awkwardly combing against the grain. the smaller one barely affected him, but the larger nearly pushed him over with sheer force. Then the Hyena pulled him around, and the two assaulted his belly with the scrubbber, taking instructions from her companion.<br />
<br />
“Well you don&#39;t need a trim.” The Hyena said, fingering the fur. “I&#39;m guessing you had one, what, last night? Why are you here?”<br />
<br />
Good question, Nathan thought.<br />
<br />
“Honestly, I just want to go in the other tent and relax.” Eyes searched the instructions looking for more evidence, but now things were getting difficult. She was close, so close her breasts were grazing up against him. But, thankfully, the smaller one piped up at last, offering a lifeline.<br />
<br />
“But you are new to this mutt stuff,” she chuckled, “and have no idea what is going on?”<br />
<br />
He looked at the smaller one, now searching through her. Was that normal? Was that something they had dealt with? Was he about to be chased again? The mouse lady on the bus made it seem normal, but mayube she was strange? The smaller woman, a cat, with jet black fur and piercing yellow eyes, offered nothing.<br />
<br />
Well, it was going to come out sooner or later.<br />
<br />
“Literally less than twenty-four hours.” Nathan blushed.<br />
<br />
The Hyena smiled again, clasping his shoulder, the contact stirring his libido. “Feel better getting that off your chest?” Nathan nodded, Jake pressing against the modesty garb. “For the record you don&#39;t exactly hide it well. That, and your funny cock.”<br />
<br />
Jake practically jumped from the sheath, while Nathan&#39;s heart nearly fell from his chest.<br />
<br />
“Relax. I make a living turning people into furries. Groomer is my day job. Nothing I haven&#39;t seen before.” Nathan, heart pounding, moved his hand to his modesty covering. &quot;Doesn&#39;t mean I want to see it!<br />
<br />
“Look, you are a nice lad, and I can tell you mean well, but you really did zero research before transforming yourself. My clients typically have to prove that they aren&#39;t phobes before I even mildly change them.”<br />
<br />
“Sweetheart…” The cat interjected.<br />
<br />
“Look, I know, but if we don&#39;t educate…”<br />
<br />
“He might not want it.” She looked him over, eyes lingering on a now-sheathed Jake. “Plus our advice is geared for women. Our community is geared for…”<br />
<br />
“I&#39;m not inviting him in!” The hyena snapped. “Just, advice.”<br />
<br />
The conversation was interrupted by a ding, and the two girls pawed through a screen, before returning with a smile. “You are clean.” The cat said. “Go sit in the smokehouse for twenty minutes.” She paused, foot tapping his shoes. “Clothed.”<br />
<br />
The two left, bickering, leaving him alone. An unhappy Jake, still very much awake, slid deeper into his sheath, mind racing with shame of a new and strange flavour. Nathan thumbed his cheek, but even this did nothing. As he got dressed, Jake finally emerged, just before he had covered by trousers, proffering a meek “Sorry.”<br />
<br />
--<br />
<br />
The smoke house was fuller than he left it, the chatter rising, the furries filtering in. The snake lady shot Nathan a look, before sliding a coffee his direction, which Nathan took with a smile. Nathan then moved to strike up a conversation, but then another customer pulled her away. Sipping his coffee, Nathan leaned on the bar, before something caught his eye.<br />
<br />
The hyena was there, sitting on a table in the middle, coffee of her own in hand. Without her hair net and mask she looked clearly in her mid thirties, her pristine lab coat now open, revealing the outfit beneath. It was frilly; a keyhole dress with a gothic flourish. Her long hair, dyed purple, was darkening at the roots.<br />
<br />
She smiled, patting the spot beside her, inviting him in.</p>
