<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;It&#39;s actually a genetic condition.&quot; Guy explained as William rested his head on his middle. As expected, the lynx did have some nice muscles hiding under that fluffy coat, he also had a bit of a gut that made for a very fluffy and soft pillow that William was very much enjoying at the moment. &quot;It&#39;s got some big fancy name. Basically my internal clock is stuck, I don&#39;t blow my coat in spring like most others, I have to deal with the winter fluff year round.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Can&#39;t you just trim it down?&quot; William asked, not that he wanted the feline to do so.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, but it&#39;s expensive and takes forever. Can&#39;t just clip me like a sheep, it damages the undercoat, so it has to be brushed out and done by hand with scissors. I&#39;ll do it if I&#39;m taking a trip somewhere really warm, but I&#39;d rather just wear less clothing and drink a lot of ice water while sprawled in front of the AC.&quot; They were both naked at the moment, laying on Guy&#39;s bed. It was a tight fit but they were making it work. Dorm beds were not made to sleep two. Well, except William still had his knit cap on, he rarely took that off.<br />
<br />
William was examining his feet which had change from the knee down earlier today and gave him a good clue as to what he was becoming. The tail helped, this confirmed it. The split hooves with their spurs behind, the reddish bristly fur. For a moment he wondered about he guy he had talked to on the fountain. Boars, both of them. Maybe he should find him again. Milo wasn&#39;t it?<br />
<br />
He felt a tug on his hat and reached up to tug it back down, giving Guy a little bit of a look. &quot;Why can&#39;t I see? I can see all the rest of you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s embarrassing.&quot; William said softly, sitting up and rubbing a hand along Guy&#39;s furry chest.<br />
<br />
&quot;Soon, it will change, but I want to know as much of you as I can. Who you are and who you&#39;re becoming.&quot; Guy scooted so he was sitting up as well, and William let his hand fall to the feline&#39;s thigh. He reached his hand up further, letting it come to a stop on his sheath. Guy put his paw like hand over William&#39;s. &quot;You&#39;re trying to distract me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Is it working?&quot; William asked with a sly smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, but... please?&quot; The paw left his hand and ran down his cheek. Two days and this sensitive wonderful cat already owned him. It was shocking how quickly William had found himself falling for him. But listening to him play that cello of his after they spent a whole dinner nerding out over fantasy novels? Well, it was pretty much a done deal. William had learned he didn&#39;t have enough time to take things slow.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine, but you have to play for me.&quot; Guy&#39;s eyes flicked to the clock on his nightstand. &quot;Tomorrow, before quiet hours.&quot; Guy nodded his agreement and reached out to pull off William&#39;s hat.<br />
<br />
William squeezed his eyes shut. He knew Guy wouldn&#39;t be mean, at least he thought he wouldn&#39;t until he heard the cat give off a slight laugh. At first he felt his heart fall to the pit of his stomach, then realized it wasn&#39;t a mocking laugh.<br />
<br />
&quot;William. I think you need to take your hat off more.&quot; And then he felt a gentle tug on his scalp. Like..<br />
<br />
His hands shot up to his head and his eyes flew open. Hair. There was hair. No.. it was a bit too coarse. He reached over for his phone and opened the camera, flipping it to face him and stared at his face in the screen. On top of his head, short but sticking out at wild angles was the same red-brown bristles growing on his legs. How had he not felt that?<br />
<br />
He ran his fingers through it and smiled, then smiled at Guy who was beaming back at him. &quot;Well, guess I need to shave you bald to see.&quot; The lynx said with a smile, grunting as William lightly swatted him in the stomach. He touched his ears which were also fuzzy along the back and starting to come to points, their tips having been hidden under the hat as well.<br />
<br />
He turned to one side and then the other, stopping as he saw a void in the fur. A line that ran along the side of his head. He touched it gingerly. &quot;Are you remembering something?&quot; Guy urged softly. Having been on campus last year, he had shared what he saw the humans go through with William.<br />
<br />
&quot;Surgery. It still happened. During Freshman year, the year off. I can still remember it but, they got it out.&quot; He touched the scar reverently. He was glad his struggle hadn&#39;t been erased, it had come to define him these last couple of years, but, there was suddenly a burden lifted off his shoulders.<br />
<br />
Guy reached out his own fingers to touch the side of his head, then cupped William&#39;s cheek. &quot;How are you feeling?&quot;<br />
<br />
For answer William pulled himself up onto Guy&#39;s lap, leaning forward and kissing him as thoroughly as he had ever kissed anyone in his life. He could feel the feline stirring underneath him and that was exactly what he wanted. He didn&#39;t want to cry tears of joy, or relief, or even to celebrate. He just wanted to feel alive again, and his lynx seemed only too happy too oblige.<br />
<br />
As soon as he felt Guy entering him for the second time that evening he knew this was going to be a great year.</p>
