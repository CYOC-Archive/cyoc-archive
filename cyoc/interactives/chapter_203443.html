<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I  sat here next to Lance, humming excitedly, it has been two hours since I managed to trick Daved and my boyfriend maybe ex-boyfriend now Tyler who I didn&#39;t need a trick to enter the room where their bodies are being swapped, but maybe Daved who is going to be the new Tyler will feel as attracted to me having Tyler body the same way Tiyler did, but  I don’t really remember how all of this works, but I will try and seduce Daved once he is the new Tyler, because for one I would still like to be with Tyler and Daved could just be the new Tyler and  for two it will be funny if he does not feel anything for me and I will force him to like me knowing he will properly runaway when I try and kiss him with the passion I normal kiss Tyler, and talking about the new Tyler. <br />
<br />
Here his body wearing a hospital gown just walking out of the door looking very confused and frightened, looking down at his olive colour, smooth, small hands, I looked at his body knowing now that my brother is in side it, and I feel happy that I still feel the love I have for Tyler even now with him being the new Tyler, and found myself jumping of the chair and running up to my small boyfriend seeing his confused face looking at me, but before he could say a word I wrapped my arms around him and went in to kiss him, surprisingly feeling him kissing me back, what turned in to a snog, and I could not believe it, my brother who is now Tyler must have  Tylers feeling for me, feeling his hands moving down toward my ass and felt him start squeezing it and I did the same. <br />
<br />
After 5 minuets or us playing around with each other and I feeling so surprisingly happy that my new Tyler wants to be my boyfriend, and stopped kissing him, with him panting still looking shocked and asked “what was that, and what is with my voice, it sounds Spanish, and why am I so small and...and why do I feel so happy that you are here and close to me?” all I could do was shoos him and wrapped my small hands in his what he returned still looking a little worried, I walked him to a big mirror on the wall showing him the new him, seeing his mouth drop open and say “what happed” and then looked at me and said “You tricked me, what did you do and who am I?”. <br />
<br />
I just smiled seeing my boyfriend&#39;s body acting frantic, knowing that is working and put my hands on his shoulders knowing that calmed down old Tyler and said “shhh, babe clam down, yes I did trick you, but you did steal my body  9 years ago and left me as a 4 year old, and I know you felt bad about it, so think of this as your punishment, and it is not really a bad punishment isn&#39;t it, you get to be my loving boyfriend now, and that is who you are for now on, your my Tyler Lopez, who is 12 years old, from Spane, and looks so cute and hot” looking down at his body and back up seeing the new Tyler blush at me calling him cute and hot, and he even smiled for a second at it. <br />
<br />
 gees this is going to be easier than I thought it&#39;s going to be, he seemed quite content being Tyler, I thought he was going to go mental, with me taking his life away from him, and sulk for months, but he is just standing there looking much less scared now but still confused, so I pecked him on the cheek and wrapped my arm around his shoulder and lightly grabbed his ass, treating him just like I would treat Tyler normally, and said quietly into his eye “and you know there is no going back to that body for years, so you might as well be happy that you are inside a body what is hot, Spanish and rich with your parents making a lot of money in a bank, pulse you got a great boyfriend now” with me leaning over and started to snog with him again not feeling him trying to break out of it, only doing it for 10s this time  <br />
<br />
After braking the kiss ,Tyler looked at me and took a deep breath and smiled at me and said” well I guess if there is no way back to my body, and this body does feel great with this amazing voice, what I am liking more and more every second, and I do feel so good being close to you now, wanting to be with you all the time, but I can’t understand why the old Tyler would give up this body and loving feeling for you?” with him wrapped his arm around my shoulder and grabbing my ass, mirroring what I have been doing to him for the last 4 miniates and I sighed and said “well you see, you.... old you could not stand people saying horrible things to you, with it not just being one thing, with him being ok with gay comments being thrown at him, but it was the racist on top of the gay ones what got to him and he also hated how we were the only ones in middle school who was gay, and all the attention it got us, and he could not take it anymore and wanted to break up with me to make it easier for us, so Luckly this was the day you came to take us for are check up and  when we decided to do what you wanted I managed to plan my trick, and here we are, just remember if things start to get too much for you I am always here for you, and will never let you get hurt” and moved closer and kissed him again he was just smiling at me now and said in a much happier voice ”I don’t know if it is just this body but god, I lovie this, and nothing can make this too much, especially now I feel this way for you” with him resting his head on mine and feeling are noses touch what felt so nice. <br />
<br />
I was looking at Tylers beautiful face and in the corner of my eyes I say my older brothers body coming from the door and said quietly “and talking about you old body” turning him around resting him in my arm, pointing him towards his old body and my older brother, what looked shocked but happy looking at his white skin and seeing Lance standing up and herd him say “HI, There” awkwardly and loud enough to just hear him from the other side of the room and seeing my “new” brother say something back it was too quiet for us to hear, seeing it made Lance laugh and then out of nowhere they began to kiss each other deeply while whispering things into each other&#39;s ears making each other giggle, it looked very cute seeing my brothers body and Lance looking so happy, and looked back to Tyler seeing him still having a happy face, taking  his free hand with his over one finding its way around my shoulder and on my ass, and said to him “let get out of here and give these two some privacy” Tyler just nodded to that and I started to lead him to the door and shouted “David, I will call mom to pick me up, so you don’t need to worry about giving me a ride” looking at them seeing Lance nod his head at me while kissing Daved, and I left and we were outside, and I kissed my boyfriend knowing this is all going to work out...</p>
