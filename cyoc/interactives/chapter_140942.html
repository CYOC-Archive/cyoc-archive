<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">With the holiday season approaching, various companies were putting out more advertisements to get people interested in their products. And Animalia&#39;s models were quickly becoming a hot commodity to advertise products as they were such attention-grabbers. A good example is Venus, the uplifted Sphynx cat. Her uplifting may have been recent, but Goldbond has already made a lot of her to advertise their latest lotions and creams. The hairless cat was quite a natural at posing for effect, but then cats are known for making themselves known to people when it suits them.<br />
<br />
Venus&#39;s current success and what would be expected with her for bikini season were so great that Goldbond decided to branch out and get a hairless dog spokesmodel to work with Venus. An ideal choice would be a Xoloitzcuitli (pronounced show-low-its-quintley) or Mexican Hairless Dog. The Xolo is an ancient breed, originally bred by the Aztecs who believed it was both a healer and a spirit guide. The breed had nearly gone extinct when it fell out of favor, but artists Frida Kahlo and Diego Rivera had included the dogs in their paintings which kept them from dying out. Mexico had made the Xolo the national dog as part of the indigenous cultural revival and recent films have made Xolos well-known and popular with the public. Now was a good time to cash in on the popularity, as soon as a suitable dog was found for uplifting.<br />
<br />
After much searching, they&#39;ve found their dog. Xochitl, or Xochi often, was a miniature Xolo that was completely bald with brown eyes and her skin was a very dark grey, nearly black. She had been a showdog for several years and was getting to be put out to pasture. Being a Xolo, she didn&#39;t win &#39;Best in Show&#39; in contests that featured other dog breeds. Still, she had won &#39;Best in Breed&#39; several times. But as Xochi was getting older, it looked like her showcasing days had come to an end. Until Goldmund approached her owner, Rodriguez, to see if they could use as an Animalian spokesmodel. Not wanting to see Xochi die of old age and wanting to see her get a revamped career, Rodriguez quickly said &#39;yes&#39;.<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
Xolos are known to be sensitive dogs and Xochi was no exception. As such, Rodriguez had to go Horizon Labs with Xochi for her uplifting. Considering the typical appearance of the Mexican Hairless Dog, it was a bit hard to tell if they were in old age or not. But Xochi did seem slower than younger dogs and she was missing many of her teeth. Though with Mexican Hairless Dogs, they do not have strong genetics for teeth and may become toothless in old age.<br />
<br />
&quot;This treatment will make her young again, right?&quot; asked Rodriguez.<br />
<br />
&quot;A second dose will restore her to her prime,&quot; said Judy, &quot;She&#39;ll get her teeth back as well. Maybe stronger than before. The Animalian virus has a way of patching up deficiencies in animals.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Should I be with her?&quot; asked Rodriguez.<br />
<br />
&quot;Perhaps not,&quot; said Judy, remembering what happened with Venus, &quot;She&#39;s hairless so she&#39;s going to be completely naked when she turns. And newly-changed Animalians tend to be very aroused, particularly double-dosed changes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I see,&quot; said Rodriguez, blushing a little. That would be more than a little awkward for him.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ll let you see her as soon as she&#39;s ready,&quot; said Judy, before walking him out of the changing room. Xochi whined a bit, not wanting to be along with a stranger, especially a strange rabbit woman. &quot;Don&#39;t worry, you&#39;ll be fine,&quot; said Judy. She got a bottle of unpasteurized milk from the fridge and poured half of it into a dish. Xochi will need to drink the rest of it separately to get her second dose. The Xolo might not be comfortable with strangers, but she wouldn&#39;t deny a drink if it was offered. Xochi lapped up the milk, her missing teeth not keeping it from not leaking out her mouth.<br />
<br />
As Judy has seen with many other animals, Xochi stopped drinking when the virus started taking effect. Judy has seen plenty of dogs change before, watching their front legs become arms, their back legs become long enough to support the rest of them, and their torsos adjusting to human shape. But Xochi&#39;s lack of hair allowed her to see the changes in muscles and bones a little more directly. It was...a bit unsettling actually. It was fascinating, but the clicks and squishes of bones and organs realigning along with it being faintly seen under the surface of her skin was unnerving.<br />
<br />
When the changes were finished, Judy help Xochi stand. For a dog that was on the older of middle age, Xochi wasn&#39;t in too bad shape. Perhaps a little paunchy and her breasts were sagging, but not very decrepit at all. &quot;How are you feeling?&quot; asked Judy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not bad,&quot; said Xochi, her voice having a Latina lilt, &quot;Kinda sore though.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, that&#39;s fairly normal for a dog your age,&quot; said Judy, &quot;But I have something to help with that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You mean that stuff to make me young again?&quot; asked Xochi.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, right, you were there listening,&quot; said Judy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just because I didn&#39;t understand it then doesn&#39;t mean I don&#39;t remember it,&quot; said Xochi, &quot;So how fast does that second dose act?&quot;<br />
<br />
Judy handed her the remaining milk and said, &quot;Not long at all. And it&#39;ll feel better than your first dose.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Here&#39;s hoping,&quot; said Xochi before downing the milk. As soon as she did, she could feel the changes starting. She stood up a little taller as the ache went out of her back. The paunch on her belly shrank away as the rest of her wrinkles smoothed out. Her muscles tingled as they started expanding, becoming more defined under her skin. Her breasts were becoming perking again and filling out more. Xochi groped them and let out a little moan. The only discomfort was her new teeth growing in, but she felt her teeth and gums getting stronger.<br />
<br />
When the changes stopped, Xochi walked over to the mirror to get a better look at herself. Like with other female dog Animalians, her body was now toned and curved in a very pleasing combination. And with no hair, every detail of her enhanced muscles could be seen. Xochi posed in the mirror, putting her hands behind her head and thrusting out her chest. She grinned, showing her new pearly-whites. &quot;<i>Muy actractiva,</i>&quot; she said proudly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you want to see Rodriguez now or you want to have some time to yourself first?&quot; asked Judy.<br />
<br />
&quot;A little time for myself, <i>por favor</i>,&quot; said Xochi as she massaged her breasts.<br />
<br />
&quot;I thought you would feel that way,&quot; said Judy as she headed for the door, &quot;I told Rodriguez to wait.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;<i>Gracias,</i>&quot; said Xochi as she started fingering her vagina.<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
After her adjustment classes, Xochi did show to have pretty good talent for modeling. Though given she was a show dog before, it wasn&#39;t that much of a surprise. Xochi got along pretty well with Venus as the two of them had a few things in common. Namely a shared hatred of winter and coldness.<br />
<br />
Xochi&#39;s hairless dark skin made her a very appealing spokes model for Goldbond. Considering Xolos had acne problems, she was also ideal for promoting their anti-acne products. Not long after she started modeling, people have commented that Xochi looked a lot like Anubis, or the modern gender-bent versions of him that were so popular these days. Those comments sparked an interest in Xochi for Egyptian culture. While not the same as Aztec culture, there were some similarities. Eventually, Xochi decided she wanted to visit New Zerzura to see Egypt for herself. And as soon as Venus learned her coworker was heading to a place that was warm and sunny, and cats were revered to boot, she booked herself a trip to New Zerzura too.</p>
