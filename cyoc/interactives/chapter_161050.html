<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Thinking about it now as she went backstage is where she was soon gone for the deal she offered did intrigued you that yoou thought of listening to what kind of deal she had for you, but you still have a match coming up soon with the kangaroo. So, no deal with her at the time as you go get ready for your final round and prepare yourself by heading over to the training gym, unaware that the kangaroo was already there and pumping up with training also. As you approached to see the wrestling roo training aggressively by the punching bag that you could tell he was made at something while overhearing why from the distance of the Shadows.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t believe this! After all that we been through together, you both end up losing to this... this nobody!?!? The three of us all promised that we would all stay here as her anthro wrestlers, till it was time for us to leave the island together. I know that if he should lose this match up, he&#39;ll be turned into an anthro wrestler, one of us. Still, this is my last match that itll be all or nothing for me at this point. I&#39;ll be able to finally leave this island freely, but I don&#39;t want to end up being sold somewhere to box while being completely change into my new feral form. If only I could find someone that&#39;s willing to help, but who?&quot; He sais as he was now almost into tears while finding out his fate of being someone&#39;s pet boxing roo, should he lose that is.<br />
<br />
Stepping out of the shadows and into the training room that he shortly after rubbed it off and quickly went off to train. Finding an empty spot next to him that you soon started to train with him. That&#39;s when you made your move as to what you&#39;re about to say while thinking about what you heard earlier from him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t talk, just keep trying with me.&quot; You said as he didn&#39;t even make eye contact with you when the girl from before sees you training with the anthromorphic kangaroo and shortly left, without saying a word. Now it was clear what you are going to say to him as this maybe your only chance to tell him what&#39;s on you&#39;re mind, and thought about making the stack higher for his last match here.<br />
<br />
&quot;Listen, I don&#39;t blame you for hating me on taking your two friends out of here with out you, but they were good wrestlers as one of them mentioned me to start my very own wrestling league start up back home. They even wanted it out of me, so I told them that they could by joining my team. If you&#39;d wantto, i could have you be put into it with your friends as you&#39;d be my third member of my team. ...I also over heard that this is your last fight here as your fate might end up someone&#39;s pet boxing kangaroo, should you lose this match.&quot; You said while not making eye contact and focusing on your training as the roo-man did the same.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then you know why I can&#39;t afford to lose this fight. I&#39;m no one&#39;s pet! However, you also know why I want to join you wrestling league start up team back home. My friends are there as theyll start without me there.&quot;he said while pumping up some iron that it made yours to shame as you were working out with him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, technically they can&#39;t start without me there as I&#39;m somehow there wrestling league leader. If you did want to join that one, you&#39;ll not going to be turned into your feral form as you&#39;ll be as you look like now. Two, you&#39;ll be treated well and some pet, unless you want to. So even if you somehow get sold to me, you&#39;ll basically be antro with your other friends there as i&#39;ll be like your new father to you.&quot; You mentioned while lifting more weights then him.<br />
<br />
&quot;But what if you lose? You&#39;ll be turned into an anthro wrestler, and be forced to be stuck here for who knows how long she wants you for. Again that should you lose this as things are now, Are you sure you&#39;re ok with what will happen to you?&quot; He asked while sounding concerned on your safety now that you simply showed him this by giving a military like nod.<br />
<br />
&quot;Haw-Hee-Haw!!&quot; That&#39;s when you both heard the man who turned donky as you turn your gaze to him, even he was looking at this ass of a mule.<br />
<br />
&quot;Looks like he&#39;s still in there, even if he&#39;s now just a donkey to the human eyes. Still, a donkey no less.&quot; he said as you couldn&#39;t believe that he was understanding him, like he hasn&#39;t even been turned into an animal.<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you going to do to him?&quot; You asked as he swiftly got off of his training and up over to the donkey. You didn&#39;t get a response from him till he was next to him as he then whispered something into his ear for it was, &quot;wish me luck in my last fight.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Its not what I&#39;m going to do with him, is what you you&#39;re going to do with him. You see, the deal was for his lose in the ring was that who ever he sees first who&#39;s human after he fully charged into (caugh to clarify something) an ass is where this person will change his fate forever. Since he now sees you, you now have to change his fate for the better, or for the worst. The choice is yours, what do you want his punishment now to be?&quot; He said that you soon had a thought of some use to him and told him what his punishment shall be.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, there is one thing that I&#39;ve thought of, but it&#39;s entirely up to him. Do you accept this punishment that I&#39;m about to receive for you, down from the bottom of your soul?&quot; You said this donkey that with a few nods, he was ready to accept his fate to be.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, here go. For your punishment that you&#39;ll forget you were ever human to begin with, for now as you&#39;ll only remember what I&#39;m about to tell you. Not only you like to crossdress in a girly fashion getup, but you&#39;re also one of my anthro wrestlers. my third wrestling league start up fighters back at my home who loves a practical joke now a days. (If you see the tv show M.A.S.H. mobile Army Surgical Hospital, then think of the two amy surgents as one is hawkeye pierce.) Hmmmm. You know, that donkey dosen&#39;t fit you, when a stripped hyena will. Your family will know what happened to you as you like your new life style that your former memories of them caseually returns back to you each day, but not from pleasure island here. Even though you&#39;re now my third that my other two wrestlers will train you to be a better fighter. ...when I snap my fingures together, you&#39;ll vanish from sight and reapear at my home where you&#39;ll see the gator - man at work and the bear - man helping him. I also want you to help out as your things will pop up shortly after you arive.&quot; You told him as he was braying at you like crazy.<br />
<br />
&quot;(You can&#39;t be serious!? You can&#39;t do this to me! Change me back right now! Haw-Haw-Hee-Haw!? Hee-haw-Haw-Hee-Haw-Hee! Haw-Hee-Haw-Hee-Haw!&quot; Even though you didn&#39;t understand what he was saying that the kangaroo wrestler had to help translate for you, unaware he was already changing into his useful form of a anthro stripped hyena wrestler.<br />
<br />
With a quick snap of your fingers that he was soon goon as he reapeared at your house. He saw two beast men of a bear and a gator working on a building of sorts as he could remember why though. All he remembers right now though was that he was you third wrestling league start up with them as he soon enough, helped them build.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe I&#39;m better off fighting with you, then against you. You still got my back if I loose, right?&quot; He said that before you had a chance to answer his question, the snake man entered as he was slithering around looking for you both.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah! there you guys are. Hey! you two got to get your butts in gear and head back to the ring, like right now! You guys a on in 5 minutes.&quot; He said while panting out of breath, before slithering off again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, time to get moving. You coming?&quot; You said to him that the wrestler before you was ready as he&#39;ll ever be shape in.<br />
<br />
&quot;Y, yah. Sorry about earlier.&quot;he said, hoping to get this match done and over with as you reached up to his shoulder.<br />
<br />
&quot;don&#39;t worry about it man. and as for your question, I got your back. hope you got the same thing for mine, when it comes.&quot; You said that with a quick nod, you both shock each other&#39;s hands as you left the gym and entered the ring for the greatest fight of your life.</p>
