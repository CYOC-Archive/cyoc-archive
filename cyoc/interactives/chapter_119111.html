<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">While dinner was still only an hour or so away; Benton wanted to get out of the room his daughter and her friends were in. Whether it be for fear of saying something regrettable or doing something equally just as foolish. Listening to Eric describe his first day as a senior when he and Frieda are the same age; she two grades below him. Listening to Eric detail his encounter with Jeff Wilson, a teacher Benton once had the pleasure of suffering through himself and his encounter with the current generation’s school bullies; it brought back some memories he thought he had buried.<br />
<br />
Leaving the dining room as the teenagers go back to admiring the three Doberman puppies Amanda brought home; Benton makes a beeline to his study. Once his father’s before Benton did extensive remodeling to suit his taste; the were-panther sighs as he pulls out his cell phone and dials a number.<br />
“Frances,” Benton sounding exasperated; “I know this is unexpected, but is it possible to move up my standard Friday appointment sooner?”<br />
“I suppose,” Frances answering somewhat confused; “did something happen?”<br />
“Some old memories came up,” Benton sitting down in a nearby chair; “memories I thought were long gone.”<br />
“And they are causing you some emotional distress,” Frances sounding concerned; “care to elaborate?”<br />
“Over the phone,” Benton groaning; “I’d rather it be in person. Too many ears over here if you know what I mean.”<br />
“I suppose I can have Rudy pencil you in tomorrow around ten,” Frances answering; “but you might need to wait a bit after. Tachibana has scheduled to send some security personnel to come by and sweep the office. After being revealed that a patient directed by Jack Crawford to plant surveillance devices in my office, I’m not taking any chances.”<br />
“Would you object to having the session here at my estate then,” Benton asking; “or do you frown on house calls?”<br />
“It’s unorthodox,” Frances answering; “but it’s something I’ve done before. Perhaps your wife could join in. I’d like to get some insight from her,” Frances speaking; “would she be available?”<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll talk to her about that,&quot; Benton answers.<br />
<br />
******<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Amanda rejoined the trio who were giving the new puppies a reason to wag their tails; plenty of love. Breeding Dobermans, training them, and entering them into showing completions; was a hobby Amanda stopped doing shortly after marrying Benton. Now with a chance to get back into the game, despite recent events; Amanda was raring to go with the training.<br />
“Ethel will have supper ready in an hour,” Amanda coughing to get Frieda, Eric and Spencer’s attention; “I suggest you three clean up then and get to any homework you might have.”<br />
“We don’t have any homework,” Frieda answering; “all today was at school was orientation and a rundown of the years curriculum.”<br />
“Then get cleaned up,” Amanda removing the puppy from her daughter; “give George a chance to set the table.”<br />
“Can I name the puppies,” Frieda watching her mother collect the dogs from her friends.<br />
“Later,” Amanda answering; “but no silly or crude names. Don’t think,” Amanda looking at Spencer and Eric; “that I don’t know how foul your language has become.”<br />
<br />
The three look on as Amanda leaves the dining room and they turn to look at each other.<br />
“If anything,” Spencer answering sheepishly; “it’s me that is the bad influence in that area.”<br />
“I don’t know what you’re talking about,” Eric sniggering as he gets up; “shall we go upstairs or take a walk around?”<br />
“Upstairs,” Frieda smiling; “despite dad being in a no-fun for you three mood, there is something I was hoping you would enjoy discovering during lunch today.”<br />
“Being placed into advance classes,” Spencer rolling her eyes; “killed that fun.”<br />
“Oh,” Eric following the two girls upstairs; his curiosity piqued as he was lead into Frieda’s room.<br />
<br />
Seeing Spencer close the door after he entered; Eric watched as Frieda smiling and giggling, approached Eric and took his hands and placed them on her hips. Encouraging him the rub them up and down; Eric was confused at first; but then he had an oh snap moment as he understood what Frieda was hinting at.<br />
“You not wearing any,” Eric was trying to speak before feeling Spencer dive her hands down his pants; stopping him from speaking as she massages his already swelling member.<br />
“For the entire day,” Frieda grinning as she lets her yellow dress fall just as she started shifting into her were-panthress fursona.<br />
<br />
For a brief moment before her skin was covered in fur; Eric glimpsed Frieda’s bare breasts and vivid red pubic hair concealing her sex. The grey fur with russet highlights covering her assets; yet her pert breasts swelled upon her shifting into her fursona. Frieda clearly aroused as she felt Eric’s still human hands explore her; her nipples started to peek through the fur originally covering them from view. With her tail swaying and a pleasing purr emanating from her throat; it wasn’t long before Eric was also assuming his white furred were-panther fursona, followed by Spencer in her black furred werewolf/panther/feline hybrid form.<br />
<br />
The three unable to hold themselves back as they stumble to Frieda’s bed and running their paws all over each other’s fur. Their bodies clearly displaying their intent to enjoy each other in a deep and intimate fashion.<br />
<br />
******<br />
<br />
All throughout the Benton household, everyone could hear the three upstairs in the midst of their passion. Ethel smiling as she opened up the oven to check on the status of pork tenderloin. George displaying his trademark British stiff upper lip as he set the table, while the were-cheetah maids giggled as they were busy dusting the entertainment room.<br />
<br />
Benton meanwhile, shook his head as he sat in his study after taking his medication. Having to take a Xanax that Frances told him to take when he felt anxious and stressed out; the were-panther was about to get up from his seat when Amanda entered into the room.<br />
“Let it go,” Amanda looking at her husband; “let the three have their fun.”<br />
“But the puppies you took in,” Benton sighing; “won’t they be spooked?”<br />
“And you think our rutting won’t do that later,” Amanda chuckling; “especially if they are sleeping in the master bedroom?”<br />
“You are not having those dogs in our room,” Benton staring at his wife; “that I will not have.”<br />
“They can’t be alone,” Amanda answering; “and it’s not as if they will be sleeping on the bed with us.”<br />
“But they are going to watch us,” Benton shuddering at the thought; “going at it.”<br />
“Now who is the prude,” Amanda laughing; “don’t tell me you are nervous over a potential audience. You never had that problem during the few times you had a little too much to drink,” Amada shaking her head; “at the various pride gatherings.”<br />
<br />
Benton looked like he swallowed tack as he realized Amanda was right. About to say something; Benton was unable to form words as he and Amanda heard Frieda’s loud yowl of orgasmic joy, followed by Spencer’s.<br />
“I don’t know how Eric does it,” Benton shaking his head; the Xanax starting to kick in as he starts to calm down; “pleasuring two girls at the exact same time.”<br />
“You want to ask that during dinner,” Amanda knowing the answer.<br />
“God no,” Benton shuddering; “it’s bad enough the house is soon going to reek of their love making. I don’t want to have my appetite put off as they describe what they do together.”<br />
“Then as I said earlier Benton,” Amanda smiling; “let it go.”<br />
<br />
*******<br />
<br />
Back up in Frieda’s room; Eric purred as he enjoyed still inside Frieda, his feline member still twitching as his seed kept spurting in her. With the surprises and stress that came with the day; Eric felt refreshed after engaging in a spirited romp with both Frieda and Spencer.<br />
“Feeling better,” Spencer being the first to speak; despite still enjoying the afterglow of their shared orgasm.<br />
“Oh yeah,” Eric purring; his green eyes flashing as he still hugged Frieda intently. With Eric mounted on top of her, Frieda and Spencer were in a sixty nine position. “You think we have time for another round?”<br />
“I wouldn’t push our luck,” Frieda mumbling; “supper is almost ready and I’m sure dad will be miffed at us for having fun.”<br />
“Well it’s not as if we can do it outside in the woods,” Spencer adding; “what with the were-alert still on and all these news people running around, reporting on Frederick Parker.”<br />
“Your home is out Spencer,” Eric speaking; “with you mother having her son and still on maternity leave. Our noise making would keep them both up.”<br />
“And we can’t keep using your basement,” Frieda grumbling; “sound proof it maybe, I’m sure your parents want to enjoy it’s amenities know and then.”<br />
“Don’t forget Nate and Jean,” Eric getting up; pulling his still erect member out of Frieda’s slick canal, the spines digging into her folds giving her another gasp of pleasure.<br />
“Maybe we could get in more fun later,” Spencer sighing; being helped up as Frieda started climbing off of her; “if not, there is always skype.”</p>
