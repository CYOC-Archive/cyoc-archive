<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">(Sorry this is late, was celebrating Easter Sunday.) <br />
<br />
Randy and Zelda Niemand struggled in the giant wolf monster's arm. Behind it they saw an <br />
even larger and blacker than night furred wolf next to a relatively smaller reddish brown <br />
female wolf monster. They were wolves, but they walked like men. <br />
<br />
&quot;Dad, you owe mom ten bucks, she was right, the game is very real.&quot; Charcoal black <br />
monster said in a calm voice, still holding their necks tight. <br />
<br />
There was video game noises in the background that suddenly stopped, and suddenly a <br />
small horde of wolf monsters the size and shape of children came running into their view. <br />
<br />
&quot;Who are they?&quot; The lone blacker than night one said in a little girl's voice sounding <br />
annoyed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are they gonna be new brother and sister?&quot; The smaller male asked excited. <br />
<br />
&quot;I don't think precisely dear.&quot; The adult she-wolf said. <br />
<br />
'It's good to see you again Mr. and Mrs. Niemand.&quot; The larger red-brown wolf boy said in <br />
a polite and calm tone, &quot;We've really been upgrading the house the last few week so <br />
pardon the mess.&quot; The wolf boy then broke out into giggles. <br />
<br />
The Niemands had had enough of this. Zelda and Randy both used the pressure points on <br />
the charcoal wolf monster's wrists causing the paws to open involuntarily and land on the <br />
floor. In less than a second Randy had done a thrust kick to it's right knee cap, causing <br />
him to fall foreword with a cry of pain. <br />
<br />
&quot;ZACKERY!&quot; They heard two women's voice cry out in dismay and alarm. The Niemands <br />
turned to run out of the house but found a dark brown she wolf creature that looked aside <br />
from coloring much the said as the reddish brown one locking their path. Randy charged <br />
shoulder first at the she wolf not stopping as she grabbed him easily but the force of the <br />
impact actually pushed the diamond shaped door handle into her back causing her to cry <br />
out in pain and surprise. <br />
<br />
That was when two heavy weight landed hard on top of them. Zelda saw pearl colored on <br />
top of her and maternal material pressing into her back as Randy felt a gray and silver <br />
mess on top of him. They used their sheer weight to keep them down on top of their <br />
pressure on top of the back of their knees and elbows. <br />
<br />
&quot;DON'T YOU EVER DO THAT AGAIN!&quot; The pearl one snarled. <br />
<br />
&quot;YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO HURT ZACKERY UNDERSTAND?&quot; The gray and silver one hissed. <br />
<br />
Beatrice on the balcony just silently looked on as Maxine, Robyn and Millie all gasped as <br />
the reaction by their two pack mates in defense of the one who had earned Nicole's scorn <br />
before. <br />
<br />
&quot;They made up fast.&quot; Maxine commented. <br />
<br />
Zack was sitting with hands on his damaged knee, resisting the urge to cry out in pain <br />
more. <br />
<br />
Kaylee looked at her mate, &quot;At least it wasn't you this time dear.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; Jensen then said sounding regretful, &quot;Instead it was another member of my pack <br />
instead.&quot; <br />
<br />
Kaylee looked at Jensen oddly but but said nothing more. <br />
<br />
Jensen said, &quot;Hope, Grace, help Pearl and June. Move them around so they can see their <br />
child in the pack.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;This brings back memories.&quot; Mr. P said behind the pups.<br />
<br />
Marcy and Kevin felt a return of shame and brother and sister clasped hands together. <br />
<br />
Randy spoke first, &quot;WHO ARE YOU! What are you! Where is our daughter! Where are the <br />
Smiths!&quot; <br />
<br />
As they turned the Niemands around Zelda managed to kick Pearl in the stomach while <br />
Randy bite Grace's paw. <br />
<br />
&quot;YOU LITTLE-!&quot; Grace raised her claws, intending to rip his face off. <br />
<br />
&quot;DON'T.&quot; Jensen said. <br />
<br />
Grace's claws instantly harmlessly went slack at her sides. <br />
<br />
&quot;We're going to need Julie after this.&quot; Kaylee spoke the obvious. <br />
<br />
Everyone silently agreed. <br />
<br />
&quot;We should have given her MAGIC healing powers.&quot; Zack gasped.<br />
<br />
Mr. P said, &quot;The less we rely on mumbo jumbo the better! My grand kids are not getting <br />
put back together wrong because someone said 'abra-kazo' when they meant 'abra-<br />
wazo.'&quot; <br />
<br />
Randy looked at the creature that was as big as the blacker than night wolf but went on <br />
four legs. Or was it a tiny bit bigger? Randy couldn't tell at this angle, and he had more <br />
important things to think about.<br />
<br />
&quot;WHERE IS ZYLPHIA! DAMMIT!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;WHERE IS MY DAUGHTER!&quot; Zelda echoed. <br />
<br />
&quot;I'm right here mom, dad, thought daughter doesn't fit anymore, not that son will soon <br />
enough either.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;ENOUGH WITH THE BS!!!&quot; <br />
<br />
Zackery said, &quot;Always arrive when you mean to, not early or late. Jennifer is a shallow <br />
selfish spoiled brat who needs a conscience. If you say you're going to do something do it, <br />
don't threaten to do it. The disney magic died with Walt Disney.&quot; <br />
<br />
Randy stared, &quot;So you grilled some information out of my daughter! So what! So who are <br />
you, ALIENS!&quot; <br />
<br />
the wolves all looked at each other, and ALL groaned. Almost. <br />
<br />
Anne said from her spot on the balcony, &quot;Thinking about it are people in another star <br />
system developing faster than light travel and managing to find a random little blue dot in <br />
the universe really that strange in comparison to a magic game where people are mind <br />
controlled or changed?&quot; <br />
<br />
Terri and Sandi next to her other looked at each other, having no answer. <br />
<br />
&quot;Look,&quot; The black as night big one said, &quot;I'm Jennifer Smith or used to be. This here is <br />
Kaylee who used to be Kyle Perkins, you don't know her, him. Those over there are our <br />
pups Jenny, Bart, Kevin and Marcy who used to be our parents. The gold and black wolf is <br />
my great-grandfather. Everyone else present are our estate's work hands who weren't <br />
turned into our shadow puppets or living statue guardian or deer for food. We also have a <br />
couple police and their wife who are also now part of our family. We have a couple living <br />
glass wolf pups who are touring the world right now and will be back by dinner time if <br />
they won't want their father upset with them. Who is me. Zack, continue I'm out of breath.&quot;<br />
<br />
Zack gasped, &quot;Yes Master.&quot; In pain but continuing, it was nothing compared to the knee in <br />
the groin he had gotten from Nicole. &quot;Dad, mom, it really is me. That helping holding you <br />
down is Grace and Hope, and that's Isabelle that you hurt trying to get out. Me and mom <br />
were right the game of Glendale IS very real dad, sorry you lose that one. On the plus side <br />
this lends credence to all the OTHER occult stuff we thought was baloney but you thought <br />
was real back when you were a teenager but 'grew out of it.'  Jennifer ended up <br />
transformed into the Big Bad Wolf as spite by a geek we amused ourselves with who <br />
thought he was smarter than he was, and she transformed him to get back at him. Then <br />
the police came and they transformed them too. And finally they transformed everyone at <br />
the manner. We were invited over the weekend and were given a four star welcome, which <br />
you would have gotten too if you had shown up later today, sorry, and were transformed, <br />
and since the pack's base ratio is 'four girls to one boy' for this generation, I needed to <br />
become a male. It's actually rather empowering. Oh and the ones holding you down are <br />
my two mates June and Pearl.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;... you're insane...&quot; Randy gasped out.<br />
<br />
&quot;It was just a game...&quot; Zelda lamented. <br />
<br />
&quot;A game we're learning we can't really trust. So you two are going to be given some extra <br />
gifts to assure our future after we take care of people who want our pack to disperse.&quot;  <br />
<br />
Kaylee thought, &quot;Thinking about it, what can Madam Serenity do to us anymore? We're <br />
locked into our wolf forms, what do we have to fear from her?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jensen said, &quot;Everything, because she KNOWS! And knowledge if the ultimate weapon.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Bout' time you finally learned that...&quot; Randy said matter of fact in spite of himself. <br />
<br />
Zack laid down on his rear, being careful of his tail, giving them an unwanted view of his <br />
sheath.  &quot;Look, mom, dad, didn't mean for things to get this crazy, you were supposed to <br />
just peacefully forget about me like... ah, I suppose you don't even KNOW who Hope, <br />
Grace, and Isabelle ARE then don't you? They're friends of mine and Master. Always were. <br />
You'll remember then in a minute about. Transform or Dare?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;DARE!&quot; &quot;DARE!&quot; <br />
<br />
The predictable response followed. <br />
<br />
As did the reasonable re-respond. &quot;This isn't a game! IT'S A CHEAT!&quot;  Randy snarled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alice would fully agree with you.&quot; Jensen said simply. <br />
<br />
However that was all Randy managed to get out before the Dare forced his mouth to work <br />
for him, miming except with sound the words &quot;Transform or Dare?&quot; Along with Zelda. <br />
<br />
&quot;Dare.&quot; Zack said bored with this part.<br />
<br />
&quot;We dare you to ask us Transform or Dare.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Transform or Dare?&quot;<br />
<br />
They heard their own mouths say in total protest of what their brains wanted, <br />
&quot;Transform.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Very good.&quot; Zackery said, &quot;Now we begin. Zackery took in a LONG BREATH!  &quot;Your <br />
genders shall switch and become pups of the Big Bad Wolf Pack, loving and unbreakably <br />
loyal to your pack and Alphas. You shall become as I've described. You shall be child <br />
prodigy keeping your adult IQ scores and knowledge. The memories others have of you <br />
will fade out of context once you've done the legal paper work for me to home school and <br />
for us to enter legal limbo. They will come into context only if you contact them.  Anyone <br />
either of you touch who is not subservient to the pack and/or not a part of it and either of <br />
you call a 'Big Bad Wolf' will become as such with their gender changing to maintain our <br />
ratio with same memory cloak as you an absolute loyalty and loving devotion. Anyone in <br />
that same criteria for the first change either of you touch and either of you call a 'Little <br />
Bad Wolf' will change the same way only becoming pups of the pack instead much like yo <br />
are. Finally, anyone you transform and you shall-&quot; He spoke Alice's clause sealing their <br />
fate and anyone they transformed. <br />
<br />
Pearl and June didn't let go. Not as Randy and Zelda began to shrink, not as the fur began <br />
to appear on them, not as ears moved and hands and feet warped into paws and claws. <br />
Pearl and June then began to rip off their clothes as they began to become a little harder to <br />
hold onto as they became small enough to squirm under their grasp.  They were picked up <br />
a dutiful Terri and Sandi to be burned. <br />
<br />
Shoes, shocks, pants, underwear and pants, shirt, blouse, undershirt and blouse... all of it <br />
being torn off by the increasing large she wolves on top of them. They grew larger and <br />
more intimidating, and yet at the same time, why did they also somehow feel more <br />
comforting? Just safe... to have them there. Because they were being held down, they <br />
didn't get to see much of their own or each other's transformation. Jensen was very <br />
disappointed in this, but a bitten leg and a replaced tooth had taught him of caution <br />
before pleasure. <br />
<br />
Zelda felt her breasts vanish, and something pushing out from both her rear and from <br />
inside her vagina as her ovaries moved with it to the outside. Randy just had time enough <br />
to feel a lady's breasts form on his chest before they deflated again, and felt his manhood <br />
inverting on itself as something came out between his legs. <br />
<br />
They soon felt her ears being squashed by the she wolves on top of them, and their bare <br />
skin felt cold against the scratched wooden floors only for a few moment as the fur <br />
covered everything and they felt their musculature rearranging in on itself. <br />
<br />
They struggled more. Now Pearl and June bear hugged them both and sat up holding them <br />
against their breasts, still squirming and now clawing but Pearl and June just grimaced and <br />
shuddered as the claw marks the two put on them NOT letting go for anything. <br />
<br />
&quot;Everything is all right,&quot; Whispered Pearl, &quot;Everything is fine, everything is all right, calm <br />
down, there's nothing wrong, don't worry, I'm right here, nothing bad is going to happen <br />
to you. I promise I'll protect and guide you, I promise. You don't need to struggle, you're <br />
safe, I'm right here.&quot; <br />
<br />
June said a similar mantra, &quot;You don't need to struggle, I'm right here, you're safe and <br />
sound, because I'm right here, nothing bad will happened to you while I'm right here, I <br />
promise everything is going to be all right, stop fighting, you're safe, you're okay, because <br />
I'm here with you.&quot; <br />
<br />
The now clearly big bad wolf pup in June's arms took bite into her shoulder but still she <br />
didn't let go. The pup in Pearl's arms also dug his claws into Pearl's sides but she didn't <br />
get go. <br />
<br />
Zack moved closer to aid but June and Pearl only hugged the pups tighter. Then their <br />
struggling in their mothers' arms slowly lessened, and their eyes slowly widened in <br />
childish wonder and amazement, then, slowly lowered in peaceful acceptance and <br />
peacefully laid against the natural pillows they were being held against. <br />
<br />
They stayed like that for two more minutes with no one saying anything until Pearl and <br />
June finally let them go. They didn't run, they didn't fight, they looked up innocently at the <br />
she wolves they had been biting and claws at before. <br />
<br />
&quot;Say hello... &quot; Pearl said hesitantly, suddenly feeling very excited and strangely very scared <br />
and happy all at the same time.<br />
<br />
A little boy wolf with light pink fur looked up at the pearl colored she wolf, &quot;Mommy Pearl?<br />
&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's right sweetie.&quot; Pearl nodded feeling relieved and satisfied, but the fear and <br />
happiness didn't fade. &quot;Now tell mommy your name please.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm Zelipe mommy.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes... yes you are, you're Zelipe, my Zelipe.&quot; <br />
<br />
June went through a similar ritual as she slowly let go of the little girl she wolf in her arms, <br />
no longer fighting, no no longer resisting. <br />
<br />
&quot;Do you know who I am?&quot; June asked almost hesitantly. <br />
<br />
&quot;You're mommy June.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And who is your father? And your half-brother's father?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Papa Zack.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And who are you? What is your name?&quot; June asked looking in the girl pup's eyes that were <br />
like brown rubies if such a thing could be described like that.   Her fur shinned white as <br />
freshly fallen snow making Lawrence's white look like kitchen floor tiles by comparison. <br />
But also along her body like abstract line tattoos almost were red lines and and curves, <br />
they didn't look like scars or cut, not in the least, they looked more like brush strokes of <br />
anything. Her tail was fluffy and flowing behind her. <br />
<br />
&quot;I'm.... I'm...I... no... my name is... no I'm... I...&quot; Her eyes looked locked in struggle, then, <br />
everything became crystal clarity. She moved with regal repose and moved with near <br />
angelic grace grace and leaned her head against her mother's body, &quot;I'm Ammy, mother.&quot; <br />
She said peacefully and calmly. <br />
<br />
The two new mothers hugged their pups. <br />
<br />
&quot;Blech.&quot; Jenny said getting a swift short smack from her mother in response for her <br />
rudeness. Bart wisely decided NOT to express his similar discuss. <br />
<br />
&quot;She's so pretty...&quot; Marcy said. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, she is pretty...&quot; Kevin parroted both their eyes looked on her. <br />
<br />
Chester was actually bowing at the beautiful she-wolf cub before him. <br />
<br />
Jensen came over to June and Pearl. He saw the balcony was now full of the she wolves <br />
present. &quot;Shadows come!&quot; <br />
<br />
The shadows moved out of the office machine style. <br />
<br />
&quot;We'll introduce you to your governess, the triplets, and Alice and her half-sisters/cousins <br />
later.&quot; Jensen said simply to the two pups.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Sir Alpha.&quot; Ammy bowed. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Mr. Alpha.&quot; Zelipe nodded too. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hold them up.&quot; Jensen ordered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Master.&quot; June and Pearl said together and took the two pups in their arms and raised <br />
them above their heads so all the pack could see them. <br />
<br />
Jensen looked at his pack above him, &quot;THIS! Is Ammy! Daughter of June and Zackery! Now <br />
part of our pack and family! And this is Zelipe! Son of Pearl and Jensen! Also part of our <br />
pack and family! Now forever and always!&quot; <br />
<br />
The entire pack clapped and cheered.  Zelipe blushed from his position above his mother <br />
and Ammy looked kindly at her father ignoring the crowd. <br />
<br />
Jenny felt a wave of jealousy go through her at Ammy's applause. <br />
<br />
++++++++<br />
<br />
Felicity led her child into the house with Serenity and her group dragging behind for a <br />
moment. <br />
<br />
&quot;That man she mentioned, the one who cursed Mary,&quot; Trevor asked Serenity before they <br />
stepped inside, &quot;That was him wasn't it? The man you mentioned before, the one who <br />
turned kids into women and sold them off?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;... &quot; Serenity thought, &quot;It was so long ago, I didn't realize they'd let him out for parole in... <br />
thirty, forty years? I didn't write the date down. I figured he'd have gotten ten thousand <br />
years in prison, but I guess his lawyer used the blind eye to the game the police have in <br />
Glendale to weasel him an early release before he died of old age.&quot;<br />
<br />
Paul growled and he made several sign language symbols, he might as well have been <br />
speaking greek, but then said, &quot;Hazz tuu enn-de.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;That's something we can all agree on Paul.&quot; Serenity said. <br />
<br />
This wasn't some innocent mischievous prank prancing from person to person making life <br />
a bit more interesting and special... this thing fed on spite and pettiness. <br />
<br />
Paul was politely silent when Mary let off an off handed comment about there being no <br />
such thing as demons, his grand-father had been an exorcist but much like Serenity had <br />
with him and his brother, did not want to alienate an ally when their allies were very very <br />
few indeed. <br />
<br />
On the plus side, Mary's story suggested SOMEONE in the Glendale police accepted the <br />
curse as very real and not to be ignored... for all the good it did them if they couldn't <br />
convince the police to help with a couple brave speeches and a few guilt trip over not <br />
doing more to save their fellow cops from a pack of brainwashed wolf people. <br />
<br />
Ahead in the house,  Mary shuddered as she saw the chair set up for an eight year old.  <br />
She saw the photos on the walls, all of them still had her... but now all of them had her <br />
with reddish gold fur and the body of a lion girl. It made her sick to her stomach how <br />
much she looked like a mundane lioness cub in the baby picture. Also, several years of her <br />
life now seemed to be missing... 'Do I still have the same friends? Nobody seems to have <br />
changed except me... and the stuff related to me... Am I still in high school? Am I back in <br />
grade school? Do I have NEW FRIENDS?'  Mary started thinking how it might be if her <br />
'friends' suddenly found her acting like a complete stranger to them... <br />
<br />
Serenity followed into the room, and took note of the lion girl in the family photos. Trevor <br />
looked with wide eyes from his place in her arms. Paul crossed himself at the sight as he <br />
followed behind. <br />
<br />
Once in the living room proper (Mary took note of a very large scratching post that hadn't <br />
been there before) Felicity called to her husband saying they had guests and got the reply <br />
he'd be there in a second. <br />
<br />
&quot;Why don't you go to your room and play for a minute dear, I have some things I need to <br />
discuss with your new friends.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mary started, &quot;But I wanna stay.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Please dear, for mommy?&quot;<br />
<br />
Mary's eyes widened a bit she was being told to shrug off while the adults spoke like a, like <br />
a, ... like a little girl... <br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sure Mary can stay right here.&quot; Serenity suggested. <br />
<br />
Mary's hopes went up. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh I'm sure there are some things you'd like to discuss privately first.&quot; Felicity said in a <br />
slightly more forceful tone. <br />
<br />
 Mary didn't want this to rise and wandered as if in a daze to where her bedroom was, (she <br />
hoped it was still there). <br />
<br />
&quot;I'm very sorry if my daughter caused any trouble to you or your pets Miss Serenity,&quot; <br />
Felicity said sincerely. &quot;She can get excited very easily and wants to poke her nose into <br />
everything. She actually once wandered into the lion's den at a zoo and the zoo keepers <br />
spent two hour convincing the zoo's lioness to let her go. I'm sorry if she dragged you <br />
along threatening to cry if you didn't.&quot; <br />
<br />
Madam Serenity said, &quot;I can assure you I came here of my own free will. Your daughter <br />
seemed eager that she introduce you.&quot;  <br />
<br />
Of course if Serenity had told the truth they would have thought her stark raving mad, and <br />
if Mary had tried to pack them up she would have ended seeing a child psychologist for <br />
the rest of her new childhood.   And if Trevor had tried to explain things they would have <br />
had themselves committed. <br />
<br />
A man who Serenity assumed to be Brian Hardy came into the living room wearing slacks <br />
and light blue collar shirt. &quot;And you are miss?&quot; <br />
<br />
The parents were rather delighted at their daughter making new friends. The fact that <br />
these 'new friends' were a fifty year old woman who had an injured cat and an orangoutang <br />
didn't lead to quite as many odd questions as it should have. <br />
<br />
&quot;So how smart is it?&quot; Brian asked looking at the orange ape. <br />
<br />
&quot;He is a he, and his name is Paul.&quot; Madam Serenity said calmly if slightly forcefully. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh I'm sorry.. I didn't know apes could be tamed this well.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;This one can at least.&quot; Serenity said simply. &quot;But I must discuss with you something of <br />
importance... you see I'm a private investigator and I've been looking into a pair of <br />
vanishing police and his family.&quot; Trevor snuck out of Serenity's grip hopping on his <br />
bandaged right back leg and followed Mary. <br />
<br />
Serenity started as she felt it, 'Damn... the game again, by one of the big mass of changed <br />
yesterday, on two people, then two back on, then on those two same people...' <br />
<br />
&quot;Are you okay?&quot; Brain asked first. <br />
<br />
&quot;Just... a very very very bad feel.&quot; <br />
<br />
++++++++++++<br />
<br />
Mary was in her bedroom, or what was supposed to be her bedroom. <br />
<br />
Family photos, home videos, her finger paint prints from preschool she kept in her bottom <br />
dresser drawer... everything, changed. <br />
<br />
But there hadn't been anything in that monster's 'transform' about reality changing... had <br />
the curse decided on it's -own- to do this somehow? <br />
<br />
There were a lot of stuffed animals.. all her boy band posters were gone replaced by one <br />
of My Little Pony (as had a couple model horses she had had).   Pink and white were her <br />
colors now apparently. 'At least it doesn't look like a faux jungle.' She did note her bed <br />
had been replaced by a very comfy looking hammock.  All her shoes and socks were gone <br />
except for two odd looking pairs of sandals. <br />
<br />
Mary was positively petrified to see if she still had all her math books and novel or not.. <br />
then again, given the subject matter in some of those books might be a too gruesome for <br />
a eight year old...  But what if she was still at her old education level? Wouldn't she be in <br />
danger of every single student who got worse grades than her? What would it do for their <br />
rep if an eight year old got a better test score than them? She'd have to constantly look <br />
over her shoulder! Could her parents accord a bodyguard? She STILL had all her education <br />
in her head right? Right? <br />
<br />
And how would she get any peace at all? She felt her blood turn to ice as she remembered <br />
suddenly the new paper clipping she had seen in the hallway... 'Lion Girl Born.'  Wait! She <br />
did remember seeing it before right? It hadn't just come into being and she NOW <br />
remembered it right?! Right?!  <br />
<br />
&quot;Scared out of your wits aren't you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Said a melancholy yet calm voice. <br />
<br />
Mary turned and saw Trevor sitting on her hammock, no easy feat with that leg. <br />
<br />
&quot;My parents did even question where the pink  overalls came from! I left today wearing a <br />
skirt and blouse!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You left a human too.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mary couldn't think of an argument to that. Mary marched over to where she used to have <br />
a stuffed lion, now it was a stuffed Husky... it even had the same missing ear from that <br />
time it got caught on a coat hanger... 'Not Lance too...' Mary thought thinking of the name <br />
of her stuffed toy and life long friend.  That was it. <br />
<br />
&quot;Why should -I- be the only one who has to be like this-?!&quot;  Mary said sounding scary. <br />
<br />
&quot;Mary?&quot; Trevor said sounding scared. <br />
<br />
&quot;Why shouldn't I just Transform or Dare my parents into lion people too? I can use the <br />
game to make my friends the same age and species too? Then I don't need to be alone <br />
this way right-?!&quot; A look of slight insanity twinkled in Mary's eyes. <br />
<br />
Trevor moved fast causing his bandaged leg to scream in agony and bit her in the leg, it <br />
didn't draw blood through the overalls, but it very much got her attention.  She kicked him <br />
off, he landed into a giant panda stuffed animal. <br />
<br />
Mary nearly roared, &quot;What are you doing you stupid cat-!?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mary! Listen! Don't listen to me, listen to yourself! This is how the curse -works!-  It's not <br />
some second voice in your head that you know isn't yours. You've been screwed over, and <br />
you have the power to make someone else miserable too!  It's how the damn thing -<br />
breeds-! -Think-! You said you wanna be human again as fast as you can, how is warping <br />
reality so your parents and friends are extras from Cats too going to make that easier?&quot; <br />
<br />
Mary started. Mary took the stuffed husky Lance was now and wandered over zombie like <br />
to her hammock and sat down her tail going through the openings. She absentmindedly <br />
stroke the stuffed animal. She hadn't done that in years. <br />
<br />
Trevor looked at her staring ahead into nothing, why did that look seem familiar? <br />
<br />
Trevor through a curve ball, &quot;By the way, could you cut out that fake accent whenever you <br />
talk to me? It's getting on the kooky side.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;?!... Accent what accent?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You know what I mean. You talked to Judas the same way. It's like Felidae <br />
'Victorian English style' with the world's most thick African accent.&quot; <br />
<br />
Mary realized she heard an odd accent to Judas' one when he was speaking to her... With <br />
all the insanity she hadn't even noticed it, but now that Trevor brought up the idea the <br />
realization hit her. <br />
<br />
Mary thought about how Judas spoke to her, she had been too freaked out at the time to <br />
notice, but the way Judas spoke was odd, there was an odd accent to it, like some mix of <br />
thick welsh and new age speak or that was how it sounded to her. <br />
<br />
  'Is this because house cats and lions -don't- speak the same language naturally, or did it <br />
become that way because I thought about how illogical it was?' Mary shivered, the less of <br />
a mind of it's own she thought this curse had the better she felt. <br />
<br />
Mary hugged Lance, knowing at least he always understood her. &quot;I wanna be me again...&quot; <br />
She said sounding like any eight year old girl being forced to see how unfair the world was <br />
before her time.<br />
<br />
Trevor said nothing and just brushed up against her. The stuffed animal didn't seem to <br />
mind the competition. 'Lance has always been understanding like that.' Mary thought. <br />
<br />
The idea of her simply giving the turn to Trevor to make him human (which make or may <br />
not have worked) and him then using the turn to make her human, didn't even enter her <br />
brain. <br />
<br />
It was almost as if something conspired to keep Serenity's companions in shapes immune <br />
to the unfettered transformation powers of the pack's more unique members.</p>
