<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Just like how you&#39;re now building up milk over time, your womb is producing eggs over time, and every once in a while you&#39;ll have to lay a clutch of them to relieve yourself.  When you come in my room tomorrow for me to milk you, you&#39;ll tell me about this new development, asking me for help with it as well.  Just like with your breasts and their milk, you’ll trust anything I say and do regarding your egg laying.  Have you got all that?&quot;  Ally nodded blankly.  &quot;Alright, when I snap my fingers you&#39;ll wake back up and forget everything I just said.&quot; Kyle snapped and Ally blinked.<br />
&quot;Huh?  What were you saying?&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh, nothing.  I’ll see you tomorrow morning.&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh ok, goodnight!  And um, thanks again bro.&quot;  Kyle&#39;s sister reached down and picked her towel back up, wrapping it around herself before stepping back into the hall and walking into her room.<br />
<br />
<br />
“I should probably hypnotize mom with a fail-safe just in case she finds out about all of this.”  Kyle thought.  He grabbed the coin and made his way down to his mother’s office.<br />
<br />
“Oh hi sweetie, is there anything I can help you with?”  The woman asked as Kyle walked in.  Kyle pulled the coin out of his pocket and began to swing it, immediately slipping his mother into a trance.<br />
“If at any point you discover that Ally is lactating or laying eggs, you’ll think it’s unusual but not worrisome or impossible or anything like that.  And if you find out that I’ve been helping her with these things, you’ll think it was sweet of me to help my sister when she was concerned.  You may even offer to start helping her out as well.”  The  woman nodded groggily.  Kyle paused, considering taking further advantage of the situation.  “Also, it’s completely normal for me to touch, squeeze, or in any way play with your breasts, as well as for me to see your bare tits.  When I snap my fingers all  of this will come true and you’ll wake up, but you won’t consciously remember any of it.&quot;  Kyle snapped his fingers.<br />
<br />
“Sorry, um, what did you say you wanted sweetie?&quot;  The woman asked, shaking her head.  Kyle reached out and grabbed the front of his mother’s tit through her clothes, and she chuckled casually in response.  “Oh, I see.”  Grinning, Kyle brought his face in and rubbed them between his  mother’s clothed breasts.  After a few moments he pulled  back, grabbing the neckline on his mother&#39;s top, pulling it down to expose her bra-covered breasts.  &quot;Oh sweetheart, you shouldn&#39;t do that, you’ll stretch out the fabric.”  His Mom chided.  “If you wanted to see my chest you should’ve just asked.”  She grabbed a hold of the bottom of her shirt, lifting it up off of her and tossing it aside, then reaching around her back.  With a soft click her bra fell away, revealing her D cup tits.  Her nipples and areola were as big as you’d expect to see on someone with bigger tits.  “There you are sweetie!”  She said cheerfully.<br />
“Th-thank you.”  Kyle stammered.  He reached out and caressed the side of one of her tits, then reached out for the other and pressed the two together.<br />
<br />
His mother chuckled.  “It’s always so cute watching you play with my breasts like this.”  Kyle brought his face forward again, slowly dragging his tongue around one of his mother’s areola, hearing her give soft groans every now and then.<br />
With a sigh of satisfaction, Kyle pulled himself away from his mother’s playthings.<br />
“Alright, I’m going to sleep.”  He said simply.<br />
“See you tomorrow sweetie.”  Kyle’s mother grinned and turned back to face her work as Kyle returned to his room, grinning just as much.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
There was a light knock on your bedroom door.  Your mother wouldn&#39;t be awake this early, and you’d guess Ally was trying to be discreet.  Kyle stood up and opened his door.  His sister stood there in a pair of sweatpants and socks, and nothing else.  Her swollen, milk filled tits and elongated nipples commanded Kyle&#39;s attention.<br />
<br />
“Good morning,” she said with a nervous grin, “Thanks again for being willing to help me out like this.” She stepped into your room and you shut the door behind her.<br />
<br />
“Good morning.  Um, I know it’s no big deal for me to see your breasts, but maybe you should still wear a shirt around the house in case mom starts asking questions.”<br />
“I know, I know,&quot; Ally assured, &quot;but when I put one on, my nipples were so swollen and stuff that every little movement of my shirt felt like I was rubbing them, I even spilled a bit of milk into the fabric.  My bra didn&#39;t really help either, and I didn&#39;t want to be moaning down the hallway, so I just banked on the fact that mom would still be asleep.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, I see.&quot; Kyle said, struggling to tear his eyes away from his sister&#39;s swollen tits.  &quot;Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;ve heard that girls with sensitive nipples can help keep that from happening if you put a band-aid or a bit of tape over them.&quot;<br />
&quot;Ohh, that&#39;s so clever!&quot; Ally said.  “There’s um, another thing I wanted to talk with you about.  I woke up in the middle of the night and, I um, I laid some eggs.”<br />
“Oh?” You  say, trying to sound surprised but not too surprised.<br />
“Yeah, take a look at these:”  Kyle’s sister took her hands out from behind her back, showing him the three eggs she was holding.  “I know it sounds crazy but it’s true!  I woke up feeling this pressure in my womb and I could feel hard things when I pressed on my abdomen.  And for the next half an hour, every now and then one of these would come out of my pussy.&quot;<br />
<br />
“Don’t worry, I believe you.&quot;  Kyle assured.<br />
&quot;Oh thank goodness.&quot;  Ally said.  &quot;I worried you&#39;d think I was going crazy.&quot;<br />
“I think telling me was the right call.  I should probably take a look to make sure everything&#39;s alright.&quot;<br />
“Okay.  Thanks Kyle.”  Even though she had casually stood naked in his room last night, he was still just as excited and amazed as he watched her slide down her pants and panties, baring her pussy to him.<br />
“I’m going to need to  touch it, is that okay?”<br />
“Of course, I trust you bro.”  You grin at hearing this.  You gently spread open the lips of Ally’s pussy, marveling at the glistening pink walls within.  You spend a few moments admiring it, making it look like you’re carefully examining something about her slit.  You let it slip back closed, bringing your fingers upward and gently pinching her clit.  Ally stifled a sharp gasp, reaching her hand down to yours.<br />
“Ah~ d-do you have to touch there?  That’s r-really sensitive you know.”<br />
“I know, I’m sorry, but I need to be thorough.”  You say.  “Try to put up with it if you can, ok?”<br />
“O-ok.” She replied, lifting her hand away.  You softly press down on the end of it with a single finger, moving it in slow and tiny circles, Ally covering her mouth as she cries out every few seconds.  Starting to worry about waking up your mother, you let go of Ally’s nub and step back, standing back up again.  You give your sister a moment to catch her breath.<br />
<br />
“Alright, well for starters, I really don’t think it’s anything to worry about.”<br />
“Really?”<br />
“Absolutely!  Your pussy looks wonderful- um, as in it looks perfectly healthy, and It’s not like you’re in any pain or anything right?”  Ally shook her head.  “And it looks like you’re able to lay them without any complications.  I’m completely sure it’s not any kind of health risk, despite how unusual it is.”<br />
“Okay, yeah that makes sense.”  Ally said, breathing a sigh of relief.  “But still, first my breasts and now this, what do you think caused it?”<br />
“I don’t know, maybe you had a latent genetic mutation, or it could be a side effect of some medicine clashing with your hormones, but those are just guesses.  When I get the chance I&#39;ll do some research and see what I come up with.”  <br />
“Okay, thank you.” Ally said with a nod.<br />
“Can you tell if you’ve got any more in you now?”<br />
“Um, yeah, I think I&#39;ve still got an egg left in me from earlier.”<br />
“Okay, let me see if I can help you with that.”  Kyle crouched down in front of his sister&#39;s pussy.  Heart racing, he reached up and slowly dragged a few fingers across Ally’s labia.  She gave a staggered breath in response, but didn’t protest in any way.  He pressed in, slipping his fingers between Ally&#39;s pussy lips, feeling the warm wet walls within.  Ally moaned as he began steadily fingering her, going up to three fingers after a minute.<br />
&quot;I-I, ah~ I think it&#39;s working!&quot; She managed to say between hushed moans.  A moment later, Kyle felt something hard and warm descend against his fingertips.  He slid his fingers out of his sister&#39;s pussy, cupping his hand beneath it instead.  Ally covered her groaning mouth as her pussy&#39;s lips spread open, the shell of a white egg becoming more and more visible until it popped out, falling into Kyle&#39;s grasp.<br />
<br />
Ally took deep staggered breaths as she collected herself.  She hadn&#39;t cum from the whole ordeal, but it was clear she had been well on her way to doing so.<br />
&quot;Oh, that was so much easier and felt so much better than when I was laying them by myself.&quot; Ally lamented.  &quot;Um, since you offered to help milk me regularly, would you mind helping me lay my eggs sometimes too?&quot;<br />
&quot;Hmmm, ok, but in return you have to mow the lawn half of the times it&#39;s my turn to do so.&quot;<br />
&quot;Absolutely, it&#39;s a deal!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well that&#39;s taken care of, but your breasts are looking kind of uncomfortable sis.&quot;<br />
&quot;Ugh, they are.&quot; Ally said, reaching up to her chest. &quot;They must not have been all the way full last night, because they definitely are now.  Could you give me a hand again?&quot;<br />
&quot;Of course.&quot; Kyle stood back up and stepped up to Ally, wrapping his lips around his sister&#39;s inch-long teat.  As soon as he started sucking milk began to flow into his mouth, Ally giving a relieved groan in response.  He happily gulped down mouthful after mouthful until her flow slowed to a stop, with Kyle wasting no time in swapping to her other teat.  After another minute or so, it too was drained dry, and Kyle stepped back with a lick of his lips.  Ally&#39;s breasts looked a bit smaller and her nipples looked a little less swollen, Ally moving as if they were lighter and more comfortable too.<br />
&quot;Oh man, they feel a million times better, thanks Kyle!&quot;<br />
&quot;I&#39;m happy to help!&quot;<br />
“Oh, but what do we do with the eggs?&quot;<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;ll figure something out.&quot; Kyle asserted.  &quot;In the meantime you should probably go get ready for the day and I&#39;ll do the same.<br />
&quot;Okay, will do.  And thanks again, I really owe you one for all your help.&quot;  Kyle dismissed it as no big deal as his sister stepped naked out into the hallway.</p>
