<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The arrival of December meant many things, the arrival of winter and the approach of the Christmas season. For many this was something that was always looked forward to, particularly among those that went to school. This was no exception for the students at UNLV, including those at the Pi Eta Tau house. The end of semester finals were a big thing, and everyone there was focused on them, but that didn&#39;t mean that there weren&#39;t those looking forward to the coming break.<br />
<br />
&quot;Counting the days till Christmas break?&quot; Princess asked to Tiffany, knowing full well that Tiffany was looking forward to seeing Riley again, &quot;Is it to see mom and dad... or Riley?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Both,&quot; Tiffany answered, though a small smirk couldn&#39;t help but escape her muzzle, &quot;but mostly Riley. Mom and dad have given some good gifts over the years... but sometimes...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Their Christmas parties can be a bit stuffy,&quot; Princess nodded in agreement, &quot;particularly when some of dad&#39;s business partners come out to Lyre to partake in the party...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then followed by mom getting frisky with dad,&quot; Tiffany answered, &quot;that&#39;s one good reason to go see Riley.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you sure that&#39;s not just YOU wanting to be frisky?&quot; Princess teased.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe, maybe not,&quot; Tiffany gave a shrug.<br />
<br />
&quot;It could be easier if we stayed focused on our present business,&quot; Sylvia commented from the chair in which she was sitting, with her tail coiled in a way that some of it was resting on the padded cushion while the rest was gripped around the back of the chair.<br />
<br />
There were a few small nods as the others that were in the leading roles in the PET fraternity/sorority at UNLV. The business wasn&#39;t super big, and was mostly just scheduling and making the arrangements for what would be done with regard to cleaning while they were away and what would be expected. With the budget balanced and things arranged, that didn&#39;t seem too hard to put together as they sat around what was normally the main dinning table for those in the house. They&#39;d already agreed those base rules and when the house would close for Christmas/Winter break and when it would open again. There really wasn&#39;t too much more than that.<br />
<br />
&quot;Says the girl who intends to spend Christmas in Egypt,&quot; Tiffany gave a chuckle.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;ll be warmer there than it is in Lyre,&quot; Sylvia answered, &quot;meaning less time moving between the saunas and home.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can understand wanting to be comfortable,&quot; said Theseus as he sat beside Maddie, &quot;many of the chairs and tables here weren&#39;t exactly built for Animalians MY size... but I&#39;m not sure that the constant travelling will be something that you can just keep doing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Maddie agreed, &quot;once you get your law degree... if you open up your own practice, you may have to stay on a rather routine basis. As law courts won&#39;t just adjust their schedules because you&#39;d prefer warmer climates. And if you join a pre-existing practice, they likely won&#39;t just pick up the slack for you. This may mean you may just have to put up with winter, no matter how much you may dislike it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll deal with THAT once it&#39;s an issue,&quot; Sylvia answered, &quot;Right now it isn&#39;t. So... I will enjoy some warmth when I can get it. And don&#39;t worry, I&#39;ll only be there until classes resume and we all have to come back for our respective classes. So I&#39;m not exactly skipping out on anything.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re just making sure,&quot; Maddie told her calmly.<br />
<br />
Sylvia gave a small and dismissive nod at this. A part of her own planning had also figured to ultimately settle further south in areas that would be warmer. It might mean taking the bar exam again for those states, but it would also mean starting her practice in an area that would be more comfortable for her, and the law school she was at seemed to take its Christmas/Winter Break at the same time UNLV did, so it wasn&#39;t like she was just skipping out on things for comfort. And at the same time, it wasn&#39;t as though she really had that much &quot;family&quot; support anyway. Her parents had originally paid for her conversion, with the intent that she become something with legs and resume ice dancing, which she&#39;d never wanted to do in the first place. Once they learned she became a rattlesnake, they&#39;d pretty much cut her lose. Some summer work as a part time secretary had helped her out, but aside from that the most she really got from her parents was what they&#39;d long agreed to pay with regard to her college expenses. She hadn&#39;t even gotten a birthday gift from them after her conversion. So, it wasn&#39;t really like Tiffany and Princess who could return home to loving parents... unless the converted Corgi took Princess to wherever his family lived for Christmas, or like Maddie and Theseus who had their own family and the cooperation from the herd of uplifted cattle from the Brown farm. Sylvia was for the most part on her own.<br />
<br />
&quot;We are getting a bit distracted,&quot; Princess commented as things began to quiet down, &quot;Especially when we really have one last piece of business to attend to.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Right... what is to be allowed to stay over Christmas break,&quot; Tiffany nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t think they&#39;ll require furniture to be removed,&quot; Theseus commented, &quot;at least not personal furniture.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tiffany nodded and looked down to a sheet that sat before her at the table. Everyone there had a copy of the sheet. The house was fully furnished and had its own individual amenities that would go beyond the standard dorm rooms on campus. There were also some basic pieces that would allow those in the house to work on homework projects in the house, along with the plug ins for things like computers and phones, should residents have brought them, but the college had only allowed for the basic coverage. Those that came in could bring in their own pieces for their tastes to help with things as well.<br />
<br />
&quot;According to their sheet, the custodial staff will be fine with leaving personal furniture here over winter break,&quot; Tiffany commented as she took the handout in one hand, &quot;everyone will just have to remember that electronics that are left need to be unplugged, and this includes any and all mini-fridges. The main refrigerator in the kitchen can stay plugged in. The big thing that we&#39;ll need to put up notices on is a reminder on books.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah... in theory we can leave the books from THIS semester here,&quot; Sylvia commented, &quot;but if no one trades theirs in at the end of the semester... or doesn&#39;t trade all of them in... it&#39;ll be a good idea to take them home to save on space in their rooms.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess the big question would be where to put that notice?&quot; Maddie commented, &quot;and who will be carrying out the inspections before going home for Christmas.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Tiffany and I can stay here till the end,&quot; Princess volunteered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay... so where do we put the main notice?&quot; Theseus wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d think with the main bulletin boards near the bathrooms on each floor,&quot; Tiffany commented, &quot;along with one just above the sign out sheet outside our door. And Princess and I can then make last minute checks before we leave. All in agreement?&quot;<br />
<br />
The others all raised their hands in agreement with the decision. Tiffany then knocked down on the table with a small smile before she concluded the meeting for the night.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then I think tonight&#39;s meeting for the heads of Pi Eta Tau is successfully concluded,&quot; Tiffany commented, &quot;and should schedules be such...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s get through the last days of classes and finals before we start worrying about saying Merry Christmas,&quot; Maddie interrupted, &quot;I know it&#39;s December now... but let&#39;s not get ahead of ourselves.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Especially when Las Vegas is warmer than Animalia and Lyre,&quot; Theseus added.<br />
<br />
&quot;That warmth is a good thing, though,&quot; Sylvia commented, though knowing that the two Poodle Animalians and two Belgian Blue Cattle Animalians probably enjoyed some of the more wintery conditions a bit more than she did.</p>
