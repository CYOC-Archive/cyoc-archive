<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was about 3 weeks since Damellia became Girahed&#39;s mate. As such they spent countless hours with each other day and night. Their usual nights were full of surprises, but each and every time Damellia would end up getting mounted and fucked. The feeling of Girahed&#39;s huge throbbing dragon meat never ceased to make Damellia moan, make her orgasm, and make her feel so dirty and incredible.<br />
<br />
Damellia loved these feelings, and after their first week Damellia was knocked up. Of course, she was nervous, and she even told Girahed that she could never imagine getting pregnant, but he just comforted her and stayed with her like any responsible mate should. During the next two weeks, Damellia&#39;s stomach and breasts grew reaching ample size, now J cups in dragon terms.<br />
<br />
However even after all of that, their cycle of mating never stopped, and Damellia awaits the day that her clutch come, and the day she would lay her glorious eggs would come at last.<br />
________<br />
<br />
Damellia woke up curled up around her stomach within a large dragon nest. She yawned loudly then a familiar black claw gently cupped around one of her breasts, and she blushed. &quot;I see you’re awake impending mother.&quot; Girahed said with a smile, and Damellia giggled and looked up at him with a smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mmm, last night was just incredible. I can’t wait to go again later tonight.&quot; Damellia said with a smile and Girahed saw the look of anticipation in her eyes and laughed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh you, are you sure you’re alright? You spoke of having some...pains last night, correct?&quot; Girahed asked, and Damellia paused then giggled,&quot;Gira, I&#39;m fine, truly I am. That was probably just &#39;you know what&#39; kicking and squirming around inside of mommy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Girahed paused at this and raised a brow then said,&quot;Well....okay, if you say so my love.&quot; Girahed then stood up and he extended his claw to Damellia in a noble fashion. She took his claw, and he helped her stand up, and she took a moment to balance herself.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oof! Thanks hun, you’re the best.&quot; Damellia said and Girahed laughed and said,&quot;Was that just now, or when you sat on my cock last night while I pretended to milk those teats of yours?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No matter how many times you push them Gira, you&#39;ll nev....&quot; Damellia paused now and her eyes grew wide as she all of a sudden felt some kind of liquid burst out of her pussy, and seep onto the nest. Girahed’s eyes grew even wider than hers as he witnessed what happened before him, and Damellia blushed as she stared back at her vagina.<br />
<br />
At first Damellia thought she had pissed herself, but the scent was nothing like the stench of urine that she was often greeted to when Girahed marks the perimeter as his territory, and you too on occasion. It was then Damellia felt something lurch in her stomach and dart its way towards her uterus causing her to growl as she felt a sharp pain coming from that area, and she realized what was happening and she whined.<br />
<br />
Girahed rushed to Damellia and looked her in the eyes and shouting,&quot;Damellia?! What’s going on?! Are you okay?!&quot; Damellia looked to Girahed with worried eyes and whimpered,&quot;G...Gira, I think my water broke. They’re coming out, NOW!&quot;<br />
<br />
Damellia felt something lurch again and she screamed, and she began taking deep breaths. Girahed, who&#39;s face was absolutely shocked by this news, rushed up to Damellia and said,&quot;Good good, deep breaths, very deep breaths. We prepared for this from the day we knew it was coming. Now lay down my princess, and let me help spread those legs.&quot;<br />
<br />
Damellia nodded and she laid down on her side, and she watched as Girahed helped her spread her legs for childbirth. &quot;You remember what we talked about with how this works, right Damellia?&quot; Girahed asked.<br />
<br />
Damellia was breathing heavily now, she nodded to Girahed and said,&quot;Push, don’t stop pushing, the eggs will hatch after about an hour....right?&quot; Girahed smiled at Damellia and he nuzzled her swollen gut and said,&quot;That’s my mate, my beautiful, pregnant mate.&quot;<br />
<br />
Damellia blushed a little and smiled, and Girahed held out his claw to her, which she took hold of lovingly. Moments later, Damellia felt something large and round trying to exit her womb, and she roared out in pain and squeezed Girahed&#39;s claw. &quot;Aaaah!! Fuck! I...it’s...!&quot; Damellia screamed as she felt the walls of her vagina stretch out wide, wider than she ever thought they could.<br />
<br />
Girahed growled feeling his claw getting strangled, and he stared at Damellia&#39;s womb. &quot;I see the top of the egg, keep going your doing great!&quot; Girahed shouted to Damellia for encouragement, and she let out a humongous roar, and began pushing.<br />
<br />
&quot;It’s....too big!&quot; Damellia roared, and Girahed looked back up to her and growled,&quot;No it isn’t! Not for you! You know how strong you are, and how tough you are! I know this too because you carried me on your back while we mated to the nest and back! You lived in that god awful castle for how many years alone?! Finally you’re going to build your own family with me! You&#39;ve come too far to just turn back now! So PUSH!!&quot;<br />
<br />
Damellia felt touched by Girahed&#39;s words, and she nodded to him and gave it one last, and mighty push. She felt the egg plop out of her womb, and Girahed picked up the egg, barely able to hold it in one claw, and he set it next to her.<br />
<br />
&quot;The first egg of every clutch is the worst for many. The second will be bad, but not by a long shot. Keep pushing, you’re doing wonderful thus far.&quot; Girahed said, and Damellia nodded to him, and she felt the second egg on its way to exit her body, and she roared again.<br />
<br />
&quot;FuuuUUCK!!!&quot; Damellia roared again, and she spread apart her legs once more, feeling her vagina wall magnificently stretch out wide. She felt the egg plop out of her body like the other one, but this time it was much smoother than before, and kind of relaxed actually.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ooooh god, that one just slid on out.&quot; Damellia groaned, and Girahed smiled at this and kissed her on the forehead. &quot;This is the part that I said you&#39;d love last night.&quot; Girahed exclaimed just in time for another egg to fall down into her womb.<br />
<br />
The third egg Damellia laid was large, but as her vagina stretched now, she instead found a lust inside of her. When she laid her egg, she moaned, and orgasmed before Girahed collected the egg and moved it over to the other two.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh wow, that’s....amazing,&quot; Damellia said with a lust filled grin, and Girahed smiled at her and said,&quot;Don’t stop, you’re going to be the best mommy ever.&quot; Damellia giggled and looked at Girahed then said,&quot;Make it broodmommy, I want to be like this again.&quot;<br />
<br />
Girahed looked unsure, and Damellia wasn’t sure if she was talking, or if it was just the lust. But she did know one thing, she loves the feeling of pushing eggs out of her pussy.<br />
<br />
After about an hour, but what felt like only a few minutes to Damellia. Damellia had laid her final egg, and she looked up at Girahed with an exhausted smile on her face. &quot;Gira, that was....incredible, I wish you could do this too and know how I felt.&quot; Damellia said as she laid there with a cunt that was leaking out her own juices onto the nest.<br />
<br />
Girahed collected the final egg, and had been warming the other eggs while Damellia gave birth. &quot;That makes.....19 eggs, wow I impressed myself, we have a nice large clutch here.&quot; Girahed exclaimed and Damellia laughed weakly and giggled,&quot;Next time shoot for 20 big boy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Girahed chuckled at this and nuzzled Damellia&#39;s muzzle with his. &quot;You’re a warrior aren’t you? Laughing even when utterly exhausted no matter what. Are you okay dear?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I’m...&quot; Damellia paused and yawned then continued, &quot;I&#39;m fine...just could use a second wind is all. How are you? How are they?&quot; Girahed smiled at her and said,&quot;All in tact, all ready to hatch at any moment now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Any moment? Heh, how long was I in labor?&quot; Damellia asked, and Girahed laughed at this question then suddenly his eyes widened and Damellia could hear a faint tapping sound.<br />
<br />
Girahed smiled at you then he got off of the eggs, and Damellia could swear she saw one of them jump. With that jump the egg cracked both on the top and bottom. Suddenly the egg seemed to jump again, and suddenly the shell shattered, and a small hatchling emerged from the egg and began wailing like any normal baby would.<br />
<br />
As their mother, Damellia took it upon herself to lick the new whelp clean from all of the contents within the egg. The child had black scales like it’s father, when it’s eyes opened Damellia was touched to see it had her eyes, and finally a glance between the legs of the whelp indicated that it was female.<br />
<br />
&quot;Awww, our firstborn is a beautiful little girl!&quot; Damellia shrieked with happiness, and her daughter looked up and around confused and curious. Their daughter tried to walk, but her body was too weak, so Damellia gently picked up her new daughter and held the tiny welp in one of her claws.<br />
<br />
Their daughter then began crying again, and Damellia hugged her gently then brought the small thing up to one of her nipples. The whelp paused putting its tiny claws up to the nipple curiously. Then the whelp opened her mouth and clung onto Damellia&#39;s breast, and began sucking.<br />
<br />
&quot;She’s hungry, what should we name her? Oooh, this is just too precious!&quot; Damellia shrieked again, and suddenly more tapping could be heard from the eggs. Girahed just watched and stared the entire time as Damellia fed their daughter. By the time the other eggs began to hatch Girahed was outside of the cave, and in the distance you head him roar,&quot;HOLY SHIT!! I&#39;M A DAD!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
Damellia blushed once she heard this as Girahed had always come across as the gentlemenly type of creature for her. He had never been this excited, and has never roared out like he did, and that made Damellia burst out laughing.<br />
<br />
A few minutes had passed, and Damellia watched as a 4 more eggs hatched. She now had her second born, a son with her scales and eyes, drinking from her breast, and her daughter had just finished up and burped. Girahed then flew back in, and Damellia looked at him and laughed,&quot;What was that about Gira?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What wa....we&#39;re parents! Just look at you! Look at them! This is all just.....I need to lay down.&quot; Girahed panted then he laid down next to Damellia and watched as more eggs began to hatch. &quot;You nearly tired yourself out as much as me dear. I’m the one who just gave birth here!&quot; Damellia laughed and she nuzzled Girahed.<br />
<br />
Girahed blushed some, and then he turned to the new whelps who were emerging from their eggs, and he began cleaning each one by tongue. Damellia breastfed each child, burped them, and laid each down to sleep. <br />
<br />
&quot;7 daughters, and 12 sons, I feel....humbled by this.&quot; Girahed said then Damellia looked at him and asked,&quot;What should we do with them after we name them?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Well once they can walk, and get cave-trained. I&#39;ll teach at least our boys how to fight. If our girls wish to learn too they can, but I&#39;d much rather hear what you think we should do with them.&quot; Girahed said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Gira, you’re thinking too far ahead with this. They need to learn and explore the world both on their own, and through our guidance. Let’s teach them how to read and write, calm it down and take it slow. They have time, and we will have time to ourselves and them. Besides, we can always make more.&quot; Damellia said.<br />
<br />
Girahed raised his brow and looked at her,&quot;You were serious about becoming a brood mother?&quot; Damellia shrugged and grinned at him then said,&quot;Oh you have no idea hun.&quot; Girahed paused and nodded to Damellia, and then he urged her to rest.<br />
<br />
Damellia agreed to rest, and she fell asleep next to her hatchlings. She wondered if she would be able to become a prince again still. But now Damellia would rather give birth and tend to her hatchlings.<br />
<br />
<br />
The next day....</p>
