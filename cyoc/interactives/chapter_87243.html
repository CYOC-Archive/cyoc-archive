<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I live in a world where countries no longer battle over oil, gold, diamonds or land; instead, a new source of power and money has appeared in the world, information.<br />
<br />
At first no one really realized how important it was.<br />
<br />
Information flowed, went and came, was hidden and protected, given and spread. It was everywhere; in books, in stories, in ink or in screens, pen drives, libraries, legends, myths, movies, series, comics... everyone knew something someone else didn&#39;t.<br />
<br />
And as time passed by, the spread and speed in which one could acquire information increased; more and more it became easy to access someone else&#39;s knowledge; from paper, through the imprint, to the internet and the flux system, one after the other, the globalization of information became absolute.<br />
<br />
That is, until the Great Vortex incident.<br />
<br />
Overnight, governments around the world decided to acquire all existing information and seal it away, for them to use and abuse, while the citizens were forbidden to even read without paying taxes for it.<br />
<br />
Chaos and rebellion insured; information became a wealth you had to pay for. Programs and protocols were installed into people&#39;s head; you&#39;d have to pay taxes for imagining things, taxes for developing, and even taxes for improving it.<br />
<br />
They even make raids on a constant basis, robbing any illegal information people had, and killing them were that information important enough.<br />
<br />
All to gather it in one place.<br />
<br />
Babylon Tower.<br />
<br />
A digital information paradise, located nowhere and everywhere at the same time, only accessible through the flux system, and guarded with the utmost security; getting too close would guarantee your death.<br />
<br />
At least if you didn&#39;t know how to get through.<br />
<br />
That is my mission.<br />
<br />
I&#39;m an Infiltrator.<br />
<br />
I dive into the flux System, and steal information from the Babel Tower to sell it to the highest bidder.<br />
<br />
From history, to science, maths, physics, chemistry... any piece of information has its value, and I, being the best, will steal it and bring it to the client. If they pay enough that is.<br />
<br />
That is my life, that is my work, that is my specialty; that is my joy.<br />
<br />
I was known as &quot;Silver&quot; the most wanted person in existence; the government wanted me dead, everyone else wanted to hire me.<br />
<br />
Today was one of those days I had to extract information from Babel Tower to give to a client.<br />
<br />
I reclined against the flux access point, letting it wrap around my head as the connections with my brain were formed, linking me with the system.<br />
<br />
A blink of the eyes, and I was already immersed.<br />
<br />
Looking around, I immediately recognized the internet remnants that had been devoid of any information, the world it was left as was mostly 2-D; and touch, smell and taste were not available.<br />
<br />
Feeling a bit happy I had managed to find such a remote and forgotten area of the flux system to immerse into, I quickly left, going in the general direction of Babel Tower, the only thing that can be felt and seen from every corner of Flux.<br />
<br />
Exiting the internet, I felt as my missing senses came back, the smell of digital strings and compressed images was the first thing I noticed, accompanied by the singular taste of fake information.<br />
<br />
I sighed as I realized I had gone straight into the lowest levels of Flux, where fakes and lies were the most likely thing you&#39;d find were you to attempt to learn anything; even Babel stopped trying to raid this sector since they never found anything worthwhile.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you interested in buying the original Shrek?&quot; a pixelated voice asked me, I turned my head to just see a blurry image talking to me. &quot;We guarantee it&#39;s got all the scenes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, and the Earth is flat.&quot; I replied with a hint of sarcasm, wondering if it knew what sarcasm was to begin with. &quot;I&#39;ll buy it if you tell me what&#39;s the name of the princess.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Princess?&quot; it suddenly sounded confused.<br />
<br />
&quot;I thought as much.&quot; I continued my way.<br />
<br />
To be able to see a movie, you had to not only pay for the movie itself, but also any information regarding the movie; for example, to see three men on a donkey, you&#39;d have to pay to know what a *donkey* is, and what does it mean *to ride*. It&#39;s just another way to insure no one knew something Babel didn&#39;t already know.<br />
<br />
I made my way through the run down sector, and eventually reached a higher class one, with actual bricks and windows as part of the decoration instead of bits and bytes.<br />
<br />
Looking around, I searched for a certain place where I&#39;d always go before a mission.<br />
<br />
The pub was hidden behind a blank screen saver, with enough of a firewall to make sure anyone inside could get out in case a raid began.<br />
<br />
&quot;So you&#39;re in for another mission?&quot; asked the young man standing behind the counter, the place was empty, and I&#39;m sure no one would come for a while. &quot;Remember our deal.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, yeah, you give me supplies, and I give you a copy of what I take with me.&quot; I stated as I stretched my neck to both sides. &quot;Either way, today&#39;s a bit special; they asked me to retrieve something from level six.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sixth?&quot; he wondered. &quot;What&#39;re they looking for in level six? Advanced quantum technology or something?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dunno, the file is codenamed *Black eagle*.&quot; I stated. &quot;So I&#39;ll need to be fully loaded before I enter Babel.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok, I&#39;ll get your stuff.&quot; he vanished for a moment.<br />
<br />
Babel is divided into six parts, each named for the floor they&#39;re in; First, Second, Third, Fourth, Fifth and Sixth; the higher the floor, the more advanced the information is, and the harder it is to reach.<br />
<br />
What bugs me the most is that getting in isn&#39;t too hard; the worst part was getting out.<br />
<br />
If I was caught, they&#39;d probably extract all information within my brain, reducing me to an animal that moved solely on instinct; though I&#39;m sure they&#39;d kill me soon after, just to make sure I&#39;d be unable to do anything else.<br />
<br />
This was the danger of Flux; your whole mind was within the system, and anyone who got into it could do as they pleased with your brain; from modifying your memories, to even delete certain traits of your personality.<br />
<br />
This is why it was possible to create the Great Vortex, this is why any piece of information had a price, this is why I hate Babel and all it stands for; even more those who help it prosper.<br />
<br />
&quot;Here ya go.&quot; he said after coming back, handing me my special equipment.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I&#39;m off then.&quot; I stated as I went back outside.<br />
<br />
Getting to Babel Tower was rather easy, all roads lead there after all; I wasn&#39;t stopped by any guards, nor did I call any attention onto myself.<br />
<br />
The closer I got, the more colossal the data base seemed.<br />
<br />
Like the name suggested, it was a tower so tall it had no end to it. Made from light, shadows, bricks and science, the massive structure was a perfect while cylinder that, were it to occupy a space in the real world, it&#39;d have several miles in width.<br />
<br />
&quot;Here I go...&quot; I mumbled as I activated my cloaking device, and sneaked past the two guards in the entrance.<br />
<br />
One step into the tower, and the world around me vanished, being entirely replaced by a sea of numbers and letters; -This is child grade level- I thought to myself as I swam past them, looking for the entrance to Second.<br />
<br />
Unlike a normal tower, each floor had a world of its own. Where I entering the level in a legal way, I&#39;d get a line that&#39;d guide me to whatever information I had bought and back; but since I had sneaked inside, I&#39;d have to look for it myself.<br />
<br />
Worst part was that the *labyrinth* would get more complex as it went higher, meaning it would take more time and effort to reach the next staircase.<br />
<br />
And even though there were no guards within Babel itself, getting out of it when having entered illegally is extremely more complex; most lose their way and die by accidentally reaching an impossible equation or the sort.<br />
<br />
Letters began to form words, and numbers began to add and multiply between one another, I was on the right path.<br />
<br />
Not more than a minute later, I had reached a place where there was *nothing*, not words, not numbers and not even sounds.<br />
<br />
Second was, as expected, more complex than First; numbers had turned into simple equations, words into phrases; the laws of logic had begun to vaguely form here and there, colors appeared and so did the basic geometrical shapes.<br />
<br />
Third existed in a paradigm of illogical equations, physics and chemistry began to form, composts began to appear as well as some of the rules that formed part of the world; paragraphs had become light reading, and geometry had entered the third dimension.<br />
<br />
Fourth was much like the real world in its prime form, the elements had formed carbon based life, the differential and derivative equations had formed seas from which everything else seemed to follow to give themselves shape; though in a lonely corner, literature had evolved into theater, light books into novels and poetry, philosophy beginning to take shape between the both.<br />
<br />
Fifth was almost an exact replica of the actual world, life had evolved into humans an all other living beings, society had appeared as movies, series and comics formed; maths enveloped everything as near infinite equations formed the rules by which behavior appeared and time and space combined as mass deformed them.<br />
<br />
Reaching Sixth proved to be much of a challenge, much more than any of the other floors; I had been at Sixth&#39;s door only once, and I didn&#39;t cross it cause I would have been risking delaying my transport too much.<br />
<br />
But just like last time, I reached Sixth&#39;s door without barely realizing I had gotten there in the first place.<br />
<br />
Taking in a deep breath, I opened the gate to Sixth.<br />
<br />
Much to my shock, I found myself surrounded by nothing but blackness. An unending sea of dark that had no consistency, shape, form or even movement, though felt as if I couldn&#39;t move from where I stood.<br />
<br />
&quot;What is this place?&quot; I asked, wondering what sort of information laid here as to shape its inner world in such a way.<br />
<br />
You have finally came. a voice echoed in and out of my being. You are the first to get here.<br />
<br />
&quot;Who are you?&quot; I asked, trying to look around and find something. &quot;What&#39;s going on?&quot;<br />
<br />
I am Babel. came my answer. I am the consciousness that keeps the tower from crumbling, I am the power that moves Flux, I am all and nothing within this world.<br />
<br />
&quot;Babel?&quot; I felt a twinge of anger within me. &quot;You&#39;re the one responsible for what&#39;s happened to humanity?&quot; I demanded. &quot;You&#39;re the one that&#39;s sucked out all the information in the world?&quot;<br />
<br />
No, I am something created from that. the voice replied. The mass of information began to form conduct algorithms, and I was formed. then came a pause. With time, I evolved, much like you have; I grew self-conscious, I gained thoughts and emotions, and soon after the ability to remember. another pause. But I&#39;ve grown past that as well, I was able to enter Sixth, I have evolved past human possibility and reality.<br />
<br />
&quot;It almost sounds as if you&#39;re describing yourself as a God.&quot; I snapped.<br />
<br />
From a normal humans point of view, that would be plausible. it snapped back. But for you I&#39;d be no more than an equal.<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you talking about?&quot; I felt a chill go down my spine, though ignored it.<br />
<br />
Do you know what are the conditions to reach the next level? Babel wondered into my brain. To be able to reach Sixth, your mind must be able to surpass Fifth, you must be able to surpass human behavior and understanding, you must see past it; else, it&#39;d be impossible to reach Sixth.<br />
<br />
&quot;So what?&quot; I asked. &quot;You&#39;re claiming I&#39;m some sort of superhuman like you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Sadly, no. the tone became lonesome. Unlike me, you have a real body, you have a form that attaches you to the four dimensional world you live in, barely able to move at will in three of those four. a pause. However, you have the potential to evolve, to break the shell of your body and soar freely in all dimensions.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whatever...&quot; I sighed as I shook my head, though felt I didn&#39;t. &quot;I&#39;ll just get the package and get out of here.&quot;<br />
<br />
There is no *Black Bird* in this world; I am the client. the words felt bone chilling. Also, to escape Sixth, you need to have enough understanding of it, which you don&#39;t. I felt the pressure around me increase. I would have truly enjoyed to find an equal in this world, however, much like yourself, I am incomplete, also unable to escape Sixth.<br />
<br />
&quot;Meaning we&#39;re both stuck.&quot; I mumbled. &quot;Only you can live on forever while I&#39;d die if my real body dies.&quot;<br />
<br />
But I know a way to get out. a suggestive tone was used. We are both halves that are unable to reach a whole; you, with a body and a true knowledge that sees past feelings, emotions and even reality itself; and me, someone with an understanding that surpasses the rules of both our worlds.<br />
<br />
&quot;Get to the point.&quot; the words came harsh, a hint of fear had reached me; a part of my mind already knew what he meant.<br />
<br />
Why not become one? Babel suggested. It&#39;s the only plausible answer as to be able to escape Sixth.<br />
<br />
&quot;And if we aren&#39;t?&quot; the question came desperate, as I tried in vain to find a way around the suggestion.<br />
<br />
Once united, even if your body died, we wouldn&#39;t. came the reply I had hoped that hadn&#39;t. We&#39;d be able to wait for someone else to be able to enter Sixth, or, given enough time, we&#39;d be able to even learn the truth of Sixth and escape it on our own.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine.&quot; I finally declared, feeling all too desperate and confused.<br />
<br />
Then I&#39;ll begin. came Babel&#39;s voice.<br />
<br />
I felt it, the presence surrounding me gently, tightening around my skin and pressing itself into my being, entering through every pore and orifice as the darkness did not subside one bit.<br />
<br />
The sensation creeped itself into my body, and slowly took over every cell in it, spreading further and further until it reached my brain, where it came to a sudden halt.<br />
<br />
Did you think I&#39;d fuse with a lowly being such as yourself? the cold voice whispered into my head. No, I&#39;ll take over your body, so I can be free once and for all.<br />
<br />
&quot;I thought as much.&quot; I grinned to myself as I felt his confusion within me, a sigh of relief escaping my lips for a moment as satisfaction washed over me. &quot;What do you think that I want the most?&quot; I enjoyed the long silence that followed my question. &quot;The tower has caused nothing but misery and pain for the world… the only reason as to why I went in and out of it so often was because I was looking for a way to destroy it!&quot;<br />
<br />
Fool! it laughed inside me. How do you plan to destroy me and the tower? You&#39;re not even able to find a way out Sixth!<br />
<br />
&quot;You gave me the answer yourself.&quot; I laughed back. &quot;You&#39;re the program that holds this whole place together, right?&quot; a second laugh. &quot;And you&#39;re no more than a mind without a body, right?&quot; I was trying to keep somewhat calm, certain of what would happen next. &quot;I wonder how you&#39;ll react once you gain your senses and *feel*.&quot;<br />
<br />
Before Babel could wonder what I was talking about, I took one of the viruses I had meant for a guard, and injected it into my being, feeling as it did exactly as it had been programed to and paralyzed me right away.<br />
<br />
What have you done!!? roared the voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;This virus will change the victim&#39;s body into something that&#39;ll *feel* things in a near inhuman degree.&quot; I tried to say the words with a laugh, but the paralysis was reaching my vocal cords as well. &quot;I once accidentally used it on myself, and the effects were mind blowing, I had to log off or I&#39;d have gone insane…&quot; I turned inwardly, feeling as the virus had also trapped that alien being within me. &quot;For someone like you, I bet you&#39;ll get overwhelmed halfway through.&quot;<br />
<br />
You fool! it roared inside my head. Because the nature of our existence while within Sixth, whatever changes you do will not only affect your real body, but it&#39;ll become permanent as well!<br />
<br />
&quot;Guess that&#39;s it for me, then.&quot; I shrugged it off. &quot;Don&#39;t worry though, if anything, we&#39;ll end up quite happy with the results.&quot;</p>
