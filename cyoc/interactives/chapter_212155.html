<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jacob stared at a naked Kate as he closed the car door with Kate standing in the open doorway into the kitchen. Kate said nothing and only smiled, her cock throbbing hard under her chest. Kate now preferred Jacob the way he is, and once they got into the office they would review what had happened. Jacob saw the larger chest and monster cock on what looked to be Kate&#39;s barely twenty year old body. Kate&#39;s feminine shape was defined with a very masculine musculature. Jacob, on the other hand, was more female than Kate. Jacob was now sporting the fetish body of the weekend, with just a mirror image of Kate&#39;s cock to prevent him from having the full package. Jacob no longer had testicles and now featured a fully functional womb preparing for its first menstruation cycle. Jacob felt a sudden awareness when realization of the day&#39;s changes set in, standing there with his eyes locked on Kate. <br />
<br />
&quot;I was only gone for a few hours,&quot; Jacob thought to himself as he walked up to kiss Kate. Jacob unzipped his  high neck suit down to allow for Kate to handle his ample breasts. Kate&#39;s reaction was stronger than this morning, as her cock tongue went deep into Jacob&#39;s throat.<br />
<br />
Kate was momentarily lost in the kiss, the sensations from her tongue going straight to her rock hard cock pushing into the gap between her breasts. Kate&#39;s hands moved to palm and massage Jacobs large, stripper looking F-cups he now sported. Kate loved the fetish body that Jacob picked over the weekend, and now he had it for her enjoyment. Kate loved how she gave Jacob what he desired and craved, and that he now satisfied her lusts and cravings.<br />
<br />
Jacob, meantime, was suckling on Kate&#39;s tongue until it was dry of her saliva that was more like seminal fluid. Jacob slowly broke from the kiss as Kate withdrew her tongue. Both of them would find it took a few minutes before they could talk again.  Jacob went into the bedroom to strip naked and to look into the mirror as he put sight to awareness of the day&#39;s changes. The vaginal opening under his tight scrotum was today&#39;s winner of Jacob&#39;s biggest surprise. Jacob then went into the office where Katie was sitting with the Chronivac app open.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well...,&quot; Jacob started with a raspy voice, his throat still raw and sore from the squeezing, &quot;...what&#39;s today&#39;s damage? <br />
<br />
&quot;Well...,&quot; Kate&#39;s voice was cautious, &quot;....your fully female with a cock. That fetish body you had this weekend...that&#39;s what you have now plus some extras.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jacob sat down and went though the menu&#39;s and screens....Kate got up and went to make the evening meal, which was not much for Jacob with his recent diet changes. Jacob joined Kate in the kitchen and said, &quot;There were more reality settings. Your profile was enabled for changes, and that was the override. I also left it alone. I am now curious where you take this.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kate felt a pit in her stomach. She thought it was an honest mistake or Jacob&#39;s settings that did this. The news that she missed some setting that had small but compounding effects really bothered her.<br />
<br />
While Kate was lost in thought, Jacob got on his knees and took Kate&#39;s cock into his mouth and began to nurse the monster cock into his throat. Kate steadied herself as Jacob built her orgasm quickly , and soon the hybrid orgasm&#39;s first wave crashed through her body, though mostly in her cock, as she felt her cock begin to unload deep in Jacob&#39;s throat. Jacob did his best to edge and bring Katie to orgasm until her large testicle and huge prostate had emptied themselves. Jacob was proud of his ability to empty Kate and make it last more than five minutes. Jacob slowly relaxed his throat so Kathy could slide out gently. Jacob did give the tip a last squeeze before letting it fall free and standing up, and wiping his lips with a napkin.<br />
<br />
&quot;Satisfied?,&quot; asked Kate.<br />
<br />
Unable to speak for the moment, Jacob nodded yes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Did you see what I got for you now?&quot; asked Kate, as she held a nipple up.<br />
<br />
Jacob pointed to his chest first, and Kate shook her head no, then he pointed to her breast pointing at him, and she nodded yes. Jacob didn&#39;t need any more, and quickly took the thick nipple into his mouth. Jacob&#39;s suckling was rewarded with a rather salty milk, and he moaned loudly, savoring his favorite taste across is tongue.<br />
<br />
&quot;I thought you&#39;d like that,&quot; Kate whispered as she stroked the back of Jacob&#39;s head while he was latched onto her breast. &quot;And when you finish that one, you can drain the other,&quot; she whispered. Kate enjoyed nursing her children and her mate.<br />
<br />
Jacob knew he was on a liquid diet, and would need to nurse from Katie at least twice a day. He often took his breakfast in bed. Jacob&#39;s memories were hazy, and so were Kate&#39;s, as the reality changes based on Kate&#39;s carnal desires continued to cascade. Jacob would go to bed happy, free from want or desire to go back to those memories he has before the Chronivac as that was also Kate&#39;s desire.<br />
<br />
Kate wanted to find the right time to talk about having another child, but they had just moved into a smaller house...so birth control was on the list. Jacob went to bed early, his belly full and Kate went to the Chronivac to see if anything could be done to slow down or halt the changes that continue to be made. Kate saw the gender for Jacob&#39;s profile matched hers, &quot;Female-Hermaphrodite&quot; and now both of them had a blank sexuality box. Kate started reading and clicking, looking for something she missed, especially the reality setting in her profile would enable this.</p>
