<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mike was very depressed watching TV in his living room. Tomorrow was the local team bowling tournament and he had been practicing a lot, but unfortunately life had other plans for his teammates. One of them was terrible sick, another one was in a emergency business trip and the last one was arrested two days ago and he was currently in jail.<br />
<br />
Nathalie, Mike&#39;s wife was watching her depressed husband from the kitchen&#39;s tabla. She knew how much he wanted to participate in that competition, he had talked about it for weeks and now he won&#39;t even join. She really wants to cheer him up, but unfortunately the tournament has some restrictions that didn&#39;t allowed her to play.<br />
<br />
She was thinking about that when she suddenly heard a lot of noise coming from her sons&#39; bedroom. She immediately went upstairs and noticed that Oscar and Paul were fighting again. That was normal and she had learned a few tricks to control them, so she quickly ended up their fight.<br />
<br />
Oscar was 11 and Paul was 8 years old, and his age gap was a current topic of fighting when Oscar claims he has priority over his little brother at videogames, TV, etc. After Nathalie managed to stop their fight, Paul started to complain about Oscar&#39;s attitude towards him, bullying him constantly and taking his stuff.<br />
<br />
Nathalie didn&#39;t have time for this, she wanted to help Mike. The bowling tournament will start in a few hours and she knew if he won&#39;t participate he will be depressed for months. She had a plan, or better said, an idea but it was too crazy and risky that she wasn&#39;t sure of doing it. She looked in her pocket where she had a little bottle with pills. She sighed as she stared at her boys who had started to fight again.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Mike was watching some tool commercials or so in TV, nothing really important. He just wanted to stay there and don&#39;t think about anything. He sighed again when he got a text message from his wife. That was odd, he thought, she was in the house, she doesn&#39;t need to send him a message.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve found a way to help you.&quot; He read from his phone before he started to heard some weird sounds coming from upstairs, particularly from his kids&#39; bedroom. He thought they&#39;re fighting again, so he took a deep breath and went to look what&#39;s going on there. However what he found was totally unexpected and he got frozen at the door frame.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom, my briefs are too small! It hurts!&quot; &quot;Don&#39;t worry, honey. We&#39;re going to take some from your dad&#39;s, they&#39;ll be more comfortable.&quot; &quot;Why are we doing this anyway? I don&#39;t like bowling.&quot; &quot;We&#39;re doing this for your father, he really care for us and now he needs us.&quot; &quot;But mom! I feel so weird!&quot;<br />
<br />
Mike rubbed his eyes in disbelief, in his sons&#39; bedroom were three men wearing nothing more than their underwear. Two of them with tighty withies and the the last one in women&#39;s panties. The three of them were big, beefy and hairy, like true alpha men. However their behavior was completely different.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dad!&quot; One of them shouted when he noticed Mike next to the door. The other two turned their head on his direction as well and Mike felt some kind of familiarity when he watched their faces. &quot;Oh, Mike!&quot; The other with panties said. &quot;I didn&#39;t expect you&#39;ll see us before we change our clothes.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mike shook his head and asked was going on. He didn&#39;t know if he calls the police or just run away from these guys. However, before he can do any of that, the guy in panties came closer to him and explained it all. He tell Mike that he was Nathalie and that those other two guys were his sons, Oscar and Paul. &quot;We took a pill that mom gave us. The dip pill!&quot; One of the men in white briefs said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t be stupid Paul, it&#39;s called the DILF pill.&quot; The other man said, who Mike assumed was Oscar. &quot;Mom told us it will turn us into grownups in order to be your teammates for your bowling competition, dad.&quot; Mike felt weird of hearing a man like that calling him dad. &quot;That pill worked so fast that our clothes can&#39;t handle it. We&#39;re going to need some of yours, dad.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So, Nathalie?&quot; Mike said to the man in panties who just blushed a little in shame. &quot;You decided to become a man just for me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I will do that and even more, honey. I love you.&quot; She tried to kiss him, but then she realized that would be really awkward and she stopped almost immediately. &quot;Maybe you should call me Nate for now, Nathalie is too feminine for this body.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So, how old are we now?&quot; Paul asked while he rubbed the hair that had grown all over his chest. &quot;I&#39;m not exactly sure, but I can say you must be on your mid thirties.&quot; Mike replied. &quot;Natha... I mean, Nate, did you tell them what DILF means?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t think it&#39;s necessary.&quot; Nate replied. &quot;We&#39;re just going to participate in the bowling competition and tomorrow we will be back to normal. And now, if you excuse me, I really need to take some of your briefs. These panties weren&#39;t made to hold balls and it&#39;s very uncomfortable to see them sliding off through the sides.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nate left the room followed by Oscar who can&#39;t stop rubbing his bigger dick through his briefs&#39; fabric. Paul was pulling out his briefs&#39; waistband to take a quick look at his new package and smiled before he release the band and followed the other two almost naked men. &quot;Dad, I didn&#39;t know grownups&#39; pee pees were so big and hairy!&quot; Paul said before he leaves. &quot;Is yours as big as mine?&quot;</p>
