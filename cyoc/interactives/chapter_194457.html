<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Melissa smirked as she now made her way to Carl&#39;s office. At 18 the raven haired beauty now possessed a youthful face, ample curves, and a thin waist that she knew would drive the teenage Carl wild. With the age difference now cut significantly down, Melissa hoped she could now become her teenage bosses girlfriend.<br />
<br />
As the teenage secretary now walked down the hall, she paused. The sound of crying was coming from one of the utility rooms. Melissa now stopped in front of it, she could swear it sounded like a little boy. Opening the door Melissa now raised an eyebrow. &quot;What are you doing little guy?&quot;<br />
<br />
The 3 year old simply sniffed, his thumb firmly planted in his mouth. Melissa was stupefied by this, the brunette child was dressed in an overly large white tshirt. &quot;Are you lost,&quot; Melissa asked. The boy said nothing, simply whimpering as he looked up at the young woman. &quot;Whats your name,&quot; Melissa asked, bending down to try a comfort the boy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nolan,&quot; the boy said softly, his thumb still in his mouth.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nolan,&quot; Melissa said curiously. &quot;How old are you?&quot; Nolan held up 3 fingers to show his age, only confusing Melissa more.<br />
<br />
&quot;How did you get in here,&quot; she asked. &quot;And why are you dressed like that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I dunno,&quot; Nolan sniffed. &quot;I want my mommy.&quot; <br />
<br />
Melissa was still confused, a little boy stuck in a janitors locker room, dressed only in a white tshirt. Glancing back Melissa&#39;s eyes went wide as she noticed the discarded jumpsuit and boots. &quot;Nolan,&quot; she exclaimed. &quot;Oh my God Nolan! Is that you? Are you the janitor that saw Ethan?&quot;<br />
<br />
Nolan said nothing, continuing to suck his thumb. &quot;Wheres my mommy,&quot; he asked. Melissa said nothing, continuing to study the young boy. It couldn&#39;t be a coincidence, could it? Now Melissa began to worry, if this happened to Nolan, what would happen to her?<br />
<br />
As Melissa now began to worry, she felt one of her bra straps slide off her shoulder. Quickly pushing it back into place, she fearfully watched it slide back down, followed by the other one. &quot;Oh no,&quot; she whispered.<br />
<br />
Melissa looked herself over, without seeing her reflection it was hard to tell if she was getting younger too. Maybe her bra looked a little bigger, maybe her skirt was a little looser, maybe her nylons had a bit of extra material. Regardless she needed to see Ethan. The only problem was she just couldn&#39;t leave Nolan behind. <br />
<br />
Melissa now tried to to give Nolan a reassuring smile as she extended her hand. &quot;Why don&#39;t you come with me Nolan,&quot; she said warmly. &quot;I&#39;ll help you find your mom.&quot; Nolan was at first hesitant before reaching out and taking the girls hand. <br />
<br />
As Melissa now guided Nolan towards the elevator, she couldn&#39;t help but feel like a babysitter, which is probably what she looked like right now. As the two made their way towards the elevator the girl stumbled. Glancing at her heels, Melissa became alarmed. &quot;Damn it my heels are too big,&quot; she thought. &quot;I am getting younger. God I hope Ethan can fix this.&quot;<br />
<br />
Melissa, despite her growing anxiety, realized she need to remain calm. Right now a very scared 3 year old was looking to her for help. If she started freaking out about her regression who knows how the kid would react. Carefully stepping out of her heels, Melissa winced as she stared at her nylon covered feet. They were definitely smaller, the extra material hanging off her toes. Glancing at her chest she could see they appeared smaller inside her adult bra but she still at least appeared like a teenager. &quot;Great I can&#39;t be more than 13 or 14,&quot; she thought.<br />
<br />
Stepping onto the elevator with Nolan, Melissa hit the floor for Ethans lab. As the elevator now descended she anxiously looked between the numbers and Nolan. Already it felt like Nolan hand was growing in hers. It took her a moment but she realized it was the other way around, her hand was growing smaller as she grew younger. Glancing at her chest she could see her breasts slowly melting into her chest as she relived puberty in reverse.<br />
<br />
&quot;Twelve,&quot; she thought, trying to control her breathing. &quot;Eleven, damn it Ethan why is this happening!&quot; Melissa could see Nolan staring up at her with frightened eyes, she had to remain calm. &quot;Dont worry Nolan everything will be alright.&quot;<br />
<br />
Despite Melissa&#39;s reassuring words, she had her doubts. Her voice sounded so childish now, her skirt slipping on boyish hips. Melissa could tell she was shrinking, the elevator seeming to grow around her (along with Nolan). Still she had to remain calm, she didn&#39;t want Nolan to freakout.<br />
<br />
Melissa let out a small squeak as her skirt lost hold of hips, cascading down her pencil thing legs and pooling around her feet. As the girl stepped out of them, she noticed her nylons bunching around her legs, having stopped at her now knobby knees. Sighing she now shimmied out of her nylons, standing barefoot in the elevator next to Nolan.<br />
<br />
&quot;Damn it I can&#39;t be more than what nine? Ten?&quot;<br />
<br />
Meliss could see the muted appearance of a elementary school girl in the reflection of the elevator door. The girl was slightly taller than the preschooler standing next to her but instead of looking like Nolan babysitter she looked more like his big sister. &quot;Leta just hope I stay the big sister,&quot; she thought nervously.<br />
<br />
Melissa silently now tried to will the elevator to go faster, feeling herself grow a little smaller with each floor she passed. The 10 year old eventually shrinking down to 9, then 8, then 7. Melissa now stood a head taller than her preschool companion. &quot;Were almost there Nolan,&quot; she said, trying to reassure the frightened boy despite her chipmunk voice.<br />
<br />
As the elevator opened a now 6 year old Melissa stepped off with a 3 year old Nolan. Every part of Melissa wanted to scream, reduced to a child in an oversized blouse that was the only thing maintaining her modesty. Still, she needed to remain calm. She was better off than poor Nolan and right now he needed her. Hopefully the two of them could find Ethan and get this fixed.</p>
