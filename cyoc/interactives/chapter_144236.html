<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Daniel was babysitting his sister&#39;s four year old son at the local fair when the Endless Hall of Transformations caught young Robin&#39;s eye.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Can I see the mirrors? Please?  I need to see them&quot; he yelled.  This was the fourth ride he &#39;needed&#39; to see that day, but Daniel was happy to take him wherever he wanted to go.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Look, look&quot; Robin yelled as he ran past the gate and into one of the hallways.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey!  Get back here.  Don&#39;t make me tell your mother you misbehaved!&quot;  Daniel jogged in after Robin, not looking to see where he was going.  <br />
<br />
&quot;It makes your hair look longer!&quot;  Robin giggled and pointed at his reflection in one of the mirrors.  It was true, his hair did look longer, but Daniel could clearly see the difference in Robin&#39;s appearance without looking at the mirror.  Robin&#39;s short, one inch hair now looked two or three inches long.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Huh&quot; Daniel turned and noticed that his own reflection had longer hair as well.  He ran his hand through it to confirm. As he walked down the hallway, it felt like someone was gently pulled strands of hair out of his head.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Danny, look!  It gets longer and longer!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you...&quot; Daniel turned to see Robin jogging sideways down the hallway.  With each step, his hair grew longer and longer.  Daniel didn&#39;t know exactly what was happening, but he felt like the situation was no longer in his control and that made him uncomfortable. &quot;Please, wait a minute!&quot; <br />
<br />
Continuing to giggle at the sight of his reflection, Robin started to run down the hallway with his head turned to the mirrors.  Desperate to get his nephew back, Daniel ran after him.  It only took a few seconds for Daniel to realize that the hallway did more than grow your hair.  With each step, he felt an awkward growing weight pull his chest forward, his steady paces slowly becoming wobbly as his legs began to thin and his hips slowly shifted outward.  <br />
<br />
The changes in his body become too uncomfortable for Daniel to handle, so he stopped for a moment to catch his breath.  At the opposite end of the hallway, he watched as Robin walked through a door frame and proceeded out of sight.  &quot;Fuck&quot; Daniel whispered to himself, his voice now distinctly feminine. To his left, the mirror now showed the reflection of a beautiful blonde woman with perky C-cup breasts.  His plane green tee shirt had become a formfitting teal tank top and his shorts now tightly hugged his feminine waist.  Daniel, previously a tall, 6&#39; 2&#39;&#39; man, now appeared to be around 5&#39; tall, maybe a little shorter.  <br />
<br />
As infatuated as he was with his reflection, every movement of his body made him feel deeply uncomfortable.  The bouncing of his breasts made his nipples sore and his newly formed bra dug into the sides of his chest, pinching him slightly as he moved.  Under his now tight fitting shorts, he could feel sweat pulling in areas he didn&#39;t want to think about. He wanted to turn around and sprint back to the entrance but there was no way he could explain the disappearance of Robin to his sister.  <br />
<br />
As much as he hated the feel of his body, he had no choice.  He bit his lip and continued to run towards the end of the hallway.  With each step, he could feel his feminine features becoming more and more pronounced.  He closed his eyes and buried his feelings inside himself, he needed to get Robin.  When he knew he was just about at the door frame, he opened his eyes.  Maybe he could grab his nephew and make it back through the hallway before he was resigned to a life of skirts and periods.  <br />
<br />
The second his body passed through the door frame, everything around him changed.  He was no longer standing in a dimly lit fairground attraction, he was standing at the corner of a busy city intersection.  To his left, a young girl who looked distinctly like Robin smiled with excitement.  Both relieved and confused, Daniel grabbed Robin&#39;s hand and pulled his newly female nephew back through the door he just sprinted through.  Unfortunately, he didn&#39;t walk back into a mirrored hallway, he looked up see a group of people standing in line at a commercial coffee shop. <br />
<br />
Panicked, he ran to the walls and desperately hit them, hoping to find some kind of secret contraption that would let him back into the fair.  With each hit, he felt his new breasts bounce awkwardly underneath his shirt.  He was too late.  Robin pulled him all the way to the end of the hallway.  There was no more fair.  No more Hall of Mirrors.</p>
