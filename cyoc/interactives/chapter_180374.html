<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Wes looked down at his arms. He had always been kind of on the pale side. Blond hair, blue eyes, he had the whole northern European look down. Except now his skin was richly tanned. Now that he thought about it, Bryan had looked darker, too. Even darker than Wes. He shrugged a bit in Ross&#39; direction. &quot;You know how it is. Used to cover up a lot. Now I don&#39;t have anything to hide, just getting more sun, I guess.&quot; He rolled his shoulders and smirked.<br />
<br />
Ross seemed to get an idea. &quot;Coach!&quot; He called out, motioning for Wes to follow as he jogged a few steps over to where the teacher stood watching other students still running. Wes was surprised when he realized even with the extra laps he had finished ahead of some of his classmates. He watched the students tailing at the end. That&#39;s normally where Bryan and him would have been, side by side, grousing about PE class. He rubbed his chin, trying to think if he had done anything to piss off his friend.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mind if Wes works out with the team today?&quot; Ross&#39; words brought Wes back. &quot;I think he needs some specialized attention.&quot;<br />
<br />
The coach looked the pair over. &quot;Little late in the season to be recruiting, Jansen.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not, just think he&#39;d be better off lifting with guys that can spot him.&quot; Ross reached out and wrapped and arm around Wes&#39; bicep. &quot;I mean, you want Russel being his spotter?&quot; Ross joked.<br />
<br />
Coach looked over to the lanky Russel then to Wes and Ross. &quot;Fine. Don&#39;t let him distract you guys from your goals. If it works out we&#39;ll move him onto the special plan. You&#39;ll have to tell me what you&#39;ve been doing Wes, getting so big and not being on any sports. I don&#39;t tolerate any cheating from my guys, understand me? We do things with hard work.&quot; Coach puffed himself up to his full size, which was substantial. He wasn&#39;t one of those guys who had let himself go as he got older. He prided himself on being able to still outmuscle most of the team, except maybe for Ross.<br />
<br />
Wes blinked, dumbfounded. Until Ross whispered to him. &quot;He means no &#39;roids.&quot;<br />
<br />
Wes quickly shook his head. &quot;Oh, no, sir.. coach. Just exercise and a late growth spurt.&quot; He sputtered, hoping he sounded natural. Admitting the wish machine was helping things might go over weird.<br />
<br />
&quot;Too bad you didn&#39;t have your growth spurt last year. I could have used you on the defensive line this year.&quot; Coach looked contemplative. &quot;Might still be time. Anyway, go on and show him the ropes, Ross.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Coach.&quot; Ross motioned for Wes to follow. The sports teams had their own weight room with more equipment and heavier weights than the one open to the rest of the school. Most of the other jocks were already there, partnered off and going through their work out. Wes seemed to be Ross&#39; partner for the day. They went through the routine, Ross seeming curious and skeptical every time Wes didn&#39;t know how to do a certain work out, or what his limits were, or even how much he could bench. But they went through everything, taking turns.<br />
<br />
Ross was also very touchy through the whole thing. Explaining muscle groups by running his hand on Wes, showing him where they were, or giving the workout pumped muscles an appreciative squeeze. Wes spent the whole period with his cock in a perilous half-hard state, making an obvious tent in his shorts that everyone just seemed to conveniently not notice. Some of the other jocks offered encouragement and one even seemed to be flirting. It was different than the way the girls were swooning over him. Them he wanted to show off for, strut around, and be the big alpha dog. For these guys it was harder to explain. It was comradery, Wes found himself missing Bryan, it felt like he should be here with them.<br />
<br />
Wes sat on one of the benches in the locker room, cooling off. His towel draped over his head. He had never had a work out like that before in his life, and it felt amazing. He hurt, but he also felt like he could run out an fight a bear or something. But he was also still working on the Bryan problem. What was going on between them? He knew what the plan was, but Bryan seemed to be the first one to break from it.<br />
<br />
He felt a hand on his cock. His head shot up, but a pair of lips were soon pressed against his for a moment, eager and hungry. &quot;Where were we?&quot; Came Ross&#39; baritone voice. Wes looked around the locker room quickly, they were the last two there. Ross fished in Wes&#39; shorts and pulled out his cock, sports calloused hand running up and down the shaft. &quot;For a white boy you got a pretty dark cock.&quot; Ross teased.<br />
<br />
Wes barely registered how tan all of him was getting, cock included. He was lost in having a guy jerk him off. Again. &quot;What about Diego?&quot; Wes found himself asking.<br />
<br />
&quot;Couldn&#39;t make it, told me to enjoy myself.&quot; Even with Ross jerking him off Wes found his thoughts drifting to Bryan, about what they had done last night. It&#39;s not like they were dating, not like Ross and Diego. But something inside Wes suddenly felt.. off. He heard his cell phone ding in his locker. Only one person would be texting him right now.<br />
<br />
Wes pulled away from Ross and opened his locker to grab his phone. his rigid cock sticking out in front of him, dribbling pre. &quot;Um..&quot; He was trying to think through things but his thoughts were slipping away. It was from Bryan, asking to meet him after school. He looked over to Ross who sat on the bench looking amused.<br />
<br />
&quot;Gonna tell me what&#39;s up?&quot; Ross luckily didn&#39;t look insulted. &quot;I thought you wanted to fuck?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I do. Fuck I want to, but, I um.. Bryan.&quot; Why were Wes&#39; thoughts suddenly a jumble.<br />
<br />
&quot;Better tell him that before someone snatches him up.&quot; Ross said with a grin as he stood.<br />
<br />
&quot;No! I don&#39;t mean I want to fuck Bry..&quot; Then Wes stopped. No. He did. He definitely, certainly did want to fuck his best friend, make him scream his name as they screwed each other, sweaty muscular bodies rubbing up against one another, mouths pressed together. His cock gave a twitch.<br />
<br />
Ross was just grinning, knowingly. &quot;Well, when you two get that sorted out, look up me and Diego. God damn, that will be one fucking hot foursome.&quot; Ross adjusted himself in his pants just thinking about it. He stood up and tucked Wes&#39; cock away for him, since the other senior still seemed a little confused. &quot;Don&#39;t wait too long. I head Mandy Sanders was going to try to corner him tomorrow.&quot;</p>
