<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You looked over to Luna as she seemed to be thinking over things, and to a great degree, it was also something you were interested in hearing about. For there were a lot of things that would be coming up that were big. Summer work for you and Luna was among them, but to a degree that would be relatively easy and wouldn&#39;t be something that you or her could rush into until after the full moon ended and tonight was the last full moon night for the month. The wedding was another of those things and would have some more immediate issues, mostly due to scheduling. Even if the wedding wouldn&#39;t be happening until later in the summer, though still before when Luna&#39;s pregnancy would become visible, it would still take time to get in contact with those that would be involved and getting the venue scheduled and to a degree there would all take some time and coordination.<br />
<br />
A part of you was also still caught up in the very &quot;lovey-dovey&quot; phase of the relationship with Luna. For while becoming MILF-wolves had aged Luna into looking like she was in her thirties and done the same for you in addition to flipping your gender from male to female, there was still the fact that both of you were only eighteen. Learning that Luna had felt the same way about you as you had felt about her over the years of friendship the two of you had was something that had you excited in many ways and left you eager to explore a lot of those sorts of things. That made discussing the wedding relatively pleasant and finding your dad not only approving it but being a positive participant added to it, though you were also aware that you&#39;d all probably have to keep things away from politics or any tangential issue to them.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m actually not sure,&quot; Luna said slowly, &quot;I mean... with a small wedding being limited to a justice of the peace and a brief exchange of vows, it&#39;s not like this is going to be a long wedding and one that would need  a lot of music during the ceremony. And the guest list is likely to be rather small. Just us, our families, likely members of mom and &quot;dad&#39;s&quot; pack, both MILF-wolves and regular werewolves...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What about some other friends of yours?&quot; your father asked, &quot;surely my son wasn&#39;t the only friend you had.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve had other friends, though the issue has been more that many of them probably aren&#39;t aware that I was born a MILF-wolf and most weren&#39;t exactly fond of Nick,&quot; Luna explained, &quot;which would mean they might not expect me to be me. They&#39;d thus assume that some strange middle aged woman is addressing them as though they went to high school together, not realizing that as a MILF-wolf, once I turned eighteen... it would be likely that I&#39;d soon look like I was middle aged.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Surely you&#39;d be able to convince them...&quot; your father said slowly, his voice sounding more puzzled.<br />
<br />
You supposed that made sense, as it would relate to how you were able to convince him that you were his son transformed by relaying the feelings and impressions that both of you had shared when your birth mother died. Though you also knew that sort of thing would probably be easy for Luna to prove to her friends.<br />
<br />
&quot;She can,&quot; Roxie said to him, &quot;the worry is going to be more that once they realize that Luna is who she says she is... they&#39;re going to wonder why she, as the first thing she did as a MILF-wolf, was to have sex with someone they didn&#39;t like.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My son was never a bad boy,&quot; your father said defensively, &quot;he may not have been the all star athlete and he may not be the next Einstein... but he&#39;s been kind and responsible. He&#39;s broken no laws and he&#39;s put up with a lot my temper over the years, and the two of them always seemed to get a long when your daughter came to visit Nick at my house.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And Nick was also the only boy who interacted with me in a way that wasn&#39;t an obvious attempt to get in my pants,&quot; Luna added, &quot;and that was really a part of what lead me to falling in love with him... even if I was to afraid to act on it. Finding out he felt the same way about me made me very happy, and if he hadn&#39;t been transgender... I would have done my best to get him in contact with a mundane werewolf and then we could live together. Him as a werewolf and me as a MILF-wolf. But he was transgender, and thus I gave him what he wanted... femininity... and we both got each other and a future family for us to raise.&quot;<br />
<br />
You watched as Luna smiled and then sighed for a moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;But many of the girls I was friends with in high school...&quot; Luna said slowly, &quot;while they aren&#39;t bad people they came from the parts of high school that saw themselves as popular, athletic and fun and thus saw Nick not being a jock as something to look down on. And a few called him a &quot;nerd&quot; at times...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Despite the fact that most of them got better grades than I did,&quot; you commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;Which means I&#39;m not sure on how they&#39;d respond to the fact that it would be Nick/Nicki that I&#39;m marrying,&quot; Luna finished, &quot;and that&#39;ll be something else to handle... if they respond well and see that they were wrong about Nick... or at least see Nicki as how wonderful she is, they might be there. If not... I&#39;ll be very upset that I picked such a bad group of friends.&quot;<br />
<br />
You again took Luna&#39;s hand and gently massaged it with your own hands. It brought a smile to Luna&#39;s face and she took a deep breath before continuing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Though, even if all my friends come... the guest list at the wedding isn&#39;t going to be a big event,&quot; Luna spoke, &quot;so we may not have the time for the traditional wedding march or some other big romantic song. And bringing in a band might just be a bit over the top. It&#39;s where I really just don&#39;t know on what to do.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wouldn&#39;t there be something short you could play at the wedding?&quot; Kellie wondered, &quot;I mean, we could set up a CD player pretty easily there... as I think the pavilion has an outlet, and if not, the sets we have use batteries as well. We could play a relatively short song if that&#39;s what you want.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Something short would work for the wedding,&quot; Luna agreed, &quot;but I&#39;m not sure on what song to use. Most of those that I know and like are rather peppy pop songs that probably wouldn&#39;t work well for a wedding.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s yours and Nicki&#39;s wedding, dear,&quot; Kellie said to Luna, &quot;that&#39;s all up to you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And I agree,&quot; Luna nodded, &quot;but I just don&#39;t want it the ceremony to be noted for cheesy music,&quot; Luna answered, &quot;I mean we have the CD from your wedding... which I used to help teach Nicki on how to dance...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Most of that was from the reception, though,&quot; Roxie commented, &quot;the music from the actual wedding was pretty traditional... as I was still male then and the church we had the wedding at probably wasn&#39;t going to go for rock music.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Or jazz,&quot; Kellie chuckled, &quot;but that&#39;s where some of the music option will come into play. Not just the wedding but the reception afterward. As I&#39;d assume you and Nicki would want to celebrate the wedding afterward.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A part of me wants to just celebrate Luna every day,&quot; you commented, earning laughter from Luna&#39;s parents and your father. You heard &quot;young love&quot; get whispered from all of them. Luna gave a playful giggle and squeezed your hand in hers.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... the reception music could be easy,&quot; Luna commented, &quot;I have a couple of CDs that have some more modern love songs there and I like them. The reception could then mix and match them. Some of the new stuff for me and Nicki and some of the older songs from your wedding for the guests, as most of the guests would be older than Nicki and I.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;As we look older than we are,&quot; you joked to Luna who nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;d still leave us with the what to do when I come down the aisle,&quot; Luna sighed, &quot;on which I really don&#39;t know... given that the aisle won&#39;t be all that long and won&#39;t be in a church.&quot;<br />
<br />
She paused to look to her parents, Kellie and Roxie, and to your father, and then finally to you.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you guys have any ideas on what to play for the entry?&quot; Luna asked, &quot;it&#39;d at least give me some ideas on what to go with. Something short and sweat would be preferred.&quot;</p>
