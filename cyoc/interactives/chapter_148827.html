<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Melissa moved back to the cow toy, but before she could pull out the knife, her chest bulged forward.  &quot;What the...?!&quot;  She looked down to her chest, and realized her breasts had grown noticeably over a few seconds.  Where they had comfortably fit before, the twin orbs now strained against the confinement of her bra.  A similar pulse was felt through her body again, and her bra snapped within her now-taut shirt as her breasts bulged a second time.  &quot;Oh no!&quot;<br />
<br />
She frantically grabbed the cow toy and tore the knife out of it, hoping it would stop its mooing.  The noise began to dim, but as she waited, she felt her spine elongate and a tail tear through her undergarments, snaking down her pants and tickling the back of her leg, just above the ankle.  Worse yet, the toy began a strange reverse-mooing sound now that the blade had been pulled out. and she felt a sickening twist within her gut.<br />
<br />
Melissa pulled herself toward her stove as her gut slowly began to push outward and downward.  Before she could reach it, she tripped to the floor and her feet twisted into hooves mid-step.  Determined to end this now, she rose back up on shaky hooves, and grabbed the stove&#39;s ingition.<br />
<br />
Frantic with stopping this, she twisted too far, and the stove stopped trying to ignite.  Each precious second she made a mistake, she could feel her gut pull out further.  &quot;Damnit!&quot;  Every second the ignition failed to spark the fuel was agony.  Horns began to push out of her head, but Melissa was too focused on finishing her work before she lost her mind.<br />
<br />
Finally, the fire lit, and Melissa shoved the toy onto it.  Melissa didn&#39;t care about what kind of damage the stove would sustain, as long as it ended as a pile of ash and melted plastic.  The cheap material and fluff quickly caught, but the moo still continued, growing more distorted and warbling.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, Melissa felt a new pressure from her chest, just above her gut.  New flesh began to bubble into existence as she pulled her body away from the stove, concerned that she might fall chest-first into an open flame.  She rapidly took a seat on the couch to assess the extent of the damage, and subsequent hope that it reversed once the toy was destroyed.  <br />
<br />
She could barely squeeze out of her shirt, which was concerning since she&#39;d always preferred baggy shirts.  She couldn&#39;t see through her breasts, and so she began to explore with her hands.  Her new breasts were absolutely massive, based on how much time it took to rub them over.  As she&#39;d feared, there was absolutely a cow udder handing between her legs.  With another pulse, her entire ensemble grew to even more inhuman proportion, but something was wrong toward her middle.<br />
<br />
Guiding her hands slowly upward, Melissa realized she now had a second set of breasts!  They were precariously positioned between her natural breasts and this massive udder, and they seemed to be rapidly catching up with her original pair.  Audrey didn&#39;t have 4 breasts!  What was happening?!<br />
<br />
Her legs were even more deformed than Audrey&#39;s, as well.  While Audrey merely had hooves, Melissa now sported digitigrade legs in a clear black-and-white pattern.  Fortunately or otherwise, she noted her legs were far more muscular and her hips were wider, which was probably the only thing allowing her to move with as much breastflesh as she had.  Her pants had unfortunately not survived the process.<br />
<br />
It was around this point that the mooing finally stopped.  Melissa turned to look at the charred remains, her eyes full of hate.  &quot;Damned thing.&quot;<br />
<br />
As if in response, the remains briefly glowed, the blasted a blinding light throughout the room.  Melissa waited for everything to go back to normal, but blanched in horror as her body seemed to get even worse.  Her udder bulged outward with newfound growth, the bulk of its mass now easily hanging past her knees even as she sat.  It pressed painfully into her four breasts, which had now grown deformed.  In a matter of moments, the nipples of her breasts elongated into what Melissa assumed were more cow teats, based on how little milk was being released from them.  <br />
<br />
The fur on her legs climbed up her body, covering everything but her breasts.  As the fur reached her hands, they deformed into hoof-like appendages, similar to what Audrey had.  What&#39;s worse, Melissa&#39;s face began to contort as bone fought with bone to achieve a new shape.  It was by far the most painful experience of the transformation so far.  What took less than a minute felt like an hour, as her face pulled out into a snout, or a muzzle.  Her teeth and tongue followed suit, becoming wide and flat, taking with them any semblance of humanity. <br />
 She opened her mouth to say something, but she couldn&#39;t figure out her new mouth at all.  All that came out was a weird lowing that only had the tiniest relation to actual words.  <br />
<br />
As she stood up, she nearly touched the ceiling.  Her body had clearly grown once more, but she hadn&#39;t noticed since her mammoth breasts had grown with her.  Even with her new size, she felt the terrible weight of her tits and udder pulling on her frame.<br />
<br />
Melissa had always been the shoulder to cry on and the strong friend of her group, but her very core was rattled by this transformation.  She had truly gotten herself into something deep.  With unintentionally heavy steps, she heaved her way to the stove.  There was no trace of the cow toy, so she turned of the fire.<br />
<br />
She tried to sit in one of the smaller chairs near the table, but her giant rear snapped it like a twig, causing a loud thump to resonate through the room.  Melissa didn&#39;t try to stand, but rather put her hands to her face and tried to silently weep.  As she did so, she tried to count her blessings.  Her mind was still hers.  She&#39;d never need to buy milk again.  She could probably snap a cat-caller in half.  Audrey won&#39;t look nearly as bad next to her...!<br />
<br />
Audrey!  Melissa collected herself as best she could.  She had to put a strong face on for Audrey.  Unless Audrey was now a mindless human-cow again, or even worse off than before.  She dried her tears with a furred arm, then got off of the chair&#39;s remains.  She stood in silence, looking at her bedroom and trying to think of what to say.  Then she realized she couldn&#39;t actually say anything, right now.  Hopefully, Audrey was fast asleep and Melissa had some time to practice talking before she needed to confront-<br />
<br />
The door to her bedroom slammed open, with a completely human Audrey on the other side, albeit wearing an overlarge T-shirt across her small frame.  &quot;Melissa, you did it!  You-&quot;  her words stopped dead in her throat as Audrey realized what had happened to Melissa.  The blood drained from her face as she took in the entirety of Melissa&#39;s form.  &quot;Oh no.&quot;</p>
