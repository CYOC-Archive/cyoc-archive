<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It seemed like ages since her udder had been stuck in that fence. It had also become hypersensitive to even the slightest touch. That&#39;s how much milk was in her udder. She regretted the decision of turning into a full cow. <br />
<br />
She could feel her udder trying to expand, but the fencepost kept it there like a prisoner in a jail cell. when her udder tried to produce milk, excess milk had to get out of her teats constantly. KAT was moaning constantly because there was so much milk, she couldn&#39;t handle it.<br />
<br />
She waited there for another half an hour until finally, he heard Dan&#39;s voice calling to her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dan! oh thank god you&#39;re here!&quot; exclaimed Kat<br />
<br />
&quot;Woah, what the fuck happened?&quot; asked Dan.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s a long story, I tried to jump over the fence, but my udder got caught and...yeah.&quot; Kat explained<br />
<br />
&quot;Looks like it&#39;s getting big.&quot; Said Dan. &quot;And tight!&quot; <br />
<br />
Dan noticed that her udder had gained size from not being milked at all in the past hour.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow, your udder is a milk producing machine!! He said.<br />
<br />
Kate blushed. &quot;Yeah, it&#39;s so sensitive too. It&#39;s so full that even the milk exiting my teats sends shivers up my spine.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now can we please stop talking and get me outta here! my udder is achi-&quot; <br />
<br />
Just then, Dan preceded to continuously poke Kat&#39;s udder to see how she would react. She mood loudly as her udder staked and wobbled, and bursts milk came spurting out. <br />
<br />
&quot;MOOOOOOooOOOOooooOOOOOOoh god, oh god, oh god!! Dan stop!!&quot; Kat shouted<br />
<br />
&quot;Woah, that thing is filled to the brim!&quot; exclaimed Dan.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dan,&quot; she said, still panting &quot;Get me out of here, NOW!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Please, My udder hurts so bad&quot;. she said<br />
<br />
&quot;ok, I will&quot; replied Dan<br />
<br />
Dan grabbed her udder, pushing it up the fence. Kat moaned when milk leaked out of her teats. The more milk inside her udder, the more pleasure she felt when milk was released.<br />
<br />
Kat pushed her legs to help heave her udder over the fence. Kat&#39;s udder leaked liters of milk, and she almost had an orgasm through all the pleasure and pressure. <br />
<br />
Dan kept pushing her udder, and Kat kept moaning. Her moans were practically moos now and Dan was a little creeped out of it, but kept pushing.<br />
<br />
And then finally, her udder was free. Free from that wooden prison.<br />
<br />
Kat was panting and mooing for a few moments after that, then she stopped.<br />
<br />
&quot;*pant* Thank *pant* you *pant* Dan.&quot; Kat said &quot;I should&#39;ve listened to you about the milk draining spell, cause this was a nightmare!&quot;<br />
<br />
Kat&#39;s pussy was wet as could be, and it was exposed so it shivered in the cool, afternoon air. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, uh huh.&quot; said Dan &quot;Anyways, I didn&#39;t find a bucket, but I DID find a milking machine!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Great! Finally! My udder is so painful!&quot; She exclaimed. &quot;So, where is it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;In there.&quot; Dan pointed towards the building where the farmworkers were herding the cows. <br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, what?&quot; she asked. &quot;I thought we were supposed to be unseen! How are we going to go inside together?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s why you&#39;re going in without me.&quot; Dan replied<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait what? isn&#39;t there a spare milking machine somewhere or, like, something!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nope,&quot; He said. &quot;That seems to be the main are where they are milked. I think that&#39;s your only option.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kat hesitated, and decided that Dan was right.<br />
<br />
&quot;I should have never chose to be a cow.&quot; said Kat, and then she started walking inside the building.<br />
<br />
As Kat enters the milking area, she sees people fastening cows to their designated milking area. She was the last to get a milking area, and when it was her turn to get milked, a worker guided her to one of the vacant milking areas.<br />
<br />
She stood there anxiously, not knowing what would come next. Then one of the workers spread cream on her udder . Kat tried not to moan, but ended up just quietly mooing from the pleasure of being touched. The worker said, &quot;Damn, this cow has one large-ass udder&quot; and then he squished Kat&#39;s udder. Kat moo&#39;d loudly as all four teats spurted out some milk. <br />
<br />
&quot;Woah,&quot; said the worker. &quot;You&#39;re udder must be very sensitive.&quot; He then preceded to inspect her udder, grabbing her teats and rubbed it to see Kat&#39;s reaction to it. Again, it was so sensitive that milk came out. &quot;MOOooOO&quot; said Kat. &#120337;&#120374;&#120372;&#120373; &#120360;&#120358;&#120373; &#120368;&#120367; &#120376;&#120362;&#120373;&#120361; &#120366;&#120362;&#120365;&#120364;&#120362;&#120367;&#120360; &#120366;&#120358;!!!<br />
<br />
&quot;Damn, you a weird ass cow&quot; said the worker as he attached the milking cups to her teats.<br />
<br />
Kat yelped and felt the coldness of the metal cups on her teats. They were somewhat heavy, and so it slightly pulled her teats, causing them to drip milk. &#120342;&#120361;, &#120360;&#120368;&#120357; She thought. Her udder shaked and shivered from the pleasure.<br />
<br />
Then finally, the machine turned on, and then her teats spurted out tons of milk in just seconds. &#120342;&#120335;, &#120342;&#120335; &#120334;&#120342;&#120331;, &#120336;&#120347; &#120333;&#120332;&#120332;&#120339;&#120346; &#120346;&#120342; &#120334;&#120342;&#120342;&#120342;&#120342;&#120342;&#120342;&#120342;&#120342;&#120342;&#120342;&#120331;. As the milk was gushing out of her udder, she felt her vagina get wet again. Then, her udder went into overdrive with the milk production. her udder started to get tight again, but she didn&#39;t notice because she was mooing very loudly. a few minutes of mooing later, she calmed down a little. She was still in so much pleasure, but she could still think somewhat properly. That&#39;s when she realized that he udder was getting tight again. She wanted to panic, but couldn&#39;t cause she was in too much ecstasy. <br />
<br />
She sat there for a few more hours, her udder being milked. Finally, her milk production died down, and she could actually feel it being drained. That&#39;s when the head farmer came in to inspect his cows. Kat was still mooing loudly, which caught the attention of the farmer. <br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s this now?&quot; he asked. <br />
<br />
When Kat noticed him, she was embarrassed but still preceded to moo loudly. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, that&#39;s a mighty fine udder you have there.&quot; he said. He then knelt down and rubbed her udder.<br />
<br />
This sent even more waves of pleasure to her and moo&#39;d even louder.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh you like that?&quot; he asked &quot;Well why didn&#39;t you say so?&quot;<br />
<br />
He then began to play with her udder. Poking it, squeezing it, jiggling it. All of that made Kat&#39;s milk flow speed increase and so, she moo&#39;d the loudest as she could both from the pleasure of her teats gushing out several quarts of milk per second, and the farmer poking and prodding at her udder. <br />
<br />
When her udder was completely empty, the farmer remover the teat cups, which made Kat moo, and slapped her udder. At this point, even a slight touch of a fly would make her orgasm.<br />
<br />
&quot;MOO MOO MOO MOO&quot; Is all Kat could say.<br />
<br />
When she went outside to the fields, She could see Dan. She then ran up to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dan!&quot; yelled Kat.<br />
<br />
&quot;I could see that you udder is *finally* empty. What took so long!?&quot; he exclaimed. &quot;I was here for hours!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The milking was SOOOOOO good!&quot; she said<br />
<br />
Dan went behind her and stroked her udder<br />
<br />
&quot;Ohhh god, Dan ohhh.&quot; her udder was so sensitive that she cummed on Dan&#39;s face.<br />
<br />
SPLAT!<br />
<br />
&quot;EWWWW, oh my god!&quot; Shouted Dan. &quot;What the FUCK!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry, it&#39;s just, i&#39;ve been milked for 3 hours STRAIGHT, of course it&#39;s going to build in sensitivity!&quot; she explained. &quot;Even with slight touches or being moved will make me moo.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dan rubbed his face on the grass to remove the cum.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can I have the book now? I can feel milk begin to fill in my udder, and I don&#39;t want to have to do that TWICE.&quot; Kat said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, here.&quot; Dan then picks up the book and sets it near Kat. Kat flipped through to the page where she turned into a cow.<br />
<br />
Then she said the chant of the reversion spell.<br />
<br />
She could feel her body shrink. Her hooves splicing and turning into fingers. her tail going back into her spine. Her ears shorten. Her torso begins to shrink. Her breasts come back. Her hips readjust. And her head shortens.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uhhh, Kat?&quot; asked Dan.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, what?&quot; Kat replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;You have uh.....four breasts.&quot; said Dan<br />
<br />
&quot;WHAT&quot; said Kat.<br />
<br />
Kat looked at her breasts and saw she had in fact four breasts. She also notices that her breasts are larger than usual. the top pair are E cups while the bottom pair are D cups, not as big, but still very large.<br />
<br />
&quot;How is this possible?&quot; Dan asks.<br />
<br />
&quot;It might be a side effect of being a cow for too long.&quot; Kat replies. <br />
<br />
Kat begins to touch the second pair of breasts, then moans. <br />
<br />
&quot;OOOOOOOHh shit!&quot; She shouts. &quot;They are sensitive too! but, not as sensitive as my udder.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What are we gonna do?&quot; asks Kat.<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess we just tell mom.&quot; Dan replies. &quot;Also, put on some clothes! You&#39;re not a cow anymore, so no fur!&quot; <br />
<br />
Kat summons clothes with a spell and teleports them back to their house.<br />
<br />
THE END?</p>
