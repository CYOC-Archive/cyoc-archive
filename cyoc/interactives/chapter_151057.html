<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Matt had been having an incredibly difficult time out on the field. Thoughts of the other guys topping him just kept going through his mind. It didn&#39;t matter that all they were doing was playing touch football for practice, the fact that they were touching him at all was enough to get him aroused and thinking about something he&#39;d never thought about before. One of the coach&#39;s could tell he was distracted and told him to go take a shower. <br />
<br />
&quot;Coach Carson?&quot; he stood in the door to the shower room. Seeing the giant man showering was exactly the kind of thing he was trying to avoid. The towel he was wearing wouldn&#39;t have been enough to hide the growing erection and he was worried what the other coach might think.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh hey Matt,&quot; Coach Carson was acting so casual as he stood there naked. It was rather normal for the guys to shower together but not so common when their dicks were hard. And seeing Coach Carson&#39;s so blatantly erect was a bit surprising as well. &quot;What&#39;s up? Practice shouldn&#39;t be over yet.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It isn&#39;t...&quot; Matt replied. He tried to make sure his mouth wasn&#39;t hanging open for too long as he looked at the giant standing before him. At 6&#39;2&quot; there weren&#39;t many people taller than him. Then again at 6&#39;8&quot; there weren&#39;t many people as tall as Coach Carson. The giant of a man was a perfect specimen of size and strength and despite being about ten years older than the team, could easily keep up with each and every one of them. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh?&quot; Coach Carson looked at him confused. &quot;Then why are you down here?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uhhh... I was having a bit of an off day...&quot; Matt averted his eyes. He was having too much trouble concentrating on the wall of mass in front of him. Each time the coach locked eyes with him, he could feel his dick throb with anticipation. Seeing his massive cock pointing directly at him was also filling him with unknown ideas. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh? Is there a reason for this off day?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No!&quot; Matt answered a bit too quickly. The cocky grin on his coach&#39;s face was enough to tell him that. &quot;I mean no. Nothing&#39;s wrong.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Is that so?&quot; Coach Carson was slowly making his way across the empty showers. His big feet took careful but calculated steps. &quot;Because I am you&#39;re coach after all. If  there&#39;s something bothering you, I need to know about it. We need to have a bond to really be able to work together. Don&#39;t you agree?&quot;<br />
<br />
Matt found his head nodding as Coach Carson stood over him. The six inches of difference suddenly felt bigger than he could have ever imagined. The strong man easily towered over him and his thick hand on Matt&#39;s shoulder was an odd comfort. &quot;Good. But I need to know if there&#39;s anything wrong...&quot; Coach Carson continued. <br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s just...&quot; Matt cut himself off, still feeling uncomfortable about the feelings he was having. He&#39;d never thought of himself as a homophobe but at the same time he wasn&#39;t the one ever having to act on them. Never did it cross his mind what it was like to be surrounded by dicks but unable to interact with them. That it was somehow strange of him to want to interact with them. <br />
<br />
The sudden trail of thought made him forget where he was and the towel dropped around to his feet. His cock sprang forward pointing directly at his coach. &quot;It&#39;s not what it looks like!&quot; his face flushed red as he tried backing out of the locker room. <br />
<br />
Coach Carson caught him by the shoulder and pulled him in close. &quot;It&#39;s okay,&quot; he soothed. &quot;I kind of figured. You don&#39;t need to fight it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But... But... But...&quot; Matt stuttered as he felt the firm muscles of the coach holding him closely. He could hear Carson&#39;s heart beating slowly and controlled while Matt&#39;s was running a mile a minute. Every part of his conscious mind was telling him to flee but his body found comfort in his coach&#39;s embrace.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s okay,&quot; Coach Carson said again. &quot;You&#39;re safe. I&#39;m your coach. You can trust me.&quot; Matt pulled away to look at his coach in the eyes. There was a softness that invited him in. He started to lose his train of thought. What was he afraid of? His cock throbbed again. &quot;Good,&quot; Carson ran his hand through the athlete&#39;s short hair. &quot;Do you trust me?&quot;<br />
<br />
Matt pulled slightly away. Something deep in his subconscious was telling him to walk away but he found his head nodding. &quot;Ye-yes,&quot; he stammered. &quot;I trust you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good boy,&quot; Coach Carson smiled as he pushed Matt against the wall. He easily took control over the jock. His body thrust against Matt&#39;s and his dick pushed up against the other man&#39;s asshole. &quot;That&#39;s a good boy,&quot; Coach Carson ran held onto Matt&#39;s body tightly as he pushed a little more in. His lips kissed the side of Matt&#39;s neck. Then went in for a love bite.<br />
<br />
Matt let out a heavy grunt. Each inch that his coach pushed in filled him with in insane amount of pleasure. The warm nature of the cock felt so much better than the cold plastic from the previous night. His muscular body seemed to have gone weak as the coach pushed harder into him, filling him completely up. Matt&#39;s face scrapped against the wall as he begged, &quot;more.&quot;<br />
<br />
Coach Carson was more than happy to comply as he thrust again. His cock was surrounded. He felt his mind going over as he continued to ride the athlete. Then all at once he burst. His cock unloaded into Matt&#39;s ass. &quot;Aww fuck,&quot; he growled in Matt&#39;s ear. The sensation had taken over as he gave in more and more. As his cock shrank he pulled back out of the athlete, seeing the mess plastered against the wall that Matt had made. He leaned in for a hug, rounding his back. &quot;Aren&#39;t you glad you trusted me?&quot;</p>
