<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff takes a deep breath...<br />
It's spinns around for a while, the twenty sides that affects his transformation spinns around. He look at the screen and at the dice. It made a halt. <br />
<br />
Number one.<br />
There was no regret, he slided down the options of all the furries he could have chosen from and found it quite instantly. A wolf morph appeared in the Chronivacs window as he held the cursor over it, and then he double clicked. The small window became black and resized and took then whole screen, and then it reappeared. He could see the fur, gray as default with white spots and a shaggy pelt and a long tail that he couldn't wait to get one himself. A bar from the left slided into picture with options at the left of the wolf morph.<br />
He swallowed hard and tried to say something, but then he became silent. It was there, everything. The options included fur colour, tail, long or small, tufty or slender. He moved his cursor over the Transformation progress window, that only contained transformation time and when. It even had a timer for transformations! He went back to the appearance options and looked around some more. Length, height, stance, mane, ears, paws and claws, teeth and jaw. Claw colour, nose darkness, thickness of the pelt, muscle mass, fur lenght, cock lenght and thickness of it, balls and it even had eye colour! Then he saw some things to tick of, &quot;pleasurable transformation&quot;...he ticked 'yes'... &quot;sexually aroused (recommended for over 18)&quot;...he hesitated, he didn't want it to become a sex show, who knew what would happen if he couldn't control himself. &quot;Don't remember transformation after reset (warning: loose memory of whole period of transformation)&quot;, no, definetly no, why would anyone want to forget? &quot;Multiple transformations in area&quot;. He could imagine that his sister didn't want to become a morph...&quot;Remain human penis/vagina&quot;...He thought about that...but it was his first time, it was to experiment to 100%...so he didn't check that one. Then he edited the fur colour, he made it dark gray with a stocky body and thick fur, a long mane and a tufty tail and massive paws. He looked at the window. He looked at the hidden sheath. He raised the size, and then he looked at the transformation time. Five minutes...nah...ten at least...he wanted it to last. He checked everything over again, especially the gender because he didn't want to make anything drastic in his first transformation. He rolled his chair back, and leaned backward and held his hands behind his head. He breathed hard. The 'enter' button waited...He looked one more time at the screen. He pressed the key.<br />
<br />
<br />
He stood up again. Something inside him churned, and he felt hot. What had he turned the wolf morphs age too? Was it middle age? He sat back, on the chair, but stood up quickly again. Something on his ass hurt a bit, like a bad bruise or something. He walked to the door, made sure it was locked and then returned to the middle of the room and started walking around, feeling somewhat jumpy and tense. He looked at the lamp, stretching his back and then he noticed one thing. He was taller. &quot;It worked!&quot; He almost screamed out, but then he lowered his voice on the last word. His sister was still at home...He didn't care about that a second later, he felt how something in his pants grow. He took of his shirt and looked at himself. He looked a bit more muscular, and his throat had grown a bit. &quot;Ten minutes...how am I supposed to wait in ten minutes?&quot; He walked around a few steps and he felt warmer than he had ever felt before. His face had grown a bit mor masculine, and his hair had gotten a slight discolouration with dark gray. Something tickled in his pants again, and the pain in his ass had gone away with a numbness that felt quite nice actually. His pants had started to bulge, he looked down and saw a bigger cock pushing the underwear from inside. Jeff touched his hair, it was more gray now, and it had started to grow down his neck. He walked to the mirror and looked at his reflection, which looked awfully different. He could see that his teeth were a bit sharper. He started to think about those bad werewolf movies with plastic teet and started to laugh. But it sounded much lower. &quot;Haha...cool...&quot; His voice was deep and dark, he sounded really masculine, or so he thought at least. His muscles was bigger, and he couldn't stop himself from flexing his muscles, when he saw something weird. On his stomach, a thin treasure trail grew, gray and thick hairs that slowly grew to his navel. He touched the hair with his hands, it felt awfully pleasurable actually...he started to touch himself everywhere, his cock raised itself and oushed his jeans tighter just like his growing legs did already. He saw how his chest beefed out a bit, then how he grew a little longer again. He said with his rumbling deep voice, that began to sound like a low growl, &quot;I think I better get of those clothes soon..&quot; <br />
He touched his neck, that had grown thicker and his hair had grown further down on his back, and a black stubble had grown thick on his chin and cheek, and whiskers that connected to his hair. In the reflection, he saw how his muscular arms had grown a light layer of hair, and his lower arms more. His hands had thickened and black hairs grew over his knuckles like in a sweep. He looked at his arms, and then he started to unbuckle his belt, that went up quite easily by the pressure his bigger body gave it. His feet had grown bigger, like the rest of his legs, that had grown a thick layer of hair in gray and his thighs thickened while he rubbed his pubic hair that had grown thicker and looked like a black and gray forest with his long cock standing rigid out of it. His treasure trail had grown up his stomach, and it spread more and more over then belly, and it started to reach his chest with the thick and gray hairs. He stroke himself with his more hairy arms, and he looked at his reflection again. He looked like a really hairy man, and by his nipples dark and gray hair started to grow and meet with the rapidly spreading and increasing treasure trail growing up. He moaned and his voice was even huskier than before, and his stubble had became a thick beard that started growing down his throat and meet up with a black patch of thick hair on the middle of his chest, at the same time growing into the treasure trail and he stroke, and stroke...<br />
He felt immense pleasure, and started panting as he stroke his stomach. He felt how his chest was blooming fur, it was thicker and he felt the warmth intensify along with the pleasurable feeling. His cock was longer and thicker than it had been before, it raised against his stomach, and he felt how the hair on his stomach greeted it and covered in a sheath, and on his ass, a long tail slided out from his buttocks. He moaned higher, and he didn't care about his sister. His chest was a pelt of his own fur, and it started to meet with his mane on the back that was growing to meet his newly growned tail, that wagged slowly while he closed his eyes in the feeling that ate in him. His hand started to get numb, and it became stubbier and grow small claws that was to grow bigger later on, alot bigger. He felt his thighs and he felt how his bones had reshaped under the heavy covering with fur, and he moaned as his muzzle grew out. He rubbed his cock, and started thinking about wild sex, he touched someone, with his throbbing cock he entered, and he cummed. His feet grew fast to a large wolfs haindpaws, and his muzzle and ears grew out and stretched with pleasure as he cummed. Jeff panted and rubbed it more, he stroke and felt how the pleasurable feeling left him and stayed in his canine cock that was still spreading the intense feeling of pleasure in him. His head had a thick neck and a wolfs pride face, he wagged his tail and stepped with his feet as he felt the last changes happen to him. &quot;Wow...next time I must decrease the time!&quot; He thought. He looked in the mirror. He really had fur! He stroke it more, and then he compared with a old school picture on his desk. He set it back, it was never like he was going to stay like this. But it surely felt powerful...<br />
He walked around again, and he started to think that he really was a wolf morph, he was a wolf morph...he loved Chronivac. He stopped wagging his tail, and then sat down as good as he could on the chair, forgetting his tail. He whimpered and said out loud with his new, husky voice. &quot;Ouch!...uh...&quot; He found his voice very odd, it vibrated in his neck as he talked. He never expected himself to talk. Werewolves didn't talk, or did they? &quot;Mom's mother make more mouthfuls of...haha...&quot; It sounded very weird to Jeff, and he sat himself down again, carefull laying his tail aside before sitting down again. He saw better, before he had to go very close to the screen before he could read the startup title, now he saw it crystal clear. He looked around, and felt how everything was smaller than before. He thought, should he go tell some friends about it? He knew his friend Sean, he couldn't think about anything else to do than to share this feeling with him. He took the computer out from the screensaver and looked at the window again. &quot;Where can I find 'restore voice' or something...&quot; This time he didn't notice his voice, but he could guess everyone else would. The door clicked. He looked around quickly in his chair. &quot;Jeff, is it ou talk-&quot; Jeff sat still. His tail wasn't wagging at all. Mom was standing in the door, with her eyes focused on him. She hesitated with her sentance, opened her mouth, then she walked back again with a very stale face. When she was out of the doorway and walking in the hall, he heard how she talked low for herself. &quot;...I really should stop taking those wine glasses before going home...I must have seen wrong...where is my glasses...cigarettes...need cigarettes&quot; Then she opened the door to the outside, and walked out. Jeff sat very, very still. He smelled how smoke outside coming from the window found it's way into his sensitive nose. He lowered his ears again, and sighed, which more sounded like a growl. &quot;Keep original voice: duration: 10 min&quot; The program had in fine print that it couldn't keep the original voice in another body for long because it wasn't really finished, and it would be unhealthy trying to have too small airways for a bigger body. He ticked it off quickly, pushed the enter button and felt a small tingle in his body. &quot;Testing...testing...&quot; He had it back, but when he looked in the mirror...it looked very strange, and he did have a strange feeling of being choked, but he had to. A wolf mimicking a teenagers relatively weak voice. Upstairs, his sister was stamping on the floor to shut him up. He opened the door slowly, turned off the lights, or at least he tried, the light went off before he had turned! He looked back into his room, the computer was off! and walked out in the hall...looking carefully around and then ran with soundless steps to the phone under the stairs. He pulled up the phone, but he had a hard time picking the right number. He pushed wrong many times, and his claw clicked on the plastic surface as he pushed Seans number. First he geld the phone close to his ears, but when the tone appeared it screamed in his head and he held at some distance from his ears that he thought was safe. A high rasping noise heard. She spke quickly, Seans mother... &quot;This is Annette Trinsdale who do you seek?&quot; He was shrugging, her phone had a horrible noise before and with his keen senses it sounded even worser. &quot;It's Jeff, is Sean at home?&quot; She sighed and the with a long and high voice she screamed for Sean. Jeff had laid it on the floor in shock. It rasped in the phone again, and Seans voice was heard. Jeff raised for the phone and picked it up again. &quot;Hi, it's Sean. You gotta come over, I got a weird thing going on here right now.&quot; He sighed on the other side of the phone. &quot;Nope, I got grounded, mom is having her usual 'visitors' that she tends to have an eye for. Where I don't fit in quite right. But can't you come over here instead?&quot; Jeff sighed...how was he going to fix that...He couldn't fix it at his house, he hadn't checked the duration of time before transforming back... &quot;Well...okay...but I wish I could tell you right now, don't get scared I am-&quot;, he heard steps upstairs. &quot;JEFF! What are you doing this late! I am going to tell-&quot;, but she was silent before reaching to the stairs. A click was heard and she heard a swoosh and small, almost unhearable steps in the stairs lower down. A phone hanged on the floor, dead in the tone...<br />
