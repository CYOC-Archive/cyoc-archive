<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Troy headed inside and closed the backdoor behind him. He watched as Clint continued to pet Rosco over the fence. &quot;Now... Let&#39;s see what happens if someone can&#39;t hear me make the spell,&quot; he said as he looked out the window. &quot;Half.&quot;<br />
<br />
He pointed at his neighbor through the window and thought about a horse. Coarse brown fur started forming up and down his arms. It started to cover every inch of his skin. Yet, Clint didn&#39;t seem at all perturbed by it. If anything, he was acting completely normal. Even as his fingers started to fuse together and his nails turned black and hard, he continued to pet Rosco as though nothing was happening. After a few seconds he no longer had five fingers, instead two thick fingers and an even thicker thumb. <br />
<br />
His arms started bulging with even more power, growing thicker and wider as muscle packed onto them. His shoulders broadened and chest pushed out. However, his shirt seemed to grow with him, matching his new, larger body. Even as Clint grew taller, he just leaned down a bit more to make sure he was close to the same height as Rosco. It wasn&#39;t long before his legs were taller than the fence and Troy could get an even better look at that hard-working massive ass straining the red shorts Clint was wearing. Even though the clothes were growing with him, they seemed to also want to show off his growing assets as well.<br />
<br />
Soon long hair erupted out from behind him and a horse&#39;s tail swung back and forth. Clint was obviously still paying a lot of attention to Rosco, asking, &quot;Who&#39;s a good boy?&quot; over and over. His mouth started to jut a little bit further out in front of him, quickly morphing into more of a horse&#39;s face than human. His nostrils flared and widened, growing at the tip of his face while his eyes separated just a tiny bit. Brown fur covered his face while the hair on his head, which was normally cropped fairly short, grew to a wild and unruly length. Easily longer than what he would have ever done before. <br />
<br />
Clint stood back up, standing nearly 2 feet taller than he had been and looked around. However, he didn&#39;t seem confused. And definitely not scared. &quot;Crazy...&quot; Troy muttered as he walked back to the back door. His assumption was right, as long he was the only one who heard the spell, then he&#39;d be the only one who knew it happened. He headed outside. &quot;Thanks, I hope Rosco didn&#39;t do anything bad.&quot; Troy hadn&#39;t realized just how far he&#39;d have to tilt his head back to look Clint in the eyes. The near 7&#39;8&quot; work horse easily towered over him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do anything bad? No way. You&#39;ve got yourself a good dog right there,&quot; Clint laughed. It would have been a belly laugh, however, his hard body easily made that a thing of the past. Instead, he grabbed at his relatively thin waist.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Troy nodded. &quot;He&#39;s a good boy.&quot; Then paused. &quot;Hey,&quot; a bit of discomfort in his voice. &quot;Can I ask how you and your wife met?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmmm?&quot; Clint naturally grabbed towards his wedding ring, now hung on a gold chain around his neck as putting it around his thick hooven fingers would be impossible. &quot;Cause I&#39;m a horse man?&quot; He leaned in closer, adding a poke to prod at Troy.<br />
<br />
Troy was glad to see that Clint had kept his high spirits and similar personality. Something that size, if angry, could probably take a city block down if he really wanted to. But at the same time, he could easily build one up. &quot;Uhh... Yeah,&quot; Troy squeaked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... Let&#39;s just say, I&#39;m glad horse girls exist,&quot; Clint laughed even harder. It turned into a bit of a braying but he quickly calmed himself down when he did so. &quot;Nah. It&#39;s just we met at a party back in college and hit it off.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s it?&quot; Troy tilted his head a bit. He was expecting something different, but that was story that he&#39;d been told before.<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess. I never liked school so I kind of dropped out after freshman year. Went into some heavy labor. Cause,&quot; Clint lifted up his massive arm giving a flex. The powerful bicep bulged and thick veins showed through the brown fur. &quot;Can&#39;t let this body go to waste. Can you see me behind a computer? Hell no man. This body&#39;s built to work.&quot;<br />
<br />
Troy felt himself nodding a bit more than he should have. However, he still couldn&#39;t get over just how big the man in front of him was. Well, part man, part horse. His body screamed masculinity all the way down to the bulge in his shorts. &quot;True. True. Well,&quot; Troy wanted to sit and stare and do a bit more than that, but knew he needed to test the book out a bit more. &quot;Thanks for watching Rosco here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No problem bud. We&#39;re neighbors after all. Might as well be neighborly,&quot; Clint smiled with his horse mouth.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh-huh,&quot; Troy nodded. He felt himself staring again. &quot;Will do,&quot; he finished awkwardly. &quot;C&#39;mon Rosco. Let&#39;s go inside.&quot; Then he opened the backdoor to let his dog in. &quot;Now... The real test. Rosco,&quot; the dog looked at him, &quot;sit.&quot; and obeyed. &quot;Is Clint a human?&quot; Rosco barked twice. &quot;Was he a human?&quot; Two more barks. &quot;Ho--ly Shit... Clint was never a human?&quot; Two barks again. Troy leaned back into the chair. &quot;Relax,&quot; he told his dog and pet him on the head. &quot;This is crazier than I thought... I thought he&#39;d just be okay with it, not that it would change everything.&quot;<br />
<br />
Looking outside, he could see Clint doing his normal weekend yard activities. The only difference is that he took off his shirt, showing off the hard muscles underneath. Yet, he didn&#39;t seem to notice at all. &quot;Okay!&quot; Troy jumped up and clapped his hands. Rosco jumped to attention. &quot;Hold it. Wait. I&#39;ll be right back.&quot; He grabbed the book and headed to the bathroom. &quot;Half,&quot; he said as quietly as possible, just in case Rosco&#39;s hearing could pick it up. <br />
<br />
Instantly, his ears started to travel to the top of his head. They quickly formed into large points as orange and white fur covered them. Troy could also feel a bit of discomfort in his shorts as a bright orange tail grew out from his spine. At its end was a white tuft of hair. &quot;Perfect,&quot; he smiled as he headed back to Rosco. &quot;Is there something different about me?&quot;<br />
<br />
One bark.<br />
<br />
&quot;MOTHER FUCKER!&quot; Troy screamed at the top of his lungs. Even Clint seemed to look over at his house. Troy quickly ducked down just in case he could see. &quot;Is it the ears? And Tail?&quot; One bark. &quot;Damn it...&quot; Troy grabbed the top of his head and Rosco came by to comfort him. &quot;It&#39;s the target... If the target hears then the spell doesn&#39;t have world altering effects.<br />
<br />
Troy continued to pout for a few more minutes. &quot;Shape...&quot; he said disheartedly as he felt his ears go back to their normal shape and his tail pull back into his body. Rosco continued to lick his face, trying to comfort him. &quot;I guess we could go for a walk. Hmm? Does someone want to go for a walk?&quot; Rosco&#39;s tail started to wag wildly. &quot;Alright. Let&#39;s go for a walk.&quot;</p>
