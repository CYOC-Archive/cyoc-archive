<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff brought up the Chronivac software and began to look around. The package had appeared on his porch earlier in the day with a note that he was a beta test recipient. He wasn’t sure exactly but it was, but when he had plugged it in and booted it up it initiated a scan and then a picture of him had appeared on the screen with a bunch of settings and sliders. He figured it must be some fancy AI image manipulator, but whatever it was it seemed pretty high tech.<br />
He was about to start seeing what it could do when there was a knock at the front door. Jeff ran up and opened it to find his girlfriend Jenny waiting on the other side. Jeff and Jenny were both 19 and seniors in high school. Jeff’s parents were out of town for a few days so he figured this would be the perfect time to have Jenny over so they could do whatever they wanted. <br />
“Hi Jenny!” Jeff said. “Come on down to my room, I ordered some pizza and we can do whatever tonight.”<br />
“Sounds great!” She said.<br />
Jenny was cute, with a little pudge and blond hair. She was wearing a blue crop top and shorts, and had her school books along, in case they ended up making time for studying. They made their way down the stairs and into Jeff’s bedroom. Jenny plopped down onto the bed and began riffling through her bag. Jeff was about to join her when he heard a slight beeping sound on his computer. The Chronivac had apparently scanned Jenny when she came into the room, and now was displaying a similar screen for her with the presets, sliders, and picture.<br />
“What was that Jeff?” Jenny asked.<br />
“Oh nothing, I just need to finish up a few things real quick and then we can hang out, if you have something you can do for a few minutes? Jeff asked.<br />
“Oh sure, no problem.” Jenny replied, taking out a book and beginning to read.<br />
Jeff looked back to his screen. There were all sorts of preset dropdowns titled muscle, inanimate, mythology, animal, fantasy, gender, etc. Several of them had a ‘pro’ tag on them and were not seemingly implemented. Jeff clicked on the muscle dropdown. He had always had a bit of a thing for muscley people, even though he was pretty scrawny himself. He clicked the ‘Fit and Toned’ preset options and the sliders all seemed to adjust automatically. He also ticked up the breast size to D cups and slid the slider for abs over more. <br />
Jeff was very curious to see what this fancy image generator would do, so he scrolled down and clicked ‘commit changes’. A box popped up that said ‘Pleasurable Transformation’, with a yes or no button. He wasn’t sure what that meant, so he just clicked yes and after a moment a progress bar popped up onto the screen that read ‘Alterations in progress’, with a slow ticker that began at 1%. <br />
Jenny squirmed slightly on the bed.<br />
“Hey are you about ready to eat?” Jeff asked, standing up from his computer.<br />
“I uh…” Jenny stood up from the bed. “It’s so weird, is it getting really hot in here?”<br />
“No, I don’t feel super warm.” Jeff said, slightly confused.<br />
“Uhhhhhhhh…” Jenny let out a slight, involuntary moan that seemed to surprise both her and Jeff. “I am SO sorry, I don’t know why…” she trailed off again. <br />
“Jenny, are you ok?” Jeff asked, slightly concerned.<br />
“It’s just so hot…” she said, seemingly almost zoned out and not paying attention to him anymore. <br />
Almost mechanically she began stripping off her clothes. First her shirt, then her shoes, socks and pants until she was down to just her bra and panties. Jeff’s face went beet red as he speechlessly watched his girlfriend also undo her bra, letting it fall to the ground. She was breathing heavy, eyes closed, a light sheen of sweat on her skin. Then the changes began.<br />
Jeff watched in stunned silence as Jenny’s slight pudge began melting away. Her arms began to thin, almost as if an invisible straw was sucking all the excess fat out. <br />
She began moaning softly again, her hand sliding across her arms as heat radiated in her. She didn’t know what was happening, but god it felt good. The warmth moved up to her face as her cheeks shrunk in, her face losing the plump roundness. The warmth traveled down through her chest, her boobs shrinking slightly as the fat drained away. Her stomach gurgled, and began to slowly contract in towards her waist. She couldn’t help but run her hands down her chest and on to her stomach. She could feel them moving inward as her stomach contracted, the stubborn belly fat that she had had for years slowly disappearing. The heat began to move downwards again, lingering just for a moment in her crotch. She gasped, both of her hands shooting down to her now wet panties. The feeling lasted only for a brief moment as the warmth continued to move down her legs, fat melting away, before it stopped, and she exhaled a loud breath, her mind slightly clearing.<br />
Jeff could only stare, his penis fully erect in his pants. His mostly naked girlfriend stood in front of him breathing heavily, sweat dampening her skin, the bottom of her panties soaked. In the span of just a minute or two she had lost several dozen pounds, but her skin didn’t seem stretched at all, and her small nipples stood erect, her hands still near her panties. She didn’t quite have a model’s body, but Jeff was incredibly turned on.<br />
“What the fuck…” Jeff breathed.<br />
“Holy shit!” Jenny exclaimed, wiping sweat off of her forehead and looking down at herself. “Holy shit this is insane!”. She looked towards Jeff, seemingly not registering, or not caring that she was still mostly naked. “How?! This feels so good.” She smiled just noticing the bulge in Jeff’s pants. “Looks like someone is liking what he sees.” She said with a grin. <br />
Jeff went red again, but managed to turn away as he heard a small beep and glanced towards the computer monitor. The status bar read 33%, and the readout said ‘finalizing changes, prepping phase 2’.<br />
“Uh, I don’t know how to tell you this” Jeff said with a slight grimace, “but I think this may be my fault. You see that thing on my computer? I thought it was an image manipulator or AI generator, but it somehow seems to be making the changes for real, which is just, I’m still having a hard time believing it, yet you’re standing in front of me like…” he waved his hands up and down.<br />
“So, wait, you’re telling me that it scanned me and you put in some changes and now it’s actually doing that to me for real?!” Jenny asked, shocked.  <br />
“Uh, I think so, and uh…it’s not done yet, and it doesn’t look like there’s any cancel button…” Jeff said quietly.</p>
