<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Where are we with our mobile team?” Agent Johnson asked. He and his two supporting agents, Brook Reed and Sean Walker, were rushing around the Seattle US Marshal building, trying to coordinate. They’d managed to get some local Seattle police involved, but as for the Moon Lake authorities, they weren’t sure how to go about telling them. No doubt they were already aware of the situation, given that Johnson called Samantha Twist. But where to go from there, they weren’t sure.<br />
<br />
“We can’t keep them in the dark sir. We’ll be mobilizing armed troops. We don’t want any collateral damage.” Agent Reed said. <br />
<br />
“They haven’t been very helpful though…” Agent Walker grumbled. <br />
<br />
“Shut up Walker. Reed, get me on the phone with the Moon Lake police chief. I want him read in on the situation. ALL of it.” Johnson said, ignoring Walker’s protests. <br />
<br />
“And then?”<br />
<br />
“We’re going over there. I haven’t heard from Lawson yet. His CO has been informed already. He said he’d send someone down there to keep Evan in line if need be.” Johnson said. Evan Lawson was “a man possessed” when he got riled up, that’s what his commanding officer said. <br />
<br />
“You really think they could stop him? Evan Lawson is without a doubt one of the most intimidating men I’ve ever met.” Agent Walker said. Johnson had to agree with that. He’d served his time in the Marines, but never met anyone quite like Lawson. <br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Speak of the devil…<br />
<br />
Francis’ phone conversation with Martha ended just as Samantha arrived at the Lawson’s. In the short time it took to drive over, things had already been set in motion. An officer was sent over to the Lawsons, who just so happened to be Francis’ older brother, Samson. <br />
<br />
“Samantha!” Samson called from his position a few blocks away. He ran up to her, as she approached the house.<br />
<br />
“Either the police chief sent you, or this is the weirdest coincidence ever.” Samantha said. <br />
<br />
“Thankfully it’s the former. I guess you haven’t told the Lawsons yet then. I can wait out here if it’ll make things easier.”<br />
<br />
“Just for a bit, thanks. I’m sure the second they spot you they’ll put two and two together. And it’ll take all of us to stop Evan from storming out of the house to track this Bower kid down.” Samantha said. Being a werewolf, Evan was the strongest were present. William, Martha, Samantha and Samson were smaller species, who wouldn’t be able to contain an angry wolf. Jonathan was the most compatible in terms of musculature, being a weretiger, and a full grown male. Elle and Maggie’s panther forms were close, but they were built for stealth. <br />
<br />
“Good luck.” Samson said, retreating back from the house a bit. He kept one ear to the house so he could hear what was going on inside, the other to the wind incase he heard anything. He’d been given Bower’s mugshot, but wasn’t sure if he had since changed his appearance. And he had no clue what kind of were he is. <br />
<br />
Samantha walked up to the front door, prepared for the worst when she delivered the news. Upstairs, Spencer and Alex had both heard Samantha pull up to the house. They then heard Maggie letting her inside. Alex looked out the window, and saw a police officer down there. <br />
<br />
“Something’s up.” Alex thought. <br />
<br />
“What’s with you two?” Eric asked, pausing the game. <br />
<br />
“Nothing, just thought I heard something.” Alex said. But he and Spencer exchanged a knowing look. Alex didn’t have a clue what was going on, but from the nervous look on Spencer’s face he knew it could be good. Eric went back to the game, but Spencer wasn’t in the mood to continue. <br />
<br />
“Do you guys want anything to drink?” Spencer asked, suddenly jumping up. Eric shook his head, but Alex asked for something. He knew Spencer just wanted an excuse to go downstairs. She was grateful he did understand, because she was dying to know what was going on. Alex took her place, and Spencer slipped out of her room. <br />
<br />
She stopped halfway down the staircase, where she could just make out what the adults were talking about in the kitchen. Samantha met Martha and William in the living room first. Their conversation carried up to her sensitive ears. <br />
<br />
“…finished my call with Francis.” Martha said. William was looking from his wife, to Samantha, and back again. He wasn’t sure what was going on, but it was serious. <br />
<br />
“Then you won’t mind if I talk to the Lawsons alone?” <br />
<br />
“Of course not. Should I get Eric and Alex…?” <br />
<br />
“Not yet. Let’s wait a second. I don’t want to alarm them. Let me talk to Maggie and Evan, then we can go from there.” Samantha said. Martha nodded and took William aside to explain the situation to him. Samantha continued into the kitchen.<br />
<br />
“Samantha, what’s going on?” Elle asked. Maggie already had a hunch, as did Jonathan. But Evan, he wanted to hear it from her mouth. Whether it be good news or bad news. <br />
<br />
“Jeremy’s been spotted. The feds got a tip, he was dropped off just outside town and…”<br />
<br />
“Evan don’t you dare!” Maggie said, her husband springing from his seat. Jonathan stood in his way, Maggie had a strong hand on Evan’s arm. Both trying to keep him from running out the backdoor to rip Jeremy Bower apart. <br />
<br />
‘Evan, let the feds and police handle this. It won’t do anyone any good if you’re out there.” Samantha said. Her words didn’t reach Evan. He kept himself from shifting, but he still tried to get past his brother-in-law and wife.<br />
<br />
“Don’t make me do this Evan. This is NOT your fight.” Jonathan said, ready to change if that’s what it took for Evan to stay. <br />
<br />
“The hell it isn’t!” Evan growled. <br />
<br />
“Evan, you’re not thinking straight. You go out there, and you’re just putting yourself in harms way.” Elle said, also rising to her feet. <br />
<br />
“I did five tours in the Middle East, I think I can handle some Washington forest!” Evan snapped. <br />
<br />
“Evan…”<br />
<br />
“Either you let me go drag that son of a bitch back here alive, or I’m going to force my way out and bring him back as a trophy!” Evan said. <br />
<br />
The adults continued to argue, completely unaware Spencer heard everything. And to an extent, Alex did too. The TV was loud enough that thankfully Eric didn’t hear anything. <br />
<br />
Spencer quickly ran from her spot on the staircase, only to pause outside her door. Alex was looking right at her, his eyes filled with worry and confusion. She held his gaze for a moment, and then dashed into her parents bedroom before he could say anything. <br />
<br />
She was out the window, and running before Alex could do anything to stop her. She didn’t notice the police officer standing on the sidewalk in front of her house. He didn’t have enough time to react, only to watch the teenager run to the backyard and disappear into the trees. Samson cursed, and radioed the station. Spencer kept going, further and further into the woods. <br />
<br />
“He’s here to get me.” Her mind raced, and repeated that sentence over and over. Spencer threw herself forward, changing on the fly. She doesn&#39;t even care that her clothing is left shredded behind her. She just runs, faster and faster, now on all fours. Her tail streams out behind her, and the black, silver in places, fur makes her standout amidst the changing foliage. Her ears lie flat against her head, and her claws are extended. <br />
<br />
Spencer knew Jeremy’s scent as well as her own. She thanked God she’s inherited her father’s acute sense of smell. She stopped briefly to get her bearings. She&#39;s only gone about five hundred feet into the forest. The small stream that runs behind her house is in front of her, and to the left are the Moon Lake city limits. Spencer rushes to where the public road meets the private. She stays concealed in the trees, but picks up Jeremy&#39;s scent. From there, she rushes back into the thicket. <br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Samson, still trying to contact the police station, went inside the house to deliver the unfortunate news. When the adults saw him, they didn’t know what to think. They stopped their bickering, and froze.</p>
