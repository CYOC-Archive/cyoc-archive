<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You watch Becky and the woman, transfixed.  Helplessly, as if in a dream, you sit paralyzed - half with fear and half with disbelief as you can't help but admire the strange beauty of the gypsy woman and grace with which she first removes Becky's clothing.  Slowly and seductively removing each article of clothing with fingers adorned with nails that suddenly appeared a bit longer and sharper than a moment ago...<br />
<br />
You scan for a moment the gypsy woman's naked body as she begins licking the neck of your now almost completely naked friend.  You can't help but be strangely turned on by the site of the woman's well-toned, yet exceedingly feminine naked form.  You can't help but notice that her shapely, tan legs, previously covered by the dress now pooled around her feet, are unshaven and covered in dark hair would perhaps be considered hairy even on a man.  As your eyes continue up her body, you notice that the hair continues up her thighs to meet with the hair at her unshaven, impressively full nether region.  You notice too that her forearms are similarly covered by long, dark hairs that even extend noticeably onto the back of her otherwise delicate, feminine hands.  Hands that are lovingly caressing the skin on Becky's body - mcuh to her apparent bliss. In your delirious state of mind, these unusual details seem perfectly normal and somehow even enhance her attractiveness to you.  Although the back of your mind is telling you this is all not normal and very, very wrong, you begin to start feeling almost jealous of Becky.  Every moment you sit transfixed, you lose more and more will power as you are slowly and subtly overcome by the rising muck and pheremones.<br />
<br />
The woman senses your admiring stares and turns her attention from Becky to flash you a smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;Like what you see?  Oh don't worry,&quot; she says with a playfully reassuring tone through slightly longer and sharper canine teeth, &quot;I'm promise yours will be just as beautiful once we're done with you!&quot;  With that, she smiled knowingly at the man behind you before brushing her long, dark hair behind an inhumanly pointed ear and returning her attention to a desperately waiting Becky.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shit!&quot; you silently admonish yourself in surprise.  Your strange fixation on the woman and events unfolding before you had somehow made you completely forget about the other man - and your own perilous situation.  You know realize that all the while he was standing behind you, gently resting his hands on your shoulders, instead letting his almost imperceptible scent mentally hold you in place on your stool.<br />
<br />
The surprise gives you a moment of clarity, breaking you out of the mush-induced hypnotism you had been experiencing.  &quot;Becky!  What the hell are you doing!&quot; you call out desperately to your friend who is almost now completely naked save for her undergarments.  &quot;THINK about what you're doing... PLEASE!&quot;  <br />
<br />
&quot;I know... exactly what I'm doing...&quot; Becky responds in that same faraway tone that makes you wonder if she truly does know.  Maybe the influence of the two werewolves is too strong for her.  Becky has in fact always been the more susceptible, eager-to please of the two of you.  What if this is something she will horribly regret when we finally get out of this nightmare?  Well, IF we ever get out, you silently correct yourself as you notice the man's hold on your shoulders become firm.<br />
<br />
You futilely reach out to grasp Becky's arm to try and shake her back to her senses but it's no use - the man's grip is easily too strong.  You grunt in frustration as she is beyond your reach and, even worse, is now passionately kissing the hirsute woman while removing her own bra and panties.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come now,&quot; the man whispers gently in your ear, &quot;look at how your friend willingly accepts us and the gift we are about to give her.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No... don't want this. You're...messing our minds.  Want to leave... please...&quot; you clumsily try protest, trying to reason with him.  You know in the back of your mind that you definitely do not want to be a werewolf no matter what they say.  However, words and thoughts begin to fail you as the spell you are under intensifies and will power fades.<br />
<br />
&quot;I really wish you wouldn't fight us,&quot; he says in the same gentle, seductive tone.  &quot;I'm sure this is all a tremendous shock to your system,&quot; he continues while beginning again to stroke your face with the back of his hairy hand, &quot;but trust me, in time you will grow to accept it.  To LOVE it.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;To love it...&quot; you hazily repeat back to him, once again beginning to feel the grip of his spell.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Be one of us, Jen,&quot; he says. &quot;all you need to do is... relax.  And let nature take control.&quot;<br />
<br />
You start feeling the uncontrollable attraction to him once again.  Although a pretty girl, you've never received very much attention from the opposite sex and this man is, well, the most attractive man you can remember seeing.  And he wants you.  You feel yourself giving into the moment again, forgetting your fear and desperation to leave. <br />
<br />
Thoughts of werewolves are momentarily pushed from your mind he leans in to kiss you.  You respond in kind and soon you are both locked in a passionate kiss.  You lose track of time and space and don't even realize him unbuttoning your top and jeans as your attraction to him grows.  <br />
<br />
His passionate lips begin to roam slowly down your exposed torso, past your belly...  and you pass out as the strange mix of pheremones, ecstasy, and fear from the evening finally takes its toll.  <br />
<br />
After what seems like an eternity, the fog clears from your head and you slowly begin to regain your senses.  You find yourself fully clothed and in a strange, dark room on a bed.  You feel strangely hung over, yet you don't remember drinking anything.  As a matter of fact, you don't remember much of anything since entering the strange bar.  An attractive man is leaning against the far wall next to the closed door, silently watching you with a knowing smile.  There is something oddly familiar about him and he gives you an uneasy feeling as though something about him says &quot;Danger.&quot; You frantically look around the small room hoping to find Becky but she is not there.<br />
<br />
&quot;Becky?&quot; You call out.  No response.  &quot;Becky?... BECKY!&quot; you call out more frantically, eyes darting around in desperate search for her.  Tou turn to the man, and menacingly demand &quot;Where is she?  What have you done with her?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, relax.  Your friend Becky just left to get you some tylenol for your headache.  You had a little too much fun tonight I'm afraid.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean?&quot; you hesitantly ask, hoping you hadn't done anything you would regret.  You fight your pounding head and try to think back and recall anything about how you arrived in the strange room but you draw a complete blank.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't worry, nothing bad,&quot; he said, &quot;You just slipped and hit your head.  My wife and I own this bar so we took you to this back room while you recovered.  Next time, try to maybe limit the table dancing ok?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Table dancing?&quot; you repeat skeptically.  That doesn't sound like something you'd do, even if you were drunk, which you certainly don't remember.  However, sufficiently embarrassed by the mere possibility or making a fool of yourself in public, you don't argue and instead are only anxious to leave this whole awkward situation.  Thankfully, Becky just then opens the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well look who finally decided to wake up,&quot; Becky says with mock scolding while smiling and offering you a couple tylenol and glass of water.  &quot;Ready to go?&quot;<br />
<br />
You hurriedly suck down the pills and water, awkwardly thank the strange man, and quickly pull Becky out of the room by the hand.  As you reach the bar's entrance and begin pushing open the door, you hear the man calling after you &quot;It was a pleasure meeting you Jen.  Don't worry, I promise you'll be feeling even better than normal in no time!&quot;<br />
<br />
You don't bother to return the pleasantry and instead continue pulling Becky out with you into the cool morning air.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I'm glad that's all over, &quot; you say with a sigh of relief.  &quot;That was totally weird.  And what the hell happened last night?  Did I really table dance?  I can't remember anything!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Um...&quot; Becky asks with a tinge of confusion. &quot;So you really don't remember anything...?&quot;</p>
