<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jess woke up the next morning, feeling very strange, and having a funky taste in her mouth.<br />
<br />
There was no questioning what was going on.  She remembered the previous day very well.  She had turned herself into a male dalmation taur, and in the process, sent a copy of her conciousness into the taur&#39;s sheath.  She was that conciousness.<br />
<br />
A part of her had hoped that she&#39;d wake up in the morning, back to normal.  Or at least with her conciousness merged back with the dalmation taur&#39;s.  She knew that neither situation was likely, though.  She was disappointed to learn she was right.<br />
<br />
Oh well.  Might as well enjoy this.  She became a sheath of her own choice, after all.  Her stay was simply extended.  By how much, she wasn&#39;t sure.  But assuming the Chronivac had been unplugged for whatever reason, she&#39;ll either change back when it&#39;s plugged back in, or the taur will discover her and retrieve her himself.  She was fairly certain she wouldn&#39;t be stuck as a sheath, forever, at least.<br />
<br />
Being her own sheath was not easy for Jess to get used to.  No longer having limbs, no movement of her own, a dog&#39;s penis resting inside her, the way her body lightly swayed as her host moved.  It also occurred to her that her body also included the dog&#39;s ballsack.  Not the balls themselves, though.  She was effectively just the housing for a dalmation taur&#39;s maleness.  Is she still female if the male parts aren&#39;t technically a part of her?<br />
<br />
There&#39;s also the fact that she has no sight or hearing.  She&#39;s exposed to the world, and yet isolated at the same time.  It was quite a surprise when she suddenly found a tongue licking across her body, last night.  And as quickly as it entered her world, it disappeared.  She wondered in what way reality changed, that the dalmation taur would give itself a tongue-bath instead of a regular one.<br />
<br />
Another strange sensation was the feeling of the penis within her being pushed out.  Even at this moment, it was nudging itself out.  And then the scent of urine entered her world.  She had no idea how the Chronivac enabled her to have a sense of smell without a nose, but smell was now the only thing she could detect from outside her body.  She had caught scent of pork & beans last night, as well.  That wasn&#39;t one of her favorite meals, so she wasn&#39;t too bummed about missing out on that.<br />
<br />
Soon after the pee session, Jess felt warm water surrounding her body.  Was she wrong about the dalmation taur and baths?  Nice to know she&#39;s gonna receive some proper care.<br />
<br />
Being underwater like this was ultra surreal.  As a sheath, she had no need to breath.  The taur was supplying all the blood and oxygen to her.  But being underwater really sold it.  No sensation of drowing.  Just the simple warmth of being surrounded by water.  There was also a washcloth rubbing her at one point.  Even underwater, her senses of taste and smell were intact.  She could smell the soap in the washcloth.  And after the penis within her had been cleaned and retracted, she could taste a little of the soapy water on it.  It was so strange to experience the difference in taste between a dirty penis and a clean penis.  Especially a dog&#39;s penis.<br />
<br />
Once everything was done, the bath water left her world, save for some that was dripping off of her.  The air felt chill around her.  She then felt the violent sensation of the body she was attached to shaking, as the water on her was slung off.  Not a harfmul experience, but certainly a jarring one, especially with the balls within her ballsack swaying inside her.  She had no idea that it&#39;d feel this weird to have testicles inside her.  As a girl, she&#39;d always had ovaries tucked snug deep within her body.  Stranger still that these balls aren&#39;t techically her&#39;s.<br />
<br />
Her mind drifted to her other copy.  First sent to her vagina, now transformed into the dalmation taur&#39;s penis.  Unlike her, the penis within her had fully intended to stay a part of her body, for an entire 24 hours.  She wondered if &quot;he&quot; was stuck like she was.  &quot;He&quot; was probably confused about being turned into a penis, at least.  She really hoped that &quot;he&quot; was enjoying &quot;his&quot; time as a penis.  She had assumed that being a penis might be a better experience than being a vagina.  And if &quot;he&quot; is stuck like she is, &quot;he&quot; might wind up experiencing life as a penis for a while.<br />
<br />
And she wondered, is it her fault?  In the process of changing &quot;him&quot; and creating herself as another copy, did something screw up?  Or, a more optimistic possiblity, maybe the transformations stacked, and both she and &quot;him&quot; will merge with the conciousness of their new host after the full day is up.<br />
<br />
No way to watch the time, though.  All she can do is wait for the eventual merging of conciousnesses.  At the very least, being transformed into a sheath isn&#39;t a dull experience.</p>
