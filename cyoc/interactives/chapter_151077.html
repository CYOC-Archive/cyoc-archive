<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Inside the double gates of the dog park, Brad undid the lead from Max.  Then, he knelt down, held Chad&#39;s head between his hand, and stared the dog straight in the eyes, and said, &quot;Okay, Doggy, you&#39;ve still got Chad&#39;s brain in there, so I expect you to understand and obey. Today you&#39;re free from normal obedience training because Karl your owner is apparently having second thoughts.  Maybe he&#39;ll turn you human again after all?  I dunno.  But while you&#39;re a poodle you are my responsibility.  I don&#39;t want you getting hit by a car or anything. Anyway today&#39;s a day off for both of us. We are here in the park, and we&#39;re going to play ball. You&#39;re no longer equipped to pass the ball, but you still can fetch it. So I want you to be a good boy, run and fetch the ball when I throw it, bring it back to me, and we&#39;ll do this a few times.  It&#39;s the good exercise for dogs, you like exercise, so this could be fun for both of us.&quot;  Then he held Chad&#39;s head tighter and leaned in closer, he spoke softer in a more menacing manner, &quot;You try any disobedient shit, like not fetching the ball, running away, humping another dog or trying to get out of the park, remember Max and I will be on you like white on rice, got it?&quot;  <br />
<br />
Chad managed to nod his head.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Good boy, let&#39;s have some fun.  Now stay when I release your lead, and then we&#39;ll play fetch,&quot; Brad said undoing the leash.  <br />
<br />
As if to emphasize Brad&#39;s words, Chad felt hot breath on his shoulder, Max had moved into herding position. Chad sighed to himself.  He didn&#39;t see a lot of options, and his muscles were stiff from sleeping on the concrete floor, and then having Max lie on top of him for the trip to the park.  Fetch might be a little humiliating, but when he was little he had tried desperately to get his big bro to play catch with him, and fetch might be close enough, he thought trying to put a bright spin on things.  The brightest thing was Karl was having second thoughts, so Chad might be human later today. More likely by Monday or Tuesday, he thought unhappily considering Brad was involved. Oh, well best make the best of it.<br />
<br />
The lead was off, Chad sat on his hindquarters assuming the stay position.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good boy, now Chad, fetch!&quot;  Brad took a small ball out of his pocket, and threw nearly 100 yards.  Chad turned and bolted after it.  He could hear Max behind him.  Max wasn&#39;t playing fetch, he was shadowing Chad to make sure he did.  Maybe this wasn&#39;t a day off, maybe this was Brad&#39;s customized obedience training for humans.  Hm, did he train a lot of human dogs?  Oh, well, it was good to run finally. Chad enjoyed stretching his muscles.  He caught up with the ball and picked it up, turned and ran back to Brad.  Fuck, did Brad want him to keep the ball in his mouth or drop it at his feet.  Chad quickly decided to keep it in his mouth, and wait for Brad to take it or order him to drop it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good doggy,&quot; Brad said petting Chad&#39;s poodle head.<br />
<br />
Doggy instead of boy or Chad was sort of irritating, and it triggered a memory of Brad babysitting Chad when he was a toddler.  He&#39;d put an old collar and leash on Chad, tied him to the dog stake in the backyard, and treated him like he treated his dog Lightning.  Damn, he had treated Lightning better.  Chad had gone along with it at first, but he soon got tired of it. Brad kept Chad as a dog until their parents got home, and then he removed the collar and lead, and gave Chad some shorts to put on. He warned Chad to be quiet or he&#39;d be sorry.  Chad was a bit stiff from having spent the day on his hands and knees, and was delighted to have real food after eating kibble all day. Dog treats do taste better when you really are a dog thought Chad, as Brad took the ball and fed Chad a dog treat.<br />
<br />
<br />
Brad threw the ball a dozen times more before Chad noticed what the ball really was.  He almost puked as he picked it up in his mouth.  It was a prosthetic testicle for a dog.  He&#39;d seen them in his dad&#39;s office before.  Was Brad just using it as a fetch ball or was it supposed to be a subtle warning that Chad could still lose his nuts.  Chad decided he&#39;d play dumb, and not let Brad know that he recognized it.  <br />
<br />
Brad did notice that Chad had paused picking up the ball.  He asked Chad if there was a problem with the ball.  Chad turned his head and barked upward. A squirrel leapt from one tree to the next.<br />
<br />
Brad laughed, &quot;Oh, so you wanna chase squirrels?  I may just let you and Max do that, but Max always catches one when I do.  If he catches one before you, Chad, what prize will you give Max?&quot;<br />
<br />
Chad&#39;s eyes widened.  He wasn&#39;t about to let Max mount him voluntarily, and that seemed to be the only prize he could give Max.  No squirrel chasing, then.  He lay down on the grass, to say as much.<br />
<br />
Brad laughed.  &quot;I didn&#39;t say lay down, doggy!  But I suppose this means you don&#39;t want to chase squirrels if you have to reward Max?&quot;<br />
<br />
Chad nodded.  Brad laughed.  He really was having fun with Chad.  More fun than he&#39;d had since he was a kid, and had tied up the naked brat in the backyard while babysitting.  Chad was an okay dog then, but now, now, Brad bit his lip.  If Karl decided to change Chad back, there was no reason Brad couldn&#39;t keep his brother locked up and train him?  He&#39;d seen leather and rubber dog slave suits on line, yeah, whether as a dog or human, Brad would be training Chad to be a good dog. He smiled, and ran his hands intimately over the poodle&#39;s body.  <br />
<br />
Chad enjoyed the human contact.  Brad seemed happy.  Chad was happy too.  He sort of forgot that he wasn&#39;t human and had forcibly transformed into a poodle - well, really more tricked.  Karl couldn&#39;t force human Chad to do anything except at iPad point.  The whole thing seemed ludicrous, now that Chad had convinced himself that he would be human soon.  He might as well play along and enjoy being a dog until then.<br />
<br />
Chad and Max spent an hour chasing each other.  Max wasn&#39;t so bad, Chad decided, as he accepted his doggy role.  He wasn&#39;t to eager to accept Beta Male to Max&#39;s Alpha Male, and would run ahead or try to lead, Max seemed to enjoy the game too.<br />
<br />
Finally, Brad shouted, &quot;Come Max, Come Chad!&quot;  <br />
<br />
Max bolted for Brad immediately, Chad paused.  Looked around the park, and then followed Max back to Brad.<br />
<br />
&quot;You boys had a nice workout, time to get going,&quot; Brad said.</p>
