<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Max’s changes weren’t done yet. As Ty eagerly watched, Max’s shirt started getting tighter on him, riding up the growing gut that was steadily replacing his toned, lean abs, which was becoming fuzzier and fuzzier as he looked on. Max’s hips were widening too, straining the shorts covering him, and his now visible muffin tops were as furry as his belly, fur the same color as his reddish hair, but much lighter on his exposed stomach now, forming a circular pattern that went up his torso. <br />
<br />
The fur creeped up Max’s swelling body. Soon the former muscle kid was significantly rounder, going from lean to chubby. He’d developed another chin as the fur crawled up his face turning darker, almost black, around his eyes, with his nose becoming black and triangular like an animal’s. His ears became pointed as they shifted to the top of his head. By now his new clothes were starting to tear under the pressure of his growing pudge. His belt was the only thing that seemed to grow with him and still fit, though resting under his belly’s huge overhang. Despite becoming so chubby though, Max’s body had not lost any of it’s capabilities, and he was just as energetic and eager as he was as a human ninja boy. <br />
<br />
Max’s thickening legs and arms started ripping his shorts and his sleeves, as the fur traveling down them transformed them to make them proportionally rounded, his hands and feet becoming more primal and paw-like. He even shrunk a little, not much, but he was now shorter than when he was only a human ninja kid. The seat of his pants completely tore as a big, round, fluffy tail emerged from the base of his spine and twitched. <br />
<br />
With this, Max’s frozen body finally relaxed, with a sigh as he let his bigger belly hang out, letting out a squeaking fart and yellow-green gas cloud to alleviate the pressure in his stomach, a leaf suddenly appearing on his head. By now his no-longer fitting shirt was more like a croptop as his midriff had expanded so much it could barely be covered anymore. Max looked down curiously, patting his big belly and feeling it jiggle, “H-Hey! Why did you make me fat?!” He blushed slightly, as Ty chuckled, “Tanuki’s are supposed to be chubby right? Also it won’t impact you in any way, I can guarantee that.” He smiled as Max turned to face him. “I’m… a tanuki ninja boy?!” Ty grinned, “Yep.”<br />
<br />
Max wasn’t totally sure, this still felt a little weird, but he was surprisingly fluffy now, and something about shaking his belly did feel curiously pleasant to him. He pressed down on it, and let out another squeaky fart accompanied by a foul-smelling gas cloud, which should’ve felt embarrassing to him, but seemed strangely natural now. “But wait… There’s something… Missing?” Max said, though he wasn’t sure what. Suddenly there was a pain in his crotch that made him cringe. The bulge of what remained of his pants was suddenly growing, like a balloon almost, filling out between his legs as it sagged lower and lower. Ty just chuckled, “And what is that?” Max winced, eye twitching, but strangely smiling as he grabbed his rapidly swelling crotch, which was growing to be too big for his pudgy paws to hold, tearing the remains of his shorts as it did. <br />
<br />
With a loud snap, the front of his pants finally tore apart, as a loud slap, like a rubber ball, hit the floor and bounced back up, “A… A…” Max gulped, looking down, “A big pair… of tanuki balls!” Max’s testicles were huge now, dangling pendulously between his chubby legs. His penis was still the same size, but his balls were almost as big as his belly now. Ty nodded, “Yup! I wanted it to be authentic after all.” Max tried to scoop up his heavy sac, noting that as big as it was, it wasn’t really heavy. He still felt he could move as nimbly as a human even in spite of his huge balls now. “And just like an anime tanuki, you can use them to fly or hold stuff like a bag, or swing them around like a wrecking ball. You can grow them as big as you want. They’re elastic enough you can even bounce on them like yoga balls. And no matter what happens you won’t feel any pain if they get hit. Pretty cool, huh?” Max sighed, fondling his huge testicles. He relaxed, feeling them grow even more until they were dragging along the floor, then sucked in, feeling them reseed until they rested comfortably between his legs like a loincloth, though still much bigger than his old testicles. <br />
<br />
“So what do you think?” Ty asked him. Max bounced his furry belly simultaneously with his big fuzzy balls, feeling his new body becoming increasingly more natural.</p>
