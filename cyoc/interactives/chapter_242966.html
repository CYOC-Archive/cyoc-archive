<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jennifer’s goal from the moment she entered Frank’s house was to make sure that she wouldn’t get pregnant. This meant that Jennifer wasn’t going to put her lips on anything that resembled a booze or beer.<br />
<br />
On the entrance Jennifer watched from the side when a tall and well dressed male college student greeted Silvia with a hug. He wore a navy blue dress shirt and dress pants on top of the shirt. His unique thick rimmed glasses, shaved face and maple tree scented cologne were things that separated him from the rest of the people when Jennifer glanced at him. While Silvia spoke with this man with the glasses, Jennifer observed how short her mother was compared to him. The tip of Silvia’s head didn’t go past from this man’s neck level. Making the man one feet longer than what her mother was. <br />
<br />
Jennifer compared her own height to the man’s height and realized how little she had become. Jennifer had to tilt his head upwards to look at man’s face, and when she looked straight in front of her, Jennifer was staring directly at the man’s crotch and her lower body area. Which made sense in it’s twisted way. If Jennifer was going to be four feet tall when she was in high school that meant that she had to be shorter than that when she was still in middle school. Jennifer wanted to make sure how tall she was when she got back home but now she could only assume that Jennifer was under four feet tall but taller than three-and-a-half feet.<br />
<br />
Jennifer was too stuck in her thought that she hadn’t realized that the man was now in front of her and introduced himself as Frank Callaway. Jennifer had to hold her flinching reaction when she heard Frank’s name. He offered a small red cup to Jennifer which had her name labeled on it. Only Jennifer’s cup was different and it had been filled with watery light brown colored liquid that smelled awful. Jennifer held the cup in her hand and decided not to drink it. Jennifer walked past the other guests with her mother and the loud music played from the TV. Jennifer was experiencing a sensory overload from the music and asked if there was a place where she could spend her time alone. Frank told Jennifer that if she wanted Jennifer could spend most of her time in his bedroom if the music and people were too loud for her.<br />
<br />
Frank escorted Jennifer to his bedroom and asked from her if she wanted to eat pizza while mother had fun with the other guests. Jennifer looked around him. This must have been the moment where Frank revealed his true nature but no. Frank didn’t force Jennifer to do anything or ask her anything inappropriate. Jennifer was sure that this had to be the moment where they kissed and told each other that they would meet later and fuck, but no, nothing like that happened. Frank didn’t say or do anything to Jennifer even if she had anticipated it to happen. Jennifer felt puzzled. She didn’t understand why was her image of Frank was more grim than what she was seeing in front of her.<br />
<br />
Frank was acting like nice guy and he had made sure that Jennifer had things to do in his bedroom while she couldn’t attend the party with her mother. When Jennifer asked from Frank why she had to pretend to be older. Frank explained that the other guests would have freaked out if they knew how old Jennifer really was. Frank knew how stressed Silvia was all the time so this was his way to let Silvia know that she was at a safe place. Jennifer had no idea what was happening anymore. Had Jennifer misunderstood what happened that night. Was Jennifer’s knowledge of the future events changing the future already. What was going on.<br />
<br />
Frank gave his old gaming console’s control to Jennifer and asked what type of game she wanted to play. Jennifer sensed that Frank was acting normal and was truly curious what Jennifer liked and disliked. Jennifer didn’t feel any ill intent from Frank’s questions or actions. When Frank finally got Jennifer an old game to play. Silvia knocked on the door and entered the bedroom. She wanted to give Jennifer the car’s keys. Silvia told Jennifer to keep them safe as Silvia had already opened a can of beer and then she gave a small kiss on Jennifer’s cheek before leaving the room with Frank. Jennifer saw how Silvia playfully pulled Frank by his shirt’s collar when they left the room and closed the door.<br />
<br />
Jennifer looked at the red cup with her name on it and made a taste test. The clear beige colored liquid in the cup tasted like beer when Jennifer dipped her pinkie finger into the cup to test what it was. Jennifer wanted to play things safe and didn’t take any sips from the cup. Why would Frank give Jennifer beer if he knew that Jennifer wasn’t old enough to drink it. Jennifer wondered if there was also a possibility that Silvia had told Frank that Jennifer was Silvia’s eighteen years old sister. The lack of information worried Jennifer.<br />
<br />
Hours in the clock ticked forward and Jennifer’s anxiety grew. No one was entering the bedroom. Jennifer didn’t know when “the thing” was going to happen and how it was going to happen. Jennifer wasn’t sure if she was even on a right track or was she repeating the same path that her past self had taken. Jennifer wanted to make sure that her mother was doing all right but she didn’t want to call her with her brand new phone. The music was playing loudly so Jennifer had no idea what was happening beyond the bedroom door. She had to open it and take a look at the other side if she wanted to see what was happening out there.<br />
<br />
When Jennifer opened the bedroom door. She saw something that made her eyes widen and her heart pump more blood into her veins. <br />
<br />
Silvia was kissing Frank’s mouth and giving small hickeys in his neck while Silvia sat with her legs crossed over Frank on top of his lap on the living room sofa. Jennifer saw how intensely the two of them stared at each other. Jennifer felt terrified when she saw her mother so casually dry humping Frank’s crotch and pushing her tongue down Frank’s throat. Jennifer had no idea what her mother was thinking or what sequence of events had let things to escalate that far. Things were definitely going into a different direction. Jennifer didn’t know what type emotion should she feel. Should she be happy that Frank was more interest in Silvia or should she feel shocked that Frank was interested in Silvia.<br />
<br />
The unsure feeling grew larger when Jennifer saw Silvia taking off her bra and letting Frank do something to her tits. Jennifer couldn’t see anyone else in the house except for Silvia and Frank. The other guests must have had already left by now and it seemed that it was only Silvia and Frank occupying the living room all by themselves while chill jazz music played in the background from the TV.<br />
<br />
“Frank. I know this is sudden but I want you to lick my pussy with your tongue the same way you did when we were in high school. I really love it when you do that and if you make me horny enough I might sit on your face. After that we can end this evening like how we were supposed to on that night.”<br />
<br />
Jennifer gasped quietly when she heard her mother say those words but Jennifer couldn’t stop herself from watching when she saw her mother lifting her skirt up and presenting her naked ass to her lusty lover. What surprised Jennifer more was the fact when Frank pushed his head deep inside Silvia’s crotch and did what she had told him to do. Jennifer now understood why her mother hadn’t declined the offer to come here. Maybe Silvia and Frank had hoped that Jennifer wouldn’t interrupt their love making, or maybe they wanted that. Maybe they knew that Jennifer was on the other room and it made them hornier by knowing that Jennifer could appear in front at any moment and ruin their fun time. Jennifer felt something weird happening inside her body when Jennifer heard her mother making high pitched moans in the living room. Jennifer’s gut feeling told her that she had missed her opportunity to mingle with Frank.<br />
<br />
But something else was happening to Jennifer. A strong emotion was surfacing on top of every other emotion when she witnessed her mother having sex with Frank.<br />
<br />
It was jealousy.<br />
<br />
A strong sense of “annoyment” was followed by thoughts like, “Why the heck is my mom kissing Frank. It should have been me! This is all wrong!” Jennifer got more emotional and she didn’t understand why her mind had such a visceral and vile reaction to Silvia’s actions. <br />
<br />
“No, Frank’s mine… This wasn’t what was supposed to happen... Jennifer… Please… Stop her…”<br />
<br />
Jennifer heard a strange voice inside her head echo that sounded like Jennifer but she was sure that she didn’t say those words.<br />
<br />
“Come on Jennifer. Stop your mother. Frank&#39;s your boyfriend. It should be you who’s kissing and sitting in Frank&#39;s lap, not her.”<br />
<br />
The same voice was now commanding Jennifer to act and do things she didn&#39;t want to do. The voices got louder and trying to force her to run to the living room. Jennifer didn&#39;t want to do that and had to pull her feet back to the other side of the room. It must have looked weird when Jennifer&#39;s other half wanted to run outside while the other half wanted to stay inside.<br />
<br />
“You need to stop your mother. Now! Do it!”<br />
<br />
“Jennifer!”<br />
<br />
“MOVE!”<br />
<br />
“DO something!”<br />
<br />
The voices in Jennifer’s head got louder when she saw half naked Silvia sitting on Frank’s face and rubbing her ass on his face. The voice demanded from Jennifer to stop what her mother was doing but didn’t explain what happened if she did that. The voice only explained that Jennifer just had to do it. Jennifer was getting mentally exhausted as it felt if she was at mental arm wrestling match with someone else inside her head for the control of her body. This mystery person in Jennifer&#39;s head was as powerful as Jennifer was and their demands got more desperate when Jennifer didn’t show any signs of moving. There was a small chance that Jennifer was going to lose the mental arm wrestle against the other person but she had equally good chances to win. Jennifer felt that she and the voice in her head were getting tired. There was no clear winner until...</p>
