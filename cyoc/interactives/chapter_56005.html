<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Brian waited until his Matriarch had left, not wanting to contradict her in the very least. To <br />
say anything contradictory to Her was incomprehensible. She was his MATRIARCH after all, <br />
her word was law among the Pride. Once she <br />
<br />
&quot;To say that all Nazis were humans is actually rather incorrect, and dare I say, prejudice.&quot; <br />
Brian said, politely waiting till Mr. P, Mother Glen, and Gillian II had left. &quot;Gypsies, Jews, <br />
ANYONE who wasn't part of Hilter's vision of a perfect ideal Germany paradise were <br />
targeted, but his personal hatred against Jews put them at the top o the list. In particular <br />
when he decided kicking them out when he'd just have to do it again after he conquered <br />
where he had kicked them out TO!<br />
<br />
Gargoyles aren't concerned about right or wrong, good or evil, it isn't in their creed, their <br />
creed in fact speaks AGAINST thinking in such terms. They protect their charges to the <br />
bitter end. When Germany expanded, Gargoyles died. When allies invaded Germany, <br />
Gargoles also died, this time fighting the allies protecting the German towns, cities and <br />
building they had for longer than any human had been alive. <br />
<br />
There were even LEOMAN in Germany's command structure. But not in any of the roles you <br />
think of when thinking of Germany and the war. They had no idea of the Holocaust, of the <br />
genocide. Leoman saw him as just another politician who had rise to power via popularity <br />
rather than ability to govern and ultimately harmless in the long run. Contrary to what <br />
most children are shown, Hitler and his fellow Nazis didn't just barge in and take over, he <br />
was elected via -popular vote-. Not to mention thanks to German propaganda, everyone in <br />
Germany thought Poland had invaded them! The ones who did learn quickly began <br />
smuggling Jews out of Germany. <br />
<br />
Dragons weren't nearly as prominent in the SS, not only due to much, much, MUCH smaller <br />
population, but also by being welcome by the Descendant of the Sun, the Emperor of <br />
Japan, who have always held dragons in religious admiration much like their Emperor <br />
before he formally admitted at the end of the war he was not a god, merely a descendant <br />
of one. The war as a whole pretty much shattered the sense of racial unity that dragons <br />
were so proud of.<br />
<br />
Hilter's legendary charisma also appealed to -many- Lupmans and Felmans, lupmans <br />
seeing the Nazi philosophy as appealing to the 'old ways' of the lupman that the young <br />
and reckless had only learned of in idealized fiction and nostalgia of their grandparents <br />
and great-grandparents. And the old fantasy that American Lupman had betrayed their <br />
cultural heritage. <br />
<br />
There was no storage of Lupman in the SS, who had the letters engraved on their <br />
backside... which made it a lot harder for them to vanish into the mists like their human <br />
and felman comrades did when the war ended.  For felman it was simpler charisma based, <br />
and yes, Felman WERE targeted for being 'biologically inferior in every way' while Lupman <br />
and Leomans were seen as models for Hilter's dream of human supermen. Felman who <br />
were Nazi supports either knowingly or unknowing were simply turned a blind eye to. <br />
Similar to how the Japanese were declared more or less 'fellow members of the same <br />
stock.' &quot;<br />
<br />
Mal'akh declared, &quot;That last part doesn't make a lick of sense!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You're absolutely right it didn't. But it enables the Germans to work with the Japanese <br />
without in their minds betraying their thoughts of being the master race.&quot; <br />
<br />
+++++++++++<br />
<br />
Glass Marie of course had to add another contextual filter around herself as well. Otherwise <br />
her mother Eliza, would become worried sick by now. Marie didn't like doing this in the <br />
least. But it wasn't permanent, and this was a story that had to be told. Eliza had Rick to <br />
keep her company right now. Glass Marie that part of Rick would have wanted to use the <br />
magic to become her sister instead of her father, but a husband was what her mother truly <br />
needed rather than another child right now.  'I wished she was still a normal child who'd <br />
have loved the idea of a new sibling, it would have made things easier.' <br />
<br />
&quot;Samantha 'helped speed things up?' They didn't-!&quot; Maddex's heads said. <br />
<br />
&quot;She and her sister Alissa  were two more to be added to the 'collection' though they stayed <br />
with their family. And since the witches had gotten better from their early days that had left <br />
the original Joella catatonic, they were left with a trace of magic instead of going mad when <br />
exposed to the infinite chaos, not enough to do magic on their own but enough for the <br />
witches to use them as part of their medium. Perhaps it was due to being touched by the <br />
witches' magic already on the same day which enable the chaos to more easily assimilate <br />
into their being. Either way, they didn't go insane when eating candy that opened their <br />
minds to the Infinite Chaos, which proved to Joella that her foster parents nor the candies <br />
nor herself were in any way responsible for the disease of insanity that was plague <br />
Glendale. <br />
<br />
In a way, Joella was the witches' greatest weapon. She became their justification. She had <br />
given them a -future- even as they sought to freeze progress from cradle to grave. It was <br />
in their minds for -her- that they sought to create a perfectly fair world where no one had <br />
to grow up and no one had to die and no one was ever mean to one another and rules <br />
didn't apply at all in any shape or form so everyone was free.&quot;<br />
<br />
Even when as a middle aged woman she learned her foster mothers were responsible for <br />
the game, she thought anything bad that anything evil that happened from the game was <br />
simply their good intentions back firing.&quot; <br />
<br />
Maddex shook his heads so hard they banged into each other, &quot;OW!&quot; &quot;OW!&quot; &quot;How could-&quot; <br />
&quot;How could-&quot; &quot;-she think that-&quot; &quot;She think that-&quot; &quot;of those-&quot;  &quot;of those-&quot; &quot;-horrid <br />
monsters?&quot; &quot;-horrid monsters?&quot;<br />
<br />
Glass Marie said, &quot;Believe it or not, the witches were Joella's main inspiration in life for the <br />
rights of others and their happiness. They had been, as far she knew, making a better <br />
world for her sake.&quot;  <br />
<br />
Betty asked the next obvious question, &quot;The children who they 'infected' MUST have still <br />
had families. They just LET THEM wander to the witches?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The first thing the witches did with their new 'familiars' was place a geass on the families <br />
so they didn't mind their children being taken care of en mass by a family of three women <br />
and a bunch of non-purians.... The geass itself was a taxing endeavor, but the witches <br />
knew it was worth it. &quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;They managed to get all this done before Marie Cruz saw them hang before the end of the <br />
year?&quot; Maddex's head asked amazed. <br />
<br />
&quot;It wasn't like the witches opened up their orphanage in January and Marie and her group <br />
showed up the next day...&quot;<br />
 And when the witches did face justice, while it was due process, their fate was a fairly <br />
foregone conclusion.&quot; <br />
<br />
Betty asked, &quot;Why didn't they give Joella magic? And if they thought what they were doing <br />
was positively right, why did they keep it from their 'daughter?' &quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Long story short? Golgotha knew what was coming, or at least knew they'd face the 'dog <br />
of god.' They had originally thought the fairies would continue their work if something <br />
happened to them. It did occur to them once or twice to expose Joella to the infinite chaos, <br />
but deep down, gogotha feared what would happen if something went wrong.&quot;<br />
<br />
Maddex, &quot;In other words she was willing to risk the children of strangers but not her own.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes. And so since they never gave Joella magic, they were hoping to keep her out of the <br />
crossfire of their climatic battle with the 'pack of god's dogs' ... That was why they made <br />
sure that during the final conflict Joella was with her 'grandfather'...&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Ma-, Goldwyn,&quot; Joella remembered the strict rule of not using that word. &quot;Why do you <br />
always hide your face?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Eh? I'm not hiding-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Is it because of your hurt there?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm not hurt-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's okay ma, Goldwyn. You don't need to hide it.&quot; Joella kindly pushed the hair out of the <br />
way, looking at the half of Golgatha's face that had made her name so fitting. <br />
<br />
Golgatha cringed back, and covered her face again. Joella didn't cry out in terror or cry at <br />
the sight like Golgatha had always thought she would... Instead Joella just stared at her. <br />
&quot;You don't need to be ashamed Goldwyn... it doesn't matter what you look like, I still love <br />
you.&quot; Joella hugged her. Herodias started at this show of affection. <br />
<br />
Allie and Samantha chose that time to finally find Joella and tell her a happy new year! <br />
<br />
&quot;It's a pity we couldn't make them all children.&quot; Golgatha told her siblings after seeing the <br />
cuter interaction, and no longer being ashamed of her own face. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Mistress.&quot; Herodias said, in spite of now supposedly being ancient she looked still like <br />
an adult rather than one that should have been dying from old age by now. &quot;But remember <br />
you ARE going to need help in running the place for the children who have received your <br />
gift. We must balance out those we free with those we convert into help.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And then, we can finally begin?&quot; Gomorrah asked excited sounding like a little girl herself. <br />
Happy at the thought of having someone to take Solome's place in her heart. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes dear.&quot; Said Gaal petting Lilith. &quot;These children we've liberated will be the ultimate <br />
force for good and rescue everyone of Glendale from their slavery. And then we shall take <br />
the entire colony, then on foreword, and foreword, until we ourselves will just have to sit <br />
back and watch as the world is remade into a paradise.&quot; <br />
<br />
<br />
 Betty asked, &quot;Why girls? Children I understand given their prejudice towards adults. But <br />
were they sexist too?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not really. They simply figured that girls would be compatible with their magic than boys <br />
somehow. But at the same time, they knew they'd need at least some boys to balance it <br />
out. That's how it worked in their heads.&quot;<br />
<br />
It would still be a month before the witches got the 'orphanage' officially open, but the <br />
ground work was now complete. The spell had started, and it had already begun to grow. <br />
<br />
&quot;And on New Years Eve of this year, the world will change forever.&quot; Gaal declared proudly. <br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;That was the Game wasn't it?&quot; Betty asked, &quot;The magic they were powering up in that <br />
years to turn the planet into a mad house. It became the curse.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;...yes. They were cut short of their goal. But there was still more than enough to inflict a <br />
powerful self replicating curse with all their power, their familiars, and the infected children <br />
all together.&quot; <br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't like the look of those clouds.&quot; Kathrine spoke her mind referring to the mass of <br />
dark clouds with green lightning arching from one to the next. <br />
<br />
&quot;-I- don't like the look of those clouds.&quot; Captain Wesley himself declared, &quot;Helmsman, <br />
move'er around them and give us a wide distance.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Aye aye sir!&quot;  <br />
<br />
However, the clouds MOVED. <br />
<br />
Much, much, MUCH later, Marie Cruz flicked a piece of severed green tentacle off her <br />
shoulder, her nun dress and Kathrine' stained with black blood that thankfully didn't show. <br />
<br />
&quot;So we are all agreed,&quot; Marie Cruz said in a tired, exasperated voice, &quot;We shall under no <br />
circumstance speak of or discuss the gigantic green octopus demon who tried to eat our <br />
souls and twist our bodies.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;YES!&quot; Vatican said, his polished marble body made rough by the wind and sea air now <br />
stained dark green in nearly every place, 'This is going to take months to scrub out!' The <br />
Gargoyle said, who were not totally without vanity. <br />
<br />
&quot;Agreed!&quot; Captain Wesley said, also deciding to ignore nuns fighting with knives and spears <br />
and passing it off as just part of the twisted imaginary that THING had tried to impose on <br />
his mind and that of his crew. <br />
<br />
&quot;I've already forgotten it!&quot; Kathrine lied. The tentacles had focused on the little felman more <br />
than any of them and she was surrounded by the impaled and severed things.  She had <br />
enough trouble on this voyage already when the elder lupman captain of a spanish ship <br />
had tried to kill her when their vessels had crossed and had ranted that Kathrine smelled <br />
like, 'That damn red cat she-pirate!' <br />
<br />
&quot;Good!&quot; Draco said, &quot;Then perhaps we can continue this voyage across the deadly waves <br />
without further nonsense!&quot; <br />
<br />
A week later they crossed another ship, that while wooden as ship were meant to be, <br />
seemed odd somehow, and the captain aboard simply addressed himself as 'Baron' and had <br />
been perhaps a little -too- polite around Kathrine commenting that she reminded him of a <br />
very dear friend of his. <br />
<br />
<br />
Even eleven years ago when fate had set Marie and the witches on their respective paths, <br />
the puritan's church male numbers were not what they once were. The Praying Town had in <br />
fact been created for the sake of converting the native indians for the sake of increasing <br />
numbers to the puritans.  This of course, had the puritans in Glendale even more <br />
determined to see through the storm. <br />
<br />
Marie was so focused on the witches, she had no clue that the first of four wars between <br />
England and France and different native American tribes would break out that year as she <br />
her group fought Gaal, her sisters, their familiars, and 'converts.'<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;The new family the witched created to be their helpers treat the witches' own 'daughter' <br />
so much like royalty that any other child would have been spoiled rotten, but as I said, this <br />
Joella was no ordinary child, her heart, memories, mind, and perception were all <br />
idealizations.&quot; <br />
<br />
Maddex's heads implored, &quot;BUt what happened to Alvin's family? HIS OWN daughter?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;She'd be born again when Alissa became a woman, married and gave birth to her...&quot;<br />
<br />
Betty shook her head, &quot;But you can't just ERASE people!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;It didn't, it simply pushed her birth foreword over two decades... and yes it did cause <br />
damage to existence. And Alvin's wife was now an adult woman with no husband or child <br />
and would find another man, he wouldn't abuse or harm her, but she'd never be as <br />
remotely happy as she was with a husband she could no longer remember.&quot;  <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Marie thought of her hair. The years she had left it short like a boy should, only to wear it <br />
long again and having to learn the mannerisms that came with being female, which led to <br />
Kathrine and Zoey thinking she was boy sneaking into their group on a dare. Now she was <br />
a nun, and cutting her hair short was naturally expected of her. Of course Kathrine had <br />
done the same thing (unlike female leoman, female felmen were not 'bald') but for Kathrine <br />
it was a new experience (hair length was another thing dictated by felman tradition).  The <br />
last time she had worn her hair this short, it was when she had met three little girls in her <br />
dreams who wanted simply to be hers and Mutt's friend. Before the giant crow had <br />
appeared in her dream and had kept them apart. The crow who had reminded Marie Cruz <br />
of her foster father. <br />
<br />
&quot;I will bring justice to those brides of Satan.&quot; Marie Cruz said under her breath. <br />
<br />
&quot;And for the record, though no one in the party knew it, the final battle with the witches <br />
happened on the anniversary of when Marie's parents, and those of the witches, were <br />
killed. Marie's by lunatics who want to pull all of Spain into a never ending plague, and the <br />
witch's of course by perfectly honest and decent people who gave into their fear and <br />
paranoia. It had begun with Golgotha and Marie, and it would end with the two of them.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;And they would use the drugs then?&quot; Lawrence asked. <br />
<br />
Glass Marie tilted her little blond head, &quot;Yes, and no. the witches had made several <br />
defenses for themselves to prevent themselves from being murdered like their <br />
grandmother had. And had placed similar protective Geass' around Joella. No throwing <br />
knife or dart, made of iron or otherwise, could penetrate their defenses. Marie and her four <br />
comrades learned that the hard way.&quot; <br />
<br />
Lilly nodded vigorously, &quot;Oh that's right! Marie met the fourth witch hunter when she <br />
landed in the new world!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes. And Marie found she'd have some detective work trying to pin down where Glendale <br />
was.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But what was that you said? About no typical weapon would get through their protection?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No it wouldn't. As I said, after they learned that the hard way... Marie remembered what <br />
she had read, asked questions, became a grave robber, and made a set of throwing knives <br />
carved out of the bones of a very particular old woman's grave.&quot;<br />
<br />
+++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;Should we put these on display again?&quot; The gargoyle Library asked his Lupman companion <br />
in the basement of the Glendale museum. <br />
<br />
&quot;The ivory throwing knives?&quot; She asked, or everyone assumed they had been elephant <br />
ivory,  &quot;Maybe, it's a fifty-fifty shot, people will either want to know about the game, or <br />
pretend even harder it doesn't exist, could go either way.&quot;</p>
