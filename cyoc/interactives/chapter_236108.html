<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Marco lingered in the bathroom, the afterglow of his funtime in the shower sending shivers of pleasure through his teenage body. He marveled at his son’s lean, muscular body. His reflection stared back at him, youthful and full of potential. The strength in his arms, the smoothness of his skin—it felt like he had rolled back time. He grinned, flexing one more time in the mirror, admiring the way the muscles moved under his skin.<br />
<br />
“This… this isn’t so bad,” Marco muttered to himself. He had always joked about wishing he were younger, but now, standing here, looking like a teenager again, the idea of going back to his old body seemed less and less appealing. He missed the energy, the freedom, the lack of aches and pains. The more he thought about it, the more he realized that he didn’t want to go back to being a fat, hairy, middle-aged man. Let Carl be the dad, he thought. I&#39;ll be he&#39;ll enjoy it more than I ever did.<br />
<br />
As those thoughts swirled in his mind, the lights in the bathroom flickered. A cold wind blew in, making the hair on the back of his neck stand up. Marco’s eyes darted around the room, confusion and fear prickling at the edges of his consciousness.<br />
<br />
“Who&#39;s there?” he called, stepping back from the mirror.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, the reflection in the mirror shifted. The room in the reflection darkened, and a shadowy figure appeared behind him, its face a horrific skull masked in shadow. The figure stepped forward, towering over Marco’s reflection, the air growing colder with each passing second. It was him—Lord Skullface, the interdimensional villain that those teenage superheroes had fought and defeated countless times. But what was he doing here?<br />
<br />
“Greetings, Marco,” Lord Skullface hissed, his voice dripping with malice. “Enjoying your new body, I see?”<br />
<br />
Marco froze, his heart pounding. “W-what… what do you want?” His young sounding voice trembled.<br />
<br />
“I’ve been watching you,” Skullface continued, his skeletal grin widening. “You’ve tasted youth again, and I can sense how much you crave to keep it. To never return to that sasquatch body again. Am I wrong?”<br />
<br />
Marco hesitated, his mind racing. How did Skullface know what he’d been thinking? Could he really see into his thoughts? His gut churned, but there was no denying it—he did want to stay young.<br />
<br />
“I can give you what you desire,” Skullface whispered, his voice curling around Marco’s mind like a snake. “You never have to go back to that broken body. You can stay like this—strong, lean, powerful. Forever.”<br />
<br />
Marco blinked, the temptation tugging at him. He had responsibilities, but… the idea of never having to feel the aches and fatigue of middle age again was intoxicating. “What’s the catch?” he asked warily.<br />
<br />
Lord Skullface’s hollow eyes gleamed with sinister delight. “All I ask is that you serve me. You see, Marco, the transformation remote you’ve stumbled upon holds great power. Power that can cause chaos. And I love chaos. You will use it to switch the bodies of fathers and sons, just as you and Carl were switched. Confusion, disorder—it weakens the bonds of family, creates chaos in the lives of my enemies. Do this for me, and I will make sure you remain as you are, forever young.”<br />
<br />
Marco stared at his reflection, his heart pounding. He didn’t want to cause trouble for people, but the thought of going back to his old, tired body filled him with dread. Could he really pass up the chance to stay like this, even if it meant working for Skullface?<br />
<br />
Seeing the hesitation in Marco’s eyes, Skullface leaned closer, his voice like a poisoned whisper. “Imagine the freedom. You could live Carl’s life, experience youth again without the burdens of your past. You’ll never feel old again, never suffer the weight of age. And all it takes is a little obedience. You’ve already seen how easy it is to switch bodies. All you need to do is use the remote—target fathers and sons. It’s that simple.”<br />
<br />
Marco’s mind raced, the temptation overwhelming. Stay young? Stay strong? The idea gnawed at him. He knew it was wrong, but the pull of youth, the thrill of a second chance, was too great. Furthermore, he was ashamed to admit it, but the very thought of switching more guys&#39; bodies was exciting to him. His teenage cock, spent only minutes ago, popped up to attention at the thought of watching his victims discovering they&#39;d be body swapped.<br />
<br />
He took a deep breath, staring into the empty sockets of Lord Skullface’s face. “Alright,” Marco said, his voice firm. “I’ll do it.”<br />
<br />
Skullface’s grin widened, his voice filled with dark satisfaction. “Excellent. You will bring chaos to their lives, and I will reward you beyond your wildest dreams.”<br />
<br />
With that, Skullface’s reflection vanished, leaving Marco standing alone, staring at his youthful body in the mirror. His heart thumped in his chest, a mix of excitement and dread swirling inside him. He checked to make sure his middle-aged son was still finishing up in the master bathroom, then snuck back to Carl&#39;s lab.<br />
<br />
He picked up the transformation remote. It hummed in his hands, the power contained within it now feeling like a tool he was meant to wield.<br />
<br />
“This is it,” Marco muttered, a determined look on his son’s face. He had made his choice. From now on, he would swap fathers and sons wherever he could, creating confusion and chaos. He’d stay young, and he’d make sure no one could stop him.<br />
<br />
And so, Marco began his mission, using the remote to target unsuspecting families—transforming fathers into their sons, and sons into their fathers, leaving a trail of confusion in his wake. Each swap filled him with a sense of twisted satisfaction, knowing that with each act of mischief, his youth—and his allegiance to Skullface—would be secured. But where to start?</p>
