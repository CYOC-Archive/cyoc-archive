<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Matt's belly had started to rumble and knew he had to take a piss. It must've been that slob they served at dinner call yesterday before he met Theo. &quot;Theo, mind if you turn around for a bit. Nature calls.&quot; &quot;Actually, I need to take a piss also.&quot; Theo quickly rushed over, unzipped his pants, and let loose. &quot;Scoot over.&quot;, said Matt before unzipping his fly as well. &quot;Ahh.. It feels great once you let it all loose doesn't it?&quot; said a relieved Matt. Theo didn't reply, instead his attention was towards Matt's semi-flacid uncut penis. It was rather big, and looked about 5.2in currently. Theo wondered how it would look fully erect and his face blushed at the thought. <br />
<br />
He looked down and began to examine his own cut penis. It's beer can circumference and excellent girth matched Theo's size and appearance. However what may have excelled in width, it lacked in length. It looked slightly smaller compared to Matt's penis. &quot;That's a fine looking member you got there, bud.&quot; said, Theo. Matt egotistically smirked and looked at Theo's penis. &quot;Heh, you go around telling that to other inmates?,&quot; asked Matt. Theo's face turned a beat read. Matt then gazed at Theo's penis. He could already smell Theo's raunchy member in the air. Each wiff caused Matt's own penis to slowly erect. His tongue longed for Theo's delicious cock. &quot;Yous got yourself a mighty fine one there too, bud.&quot;, said Matt in a strangely deep southern baritone voice. Matt freaked at the sudden change in voice and frighteningly pulled himself away from the toilet accidentally wetting his boxers with his urine in the process. &quot;Dang, nabbit!&quot; Matt yelled. His voice was beginning to crack. &quot;Fetch me a pair of your boxers will ya?&quot; &quot;You sure? Y'know they're all dirty.&quot;, said Theo as he zipped himself up. &quot;I rather have somethin' dry then wet. C'mon now git goin'&quot;, demanded Matt still talking in a southern accent. <br />
<br />
Theo walked towards the clothing pile and tossed him the first boxer-briefs he seen. Matt instantly took a long wiff of it. The combined smell of Theo's sweat, dirty ass, and piss still lingered and pleased him greatly. Theo saw Matt was beginning to precum, and started to get a hard on himself. &quot;UUUwee son! Now, that's what I call a musk.&quot; Matt knew what he was saying. He realized he was slowly turning into some dirty country bumpkin, and was liking it to. Theo was starting to become concerned. &quot;What's with the sudden change, bud? Just yesterday you looked all disgusted when around me.&quot; Matt ignored him, and completely took off his prior pants and boxers. After kicking them aside, Matt felt a coarse field of body hair on his rear and lower back and began scratching his ass. Theo swallowed his own saliva and started to sweat with nervousness as his arousal increased. <br />
<br />
As Matt slid on the dirty boxers, he noticed he also had grown a fine sheet of black hair along his feet as well. They looked just as, if not, more hairier then Theo's feet. Matt was estatic and wiggled his toes in delight. &quot;Thanks for the whities, bud!&quot; &quot;N-no prob.&quot;, replied a highly aroused Theo. Matt cupped his erect penis in his now dirty boxers, reached down in them gave himself a nice long scratch and a loud burp. &quot;I reckon' I really be lookin' like ya's now, huh?&quot;, said Matt. Theo blushed at Matt with an awkward look on his face.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, Matt toppled over in pain as his mind was filled with vasts images of Theo. He collapsed on the ground and covered his head with his increasingly lanate hands. &quot;Urrgh!&quot; Matt screamed. Theo rushed to Matt's side on the floor &quot;Hey, bud! Tell me what the hell is going on!?&quot; &quot;I--I d-don't know.. Al-All of it just..!!&quot; Matt instantly saw a vision in his mind of Theo alone in his bed at night in a prayer stance. He saw and heard Theo tearfully wish to be loved by someone. Someone who could appreciate him for who he is. Someone who'll protect him and Someone he wanted to protect. Matt became touched as Theo prayed and wished with all his might that night. He now fully understood why he was changing as he really was the first and only one to show affection to Theo during his time in prison. The visions brought forth fully connected him with Theo's will. After a long brief in silence, Matt made up his mind, and decided to fully fulfill Theo's wish. &quot;Alrighty, big guy. You win.&quot;, and with that Matt's mind started to return to normal. <br />
<br />
Matt awoken in his bunk bed, and saw a crying Theo lying across his legs. He brought forth his hand and caressed Theo's shaggy head. &quot;M-matt..?&quot; he cried. &quot;Don't cha worry big guy, Matt's still here wit' ya's.&quot; Relieved, Theo gave Matt a big bear hug and silently teared on his shoulders. &quot;Hey, didn't I tell ya's to stop that cryin'?&quot; &quot;I know, but I'm so glad you're okay, Matt. (*sniff) Can we stay like this for just a little while longer?&quot; Matt smiled. &quot;Haha. Fine fine..&quot; Matt returned the favor and passionately caressed Theo. He was now Theo's and Theo was now his.<br />
<br />
They slowly separated themselves after a long intimacy. &quot;Your stubble is getting darker, bud.&quot;, said Theo. &quot;Yea'.. I know. Hey bud, do ya remember's makin' a wish one night 'bouts bein', y'know loved?&quot; &quot;Erm, somewhat.&quot; &quot;Heheh, well hold on to your tailhide partner'cause get what, your wish came true.&quot; Theo wondered what he was talking about, but then it finally hit him. &quot;Jesus, seriously!? No way!&quot; Matt nodded proudly. &quot;Uh-huh! Yep. I'm quite enjoyin' the change to.&quot; Theo moved his big hand and placed it upon Matt's hairy hand. &quot;Don't be shy, bud. I'm yours now.&quot; <br />
<br />
Theo blushed, move closer to Matt's head and give him a long passionate french kiss. Matt equally returned the favor. The lustrous bitterness of the others mouth combined with the highly fluid motion of their tongues caused both men to completely succumb to their ecstasy. Matt could feel himself slowly changing as he wrapped his arms around his partners. Matt's stubble completely developed into a wiry and shaggy beard and could feel their saliva being dripped upon it. His black hair completely receded into his head, become as smooth as a fresh bowling ball. The jet black hair on his arm's became increasingly thicker. It's growth progressed along Matt's shoulders connecting the hair with his wiry new back hair. A crisp tattoo of their name's appeared together along his shoulder. Matt could feel Theo rub along his now forest of a chest as Theo discarded Matt's sweaty tank top. He rubbed his face down Matt's chest, taking in every inch of Matt's new sweaty musk. Matt could feel his chest expanding with fat and muscle; his belly becoming rounder and rounder shifting into a hirsute, but firm and durable gut. Theo unzipped Matt's pants springing up his fully erect and hairy uncut penis dripping with precum. Theo began sucking on Matt's sinewy cock like a child sucking on a lollipop. Matt laid one of his hairy hands on the back of mat's head encouraging his gratitude as he scratched and rubbed his new belly with the other. Matt's boxer's completely dominated Theo's previous scent and reeked of Matt's own precum, sweat, and ass which enthralled both men. His leg's became flushed with black hair and expanded to match his new girth. Matt's hairy feet widened and grew to a size slightly shy of Theo's foot size. Matt took a good wiff in the air and was loving the smell of his newfound foot odor. Matt's long armpit hair could be seen creeping out from his sides, as his stench completely enveloped the cell. Matt was smelling just as bad as his partner now and was loving it. Flies began flying around the malodorous men, but they didn't care. Matt also knew he had aged several years, bumping his age to 20. He's still registered as 14 with the prison though. <br />
<br />
Their relationship became widely known throughout the prison. They often got into fights with others prisoners because of the way they smelled. Nevertheless, Matt would always be there to defend Theo and Theo was always be there to defend Matt. Regrettably rumor has it that they were forcibly separated from each other and were transferred to different prisons, much to their dismay.</p>
