<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The sound of expensive shoes clattering on a concrete floor drew Steve back to reality.  Looking up towards the center’s open door, Steve saw a tall, muscular, and, if the brilliant red mane surrounding his head was any indication, very manly anthro lion run out of a door inside the center and turn towards him.<br />
<br />
Whereas the other anthros that Steve had seen – including himself – were all wearing nothing more than a slave collar, this one was dressed in an expensive business suit.  Not to mention that he was a man.  Steve felt something, like his body somehow recognized this person, and Steve knew that the lion was somehow different from other anthros.<br />
<br />
“Hey you!” the lion yelled as he ran towards Steve, “do you know anything about…”  The lion didn’t get to finish his sentence as he began gagging and pinched his nose shut.<br />
<br />
“Ughhh… I’m…” the lion gagged before his eyes scanned along the white stripe that ran down Steve’s back.  “Oh you’re… you’re a skunk.  I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to…”<br />
<br />
The lion seemed to suck in his gut and he whispered to himself, “be strong Leon, you can do this.”  Despite that chant, Steve could see a small beads of moisture forming in the lion’s irritated eyes, but that didn’t stop Leon from letting go of his nose, standing up straight, and fighting through the skunk stench that permeated the air.<br />
<br />
“I know this is going to sound weird and… look this whole situation is crazy but… do you know anything about giving birth?”  Leon said with an obvious tone of exasperation.<br />
<br />
No!  Of course I don’t!  Why would you think I do?  That’s what Steve wanted to say, but as he looked at the lion that was towering over him, the meek, submissive words that emanated from Steve’s mouth were, “yes master.”<br />
<br />
Leon told Steve to follow him, and while that was the last thing that Steve wanted to do, he nonetheless felt his body trying to obey.  The first thing that it did was to shift its butt down to the ground, so that Steve was sitting upright while he rested on his shins.  But despite its efforts, the imbalance of weight meant that his body wasn’t able to stand.<br />
<br />
“Do you need help?”  Steve’s body nodded as the lion walked over to him, and Steve felt a massive, furry arm wrap around his back and then press up into his armpit.  With a heave, the lion pulled Steve up into a standing position and there was a burst of pressure inside of one of Steve’s breasts as the lion’s hand cupped around it.<br />
<br />
Steve wanted to cry out, but his body remained silent.  Nonetheless, the lion had obviously noticed his fingers pressing into milk filled flesh.  “I’m sorry,” Leon said as he scanned over Steve’s chest, looking in vain for another, more socially acceptable place that he could grip onto it.  Not finding it, Steve heard the lion whisper, “you have to get her inside.”  <br />
<br />
Steve’s squished breast wasn’t his only problem either, as he felt the skin on the upper part of his belly stretched thin by the weight it was now supporting in his fully upright stance.  With the sense that his belly was about to rip its way off his body, Steve clasped the bottom of it with his hands, providing enough support that he felt the tension on his skin subside.<br />
<br />
With that, Steve found himself walking along as the lion supported his body – despite which Steve could feel his heart pounding as he took deep, panting breaths.  He’d barely made it to the door before Steve found himself completely out of breath.  Steve was absolutely exhausted, but this was a different kind of exhaustion from the high he’d experienced earlier.<br />
<br />
For all of Steve’s panting, and as hard as his heart was beating, he just wasn’t able to take in enough oxygen to supply the needs of both himself and the baby inside of him.  The placenta connecting him to the baby was draining the life out of his blood and feeding it the baby instead.  His body might have been designed to breed, but it was never intended to grow whatever was inside of him.  Just by merely existing, his body was already at its limit.  Walking, even with the lion supporting him, was just too much.<br />
<br />
Steve’s panting wasn’t lost on the lion either.  Looking down at Steve’s belly, he asked, “are you in labor too?”<br />
<br />
“No master.”  <br />
<br />
Why?  Why was Steve answering this person’s questions, and why was Steve calling him ‘master’?  Why couldn’t Steve control his body, why couldn’t he…?<br />
<br />
Slave.  The word flashed through Steve’s mind as he began to fully comprehend just what it meant.  There hadn’t looked like there were many changes when Austin had turned into a slave earlier, but now Steve realized that wasn’t true.  The app had decided to give that word meaning by making changes to Austin, it’s just that those changes were mental instead of physical.<br />
<br />
Austin couldn’t read either, Steve knew, but that wasn’t something that had come up before Austin had found himself as a herself with an oversized baby wedged halfway into her vagina.  And while Austin the birthing slave was completely obedient to her master, her master hadn’t been there earlier – hell, her master hadn’t even existed earlier.  Lacking that, Austin had been able to exercise her own willpower – at least for the limited time she’d remained childfree.<br />
<br />
With the most recent change that Steve had made, he’d given the app more than enough leeway to bring the breeding slaves’ master into reality.  This very masculine lion wasn’t dressed in a nice suit for no reason, he was the slaves’ owner – he was Steve’s owner.  <br />
<br />
And, Steve knew, he was an obedient slave.</p>
