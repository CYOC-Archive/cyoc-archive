<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jason walked out of the classroom as onto the large parking lot. He just had PE during the previous period, and he was thirsty.<br />
<br />
“Water!” he panted, as he approached the water fountain that was standing near the entrance to the parking lot, close to the entrance to both schools. “Man, the heat is killing me…”<br />
<br />
The short, stocky boy finally made it to the fountain, where he leaned over and actually go on his toes. He then turned the big, metal knob, which was on the side of the fountain, so that the cold water would come from the spout on the far left side of the water fountain.<br />
<br />
“Ahhhh…” he said, as he stuck out his tongue, allowing the water to pour over it. Jason took in several gulps of water, before he held both hands under the spout and finally splashed some of the water over his face as well. He got his face and his hair wet in the process, but he didn’t mind it at all. It was refreshing!<br />
<br />
Jason was about nine years old, and he was only in third grade. He was short and chubby, and he had a little bit of fat on him. He called it baby fat, but the truth was, he loved to eat ice cream. He loved it a bit too much, and he had gained a few pounds over the past few months. <br />
<br />
“Ahh… That was good…” he grinned, as he wiped the excess water from his mouth with his elbow. Then, he turned around, and started to walk out towards the street. He didn’t have any homework for the day, and he was ready to spend the rest of the afternoon at home, playing video games, riding his bike or his skateboard, or just hanging out with his best friend Jamie from across the street. It was the weekend, and he really didn’t have anything else to do. The only thing that was slowing him down a little bit was his weight, and his mother had been nagging him about it for the past three weeks. <br />
<br />
As he started to walk away from the fountain, he was overcome with an odd sensation, which started to creep through every muscle in his body. <br />
<br />
“Uhh… I feel kinda funny… “He thought to himself, as the strange feeling increased in intensity. What was going on?<br />
<br />
Suddenly, he felt his fat melt away! Every ounce of fat that he had on him started to fade from his belly and from his arms and his legs. Not only that, but his he started to become skinnier… Or was he?<br />
<br />
“Hey! What… What’s happening????” he gasped, as he continued to notice the changes.<br />
<br />
Next, he began to feel an increased stiffness in his muscles… And it spread to just about every single muscle in his entire body!<br />
<br />
“Uhhhhh…. Oh man! I can barely move! My muscles hurt! What’s going on?” he groaned, as the soreness increased. <br />
<br />
Then, without warning, every muscle in his muscle began to inflate, all at once! His pectorals grew by several inches, jutting out forward and sideways, making his chest grow wider as well. His arms grew thicker, like mighty pythons, and his biceps hardened into huge bowling balls of power. His abdominals popped up over his flat stomach, covering his torso like a cobblestone road. And his delts and traps rose up all around his neck, forming mighty round spheres of muscle that surrounded his shoulders. <br />
<br />
“Oh my God…” the boy gasped, as he began to feel the increased strength coursing through his short, little body. <br />
<br />
“I must be dreaming!” he wondered out loud, as he noticed his biceps.<br />
<br />
Finally, his quads widened as new layers of muscle sprouted on both legs, making him wider and thicker and deeper, all at once! Huge ropes of long, thick veins covered his legs as well, as his calves inflated to the point where it seemed where they were like balloons which were being filled with air from a pump. <br />
<br />
“Oh man! I look like a muscle man!” Jason shouted, as he looked down and noticed how muscular he had become. The boy now resembled a young gymnast or a junior bodybuilder. His t-shirt and shorts fit him incredibly tight, by the way. He wasn’t overly huge, but his clothes had definitely gotten too small for him.<br />
<br />
“Wow! What is mom gonna say when I get home?” he wondered, as he started to run home. “No more nagging about me having to lose weight!”<br />
<br />
Jason ran home, and couldn’t wait to check out his reflection in the mirror. But, he also wondered what had caused his unusual growth spurt. Then it dawned on him, that it must have been the water from the fountain. He would call one of his friends and tell them about it, as soon as he would have gotten home. In the meantime, he was going to enjoy his new life as a muscle boy…</p>
