<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Pete woke with the early morning sun gently flittering through the office window across onto his body. Yawning, he rubbed his neck and glanced around the room in a half-stupor. Pete suddenly realised where he was and what had happened the previous night. It couldn't be true; here, in the day light, it seemed so bizarre. Just to be safe, Pete spied through the window, but the work place was empty. He opened his office door cautiously and stepped outside. Pete knelt down to the ground; the dirt had a large imprint of a person in it, exactly where the police man had transformed the other night...<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; Peter told himself, &quot;It's not true...it can't be...&quot; But, laying in the bushes just off the path was a belt that had been stretched badly, the buckle snapped apart at a strange angle. Pete realised what had happened now. Those guys in Speedos; the police man turned into one after he was bitten...<br />
&quot;So,&quot; he thought, &quot;the police can't do anything to stop them. Well, I'm not going to allow those Speedo Fags to just wander through my town, changing people as they see fit...&quot;<br />
Pete got up, tossed the belt into the bushes and hurried home.<br />
<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, in the woods just outside of town, three men woke up to the twittering of birds. Grasping about to get himself up, Jim slowly stood up, taking him a moment to realise that both he and the other two men were both wearing only their underwear. <br />
&quot;Shit,&quot; he mumbled as he placed his hands over the slight erection he had pressing against his black briefs. He recognised the one wearing blue boxer shorts as his friend Cameron from work, but the other guy who was wearing red briefs was a stranger to him.<br />
Cameron glanced around. &quot;Where are we? Where are our clothes?&quot; he asked.<br />
The stranger looked around. &quot;Hey, this is just on the outskirts of the town, I've been through this part before.&quot; The man glanced around, noticing the other two giving him a strange look.<br />
&quot;Sorry, I'm Tom, a police officer back in town,&quot; he offered his hand forward.<br />
&quot;I'm Cameron, but my friends call me Cam,&quot; Cameron replied, shaking Tom's hand.<br />
&quot;And I'm Jim. Cam and I work down at a construction site in town,&quot; Jim said, lifting one hand away from his crotch to shake hands with Tom. <br />
&quot;The construction site?&quot; Tom asked. &quot;Oh, I remember, I was called up last night to go inspect a construction site. I remember arriving there, but then I...I...I forget.&quot; He scratched the hairs on his chest and yawned widely.<br />
&quot;Hey, I was there too...&quot; Jim spoke up. &quot;I heard some noises coming from the building, and I went inside and then...crap,&quot; he smiled sheepishly. &quot;My memory kinda fades away there,&quot; Jim shrugged.<br />
Cameron suddenly had a flash in his memory.<br />
&quot;Speedos...a guy wearing Speedos...no, two of them. Maybe three,&quot; he muttered. &quot;They must have knocked us out or something and dragged us out here for God know's why.&quot;<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Tom responded. &quot;I DO remember two guys tackling me to the floor...&quot; <br />
&quot;I think we should just get out of here,&quot; Jim suggested nervously. The other two nodded in agreement. Tom stepped forward.<br />
&quot;I think we should go...ahhh!&quot; he cried as he tripped over the tree root jutting through the soil, plummeting into the bushes. <br />
&quot;What the hell?&quot; Tom said, raising a blue police shirt from the tangled branches. &quot;Hey, this is mine...&quot; he grumbled as he noticed that all the buttons were missing and large rips had torn through the sleeves. Tom slipped the shirt over his back and glanced around, something nagging at the back of his mind.<br />
&quot;Oh God no...&quot; he moaned. &quot;Oh no no no no...&quot; Tom sat down on the floor, feeling faint.<br />
&quot;What? What is it?&quot; Cameron asked.<br />
&quot;It...it was us!&quot; Tom mumbled as he spread his arms out like he had the other night when he embraced the two Speedo Men. He looked up at Cameron and Jim. Although they looked slightly older now and more bedraggled, their was no mistaking it; the three Speedo Fags had been them all along.<br />
<br />
 <br />
&quot;But...but how?&quot; Jim asked, realisation setting in.<br />
&quot;I think it may have been me...&quot; Cameron muttered ashamedly. &quot;It's my fault...something happened the other night at this party I went to. I didn't take any notice of it at the time, but it's a little late now. I'm so sorry,&quot; he murmured to the other two.<br />
&quot;Nah, it's okay,&quot; Jim smiled, placing an arm around Cameron's shoulder comfortingly. &quot;You didn't know what you were doing; none of us did...&quot; Jim looked down his bare arm draped over Cameron's back.<br />
&quot;Shit! I think...well...I think we...erm...&quot;did it&quot; last night. As in us. All of us,&quot; Jim moaned.<br />
&quot;No, it wasn't us. We weren't in control. I've dealt with something similar with split personalities before. It's not our fault for what happened,&quot; Tom said, reassuring both the other two men and himself.<br />
&quot;I think we should go back to my place,&quot; Tom suggested. &quot;It's pretty close to here so we won't have to walk through town half naked. We can decide from there what to do next.&quot;<br />
<br />
Several minutes walk later, Jim, Cameron and Tom arrived at Tom's place, a moderately sized house in a (to their relief) quiet street. Tom slid open a window at the side of the house and clambered through. <br />
&quot;Go around the back,&quot; he told the others. &quot;I'll let you in.&quot;<br />
Cameron and Jim shot looks stealthily over their shoulders behind them towards the street, making sure the coast was clear. They climbed over the fence, Jim's briefs sliding uncomfortably into his ass at the top, causing Cameron to laugh hysterically as he fell into the backyard. A large husky ran over and licked Cameron on the face.<br />
&quot;Cut it out,&quot; Tom ordered as he pulled the dog back. &quot;Rover here likes to play with strangers. Stupid dog,&quot; he laughed as he pushed the large husky aside. <br />
&quot;C'mon in,&quot; Tom invited. Cameron and Jim stepped into a long hallway that stretched to the front of the house. Jim looked down at a table positioned near the door. A photograph of Tom and a boy in his mid-teens were smiling at him. <br />
&quot;That's my son, Ben,&quot; Tom told Jim, noticing him looking at the picture. <br />
&quot;Made your wife take the picture, huh?&quot; Jim joked.<br />
&quot;No, she left Ben and I several years ago,&quot; Tom replied.<br />
&quot;Sorry,&quot; Jim said quickly, &quot;I didn't know...&quot;<br />
&quot;Nah, it's okay. Ben's at school now; he can take care of himself okay when his old man isn't at home. Okay, let's get some clothes on.&quot; Tom pointed out his room and they filed in. <br />
<br />
Within minutes, each was wearing slightly faded jeans over their underwear and a loose t-shirt.<br />
&quot;So,&quot; Cameron began, &quot;What do we do now?&quot; <br />
&quot;Well, if the transformation thing was a one time thing, we should be okay...&quot; Tom suggested.<br />
&quot;Yeah, but if it is some kind of werewolf like transformation, then it could happen again,&quot; Jim responded.<br />
&quot;Werewolf?&quot; Cameron asked. &quot;We didn't become dogs or anything. We became guys...wearing Speedos...&quot; he finished uncomfortably.<br />
&quot;The same principles might apply...I mean, we barely know anything about this transformation we go through; for all we know, it could be the same, or even completely different,&quot; Jim said.<br />
&quot;Jim's right,&quot; Tom said. &quot;But it's probably best we don't go around proclaiming our transformation just yet. People generally don't like to accept things they don't understand. We'd better keep this under our hats for now.&quot; Cameron and Jim nodded in agreement.<br />
&quot;Well, even though all three of us are &quot;hip bachelors&quot;, we had better go have a rest in our own beds for a bit and meet later,&quot; Cameron suggested with a slight laugh. So, Jim and Cameron returned to their house in which they both lived in after trading phone numbers with Tom. <br />
Collapsing in exhaustion, Cameron fell onto his bed and drifted into sleep, still wearing the clothes Tom had given him.<br />
<br />
Several hours later, Cameron woke to the sound of his phone ringing.<br />
&quot;Hello?&quot; he asked groggily into the receiver.<br />
&quot;Hey Cam, it's Pete here. Listen, you are not going to believe this...&quot; he began. Cameron listened as Pete described how he was cornered in his office by two Speedo clad assailants and had turned a police man into one of &quot;Them&quot;, each word bringing more and more clarity to Cameron's memories. <br />
&quot;Now you know me. I'm not the type of guy to lie or kid around like this. I'm being deadly serious, and I want you and Jim to join me and some others in putting a stop to them. The police wouldn't listen if they heard this story, and even if they did believe us, they aren't exactly much help. I think this gang can turn anyone into one of &quot;Them&quot;...So? Are you in?&quot; Pete concluded.<br />
&quot;What will we...erm...be doing to these Speedo Men?&quot; Cameron asked cautiously.<br />
&quot;We'll get 'em locked up in this cage I've had for a while. Then, we'll teach them to trap me in my damn office...&quot; Pete replied with a hollow laugh. Cameron gulped slightly. It was extremely hard to reason with Pete when he had his mind set on something, and if he didn't offer to help them catch, well, himself, he knew it would only make matters worse.<br />
&quot;Yeah, I guess Jim and I could help; should we just go over to your house now?&quot; Cameron asked.<br />
&quot;Yep, a few other guys are already here. I wanted to wait for you two to get here before we started &quot;debriefing,&quot; Pete answered with a laugh. <br />
Cameron suddenly had a brain wave. &quot;Hey, is it alright if I bring a friend? You haven't met him, but me and him...er...go way back,&quot; Cameron lied.<br />
&quot;Sure,&quot; Pete invited. &quot;More the merrier.&quot;<br />
<br />
Half an hour later, Cameron, Tom and Jim were driving to Pete's house. <br />
&quot;Why the HELL are we going to this thing?&quot; Tom asked angrily. &quot;I thought we were going to try to be a little quiet about it until we know a little more about it.&quot;<br />
&quot;We are,&quot; Cameron responded. &quot;But if these guys are going to come after us, it's going to be better if we know exactly what we are up against.&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh...&quot; Tom muttered, as he realised their plan. &quot;Still, this Pete guy may not know you two are Speedo Men, but he saw me transform! Once I walk into that place, they're going to freaking jump me!&quot; <br />
&quot;Hopefully Pete will have been too beside himself to recognise you as the police officer he saw last night. We'll just say you are a banker or something.&quot; <br />
Tom shrugged as he slumped back into his seat, moments later arriving at Pete's house.<br />
<br />
Pete greeted them at the door. &quot;Come on in to our &quot;vigilante&quot;!&quot; he invited with a laugh, shooting a quick look into the street as if half expecting a Speedo clad man to jump out of no-where.<br />
&quot;Hey, Jim; hi Cam. And you must be Tom, put 'er there,&quot; Pete said, offering his hand warmly. Smiling weakly, Tom shook his hand. <br />
&quot;You look awfully familiar,&quot; Pete suddenly said as he looked over Tom.<br />
&quot;Oh, Tom's a banker; you probably saw him in the bank some time,&quot; Jim said, a little too fast to be at a normal pace.<br />
&quot;Okay then,&quot; Pete grinned as he led them down to the basement of the house. <br />
<br />
&quot;Tom, this is Matt, Carl and Greg,&quot; Pete introduced, pointing to three men who all appeared to be wearing work men's clothes even though it was a Sunday. All three nodded &quot;Hello&quot; in Tom's direction to which he waved back weakly.<br />
&quot;Let's get down to business,&quot; Pete ordered loudly as they all fell silent.<br />
&quot;I suppose you are all aware now as to why I gathered us here. We need to take immediate action to stop this...whatever the bloody hell it is...before it spins out of control. I want us guys to go out tonight and patrol the streets for any sign of these Speedo Men, and if you do happen to see one, I want you to take him down and tie him up. From what I saw last night, ensure you keep all parts of your body and well covered so as to not allow them to bite you. If they do happen to give you a quick nip, then my friend, you become our enemy and we will deal with you as we would deal with any Speedo Man; with FORCE!!!&quot; <br />
Jim shot a quick look at Cameron, who looked slightly sick. The other guys cheered loudly, Jim, Cameron and Tom doing so, but considerably less enthusiastically.<br />
&quot;At 7 PM,&quot; Pete glanced at his watch, &quot;an hour or so from now, we will arm up and get out there. For now, let's have some fun!&quot; <br />
Tom, Jim and Cameron kept looking nervously out the window at the slowly darknening sky, anticipating a change at any second.<br />
<br />
Finally, 7 o'clock rolled around. Pete gave each of them a pair of blue overalls that they tucked into their boots, and a thick sweater to wear, each with a turtle neck covering the flesh around their necks. <br />
&quot;Nothing special, but if they become too difficult to control, beat them with these,&quot; Pete said as he passed around several black night sticks for each of them to use.<br />
&quot;Don't kill 'em though; bring them back here and lock them in this so we can find out if their little gang is in fact little or not.&quot;<br />
&quot;Pete, do you think we should split up; you know, so we can cover more ground?&quot; Cameron suggested.<br />
&quot;Hmmm...I guess we can all take care of ourselves, I mean, we're all pretty tough. Okay then...we'll each cover a different part of town to make this faster. We'll meet up here at sun rise. Okay everyone, good luck, and be careful.&quot;<br />
<br />
They all filed outside and waved good bye as they went off in different directions, however, Cameron, Jim and Tom remained, smothered in the semi-darkness. <br />
&quot;Anything happening?&quot; Cameron asked, looking over himself.<br />
&quot;Nope. I guess it was a one time thing,&quot; Jim replied in relief.<br />
&quot;Phew...&quot; Tom sighed. &quot;Well, I guess I had better get home then now if this is it. Nice meeting you two.&quot; Cameron and Jim nodded goodbye as Tom started to walk down the street.<br />
&quot;We'd better go pretend we are looking for the Speedo Men then,&quot; Cameron said with a short laugh to Jim. As they turned to leave, they half jumped at a loud clattering sound from behind them.<br />
&quot;Oops!&quot; Tom said, pointing to the black night stick that had slipped out from his pocket and onto the pavement. He bent over forwards to pick it up, raising his ass into the air. Cameron smiled softly as looked at the firm ass tightly pushing against the overalls. He touched Jim softly on the arm and pointed at Tom's rear, causing a small strand of drool to appear in the corner of Jim's mouth. <br />
&quot;Oh God!&quot; Tom suddenly shouted as a tight red Speedo tore through his overalls. He shot upright, furtively rubbing his ass with one hand.<br />
&quot;It's...happening...&quot; me moaned as he felt the soft spandex against his fingers. Jim's mind told him to run, to hide somewhere; but as he made to escape, he tripped over a short hedge onto the grass of a front yard. Slowly stretching upwards, Jim began to moan gently as the change began to claim him. <br />
<br />
Cameron plunged his fingers through the material of both the sweater and the overalls and slowly began to rip them apart at the chest. Tom stumbled across to Cameron as the clothes began to tighten against his skin. As Cameron's still covered crotch neared Tom's Speedo clad ass, the material sprang apart, revealing a throbbing erection stretching the red spandex material tightly. Cameron grabbed Tom's stiff body and thrust his penis into Tom's ass. Tom moaned softly as the tear around his ass slowly began to creep upwards across his back. The lure of youth and muscle was too much for Tom. He couldn't fight it as the hair on his head bleached. Cameron let the overalls slide down past his muscular thighs into a small pile at his boots. Panting, Cameron felt cum seeping from his penis onto Tom who had broken into a sweat.<br />
&quot;My...my...clothes...they're too tight...&quot; Tom mumbled, flexing an arm to show Cameron. The sleeve split wide apart, letting a muscular bicep slide through, followed quickly by the remained of the jumper. As if having a piggy back ride, Cameron pounced onto Tom's back, wrapping his legs around Tom's waist. Tom fell to his knees under the weight of the muscular man riding his back, slowly sliding up and down, the Speedo and penis making his own penis harden. Cameron slowly pulled Tom's overalls down to his legs, pausing for a short time at his crotch and gently rubbing at it, making Tom's penis become even more erect. Cameron draped his body over Tom's shoulder and began to lick at Tom's chest, as his penis came over Tom's back through his tight red Speedo. Tom placed a hand on his own Speedo and slowly began to masturbate through the tight material, cloesly followed by Cameron's hand who placed a hand higher up the throbbing shaft. <br />
<br />
Whilst Tom and Cameron had been embracing the transformation, Jim kept attempting to throw it back, to control it somehow. Sweat was dripping from his body; he kept shooting looks over at the other two progressing through the change. He had gradually worked his jumper out of his overalls in an attempt to cool him down, but the sight of his sweaty abs had only caused himself to grow an enormous erection and make him lose sense of himself. As he sat on his knees, he slowly began to gain control again. His temperature was returning gradually back to normal. Then, Cameron lunged from behind, pulling Jim back to the floor. Cameron nodded at Tom, and they both tilted their heads to the sky and howled softly. Jim's scream echoed back, his whole body quivering violently as the two men leant in and began to bite gently at his bare skin. Jim felt his penis pushing hard against his briefs. He just couldn't fight it any more. The tension building in him could only be quenched when he gave in to them. He screamed again as his penis came, the scream changing gradually into a howl of ecstasy as his briefs tightened beneath his overalls suddenly. Material creaked violently from all directions; in one split second, every seam on Jim's clothing wedged apart by bulging muscles, revealing a tight red Speedo where his black briefs had been moments before. A second later, the clothes had sprang off his body and onto the grass. Tom and Cameron slid closer towards their friend; Tom moving seductively towards Jim's crotch, Cameron gradually sliding his Speedo clad penis up Jim's back, slowly dripping semen onto the skin. Tom nuzzled softly with his mouth at Jim's balls and penis trapped within the Speedo, tasting the cum above the tip of his erect member and sniffing curiously at Jim's crotch, whilst Cameron tilted Jim's head backward and thrust his tongue into Jim's throat, his erected penis softly pushing at Jim's back. But, the thought of the hunt dawned of them: what were they going to do now?<br />
<br />
With the coming of the night, the Speedo Men were back. Just who is hunting who tonight?</p>
