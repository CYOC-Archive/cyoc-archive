<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Larry frowned when he took a look at the mirror in the hospital room. The bite wound on his arm was wrapped up a bit, and he was still feeling a slight bit of ache from it, but otherwise he was not bound up much. But what really got his attention was the scruff. Now, Larry was usually pretty good at grooming, and liked to look good for his sports outings, but today he was looking downright scruffy! He scratched at the light beard hair on his face, noting he looked slightly bleary as he did so. He rubbed his eyes a little and noted his arms were likewise a bit more hairy.<br />
<br />
&quot;And what the fuck...is all of this?&quot; Larry said as he looked at his arms - followed by opening up his hospital gown and looking at his torso, with a deal more hair than usual. He rubbed it as he stood there just to check if it was real. But Larry ultimately decided that as weird as it was, he could just go with it and not worry. After all, he just got attacked by a wolf monster. Who cared if he was a little scruffy after that after all?<br />
<br />
He got back into bed when he heard the sound of footfalls outside, curiously in better detail and from further away than he usually managed. Larry cocked his head a little bit at that detail. He then smiled as the door opened up, &quot;Hey...looks like I was a bit too much to bite off...&quot;<br />
<br />
His girlfriend Clarice ran in and wrapped her arms around him, crying and shaking, &quot;Larry...please...don&#39;t worry me like that again! When they saw your arm, it was in such a horrible condition! And...and somehow it just...you&#39;re amazing, Larry...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know I am babe.&quot; He said, his arms slowly wrapping around her as well.<br />
<br />
The doctor interjected with a cough, a rather thin and wiry man with a black bowl cut and very dark eyes covered by blocky glasses.  &quot;Now...Larry, I understand you feel better than you should, but in my honest opinion you should stay in contact here. In case of any infections or...alternative issues.&quot; He seemed to look outside when he said that, at the spectre of the moon from last night.<br />
<br />
Larry was feeling good outside of that weird ache in his arm, so he was assured in saying, &quot;Nah man, I got this. I got this. I&#39;ll be right as rain in just a few days, and good to go for the football game.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Its not the football game I&#39;d worry about, Larry.&quot; The doctor said in a slightly eerie tone.<br />
<br />
Larry felt like telling the guy to go fuck himself on a curtain rod, but he knew some guys were just awkward like that. And plus it was kind of a dick move to go all aggro on the guy who probably helped nurse you back to health. So Larry just shrugged and asked, &quot;...We good to go?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, you are good to leave the hospital.&quot;<br />
<br />
Larry swore he felt the guy&#39;s eyes on his back, boring through him all the way out of the room, and even further somehow, as if every step of the way he was being watched. Larry almost jumped when he felt a hand on his shoulder, and sighed when he saw it was just his girlfriend trying to de-escalate him, seeing he was wound up. &quot;Larry?&quot; She asked in a concerned tone.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m...I&#39;m fine babe. I&#39;m fine.&quot; He wasn&#39;t fine, but he didn&#39;t want to freak her out over...what? His paranoia over some weirdo doctor with a bad haircut?<br />
<br />
Larry got a cab to the hotel they were staying at, and the rest of the way there Larry swore it was like the old days in high school where some prankster put the itching powder on his clothes. He shifted and rubbed his body in place, pushing his hips and upper body around the whole of the way. All the while Clarice looked remarkably concerned for him the whole way. During the trip, the cab driver told him, &quot;Sir, I&#39;m going to have to ask you to stop...whatever it is you&#39;re doing. It&#39;s rocking around too much.&quot;<br />
<br />
The football player mumbled an apology and he stayed as quiet and still as he could the rest of the way back. Even though he was itching like crazy.<br />
<br />
As they got out Clarice kissed at him to try and calm him down, &quot;Larry? Feeling okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah...&quot; He kissed her back and smiled, figuring he just needed a shower and then he&#39;d be right as rain, &quot;I&#39;m...gonna take a shower when we go into the room. Then I&#39;ll show you how right as rain I&#39;m feeling.&quot; That cocky smile and tilt, with just the right amount of assurance told his girlfriend Larry the Lover was back in.<br />
<br />
But the whole way back to the room, perhaps that had come in a little too much. Larry just from that kiss and interaction went from feeling itchy to feeling almost astonishingly horny. He was doing all he could to stop himself from randomly humping a door in the middle of getting it open, let alone stopping himself from just kissing his girlfriend, pulling at her clothes to get em off and banging her right then and there. His muscles were pulsing with energy and he could barely hold himself back.<br />
<br />
In the midst of going up a flight of stairs, Larry wiped off some sweat from his forehead.<br />
<br />
At the entrance the lady at the front had looked real fuckable. He wanted to just bend her over that fucking desk and bang the prim and proper right out of her. Have her begging for his dick...and then he&#39;d had to remind himself he was happily in a relationship and clear his head.<br />
<br />
And then on the last floor, he&#39;d seen a woman going into a room with her young lover, the two obviously in a mood. Larry had found himself sniffing the air - almost eager to rush in there after. Was this some weird kinda pheromone cologne on the guy or girl?<br />
<br />
He shook his head to clear his memory of these incidents. He was...was with Clarice, and she was all the hot and sexy he needed in his life. By the time they reached the room Larry was worried he&#39;d have an incident from how he was feeling.<br />
<br />
Clarice whispered in his ear, nibbling on it (which almost well set Larry off), &quot;You get in your shower, big guy. I&#39;m gonna go get ready to welcome you back in. Remember to take off the wrappings on that arm before getting steamy...&quot;<br />
<br />
Larry moaned outloud, and he hurried into the bathroom - such that he only really became aware when the door almost crashed shut, and Larry was left standing there in front of the mirror. He breathed, and commenced stripping down.<br />
<br />
Off came the shirt and drawers, off came the wrapping from his arm...and Larry was greeted with quite a sight. His already rippling muscles from football practice and copious exercise looked pumped up even more than usual. Like a good pump at the gym if slightly more. And what was more than that was he almost swore something was off with his skin tone. He also noted with a degree less satisfaction the hair situation;<br />
<br />
Rippling off of his bite area, there was significantly more hair than usual present on Larry&#39;s body. His abdomen had a heavy distribution of it, and he groaned when he saw it. It definitely made his gut even more noticeable to him. He turned and twisted his body in front of the mirror, and saw that it wasn&#39;t just on his front. His back and his ass even had some hair growing there now. He almost wanted to cringe...<br />
<br />
But he decided most likely Clarice would not be minding it all that much. And he really should get to working on that shower. Setting the water to a decently hot level, Larry got in there for his shower, letting out a quick gasp at how good it felt to get some nice hot water on him. He was feeling damn good. And his manhood responded positively to that, starting to erect. He was just excited to get in a fuck so soon after release from the hospital, he told himself.<br />
<br />
Still, how awkwardly horny he was out in the hall was damn weird. Maybe it was just a weird momentary reaction.</p>
