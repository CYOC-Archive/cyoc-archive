<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Zach had been coaxed into entering the arcade by his girlfriend Ophelia, who's main argument was that Zach didn't try anything new and so he consented, if nothing else but just to see what the excitement of the new place in the mall was really about.<br />
<br />
Zach was twenty three and Ophelia was twenty four. He's timed and rather likes his life without excitement, which is why he choose a profession working in an office filing and filling out papers all day. Zach stands just shy of five foot seven, with a receding hair line already and intense green eyes. While Ophelia stands about five foot two and still looks like she did when she was fifteen; pale skin, long brown hair that falls past the middle of her back, with eyes that match her hair colour.<br />
<br />
It was through her work, as a computer analyst, that Zach met her two years ago and the two had been content to let their relationship build rather then truly force anything.<br />
<br />
In the arcade the couple looked around before Ophelia suggested, &quot;Let's try this one,&quot; indicating a round table that had large clear bubble placed on top and was separated down the middle by a screen that was lit up on both sides.<br />
<br />
Seeing that it took quarters and not the money cards offered at the entrance, Zach sat down on one side and began to put quarters into the machine while Ophelia sat on the other side. When the machine asked if it was one or two players, Zach clicked on the two player option. In front of him, the screen lit up and asked a question.<br />
<br />
In the end the game proved rather simplistic, even though the question increased in difficultly each round. The machine asked a question and Zach or Ophelia had to answer it by first hitting a buzzer and clicking on the correct answer. After five rounds, Ophelia was in the lead by two points and when the game ended after the sixth round, the score was one hundred fifty three to one hundred fifty one, Ophelia's favour. Both got and where just about to leave, when a solid clunk from a hatch placed along the bottom of the machine caught Ophelia's attention. Reaching in, she withdrew a medium sized jewelry box.<br />
<br />
Opening it, she gasped when she saw two necklaces lying inside. Looking closer revealed that one was for a male while the other was for a female. Taking the male one out, she handed it to Zach, who mumbled, &quot;Thanks,&quot; and immediately put it on.<br />
<br />
Ophelia took the other necklace, but instead of putting it on, she looked at the band and saw that something was etched into it. Studying it, the couple left and began to make their way through the mall. Outside, they began to make their way through the pedestrian mall and in front of a store advertising lingerie, Ophelia stopped and used the window's reflective properties to put the necklace on a see how it looked.<br />
<br />
In front of her, Zach continued to walk on, lost in his own world. And just as Ophelia put on the other necklace, a ticklish sensation engulfed Zach. Just as quickly as he felt it, the sensation passed and suddenly he found himself looking at Ophelia.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the hell,&quot; he muttered, but caught himself when he realized how high his voice suddenly was. And then he realized that it wasn't Ophelia in front of him, but a reflection.<br />
<br />
Turning, Zach saw the strangest site. It was him, just standing there, looking back. Again he muttered, &quot;What the hell,&quot; and walked over to himself, looking at the man that was in front of him, unsure if what he was seeing was real.<br />
<br />
Ophelia, now in Zach's body, was just as confused. Here she was, looking down at herself, listening to herself speak. Finally she brought herself to speak and in Zach's deep masculine voice she asked, &quot;What just happened here? Suddenly I find myself looking at myself and if I'm not mistaken, I'm Zach. Zach? Is that you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Zach nodded, now ready to believe that what he was seeing was real. Looking at his original body, Zach shrugged her shoulders and replied, &quot;I am not sure what just happened, except that we've some how switched bodies.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well we can't stand here talking about it. Anyone over hears us and they'll think we're crazy or something,&quot; Ophelia answered back.<br />
<br />
Zach nodded and simply said, &quot;Come on,&quot; and began walking.<br />
<br />
It was weird for the two to walk home like this. Zach thought it odd, not only how he walked, with his shoulders and chest leading, but also the way his body felt, especially the way his privates now felt.<br />
<br />
For Ophelia, it was just as well. Suddenly she found she walked with her feet leading and to top it all off, there was the member hanging down in her front. &quot;I wonder how men can live their whole life with their privates exposed like this,&quot; Ophelia thought as they walked, while Zach was also thinking an almost exact question.<br />
<br />
Home, the two began to discuss the possibilities of how they might have switched bodies. The one thing they failed to think that might have to do with it was the necklaces, which both still wore, and was emanating more magick into their bodies, giving them both a youthful exuberant feeling.<br />
<br />
No answer found, the two prepared supper and over dinner they talked about it more. In truth their talks lasted for the rest of the night and it was just when the two had decided to go to bed, that Ophelia asked something that was on her mind.<br />
<br />
Walking over to Zach, Ophelia brought her masculine hand up and caressing Zach's soft face, she asked, &quot;Can I try something while we're like this?&quot;<br />
<br />
Zach looked at her, enjoying the touch of her hand. The feeling that had been building all evening was near bursting and Zach thought he understood what it was. Reaching down with his soft feminine hand, he began to gently pull on the front of the mens slacks Ophelia was wearing. &quot;I think I know what it is and the answers yes,&quot; Zach said in a soft feminine whisper.<br />
<br />
Ophelia smiled, and leaned forward and kissed Zach, who thought, &quot;My god. I'm kissing a man. But it should be okay because I am a woman and the man is actually Ophelia, right?&quot; but no answer came and Ophelia put her hand up Zach shirt and began to gently rub the nipple's on Zach A cup sized breast.<br />
<br />
Moaning with pleasure, Zach allowed Ophelia to lay him down on the bed. And as Ophelia put a condom on over her throbbing hard penis, Zach let himself go with the moment; two naked bodies wrapped together in the throes of hot passionate sex, never mind the fact that one was a man inside a woman's body and the other was a woman inside a man's body. What mattered for the two was the excitement and sensation of taking each other like this.<br />
<br />
Afterward, the two lay together and after a bit, Zach felt the need for a shower. Padding to the bathroom, Zach turned on the light, closed the door and looked into the mirror.<br />
<br />
Yes, Ophelia is five foot two, but her body can only be described as one word; small, bordering on petite. Her waist is a size two, her breasts are a size twenty A, which surprised Zach to learn that Ophelia wore an insert to give herself an extra cup size. Wondering if he had to live the rest of his life in a woman's body, Zach began to explore his new body. Before long, he found himself playing with with the area between the legs, enjoying touching her vulva and as the juices began to flow, Zach experienced what it felt like to Jill off.<br />
<br />
Afterward, Zach took a long, hot shower, feeling more youthful and exuberant the ever, not realizing that these feelings where being brought on by magick still, but also liking the feeling of showering as a woman.<br />
<br />
Back in the bedroom, Zach put on a large, cotton shirt, thinking, &quot;Is everything a woman wears this soft,&quot; while taking off the necklace and laying neck to it's matching pair. Lying down on the bed next to Ophelia, who was already asleep, he snuggled closer, enjoying the strong masculine smell, Zach drifted off to sleep.<br />
------<br />
<br />
Zach awoke with a start, thinking, &quot;What a lovely dream,&quot; and sliding out of bed, made his way to the bathroom. Inside, he pulled down the Hello Kitty pajama pants, no underwear, not really paying attention to anything, still trying to wake up, he sat down on the toilet to pee. It was just as he was reaching for some toilet paper, that Zach realized what he was wearing and what he was doing.<br />
<br />
Scared, he quickly finished up and seeing what he's wearing, he pulls the pajama pants up, quickly washes his hands and rushes back to the room he woke up in.<br />
<br />
Looking around, he doesn't recognize it at first, but then memories start to come back and Zach remembers that his name is Ophelia Skarsg&aring;rd and that she's spending the summer in Greece with her aunt before going off to school at Mrs. Murial's School for Girls here in Greece. Walking over to the mirror hanging on one of the walls, Zach looks in it and gasps at what he sees.<br />
<br />
Reflected back is Ophelia, as she was when she was eleven years old. Puling down her pajama pants Zach looks at the prepubescent body from the waist down, gasps again, kicks off the pajama pants and then removes her shirt. Reflected back is a small, scared looking girl, who looks to be about eight or nine and stands about three foot nine.<br />
<br />
Zach can't be sure, but she thinks that Ophelia said at one time, &quot;I was late bloomer. Didn't enter puberty until I was about twelve and didn't have my first menstrual cycle until I was nearly fourteen.&quot;<br />
<br />
Looking about, Zach found Ophelia's dresser, and as she pulled articles of clothes from it, Zach thought, &quot;How'd I get myself into this one and how do I get out,&quot; while she dressed. Somewhere else in the house, the two other girls - Lottie, a human/blue dragon hybrid, and Clare - both started to get up, glad that there friend's aunt allowed them to spend the last month of summer here before school started.</p>
