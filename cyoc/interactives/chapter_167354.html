<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">When she&#39;d gotten out of high school, Sam had hoped that the bullying would reach its end. College, she had figured, would be a refuge from all the pettiness of days past, where everyone would be too wrapped up in desperately trying to pass their classes to bother mocking the loner kid with glasses and a bit of pudge. At last, she could just study and be her nerdy self in peace.<br />
<br />
Of course, she couldn&#39;t be so lucky. In three months attending this university, she couldn&#39;t recall a single day where she hadn&#39;t had to suffer belittling from that tyrannical blonde. Katelyn was almost the total inverse of Sam; pretty, always made-up, with a body that could kill and a little entourage that had followed her from high school. She had already made a name for herself in the local sorority, largely thanks to her family&#39;s money - and she simply reveled in making Sam miserable.<br />
<br />
Why she got such a kick out of making her feel like crap was impossible to guess. To be honest, Sam had long ago given up on understanding why her bullies acted the way they did. She just tried to avoid them as much as possible. Today, that took the form of spending her lunch in a library reading room rather than the cafeteria, where she hoped that Katelyn and her goons wouldn&#39;t find her. She would&#39;ve tried this sooner, but... she had a reason to spend her days in the cafeteria. Dumb reasons, but they were reasons.<br />
<br />
That reason had only recently gotten a name: Harley, as she&#39;d overheard during a conversation. Everything about her just screamed of bad girl: the tattoos, the leather jackets, the blue-streaked black hair, the don&#39;t-give-a-fuck-about-anything attitude. For god&#39;s sake, she drove a motorcycle to school! Sam had a crush from the first time she saw her... and thus far, she hadn&#39;t done anything but sit there and fantasize about actually having the courage to talk to her. Never had mustered it up. That was probably for the best. If some overweight, hyper-nervous girl approached someone as cool as her... crap, knowing Sam&#39;s luck, she probably didn&#39;t even like girls.<br />
<br />
No, it was better to be stuffed away in here, where she couldn&#39;t give her awkward looks. At least, that had been the idea. She felt her whole body tense up as she looked up from her textbook - there were voices coming down the hall. Familiar voices. Crap crap crap. She looked around the room for a hiding place, but was too frozen up to move before they walked by and saw her. Kateyn, and the three brunette jerks who followed her everywhere - they glanced in and were immediately intrigued.<br />
<br />
&quot;I was wondering where you ran off to!&quot; Katelyn announced in a wickedly cheerful tone as they marched in, blocking the door. &quot;You had me worried, Sam. I don&#39;t like it when you get me worried.&quot; She looked quite amused with herself as she stepped closer, watching the meek asian girl scrunch up before her. &quot;What&#39;cha doing in here?&quot;<br />
<br />
Her voice came out in a stammer. &quot;U-hhhhhh... s-s-studying.&quot; She swallowed audibly. &quot;I-I figured... uh... i-it was quiet h-here...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And you didn&#39;t even tell me?&quot; She wagged her finger. &quot;Now come on Sam. I could&#39;ve really been in trouble here.&quot; From her backpack she produced several books, dropping them on the table in front of Sam. &quot;I&#39;ve got a lot of homework I need help with, Sammy. Why don&#39;t you ever think of what I need?&quot;<br />
<br />
Sweating by now, Sam tried to fight the urge to just curl up and cry. &quot;S-s-sorry...&quot; She sniffed slightly. &quot;I-I uh... I c-c-can help you d-do it...&quot;<br />
<br />
The blonde quirked an eyebrow inquisitively, and instantly Sam broke. &quot;I-I-I can.... d-d-do it for you...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good girl!&quot; She patted her on the head, intentionally knocking Sam&#39;s glasses off in the process. &quot;Do be a dear and finish it up tonight, will you? I&#39;ve got quite a busy night, and these assignments are coming do.&quot; With that, she backed off, taking her gaggle of minions with her as Sam was left alone to shove her face in her hands. She was, at least, good at crying silently - been yelled at often enough by her mother to master that art.<br />
<br />
She didn&#39;t really have a good sense of time when she descended into crying like that. Which was probably why it became so easy for her to be surprised by a knocking on the door. Her face shot up, as she expected to see a librarian there telling her to keep it down or something... and instead saw someone far different leaning against the doorframe.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey,&quot; the girl of her dreams greeted her nonchalantly. &quot;I&#39;m Harley. You&#39;re Sam, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
She had to remind herself not to hyperventilate. &quot;Uhhhhh.&quot; She blinked rapidly. &quot;Y-yeah... uh.... d-do I... k-k-know.... you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah. You stare at me every day at lunch. Was kinda weird when you weren&#39;t today.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sam was pretty sure her cheeks couldn&#39;t have gotten a brighter shade of red. She tried to stammer out a reply, but simply held her mouth open in stunned silence. Harley smiled at her - but it was nothing like when Katelyn smiled at her. There wasn&#39;t anything even remotely malicious behind it. If anything, the sight of her smile was... oddly reassuring. &quot;Relax. I&#39;m hot, I&#39;d stare too.&quot;<br />
<br />
She took a few steps inside, gently shutting the door behind her, before taking a seat in a chair right across from Sam. She was taller, but still leaned down, coming right to her eye level. &quot;You stare, so I&#39;m gonna say it was okay that I was eavesdropping.&quot; The tattooed girl let out a small sigh. &quot;Why do you let them push you around like that? They have blackmail on you or something?&quot;<br />
<br />
Struggling with just the idea of being this close to a girl she&#39;d had so many dreams about talking to, Sam had difficult piecing out a response. &quot;I-I just... no... I-I-I j-just...&quot; She sniffled again, looking down at the table. &quot;I-I-I don&#39;t... d-don&#39;t want people m-mad at me... just... j-just want to help... I&#39;m supposed to h-help...&quot;<br />
<br />
Harley leaned back, rubbing her chin as she considered everything Sam was saying, and everything she wasn&#39;t saying. &quot;Even if those people treat you like garbage?&quot; She asked gently.<br />
<br />
&quot;I-I... I... I p-probably... I probably de-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No.&quot; She leaned back forward, suddenly grasping Sam&#39;s wrist. It wasn&#39;t tight or painful, but it was certainly warm. Honestly, though, the warmth was oddly soothing. It actually felt easier to look up at Harley, and see the concerned look in her eyes. &quot;You do not deserve any of their shit. Don&#39;t you ever say that you do. That&#39;s how they beat you down.&quot;<br />
<br />
Her jaw shifted slightly as she stood up, pulling Sam up with her. &quot;You like me, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
By this point, Sam was too scared to do anything but tell the truth, nodding affirmatively. To her surprise, that actually seemed to make Harley smile. &quot;You promise me you won&#39;t ever put yourself down like that again, and I&#39;ll go out with you. Deal?&quot;<br />
<br />
Her eyes flew wide open. Was... oh god. She was... she was actually offering to go out on a date with her! Sam hadn&#39;t ever been on a date, let alone expected to go out with a girl who was just so amazing as Harley seemed to be. The instinct to beat herself up and insist aloud that she didn&#39;t deserve to date Harley started to bubble up, but it was quickly put down by how badly she wanted to at least go to her grave saying she&#39;d been on a date. &quot;I.... I promise.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good.&quot; She released Sam&#39;s hand, quickly slipping into her jacket so that she could pull out a plain-looking bracelet. &quot;Just do me one other favor. You wear this, and next time that bitch comes after you, you give her a little push. Got it?&quot;<br />
<br />
The idea of doing any harm to anyone, even Katelyn, seemed repulsive - but she wasn&#39;t about to say no to Harley. Maybe the bad girl thing was already getting to her. She meekly nodded, and the breathtaking woman in front of her gave her a reassuring pat on the shoulder. &quot;You&#39;re gonna go far, kid. I got classes, but I&#39;ll drop by and see you after school.&quot;<br />
<br />
With that, she headed right back out the door, even as Sam realized that she hadn&#39;t even given Harley a number. Well... worst case scenario, they&#39;d see each other at lunch tomorrow, and hopefully she wouldn&#39;t act like she didn&#39;t know Sam from Adam. It was all she could hope for... but she had hope, for once. That&#39;d have to sustain her.<br />
<br />
The rest of the day passed by pretty quietly; the usual history and math classes, nothing remarkable happening in either of them. Pretty soon she was headed back to her dorm, backpack full of books and one arm carrying all of Katelyn&#39;s homework and textbooks. And speak of the devil - her eyes widened as she realized that same girl was heading towards her, dressed up for what looked like a party. No entourage - she didn&#39;t know if that was better or worse.<br />
<br />
&quot;If it isn&#39;t my favorite nerd!&quot; She grinned, gesturing to the books under Sam&#39;s arm. &quot;You&#39;ve got everything done?&quot;<br />
<br />
Sam shook her head. &quot;I-I uh... ha-haven&#39;t had a c-chance...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Seriously, Sam?!&quot; Her tone took on a flash of anger. &quot;I just ask you to do one thing, one thing! Now I&#39;ve gotta spend this whole party worried about whether or not you&#39;re gonna get done on time! Do you have any idea how much stress you&#39;re putting me through?! Do you ever even consider me before you run off and do your selfish bullshit?!&quot;<br />
<br />
She kept on yammering, spouting her usual barrage of angry shit. Ordinarily, Sam would&#39;ve just kept taking it, scrunching down further and furhter... but as she glanced at the bracelet on her wrist, with its little plastic beads, she remembered her promise. Part of her still didn&#39;t want to even think about doing this... but she had said she would.<br />
<br />
It was one quick, jerking movement. A shove against Katelyn&#39;s shoulder with her free hand, hardly forceful at all, but definitely enough to be felt. The blonde&#39;s mouth hung open with shock, amazement that the normally meek and subservient nerd had dared to touch her, let alone shove her. She opened her mouth to shout something else, but the words got stuck as she looked at Sam&#39;s hand.<br />
<br />
Sam&#39;s glowing hand.<br />
<br />
In the dimness of early evening, the glowing golden strands that flowed between Sam&#39;s hand and where she had touched Katelyn&#39;s shoulder were like street lamps. She stared in awe, adjusting her glasses slightly - it was unlike anything she&#39;d ever seen. The bracelet, she realized, had disintegrated, forming the growing bands that suddenly tugged at both of them.<br />
<br />
She gasped as an electric shock ran up her hand, trailing from her wrist to her shoulder. With wide eyes Sam watched as the plumpness seemed to be drained straight away, as if the fat was being sucked right out. The previously pudgy shape became slender, feimine in a way it had never been; she brought up her other hand to cover her mouth as she gasped, and realized that it too had been cleansed of fat, reduced to a healthy weight.<br />
<br />
The reduction soon spread to her neck and torso, as she felt the weight dropping off. The little muffin-top she&#39;d had since she was little sucked its way back into her gut, stretch marks vanishing and leaving behind perfectly smooth skin. Her flat stomach soon became a stark contrast to her chest - as the fat was sucked away, she found a natural shapliness to them. They were quite impressive - easily the size of Katelyn&#39;s.<br />
<br />
Looking down, she watched in amazement as her hips remained wide, but the curve shifted from flab to fit, the product of extensive workouts rather than extensive pizza. Her legs thinned out as well, becoming as slender in proportion as her arms. They stretched, she could feel, her height gaining several inches. A final rush of electricity tingled over her hair, the dark mess rearranging itself to become silky smooth and well-kempt.<br />
<br />
In mere moments, Sam had gained an amazing body - Katelyn&#39;s body, she quickly realized, the hourglass frame unmistakable even from this angle. She looked up in shock at the blonde, and found herself looking down at a shorter, much pudgier girl as the golden bands faded away. While Sam&#39;s already-loose clothes could barely stay on her body now, Katelyn&#39;s had become tight, pushed to near their breaking point as they struggled to hold in the plus-sized girl who now got to experience Sam&#39;s old physique first-hand.<br />
<br />
Katelyn screeched, running away and bawling at how hideous she now thought herself to be. A dumbstruck Sam merely stood there, staring off after the fleeing blonde for a moment before looking back down at her new body - Katelyn&#39;s Body? No, no... it was hers now. God, she&#39;d never been so thin... or had these kinds of curves... she couldn&#39;t help but trace her hands down her new form, blushing at the sensitivity of her fit muscles and perky chest.<br />
<br />
&quot;She sure as shit isn&#39;t gonna forget that, huh?&quot;<br />
<br />
Sam&#39;s clothes nearly fell off as she twirled around, to find Harley standing behind her with a smug look of satisfaction. She couldn&#39;t help but look her right in those dreamy green eyes, now that they were about eye level. If she&#39;d been anxious about standing in front of Harley before... standing before her when she was one light breeze away from full frontal nudity was something else entirely.<br />
<br />
Not that the punkish girl seemed to mind. &quot;Gotta admit, she had a pretty hot body.&quot; She flicked at Sam&#39;s oversized shirt, causing it to fall against her chest and create an outline of the impressive curves. &quot;Glad it&#39;s on someone who deserves it.&quot;<br />
<br />
She had so many questions right now, so very many things she wanted to know. &quot;How did you...?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You never heard of witches or something?&quot;<br />
<br />
Sam&#39;s eyes widened. &quot;You&#39;re... but... that&#39;s... but witches... those aren&#39;t real!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And yet I&#39;m here, and you are smoking.&quot;<br />
<br />
Her blush only deepened with every flirtatious or complimentary word from Harley. &quot;She... I got... and she got... you... you switched our bodies?&quot;<br />
<br />
Harley shrugged as she slipped an arm over Sam&#39;s shoulder. &quot;Simple feature copy spell, really. You got her features, she got yours.&quot; She cocked her head to one side. &quot;If you&#39;re worried about revenge from her, I made it temporary. She&#39;ll be back to normal tomorrow, and I guarantee she&#39;ll never fuck with you again.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh.&quot; Her spirits fell slightly. &quot;So... tomorrow, I&#39;ll....&quot;<br />
<br />
A finger suddenly rest on her lips, silencing her. &quot;Oh no no no - it&#39;s only temporary on her end. For your side...&quot; She trailed her finger down Sam&#39;s lip, all the way down her neck to her collarbone. &quot;That&#39;s permanent. Even if you never move again and spend your whole life downing pure chocolate and sugar, you&#39;re never gonna stop having this sexy body.&quot;<br />
<br />
Just as Sam was sure she was about to faint from all of this, Harley threw in one more question, her tone turning sultry. “So, hot stuff - what’ve you got in mind for our date?”</p>
