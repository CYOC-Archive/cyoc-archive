<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Might start writing once more.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Bye!” Lance’s gruff voice called, happiness from his visit tinging his deep and baritone voice. “Come again later! With your mom too.” <br />
<br />
Jay stopped in place and turned, confusion on his face. Jay relaxed his pose, tilting his head a bit. “I am coming back, but what’s with needing my mom too?”<br />
<br />
Lance stilled for a moment. “Oh! We’re doing a dinner night and a lot of my family members, both human and trans-human would be here, including Uncle George!”<br />
<br />
Smiling, Jay nodded in affirmation to Lance. “Right, okay! I’ll definitely invite her to attend too. Time?”<br />
<br />
“8 PM sharp.” <br />
<br />
“Right.” Jay smiled once more and waved a goodbye, Lance returning it and closing the doors.<br />
<br />
He chuckled a bit as his cheeks tinged with embarrassment, remembering the just recent memory of the sounds of a grunting bull and the tell-tale beating of bovine meat in the bathroom. The splatters of testosterone-laden semen into the toilet bowl was arousal inducing, the continuous amount that could be produced by such a mythical beast.<br />
<br />
Jay banished the memory from his head, focusing on returning home instead. Taking a left turn, Jay slipped into the alley nearby. <br />
“Oh. Gotta buy some stuff for myself, too. Lance ate all the snacks.” Jay took another turn, memory guiding his legs towards the general store that he knew by heart. <br />
<br />
<br />
On his way home, a bag full of snacks, and music in his ears, Jay happily strolled home, this time using the alley closest to his current location. It was a pretty dark alleyway, the building’s shadow cast over the entire path. <br />
<br />
Jay didn’t bother or didn’t worry as he walked into the dark path. Phone in hand, ears deaf to the world and baggage of heavy snacks in his grasp. <br />
<br />
It was a mistake.<br />
<br />
Jay didn’t really notice when he toppled over as a heavyweight furred creature pounced him.<br />
<br />
Didn’t register the glowing yellow eyes, ferally glaring at him as drool slobbered out of its maw.<br />
<br />
Brain in discordance from the distractions and his body stunned by shock. Jay Reece almost died that day.<br />
<br />
But only on a reflex that he was able to place his thin arms between him and certain death.<br />
<br />
The werewolf, now that he had seen and was back in the moment once more, bitten straight into his arm.<br />
<br />
“GAH-!” Jay grappled the beast’s maw, preventing his arm from getting snapped off with the bite force of the beast. “FUCK!”<br />
<br />
In a bid of self-defense, Jay kicked the werewolf with as much force in his lupine nuts. <br />
<br />
The beast’s jaw unhinged in pure shock before his howls erupted in pain as he cradled his throbbing nuts. Jay took his chance to scurry and stand, ready to run.<br />
“W-wait! I’m sorry!” <br />
<br />
Jay stopped.<br />
<br />
“I- augh!” The werewolf whimpered, head lowered to the ground and tail tucked between his legs. His bulky yet lithe form was so pathetic in front of a human. “I’m just hungry I couldn’t hold myself back I’m homeless please please please-”<br />
<br />
“Hey! Hey!” Jay tightened the cloth around his arm to slow down the bleeding. “Stop...”<br />
<br />
“W.. I bit you…” He looked towards Jay for mercy. He knew what happened to monsters who attacked humans.<br />
<br />
Jay knew as well. <br />
<br />
Should the one that was attacked crippled for life, the monster would be sent to a lifetime of jail, which to be frank was an experience far worse than that of a human prisoner.<br />
<br />
And should the victim be murdered...<br />
<br />
They were killed off, like the monster they look like.<br />
<br />
“It’s okay. I understand.” Jay walked closer, and the werewolf whimpered, retreating a bit. “I’m going to help you.”<br />
<br />
Jay didn’t need to speak much.<br />
<br />
<br />
They went to a nearby clinic for treatment. The blood test revealed that both the werewolf and Jay himself were free from the virus. Fortune favors the bold.<br />
<br />
He brought the werewolf over to a monster-friendly restaurant, owned by Jay’s own aunt. The hungry werewolf ate like a true starving beast, ordering plate upon plate of meats, and vegetables. Jay didn’t mind paying the bill in full.<br />
<br />
A communal monster-friendly bath was their next stop. It was hilarious to see the werewolf whimper in discomfort as the fur-friendly shampoo was lathered and bubbled over the guy, Jay was opportunistic enough to get a picture of a werewolf sitting on the floor covered in bubbles. <br />
<br />
They went and got the werewolf clothing. All the long while, the werewolf, aptly called Arthur Stevenson kept obedient. He knew how Jay was actually pretty rich. A word from him to the authorities meant further pain.<br />
<br />
“Well, we’re here.” Jay gestured to the massive construction site in the progress of building an apartment. “This is Uncle Robert’s construction company.”<br />
<br />
“Your uncle?” The werewolf tilted his head questioningly.<br />
<br />
“Yes. And you’re going to work here.” Jay walked in, pausing and looking back to invite Arthur.<br />
<br />
They walked in, uncaring of the dangers of the site. Arthur watched in awe as monsters of differing body sizes and forms worked in harmony. Steel beams were hauled by strength alone and several flyers, being male harpies and demons flown to the top of the construction to work.<br />
<br />
“Jay!” Arthur looked to the caller, finding a burly human man in sight. His auburn hair curled under the protection of the hard hat, and the trimmed goatee rimming a friendly, squared jaw. His blue eyes glowed with intelligence and joy.<br />
<br />
“Uncle Robert, hi!” Jay quickly walked over, excited about this deal. “I got you another worker.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, I can see that.” Robert walked over to Arthur, and suddenly he felt small even when he was a good 6 inches over the man. The scrutinizing gaze roamed all over his body, assessing. “Are you strong?”<br />
<br />
“Uh, I guess so.” Arthur’s growly voice was meek.<br />
<br />
“Well, that’s good enough. We’ll teach you the ropes, but for now, you’re relegated to brunt work.” Robert patted Arthur on the shoulders. “I know your circumstances, look at them all.” Robert gestured towards the monsters watching them, smiling in their gaze.<br />
<br />
Arthur surveyed them, from minotaurs to basilisks, to demons and even other werewolves. They didn&#39;t look unhappy, working this work that now fed them and housed them.<br />
<br />
“They were the same.” Arthur realized, suddenly feeling at amongst brethren.<br />
<br />
“Yes.” Robert laughed a haughty laugh, amused. “Well, go get dressed. I’ll start your documents later.”<br />
<br />
“T-thank you.” Arthur was holding back tears, surprised in the turn of events.<br />
<br />
“You’re welcome.” “You’re welcome.”<br />
<br />
Jay and Robert looked to each other, bursting into laughter.<br />
<br />
“Well, you’re still gotta pay for hurting my nephew, but that’s for later…” Robert walked forwards, a hard slap on the werewolf’s ass resounding throughout the site as nearby monsters laughed.<br />
<br />
“I’m going home first. Bye, Uncle Robert! See you soon Arthur.” Jay waved Robert a goodbye, walking out of the construction site.<br />
<br />
<br />
Unseen, a pair of serpentine eyes slit up, a hiss of anger following through.</p>
