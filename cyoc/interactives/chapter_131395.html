<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After the unexpected but none the less intense sex makin, Jenny and Kyle just drifted to sleep in the girl&#39;s bed. Next morning, Jen awakes to Kyle who apparently had brought her coffee and cookies! What a gentleman, she thought, he was turning out to be nothing like what she thought he was! They have breakfast together, and suddenly Kyle asks about something Jen had pretty much forgotten about. &quot;Hey Jen, by the way, earlier when I woke up and you were still sleeping, I uh...found something a bit weird in your bedroom.&quot; <br />
&quot;Oh?&quot; Jen says wanting to seem oblivious, though she had a pretty good guess to what that weird thing was. <br />
&quot;Yeah, I mean, not like I went rummaging through your stuff, but it was really just lying there on the floor... Well I found a pretty clearly masculine looking suit and tie. Thought it was strange, since you know, you are so straight and feminine in the way you dress. So what&#39;s up with the suit? I mean is it even your stuff?&quot; <br />
Jenny blushed slightly. &quot;Yeah... it&#39;s mine.&quot; <br />
&quot;Cool! So you decided to experiment a bit with androgyny or something? If so I really wouldn&#39;t mind!&quot; Kyle asks getting a bit excited. <br />
&quot;What? Eww, no! Like, really, no Kyle.&quot; Jen answers quickly. <br />
Kyle looked a bit disappointed. &quot;Okay okay, got it... So then why did you even have such clothes if I may ask?&quot; <br />
Jenny took a deep breath. &quot;All right. Listen, I&#39;ll tell you, but you promise me that you won&#39;t laugh ok?&quot; <br />
&quot;I promise.&quot; <br />
&quot;Okay here goes... I actually bought that outfit yesterday...and it&#39;s not simply a suit and tie, it&#39;s specifically a young boy&#39;s private school uniform. Yeah. Don&#39;t say anything just yet, let me finish please! Now you obviously do remember that you cursed me so that whatever I wear it would change me to conform with the clothes. Oh by the way, you still haven&#39;t removed my curse yet!!&quot; <br />
&quot;You&#39;re right Jen, guess we got too busy and it slipped my mind... haha.&quot; <br />
&quot;Yeah...&quot; <br />
&quot;Well then let me just do it right now. Sorry I didn&#39;t mean to forget Jenny...&quot; <br />
&quot;Good boy. But first, let me finish telling you about the uniform thingy. As I was saying, I bought the silly thing because I devised a little plan to sort of trick you, so that I could get close to you without you knowing it was me. Remember that I still thought that you hated my guts and so you wouldn&#39;t let me get near without getting all hostile...&quot; <br />
&quot;Oh Jennifer... but it wasn&#39;t like that!&quot; <br />
&quot;Well I thought otherwise yesterday, and I think it was logical to think so... So anyway, I sort of thought that if I wore that outfit and it would make me look like, well...a harmless little schoolboy, I would approach you and used the transform and dare curse on you, to order you to lift my curse... I didn&#39;t mean to cause you any harm Kyle, just...force you to remove the curse... Ok, that is everything. So go ahead and laugh at me now...&quot; <br />
Kyle just smiled warmly. &quot;Why would I laugh at you Jenny?&quot; <br />
&quot;Well, because I admit, it was a really dumb and silly thing to come up with, hahaha...&quot; <br />
&quot;I think it&#39;s kind of cute actually! Haha I&#39;m kinda sorry that it didn&#39;t actually play out that way, just so I could have met a younger and male version of Jennifer Smith heh heh. Though I&#39;m not even sure if the T&D curse is strong enough to actually give you a sex change...that would be so cool though!!&quot; <br />
Jen blushed awkwardly. &quot;Well... Actually Kyle, I sort of did try on the clothes yesterday evening, you know to test if it actually works...and guess what, it worked.&quot; She shrugs, still blushing. <br />
&quot;Oh my god, so you were actually a boy for a while??&quot; <br />
Jenny nods slowly. &quot;Indeed I was... The weirdest part was that it didn&#39;t even make me a younger and male version of myself, it just changed me into this totally random black kid!&quot; <br />
&quot;Wow, that sure is strange! The curse is so strong it&#39;s actually kinda scary... Jen, I&#39;m gonna remove it now before it does something unpredictable to you. I really don&#39;t want you to risk getting harmed!&quot; <br />
Jennifer puts her hands on his shoulders, a playful and perverted smile on her face. &quot;Hey Kyle, haha I just got an idea, actually... Before you remove the curse, how about I wear my silly little uniform one last time, just for you... y&#39;know, to show you what it makes of your precious Jenny... hahaha...&quot; <br />
&quot;Jen are you serious?&quot; <br />
&quot;Yeah, I mean it! Come on, just for a minute so you see him, the boy I mean, and then we get me rid of this curse once and for all. What do you say? It&#39;s just for fun!&quot; <br />
&quot;I dunno Jen... I mean if you&#39;re okay with this, then I obviously am curious to see...&quot; <br />
&quot;All righty then, haha&quot; Jen, who was now wearing just a pink bra and panties, rushed upstairs and she swiftly returned with the boy clothes. She laid them on the couch and sits down next to them, her back straight and her face showing a strange mix of embarrasment and excitement. &quot;Ok mister Perkins, I&#39;ll just sit here as still as a Barbie doll, come dress me up!&quot; <br />
The queerness of the situation was already making Kyle kind of horny. He silently walked in front of Jen and he slowly and clumsily began unclasping her bra... Soon she was completely nude again and she giggled seeing that Kyle looked more embarrased than her. He takes the white boy&#39;s briefs and he blushed red as he slides them up Jenny&#39;s smooth slim and sexy legs. She gave him a playful and reassuring smile. When Kyle was pulling the white socks up Jen&#39;s ankles, he noticed she actually looked a bit...smaller now, and her usually pale rosy skintone actually looked a bit darker! The curse worked, she was really changed by the clothes! Kyle grabbed the white Oxford shirt. He guided Jen&#39;s arms through the slightly too short sleeves and then he began buttoning her up, starting from the bottom. When he gets to her chest, he sees that there&#39;s a bit of a problem... &quot;Uh Jen. I don&#39;t think I can...squeeze your generously sizeable breasts in this shirt.&quot; Jen, who now was decidedly a bit shorter, tell him &quot;Yeah...give it time, they&#39;ll shrink...just put my pants on in the meantime&quot; <br />
Kyle nodded, he sits her up and holds the short blue uniform trousers up for her to step into them. He slowly pulls them up to her now narrower hips, and tucked the half open shirt neatly inside. He buttons the trousers and then gets back to working on her shirt. He stretched the fabric a bit and he actually made it to get the button fastened. While she still had a bit of boobs, they were now less than half the original size! He looks up at her face a second and he let out a gasp. She looked decidedly younger now, less feminine and her once long, straight and blonde hair was now shortened to the tips of her ears, it was dark brown and wavey, and it kept retracting into her skull by the second! Her skin was now a medium brown shade and even her blue eyes had darkened! Fascinated, Kyle finished up hastily buttoning the changing girl up to the collar, eager to transform her further. Jenny silently tapped her now fully flat and male chest with her smaller, dark skinned hands. Her hair also finished changing and she now sported a fresh buzzcut with a rough afro texture. In her face, nothing of Jennifer Smith was left anymore! Kyle takes the black tie and slides it underneath her(his?) collar. He starts tying a neat Windsor knot when &quot;Jenny&quot; suddenly groans, looking in pain! &quot;What&#39;s wrong Jen? You all right?&quot; <br />
&quot;It&#39;s okay I&#39;m just... growing a penis...&quot; Her\his voice was cracking up. Kyle felt his erection twitch. &quot;Woah, okay... Does it hurt?&quot; <br />
&quot;Like a bitch...the whole transformation is a bit painful, but this part is the worse. Mmpf!&quot; The voice was that of a young boy by the end of the phrase, which meant that Jenny officially changed sex, dick and testosterone producing testicles and all. Kyle notices the tell tale bump in Jenny&#39;s trousers and he grinned. He finished up with Jen&#39;s tie, pushing the knot nice and snug against the white collar, and the new little boy smiled timidly at him, feeling admired. &quot;Well, um...how do I look Kyle?...&quot; <br />
Kyle grinned widely. &quot;You look...great. Jen. Look at you, you&#39;re really a boy, heh heh&quot; <br />
&quot;Yes I am!&quot; Jenny said cheerfully. <br />
&quot;Here, put on your school blazer too&quot; Kyle gave the boy the blue jacket and he puts it on, then he makes a full slow spin to show off. Kyle does a little applause. &quot;You&#39;re so cute Jen. You look really smart in your uniform, you know?&quot; <br />
Jen giggles. &quot;I take it you like me this way, am I right? Ok I&#39;ll admit, it&#39;s not actually that bad, it feels kinda cool...to be a boy I mean!&quot; <br />
&quot;Aww, you see? I mean don&#39;t get me wrong Jenny, as a sexy blonde chick you are...were, smoking hot. But hey, change is good right? I know how much you like your femininity, so I want lo let you know that I really appreciate you doing this for me!&quot; <br />
&quot;No problem Kyle, really, I&#39;m actually enjoying this too...&quot;</p>
