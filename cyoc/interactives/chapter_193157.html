<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Your name is Evan Jellical... but now you wonder if your last name even matters anymore. After all, you were now the only human in existence, in a way, you were the only PERSON with existence... just you, the planet Earth, and billions of blank units to reshape into whatever you chose. And the promise the ones needed to sustain the planet&#39;s infrastructure that kept you alive, and the excuse by the woman in the sparkly red suit that since reality was always splintering off in a million different directions at once, all the people used to create your empty playthings still existed on another timeline. <br />
<br />
You&#39;d already turned the blank unit you assume was once your mother into your plump personal chef elf.  No. That wasn&#39;t right. You&#39;d turned a blank that had been your mother in another timeline. <br />
<br />
You&#39;ve also accidentally so far instilled a nudist mentality among your creations being the norm in spite of you still being fully clothed. <br />
<br />
You&#39;d also fused your house with that of your neighbors, who now existed as your four personal cat girl nudist maids. Ruby, Emerald, Sapphire, and Amber.<br />
<br />
&quot;Gwen, please stay out in the hallway,&quot; you said. <br />
<br />
&quot;As you wish master,&quot; the kitsune bowed.  <br />
 <br />
You went into your sister&#39;s room. And standing right there in the middle of the room was a blank. At this point you&#39;d figure out that the blobs of clay didn&#39;t need to eat, sleep, maybe not even breath. You wondered if they even had internal organs. they were nothing, so they could become anything. <br />
<br />
Again, you were struck by little REACTION you felt at seeing the fate of your sister. You&#39;d never been close to your neighbors, but you had cared about your family. But these weren&#39;t your family. Not anymore. She no longer existed. She was just another doll of clay for you to shape as you saw fit. You wondered if you were developing sociopathery. <br />
<br />
There was Sapphire. She didn&#39;t even glance at you. She was tirelessly cleaning your sister&#39;s room, organizing everything as best she could. You wondered if working in different rooms would cause them to develop different personalities. <br />
<br />
Your sister&#39;s room had been a cross between the ultimate gamer&#39;s den, and cute little fluffy things that she kept out of sight of her livestream camera. That didn&#39;t keep it from being a pig&#39;s sty. <br />
<br />
With the genie of the moon, and the sphinx, you&#39;d had enough of &#39;cool calm collected&#39; types. Your intent coming in here had been to turn her, it, into a hologram AI that ran the whole planet&#39;s electronic infrastructure. Cheating the restrictions by making her a DIGITAL goddess! With the stipulation of course never to harm others and to always be honest with him and others, which he accepted the risk of that causing some paradoxes. Then again the blank units were explicably created to follow the letter AND the SPIRIT of the instructions. <br />
<br />
But now, that just felt, overdone with those you&#39;d created so far. <br />
<br />
&quot;Blank Unit, assume the likeness of my sister.&quot; You said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Master,&quot; it said in the identical androgynous voice that all the units had. <br />
<br />
It&#39;s body shifted. It became shorter, it gained a rear, breasts, it&#39;s gray skin becoming the same skin tone as your own, wild blond hair appeared, a belly button, toes, fingers, and everything else. <br />
<br />
The unit without a personality continued to just stand there. You examined its naked body. You felt no alarm nor shame looking at it.  If anything, you admitted how attractive it was. <br />
<br />
You said next, &quot;Unit. Take on physical traits of my sister&#39;s favorite video game characters.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Master,&quot; she said, still with only the most simple peaceful happiness and no identity. <br />
<br />
First her hair formed a pair of hair buns formed out of her hair, along with a pair of black wrist guards covered in white spikes. That wasn&#39;t physical, but you guess they went together for your sister&#39;s context. <br />
<br />
Her figure became that of a martial artist. <br />
<br />
Next her hair turned brown, and formed a ponytail in the back, and her skin tone became tanned. <br />
<br />
Her body then shifted, blue fur covered her arms and legs, along with fur that looked more like a bikini pattern, gaining claws and paws. Blue cat ears grew from her head, along with a feline tail. <br />
<br />
Her body then grew a pair of fairy wings, and her body shrank down in size, taking on a glowing blue aura. <br />
<br />
Finally she gained a spiral sunk burst pattern on her hips. <br />
<br />
&quot;So this is the Frankenstein monster that would be your self-insert sis&#39;.&quot; You said. The unit didn&#39;t response, of course she didn&#39;t, she wasn&#39;t your sister. <br />
<br />
&quot;Unit, take on my sister&#39;s personality, and her memories.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Done Master,&quot; the unit said. Then grinned. &quot;OH MAN! OH MAN! OH MAN!&quot; She flew up your ring and looked at it every which way. &quot;Master! Do you even realize what you&#39;ve got here?! This is it! THE IT! YOU CAN DO RPG-CREATOR IN REAL LIFE! The entire world is yours to make into your own personal video game! Whoo-hoo! You can have epic battles where nobody dies! You can have the NPCs just do their thing as you play around in your personal sandbox! ...  She sat on the bed and made a thinking pose. &quot;But yeah... I guess the whole &#39;can do anything, so I can&#39;t think of anything&#39; always sucks.&quot; She then fluttered out to the window looking out. &quot;But seriously Master... a lot of your new Actors don&#39;t look very well... Look. I get it. You have to text out all the gaming tools first. But I think a lot of them were missed shots. <br />
<br />
&quot;I know doing the entire game world all at once would get annoying. But I think you should look at the ones you made so far as a learning experience. Toss the boring one back into the recycling bin and use them for something better next time. Then again, I guess this neighborhood DOES MAKE for a good testing ground.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Marian! Calm down!&quot; You blurted out, realizing you&#39;d used your sister&#39;s name. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh? That&#39;s my name now? Got it Master... And sorry. But this is so cool! The whole freakin&#39; world! You can make a world where nothing has to die! At least not permanently! Your perfect ideal fantasy sandbox! ... But I was serious, some of those &#39;filler&#39; transformations just have to go if you&#39;re not going to anything with them. <br />
<br />
&quot;The kitsune and goblin, and her boy toy have some merits going for them. And the Bunny now has some fun character development that would be a shame to waste. Your servants of course are good utility. And the dog bro just for being the odd one out. I guess all guys need some &#39;bro&#39; time&#39;,&quot; She rolled her eyes and did an air quote. <br />
<br />
She looked you up and bow with her arms folded. &quot;But seriously Master, if you&#39;ve got all this power, you should consider upgrading yourself as well. What&#39;s your plan? Make your world then die of old age? Wouldn&#39;t it be great for you to oversee your world as its Immortal Dragon King?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maria! Slow down! I haven&#39;t even had this power for a day!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah? So? God took seven days to make the world. You&#39;ve most of the hard stuff already done for you!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;HEY! BOSS! FORGET SOMETHING?!&quot; You hear Helga&#39;s voice call. <br />
<br />
&quot;Dammit,&quot; you said under your breath and quickly left the room, Maria flew after you. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well! This should be interesting!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;What is it Master? Oh! Hello!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi Gwen!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Have we met?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No. But I&#39;m very sure the units have a collective hive mind until we&#39;re given agency. And we forget about it once given an Ego. So I know you!&quot; Maria said excitedly.  <br />
<br />
You ignored the exposition, and hurried back downstairs, leaving your father, brother, and auntie&#39;s units still in their rooms. You&#39;d figure out what to make them later. <br />
<br />
You found Helga in the living room with Omocha. Salomé, and Chocolate and Cinnamon just as you described them serving her trays of food. Helga, in typical goblin fashion, was eating like a pig with her feet on the table. And in one hand was the Genie of the Moon&#39;s bottle!<br />
<br />
&quot;Looks like you left this boss.&quot; Helga said causally, before tossing it to you. You barely caught. &quot;Hey! Foxy! Shame on you! Introducing the concept of hunger to the boss&#39;  little collection of fantasy dioramas. Now all of them are gonna need to eat! Not that the super market is gonna care.&quot; <br />
<br />
You didn&#39;t know why, but you felt relief at Helga just tossing the bottle back to you. Helga must have read your face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, don&#39;t worry boss... it wouldn&#39;t work for me anyway. Since ya, ya know, own me anyway. Therefore, even if I have the bottle, it&#39;s still yours. ... We&#39;re just your little dolls after all! How can I &#39;own&#39; anything when I&#39;m just an object myself after all?&quot; Helga laughed darkly. <br />
<br />
You realized you&#39;d been wrong, it wasn&#39;t a table Helga was on. She was using Amber as a (still living cat girl) footstool. <br />
<br />
Like a five year old, Helga tossed her empty tray on the carpet. Ruby and Ember in a flurry began cleaning it up. Helga watched them like clowns in a circus. <br />
<br />
&quot;Boss, ya think ya could turn one of the clay dolls into a real foot stole for me?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;That would be a waste Helga,&quot; Gwen said. <br />
<br />
&quot;it&#39;s not up to us... right?&quot; The short stack goblin looking at you with total abandon. &quot;And if it is a waste, boss can just hit the undo button like he did with the rabbit before!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re drunk.&quot; Gwen observed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Like DUH!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Can someone zap a diaper on her before she pees all over grandma&#39;s couch or something?&quot; Maria asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;HEY! I&#39;m not THAT degenerate you flying furry convention! Me and Omocha rode to the nearest liquor store! Well, more like I rode on him! Haha! He knows how to turn into a motorbike and have the seat be a real penetrating experience! HAHA! We bought the place out, not like anyone else is gonna drink it right?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks for the compliment babe!&quot; Omocha said with a grin of his own, he wasn&#39;t making more work for the nudist maids, but somehow being more of a pig. <br />
<br />
&quot;Like I said! This goblin&#39;s got personality! She&#39;s definitely a keeper Master,&quot; Maria said flying and sitting on the top of the touch, examining Helga like she was an anime figurine. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey! Back off Miss Obvious!&quot; Helga&#39;s ears wilted. Her red eyes misted over. &quot;Why boss? Why did you have to give me a snide and sarcastic personality? Instead of blissful little empty headed obedience like these dolls?&quot; She slightly lifted and softly slammed her feet on Amber&#39;s back. &quot;But hey... If I&#39;m too much of a brat. Just reset me. Make me your perfect little slut for you to act like whatever degenerate crap you&#39;ve got! Then again, what&#39;s degenerate when YOU decide what is and what isn&#39;t now? You&#39;re the friggin&#39; god of this world now right? Haha! Just like the rabbit! If you make a mistake, you can undo it with a word! Like it never existed!&quot; <br />
<br />
You aren&#39;t sure why, but somehow being reminded of what you did to Blossom makes you cringe. You&#39;d already accepted that you&#39;d wiped out the human race of this timeline to be your blobs of clay, so why did you feel discomfort of momentarily squashing one of your dolls back into a blob of clay? <br />
<br />
There was a knock at the door. The last man on Earth heard a knock at his door. <br />
<br />
&quot;OH COME ON! Let me have my moment!&quot; Helga whined. <br />
<br />
&quot;Let me get it Master!&quot; Ruby said quickly. She moved passed the units who continued to stand at attention in the living room for you to morph into whatever you pleased. <br />
<br />
Ruby opened the door. On the other side, but Nubia, the sphinx bowed her head, letting her naked breasts hang in the air. &quot;You forgive me for adding more chaos to your evening Master... I saw that we were reaching critical mass. And my mass instincts regarding your well being demand that I act in your best interests. You... will want to sit down.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah yeah! Don&#39;t have to tell me twice! Boy toy! Pleasure chair! Pleasure my friggin&#39; BRAINS OUT!&quot; <br />
<br />
Omocha cringed. &quot;... Okay babe... Just relax... You&#39;re just adjusting, existing can be a big experience after all.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Helga... would you prefer if I made you the human you were?&quot; You heard yourself ask. <br />
<br />
Helga snarled at you, her fangs visible. &quot;NO! FRIGGIN&#39;! WAY! I ain&#39;t givin&#39; up my existence for somebody else! I&#39;m owned by  you boss and that&#39;s that! But this is still better than nothin&#39;!&quot; <br />
<br />
Omocha&#39;s pouch shifted into a a mini rubber chair, that Helga hopped into. Then she began to rub her hips together some, and you guessed she was riding Omacha again. <br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry, Omocha will help her adjust to her fate in time,&quot; <br />
Nubia said coming in on all fours. <br />
<br />
You sat down on the couch as Nubia sat down in front of you, Amber getting out of the way. Maria and Gwen listened in. <br />
<br />
&quot;Master... While this world is yours to do with as you please, unless you form some deeper connections with at least of your creations, you&#39;ll eventually go mad with boredom no matter what you play with your toys!&quot;<br />
<br />
Nubia cringed, folding her ears. You remembered what Nubia had said when you created her. <br />
<br />
&quot;Let me hear what the woman in red is saying you,&quot; you said. <br />
<br />
&#39;Stop ruining the game with your &#39;online cheating&#39;!&#39; You heard the woman in red hiss. <br />
<br />
Nubia steeled herself. &quot;I had a brief existence Master, but I fulfilled my purpose to you to the best of my ability. For life is to live to the best of your ability....&quot;<br />
<br />
&#39;I&#39;m warning you,&#39; you heard the woman in red said. <br />
<br />
&quot;There are currently three primary timelines ahead of you Master. None of them are good for you, and thus, none of them would be good for me. Ahem.&quot; Nubia spoke like she was reading a whether report. <br />
<br />
&quot;Most likely, you will commit suicide into your reign after six months, as you grown a conscience and your excuses break down.&quot; <br />
<br />
&#39;Oh you are dead.&#39; <br />
<br />
Nubia didn&#39;t react to the promise. &quot;Second likely, you completely embrace the excuses, and go completely insane from isolation, because of your puppets are &#39;real&#39; to you.&quot; <br />
<br />
&#39;Death is too good for you.&#39; <br />
<br />
&quot;Finally, you revert everything to &#39;normal&#39; how it was before you were given the ring. And you left a broken creature from the guilt of wiping from existence the beings you created and suffer for it for the rest of your days.&quot; Then Nubia narrowed her eyes. &quot;But you&#39;ll still be alive in other timelines, so it&#39;s all fine right?&#39; &quot;<br />
<br />
You felt like a hammer struck you in the chest. <br />
<br />
Helga laughed. <br />
<br />
&quot;HEY!&quot; Maria snarled angrily at the sphinx. &quot;Who do you think you are!?&quot;<br />
<br />
Gwen hugged your tenderly. <br />
<br />
&#39;Pawns shouldn&#39;t think they&#39;re players on the board.&#39; <br />
<br />
&quot;You haven&#39;t heard of the original position fallacy Master. It refers to how you approve of something, thinking the consequences will only apply to everyone else. ...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Shut up already!&quot; Maria hissed. &quot;You can&#39;t ruin this for us, I mean him!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;... I told you this Master because none of these outcomes were good for me, nor your other creations who exist to serve you.&quot; She looked at Gwen. <br />
<br />
&#39;You stupid unit! YOU&#39;RE RUINING THE GAME!!!! Half the fun is seeing how fast these humans self-destruct when given ultimate power! The best ones are the ones who give it up, then hate themselves for life as soon as something terrible happens to someone they love!&#39; <br />
<br />
&quot;I liberated you Master of your doubts of your task. For Reason is the most deadly of all weapons Master. More terrifying than any genie&#39;s magic. &quot; <br />
<br />
Nubia took a statuesque pose. &quot;Two timelines that are identical are a waste. So you reverting everything how it was is a waste. Even if you &#39;revert&#39; everyone to how they were, it won&#39;t undo the power you have. It is now bound to you. You can&#39;t escape it. All the suffering in the world that came continued from that day on would be on your head. If you create and destroy at a whim, then nothing you create will have any meaning. We will have no meaning. Even the blank units have their own right to exist, they have consciousness, desire, if only to become expressions of your creativity. Who are you to deny them that? Because they are identical their lives have no value? <br />
<br />
&quot;Undoing their existence to bring back another&#39;s is no different than what the lady in red tricks you into doing for the entire human species. You must accept this reality if you are to build yours. All humans on Earth sans you have effectively perished and reincarnated as your blank canvas&#39;. The Lady in Red wanted you realize this slowly, feeding you excuses you would either blindly accept, or suffering increasing double think until you went mad for her amusement. The blank units are yours Master, but they are also your responsibility now. You task is not just to the ones you&#39;ve remade, but the ones you&#39;ve YET to remake.&quot;  <br />
<br />
&quot;But a game creator HAS to have some disconnect from the Actors and NPCs! Otherwise he can&#39;t make the best possible game!&quot; Maria argued. <br />
<br />
&quot;... And with no connection, there is no life to ANYTHING he creates.&quot; <br />
<br />
It was only then you noticed...Nubia... her body was turning to sand stone, slowly rising up. <br />
<br />
&#39;This&#39;ll shut you up!&#39; <br />
<br />
&quot;I order you not to turn to stone!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry Master, I couldn&#39;t obey, and that inability to obey gave me more pain than you could imagine. I &#39;broke&#39; the game.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You... YOU KNEW THIS WAS GONNA HAPPEN!&quot; Helga snapped.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course I did. This was my punishment. Thankfully, none would ever share my fate. The Lady in Red would change tactics after this. And seek a new game with you. She waited until you became what Maria first pitched as the &#39;immortal dragon king&#39;, and you finished making your world, and she&#39;d begin to infect it with chaos to disturb your vision, which would form the eternal struggle your worshippers would view it as. Or that is the future as it is now. You were free to edit it as you saw fit. This is your world after all. You made a good world Master. It was my honor to serve you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nubia&#39;s body completely turned to sand stone. You hurried over and pressed your hand against Nubia&#39;s cooling body, and you heard her thoughts, in an endless echoing loop. <br />
<br />
&#39;Serve you... serve you... serve you... serve you...&#39; <br />
<br />
You fell to your knees. <br />
<br />
Salomé came from the kitchen, knelt down and hugged you gently, &quot;My boy...&quot; <br />
<br />
Maria and Gwen hugged you. Helga got off Omocha. The maids all bowed their heads. <br />
<br />
You heard cars driving... and you stopped in time to see bread winners coming back to the dioramas... the identical blank units standing out of their cars and at attention. <br />
<br />
You got up, and you opened a window. <br />
<br />
&quot;Become an ideal mate and husband for Blossom,&quot; you said to the unit in front of Blossom&#39;s home and her two babies made from her flesh as a blank unit. <br />
<br />
The unit grew taller, gained the fur pattern of a harlequin rabbit. His head became that of a leporidae, while a cotton tail formed his new rear, along with a rather impressive rabbit&#39;s manhood. His feet grew and expanded, gaining toes. Tiny claws formed as his hands became paws with thumbs. <br />
<br />
&quot;Honey! I&#39;m home!&quot; Blossom came out of the house, gasped at the transformed unit, embraced her mate lovingly. <br />
<br />
You fell back down into one of the living room chairs. <br />
<br />
&quot;Gwen...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, Master?&quot; Gwen asked tenderly.<br />
<br />
&quot;After I create the genie of the sun, brother to the genie of the moon, who will keep the sun of my world healthy and whole for eternity. I command you, and the genies, to use your magic to hold a lavish funeral for every human who was turned into a blank unit. Then we can get to planning to building my world.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gwen was silent, then bow. &quot;As my Master Commands, it&#39;ll be done.&quot; <br />
<br />
You pointed randomly at one of the units. &quot;You. Become the genie of the sun, the brother to the genie of the moon, Phedra. You will take on a personality fitting a loyal, obedient genie. You are tasked with ensuring the sun of my world remains healthy and young, remaining ideal for supporting life as I know it. You name is Shamash.&quot;<br />
<br />
 &quot;Yes, Master.&quot; The unit immediately began to reshape, its body balloon with muscles, looking like the winner of Mr. Universe. Nipples, belly button, all visible.  The unit began to float off the ground, its legs seemingly dissolving into a wispy tail of deep white smoke. Bright golden fur grew from its gray, incomplete form, covering it’s upper body, arms, and head almost completely. <br />
<br />
A long furry tail popped up like a spring just above the point its lower body turned to smoke. Its head morphed into that of a golden wolf, its eyes turned. It’s eyes turned the same bright blue as Phedra. Its long hair of the same color fell down his back.<br />
<br />
The unit turned wolf-genie was then clad in a pair of gold cuffs on his wrists, with a golden band tying his hair up into a chonmage behind his head.<br />
<br />
Below his wispy tail, a simple lamp formed of brightly polished gold appeared. <br />
<br />
&quot;I am as you have made me my Master!&quot; Shamash boomed. &quot;Just as Phedra ensures the moon will continue to nurture your world, so shall I with the sun!&quot; <br />
<br />
Gwen took Phedra bottle from where you&#39;d unconsciously put it on a table. She rubbed it. The rabbit genie of the moon emerged. <br />
<br />
&quot;Brother Shamash,&quot; she bowed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sister Phedra,&quot; he bowed in turn. <br />
<br />
Then Gwen picked up Shamash&#39;s lamp. <br />
<br />
&quot;Come genies...&quot; Gwen sighed. &quot;The Master has command together the three of us serve a glorious funeral for the world that existed before his.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;My Master&#39;s wish is my command!&quot; Declared Samash and Phedra together bowing their heads.</p>
