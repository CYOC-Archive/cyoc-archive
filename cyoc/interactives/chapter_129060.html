<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The biggest problem most uplifted Animalians had with the Super Bowl was the fact that they were still knew to many aspects of football and the NFL. Largely because so much of the sport really didn&#39;t have anything that would reflect things they did before they were uplifted. Many Animalians caught on to sports like volleyball, particularly predatory Animalians, as the batting of the ball over the net mirrored memories of being cubs or puppies and chasing butterflies. Sports like wrestling served a similar function.<br />
<br />
Football, however, included a lot movements and actions that didn&#39;t reflect any natural behavior. Pursuing players to tackle them was somewhat familiar to predator Animalians and dodging them was somewhat familiar to prey Animalians, but even there American football didn&#39;t match natural behaviors in any real way. Players on the field couldn&#39;t wrestle each other and nor could they kick to throw off tacklers. It left Animalians wrestling heavily with the various rules that were part of the game, and most uplifted Animalians were only watching for the commercials and the halftime show.<br />
<br />
However, that didn&#39;t mean that no one was enjoying the game. In fact among some Animalians, there was some degree of enjoyment of the game, even with the unfamiliarity with the rules and actions.<br />
<br />
&quot;They&#39;ve made their mascot to look like you,&quot; Noble said to Eugene as the two sat and one the tables that were set up. Noble had some chicken wings and pork chops on his plate while Eugen had some shrimp, fish, and crab legs. Bald Eagles didn&#39;t normally eat crustaceans, but Eugene did find them fairly tasty and in many ways many of his old tastes for meat hadn&#39;t really diminished.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... many sports teams in America that use the Eagle as a mascot use the Bald Eagle as their mascot,&quot; Eugene answered politely and with a small smile on his beat. While he and Noble were different species and Noble had been his flight instructor, the two had become fairly decent friends. This soon included some socializing which included introducing their mates to each other, and they all seemed to get along.<br />
<br />
&quot;Because the Bald Eagle is the American bird?&quot; Noble asked.<br />
<br />
Eugene and Melanie both nodded with some of the white feathers on their heads overhanging the shirts they were wearing a little bit. To some it might come off as odd, as they were both wearing white shirts that essentially matched their feathers.<br />
<br />
&quot;But lots of other countries also have eagles as their national bird,&quot; Melanie said to Noble, &quot;In fact... in terms of the image of power and grace, the eagle is a pretty universal symbol... Flight is probably a big part of that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fly, Eagles, Fly,&quot; Noble had a smile go over his beak as he repeated the standard cheer that the game had broadcast a couple of times when they went to commercials.<br />
<br />
&quot;You don&#39;t HAVE to root for the team just because you are an eagle,&quot; Eugene commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;And reject a connection a great and noble animal? No way!&quot; Noble answered as he and his mate both nodded and looked up to the screen as the Patriots had a long pass play that covered a lot of yards, but the clock ran out and they went to halftime...<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
The game was really unimportant for either Rift or Jet. Neither were really football fans and generally speaking they weren&#39;t interested in the pop music that went along with the halftime show, however, the party had offered free food and neither Raven felt they could turn that down. And so they sat in a quiet corner with plates of food and glasses of water.<br />
<br />
&quot;The food isn&#39;t bad,&quot; Rift commented as the music from the halftime show played in the background.<br />
<br />
&quot;A shame the music is so coated in sugar,&quot; Jet commented.<br />
<br />
Rift nodded. The halftime show for this year&#39;s super bowl was longer than expected, largely as the performer that the NFL had hired before Canary Diamond and Aqua Marina became popular in the pop music world wouldn&#39;t cancel his performance. In the end it meant having too acts, with Canary Diamond and Aqua Marina being the halftime show&#39;s closing act. Right now the earlier performer was going through his best song, which was actually adapted from a song he put in an animated movie he&#39;d done the previous year. It was something totally upbeat and peppy, something the two goths didn&#39;t entirely tolerate much.<br />
<br />
They weren&#39;t necessarily big fans of Canary Diamond and Aqua Marina, either, but that had more to do with favoring music that worked well with poetry and didn&#39;t carry a beat that felt like it was something inspiring pure joy for no apparent reason. The fact that the Canary Animalian and Rainbow Trout Animalian had become rather successful in such a short period of time with regard to people liking their songs was, however, enough for Rift and Jet to be willing to watch the game in respect for a fellow Animalian. The free food was enough to get them to come to come to the party.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... not every song can be played for a reading of Poe, I suppose,&quot; Rift replied with a shrug, &quot;might as well let people have what they like...&quot;<br />
<br />
Jet nodded her head and collected up a piece of the chicken strips that she&#39;d been eating.<br />
<br />
&quot;And besides, we did come to support a fellow avian,&quot; Rift then finished as the first performer finished his act and the screen went to commercial while they switched between acts, &quot;Canary Diamond may not have our style... but she should have the right soar as high as she can.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jet nodded more firmly to that. While Canary Diamond and Aqua Marina had both attained some popularity, both she and Rift were well aware on the actions of various groups, often parroting the present President&#39;s tweets when something irritated him had essentially carried a great deal of risk for Animalian looking to be in the spotlight. Thankfully no one had taken anything to the point of violence, yet, and at times the present administration would also complement Animalia on something, though usually in relation to physical appearance and sexuality. However that inconsistency meant that Animalia would have to be working hard to keep good PR to win support and marginalize the ability of those that hated them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Quite right,&quot; Jet nodded, as while they may not be fans of pop music, canaries and ravens were both birds. So they would watch for a show of unity.<br />
<br />
And as the screen soon showed the station return to the stadium in Minnesota to show Canary Diamond and Aqua Marina&#39;s performance. Like the previous performer it was a very &quot;pop&quot; style song, but on the whole it did give a general message of hope and progress for everyone cooperating with each other and working in balance with each other and with nature. In this, while it wasn&#39;t Rift and Jet&#39;s preferred style, it wasn&#39;t as though were truly opposed to the message. The two of them watched as the two Animalian performers gave their duet in near perfect sync and near perfect tone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... from a quality standpoint... I think they did very well,&quot; Rift spoke, &quot;what do you think?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They had good lyrics,&quot; Jet commented, &quot;in that words all flowed together rather well. I may not be a fan of the musical genre, but their words flowed quite nicely.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Rift agreed with a nod, &quot;almost like poetry... and they didn&#39;t turn to trying to rhyme everything.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jet nodded and then nuzzled her black beak to her mate&#39;s glossy black feathers on the side of his head and the side of his beak as well. He gave a small caw and returned the nuzzle as well.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you want to stay for the rest of the game?&quot; Jet asked him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not really... but neither do I want to make it seem like we&#39;re walking out on everyone,&quot; Rift answered, &quot;and besides they still have free food.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good point,&quot; Jet gave a cawing chuckle.</p>
