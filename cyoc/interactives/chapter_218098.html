<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Taylor opened her new purple eyes and for a moment she had a hard time believing it wasn’t a dream, then she felt that while one of her arms was under her pillow like it always was the other was snuggling her new breasts. <br />
<br />
She was finally a woman; true she was now a succubus working at Mythtopia for the next five years but when it was over she wouldn’t go back to being a human man but instead the women she had always been in her heart and soul. <br />
<br />
She was about to pleasure herself for the first time, last night she had been too emotional from the change and overall being beat to hell from the changes themselves when there was a knock at the door.<br />
<br />
“Miss Taylor are you awake?” said a nurse from the other side of the door.<br />
<br />
“Yes.” Answered Taylor, her voice sounded very different now, she wouldn’t say music per say but lustful maybe. <br />
The nurse entered with a smile.<br />
<br />
“Alright, we have a busy day so let’s get started.” said the nurse.<br />
<br />
What happened was that Taylor was led to a different room in the hospital where a scanner had been set up. There she was told to strip which she was as the machine scanned every inch of her body.<br />
<br />
“This will allow us to do a physical and allow the costume department to get your measurements for your outfit while you are on stage.” Said the nurse as she began to say a few numbers.<br />
<br />
Only a few of those numbers stood out.<br />
<br />
Taylor’s weight actually hadn’t gone down which surprised her but the nurse said most of her body was now muscle which was denser then fat. <br />
<br />
Her height had gone up so that she stood over 6’1 without horns and with the horns her height was nearly 6’8 and that was without any shoes of any kind on.<br />
<br />
“Cup size D.” finished the nurse as Taylor smiled as she looked at her girls. <br />
<br />
What followed was Taylor getting dressed in normal clothing, instead of the hospital gown she had been wearing for the past couple of days. <br />
<br />
She almost broke down in tears as she put on a bra for the first time, even as the nurse explained that with her new succubus muscle system, she had a natural bra already. Her panties didn’t go up far enough to interfere with her tail, however her new blue jeans had what she thought of a fly in the back to allow her tail out. A pair of simple tennis shoes and a black blouse finished everything off as Taylor looked at herself in the mirror and smiled. <br />
<br />
It was about then that the nurse left and people who ran the actual park walked in.<br />
<br />
“Alright, Miss Taylor.” Said a elf man as he sat across from her as he read from a tablet. “You will be playing the role of a Priestess of Hell in our expanded Underworld land. Think of it kind of like the dark side of fantasy land, vampires, werewolves, succubus and the like call it home.” <br />
<br />
“Yes.” Confirmed Taylor <br />
<br />
“Alright, your role is rather simple but it requires public speaking and singing, your file says you were a Deacon’s son and sung in the choir so you should be able to handle what we want you to do.” Said the Man<br />
<br />
“Which is?” inquired Taylor<br />
<br />
“Basically, we are opening a new show, Church of the Underworld.” Stated the Elf “Your job will be to “run” the church, which is actually a 10 to 15 minute stage show every hour to hour and a half depending on crowds. Calling on the power of darkness and the like, we will walk you through the whole performance, such as the songs and the preaching. Basically, it is a mini church service, they shows will change on a seasonal basis and for special events like Halloween.”<br />
<br />
“Sounds good.” Said Taylor<br />
<br />
“When not on stage you will be back in your “study” which is actually a show sense in the line for our new ride.” Said the man. “There you will be expected to not do anything more then be seen by the public waiting to get on the ride, act like your studying for your next sermon and so on. Maybe practice a few lines in a song, that stuff. You are there to give the guests something to look at while they wait in line for the ride.”<br />
<br />
“Ok.” Said Taylor <br />
<br />
“Good, can we hear your singing voice?” said the other person in the room, a snake women who had so far remained quiet. <br />
<br />
“Alright.” Said Taylor as she began to sing, her voice was different now being a true female voice but it was still beautiful and that caused both of them to nod in approval.<br />
<br />
“Alright, here is what our costume people are thinking for an outfit.” Said the snake women as she pushed across a tablet with a computer image of her in a piece of clothing she had never worn before but one she couldn’t wait to try.<br />
<br />
It was a black skintight dress which went up to her neck in a tight V shape which had black lace over her breasts. It was open back with a black leather corset pushing up her already large chest had a red pentagram in the center. The dress had a double slit on either side of her legs to about her upper cafe so that it hung down in the middle. Knee high black leather boots with what looked to be 9-inch heels and long elbow length black gloves were fingerless and held on to her hand by bands around her middle finger. Her hair was blown out like a 1920’s movie star. The contrast of the black of the outfit and her pale white skin made everything pop.<br />
<br />
“Since you are new to womanhood, we will not make you wear 9 inch heels right away, we will work up to that.” said the Snake women “Men who have made the transitions always have trouble with that.”<br />
<br />
“Thanks, it looks amazing.” said Taylor before pausing. “Can I offer an idea?”<br />
<br />
“Of course.” reassured the snake women in a kind voice. <br />
<br />
“Maybe it’s a little too black.” Stated Taylor “Could the corset be made purple? Like my hair color, and maybe the laces on the boots can match that color as well.”<br />
<br />
“That is a good idea.” confirmed the snake women as she punched the idea into the tablet and the IA program made the changes. If the first outfit was great, this one was perfect. <br />
<br />
“I think we will go with this one, get the team working on it and don’t be surprised if we give you new outfits to special events and so on.” Said the man “anything else?”<br />
<br />
“Am I allowed to have my ears pierced?” inquired Taylor <br />
<br />
“Yes, we will work that in as well.” Confirmed the snake women. “Alright, I think that is all we need of you, housing should be about ready for you and you can move in. We expect you to be at the employee gate to begin orientation and fitting of your new outfits in three days at 9am.”<br />
<br />
“Alright.” Confirmed Taylor <br />
<br />
“And welcome to Mythtopia.” Said the snake women.<br />
<br />
What followed was a light lunch and then Taylor hoped she could go back to her room so that she could explore her new body. What happened next instead was something “almost” as good. A hair stylist came in and did her hair, blowing it out and making long wavy curls like a movie star. She then got some eyeliner and lip stick added, not that she really needed any color with purple lips, but the eye liner made her new eyes pop even more and the lip stick made her lips more lushes. It felt so good to see herself as a woman doing things that any women would do on a normal day. <br />
<br />
After that she wanted to finally go to her room only to find out that housing was on the ball, and she was leaving the transformation center already.<br />
<br />
So with a bag over her shoulder and a suitcase which was now full of clothes her size she got into a car which took her to a normal-looking apartment building. <br />
<br />
That is how only a day after becoming a succubus she was in an elevator heading up to her new apartment that she would be sharing with three other humanoid like creatures, they didn’t have to be succubus’s like her, they could be a werewolf, a vampire or really anything that could live in a normal four bedroom, two bathroom apartment. Well she was about to find out who she would be living with for a while.<br />
<br />
She was about to meet her roommates.</p>
