<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Aaron had a twin brother named Andrew. They were almost perfectly identical even in personality. The biggest difference was that Andrew wasn't interested in computers but instead was interested in real life cars. Aaron and Andrew did like spending time together. They especially liked the popularity they had as twins. But that little bit of difference <br />
in their interests caused a little distance between them. While Aaron would be at a computer expo, Andrew would be at a car expo.<br />
<br />
They had talked about combining their interests by making the ultimate in computerized cars but the circumstances of life frequently got in the way.<br />
<br />
Aaron searched through the options and instructions on the Chronivac and then an idea came to him. &quot;What if I became the ultimate computerized car?&quot;<br />
<br />
Their birthday was coming up and Aaron hadn't come up with a birthday gift yet. So for the next few days Aaron covertly asked questions to get Andrew to describe his dream car. Andrew became suspicious and said, &quot;You're not going to buy me a car, are you? You can't afford it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Aaron evaded the question by answering, &quot;Of course I'm not going to buy you a car.&quot;<br />
<br />
During those days, Aaron also made a few minor tests with the Chronivac just to make sure it worked and would do what he wanted. These were all small tests so he could keep it all a secret.<br />
<br />
Their parents were still alive but the twins had the kind of parents that didn't care much about their kids. They were wealthy enough that the twins had just about anything they wanted but they were often traveling or too busy to notice what their kids were doing. So for the twin's birthday, the parents managed to take an hour from their busy <br />
schedule to have a birthday party and exchange presents before the parents left again. Then Andrew gave Aaron his present, the latest $500.00 handheld computer.<br />
<br />
Then Aaron gave Andrew his gift and Andrew opened the small box to find a car fob and key chain.<br />
<br />
Andrew said, &quot;You didn't. I told you that you can't afford a car. What are you trying to do, show me up? Make my gift look pathetic?&quot;<br />
<br />
Aaron said, &quot;No brother. I happened to just get a really good deal and in truth, my gift is a gift for both of us. I love the computer you gave me. Thank you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Andrew asked, &quot;So where is this car you've somehow hidden? It can't be here or I would have seen it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Aaron said, &quot;Just come with me to the garage and my secret will be revealed.&quot;<br />
<br />
Andrew followed incredulously. The garage was spacious and clean . . . and empty. Andrew asked, &quot;So where is it? Is this some kind of joke?&quot;<br />
<br />
Aaron said, &quot;No but you might get a little weirded out. Promise me that you'll stay calm. It will make sense to you in a moment.&quot;<br />
<br />
Then Aaron began removing his clothes. Andrew asked, &quot;What are you doing?&quot;<br />
<br />
Aaron said, &quot;I don't want my clothes ruined.&quot;<br />
<br />
Andrew said, &quot;Alright but I am getting weirded out.&quot;<br />
<br />
When Aaron was naked he said, &quot;Now push the button on the fob. It's a difficult button to push to keep you from pushing it accidentally. You'll have to use some muscle to get the button pushed.&quot;<br />
<br />
Andrew used both hands to squeeze the button before it finally triggered. Aaron suddenly jumped as an electric jolt ran through him.<br />
<br />
Andrew asked, &quot;You've given me a taser to tase you with?&quot;<br />
<br />
Aaron was about to answer but the transformation he was undergoing answered for him. His skin immediately turned metallic: Silver at first and then parts of him turned metallic red. He was a deep cranberry red, Andrew's favorite color. Andrew backed up but he was too bewildered by what he was seeing to know how to react. So he just fell down <br />
and watched.<br />
<br />
Aaron grew larger and as he grew, he fell forward onto his hands and knees. Now Aaron had spent hours programming the Chronivac so that he wouldn't just transform the typical way you'd think a person would transform into a car. His eyes did not become headlights. His ass did not become the trunk. As far as Andrew could tell, Aaron was being <br />
twisted inside out in all kinds of strange ways. As far as Aaron could tell, he could never describe what it felt like for his mouth to wander down his side to become the gas cap or what it felt like for his ears to wander inside his head to become a microphone on the dashboard.<br />
<br />
When it was over, Andrew saw an almost exact replica of his dream car. It was a unique model blending the best features of several of the most popular cars. It had a sports car look but a town car interior. It looked like it would fit into a James Bond movie.<br />
<br />
Andrew tentatively asked, &quot;Aaron, are you okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
Aaron said, &quot;I'm fine. That was an interesting experience but I feel fine.&quot;<br />
<br />
Andrew heard the voice come from inside the car and when he looked inside, right above where the radio was, there was a computer interface with microphone, speakers, USB ports, DVD drive and a small digital screen. The digital screen was not large enough for images but what Aaron had said was printed on the screen in text.<br />
<br />
Andrew said, &quot;Aaron, you turned into a car. Am I dreaming?&quot;<br />
<br />
Aaron said, &quot;You're not dreaming. Maybe I'll tell you someday how I did it but for now that's my secret. And I can change back to human whenever you push the button on that fob so be careful with that fob. Guard it with your life. I don't want to be out on a date and suddenly burst out of my clothes changing into a car in front of my girlfriend.&quot;<br />
<br />
Andrew then began to get into it. He ran his hand along the car feeling the smooth finish. &quot;You became a car for me. You turned yourself into my car for my birthday.&quot;<br />
<br />
Aaron said, &quot;Well sort of. I don't really think of myself as belonging to you. This is a gift for both of us, remember.&quot;<br />
<br />
Andrew said, &quot;Yea, I remember. Don't worry. I won't treat you like a slave. I don't have any domineering tendencies. But I will have to register you or I could get into trouble driving an unregistered vehicle.&quot;<br />
<br />
Aaron said, &quot;I understand.&quot;<br />
<br />
Andrew said, &quot;You are one beautiful car. I'm getting a boner.&quot;<br />
<br />
Aaron said, &quot;Um, Andrew?&quot;<br />
<br />
Andrew lifted the hood and the engine looked normal except for one box deep in the back behind the engine. &quot;What's that box in the back?&quot;<br />
<br />
Aaron said, &quot;That's my computer brain.&quot;<br />
<br />
Andrew asked, &quot;You can see where I just pointed?&quot;<br />
<br />
Aaron said, &quot;I now have several eyes all over my car body. You'll see them as miniaturized cameras. Most of them allow me to see the road so that with practice, I'll be able to drive myself but I can also see inside myself so I can tell you if there's anything wrong such as being low on fluids.&quot;<br />
<br />
Andrew asked, &quot;What did your mouth become?&quot;<br />
<br />
Aaron said, &quot;I have several mouths, each one the intake for different fluids. I've programed my taste buds also to detect the purity of the different fluids so the good quality fuel will taste like good coffee to me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Andrew laughed, &quot;And your nose?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My nose is the radiator and my respiratory system is the heater and air conditioner. The engine itself is my digestive system. My heart is the battery and electrical system.&quot;<br />
<br />
Andrew asked, &quot;So if your battery becomes drained, does your heart stop beating?&quot;<br />
<br />
Aaron said, &quot;No but I do go into sleep mode. As a car, I have three levels. I can be asleep. I can be awake by turning on the electricity without starting the engine. Or I can be super awake with my engine running.&quot;<br />
<br />
Andrew asked, &quot;Do you want to go for a test drive and be super awake?&quot;<br />
<br />
Aaron said, &quot;Absolutely.&quot;<br />
<br />
Andrew drove Aaron around. He stopped by to get his new vehicle registered and insured before heading out to the beach.<br />
<br />
Andrew didn't tell Aaron but driving cars turned him on and Andrew had the biggest boner he had ever had in his pants.<br />
<br />
Aaron didn't tell Andrew but he'd programmed the Chronivac to make being driven arousing to Aaron. Aaron had said that his engine running meant he was super awake but that was his code for saying that it made him sexually aroused but he didn't want anyone to know. Aaron could still feel every touch on his 'skin'. The steering wheel, gear shift <br />
and the pistons inside the engine were his erogenous zones. Aaron essentially felt like his balls were begin fondled every time someone touched the steering wheel, his cock was being squeezed every time his gear was grabbed, and his cock was relentlessly thrusting into a hole each time one of his pistons moved.<br />
<br />
As the drove, Aaron moaned and said, &quot;This feels so good. Slower now, please.&quot;</p>
