<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Katie looked at Tiffany as an impish grin crossed her face. She had already seen what Tiffany would look like in her thirties, she might as well see what she looked like as a kid. Quickly looking around the store Katie made sure the place was empty before wishing Tiffany to be seven again. &quot;Now I just need to stall her while she gets younger,&quot; she thought.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can is interest you in anything else today,&quot; Tiffany asked. Katie smiled, this would be the perfect opportunity that she was looking for. &quot;Maybe you can show me some of the other jewelry you have,&quot; she answered. Tiffany smiled warmly. &quot;Sure follow me,&quot; she said as she led Katie to a private section of the store.<br />
<br />
Katie watched Tiffany as she walked. Tiffany was a waifish girl with a slim figure, small perky breasts, and platinum blonde hair. Katie could see the girl had already regressed down from 19 to 18. The changes were subtle so far, Tiffany seemed a little slimmer as she led Katie into a private section. Tiffany was now adjusting her loose cargo pants that were starting to slide on her narrow hips.  &quot;So what kind of jewelry are you looking for,&quot; she said, shrinking down to 17. &quot;I&#39;m not sure,&quot; Katie said. &quot;Maybe earrings.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tiffany smiled as she knelt down to show off the the various earrings she had in stock. &quot;These are some of our more expensive pieces,&quot; Tiffany stated becoming 16.  Her voice rose slightly in crave as she shrank down another inch in height.  &quot;Why don&#39;t you look them over and tell me what you think?&quot;<br />
<br />
Katie smiled as the teenage girl looked her over. Now pretending to look at earrings Katie glanced over at Tiffany as she continued regressing. Katie watched as Tiffany slowly dropped from 15 to 14 then 13. Now barely a teenager Tiffany had lost about six inches in height causing her already baggy pants to begin to pool around her feet. Tiffany appeared to be a late bloomer as most of curves were wiped away,leaving her with a boyish figure with softball sized breasts that were quickly deflating.<br />
<br />
As Tiffany left her teens behind becoming 12, Katie watched as her breasts deflated to small bumps that barely pushed out her now baggy t-shirt. &quot;What would you recommend,&quot; Katie asked. &quot;Well this is a nice piece,&quot; Tiffany squeaked in a childish voice. &quot;It accentuates your eyes.&quot; Katie took the earrings from the Tiffany&#39;s small hands and looked at the small girl. Tiffany was now 11. Katie couldn&#39;t help but marvel at the young girl who she thought looked like a pixie with her soft features and short blond hair. Tiffany was also smaller than most 11 year olds and now had to look almost straight up to look Katie in the eye.  &quot;What do you think,&quot; she asked. &quot;Do you like these earrings?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They seem nice but I&#39;m not sure,&quot; Katie said. &quot;What about the pieces on the shelf. Can I see those?&quot;<br />
<br />
Tiffany nodded enthusiastically as she became ten. Katie suppressed a giggle as Tiffany tried to make her way to the shelf. Tiffany&#39;s van shoes barely hung on her diminutive feet. Tiffany now needed two hands to hold up her far too large jeans that threatened to cascade down her skinny legs. The young girl seemed to have a confused look on her face as she took in her ill fitting outfit. Finally shrugging the now nine year old grabbed the earrings and made her way back to the counter, leaving her shoes behind. &quot;Here you go,&quot; she chirped happily.<br />
<br />
Katie smiled warmly and examined the earrings. They were nice but she was more interested in watching Tiffany&#39;s regression. Katie watched as Tiffany became eight. The young girl was now barely taller than the counter, which rested around Katie&#39;s midsection. Tiffany looked anxiously at Katie as she shrunk down to seven. Katie couldn&#39;t help but find this little pixie of a child adorable as her eyes now barely rose above the counter. &quot;Do you like them?&quot; She asked as she stood on tiptoes to look at Katie. Katie nodded and smiled. &quot;Yeah I think I will,&quot;<br />
<br />
Reaching into her pocket she produced the cash for the earrings and waved to the little girl. Tiffany waved excitedly as she still tried to hold her pants up. &quot;Tell your friends,&quot; the little girl yelled excitedly. Katie nodded and smiled wishing Tiffany to be 19 as soon as she left the store. <br />
<br />
Katie now walked to the department store Grace was shopping at. After a few moments she found the young teen happily trying on clothes. &quot;Hey Grace how&#39;s it going,&quot; Katie called. Grace turned and smiled. &quot;Great,&quot; she said excitedly. &quot;Fully embracing my youth. So tell me what do you think?&quot;<br />
<br />
Katie loked at the teenage Grace and smiled. Grace now wore a purple tank top with jean shorts and a pair of bedazzled sandals. Katie couldn&#39;t help but smile. &quot;If I didn&#39;t know better I would swear you were a real teen.&quot; Grace smiled and thanked Katie. &quot;You know as much fun as I&#39;m having we are going to have to get home soon.&quot; Grace said. &quot;Kellie will be home in a little over an hour. You don&#39;t want her being home alone at her current age.&quot;<br />
<br />
Katie nodded. &quot;Your right we should probably get going.&quot;<br />
<br />
The two teens paid for graces new clothes and made their way to the car as they drove the new friends talked about of much fun they had during the day. &quot;Thank you for this Katie,&quot; Grace said. &quot;I haven&#39;t had this much fun in years.&quot; Katie smiled and gave Grace a hug. &quot;Anytime Grace,&quot; she said. &quot;I think we should do this again some time.&quot;<br />
<br />
Grace nodded enthusiastically. &quot;Absolutely,&quot; she said. &quot;But I was thinking of something else.&quot; Katie gave Grace a curious look. &quot;What&#39;s your idea?&quot; She asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well your going to have to become 29 again,&quot; she said. &quot;If Kellie sees you like this she&#39;s going to know you got younger and might ask questions.&quot; Katie nodded, she would need to become older again. &quot;What I&#39;m thinking about is this. I can help your mom embrace her childhood by becoming seven as well. Maybe with my help she would enjoy her youth before you turn in back into your mom.&quot;<br />
<br />
Katie thought about it for a moment, maybe Grace could help her mom. &quot;Okay that&#39;s a gear idea,&quot; she said. &quot;So do you want to become seven now?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s the part I need your help with,&quot; Grace said. &quot;Should you introduce me as a seven year old girl your watching or should I regress in front of Kellie as let&#39;s say a 29 year old so that Kellie feels we have more in common.&quot;<br />
<br />
Katie now thought about her options. Would Kellie react better to a girl she thought was already seven or a woman who was in the same predicament as her.</p>
