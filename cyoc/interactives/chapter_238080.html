<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Andy was making lots of changes lately. <br />
<br />
He had given himself the ability to know everything that a book contained just by touching it. He could easily apply that knowledge at any given time. HIs classes were all so easy. Everything he learned was super easy and he had lots of time. It made him a bit insatiable. He wanted to be superior to other men and for them to be almost embarrassed by how much more he knew than they did, so he visited the school bookstore and absorbed books from every class in the school. He now had the knowledge of dozens of PHDs and was quite possibly one of the most knowledgeable men on the planet. <br />
<br />
Andy looked at himself in the mirror. He actually hadn&#39;t changed his features at all, but they were quite handsome, now that he thought about it. Of course, that might have something to do with being 6&#39;5&quot; and having a footlong cock. It was amazing what being that tall and hung did for a man&#39;s confidence. Andy had deepset eyes and ginger hair. He&#39;d changed his hair to dark brown-ginger a month back. It complimented him so much better. He had an infectious smile. He&#39;d given himself a larger, more masculine chin as well. It was amazing what a LARGE difference something like a chin could do for a man&#39;s self-esteem. He liked to rub his big chin now. It felt so strong. <br />
<br />
Over the last month, he had changed his face only slightly. It was longer and slightly more masculine now. His voice had dropped by an octave. He had aged himself in looks by about three years so now he looked 21. His hair had receded just an inch or so and Andy was pleased with the result. <br />
<br />
People looked up to Andy now. He was one of the most popular men in college. Tristan, however. He looked pathetic. Andy had taken away his blond locks and given him curly black hair. He thought it was an improvement. Tristan barely came up to Andy&#39;s pec shelf now. Not that he had much of a pec shelf. But that could come in time. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, how&#39;s my favorite little roommate doing?&quot; Andy asked Tristan, who was sneaking in trying to remain unseen. <br />
<br />
&quot;Um. I&#39;m fine.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Bro, you don&#39;t look fine! You know, I was thinking. Maybe you should have a nickname.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;A...a nickname?&quot; Tristan said, trying to avoid eye contact. He was fully gay now and he could barely stand to be around Andy. Andy was so tall and gorgeous now. His mind was full of burning questions. Why did they look so different? Their hair had changed and their heights had changed and it didn&#39;t make any sense why no one noticed and he couldn&#39;t say anything! <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, bro. I came up with one! Hobbit!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Hobbit?&quot; Tristan looked crestfallen. He looked WAY up at Andy&#39;s beaming smile. Andy was so proud of himself all the time. He was just a beaming example of manhood, with his big man&#39;s jeans and hefty chin. Meanwhile, Tristan had to buy clothes out of the boy&#39;s section at Target still. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, bro. Everyone&#39;s gonna love it. I think we should just call you Hobbit in front of everyone. I told the guys your new name, okay? I hope you don&#39;t mind!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;No. It&#39;s...it&#39;s okay. I just...wish I was like you.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You can&#39;t wish for that, bro! Just be happy to be yourself! You know, there are some girls that think you&#39;re pretty adorable, even if you are almost a midget!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh. That&#39;s nice,&quot; Tristan lied. He was so shy now. Everything had changed. Why had everything changed. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, man! You&#39;re really cute. You should look at yourself in the mirror!&quot; Andy picked up his friend by the armpits suddenly, as if he was lifting a little boy. Tristan&#39;s eyes bulged. He&#39;d never been manhandled like this before and it was such a huge turn on!<br />
<br />
There they were, looking at each other in the mirror. <br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re so much bigger than me,&quot; Tristan said, with a mixture of sadness and horniness. <br />
<br />
&quot;You know, we&#39;re alone here tonight,&quot; Andy said, turning on his charm. &quot;Why don&#39;t we just relax? You like relaxing, don&#39;t you?&quot; He started to rub Tristan&#39;s small little shoulders. His arms were like pipe cleaners now! Andy hadn&#39;t had sex with another man since he&#39;d become a tall 6&#39;5&quot; giant! &quot;You know, I uh...couldn&#39;t help but notice something. You seem to uh...really like it when we&#39;re alone. Isn&#39;t that right, Hobbit?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes!&quot; Tristan blurted out. He&#39;d been jerking off to guys for weeks now. Any vestige of heterosexuality was simply gone now. <br />
<br />
&quot;You know, I don&#39;t think you&#39;ve been honest with me, bro,&quot; Andy said, feigning in his voice that he was putting something together. &quot;It just feels like maybe...you really like being around me...you know...the way I like being around girls,&quot; he stroked the back of Tristan&#39;s head. Tristan moaned. &quot;I knew it. You are gay, aren&#39;t you? You can admit it, Hobbit!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I am! I didn&#39;t know I was gay! I thought I was straight! I don&#39;t understand what&#39;s happening!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, it&#39;s alright, little Hobbit bro!&quot; Andy looked at himself in the mirror. He put a big manly hand on Tristan&#39;s puny shoulder. It really was like being around a junior high school kid with stubble. He&#39;d left Tristan his stubble. Now that Tristan was Andy&#39;s plaything, he could be whatever Andy wanted him to be. &quot;Maybe uh...I can help you out. And you can help me out. Come on,&quot; Andy said, picking Tristan up and carrying him back to their dorm room. They had the same size twin beds but Andy&#39;s didn&#39;t fit him anymore and his legs hung over the edge when he went to sleep now. He could have made the bed bigger but it just turned him on to outgrow everything around him. <br />
<br />
Tristan whimpered as Andy started kissing him. He was being held by a big strong man the way a father would hold a child in his arms! He had never been more turned on before!<br />
<br />
&quot;You and I can have some real little fun, my Hobbit bro. You ever see what a real man&#39;s dick looks like, huh?&quot; Andy had already shrunk Tristan&#39;s own dick down to only 3 inches and he smiled with pride as he unzipped to show off his own package. Tristan&#39;s eyes bulged. He&#39;d seen Andy&#39;s giant schlong before but now that he wasn&#39;t a confident bro...now that he was some gay little wimp, he was absolutely drooling. Andy&#39;s dick was MAGNIFICENT! It was the biggest dick any girl on campus had ever seen. 12 inches of absolute man meat. <br />
<br />
&quot;How...how can I even...I don&#39;t know how to even have sex with a dick that big!&quot; Tristan blurted out. Never mind that he was now a virgin with a separate set of straight memories where he&#39;d been a jock conquering pussy left and right. Now he was just a little man in a big world. Andy&#39;s world. Literally. Andy smirked. I own this world now. It obeys my rules. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, don&#39;t worry about a thing, Hobbit. Just suck me off and swallow all my man juice. It&#39;s what you&#39;ve waited your whole life for!&quot; <br />
<br />
His former homophobic roommate drooled. He still had the same handsome features but he was now practically half the man he used to be! Before he could stop himself, Tristan was picking up the flashlight sized schlong and putting Andy&#39;s giant cockhead up to his mouth. He was barely able to fit Andy&#39;s manly dickhead in his fag mouth. He moaned as Andy smiled over his prize, his now deflated little gaywad roommate. <br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck yeah that feels real nice! Let me sit down on the bed. You can get on your knees and suck from the floor.&quot; <br />
<br />
Andy&#39;s gargantuan dick bobbed up and down as the bed groaned underneath his weight. Tristan happily obliged. Before he knew it, Andy&#39;s cum was aching to get out. He had, after all, the ability to produce about 4 times the average amount of cum with his enormous balls. Tristan had never thought he could enjoy having a giant dick in his face but now it was his entire life. He wanted nothing more than to swallow Andy&#39;s amazing manseed. He had never tasted cum before and he was sucking like a pro! Andy grabbed Tristan&#39;s little head and forced his giant cock down the little guy&#39;s throat. Tristan gagged. Andy had changed Tristan to be an expert cocksucker with above average skills. Tristan breathed through his nose and held down his gag reflex. He was in love with this...this was the best thing that had ever happened to him! All his memories of being a straight douchebag paled in comparison to being conquered by Andy&#39;s giant cock! <br />
<br />
Finally, the little guy got what he needed the most. Andy began shooting cum directly into Tristan&#39;s belly. Hot jizz hit his stomach and Tristan moaned as he felt himself absorbing the big man&#39;s cum, swimming around in his stomach as if he&#39;d just drank a tall glass of milk. The sheer volume of it was amazing. Andy pulled out a little to let Tristan taste what was coming next. He came a second time shortly after his first glass worth of cum had filled Tristan&#39;s belly. Now he was working Tristan&#39;s head gently over his cockhead and he felt the aching release of a second orgasm. Andy&#39;s mouth filled with the man nectar and he had never in his life tasted anything so good before. It was ambrosia. Food of the gods, a true delight. The best meal of his life. Tristan made sure to get every drop. <br />
<br />
&quot;Man, you&#39;re almost as good at eating my cum as a chick!&quot; <br />
<br />
Tristan moaned. Andy&#39;s manhood still stood at full mast. Andy got up and his cock flopped around like the giant banana it was. Andy took his shirt off. Though he wasn&#39;t entirely built yet, he was soon on his way to major studhood. He picked Tristan up and carried him like a child again into the bathroom shower. He gently let the little guy down onto the tiles. <br />
<br />
&quot;Soap up my dick and clean it off, okay HOBBIT?&quot; He smirked. He was getting so arrogant. He was really going to enjoy where this took their relationship. Tristan couldn&#39;t even reach up to Andy&#39;s face. He held his hand up, wanting to touch Andy&#39;s perfect chin, like a child reaching out for his favorite toy. &quot;You want to come up here, little fella? Huh, Hobbit?&quot; He patted Tristan on the head patronizingly. Andy was so satisfied with himself. He truly was a gorgeous specimen of manhood while Tristan had shrunk into a pathetic little fag. <br />
<br />
Andy waited until he was toweled off before he picked Tristan up yet again. He sat him down on the bathroom counter and whereas before his legs dangled there like the miniscule little freak he was. Andy moved in closer and kissed his former straight jock bro roommate, long and hard...telling Tristan &#39;I own you now&#39;. <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m the one that changed everything, stupid. I made myself big. And I made you into a fucking short bitch. Isn&#39;t that great, stupid?&quot; <br />
<br />
&#39;How?&quot; Tristan wondered out loud. Andy shut him up and kissed him again. <br />
<br />
&quot;Not important, bitch. What&#39;s important is that from now on, you do what I say. When I say it. You understand me, you faggy little Hobbit bitch? Huh, Tristan?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Tristan mumbled. &quot;I&#39;d do anything for you. You&#39;re like...you&#39;re like a god and I&#39;m almost a dwarf!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, that&#39;s exactly it! And you&#39;re not allowed to tell anyone things used to be different. I like you like this. Short and faggy. It&#39;s way better than before. You were such a douchebag before! Haha! But now I&#39;m WAY taller than you! Isn&#39;t that great!?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve honestly never been this turned on before!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Why don&#39;t you go fetch me a couple of burgers and uh...buy yourself some fries, Hobbit.&quot; Andy dug out his wallet and handed some cash to his new fag cocksucker. &quot;And uh...pick me up a pack of Camels, too. Oh wait, they won&#39;t sell you cigarettes. You look 12! HA!&quot; <br />
<br />
Tristan&#39;s mind was swimming. &quot;You smoke now?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d thought I&#39;d try it out. Don&#39;t worry about a thing, Hobbit. Everything is as it should be. Now go get my burgers, Asshole! Chip chop, I&#39;m fucking hungry!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Okay.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, what?&quot; Tristan was perplexed. Andy looked down at him patiently. &quot;You call me SIR from now on, Short Round.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh. Right. Of course. Sir. SIR. I&#39;ll get your burgers right away, SIR.&quot; <br />
<br />
When he had left the dorm, Andy sauntered back into his room and dug out the book. God, he loved being this tall and with such a huge dick but...he needed just a little bit more. <br />
<br />
&quot;I now have a very deep voice. It&#39;s deeper than most men&#39;s voices. It&#39;s in the top 5% of the deepness range. Most people can&#39;t wait to do what I say when they hear my voice. I am also going to gain 100 pounds of muscle...&quot; Andy thought about it and although he really wanted the slow burn of gaining muscle, he opted for a faster route. &quot;over the next week. No one will notice. Everyone will always think my appearance is how I normally look.&quot;  The power was going to his head. He was dizzy with it. &quot;I also have a commanding personality type. I am very comfortable telling other people what to do and they naturally respond by wanting to please me. 90 percent of people can&#39;t wait to obey me and do what I say. Lesser straight men on the bottom ten percent of the psychosexual hierarchy tend to be jealous and bitter of me but no one ever pays them any attention. Any jealousy or bitterness that come my way bring people closer to my side and makes them want to do what I say even more. Also, for the jealous and bitter lesser straight men, being around me for more than a few days will turn them gay when they are around larger gay men.&quot; Andy smiled. He wanted to leave himself some challenges after all.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tristan is no longer attracted to anyone other than me. I am the only person on Earth he is sexually stimulated by. He will always remember his former life. He will from this day on be my servant, following me around loyally attending to my needs. Everyone will think of this as normal. I am Tristan&#39;s hero now. He truly looks up to me and would do anything I tell him to do happily. Tristan is most fulfilled when he&#39;s carrying out my orders.&quot; <br />
<br />
Reality was swimming around Andy now. He could feel his entire life churning and his godhood powers were making him almost glow. He closed the book and smirked again. <br />
<br />
He couldn&#39;t wait for the next week to see him become a practical Herculean demigod!</p>
