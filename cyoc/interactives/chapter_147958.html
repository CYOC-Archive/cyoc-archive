<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;And now,&quot; came the voice from the speakers in the bar&#39;s walls, &quot;for the last match of the evening due to a surprising absence from team star Ryder Trueman, Roman Lector from the Bulls of Bastion will face off against Andy Weld from the Stags of Stallfall.&quot;  <br />
<br />
&#39;Surprising?&#39; Roman thought with an amused scoff. &#39;What would have been surprising if Ryder had been able to compete at all. Guy came so often in the last hour that he would have been limp as a whiskey dick even if we&#39;d turned him back into a man before the competition.&#39;<br />
<br />
He hid a smirk remembering how Kai had come so hard with Ryder that his sperm had hit Dakota, Austin AND Dallas. Ryder had been a  boneless mess unable to speak no matter how loud they changed his volume. His protesting about not staying a dick more than one night weren&#39;t very convincing since he was cosntantly turning himself back into a dick. <br />
<br />
Andy Weld stepped into the ring in a tight red and white bodysuit that clung to his abs and his groin. Roman could make out the shape of his future cock right here and there. He had chosen well, saving the piece of resistance for last. <br />
<br />
They&#39;d met the Stags in the local sportscenter last week, the day after the party. It HAD been a coincidence, and they, alpha males riding the high of using Ryder as their collective cock, had bumped into the team of athletes and instantly recognized them. <br />
<br />
&#39;You guys are going down!&#39; The Stag&#39;s team captain had sneered. <br />
<br />
Kai had grinned in reply. &#39;Yeah, we&#39;ll be going down on you pricks. You&#39;ll feel it all week.&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;In fact,&#39; Roman had cut in, &#39;we should make a wager. Prove which one of us are real men and which one of us are only dicks.&#39;<br />
<br />
The captain had raised an eyebrow and looked Roman up and down. &#39;No need for a bet to know which is which, dick.&#39;<br />
<br />
Kai had laughed and rummaged through his sport&#39;s bag. &quot;I beg to differ. Tada!&quot; he had said, holding out Ryder, asleep after another round of team bonding. <br />
<br />
The Stags had chuckled and hurled a few swears. &#39;You really think a dildo is gonna prove your point?&#39;<br />
<br />
Austin had started to say something about Ryder being much more than a dildo when Roman had raised a hand to silence him. &#39;You got a team member who can&#39;t compete, right? Same as us. That him?&#39;<br />
<br />
A large, beefcake of a dude stepped forward on a pair of crutches. His left foot was covered in bandages. <br />
<br />
Hugo had been pretty explicit, and helpful. &quot;This laser pointer can work like a dicking camera, but it&#39;s really a prototype, it doesn&#39;t have a lot of power. If you want to restore someone after dicking them, you&#39;ll need to return to my lab, alright? So always make sure one of you remains a guy, or else you&#39;ll be stuck as dicks until someone helps you. And try not to make someone stay dicked for more than a week? There could be... side-effects.&quot;<br />
<br />
&#39;What&#39;s it to you?&#39;<br />
<br />
Roman pointed the laser straight at the injured guy, and there was a brief flash of light. <br />
<br />
&quot;TODD!&quot; shouted his teams as they saw their teammates&#39; cloth fall down to the floor, empty. <br />
<br />
Almost empty. The red tip of a dickhead was poking out of the beefcake&#39;s red boxers. Stunned, the captain had picked up the dick, up till he&#39;d needed a second hand to keep him firmly in grasp. That Todd bastard was packing a monster cock. Ryder looked inadequate in comparison, despite being nine inches long and seven thick. <br />
<br />
&quot;Shit, you weren&#39;t kidding,&quot; the captain had said. &quot;Turn him back and we can start talking.&quot;<br />
<br />
Austin had shown their hands then by snickering. <br />
<br />
Kai shrugged. &quot;We can&#39;t. You need to see a specialist for that.&quot;<br />
<br />
The indignant shouts burst into the dimly lit hallway, and it was only Roman&#39;s cunning that allowed them to avoid coming to blows. &quot;Relax, it can be reversed. We&#39;ll tell you after the tournament. He was your one player sitting out anyway, wasn&#39;t he? Same as ours.&quot;<br />
<br />
A look of comprehension lit up the captain&#39;s eyes as he glanced at Ryder. &quot;What&#39;s the bet?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Simple.&quot; Roman had lifted three fingers. &quot;When someone on either team is eliminated, they&#39;re dicked and become the property of the winner until our teams&#39; next match.&quot;<br />
<br />
Austin and Dallas had loudly protested that they didn&#39;t want to get turned into dicks, what the hell?<br />
<br />
&quot;Shut up. It&#39;s a bet, both risk something. Or are you not real men?&quot; They shut up. &quot;Thought so. Next, the winner can do whatever he wants with the dicked loser, but except getting rid of them. Got to keep them with you or somewhere secure. That&#39;s just common decency. Anything else goes. Dicks are made to be used by men, that&#39;s what you should expect if you lose.&quot;<br />
<br />
The angry expressions became to make way for fear and concern. Roman, however, felt his crotch heat up with lust. He was going to turn them all into dicks so very soon.<br />
<br />
&quot;Three, if you become able to communicate, then you can ask to remain dicked forever. Don&#39;t waste someone&#39;s time by forcing them on a trip to university.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What kind of sick freak would want that?&quot; The stag&#39;s co-captain growled, but the captain didn&#39;t add anything, his fingers absentmindedly running along Todd&#39;s length. <br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s a deal, fucker. We&#39;ll meet in the arena.&quot; <br />
<br />
And here they were. Face to face. Representing their team at last. <br />
<br />
Austin, Dakota and Dallas were disappointments in most meanings of the term. They&#39;d lost both their matches and their right to remain human. In defeat though, they at least presented themselves as one thin white cock, one latino cock and one fat seven incher. Better than nothing. It would only motivate his opponents for the next match. <br />
<br />
Elam had won, barely, and earned himself a chubby little dick for his troubles. <br />
<br />
The bell rang, and Roman threw himself into the fight. He left no time for Andy to fight back and tackled him to the ground. The move clearly stunned Andy, and Roman pressed his advantage. He twisted one arm and pinned him in place with both knees. In desperation, Andy bucked and managed to hit Roman in the crotch. <br />
<br />
Roman grinned wildly. Nothing there today! &quot;Eager, huh?&quot; he growled into his opponent&#39;s ears. &quot;Don&#39;t worry, I kept it safe and smooth for you. You&#39;ll love it down there.&quot;<br />
<br />
His opponents&#39; bravado faltered. The smirk turned into a grimace, the movement of his wrists grew frantic. He was struggling, bucking, trashing, but the referee began the inevitable countdown.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ten... Nine...&quot;<br />
<br />
Andy desperately attempted to push Roman off him, snapping. &quot;I won&#39;t let you get away with what you did to Todd and Tommy and Vince!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah! You&#39;re going to join them. I&#39;m going to dick you. You&#39;re going to become my big. Fat. COCK!&#39; he punctuated that last word with a powerful slam that made Andy&#39;s eyes unfocus. His muscles went slack. <br />
<br />
The bell rang three times. He&#39;d won. <br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck,&quot; Andy muttered, and how right that was. <br />
<br />
The laser pointer worked its magic immediately, and the uniform collapsed under Roman. He hit his knees on the ring, grinning as he went fishing for the nice big dick he&#39;d been eying all night. Nine inches, hairy and straight as an arrow. But better than everything, his and his alone. No sharing his cock with other teammates!<br />
<br />
Roman wasted no time waiting for the sake of a mere medal or congratulations. He had a much better trophy with him. Roman ran to the lockers room and frantically shoved his dicked opponent into his pants. Fuck subtlety. Tingling ran through his crotch as he felt the attachment work its magic, and his new dick lock itself where he had been smooth and dickless a moment&#39;s before. <br />
<br />
&quot;HA! How do you feel now, dickhead? Good, I bet!&quot; he sang-song, swirling his head and letting his dick swing with the momentum. Andy was longer than Roman. He should have been jealous, but how could one be jealous when the object of your jealousy was a powerless prick stuck between your legs. <br />
<br />
Kai and Elam, the only other human members of his team left, drooled. They were holding their opponents by the balls, likely teasing before getting to the main meal. Roman didn&#39;t have the patience.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, guys, time to start educating those dicks about their place in the real world.&quot;</p>
