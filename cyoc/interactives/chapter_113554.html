<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Okay I accept,&quot; Isaac said<br />
<br />
&quot;Just for you to know your&#39;re not going to be male anymore.&quot; Flora said touching your dick, and it suddenly detatched from Isaac&#39;s body leaving a slit behind.<br />
<br />
Isaac began growing sky blue scales on his back, and pale ones on his stomach. Isaac&#39;s hands, and feet became claws, but he kept his thumbs. As that happens Isaac&#39;s nipples became erect, and two mounds formed at their base. The mounds expanded forming two DD cup breasts, and each were erect with pleasure. Isaac began squeezing her newfound breasts, and groaning at their sensitivity, and the sensation they gave her. Isaac barely noticed the rest of her transformation, and as she pleasured herself she grew a tail, wings, and wider hips. Isaac finally took notice when her head changed as she lost her hair and grew a muzzle, horns, carnivorous teeth, and horns. Isaac continued pleasuring herself until her breasts began to ache, and then she let go of them and inspected her body.<br />
<br />
&quot;I see pleasure overtakes the senses when transformation is an issue. Or at least it is for you.&quot; Flora said<br />
<br />
Isaac cupped her breasts in embarrassment, and responded,&quot;I just.....&quot; she began but paused at her voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s fine, and natural when such a transformation takes place I just didn&#39;t expect you to ignore your other changes like that. I suggest you stay with me as well.&quot; Flora said<br />
<br />
&quot;Why?&quot; Isaac asked cocking her head to the side<br />
<br />
&quot;Because you know nothing about your species, or know anything about being female. So unless you want to take your chances and either get raped by a desperate male, or get killed I suggest you follow me.&quot; Flora said <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh um, okay,&quot; Isaac replied considering the fact that Flora was correct.<br />
<br />
Isaac followed Flora outside the temple, and into a village of dragon-kins, and dragons. &quot;This is Clawsreach, and it&#39;s where you&#39;ll live from now on.&quot; Flora said <br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll question why seeing things here already.&quot; Isaac said <br />
<br />
&quot;I suggest you make up a name or become less submissive within the next 10 seconds, because a male is approaching you.&quot; Flora said<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, um you haven&#39;t been here before have you?&quot; The male said <br />
<br />
&quot;Not really,&quot; you responded<br />
<br />
&quot;I thought so, besides your pecs look amazing compared to the majority here.&quot; He said <br />
<br />
Isaac immediately slapped him,&quot;Don&#39;t hit on me, or anyone before getting to know them perv.&quot; Isaac said, and walked away<br />
<br />
&quot;Well that went well for you, and you do have the right idea about relationships here. Also for dragon-kin comments on female, and male body parts are genuine, and thoughtful. However, if one of those comments is brought up immediately then you have the right idea.&quot; Flora said,&quot;Let&#39;s get you a cave here.&quot;<br />
<br />
Flora lead Isaac to a set of caves, and the two that she lead Isaac to had an empty one next to it. &quot;Oh good nobody&#39;s taken it yet.&quot; Flora said,&quot;Caves here are first come, first claim, and cost nothing at all, this one has been empty for a bit so it&#39;s yours. Just follow me a few caves over, and we&#39;ll fill out a sheet.&quot;<br />
<br />
Flora lead Isaac to another cave where there was a dragon-kin couple, both blue inside with 4 kids. &quot;Hey Sapphire, hey Crash this is a friend of mine who&#39;s moving.&quot; Flora said, and nudged Isaac,&quot;Think of a name.&quot; Flora whispered to Isaac<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m Hail, it&#39;s just awkward for me because this is the first time I had a cave to myself.&quot; Isaac said <br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, consider it yours then, if anyone asks we&#39;ll just tell them it&#39;s taken.&quot; the female one said,&quot;By the way I&#39;m Sapphire, and this is my mate Crash, and these are our hatchlings all hatched from the same clutch, and all about 28 years old, once they pass 40 they&#39;re going to school.&quot;<br />
<br />
One of them was reaching for Isaac as if it was hungry,&quot;Ooh, silly little dragonet now are we, your mommy&#39;s right there. I&#39;m not ready for that yet.&quot; Isaac said pointing to Sapphire <br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry you aren&#39;t the only one that they do that to. They think anyone with breasts would feed them.&quot; Sapphire said,&quot;They&#39;re teething so that shouldn&#39;t be a problem for long, anyways the two males are Wave, and Thrash. Thrash being the lighter scaled one, and the two females are Aqua, and Rain, and Rain is the one who has green eyes.&quot; Crash said <br />
<br />
&quot;They&#39;re precious,&quot; Isaac commented<br />
<br />
&quot;Indeed, but shouldn&#39;t we tend to your new cave Hail?&quot; Flora said <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, yes, got a little distracted for a second, Goodbye everyone.&quot; Isaac said then left with Flora.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thankfully your cave already has a nest to it, and thanks to my spell you already know the basics to survival, and flight as an ice dragon-kin. So you can tend to your nest all you want, and light a torch too. Once you get something to put inside your cave everything will be fine. Crash, and Sapphire are friends of mine, and you should get to know them well soon. Thankfully dragon-kin talk is very similar to human talk except for flirting which you already know, and conversation topics towards your body. For that just keep in mind that rigid is bad on scales, smooth is good. Shiny, and sharp horns are good, dull ones aren&#39;t. Dull goes the same for claws, and spikes if any. Anyways that&#39;s all, just try to stick close to me in case something you don&#39;t know happens like....&quot; Flora said but was interrupted by a dragon-kin.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Flora,&quot; a male dragon-kin walked up, and for some reason Isaac saw him as attractive. &quot;Hey Volt, what are you doing here?&quot; Flora responded <br />
<br />
&quot;First, sorry for interrupting your chat, and second who&#39;s the new blood you brought in?&quot; Volt said looking at Isaac.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is Hail, she&#39;s a friend of mine. She&#39;s just shy about moving among other things which was why I was encouraging her until you showed up.&quot; Flora said <br />
<br />
Isaac wanted to back into her cave, but at the same time couldn&#39;t take her eyes off of Volt. Volt walked up to Isaac, and said,&quot;I&#39;m Volt, Flora&#39;s friend you seem extremely shy for a newcomer here.&quot;<br />
<br />
Isaac looked up,&quot;I...I&#39;m fine I&#39;ll get over it, I&#39;m Hail by the way as Flora said. I&#39;m not really a people person, or at least right now I&#39;m not. This is my first time having my own cave too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see, don&#39;t worry your shimmering scales will always be welcome here. Besides a friend of Flora&#39;s is a friend of mine. Anyways I hope to see you later bye.&quot; Volt said trying to hide a blush for you, and flew off.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s usually not like him I wonder what&#39;s up Hail.&quot; Flora said <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh god, he was flirting with me.&quot; Isaac said blushing, and walking into her cave <br />
<br />
&quot;How do you know that he could have just commented on you to help you break in the new life here.&quot; Flora said <br />
<br />
&quot;Well two things, one you said that it was unlike him just to fly off like that, and second he was hiding a blush when he did I saw it.&quot; Isaac said covering her mouth.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well that&#39;s an issue now, we can&#39;t tell him, at least not right now. Besides you don&#39;t know how to mingle that well, and you played the whole socially awkward role off pretty well because of your shyness. Believe me I know this is an adjustment for you, but after a lot of transformations where someone changes gender the majority actually thank me for doing that, and helping them find a mate oddly enough. Volt also isn&#39;t that bad it&#39;s just that we&#39;ve known for a lot longer time period, and know too much about each other to mate. Besides that I&#39;m a regular dragon, and he&#39;s dragon-kin. You just have to either break it up, or mention that secret of yours, and see if he&#39;s fine with it before getting serious.&quot; Flora said,&quot;Besides you really shouldn&#39;t hold onto your past life you&#39;re Hail now so you should stick to being Hail, because she is you now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess you have a few points there, and it&#39;s not like I can go back. So I guess I&#39;ll just have to live this life to the fullest then. One more question what&#39;s dragon-kin lifespan, because I was roughly the same age as Sapphire, and Crash&#39;s hatchlings before trandforming.&quot; Hail asked, and was committed to her role now.<br />
<br />
&quot;About 890,000 years is the average, you are 98,934, Volt is 99,115, so that&#39;s good considering that the gap between your ages is less than 1,000 years. My age is 99,456 so we&#39;re actually not far off either, that is if one of us was male, so allow me now to explain everything about being dragom-kin to you.</p>
