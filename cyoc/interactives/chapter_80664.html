<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Petula was first to change. Her ears became goat ears, she grew two horns that curled around them, freckles erupted on her face and arms, her <br />
nose flattened out and became a black goat nose, her upper lip split down the middle, her pupils became rectangle-shaped, her finger-nails <br />
became hard and black, her breasts got bigger, her legs became reverse-jointed, her feet became black cloven hooves,herhips got wider, her <br />
lower body became covered in thick goat hair that was the same color as the now waist-length curly hair on her head, and she even had a goat <br />
tail. Petula was now a satyress, and the oddest thing was that it seemed her clothes seemed to have changed to fit her new body - even having <br />
a hole in the back of her shorts for her tail! Instinctively, she reached into on of her pockets, and pulled out a set of panpipes.<br />
<br />
Before any of her friends could even say a word to her about her transformation, she started playing on her panpipes, and they all found <br />
themselves dancing with her.<br />
<br />
Kelsey was next to change. Her ears became fins, her nose flattened out, she grew sharp teeth (not too sharp - just enough to give her a cute <br />
fanged smile), gills appeared on the sides of her neck, she gained webbed hands with sharp finger-nails, her legs fused together into the lower <br />
half of a fish, and her whole body was covered in bright pink fish scales, but she still had her red hair. Kelsey was now a mermaid, and her <br />
clothes had changed to fit her new body. Instinctively, she reached into one of her pockets as she was dancing, and pulled out a seashell <br />
orcarina. <br />
<br />
She started playing it, adding to the music of Petula's panpipes.<br />
<br />
Maya stared changing too. Her ears became horse ears, her nose flattened out, her face pushed out into a short equine muzzle, her eyes <br />
became as big as a horse's with longer eyelashes, her finger-nails became hard and black, her breasts got bigger, her lower body became a <br />
horse's body, brown fur covered her entire body, she had a black horse tail which matched the hair on her head, and white zebra stripes <br />
appeared all over her body. Maya was now a zebra centauress, and her clothes had changed to fit her new body. Instinctively, she reached into <br />
one of her pockets as she was dancing, and pulled out a small tribal drum.<br />
<br />
She stared beating it, adding rhythm to the music.<br />
<br />
Dani's transformation was more frightening. She gained six new eyes, two extra arms, two extra legs, sharper teeth, a big spider abdomen, and <br />
thick black hair all over her body. Dani was now a jurogumo (a spider-woman from Japanese myth), which made sense, considering her <br />
Japanese heritage. Her clothes had changed to fit her new body. Instinctively, she reached into one of her pockets as she was dancing, and <br />
pulled out a small lyre.<br />
<br />
She started playing it, adding to the music.<br />
<br />
Jacquie's pupils became slit, she got sharp fangs, her nose flattened out, her face pushed out into a short snake snout, her tongue became <br />
forked, her legs fused together to become the lower half of a snake, and her whole body was covered in yellow snake scales, but she still had <br />
her blonde hair. Jacquie was now a naga, and her clothes had changed to fit her new body. Instinctively, she reached into one of her pockets as <br />
she was dancing, and pulled out some castanets.<br />
<br />
She played them, adding to the music.<br />
<br />
Kaitlyn's nose and mouth fused together to form a black beak, her arms became big bird wings, her legs became reverse-jointed bird legs with <br />
larger thighs and feet ending in sharp talons, her body was covered in purple feathers, her long hair became long purple feather-hair, and she <br />
had tail feathers. Kaitlyn was now a harpy, and her clothes had changed to fit her new body. Instinctively, she reached into one of her pockets <br />
as she was dancing, and pulled out a fiddle.<br />
<br />
Smiling with her beak, she played it with her legs, adding to the music.<br />
<br />
Stephanie's ears became cow ears, she grew a pair of cow horns, her nose flattened out, her face pushed out into a short bovine muzzle, her <br />
finger-nails became hard and black, she got bigger muscles, bigger breasts, wider hips, her legs became reverse-jointed, ending in cloven <br />
hooves, she grew a cow tail with a tuft of hair at the end the same color as on her head, and her body was covered in light red-orange fur, and <br />
red patches of fur appeared on it. Stephanie was now a minotauress, and her clothes had changed to fit her new body. Instinctively, she <br />
reached into one of her pockets as she was dancing, and pulled out a small saxaphone.<br />
<br />
She played it, completing the musical score.<br />
<br />
All of them played together in perfect harmony, and danced just as good.<br />
<br />
When the song ended, their coach Miss Clara applauded them.<br />
<br />
&quot;That was beautiful girls!&quot; She said smiling &quot;You played just as well as I knew you would!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thaaaanks,&quot; Petula bleated happily &quot;but how did you know we'd plaaaay so well?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Did you put these instruments in our pockets?&quot; Kelsey asked, not mad, but curious.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes I did,&quot; Ms Clara replied &quot;and it's a good thing you played them when you did, or your minds would've been lost to the transformations. <br />
Mentally, you're all still yourselves. As for why you changed, it's because all of you had dormant DNA that awakened tonight. It's no accident <br />
that the seven of you wound up on the same team, or even that all of you became friends. Even playing volleyball together was to teach you to <br />
work together as a team. Now you are ready to fulfill your destiny, and save the world from a great evil.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And what might that evil be?&quot; Maya asked, now a bit concerned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thousands of years ago,&quot; Ms Clara told them &quot;there was an evil being known as Medusa, who was defeated by an angel named Pit. After he <br />
defeated her and Hades, he fell into a deep sleep. Now after all this time, an ancient beast known as Typhon has woken up from his sleep <br />
under Mt. Etna in Greece. Underworld forces under his control have already begun stirring, and causing trouble. You must find where Pit sleeps, <br />
awaken him with your melody, and then help him defeat Typhon!&quot;<br />
<br />
Petula, being Greek herself, knew the legend of Typhon all too well - a giant monster with large bat wings, one horse head with magma flowing <br />
out of it's eyes, and 99 snake heads! She had hoped it was just a story.<br />
<br />
&quot;How do you know all this?&quot; Petula asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Because I have another form.&quot; Ms Clara said, and became a beautiful green-haired woman who looked like she was in her early 20's, and was <br />
in a white Greek dress with gold pieces. She held a staff, and there was a light symbol with wings floating behind her. &quot;This is the real me.&quot; she <br />
said &quot;I'm Palutena, and I've watched all of you, waiting for this night, because I knew that when all of you transformed, it meant that the time <br />
had come to awaken my servant Pit, and defeat Typhon. I understand if you're scared, but you won't have to fight him right away. Please, come <br />
with me.&quot;<br />
<br />
And in a flash of light, they all went to Skyworld to plan their next move.</p>
