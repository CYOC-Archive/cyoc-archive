<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Suki drunkenly licked Kathy&#39;s pussy for over an hour. You couldn&#39;t believe how long she was going for. Her tongue felt so good rubbing against your outer folds and at every surface she could reach inside of you. Even whe. She bit you on the clit, you didn&#39;t mind at all. Instead of pain, all you felt was an intense, blissful pleasure. You have had a few orgasms by now too, and you loved them. You lived for them now. Getting stuffed by your girlfriend&#39;s strap-on, finger, tongue, heel, or whatever she else could find had become your life&#39;s purpose. Pussy was a pussy afterall, you mentally joked to yourself, having adopted the rather obvious name Kathy gave you. If by being Pussy, and once Kathy has gotten use to you, then maybe you could be introduced to your girlfriend properly. <br />
<br />
You also thought that it would be best to start thinking about yourself as just an extention of Kathy. So her girlfriend was now also your girlfriend. Her dildo was your dildo. Her period was your period, and so on. Well, all of this hinders on whether Kathy allows you to exist from now on or not. Her girlfriend was just technically fucking you and all. So what would it be? Life as a 3 way couple, or 2 women and a sentient but forgotten pussy? <br />
<br />
Whatever it was, would have to wait for a while as both Kathy and Suki had passed out on the couch together. Suki&#39;s head was still facing you, and you could feel her breathing every time she exhaled as it teased you slightly. It was like you were being kept at only about 20% arousal. However it was enough for you to continue to lubricate yourself, eventually forming a wet spot on the couch as the several hours of constant dripping built up.<br />
<br />
It was Suki who woke up first. &quot;Hehe, good morning pussy&quot; she quietly said as she gently poked your clit. She obviously didn&#39;t know that she was speaking to a pussy with intelligence, but all the same, you moved to the best you could to say high back, but it likely just looked like you were just slightly quivering. &quot;Awww how cute, is this adorable little pussy hungry? Hope you like my fingers for breakfast.&quot; Suki, while being extremely quiet so not to wake up Kathy stuck one of her fingers slowly into you. She must be an expert with Kathy&#39;s pussy, because she did it in such a way that you hardly felt it. That was until she began to rub a very special spot. To you, it was like the flood gates had released as you squirted all over her face. Completely unfazed by being squirted on, Suki leaned in and kissed you right on your clit, though to her, she was simply kissing another part of Kathy. <br />
<br />
&quot;Mmmm morning you two...&quot; mumbled Kathy, having been awoken by Suki&#39;s playing. She was still pretty groggy though. Having slept on the couch, she didn&#39;t get the best of sleep. &quot;Morning, but its just me here. Go back to sleep until you can say morning to you too properly.&quot; <br />
&quot;What about Pussy, did she leave? I MEAN, uh, wait, whats that all over your face?&quot; &quot;Me and pussy spent the morning becomming reacquainted and she was very happy to see me it seems.&quot; <br />
&quot;Wait you guys know each other? What did you go to high school together or something?&quot; <br />
&quot;Hey, you doing ok Kathy? You say something happened and asked me to give you some space for a while, and I come back, we have amazing sex, and now you are acting weird again. This is the second time now that you have addresses another person besides me now. What are you hiding? I know you won&#39;t ever cheat on me, so who, or what are you hiding?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;My coworker became my pussy. But it was an accident I swear. Neither of us wanted it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Damn... Honestly, I wasn&#39;t expecting that one. Just give me a minute to process that.&quot;<br />
&quot;You can talk now pussy.&quot;<br />
&quot;What?&quot; <br />
&quot;I can control if it talks or not.&quot;<br />
&quot;I see... yep, I&#39;m gonna need to kill myself out of embarrassment from what I did this morning before you got up. Be right back.&quot; <br />
<br />
Suki left the room and the next second you heard her let out a muffled scream, after which she walked back into the room and sat down. &quot;Alright. Pussy, you don&#39;t speak a word about this morning. Kathy, never ask about it. Cool, now that that is over with, one of you better start explaining how my normal relationship turned into a threesome. Also, your name isn&#39;t really Pussy right? And I am not into guys just fyi, so if you are here to stay, then I am going to just ignore you if you are a guy. It may be cold, but I now share a girlfriend, so no one&#39;s getting what they want at the moment.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello Suki. I was not called Pussy before this, but I actually have decided to take that as my name from here on. Also I am a girl, and also a lesbian, I guess. But as long as I get filled, I guess I am not to picky about the details.&quot;<br />
&quot;Ok, Pussy. You can call me Suki, I am as you know, Kathy&#39;s girlfriend, so don&#39;t get any idea&#39;s. You are just the bodypart of my girlfriend to me.&quot;<br />
&quot;I am glad we think in a similar way. I agree, I am Kathy&#39;s pussy. I do what she asks of me. Although that also makes me, by extention, your girlfriend too. Sorry for all the trouble.&quot;</p>
