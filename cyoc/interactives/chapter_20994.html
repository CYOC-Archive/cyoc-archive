<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">she awoke the next morning in a strange bed unable to remember last nights events.  then after they finally came back to her she stared down at her body only to realize that the bite marks were gone and only a light covering of hair remained.<br />
she heard the door open and try to act as if she was still knocked-out but it didn't seem to fool her new guest.  &quot;I'm glad to see you survive the night, Deirdre&quot; an all too familiar voice said to her.<br />
&quot;who are you,&quot;  she asked knowing she had heard the voice before but was still too dizzy to make out his face.<br />
&quot;oh, come now deirdre, or should i call you Elizabeth,&quot;  he said beginning to sound insane as his golden colored right eye began to widen.  &quot;don't you recognize me?  after all you did try to kill me.&quot;<br />
Deidre flashback to a night she thought she had long since forgotten.  she remembered everything, the blood, the gun, and his body staring up at her dead and limp.<br />
&quot;that's impossible,&quot;  she cried even though she knew it was him.  &quot;i shot you through the heart, their's no way you could still be alive.&quot;<br />
&quot;i thought so too at first, thought i had gone to hell to relive that moment of torture for all eternity.  but obviously i survived.  you know its really funny too how that bullet was even silver and i still didn't die.  i guess something in just kept wanting to fight on and maybe even get revenge on you for what you did to me.&quot;<br />
&quot;you bastard,&quot;  she cried out unable to stop herself.<br />
&quot;now is that anyway to treat the one who saved your life,&quot; he said insanity once again taking grip on him, &quot;cause i could just as easily take it away.&quot;<br />
&quot;what do you mean?&quot; she said unable to understand what he was trying to tell her.<br />
&quot;when you were attacked last night, you would have died from excessive bleeding had i not allowed you to become like me.&quot;<br />
You mean a werewolf?&quot;  she asked him now curious to what was going on.<br />
&quot;No, not just a werewolf,&quot;  he replied, &quot;a pure-blooded werewolf.&quot;<br />
&quot;Pure-blooded?&quot;<br />
&quot;yes,&quot;  he answered, &quot;in other words you are not enslaved to the more savage part of your nature and you can also transform at will, to any variable.  let me demonstrate.&quot;<br />
he exhaled and his ears started to lengthen and come to a point, his canines grew longer, and a beard started form on his once clean-shaven face.  he held up his hand and she could see that the hair was starting to lengthen there as well and her nails sharpened into claws, though what really caught her eyes was the tail that was now quickly making its way out of his jeans.<br />
Elizabeth found herself more in awe than fear as she saw ears move to top of his head and the beginning of his wolf muzzle become obvious through his developing fur coat.  for some reason or another she was obsessed with the idea and couldn't wait for her first transformation.  now his feet started to lengthen as he allowed himself to fall on all fours as his hands began to do the same.  his muzzled finished growing and finally the bones in his back shifted and he was left in his full wolf form.<br />
she stood their in utter amazement as he began to transform back to his human state.<br />
&quot;now once you've gone through your first transformation i should be able to communicate with you telepathically but for now i need to talk to you the old-fashion way.&quot;<br />
&quot;so, what's it like becoming a werewolf,&quot; she asked regaining her composure, &quot;does it hurt or do you even notice that your changing?&quot;<br />
&quot;you do feel some pain but its more enjoyable than anything.&quot;<br />
&quot;so, umm, Robert,&quot;  she said mentioning his name for the first time, &quot;how did you become a werewolf to begin with?&quot;<br />
&quot;i was born this way, there was no curse or anything this is just what runs in my families blood-line. besides, if had been bitten or something like that i wouldn't be a pure-blood.&quot;<br />
&quot;wait if that's true how were you able to make me into a Pure-blood?&quot;<br />
&quot;its a ritual i found in an old book of legends.  basically what it is is that if you are bitten by any pure-blood while he is at least partially transformed than he can turned you into another pure-blood by allowing you to drink his blood.  yeah, i know its sounds a little like the vampire routine but it does work.&quot;<br />
&quot;so since you've been a werewolf since you were born then you have been transforming all of your life?&quot;  She says coming to grips with the reality of the situation.<br />
&quot;not really, you see the average pure-blood werewolf doesn't actually start to transform at all until his 12 birthday and even then he/she has to wait to their first full moons to transform, though many women have their first transformation earlier in life.<br />
really though being a werewolf is great.  the power you get from it is just incredible and really you can change at will unless the full moon is out.&quot;<br />
Elizabeth was about to ask another question when a strange tingling feeling spread throughout her spine.  &quot;well the moon's out,&quot;  Robert said, &quot;i guess we should get something to eat.&quot;<br />
&quot;the moon! Already!&quot; she cried in astonishment as she realized that that had been the source of the tingling sensation that had now engulfed her entire body.  as her transformation began she was pleased to find that the transformation was just as Robert had described it there was definitely pain as her bones shifted but there was also the pure enjoyment of feeling her senses sharpen, being able to identify a specific person from over a mile away just by their scent.  she caught the untamed scent of the werewolf standing next to her and though strong in odor she found it strangely attractive as she couldn't help but nuzzle up against his soft fur.  &quot;alright, let's go.&quot;  Robert said though his lips never moved an inch and they set off through the town.</p>
