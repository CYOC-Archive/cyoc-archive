<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jacob and Kate took several breaks from the computer, and several times agreed to sleep on it, before going back to the Chronivac app to tweak a setting or do less of one thing and more of another. Jacob was asleep when Kate tapped him on the shoulder. They read through the various screens, menus, and option selections together, trying to avoid the cascading changes as much as possible. The two profiles had undergone many revisions in the last few hours, but Kate thought this was for the best due to the reality alteration screen showing several hundred effects, but most were minor and none were showing the possibility of cascading like before.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oye..,&quot; Jacob uttered, taking his time reading through what were dozens of pages of reality alterations.<br />
<br />
Kate nodded yes as she read along with Jacob, &quot;You can&#39;t talk, eat or digest solid food, or age.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yea, but...,&quot; Jacob let the changes sink as he read, &quot;I mean...you found a way....but....wow.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jacob stopped reading and turned to Kate, &quot;Fuck it. Yea...let&#39;s do it. Kids do well, and perhaps some of that can be useful for other things.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I have this starting once we go to sleep, and taking six hours. We wake up this way,&quot; Kate noted.<br />
<br />
Jacob fixed his long gaze on Kate&#39;s profile rendering and asked, &quot;You sure you want that? We can start small.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Compared to yours dear, mine looks normal. Do you have some changes you would like to suggest?&quot; Kate replied, amused at Jacobs concern.<br />
<br />
&quot;No.&quot; Joe said softly.<br />
<br />
Joe clicked apply and Kate then took the mouse to click the confirmation. Several timers started, one being the reversion timer, that was blank. Some of the reality changes were already being made, such that all of the furniture was now latex, vinyl, and the computer keyboard and mouse were now protected from liquids. The hardwood floors of the house were now a textured rubber interlocking system. Kate extended an arm to Jacob, and let him into the bedroom, which had already changed. The bed was now some strange liquid, like a newtonian fluid, where you could sit down on top, but push you arm into it.<br />
<br />
&quot;A bed you never have to clean or have sheets to wash,&quot; Kate noted.<br />
<br />
The makings of some soft of sex machine with rubbery tentacles was off to one side, &quot;Yours or mine?&quot; asked Jacob pointing to the apparatus.<br />
<br />
&quot;Probably more you. Some strong hentai tentacle and egg fantasies on your part inspired that,&quot; Kate said after trying to remember for a few moments.<br />
<br />
Jacob sat on the bed, and tried to crawl into the center, but found rolling around was easier. Kate soon joined him. The changes to them both began as they lost consciousness. The changes to their kids reality would occur during their sleep as well, but without any awareness that anything was amiss.<br />
<br />
Kate was the first to awaken just after completing six hours of deep sleep.  She rolled to the edge of the bed to stand and walk over to a set of mirrors in a corner. Kate&#39;s young body and ample cock, balls, and breasts were already full and ready for Jacob to drain them. Kate returned to the side of the bed to watch hir wife awaken. Jacob&#39;s body began to move slowly as he awakened. Jacob&#39;s breathing structures, that resembled gills, were flaring and  breathing deeply and rapidly, then slowed down as Jacob&#39;s eyes formed and grew from the area near the gills. Jacob&#39;s body was one without definition, but with several tentacle stalks growing from a central core awkwardly moving, trying to get closer to Kate. Soon, Jacob was back to more of a liquid blob, like a shiny black puddle, and no more breathing structures. Kate smiled as she watched Jacob work through the aspects of command and control of his new body, a shape shifter. Jacob reached out with a shimmery thin tendril to touch Kate. Jacob used the opportunity to gain information about hir form, and soon, Jacob was forming into a black ooze version of Kate.<br />
<br />
&quot;Weird,&quot; was the word Kate heard in her head. &quot;I am here though. All of me. I see...but it&#39;s different. This will take some time to...,&quot; the words stopped as the tendril broke contact with Kate&#39;s skin. &quot;I heard you dear,&quot; Kate said softly. Kate left the room to go and make breakfast for herself since Jacob was going to be a a few minutes gathering himself. Kate was in the kitchen when a two legged humanoid with two partially formed arms walked in.<br />
<br />
&quot;You have no head dear,&quot; observed Kate.<br />
<br />
&quot;Working on it.&quot; were the words Kate heard in hir head.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, you figured out telepathy,&quot; Kate spoke aloud.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just one way at the moment, I cannot hear your thoughts. Only push,&quot; Kate heard in hir head from Jacob.<br />
<br />
&quot;I called in sick for you. So, you have the day. You should be pretty smart and quick now to figure things out,&quot; Kate said to the blob, that was turning a baby puke green color in places and dripping a clear mucus.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hungry, can I feed now?&quot; Jacob asked via the one way telepathy.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s about time, My milk is full and I got blue balls that need to be emptied,&quot; replied Kate with some frustration.<br />
<br />
Kate went back to the bed to lay down and a much slower Jacob followed. Jacob&#39;s body went back into an ooze puddle before moving over and covering Kate&#39;s breasts and cock. Jacob eased his tendrils into hir breasts and cock like catheters to then milk directly from the source. Several tendrils that made it to Kate&#39;s prostate began to massage and working with something gripping the tip of her cock, began what Kate could only approximate as an attempt to get hir male orgasm going. Jacob was a quick learner as he tried to be very careful with the parts of himself that were now deep inside Kate. The white swirls showing up in Jacob&#39;s body along with the reduced pressure in hir breasts was starting to take some of the edge off Kate&#39;s discomfort. Soon, hir prostate and testicles were being drained of their nourishing products as Jacob got better at multitasking. Soon, Kate&#39;s supply of sperm, fluid, and milk were exhausted for the time being, and Jacob withdrew  himself from Kate&#39;s body.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoa....all that and no happy ending dear?&quot; Kate said mockingly then said, &quot;Nope...that&#39;s alright. There is a learning curve here, especially for you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yea...sorry dear. I&#39;m too fucking slow right now. I need a little bit of time here to get this sorted out,&quot; were the words Kate heard in hir head. Kate sprawled out on the bed, letting hir body recharge slightly from the rather intense milking session that felt good, but without the orgasmic payoff.<br />
<br />
Jacob spent the next hour or so working on body control, definition, movement, and just how to process sight, smell, sound, taste, and touch. There seemed to be some other things he could sense too, but so far he was trying not to get overloaded. Kate was still asleep when Jacob stood up in the corner of mirrors nearly two hours later. Things were starting to fall into place, suddenly he not only had control, but a real mastery of some basic things, like walking on two legs, and forming basic shapes. The form in the mirror looked like a very unusual stick figure with basketball sized spheres for breasts, and for the next hour Jacob spent pushing his ability farther in more complex shapes and movements. Kate was awake, and watching Jacob make some good progress on controlling his new form.</p>
