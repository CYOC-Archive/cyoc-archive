<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff returns an hour or so later, exhausted from doing yard work, “Lucy,” he says as he walks into his room, “can you please let me back on my Laptop?”<br />
<br />
“But I want to play a little longer,” the girl says without turning around.<br />
<br />
Jeff grumbles, “look, I am not in the mood for arguing,” he says, “besides, mom told me, to tell you, that you still need to tidy your room, so: move your butt out of MY seat, twerp!”<br />
<br />
“Tell you what,” Lucy says, still not turning around to look at Jeff, “why don’t YOU tidy my room so I can continue with my game?”<br />
<br />
Before Jeff is able to respond he feels his body suddenly move on its own, the strange urge to HAVE to tidy Lucy’s room comes over him, when Jeff enters Lucy’s room he wastes no time and starts clearing the girl’s toys and clothes from the floor.<br />
<br />
Lucy hears rummaging sounds coming from her room, this causes her to look up from her game, “what the hell,” the girl says, pausing the game and hurries to her room. The girl gasps when she sees her brother hastily tidying HER room, “Jeff, what the hell?”<br />
<br />
“I… I have no idea,” he says, not stopping what he is doing, “d-did you mess with my computer?”<br />
<br />
“Uh… I kinda,” the girl starts, but watching her brother tidying her room makes her nervous, “will you just… stop tidying my room.”<br />
<br />
And just like that, Jeff stops what he is doing, letting the pieces of clothing he was carrying fall to the ground, “what the… hell,” he looks at Lucy, frowning, “what did you do, twerp?”<br />
<br />
“Nothing,” Lucy said, “I just… before playing my farm simulation, I noticed that you had a game open. There was a empty text field on the screen, above it a sentence said “please input alteration”, so as a joke I typed “Lucy rules” and saved it. That’s all, I swear!”<br />
<br />
First Jeff is about to yell at his sister, but knows that would not help, so instead he takes a deep breath, “okay, listen Lucy,” he says, trying to sound calm, “it is not a game… it’s… it’s actually a reality editor. When you typed “Lucy rules” into the program, caused you to get some kind of power over me, probably over everyone and everything on this planet.”<br />
<br />
“What now,” Lucy asks, sounding confused.<br />
<br />
Jeff sighs, “when you told me to tidy your room,” Jeff tries to explain, “caused me to suddenly feel the urge of having to do what you say.”<br />
<br />
“You mean, like some kind of Robot or servant?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah… kinda,” Jeff says.<br />
<br />
Lucy narrows her eyes, thinking that Jeff is once again just pulling a sick prank on her, “uh… bark like a dog,” the girl says.<br />
<br />
Instantly after Lucy said that, Jeff suddenly let out a very convincing bark, both of them look at each other in shock, “so… um… yeah,” Jeff stutters, “l-let me… let me just… delete that input,” he says and heads to his room.<br />
<br />
Lucy is still in shock, but suddenly she blinks and hurries after Jeff, who has reached the middle of his room, placing his right foot on the floor when Lucy suddenly shouts, “Freeze!”<br />
<br />
To his horror Jeff finds himself glued to the spot, the teen tries to move but is unable to, “Lucy! Cut the crap,” he says, “I got to fix this!”<br />
<br />
Lucy closes the door to Jeff’s room and locks it, before she turns to look at her big brother, “turn and face me,” she orders, Jeff obeys, fear in his eyes, “stick out your tongue… back in… wave…,” Lucies frown and confusion quickly turns into a grin.<br />
<br />
“Lucy,” Jeff says, “stop messing around already!”<br />
<br />
“I still am not really convinced,” the little girl says, “but I know one thing that WILL convince me! Take off your shirt,” she says. Lucy knew that, under normal circumstances, Jeff would never take his shirt off. To the girl’s surprise, however, instantly after she told him to remove his shirt, Jeff does just that, “no way,” the girl exclaims, “you actually have to do anything I say? This… is… AWESOME!”<br />
<br />
Jeff frowns, not liking where this is going, “no… no it’s NOT,” he says, “let me go so that I can fix this crap! I mean… .”<br />
<br />
“Stop talking,” Lucy says, cutting her brother of who falls silent immediately, “and don’t speak unless I say so!”<br />
<br />
Jeff opens his mouth but no sound escapes him, his eyes widen in fear, Lucy just grins.<br />
<br />
“This is amazing,” the 10 year-old girl says, “finally I can get my revenge for all those mean pranks you pulled on me. Now, I am the ONE who bosses YOU around! I can do anything I want with you!”<br />
<br />
Jeff’s eyes, the only part of him which he is able to move, widen even more.<br />
<br />
Lucy grins, “but, before I think of something what to do with you,” she says, “tell me, did you use the program before I did? Answer truthfully!”<br />
<br />
Unable to stop himself, Jeff tells Lucy what he has done.<br />
<br />
Lucy raises an eyebrow, “you wanted to make your cock bigger, but instead you now have a baby’s dick?”<br />
<br />
“Yes,” Jeff says, blushing hard, he feels so embarrassed.<br />
<br />
“And you are unable to change it back until tomorrow?”<br />
<br />
“Yes!”<br />
<br />
Lucy grins, “THAT I have to see,” she says, “take of your jeans and underwear!”<br />
<br />
Jeff instantly feels his hands move to undo his pant, “L-Lucy… pl-please… you got to stop,” he pleads, “I… I’m s-sorry for all the pranks I did… If… if you let me fix it, I pr-promise we… .”<br />
<br />
“Stop talking,” Lucy says, and once again Jeff feels his ability to speak taken from him in an instant!<br />
<br />
Jeff tries with all his might to stop himself, but soon his Jeans and underwear fall to the ground, revealing his tiny baby cock to his 10 year-old sister, who bursts out laughing at the sight, Jeff’s face is so red, it would make any tomato jealous of him.<br />
<br />
“I can’t believe it,” Lucy finally says, after getting herself under control, the girl steps closer to her brother and leans down to get a better look, “you really have a baby dick,” she says, giving Jeff’s dick a poke.<br />
<br />
Jeff feels so humiliated.<br />
<br />
Lucy looks up at her brother, “you look so humiliated and embarrassed,” she says, “let’s make it even more humiliating for you. Pull your boxers back on, but step out of your Jeans!”<br />
<br />
Jeff unwillingly does as told.<br />
<br />
Once he has his boxers back on and stepped out his Jeans, is when Lucy starts talking again, “let’s see if this works,” she says, “your white boxers will become a diaper for you!”<br />
<br />
Jeff is horrified, but he relaxes when nothing seems to happen, but his relief is short lived when he feels his boxers start to feel weird. Seeing the grin on Lucy’s face is enough to actually make him cry.<br />
<br />
Lucy watches in amazement as Jeff’s boxers puff out, taking the shape and form of a big diaper, Lucy starts laughing again, “you look so… silly,” she squeals.<br />
<br />
‘Can it get any worse,’ Jeff asks himself miserably.<br />
<br />
As if reading his thoughts Lucy smirks, “before we continue, I better make sure that the “baby” doesn’t mess with the program,” she says. Lucy walks behind Jeff to the Laptop, Jeff hears his sister typing something, when Lucy reappears in front of him, the girl grins, “I protected the program with a password,” she explains, “you will be unable to access it, unless I tell you what the password is, which I won’t!”<br />
<br />
Jeff is horrified, what is his sister planning to do to him? Transform him into a baby?<br />
<br />
“Okay Jeff,” Lucy says, “you can move again, but you will keep the diaper on. You won’t put your Jeans back on, for the rest of the day, you will be only walking around in your t-shirt and diaper! Oh, and you are unable to take the diaper off!”<br />
<br />
Jeff instantly finds himself getting control over his body back, he instantly tries to remove the diaper, but as he tries to tear it off of him, he suddenly feels weak, unable to find the strength to remove the diaper from his body. The teen soon gives up and stares at his sister, opening his mouth to plead with her, but no sound comes out.<br />
<br />
“Oh, right,” Lucy says, “you may speak!”<br />
<br />
“Lu-Lucy,” Jeff says, “pl-please… stop this,” he begs.<br />
<br />
“Nope,” the girl says, “for one this is to much fun, and for two, I want you to suffer! You humiliated me for so long and you are always mean to me! Now, it is my turn, let’s see how YOU like it!”<br />
<br />
“Wh-what are you going to do to me,” Jeff asks.<br />
<br />
Lucy grins, “I’ll think of something,” she says, “for now, you just be a good boy and keep that out you are wearing on. Don’t worry about mom… hehe… she’ll think it’s normal for you to wear diapers!”<br />
<br />
“Bu-but… how am I supposed to use the bathroom, if I can’t remove the diaper?”<br />
<br />
Lucy grins, “hehe… just use your diaper,” she says, “that is what it’s there for!”<br />
<br />
Jeff is shocked, he watches his sister leave his room, laughing to herself, Jeff lowers his head, he sits down on his bed. When he feels the diaper… his diaper squish under him takes him over the edge, the 16 year-old covers his face with his hands and starts to sob.</p>
