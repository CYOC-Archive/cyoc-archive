<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After bidding the Wyes and Waynes goodbye and receiving their thanks several times in a <br />
row Madam Serenity bid fair well to the Glen's residence.  Since they had been transformed <br />
only the day before, few had if any had 'realized' their fellow Pride members were missing.  <br />
<br />
'I hate to turn down a free home cooked meal like that, but if this misadventure had taught <br />
me anything, is that Kurse's 'mutate the world' scheme failed to scare the stupid out of <br />
people and it's only a matter of time before someone else uses the game. Hmmm... Only <br />
one of them before technically had the game... from whatever the source... whoever gave it <br />
to that punk. But now logically all four of them would have turns at the game right? ... At <br />
least they're not likely to abuse it given the deposition all the lion people seemed <br />
programmed with. <br />
<br />
Dangit I should have asked more questions about who did the game to them in this <br />
timeline... but wouldn't that person just be a scapegoat that reality had chosen? ... I just <br />
hope that the cure works, or besides some screwing with the DNA of the planet's <br />
population, this entire disaster has been effectively pointless. And I'm sick of pointless <br />
things.' <br />

Looking through an imported book that the Big Bad Wolf Pack had bought over the <br />
internet, Amy seemed completely engrossed in it. <br />
<br />
Zelipe finally looked up from Harry Potter and asked, &quot;What are you looking for Amy?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Just checking a translation on the names of the Lupmans aspects of the two gods that the <br />
pack weren't able yet to commission. It would be best to know their names ahead of time.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Isn't it funny how the Monkey Prince looks kinda like Alpha Jensen?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm pretty sure that's supposed to be Alpha Jensen's father. The statues were <br />
commissioned when Alpha Jensen was still a pup, so it wouldn't make much sense to be <br />
him.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess...&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Here we go... interesting. So that's who it is.&quot;  Amy observed causing a tiny ripple in fate. <br />

1689 August 10th 10:17 AM <br />
<br />
The fairies from their observation spot saw the four smoking holes in the ring of American <br />
Boxing Trees that surrounded Glendale like a noose. The American Boxing Trees were, of <br />
course, unable to uproot themselves, and thus couldn't close the gap, nor could they <br />
pursue the ones who had slain their fellows. <br />
<br />
Maria and her group, for their part, knew they could not waste the bombs, the effort, or <br />
the precious time to destroy every single boxing tree around Glendale. After all, they were <br />
not the hunters targets, the witches were. <br />
<br />
As Monica, Rosa, Mal'Akh soon after, and the Silver Twin, did their best to herd the <br />
entranced and mind fog addled towns folk into their homes, and out of the way to leave <br />
the hunters with one less danger to dance and one less ring of innocents to kill through to <br />
get to the true enemy, the five hunters came from their four different directions towards <br />
the witches house... it was hardly at the center of town, having been selected for it's out of <br />
the way location, so the hunters had different lengths of travel to get to it.  <br />
<br />
&quot;At least all the colors are nice.&quot; Kathrine said looking at the rainbow colored grass, <br />
flowers, and various plants and domesticated animals. The houses were rather bright too... <br />
in short they were the kinds of colors that Felman as a cultural rule loved.  &quot;There no way <br />
I'm so much as touching one of those giants pears though... they'd turn me into a frog or <br />
something I'm sure of it... the flowers sure have nice scents though... &quot; It felt very weird to <br />
hear so much about this town for months and finally setting foot in it only to find it devoid <br />
of people with only some odd animals looking at her funny. <br />
<br />
&quot;Are these animals the people?&quot; Kathrine asked with dread but she saw children looking <br />
fearfully through a window. Kathrine by reaction alone waved at them, they threw a rock at <br />
her that her experience with the spear deflected with ease.<br />
<br />
 She saw scared leomans in the windows looking at her who looked colored like felmans, <br />
many resembling the 'greatest of the great' cast of having fur of every color, Kathrine felt <br />
humbled by being near them even if she knew no leoman cub could ever logically have fur <br />
that color. Right? <br />
<br />
'These flower sure give off a strong scent.' Kathrine thought feeling slightly dizzy from the <br />
summer heat. <br />
<br />
North, Draco burned everything in his path. Taking this as the logical measure to insure <br />
that the witches thought an army was coming their way and making as much noise as <br />
possible to add to this. Brightly colored grass and plants burned not spreading as fast or <br />
far as the hungry dragon fire should have.  He left a trail of grayish rainbow colored ashes <br />
in his way.<br />
<br />
Dragons could not breath fire infinitely, hardly, but they were not limited to breathing fire <br />
once a day like some misconceptions believed. All the same, the fire burned the flowers <br />
around him and the pollen the same any anything else. <br />
<br />
The fighting trees no longer an issue, Linus march like a solider at war towards were <br />
Mal'Akh's information instruct him the witches grounds were. He of course avoided the <br />
rings of mushroom. He knew that 'fairy rings' were supposed to be just fairy tales... but <br />
given what he had heard of the witches, he couldn't put it past them to make these fairy <br />
rings very much effective. His eyes on the rings he ignored the rainbow colored flowers at <br />
his feet and their scent slowly getting stronger and stronger. <br />
<br />
++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;I've seen the wizard of Oz.&quot; Betty crossed her arms. <br />
<br />
Lawrence nodded the same having seen it with his parents. <br />
<br />
&quot;So have we.&quot; Casandra and Lilly spoke. <br />
<br />
&quot;I know I watched it with you.&quot; Maddex's heads said. <br />
<br />
&quot;So have we!&quot; Abbey spoke up for the blond pups. <br />
<br />
&quot;I didn't let my Marie see it.&quot; Eliza said, &quot;I felt it was too scary for her.&quot;<br />
<br />
Marie-Eliza grimly nodded, &quot;You conjecture is correct, the next line of defense wasn't the <br />
ring of thorns, or the entranced town folk. The flowers scent was a protective barrier all it's <br />
own. The irony is that the chaos-coven never intended them as such, it was a natural side <br />
effect of the nature of their creation and growth.  Otherwise the coven would have <br />
marched out and killed the hunters when the hunters were left astray by the flowers. <br />
Everyone in Glendale by this point was either too entranced by the witches or out of the <br />
flowers' 'target age range' to be effected by it... &quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But Running Bear's pendants should have protected them.&quot; Maddex's right head said, his <br />
left head looking confused and upset. <br />
<br />
&quot;The flowers were CREATED by magic, and were maintained purely by magic, and couldn't <br />
survive without mana running through their stems and roots, but the flowers in of <br />
themselves, in particular their pollen, were closer to the middle-ground of alchemy than <br />
pure magic.&quot;<br />
<br />
++++++++<br />
<br />
Gargoyle and Inquisitor came through Glendale from the south, going through the wild <br />
flowers and grass the covered nearly everything. They didn't even look at the fruits and <br />
didn't come within five feet of the fairy rings. <br />
<br />
After crossing into the Glendale town limits, Vatican noticed Marie Cruz's steps became <br />
smaller and slower. For a fearful second he wondered if she was getting younger (as sweet <br />
as that fantasy was, Vatican had a duty to serve). But no, Marie looked much the same, <br />
except her long cloak and jacket were marked with the pollen from the flowers. <br />
<br />
Vatican of course didn't smell a thing, he was living stone, he had no sense of smell or <br />
taste, these alien sensations were barely comprehensible to him, only vaguely comparable <br />
by thinking about how different rocks and stones were composed differently.  His nostrils <br />
themselves were purely for show and went nowhere. <br />
<br />
He noticed Marie's eye was dilated to where it looked like a doll's. Her mouth hung open <br />
slightly. <br />
<br />
&quot;Mutt? Papa? ... &quot; Marie whispered at thin air. <br />
<br />
&quot;Marie?&quot;  She didn't seem to hear him. <br />
<br />
Marie stopped dead in her tracks, and feel to her knees. <br />
<br />
&quot;You're alive! I'm so happy! Is this paradise?  I have so much to tell you!&quot; <br />
<br />
The gargoyle looked as his charge began to ramble on happily speaking to phantoms. <br />
<br />
&quot;MARIE!&quot; Vatican snarled and shook her. She blinked her eye, but she remained somewhere <br />
else. &quot;Was that thunder papa?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;MARIE! Listen to my voice! IT'S ME! VATICAN!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;All the children were found alive? That's wonderful papa! And Abraham repents <br />
everything he's done, and Zoey has agreed to be friends with Kathrine? That's good to <br />
hear. Gita! Goldwyn! Griselle! It's great to see you! Let's go play!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;STOP IT INQUISITOR!&quot; The stone beast roared louder in her face causing wind as the back <br />
of his dead end throat vibrated like a speaker box. <br />
<br />
Marie shuddered again. &quot;Papa, is something wrong?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;YOUR FATHER IS DEAD MARIE! SO IS MUTT! ZOEY IS BACK AT THE VATICAN! THE TURK IS <br />
DEAD! THOSE CHILDREN ARE NEVER EVER COMING BACK! MARIE LISTEN TO ME!&quot; <br />
<br />
Marie, like a puppet, slowly and awkwardly covered her eye, and with her other hand slowly <br />
reached out and touched Vatican's face. <br />
<br />
&quot;The... THE MASKED CROW AGAIN! Why are you here? Are you.. why are... that can't be <br />
but... but it's... I'm..  please... can I see you without your mask just once?... My Lord <br />
You're-!!!.... Vatican?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Marie?&quot; He hoped. <br />
<br />
&quot;I don't think what I'm seeing with one of my eyes is real... I have to trust my other eye <br />
until I feel I can trust the other one... please... can you lead me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Marie... I will... &quot; He also reached inside the cloak, tore off a piece of Marie's clothing <br />
and covered her nose and face and slowly led her out of the field of dangerous flowers.  His <br />
alarm rising as he thought of the others. <br />
<br />
+++++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;The greatest of the great colors really fit you Kathrine.&quot; Lucky Star said smiling at her <br />
sister. <br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you Mary.&quot; Kathrine smiled and nodded. <br />
<br />
Rachel put an arm around Kathrine's shoulder, &quot;So Marie, could you tell me again how you <br />
got the Roman Lupman's to wear clothes, Became the First Female Pope for Ten Days, and <br />
converted the turks to christianity.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh if you must hear it again.&quot; The rainbow colored Kathrine smiled and leaned back in the <br />
solid gold chair. <br />
<br />
Zoey dressed as a maid asked eagerly, &quot;Can I read you one of my poems? It dedicated to <br />
you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Another one? I guess that's alright.&quot; <br />
<br />
Lucky Star smiled, &quot;We also have some suitors lined up for you this afternoon, we told you <br />
the Pope would make an exception for you...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes you did.&quot; Kathrine smiled and nodded. <br />
<br />
the baby kitten Josephine reached for her. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, you want auntie to hold you?&quot; Lucky said handing Josephine to Kathrine. <br />
<br />
Kathrine looked at her cute face when the infant suddenly grew giant fangs and chomped <br />
Kathrine in the leg. <br />
<br />
&quot;YEAOH!!!!!&quot;  Kathrine screamed as she sat up in the field of flowers finding a leoman cub <br />
she didn't recognize with her fangs in Kathrine's bleeding flesh. <br />
<br />
&quot;Who are you?&quot; Kathrine asked first. <br />
<br />
&quot;My name is Rosa Glen of the Glendale Pride. Who are you? What Pride do you belong to? I <br />
found you laying on your side with eye centers opened wide enough I could have stuck my <br />
paw through drooling down one side of your face.&quot; <br />
<br />
Kathrine felt her face and indeed felt drool from her own mouth.  'I hope Marie never finds <br />
out about this.' Kathrine thought. <br />
<br />
On the east side of Glendale meanwhile Linus stood waving like a tree in the field of <br />
flowers his eyes wide and his mouth open slightly.</p>
