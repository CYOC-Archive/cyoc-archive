<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">[1 month later]<br />
<br />
You shut your eyes and whinnied in bliss as a familiar rush of sensations washed over you. The anticipation was killing you as you felt the massive penis inside you beginning to quiver. You neighed impatiently as the tip gradually flared open deep inside your needy equine sex. Then, the wonderful moment finally arrived as you felt your mate’s cock jerk violently inside you, before a long blast of semen suddenly splattered into the depths of your stuffed vaginal passage.  <br />
<br />
You whinnied and shuddered in relief as more of the sticky fluid flooded into your fertile body. Soon, the stallion’s excess seed was left spilling down your legs as it mixed with some of your own juices that had escaped from your dripping mare pussy.<br />
<br />
Though you were now quite familiar with equine mating, the pleasurable sensations that always resulted were ones you were sure you would never tire of. Whether it was the warm feeling of being flooded with your mate’s cum, or the joy of having your pussy stretched and penetrated, all of it was indescribably amazing now that you had fully embraced your new life as Princess the broodmare.<br />
<br />
You thought about this and other things until your mate finally seemed satisfied. You then started to feel empty inside as the heavenly cock started to withdraw. The organ slipped out of you wetly, after which a fresh torrent of various sexual juices flooded out to add to the mess between your legs.<br />
<br />
With the mating complete, you swished your tail happily over your cum-filled vagina as you looked back at your lover affectionately. There, Hector met your gaze with an amused smile as he studied the wetness oozing out of you with interest. <br />
<br />
The big horse appeared to be satisfied with his efforts as he moved beside you and started to gently nibble and rub your slender neck. You were more than happy to allow this behaviour as you let Hector show just how much he cared for you. And as you basked in the afterglow of the amazing sex, your thoughts started to drift as you reflected on all you had been through since arriving at Vicky’s farm.<br />
<br />
After a month of living with Vicky’s family, you had now happily settled into a steady routine. In order to keep you fit and healthy, Vicky made sure to ride and exercise you frequently. In fact, Vicky seemed to ride you more than any of the other horses as she treated you as if you had been her trusted mount for many years. <br />
<br />
Of course, being with Vicky so much also meant that she liked to incorporate you into some of the sadistic games that she played with the other animals. By this stage, you were now intimately familiar with the majority of the farm’s animals; especially since you had watched most of them mating right in front of you.<br />
<br />
However, Vicky occasionally liked to get you much more involved in the action. This meant that you were sometimes used to ‘prepare’ some of the larger animals like the cows, goats and sheep, which usually involved licking their genitals until they were suitably aroused. On the other hand though, when one of the smaller animals from the sinister warehouse was selected, it was you that would usually be the one to have your body tended to by them.<br />
<br />
Aside from this, when you weren’t spending time with Vicky you would be left in the charge of her two siblings. Given that you now lived in the mare field, it was usually Carla that kept an eye on you and the other mares as they stood grazing in the field. Having said this though, Carla did have a habit of getting distracted as she usually couldn’t resist getting frisky with some of her fellow females. You were no exception to this rule, in fact you had built up a close bond with Carla after spending a lot of time with her. Now you were intimately familiar with every inch of her sexy feminine body, after having tasted it on numerous occasions.<br />
<br />
However, as fun as Carla was to be around, you always got more of a kick whenever you caught sight of her handsome stud of a brother. Indeed, Hector represented everything your mare body could possibly want. He was strong, virile and fit; and thus represented the perfect candidate to be the father to your offspring. Of course, the other studs you had coupled with had been nice, but none of them could quite compare to Hector’s perfect figure.<br />
<br />
And so, as you stood nuzzling your favourite stallion you felt a certain tranquility settling over you. Being under this horse’s protection now felt perfectly natural as you returned his affection with a few playful nibbles to his ear. Just being near Hector made you feel warm inside as you stood beside him, safe in the knowledge that you were now his forever more.<br />
<br />
With this in mind, as you looked around at the other horses grazing in the field you now felt completely at home. After all, you were with your own kind now. This was where Princess truly belonged.</p>
