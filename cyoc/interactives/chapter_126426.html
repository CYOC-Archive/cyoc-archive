<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As I looked around the room, I found it a bit surprising who the women were, exactly. Indeed, though I hadn&#39;t specifically said it, I was attracted to all of them. In fact, I knew all of them in the previous world that had been, before all of my wishes. Now, they were my pack. I wondered if it was simply that the ring couldn&#39;t create people from thin air, or if it simply pulled them from my memories.<br />
<br />
There was Meaghan, a  curvy, curly-haired brunette with nice tits and pierced nipples. In the old world, she was the only friend who knew how “into” werewolves I was, and shared my fetish. My memories told me that she&#39;d actually been the first one I turned, after I revealed what I was, and had been instrumental in bringing the others into the pack. While she was a little..chubbier than my ideal, our tight friendship and her enthusiasm for lycanthropy had made it an easy choice, and one that had been well-rewarded for the both of us.<br />
<br />
Then there was Kim, a willowy, leggy girl, with mousy blonde hair and stunningly large blue eyes. We&#39;d gone to high school with, and I&#39;d had a crush on her for years. Amusingly enough, so had Meg, though neither one of us had managed to get more than  a bit of flirting from Kim, who was well aware of her sexual appeal. She had a strong voyeuristic streak, as well as a bit of an exhibitionism fetish too. We&#39;d gone to her place on the night of a full moon, and when the moon rose, and our transformations began, Meaghan and I ended up fucking while we changed, not even thinking about Kim being present; we had planned to bite her. Instead, however, Kim had become fascinated and overwhelmingly aroused with our transformation, and willingly allowed us to ravish her, turning her in the process.<br />
<br />
Tabitha had been next; she was a petite and nearly flat-chested girl, no more than 100 pounds soaking wet, with A-cup breasts and thin brown hair. She was another friend from my school days, one who was always a bit flighty, and truthfully a bit of a flake. She was very openly bisexual, but her preference seemed to flop from day to day. One day, she was into men, the next into women. She had multiple short-term relationships, alternating between men and women. After a break up with a woman, she&#39;d say she needed a man, because she was tired of the drama. After a break up with a man, she&#39;d say she wanted a woman, because men were unable to show emotion well. She also had a tendency to become very affectionate when she&#39;d drink, and so after a night of drinking at Kim&#39;s, we bedded her and turned her.<br />
<br />
Then had come Rebecca.  Rebecca was a few years older than myself, around 27. She had curly red hair and piercing green eyes. I&#39;d met her through mutual friends, and found her intriguing, even though she was wildly opinionated, particularly on the subject of polyamory. She also practiced witchcraft, and while I always assumed it was bullshit, it turned out I was wrong. When we ran into her while we were out (by this point, the four of us pretty much traveled as a pack), she immediately felt something had changed about us. We went back to her house, and after a drink or two, we&#39;d told her our secret. Seeing her opportunity for more power, as well as a tightly knit multi-partner relationship, she begged us to bring her in, and in short order, a werewolf orgy brought her into the pack.<br />
<br />
Kristy was the most recent, and had been an accident, though a happy one. She had long, coppery hair, and massive breasts, DD sized. She&#39;d come to the mansion two months previously, stopping by to drop off a book she&#39;d borrowed from Rebecca. It was a full moon, however, and we&#39;d already transformed. We were outside the house when she pulled up, fully transformed and under total sway of our animal natures.  She was tackled down, and in seconds, she had her clothing shredded. Meaghan&#39;s muzzle already had parted her nether lips while Tabitha rode her face. Kim and Rebecca had each began to suck and lick Kristy&#39;s impressive breasts,  and then each bit her.<br />
<br />
Normally, the transformation wouldn&#39;t happen on the night of the infection, and would instead occur the next day. However, Kristy was flooded with so many infection vectors at once that her transformation occurred less than an hour later, with me fucking her while she was on all fours. <br />
<br />
There was a bit of guilt, particularly since she wasn&#39;t remotely bisexual before her turning, and we hadn&#39;t even given her the illusion of a choice. The overwhelming event had definitely changed her personality, and made her wolf side considerably stronger than her human side. The moment she saw another werewolf start to change, she&#39;d lose control. The moment she got horny, she&#39;d start to lose control. While she still wasn&#39;t bisexual, or at least not as vigorously as the rest, she would still accept oral from any of the others, and occasionally would kiss or stroke them while she was in the throes of the change.<br />
<br />
I was seated next to Tabitha, who was eyeing me hungrily. Her mouth was upturned slightly in a suggestive smirk. My mere presence near them was enough to start a wave of pheromones to start flowing from them, as they started to grow more aroused, and my cock had started to harden in equal anticipation. My mind informed me that now, as alpha of a pack, I had to be careful not to show too much favoritism to any one of the girls sexually, unless I wanted to name one as my mate. The past several months had seen me rotating through them, trying to keep the number of encounters as close to even as possible between us, to avoid any inter-pack dominance struggles or jealousy. So, as it stood, I could have my pick, or picks this time.<br />
<br />
“I was thinking about the impending full moon,” I said, smiling as I reached out to stroke her neck, even as I looked at the other four. “I think it&#39;s time we made the good people of the city more like us.”<br />
<br />
All of the girls smiled, and their eyes reflected the primal desires of the wolf. It was in this moment that it was clear to me: I no longer thought of myself as human, nor did I care about the well-being of any human on the planet. We were destined to rule, as the new evolution and dominant species on the earth. What we offered was a gift to those we didn&#39;t deem as prey, and we would not be denied our place in this new world.<br />
<br />
“Tomorrow night,” I told them, “We&#39;re going to pair off, and hit three locations in town, then meet back here, after having turned anyone who we find suitable, male or female.”<br />
<br />
The mere mention of turning people had a profound effect on the girls. The smell of she-wolf musk filled the room, each of their scents mingling together, pushing our wolf sides more closer to the surface, mine included. Rebecca and Meaghan had slipped their robes off and were already beginning to stroke each other lightly.<br />
<br />
Kim scooted closer on the couch to Kristy, who whimpered slightly as she watched Rebecca and Meaghan&#39;s naked bodies with a distracted, forbidden curiosity. Tabitha slipped her robe off as well, smiling at me with desire as her hand slid to my crotch.<br />
<br />
“Meaghan and Rebecca-you two will go to the mall. Find a bathroom, or..*ahem* a changing room, pardon the pun, at one of the corner stores, and then rampage through. Aside from the main entrances, there aren&#39;t any easy escape routes.”<br />
<br />
I peeled my shirt off as Rebecca slid off the couch and positioned her head between Meaghan&#39;s thighs, and a line of red fur was already running up her spine. Kristy moaned, watching them with widening eyes that were yellowing, letting out a helpless sound of desire.<br />
<br />
Kim&#39;s robe fell away as she pressed against Kristy who made no protest. “That&#39;s right, watch them change..give in to it,” she implored, running a hand along our newest packmate&#39;s thigh. Kristy splayed her legs open, filling the room with her scent as her fingers found her clit and began to play.<br />
<br />
Tabitha frantically tugged at my pants, popping the fly open roughly, and yanked them down. My cock bounced excitedly, rock hard and straining at my boxers. Her tiny tits jiggled as she dropped to the floor, her skin bathed in sweat already, and she positioned herself on all fours, angling her ass upward, giving me a full view of her glistening, shaven mound. “What about me..rrrrrrr....? She asked with a growl, glancing over her shoulder, showing me sharper teeth, as her ears began to stretch and become pointed.<br />
<br />
“You..” I stared at her, feeling the call of the animal inside of me, fighting against the change a bit, “You and Kim..go to Leslie&#39;s Ladies&#39; Gym...and let them remember how natural it is to be attracted to a woman, particularly at moonrise..”<br />
<br />
Tabitha&#39;s spine rippled, and I pushed my boxers off. I positioned myself right at the entrance to her mound, letting the tip of my cock tease at her entrance as she rocked back and forth on all fours. My biceps began to swell, and my sack tightened against me as a sheath began to form. I could let myself go in just a moment, but I had one final thing to say.<br />
<br />
“Kristy and I..” my chest began to swell, and I had to pause as my ribcage barrelled out and black fur slowly grew from my pores, from my navel to sternum. “Will go to the college library, where she&#39;ll get her taste of blood while we harvest our picks of the bright young minds..” <br />
<br />
I could see that the change was all the pack cared about. I wasn&#39;t sure if my words were carrying any weight at all, as we all continued to succumb to our primal urges and the ecstasy of the transformation. Truthfully, that&#39;s all I could think about in the moment as well, as my senses were being assaulted by the aroma of the emerging she-wolves, and the sensations of my change.<br />
<br />
As I pushed inside of Tabitha, I reasoned I could go over the plan again later. Now, it was time for fun.</p>
