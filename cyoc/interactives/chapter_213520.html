<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Allison accepted the next chat request and saw a brother and sister. The boy had close-cropped brown hair, and was probably around 17. The girl in the background looked 15, and her red hair was in twin braids on either side of her head. She was cute but seemed to be  wearing outdated clothing. The blue dress she wore with an apron would fit in more with Little House on the Prairie than a live stream. She also wore shiny black shoes with stockings that alternated red and white stripes.<br />
<br />
The girl standing in the background started jumping with excitement. &quot;She answered!&quot;<br />
<br />
The boy smiled as he turned to talk to her. &quot;Calm down Annie.&quot; While his sister&#39;s outfit seemed outdated, he was dressed in a T-shirt for a metal band Allison remembered hearing was on tour, as well as blue jeans, which could be partially seen in the chair he sat in at his computer. <br />
<br />
Both siblings had southern accents. The boy began speaking. &quot;My name&#39;s Jamie and that&#39;s my sister Annie. I&#39;m a long time viewer, first time caller, and let me say we are both excited to be on the show.&quot;<br />
<br />
Allison smiled. &quot;Well it&#39;s always good to speak with a fan. Do you mind telling me about the change you&#39;re looking for and why you would like it?&quot; Allison wanted to ask about Annie&#39;s dress but didn&#39;t want to be rude. Maybe she just had a peculiar sense of style.<br />
<br />
Fortunately Jamie broached that topic first. &quot;As you may be thinking from our accents and Annie&#39;s cosplay, we do live in the south, and on a farm. Despite any stereotypes, we haven&#39;t dressed like that since, like the 1800s. Annie is just weird.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not weird!&quot; She objected. &quot;And this isn&#39;t cosplay!&quot;Annie placed both of her hands on her hips and said proudly, &quot;It&#39;s about to be my new uniform.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uniform?&quot; Allison asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeaahhhh.&quot; Jamie dragged the word out. &quot;So here&#39;s the thing. Annie&#39;s first doll was one of those Ragedy Ann dolls. Our parents thought it was funny since she was also named Ann and has red hair. Anyways Annie developed an unhealthy obsession with the doll, which led her to dress as her for Halloween when she was 5, 10, and most recently this year at 15.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s not unhealthy!&quot; Annie interjected. <br />
<br />
&quot;Considering what we are doing next, I&#39;d say it&#39;s debatable.&quot; Jamie told her before turning back to the camera. &quot;Anyways, that&#39;s why Annie had this outfit handy for her performance on tonight&#39;s show. See, I&#39;m in FFA. You know, Future Farmers of America? We raise cattle and and grow crops for class and our graded on it. Problem is, we have a crow problem. They are ruining my crops. Conventional knowledge says that the best solution is a scarecrow but I don&#39;t have money for one right now and dad wants me to learn to be self-sufficient. Which is his way of saying he isn&#39;t paying for it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well that sucks. Even with your grades on the line?&quot; Allison asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, dad does believe in tough love.&quot; Jamie continued. &quot;Don&#39;t get me wrong. He&#39;s a great dad and has done a lot for us. If he thought I was in real trouble he would come running to safe me. Problem is I&#39;m a resourceful guy and I have earned his faith in me. Which puts us in out current dilemma. &quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So it&#39;s Annie to the rescue!&quot; His sister cried in the background. <br />
<br />
Jamie rolled his eyes. &quot;Yeaaaahh. So, I got a part time job to get the money but based off if how fast the crows are getting my field while I&#39;m at school and work, I&#39;m not going to do very well when it comes time to harvest. I found the whole thing stressful and decided to tune in to your stream to unwind.&quot;<br />
<br />
Allison smiled. &quot;I&#39;m glad to help anyway I can.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I&#39;ll need you and Annie both for this one. I came in late, so I was a little confused when I saw Adrian. I thought I was in the wrong stream for a moment before you turned back. Then I saw you turn your brother into your sis. I was flabbergasted. Annie walked in when Rachel started kissing Josie.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;OH, I thought he was unwinding in a different way when I saw that.&quot; Annie added.<br />
<br />
&quot;I had to explain but then you started talking to Ava. Some of the things she said about wanting a new owner kind of made Annie doubt me about this not being a porn channel.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She makes a real pretty kitty though.&quot; Annie said. <br />
<br />
Ava put her paws on Allison&#39;s desk and mewed a thank you. Allison started to wonder if Ava still understood human speech and how much of her was still in there and how much was just a normal house cat. Questions for later when Allison turns her back. At least for a bit. Ava could stay a cat if she wanted, right?<br />
<br />
Annie took over the narrative from there. &quot;After seeing Ava turn into a cat I got an idea. Your chornivac can turn anyone into anything right?&quot; Allison nodded her confirmation. &quot;So Jamie here needs a scarecrow. As my big brother he has done a lot for me and is always looking out for me. Even if he is annoying and smells bad.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, yeah. FFA, working the fields is hard work, feeding cows and manure and what not. Point is, after Ava became a cat I rushed off to get dressed. Jamie won&#39;t tell me what I missed. Was it sexy?&quot;<br />
<br />
Allison thought about how handsy Jake and Hailey had gotten. She could tell from the look in Jamie&#39;s eyes on her screen that he didn&#39;t want his sister to know about that bit. It wouldn&#39;t help her reputation anyways, at least not Annie&#39;s opinion that Allison was running a porn channel. &quot;Nothing much. Couple counciling.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;With the chronivac?&quot; Annie asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know they say date your best friend? Well that&#39;s difficult when your both guys and neither are gay. So there&#39;s one more girl out there now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Annie smiled. &quot;Cool. She can take my place. So as I was getting to, I&#39;d like you to turn me into a scarecrow. &quot;<br />
<br />
Allison nodded. &quot;And the outfit?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I do like Ragedy Ann, not like obsessively like Jamie says. It&#39;s just an easy costume and kind of nostalgic you know? Besides, when I&#39;m mostly straw I need something to keep it all in so an outfit that covers a lot helps. So can you do it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course! Hey chat, are you ready to see Annie help her brother with his class project?&quot; The chat&#39;s response was positive. She noticed she was getting a lot of new followers from this stream, and the number of viewers kept rising. Based off of their user names it would seem they were similar to Ava in terms of their interests. <br />
<br />
The chat comments were mostly new viewers, but some old ones were mixed in<br />
<br />
It&#39;s sweet to see siblings helping each other out<br />
<br />
Come on! Objectify her!<br />
<br />
Wish my younger siblings were as helpful. Never been thanked once. Maybe if you turn my twin bothers into girls they&#39;d be nicer. Can you see my messages right now? There are a lot of comments.<br />
<br />
We doing inanimate changes now? Awesome. You&#39;re the best Allison!<br />
<br />
Allison began to type on her chronivac..<br />
<br />
Annie Brown <br />
Age: 15<br />
Job: student<br />
Race: human<br />
<br />
With a few clicks it read as follows<br />
Raggedy Annie<br />
Job: Guard the fields (Unusually Effective)<br />
Race: Ragedy Ann Scarecrow<br />
<br />
Once the orders was inputted, the change in Annie was immediate. She seemed to inflate slightly, the skin of her face thickened, slowly turning into a burlap sack. Her ears merged with the rest and fadded from existence. Her nose, mouth and eyes sunk into her face. Soon the nose and mouth were just sewn on designs. Her pupils began to expand until they covered the whole of the eyes. They began to buldge out some and took the shape of buttons.<br />
<br />
Her hair slowly darkened in color and the braids lengthen some. Soon, instead of her natural red hair it was crimson yarn on its head. Her dress sleeves came down to her elbows. Her skin below also turned into burlap, her fingers merging into mittens. Straw began to emerge from the dress sleeves and around the neck.<br />
<br />
Her candy cane stocking also bulged and began to wobbly as her bones were converted to straw. The shoes expanded in size until they were clownishly large. Straw also peaked out where her ankles once was.<br />
<br />
Raggedy Annie fell back woods, her stuffed head thumping quietly against the back wall. She slid down until they were in a sitting position. <br />
<br />
Jamie stood up from his computer and walked over to his former sister. He poked its cheek, and formed a soft depression in the stuffed burlap. When he pulled away the stray pushed the burlap back out. &quot;Wow! She&#39;s really a scarecrow!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not just a scarecrow!&quot; Allison announced. &quot;With the Chronivac, Raggedy Annie now has a setting of being an unusually effective scarecrow. With this, your crops are 100% guaranteed safe!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jamie grabbed Raggedy Annie by the shoulders and lifted it up so it appeared to be standing. The scarecrow&#39;s head limply hung backwards,  exposing more straw. &quot;Thanks a lot Allison! These means a lot. To both of us. Honestly I think Annie always wanted to be Raggedy Annie here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m just happy I can help. Tell me how the crops go!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Will do. Bye everyone.&quot; Jamie used his free hand to grab Raggedy Annie&#39;s arm and held it up. Making it wave as he did a bad impression of her voice. &quot;Bye Allison. Thank you so much for helping me achieve my dreams&quot; He said in a high pitch voice.<br />
<br />
Allison laughed. &quot;Anytime Annie.&quot; Allison closed out of the video chat. &quot;Okay everyone, I think it&#39;s time for...&quot;</p>
