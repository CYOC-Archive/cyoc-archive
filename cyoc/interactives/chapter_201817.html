<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">With an army of fat, fluffy animals covering the neighborhood, the only one that wasn’t transformed was Boris, who clutched his rifle and pointed the barrel towards the door, waiting for one of the creatures to trespass again. Marcy got the group together and devised a plan to simply outnumber Boris and surround him. They would start with surrounding the house from back to front and letting Marcy and Sasha lead the front since Frankie had already experienced Boris. <br />
<br />
Boris was rocking to himself in the corner of the room, his rifle clutched and his hand on the trigger, waiting for someone to trespass on his property. “Boris, come on out here! You know you want to hug us. I know how lonely you’ve been.” Marcy said, closing in on him. Boris pointed his gun where the voice was coming from, but saw no shadow, so he crept up slowly. “Scram, you demon! Go spread your magic hippy shit somewhere else.” He looked outside his front door, no one was there. He peeked outside just enough to put his face out there, and the entire property was empty. He closed his door, locked it, and relaxed on his ragged couch. He was about to set his gun down when he heard something move in his kitchen, so he pointed his gun towards the noise and went towards the kitchen slowly, waiting for something else to stir. That’s when he saw it, out of his back window, two of them fucking in his backyard. He pointed the gun at them as they scurried away, he screamed at them, “You get your disgusting fat asses OFF of my land before I blast the fur and fat off of you!” He fired a few shots in their general direction, unaware that the others had surrounded him. Marcy had managed to get into his roof and was waiting tor just enough clearance to pounce on him. He chased them a little further and then heard his roof relax. He turned behind him and was blinded  by a mass of orange fur that wrapped around his body, pinning him to his back porch. Where it should have hurt, putting him in the hospital, he strangely felt warm.  He tried to push Marcy off of him, but he found himself getting weaker and weaker. He wasn’t prepared for the changes that would occur next.<br />
<br />
He felt himself get pulled into his mind as an apparition of his wife appeared. “What is this?” He wanted to push it away, but he was too overcome with emotions to really do anything. He swears that he could hear her voice, feel her hands as she touched his body. He teared up as he was convinced the apparition before him was actually his wife. It hugged him, kissed his ragged, scruffy cheek, and cradled him in its bosom. Boris quieted down and fell asleep, making something interesting happen.<br />
<br />
Boris had a thousand yard stare as his body plumped up. His scraggly beard fell out as his face and body softened up, becoming more feminine. Light gray (almost white) fur grew in love of his body hair as actual female boobs exploded out of his wife beater. His wife beater became more of a pathetic excuse for a bra as his body inflated and tore the shirt apart, exposing his bare chest. What once was an old man’s gut filled out into a round orb that almost made him look pregnant. The fur grew in thick as a once tiny, smelly, old man dick was replaced by big, stretchy, pussy lips and a medium-small clit. Boris was now a female, and the hips and ass of that female tore the worn out shorts into shreds. Her hands and feet swelled up as they became paws, fat piling onto the digits making her soft. Her face stretched out into a chunky muzzle as fat piled onto her face. Her ears turned pointy and moved to the top of her head, a long, furry tail grew out of her lower back, and the last bit of fat settled as she took a deep breath. What was once a sour, old man turned into a large MILF wolf that was now embracing Marcy tenderly, their combined weight now causing the porch to bend and creak dangerously. Boris was no more, and Valeriya was left in his place. Now the entire neighborhood was fluffy, fat, and happy.</p>
