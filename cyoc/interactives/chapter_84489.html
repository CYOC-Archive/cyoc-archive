<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The morning was crisp and cool, a slight wind rustled the fallen leaves scattered across the school yard. Sasha sat on a secluded bench and watched the flow of students wandering into the warm building. She had a faint hope that she&#39;d see Will bound down the road with Dave and Ross in tow, still a thirteen year old. But she knew that was unlikely. Whatever happened after their previous encounter turned foul, Sasha knew he didn&#39;t return home. Her mom woke her early that morning to ask if she&#39;d spoken to him as his dad was worried, not that Will hadn&#39;t performed this &quot;run away from home for a few days to spook his parents&quot; trick before. She mentioned seeing him at the usual spot, but didn&#39;t want to divulge further details. As if anyone would believe that her boyfriend had aged 10 years and tried chatting her up. The disturbing memory made her shake in disgust. It was one thing to be hit on by boys her age, but a fully grown man? It was sick, even if he was her age just hours before. And if that gypsy kid was right, he was only going to get older. She tried to care that there was a chance Will could be dying or even dead from old age by this morning, but the way he treated her had left her feeling cold.<br />
<br />
A couple of familiar faces appeared in the crowds heading into the school, Dave and Ross. Sasha couldn&#39;t make out Will with them and sighed, standing up to greet them. She was surprised when they walked straight past her and to a small boy reading by the gym, Jake she realised with a gasp. Did they find out that he&#39;d cursed Will with this rapid aging? They were probably going to beat the shit out of him for messing with their leader. She couldn&#39;t let them do that, he was the only one who could stop Will from aging if he came to his senses in time! Sasha ran towards her friends and shouted &quot;Oi! Where are you going?&quot;<br />
<br />
Dave and Ross turned towards her and Jake looked up from his book. They waited for her to catch up before Dave said &quot;We just wanted to have a little talk with Voodoo Boy here&quot;.<br />
<br />
The two continued the final steps towards Jake who was cowering in his seat. They sat on either side of him and Ross said &quot;We heard a rumour you might have put a curse on our boy, made him older&quot;. <br />
<br />
Jake stuck out his hands and cried &quot;It was an accident, I didn&#39;t think it would really work! I&#39;ll reverse it if he comes back, I promise!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, you&#39;ve got it all wrong. We want you to curse us as well, if you can call it that. Become a man instantly? Sounds more like a blessing&quot; Dave replied, Ross nodding his head approvingly.<br />
<br />
Both Sasha and Jake yelled &quot;What!?&quot; in unison. Sasha didn&#39;t understand it, they wanted to be older as well? She concluded &quot;Why? You&#39;re cursed to keep on aging until you die, who knows if Will is even still alive by now!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t curse you, I promised my mother that I wouldn&#39;t. It was all an accident, I don&#39;t even know if I could do it again&quot; Jake stammered, not wanted to provoke them any further. It was bad enough that he did it once, but to purposely do it a second time?<br />
<br />
&quot;Look, either you can use your magic mojo and make us adults, or we&#39;ll just give you a reason to&quot; Dave said, cracking his knuckles in his palm. <br />
<br />
Jake shook his head and said &quot;I can&#39;t, I just can&#39;t...&quot;<br />
<br />
Ross grabbed Jake by the collar and held his arms behind his back while Dave got ready to deliver some &#39;inspiration&#39;. But before he could throw a punch, Sasha yelled out &quot;Wait! I have an idea. You said you needed to make some sort of counter curse to fix Will right?&quot;. Jake nodded his head nervously. &quot;Right, and you&#39;ve never done it before, you need practice. So what if you humor these dweebs, use your gypsy curse to make them older and use them as practice for when Will actually comes back?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jake glanced at each of the delinquents surrounding him. Could he really use those papers his grandma gave him? On purpose? Even if he did, Sasha had dumped all the ingredients he needed for the counter curse over his head the previous day. He&#39;d need some time to collect them again. And the papers were unpredictable, what worked on Will might be completely different on Ross and Dave. But he needed to answer quickly, he could tell Dave was getting impatient and eager to punch his face in. What should he do?<br />
<br />
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Sunlight poured into the dingy motel room, right into Will&#39;s face. He groaned and rolled over to try and get back to sleep, but it was no use. He rubbed his face, feeling the dry skin and furry cheeks he now possessed. He groaned and opened his eyes. It wasn&#39;t a dream, he really had aged into a man, stolen a motorcycle and checked into a motel. He grunted as he sat up, his gut unflatteringly bulging over his pants and vaguely into his lap. He groaned some more, he didn&#39;t remember being that rotund before going to bed. But then again, he was so tired last night that his head had barely hit the pillow before he fell asleep. With a sigh, he shifted out of bed and walked to the bathroom. Looking at his reflection, he thought he looked pretty rough. The fluorescent lighting did little to help, highlighting every faint line that creased the corners of his eyes, lining his mouth and crossing his forehead, his completely bare scalp reflecting the sickly light with a dull glow. He rubbed the smooth skin forlornly, he was sure he still had a bit of hair left on top, even if it was shaved down to a stubble. And was there always so much grey hair throughout his beard? It had certainly increased while he had slept, as did his weight. But given how quickly he had aged the previous day, he was happy to not have woken up an old man. Besides, he didn&#39;t think he looked too bad, still as tough and intimidating as he&#39;d come to love, and it was certainly better than being a teenager that was for sure. He stripped out of his clothes and posed in the mirror. He noted that it looked like the spread of grey had reached his chest, seeing a few silver hairs poking through. And whatever definition he had last night had almost faded now. His chest had softened while his stomach had expanded outwards into a tight beer belly. He slapped the mound in curiosity, laughing as it rippled slightly. <br />
<br />
Will turned on the shower and frowned at the dribble that came out, but it would have to do. He stunk to high heaven and couldn&#39;t stand smelling like that. He got under the water and shivered, partially from the cool water temperature, and partially from the bizarre experience of water directly hitting his scalp instead of his hair. &quot;At least I won&#39;t have to use any shampoo&quot; he muttered to himself as he turned the temperature higher. Soon, he was enjoying the warm water running over his flabby body and making patterns in his thick body hair. He rubbed a bar of soap over his hairy skin. Once he reached his nether regions, he nudged his long, limp dick and smiled. He had barely thought about his enlarged organ since all the changes began. He hadn&#39;t even had the chance to play with himself until now.Wrapping his meaty hand around it, he started rubbing it up and down, thinking of the sexiest fantasies that he could. But even his most erotic thoughts couldn&#39;t seem to cause a rise in his dick, staying as soft as ever. Eventually he gave up, figuring it wasn&#39;t worth his time. He&#39;d deal with it later when he&#39;d certainly have some lovely lady to please instead of his own thoughts. He turned off the shower and grabbed a ratty towel from the side of the sink. It didn&#39;t even wrap around his waist. Sighing, he wiped the small fabric around his body before collapsing onto his bed and turning the TV on.<br />
<br />
It was just morning shows on all channels, and the motel wasn&#39;t even up-scale enough to afford porn channels. Will was left to his mind instead as he realised he had no idea what he was doing. He fled from town because he wanted to start a new life cruising the road on his motorcycle. Yet he&#39;d have to go back eventually, possibly within the day, all because that gypsy freak had cursed him to age at random. It seemed to have died down for now, he&#39;d barely aged at all in the night. Though he guessed that he had to be on the wrong side of 40 now. He grinned at the thought, his dad was 40 and he was likely older than that now. It was a bit thrilling knowing he was elder than his elder. He gave his beard a victory stroke, yeah he enjoyed being an adult. Who decided this was a curse? If he got too old then he could just get that brat to use the counter curse on him. Then Will sat upright, what if the counter curse turned him back into a 13 year old? He didn&#39;t want that, not after being so free and independent as a man. He&#39;d just find another way to stop the curse, a way that would keep him an adult. Then he could think about getting a job, or even just becoming a biker for life, cruising the streets on his trusty motorcycle.<br />
<br />
Will finally stood up and grabbed his clothes, recoiling from the pungent smell emanating from them. A potent odour of sweat, booze, smoke, and other unknown scents. He couldn&#39;t wear these,he&#39;d just showered to get rid of the smell! And holding them up in the mirror, he never realised just how out of place they looked on his new body, made for someone more than half his age. Digging around the small room, he eventually found a small discarded can of deodorant that had at least a little punch left, but not enough to mask the smell. Will moaned aloud, he had nothing else to wear, then he had an idea. Digging through his pockets, he found the cigars he&#39;d taken from the pouch on the motorcycle. It wasn&#39;t ideal but it was better to smell of stale smoke than the current mix of odours trapped in the fabric. He lit up a cigar and stuffed it in his mouth, inhaling deeply and enjoying the rich, woody undertones. With every exhale, Will blew the smoke towards the pile of clothes, occasionally turning them so they&#39;d be completely covered. Soon the air was hazy from the lingering smoke wafting in the air. <br />
<br />
Will was so absorbed in getting his clothes smelling less grotty, he failed to notice as he aged another three years to 45 years old. Spending so much time smoking  led to further changes that ensured he would be an avid smoker for years to come. His fingernails, teeth, and the hair surrounding his lips turned a slight shade of yellow. More wrinkles appeared and deepened across his face while it subtly rounded out as he put on a bit more weight. A small amount of grey was added to his beard while the existing greys lightened slightly. More grey scattered the horseshoe of stubble that surrounded his head, growing a tad like he hadn&#39;t had a trim for a few weeks. And yet more grey hair stained the thick coating of fur on his chest and back, tingeing much of it to a steel like colour. More bulk was added to his stomach, causing it to bloat out and sag further down. His chest softened and became more flabby. By the time he&#39;d smoked the cigar to a stub, all Will noticed was an increased desire to smoke, making a mental note to buy more cigars when out looking for a new outfit. He smelt the clothes, satisfied that they no longer held the original pungent mix of smells, and pulled them on. He searched the room to make sure he hadn&#39;t forgotten anything before leaving, hacking and coughing like he&#39;d caught a cold.</p>
