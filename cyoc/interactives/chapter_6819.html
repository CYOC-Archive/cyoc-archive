<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ben pressed the mouse button down over the link reading &quot;You're a motorcycle <br />
trooper in the state police force&quot;.  He'd always had a thing about men in uniform and <br />
the thought of seeing his character morph into one of those hot studs made his cock <br />
swell in his silk boxers until it poked out of the fly at the front.<br />
<br />
Reaching down between his legs, Ben began to stroke his now hard boner as he <br />
watched the screen to see what was going to happen to his character.  After a few <br />
seconds, Ben began to feel a strange tingling sensation and an itching feeling on his <br />
right arm.  Looking down he was surprised to see that the the dark hair on his arm <br />
seemed to be thinning and getting lighter as well.  Jumping up from the chair by the <br />
computer, Ben looked down his body and uttered a strangled cry of surprise as he <br />
realised that all his chest and body hair was thinning and turning blond.<br />
<br />
Running over to the mirror by his bed, Ben stood in front of it and watched as the <br />
changes in his body hair seemed to rise up to the top of his chest and on up his neck.  <br />
In amazement, Ben watched as his normally heavy five o'clock shadow lightened until <br />
it wasn't really noticeable and then began to grow out along his upper lip and chin <br />
meeting at the sides of his mouth to form a dense and bush moustache and goatee.  <br />
Without warning, the changes spread to his eyebrows which faded until they were <br />
merely blond wisps above his eyes.  He couldn't believe what was happening to him <br />
but realised that it much have something to do with that website and his choice of the <br />
State Trooper from the random changes.<br />
<br />
Reaching down to his cock, Ben squeezed his rigid boner hard as a new sensation <br />
started on the top of his head.   Looking  up to his reflection in the mirror, Ben again <br />
watched in amazement as his dark hair lightened to blond and the style began to <br />
reshape from a neat short back and sides into a military looking crew cut.  As the <br />
stinging sensation heightened the hair all stood on end and set in a short flat-top of <br />
the kind that generals in the army set their watches by.<br />
<br />
Now, staring back at him from the mirror was a stranger.  Sure it was his face and <br />
body, but the change in hair colour and style, plus the beard, was so drastic that he <br />
almost didn't recognise himself.  As he pondered his reflection, he began to worry, <br />
what if he couldn't change back?<br />
<br />
Running back to the computer, Ben looked at the screen and saw that the web page <br />
he had been looking at was refreshing itself.  unable to get a response from his web <br />
browser and not wanting to close it down, he nervously sat down at the chair <br />
wondering what was going to happen next.<br />
<br />
Without any warning, Ben suddenly felt a pressure around his genitals and looking <br />
down he saw that he was no longer wearing silk boxers but was instead wearing a <br />
very revealing black jock-strap.  Running back to the mirror and afraid of what might <br />
happen next, Ben looked at himself and tried to work out what was different.  Sure he <br />
was now blond, less hairy and wearing a black jock-strap but something else seemed <br />
different.<br />
<br />
As he wondered what had changed, Ben became aware of a stiffness in his knees and <br />
suddenly found that he was unable to move his legs at all.  The feeling of paralysis <br />
quickly spread to his torso and upper body and then as if invisible hands were <br />
moving them, his arms fell to his sides and locked into place jutting out slightly from <br />
his sides as if he were carrying heavy bags.<br />
<br />
With a feeling of panic and terror welling up inside him, Ben attempted to call out for <br />
help but the paralysis had spread to his neck and face and now all he could do was <br />
watch his immobile reflection in the mirror as he stood impassively before it.  Unable <br />
to look anywhere but straight ahead, Ben began to wonder how he could have been <br />
so stupid as to play with something like that website without knowing what was <br />
involved.<br />
<br />
The sensation of anxiety had killed of his erection in a matter of seconds and he now <br />
stood looking at the reflection of a handsome looking man in a sexy black jock-strap <br />
which in any other circumstances would have had his heart going and his cock <br />
begging for attention.  This however was not a good situation and he tried to <br />
reassure himself by telling himself that this wasn't the kind of eventuality that you <br />
could either prepare for or avoid.<br />
<br />
His mind going off on wild tangents and 'what if's', he was suddenly snapped out of <br />
his day dream by the appearance of a pair of heavy duty Dehner motorcycle boots of <br />
the kind worn by motorcycle cops.  Ben knew what was coming next and began to get <br />
hard again in spite of himself.  Without warning, a pair of tight dark brown breeches <br />
with a tan stripe on each leg appeared on his legs quickly followed by a tight white t-<br />
shirt and then a dark brown uniform shirt with tan pocket flaps on the chest and tan <br />
epaulettes on the shoulders which was buttoned to the neck.  Ben's cock strained at <br />
the tight clinging fabric of the breeches and he began to enjoy the sensation of the <br />
cloth as it hugged his thighs and butt.<br />
<br />
As he continued to watch, with a growing sense of sexual euphoria, a dark brown clip <br />
on tie appeared at his neck and then, in quick succession, a sheriffs badge on his <br />
chest and a belt with handcuffs and a gun at his waist.  Staring back at him was an <br />
altered version of himself - blond hair, flat-top and dressed in a state trooper's <br />
uniform.<br />
<br />
He tried again to move but was unable to and wondered what was next.  Looking at <br />
himself in the mirror he noticed suddenly that he was starting to grow, not in height <br />
but in muscle.  His arms and shoulders broadened and his chest strained out against <br />
the taut fabric of his shirt.  He also noticed that he seemed to be shrinking slightly in <br />
height and with a start, realised that he was getting younger.  With a growing sense <br />
of horror, Ben wondered where the adventure was going to end...<br />
<br />
After what seemed like an age but was in reality only a matter of seconds, Ben finally <br />
stopped changing and looking at himself, estimated that he must be about ten years <br />
younger, about 24 or 25.  Suddenly finding himself able to move he stepped forward <br />
towards the mirror and without any warning passed out on the floor.<br />
<br />
Ben came to, blinking and sitting up from his place on the floor.  Looking around him <br />
he saw his flat, but it was not his flat - was it?  He saw possessions of his that he had <br />
had when he was younger and although the surroundings seemed familiar he knew <br />
something wasn't right.  Suddenly, remembering the computer, the website and the <br />
changes, he sprung to his feet and turned around to find the mirror.  It had moved <br />
along the wall but what was most surprising when he stood in front of it was the <br />
figure in the reflection, a well built, muscular young man in a state trooper's uniform.<br />
<br />
Rubbing his forehead, disorientedly, Ben's head began to clear and he realised that <br />
this was the way things were meant to be.  He knew that he was now the newest <br />
rookie cop on the motorcycle squad and he also knew that he used to be 34, recently <br />
separated and work in an office.  Turning around to the bed, he picked up his <br />
motorcycle helmet and jacket and headed for the door, enjoying the sensation of his <br />
breeches against his legs.  His shift started in 30 minutes and he knew he couldn't be <br />
late or Sarge would kick his butt.  Besides, there was also Rick, his 35 year old bear of <br />
a partner who  was going to take him to a quiet place today and initiate him the good <br />
old fashioned way with a fuck in the mountains.</p>
