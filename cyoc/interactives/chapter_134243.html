<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;So what do you think all this talk about a meeting could be about?&quot; Claire asked quietly to Jen as the two of them went about washing the dishes after dinner. <br />
<br />
A part of her was surprised by the fact that Tad was the one who had brought up hearing rumors about a &quot;big&quot; City Council meeting. She never remembered paying that much attention to what her old home town did with regard to city matters, usually as the &quot;biggest&quot; thing that went on was a fine for someone&#39;s horse escaping the ranch it was on and needing to be caught and trucked back. She began to get more aware of things by the time she got to college, but that had been more with things at the State and Federal levels, not at individual town levels of government. She&#39;d noticed that there often was a bit more attention to local issues in Moon Lake, which she guessed was in relation to the were secret and all that.<br />
<br />
It could be something else, but then Claire didn&#39;t think that business ventures or parking laws would be something that would raise the rumor of an &quot;important&quot; meeting. Where someone parked wasn&#39;t all that important and could easily be fixed. However, since coming to Moon Lake and learning about how Moon Lake&#39;s weres had a lot of their laws arranged to protect the secret of their existence, Claire couldn&#39;t personally think of anything else that could really draw up so many rumors. The recent battle between the police and Dymixious Drake might be one thing, but Moon Lake&#39;s newspaper put one article on it and no one had voiced any protest at Dymixious being killed. And while Claire wasn&#39;t a policy expert by any means, she figured that an important meeting over the battle with Dymixious Drake wasn&#39;t likely as no one in Moon Lake seemed to have any issue with the man&#39;s death. Which brought her back to the issue of the were secret, but then she couldn&#39;t fathom what would specifically be the cause for a meeting along those lines, as Moon Lake seemed rather firm in its commitment to trying to keep the secret a secret.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... as I said at dinner... I really wasn&#39;t out enough to hear much in the way of rumors,&quot; Jen answered as she ran the water at the main sink, &quot;I handled my appointments and they went relatively well and some small errands, but not enough to hear anything. In this I then came back here in the hopes of hearing something more with regards to interviews and job offers.&quot;<br />
<br />
Claire nodded. Moving in with Jen was a big step, and before becoming a werecat she would have never seriously considered moving in with another woman, but something about Jen felt very special. And it wasn&#39;t just that she was the werecat who&#39;d actually given her what she wanted in letting her become a werecat, herself. There was something else that and Claire did like that very much, which left her comfortable in helping Jen with regard to the affairs of running the house and this including getting caught up to speed that Jen had also been looking for work. Given what Claire knew on were lifespans that made sense, in that Jen as a young woman by were standards couldn&#39;t live off of her husband&#39;s pension, not for long without raising eyebrows.<br />
<br />
&quot;Moon Lake&#39;s had &quot;big&quot; meetings before though,&quot; Jen then commented, &quot;this could just be something related to a new business wanting to set up shop in town or something like that. The town would want to look over the proposal and see if they&#39;re willing to hire local residents or are bringing in their own workers to run the operation... which would then bring the whole were-secret into play.&quot;<br />
<br />
Claire nodded as that seem to play to what she expected in a place like Moon Lake with regard to her experiences and the things that made the town special. What Jen said would make sense in that if a new business wanted to move into town there would be a lot of potential for things related to the were-secret to come up. As while a new business coming to a town wasn&#39;t exactly something super special, but it would be something important to be ready for, and with weres living in fear of exposure or being hunted that would mean an &quot;important&quot; meeting.<br />
<br />
&quot;I was kind of surprised that Tad was the one to bring it up,&quot; Claire commented as she handed the last plate to Jen as they finished up with the dishes, &quot;I don&#39;t think I was ever aware of anything of that sort of thing when I was his age...&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen nodded and fished up the scrubbing of the plate that Claire had handed her. It was really only a rinsing, but putting them through the dishwasher could wait and they could soak over night. She turned to Claire and felt herself smile with pride.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jeff and I always taught Tad to be civically aware and responsible,&quot; Jen gave a small smile as the two began to leave the kitchen, turning off the lights as they went, &quot;as up until now we were often traveling between bases and such, which meant a lot of potential big changes with regards on where to park and when to shovel your driveway after a blizzard and so on. And being responsible is never a bad thing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then I&#39;d think both of you have done well with him,&quot; Claire spoke as she put hand on Jen&#39;s shoulder as they began to head up the stairs with an obvious destination in mind, &quot;I just wish we had more than just guesses as to what this meeting could be about...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We can&#39;t know everything,&quot; Jen chuckled and they continued to make their way toward the bedroom.</p>
