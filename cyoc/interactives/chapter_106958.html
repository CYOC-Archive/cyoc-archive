<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jim looked at his sister, and Judy shrieked, &quot;No.&quot; Jim held up the balloon and quickly inflated it. &quot;Don&#39;t do this,&quot; his sister pleaded. He whispered a new spell, this one was much shorter. &quot;Please don&#39;t,&quot; Judy said. &quot;I promise I&#39;ll be good from now on. Always. Please.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jim smiled. &quot;I know you will,&quot; he said and then let the balloon rapidly deflate.<br />
<br />
&quot;NOOOOooooo!&quot; Judy cried, her voice growing rapidly higher and quieter as she seemed to fall into herself. Her arms flung up into the air as if she were on a roller coaster, while her rapid shrinking pulled her down into her emptying clothes almost as fast as dropping to the floor. As soon as she disappeared into her piled clothes, Jim stopped up the balloon and said, &quot;Release.&quot; He let it deflate and put it away again as he walked up to examine the pile.<br />
<br />
A tiny head poked out of the neck hole of her pink shirt. Her little eyes were opened wide as they examined the impossibly large room around her. She could hardly believe that the heap of warm, thick cloth surrounding her had been the clothes she was wearing only seconds ago.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on out,&quot; Jim said. She squeaked and dove into her underwear to hide from her apparently giant older brother who loomed above her now.<br />
<br />
&quot;Leave her alone,&quot; squeaked Dani.<br />
<br />
&quot;You shut your mouth if you ever want to be normal again,&quot; Jim replied. &quot;It will be the same for you as well, LITTLE sister, if you don&#39;t come out when I say. Now, come out.&quot;<br />
<br />
A lump in the middle of her clothes shifted its place, and her head emerged again. Standing up now to her full 6 inches in height, she held part of her shirt up in front of her to cover her nude body. She seemed ready to cry at any moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now,&quot; said Jim. &quot;Wait, while I grab you some clothes.&quot; He turned and ran upstairs. They could hear his footsteps enter Judy&#39;s room.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do we do?&quot; the tiny girl squeaked. Her voice was nearly inaudible now with how high-pitched it had become.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; said Dani in a slightly less squeaky voice. &quot;For now, we wait and see.&quot;<br />
<br />
A minute later Jim returned holding a doll in his hand. &quot;Do you recognize this?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; said Judy. &quot;That&#39;s one of my dolls.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s right,&quot; said Jim. &quot;I always thought these dolls looked so weird with their giant heads and big feet. They&#39;re so out of proportion. How will we get their clothes to fit you, I wonder?&quot; he said, rubbing his chin for dramatic effect.<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; said Judy as she saw him take out the balloon again. &quot;You don&#39;t have to do that. I can just stay naked. That&#39;s fine.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jim acted offended. &quot;What kind of big brother would I be to let my little sister run around naked?&quot; He stood the doll next to her clothes for comparison and then whispered his spell. &quot;Now, drop the shirt,&quot; he said. &quot;I need to see all of you to get this right.&quot; For guidance, Judy looked up to Dani, who nodded her head sadly. Judy complied and gave Jim a good view of herself. &quot;Good,&quot; he said. &quot;This will just take a minute, and then you can cover up again.&quot; This time when he blew into the balloon, Judy felt her feet and head swell larger, much larger, leaving her feeling a bit dizzy. &quot;Release,&quot; he said and deflated his balloon. Next, he cast the spell and inflated her hands and lips slightly this time. After releasing that spell, he sized her up again. &quot;Still, too short,&quot; he said after comparing her to the doll. Again, he cast the spell. This time the inflating balloon increased the length of her legs, arms, and neck, but nothing else. &quot;Perfect,&quot; Jim declared after she had reached proper doll height, and then he released the spell again and pocketed the balloon once more.<br />
<br />
After all of that, Judy felt like a wad of gum that had been stretched and squashed and blown up every which way. At least, it was over for now. She held up her big hands in shock and looked down her spidery legs to her giant feet.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m a total freak,&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dani,&quot; Jim said, moving on. &quot;Time to get back to babysitting. Help Judy get dressed. I&#39;ll go get a drink and leave you two alone for some privacy.&quot; He headed for the kitchen, but as he left the room he added, &quot;Oh, and don&#39;t try anything funny like calling for help or trying to run. You&#39;ll never go back to normal then. Yell for me when you finish.&quot;<br />
<br />
Judy shivered at the cold air in the room and at the thought of being trapped forever at this size.<br />
<br />
She looked over to Dani who was unsteadily waddling towards her, balancing her misshapen body with one hand sliding along the couch. With each step, Dani&#39;s broad hips swung widely from one side to the other as if she were trying to walk seductively. Only now that mincing step was the only way she could walk without falling over. Even she seemed like a giant from Judy&#39;s perspective. Dani knelt down before her carefully and, after a quick apology, started stripping the doll. Judy helped position herself as Dani slid the rough fabric of the doll clothes onto her. Working together, they had Judy dressed in her doll outfit in a only couple of minutes. To her shame, it fit perfectly. She looked at the naked doll lying before her, with its exaggerated features, and realized that they were now basically twins.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why couldn&#39;t I have just played with normal shaped dolls?&quot; Judy said.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re done!&quot; Dani yelled to Jim. She stood up unsteadily, looking like a newborn deer, but, eventually, she found her balance.<br />
<br />
Judy, meanwhile, climbed out of her pile of giant, girl-sized clothes and stood on the carpet in her plastic, high-heeled shoes and doll clothes to wait for her giant brother to return.</p>
