<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><br />
“Dude, that was amazing,” Colby finally said, breaking the silence and pulling Tyler from his stupor. He propped himself up on his arms to look at Colby, sitting naked on the chair drinking a beer, his softening cock draped over one leg. His face was flushed, relaxed. <br />
<br />
“I thought so, too,” Tyler chuckled, still enjoying the warm, full feeling emanating from his stomach. Seeing Colby sitting there with his long legs spread and his big cock exposed made Tyler instinctively want to cover his smaller cock. He reached for his trunks to put them on as he stood up from the sand.<br />
<br />
“No, wait,” Colby said, “keep them off.”<br />
<br />
“Really?” Tyler asked, but he’d already let the trunks fall from his hand.<br />
<br />
“Yeah. Its kind of cute,” Colby blushed when he realized what he said and looked away to take another swig.<br />
<br />
“Aw,” Tyler gave a nervous giggle, “thanks.” He looked at the cooler. “Any beer left?”<br />
<br />
“One left. Saved it for you, my tiny, little friend. You earned it.” Colby opened the cooler and tossed the last bottle over to Tyler.<br />
<br />
“Thanks,” Tyler cracked it open. “Its weird how much I like it when you talk about how small I am.” He confessed.<br />
<br />
“It’s weird to me, too. Seeing your small, little dicklet just makes me feel so powerful and manly. I wanna humiliate you for it, but it also makes me want to…fuck you senseless, I guess.” Colby said. “Does it hurt, when I say things like that?” he asked, looking over at Tyler.<br />
<br />
“Honestly?” his friend nodded. “No. It feels…exciting. It makes the muscles in my jaw and my…” Tyler hesitated to say ass after Colby confessed to wanting to fuck his friend senseless. Giving Colby a blowjob was one thing, but neither of them had even had sex with a girl. Tyler wasn’t sure he was ready yet. “It makes my mucles relax and my cock hard.” <br />
<br />
“You’re cocklet,” Colby corrected with a smirk, his chest swelling as he tried out his large-dick status once again. “Though I bet it’ll be more of a chode by the time your birthday comes around.” He said, his voice low and seductive. Tyler squirmed in his chair as the man spoke. “It’ll be so small, you won’t even be able to tell if its hard.” Tyler moaned. “Just a pathetic little bite of a Vienna sausage,” he chuckled, looking down into Tylers crotch to see his four-inch cocklet drooling precum. “I meant what I said before,” he continued.<br />
<br />
“About what?”<br />
<br />
“About being your feeder, dude! You’re a small-dick now, you need a feeder. You service my man-meat, and I’ll protect you and keep the other large-dicks off your back.” Colby said in a business-like tone.<br />
<br />
“What do you mean?”<br />
<br />
Colby gave him a weird look. “Dude, you’re the only small-dick for miles now. I know its our place as large-dicks to use you guys and humiliate you. But if the other men find out you’re going to be beating them back with a stick and…I dunno…” his masculine confidence faltered for a bit as he seemed to search for the right words, “I just don’t want anyone messing with my little buddy, is all.”<br />
<br />
Tyler was taken aback. “That’s…I appreciate that, man. And I accept; I’d rather get fed from my best friend than any other man.” At least for now, Tyler added to himself.<br />
<br />
“Really?” Colby’s face broke into a huge grin. “Hell yeah! We’re gonna have a good time this summer, my little buddy.” Colby leaned back and absentmindedly fondled his semi-hard cock at the prospect. Tyler just watched, trying to guess how big Colby’s cock would finally be by his birthday. <br />
He wished he could give his remaining five inches to Colby right now and have done with it, but he would just have to be patient. The two men stayed on the beack for another hour or so, not bothering to put their clothes back on as they were becoming quite comfortable being baked in front of each other. Colby, of course, had nothing to worry about; he leaned back in his chair, legs spread out, arms folded under his head, and his soft, ten inch cock laying like a sleeping dog across his abdomen, a specimen of masculinity. The sight of him made Tyler feel safe, and confident, despite his diminishing manhood. Colby had been silent for a long minute, and Tyler was wondering what was going on behind the man’s murky brown eyes. But Colby never had been good at explaining his feelings.<br />
<br />
“So, I know you just ate,” he began with a smirk, “But I’m starving. You wanna head over to the sandwich joint?” he asked.<br />
<br />
“I’m down,” Tyler said, blushing. <br />
<br />
“Alright. Let’s get going then, small-dick.” He quipped.<br />
<br />
The two dressed themselves again, with Tyler pausing to watch Colby carefully stuff his heavy balls and pendulous cock back into his swim trunks?<br />
<br />
“Going commando, I see?” Tyler commented.<br />
<br />
“What? Oh, yeah,” he grinned. “My underwear all stopped fitting a few days ago. Big dick problems.” <br />
<br />
Together they packed up their things and collected their trash, trapsing back across the riverbank and through the summer brush until they reached the dusty little strip of a parking lot. <br />
<br />
“Should I meet you there?” Tyler asked, making for his truck.<br />
<br />
“Nah, little buddy. Hop in with me, I’ll swoop ya.” Colby said, going around his car to unlock the passenger door. “C’mon, short-dick. I’m hungry.” His voice was deep and enticing, and Tyler found himself moving towards the car and climbing in. Colby walked around to the drivers side and climbed in, making the car bounce a bit with his added weight. He started the car and together they drove off down the country road.<br />
<br />
Like Tyler, Colby’s car was a crapheap and did not have working air conditioning. They rolled down all the windows to let out the hot car air. Colby sped down the road, one hand casually on the steering wheel and the other resting over the car door. Tyler stretched and leaned back in his seat, lifting his pelvis and making his trunks stretch. Colby looked over and noticed, letting out a snicker. <br />
<br />
“Damn, its like its getting smaller every second. You don’t even have a bulge anymore, dude. You might wanna stuff it if you want to go inside the shop.” He recommended.<br />
<br />
“Oh, shit! You’re right.” Tyler exclaimed. He looked around Colby’s dirty car, not sure what he was going to use or what would even be effective before Colby opined,<br />
<br />
“Don’t worry, little buddy. I got some socks in my gym bag in the trunk.” <br />
<br />
“They better be clean socks,” Tyler grumbled, crossing his legs.<br />
<br />
Colby slowed down as they rounded a bend and came upon a shabby little gas station and deli perched on one corner of a four-way intersection. There were only two other trucks parked in front; the rugged, big-wheeled crawlers that Tyler and Colby jokingly called “grow-dozers”, as many of them were owned by the men who worked in the many pot farms that littered the hills these days. Colby pulled up next to one of the pumps and killed the engine.<br />
<br />
“Wait here,” he said, before popping the trunk and stepping out of the car, leaving Tyler to contemplate the strange feeling of compulsion that came over him whenever the man gave him an order. Colby fumbled around in the trunk for a moment before climbing back into the car with a pair of black socks. “Here you go, little buddy.” He held them out to Tyler.<br />
<br />
“Uh, thanks.” Tyler took them and looked down at his crotch. The healthy bulge he’d known since puberty was now gone. A moment of silence for my lost dick, Tyler thought, wincing a bit at the memory. He unrolled the socks and stuffed them down his underwear, arranging them around his cocklet, which was beginning to get hard, for some reason.<br />
<br />
“No, you gotta make it look like this,” Colby said, cupping his head around the tubular bulge that stretched his trunks. Tyler pulled and adjusted the wooly mass in his boxers until Colby gave him the thumbs up. “That’s it. You’d almost fool me, small-dick.” Tyler moaned and felt his cocklet leak precum into its wooly prison. “And you owe me a new pair of socks.” He said, before stepping out of the car. <br />
<br />
Tyler followed behind him as they entered the quaint little corner store. A man in a white butchers apron was busy assembling sandwhiches at the deli while two other tall men stood by counter, chatting up the young woman running the register. One of them turned to the side to look at something and Tyler’s eyes widened when he saw the massive lump lurking underneath the dirty denim of his overalls. The man noticed Tyler and Colby approaching the deli counter; he sized them both up but didn’t say anything. The two men continued talking to the cashier while the cook at the counter took their sandwich order. <br />
<br />
“And for you?” The man barked, his voice deep and intimidating. A few weeks ago Tyler wouldn’t have thought much of the man’s tone. But his deep voice and the expectant look he worse on his bearded face made Tyler’s heart flutter and his dicklet harden. He noticed the man had to haunch over the counter a bit, his bulge pressing against his white apron so far that it was almost getting in his way. <br />
<br />
“Oh, uh. Roast beef….” Tyler recited his favorite sandwich order. The man grunted a thanks and handed him a ticket. <br />
<br />
“Still hungry?” Colby joked, knuckling Tyler in the shoulder.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, I had a small lunch,” Tyler quipped back, making Colby silently guffaw in disbelief.<br />
<br />
The two growers stepped away from the counter when Tyler and Colby approached the counter. The girl’s eyes brightened when she saw Colby, and she even spared a appreciative look for Tyler. He stood to the side while Colby paid; he muttered “aw, shucks” responses as the woman shamelessly flirted with him, but didn’t seem to show much of an interest in return. Tyler wasn’t feeling anything either; he’d noticed that these last few days. With each passing inch it seemed, Tyler felt less of an attraction to women as his thoughts turned to hard cocks, heavy balls, and the promising meal they could deliver.<br />
<br />
They sat down at one of the little tables while they waited. The two groers grabbed their sandwiches and walked out the door. Tyler was careful to watch them both as they walked; the man’s friend was also packing a prodigious bulge beneath his dusky work pants. Colby followed Tyler’s line of sight and chuckled. <br />
<br />
“Jeez, you really are hungry, small-dick.”, he said.<br />
<br />
“Shut up, not here!” Tyler snapped in a hushed tone.<br />
<br />
“Lighten up, little buddy,” Colby said, still grinning. “I guess I need to start really packing on the carbs, if I’m gonna be feeding my little buddy on the regular.”<br />
<br />
“Its funny you say that, becaue I think I could taste whatever you ate on your…” Tyler leaned forward to say, in a quieter tone, “cum.”<br />
<br />
Colby looked bewildered. “Really? What could you taste?”<br />
<br />
Tyler thought about it. “Something that reminds me of breakfast? Eggs and Toast? But also spicey. Like, habanero spicey.”<br />
<br />
Colby laughed. “Yeah, I love spicey food. I ate a lot of it down in Mexico.” His eyes perked up when he noticed the cook beckoning to them from behind the counter to get their order. “And I had eggs and potatoes for breakfast.” He left the table and returned a moment later with their food.<br />
<br />
Tyler unwrapped his sandwich and took a bite; the bread, the cheese, the meat, all of it taste like wet nothing as he chewed it in his mouth. Even the texture was off-putting. Tyler reached for a napkin and politely spat it out, frowning as he wadded it up and tossed it to the side.<br />
<br />
“No good?” Colby said, after swallowing his first bite. <br />
<br />
“Tastes like wet paper,” Tyler confirmed, wrapping the sandwich up. <br />
<br />
“All fun aside, dude, I’m sorry. I know roast beef and provolone is your favorite.” Colby took another big bite.<br />
<br />
“Its all good. Maybe you can order my favorite next time and treat me,” Tyler said, looking down through the table towards Colby’s crotch.<br />
<br />
“I’m more of a turkey-and-swiss kind of guy. But I’ll make an exception for you, little buddy.” Colby grinned. <br />
<br />
Tyler sat and stared out the window while Colby wolfed down his sandwich. The man even helped himself to Tyler’s uneaten sandwich, but Tyler could only be impressed and frankly a little turned on at the sight of his friend’s ravenous hunger. After Colby had eaten everything, they stood up and made for the door. They hopped into Colby’s little beater and sped off back to the river so that Tyler could pick up his car.<br />
<br />
“Omph,” Colby groaned and burped. “I think I ate too much. On the other hand, there’s gonna be a bigger dinner waiting for you tonight, little buddy.”<br />
<br />
“Good thing too,” Tyler said. “Mom’s out of town and dad hates to cook. It was gonna be take out and TV dinners all week anyway.”<br />
<br />
“I’m sure your dad would make you a nice, home-cooked meal if you asked,” said his saucy friend.<br />
<br />
Tyler groaned and punched his friend on the shoulder, even though his cocklet throbbed at the memory of his bare-chested father in the kitchen this morning. “No thanks, asshole. You’re my only feeder until I figure this thing out.”<br />
<br />
Colby slowed down as they approached Tyler’s car. “What time should I come over tonight?” he asked, as Tyler clambered out of the car.<br />
<br />
“I dunno, like, seven? I’ll text you, buddy,” he replied.<br />
<br />
“Alright, little buddy. And, hey! Don’t spoil you’re appetite!” he said with a grin before speeding off down the road.<br />
<br />
Tyler flipped him off but smiled to himself as he walked back to his truck. He felt elated and excited, like he had set up a date. He opened his car door and was surprised to find a note laying on his seat. He grabbed it; it was a short message, hastily scrawled on an old strip of paper, that read, ‘Be seeing you, short-dick.’</p>
