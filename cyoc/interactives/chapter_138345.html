<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Emily was led to the Manager’s Office, it soon dawned on her that they were not taking the quickest route.  Indeed, it seemed the FarmazooCo Security Agent was making a point of taking their time, the ‘why’ eluded her.  <br />
<br />
But not said Security, or any other employees watching them pass by.  <br />
<br />
From the moment the march began, so did Emily’s punishment for her actions.  Ears stretched, brown hairs coating them while they climbed up her head.  Nose widened, flattened, merged into the elongated upper jaw the same brown as her ears.  Hair now a long, still-wide mane of jet-black running down her head and neck, matching tail pushing down below her skirt where her underwear had been pushed free.  Feet clopping on the hard ground, footwear lost and unneeded for her hard hooves.  Dark brown fur all over, save for a white stripe down her black-ended muzzle.  <br />
<br />
And growing larger, heavier with each step.  A clear visual warning to the other employees who might harbour second thoughts about the new partnership that any effort to undermine it would not only go unnoticed, but unpunished too.  <br />
<br />
Not that the customers would pay any heed, affected as they were by FarmazooCo’s machinations, all they passed showing animalistic traits to one degree or another.  Notable ones - to Emily - being a rather burly topless wolf-lady, clad in a too-tight pair of denim jeans and knee-height heeled boots, making an already-futile beeline for the ladies room.  An open shirt-wearing orange-and-black tiger-man - more tiger by now - making advances on a less-advanced tan-furred lioness-lady.  And a very anthropomorphic, muscular, and naked butterscotch-yellow and white horse-man carrying a few items passed them just as they entered the Manager’s Office.  <br />
<br />
“Wait here.”  Having been led to an empty waiting room, there was little for Emily to do but worry about what they would do to her.  <br />
<br />
After some pacing around, she grew weary of the wait, deciding to sit it out and try to think about how she would get out of this situation.  <br />
<br />
“Whoa!”  Misjudging the distance, she’d near-fallen right down, the impact not just making the seat groan audibly, but jolting and jostling her massive, heavy breasts painfully, forcing her to grab them for support.  “Huh?”  Emily realised something was seriously off, namely that her hands were currently all that supported her breasts, nothing between her hands and breasts.  <br />
<br />
It was only now that Emily really looked at herself, and saw what she’d become.  Heavy muscle hidden by brown fur, clothes shredded to almost nothing, and then nothing when she twisted to see her tail swishing under the scraps of blouse that rested behind her.  The equine head staring back at her in the mirror, the final confirmation, that she now perfectly resembled, a large, powerfully-built, brown-and-black, six-foot-four anthro horse.  <br />
<br />
Stumbling back, a lack of coordination causing Emily to trip over herself, scooting back to the opposing wall, propping herself back to sitting, mind practically numbed in an effort to maintain some semblance of operation.  As such, she found herself staring dumbly down her new form, focused on her wet crotch, down to her hoofed feet that didn’t quite want to stay on the floor.  <br />
<br />
She would never know how long she spent there, gawking over herself, before she was finally broken from her non-thoughts by<br />
<br />
“Alright.  Boss’s ready to see you now.”  The same security agent who’d brought her here, no doubt witnessed everything, called out.  <br />
<br />
Somehow managing to react, Emily was able to slowly rise up, and shuffle through a small corridor, a single door leading to her fate.  <br />
<br />
“Enter.”  A coarse yet feminine voice firmly called through the speaker when Emily approached, a click indicating the locks retracting.  <br />
<br />
On the surface, it looked like any other office, albeit one that had some serious money put into it.  A massive mahogany desk in front of her, two massive screens set to the sides, an immense leather chair between them, flanked by rows of cabinets.  Thick carpet throughout, and plants everywhere.  <br />
<br />
“Take the seat to your left.”  That same voice commanded, the tone brokering no room for argument.  <br />
<br />
Taking the order as meaning the wide couch, Emily took the ‘offered’ seat and waited for the FarmazooCo Boss to face her.  It was a long minute, seemingly busy with another task before leaving her desk.  Delivering one more shock for her in the process.  <br />
<br />
As inhuman as Emily herself currently was.  Coated in tawny fur, more a tan-white at  the front though.  Her mammaries more than twice her own in size in spite of being a few inches shorter, and not so much (but still notable) muscle on her.  Whiskered, feline face - Cougar if Emily had to guess.  <br />
<br />
Hidden behind a pair of leopard-print high heels.  And nothing else.  <br />
<br />
“Now then, Ms Stanford.”  She began, taking her seat opposite Emily, legs intentionally spread with the confidence of one who had been that way for a long time.  “It has been brought to my attention, that you were violating the terms of your new contract, efforting to send people away from these stores.”  She began, green-gold eyes alternating between a file in her hand, and Emily.  <br />
<br />
And Emily herself unable to respond, everything that had happened overwhelming her mind, only able to look at the Cougar ahead and listen, and not much else.  <br />
<br />
“You should consider yourself fortunate, that this is a first offence warning.”  She pressed on.  “In addition to serving as a warning to the rest what such action will result in.”  <br />
<br />
“Now, as for the penalty.  You will be kept as you currently are, for as long as I see fit, and return to the Mall floors.  I expect you to assist the, ‘customers’, in any way they need it, and without hesitation.  At day’s end, you will be on cleanup duty, then report to the FarmazooCo Offices where new quarters will be assigned to you.”  She paused to note something down before adding.  “Now, any questions?”  <br />
<br />
It took Emily a moment to realise she’d been asked a question, but finally she managed to stutter.  “M-my uni-f-f-form?  Wh-what?”  <br />
<br />
“Oh?  That?  I know how much your kind loves to cover up Ms Stanford, so as part of your punishment, you’ll have to make do without.”  She let slip a major hint about her  origin as she rose and approached Emily, not that she was in any state to pick up on it.  “A new tag will be made an issued later, now, return to work.  And let’s not have this meeting again.”  <br />
________________<br />
<br />
Once Ms Stanford had left, she was free to focus on other matters, namely keeping a watch on how events were progressing.  From her desk, the cameras granted her a spectacular view of the going-ons within the Mall.  <br />
<br />
The tiger and lioness she’d spied earlier had since moved to one of the many diners, still blissfully unawares, still being changed.  <br />
<br />
Elsewhere a thick bear in an open fur coat was making for the new cinema with a number of others, breasts swaying from side to side with each step.  <br />
<br />
One note of concern, however, was by a now-closed ladies bathroom - even if it wouldn’t be needed soon enough - where a partially affected wolfess had fled to.  And why she’d been forced to send Diego out to deal with her right before she had to deal with Ms Stanford.  <br />
<br />
Unfortunately, the methods of FarmazooCo weren’t 100% effective.  A very select few stubbornly immune to the hypnotic effects, and they just had to have one such individual on the Grand Opening.  <br />
<br />
She would have sent additional security had the bathroom door not opened on her monitor, Diego guiding the wolf-woman to a special room set aside for such eventualities.  The denim gone, if not the boots.</p>
