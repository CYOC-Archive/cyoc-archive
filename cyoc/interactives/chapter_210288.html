<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Damn heat cycle,&quot; the Kitsune thought as she sat back down with Jeff&#39;s laptop and turned her attention to the computer programme running on it, but found it difficult to concentrate because of the demands of her body.<br />
<br />
She understood there was a few ways to deal with it, one being to use the programme to turn it off. But, from a biological standpoint, she had no idea what would happen if she did take such a course of action. Feeling curious, she clicked on and brought up that titbit of information, and wasn&#39;t able to tell if there&#39;d be any repercussions if she forced her body out of its heat cycle, but did notice that she wasn&#39;t supposed to be having it at the time she was. Finding this odd, and wondering why, she searched for a reason as she adjusted things on her profile. After some fiddling about, and not discovering why, she settled on making it so that she&#39;d have her heat cycle once a year, like a normal fox, but that it&#39;d be in mid to late autumn, and that, if she became pregnant, she&#39;d carry low, not show, and give birth to a litter of two to three kits in mid-to-late spring.<br />
<br />
About to click on the option to accept all changes, she hesitated. Finding herself not so much questioning what she was about to, as she was certain she was making the right choice, the Kitsune found herself asking herself if there was any other matters of importance that needed to be addressed. Thinking carefully, she glanced over at the plush, thought about what she&#39;d seen, and compared herself to the naked human she saw as they&#39;d transformed.<br />
<br />
She didn&#39;t want to be human, that she felt was obvious, much in the same way she saw and felt it was evident she didn&#39;t want to me male. Yet, she felt there was some things humans had she thought might be useful. Mulling over what she had observed about Penny, and what her improved knowledge told her about humans, struggling to keep herself from masturbating to ease the sexual need that was threatening to engulf her as she did so, the Kitsune soon had an idea of what else to alter about herself. Pulling up information about her teats, she removed two, as she now saw only a need to have four at the max. Finishing with that, she increased the top two to a double A cup, whilst the two below she increased to a triple A cup. Making this the norm for her species, she upped her height for when she stood on two legs to three foot seven, and after some consideration, made this the max height females reached as she set the max height for males of her species at three foot even.<br />
<br />
Finished with that, and finding it was getting harder and harder to ignore her swollen, needful sex, that if she didn&#39;t do something soon, she’d either start to jill off or call out for a male until one answered, she tapped on the icon to accept changes. A burning, itching sensation washed over her body and she was forced out from under the shelf she sat under. Dropping to all fours, she spread her back legs and held her tail in a way to indicate she was ready for a male&#39;s dick to be thrust into her slick, waiting female slit. Her heat cycle spiking as her teats changed numbers and size, she was unable to stop herself as she called out for another fox to come satisfy her. Embarrassed by the feral urges that had come over her, though unsure why she should feel so, the Kitsune shook herself the same way she&#39;d do so if she was wet as, with a series of cracks, her size shot up from the just shy of three foot to that of three foot seven. Everything happening within a matter of a couple minutes, she was relieved when the all the sensations, particularly the one that marked her hear cycle, began to dissipate, and adjusting her stance after a bit, she forced herself up on two legs and looked down.<br />
<br />
Two, firm, pert mounds now dominated the upper part of her chest, and when she cupped them, she was surprised to find how sensitive they were to touch, as well as the fact that she now had erect nipples. Touching the two smaller ones below, and finding them the same as the top two, she lowered her paw-like hand and wondered if she should cover herself like a human. Deciding after a moment that the fur she had was good enough, she sat back down in front of the laptop.<br />
<br />
Relief at how her privates felt when they came in contact with the linoleum floor, that there was nothing of what she&#39;d felt before, the Kitsune permitted herself a fox-like smile before she focused her attention on the programme. Typing commands, altering things here and there about herself, such as her age, five, she then did a bit of wrangling so that for every five years she aged, ten years would pass for a human, and that her max age would be about forty-five to fifty, or ninety to a hundred in human years. Making sure it was all set to permanent and that it&#39;d be the norm for her species, she didn&#39;t hit the option to confirm her choices, as she made a couple more changes, including giving herself and other of her species a hyoid bone.<br />
<br />
With a quick strike before she could change her mind, the Kitsune grimaced as discomfort rippled through her body. Forced up onto four legs, she found most of it a pressure inside her head, as well as in her throat, just below her jaw. And as it grew, she was soon unable to stop herself from starting to cough after some time. And with each hark, the sounds she uttered changed subtly from those of a fox until they sounded eerily like words.<br />
<br />
The alterations taking longer than the ones she&#39;d previous forced upon herself, the Kitsune was again relieved when the discomfort faded, then vanished. Standing up on two legs, she internally took a check of herself, and found she didn&#39;t feel any different. Opening her muzzle, she tried to talk, but found it was difficult, as she had no experience in doing so, and that she kept slipping back into the normal sounds a fox would make. Figuring she&#39;d get better the more she practiced, she looked at the laptop and the plush. Thinking now was the time to do something about the transformed human, she also felt there was one more thing she needed to do. Exiting the closet, she stood in the kitchen, sniffing and listening to the human house. Finding it was still empty, that what she mostly smelled was the mess she&#39;d made, she set about first cleaning it up.<br />
<br />
When she had completed the minor chore, the Kitsune put away the chemicals and rags, and set about to search the house. Collecting every single remote, mobile and landline phone, as well as a number of gadgets from the bedrooms, and any tools she could find, she returned to the closet. Sitting down, ignoring the computer, she proceeded to take everything she&#39;d collected apart. Hotchpotch and MacGyvering things back together, it took her some time to get the things to go the way she wanted, and had to every so often go back to the programme and give herself further knowhow. Through trial and error, she soon had two things that looked like might be remotes, with each having a display screen and a USB port.<br />
<br />
Satisfied with this, she moved onto the next phase. Creating a OS system from the ground up she soon found wasn&#39;t at all easy, and it again took her a number of trials and errors before she had the two remotes working and willing to accept what she wanted of them, as well the one programme she intended to put on them. Turning her attention back to the Chronivac, she started typing, copying, and building two profiles from scratch. When they were as complete as she felt they&#39;d be, with almost all of what she&#39;d created for herself added to them, she hooked up the remotes, prayed what she planned would work, and proceeded to download a copy of the Chronivac into each one, designating one as she did for males of her species and the other for females. Completing this, she turned her attention to the plush, and thought over what to do with it and the other human.<br />
<br />
The simplest solution she believed was to return them to their human form. But unsure if the programme would be able to effect the rabbit if it wasn&#39;t even in the vicinity of the laptop, she worried her lower lip with her sharp teeth as she worked over the problem before her. Deciding after some time to take a risk, she started to type in commands into the programme.<br />
<br />
Penny&#39;s profile being the easiest to alter, she scanned the plush, entered a timer to turn it back into the girl after forty minutes, with the three changes she added was that the girl wouldn&#39;t have wings, her ovaries would produce the ova of a powerful owl, and that she&#39;d have no memory of the computer and the programme on it. Satisfied with this, she hit save, made the changes permanent, and that only she, the Kitsune, would be aware of them, and that the girl would be slightly confused at first because of a large amount of missing time since she&#39;d come over with her friend.<br />
<br />
After she was done with all that, she turned to Lisa&#39;s profile. Finding it would be the hardest to alter, she set about remaking who the human was. Renaming them Rick, she made them male, fourteen, like their friend Penny, gave them short, dark brown hair, dark brown thin eye brows, and no other hair on their body. Shifting their dick and balls to human, she gave them a set that&#39;d be a smidge larger than normal, made sure it&#39;d always be that way, and, after a bit of thought, gave them horse sperm to shoot when they jacked off or had sex with a woman. Checking all the parameters, she set the changes to occur fifty-five minutes after she hit the command to accept changes, set it as permanent, that the only one aware of the changes would be her, the Kitsune, and that, like her friend, she&#39;d be baffled by the large amount of missing time. Typing in a few more options, most of which would change the girl’s reality to a boy’s reality, she didn&#39;t hit the option to accept just yet as she entered in a third timer that would delete the programme on the laptop in about twenty minutes.<br />
<br />
Certain she&#39;d done the right thing, the Kitsune moved the plush over to where the clothes had fallen to the floor. Returning to the closet, she collected the tools and remotes she&#39;d built, shoved the computer under the bottom shelf so that it was against the wall and wouldn&#39;t be found right away, and hitting the command key to accept all changes, she shut the closet. Prowling through the house, she found a small backpack to store the things she planned to take with her in, took some food from the fridge, and with one final look at the kitchen and the rest of the house, she turned and set out. Travelling in the direction Penny had flown earlier, alternating between going on two legs and four, the Kitsune transformed foxes until, two states over and in a secluded valley Penny had flown over, the Kitsune brought her people, now numbering close to around six hundred, to their new home.<br />
<br />
On the kitchen floor, the plush remain undisturbed. Inside the closet, the computer experienced another glitch and the numbers on the counters became skewed. The timer to deletion shifted to closer to sixty, whilst Penny&#39;s dropped to around twenty-nine and her friend&#39;s changed to the mid-thirties. When the first clock finished out, Penny&#39;s mind was the first to transform. Becoming aware, going from the state she was in, she couldn&#39;t understand why she was unable to do anything, feel anything. But as she changed from a plush to a human, her priorities changed and as she forgot about what she&#39;d been, she found herself more concerned with the fact that she was naked. Grabbing at her clothes, wondering where her cami was, she put them on, then went to look for Rick.<br />
<br />
Outside and toward the back of the yard, huddled inside a comfortable burrow he&#39;d dug for himself, the rabbit twitched his nose, and suddenly was overcome with the need to flee. His primitive brain screaming of danger, he found himself frozen in place as a strange sensation washed over him. Burning, itching, often painful, he doubled in size as fur regressed, ears shortened, front legs morphed into arms, and with a very human like scream, he forced himself to stand as he went from four-legged to two-legged.<br />
<br />
Dirt showered down around him as he grew in size until he stood around five-foot seven and in a rather shallow hole in the backyard. Brain and mind evolving from that of a rabbit to that of a fourteen year old boy, Rick stared blankly, unconcerned for the moment that he was as nude as the day he&#39;d been born, trying to sort things out. Unaware that his confusion was shared by Penny, the one and only girl he hung around with, he tried to suss out why he was standing a hole in the yard behind his place. Finding the last thing he remembered was coming home with Penny before they decided where to go next, his thoughts leapt, &quot;I hope my brothers don&#39;t see me out here like this,&quot; and stepping out of the hole, he headed first into the house and to his room, which until moments ago, had been the room of a fourteen year old girl. Pulling on a pair of underwear, jeans, socks, a shirt, and his sneakers, he glanced about his room, feeling still like he had missed something. Shaking his head, he left his room, went to see if Tyler or Jeff was home, wrinkled his nose in disgust at the stench of his older brother&#39;s room, and finding not even their parents home yet, he went to look for Penny, hoping she could help him make sense of what had happened, finding her eventually a block away and sitting on the curb, a befuddled look on her face.<br />
<br />
Inside the kitchen closet, the last timer counted down. As it reached zero, the virus within the software caused the screen to blink and take on the sideways, slanted look before it flickered back to normal. Within the Chronivac, Tyler, Lisa, and Penny&#39;s profile was deleted without any change, whilst Jeff&#39;s was opened, something seemed to click, and then the programme glitched. A screen pulled up and a new counter appeared, confirming that the software would be deleted and that if the user wished to change their mind, now was the time to do so. When no such command was entered, the box vanished, another appeared, and with moments, the programme had been scrubbed fully from the laptop, which would remain forgotten underneath the shelf.</p>
