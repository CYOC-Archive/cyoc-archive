<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Care for some saki?&quot; Julio asked constructing some out of atoms in the air.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nice try.&quot; The kitesune Keiko smirked. <br />
<br />
&quot;It's -really- good.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I was sober my entire time as a human male, a foxy blow up doll, and I figure being dry <br />
as a kitesune would make it a three in a row streak.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You can't blame me for trying, turn about IS fair play.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Granted.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Care for a soda instead?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;HA! Don't try to trick a trickster. You'll always end up tricked.&quot;<br />
<br />
++++++++++<br />
<br />
Tamthis felt odd, and had felt odd for the majority or entirety of the day, distant feeling of <br />
his spare body being out there -somewhere-, had just up and -vanished- it wasn't like his <br />
spare body had died, or been destroyed, but had simply ceased, to exist! That should have <br />
been impossible. Unless the evil dijinn had destroyed her. Well, just one more reason for <br />
Tamthis to deliver justice to them when the enemy came to their gates. Tamthis was <br />
already thinking of some rather clever ways to punish the dijinn came storming their gate <br />
and walls. The idea that the dijinn might destroy his city at a distance didn't even cross his <br />
mind. Not that it was likely anyway, with djinn being more than willing to get onto the <br />
hands on approach when needed to deliver the hurt to those they were allowed to  vent <br />
their frustration on.  Blasting someone to atoms, turning them to glass then hitting them <br />
with a really big hammer, or turning their flesh into Earth worms, was just so much <br />
satisfying when done face to face. <br />
<br />
Tamthis however would see none of these evils visited upon his city, the capital of a <br />
kingdom of the desert kitesune reborn again seeking to claim only what was taken from <br />
his kind several thousand of years ago. Grudges do NOT fade. Humans should feel <br />
honored that Tamthis was seeking to uplift them to such a superior state rather than <br />
chasing the trespassers off his land. He was justified. <br />
<br />
++++++++<br />
<br />
'Justified? Of course we are justified. How could we not be justified? We are bringing peace <br />
and brotherhood to the entirety of the arabian world, and we're allowing these people to <br />
remain and live within the land that was historically ours to begin with anyway...'  <br />
Alexandra thought seeing Samir's family become just another bunch of foxes in the city of <br />
Karthis happily carrying out their programmed roles. And she had said as much to her <br />
sister who now insisted her name was Kyriel. <br />
<br />
Kyriel herself, turned away from Alexandra in disgust. Her own person Alexandra may <br />
have been becoming,  but Alexandra had brought Kather's propaganda hook line and <br />
sinker. 'Another small fact,' She thought, 'There's no way she's going to think something <br />
negative about the man of her dreams.' <br />
<br />
Of course the real 'man of her dreams' was a social outcast who found short term solace <br />
in the art he skimmed from a glowing screen in a dark room shifting through the yiff and <br />
yaoi for artistic nudity in all it's form. An underachiever who had no one to blame but <br />
himself, and dearly prayed for the inspiration he needed to leave his life of short term self <br />
indulgences behind but never came.   Yes, Alexandra was very very happy that those <br />
nightmares were not real. <br />
<br />
Alexandra didn't know if her master would truly appreciated her devoted service or not, <br />
she had obeyed his commands to the letter and had returned with forces to dethrone the <br />
usurper Tammia.... She only hoped he wouldn't be mad that she failed to bring the aid of <br />
the 10,000 dijinn army as instructed. She would accepted any punishment he gave her if <br />
that was the case. It was her favored dream to be his new queen, but if she could be <br />
besides him even as a lowly servant, that would still be better than being without him. <br />
<br />
Kyriel looked at Alexandra a second time, and this time, looking at her with her spiritual <br />
senses, and saw Alexandra for what Alexandra's situation truly was... Alexandra wasn't <br />
evil, or controlled, not anymore, she had simply lost her way. And Kyriel realized looking at <br />
Alexandra's spiritual aura... Alexandra did honestly want to save Karther.<br />
<br />
'Though it's not really the kind of saving that Karther needs.' Kyriel thought. 'I'm not sure <br />
if Karther -can- be saved. T' saw Karther as having made his own choices and would need <br />
to face the consequences of those choices. Janice of course had been Karther's slave and <br />
wanted nothing short but the greatest punishment possible for him.' Kyriel however... <br />
looked at these memories with a odd sense of objectivity. 'Still... aren't I supposed to save <br />
anyone that I can? Isn't that the point of what I am? I wonder, -can- you save someone <br />
like Karther? Then again, I won't know unless I even try... maybe this situation will have <br />
made him more able to appreciate what he's done to others... okay maybe not... but <br />
maybe it'll at least have trained him in being not so reckless and greedy. I can hope, no, <br />
PRAY.' <br />
<br />
Of course, all of this was meaningless. <br />
<br />
For in the harem, there was no Karther or anything that even remotely resembled him. <br />
Alexandra had been confused about that, then her entire world came crashing down <br />
around her ears. <br />
<br />
Two tailed kitesune had Karther's female forms face and shape... but that was all. Her <br />
body language, her expressions, her style of speech, her attitude, -and if Alexandra had <br />
the sense for it- her spiritual aura, bore no resemblance to the prince of all desert <br />
kitesune. <br />
<br />
++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;So how is it?&quot; 'Shaykh Abu Isa' asked Kyriel looking down at the city that seemed to be <br />
expanding in size as it devoured more people before their very eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;They're all like drones in an insect colony. Or maybe even figures in a painting, this place <br />
is growing larger but... everything feels frozen, I'm wondering if anyone here is even going <br />
to age! Everyone here reminds me of how Tammy and the others where when Jake was <br />
transported to Karther's harem.  UGH! It's all so confusing, it's like the spiritual impression <br />
left by Karther or Tammy was that of a totally deluded lunatic.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Er, ya, that too, but I kinda meant how does it feel to be, well, to be you.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Huh? Oh. Right. I don't feel weird in the sense that my soul feels unnatural. This body's <br />
arms and legs are -just- a pair of arms and legs, like T' saw them, unlike Jake/Janice and <br />
most other mortals who can't separate between their bodies and themselves.  I can think <br />
things rationally and logically like Jake/Janice, but like T I can recognize the limits of my <br />
own perceptions.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Whole greater than the sum of it's parts eh?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You could say that I guess. I have this sick feeling of dread though, Jasmine pushed the <br />
clock foreword a lot farther than was really safe, thus resulting in the need for me to be <br />
born... I just have this awful feeling something that something going to happen to cause <br />
our hour to become three minutes. And I'm going to need every second of this hour to <br />
prepare... to save Tommy, and Karther.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And if you don't get that hour?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We quite simply, ****ing, dame LOSE. No questions asked. Then the dijinn come in and <br />
bring down the thunder, possibly turning Mecca into glass in the splash damage, and <br />
humanity continues living in ignorance and fear and being basically sheep for wolves with <br />
the shepherds wasting half their energy keeping the wolves out of the sight of the sheep.&quot;  <br />
<br />
&quot;Well then... count on this kitesune to pull out every trick he has to make sure you GET <br />
your hour... you can count on me... sister.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;All right... brother.&quot; <br />
<br />
+++++++++<br />
<br />
It had been voted on before running into Samir's family that two sisters each would deal <br />
with saving Lucy and Natalie. Vicki and Erica would deal with Lucy, while Luna and Lisa. <br />
That was assuming they got to pick and chose their enemies at any rate.  The shiva vixens <br />
together would still be no match for match for one Angel, even a crash course trained one <br />
and would only prove deadly if they took advantage of a nasty distraction.  Jasmine and <br />
Kyriel would deal with Tamthis (and Karther as Jasmine would continue to say on the way <br />
over). <br />
<br />
However, the spiritual senses of the four sisters, all told them that someone had beaten <br />
Jasmine to the punch. Jasmine herself was not dim to this fact, and her senses instantly <br />
went into overdrive trying to find Karther's real self that so obliviously hiding underneath <br />
this bubbly and perky persona, only to find nothing underneath except more of the same. <br />
A cheerful, somewhat ditzy, utterly innocent but utterly devoted to Tamthis kitesune <br />
vixen.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey.&quot; Kathy said looking at the six vixens still in their concealing arab dress opposed to <br />
her utterly revealing harem attire. &quot;You guys look kinda familiar, have we met?&quot; She asked <br />
without a trace of suspicion.<br />
<br />
Vicki moved first, almost a blur for a split seconds she was right next to Alexandra and <br />
applied her padded fingers to a pressure point on Alexandra's body (her nervous system <br />
still mostly primate), this was enough that Alexandra yelped for a moment but didn't say <br />
what she was about to say. <br />
<br />
Jasmine stood in front of the others and said, in a voice that almost forceful, &quot;No. I am <br />
very much certain that you madam, have never met any of us.&quot; In spite of what T' had <br />
thought of her, Jasmine was fully able to comprehend and grasp the facts when need be. <br />
<br />
&quot;Whao. Okay!&quot; Kathy nodded bobbing her head up and down almost. <br />
<br />
Thankfully the Shiva vixens had been rendered too automaton like to find anything about <br />
this odd. And Tamthis was pleased that his woman was quick to make friends with the <br />
wives of the sheik. <br />
<br />
No illusion spell had been placed on Alexandra to really hide her appearance, since after <br />
all, she had been planning on quickly making contact with Karther this whole time. But <br />
thankfully the veil hide her face well. And the four sisters had been transmuted so much <br />
from their species change and crash course, that idle minded Kathy could not be certain <br />
she recognized them. Even if she had spiritual senses she'd have been hard pressed to tell <br />
it was them without a close up look. As Jasmine was a new comer here, so thus had <br />
nothing to fear about being identified. <br />
<br />
Alexandra keeping her veil on, and barely listening to the angels saying Alex' was keeping <br />
hers on for health reasons (she'd be killed possibly if she was identified after all, which <br />
was very unhealthy).  Jasmine endured Kathy's games of playing with Jasmine's head hair <br />
with grinding teeth and clenched paws. Kathy was totally oblivious, and chatted on and on <br />
about how cute Tamthis was and how pretty the city was, and asking questions how cute <br />
their husband was. <br />
<br />
The four sisters, seeing the one they knew was once Karther but was now nothing at all in <br />
any way Karther, felt a slight sense of satisfaction, they wondered if Karther had been able <br />
to appreciate it. But while they weren't sorry for who it happened to, this change unnerved <br />
them, the persona wasn't buried, recolored, or covered up... it was just... GONE! Proof. <br />
'And... Tammy could do the exact same thing to us? No! We're angels now. Angels. No <br />
matter how much power she's absorbed she now powerful enough to screw with our souls <br />
now!' Luna thought. <br />
<br />
Vicki keep looking at Alexandra... and felt sorry for Karther's fate, ONLY because it hurt <br />
the poor vixen. 'Karther you... You escaped... a part of me is sorry I wasn't here to see it... <br />
another part is sorry that Alexandra's love never had a chance to save you.' Saving <br />
Karther... Vicki was surprised by her own thoughts. Then again, Karther was no longer the <br />
enemy. And it was improper to speak ill of the dead in the presence of their loved ones. <br />
<br />
Jasmine was angry, as far as he was concerned, this poetic justice meant nothing, as far as <br />
Jasmine saw it, Karther had escaped punishment perfectly, by taking the coward's way out. <br />
That SCUM! How dare he! How DARE he?! How dare he rob everyone he had wronged of <br />
personally delivering unto him -justice-?! <br />
<br />
Alexander sat in shell shock. Looking at this one who had to be her Karther, and yet was <br />
nothing like her Kather... 'She... she's happy... therefore... therefore this is right... but... <br />
but... Karther isn't... no! Karther is still in there! So he is the one that's happy! Of course! <br />
But... Karther would never act like...' Alexandra felt sick to her stomach. <br />
<br />
&quot;Can you undo the curse on him?&quot; She finally asked desperately of Lisa in a very VERY low <br />
whisper even fox ears couldn't pick up. Lisa very very VERY much wished she had asked <br />
anyone but her. Lisa didn't like hurting others, in any way, even with the truth now <br />
ingrained in her you couldn't always escape it, she still didn't like it. <br />
<br />
&quot;There's... nothing to undo... Karther is just... not there... there's nothing to bring out... <br />
there's nothing to invert... she's not even a female version of Karther's personality or <br />
mind... she's... a completely different person inside what was once Karther's body... he's <br />
just.. gone.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No...&quot; Alexandra whispered... she breathed in deep... Erica reacted faster and knocked her <br />
out quietly and swiftly and cleanly before Alexandra screamed 'NooooOOO!' at the top of <br />
her lungs. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh! Is she okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She's okay... she just... fainted... too much excitement seeing the big city.&quot; Vicki covered <br />
up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh! Okay!&quot; Kathy nodded content with the answer utterly. <br />
<br />
+++++<br />
<br />
'Kyriel.. Karther's dead.' Kyriel blinked, she hadn't expected that telepathic message from <br />
Vicki.</p>
