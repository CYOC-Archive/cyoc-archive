<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Will arrived back home and ran through the open front door. Slamming it behind her she fell on the bed and closed her eyes. Panting heavily, she wanted it all to be over, for it all to have been just a dream, but it wasn’t. She could feel the weight of her breast on her chest and her slim, smooth arms felt the softer bed sheets. She looked about her room and nearly screamed. The hot girls she’d had before hand were gone, replaced instead by a few famous boy bands and actors. Most of the skater stuff remained though but she wasn’t thinking straight enough to notice.<br />
<br />
She leapt up and ran over to the mirror, a stray hair falling in front of her face. “This is all just a dream” she repeated over and over to herself, but in the back of her mind she knew it wouldn’t help. The girl in front of her was cute. Soft skin, cute nose. The skater shirt and jeans made her look like Avril Lavigne and Will had to catch herself from admiring the look. It was then that, leaning over the desk and looking into the mirror, she spotted her cleavage. The shirt hung loose and she could see straight down it. <br />
<br />
“Holy shit” she said standing bolt upright and feeling them jiggle. She turned and walked away but she couldn’t help but stare at them. Pacing about they followed her and she was obsessed by them. Now, from a distance she turned to see her full body in the mirror. Her breast jutted out, a C cup probably, and her cute ass was just visible as the jeans and belt hung off her hips, lower than perhaps they should.<br />
<br />
Slowly she brushed a hair out of her eyes and gazed up and down the body of the very cute and attractive girl. The funny thing was that it still looked like him. If Will had had a sister she probably would have looked like he does now.<br />
<br />
She couldn’t help herself now, and slowly, her hand was raised from her side. The other soon joined it and they both hovered over the orbs. She poked them, and felt the sensitive skin of her new breast. “This can’t be happening” She mumbled to herself in her new feminine voice. She placed her hand firmly upon them now, lifting them, weighing them, and feeling how they moved. She had never experienced anything like this, and unlike Jess, had been given no memories to refer to. She was a guy trapped in a girl’s body. <br />
<br />
Taking a deep breath, she pulled the shirt rapidly over her head. Her breast jiggled as the shirt was thrown to wherever it would land and the cold air ran over her chest. She shivered and was excited by the sensation, watching, and feeling her nipples become hard. A hand probed one, pinching it to see what was happen and a jolt of electricity ran down her naked back. There was one thing though that she didn’t want to believe. <br />
<br />
She reached down and with minimal coaxing, pushed her jeans past her waist. Now free of the curves of her ass, they, along with the boxer shorts of old, fell to the ground in a heap and once again the cold air ran along her body. Her legs shivered but more importantly, the vision that greeted her in the mirror was the most frightening, and simultaneously magical she had ever seen.<br />
<br />
Her hairless pussy lay before her eyes, and she didn’t want to believe it. The mirror showed the girl before her squirming in the cold air, but she could feel it was her. The air ran over her folds and she could do nothing but admire it. She brought a hand down to it and felt the soft skin and moist cushion of flesh that surrounded her new womanly pride. Had she been a guy, and in some ways she still was, she’d have been utterly mesmerized by the feeling of the touch under her hands, but now she could feel the flesh as well.<br />
<br />
Will needed to know. She walked up the full length mirror, almost aroused by her own naked beauty walking sexily towards her.  Her hips swayed and breasts bounced and she knew that despite her old life, if she didn’t find a solution to this predicament then she’d be the object of virtually every boys affection. She lowered herself to the ground and widened her legs to get a better view of her new vagina. It was soft, and still pink, and Will sat and admired it for quite a length of time. It didn’t help that a few of the boy bands pictures were carefully positioned behind her in the reflection and Will wondered if it had been intentional. Certainly the ones on the ceiling above her bed served a purpose.<br />
<br />
Her hand drifted southwards, and she felt the shift of weight of her breasts as her muscles moved. It was odd to have all these thrilling new sensations. Her fingers paused, almost for dramatic effect, as Will decided whether or not to probe any further. Did she want to know? Did she care? Was she too scared to find out? Her hand seemed to then move for her as the fleshy mound was parted and the soft folds pushed to one size. The feeling of the air in her pussy set her off and the electric feeling returned to her spine. She felt the sensitive feeling of the exposed area, the pleasure of having it touched, and in the mirror she could see it all.<br />
<br />
The pink of the vagina and the experience brought forth a strange urge within her. Her finger began to probe her insides, pushing in, then rubbing the walls of her labia as it withdrew. The feeling was intense, arousing and her clitoris became visibly enlarged. Her thumb brushed against it and she let out a feminine squeal of pleasure. That was the tipping point and at this point there was no going back. Her hand began probing properly. The experimentation was over now and the finger that had entered before now began a rhythmical sawing. In and out, in and out, until it was gleaning with her new pussy liquids. Another finger soon joined it and together they explored every corner of her dar cave. Her thumb brushed and pinched her clit every so often, the sensation causing her to lose the strength in the arm that was propping her up. It didn’t matter now, as with her eys closed and a new hand free, she began to massage her soft breasts.<br />
<br />
She pinched her nipples and bit her lip to keep from making too much noise. The sensation was too much and the tingle erupted across her whole body. She wanted it to be over, wanted the extreme feeling to go away, but she couldn’t stop. Her fingers pumped deeper now, faster, pushing aside the now glistening folds of her pussy. Over and over the relentless rubbed her, and Will could swear she was about to go blind with ecstasy. She’d never experienced anything and the feeling was no over yet.<br />
<br />
Something deep was stirring within her, something she knew she needed, desperately wanted, but had never felt before. It slowly rose within her and desperate to feel it, she pumped and massaged herself harder. Harder and harder, she kept going, feeling whatever it was rising, bubbling to the surface. Her speed kept increasing. She relentless drove on. Faster and faster. It was almost there. And then it hit her.<br />
<br />
Her whole body was smashed as her first orgasm ripped through her. She pushed herself off the floor as she screamed loudly, for all to hear. Her juices erupted, coating her hands and sailing through the air to cover the mirror. The feeling was intense and nothing she’d ever experienced had come even close. She lay panting, unable to move a single muscle. What had happened to her. Why was she now a girl. All of these questions were gone as the glow of the orgasm and the lust for her body sat with her. It was amazing and the entire world was forgotten to her for that instant.<br />
<br />
But her world was shattered when there was a ring from down stairs. It was the doorbell and Will simply sat there debating what to do next, sweat pouring from her head.</p>
