<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Rick had always been a man of power. At 6&#39;5&quot; with bulging biceps and a broad chest, he towered over everyone.<br />
<br />
It was on a Saturday morning when Rick decided to stop by the local flea market. He had no particular reason to go, but something had drawn him there—maybe the smell of fresh air mixed with the sound of bartering and the occasional clink of coins. As he strolled past the rows of mismatched trinkets and antiques, a small wooden box caught his eye. It was tucked away under a rusted lamp on a weathered table, its lid slightly ajar.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, you looking for something unique?&quot; A gruff voice interrupted Rick’s thoughts.<br />
<br />
The old man behind the table had a wrinkled face and a gray beard that reached down to his chest. He seemed harmless enough, but there was a glint in his eye that made Rick pause.<br />
<br />
&quot;I’m just browsing,&quot; Rick replied, stepping closer.<br />
<br />
The man gestured to the box. &quot;I’ve got something special in there. Rings,&quot; he said with a grin. &quot;They&#39;re not your average trinkets. You won’t find anything like them anywhere else.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rick raised an eyebrow. &quot;Rings, huh? I’m not really in the market for anything flashy.&quot;<br />
<br />
The man chuckled. &quot;These ain’t flashy, son. They’re magic. Put ‘em on and your life changes forever. Trust me, they work wonders.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rick snorted, amused by the old man’s eccentricity. Magic rings? Really? But there was something about the rings that intrigued him. They weren’t shiny or polished like most rings he had seen. They were made of dull, tarnished metal with strange symbols etched into the bands.<br />
<br />
&quot;How much?&quot; Rick asked, half-joking but still curious.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fifty bucks,&quot; the old man replied.<br />
<br />
Rick hesitated for a moment, then shrugged. Fifty bucks wasn’t much for something this odd, and a part of him felt that he might as well give it a try. He had always enjoyed collecting strange and unique things. So, he handed over the money, grabbed the box, and made his way back to his truck.<br />
<br />
Later that day, Rick was at home, lounging in his favorite chair with the TV blaring in the background. His massive arms were crossed over his chest, and he looked every bit the part of a man who knew his strength. His son, Alex. was lounging on the couch across from him, eyes glued to his phone screen.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, Alex I almost forgot&quot; Rick said, looking over at his son. &quot;The new neighbor kid is coming over to play today.&quot;<br />
<br />
“Jimmy’s coming over? Ugh, Dad, no!” Alex groaned, flopping dramatically onto the couch. The 13-year-old rolled his eyes at his dad, a towering man with broad shoulders and biceps that strained against his T-shirt. “He’s, like, ten. And annoying.”<br />
<br />
“Too bad,” said his dad, Rick, with a shrug, crossing his massive arms over his chest. The motion only seemed to emphasize the size of his muscles, which Alex had long ago accepted were freakishly big for a guy who wasn’t a professional bodybuilder. Rick was a gym manager, and apparently, the job came with a strict policy of looking the part.<br />
<br />
“I’m not hanging out with him,” Alex muttered, glaring at the ceiling.<br />
<br />
Rick raised a thick eyebrow, his expression shifting to the stern look Alex knew all too well. “Jimmy’s new in the neighborhood and doesn’t know a lot of kids yet. You can be a good sport for one afternoon.”<br />
<br />
Before Alex could argue, Rick turned his attention to a small wooden box on the coffee table. He’d picked it up at a flea market earlier that day, muttering something about a “lucky find” when he got home. Alex had barely glanced at it, assuming it was another one of his dad’s weird collectibles.<br />
<br />
“Besides,” Rick added, “you might learn a thing or two about being a good host.” He opened the box, revealing two simple rings nestled inside. They didn’t look like much—just thin metal bands, one with a faint blue gemstone and the other with green.<br />
<br />
Alex frowned. “What are those?”<br />
<br />
“Don’t know,” Rick admitted with a grin, pulling out the blue-ringed one. “Guy at the flea market said they’re supposed to bring good luck or something. I figured, why not? Thought I’d try one on.”<br />
<br />
“Seems kinda lame,” Alex said, sitting up slightly.<br />
<br />
Rick chuckled, slipping the ring onto his thick index finger. “Maybe, but it’s better than sitting around complaining about Jimmy.”<br />
<br />
Almost immediately, something strange began to happen. Alex blinked, thinking his eyes were playing tricks on him, but there was no denying it—Rick’s massive frame seemed to shrink, his broad shoulders narrowing slightly.<br />
<br />
“Dad?” Alex said cautiously.<br />
<br />
Rick glanced at him, the faint smile on his face completely unfazed. “What?”<br />
<br />
“You, uh…” Alex trailed off as he watched Rick’s T-shirt, which usually fit snugly over his muscles, start to sag. His arms, once thick and veiny, were slimming down, his forearms losing definition.<br />
<br />
“What?” Rick asked again, this time in a slightly higher pitch.<br />
<br />
“Uh, Dad, you’re—”<br />
<br />
But Alex stopped himself. A mischievous grin crept onto his face as realization dawned. Whatever was happening to Rick, the guy clearly didn’t notice it.<br />
<br />
By now, Rick’s transformation was speeding up. His chiseled jawline softened, his features growing younger by the second. His gym-hardened chest flattened as his abs melted away. His legs, once thick and powerful, were now skinny and short, his jeans pooling awkwardly around his feet.<br />
<br />
Rick scratched the back of his head, oblivious to the way his hand looked comically large compared to his now much smaller body. “Alex, what’s with the weird look?”<br />
<br />
“I, uh…” Alex bit his lip to keep from laughing. “Nothing. You’re just… uh, looking different today.”<br />
<br />
Rick rolled his eyes, his voice now unmistakably that of a preteen. “Whatever. You’re weird, dude.” He reached for the TV remote, only to find his arm wasn’t long enough to grab it without scooting closer.<br />
<br />
Alex could barely contain himself. “Dude?” he echoed, grinning.<br />
<br />
Rick stood up—or tried to. His oversized clothes made it difficult, and he nearly tripped over his own jeans. Looking down, he finally seemed to notice something was off.<br />
<br />
“Huh,” he muttered, frowning. “Did I, uh… Did I get shorter?”<br />
<br />
Alex burst out laughing. “You think?”<br />
<br />
Rick glanced at himself, his frown deepening. “My clothes don’t fit…” He looked at Alex, his expression suddenly defensive. “Did you do something?”<br />
<br />
“Me? Nah, Dad. You’re just… I dunno, different now.”<br />
<br />
Rick didn’t seem to hear the word “Dad.” Instead, he furrowed his brow and said, “Why are you calling me that? You’re the older one here, duh.”<br />
<br />
Alex froze, his grin widening. “Wait, what?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah,” Rick said, his voice matter-of-fact. “You’re, like, thirteen. I’m, what, nine?”<br />
<br />
For a moment, Alex was speechless. Then he doubled over, laughing so hard he could barely breathe.<br />
<br />
“You’re—you’re nine!?” he wheezed.<br />
<br />
“Yeah,” Rick said, crossing his now-skinny arms and glaring up at him. “What’s so funny?”<br />
<br />
Alex wiped tears from his eyes. “Oh, man. This is too good.”<br />
<br />
At that moment, the doorbell rang.<br />
<br />
Alex leaned back against the couch, grinning from ear to ear. This was going to be the best afternoon ever.</p>
