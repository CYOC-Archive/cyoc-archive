<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">His larger heart, filled with the blood cells and DNA of a donkey, was beating faster. He&#39;s trapped in this unforseen &quot;room&quot; filled with mirrors. Trying to calm his own mind despite the rushing donkey blood and lingering hormones through his brain, he closed his eyes and started counting to ten slowly in his head.<br />
<br />
He finally was able to dominate the body of this beast with his mind and tame it for a bit. He opened his eyes to take stock of his situation. He started with the fact that he&#39;s a donkey right now, incapable of moving like a person. He knew all along that he was, but looking himself all over at all different angles, finally solidified that fact in his mind. <br />
<br />
He felt terribly ashamed and humiliated. Nowhere in his outside appearance, does he have a single part of him that resembles anything human, much less himself. He was a common African gray-haired donkey with a cross of black fur on his neck and back, and white fur on his underside. All members of this specific breed of donkey look exactly the same! Even the males and females look the same, save the nasty monstrosity attached to the undersides of giant male jacks like himself. He was no different from them, save his added weight and girth. If he saw a picture of himself as he now was and placed it in the middle of a herd of African donkeys, he would be unable to differentiate himself from the others. <br />
<br />
He then began to become aware of how every square inch of his body &quot;felt&quot; from his current perspective. Looking at his giant wide rounded rump with tail protruding, he could feel it there, rising up, mocking him. He felt his long ears, and could twitch them in different directions. He felt his legs and his hooves. He felt his extra-wide sides sticking out around his belly. He felt his strong jaw and long snout. He felt his donkey tongue. Realizing he has the tongue of a disgusting beast trapped in his mouth along with all of its sour saliva! The tongue and rotten saliva of a donkey. In his mouth! That he is swallowing! That he must swallow! That he&#39;s FORCED to swallow! <br />
<br />
He was a donkey. And now he truly knows what this means. He knew it before, but he was still himself internally. He still had his body image of a boy in his mind. But looking at himself, he realized all he would ever be is a just a dumb fat old lowly donkey from the human perspective. Just a dumb beast of burden only good for hauling around carts and plows. Only able to stand around on all fours and eat with his mouth.<br />
<br />
Speaking of eating, he was HUNGRY! But nevermind that right now.<br />
<br />
Now that he has a handle of his current situation and how shameful, humiliating and restrictive it is, he should at least try to get out of this mirrored box without breaking it apart. That way, at the very least, he could maybe try to get a shower. To at least turn it on and stand underneath the shower head as much as possible. Then spend the rest of his time in relative comfort until time is up. Being in a confined space, he could REALLY smell himself.<br />
<br />
He must have tripped something. Flipped a switch or pressed a button somewhere or something in order for this wall to come down on his left. Using the mirrors to scan all around himself  always noticing his donkey features so indisinguishing from all others of his current species on the planet, he was looking for something which he could press or switch. But his poor donkey near-sightedness wasn&#39;t much help. <br />
<br />
&quot;What happened just before it came down? Where and how was I standing? Well, I was standing in the current position I in now. Afterall, I don&#39;t exactly have much room to move here.&quot;<br />
<br />
The logical conclusion is that the activation switch must have been bumped by his clumsy body. Studying the shape of his body closely once more, he begins to move different parts of himself in different directions one by one. <br />
<br />
He used his rump to bump the mirrors on each side, and backed up and rammed his black butthole against the mirror behind him. Leaving a slimy dirty streak behind. He &quot;danced&quot; his hind legs around. He then swayed his body back and forth against both side mirrors. Nothing. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hhhmmmm…..it slid down right after I turned to check myself out using all three mirrors.&quot;<br />
<br />
He then used both front hooves and &quot;felt&quot; around. As much as he could &quot;feel&quot; anything through his thick, hard, blocky hooves. Each time he put one of his hooves down, it would make a &quot;clop&quot; sound on the hard tiled floor. <br />
<br />
Eventually, he heard a loud &quot;CLICK!&quot;, and the wall rolled back up! The rest of his parents&#39; bathroom appeared!<br />
<br />
He quickly scrambled out of there, shaking his head in a silly manner back and forth and snorting in glee. Much like a real donkey would do when pleased with something. <br />
<br />
That out of the way, he wandered over to the hot tub / shower combo his mom always luxuriated in. But not before getting one last look at his rear-end in the wall mirror now behind him in the alcove that had him trapped. His tail automatically rose into the air without any command from him, and shit began to drop. One by one. Plop! Plop! Plop! went a series of three piles of manure! <br />
<br />
&quot;Hheeerrrrggghhhh hhhaaaaeww!!!!&quot; he brayed in horrified dismay! <br />
<br />
&quot;Wtf!? That just rolled right out of me!&quot; <br />
<br />
His enhanced smell quickly got a waft of what his body had just done to betray him! It was manure, alright! Donkey-style manure! And it smelled like it too! Like a barnyard! But that wasn&#39;t all!<br />
<br />
Suddenly, his firehose-like dark penis came out of its home and let forth a firehose-like stream of dark yellow, almost greenish, strong odorific piss. It wasn&#39;t just a simple stream of piss either! Oh no! It was a gushing torrent. And it almost had a burning sensation coming out of his flat-headed inhuman grown ass donkey schlong! <br />
<br />
&quot;Hhheerrrgghhh hhhaawwww!? Hhheerrrgghhh hhhaawwww!? Hhhheeerrrrggghhh hhhaaaaww!!!&quot; he brayed in panic-driven dismay, shock, and horror. He had absolutely no control over that! His body just did that of it&#39;s own accord! <br />
<br />
As the pissed died down into a trickling stream; then a dripping leak; he looked at himself once more. He used his long neck to slowly look behind himself in a scared-induced denial of what just happened. Shamefully, he looked in the vanity mirror beyond his rump behind him. He saw a sterotypical ugly awkward donkey with a shameful droop to it&#39;s neck, with it&#39;s deep, puckered, black asshole with tail still raised, exposed to the world. <br />
<br />
&quot;Eeeerrggghhh hhhaawwww&quot; he said to himself plaintively. <br />
<br />
Ears flattened in submission, wanting to ball his eyes out, he slowly turned his long neck forward to face the shower again. He slowly and sadly approached. Resignedly, he took his snout, opened his mouth full of ugly, yellow-stained, half-rotten teeth, gripped the hot water handle then turned his head. The water spout to the tub began to pour water. He did the same for the cold water. <br />
<br />
Realizing how tremendously thirsty he was, and once again discovering his currently-occupied body&#39;s inability to produce any tears, he dunked his head under the warm, refreshing water as much as he was able. All he managed to do, was get his snout under. Immediately, water went bursting up through his huge new nostrils he never gave much thought about. Until now! <br />
<br />
Spluttering and sneezing, he backed out. &quot;Man, water up the nose burns!&quot; he thought to himself. But at least it got him out of his depressed state of mind.<br />
<br />
Still ravanously thirsty, he moved forward to put his snout underneath the faucet again, more carefully this time. <br />
<br />
Again, water came up his giant ass nostils! &quot;Haaaww! Hhhaawwww! HHHHHAAAAWWWW!!!&quot; he hacked. <br />
<br />
Shaking his head, he decided to come at a different angle this time. Turning his head sideways with his right cheek pointing down and his left cheek up, curling his fat black rubbery lips over his nostils, he opened his mouth wide and drew out his cottony dry tongue. Looking incredibly silly, he began lapping up the water like a mad man. Or rather, like a mad donkey. <br />
<br />
He stood there for a good solid ten minutes, just sucking as much water down his dry gullet as possible in as short amount of time as possible. It felt and tasted so good, he closed his eyes and drifted away in a hypnotic fashion. <br />
<br />
Finally beginning to feel full, he removed his head from under the tap, sneezing one last time and shaking his giant head. It&#39;s been ages since he last ate or drank anything. If only he could eat right now! But what, and how? <br />
<br />
&quot;The…...lawn?&quot; He thought. His depressing reality set in again. He&#39;s still a donkey. And he will have to feed himself like one. No human food for him!<br />
<br />
Once again, the thought of &quot;what if this were permanent?&quot; came unbidden to his mind. <br />
<br />
His dick came flopping out of its home yet again. <br />
<br />
&quot;No more pizza. No more sandwiches. No more hoagies. No more steak… meat…..I&#39;m now an herbivore. Strictly an herbivore! Herbivores are at the bottom of the food chain,&quot; he learned in science class a couple of years ago. <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not just lower than humans, I&#39;m also lower than many other beasts!&quot;<br />
<br />
These new thoughts both tormented, and made him horny. How many times can a male donkey ejaculate in 12 hours? (Well, 13 hours, and 15 minutes. It&#39;s now quarter after 1 in the morning, unbeknownst to Jeff the Nearsighted Horny Donkeyjack.)</p>
