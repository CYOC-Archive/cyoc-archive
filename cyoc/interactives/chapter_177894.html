<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">When Dayan got home, she didnt waste any time and pulled Mark out of her back pack and stood him up on her desk. She then took out of her doll collection a pair of heels, a string bikini, and a dress, which she proceeded to then dress him up in. Durring that, the dick up his ass had cum 3 times since he was first placed inside of her backpack. <br />
<br />
He could feel the decent amount of cum that was now stuck inside of him, as the cock was replaced by another dildo, although this one was seeming special in 2 ways. First, it was completely hollow, which let a cool draft flow up deep into his ass. This would be to handle his waste and make sure he was always clean and ready to be fuck at a moments notice. The other part was that it was so much wider than the cock or the plug had been. His asshole was being stretched to its limits and it hurt quite a bit.<br />
<br />
Everything about his body was not uncomfortable at best. Besides his painfully gamed asshole, the next thing which was causing him the most grief was his ankles. Dayan had not just placed him into just any kind of heels. No, she had specifically put ballet heels on him, causing his entire bodyweight to be placed onto his ankles and toes. His back was next then, as his posture was forced into an exaggerated arc that pushed forward his &quot;breasts&quot; while making his ass look even rounder and sexier. Dayan even then placed him down into a special stand, which clipped around his waste, keeping him standing and balanced on the heels. However it did not help to support his weight in the slightest. <br />
<br />
&quot;There, now you look like a proper girl, Mara. That is your new name by the way. Cute right? Can&#39;t have a cute doll named Mark afterall. Eww.&quot; Said Dayan outloud. If Mark, or rather, if Mara could still speak, he would have torn Dayan a new one. But with the dildo down his throat, he couldn&#39;t do anyhing but accept his new name. He knew escaping from them now, and especially anytime soon would be no less than a miracle. His one saving grace was that he knew something that they didn&#39;t. The glue they used did infact have a method of removal. It was just so abnormal that in no way would a school ever allow for it. The one substance that would remove the glue, was urine. The high nitrogen content in human urine could somehow break down this specific glue. If somehow he could become submerged in a bucket full of it, he could escape in easily under 20 seconds, but who has a bucket of that just lying around? But that sliver of hope was what he was determined to cling on to.<br />
<br />
He spent the next 24 hours clipped into that stand. Dayan even had placed him on her shelf, which had a few other figurines. He hoped that they were not also real people who have been trapped for who knows how long by now. Dayan then confirmed that he was the only living doll she posessed at the moment, which let Mark relax his worries a bit.<br />
<br />
Besides the few mouthfuls of cum and small amount of pee he received every few hours, Mark had nothing to eat or drink so far. He was so tired, cramping, painfully sore, and both thirsty and hungry for anything other than more cum.<br />
<br />
Mara was currently drifting in and out of a half asleep state when Dayan finally unclipped him. She played with him like he was any other doll. She styled his hair into a cute ponytail, removed all of his clothing except for the heels and put him into an absolutely tiny skirt, which didn&#39;t even fully cover his ass cheeks, but more like just loosely laid on top of them.  She didnt even bother zipping it up, as his hips were wide enough to prevent it from ever falling down anyways. She changed his dress out for a tight crop top which normally showed off the doll&#39;s abdomen. On him though, it just bairly covered up his breasts. She then reposed him. She bent him down at the waste, placed his left hand on his knee, and moved his right hand to on top of his ass. She tilted his head back and adjusted his face to make him appear to be giving a seductivly pouting face. He looked like he belonged on a pin-up poster hung in the men&#39;s bathroom of some dark and shady bar. He could see his reflection in the mirror, and if he were not currently inside of the doll, he would admit that he looked gorgeously sexy. A perfect combination of girly playfulness and mature seduction. In this new pose was how Mara spent the rest of day 2. <br />
<br />
Durring her time back in the display case, Mara had both been finally fed some cold and watered down, stale oatmeal mixed with cum, of course. It tasted foul, but it at least filled him up a bit. He was ashamed to admit that the cum had been the best part. He also felt a poop slide down the dildo and out of his ass without even a warning. He had no control over his own bowels anymore thanks to the special dildo. And the catheter tube that was stuffed down his urethra last night let his bladder empty itself too. Besides blinking and his tongue, Mara had lost all control over his own body. <br />
<br />
On the third day, Mara&#39;s ass was finally free of the dildo. However he could already tell that it would never be able to fully close ever again. The tightest he could make the hole close was to about the size of a quarter. Or just wide enough for a cock to slip in and out of comfortably. The other hole of concern, was his mouth. Having been stuck in the same position for almost 3 days, had caused his jaw muscles to begin to settle down into this new &quot;resting position&quot;. The same for his lips too, as now the ring gage was actually feeling somewhat comfortable. That alone made him fear for if he ever managed to escape, would he really be a normal human anymore? Or would he just be a human shapped to appear and function forever like a doll?</p>
