<br />
Ami and Amy said, Ami's red mark shinning like the warm living giving sun. &quot;That's one, <br />
two to go.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I feel dizzy,&quot; Amy said. <br />
<br />
Ami hugged Amy, &quot;It'll be over soon Amy I promise.&quot;<br />
<br />
Amy looked in her other self's eyes, &quot;We're going to vanish once we're done aren't we?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We aren't going to vanish, we'll be whole, we're going to become part of the Ami and Amy <br />
who exist in the complete timeline the same as everyone else. We're not vanishing, we're <br />
becoming.&quot;<br />
<br />
Amy hugged Ami back, &quot;Okay... two to go then.&quot; <br />
<br />
++++++<br />
<br />
With the gargoyles current on the island playing crowd control, and the rest of the pack <br />
looking after the damaged Pride and Pack members (fall falling asleep on their feet as they <br />
did so) Serenity dog tired herself enter the estate at dawn with no resistance Trevor <br />
walking behind her. <br />
<br />
Paul had gone back to Father Mike to explain to his bother the near end of the world that <br />
had been adverted and to FINALLY get some sleep!!! <br />
<br />
Serenity slowly made her way through what was the new Smith manor, looking at the <br />
impressive structure that it was. As she went she saw several photographs along a wall, <br />
and a series of college diplomas... Jensen's in business and economics, Kaylee's in the law, <br />
Fran and Darla's in law enforcement, and Julies in biology and medicine. The first <br />
photograph looked like it had happened at Glendale's Episcopalian church with Jensen, <br />
Kaylee, Fran, Darla, and Julie all standing together before the alter... which startled <br />
Serenity a bit. At present EVERY mainstream Christian church disapproved of polygamy. <br />
The only denomination that did practice that had been the Mormons... and they had <br />
abandoned that when Utah joined the union... but the picture was there.<br />
<br />
It was closely followed by a pair of pictures, one showing Kaylee heavily pregnant with <br />
Jensen standing beside her... and then one of her cradling a black and a reddish brown <br />
pup in her arms.<br />
<br />
The next picture was of Darla and Kaylee standing together, both pregnant... although <br />
Darla looked further along at the time, and then ended with a picture of Jensen with a <br />
heavily pregnant Fran and Julie. It finished with pictures of Bart, Jenny, Kevin, Marcy, <br />
Abbey, Alice, and Samantha, with Mr. P laying in front of them.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's like their pasts are being rewritten,&quot; came Trevor's voice from behind her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Serenity nodded, &quot;Like the Pack has always been here... like Jensen was always <br />
Jensen.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you think this has anything to do with Kurse's death?&quot; Trevor asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Possibly,&quot; Serenity sighed, &quot;although I'm not about to mess with all that... just looking at <br />
what is the result of a couple of kids who did something really stupid...&quot;<br />
<br />
Trevor only nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;So how are you making out?&quot; Serenity asked, &quot;being back in a place that to you really <br />
smells of &quot;wolf&quot;?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It actually isn't as bad as it was before,&quot; Trevor commented, &quot;I can really smell it around <br />
their bedrooms, but many of the rooms that the public would see the most if they visited <br />
here has been thoroughly cleaned...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Probably something to do with their minds being free now,&quot; Serenity commented, &quot;no <br />
longer enslaved. Thinking more like a human they realize they need to clean and disinfect <br />
a lot... even if as wolves they don't need it... because humanity has a much weaker <br />
immune system compared with the rest of the animal kingdom.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Trevor nodded, &quot;also, they have some of Kurse's victims here. A pearl colored wolf <br />
took me to a room they're sleeping in. She's taken the liberty of dressing them... though <br />
where a bunch of naked wolf people found children's clothing I don't know... in some <br />
pajamas. She also mentioned some wonder about how to get them back to their parents...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alice, Abbey, Samantha and the mirrorverse,&quot; Serenity spoke, &quot;Like how they got to the <br />
island.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, she said that option isn't available,&quot; Trevor spoke, &quot;they'd become Alice, Abbey, and <br />
Samantha's glass sisters the instant they go inside the mirrorverse. It's part of their <br />
transform... only someone who's form has been locked... or has some immunity to the <br />
game can enter...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That'll make reuniting the families difficult,&quot; Serenity sighed, &quot;Jensen told us that island <br />
was selected because it was so remote. We can't just fly the kids there... and while there <br />
are &quot;passenger liners&quot;, they don't make such trips anymore. They're cruise ships now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Trevor yawned, he was sleepy as he had been awake most of the day, and now much of <br />
the night, and had been through a tough fight in the curse world, even if the wounds <br />
there didn't show up in the real world.<br />
<br />
&quot;So what do we do?&quot; Trevor asked, &quot;I mean the Pack and the Pride still need to have their <br />
turns &quot;killed&quot;... we have all the victims that didn't revert when Kurse died to find, and see if <br />
they want to be changed back...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A lot of that will have to wait,&quot; Serenity sighed, &quot;Once Fran finishes patching up the <br />
physical wounds sustained by the Pack and the Pride in the battle, I intend to go home and <br />
get some sleep... you're welcome to come with me or go with Brian and Felicity... although <br />
I don't know if they will go anywhere until Mary gets back.&quot;<br />
<br />
Trevor caught a hint of depression in her voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;You okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll miss you, Trevor,&quot; Serenity said after a few moments, &quot;I know we've never been <br />
friends... but I have always enjoyed having you around. You've helped so much with my <br />
work.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Though it seems now that the curse is gone, and the largest collection of turns out there <br />
between the Pack and the Pride won't be used... even if you didn't have Merlin's cure,&quot; <br />
Trevor shrugged, &quot;it's sorta like what happened with many of the guys drafted for WWII. <br />
Guy from Alabama meets a guy from Oregon and become friends and thanks to some <br />
miracle they survive the war... but are both going back to their homes... as with no war to <br />
fight and no need to stay in the army... what reason do they have to stay together?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They have to move on,&quot; Serenity nodded, &quot;Although I wonder what I will do when we <br />
finally sort out all the fallout from this... I mean no Game to investigate, no curse to <br />
thwart... what is to become of ME now? The Pack will have each other and will likely <br />
resume much of their previous lives while staying a Pack... the Pride will do much the <br />
same thing... and you have Mary now... and you might be able to see your family again... <br />
I... meanwhile... have nothing. I've spent so long fighting the Game that I never stopped to <br />
think about what I would do when it was finally over.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I doubt it'll really be over,&quot; Trevor commented, &quot;Kurse and the evils that went along with it <br />
are gone forever... but the Game still exists and may have even changed because of what <br />
Kurse did. You'll likely be called on to see just what Kurse's actions and death did to the <br />
Game... who knows... maybe &quot;Transform or Dare&quot; has become a game based off of love <br />
and devotion like the Pride's &quot;true love&quot; powers and the Pack's loyalty instead of the spite <br />
and hatred that it was under Kurse's influence.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You make that sound like you want the game to continue,&quot; Serenity commented.<br />
<br />
Trevor shrugged, &quot;maybe it isn't our forms that makes us who we are. I mean, we've all <br />
adapted to it. You told me you've gone from being a heterosexual male to bisexual female <br />
and have accepted it. Kyle Perkins has gone from a dorky male kid to an adult female she <br />
wolf, who according to these pictures has given birth to two litters of pups already... <br />
clearly the problem doesn't seem to be the form we have... it's the actions that caused it <br />
to change in the first place. The guy who transformed me was some jerk who wanted my <br />
spot on the team and did it out of spite... but if a positive emotion fueled things rather <br />
then a negative one... would that be wrong? Like what Mary told Ashley at the station, <br />
we're all happy, so is that wrong?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So... are you going to do this?&quot; Said Serenity opening the back door and letting the gray <br />
and black lion cub boy into the backyard. The smell was quite stronger back here than it <br />
was in the house, then again, this was the pack's personalized hunting grounds.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes. I have to.&quot; Trevor said. He was glade he didn't see that black and gold wolf <br />
anywhere... He knew it was under the curse just like everyone else but... Trevor just didn't <br />
want to have to see him. He didn't think he could forgive it, not yet. Some scars don't heal <br />
in a week after all. <br />
<br />
He came to the spot of dried blood, he knew this was it. He knelt down and prayed for <br />
Queen. He knew she was just an animal, but she was an animal who helped him wake up <br />
by forcing him to face his self pity. He owed her at least this much... <br />
<br />
+++++++++<br />
<br />
Abbey sat among the rocks looking down at Glass, who still remained asleep. She had no <br />
clue why the other glass wolf slept on. She didn't sleep in the outside world... although <br />
she did go into the mirrorverse commonly with her sisters to sleep at night. She glanced <br />
up to see Betty talking with her mother and Aunt about something, and then over her <br />
shoulder to see Sarah, Ulysses, and Mary trying to make some progress with the <br />
passengers from the yacht. She then looked down to Glass again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why do you sleep?&quot;<br />
<br />
++++++++<br />
<br />
The lioness Penny was pushed along in the wheel chair they had given her as they took her <br />
out of her room, her tendons would requires weeks to heal. <br />
<br />
The lions Gloria and Jeff flanked their cub Jeff, having return wonderfully from statuehood. <br />
None of them had the remote clue on what had occurred. Penny hadn't even called the <br />
police station to ask how the raid on the Smith's had gone. <br />
<br />
The eldest lioness present leaned down next to Penny as Kirk pushed her along.<br />
<br />
&quot;So Penny... when are you going to be marrying my son?&quot; <br />
<br />
Penny blushed, only a day ago she had been a guy whose girl friend had been made into a <br />
statue. Now she was part of some new age lion people species and was a lady to boot!  <br />
And her girlfriend fiancee was now her boyfriend fiancee. When it all came down to it, she <br />
only had one response, &quot;Heheh... let's wait until I can walk down the aisle.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Quite right.&quot; Jeff nodded his mane shaking as he did so.<br />
<br />
Penny did her best not to think of those lost to the wolf pack because she failed in her <br />
duty as a police officer, in a warped sense, she almost thought how being a mother would <br />
make up for that. Wait. MOTHER? Oh who she was she kidding?! She was a female with a <br />
hot guy for an other half so she might as well prepare for the inevitable while she was at <br />
it.  And still, Penny realized what would happen when their families showed up for the <br />
wedding given what she was figuring might be the real meaning for their 'true love rule.'  <br />
But instead of blindly finding a way to cheat around it she calmly accepted the planet's <br />
humanoid lion population would shoot up during the reception. <br />
<br />
<br />
+++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;HEY!&quot; Said Trevor look out over the window (feeling odd to be using a seat belt again), <br />
&quot;What are we doing here! You said we were going straight home after we finished at the <br />
manor and we'd give everyone a day to -rest-!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And I've kept my promise precisely.&quot; Serenity said simply. <br />
<br />
&quot;Why are we here?&quot; Trevor asked nervously, looking out the window of Serenity's car, <br />
&quot;Shouldn't we be finding away to find the people outside of Glendale that were cursed?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Amy said that most of those transformations are reversing,&quot; Serenity told the lion boy, <br />
&quot;those that aren't are those who were already cursed in some way before... and how would <br />
I find them? I do not know the names of ALL the victims... even within Glendale.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What about Jensen?&quot; Trevor asked, &quot;he seemed to know we were at the Hardys... he knew <br />
that Samantha had been sent back to their manor... certainly he can find these other <br />
victims.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He'd still need to know WHO he is looking for,&quot; Serenity commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;What about Kathy?&quot; Trevor suggested, &quot;she might have been cursed again...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Is there a reason you don't want to see your folks?&quot; Serenity asked.<br />
<br />
Trevor looked down, &quot;well... suppose all I end up doing is roaring... or whatever a lion cub <br />
does until he's able to roar?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I doubt that'll happen,&quot; Serenity commented, &quot;You've admitted to being friends with Mary <br />
and Judas... you aren't roaring now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm afraid they won't remember me... won't like me,&quot; Trevor spoke.<br />
<br />
&quot;They're your family, Trevor, go on,&quot; Serenity spoke, &quot;after what that second stringer did to <br />
you, you deserve this.&quot;<br />
<br />
Trevor sighed and then got up and out of the car. Serenity went with him, to act as a <br />
guardian who had found and rescued him, in case they needed an explanation.<br />
<br />
Trevor slowly made his way up the sidewalk toward the front door to his home, in a small <br />
middle class neighborhood, not that far away from what had once been the Perkins home. <br />
He was nervous as he did so. He wondered what his parents would say... what he would <br />
say.<br />
<br />
Once he got to the door, he knocked once and waited quietly. After a few moments a <br />
woman in her mid to late forties came to the door. She looked down at Trevor for a few <br />
moments.<br />
<br />
&quot;It can't be...&quot; the woman gasped, &quot;... it can't be... he...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom?&quot; Trevor asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Where have you been?&quot; the woman demanded, &quot;we thought you were killed! The <br />
newspapers all said it was suicide...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sorry mom,&quot; Trevor said weakly, &quot;it was some guy. He came after me... I could barely <br />
get away and hide... he threatened to kill me if I ever showed up again and he saw me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My God,&quot; his mother gasped and hugged him, ignoring the fact that Trevor was eight and <br />
a lion.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jacob!&quot; his mother, Marie, then called after a few moments, &quot;Our cub is home! And ALIVE! <br />
OUR CUB IS ALIVE!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He's alive?&quot; came a male voice from deeper inside the home, and soon a man about the <br />
same age as the woman, and once he saw Trevor he rapidly approached, &quot;he IS alive.&quot;<br />
<br />
Trevor found himself being hugged by both of them.<br />
<br />
&quot;We'd about given up all hope that the news report was wrong,&quot; Jacob told him, &quot;it's been <br />
so long...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm so happy to have you back Trevor,&quot; his mother said, &quot;You need not EVER mention the <br />
evil man who made you hide from us... Your sister will be excited to see you when she <br />
gets home.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We love you, son, you know,&quot; Jacob told him<br />
<br />
That made Trevor feel extremely happy. They still loved him and had bought the story. <br />
They seemed to recognize him as having always been a lion cub... but then that was part <br />
of the transform the Hardys had gave the pride.<br />
<br />
&quot;I love you too,&quot; Trevor answered.<br />
<br />
And with that he felt something strange start to occur. He got the sensation that he was <br />
rising into the air. At first he thought he was being lifted up by some unknown force, but <br />
when his mother's eyes shifted from an emerald green to bright honey color, he began to <br />
see it... he had the pride's &quot;true love&quot; powers... and he was transforming his parents... but <br />
hadn't they been referring to romantic love?<br />
<br />
His mother's hug grew stronger as he felt her arm muscles enlarge and become covered in <br />
a gray and brown coat of fur, that resembled his own in many ways. He watched the hair <br />
on her head vanish and her ears move to the top of her head, and finished with her feline <br />
muzzle pushing out and teeth enlarging into fangs. He felt his own fur rubbing against his <br />
mother's and soon saw that both his parents were as naked as he was. And his father was <br />
standing erect in the now larger doorway with his dark brown mane and tawny gold fur.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, who is your friend here, Trevor?&quot; Jacob asked after a moment, noticing Serenity for <br />
the first time.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh...&quot; Said Trevor suddenly feeling very sleepy, &quot;That's... Madam Serenity... she... found <br />
me... and... took care of....&quot; The overwhelming feeling of being in his mother  arms after <br />
over a year and being in the body of a little lion boy finally proved to be too much and he <br />
fell asleep in the warm embrace of his mother, not being able to remember when he had <br />
felt so happy. <br />
<br />
<br />
+++++<br />
<br />
&quot;How long will we be staying here, Beta females?&quot; Betty asked as she approached Julie and <br />
Darla, who sat near the rocks where the Pack had first arrived on the island for the battle.<br />
<br />
&quot;Some portion of the pack will stay here until the humans leave,&quot; Darla answered, &quot;and <br />
then EVERYONE will return home. No exceptions.&quot;<br />
<br />
Betty was quiet for a moment. Bethy and Tebby NEVER wanted to leave the island... at <br />
least not permanently, and her having to remind them that Darla and Julie were the Pack's <br />
betas and outside of a command from Jensen or Kaylee, they were to be obeyed, didn't set <br />
well within her. They accepted it, but it seemed to be a grudging acceptance.<br />
<br />
&quot;Lawrence will also need to go home soon to have his arm put back into place,&quot; Julie <br />
added, &quot;he can not keep running around and dancing as you all have been. Or he will have <br />
to have that arm amputated because the bones, nerves and muscle died and atrophied to <br />
the point where the limb is useless.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Shouldn't we be free to do what we want?&quot; Betty asked, sounding more like a whining <br />
child then a person who should be a middle aged adult.<br />
<br />
&quot;There are consequences for everything,&quot; Darla answered, &quot;the laws we have are not to <br />
oppress and restrain people. They are there to protect people and allow society to function <br />
as a whole in a good and productive matter.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And the situation with Lawrence has NOTHING to do with laws or being oppressed,&quot; Julie <br />
finished, &quot;I put that arm back into place, and told him NOT to use it for a few weeks. Kurse <br />
made him use it, and as you can see, it's no longer in place and needs to be put BACK in <br />
place. The situation with Lawrence has only what is best for Lawrence in mind. Do you <br />
want to see him lose an arm?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; Betty admitted after a few moments, &quot;but then why are you both still here?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It is our responsibility as betas,&quot; Darla answered, &quot;we would both be happier with or <br />
mate, our sister, and sister-wife. But we must. Abbey is here, looking after Glass. You <br />
refuse to go home. Sarah, Ulysses, and Mary are here to talk with the people that Kurse <br />
abducted... and Elise and Fox are somewhere... though they SHOULD be looking after <br />
Mary.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So if you weren't betas or didn't have to be here, you wouldn't?&quot; Betty asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is a dark evil place where Kurse tried to steal our mate and sister wife from us,&quot; Julie <br />
answered, &quot;and do not DARE say they were happier that way... they were happier as they <br />
were. Anything in their minds now is a legacy of Kurse wanting us to be miserable. And <br />
hopefully Amy or someone can fix that to restore them to the way they were BEFORE Kurse <br />
decided she was our God. This island is a picture of Kurse's evil and all she did. Stealing <br />
pack mates... robbing the humanity of people who did not want to lose it... and then <br />
making them all behave in ways to amuse Kurse... do you understand how GUILTY <br />
Samantha presently feels for what Kurse made her do? I don't think you do, as you seem <br />
to think that what Kurse did here was &quot;pretty&quot;... likely another touch of her magic. Kurse is <br />
not someone to be defended... if she was... there would have been so much EVIL that went <br />
through what she did.&quot;<br />
<br />
Betty didn't argue any further. Even Tebby and Bethy sensed the sadness and anger at <br />
Kurse for what the witch had done to Jensen and Kaylee and the human yacht passengers.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm going to check on the others,&quot; Betty spoke, &quot;we're all getting sleepy... it's been a <br />
LONG day and night.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
+++++<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sorry we attacked your home,&quot; Ulysses said to Mary as they sat on the beach of Big <br />
Bad Island.<br />
<br />
They had managed some conversation with some of the humans from the yacht, but it was <br />
still tough going. The parents wanted their children, and both Ulysses and Mary were <br />
forced to tell that that wasn't possible, which resulted in many of them crying into <br />
Ulysses's shoulder.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know,&quot; Mary nodded, &quot;You didn't seem that interested in fighting then either... strange <br />
isn't it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Ulysses nodded, &quot;I liked you, you know? I REALLY liked you. You would have made <br />
a very cute she wolf...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And you a very handsome lion,&quot; Mary nodded back, &quot;but I guess we aren't meant to be <br />
mates. I mean, I'm a felid, you're a canid... instinctive rivals... even the lion's natural rival, <br />
the Hyena isn't a dog... and even if we weren't I'm eight years old again. You'd be robbing <br />
the cradle if we dated...&quot;<br />
<br />
Ulysses nodded, &quot;We can still be friends right? It'll still be years before the Pack will expect <br />
me to contribute to their natural population growth... and the Pride will likely expect you <br />
to do the same when you grow up.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course we can be friends,&quot; Mary said, rubbing a paw down Ulysses's back, his thick <br />
guard hairs on his back rubbing against her much shorter fur.<br />
<br />
++++++<br />
<br />
Sarah came up to the center of the island where she found Amethyst and the gem wolves, <br />
along with Caroline, Lawrence, Betty, Maxine, Robyn, and a few of the other wolves from <br />
the rescue team that had been youthafied and split by Kurse's powers and the physical <br />
transformations that Kurse had done was reversed, and Kurse's mental control was gone, <br />
but Sarah could plainly see that they were struggling with what happened.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you guys alright?&quot; Sarah.<br />
<br />
The dance stopped.<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; Caroline said weakly after a moment, &quot;so much has happened. Our transformations, <br />
Sarah... you remember that? Both of us said &quot;dare&quot; and were dared to answer transform <br />
next.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I remember,&quot; Sarah nodded, &quot;but we were still provided for. And Jensen seemed to care <br />
about us more as Jensen then he ever did as Jennifer.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Kurse wasn't really all that different,&quot; Caroline said, &quot;her only difference from Jensen was <br />
while he rejected evil... she embraced it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't understand,&quot; Sarah said simply.<br />
<br />
&quot;Before she became evil, all &quot;Kurse&quot; wanted was to open up an infinite store of possibilities <br />
to the world,&quot; Caroline spoke, &quot;which one can't really say was evil... and you can even <br />
argue is what free people have always tried to do... but when she was rejected... she <br />
somehow went crazy and evil and turned infinite possibilities for happiness into dark <br />
chaotic forces that resulted in perversions... death... evil... the exact opposite of what she <br />
started as.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And those possibilities are all still there in a way...&quot; Robyn commented slowly, &quot;Freedom... <br />
not being restrained...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We need those things though,&quot; Sarah commented, &quot;think about Hobbes. You leave <br />
everyone free to do whatever they want with no rules... the resulting chaos wouldn't make <br />
anyone happy. People would be killed by those stronger then them and everyone would <br />
live in a paranoid fear that someone stronger will come over the hill and kill them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hobbes's solution to the problem was a totalitarian dictatorship,&quot; Garnett said, &quot;that <br />
wouldn't have made anyone happy either.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm not saying Hobbes had the best solution, I'm saying he recognized the problem,&quot; <br />
Sarah answered, &quot;TOO much freedom and you allow the darker elements to do nasty <br />
things to the innocent, and as you say... TOO much order and control and the darker <br />
elements do the same things as when there is too much freedom. The solution is to find a <br />
happy middle.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We're not arguing that Sarah... and we'll still follow Jensen...&quot; Caroline spoke, &quot;it's just that <br />
so much has happened... so much has been done to us... we're conflicted by so much... I'm <br />
Caroline again... but I can still feel Cobalt's mind inside me... she isn't the evil thing that <br />
Kurse created anymore... more like an innocent child who can't understand things... who <br />
wants to be free... yet I'm restraining her. Doesn't that make me wrong? For holding a <br />
child back? Not letting her be free? Is it wrong for me to love Opal? I barely know him... yet <br />
I love him more then anybody... Jensen, my parents... anybody.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You think its wrong for you to love?&quot; Sarah asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;No... it's that everything happened so fast so out of control, I don't know what to think <br />
anymore,&quot; Caroline sighed, &quot;and a part of me wishes we can free the world... I mean look <br />
at what's going on in Iraq and Afghanistan. Those places are and were nightmares. <br />
Saddam Hussein wasn't a good guy. The Taliban weren't good people and even with them <br />
gone... the news hasn't reported anything good out of those places.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Kurse wouldn't have made those situations any better,&quot; Sarah warned, &quot;she might have <br />
even been willing to make the fighting worse for her own amusement.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We know,&quot; Jasper said in a frustrated voice, &quot;we all know... It's just so hard to sort things <br />
out when you multiple voices in your head.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sarah then turned to Amethyst, who was strangely quiet.<br />
<br />
&quot;What about you?&quot; Sarah asked the second biggest she wolf after the Japanese wolves, <br />
although Fran had said something to a wounded Chiyoye that Julie was of the opinion that <br />
they should have surgery done to make their breasts smaller.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's all so sad,&quot; Amethyst whimpered after a moment, &quot;Kurse made me a bubble head from <br />
the very beginning... probably to match Caroline's transform for me to become this... <br />
busty... and well to be honest... I WANT to go back to that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; Sarah gasped.<br />
<br />
&quot;I was always happy, nothing ever got me down, and I still functioned well within the <br />
Pack,&quot; Amethyst spoke, &quot;Now... after seeing what Kurse did to us... made us do to the <br />
people on that yacht... made us fight with our pack mates... and then being freed... I'm so <br />
sad... guilty... ashamed. And it hurts.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But you got your smarts back,&quot; Sarah pointed out.<br />
<br />
&quot;What good is being smart when your miserable,&quot; Amethyst finished.<br />
<br />
&quot;I want you all to talk with me about these things,&quot; Sarah said firmly, &quot;You need help... I <br />
can see that. And I want to help.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why?&quot; Tourmaline asked, &quot;we barely know each other.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But we're pack now,&quot; Sarah answered, &quot;the past doesn't matter. I'm sure Jensen wants us <br />
to be happy and to function well with the pack and in society. And if you're miserable... by <br />
extension, the rest of the pack is miserable. Let me help.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You aren't a psychiatrist,&quot; Lawrence commented, &quot;HOW can you help us with all of this? I <br />
got a little boy's voice in my head that only wants to run around, chase cars, bark at <br />
squirrels and howl at the moon... and he's conflicting with the rest of me. He isn't in <br />
control, but that doesn't mean it's not difficult.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can help you by being a good pack mate,&quot; Sarah answered, &quot;I helped all of us get used <br />
to being wolves... I helped Ulysses get used to being too young to take a mate... I'm sure I <br />
can help you just let me listen. And besides, you know we're ALL going to be leaving here <br />
eventually. The people won't stay here forever.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Cobalt thinks we could turn this island into a resort,&quot; Caroline commented, &quot;a place where <br />
people could live a little more freely...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Who would come here though?&quot; Sarah answered, &quot;the pack and the pride are horrified by <br />
this place after fighting Kurse. You know that... and it's so out of the way that people won't <br />
likely come here either... and how knows what the nations of the world will do when the <br />
people on that yacht tell their governments about what Kurse did here...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But Kurse is dead,&quot; Lazuli spoke, &quot;she can't threaten anyone ever again.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Doesn't mean that the fear and consequences of her actions are gone,&quot; Sarah warned, <br />
&quot;just because one evil is defeated doesn't mean that the consequences aren't there.&quot;<br />
<br />
They all slowly sighed, unable to really counter Sarah's logic.</p>
