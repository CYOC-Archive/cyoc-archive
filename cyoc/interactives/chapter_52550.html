<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Tyler nervously watched as the note spelled out his punishment. He couldn't believe this was happening. Once the words finished appearing he read, &quot;For your punishment you will become Taylor's twin sister Tina since you didn't like being a girl. You will dress the same way that Taylor dresses and you will also be a lesbian. Taylor, her friends, and you are on the cheerleading squad with Mandy being head cheerleader and dating the star quarterback. Your sister will be nice to you though she'll know that you were her twin brother and may tease you a bit about it knowing that you don't like it. Soon everyone you know will find out that you're a lesbian and tease you for it for two months. No one will believe you if you should point out that Taylor and Jeanette are lesbians too. There is another girl who wants to be your girlfriend and you two will become girlfriends in two hours and will stay together for the rest of your lives. You'll also know how to be a girl and will easily pass for a girl but you'll still have all your old memories and none of growing up as a girl. Have fun in your new life.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Please no,&quot; Tyler begged the note, &quot;I don't want to be a girl. Please anything but that.&quot;<br />
<br />
The note didn't seem to listen though and Tyler felt a sudden sense of vertigo and closed his eyes. Once the feeling passed he opened his eyes to find that he was in the mall. &quot;Come on Tina,&quot; Taylor said. &quot;We want to get our new bikinis before we're old and gray.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh what?&quot; Tyler asked looking confused.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you feeling ok Tina?&quot; Mandy asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm feeling fine,&quot; Tyler said noticing that his voice was a girl's voice and he was responding to the name of Tina.<br />
<br />
&quot;You looked a little lost there for a moment Tina,&quot; Jeanette said smiling.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just daydreaming,&quot; Tyler said with a smile and a slight giggle.<br />
<br />
&quot;What about?&quot; Taylor asked giggling a bit too.<br />
<br />
&quot;About the girl I'm sure to attract wearing my new bikini,&quot; Tyler said and all four of them giggled. 'Why did I say that and why am I giggling?' he asked himself.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well lets not waste any more time,&quot; Taylor said grabbing Tyler and practically dragging him to a store.<br />
<br />
'What am I doing here?' Tyler asked himself as he looked through the swimsuits looking for a bikini. He had stolen glances down at his body when no one was looking and discovered that he was a girl. 'This isn't what I want to be doing. I don't want to be a girl.' Finding a skimpy bikini he picked it up and holding it up to his body asked, &quot;What do you think?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I would like to see Taylor in that,&quot; Jeanette said and smiled in Taylor's direction.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do they have another like it?&quot; Taylor asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe,&quot; Tyler said and went back to looking through the swimsuits. 'Now I'm looking for a bikini for Taylor like the one I picked out,' he said to himself. 'This is getting ridiculous. I need to go back home and tear up that note to undo this.' &quot;Ah here's another one,&quot; he said picking up another bikini.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh that's perfect for me,&quot; Taylor squealed and grabbed the bikini out of Tyler's hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can't wait to see you in it,&quot; Jeanette said as Taylor held it up to her body.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well we can wash them in the Laundromat close by the pool and then go swimming,&quot; Taylor said coyly. &quot;You'll be able to see me in it very soon then.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Those swim bitches will be jealous when they see you two wearing those bikinis,&quot; Mandy said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let them be jealous,&quot; Tyler said with a smile. &quot;It's not our fault that they don't have the body to wear these.&quot; 'What the hell am I saying?' he asked himself.<br />
<br />
&quot;Too true,&quot; Taylor said giggling, &quot;but it will be great to see their faces when they see us. Isn't that right Tina?&quot;<br />
<br />
Tyler giggled and said, &quot;Of course it will be.&quot;<br />
<br />
About an hour later they had paid for their bikinis and had just left the store when Dani came up to them. She was on the swim team but she was alone right now. Perhaps that was why she seemed nervous. &quot;H-hello,&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you want?&quot; Mandy asked in a haughty tone.<br />
<br />
&quot;I just... I mean I want to... well...&quot; Dani began.<br />
<br />
&quot;We don't have all day,&quot; Mandy said rolling her eyes. &quot;Either tell us what you want or get out of our way.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I...&quot; Dani began uncertain then seemed to change as she said, &quot;Oh to hell with it.&quot; She quickly approached Tyler and kissed him.<br />
<br />
'What the hell?' Tyler asked himself surprised. His surprise didn't last long and before Dani broke the kiss he was kissing her back. &quot;What was that?&quot; he asked when they parted a little breathless.<br />
<br />
&quot;I've always wanted to kiss you Tina,&quot; Dani said. &quot;I want to be your girlfriend. I know I may be kicked of the swim team for going out with a cheerleader but I don't care. I love you Tina. Please say you'll go out with me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I don't know,&quot; Tyler said looking at Taylor, Jeanette, and Mandy.<br />
<br />
They looked at them critically for a moment then Mandy said, &quot;Well you two do make a cute couple.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You won't kick her off the cheer squad will you?&quot; Dani asked looking worried.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not as long as you two can keep it a secret,&quot; Mandy said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I can do that,&quot; Dani said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I heard that you were going to be kicked off the swim team anyway,&quot; Taylor said.<br />
<br />
Dani sighed and said, &quot;It's true. I only went out for swimming because my mom wanted me to. I wanted to be a cheerleader but my mom said that cheerleaders are air headed sluts and refused to sign any consent form for cheerleading. She said swimming is a much better extracurricular activity.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I'll be your girlfriend,&quot; Tyler said feeling something strange in his groin. And before he could stop himself he was kissing Dani again with passion.<br />
<br />
&quot;Get a room you two,&quot; Mandy said giggling.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not a bad idea,&quot; Tyler said breaking the kiss and then went back to kissing Dani.<br />
<br />
&quot;There you are Dani,&quot; Mary said coming up to them. She was the captain of the girl's swim team and positively hated cheerleaders. &quot;I never imagined you were a lesbian let alone that you'd be going out with a skank cheerleader.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She isn't a skank,&quot; Dani said defending Tyler. &quot;Tina is a decent girl and that's a lot more than I can say about you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well if you really feel that way then you're off the team,&quot; Mary said. &quot;I wonder what your mom will say about that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't care,&quot; Dani said glaring daggers at Mary. &quot;I didn't want to be on the swim team in the first place.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I'm glad you won't be able to look at my body in the showers anymore,&quot; Mary said with a disgusted look on her face. She then turned and walked away.<br />
<br />
&quot;She's going to spread the news that we're lesbians,&quot; Dani said putting her head on Tyler's shoulder.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you want to go home Tina?&quot; Taylor asked.<br />
<br />
Taking a deep breath Tyler said, &quot;I want to go swimming and show off my new bikini. Going home won't accomplish anything.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's my girl,&quot; Dani said then kissed Tyler. &quot;I need to go get my swimsuit from home.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I have more than enough money to get you a bikini,&quot; Tyler said slyly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh thank you,&quot; Dani said and kissed Tyler again.<br />
<br />
'I really need to get home and tear up that note before my life gets even more out of control,' Tyler said to himself.<br />
<br />
Unknown to Tyler by the time he gets home the note would be gone fluttering out an open window on it's way to find someone else.</p>
