<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The changes began immediately after Jeff clicked &quot;Continue&quot;. His body began to tingle all over and a strange feeling arose in his pubic region. Quickly, Jeff tore off his pants and stripped off his boxers, throwing them into a heap in the corner of the room. He didn't want to miss a second of this occasion, and his clothes would only get in the way. Pulling up his shirt just in time, Jeff watched transfixed as his genitals shrank, retracting into his groin and out of sight. He reached a hand down and stroked his bare crotch, where mere moments before, he had once been the proud owner of a beautiful penis and a set of testicles. <br />
   Jeff removed his shirt completely, and threw it into the corner with the rest of his clothes. Eager to see what would happen to him next, He moved across the room to his full-length mirror. With mild surprise, He noticed that all the hair on his entire body had completely disappeared. His legs, arms, face, head, chest, belly, and crotch were devoid and completely bare.<br />
   Just then, the tingling grew drastically in his face and a gasp was cut short as Jeff's mouth and nose simultaneously sealed shut. His chin sank into his heck, which thickened until it was nearly the same distance around as his head. The next second, his neck extended upward and grew stiff, its base widening until it nearly overcame his shoulders in girth.<br />
   Jeff's arms then seized up and folded themselves up against his body, then began to absorb into his torso, which had also begun to bloat. His crotch widened and extended forward, while his buttocks fused together and flattened on the bottom. By this time, Jeff's entire pubic region had formed itself into a flat base, his legs forced into odd angles as he struggled to keep himself upright.<br />
   Finally, Jeff's face disappeared completely and the top of his head sunk in, creating an opening that burrowed down through his neck and into his chest. What remained of his head formed into a sleek cylinder and stiffened until if fed flawlessly into his neck. His body hollowed and began to round itself into a wide cylinder, his navel and nipples absorbed into its form.<br />
   As his body smoothed itself out, Jeff's skin started to change. It became hard and cold, losing its color and opacity. The sheer weight he gained in this phase of the transformation forced him into a squatting position, lowering until his base rested upon the floor. When this had happened, he began to decrease in size, his entire body shrinking, and while he shrank, his legs, the last remaining part of him that resembled any part of his previous human form, retracted into his body, until no limbs remained.<br />
   Jeff had finally finished hollowing out, and his skin had fully transformed into a layer of colorless transparent glass no more than two millimeters thick at its thickest. Every inch of his smooth surface inside, and out could be seen from all angles, glistening slightly in the dim light from the ceiling fan. The air moving around him creating a faint hollow sound as it blew across his glass lip. A blip on the computer screen signified that the transformation was finally complete. <br />
   Standing at no more than six inches tall, Jeff, now a plain, empty glass liquor bottle, stood motionless in the middle of his room. Unable to move, see, smell, taste, or hear, but still able to think and feel, Jeff was beside himself. He'd done it! He had reduced himself to little more than a lifeless, inanimate object. He couldn't believe it! Moments before he had once been a fully grown, living, breathing human being. Now he was a glass bottle. <br />
   The instant before he'd lost his sight, Jeff had caught a glimpse of the computer screen. At that point, a few of the settings had been filled in, including the duration of his transformation, which read:<br />
<br />
&quot;3 Years, 9 Months (Countdown begins after subject has been transported to specified location)&quot;<br />
<br />
   Though he thought nearly 4 years seemed kind of a long time to be stuck in this form, Jeff was at least relieved that he now knew how long he had before he would turn back. All that remained now was for him to be transported to another location.<br />
    Mere seconds after this thought, Jeff felt a strange sensation about his entire glass body. The carpet below him disappeared, replaced by what seemed to be metal bars. He fell over with a clink against what felt like concrete, a stream of water rushed past him as he lay there, falling through the bars underneath him. Small droplets of cold water fell from above onto his sleek surface and ran down his sides. It was raining, and Jeff was lying in the gutter of some random street he could not see, filling with dirty rain water as unseen pedestrians and cars passed him by, paying him no attention as they headed to where they were heading. After all, they had purpose, while Jeff was nothing more than a dirty bottle, gathering grime and mud in the gutter on the side of the road. . .</p>
