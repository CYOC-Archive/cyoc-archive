<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">With the newest prankster on campus out looking for babes and fun, it didn&#39;t take Lim Mian Chao too long to find a perfect target for his brand of humour. He&#39;d been cruising past when he saw the future victim and his dog walking through a small park on the edge of the campus.<br />
<br />
Reilly Waters was out earlier than usual to walk his pomeranian, trying to avoid running into any of those jock jerk who&#39;d teased him about his little Pom-Pom yesterday. It drove him a little nuts that such hot looking guys could be such assholes, but that seemed to be a more and more common thing on the campus lately.<br />
<br />
The sounds of excited bark brought him back to reality though, as Pom-Pom had left a brown deposit on the curb. Bending over in his tight shorts, Reilly was having a hard time grabbing the little turds with the plastic bag. He winced a little as one of them smeared on the edge of his rose-colored sneakers, but he finally scooped them all up. <br />
<br />
However, his efforts to pick up after his dog left the twinkish gay man vulnerable just long enough for Mian Chao to take advantage. The asian prankster pull out a paint filled ballon from the glove compartment of his sports car, and let it fly at the bent over Reilly. It hit the other man squarely in the ass and splattered dark blue paint all over him, as well as his dog.<br />
<br />
&quot;YOU JUST GOT PRANKED, FAGGOT!&quot;<br />
<br />
Mian Chao pushed down on the accelerator and sped off laughing...<br />
<br />
=====<br />
<br />
The sudden wet feeling across his back and butt caused Reilly to tip over and fall into the grass. He rolled over just in time to hear the shouted slur from a familiar jerk in the fast car. One touch of a hand on his back brought up blue paint. His clothes were ruined. But none of that really concerned him as much as the sight of his dog covered in the same paint!<br />
<br />
&quot;That awful, awful Chao! He got my Pom-Pom dirty with his stupid prank! Guess it&#39;s time for washies!&quot;<br />
<br />
He picked up the paint splattered dog, careful to wipe away any near its mouth or eyes as he started to walk back to his dorm room. Reilly was grateful that he had no roommate to pass by in such a sorry state. Getting inside and locking his door, he carried the dirty pomeranian over to the small sink in his kitchen area. <br />
<br />
He put the dog down gently, and then began taking off his own paint covered clothes until he was in his underwear.. It was going to be a total hassle to clean this up, but he really needed to get Pom-Pom washed off first. Reaching for the handle, Reilly turned on the faucet and warm water began to fill the sink. The dog yipped a bit but settled in as his owner began scrubbing at the paint on its fur.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why are the hot ones always, always such assholes, Pommy? Why can&#39;t they just be nice and gay like me?&quot;<br />
<br />
His mind turned towards the one responsible for all of this, that fucc boi Lim Mian Chao. He was such a hottie with his tight bod but a jerk! Unfortunately, the flash of lust that came with those thought was more than enough for the &#39;were breeder&#39; curse that Reilly had gotten from the asian prankster&#39;s homophobic slur to begin workings its power on him...<br />
<br />
====<br />
<br />
It began with the clothes that he&#39;d discard on the floor. The paint covering the shorts and belly tee began to soak into them, changing them into a pair of blue jeans and a blue polo shirt. Upon the shirt, the Greek letters of the fraternity known as Mu Alpha Nu stitched themselves into place.<br />
<br />
The rose-colored sneakers changed next as the paint splatters on them turned black and spread out over the footwear. With tearing and ripping, the sneakers became a pair of thick heeled boots with steel toes, a perfect symbol of the man the unsuspecting Reilly was to become.<br />
<br />
====<br />
<br />
Back at the sink, Reilly was starting to have trouble with Pom-Pom in sink. The dog started to squirm uncontrollably, kicking up water in the gay man&#39;s face as it scrambled up onto the countertop.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s wrong with you, Pommy? You like bath time!&quot;<br />
<br />
But the dog didn&#39;t hear its owner. It was too busy with the changes it was under going. Its legs cracked and lengthed while its puff ball tail uncurled itself longer. Exposed claws slipped into its shifting paws while the brown fur darkened to  smoky grey that hugged an expanding torso. The pomeranian&#39;s muzzle shortened and its fangs grew prominent just long thin whiskers grew outwards. Blinking eyes turned from dark brown pools to golden-green with vertical slits.  Finally, its high-pitched yelps became deeper and deep as they shifted into purring rumbles. With a few cracks and pops, the last of the canine features vanished a great big grey tomcat!<br />
<br />
Reilly was shocked by this transformation as he finally wiped the soapy water from his eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;P..Pommy? But how did you?&quot;<br />
<br />
However, his question would remain unanswered as the power of the curse from pet to owner. The man grabbed the edge of the sink, as muscles all over his body began to spasm and grown larger. Fall to all fours, Reilly began to cough loudly as his thin torso cracked larger and larger, his new lungs taking in great breaths of air. All along his chest, muscles were pressing outward, starting with his pecs that surged out into thick slabs while his abs grew more chiseled and ripped,<br />
<br />
Each gulp of air seemed to flow outwards into his limbs. His spindly arms grew thicker, as biceps bulged with new strength borne of a life of sports and the gym. His stick-like legs rippled with new life as they grew into something more appropriate for a star athlete. His hands popped larger with strong fingers trying to dig into the linoleum, matched by a surge of growth in his feet which settling in the size 12 range now.<br />
<br />
&quot;H...H...help...&quot;<br />
<br />
But the cry came out in a deeper tone than Reilly expected as his Adam&#39;s apple choked out the previously effeminate tone from his voice. It was aided by the thickening of his neck muscles. This shock allowed the curse to begin warping his mind and memories into a new course. It wiped away his life as a liberal arts major, instead filling in the void with that of a star jock, just like the ones he used to lust after. That&#39;s right used to lust after, as his attraction to men was wicked away and a roaring libido that hungered only for pussy took its place with authority.<br />
<br />
The changes now reached a fading Reilly&#39;s head, as his light blonde hair started to turn a deep rich brown, pulling itself into a tightly gelled do. His weak chin pulled itself into a full lantern jaw as a five o&#39;clock shadow washed over. A delicate nose cracked and widened itself into a more manly shape. His lips retained some thickness, but only enough to conceal the gleaming white smile behind them. Finally, his baby blues grew muddy with brown. <br />
<br />
The man who had been Reilly Waters started to get up, his height increasing as he rose up to 6&#39;2&quot;. He moved towards the cat on the counter, his thick hands picking it up to hold against his muscular chest. As he petted it, the final changes started as the light purple briefs of Reilly began to struggled against the growth of the cock underneath them. Each stroke of the cat&#39;s back brought another inch of growth until the briefs were on the verge of ripping away. However, they then shifted in shape to accommodate their new occupant, becoming a pair of loose fitting grey flannel boxers in the process. <br />
<br />
As his cat purred against his, the new man grinned. He wondered for a moment why he was standing in the kitchen in his underwear but that concern faded as he caught a glimpse of his clothes on the floor.<br />
<br />
&quot;Right. That babe last night couldn&#39;t wait to get into the bedroom...&quot;<br />
<br />
As the words left his mouth, a change washed over the dorm room. The neat appearance became a bit more shabby as sports magazines and empty beer cans filled the coffee table. A pristine couch turned ragged as months of sex and sports watching stained it deeply. In the back bedroom, a small bed exploded to king sized with a tossed sheets and pillows. Several articles of women&#39;s undergarments could be seen peaking out from different corners of the room, trophies of past conquests for this particular pussy hunter.<br />
<br />
Putting down his cat and flopping down on the couch, Reggie Wales massaged his cock through his boxers, a memory of last night&#39;s fun flashing through his head. <br />
<br />
&quot;Damn that BAE babe was amazing....&quot;<br />
<br />
But before he could completely lose himself in the sexy memory, a loud obnoxious ringing came from the pocket of his jeans on the floor. He grumbled and dug his Cisdroid phone out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yo, Reggie here...&quot;<br />
<br />
The voice on the other end was one of his bros from MAN, telling him about the party at the BAE sorority that night. Grinning his winning grin, Reggie hung up and scooped up his clothes from the floor. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yeah, the Pussy Hunt is on tonight! Think I&#39;ll find that babe again, Puss?&quot;<br />
<br />
His grey haired cat looked at him with indifference. The frat boy shrugged it off as he finished dressing. After all, even if she didn&#39;t show, there was sure to be plenty of others to have fun with....</p>
