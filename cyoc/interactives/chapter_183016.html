<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Here is a link to the bathing suit &quot;Amber&quot; will choose: https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32995662151.html</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Jeff/”Amber” and Jake make their way to the parking lot, Jake looks over at the “girl”, “what would you think about heading to the beach,” he asks, “it is such a beautiful warm day.”<br />
<br />
Jeff thinks for a while, “I don&#39;t know,” he says, “I mean, I would not mind and it would be nice to take a dip and cool off, but I have no bathing suit.”<br />
<br />
Jake smiles, “no problem,” he says, “we&#39;ll just buy one for you.”<br />
<br />
“Amber” looks at him and shakes her head, “thanks, but not,” she says, “I have so many bathing suits.”<br />
<br />
“Aaaw, but I&#39;d so love to have a nice day at the beach with such an attractive girl,” Jake says.<br />
<br />
“Jake... you are really sweet,” the “girl” says kindly, “but even if I needed a bathing suit, I have not that much money on me,” she lies. Jeff/”Amber” in truth would have had enough money with him, the real reason is that he does not want to show so much skin to a boy he... well “Amber”.... has just met.<br />
<br />
But Jake, of course, does not know that the girl walking next to him is actually a 16 year old boy and Emma&#39;s new boyfriend. “I don&#39;t mind, Amber,” he says, smiling, “a bathing suit is not to expensive. I really want to do this for you, please,” he says.<br />
<br />
Jeff looks at Jake, the “girl” then sighs, “okay Jake,” she says, “but I GET to choose the suit,” Jake smiles and agrees. &#39;I can give the suit to Emma when this is finally over and I am back being my right gender,&#39; Jeff thinks to himself.<br />
<br />
“I know a great store that sells very nice bathing suits,” the boy says, “I went there with my ex-girlfriend many times.”<br />
<br />
“I won&#39;t ask who your ex is,” Jeff says, “but I am sorry that it did not work out with her.”<br />
<br />
“Thanks,” Jake says, “I really don&#39;t want to be talking about her.” The real truth why Jake does not want to tell “Amber” about his so called ex is, because he is afraid that once Amber would know that Emma is his “ex”, he&#39;d lose the second hottest girl in the universe. Amber would dump him right there, because she&#39;d assume that he, Jake, is only interested in her because she resembles Emma so good.<br />
<br />
Jeff misinterprets Jake&#39;s silence for sadness, “hey, don&#39;t worry,” the “girl” says, “you are a handsome boy. I am sure you&#39;ll find the right girl sooner or later,” she gives him a kind smile.<br />
<br />
Jake looks at her, &#39;I already found her,&#39; he thinks to himself, “thanks Amber,” he says, smiling back.<br />
<br />
They continue to walk towards the store, Jake is on edge, hoping not to bump into Emma, that bitch would ruin his plan. Luckily they reach the store without stumbling into Emma, once inside the store, Jake sighs in relief as he sees that Emma is no where to be seen. The two teenagers walk to the girl&#39;s and woman&#39;s section, “okay, why don&#39;t you grab a few bathing suits you like and try them on,” Jake suggests, “then choose the one you like the most and that would be the one I&#39;d buy for you.”<br />
<br />
“Okay, sounds like a good plan,” Jake/”Amber” says, “thanks for not being upset if I choose nothing sexy. As I said, I am not interested in a relationship yet.”<br />
<br />
Jake nods, “I understand,” he says, “besides, we only just met and I am still recovering from the breakup.” The boy smiles, “I just want to be friends with you and maybe... just maybe it could grow into something more,” he says, “but only time will tell, I hope it does, but I will not force you into anything you don&#39;t want.”<br />
<br />
Jeff/”Amber” looks at him, &#39;I feel sorry for this guy,&#39; he thinks to himself, &#39;he looks so hurt and sad. I hope he&#39;ll find his happiness soon.&#39; Jeff has no idea that Jake is a great actor, yes it is true he is hurt and sad, but only because Emma never gave him the chance. Jake himself does not think of himself as a creep, stalker or some psycho, he thinks of himself as a normal guy who just wants a girlfriend. Since it did not work with Emma and after seeing “Amber” and how much she looks like his dream girl, the boy decided to play it wisely and with the help of the app on his phone, he&#39;ll make sure that Amber will become his, but one step at a time. While this is running through Jake&#39;s mind, Jeff grabs a few suits and heads into the changing rooms.<br />
<br />
Jake sits down on a couch near the changing rooms and waits for “Amber” to return, &#39;I wonder what bathing suit she&#39;ll pick,&#39; he thinks to himself, &#39;I hope it is something sexy.&#39;<br />
<br />
After a few minutes the curtain of the changing stall moves to the side and “Amber” steps out, she is wearing a pink bathing suit with a unicorn on the front, “so, what do you think,” she asks.<br />
<br />
Jake looks up and has to hold back a laugh, but his smile says everything, “to be honest, Amber,” he says, “that suit is way to girly, it would rather suit a ten-year-old.”<br />
<br />
“I thought the same,” Amber says, “I just wanted a second opinion,” she adds. Jeff actually does not care what suit he is wearing, but since he has Emma&#39;s body, the boy picture not himself, but his girlfriend wearing the suit. Having a boy&#39;s mind in this situation won&#39;t work out well for Jeff, but the boy does not think about that.<br />
<br />
Jake smiles at “her”, “that is why I am hear: to help you pick the right suit which suits your body the best.”<br />
<br />
Jeff/”Amber” smiles, “well, time to try on the next suit,” she says and reenters the changing stall, closing the curtain. The next suit he tries is to small, Jeff struggles to pull it up his smooth legs, so before he breaks it, he decides to move to the next. When “Amber” reappears, she is wearing a suit with a fish-like-scale pattern with open sides, “what about this one,” he asks, “it is not to sexy and it has a nice pattern and I think it suits my body well.”<br />
<br />
“Much better,” Jake says with a nod, “I really like it, it really looks good on you. Do you have other suits to try?”<br />
<br />
“Yep, one more,” the “girl” says.<br />
<br />
“Okay, try the last suit on and then we&#39;ll decide which is the better one,” Jake says, Jeff agrees and disappears again.<br />
<br />
When “Amber” returns after two minutes she is wearing a similar suit, this suit also has a fish-like-scale pattern, but it also has fins on the sides, sea stars on the breasts and the suit is held up by a collar, the way the straps are connected to the “collar” of the swim suit gives the “girl” a sexy cleavage, parts of her breasts showing. “So, what do you think, Jake,” she asks, “I personally prefer this suit I am wearing.” Jeff of course pictures not himself wearing the suit, he pictures Emma wearing it, having a boy&#39;s mind causes him to think how sexy Emma looks in the suit. The image of his girlfriend wearing the suit causes Jeff to not think rationally and logically.<br />
<br />
Jake looks up and his eyes widen in awe, “wow... yes that is defiantly the one,” he says with a smile, his eyes sparkling, “you look so sexy in it,” he adds.<br />
<br />
Jeff does not notice as he blushes, he only thinks that Jake is confirming what he himself thinks: Emma will look so sexy in the swim suit. The “girl” smiles, “then this will be the suit I&#39;ll be getting,” she says, “let me keep it on, I&#39;ll take the tags off and put on my clothes over it. We&#39;ll then go and pay,” Jake agrees and soon they are heading to the cashier to check out.<br />
<br />
After the cashier scanned the tags and deactivated and dislocated the security device from the suit, “Amber” and Jake exit the store and Jake leads “Amber” to his car. They do not bump into the three other girls, but neither Jake nore Jeff/”Amber” complain, they are both looking forward to get to the beach, but with different thoughts on their minds: Jake looks forward to see “Amber” in her suit, swimming with her and laying side by side on the warm sand after a nice long dip in the cool water, as for Jeff... well, he is only looking forward spending a nice and relaxing day with his new friend on the beach without a certain girlfriend mocking him, he needs a break from her, at least for a few hours.<br />
<br />
Once they arrive at Jake&#39;s car, the boy unlocks it and opens the passenger door for “Amber”, she smiles and thanks him, before getting in. Jake closes the door, smiling wide to himself as he walks around and gets in the driver&#39;s side. The boy starts up the engine and looks over at “Amber”, “do you mind if we stop at my house quickly, so that I can grab some drinks, snacks, towels, a beach ball and an umbrella for us,” he asks, “also I&#39;d need to change into my swimming shorts.”<br />
<br />
“Amber” shakes her head, “not at all, Jake,” she says, Jake smiles and they drive to his house. The “girl” waits in the car, while Jake hurries inside. While waiting for Jake, “Amber” takes out her phone, planning to text Emma where she is and that she&#39;ll meet her back in front of his house later that evening. As he tapes the text he suddenly has second thoughts about it, he looks at the message, his finger hovering over the “send” button, then he looks at the house in which Jake had disappeared into to, then back at the message. &#39;Actually... I am not really in the mood to text her,&#39; he thinks to himself, &#39;besides I am still mad at her for forcing me to become her dress-up-doll. I also think that she has forgotten me anyway, due to having fun with her two girlfriends.&#39; Jeff/”Amber” then decides to not send the message and deletes it, &#39;I&#39;ll just enjoy my time with Jake, he is a cool guy,&#39; he thinks to himself as he puts his phone away. The “girl” then leans back with a smile, waiting for Jake to return, unaware of how the day will unfold.</p>
