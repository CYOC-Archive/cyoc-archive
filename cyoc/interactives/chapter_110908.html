<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The rest of the week went by the same as the last two weeks; Wake up randomly in bed, get ready to workout, overeat at breakfast, over eat at lunch but with liters of soda, WAY overeat at dinner, fall into food coma, Jean cleans me up after carrying me upstairs, tucks me in, and the process repeats itself. However, today was different.<br />
<br />
Brooke woke up at 7:30 on a Tuesday, much earlier than her 10:30 in bed. She entirely skipped her daily online news reading head straight to the bathroom to get ready. Today was the day that she and her 7 other friends planned to go to the beach. They were all new each other very well and were comfortable with one another. Jean walked upstairs to her surprise, finding Brooke so early in the morning.<br />
&quot;What are you doing up so early Brooke? Normally you stay in until its lunch!&quot; Jean asked jokingly.<br />
&quot;Oh yeah I forgot to mention to you that I was going to the beach today if that&#39;s ok with you. I need to get ready and check my bikini if I still fit,&quot; explained Brooke.<br />
&quot;Ah, got it. Let me know if you need me to drive you somewhere or get you breakfast!&quot; said Jean.<br />
&quot;Can&#39;t swim on a heavy stomach Jean.&quot;<br />
As soon as she was finished, Brooke headed to her dresser and dug around to find her old swimsuit. It was your typical bright red two piece swimsuit that had strings to adjust. She looked herself in the mirror to scan herself to guess if she could. Her b cups slowly grew into the kk cups that stood before her. She had ass cheeks that were the size of basketballs, but they weren&#39;t the firm kind that most women with that size had, hers was just plain fat. She shook her waist a tiny bit to find it jiggle a lot. Her stomach was the real deal though. It stuck a bit bast her massive breasts and dropped around her waste. SHelifted it and dropped it, watching it jiggle and bounce around. Her entire body had swelled basically. Brooke sighed started to wear the bikini. She called jean in to help tie as her arms were too fat and her back was too far away. Jean barely managed to tie it as there wasn&#39;t enough string to tie it tightly. Next Brooke put one leg into the bottom piece and new it wasn&#39;t going to fit. Her whole leg was taking up the whole bikini. Luckily it was a bit stretchy, so she managed to stretch it just enough to fit her leg through it. Finally she managed to pull both legs all the way through. She twirled around to check and it managed to hold. That is until 10 seconds later the bikini top burst off along with the bottom. She sighed once more asking Jean to take her to the swim shop.<br />
&quot;Of course sweety,&quot; Jean said feeling a bit for the poor young lady. It was a 20 minute drive there and the shop was fairly empty. Brooke sported her basic t-shirt and and wore a pair of blue sweatpants. She told Jean to wait out here and went on in. It took another 20 minutes of searching to find the perfect looking bikini. It was a deep sky blue color, with bottom piece having 2 gold rings on the side to hold it while the top had the generic triangular shape with fairly thin straps holding onto them, which was all connected by a ring that was slightly bigger than the ones on the bottom piece. However, the bikini only looked good, as it was a tad smaller than the her old bikini. Fortunately for her, these had a much better elasticity that the old ones. So she wrung these up the counters and headed out. <br />
&quot;Found anything you like?&quot; asked Jean?<br />
Brooke took the two piece out and said,&quot;Yup! These look way better don&#39;t you thin? I was going try it in their but there was ony one female dressing room and there were already 2 people in line.&quot;<br />
&quot;Definitely, now let&#39;s head home to try them.&quot;<br />
Brooke walked upstairs to try them on. She put her first leg through the bottom piece and gave a sigh of relief, it went in with fair ease and had a good amount of room for a second leg. She put the second one in and it fit great, minus the small muffin top, she just pulled it over her stomach. The second test was the top, which Jean helped her with. The boob cover was a bit smaller, but fit snuggly nonetheless. Brooke beamed with joy and gave a hug to Jean.<br />
Suddenly Brooke remembered something and asked Jean,&quot;Oh wait I need something small enough to fit in that container on the dining table. Could you make some lunch for me?&quot;<br />
&quot;Of course!&quot; said Jean as she rushed down the stairs. A few minutes later Brooke walked down the stairs expecting some sort of delicious smell or mountains of food. Instead, all Jean brought out were large smoothie bottles filled with a light brown liquid and put them in a large blue cooler, along with other various drinks.<br />
&quot;Hey jean what are these? They kind of smell chocolatey too,&quot; asked Brooke, opening a bottle and sniffing it.<br />
&quot;Yeah it&#39;s just a special shake I made, my own secret recipe. Those are for when you go to the beach, so let me make you one,&quot; Jean said walking into the kitchen. She took the whole fat milk, heavy cream, whipped cream, chocolate syrup, chocolate and vanilla ice cream, regular cream, butter, a bag of sugar, a bigger bag of chocolate, honey, lard, marshmallows fluff and her special ingredient, a giant jug of weight gain powder, chocolate flavor naturally. She turned on the industrial blender poured in as many ingredients as she could while trying to make sure they all got in. She saved a fairly large amount of room for the chocolate and the weight gain powder. She melted the bag down to a gooey state and poured it all in then dumped as much powder as she could into it. The concoction smelled delightful as Jean fingered a taste.<br />
&quot;Just how I like it,&quot; said Jean smiling. She poured it in a large mug and walked out of the kitchen, handing the heavy beverage to Brooke. Brooke took a whiff and then poured it over her mouth waiting for it to fall in. The shake had a consistency of chili and had smooth looking texture.<br />
&quot;Damn, this shake tastes sooo good! What&#39;s in this thing,&quot; asked Brooke as she was downing the whole mug, letting some drip down her chin.<br />
&quot;It&#39;s a secret for a reason Brooke,&quot; she said with a smirk.<br />
&quot;Ok ok... ugh.. but I think I know one of them already,&quot; she groaned hunching over to release a loud fart.<br />
&quot;Oh yeah, I totally forgot!&quot; Jean said said with a crinkled nose and a smack to the forehead.<br />
&quot;I think I should be fine though, I mean it was only a fart. Plus, I can&#39;t resist this stuff!&quot; Brooke said finishing up the rest of her drink. She waited another hour until her friends to came to pick her up, getting 2 more refills of the thick drink meanwhile. Then the doorbell rang. Brooke ran to the door and opened it. Stood there in front of her was her shorter friend Linda, sporting a lime green two piece with a black band on the side of her leg with the brand in the same green color. She was white brunette with a similar body to Brooke&#39;s former skinny self, but had a tiny bit more fat and slightly bigger breasts.<br />
&quot;Woah! Brooke is that you? Holy shit you got fat!&quot; exclaimed Linda. She poked her friend&#39;s petruding belly to only see it jiggle a bit.<br />
&quot;Yeah, my new caretaker is an awesome cook,&quot; Brooke said she adjusted her bikini.<br />
&quot;Well alright then, you got everything miss piggy?&quot; Linda asked with a joking tone. Brooke rolled her eyes and nodded, carrying her large cooler. She walked into her friend&#39;s van only to get a bunch of stares and questions and remarks like &quot;Looks like the beach is going to have a beached whale&quot; or &quot;Careful, you might get some more water weight&quot;. Brooke sighed at them and just laid back on her seat, pulling out a shake from her cooler while letting out a small fart.<br />
Luckily the smell was overpowered by the sweetness and chocolate scent. She was sitting in the way back seat next to her childhood friend Cynthia, who wore a wet suit that went up to her neck, covering her hands and feet. The outside of the suit had a sort of thick rubber texture to it and had blue on her arms and legs, leaving just mostly her waist and stomach with black and the brand on her chest. She was about the same height as Brooke, with long black hair tied into a braid. Her body was more on the chubby side, with smaller breasts than thin Brooke.<br />
Cynthia looked at the smoothie and asked,&quot;Does it taste good? And what&#39;s in it?&quot;<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t know, my caretaker said it was a secret recipe, but it tastes heavenly!&quot; Brooke said getting the remains dripping on the sides of the shake container. &quot;I do know it has chocolate.&quot;<br />
&quot;Doesn&#39;t that make you hella gassy?&quot;<br />
&quot;Tell no one, but do you want some? I have like, 20,&quot; said Brooke picking up two more containers.<br />
Cynthia thought about it for a bit, then finally came to a conclusion. &quot;I think...&quot;</p>
