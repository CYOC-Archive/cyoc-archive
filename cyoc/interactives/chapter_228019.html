<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ashley saw Mary Anne struggle keeping her diaper clean with all her might with worry and tears in her eyes. And so he, now she, walked over to his sister and gave her a hug.  He called out to his mom, &quot;Mom....can you come over here, I&#39;d like one final group hug and I need you to support Mary Anne.  And so, Madame Illusia unfroze Margot who walked over and sort of part hugged and part held Mary Anne in case she fell after &quot;making meatloaf&quot;.  &quot;Mary Anne?  Would it be okay if I counted to three and we pooped together?&quot;, asked Ashley while holding his own bladder and bowels closed.  &quot;But.....you&#39;ll be just like me.....helplessly shitting in your diapers for the rest of eternity!&quot;, pleaded Mary Anne.  Margot then spoke, &quot;Baby, it&#39;s okay, this is what Ashley wants.  We both want you to be happy regardless what this witch does to us.  Don&#39;t you know that I love you?  I took care of you and made sure you were happy as a baby and I promise you I&#39;ll take care of you and make sure you&#39;re happy with an intellectual disability.  Baby, we can still be happy and do things together.  It just means that the things we can do together will be different.  That&#39;s all!&quot;  &quot;I love you both.&quot;, replied Mary Anne,  &quot;Okay, girls, I&#39;ve decided to do the counting instead.  I want you both to take deep breaths and mentally relax yourselves.  I really promise you that I&#39;ll take care of you both and make sure we are a happy family.  Just relax, okay?  Are you both ready for me to do the countdown?&quot;, asked Margot.  Both girls hugged even tighter.  Margot then continued, &quot;Okay, my sweet baby girls.  You might not remember this in another minute, but I want you to know that I really do love you.  I&#39;m going to begin counting down now, I just need you to be relaxed.  One.....Two.....Three!&quot;  It was obvious what both girls did.  The front of Mary Anne&#39;s youth brief turned yellow while the yellow stripe turned blue.  The seat of her brief sunk lower and eventually the brief fell off around her feet as Mary Anne shrank from ten to nine years old.  Mary Anne was struggling to support herself and so Margot slowly lowered her down to the ground to keep her from injuring herself.  It was clear that the girl no longer had a spark of intelligence left in her empty head.  The girl merely grew interested in the nearest thing to her and started poking the feces in the  dirty diaper at her feet  With Mary Anne situated, she turned her attention over to Ashley who also lost her spark of intelligence, though she looked perfectly normal for a three-year-old.  Ashley&#39;s training panties were wrecked.  They were clearly wet and urine was pooling at the child&#39;s feet.  Margot gently lifted the back band of Ashley&#39;s training pants, looked in, and saw a turd making a comfortable home in the seat of Ashley&#39;s pants.  Ashley only said, &quot;Mommy, I had a accident.&quot;  Hugging her former son, Margot said, &quot;I know, baby.  I know.&quot;  What no one noticed was that Morgan did make it to the potty on time.  Sure, there were (more than) a few dribbles of pee and a brown streak in her big-girl panties, but she made poo-poo in the potty like the big girl that she was.  Madame then spoke to the crowd, &quot;Well, it looks like our girls have taken nicely to their new undergarments.  Mary Anne looks like she&#39;s enjoying digging in her diaper and smearing its contents on stage and Ashley here clearly has no intention to potty train any time soon preferring to be a princess potty pants instead.  But, look at Morgan.  She&#39;s definitely the smart one here.  Look at her getting her poopies into the potty on time.  Did you know this was her first time ever using the big-girl potty?  She&#39;s such an example for her siblings.  I know that she&#39;s going to try her best to keep her kitty&#39;s hair bows from disappearing.  I also know that she&#39;ll be a good girl and pay attention to how her cool sensation beginner&#39;s training pants help her figure out that she wet them when they instantly cool when she wets.  Ashley, as a reward for helping your sister out, I&#39;m going to do something nice for you.&quot;, Madame said as she pointed over to the size seven box of diapers near the potties.  One of the potties completely disappeared while the size seven diapers morphed into size four diapers.  In the place of a standing toddler on the box of diapers, another toddler was sitting down legs splayed and laughing.  The diaper still had bunny designs on them, but now they were even more babyish.  This package said that carrots would appear around the bunny to let moms know when their little ones wet.  Madame then turned to Mark, &quot;Guess what?  You&#39;ve got clean up duty!&quot;  Mark clearly didn&#39;t look happy.  his body also moved unnaturally.  He went through each kid changing them.  First, Mary Anne cleaning the poop off of her body before putting her in the fresh youth brief that had been left next to the changing pad.  He then dressed her in her special outfit thankful that at least, it was easy to put her into.  The extra room in the outfit&#39;s rear and gusset had made dressing her a real breeze even though she was wiggling.  In not time he had her zipped up and each zipper closed behind snaps and snug as a bug.  Next, he tackled Ashley, changing her out of her soggy training pants and into a nice dry and comfy size 4 baby diaper where she belonged.  Finally, Mark addressed Morgan.  He gingerly helped her step out of the training pants that were clearly for more advanced trainers, cleaned her, and put on fresh new disposable training pants that was more in tune with her journey at the very beginning of potty training.  He wanted to puke; he wanted to scream; and he wanted to laugh at Ashley.  However, he could do none of that.  Instead, he disposed of the used garments, cleaned out the potty, and cleaned the feces off the stage floor as Madame Illusia directed him.  Finally, a man in the audience shouted, &quot;I&#39;ll take his wife and him as well!&quot;  The woman beside the man in the audience looked horrified and tried to shut him up, but couldn&#39;t.  Madame Illusia had found her next two victims and her savior.  she&#39;d cast her spell forcing all three members of his family up to the stage.  &quot;Madame, I&#39;d rather you make my son a &quot;little man&quot; worthy of being praised by his father than the drug addicted teen that he is right now.  As for my wife, she&#39;s a bitch!  No boy should be without his dog to guide and protect him.  Please, turn my wife into a dog.  I have no need for her, she&#39;s already cheated on me twice.&quot;  Madame searched through the minds of the three newcomers and saw that he was telling the truth.  She also noticed the man&#39;s son sport a boner while staring at the three childrens&#39; bulging padded posteriors.  Does the son want special plastic backed briefs of his own?  Does he want to try his hand at potty training?  Or maybe, he&#39;d prefer eating baby food and trying to figure out how to crawl.  Of course, she also knew that most boys liked breasts.  Maybe he would prefer to have a letter on his padded puffy pants instead of a number while he nurses at his new mommy&#39;s breast?  He would certainly be no trouble if couldn&#39;t figure out how to turn from his back to his tummy or even sit up.  Madame Illusia would have to find out.  Or.....maybe she could ask the son&#39;s father what he&#39;d like to do with his son.  But first, she has a deal with this man and she intends to carry it out.  Before this day is done, Mark will watch his wife get a good fucking right before he gives his first blow job.  But in order to even get to that point, this man needed is ideal slutty trophy wife and a good sexy maid/nanny/cook to look after him and the kids.  Plus.... the benefits the nanny could offer on the side were a bonus for this hard working man.  And then, there&#39;s the money......lots of it.  In addition to the perfect body and eternal life being any age he chooses.</p>
