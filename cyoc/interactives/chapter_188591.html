<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The process of cooking, while simple was something that took a fair amount of time and particularly with regard to the steaks. There were a series of sirloins that the recipe in the book called for and was there in the refrigerator. It was easy to collect them and following the instructions in the cook book and the directions that Kellie had made before she went up to get ready for her evening with Roxie and their friends you were able to find the proper cutting board, cooking pan, and so on to have the steaks ready. Though just as you finished with the seasoning for them, you noted the instruction preheat the oven. You also noted on how long it would take to cook thoroughly in the cookbook, and that was longer than what the book said would be needed to bake the potatoes in the microwave.<br />
<br />
Thankfully, Luna had only just finished washing the potatoes and hadn&#39;t gotten to putting them in the microwave when you&#39;d found that out. The two of you then went about figuring out the oven and getting it up to the right temperature, and Luna was thankfully a big help there after some times where she&#39;d helped bake cookies in the past. The two of you then had only to wait for the steaks to cook and set one separate timer for it to cook. Eventually that did get to a point where the only things left were to bake the potatoes in the microwave and pour the applesauce. The last was the easiest to do as since it was store bought, all Luna had to do was twist the lid and then pour the applesauce into the bowls that she instructed you to get. That all took a little while and by the time you&#39;d both finished discussing what to eat and then got everything prepared and cooked it was a little after six thirty.<br />
<br />
It wasn&#39;t quite like the steaks your dad had cooked, but then he also knew his way around a grill and while you were quite pleased with the fact that you and Luna had managed to cook something without setting the kitchen on fire and having it not be burnt was a victory. The only thing that might have seemed a bit out of place was that the two of you had cooked a fair amount of steak, and actually far more than you normally would eat on your own, even growing up. Yet both of you were eating away at it with no problem and no necessary worries about eating too much. Though as the two of you got about halfway through you looked up to Luna with a question.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shouldn&#39;t we save some for your mom and Roxie?&quot; you asked her.<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; Luna answered, &quot;If they&#39;re going out for the evening... they&#39;ll likely eat out and assuming there isn&#39;t any real traffic will get back around ten or eleven and will have to transform shortly after their return.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So stuff like this has happened before?&quot; you asked before lifting a fork with a piece of the sirloin impaled on the points. It looked tiny compared to your larger size in your MILF-wolf form, but it was what it was and you weren&#39;t really ashamed by it.<br />
<br />
&quot;That mom and dad would have a girls&#39; night out?&quot; Luna answered, &quot;Yeah... this has happened before. The present issue with the Wolf Hunters is new... and admittedly I&#39;m still a bit worried about that, but this isn&#39;t the first girls&#39; night my parents have had on a Full Moon night, let alone other nights.&quot;<br />
<br />
The two of you resumed eating and it wasn’t too long before the two of you finished, though there were some things that did consume some time. One was the nature of how your jaws worked while transformed. Since your sharpened teeth weren’t designed to cut and your long fangs in your MILF-wolf form interlocked, you could only “chew” in a straight up and down motion and it was more that you moved pieces of the steak in your mouth with your tongue to slice them into smaller pieces. Eventually they were small enough to swallow. Some things might have looked a bit odd, like a tall muscular, middle aged looking wolf-woman eating potatoes or applesauce, but then stories and reports seemed to indicate that while werewolves tended to remain predators and preferred meat, they were still human at heart and thus needed what humans needed for a balanced diet. Thus you and Luna ate them, and they went down in much the same way the steak went down… though the potatoes went down with a taste of butter on your tongue.<br />
<br />
“Well, that was good,” Luna smiled as the two of you finished and stretched her back for a moment, “perfect for a pair of MILF-wolves getting a new start together.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah…” you nodded, “in some ways… that’s all part of things that have been so wonderful in all of this. You loving me… and wanting to turn me… that’s… it’s all something that I probably would have only imagined in dreams. You wanting to get pregnant was new… but… if that’s all that it took to make me what I am now and to see you smile… I’m glad for it in a way. It’s all like magic and I never want it to end.”<br />
<br />
&quot;And hopefully it never does,&quot; Luna smiled as the two of you then stood up and began moving things toward the sink.<br />
<br />
The two of you carried your plates over to the sink and placed them in and it wasn&#39;t long before Luna was running hot water to rinse the plates and knives and forks that we used. That all worked well and it wasn&#39;t long before that was done and you looked back to the small table in the Vaxer family&#39;s kitchen where you and Luna had just eaten. The monopoly board and pieces had been moved to a counter that had been away from where the two of you had been cooking in order for the both of you to eat. There were two empty glasses that were there, but you figured to leave them there as they would allow for you have something to drink later. Your ears also moved on a bit of a swivel and you thought you heard some footsteps or things upstairs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Did your mom and Roxie go out?&quot; you asked to Luna as you glanced to her.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t think so,&quot; Luna answered, &quot;I didn&#39;t see anyone go out while we were eating...&quot; she paused for a moment and looked to a wall clock, &quot;and given that it&#39;s only seven twenty now, it&#39;s doubtful that their guests have arrived. Remember, mom said she they would be heading out at around eight. That&#39;s still forty minutes away.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh,&quot; you said slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;In the meantime... we can brush our teeth and you can bring in your brush and toothpaste and make sure all of that is handled so that way when our fun begins for the evening...we won&#39;t be licking dinner into each other&#39;s feet,&quot; Luna then finished.<br />
<br />
You nodded and followed along, though as you passed the doorway into the living room, you caught up to Luna and wrapped one arm around her shoulder. She smiled and returned the favor. It made ascending the stairs a bit of a tight squeeze as the stairway hadn&#39;t necessary been built for two people to go side by side, particularly when considering that both you and Luna were even bigger in MILF-wolf form than in your human form. But you managed. You only had to part when you got to the top of the stairs and then began moving to set about some of your respective responsibilities. You gathered up your things from your bag in yours and Luna&#39;s room before returning to the bathroom before getting started on brushing your teeth, which was a bit different in that your teeth were different, but Luna was there and doing the same, so you managed.<br />
<br />
When the two of you came out, you came across both Kellie and Roxie coming down the hall and looking ready for a formal night out. Kellie wore a sleeveless black dress that came down to her knees, but hugged her own curves rather tightly and allowed for the upper part of her breasts to be seen, though most of them were underneath the dress&#39;s fabric. Roxie wore a dark blue dress which wasn&#39;t as tight as Kellie&#39;s, but it had a low enough neckline that you and Luna could know that Roxie was just as curvy as Kellie was. The two of them smiled to you and Luna as they approached.<br />
<br />
&quot;So how did dinner go?&quot; Kellie asked to you and Luna.<br />
<br />
&quot;It went great!&quot; Luna said with pride.<br />
<br />
&quot;At least so far as two first timers can be concerned,&quot; you added with a weaker smile, but both Kellie and Roxie smiled in response.<br />
<br />
&quot;And you&#39;ll get better with time and practice,&quot; Roxie smiled, &quot;in some ways, just like Kellie and I did way back when we moved out of our parent&#39;s houses after college...&quot;<br />
<br />
You and Luna nodded and then proceeded to follow Kellie and Roxie going down the stairs. Once there the two of them settled down on the couch and sat together, as if to wait. By now, according to the VCR clock on the entertainment center it was about seven forty-seven and that had you wondering.<br />
<br />
&quot;So... where are you and your friends going on this girls&#39; night out?&quot; you wondered, &quot;anything fun?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A lot of it would be like going out on a formal date,&quot; Kellie answered, &quot;we&#39;ll go out to eat and talk on various things that have gone on. Updates from them on what&#39;s going on in their new town and we can give them the updates on things that have happened here. Like our baby girl growing up and taking her mate.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Though you&#39;ll be careful to avoid anything that would draw attention, right?&quot; Luna asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course, Luna,&quot; Roxie smiled, &quot;we want to be there to walk you and Nicki down the aisle... unless her dad wants to walk her at the wedding. We want to be there when you give birth to yours and Nicki&#39;s daughter. We wouldn&#39;t do anything that would alert any Wolf Hunters in the area to us.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good,&quot; Luna said firmly and then moved to hug both Kellie and Roxie, &quot;because Nicki and I will want you there to be there too.&quot;</p>
