<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ribee now going by Stew for the couple of months he&#39;d be under cover was in his dorm room. Ribee simply had a bunch of clothes that he&#39;d bought with Athena, a laptop made by Doctor Doctor, phone, wallet... and that thing that was now in his pants. Ribee had examined himself as this was the body he&#39;d be stuck in for awhile, but the fact that he had a six pack and was decently muscled would force him to go to a gym regularly... or he may seem out of place without any weights or anything.<br />
<br />
Ribee sat up from his bed and thought to himself &quot;Well I guess I should go to walk around campus... I already blew off the meet and greet. I guess I&#39;ll walk around campus... and familiarize myself with where the professor&#39;s living space is.&quot; Opening up his door the young man walked out as Stew, the college freshmen who doesn&#39;t know what he wants to major in... Who took a hero class as an elective for an easy A. He could walk the walk and being a magical girl in a highly active city gave him a rather confident posture.<br />
<br />
...let&#39;s see... there&#39;s a communal kitchen, lounge... bathroom with showers... Stew would have to use them eventually, so better make peace with that... And all the guys in the hot steamy showers right next to.... Then Strew found something odd in his head. His mind was trying to evade the images of other guy&#39;s dicks, and then curious remembered back to the dressing room with the rest of the magical girls back when they were 16 or 17 or so... and found he was getting a little chubby down there, especially around fish and their missions out in the rivers with her nice and wet... Stew slapped his cheeks, stupid male brain making him all horny over his magical girl sisters. <br />
<br />
A little bit later Stew found the room of the professor who stole his father&#39;s relic. The room was relatively close to the communal lounge making it hard to sneak in. Either he&#39;d be sleeping inside or someone would probably be around the lounge. Looking out of the window the sun was starting to set... Well time to make some food right? Stew went out and bought a few ingredients to cook in the communal kitchen with. His guess the amount of bachelors using anything other than the microwave should be close to zero. The ingredients were nice and simple as she brought them back to the kitchen as she saw a bunch of guys lining up to use about 3 microwaves. Meanwhile Stew went to the stove counter prepared to make something simple and fast. <br />
<br />
Stew took out a cutting knife, a cutting board, a rubber spatula, and a pan along with the groceries which included a few plastic plates and cutlery. After quick rinse and chop for some green onions Stew cracked open some eggs into the pan after spraying with some cooking oil into it. Then as he broke the yolks and stirred added in a few some onions she had cut up along with some pre-cut ham. It was a quick omelet that would be making Oracle give him a text later asking if he had forgotten all the cooking lessons she had given Ribee, but considering where he was Stew thought Oracle could give him a break. At the very least a bunch of the guys in line was staring at the actually cooked food.<br />
<br />
Quick clean up and putting her large omelet on a plate Stew found that some guy with sandy blonde hair and brown eyes on the other side of the table with a cup of instant noodles. The guy stretched out the hand and said &quot;Name&#39;s Roy.&quot; <br />
Stew went for the handshake and said &quot;I&#39;m Stew... What want some of that chopped ham I didn&#39;t finish?&quot; <br />
Roy said &quot;I wouldn&#39;t mind having some to munch on, but I was wondering how well you can cook?&quot; Stew thought Roy here was being a bit weird and thus tried to find some betrayal of ill intent. Was it even possible his cover was already blown?<br />
Stew said &quot;Well my mom didn&#39;t want me eating nothing but junk at college... So she made me learn how to cook all sorts of things. What want me to be your personal chef.&quot; <br />
Roy clapped his hands together and said &quot;Yes, I&#39;ve got a decent food budget and considering cooking meals tends to be cheaper than eating out... How about you cook, and I pay for the food? Meanwhile we can connect and maybe make one friendship or connection our freshman year?&quot; Stew had eaten an eight of his omelet during Roy&#39;s spiel. <br />
&quot;I guess? Would be nice to save a little money.&quot; <br />
&quot;Great! how about we finish up and then I&#39;ll show you to my dorm room.&quot; Turns out when two guys just eat poultry meals they tend to get through them pretty fast. Stew put the remaining cut ham into the fridge expecting it to magically disappear at some point, and calmly went with Roy to his room. Roy closed his dorm door showing a pretty undecorated room. Just a desk, a small laptop, a suitcase, and a bed. Door shut Roy grabbed and slammed Stew&#39;s head into the bedpost as he got out a butterfly knife pointed at Stew&#39;s neck.  &quot;Alright, who the fuck are you and why are you at this college?&quot; Stew expected that Roy thought that the head slam or knife to actually be threatening or do anything, but the same magic could be used to support/enhance her muscles or just shield her body in general. Sure if Roy had tried this with super strength or a couple of years ago this may have been concerning, but Stew was able to block the damage from the slam and if Roy actually tried to stab Stew the knife would break. <br />
Stew asked &quot;May I ask who you even are?&quot; pretending to be in pain. <br />
Roy said &quot;Hey I&#39;m the one calling the shots! Now why are you here?&quot; <br />
Stew said &quot;I&#39;m here finding a stolen relic.&quot; <br />
Roy banged Stew&#39;s head ineffectively against the bedpost again and said &quot;What&#39;s this about the relic?&quot;<br />
&quot;Professor Sterling stole it from an explorer expedition. I was hired to retrieve it.&quot; Ribbons started tying around Roy&#39;s limbs. Roy concerned attempted to slash Stew&#39;s neck only to find it not connecting with any flesh, but with some magic force.<br />
&quot;Wait these... Are you Red 6? How?&quot; The ribbons started wrapping around Roy&#39;s body constricting his movements before he was completely. <br />
Stew said &quot;So then... Who are you?&quot; <br />
Roy took a breath and said &quot;Agent 93842, recently dispatched for reconnaissance. For some reason I&#39;ve been able to sense powers and magic. There&#39;s an unusual number of powered people, and I was sent to find them, find why they&#39;re here, and then act accordingly. You had an oddly strong power to you. I thought I could capture you if I took you off guard... Guess not hero to be.&quot; <br />
Stew gave a text to Dr. Doctor to see if the Agent&#39;s story was true and said &quot;Well, if you are telling the truth then we could help each other. I&#39;m trying to figure out what Professor Sterling is doing with a relic, and you can keep checking on Supers. You may be able to help me with my goal and you got strong backup with me around.&quot; The Doctor was on point and was able to get the info back, there was an agent deployed with the same numbers fitting a description of the young man Red 6 had bound up. <br />
Roy asked &quot;So then... Can you get me out of these?&quot; Stew released her magic bonds and then Roy continued &quot;So... your Red 6, how are you even a guy?&quot; <br />
Stew said &quot;Oh just got to know how to push the right buttons with the right people. Does this make you uncomfortable?&quot; <br />
Roy grinned and said &quot;Oh I was just imagining what my parents would think. The first girl I brought to my room was actually a guy.&quot; <br />
Stew said &quot;Honestly I didn&#39;t expect the first time I was in a guy&#39;s room I&#39;d be doing bondage but there we were. So do we have a deal to assist?&quot; Roy nodded as the two worked out details and gave contact information.</p>
