<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">In his sleep, Matt didn&#39;t really know what was happening with him. When he was furthest away from Earth, barely noticing anything outside of his dream, he still managed to feel sharp pains in his legs and stomach. Meanwhile his body was changing, but not properly.<br />
<br />
What was supposed to be a complete change, of Matt turning into a woman, the Chronivac only saved a small portion of what was supposed to happen. The program saved bit by bit, scanning the edited figure on the screen, the female 3D-figure Matt had created the evening before. It scanned from bottom to the top, starting with its toes, advancing to mid-section, and finishing at the head. But somewhere in the mid-section, the Chronivac program had a failure in its commands, making it complete the save halfway through already. What happened next still was a phenomenon, and something that had never been created before.<br />
<br />
About 2 hours since Matt had gone to sleep, he was in his deepest stages, and violently moving in his sleep. It was only his upper body though, since subconsciously, he wasn&#39;t able to move his legs, nor did he feel them. These pains, muscle spasms mostly, started at only his toes, but slowly advanced more upwards, to his midsection. It gave him a burning feeling, as his dream projected it as being in a fire. In his sleep he was sweating heavily,  he had a nightmare. This burning feeling was at its highest point as it reached his crotch, somehow not advancing upward anymore, but some more inward, to his stomach. A feeling of nausea overcame him as it felt like a new organ was being formed underneath his stomach, bringing the last named under pressure. This was where it ended however, the feeling slowly subsided and a sudden rush of him being able to feel his legs again woke him up.<br />
<br />
Matt opened his eyes as he woke up from his nightmare. He was dreaming about saving people from a fire, but getting caught in it himself before anyone was even rescued. Without anyone finding him in the burning structure, he was slowly losing the burning feeling, making his brain project it as if he was dying. Then with a sudden breeze of some sort, where he regained his feeling again in his legs, he woke up, luckily.<br />
<br />
Matt took a deep breath. He was covered with sweat, but it wasn&#39;t much of a problem. He was somehow more tired than he was when he went asleep, even though he&#39;d slept for a few hours already. Looking at the clock, it confirmed his thoughts. It was still early in the night, only 2:44 AM. He turned around his pillow to the somewhat cooler side, and lied down again. He checked the alarm on his phone, which showed he had to wake up at 8 AM to attend a lecture at university. As an art student, he might as well take his computer with him, the Chronivac included, to show to his friends. With that thought, he fell asleep again.<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
The alarm sounded, trying to make Matt notice it with a loud sound blaring from it. Matt reacted quickly. He grabbed his phone and silenced the alarm. Compared to when he woke up in midnight, he was actually quite well-rested. Not really having to hurry -his class started at 11 AM, he just wanted to wake up at 8 AM to take his time preparing the few things he needed-, He put on some jogging pants and a vest over his pajamas and walked out of his room.<br />
<br />
The first thing he came across was his small office, the computer standing on his desk. The Chronivac program was still open, so he sat down on his chair and looked at how it went. To his disappointment, an error notice had appeared on the screen, showing that the device hadn&#39;t saved the model properly. Looking at the model, he saw himself again, with his pajama clothes on. Putting aside that his jogging pants and vest had suddenly appeared on the screen somehow, Matt concluded from seeing himself on the screen that there was no trace of his created model left anymore. 3 hours of work for nothing. But it had to wait. He first wanted to wake up, and nothing would help better than a fresh cup of coffee.<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
Once the coffee was prepared, Matt poured it into a mug and brought it with him to his office. He wanted to take a closer look on what exactly had happened with the 3D-model he spent so much time on. It would be a stupid program if it wasn&#39;t even able to save the character he made, had it at least created a backup?<br />
<br />
Looking through a couple of tabs, Matt found nothing. All there was left was the model of himself on the screen again. What caught his eye, was that there were two layers on his model, giving him a last bit of hope that the Chronivac might still have saved the model. What caught him by surprise was how it just made the clothes on his model vanish for a bit. Had he remembered that, he wouldn&#39;t have undone himself from the layer. A small detail was missing this time though. Where was his member?<br />
<br />
On Matt&#39;s screen he saw himself, but the dick randomly had vanished! It even made it look a bit laughable, as Matt grinned, seeing himself without his crotch. On a closer look however, he did see something else. Apparently, this new program had experienced a failure, making his 3D-model overlap the female version of his 3D-model. It now had a vagina instead of a penis! Matt let out a laugh, as he concluded furthermore that the model&#39;s legs had thinned out a bit, while its ass had gotten more plump. He concluded out of this, that the two models had overlapped, the male version ironically being on top, while the female version made up the lower half of his body.<br />
<br />
The sound of his mobile phone distraught him. It was Roy, a friend of his, so not to be rude, he slid his finger to the right, and put the phone to his ear. &quot;Hey Roy, what&#39;s up?&quot; Matt asked. &quot;Good morning Matt, I was just calling to ask if you were going to attend the lecture today,&quot; Roy answered, &quot;It seems like it isn&#39;t exactly necessary, and a waste of 2 hours in which you could help me out moving my stuff to your apartment.&quot; <br />
<br />
That was right, Roy was going to move into his apartment soon, so he would have to share some space. They&#39;d planned to already, since there was more than enough room for it. A room was still empty even, or at least cleaned up, because since Matt already knew Roy would move in, he made some space. &quot;Alright, but I&#39;ll only arrive at 12 in the afternoon then, I want to take my time for this, since we have all day to do so.&quot; Matt answered. &quot;Then that&#39;s decided,&quot; Roy followed, &quot;promise you&#39;ll be there then, my parents want me out as soon as possible.&quot; Matt laughed at that joke, it was a bit cliché, but truth be told, they were very serious about it, last time Matt and Roy&#39;s parents talked about him moving into his apartment.<br />
<br />
As Matt put down the phone, he shut off his new computer program, and stood up from his chair. &quot;First things first, a shower&quot;.<br />
<br />
Taking a few clean clothes from his closet, New shorts, a fancy shirt and some regular blue jeans, he entered the bathroom. As he was still living by himself, he didn&#39;t exactly bother about closing the door, it more or less became a habit. Turning on the shower, he began to strip, facing the mirror.<br />
<br />
When finished with his vest and pajama shirt, he went on with his pants, water flowing behind him. Having a bit of an itch at his crotch, he scratched it for a bit, but in his surprise, he pulled away his hand again. Expecting to make contact with his dick, through the fabric of his shorts, he somehow didn&#39;t feel it. Even after seconds of pretty much groping his nether regions, all he felt was an almost flat surface. To make matters worse, he felt a hint of arousal and excitement after he&#39;d scratched himself a bit more thoroughly. His heartbeat increased, as he tried to think of what was happening. Pulling up his shorts to his belly button, not even a slight bulge appeared.<br />
<br />
Matt thought back to how his model looked before he last closed off the program on which it stood. It was himself, but with the lower legs, even lower body, of that of a woman. &quot;Could it be?&quot; He thought. His heart-rate shot up, and adrenaline levels increased as he slowly lowered his shorts of his private region, still paying close attention to where his dick was supposed to be. When his eyes Matt the spot, they widened, in surprise.<br />
<br />
What Matt saw, wasn&#39;t a dick. It was a flattened surface, with a hole between the beginning of the two recognizable pubic lips of a woman. It wasn&#39;t a pussy, just the hole a woman pees from, but it was quite a sight nonetheless. It wasn&#39;t the only hole though. Matt set himself down onto the ground, now for the first time recognizing the feeling of his now more rounded and plump butt, sticking out in comparison to the rest of his body. Trying to bend his midsection a bit more towards him self, his head now resting on one of his female knees. His heartbeat shot up once more, Matt feeling his pulse in every vein of his body. He was confronted by a pussy, attached to his, mostly male body, or at least male upper body.<br />
<br />
Somehow, whether it was madness or not, Matt felt fear, but also found some of this kind of magic somewhat kinky. It had a naughty side to it, making him want to test, how this worked...<br />
<br />
Matt stood up and walked into his shower. He didn&#39;t want to waste too much time in it. He quickly took out his shampoo and shower gel and washed himself. Using a lap made out of sponge to wash himself with, he also met his crotch. The burning feeling of excitement, -he probably even was horny- distraught him a bit, but he quickly finished showering, so he had more than enough time to try himself out...</p>
