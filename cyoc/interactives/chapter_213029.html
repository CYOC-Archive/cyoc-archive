<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Swear to the gods, if someone is there and up to no good, I know how to use this axe.&quot; The deep voice continued. Alex gulped and abandoned any plans of thievery, not if that massive hulk was going to chase him down. Instead he stepped out from around the corner of the farm house, his hands up showing he truly had not a stitch on him. The farmer took one look at him and lowered the axe to his side, obviously a little confused. Alex could feel those blue eyes taking in every inch of him and felt himself start blushing.<br />
<br />
He opened his mouth, ready to tell his pre-thought lie of being mugged but under that gaze he felt the truth spilling out of him. &quot;I&#39;m sorry. I don&#39;t know where I am, I woke up in the woods and followed the road. I heard you chopping wood and.. you&#39;re the first person I&#39;ve seen.&quot; Alex took a deep breath after the rush of words. The farmer had stepped close enough for Alex to tell he was only level with the man&#39;s shoulders, putting him somewhere between 6&#39;6&quot; and 6&#39;8&quot; if he had his guess. Alex could also smell him, earthy, musky, with the smell of fresh clean sweat. He quickly had to change his thoughts to keep from getting visibly aroused. It didn&#39;t work.<br />
<br />
The farmer snorted and shook his head. &quot;Not that I believe you, but I know someone in need of help when I see it. Best come inside, I&#39;ll get you some food and maybe something to cover up.&quot; The maybe had an almost mischievous tone to it and came with a half smile that indicated he had noticed Alex&#39;s arousal. That smile did not help. Despite the slightly inhuman features Alex was finding the man quite good looking. &quot;Name&#39;s Cael.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alex.&quot; He offered back as he suddenly found himself trailing in Cael&#39;s wake to the front door of the farm house. It was homey inside,  warmed by the fire on the hearth with a good smell coming from the lidded pot that hung over it. Cael hung the axe on the wall near a collection of other tools and motioned to a table surrounded by a few solid wooden chairs. Doors led off to other rooms, but this central living space was large and spacious, enough that several people could hang around, cooking, eating, or relaxing. While the furniture was a tad on the large side and sturdily built, he was thankful it didn&#39;t make him feel like a child sitting in it.<br />
<br />
Cael served up a bowl of the stew on the fire and placed it down in front of Alex with a spoon. &quot;Yer in luck, I was just about to have lunch.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks.&quot; Alex&#39;s tone must have had some skepticism in it, that Cael waved off.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure thing. Always be hospitable to travelers in need. Never know if it&#39;s a god or magical creature in disguise, testing you.&quot; Cael winked and laughed softly, though not enough to say he didn&#39;t entire disbelieve those stories. &quot;Let me see if I can wrangle you up something to wear.&quot; As Cael vanished through one of the doors, Alex dug into the stew. He hadn&#39;t realized how hungry he was, and he was grateful to discover the vegetables were at least familiar, even if he had some questions about the meat.<br />
<br />
Cael reappeared just as Alex was scaping the last few morsels out of the bowl, holding some folded clothes and even a pair of clean, if very well-worn boots. &quot;You&#39;re lucky Roy just had a growth spurt, just out grew these but they should fit you just fine.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alex accepted the bundle with a gracious nod. Cael served himself some stew as Alex got dressed, though he had the distinct feeling the other man was watching him as he fumbled with some of the unfamiliar laces, taking a moment to figure out the older style of clothing. They were still a bit on the baggy side, but definitely fit better than anything on the line would have. As he settled his feet into his boots, Cael was grinning slightly, maybe he thought Alex had been putting on a show for him. &quot;Is there anyway I can repay you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Cael shook his head. &quot;Nah, those were probably going to go to a neighbor once one of their kids got big enough anyways. Though...&quot; Cael tapped his finger on the table as he finished off his own stew. &quot;If yer headed into town you ain&#39;t gonna make it by nightfall, and unless I missed something you got nothing on you to pay for a room at the inn.&quot; Alex shook his head, confirming the words. &quot;I can feed you some dinner and provide you a place to sleep if you don&#39;t mind a little farm work. Even pay you for yer time. My pas should be back from the city market in a few days, and I&#39;ll take you into town myself when they&#39;re back.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I, um, I guess that would be best. Never done farm work before.&quot; Alex admitted with a little hesitancy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Couldn&#39;t tell.&quot; Cael said jokingly as he reached out and clapped Alex on the shoulder. &quot;You got city boy written all over you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Your pas won&#39;t mind some stranger being here with them gone?&quot; He asked, catching on the plural there, suddenly curious.<br />
<br />
Cael just shook his head. &quot;Nah, so long as farm work is getting done. Hells, they&#39;re pushing me to find some guy to settle down with, make some boys so they can relax some and let the next generation get on with the farming.&quot; He said with a grin, then waved a hand quickly in Alex&#39;s direction. &quot;Not that I&#39;m suggesting anything, just saying they won&#39;t mind a little extra help around for a few days.&quot; He stood up and went over to a cupboard, rummaging around inside of it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Find a guy and make some boys?&quot; Alex asked, which only got a nod from Cael. What sort of weird world was he in? <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, even if Dicktin is near the border, it&#39;s mostly a human town. Us mixed bloods can have trouble, especially those with orc blood.&quot; He said, motioning to himself. &quot;Roy, my little brother will have an easier time I&#39;m guessing. We&#39;re both quarter orc, but he looks mostly human, I got hit hard with the orc blood, and while plenty of the village guys don&#39;t mind messing around with the big muscly orcblood, starting a family with one is another thing. My one pa, the half-orc one got lucky with my other pa. I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll find someone someday.&quot; He pulled out a dusty bottle and blew on it to clear off the dust before setting it down on the table. &quot;Here, drink up.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alex picked up the bottle and looked at it. &quot;What is it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Vigor potion.&quot; Cael said, nodding at the bottle. &quot;Sometimes we use them around harvest if we need a little more oomph, pa&#39;s been using them more in recent years, sometimes I think more for the side effects but..&quot; He shrugged. &quot;It&#39;ll wear off in a couple of days, and without it you&#39;ll be useless tomorrow. We&#39;re gonna stack up all that wood I chopped, then haul in some river stones to fix some spots in the wall in the grazing field. Those arms ain&#39;t gonna do it.&quot; The orcblood grinned to take some of the sting out of those words, but Alex knew he was skinny, and had been skipping the gym. &quot;You can trust me, ain&#39;t gonna harm someone I just fed, bad manners.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alex held up the bottle, the liquid inside swirling blue and green. He popped the cork expecting it to smell medicinal, instead a fragrant smell like trees in the rain hit his nostrils. With a quick toast to Cael, he tipped the potion back and drank it. It tasted like maple syrup and apple juice, not at all unpleasant. Cael was watching expectantly, even leaning forward a bit.<br />
<br />
It started with a gurgling in his stomach, causing him to lean forward. IT sounded like it should be painful, instead it was just warm. He let out a soft groan as the warmth spread throughout his entire body. He felt buzzed, almost electric, like he just downed a pot of coffee but without the jitters. His clothes felt suddenly tight, or was that his skin? Or both? He could feel his muscles expanding, feel it in his arms as they swelled with potion enhanced strength, the short sleeves of his borrowed tunic now comfortably snug around his upper arms as he stared at the newly grown muscle in disbelief. His pants too were snug around his thighs which had similarly beefed up. He hunched over again as the warmth settled on his core and faded away. With an eagerness he was almost ashamed to show in front of another guy he peeled up the front of his shirt, displaying a six pack and an obvious pair of pectorals on his previously flat chest. He wasn&#39;t at the level of the gym rat frat boys from his college, but he wouldn&#39;t look out of place on the swim team.<br />
<br />
&quot;To bad this one doesn&#39;t literally put hair on your chest. You&#39;d look good with some fuzz.&quot; Cael said, obviously admiring the sight in front of him despite the comment. Alex blushed and let his shirt drop, unaccustomed to feeling the way the garment hugged his chest. He wondered at the younger brother who had outgrown these clothes, since they seemed to fit him perfectly now. &quot;You&#39;re stronger than you look, too. The muscle growth is really just a side effect. You&#39;ll have no problem keeping up now. Though make sure you eat more than usual, or when it wears off you&#39;ll pass out for a day or two. It uses up a lot of fuel.&quot;<br />
<br />
The orcblood got to his feet and started walking to the door. &quot;C&#39;mon, day&#39;s wasting.&quot; Alex got to his feet, feeling more solid and heavy than he ever had before in his life. Taking a moment to adjust, he then quickly followed after.</p>
