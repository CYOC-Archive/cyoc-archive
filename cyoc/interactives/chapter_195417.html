<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“So, how are your classes going?” Milo asked as he and Dare returned to the dorm once afternoon classes were over.<br />
<br />
“Just a bunch of boring stuff. Child psychology for Educational Foundations, lots of history for Inter-Species Relations…” Dare sighed tossing his backpack onto the floor and collapsing into his bed. He looked up at Milo and blushed a bit. He’d had something he wanted to ask Milo for a while now. A personal question that he wasn’t sure how Milo would answer…<br />
<br />
“H-hey, Milo?”<br />
<br />
“Hmm? What’s up Dare?” Milo replied, sitting down on his bed and pulling out his camera to check his most recent photos.<br />
<br />
“This is probably gonna sound weird, but…” Dare gulped. This was the big moment. Dare took a deep breath and…<br />
<br />
“…You don’t mind if I jerk off, do you?”<br />
<br />
Milo looked up from his camera, a look of complete disbelief on his face.<br />
<br />
“Are you asking me permission?” he said slowly, wondering what on earth Dare was up to. “I don&#39;t really care, I guess. Did you really care about my opinion on it?”<br />
<br />
“I dunno, I guess I didn’t want to feel like I was back at that boarding school. You know, trying to jack off under the covers while pretending you aren’t, and your roommate had to pretend he doesn’t notice,” Dare explained, pulling out his claw clipper and laying back on his bed to trim at the claws that had begun to sprout on his toes. “’It’s not gay if nobody says anything’, you know? Didn’t they have anything like that at those orphanages you grew up in?”<br />
<br />
“State homes. And I didn’t have a roommate, I had room<i>mates</i>. Plural. It would take a lot of negotiating or a lot of stealth to jerk off without at least one of the 9 others in the room getting really annoyed at you,” Milo replied. “So, what are you saying? You want me to just stare at the wall?”<br />
<br />
“You can stare wherever you want. You’ve already taken pictures of my ass, and we’ve already spooned a couple times, so I’ve got nothing to hide,” Dare replied, giving his claws a look-over before nodding approvingly. “So, if you never got a chance to do it in your room, how did you do it?”<br />
<br />
“Quickly,” Milo responded bluntly. “And rarely.”<br />
<br />
“Fuck, that sucks, pig! You gotta treat yourself nice, otherwise what’s even the point?” Dare laughed. He teasingly lowered his pants and boxers while still laying on his back, letting his cock flop out and smack him in the belly. “Well, I’m gonna enjoy myself a little bit. You can play around with your camera or whatever. Just no taking pictures of this, got it?”<br />
<br />
Milo snorted at that, making his snout flare. Out of the corner of his eye, he noticed that the fuzzy patch of pubic hair around Dare’s cock had turned jet-black to match the rest of his new fur. <i>That or he was dyeing his hair blond… Black looks better on him, anyway</i>, Milo thought to himself as he watched Dare begin to stroke himself slowly. Milo saw Dare’s eyes occasionally sneaking a glance over at him as he started to pick up the pace. The meaning of the look was clear: ‘<i>Come on, go for it. We’re all guys here, after all</i>.’<br />
<br />
“…Fine. Have it your way, Dare,” Milo sighed, stripping off his shirt and showing off the thick, bristly fur that had started dusting his chest. The half-changed boar’s nipples peeked out of the dense brown fur, making Dare bite his lip and let out a little moan as he imagined teasing his roommate’s tits with his tongue. Dare’s breathing hastened as Milo began to pull off his own pants and boxers, and soon Dare couldn’t keep his eyes off of Milo’s naked body as a flash of memory blinked into his head.<br />
<br />
<i>Sneaking away from the rest of the family, opening up his new laptop. His little brothers and his sister were off outside, playing with their friends. He would never get caught. He opened up a porn site, typed in B-O-A-R to the search engine, and-</i><br />
<br />
Dare had to struggle to pull himself back to the present, focusing entirely on the sexy boar specimen currently starting to pleasure himself on the bed across from him. Milo lay back on his back and began to stroke off, and before long both him and Dare were filling the room with the wet sounds of masturbation. Dare could hear Milo’s hands moving quickly up and down his wet cock, as well as a soft snorting noise as the boar got closer and closer to cumming.<br />
<br />
“You gotta… s-slow down,” Dare panted, squeezing his eyes shut. “You’re gonna waste it, pig…”<br />
<br />
“I told you… I’m used to going fast…” Milo snorted, backing off a bit to keep himself from cumming too early.<br />
<br />
“I don’t gotta teach you how to do it, do I?” Dare teased, sitting up in bed and looking over at Milo with a smirk on his face.<br />
<br />
“Dare, what are you-“<br />
<br />
In a flash, Dare had jumped up from his bed and was right on top of Milo, staring right into his eyes and breathing heavily. Dare had no clue why he’d done it. His feet were moving before his mind even had a chance to catch up. He looked down at Milo’s cock and raised an eyebrow.<br />
<br />
“Still hasn’t changed, huh? I know pigs have twisty dicks…” Dare murmured, seeing a more-or-less human penis between Milo’s legs.<br />
<br />
“A-and how do you know that, Dare?” Milo asked, still wondering what Dare was up to.<br />
<br />
“A guy I knew in high school was a pig, saw it a few times in the locker room,” Dare said off-handedly. Milo began to respond, but Dare cut him off. “Yeah, I know it’s a fake memory. Doesn’t matter, I know what they look like, okay?”<br />
<br />
“…Why are you telling me this?” <br />
<br />
Dare didn’t answer. He just pressed his cock right against Milo’s, then he wrapped his hand around both of them and started to slowly pump up and down, letting their dicks rub against one another and feeling their pre mix together. Milo threw his head back and let out a quiet snort, amazed at the feeling of Dare’s soft paw-pads against his dick. At the feeling of his roommate’s slightly cold and carefully trimmed claws just barely touching him with every stroke.<br />
<br />
“D-Dare, what’s gotten into you…?” Milo said through gritted teeth.<br />
<br />
“You want me to stop?” Dare replied, picking up the pace of his strokes and earning a loud groan of pleasure from Milo.<br />
<br />
“No, but… Fuck, that feels amazing,” Milo grunted. “…But you’re gonna explain yourself as soon as this is done…”<br />
<br />
“Deal.”<br />
<br />
Without another word, Dare gripped their cocks together even tighter. Milo could feel Dare’s heartbeat through the pulse of his roommate’s erection and felt tiny spurts of pre start to soak into his chest-fur, unsure if they were his or Dare’s. Without thinking, Milo reached up and snuck one of his hands under Dare’s t-shirt, letting his fingers drift toward Dare’s nipples. Dare only noticed what Milo was up to when it was too late.<br />
<br />
“M-Milo, s-stop-“ It was Dare’s turn to protest, but it came too late. His eyes went completely unfocused and his grip tightened even more as Milo’s finger brushed over the piercing in his nipple. Milo felt Dare’s cock, already quite erect, immediately go rock-hard against his own erection, then Milo felt a splash of warmth spray across his chest as Dare completely creamed himself all over his roommate.<br />
<br />
“Dare, what is that? It felt like-“<br />
<br />
“Shut up! Don’t you dare tell anyone!” Dare sputtered, jumping up from the bed and looking all around for his clothes. Milo could tell right away that Dare was about to make a break for it, as usual.<br />
<br />
“Dare, you promised you’d tell me what is going on! You’re acting ridiculous!” Milo shouted, getting up and wondering where the hell his own clothes had gotten thrown to. In the chaos, Dare had gotten dressed and was out the door, leaving Milo still half-erect and covered in his roommate’s seed.<br />
<br />
“…Dare, you goddamn lunatic,” Milo sighed, looking down at his deflating cock. “…Should have just done it quick like I wanted to…”<br />
<br />
----------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Dare dashed down the hall toward the common room, needing a break from the beautiful boar that he’d left behind in their dorm room.<br />
<br />
“What the fuck was going on… T-the second he got those pants off, it was like… Like I was fucking hypnotized or something!” Dare muttered under his breath. “God, not only am I fucking skunk, I’m turning into a skunk with a boar fetish that likes to get his tits squeezed… What the hell, Stripes, how is this supposed to be the best life for me, huh!?”<br />
<br />
He was so wrapped up in his rambling that he unintentionally ran right into someone.<br />
<br />
“Oh, sorry about that, Dare… Hey, is my little brother around? Wanted to ask him about something,” William said, grabbing Dare to keep him from falling over. William&#39;s nose twitched and he raised an eyebrow at Dare, recognizing the scent currently clinging to Dare&#39;s body.<br />
<br />
However, Dare could on stare at William, taking in the tiny tusks that were starting to grow in under his lip and the hooved feet sticking out from the legs of his pants.<br />
<br />
“God damn it, I just can’t get away…” he said hopelessly, turning around and running toward the dormitory’s exit. He needed to go dip his head in the lake, or he’d be fantasizing about boars for the rest of the day. Or, more likely, for the rest of his life.</p>
