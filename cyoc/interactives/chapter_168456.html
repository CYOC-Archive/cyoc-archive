<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As the two of you got into the car and started driving off, it seemed like the persona of Vinny started acclimating, and exerting less immediate and sudden influence, and Keith&#39;s personality started to restore itself. Granted, there was still a definite influence of Italian culture Keith could feel in his mind, as well as the culture and nature of the mob, but as the two drove around town, Vinny / Keith started to feel his mental state taking on more of an equilibrium. Considering Keith was the original persona, and Vinny the new one generated by the car keys, it might well have been inevitable.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, the gangster parked the car just outside of a fast food spot, and you immediately ask him, &quot;Did---I...uh, Did I say something wrong? Do something wrong...?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No...no...&quot; Keith murmured and then looked over at you with a slight smile, &quot;I think...Compagno, I think my mind finally got to some kinda new arrangement, ya&#39;know? Like, it was building up to that, and now it&#39;s done.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So you&#39;re...are you back to being Keith again?&quot; You ask, feeling more at home sitting next to Keith than you had prior. Kind of does make you wonder what these car keys you&#39;d found might be able to do to people. And whether this was a fluke or a feature. Maybe whoever made these things didn&#39;t want to cause a total identity demise...<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I&#39;m feeling more like Keith now. Just...seems kinda like my mind has incorporated Vinny into itself. Like, you wouldn&#39;t believe how much Italian I know now!&quot; Keith actually seemed pretty excited about this, and once again checked himself out in the rear view mirror. &quot;I&#39;m looking good...&quot;<br />
<br />
You know that turning back is a bit of a nonstarter right now, but then figure that Keith might be up for it later. He&#39;s still obviously riding a power high from his newly muscular, skilled and deadly body and mental state. You look out the window and see it looks like the sun is coming down, and figure the two of you might need to head out soon. You look at Keith and say, &quot;I...think I should get going soon---&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on, man! Don&#39;t be a coperta bagnata! You&#39;re always fretting about your parents this and getting home that.&quot; Keith says with a scoff, and you realize how much influence his mobster persona probably played on his view of rules and adherence thereof. He seemed to get an idea and said, &quot;Just call your folks up and tell &#39;em you&#39;re havin&#39; a sleepover with Keith. Capische?&quot;<br />
<br />
You realize this would also let you mind Keith and make sure he didn&#39;t do anything extravagant or dangerous, and nod quickly. Before long you&#39;re calling up your folks on your cell phone to let them know. Despite your preconceptions about this, they seem pretty okay with it, even proud of you for staying out late and venturing out of your comfort zone. Once it was done, Keith clapped you on your shoulder.<br />
<br />
&quot;Congrats, ya finally got to stay out late. Now let&#39;s go get ourselves somewhere to stay. I got mob money in my pocket burnin&#39; a hole there.&quot; Keith said with a grin and the two of you headed off for a surprisingly high quality hotel. After all, Keith was not exactly recognizable right now to his parents, he was decidedly not in the mood to return to normal, and you&#39;d just set up what was going on with your folks.<br />
<br />
As the two of you got to the hotel, Keith entered first ahead of you as he parked in the lot, taking care as he did and making you realize he had well and truly developed several adult skill sets. He leaned over to you as the two of you stood in front of the door to the hotel, &quot;Lemme do all the talkin&#39;, and we&#39;ll get a nice-ass room to test the keys out in.&quot;<br />
<br />
You go with that, and before long the two of you are entering. Keith seems to get a noticeably pervy grin as he looks at the pretty blond woman managing the front desk. She seems to like what she sees too, and says, &quot;Welcome to Padson and Tourville Hotels...can I...help you?&quot; She says with an appreciative wink, not even seeming to care about you.<br />
<br />
Keith speaks, &quot;Well honey, me an&#39; my cousin here were needin&#39; a nice little space to stay, you get me? And maybe later we could get to know each other better. This place have a weight room?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That it does!&quot; The woman says with a smile, and before long money is traded for keys and a map of the place, and Keith takes it all in. He hands you the map and pockets the new keys. As the two of you are heading up to the room, you feel like asking him about that whole odd exchange.<br />
<br />
&quot;...Do you like her, Keith?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hell yeah, I do. Have you seen that chick&#39;s boobs?&quot; Keith says with a grin. He finally felt like he had a shot now that he was this cool, powerful Italian guy, not the nervous and short kid he used to be. And honestly? If Keith felt this good, and all the mental effects and shit were done and resolved, he might not even want to return to normal for some time. Maybe in some weeks...or months...<br />
<br />
You chuckle and nod, wondering if it might be wise to try and have a similar change done to you. Maybe you&#39;d even end up with a similar one. How would that go, you wonder.<br />
<br />
You get into the room and plop down on the bed as Keith heads out to retrieve some clothes from the Ferrari, and by the time he gets back you&#39;ve been considering that a bit more. Keith drops the clothes on the floor of the room and starts taking out a few of them. Specifically a white stringer shirt and short shorts. He licks his lips and thinks about that woman&#39;s reaction to seeing him wearing these. &quot;Okay, dude, I&#39;m gonna head out to go hit the gym here, test out this body full on. Don&#39;t fool around with the keys too much. Ya dunno what they might do.&quot;<br />
<br />
Keith puts the keys down, and then gets dressed in his stringer and shorts. As he does, your eyes are drawn to his scarred up, wide and muscular back and his appearance. He&#39;s usually so classy, but now he&#39;s feeling like he&#39;s riding high on appearance. You look at where the keys were put...<br />
<br />
Keith leaves the room, smirking to himself as he heads to the hotel gym and what he assumes is a hot evening, while you consider your options.</p>
