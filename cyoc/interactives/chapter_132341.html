<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After leaving the court (of course, having won by a long mile), Jennifer walked calmly towards a park, peeing her way out of the place while waves of pee already savaged the entire. She felt uneasy, now she thought she couldn&#39;t even take any advantage of her pee problem. <br />
<br />
- So I finally become the ultimate pee creature in the universe, and I can&#39;t take advantage of it, what a hell I am in right now! <br />
<br />
She went to the closest park to let her pee flow freely and get absorbed by the soil beneath. She pee around 3 gallons per second, and although she could reduce her pee output by around 80%, she could also force her muscles to increase exponentially her pee stream, being able to expulse more than 12 gallons per second. She decided there were still, things she could do. After all, if finding a pee contest wasn&#39;t that hard to find, she could find another way to gain something from her condition. As it turns out, she found it had some benefits: her anus was closed and she needed to shit through her urethra, but she wasn&#39;t hungry at all, nor thristy. It was clear that by now, she should be hungry and in clear necessity of a drink, but she seemed to be just fine even when she produced the equivalent of a dam by that time.<br />
<br />
-Dam... a dam. That&#39;s it! I know how I can make this useful.<br />
<br />
She knew she could not ask Amazon to deliver her a dam for her urathra, nor would the government would give her a dam of her own, but she did know what dams are for, most of the cases: to produce energy by having water flowing and moving engines that transform mechanical energy into electricity. All she needed to do is search and call for the company responsible for dam construction and use one of their old and dry dams to produce free energy even when it wasn&#39;t the season when raining and ice fill the dams.<br />
In her emotion for finally finding what to do, she had stopped concentrating and her urethra went wild, expulsing 8 gallons per second now that her body wasn&#39;t resisting. Even when the soil could have easily drained the equivalent of full days of raining, she had been concentrating all her pee into a single spot, which quickly saturated and sarted pouring all over the hill of the park, flowing down like a volcano erupting with yellow cold lava.<br />
<br />
-Oh shit, time to leave, now now now. I remember seeing another dry place I can fill in the meantime.<br />
<br />
Jen took a look at her phone and, after a while, found a number and direction: a dam that was going to be shut down for changing seasons and empty rivers. She quickly called the number and explained her situation.<br />
<br />
-Amm... Hello? <br />
- Greetings, I&#39;m Micke from Industries Compa. How can I help you?<br />
-I am... I&#39;m Kayleen and I would like to help you. I have read the Dragon&#39;s Dam is about to close for season change, but what if I tell you I can make it operate better than ever before?<br />
-... <br />
-Hello?<br />
-Please, madam, this is a serious line. That dam has been empty for weeks and no water can be seen anywhere in miles and miles of extension. How could you make it operate?<br />
-Just trust me, handle the phone to your superior. I can guarantee optimal energy production for as long as you want. All you need to do is send me a private transport, but in a large bus, an empty bus full of empty drums. Were those conditions fulfilled, I would make you liquid money! <br />
-I&#39;ll send your petition to my superior and call yo...<br />
-No my man, you don&#39;t understand. I NEED you to make it fast. I can increase greatly the energy production, and indirectly, raise up your salary. All you need to do is trust on me and force my petition to be accepted as top priority. I&#39;m going to sign any contract as a legal way to sue me if I don&#39;t succeed.<br />
<br />
Micke dropped the phone, it was clear he wasn&#39;t that eager in trusting such thing, yet she thought... it could be possible. Her beliefs were quickly answered positively after her Whatsapp ringed and an unknown number send her a schedule, a place to pick up and an URL where she found a digital contract she could sign with an old, yet timeless format to cover any chance of avoiding legal actions. As she signed and read the message, her pussy throbbed with pleasure and shoot a jet of pee so strong and focused it pierce through some trees and made a hole as it impacted the floor.<br />
<br />
-Oops! I better get going. My time to shine has come.<br />
<br />
Jen went straight to the pick up point, thanfully not far from her current location, while reducing her pee production 30% as to leave only a trail instead of a flood. The bus was, indeed, a big one. They really got what she expected, but nothing would matter if there weren&#39;t enough canisters to fill as they get to the dam. A quick view showed her demands, again, accomplished as she wished; everything seemed so good to be true. <br />
The car started its long journey to the dam, which was outside of the city and would take, at best, 40min to reach. She knew US regular drums can keep up to 55 gallons, while she produced around 3 per second without restraining, and could reduce it to a maximun of 0.6 gps, which still meant she would fill all 10 drums in less than 16 minutes, for a ride that would take in average, half an hour. She would need to hold her pee quite often and spill metric cubes of pee after all drums are full. It would be a hazard, true, but she would never get more than 26 drums in a single private vehicle for her without lods of money she didn&#39;t have... yet.<br />
As the time passed, she found interesting and morbid things about her new biology: it was now clear for her that she needed food no more, air, sleep or any drink. She could still eat and drink just fine, but it would come off her urethra as pee. Apart from that, her pussy had became incredibly elastic able to stretch as far as she wanted, problem with this was that her urethra got enlarged as well when she tried and the pee production rised grotesquely in an instant, from her restrained 0.6 to a whooping 20, but it only lasted a second before she retracted her skin: it was a trick for later on. Apart from that, she found the man at the contest was wrong, it was easy for her to aim her pee, as easy as moving her index finger, she could move and target wherever she wanted and shoot and, if keeping focus, could stretch and enlarge her urethra as a pseudo penis for better aiming, getting longer and longer while letting the neverending flow of pee travel pour down the containers. Her new body was amazing, the curse had turned her into the perfect survival machine, at a cost she was about to get reward from.<br />
After what seemed to be a breeze, all drums were full, having some pee spilled over the floor after each drum switch. She needed to pour the infinite fountain somewhere else for the remaining time without getting noticed. At first, stretching her skin tube to the window looked like a neat solution, but she completely ignored just how much pee came out of her while doing so, leaving trails of pee like if the car was leaking an infinite amount of gasoline. They would be stopped by police or someone trying to warn the driver about the leak; it wasn&#39;t going to work. Her options were reduced to 0 after seconds of trying to resist her ever increasing urge to pee... except, there was one. Didn&#39;t seem logical but at the same time, one interesting way to solve it. Gross for sure, she took her elastic urethra and introduced its end in her mouth, letting the yellow fountain to re enter her body.<br />
<br />
-It... wasn&#39;t as I expected.<br />
<br />
Indeed, her pee wasn&#39;t like she thought it would be: gross, nasty, disgusting warm liquid, but a salad drink of lemonade. Still, not good enough as a drink, but not as bad as it suggested to be. This method temporarily solved the problem, until her body told her to stop drinking. Sure, her body was able to produce infinite pee, but not hold infinite liquid inside her and her reshaped digestive track meant all the pee was relocated back to her bladder, inflating it slowly. Jen thought, then, something else that could work: stretching her tube all the way to the sky and spray her pee at such high altitude it would appear as acid rain on a small range, idea she had to throw away after rethinking what a long pink tube to the sky in a bus would look like. <br />
Then, enlightment hit her. On the way to the dam, there would be completely dry portions of land, which of course, don&#39;t have much population. She could twist and make knots in her urethra while holding her pee just to gain some time without the gigantic burst overcame each knot and splashed everything around it. She knew it was the last resort. She could have made a knot in her infinitely elastic tube and just let the pee acumulate on its edge, but it will increase in size and weight endlessly and stop the car from moving; she didn&#39;t need to hold it all, just gain some time and kept her urethra from expanding as more and more pee came to press against the knot.<br />
<br />
-Here... we... GO!<br />
<br />
Her pee production stopped: only a few seconds remained before the force grew too large to retain. She made knots and knots with expertise worth of years in the Boy Scouts, around 15 before her pain was so high she couldn&#39;t hold anymore. Right before succumbing to the release, she stretched the end of the tube right outside the bus, pointing where the dry land would be anytime soon.<br />
Hit, like a wave, with tidal forces so strong her tube grew bigger than the drums in less than a second. While containing the pee stopped it from seconds, the knots proved effective at multiplying the time it took for the rampaging flow to reach the end. Still, one after the other, the knots collapsed and let the pee bulge over the next, getting bigger and stronger per know it broke. By the time it reached the last knot, it was already so heavy it curved the whole car to the side.<br />
It was a miracle, but the plan worked as intended, mostly. The pee bursted through the last knot and threw over 250 gallons directly to the now empty and dry land to the side, instantly causing a wave of pee to wash over the land. The driver didn&#39;t seem to care, as he was too focused with his music and greasy food.<br />
Finally, the car got to the drop point, without seeing the flood it had left behind after Jen spilled all the pee in the drums over the highway as they were the only ones going through that track.<br />
<br />
-Well lady, we made it, despite your directions.<br />
-Thanks sir, but please, don&#39;t exit the vehicle, I can find the way myself from now on.<br />
-I wasn&#39;t going to leave anyway, I have to drop the car in the garage as soon as possible. Keep it quick kid, I ain&#39;t got all day.<br />
<br />
Jen left the bus and...</p>
