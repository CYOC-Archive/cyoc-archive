<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">There was still a part of her that was very much Warren, as she possessed both knowledge and intelligence that went far beyond a simple Siamese cat. In addition to being able to reason and work things out in ways a feline could never do so she could also plan. This could be seen in what she wanted to possibly do if she ever regained the Amulet of Zulo, which was to use to see which was better, being a human female or male, to try things as either, and, if disappointed, go back to being a cat.<br />
<br />
A part of her felt this was the likely outcome. She could recall, faintly, things of being Warren that weren&#39;t pleasant, such as the way she&#39;d been bullied by an older brother, whom she couldn&#39;t remember the name of, and by students at school. Vague memories still existed as to how abusive her father had been, both to her mother and her, but not to her older brother. She remembered the way her father had called them names, sometimes hit her, but would only raise a hand to her mother, never striking her because the moment he did so, the woman immediately cowered and did what he told her to. In addition, there was the confusion her life had become some time after her body had entered puberty and she started the climb out of childhood and the march to adulthood, with one of the biggest things she was uncertain about was whether she&#39;d end up like her older brother and father.<br />
<br />
Scared by this possibility, Rune felt because of what she&#39;d experience as a human, there was a good chance she&#39;d go back to being a cat once she had done what she planned to do. But the problem she faced now was how to find the necklace that had turned her from a teenage boy to a female cat in heat, which was the one thing she so far didn&#39;t really care for, though she was finding ways to cope. Wandering through the house, after she had first satisfied herself by rubbing her backend against certain things, then given herself a thorough wash, being attentive to her privates, she inspected the doors, looking for a way to wrap her paws around the knobs and work them open.<br />
<br />
Unable to find anything, she moved on to the windows, which were all screened, but sometimes were left open. Starting with the ones in the living room, she leapt daintily onto the sill, rubbed her jaw against the crank, and made a soft grumbling growl deep in her throat. Finding the windows secure, that not even the screens had been removed, or fastened back in place improperly, she prepared to jump down, but stopped when a she heard a door open somewhere, followed by voices.<br />
<br />
The part that was a cat recognised the female voice as one of the those who fed and policed her commode, whilst the part of her that was Warren knew the male was her older brother. Jumping down to the carpet, she held herself low as she slinked across the room. When the young female, &quot;Kathy?&quot; she wondered, came downstairs, she froze and moved to a place she couldn&#39;t be seen. Wondering why her brother had come over, as she knew he usually tutored the teenage girl who lived with her at the place she’d once called home when she was Warren, Rune, she followed in the direction Kathy had gone. Coming to the study, she poked her head around the corner, and looking to see if the coast was clear and whether she could make it under the desk or get up on one of the higher shelves without being seen, she froze when she witnessed what was going on.<br />
<br />
Deep blue eyes stared in wonder as Rune watched Kathy shrink, harden, and turn into a doll that matched one of the ones up on the shelf. The part of her that was still Warren understood what had caused what she witnessed. Searching for the amulet, she soon saw that it was in the hands of the human male who&#39;d been her brother at one time, and curious as to how she might get it away from him, she considered rushing in, hissing, baring her fangs, and using her teeth and claws. But, before she could, the young man scooped up the doll, Kathy&#39;s clothes, and, after a moment, rushed from the room. Taking a final look in the room, noting the computer was still on, she waited a moment before she hurried afterward and slunk up the stairs, thinking as she did that something looked off about human male as she asked herself why it was he had gone upstairs.<br />
<br />
When she reached the second floor, Rune sat on the last step and peered down the hall. She could see the open door that led to Kathy&#39;s room and hear someone moving about within, but the part of her that was very much a feline didn&#39;t move. She knew she was not allowed in the upstairs bedrooms, even though she sometimes went in them anyway, and that if she did go in, eventually she&#39;d be shooed out. The part of her that was still human didn&#39;t care, for down the hall was the thing he wanted, though it was now a question as to how to get it. Raising one leg up, she daintily placed her paw on the hard wood floor, paused, peered down the hallway, and when no one came out, stepped the rest of the way up, crouched low, and began to slink toward the open door.<br />
<br />
From within, everything had gone silent. Instincts warned her to be on guard for anything, she paused a couple feet away and swivelled her ears. From within, she thought she heard Kathy say something, which didn&#39;t make sense for a moment, as she could have sworn it was her brother who&#39;d gone into the bedroom. Suddenly cottoning on to that the boy might have used the amulet to transform himself, Rune was intrigued to know why as she took a couple more steps forward, but froze when she heard the sound of approaching feet.<br />
<br />
Crouched as low as she could, Rune almost fled back the way she&#39;d come when Kathy, naked as the day she was born, came tearing out of the bedroom, raced down the hall and disappeared into the bathroom, uttering whimpers and cries and unintelligible things as she went. With a sound of finality, the young female closed the door, and Rune stared for a moment at the closed door before she turned her attention back to bedroom. Wanting the necklace, hoping that Kathy hadn&#39;t taken it with her, she couldn&#39;t remember seeing it in the human&#39;s hands. Inching closer, on alert for the telltale sign she&#39;d be shooed back downstairs, she approached the open room, stopped to listen, to smell the air, and moved enough to peer into the room.<br />
<br />
The first thing she saw were her brother&#39;s clothes scattered about on the floor. Uninterested in them, she slipped in the room and began to meander about as she searched for the necklace. Certain it would have been left on something high, like the bed, dresser or vanity, she prepared to jump on the bed to start her search there, but didn&#39;t when something caught her eye. Focusing on it, she immediately saw that it was the Amulet of Zulo. Alert for the first telltale sound of someone either coming up the stairs or a door opening nearby, she dropped to her belly and scooted toward the necklace.<br />
<br />
Not certain what do with it, Rune thought for a moment before she decided to try and drag it downstairs to hide it somewhere. At a loss how she might do that, she thought back to her previous efforts of how she&#39;d tried to drag it across the yard. Thinking this would have to do, she crept closer, twisted her head one way, them another, extended out a paw to bat at the necklace and after a bit of trial and error, clamped her jaws down on the amulet at about the point where the chain connected to the medallion. Easing herself backward, trying to keep herself aware of her surroundings, she didn&#39;t realise she had had stepped off the carpet and onto the discarded shirt her brother had worn until the Amulet of Zulo caught on the garment and caused it to bunch up.<br />
<br />
Snagged, Rune felt her hold on the amulet start to slip and with a series of grumbles, she tried to tighten her hold as she tried to push and pull it away from what it had become caught on. Still unaware that it was her brother&#39;s shirt, she let go of the necklace and gave a sharp, startled hiss of discomfort when she felt something sting her mouth.<br />
<br />
Suddenly aware of what she was standing on, she peered down and thought, &quot;Oh, crap,&quot; as a tingly sensation whipped through her, caused her to lift her tail as high as it would go and to shift about on all four of her paws.<br />
<br />
Displeased with what had happened, she cursed herself for not paying attention as the sensation settled in her back legs, groin and butt. Hind legs splayed as far as they would go, Rune squeezed her eyes shut as a discomfort inside her began to grow. Tempted to yowl out, she resisted the urge as she play bowed and extended her forelegs out as far as they would go. Her front paws starting to look more like hands with only three fingers, she didn&#39;t see this and instead was too focused on trying to find a way to relieve herself as the discomfort blossomed into a full out pain. Tripling in size as her back paws started to look more like human feet, Rune hissed as something inside her began to push itself out through her vagina. As this happened, her vulva sealed shut, her clit and urethra merged, and as the remains of her female genitalia ballooned outward a human penis began to form.<br />
<br />
Feet and hands near complete, Rune would have thought she looked like a mutant if she could have seen herself. No longer looking fully like a cat, she appeared to be something with human penis, testicles, hands and feet. Her front legs morphing into arms as the seal point fur on her body began to recede, she stretched as far as she could when, with a series of cracks and pops, her spine and hips realigned to something better suited to walk on two legs. Glad the discomfort in her privates had faded, she grimaced when her body went from quadruped to bipedal, and was happy when it didn&#39;t grow much beyond a minor discomfort as her face lost its feline appearance and took on more human characteristics. Spitting teeth as she continued to gain weight and height, it wasn&#39;t long before she found the effects of the change had slowed as it finished. Short, sandy brown hair she found topped her head, which she discovered as she ran a hand though it, and gazing down at her body, she noted that her brother didn&#39;t have any body hair. Wondering if he shaved it off, Rune stared at the her nuts and dick, ashamed to be seeing her brother&#39;s junk, yet also confused as it was clearly now hers. Feeling like she was in a daze, she sat there and listened to the house, thinking, &quot;Oh, shit. I&#39;m Jason. I don&#39;t want to be him,” over and over.</p>
