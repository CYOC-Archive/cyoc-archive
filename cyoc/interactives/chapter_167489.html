<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It took a few moments for John to orientate herself. Memories of yesterday and the accidental change to a copy of Sara came back. But where was she? Last she could remember was being at the nightclub watching Sara and Bill dance. John could remember being upset about Bill&#39;s hands apparently groping Sara&#39;s bum. But what happened after that? The rest of the night was a blank.<br />
<br />
Where was she? This wasn&#39;t their bedroom. It wasn&#39;t even their house. It looked like a motel room. She could see the black tube dress Sara had dressed her in, discarded over a chair. With horror she observed the lacy black panties Sara had forced her to wear on the floor, sitting on top of the shoes she had been wearing. At least Sara had taken a little mercy on him and had allowed her to wear shoes with a blocky heel. Her hands felt her body. She was completely naked under the blankets.<br />
<br />
Then John realized she was not alone in the bed. Someone was asleep under the blankets next to her. Tentatively John&#39;s petite manicured hands lifted the sheet. She was hoping to find she was asleep next to her twin but quickly dropped the sheet back when she realized her bed mate did not have long blonde hair. She felt sick in the stomach when her bedmate was revealed to have short dark brown hair. A man&#39;s haircut. <br />
<br />
Then with horror John noticed the room stank of sex. Her fingers felt the genitals she now possessed, a perfect copy of Sara&#39;s from their wedding night. Her fingers found the neatly trimmed pubic hairs, however rather then the hairs feeling soft and silky they were stiff. They were coated in dried cum.<br />
<br />
Doing her best not to disturb her bedmate John slipped out of the bed. Seeing no other clothes about she picked up the dress and panties. She certainly appeared to be in a motel room. There was a mirror on the wall and John saw her reflection. There was a young naked Sara staring back at her. Her hair was a total mess. But John had greater things to worry about.<br />
<br />
She couldn&#39;t leave naked. She had to get dressed. As quietly as she could she slipped into the bathroom then locked the door behind herself. She examined herself carefully in the mirror. She had bruises on her neck. Love bites if she wasn&#39;t mistaken. She had dried cum on her pubic hairs and over her upper thighs. Her vagina felt a little sore. Clearly whoever was in that bed had enjoyed sex with her last night.<br />
<br />
John tried to recall what had happened but she could not remember leaving the club. She couldn&#39;t remember anything but hiding in a corner and watching Bill and Sara dancing. There had been multiple would be dance partners who had tried to entice her onto the dance floor but she could remember telling them all to &quot;get lost&quot;. Maybe it was her fault. In her misery she could remember drinking the cocktails Bill had bought for her.  <br />
<br />
She found a washer, wet it and tried to wipe the encrusted semen off her body. Then having no other options stepped back into the panties and put the dress back on. Fortunately it had a zip up the side and was easy to put on. As John zipped herself up she rued the fact that the Sara he had married was such a sexy creature. She had an hourglass figure which this dress did a great job of showing off.<br />
<br />
She ran her fingers through her hair to smooth it slightly. There appeared to be encrusted cum in her long blonde locks. How could that have got there? She was disgusted. However she didn&#39;t have a comb or brush or anything to hide the love bites on her neck. She would just have to get home as she was. At least by the time she got back to the house she would be able to change back to herself again.<br />
<br />
How to get home might be a problem though. She had refused to carry the handbag Sara had given her and of course the dress she wore had no pockets. She had no money and she didn&#39;t know where she was. She didn&#39;t even have a phone. She had bought her phone but had decided to put it into Sara&#39;s handbag once they were at the club. She assumed it was still there.<br />
<br />
John tentatively reopened the bathroom door. She first glanced to the shoes she had been wearing last night. She had to quickly put them on then get out of there without waking her bedmate. She glanced to the bed and saw it was now empty. Her companion was gone. <br />
<br />
Initially she was relieved. At least she wouldn&#39;t wake him. In fact there was no sign that anyone else had been in the room. Had she been hallucinating? No the tenderness of her groin and the memory of the dried cum was real. Indeed the room stunk of sex.<br />
<br />
Then John saw a scrawled note on the bedside table. It was sitting on a pile of $20 notes. John read it &quot;Thanks Babe for the night. I need to get to an early meeting. I hope this is enough&quot; John realized with horror that her partner thought she was a prostitute. <br />
<br />
However she picked up the notes. At least this would enable her to catch a taxi home. She counted out the notes. 8 of them. $160. John had to admit she had no idea what a prostitute cost. <br />
<br />
However she was still relieved to be alone. She slipped the chain lock on the door. If her companion returned he wouldn&#39;t be able to get in.  Then as she felt dirty she decided to have a shower. It also gave her a chance to calm down and consider her situation.<br />
<br />
She had the shower and tried to wash any trace of the man&#39;s semen off her body and out of her vagina. She soon found out that was not as easy as she had thought. Clearly the man had not been wearing a condom.<br />
<br />
In the shower she worked herself up and began to get very angry at Sara. How could she and Bill have left her alone? Surely they should have been there to ensure she had got home safely. They had forced her to go out. Had they become so obsessed with each other that they had forgotten she had been at the club with them?<br />
<br />
John washed Sara&#39;s hair. She had to get the cum out. It took a lot more shampoo than John expected to lather up the hair. Eventually John was as clean as she could make herself. She dried and put the clothes back on. She even used the motel hair dryer to blow dry her hair. John had always loved the way Sara&#39;s hair looked when blow dried and tried to emulate that look. However the love-bites on her neck spoilt the effect.<br />
<br />
Ready as she could make herself she returned to the bedroom put on Sara&#39;s shoes. There was a room key on a bench. She picked it up, then had a second thought. She put it down again.<br />
<br />
She clutched the notes in her hand as she opened the door and looked out into a hallway. One direction was clearly a dead end. The door closed behind her. There was only one way to go. She walked down the hall only to find it ended at the office. There was a receptionist apparently waiting for her. <br />
<br />
&#39;Mrs Smith, I hope you had a good night&#39; The women sounded sarcastic. &#39;Your husband said you would be paying. $150 please&#39;</p>
