<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Before the shockwaves:<br />
<br />
Chay picked up her phone as she read through her received messages.<br />
&#39;I&#39;ll be there, see you at five&#39;.<br />
&#39;Might be a little later, but will definitely be there&#39;.<br />
&#39;Will make it before dinner, want me to bring some more food with me?&#39;<br />
<br />
Alright! That&#39;s always fun. All the girls come in for the sleepover. Well, sleepover? Probably movie night and staying awake until tomorrow, just like last time at Emma&#39;s house.<br />
<br />
Most of the preparations were done. Her mother would make dinner, but Chay decided to make some chocolate filled cupcakes as for dessert.<br />
<br />
The oven beeped, as the timer reached zero. Time to get them out, otherwise they&#39;d get burned, and burned chocolate and good chocolate are not too easy to distinguish, unless you taste them.<br />
<br />
Chay opened it by the handle. She quickly moved her head to the side, in order not to be assaulted by the hot air escaping the oven. Thoughtlessly, she grabbed a plate, and reached inside the oven to grab the cupcake.<br />
<br />
She immediately retracted her hands, after the touch.<br />
<br />
Hot!<br />
<br />
&#39;Stupid of me. Should&#39;ve thought that through.&#39;<br />
<br />
The red oven mitts from her mother were in the kitchen drawer to her left, she opened it and took them out.<br />
<br />
Putting them off, she was now a little more reassured she wouldn&#39;t burn herself while grabbing the chocolate cupcakes.<br />
<br />
Chay set the plate on the counter, and closed the oven. Water ran through her mouth. They really looked well done! All in all a success.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom,&quot; she called out, &quot;the cupcakes are done. If you want to start dinner, now&#39;s your chance!&quot;<br />
<br />
She heard a shout of confirmation from upstairs. Her mother was probably still busy with some other housework. Well, whatever, it was still early.<br />
<br />
She removed the mitts from her hands. After a careful touch to the side, she took the cupcake closest to her for a taste test. A small bite. Nice and chewy. Good gracious that chocolate filling! She&#39;d filled the cupcake cup with a mix of milk chocolate and batter, then filled the cup with chocolate chips, the pure kind, only to fill up the cup&#39;s sides and top with even more of the batter. In the oven, the rose to be the perfect size, and with a beautifully molten inside.<br />
<br />
Too bad her friends weren&#39;t here yet. The cupcakes would cool down, even in room temperature, and the filling wouldn&#39;t be as warm, no, hot anymore. It wouldn&#39;t ruin the taste though, that was certain.<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
A sharp pain charged through her body. All of a sudden, she felt like her mouth and nose got stuffed in an incredible sweetness. Her eyes temporarily stopped working, as her brain got assaulted with new sensations. Chay felt as though her body was going to explode. Her senses were assaulted by delight and sweetness. Her scent changed. Her eyes turned from blue to a gorgeous brown. Everything inside her felt like it changed.<br />
<br />
But nothing was noticeable from outside.<br />
<br />
She lay there, recovering from the sudden shock and the feelings that followed quickly afterwards. That weird, sweet scent didn&#39;t leave. Trying to smell her own breath, she noticed it smelled like chocolate, a delicious kind.<br />
<br />
Weird.<br />
<br />
She was on the ground, and the cupcakes she&#39;d made were all gone from their plate.<br />
<br />
-<br />
5 years later:<br />
<br />
&quot;C&#39;mon let&#39;s go.&quot; Gregory whispered in her ear, as they made it upstairs, to her dorm room. Chay&#39;s roommates were all gone, on vacation.<br />
<br />
As the two entered, they locked the door behind them, and Chay immediately started to strip. Who would&#39;ve thought anyone was interested in having sex with her, considering she was one of the merged? But this guy... What a man he was. His flirting was on point, and had made her so horny. Even if it was only for once, she didn&#39;t care about losing her virginity then. Must be some crazy fetish, or a hidden love for free chocolate. Cocoa becomes more and more expensive these days, and she was pretty much a living factory, producing chocolate where you stood.<br />
<br />
It wouldn&#39;t be noticed from the outside, but her naturally sweet breath exposed her every time a guy approached. This time it was actually sweet enough to hook her up with one of them. Score! No longer fantasizing. They looked at her, they just hadn&#39;t dared to take that last step, considering her condition. But Greg here was a unique, all-daring case.<br />
<br />
&quot;Greg,&quot; Chay gasped, &quot;how about some foreplay huh? Would you like that? Chocolate escapes me from everywhere you know.&quot;<br />
<br />
Greg was entirely naked, his hard dick already right below her pussy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Foreplay? Like what?&quot; He asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Watch and see.&quot;<br />
<br />
Making sure to hold that boner under her, as it rubbed against her cunt so nicely, they stepped in sync to the bed. Chay walked forwards, her date in front of her, he walked backwards, and eventually fell on the bed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Check this out.&quot; She said, as Greg watched her form a drop of spit above his lips. Her could smell her sweet chocolaty scent. The spit had that trademark colour, brown. Chay moved her face closer to his, and they intimately kissed one another. How about that. That flavor! His brain exploded as these sensations filled him. It didn&#39;t make him feel disgusted, instead, he felt even more arousal.<br />
<br />
&quot;Chay. Pee on me, if you dare.&quot;<br />
<br />
She blushed, her skin was as beautiful of a colour as his. He wouldn&#39;t have noticed, hadn&#39;t she told him she used to be as white as as snow. Now she looked like a gorgeous Latina with her brown hair. Her skin wasn&#39;t as dark as that of a Latina, but it came close enough, with all that chocolate streaming through her veins underneath the surface.<br />
<br />
&quot;W-what?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry, how about, right in my mouth? I want to taste all of you. Still foreplay, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
Chay shyly nodded, as her craziest fantasies became more and more reality.<br />
<br />
She brought her cunt to his mouth, and he opened wide. Her muscles relaxed, as she let the stream go.<br />
<br />
He gulped all of it down greedily, all of the lukewarm stream of chocolate milk that escaped her bladder. His tongue noticed the sweet taste of cocoa combined with a salty twist. As the stream slowed, he licked the corners of his mouth clean. Drips of chocolate milk rand down his chin.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well?&quot; Chay asked, averting her eyes. Her eyes were half closed in her arousal, but she still felt the need to ask. &quot;How was it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Salty,&quot; was his answer, &quot;but it definitely tastes good, like I expected of you Chay. Are you a fan of Tony Chocolonely?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Shut up.&quot; She moaned, no longer wanting him to talk. Only kissing from now on, as they got more and more intimate.<br />
<br />
Greg pulled out a condom, and applied it on his swollen cock. He wondered how long he could still withhold himself, but he knew that Chay was already far gone as well.<br />
<br />
They&#39;d switched positions, and he was working his tongue inside her cunt this time. Her moaning got louder and louder. Smears of chocolate were all around her vaginal lips, as it had molten and slowly leaked its way out of her canal. Her peeing chocolate milk on Greg&#39;s face didn&#39;t make it any less messy.<br />
<br />
Greg discovered that her cunt also had its own unique taste. All in all, it had to be pure chocolate. It wasn&#39;t his favorite, so he was relieved, as Chay moved her hole lower down his body, to land on his dick, and thrust it.<br />
<br />
The pleasure increased at each thrust for both parties, the pace of the movements went faster and faster. A loud moan from Chay&#39;s side convinced Greg&#39;s brain to ejaculate, as squirts of his sperm flew upwards, uselessly into his own condom. Chay&#39;s moan was the start of the first orgasm she hadn&#39;t inflicted upon herself.<br />
<br />
After that adventure, Chay let out a breath of relief.<br />
<br />
&#39;Sex, I finally got that done.&#39;</p>
