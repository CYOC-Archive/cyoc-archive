<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was still taking John a little bit to get over his current change. He was absolutely massive. Standing up from the bleachers felt so different. His muscles were actually fighting for space as he got up from the bench. He had to sway his entire body to look around the gym. The students shuffled into their assigned seats and he walked over to them. Part of him wondered if they noticed anything different.<br />
<br />
&quot;So what are we doing today Coach?&quot; Steven asked. He was one of the school&#39;s star football players, fast and agile. The other students waited for him to say something. His senior class loved being in gym class. The 18 year olds loved being able to run around outside instead of working in the classrooms. They’d be graduating at the beginning of the year and not have any sort of physically active class.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uhhh...&quot; John was at a bit of a loss. None of them seemed to notice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can we do football? I&#39;m tired of these dumb indoor sports...&quot; Steven said. Half the class nodded in agreement while the other half sighed. <br />
<br />
&quot;We can&#39;t do football!&quot; one of the more out of shape students protested. &quot;Just cause you want to doesn&#39;t mean we all can.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;C&#39;mon it&#39;s not that bad. It&#39;s just a game,&quot; Steven shrugged. The students who clearly weren&#39;t used to playing sports still seemed unimpressed. They didn&#39;t say anything else though.<br />
<br />
John grinned, getting an idea.  &quot;You know that&#39;s a great idea Steven. Let&#39;s do football. It&#39;ll be fun.&quot; Again, half the class was happy while the other class sighed. He didn&#39;t care though. He had an idea he wanted to try out. Grabbing his computer he started for the field. <br />
<br />
&quot;Uhh... Coach?&quot; Henry, one of the smallest guys in the gym, came up to him. He couldn&#39;t even look at John as he spoke. &quot;Coach do I have to play?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Henry,&quot; John put his big hand on his shoulder. &quot;It&#39;ll be alright. I&#39;ll make sure nothing bad happens alright?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How can you...&quot; his sudden outburst drained away into nothing. &quot;Okay coach,&quot; he said despondently. Coach had seen how a couple of the other guys in the class had been treating him. But Henry wouldn&#39;t tell any of the teachers about it so they couldn&#39;t do anything about it. But today was going to be a little different. <br />
<br />
John jogged up to Steven. &quot;Hey could you make sure you have Henry on your team?&quot;<br />
<br />
Steven looked at him skeptically. &quot;Sure thing Coach. But wouldn&#39;t it be better just to not let him play. I&#39;m worried what Marcus is going to do to him...&quot; As he said it Marcus had already started bothering Henry. &quot;But I can make sure he&#39;s on my team.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good man,&quot; John said, patting the younger man on the shoulder. &quot;Alright Marcus, you and Steven are team captains.&quot; A devilish smirk overcame the other man. He&#39;d been asking to be a team captain all year. And now to be against goody two shoes Steven it was going to be even better. He could rub it in Steven&#39;s fave just how much better he was than him. <br />
<br />
John was playing off those emotions. He knew about the rivalry between those two. But the difference was Steven was friends with most of the football team and the wrestlers while Marcus was friends with the rougher guys. John knew they weren&#39;t going to play fair. But it wasn&#39;t going to matter. As long as Steven&#39;s team scored first, the tables were going to turn quickly.<br />
<br />
John went to the sidelines and pulled out the small laptop. Instantly typing away, ‘each touch down scored will act as though each player on the team has been training for professional football for six months.’ Setting down the computer the teams got themselves ready. The amount of testosterone brooding between the 18 year olds was insane. Marcus and Steven stepped to the center ready to square off.<br />
<br />
“Alright I want a clean fair game. Tackling is not permitted,” he stared down at Marcus as he said it. Marcus grunted in approval.  John tossed the coin up, “heads or tails?”<br />
<br />
“Heads,” Marcus shouted. It landed tails. He grunted angrily again. <br />
<br />
“Offense or defense?” John turned to Steven. <br />
<br />
“Offense,” Steven said. <br />
<br />
John was smiling on the inside. “Alright. You guys kick off.” He tossed the ball into Marcus’ hands. His team jogged to the other end of the field ready to kick the ball. It went soaring across the field. One of the guys caught it and started sprinting for the other side. He made it past the fifty and got one of his flags taken down. <br />
<br />
Steven huddled his team and got ready for the next play. He knew Marcus was going to be as big of an ass as he possibly could be, so he had to plan around that. Steven set up his team and readied himself to receive the ball. He watched as the two guys went running down the field. Tossing a perfect spiral it landed directly into the wide receiver’s arms. He sprinted across the field as a couple of Marcus’ friends chased him. But he was just a little too fast for them. He was able to score a touchdown.<br />
<br />
A sudden wave went through all the players on Steven’s team. None of them knew what the feeling was and it only lasted for a second. It was like they had been playing football together for the last six months but that would have been impossible. John watched as several of their bodies started to grow. All of them seemed to grow at least an inch while also gaining 10 more pounds of muscle. Most of them were already pretty confident but now they seemed to be in a different league. <br />
<br />
“Woah,” Henry said. Part of him knew something was up. He felt like he actually understood football now. And his shirt small shirt didn’t feel so big on him. <br />
<br />
“You felling alright?” Steven asked. <br />
<br />
“Yeah…” Henry said. He couldn’t put into words how he felt. But he felt stronger. Flexing his arms there was a strange amount of power in them. He ran after Steven to get ready for the next play.<br />
<br />
They huddled up again. Normally Steven would just go for a field goal just to play it safe but it was supposed to be a fun game. He told a couple of the guys just to be open in the end zone. They set themselves up again and readied themselves. Steven caught the ball and prepared to throw it. Surveying the area he saw an opening. He threw the ball in and it landed perfectly in one of the guys arms again. <br />
<br />
“YEAH!” Steven celebrated. <br />
<br />
Another two months of heavy NFL training was adding to their bodies again. Their bodies grew a little more. Almost all of their shirts were starting to strain against their muscles, and most of them starting to ride up past their belly button. They stood proud and tall as they experienced their growth. None of them noticed just how tight their clothes were starting to fit though. <br />
<br />
Steven walked over to Henry. “See? Not so bad. When you’re playing against guys like Marcus it’s not so hard,” he made sure for Marcus to hear him, even letting out a haughty laugh.<br />
<br />
“Whatever,” Marcus scoffed. He readied himself to receive the ball. Steven’s team went to the other side of the field to kick it. The ball went soaring across the field and landed in one of Marcus’ friends arms. But before they knew it Steven’s team was all over them. They pulled the flag off before they could even make it to the 30.<br />
<br />
“FUCK!” Marcus shouted. He couldn’t believe they were doing this. He huddled the group and demanded them to do better. He wasn’t going to let Steven beat him. “Just be ready to catch the damn ball.” The huddle broke and lined up. For a second all of Marcus’ friends seemed to be a little intimidated. Being in front of the other guys they didn’t realize just how small they were.<br />
<br />
Everyone on Steven’s team seemed so much bigger than them right now. But Marcus shouted for them to hike the ball. Their fears drained as Marcus played his throw. He threw it hard. But before it made it to its destination Steven caught it. He instantly started sprinting back for the end zone, easily dodging the other team. Marcus made chase but was easily left in the dust.<br />
<br />
Steven tossed the ball to the ground, bragging about his goal. Instantly everyone on his team starts growing again. Their bodies gaining more muscle each second. Their shirts grip even tighter to their bodies as they celebrate. Now that they’ve had over a year of training they almost look like pro athletes. The huddle up again.<br />
<br />
“Man my shoes feel really tight today,” one of them say, “I think I’m going to buy some new ones.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah man, me too. Plus I need new gym clothes. These are starting to tear.” Another one adds. He points at one of the sleeves. His arms are almost tearing them to shreds. <br />
<br />
Steven gets a broad smile. “How about we make Marcus and his friends by us new clothes?” The other’s realize what he’s getting at. Steven turned around. “Hey dumbass! How about the loser has to buy the winner new clothes.”<br />
<br />
Marcus was seething. His face turned red. “Deal!” he shouted back. The teams set themselves back up to play.<br />
<br />
Steven’s team was going to go for two points again. They hiked the ball and Steven readied himself, found his opening, and threw. It landed in one of the guys arms and they scored another two points. Instantly their bodies started to grow again. Some of the bigger guys completely tearing out of their shirts and their feet pushing out of the fronts of their shoes. <br />
<br />
Even little Henry was a decent size. He’d started at nearly 100 pounds but actually looked like a decent size. He had grown several inches and was staring most of the guys in the face now. His small shirt that felt so large on him before was now too small. None of the guys on either team noticed the changes. <br />
<br />
The ones that had lost their shirts and shoes acted as though nothing had changed. They set themselves back up and punted the ball down the field. Marcus dropped it and by the time he’d picked it back up someone on Steven’s team had torn off his flag. “Fuck!” he screamed. They’d have to start at the 20 yard line. <br />
<br />
Marcus tried to keep his cool but was quickly losing it. On some level he knew he couldn’t win against Steven’s team. He was starting to wonder why he hadn’t chosen some of those guys. Even if he wasn’t friends with them he should have picked them on their size alone. It wasn’t going to get to him. He just had to make it past them and they’d be able to score. But before he knew it they’d tossed his flags to the ground four times. “This is bullshit!” he shouted.<br />
<br />
“Only cause you’re losing,” Steven taunted. His attitude just pissed Marcus off even more. Marcus was going to stop him if it was the last thing he did. He readied himself. His team may have been useless but he could still do something. Steven had the ball hiked and Marcus dodged his way through the offensive line and make his way to Steven. He dove into the other guy but the ball had already went sailing through the air. “That all you got big guy?” Steven laughed.<br />
<br />
Marcus had bounced off of him like he was nothing. “Fuck!” Marcus shouted. He couldn’t believe they had lost this badly. But looking at the team he really didn’t know why he’d not chosen any of them. All of them looked like they could be pro level athletes and he’d chosen all his friends.<br />
<br />
John couldn’t help but smile as he watched half his class started growing again. With that last touchdown they’d had almost two full years of pro football training. But they still looked like they were in high school. They were still clearly 18 but had a definite advantage on the field. Their bodies worked with the large amount of testosterone in their bodies to help sculpt something amazing. He was a bit amazed himself. <br />
<br />
However Marcus was still pissed and the only person who was close to his size was Henry. He made his move and shoved him. Henry wasn’t the same shrimp he’d been an hour ago. He was still the smallest by far but that didn’t mean he was easy to push around. At a little over 170 pounds and right under 6 foot he was able to stare Marcus right back in the eyes.</p>
