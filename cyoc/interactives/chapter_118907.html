<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You groan slightly as you drag your sweat drenched body out of bed. It’s 10 in the morning on a hot and muggy Saturday. Clearly you forgot to turn your ac on the night before, otherwise it wouldn’t be nearly this hot in your small apartment. You shuffle your feet to the door, struggling not to bump into the wall along the way. Soon, with a clumsy turn of your bedroom door handle, the short hallway with life giving air conditioning stands before you. <br />
<br />
As per the usual you begin your morning with mumbled curses, wishing you could simply go back to bed. It was not a lack of sleep that made you want to return to the covers, but simply a sense of pointlessness to waking up. It was not a work day, and you never had anywhere to go. You lacked friends, even acquaintances. It was not a problem of social skills, for you definitely had those. No, it was an attitude problem. Most people couldn’t stand to be around you for more than a few minutes. Your pessimistic aura coupled with niche interests made you a boring and unpleasant person.  As you brew your coffee and wait for your computer to boot up, your thoughts drift to relationships, a girlfriend or lack thereof. You weren’t ugly by any means; in fact, you were actually slightly above average. It was the aforementioned attitude problem that doomed you to a life eternally alone. You were quickly pulled away from these thoughts however, as your computer finished booting up and you were once again dragged away into the world of the internet; away from your troubles and obligations.<br />
<br />
The morning passed by without event. The air conditioning rapidly cooled off your apartment, and you became more than comfortable dressed in nothing but a white shirt and boxers. The comings and goings of the outside world pushed from your mind, you went about your day online doing as you pleased. Just before 1:00 however, you were pulled away from your peaceful activities by an unexpected knock on the door. Slipping on a pair of flannel pants you kept close at hand, you shuffled to the door to find a package addressed to you. The package was wrapped in a plain cardboard box with no other markings aside from your mailing address. What immediately struck you as odd was the lack of a return address. “How could this have been delivered without a return address,” you thought. The idea that the package might actually be something dangerous rolled through your head, as you weren’t expecting anything soon. You momentarily considered calling the police, but this thought quickly disappeared. Instead, you brought it to the counter and cut it open, disregarding your own personal safety. <br />
<br />
The object inside the box struck you with confusion for a moment. It was a small grey box, about the size of a super nintendo, remembered from your childhood. There were no markings, no buttons, no ports aside from a usb port and power port. Beneath the mysterious object lied a single CD, usb cable and power cable. There were no notes, no instructions, just the strange device and a CD. You hesitated to plug it into your computer. Perhaps the CD or device contained a virus. Maybe this was some clever new scheme to break into people’s computers and the would-be criminals are simply dropping these things off at random homes in the hope that foolish people will just plug it in. Luckily for you, there was an old laptop sitting in the back of your closet. It hadn’t been used in years. Dragging it out, you plug it in and prepare to test out the unexpected package.<br />
<br />
It took mere seconds for the CD to boot up after plugging it into your laptop. The device itself seemed to hum with life the moment the CD was inserted. A screen flashed before you, again with no indication of who made the software. It was just a collection of drop-down menus surrounding a white window with the word “scanner” above it. After a few seconds, something popped up in this window. You gasped when you saw what it was. It was you, sitting cross legged on the floor in your white shirt and boxers, the tip of your penis poking through the opening slightly. Embarrassed, you tucked it back in and proceeded to experiment with the program. You had no clue how it had managed to scan your body, if that was in fact what it had done. Pushing the thought aside for the time being, you began to mess with the drop-down menus. The menus made little sense; they were just a collection of objects, animals, plants and other such things. One menu listed times ranging from mere seconds to months. Experimentally you clicked on “animal” and then on “body part” to see what it would do. The options in the drop-down menus changed to match it, with innumerable animals and body parts to choose from. You chose at random an udder, which replaced the groin of your model on screen. Again, you were confused by this seemingly pointless program until a new button appeared on the bottom of the screen; “apply changes.”<br />
<br />
Sweat rolled down your forehead as your cursor hovered over this new button. Something didn’t feel right. It felt like the air in the room had grown heavy as soon as this button appeared. You hadn’t clicked on it yet, but you could feel some sort of energy permeating your body. Nervously you clicked it and felt the hair on the back of your neck stand up. For a moment, nothing happened. You waited patiently for a few minutes in fact, while the program seemed to be processing something. Suddenly something felt off in your groin. You shifted slightly from discomfort as a tingling sensation flowed through your manhood. You looked down to see something unexpected, a growing bulge beneath your boxers even though it didn’t feel like you were becoming erect. You slide them off to see just what was happening to you and find that, rather than becoming erect, your manhood was swelling. You cup yourself with one hand and, startled, draw it back. Your genitals felt wrong somehow. They were soft, too soft, and the skin was turning pink. Experimentally you stroke your shaft with one hand and are pleased to find it quickly becomes erect as usual. Despite the softness, your penis seems to function as normal and you decide to masturbate in an attempt to see what might happen. This continues for only a short time, however. As you’re about to cum, an invisible force seems to be pulling your penis down, against your swollen balls. You still attempt to stroke it, but as your penis comes into contact with your balls it seems to fuse to them. You pull at it, trying desperately to pull it off your balls where it has started sinking into them. The act of pulling on your disappearing penis finally drives you to orgasm as cum shoots from the receding tip of your penis. In the afterglow of orgasm, you barely notice as your penis is completely absorbed by your testicles, which are now nothing more than a growing pink blob of flesh. <br />
<br />
As you regain your senses, you finally begin to realize what just happened. Looking down at the blob that had once been your manhood, you begin to freak out. You frantically type away at your computer while four bumps appear on the pink blob, quickly lengthened into teats, and dribbled milk onto the floor. You find the button for “reverse changes” and click on it, waiting impatiently for the damn thing to return your manhood to you. It took only a moment for the tingling sensation to return, this time to your udder, devoid of all pleasurable sensations. It began to shrink, the teats disappearing first. It soon split into two formless blobs which eventually reshaped themselves into your penis and testicles.<br />
<br />
You sat for a while in absolute speechlessness. This thing, this program or whatever it was, defied all explanation. It somehow was able to execute the changes applied on screen, changing your body to match. You were thankful it had been something simple. Anything more and you might not have been able to reverse the changes on your own. You struggled with the thought of turning it into the police. Perhaps they might know what to do with it. Something like this was clearly too dangerous to keep around. God only knows what kind of damage it could do. Still, the potential aroused some interest in you and, against your better judgement, you decided to keep it, albeit a well-kept secret.</p>
