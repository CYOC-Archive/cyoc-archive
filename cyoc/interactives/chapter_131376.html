<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jessica&#39;s Easter was different from the previous Easter. Unfortunately the snow and cold made the idea for an Easter Egg hunt with her and Roger playing the role of &quot;Easter Bunnies&quot; again a bit of a bad idea, and with the Spring Fair at the Claw Coliseum, they couldn&#39;t really move that indoors. However, Lyre and Animalia&#39;s roads were well plowed her dad ultimately gave her something she really liked, some driving practice. She had her learners permit in her purse and within easy reach and her dad was seated in the front passenger seat. Roger had also come along and was in the back seat.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, remember to take things slow and easy,&quot; her dad said to her, &quot;Especially with the roads being slick.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jessica nodded as she went around one corner being as gentle with the gas pedal as possible. The roads were plowed and plowed well, but the snow had come down late in the morning and gone pretty hard through the day. It was enough that it was soon sticking in places and made the driving conditions all the more hazardous, but in town with a speed limit of 25 miles per hour, that seemed more than easy enough for Jessica to handle the conditions, and she glanced down at the speedometer as she rounded the corner and she didn&#39;t think she&#39;d even got up to 15 miles per hour, let alone 25 miles per hour, and so far the little Bug kept its traction.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think all the plowmen have kept the roads pretty clear,&quot; Jessica said to her father.<br />
<br />
&quot;Doesn&#39;t mean you shouldn&#39;t pay attention,&quot; her father answered as they drove along, eventually coming up on the street that went by the Meat Market.<br />
<br />
Despite the inclement weather, the Meat Market was still rather busy, which had become something that was rather obvious ever since it was set up. Though, like with Christmas, because Easter was a heavily Christian holiday and that many in Animalia had accepted the religion, or at least the main tenants of it, the party at the Meat Market while it might be a bit more risqué than most other places&#39; Easter Parties, its normal shows that would include full nudity and the allowing for more adult fun in private in the club&#39;s locker/changing room wouldn&#39;t go on for Easter Sunday. Though the red lights of the back of cars as their drivers looked for parking spots and the sight of female Animalians dressed up like Playboy bunnies dashing across the street gave some indication that the party was still in good attendance.<br />
<br />
This business soon brought their route to a halt as Jessica didn&#39;t want to hit a white furred Rabbit Animalian running into the street, though she was dressed a bit differently. She wore tight fitting red dress that just barely covered her impressive white furred breasts. The dress also looked like it might be able to reflect some light, though given the weather she couldn&#39;t be sure.  The Animalian also had long red hair that had been combed to cover one eye. In many ways it gave Jessica the impression that this woman was the Animalian equivalent of Jessica Rabbit from the cartoon movie. She even had some dappling of black fur over the eye that Jessica could see which only reinforced the image. Jessica also thought this Rabbit Animalian was also a Holland Lop Eared breed of domesticated rabbit, as unlike her ears which stood erect and weren&#39;t very long by rabbit standards, this rabbit Animalian&#39;s ears were much longer and hung down over her hair.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, I know you!&quot; the rabbit Animalian spoke as she tapped on the driver&#39;s side window, making Jessica look nervously to her father.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do I know you?&quot; Jessica asked back, keeping the window closed.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m Shyra,&quot; the rabbit Animalian gave a very confident smile and Jessica thought there was a very sexual tone to her voice, &quot;I know you! You&#39;re the Jessica on Animalia Ambassadoria! Jessica Marion...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mariana,&quot; Jessica corrected, &quot;Pronounced Mary-Anna... It&#39;s Italian, right dad?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jessica looked back to her father who was frowning at Shyra&#39;s interrupting their drive, especially with the fact that she was also pressing her chest against the driver&#39;s side window. If Jessica had rolled the window down, he was sure his only daughter would have gotten face full of the woman&#39;s cleavage. And he could understand that Animalians had a higher libido than normal humans and could be more easily aroused. From some of the conversations he&#39;d overheard when Jessica and her friends were discussing plans for Animalia Ambassadoria episodes and he happened to be home, he could tell that Abby, Sarah, and Malice as double dosed Animalians and physically mature as a result had very adult interests and made that point obvious. However, he also knew that Animalia&#39;s edicts forbade public mating and he also knew that while Jessica&#39;s double dosed friends liked it, they also weren&#39;t about to give Jessica a second dose or use his home for their fun with their mates. In this, while he knew that Jessica was likely to grow into mature adult that was just as sexually driven as any other Animalian, he had the sense that Jessica would be able to grow up naturally, and at the same time, Roger had also been very respectful to Jessica and the rest of the Mariana family and was quite fine with them dating and maybe getting married in the future. That did NOT mean he wanted his daughter putting sex above anything else.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s what my dad told me that Ellis Island changed it to when my grandfather immigrated to the US,&quot; her father said slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;You guys here for the party?&quot; Shyra asked, &quot;there&#39;s no stripping and no sex because it&#39;s Easter... but that doesn&#39;t mean it can&#39;t be fun... and surely a growing girl would want to please her bond mate.&quot;<br />
<br />
At this Shyra looked to Roger, who looked a bit nervous in the backseat. Jessica also sat nervously, as in many ways, she DID want to please Roger in EVERY possible way. She knew she was growing up and had already grown out of some clothes. When she got her first dose from Judy&#39;s milk, she&#39;d been in a training bra, not even an A cup and her hips were rather straight with only the slightest curve to them. After her dose and after transformation into a single dosed Animalian, her chest had grown to a small B cup and her hips were much more noticeable. Now that she was past her sixteenth birthday she was now filling a C Cup bra and her hips were growing to balance out, and she knew she would grow still bigger and more voluptuous, not as big as Abby or even as big as Sarah and Malice, but then rabbits were smaller than horses and dogs.<br />
<br />
But she was well aware that she was growing up and that she wouldn&#39;t be a &quot;little girl&quot; for much longer. She could see Roger growing more muscular and fit, perhaps not as muscle bound as Samson, but he was trim and athletic and had been taking some martial arts lessons with his former owner, who treated Roger like a brother even though Roger was an Animalian and his &quot;brother&quot; was a normal human teen. In this, Jessica found Roger very attractive and privately DID want to be with him, but she wasn&#39;t going to say that in front of her father.<br />
<br />
&quot;Um... Shyra... we really need to get going and we&#39;re holding up traffic, so if you could go in, you can enjoy your party and we&#39;ll be on our way,&quot; Jessica said with a week grin, turning one ear to listen for anything her father might say.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on it&#39;ll be fun,&quot; Shyra answered, &quot;and I can show you how with your father. There won&#39;t be any nudity or actual sex or that sort of thing... it IS Easter, but it would be good tips.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I am HAPPILY married thank you,&quot; her father almost growled.<br />
<br />
&quot;My invitation could go to her too,&quot; Shyra&#39;s grin didn&#39;t diminish, &quot;Maybe arrange for a conversion... And you&#39;d have a whole family of cute bunnies. Then when Jessica marries her bond mate, you can all breed baby bunnies together.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t wanna watch Jessica&#39;s parents have sex,&quot; Roger spoke from the back seat, sounding lost and Jessica put her face in her paws trying to hide her embarrassment at the lack of shame Shyra had.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re smarter and more mature than she is,&quot; Jessica&#39;s father said to Roger and referring to Shyra and then glared at Shyra and said loudly, &quot;Lady... I&#39;m quite fine with Animalians being active with those they love. Especially with those that are physically mature. However, my daughter is only sixteen and is single dosed. I&#39;d prefer she wait until eighteen at the earliest to find out how to sexually please the man she loves. And even if something happens that drives her to do something she shouldn&#39;t... I&#39;d prefer it be in PRIVATE and not outside a known strip club.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But there&#39;s no stripping or sex at this party,&quot; Shyra countered.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s not the point,&quot; Jessica&#39;s father answered, &quot;the point is some common sense. The Meat Market IS a strip club, and while I can understand adults wanting a bit of fun of that nature, and if single adults want to be there, that&#39;s perfectly fine. But I am happily married. My wife and I are very happy with our species and do not wish to be Animalians. And I would appreciate it if you went inside and LEAVE MY DAUGHTER ALONE!&quot;<br />
<br />
Shyra finally backed off walked around the front of the car. Jessica cringed at the volume but understood what was said.</p>
