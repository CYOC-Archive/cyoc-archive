<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Finally we are here.” cried Lisa at nearly the top of her lungs as she headed out toward the beach. Her beach towel wrapped around her waist as she headed across the clear white sand toward a perfect spot to set up in her own mind at least. <br />
“It isn’t that far, our hotel room is only on the 4th floor.” Counted Rose as she followed carrying a small bag which had the sunscreen and like for their party. Behind her came the rest of their group. The 10 of them had been planning this week long break from the real world for over a year. All of them, had become best friends or more then friends where now either done with school and about to enter the work force or about to start grad or medical school. This was going to be their last trip together before starting their adult lives fully. <br />
“And we got it at a steal, since it is the off season.” added Tim as he walked forward in his green swim trunks, beside him carrying a large beach umbrella was his long term girlfriend Stacy. Tim was thin with black hair while Stacy had dirty blonde hair and was currently in a golden yellow bikini, she was actually the tallest women her being a good inch or two taller then her boyfriend. Both of them where brains, each one trying to outdo the other in intelligence tests and where the two smartest people in the group, maybe on the whole beach. Stacy had admitted to the other girls that her and Tim’s favorite thing to do in the bedroom was play strip chess. <br />
“Mike can you put some sunscreen on me?” inquired Rose as her boyfriend of nearly 3 years walked over and lifted her shoulder length red hair up and began to apply some sunscreen to her back. She was wearing a simple red bikini with two pink flowers on the material, one on her right breast the other on her left bottom. She jumped a bit as her boyfriend slipped a hand under her suit and put some sunscreen on her but. <br />
“Did I surprise you?” laughed Mike into her ear as Rose smiled and turned around to wrap her arms around the love of her life. Mike wasn’t tall but he was taller then Rose herself and while he didn’t have a six pack chest, he did have a strong core and had a swimmer’s body like she did. Truth be told when she first started dating Mike she was worried, she didn’t have the chest of some of her friends but Mike loved her that was sure and he was the kindest man she knew and loved him with all her heart and she knew he returned those feelings 100%.<br />
“Tonight.” She whispered looking him straight in those blue eyes which sat under his wild mop of blonde hair before slipping a hand under his own suit, one hand brushing his manhood. “Or maybe when we get into the water at least.”<br />
That caused a smile to form on his face as he looked around. The camp was almost totally set up, Lisa was already prepare to sunbath in her purple bikini golden blonde hair spread out on the towel behind her. <br />
Standing nearby was the wall flower of their group of friends but the kindest and gentlest member, Amanda. Of all the women, she was the only one in a one piece swimsuit, a silver and laic one piece which while modest couldn’t hide that she was the largest endowed women here. Her long black hair was pulled back.<br />
Beside her talking softly was Lisa’s boyfriend James, he was calm and cool with thick black hair and a clear as day 6 pack chest, he wasn’t a body builder but he clearly spent a lot of time in the gym. His simple dark blue suit worked well with his personality. <br />
He was talking with Taylor who was trying to convince him to a game of some kind or another. She was the sporty type of girl who played four or five sports and was always up for a game. Her jet black bikini not that different then her normal beach volleyball uniform and her short brown hair pulled back in a tight bun to avoid getting in her eyes. <br />
Nearby Monica was having another argument with her boyfriend of 9 passionate filled months Kyle, those two fought like cats and dogs but had passionate sex as often as rabbits. Monica was wearing a silver bikini looking great against her chocolate color skin which everyone knew would come off as soon as she and Kyle where alone, just like his black and red suit would. <br />
“How about we all go for a swim?” Mike as everyone looked at him. “We don’t know how long until more people show up, at the moment we own the beach.”<br />
Everyone agreed, apart from Lisa who had to be convinced to join them and together they all headed out into the water and began to swim and play. Unaware of what was about to happen.</p>
