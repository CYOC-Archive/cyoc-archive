<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Zack stood frozen for a moment, staring at his mother—well, her body—walking out the door in his body, humming a cheerful tune. The sheer wrongness of the situation made his head spin. He had spent the last week as a prisoner in his own body, and now that he finally had control, it was gone again. Maddie was loose in his body, and there was no telling what she would do with it. He needed to act fast.<br />
<br />
Molly’s voice snapped him back to reality. &quot;Well? Can you do it? Can you jump into me, Zack?&quot; she asked eagerly, her eyes wide and sparkly with excitement.<br />
<br />
Zack looked at her—at her small, naked form standing there in the doorway, completely unbothered by her lack of modesty—and groaned in frustration. He hated the idea of being in his little sister’s body, but it was better than staying in this. Anything would be better than being trapped in his mom’s overbearing, curvy frame. And if it meant he could chase down his mom and get his own body back, he was willing to try.<br />
<br />
&quot;I... I think I can,&quot; Zack muttered, closing his eyes. He focused on the strange, tingling sensation of his power—the same feeling he’d used to block Molly earlier. But this time, instead of putting up a wall, he pushed forward, almost as if he were trying to dive into something. He felt that falling sensation again, like he was sinking into a void, and when he opened his eyes, the world looked...different. Smaller.<br />
<br />
Zack looked down at himself—no, at Molly’s body. He was shorter now, his limbs thinner and lacking any real muscle definition. His flat chest was a relief after dealing with his mom’s burdensome curves, but it still felt weird to look down and see Molly’s tiny frame. He sighed heavily, feeling the long curtain of her brown hair tickling his face and shoulders.<br />
<br />
At least he wasn’t naked anymore. He turned to look at his mom’s body, which now stood in front of him with a big, goofy grin plastered across her face.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is so cool!&quot; Molly squealed, running her hands over Maddie’s adult frame. She grabbed her mom’s breasts and bounced them in her hands. &quot;Whoa, these are so heavy! No wonder Mom always complains about her back!&quot; Then she struck a dramatic pose, flipping her hair over her shoulder and speaking in her best imitation of their mom’s commanding tone. &quot;Now, missy, you need to get ready for school! And I’m going to pick out your clothes.&quot;<br />
<br />
Zack groaned again, realizing that Molly was fully embracing her role as their mother. He wanted to argue, but he also realized he had no other choice—he couldn’t just stand here naked in Molly’s body, especially if he was going to track down his mom.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine,&quot; Zack muttered reluctantly. &quot;Just hurry up, okay? I need to go.&quot;<br />
<br />
Molly—in their mom’s body—clapped her hands with glee and pulled Zack over to her room. &quot;Okay, okay, let’s see...what would Mom pick out for Molly to wear?&quot; She rummaged through Molly’s closet, pulling out a pair of tight, light-blue jeans that stopped above the ankles and a pink top with a glittery unicorn on it. &quot;Perfect!&quot; Molly declared, holding the outfit up for Zack to see. &quot;Oh, and you have to wear these,&quot; she added, tossing a pair of white panties with cartoon hearts on them at him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Seriously?&quot; Zack groaned, holding up the childish panties. &quot;Do I have to?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course!&quot; Molly said with a smirk, placing her hands on Maddie’s wide hips. &quot;You wouldn’t want to disrespect your mother, would you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Zack rolled his eyes but complied, slipping the underwear on. The jeans were even worse—they clung tightly to Molly’s small, thin legs and emphasized how slender her frame was. He felt ridiculous. The pink top only added to the humiliation, especially with the little bit of midriff it left exposed. But Molly wasn’t done yet.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now, sit down,&quot; she commanded, pulling out a brush and a bunch of hair ties. &quot;Your hair’s a mess. We need to fix it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Zack sighed but sat down, letting Molly comb through his sister’s long, annoying hair. She hummed cheerfully as she worked, pulling the strands into two neat pigtails. Zack stared at himself in the mirror, feeling more and more like a doll being dressed up for playtime.<br />
<br />
&quot;There!&quot; Molly said proudly, stepping back to admire her work. &quot;You look adorable! Now you’re ready for school.&quot;<br />
<br />
Zack stood up, feeling awkward in the tight jeans and pigtails. &quot;Thanks, I guess,&quot; he muttered, eager to be done with this. &quot;Can I go now?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course,&quot; Molly said, her tone suddenly serious and motherly. She folded her arms and gave him a stern look, clearly enjoying her temporary authority. &quot;But remember, young lady, I’m in charge now. And I expect you to behave yourself at school.&quot;<br />
<br />
Zack bit his tongue, not wanting to start another argument. &quot;Yeah, sure, whatever,&quot; he said, grabbing Molly’s small pink backpack and slinging it over one shoulder. He turned and headed out the door, muttering under his breath, &quot;This better work.&quot;<br />
<br />
Outside, Zack felt a wave of relief as the fresh air hit his face. It was strange being in Molly’s small body, but at least he could move freely now. He glanced back at the house, wondering what chaos Molly would cause while stuck in their mom’s body. But he couldn’t worry about that right now—he had to focus on catching up with his mom and figuring out how to switch back.<br />
<br />
He made his way toward the school, feeling self-conscious as he walked down the street in Molly’s outfit. The tight jeans and exposed ankles made him feel awkward, and he hated how the pigtails bounced with every step. But he pushed those thoughts aside and kept moving.<br />
<br />
Okay, Zack, he thought to himself. You just need to get close to Mom, and then... I guess I’ll try to do what I did with Molly? Jump into her and take my body back? The plan wasn’t perfect, but it was the best he could come up with.<br />
<br />
As he approached the school, Zack spotted himself—or rather, his mom in his body—standing near the entrance, chatting with some of his friends. She looked completely at ease, laughing and joking as if she hadn’t just hijacked her son’s life for the second time.<br />
<br />
Zack clenched his fists. This ends now.<br />
<br />
Taking a deep breath, he marched toward the school, determined to set things right!</p>
