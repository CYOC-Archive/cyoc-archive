<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">While Teri was browsing the internet, searching for crazy fetishes, she&#39;d tripped over something called &#39;Monster Girls&#39;- anime-inspired art of various monsters re-imagined as cute girls.  Among these creatures was the Slime.  Resembling a human girl made from translucent protoplasm, apparently this had become a fetish in it&#39;s own right, as perverted minds had imagined the possibilities of a semi-solid girl.  Slime girls could absorb people, or even merge with other slime girls, fusing into new hybrid girls.<br />
<br />
They could keep their shape because they could manipulate their surface tension, making their outer membranes impervious or permeable, as they desired.  Instead of a brain, they had a nucleus inside their bodies.  Teri was certainly curious as to how this all worked- what would it be like to have no internal organs, and become a giant single-celled organism?<br />
<br />
She had to do it, but she stopped to consider the logistics of what such a transformation would entail- she couldn&#39;t wear clothing, obviously, and if anyone saw her, they&#39;d freak the hell out.  Plus, would she be able to keep the ring on her finger?<br />
<br />
Well at least one of those things was easily solved.  &quot;I wish that I will always have the ring nearby and be able to use it, no matter how much my form has changed.&quot;  Oh, and then, &quot;I wish I could not be harmed in any way by changing my form.&quot;  That should do it!<br />
<br />
Then, staring at herself in the mirror, she made her wish.  &quot;I wish I was a slime girl.&quot;<br />
<br />
And her physical form collapsed into a glob of light pink goo.  &#39;Oh, that wasn&#39;t what I thought would happen!&#39;  She was still aware of her surroundings, but as she lacked eyes, she didn&#39;t see things so much as felt them.  It was very strange, having such an unusual spatial sense.  It couldn&#39;t be sonar, but maybe the ability to sense vibrations was involved.  She was glad she&#39;d made the previous wish about the ring, as she couldn&#39;t speak.  She wasn&#39;t even sure how she was breathing, lacking a mouth or lungs.  She felt the ring inside her somewhere, and knew she could use it, but decided to experiment more with her body first.<br />
<br />
She creeped along the floor slowly by extending a part of herself forward, then pulling the rest of her along.  For something without muscles, she was really strong!  She effortlessly oozed under the bathroom door, despite there only being a quarter inch gap between it and the floor.  She wondered if she was leaving a trail of protoplasm behind her, like a snail.  &#39;Eww, that would be gross.&#39;<br />
<br />
She found she could spread herself out to form a puddle, or coagulate into a spheroid shape.  She could make herself rigid or pliable.  This was actually fun!  She practiced extending pseudopods of her own body to touch things.  But now, the real test.  She concentrated, and was able to form, instead of a crude pseudopod, an arm.  If she had a mouth, she would giggle.  She discovered she could make more than one arm, and even gave herself seven arms, just for fun.  She then formed two, powerful arms, and pushed against the ground, trying to lift herself up.  As she did, her body reshaped itself, forming a head and a torso- if anyone was around to see it, it would look like a slime-covered girl was pulling herself up out of a puddle (even though the puddle was actually her body).<br />
<br />
Her head became more solid, and soon she had a face, and while she didn&#39;t have hair, she was able to give herself the illusion of hair, shaping her head like a mannequins.  Her torso became feminine, with small bumps that resembled breasts.  The hardest part was legs, her first attempt resulted in a large pair of arms instead.  She frowned as she had the hardest time forming actual feet.  Why hands were easy, but feet were difficulty was curious- she was eventually able to form credible legs, but instead of human feet, hers instead resembled wedge heeled boots.<br />
<br />
She was able to create eyes of a sort- her vision wasn&#39;t great, but it was something.  She even had eyelids, even though she could still see through them when they were closed- it was more to simulate human facial expressions.  All in all, she was proud  of her handiwork- she only somewhat veered into the &#39;uncanny valley&#39;, and, in many ways, saw her new form as more beautiful than her human one.<br />
<br />
Walking took some practice, as she really didn&#39;t have bones or muscles, but her legs held, and she found she had a good sense of balance despite not having the structure of a human&#39;s inner ear- actually she didn&#39;t even have ears.  Or teeth- she could open her mouth, and could form a pseudopod to function as a tongue, but she had no throat.  Even her nose was cosmetic- she had all five human senses, somehow, or at least an approximation of them, but she had no idea how that worked.<br />
<br />
The only problem that remained was speech.  She had no lungs, no windpipe, and had no idea how to form a larynx.  She could solve this with a wish, of course, but she&#39;d wanted to see how far she could get on her own.  <br />
<br />
&#39;Not bad for a mobile pile of sludge, Teri.&#39;</p>
