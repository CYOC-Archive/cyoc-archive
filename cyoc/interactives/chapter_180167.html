<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It had been two weeks since John and Sara discovered the amulet. Seeing as they had no kids or grandchildren to speak of plus they had all the money they could ever need, they did the only thing they could do fuck. The young-old couple had been having sex non stop going through condoms like they were going out of fashion. There were other benefits to being young again as Sara and John didn’t have arthritis anymore. They don’t really leave the house much <br />
<br />
1.Cause it would be weird to explain why a couple in there mid twenties is suddenly occupying the house of a wealthy 60 year old couple <br />
<br />
2.Also they can order everything online (technology is great) <br />
<br />
Bill did see John and Sara getting a package one time and just waived. They asked him if he wanted another go and Bill said no thanks before going back to his home. <br />
<br />
However, Sara seemed a little off and John wanted to know why. After making breakfast for her, John asked if she was doing okay.<br />
<br />
“So Sara are you okay?” in between sips of coffee <br />
<br />
“Yeah hun everything is okay” eating her muffin <br />
<br />
“Are you sure?” <br />
<br />
“Yes, John why must you keep asking!” Rolling her eyes <br />
<br />
“See right there that’s why I am asking” <br />
<br />
“What?!”<br />
<br />
“The fucking eye roll and sarcasm clearly something is wrong Sara, I want to help you.” <br />
<br />
“Well you can’t help me!” She said before storming off <br />
<br />
“What the fuck John?” John said while still sitting at the table <br />
<br />
John knew Sara long enough to know that she needed space and that after a while he would be able to talk to Sara after she cooled down. It was about an hour after (10:30 a.m.) when he went into the bedroom where Sara retreated to. <br />
<br />
“Dear may I come in?”<br />
<br />
“Yes John you can come in” <br />
<br />
“Sara-“<br />
<br />
“First John I apologize for lashing out earlier today. You were just asking me a question.”<br />
<br />
“That’s totally fine dear” John said sitting on the bed next to his wife<br />
<br />
“John, I want something but I am not sure if you are okay with it.”<br />
<br />
“Okay what is it?”<br />
<br />
“I want you to be Mandy”<br />
<br />
“Okay we can do that for the day”<br />
<br />
<br />
“Not for the day”<br />
<br />
“Okay week”<br />
<br />
“More like as long as we live”<br />
<br />
“Oh, I see, am I not providing enough as a partner as my young self?”<br />
<br />
“No John, I love you, you are my soulmate now and forever, but I prefer you as my “twin” Mandy. See John I have always found the idea of incest porn to be hot. I would never commit actual incest as that’s immoral but the idea of something so yummy coming out of something so sinful gets me going. Plus I was an only child John. Something just felt so wrong and right about fucking my “twin” sister Mandy. I could indulge in my darkest fantasies while still being with my soulmate. I know it sounds weird John but I want this so badly. I know it’s asking for a lot.”<br />
<br />
<br />
John looked at his wife and just thought about everything she was saying. It was true he did feel closer to Sara while he was Mandy. Plus while the sex was great with his young body, it still didn’t beat the lesbian sex he had as Mandy. John knew what had to happen. He wanted to be young but this time as woman. He walked to the closet once more. Like last time he made sure to preserve this form not that he would be using it much. He stripped naked once again. Everything came full circle. Funny how the first time he became a twin of Sara by accident and now he was doing it on purpose. A purpose to make his soulmate happy. <br />
<br />
He touched the amulet. Soon he felt his body change once more. He shrank to 5’5”. His pecs replaced with perky D cups. His wife’s kissable lips and curves grew along with a firm ass. He felt the long wavy blonde hair cascading down to her waist. Soon his penis was replaced with a tight pussy. Soon John was a bombshell again. She looked into the mirror to see not Sara but Mandy. She then looked through all the clothes Sara bought. She found a cute pale blue sundress similar to the one Sara was wearing right now. She put her hair in a ponytail and went to her ”twin” <br />
<br />
”So Sara what do you think?” <br />
<br />
”You look perfect Mandy, thanks for the breakfast this morning!” <br />
<br />
”You&#39;re welcome sister dearest” <br />
<br />
Mandy and Sara spent the entire coming up with a backstory to their ”incestuous” relationship. They discovered they loved each other romantically at the age of 17. Mandy realized as they were coming up with a story that her libido was twice as high while a woman. It didn&#39;t help Sara was coming up with such a hot 24/7 foreplay. <br />
<br />
After dinner, the two sisters retreated to the couch to watch the news. After the broadcast was over Sara looked at Mandy with her signature fuck me now look. Mandy looked back and finally did the same look. The two couldn&#39;t strip and go to the bedroom fast enough. Soon they were having primal sex. Wrestling on the bed. Sara was able to pin Mandy down and began to rub both of their pussies against one another. <br />
<br />
”Fuck yes Sara fuck your sister!”<br />
<br />
This got Sara going. Mandy then fisted Sara hard. <br />
<br />
”Yes Mandy, right there!” <br />
<br />
After many orgasms, the two sisters basked in the afterglow with the moonlight on them. Mandy felt so close to her ”sister” Sara. Everything felt so much better-being twins with Sara and she shed tears of happiness. <br />
<br />
Mandy hugged Sara. <br />
<br />
”I love you, Sara, I will love being twins for the rest of our lives!”<br />
<br />
”I love you so much too Mandy, I am glad we can take our marriage to the next level.” <br />
<br />
The twins exchanged one final kiss before going to sleep smiling knowing they get to be like this forever.</p>
