<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Pascal stayed awake just long enough to make sure Alex’s first shift wasn’t going to be something big enough to destroy the bed, or small enough that Pascal would have to move him so as not to crush him. He had a fairly good guess as to what the boy’s spirit would shift him into, but he wanted to be safe. When he noticed that one of Alex’s hands had been replaced by a tell-tale canine paw, he felt comfortable snuggling back up to the new shapeshifter to get some sleep.<br />
<br />
The smell of sweat and sex woke Alex from sleep. The smell was stronger than any Alex had ever experienced; so strong it was as if he had fallen asleep face down in another man’s armpit. He opened his eyes to a large protrusion between them. A confused whine escaped his lips, which didn’t help his confusion. Alex glanced down, seeing a large beefy arm over his now furry midsection and two paws where his hands should have been. In a panic, he wriggled free of the arm draped over him and ejected himself from the bed, only to find he was just about eye level with the edge and standing on all fours. Panicked whines and barks erupted from him as he looked over one shoulder to see a large furry tail curling up from his backside, as well as when he looked between his front legs to survey his new sheath and plump furry scrotum. It seemed his panic had woken the owner of the large beefy arm, hearing a bemused chuckled coming from the bed. He raised his glance and met Pascal’s, and the events of the night before started coming back to him.<br />
<br />
Pascal sat up, still half draped in his covers. “I thought your first shift was going to be a dog, but I wasn’t certain. Kind, loyal, and obedient; there aren’t many other forms that fit.”<br />
<br />
Alex’s ears flattened and he let out of woof of protest.<br />
<br />
“Hey kid, obedient isn’t a ‘bad’ thing. Especially if you’re training under a wizard” Pascal retorted with a wink.<br />
<br />
Alex gave a confused “Awoo”.<br />
<br />
“Of course I can understand you. I’m the one who blessed/turned you. I’ll be able to understand you no matter what form you’re in. Though, to anyone else it would look like I’m just having a one sided conversation with a dog. Also, once you figure out how to change more than just the physical, you’ll find you can communicate with whatever species you happen to be.”<br />
<br />
Alex raised an eyebrow.<br />
<br />
“Yes, physically you are 100% dog. Mostly a mix of shepherd and husky by the looks of you. But mentally, right now you’re still a human. Once you have the body, you can continue the shift to take on the instincts and mentality of whatever you’ve shifted into. It makes movement a lot easier if it’s your first time on four legs, and especially helps with flying. Though you have to be careful you don’t slip too much into your other mentality, otherwise you won’t know to change yourself back and I would have to step in. Not much utility in that, so you have to be careful.” Pascal had shifted to sit on Alex’s side of the bed with his feet on the floor. Alex was finding it difficult to focus on what Pascal said due to his new much more sensitive nose and the smell of sex coming from between Pascal’s legs.<br />
<br />
“Kid? Kid? Hey! Kid! Eyes up here!” Pascal laughed. “I guess we should get you back to human so you can focus on what I need to teach you. Can’t blame ya though, it’s been a while since I’ve been a dog but I vaguely remember how powerful that new nose of yours is. Now, before I blessed you last night while you were laying on my bed I did a sort of, I dunno, mental painting of your human body so I could make sure you had it as a form you could shift to. Otherwise, this would be it and you would have to start collecting forms as a dog.”<br />
<br />
Alex’s ears snapped back and he let out an astonished woof.<br />
<br />
“Sorry kid, er, pup now I guess. This dog is now your default. Don’t worry, you can spend as much time as you like in other forms, but I bet before long you’ll prefer these paws to your old feet. Okay, so, I can only explain the process as it’s been told to me. I can just magic myself into whatever I want, but the process is a bit different for you. You need to, I guess, meditate into the body you want to shift to. It helps at first if you close your eyes until you get the hang of it.” Alex closed his eyes. “Okay, now you should be able to see your human body in your mind. Do you see it?” Pascal asked.<br />
<br />
Alex nodded and gave an affirmative woof.<br />
<br />
“Okay, good. Now, imagine being in that body. Moving in that body. Feeling, smelling, seeing the world through that body.”<br />
Alex drifted into concentration. He focused on standing on two legs, on drawing his hands into fists and relaxing them, even on being laid on his back while Pascal penetrated him the night before. In his concentration, he didn’t feel his tail shrink back into his spinal column. He didn’t notice the fur recede and his human body hair grown back in. He didn’t notice his hind legs lengthen so that he no longer stood on four legs, rather on hands and knees. He kept concentrating on what it felt like to be human, and before long a loud clap and “Good work pup!” broke him from his reverie. He opened his eyes. His vision no longer obstructed by a muzzle, he found himself face to crotch with his mentor, and craned his neck back to look up at Pascal’s smiling face.<br />
<br />
“Okay pup. I’m going to teach you what I’ve been taught about this shapeshifter business. Come on, sit up here next to me.” Alex placed a hand on Pascal’s knee for support and lifted himself to sit next to him on the bed. “Unfortunately, you don’t start off being able to shift into anything you want. You have to, er, ‘acquire your shapes’ for lack of a better term. There’s two ways to do this. First, you have to be close enough to see the person or thing you want to acquire. Then, you focus your energy on them. You can do it just by watching, but that takes time. If you can touch them, the acquisition is nearly instant.”<br />
<br />
Alex smirked. “Like this?” He said, focusing on Pascal then closing his eyes. The bed creaked as his weight increased. Muscle and fat grew all over his body, he gained inches in height, and dark body hair sprouted. His flaccid cock grew in length and girth, his testicles swelled. Alex opened his eyes to see Pascal grinning at the Pascal sitting next to him. The only things that differentiated the two of them was the lack of tattoos on Alex’s skin, and the fact that Pascal’s cock was not flaccid.<br />
<br />
“Cute pup. Yes, like that. You’re a quick learner, and if I don’t say so myself I am quite sexy” Pascal winked.<br />
<br />
“Yes you are” Alex replied before leaning in to connect their lips in a passionate kiss. His cock was beginning to harden as he ran his hands through the hair on his mentor’s chest and back.<br />
<br />
Pascal pulled back. “Mmm, you’re quite the kisser pup, but I have a bit more to teach you.” Pascal wrapped a meaty hand around Alex’s erection, “We’ll have plenty of time for this later. Now get up and stand a couple feet in front of me.”<br />
<br />
Alex obliged, feeling the weight of his pendulous sack pulling on his groin with every step. “Ooof, these things are huge!” he said, hefting them in his right hand. “How to you get anything done?”<br />
<br />
Pascal laughed. “Well, I got used to em I guess. Of course I got them at a more gradual pace than you did. Now, here’s how to get back to your primary pup shape. It’s a bit different, but just as easy. Close your eyes again and focus on the shape you’re in.” Alex complied. “Now, all you have to do to is focus on letting go of that shape. Some shifters have told me they imagine themselves taking the shape off like they’re getting naked, others have said they just feel themselves letting it go and watch it float away.”<br />
<br />
Alex focused. He started shrinking, his muscles pulling in as they changed structure. His cock, still erect and dripping, angled more toward his body, changing hue to a crimson red, and the head losing definition and coming to a point. A furry cream sheath encased his cock, attaching it to his lower belly. Alex could vaguely feel the changes, though he focused more on letting go of his Pascal shape. Meanwhile, Pascal sat transfixed watching Alex. The novelty of watching a shapeshifter change never lost on him. Alex’s ears grew pointed and repositioned to the top of his head. His nose darkened and dampened, then pushed out away from his face with his mouth. Alex was still shrinking in height and mass, body hair turning softer as more fur grew in. Alex’s shoulders shifted, his arms lost muscle definition and fingers shrunk into paws. His ankles grew away from his feet, changing his stance until he feel forward onto his front paws. His still human testicles shrank and the sack grew taught as cream fur covered them and they pulled up closer to his hole. His chest barreled out, and a fluffy curled tail grew from his spine.<br />
<br />
“Good work pup!” Pascal praised. “Now I’d say at this point you’re 100% canine physically, but I want to guide you through the mental change too so you experience it and get an idea of when to stop. Just keep imagining yourself sinking like you were, maybe for another five seconds.”<br />
<br />
Alex focused on sinking more, and as he did he felt himself actually become happier. More carefree. “Okay pup, stop. Open your eyes” Pascal said. Alex opened his eyes.<br />
<br />
“Good boy!” Pascal exclaimed. Alex felt a jolt of euphoria run through him at this praise, his tail wagging.<br />
<br />
“Come here boy!” Pascal said in a sing-songy voice. Without having to question how to move four limbs, Alex trotted right up to Pascal, sticking his snout between his legs and inhaling his mentor’s scent.<br />
<br />
“Ohh, haha, good boy. Okay, now sit.” Pascal commanded. The jolt rushed through Alex again, and he lowered his hind legs to the ground. He looked up at Pascal with a panting smile.<br />
<br />
“See pup? Told ya. Obedient.” Pascal said with a smirk. Alex continued to pant. “Oh Gods, did I let you go too far? Are you still in there Alex?” Pascal said with concern.<br />
<br />
Alex’s consciousness came to the forefront as he took stock of his situation. Had he really just taken commands? Why had praise from Pascal made him feel so content? He flattened his ears and nodded yes, giving a disapproving wruff.<br />
<br />
“Oh calm down pup. Now you know what it’s like to let the canine take control.” Pascal said with a laugh.<br />
<br />
Alex retorted with an annoyed couple of yips.<br />
<br />
“Obedient is not a negative trait pup. Here, I’ll show ya.” And switching to a sing-songy voice again, “Who’s a good boy? You are! Yes you are! Now lay down and roll over!”<br />
<br />
The euphoria from praise shook Alex’s control and he felt his body laying his front paws on the ground and rolling onto his back.<br />
“And good boys get belly rubs!” Pascal exclaimed. He knelt down off of his bed onto one knee and began running his fingers through Alex’s belly fur. Alex lost it. The pleasure from the scritches he was receiving and the praise along with it decimated any sense of time or space. All of his existence was centered on the magic fingers of his Master running through his fur. His tongue hung from the side of his muzzle and his tail wagged furiously. This continued until the glorious fingers broke contact with his skin and his faculties slowly started to return. He glanced up at Pascal’s grinning face, “See?”<br />
<br />
Quicker than he knew he was capable of moving, Alex rolled back over and jumped to a sitting position on his haunches, berating Pascal with yips and barks.<br />
<br />
“Whoa pup. Watch your language. Trust me, you have nothing to be embarrassed about. Plus...” Pascal said, glancing at Alex’s half erect cock sticking out of his sheath, “You liked it.”<br />
<br />
Alex glanced down at his cock, then returned his gaze to Pascal, giving a wruff of annoyance.<br />
<br />
“Look, it might not that useful for the errand I’m sending you on, but once you can control it you might like letting your inner dog take control. It can be nice to just let go, be happy and carefree, and live the life of a pet for a couple of days. Plus, I know from experience how good my praise felt to you, and I can see how much you enjoyed the belly rub” Pascal said, still smirking.<br />
<br />
Alex wruffed again, breaking eye contact.<br />
<br />
Pascal’s tone turned serious. “Look pup, I get that this is a lot to take in, but insubordinate behavior like this isn’t going to fly if I’m going to mentor you. I just gave you a pretty powerful gift and taught you how to use it and all I’m getting are a bunch of yips and back-barking.”<br />
<br />
Alex lowered his head and woofed softly.<br />
<br />
Pascal stood, “Apology accepted. Like I said, it’s a lot to take in. Now, there’s just one more thing I want you to do for me before we go downstairs and check on Marsyas.”<br />
<br />
Alex returned his gaze to Pascal. Pascal uttered a few unintelligible words under his breath, and in a blink a Mastiff stood in Pascal’s place. Alex’s muzzle hung open. The Mastiff gathered himself from the change in position, turned his back to face Alex, and lifted his tail. He turned his head to look over his shoulder at Alex. “Fuck me pup” the Mastiff said in Pascal’s voice.<br />
<br />
“What!” Alex exclaimed, though the sight of Pascal’s large furry nuts hanging below his tailhole was giving Alex another erection.<br />
<br />
“You heard me, fuck me. It’s been way too long since I’ve been knotted and I miss the feeling. “ Pascal said, impatience in his voice.<br />
<br />
“But I... you... you’re...” Alex stammered, even as he approached his large furry mentor.<br />
<br />
“I’m what? A big hairy guy? That doesn’t mean I don’t enjoy a dick in me just as much as I enjoy having my dick in someone else. Now, are you going to sniff my butt and fuck me, or do I have to magic up your inner dog to do it for you?” <br />
<br />
Alex smirked and stuck his nose up under Pascal’s tail, using his new dexterous tongue to lick Pascal’s furry nuts.<br />
<br />
“Mmmm” Pascal murred. “Good boy.”</p>
