<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Six months ago, she would&#39;ve written the ad off as some kind of prank... but six months ago, the news hadn&#39;t been dominated by stories about superhuman bimbos and magic-slinging special forces units.<br />
<br />
The world had gotten very strange, very fast ever since the recent revelation of magic and the supernatural to the general public. All sorts of people and creatures who&#39;d been forced to hide their paranormal natures had suddenly become a lot more open - and despite the initial shock, the world was adjusting. There weren&#39;t any major riots in the street, no organized anti-magical racism yet, no people organizing mass witch hunts or trying to murder werebimbos in the street. No, the Earth had been shocked for about a week - and after that, the supernatural had very quickly become another mundane part of life.<br />
<br />
Brianna thus failed to so much as bat an eye as she read the job listing on her phone. The Guild of Hunters, a group that had been highly secretive a month ago, had suddenly seen itself thrust into the spotlight - because while most magical creatures were integrating into society, there were more than a few who&#39;d taken the lifting of the Veil as an opportunity to strike out and seek power, or just fulfill homicidal urges. They were in need of new recruits to help with their vastly expanded workload... and they were offering <i>enhancements</i>. Codeword for magical transformations, an extremely popular luxury in the last few weeks.<br />
<br />
Hell with it, she could probably work that kind of job. Brianna was relatively young, in excellent shape, even a little bit pretty with her platinum blonde, near-white hair, robust jawline, and icy blue eyes. Ex-military to boot... well, she&#39;d been a cook in the Navy, but still, she knew how to use a rifle. If nothing else, it&#39;d get her out of the house and put some money in the bank after a whole fat lot of unemployment following her discharge. God knows that dad would be eager to see her save up and get her own place - he was constant in his reminders that she needed to go be a functioning member of society now that she was out of the service.<br />
<br />
So after scarfing down the rest of her breakfast and grabbing some decent casual clothing - the ad had indicated applicants should show up dressed to do physical labor, jeans and t-shirts and boots being ideal - she was headed out into the streets of Nashville to walk out to the office from the ad. She was greeted almost immediately with sights that would&#39;ve made her think she was going insane not long ago, but the variety of inhuman creatures both on and above the street hardly fazed her anymore. There just wasn&#39;t anything all that weird about seeing a harpy flapping above the rooftops or a mermaid in a wheelchair heading down the street, not when there were potions available in quite a few stores that could let one become another species for a day or two. Even the numerous public displays of affection weren&#39;t all that bothersome - most witches, magical women, and mythological ladies being some flavor of lesbian was yet another thing the world was just sort of accepting.<br />
<br />
Honestly? It didn&#39;t even bother her that much, hopping onto the long tail of a naga instead of a bus. Snake people like the ebony-skinned, silver-scaled woman providing her current transport were rapidly proving to be a lot cheaper to have as public transport than buses were. Nashville happened to have ended up at the forefront of replacing infrastructure with magical means, a process people expected to see rolled out extensively over the next few years - and really, as long as it made the daily commute a bit less of a fucking nightmare, most people seemed okay with that. The very few fringe lunatics opposed to progress of this shape would end up filtering out to the countryside eventually, where they wouldn&#39;t bother much of anyone.<br />
<br />
The morning was honestly kind of boring, if she was going to be honest. Showing up at the skyscraper housing the main office of the Guild in this city, Brianna was marching up to the elevator and riding it up without batting an eye at the six-breasted woman who accompanied her. It was kind of tame, really, seeing a woman with three gigantic sets of tits - the average bust size of the United States had climbed near-exponentially in the past half-year, to the point that an E-cup was considered normal, and A or B-cups were taken as a sign of poverty more than anything else. Brianna&#39;s own chest, large by previous standards, was now quaint with its DD size... though she was still considering getting a back strength enhancement, since they remained a heavy bit of weight on her chest.<br />
<br />
Stepping out of the elevator after it arrived near the top floor, she was greeted with what could only be described as pure chaos. A huge collection of men and women crammed into an office space clearly not designed for this many people - office workers, people who looked ready for war, scattered managers, it was nice and diverse. More notably, half the people here - especially the ones with weapons and armor - were angelic beauties. Literal angelic beauties - apart from the divinely gorgeous faces, they had actual white wings and perfect body shapes. Actual, literal angels, some of whom had probably been human until quite recently. Her gaze lingered on their beauty before she shook herself out of it, approaching a beleagured looking woman without wings, yet no less radiantly beautiful even through her clearly worn-down expression. &quot;Excuse me, I&#39;m ah, I&#39;m here about the job posting for Hunters-&quot;<br />
<br />
The woman cut her off by lifting up a rock inscribed with a golden sigil, the stone unleashing a beam of light that scanned Brianna. After a moment, the woman&#39;s computer dinged. &quot;You&#39;re hired. Talk to Jem, third room on your left, she&#39;ll get you started.&quot;<br />
<br />
Brianna blinked. &quot;That&#39;s... that&#39;s it? No interview or...?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Lady, I got a lot to do here, so maybe move on?&quot;<br />
<br />
Sighing, she decided not to fight it, nodded quietly before heading off to find the office the receptionist had indicated. The signage at least made it easy, directing her to what seemed to be the intake room for new employees. Inside, she found a whole lot more collected rocks with various glowing runs, overseen by an older woman who looked even more tired than the receptionist. Jem, if she had to guess. The 40-something-looking brunette huffed upon seeing Brianna enter, waving for her to come inside. &quot;C&#39;mon now girl, get a move on, haven&#39;t got all day.<br />
<br />
&quot;Right, sorry,&quot; Brianna said, picking up the pace as she approached the older woman. &quot;So uh, where exactly am I starting?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;With this.&quot; She grabbed one of the rocks, placing it in both of Brianna&#39;s hands, before forcing her hands to close around it. To the blonde&#39;s surprise, it crumbled into dust, a warm sensation filling her hands as something glowed within them. Eyes grew wide with wonder as magical energy previously held within the stone was now funneled into her body - and before long, she let out a gasp of surprise and pleasure as she felt it working its way through her form, reshaping and remaking it into something far mroe suited for her new line of work.<br />
<br />
She&#39;d always been of average height, but the magic quickly began to stretch this out, dragging her body up to be an even six feet tall with appropriate changes to her proportions. And then ehhancements to said proportions, as she felt her chest and rear end swell up, the warmth that accompanied the changes making her bite her lip and moan as it felt like her most sensitive regions were being expertly worked over. She couldn&#39;t help but squeeze her chest through an increasingly tight shirt, at the same noticing the extra muscle being packed on. She remained slender and femine in her frame, but now the definition of her muscles had greatly increased, making visible the raw power she commanded. Physical power, and holy power - she smiled as her hair took on a pristine shine, her hands crackling with a golden light to purge demonic influences and silence the undead. <br />
<br />
The biggest change, though, was the one that propogated in her back. Her shirt was magically altered to provide openings as two large, beautiful wings tore from her body, stretching out with white feathers and a crackling of rearranged bones. She grunted at the feeling of these extra limbs, but upon turning her head to get a look at one, found herself mesmerized by how gorgeous and pure they were. A little laugh of shock left her mouth as she realized she&#39;d become a bona fide angel, a servant of heaven charged with guarding mortals against those would would damn their souls, all while being striking in her beauty and grace.<br />
<br />
Ohhhh, Brianna would&#39;ve liked to spend some time exploring the nooks and crannies of this form, but Jem had other ideas. The haggard woman quickly grabbed Brianna by the arm, dragging her up a few flights of stairs to the roof of the building. &quot;Need to get you started training,&quot; she muttered, pulling the blonde over to the edge. &quot;Make sure you figure out how to fly.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh... alright,&quot; she responded, still a little bit marveled at the creature she&#39;d become. &quot;So... do we start with flapping, or...?&quot;<br />
<br />
She got her answer as Jem unceremoniously shoved her off the building&#39;s edge. &quot;Figure out flight!&quot; she shouted down as Brianna screeched and hurtled towards an unfortunate meeting with the pavement hundreds of stories below.</p>
