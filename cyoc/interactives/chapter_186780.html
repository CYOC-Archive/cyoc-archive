<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Tommy was in a panic. Staring down at him was a giant of a man, with a condom-clad penis that looked so long that if it were next to him, he would need to gaze upwards just to see the tip. All Tommy could think to do was count the seconds until he changed back and berate himself for all the time, he should have spent so that he wouldn’t be in this predicament. Tommy began thinking back to several minutes ago, just after he hastily pressed enter.<br />
<br />
He couldn’t move, it was like he had no muscles at all. What’s more, when he tried to look around, he found that instead of eyes, he had full vision in all directions. The sensory overload took a minute to recover from. It would have been much worse if he wasn’t in a dark place, all he could see was a sliver of light coming through what appeared to be a door in front of him. Then he realized he could still hear, but what he heard only fueled his discomfort. It sounded like moans coming from where the light came in.<br />
<br />
He considered when he hurried through the menus of the Chronivac. He had been in such a rush to transform himself that he neglected to double check if the transformation had been entered correctly. After calming his mind enough to think logically, he tried to consider what he had become. He certainly wasn’t a cat because cats should be able to move. So, he must have been accidentally turned into the rubber toy, what kind of toy was he? If he was the toy, what did Bella’s cat become, did she just stay unchanged?<br />
<br />
More questions passed through Tommy’s mind until he noticed something about his surroundings. Around him were vibrators, dildos, flesh-lights, and anal-beads galore. Thus, confirming his biggest fear that he was a rubber toy, specifically a sex toy. The sounds that came from outside, Tommy could swear that could not be just one person. In fact, it distinctly sounded like a man and a woman going to town. He shamed himself for not noticing this sooner. Just beyond his pitch-black prison, he heard someone approaching.<br />
<br />
All his surroundings shifted at once. Overhead was the man who only now noticed him. Tommy felt overwhelmed as all the light now hit him. Now he could confirm he was in a drawer, clearly the drawer that held Bella and this burley man’s sex toys. After recalling how he got into this horrific situation, he heard Bella’s soft voice “Don’t worry James, just grab any of them. I made sure they’re all good.”<br />
<br />
James cracked a grin, and reached down, grabbing the one toy that happened to be Tommy. Bella was on her hands and knees, waiting for James to come back to the bed. When he lifted a giant black butt-plug out of the drawer, Bella gave him a confused look, “I don’t remember that one.”<br />
<br />
“Oh,” said James as he came back to the bed behind Bella, “well then maybe this will give you a reminder.” James proceeded to stick Tommy in his mouth, and push Bella down into doggy style position.<br />
<br />
Tommy was getting soaked in James’s saliva. Despite believing himself to be strait, Tommy couldn’t help but feel a bit of fulfilment at being placed inside a tight hole, even if that hole belonged to a man. When James pulled him out, Tommy was shocked at how much he wanted to be put back in. Fortunately, his reasoning kicked in and he looked down at Bella, who was now being railed from behind. She let out soft moans as James pumped away at her. James then lowered Tommy down to her asshole. He felt a wave of disgust as he considered exactly what type of sex-toy he was. James was quick, Bella let out a roaring moan as Tommy, now nothing more than their object of pleasure, was shoved in her tight ass.<br />
<br />
Tommy could see very little, only being able to look directly out her asshole, but what he could see was that James and Bella had decided to speed things up. Being squeezed inside the walls of Bella’s rectum was something Tommy couldn’t help but feel as pure delight. When the pressure suddenly tightened in sharp pulses, Tommy knew Bella had climaxed. It was not one minute later, that James followed suit.<br />
<br />
James got up, letting Bella slump down on the bed. He left the room to dispose of his condom, leaving Bella curled up in a ball of pleasure, and Tommy still lodged inside. Tommy, of course, couldn’t complain. He felt only a warm sense of comfort. He did find it somewhat disconcerting when Bella proceeded to put on a pair of panties. Tommy assumed that she would be putting on more clothes, yet, not to his disappointment, she didn’t seem to have any intention of removing him.<br />
<br />
As Bella began moving towards the doorway James came out of the bathroom, still completely naked. James walked over to where he had left his pants on the ground, Bella clearly staring at his now flaccid penis. The two walked downstairs together, still in post-sex afterglow. Once they reached the living room, James laid down and used the tv remote to put on a show, while Bella snuggled up in his arms.<br />
<br />
James could feel the butt-plug they had used still in her. He asked why she still had it, and she just looked up at him, “Just something for later to keep me in the mood.” she giggled.<br />
<br />
Tommy, in the confines of her tight asshole, finally had time to think about his situation. He started to wonder, if he had messed up who would be transformed, was there any other part of this transformation that he messed up? Trying to think back he couldn’t remember making any other mistakes, but only time would tell. No longer feeling any form of panic, disgust, or discomfort, Tommy began to relax, and just let time decide what happened next.</p>
