<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;There are not many boys left...&quot; Mr. Turin said as he watched at the people around him, mostly almost naked grown men. &quot;Wyatt... You&#39;re next.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;M me?&quot; The 11 years old chubby boy stuttered. &quot;N now?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yep.&quot; Mr. Turin said as he aimed at the shaking boys. &quot;Or will you try to run away like Carlos?&quot;<br />
<br />
Wyatt glanced at the disturbing mexican guy that is trying to cover his fat shaft protruding from his tight undies and shuddered. He knew that he can&#39;t escape from this so he accepted his fate and closed his eyes waiting for mr. Turin&#39;s beam.<br />
<br />
He kept his eyes closed all the time but, almost instantly, Wyatt felt as if small ants were crawling all around his body. He wanted to scratch his arms and legs so badly but he stood still.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t you wanna see what&#39;s happening to your body?&quot; Frank asked Wyatt, but he refused to open his eyes despite he was feeling very itchy all over his body.<br />
<br />
Although, he didn&#39;t want to look, everyone else was watching how hair began to sprout at his arms.<br />
<br />
&quot;He&#39;s half italian, right?&quot; Mr. Turin asked Frank who looked in the list and then nodded. &quot;Good. He will be an interesting test subject! He is just starting puberty and he already has body hair!&quot;<br />
<br />
We looked down at his legs to find that the same thing was happening to them as well. &quot;That&#39;s gross.&quot; Little Henry said as he watched Wyatt&#39;s legs getting darker by the excessive amount of hair.<br />
<br />
Wyatt was so confused. He knew that he was changing and everybody was seeing him growing up, but he can&#39;t do anything but stay still and close his eyes. For a brief moment, he thought about leaving and hide in his cabin but then he started to feel his shoes were getting really tight.<br />
<br />
 &quot;Look how his feet are growing! His shoes will burst out in any moment!&quot; Shane said and he noticed the discomfort in Wyatt&#39;s face.<br />
<br />
&quot;They are new!&quot; Wyatt said with a deeper voice than before. We watched how the shoes were getting tighter and tighter around his size 6 feet.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, you should&#39;ve taken them off beforehand! Didn&#39;t you learn anything from us?&quot; Rick said a second before we heard a loud tear and saw that his toes were so large and wide now that they came out from his shoes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Welcome to the big feet club!&quot; Darius joked as we watched Wyatt&#39;s feet ripping through the rest of his shoes which exposed now very large and wide size 14 feet.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoa!! They’re so big!&quot; Justin said surprised as he watched Wyatt&#39;s manly feet.<br />
<br />
&quot;But they are not as big as yours!&quot; Kim told Justin who immediately blushed and clenched his long toes. Darius and Shane started to laugh and the rest of grown-ups followed them up. However, when Wyatt&#39;s body begin to stretch and grow taller we returned our attention to him.<br />
<br />
His arms and legs grew longer with hair still sprouting across them. His shorts now barely went down down to the bottom of his thighs and his chubby stomach was exposed due to his now very small and tight shirt. Wyatt was now almost 6’ tall! <br />
<br />
&quot;Mmh... You&#39;re not very tall.&quot; Mr. Turin said. &quot;That&#39;s good! We want a big mix of male bodies to measure.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Measure?&quot; Frank asked really worried. &quot;What kind of measures?&quot; He said nervously as he looked at his boss grinning without any intention to answer.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dad always says that boys grow fast…ugh!…but I didn’t think…he meant this!&quot; Wyatt said as his voice began to drop octaves almost instantly. He now sounded as if he was a young man in his college years. &quot;Aaah!&quot; Just then, Wyatt’s whole body began to have an energy surge throughout it.<br />
<br />
He felt his body started to widen and bulk faster than before. He could feel his legs as they began to bulge with muscle. Everybody was expecting he flexed his small arms as they exploded with thick biceps and large muscle all over but he somehow stood still. His back broadened which began to tear his small shirt from behind followed by his chest starting to develop thick pecs. His chubby stomach began to form a thick set of abs.<br />
<br />
Wyatt didn’t look so much like a college guy now, instead he looked like a beefy man in his mid-30’s. We watched how his face began to restructure itself and small hairs started to sprout in his chin but oddly, he still kept his boyish innocence, maybe it&#39;s because he was kinda chubby yet.<br />
<br />
Wyatt was terrified now, he hadn&#39;t seen himself but he felt like crying. He really didn’t want to be as old his father. He was so eager that he can&#39;t keep his eyes closed and he opened them. He looked down at his now large body and yelled in panic.<br />
<br />
&quot;What happened to me?! He seemed so terrified that he started to touch his overgrown body all over. Just when he thought it was all over he felt a sudden pain inside his PewDiePie undies.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uuuugh!!!! Ow!!&quot; Wyatt clenched his small package inside of his very tight shorts and undies. We heard a loud tear from behind his shorts. His butt had started to get larger and it tear his shorts from behind, exposing a plump and tight fat ass.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oooow!!&quot; Wyatt continued to clench his package from the pain. He then felt his balls inflate within his hands. Before he could let go he felt his dick throbbing and lengthening which stretched obscenely his undies as if they were a very small poser.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uuuh!! Uhh!!&quot; Wyatt began to moan uncontrollably as the pain turned into pleasure. &quot;No more!! Please! Uuuuuh!&quot; Wyatt tried to fight the strong urge to touch his throbbing dick, he still wanted to keep some decency. &quot;It feels so heavy!!!&quot; He gave in quickly as his dick grew harder and longer in his hands. He began stroking his thick cock, his balls now hanging low filled with so much semen were ready to explode.<br />
<br />
&quot;UH! UH! UH!!!&quot; Wyatt felt a climax starting to happen. &quot;AHHHH!!!&quot; He let out a deep moan and blew his load all over his small underwear, it was so much that it started to drip through the fabric. Wyatt was out of breathe and red all over.<br />
<br />
When he could finally somewhat grasp what just happened he quickly hid his now large package with his hands. &quot;Please! Don&#39;t look at me!!&quot; He pathetically said and tried to run away embarrassed but he tripped with his big clown feet and fell on the ground. Everyone bursted out laughing and he started to cry while he pathetically tried to hide his now very large and messy cock.<br />
<br />
&quot;Give him a hand, Frank.&quot; Mr. Turin said without any remorse of what he did to the poor guy.</p>
