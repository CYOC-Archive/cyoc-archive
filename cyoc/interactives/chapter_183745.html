<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Serena walked off the bus and waited for her daughter to follow her. “Katrina, come on! You can’t spend a day like today stuck in your phone all day.” Katrina slowly stepped off the bus while looking intently through her social media pages. It’s surprising how fluidly she was moving despite not being able to see in front of or around her. Serena just sighed as she headed for the malls entrance.<br />
<br />
Serena is a 40 year old milf that’s slowly losing her youth. She has shoulder length, straight, black and white hair held in a headband so her bangs wouldn’t be in her eyes. She has emerald eyes, a pink nose, and a round face due to her slight pudge. Her tits are DDs but they sag slightly, and her stomach has a noticeable bulge with love handles around her waist. She has a pretty good looking ass and some nice thighs to match. She’s wearing a pink 3/4 length shirt and light gray sweatpants. All she wants is to spend time with her daughter, Katrina.<br />
<br />
Katrina just turned 20 yesterday. She’s a very smart and shy girl with rebellious tendencies. Her hair is black and white like her mother’s, but curly and reaches down to her tail. Her hair has a long bang that covers one of her eyes. Because of her screen addiction, she has to wear corrective lenses over her emerald eyes, but all it does is compliment her baby face and adorable pink nose. She has D size tits that are perky and she is toned and muscular, even her mother has no clue how she stays toned. Her ass is massive (and smelly thanks to her dad’s genes) to the point where she looks slight bottom heavy. She’s wearing a loose fitting green top with black denim skinny jeans that accentuate her curves. <br />
<br />
Katrina moved with grace through the crowd of people and started looking through the crowd. She was searching for a famous singer called Max Master whom she’d been keeping up with for years. They had a history being the same age and going to the same school before he hit it big in his senior year. She was the one who encouraged him to be himself, and to do what he loves. His debut was today at this mall, and she was gonna be there for him.<br />
<br />
Serena went into a clothing store first to see if she could find a discount on any items. The people inside the store quickly fanned out and left on quite the hurry. The employees went to cover their noses as she walked up to the register. Serena didn’t care, she didn’t even apologize. She walked right up to the register and asked them, “What can you give me to leave your store?” It was bold, it was daring, but it worked. That’s how the town treated skunks, and considering the bus they rode in on, they were especially fragrant today. They would either comply and give her a few items of clothing, get mad and call the cops, or attempt to throw her out of the store, the later two causing her to skunk then so they never forget her face. The police of the town knew better than to mess with her or her daughter, not only was Katrina the worse smelling of the two, but she was also the stronger of the two, even quickly disabling experienced military personnel. Katrina didn’t mind though, she loved her mother. Their relationship is what keeps them alive. Even though Katrina wishes to meet her Dad, it’s not the end of the world if she doesn’t.<br />
<br />
After getting free items from about 5 stores, Serena would take a moment to stop by the bathroom (her stomach would give her cues that she might need some privacy soon) to relieve herself. She would start by peeing in the toilet, her urine being strong and musky, then her butt would chime in with loud trumpet blast that echoed through the entire restroom. Her skunky tendencies would usually clear out the restroom and that’s just what she wanted. Once her stream of piss ended, she would rub her eager pussy as she released more skunky farts. Her smell would turn her on, and if she was smart sometimes she would bring a dildo into the restroom with her. She would cum, skunk the bowl, wipe herself clean, and wash her hands like a civilized anthro. After all that, she would then spend the rest of her time in the food court, which is probably contributing to her roundness. After getting a pretty normal looking tray of mall food, she would scarf it down as fast as she could. Her digestive system could handle most foods, even some rotten foods, but she would pay for it later by the smell and quantity of her farts. After getting stuffed with food, she would wait at the entrance for her daughter and they would return home, just a typical mall day.<br />
<br />
Katrina on the other hand walked with purpose through the mall looking for her famous bestie, stopping at a few gaming and tech stores along the way to see what was new and good. Just like her mother, every store she entered the people filed out and the employees would give her stuff if she left, she never got the cops called on her, but she did almost get escorted out. The guy took one look at her, she gave him a look, he stopped and she walked away. Unlike her mother, she never asked for anything, she was just genuinely looking at new stuff in the stores she went into. After a good 10 minutes of walking around, she found a stage and checked her pages for any updates and saw the exact same stage on a post that was updated a few seconds ago. Walking around the stage, Katrina saw…</p>
