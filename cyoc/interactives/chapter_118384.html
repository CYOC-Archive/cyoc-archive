<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Brad just stood there speechless at seeing his toddler wife poop her pants completely out of nowhere like that. He didn’t know what was more shocking, the fact that she did number two in her diaper or the fact that after she made poo poo she continued to chastise him like it was completely normal. Which it was since he had the “change reality” setting on when he regressed her but kept it from affecting her mentally as he wanted her to experience her baby-like state with a grown up mind. However it appeared that Jan was apparently okay being an adult in the body of a toddler, embracing everything including the diapers judging from the way she shamelessly used them in front of him.<br />
<br />
His train of thought was broken by the sound of the baby girl’s voice.<br />
<br />
“Well are you going to just stand there? I need my diaper changed” she whined looking up at him impatiently with both hands on her hips.<br />
<br />
“Yes dear, don’t worry I’m going to change you right now” Brad promised.<br />
<br />
“That’s more like it.”<br />
<br />
He decided to play along with her bossy attitude for the moment but her insults were already starting to wear on him. Reaching down he picked Jan up by her armpits the heavy seat of her poop laden pamper dangling in between her legs. Brad then carried her over to the changing table and laid the baby girl down on her back, the toddler instantly lifting her legs up in the air. Checking the underside of the table he found the baby powder and wipes but for some reason couldn’t find the most important item, which was the diapers.<br />
<br />
“Honey, I can’t seem to find the diapers…”<br />
<br />
“That’s because you were supposed to restock the table after my last changing” Jan explained quickly losing her patience with her husband, “Ugh I knew you’d forget, there’s more in the closet so hurry up and get them.”<br />
<br />
Grumbling to himself Brad silently stomped over to the closet, pulling back the sliding door to look inside. The clothes rack still held his adult clothes but Jan’s had vanished, most likely now all stored in the dresser and now being baby clothes. Moving his gaze downward he saw two large boxes of pampers cruisers disposable diapers each containing 144 diapers. There had to be like 3 months worth of diapers here he thought leading him to wonder how many she went through a day. Or it’s possible he just wanted to make sure they had enough on hand. Remembering his irritable toddler wife still waiting on him he opened one of the boxes and pulled out a decent sized stack of the padded garments. Carrying them back to the changing table he put away all the pampers except for one which he left on top of the table.<br />
<br />
He was about to start changing her when Brad couldn’t help but notice how beautiful and cute Jan looked as a two year old baby girl. The only fat she had now was baby fat that gave her arms, legs and stomach a slightly pudgy look. And the way her light pink nightgown covered her chest while her diaper was on full display for the world to see, the padding wrapped snugly around her body. It was hard not to see her as anything more than a regular baby girl.<br />
<br />
But that illusion was quickly broken by a bitchy high pitched voice.<br />
<br />
“Are you waiting for an invitation or what? Quit stalling and change me already before I get a rash” Jan shouted while kicking her legs in frustration.<br />
<br />
Biting back a sharp remark Brad reached down and began ripping open the adhesive tapes on both sides of the garment. Opening up her diaper he was greeted with the stench of its contents and looking inside revealed a pile of brown solids, “Wow honey you sure made a big poopy in your pants” he playfully teased his baby wife who just glared at him, “No thanks to you, and don’t even think sweet talk is going to fix this I’m still very mad at you.” At that moment a thick yellow stream of liquid rose up from between her legs arching up through the air and onto the floor. Realizing she was peeing Jan quickly turned her body to the right causing the pee stream to splash all over the front of Brad’s shirt. “What the hell Jan?” he yelled as he quickly pushed the toddler back onto her back and pulled the front of her pamper back up and over her crotch. He then held it there as she continued to empty her bladder, feeling the padding become puffy and warm beneath his fingers. Only when he was absolutely sure that she was finished did he pull it back down again.<br />
<br />
“What the hell was that for?” Brad asked her angrily as his shirt now had a huge wet spot on it. “That was for taking so long to come to bed you inconsiderate jerk” Jan grinned then went back to business, “Now get to work and clean my poopie” she yelled wriggling her dirty rear end for emphasis.<br />
<br />
Silently fuming inside Brad controlled his anger knowing he can get back at her afterward and resumed changing her. He removed and wrapped up the dirty diaper disposing of it in the nearby pail and reached for the baby wipes. Taking a handful of them he started to clean her bottom while also marveling at how baby soft and smooth it now felt. Not wanting make her mad Brad made sure he did a good job even wiping between her legs and her crotch. As he worked Brad was reminded of when he changed Robin and Sally when they were babies, the memory also reminding him of the strangeness of this whole situation as he was in the middle of changing their 38 year old mother’s poopy diaper. Once he was done wiping he dusted her rear end with healthy amount of baby powder. Grabbing the new pamper he unfolded it and lifting her legs up slid it under her. From there it was simple matter of pulling the front up between legs and taping up the sides.<br />
<br />
As soon as she was dressed in the fresh padding Jan visibly relaxed, the angry look disappearing from her face as a look of tiredness took its place. Seeing that she was getting sleepy Brad took this opportunity to walk over to the dresser to change out of his clothes and put on his pajamas. Once he was ready for bed he picked up the newly changed toddler and carried her to her side of the bed, slipping her underneath the covers.<br />
<br />
“I want my pacifier” Jan asked in a somewhat sleepy voice.<br />
<br />
Brad quickly scanned the room for the object and spied it sitting there on the nightstand. Scooping it up with his hand he quickly popped it in the baby girl’s mouth before she could say anything negative to him. Feeling the rubber nipple in her mouth Jan started sucking on the pacifier as her rage from earlier slowly began to subside, being replaced with contentment. Within moments she had fallen fast asleep much to Brad’s relief as he climbed into bed. Seeing the Chronivac sitting on his nightstand a few thoughts crossed his mind but he was too tired to care, instead deciding to go to sleep and deal with it in the morning.<br />
<br />
It seemed like he had closed his eyes for a few minutes when the sound of baby-like crying woke him up with a start. Looking for the source he saw it was coming from Jan who was also awake, the baby girl had kicked off the covers and was now crying loudly as she kicked her legs wildly and pounded the bed with her arms. Her pacifier lay discarded next to her pillow having fallen out of her mouth at some point.<br />
<br />
“Jan, what the heck?…What&#39;s going on, why are you crying?” Brad asked covering his ears at the loud noise his wife was making, she was practically crying like a newborn for god’s sake. Though what he didn’t know was that Jan had woken up grumpy from not getting enough sleep and upon discovering what she had made in her pants during the night lost all control and started crying. And she was going to keep crying until the problem in her diaper was taken care of.<br />
<br />
“I made a big stinky in my sleep” she whined out placing both hands on the front of her pamper gripping it tightly before crying out, “I need to be changed!”<br />
<br />
Stunned by this revelation since she pooped last night Brad rolled the crying and fussing toddler onto her side so he could check her diaper to see if she was telling the truth. Pulling back the waistband he looked inside and saw a huge brown turd squished against the seat and wedged in between her butt cheeks.<br />
<br />
“Change me now! I want my diaper changed!” Jan wailed her cries becoming louder as she continued to throw the mother of all tantrums.<br />
<br />
Letting the waistband snap back into place Brad then…</p>
