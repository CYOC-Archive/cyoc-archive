<br />
author&#39;s note: this story takes place after Caleb Moreland has left the vampire realm.<br />
<br />
After Caleb’s break in into Tepes manor and after his fight with the four members of the five, as well as Andrew, Lady Roseblood came to see how the young prince was recovering.<br />
<br />
“Prince Andrew, how...how do you fare? Are you recovering well?” Lady Roseblood asked trying to not express too much concern for Andrew’s injuries. She had been very shocked to hear about Andrew’s resilience against the formidable demon hunter Caleb Moreland and that he had made it out with very little injury.<br />
<br />
“I’m fine, my lady, I’ll recover quickly in due time. I am a Tepes, and the Tepes men are quite vigorous.” Andrew said lifting his shot shoulder as he winced a little after raising it.<br />
<br />
“They are, aren’t they…” the vampire said as if lost in thought.<br />
<br />
“Oh, do please hold still Master Andrew, I’m still finishing up with your shoulder.” Miss Cheyenne instructed as Andrew gave a silent apology.<br />
<br />
“Thank you, for coming to see me your ladyship. I didn’t think you would come to check on me.” Andrew thanked as Miss Cheyenne finished with Andrew’s shoulder bandage.<br />
<br />
“There you are Master Andrew, it will take a few days to fully heal, but you’ll be back in shape in no time. Your ladyship.” Miss Cheyenne said a she left Andrew and Lady Roseblood alone to speak.<br />
<br />
“I would have ripped that Moreland apart if it were me.” Lady Roseblood said.<br />
<br />
“You and Little Ann would get along I think.” Andrew said lightening the mood.<br />
<br />
“Well that was quite a splendid display of savagery the other day.” Lady Roseblood commented.<br />
<br />
“It was a shame your father stopped little Ann.” Lady Roseblood mused she helped Andrew up and Prince Andrew and walked back to her room.<br />
<br />
“Yes, I-uh…I suppose so my lady. I was worried my sisters would have intervened.” Andrew said.<br />
<br />
“Would you have?” She then asked.<br />
<br />
Andrew stopped, “Intervened? It was far from my place to.”<br />
<br />
“No, would you have stopped Ann…if you had a daughter and said daughter’s love was being killed in that arena?” She asked.<br />
<br />
“Oh…I-I suppose. If my daughter truly loved this man, I would. I’d want her to be happy.” Andrew answered.<br />
<br />
“Hmm…Love. Do you think that to be more important than family?” She added.<br />
<br />
“I’m sorry my lady, I don’t take your meaning. Aren’t love and family one and the same?” Andrew retorted.<br />
<br />
“Not always Prince Andrew. Say your child loves a man who killed your family. Would their love be right? Would it be more important than family?” The vampire asked.<br />
<br />
“I suppose I’m not sure…The Morelands and my family have never gotten along but…” Andrew trailed off as he sensed this wasn’t what she was talking about.<br />
<br />
He noticed her gaze became distant. He was unsure if it was something he said.<br />
<br />
“You know, we’re still not any closer to finding out who wanted to kill you after the ball. W-why don’t we return to your castle—I mean, I don’t have to come b-but I—I mean I just want to ensure your safety. P-Perhaps—“ he was silenced when she placed a cold pale finger over his lips.<br />
<br />
“You are very considerate, your highness. You would accompany me all the way to Russia to protect me…are you always so courteous to every guest?” She said coyly.<br />
<br />
Andrew’s cheeks went red and he hoped she didn’t notice.<br />
<br />
“Lady Roseblood. You are a very important woman, you are one of the three great old bloods. As the Prince of the Vampires, it is my duty and honor to aid you in this search for answers.”<br />
<br />
Lady Roseblood turned to face the window, looking out at the night sky and red moon. He could have sworn he heard her laugh to herself.<br />
<br />
“We could take a portal…but I think we can travel there through the mortal realm. I haven’t traveled in the world for centuries…and with you as my escort, it could be…fun. I’d be happy in return to help you recover from your injuries.” She said.<br />
<br />
“Then I shall be glad to accompany you my lady.” Andrew said with a slight bow as he gently took her hand and kissed it.<br />
<br />
“Good night Prince Andrew. I hope you sleep well for the morrow.” Lady Roseblood said as she headed toward her quarters.<br />
<br />
Later that night Prince Andrew was looking out at the lake that was enclosed by the castle walls. He was excited about traveling to Russia with the love of his life. Then a presence made itself known.<br />
<br />
“Aunt Hanako. Do you spy on all of my siblings?” Andrew said.<br />
<br />
“No. But I am very observant, and the walls have ears. So, you and Roseblood are taking the scenic route back to Siberia. Is that really so wise considering your injuries?” The former vampire hunter asked looking at his shoulder.<br />
<br />
“Yes, don’t worry, I’ll be fine. What of my travel with lady Roseblood? You don’t approve of her?” He asked.<br />
<br />
“No. I have fought her in the past…” Hanako said and lifted her frilled blouse, showing her great-great nephew a large snake like scar across her abdomen. “She’s as dangerous as she is beautiful…I would be careful if I were you. And suspicious.”<br />
<br />
“Everybody’s already warned me about her. You don’t know her like I’ve come to. Sure she’s not exactly a normal vampire noblewoman but that’s what I love about her. And I’ve seen a softer side to her, even if only for a moment. I...I saw it tonight when she came to see me. The tone in her voice almost sounded like deep concern.” Andrew explained.<br />
<br />
“Well, hopefully Brendan and Duncan find partners that don’t give me any more trouble.” She sighed buttoning up her blouse.<br />
<br />
“Too late Aunt Hanako. I’ve been talking with Isabella, she’s got it bad for Duncan.” Andrew said.<br />
<br />
“Lord Marcelo’s only daughter? Could be worse. But those two together have already caused enough chaos around here. I suppose that may explain Duncan trying to dump water on me. What are the odds Brendan doesn’t choose a normal vampire nobleman?” She said.<br />
<br />
“You know what they say: opposites attract. If that’s the case he’ll end up with someone as loud as he is quiet.” Andrew smirked.<br />
<br />
“I hope not.” Hanako sighed, “Goodnight, your highness. And make sure you don’t do anything stupid on your way to Siberia.”<br />
<br />
Then she disappeared as suddenly as she appeared.<br />
<br />
“No promises.” Andrew smiled to himself. “I wonder if her heart beats for me, like mine does when I think of her.” Andrew said to himself as he wondered aloud about Roseblood, placing his hand on his heart. He knew this trip would help him discover that answer, he just had to get some rest in before he and Lady Roseblood would leave tomorrow.</p>
