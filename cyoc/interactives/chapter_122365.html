<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Lisa waited patiently while Eric poked around in his new software setting up the changes.  She wanted the changes to be a surprise, but she was also getting bored.<br />
<br />
She stood up from the bed and walked over to the door, &quot;I&#39;m going to get a snack from the kitchen.  Want me to bring you anything?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No thanks. Almost done.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, you said that 5 minutes ago too.  Not trying to rush you, just hungry.  Be right back.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lisa headed down the stairs and into the kitchen.  She had spent a good amount of time at Erik&#39;s house, but almost none of it was in the kitchen - usually Eric or Eric&#39;s mom would get her a drink or snack when she asked.<br />
<br />
Opening a few cabinets and looking in revealed where a variety of dishes, cups, and pans were stored.  Lisa turned her attention to a door off to the side.  She swung the door open, revealing a spacious walk-in pantry.  The pantry was surprisingly large - at least 15 feet deep, by 7 feet wide.  A roughly 4 foot wide aisle was lined with shelving with many boxes of food on it, and on the back wall of the room was another set of shelving.<br />
<br />
She walked inside and started her search in the back.  There were shelves in front of her, and on both walls to her sides.  At a glance then shelves in the back held mainly cooking supplies, and a few extra pots and pans.  As she searched, she couldn&#39;t help but marvel at just how much stuff was crammed into the pantry.<br />
<br />
Before she could finish searching the back wall, the pantry door finished its slow swing shut behind her.  Lisa instinctively grabbed up in the air for a cable to pull to turn on a light, but failed to find it.  At that moment, a shock tore through her entire body, as if she had just stuck her finger in an electrical outlet.<br />
<br />
All of Lisa&#39;s senses were replaced with bright white static.  She was unable to see, hear, or even feel the clothes she was wearing.  After what felt like both a few seconds and an eternity, all her senses instantly returned.  The pantry was still dark, but she could feel and hear again, and a small amount of ambient light gave her the impression she was looking at a wall covered in shelves.  Lisa could both feel and hear herself breathing heavily.<br />
<br />
In, out, in, out, in, in, out, out, in, out, in, out, in, out, in, out, in, in, out, out, in, out, in, out, in, in, out, out, in, out, in, out, in, in, in, out, out, out.<br />
<br />
Something instinctively felt wrong to Lisa.  Trying to resist the urge to panic, she took a step backward.<br />
<br />
THUMP!<br />
<br />
Lisa felt her ass collide with the door.  Lisa was feeling incredibly on edge, and the sudden loud sound and impact on her posterior drove her into a mild panic.  Lisa turned around to the door.<br />
<br />
Or she tried to.  As she tried to turn, she felt her ass collide with something warm and slightly soft.  At the same moment, something warm and soft rammed into her side, sending her flying into the shelves lining the side of the pantry.  Cans, boxes, and a multitude of tupperware containers fell onto Lisa as she fell down.<br />
<br />
Instinctively flailing out with her arms, Lisa grabbed hold of the shelves to halt her fall.  At the same time, she both felt herself slap something warm, and felt herself get slapped simultaneously in the face and boob.  Another sensation of falling hit Lisa.<br />
<br />
A second later, something heavy fell onto Lisa.  Thankfully, something warm and soft broke Lisa&#39;s fall.<br />
<br />
&quot;HELP!&quot; she screamed.  The exclamation echoed weirdly, only making her panic more.  Lisa felt more and more like she was going completely crazy, and her senses couldn&#39;t be trusted.  She thought she must have accidentally jammed her finger into an empty lightbulb socket and scrambled her brain.<br />
<br />
&quot;Lisa?  Where are you?&quot;  Eric&#39;s response and rapid running down the stairs came through the wall.  It also echoed weirdly.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m in the pantry&quot; &quot;Pantry!&quot; &quot;Help me!&quot; To her surprise, when Lisa responded, it came out not like a normal sentence, but as 3 simultaneous and overlapped sentences.  Even more strangely, it echoed oddly.<br />
<br />
Tears leaked from Lisa&#39;s eyes, and she stifled sobs.  &quot;I&#39;m scared.&quot;<br />
<br />
The pantry door clicked and swung open.  The light poured in, letting Lisa see once again.  She blinked many times, unable to believe what she saw.<br />
<br />
She could see the pantry from the angle she was expecting - having tipped into the shelves and fallen down.  There were boxes and tupperware containers in front of her, and beyond them, but within arm&#39;s reach, was the back wall and its shelves.<br />
<br />
Lisa also saw 2 girls lying next to the shelves, 1 having fallen on the other.  But they didn&#39;t seem right.  They had too many arms.<br />
<br />
Before Lisa could even attempt to comprehend what she was seeing, she felt a hand on her ass.  &quot;Whoa that&#39;s a mess.  Let&#39;s get you out of there.  Walk straight backwards, don&#39;t turn around&quot; Eric said to her.<br />
<br />
She carefully stepped straight backwards.  Lisa could feel herself moving backwards, and her viewpoint shifted so that she could see the 2 girls on the ground from further back, revealing they had long segments with even more limbs coming out of them where their butts would be.<br />
<br />
As she walked, the girls on the ground shifted their many legs, like they were trying to walk.<br />
<br />
&quot;You used the Chronivac, didn&#39;t you?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah!  I thought it would be a surprise if you didn&#39;t know it was coming.&quot;  Lisa felt Eric&#39;s hand shift and guide her ass to the left as she walked backwards.  Without thinking about it, she felt her direction of movement rotate to keep touching his hand.  &quot;I didn&#39;t think anything like this would happen when I hit the button though.  Sorry.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Can you at least tell me what you changed?&quot;  Lisa continued to move backwards.  The other girls on the ground seemed to get longer and longer with each step she took.  &quot;I can&#39;t make sense of what&#39;s going on.  I thought I was going crazy.&quot;  There was that echo again.<br />
<br />
Lisa fully exited the pantry, now able to see the butts of the girls on the ground.  The two girls were tangled up, making it impossible for Lisa to really determine what limbs belonged to each girl.  She turned her head to look at Eric, surprised by the sudden vertigo as her viewpoint turned... And also stayed stationary still looking at the back of the pantry as though she was laying on the pantry floor.<br />
<br />
Eric had a massive grin on his face.  Glancing down, Lisa saw his pants were a bit tight too - clearly whatever was done to her was turning him on.  That made Lisa feel a little better - she couldn&#39;t possibly be too much of a freak.  Still, she had no mental picture of her new form, and the sensations she kept receiving from her senses continued to contradict themselves.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m kind of freaking out here, Eric.  Nothing feels right.  I can&#39;t make sense of anything.  Just please tell me.&quot;  Lisa reached out towards Eric, intending to grab him by the arm.  As her arms came into her peripheral vision, again her senses lied to her.  She could only freeze and stare down.<br />
<br />
There, raised forward from her body were 4 right arms.  She could see through her cleavage that there was at least 1 more pair of breasts below hers.  A quick motion and 4 left arms pointed out forward in front of Lisa&#39;s body.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Eric stood back and watched Lisa try to make sense of her changed form with a huge grin plastered all over his face.  Lisa had wanted to &quot;dive into the deep end&quot; and go completely overboard with her first transformation.  Eric had done his best to make that dive as deep as possible while still staying sexy.<br />
<br />
He had been a bit disappointed that it had taken him so long.  When he had started on his idea, he had no idea just how complex the software was, or even what it was capable of.  It was only through sheer luck that he had stumbled on the correct menu to make his vision a reality.<br />
<br />
But now that he was looking at his changed girlfriend, he felt it was definitely a success.  His raging erection only served to bias his opinion even more.  Lisa&#39;s change had torn off her clothing, leaving her completely naked.  At least that was probably why she was naked.<br />
<br />
The first thing he had done to Lisa was multiply her arms and breasts by 4.  Her torso had 4 rows of beautiful C cup breasts covering the front.  Her belly button barely peeked out from between the cleavage of her bottom pair of breasts.  Lisa was holding all 4 pairs of arms out in front of her, her eyes glancing between them and her own cleavage.<br />
<br />
But that was too simple.  So the next change was to make Lisa a humantaur by cloning her entire body below the neck, including all 8 arms, breasts, both legs and vagina in her crotch.  Another set of 8 arms were animatedly moving on Lisa&#39;s horizontal torso, behind where it connected at her waist.<br />
<br />
That still wasn&#39;t enough to really qualify as &quot;deep end&quot;.  So Eric had repeated it 2 more times.  2 more full torsos and pairs of legs stretched out behind Lisa&#39;s first humantaur torso.  Lisa&#39;s perfect ass was almost 10&#39; straight back compared to where it had originally been, and there were over 20 extra arms and breasts in those 10&#39; of humantaur-esque flesh.<br />
<br />
Even this form hadn&#39;t fully met the criteria Lisa had set, and Eric had known it.  She had wanted an impossibly pleasurable sexual experience.  Eric had seen a number of gender changing or adding options in the Chronivac, and had decided to change Lisa&#39;s genitals.  Wanting to keep his girlfriend still a girl, but also giving her the impossibly amazing sexual experience she wanted, he had doubled her genitalia in all her crotches, and set it so the left genital is always a penis, and the right is always a vagina.<br />
<br />
Eric stared down at Lisa&#39;s front crotch, where she had 1 vagina and 1 penis sharing the space.  The penis was flaccid, but slowly becoming hard.  Her vagina looked moist.  Mesmerized, Eric briefly touched his pants.  His slightly off-centered dick twitched with desire.<br />
<br />
Reigning his arousal in, Eric looked back up at Lisa&#39;s beautiful face.  He hadn&#39;t changed her face in the slightest - it was already perfect.  Another idea hit Eric and he stashed it in the back of his memory: She was beautiful with 1 head.  With 2, she would be even more beautiful.<br />
<br />
But, in a way, he had already done that.  The coup de grace of the changes Eric had setup for Lisa was hidden in several very complex sub-menus.  He had found a setting called &quot;Cerebral Quantum Hub Linking&quot;.  The tooltip for the option had explained that it moved a portion of the subject&#39;s central nervous system out of the physical world and into &quot;quantum pocket space with n-definable pocket connections&quot;.<br />
<br />
Looking at setting&#39;s options, he had found it was apparently a way to take a person and make them have multiple identical bodies all under their control.  Except technically it was one body that was connected in a way Eric could never hope to understand through quantum linking at the brain stem.  There were a number of options, but the main one Eric had any interest in was &quot;body count&quot;: He had set it to 3.<br />
<br />
It must have worked, because Lisa was standing in front of him in the kitchen trying to grasp just how many arms and breasts she had, and he had seen 2 more Lisas lying on top of each other in the pantry.  When she spoke, she seemed to do it with all 3 heads simultaneously.  Eric hadn&#39;t expected that, but found it incredibly sexy.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Lisa could barely believe her eyes: There were 8 hands in front of her, and they moved however she wanted them to!  At least... this pair of eyes.  She seemed to have 3 pairs of eyes, and the other 2 pairs were looking at the back wall of the pantry.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s get your other 2 bodies out of the pantry.  Can you please move out of the way Lisa?&quot;<br />
<br />
Eric&#39;s words snapped Lisa out of her trance  They rattled around her brains, causing pieces to start to fall into place.  She walked over to the wall where Eric was pointing, then turned her head to watch the pantry door.  Still somewhat unsure of what had happened to her, she didn&#39;t want to repeat the calamity that had befallen her in the pantry.<br />
<br />
Eric propped open the pantry door with a door stop then stepped inside.  Suddenly Lisa felt his hand on her ass again.  But it was a different ass.  Something about the touch focused Lisa to that specific body.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, can you stand up?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I... don&#39;t know.  Can you help?&quot;<br />
<br />
Lisa felt Eric grab one of her arms and pull upward.  It was an arm she wasn&#39;t aware she had - it didn&#39;t seem to be attached to her front torso.  Unknown to Lisa, Eric was trying to help her up by pulling her up using one of her arms on her middle lower torso.<br />
<br />
A few grunts and some carefully found footing later, Lisa managed to get back on her feet.  Eric guided her backwards out of the pantry.  From outside the pantry, Lisa watched her other self back out of the pantry.  Finally able to see what she had become, she was awestruck and dumbfounded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is...  Is that ME?!?&quot; she exclaimed as her front torso finally made it out of the pantry door.  She hadn&#39;t expected anywhere near as many limbs, genitals or... separate bodies.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah!  Sexy and off the deep end, right?  And there&#39;s another you still in the pantry.  Let me go get uh... you!&quot;  Eric walked back into the pantry.<br />
<br />
Lisa looked 2 of her selves over as Eric helped her 3rd self stand up in the pantry.  A few confident backwards steps, and Lisa&#39;s 3rd identical body backed out of the pantry.  Lisa could see with her triple vision that not only was the tent in Eric&#39;s pants still present, but her penises were also starting to get hard.<br />
<br />
Eric closed the door, and turned to his triplicate girlfriend.  &quot;So, what do you think?&quot;</p>
