<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ken stood patiently across the street from the Harris home awaiting the signal alongside Ann with his sword in his hilt. He could hear taking deep sighs while sitting crouched down on the ground.<br />
<br />
&quot;It wasn&#39;t just that you wanted to be my Lord Miro&#39;s side tonight wasn&#39;t it?&quot; Ken asked as by this time, he had known Ann almost as well as Miro himself. Ann herself stomped her foot twice in response.<br />
<br />
&quot;You wanted to be there when he captured Duke, I know you&#39;ve always had a small bit of hatred for him being the son of the master. I&#39;m sure you would&#39;ve like to knock him out yourself.&quot; Ken guessed as Ann stomped her foot once in response.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well don&#39;t worry, you&#39;ll have plenty of time to humiliate him when Wyatt, Kyra, Cassidy bring him in. Wyatt has proved himself to be quite the formidable vampire heir. Just asking out of curiosity, but if Wyatt were to succeed as the heir should....anything happen to the master, and I&#39;m not saying I want that, but would you follow him?&quot; Ken asked as we waited for a response from Ann before finally hearing Ann stomp her foot once.<br />
<br />
&quot;I still have my misgivings, but we&#39;ll see how this all plays out.&quot; Ken said as a signal from his watch went off.<br />
<br />
&quot;Right, you get the front door, I&#39;ll come in through the back.&quot;  Ken said as he snuck off while little Ann smeared dirt on her face and hair and forced herself to begin crying as she walked up to the front door of the Harris home.<br />
<br />
*******************<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, we&#39;ll we haven&#39;t heard or seen anything tonight. We&#39;ll let you know though.&quot; Cole Harris said hanging up the phone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Who was that?&quot; Kumiko asked as she rocked Yuriko on her shoulder.<br />
<br />
&quot;That was one of Claudia&#39;s babysitter&#39;s....Rei, I think is her name. She said they just had an encounter with some vampires.&quot; Cole explained.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my god, are they alright?&quot; Kumiko asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;They&#39;re fine, her friend&#39;s mother managed to protect them. Let&#39;s just be careful tonight about who we see.&quot; Cole warned his wife as the front door bell rang.<br />
<br />
Kumiko went to answer the door and was shocked to see a young, dirty, redhaired girl on the other side of the door there.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my god, are you okay little one?&quot; Kumiko said crouching down to look closer at the girl.<br />
<br />
&quot;Who is it?&quot; Cole asked from the other side of the room.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s a little girl, I think she&#39;s homeless. She may need some help.&quot; Kumiko said as Cole came around to look at the front doorway.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come in little one, is there anyone who&#39;s looking for you? A parent or guardian?&quot; Kumiko asked motherly as she invited the little girl inside.<br />
<br />
The little girl then looked up with a smile and pushed Kumiko down onto the floor as she rushed towards Cole while punching him in the cheek making him fall back. Cole ran over to check on his wife first while the little girl ran to the back door and opened it.<br />
<br />
Cole and Kumiko looked up as a man with a sword walked through the back door and over to the crib where Tommy was.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good evening Mr. and Mrs. Harris, if you would be so kind as to hand over your children, I promise you, you&#39;ll both be unharmed...mostly.&quot; The swordsman said as the little girl grinned.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m willing to bet you two bastards are vampires.&quot; Cole said through his teeth.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nice to know you know of us, but maybe you don&#39;t know of our work. You no doubt heard about that vampire hunter, Jacob Moreland? Well you&#39;re looking at the ones who made him &#39;armless&#39;, excuse the pun.&quot; The swordsman smirked as he felt around and felt the crib next to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t touch our son!&quot; Kumiko shouted as Ken still reached down and picked him up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, don&#39;t worry. I won&#39;t hold him. I&#39;m carrying a sharp object after all. But my friend here will.&quot; The swordsman said handing little tommy to the child.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let go of my son!&quot; Cole said as he ran up towards the two and the swordsman drew his sword and pointed it at Cole&#39;s face.<br />
<br />
&quot;I may be blind, but I could see that coming.&quot; Ken said as he smirked. Cole smacked the sword away and hit Ken in the face as little Ann stepped aside.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well that was stupid of you.&quot; Ken said as he pulled up his sword and attempted to cut Cole&#39;s chest, but Cole held up his arm making the sword cut his arm a little making him bleed.<br />
<br />
As the two fought, little Ann walked over to Kumiko who was trying to crawl away towards the front door while holding Yuriko. Little Ann was at the front door just as Kumiko managed to reach up and open it. Little Ann was surprised to see a teenage girl standing on the other side with a woman who looked similar in appearance to her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi Mrs. Harris, long short story, I babysit for your sister in-laws and this is my mom. We&#39;re both good vampires and....&quot; Nat began to explain.<br />
<br />
&quot;Stop explaining and start helping!&quot; Kumiko shouted as Nat&#39;s mother lunged towards little Ann who jumped back to avoid her in time.<br />
<br />
Nat meanwhile went over to engage with Cole against Ken who was managing to hold his own.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi Mr. Harris, I&#39;m your sister&#39;s baby sitter, I&#39;m also a good vampire.&quot; Nat said as Ken rolled his blind eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;My luck, another god damn damphir.&quot; Ken moaned as he fought Nat who was a little more experienced in vampire fighting than Cole was.<br />
<br />
Little Ann meanwhile was doing her best at dodging the good vampire woman whilst still holding onto young Tommy. Ann knew that  they would be wasting time if they stayed here much longer and stomped her foot five times.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re going to do that?&quot; Ken asked hearing Ann&#39;s foot stomps as she stomped again.<br />
<br />
Nat&#39;s mother, Marissa, was confused at what the vampire girl was doing, but then her eyes went wide as little Ann took a deep breath.<br />
<br />
&quot;Everyone cover your ears, now!&quot; Marissa shouted as little Ann let out an earpiecing screech making Cole, Nat, and Kumiko who was still holding Yuriko cover their ears as best as they could.<br />
<br />
Ken covered his ears as well and ran to the front door motioning for little Ann to follow him as well. Both Ann and Ken knew that Lord Miro wouldn&#39;t be happy about them only acquiring one of the children, but they still had managed to capture one of them at least and made their way to the rendezvous point.</p>
