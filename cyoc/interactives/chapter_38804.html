<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As you leave the mall you notice that Rose isn't heading to the park. You would like to go back through the park and see if you can get back to your hometown. Maybe if you get back you'll recover your memories of your other life. Your afraid that if you do you won't remember and you would be stuck so you follow Rose. Walking through the city you notice people with extra arms, muzzles, tails, and a host of other transformations. You're curious about this so you ask &quot;Is everyone here transformed?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not everyone is transformed and most of those that are change what they are as they see fit&quot; Rose said. &quot;Mr. Talmas over there likes to change himself everyday. He's in his werewolf mood today so you don't want to get too close. When he's a werewolf he likes to have sex with any female. Don't stare at him since he'll take that as an invitation for sex whether you want to have it or not.&quot;<br />
<br />
You quickly avert your eyes. You do not want to be raped by a werewolf. You look around at the other people and wonder which ones were transformed and which weren't. At least you wondered that about those who were human looking. You make sure to keep close to Rose as you don't want to get lost in this city.<br />
<br />
After walking for about an hour Rose turns down a drive and after rounding a bend you see a mansion. It looked like it was four stories tall and and about three football fields long. You couldn't tell how far back it stretched but it didn't matter that much right now. It looked like it was built with some type of white stone. You had stopped when you saw the mansion and had to hurry to catch up to Rose. You caught up to her just as she reached the door and opened it.<br />
<br />
As you enter you see a huge foyer two stories tall. At the far end was a white marble staircase that went up and split off to the right and left leading to the second floor. There was a huge chandelier in the center of the ceiling. It looked to be made of gold but was probably just gold plated. The walls were decorated with a forest scene during fall. As you're looking around the foyer you see a centaur in a butlers uniform come from a door. He notices you and heads over. When he gets close enough he says &quot;Hello Miss Rose, you're home early.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There's been a little incident at the store Henry&quot; Rose said. &quot;Is my mother home?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She's in the ballroom overseeing the preparations for tonight&quot; Henry said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks Henry&quot; Rose said as she started to walk toward two large doors to the right.<br />
<br />
&quot;I hope everything will be alright at the store&quot; Henry said as you follow Rose.<br />
<br />
The doors led to a long hall with several doors on each side. Rose ignored these and headed to another set of large doors at the end. Going through these you see a large and elegant ballroom. It was a full four stories tall with balconies scattered about. A large chandelier hung from the ceiling and it looked like it was actually comprised of four chandeliers, one at each level in a straight line. There were many people hanging decorations off of the balconies and running streamers everywhere. In the middle of all this was a tall, slender woman watching the work and calling out instructions when needed.<br />
<br />
Rose went up to her and you followed. When the woman noticed you she asked &quot;Why aren't you at work Rose?&quot; with a stern look on her face.<br />
<br />
&quot;There was a little incident at the store and I had to close early&quot; Rose said in an uncomfortable tone.<br />
<br />
&quot;What happened?&quot; the woman asked a note of concern in her voice now.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, someone had cursed a pair of shoes and Lilly put them on&quot; Rose said in a small voice.<br />
<br />
The color drained from the woman's face leaving her as white as a ghost. She threw her arms around you and said &quot;Oh my baby! Are you alright?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She can't remember her life and she's convinced that she was a boy before coming into the store&quot; Rose said. &quot;I swear to you Mom, if I had known that the shoes were cursed I would never have let her put them on.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know you wouldn't have&quot; Rose's mom said. &quot;Well if that's all the curse did it should be easy enough to reverse. I'll have to speak with Corran about it but I'm sure he can find a way. Don't worry Lilly, you'll be back to normal soon.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank God for that&quot; you said relief evident in your voice. &quot;I didn't want to be a girl permanently.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You were born a girl though&quot; Rose's mom said. &quot;You have tried being a boy before but you didn't like it much.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I was born a boy though&quot; you said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know that you think that sis but it's not true&quot; Rose said. &quot;I see Corran Mom. Or I should say Corrine.&quot;<br />
<br />
You turn to look at the new person who came into the ballroom. Corrine was dressed in black and had three arms. The way she moved and her physical appearance reminded you of someone but you couldn't think of who she reminded you of.<br />
<br />
Once Corrine was close enough Rose's mom said &quot;Just the person I wanted to see. Lilly put on some cursed shoes and she's lost her memory as a result. Would you be able to reverse the curse?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I believe that I can&quot; Corrine said. &quot;I need to talk to you three alone.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What is this about?&quot; Rose's mom asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'd rather not say where other people can hear me&quot; Corrine said.<br />
<br />
&quot;We'll use the library&quot; Rose's mom said. &quot;The doors are nice and thick which will keep anyone from eavesdropping on us.&quot;</p>
