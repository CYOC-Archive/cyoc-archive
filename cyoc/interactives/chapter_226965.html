<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The Drow drifted in the truest weightlessness she had ever experienced in either of her lives. Kenzia’s silver hair floated around her like a halo as she bobbed up and down in her lover’s pool and sleeping quarters. She squinted in what she knew should be utter terror as she felt her breath seeping away from her under the water, yet she only felt excitement. Partly it derived from the thrill of the danger of it all, the closeness with death stoking some macabre fascination that she had yet to reconcile between her coexisting human and Drow psychologies. More importantly, it was the warm body and reassuring presence of Maraya floating a breath away from her. <br />
<br />
Just as Kenzia was beginning to become dizzy, she felt a rush of pleasure from her breast to her toes as Maraya’s delicate azure fingers, accentuated with tiny silver scales like signet rings brushed the Drow’s ears that fluttered excitedly under her ministrations. Kenzia opened her mouth to the water as she tasted the sweet and faintly salty taste of Maraya’s lips followed right after. Kenzia gasped as she felt much needed air rush in through the slits in her neck that hadn’t been there a moment before. <br />
<br />
Maraya giggled as Kenzia’s fingers curiously explored her borrowed gills. Even after undergoing one of the most radical transformations in her life, this was still a lot to adjust to.<br />
<br />
Maraya giggled and cupped her distracted lover’s rear, dragging their bodies together. “You make a cute fish. Don’t worry, they’ll go after you go back to land.”<br />
<br />
“I wouldn’t care if they do or not, not if it means I get to share this with you.” <br />
<br />
The Drow laced her hands with her lover’s and spun her into an intricate underwater slow dance.<br />
<br />
———-<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Janet shook her head as she mustered all her will to shake out of her sudden onset of listlessness and overpowering need for gratification. As she stood up she found her sense of balance rebel against her. Her head throbbed as though it was stuffed with cotton, and it was not being helped by the way her vision had become blurry and unfocused. As she wobbled on her feet, she held her left hand up in front of her face in an attempt to focus her sight. Instead, she blinked as she tried to disbelieve what she was seeing: her fingers turning stone gray up to the knuckle as though they’d been dipped in paint.<br />
<br />
She started hyperventilating as fear overtook her. This wasn’t good. She was ill, extremely ill. Janet fumbled for her phone and tried to dial a friend. She needed fresh air, a clear head, and most of all a ride to the hospital. She drummed her fingers as she dialed up Hannah in her contacts list. Without her noticing, she began absently tugging at her earlobe as she waited, a fidget she’d never indulged before. After an agonizing wait, her heart sank as her phone abruptly stopped vibrating, sent to voicemail.<br />
<br />
Janet rolled her eyes and started reciting her message. “Hey Hannah? Call me back when you’ve got a minute maybe? I’m not feeling so great, and I might need a ride to the clinic downtown. I’d ask Terry but his car’s in the shop. Thanks so much- uh, alright bye.”<br />
<br />
She was stumbling over to her front door as she closed her phone, and as she opened the door to step outside, she dropped it in shock. She stepped out not into a familiar apartment hallway of stained drywall and the faint odor of cat urine she knew and tolerated. Instead, she stepped out into an open-air promenade bathed in twilight. The enchanting aroma of spring wildfires and evergreen pine graced her nostrils as she inhaled the unmarred wilderness. That used to be her apartment building.<br />
<br />
Her phone fell onto the cobblestone under Janet’s feet that connected Janet and Terrence’s flat, or rather, their hut, to a scenic hamlet of villas and manor homes twined between the boughs of ancient trees that reach up to scratch the clouds. It landed not as a piece of technology, but a lustrous black stone inlaid with a swirling golden glyph. For some reason she couldn’t quite fathom, Janet knew that in this strange language that symbol meant “sending.”<br />
<br />
She breathed a sigh of relief. Stepping out into the fresh air, she realized that her eyes saw clearer and further than ever, she could hear the babbling of a brook over fifty feet away. More importantly, she understood clearly she had a direction and a purpose in this new setting. She turned over to the house across the path from her own. Without giving it a second thought, Janet began kicking off her running shoes as she made her way to the door, casting them off at the roadside. <br />
<br />
———<br />
<br />
Maraya and Kenzia reclined in the pool as they watched the sun setting on this miraculous new planet. Their planet. Kenzia relaxed into the water, and as she did, let out a sigh as steam rose from surface and the water shifted at Maraya’s will from cold ocean to hot spring, just as Kenzia was starting to find the cool water sapping the heat from her. <br />
<br />
“You’re unbelievable.” Kenzia whispered as she nuzzled into Maraya’s shoulder. Her lips trailing down Maraya’s breast, her fingers along her thigh. <br />
<br />
“Anything for you, my love,” Maraya purred. She eagerly sang for Kenzia as the dark elf’s tongue began to languidly trace around her nipple. Then, just as their lovemaking was about to resume, they were interrupted by the sound of a knock on their door.<br />
<br />
“Awww… do we have to stop now?” Maraya pouted.<br />
<br />
“Why should we? We’re the queens of our people. We can grant audiences however we like.” <br />
<br />
“You’re so right! They can watch us!” Maraya’s ears perked up, a chill of excitement ran down her spine at the prospect. Without a moment’s hesitation, Maraya blew the door open with a gust of wind, revealing their guest to the two elves. <br />
<br />
Janet all but jumped on the spot. There they were, the images of her recent fantasies, entwined together in a loving embrace. It was taking the last remaining reserves of her fading inhibitions not to leap in between them on the spot.<br />
<br />
Kenzia’s crimson gaze appraised their petitioner and perked her brow in intrigue. As far as she could tell this was probably their distant neighbor, Janet rang a bell. It was hard to tell though, as by now her transformation was well under way. Her brown irises has been engulfed by a shimmering white, and her brown hair was shot through with a shock of purest white. <br />
<br />
“Welcome, petitioner to the hall of of the sea monarch and the lunar empress, Maraya and Kenzia. I believe I already know why you’ve come, but please, speak your mind.” Kenzia said in a regal tone, while Maraya kissed at her neck.<br />
<br />
“I-I don’t exactly know why I’m here actually.” Janet stammered in their presence. “I just had this… hunch I guess, and I followed it.”<br />
<br />
Kenzia smiled cryptically. “But now you’re here, I’m sure you know exactly what to do next.” Kenzia was interrupted by a deep moan, as below the water she spread her legs to give Maraya’s fingers access to their waiting prize. “So join us- take your place at your sovereign’s side.”<br />
<br />
“Yes, my queen!” Janet answered outright giddily now. She never thought her queen would be so welcoming, so warm and inviting, least of all from what she heard about Drow from reputation in the stories, yet here she was. She tried to live up to her queen’s expectations, rather than rushing to the pool, she sauntered over, putting as much of a sway into her strut as she could. She choked down her self consciousness about her own body in the sight of these two goddesses, she pulled her shirt up over her shoulders, bearing her modest chest to the air, and shimmied out of her skirt as she was descending into the pool. <br />
<br />
The two elves parted ways as they made room for Janet between them. Who reclined into Kenzia’s waiting arms, as she embraced her from behind. The Drow’s hands cupped her new handmaiden’s breasts as she relaxed in the water, her nerves melting to the empress’ loving attention. Maraya had submerged under the water, only for her head to surface in front of Janet, smiling up at her.<br />
<br />
“You’re in for a treat,  handmaiden, Maraya is a master of the arts.” Kenzia cooed in Janet’s ear. The next moment, she ran her tongue along it, and with one long lick from lobe to tip, Kenzia pushed her lover’s ears out into two impressive, rising points. Bit down hard on her lip as that pleasure was reflected below as it was above, as Maraya settled in and began sampling her sex.<br />
<br />
“Now now, don’t hold back. Let my Maraya know how she makes you feel.” Kenzia instructed, her tone sweet yet firm. Janet’s voice filled the room as she obeyed, her muscles tensing as Maraya’s tongue teased along her walls and probed for her sweetest spot. <br />
<br />
The gray tone engulfing her skin slowly accelerated to a fever pitch as Janet was ushered into her new existence. To serve her queens will be a privilege, to world a blade and spell in their names an honor. Kenzia kneaded Janet’s breasts as they filled out to compliment her taller, statuesque new physique. <br />
<br />
“Tell me your new name, handmaiden. Tell me who will be the herald of my will in the world.” Kenzia commanded as she upped her pace, massaging Janet’s sensitive nipples to the point of soreness.<br />
<br />
“Jannavie, my lady! Jannavie of the sisterhood of the spider.” Her eyes welled up in pride, reciting the name and title like a mantra. As she declared her new identity, she felt a pulling in her stomach as she released the orgasm she held back to reward the end of her glorious transformation. The last trace of brown pigment drained away from her hair as she flooded Maraya’s lips with her juices which she eagerly lapped up. <br />
<br />
Jannavie curled up into Kenzia’s embrace as she admired her reflection in the still water of the pool, interrupted by Maraya’s face surfacing to pull the elf into a deep kiss to welcome the Drow to elvendom.</p>
