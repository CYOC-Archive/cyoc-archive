<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mr. Morrison took the medallion and put in in his pants pocket. As the realization of the happenings of the past few days filtered in his mind Jared and Jennifer continued to nickker.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey you two, don't get those animal instincts too wild or some little girl might end up having her first foal next Fall.&quot; said Mr. Morrison.<br />
<br />
Jared was already for a romp as his male flag was stiff in the breeze. Jennifer was almost willing to find out what the feeling of a mare's could offer. As her Father motioned Jennifer to follow him Jarred toddled along behind, his nostrils enjoying the heady scent.<br />
<br />
Once the three reached the stable Mr. Morrison took Jarred by his halter and pulled the sexually motivated stud into his stall. Turning to his Palamino daughter he took the Medallion from the pocket. &quot;I wish my daughter back to the girl she was yesterday!&quot;<br />
<br />
The Medallion glowed and to his surprise the Palamino mare began to crumple down. As mane and body hair fell to the stable floor he watched in love and terror as the moaning mare began to reshape in the daughter he so loved.<br />
<br />
Jarred watching this all happen stood looking over the siderail of his stall. Whinnies poured from him as he watched his best conquest melt into a human form again.<br />
<br />
Mr. Morrison could tell that the boy was quickly becoming more stallion now than human. A look to see Jarred's erection in full flare he thought of how a stallion show's it's impassioned thoughts. A thought of changing Jarred back to his boyish self quickly passed as Mr. Morrison decided he'd lost his moralities and only thought in procreation type patterns.<br />
<br />
As Jennifer moaned her feet were last to change. As her Father covered his naked daughter in a horse blanket he walked her to the main house. Words of comfort flowed from Daddy to Jennifer. Once inside the house Jennifer had only one thought and that was to go fast asleep.<br />
<br />
Mr. Morrison looked at his lovely daughter at peace asleep in her bed. The noise in the stable of an insulted stallion turned Mr. Morrison's head to look out the window.  A shake of his head as he rationalized Jarred's actions to those of a stallion spurned. &quot;I guess the boy's mind is lost in that wild instinctive passion of a stallion. It would be better if I sold him at auction.&quot; As then he looked at Jennifer, &quot;Yup she too would be far better off if that stud wasn't tempting her to his side.&quot; he thought.<br />
<br />
As Jennifer's Mother came how from her visit to the county Sheriff's office she was delighted to find Jennifer home. As questions poured out onto Mr. Morrison he was a little slow in offering good answers.<br />
<br />
Finally the Misses stood looking at her husband and with hands on hips said, &quot;Well Daddy what did go on this morning around here?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I have to show you or the white wagon will take me to the funny farm, Dear!&quot; he responded.<br />
<br />
A mumbling woman followed her husband to the stable. Once inside the farm owner asked Jarred to spell in the floor dust his wife's first name!  The Misses looked at her husband wide eyed and ready to call for the nut wagon. Jarred the stallion cocked his head as he had never known her as anything other than Misses Morrison.<br />
<br />
Slowly a hoof scratched, M-I-S-S-E-S  J-E-N-N-I-F-E-R-S  M-O-M<br />
<br />
Misses Morrison looked at the written and back to her husband's face.<br />
<br />
&quot;The pony is Jarred, and this magic medallion changed him to an animal!&quot; said Mr. Morrison slowly.<br />
<br />
The Misses looked at the pony and then at her husband. &quot;I don't believe it your both crazy!&quot; Even as she said it the words seemed outside any possible reason.<br />
<br />
&quot;Prove it to me, I think this is crazy, if this is what happened then what happened to Jenn?&quot; she asked stumbling over her words.<br />
<br />
The Medallion held in Mr. Morrison's fingers was suddenly grabbed away by his dear wife. &quot;Your crazy, you need to be locked up! Things like this don't happen and I'll prove it!&quot;<br />
<br />
Holding the Medallion in her finger tips and with a wild spited look on her face she hollared, &quot; If this thing has such power than.....&quot; As she looked about the barn, &quot;then this should make me believe by making me a prize American Shetland pony too since you prize that beast so very much!&quot;<br />
<br />
A toss of the Medallion to her husband and she started to stomp out of the stable in a rage. Just as the Medallion touched Mr. Morrison's hand he looked at it's bright glow. The medallion began it's spinning of a curse which the Misses would never forget. A scream from the backyard made Mister run out the stable.<br />
<br />
Moans and screams of his terrored wife came from inside the fenced patio and yard. As Mr. Morrison opened the gate he almost knew what he'd find. In fact he stood looking at his quickly changing wife. <br />
<br />
She had exploded in size. Her jeans had torn as the hindquarters of a pony mare bloomed in size. Shoe strings split as feet lengthened and a hoof replace human toes. Pony hair rapidly was covering her legs and lower body. The Misses eyes were wide in fright and with a half changed hand she beconed her husband to stop this all.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't know how to stop you wish until the Medallion is done!&quot; said Mr. Morrison.<br />
<br />
As she lay to her side and maoned with odd soundings her husband stood feeling his maleness rise to this occasion. The middleaged wife he'd loved for twenty years was rapidly gaining youth and a fine form for a pony mare. The Medallion was doing it's best to make a champion American Shetland pony mare out of his wife.<br />
<br />
As the Medallion cooled down the mare struggled to stand on all fours. A horrified wife approached her human husband and with both human and equine thoughts getting mixed she snuffed at the lump in his jeans.<br />
<br />
The gesture was almost too much for the man. As he grabbed the tops to his jeans he was ready to pounce aboard the mare, his wife. Lucky for him his tight leather belt stopped the move and made him thing of his actions. &quot;No dear if you really want to feel the passion of a mare then Jarred is your man, ah horse, ah stud, oh come on!&quot;<br />
<br />
The mare followed her husband to the stable. As the scent of mare touched the breeze Jarred 's head lifted high and with curled upper lips drank in the scent of mare.<br />
<br />
Mr. Morrison being a long time breeder of stock saw the then erect stallion doing his best to sniff of mare. Then turning to see his wife being out of rational human controlled thought as she stood with tail high and legs spread.<br />
<br />
Anger flaired in Morrison at the sight of animal passion's being shown by his wife. As he scowled at her no thought of the woman he'd married ran in his mind only thoughts of despised feelings. The feelings of being betrayed in love by his wife made him mad. If he'd stood long enough to think about all that had transpired he might not have done what he did.<br />
<br />
A unlatching of the box stall door he shooed the mare to a waiting stallion. Then as she trottrd inside he closed the door, latched the latch, and walked to the stable door. &quot;Enjoy it dear!&quot;<br />
<br />
As the wild animal noises came from one accustomed to his stallion's passion the whinnies of a mare's fears mixed.<br />
<br />
Mr. Morrison popped a beer can open and sitting on the rear deck of the home heard the whinnies from the stable.</p>
