<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Where are you? &quot; asked John in the darkness.  He could not see anything, and made his way forward slowly, blindly groping in the darkness.<br />
<br />
&quot;This way, &quot; whispered Heather quietly.  She did not want to wake Kim.  She would ruin everything.  Using her night vision she watched the small figure moving towards her.  &quot;Good, almost there.  Just keep going straight.&quot;<br />
<br />
John almost tripped as he walked into the sharp talon of Heather&#39;s front claw.  In the dark, her claw seemed much larger, dangerous and more menacing.  But he was doing this for Kim, for love.  He fought his fear and climbed onto her paw.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, I&#39;m here.  Now what? &quot; said John.  Suddenly, Heather&#39;s large head appeared before him, her face partially lit by the weak flashlight.  He dropped the flashlight in surprise.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just leave everything to me, &quot; said Heather.  <br />
<br />
She whipped out her tongue, the tip of which was nearly as long as his body - and began to lick him.  She wrapped her tongue around him lovingly, caressing his body with it.  She raised one talon, and brought it down his back, ripping off his clothes.  She cut his back a little, and he was about to protest, when the tongue returned and began to explore the newly exposed flesh.  <br />
<br />
John tasted strangely good to Heather, and she had to fight the urge to take his whole body into her mouth.  She was afraid that she might lose control and swallow him whole. She didn&#39;t want to imagine how they might change if he began to grow while confined in their stomach.<br />
<br />
John&#39;s body began to feel warm, and Heather knew his transformation was beginning.  She moved on to the next phase of her plan, and pulled John close to her body.  She rested his back against her chest, careful to make sure his head was on the left side of her body.  If this was going to work, she needed to remain in the middle.  <br />
<br />
John&#39;s back began to burn, but he did not struggle.  Neither Heather nor Kim had ever really explained how their transformations worked, and he thought that was just part of the process.  He relaxed, and let the warmth spread through his body. <br />
<br />
His body began to feel strange, filled with a sense of barely controlled energy.  He felt his body stretching, and Heather reacted by pulling him closer to her chest, pushing him tightly against her breast.  He could feel the warmth of her large chest against his back.  At first her scales felt sharp, but as he continued to change they felt softer.  His growth seemed to slow a little.  Instead, it felt like Heather&#39;s body was getting a little bigger, brushing past his neck a little.  <br />
<br />
His arms now felt weak and numb, and he felt confined against Heather&#39;s chest.  It was like something was surrounding him, almost smothering him.  He was about to complain when his neck suddenly shot forward, rapidly gaining length and width.  It made him feel dizzy, and he felt confused as his head began to rapidly swell.  <br />
<br />
His jaw ached as it extended into a snout.  He barely felt his hair fall away and his ears recede into his head. As his head began to rapidly grow larger, filling with jagged teeth, he found it harder and harder to focus.  He senses were overwhelmed.  He could see nothing in the darkness, but his body was awash in a thousand different intense sensations.  He decided to just close his eyes, and ride it out in a dull haze as he surrendered his mind to the strange sensations.<br />
<br />
<br />
Heather could feel her body beginning to grow larger, just as she had planned.  But this time she had something else in mind.  She didn&#39;t mind sharing her powerful body with Kim, but she did not like sharing control.  As she grew she concentrated, focusing on the powerful muscles of her arms, legs, and tail.  She imagined nerves - large thick bundles of nerves - extending from her spinal cord and into these muscles.  Her efforts were rewarded, as new nerves snaked down her spine and into her muscles.  The new nerve bundles as well as her old ones grew large as her body expanded, extending deep into the tissue, replacing Kim&#39;s withering nerves.  New tendrils of nerve fibers grew off of the old ones, delving deep into her muscles fibers, and giving her complete control over their new shared body.  Heather could sense her new mastery of their body, and cooed with pleasure at the thought of having complete control, as well as the pleasure of her still growing body.<br />
<br />
Kim was having a wonderful dream, unaware of Heather&#39;s betrayal.  In her dream, she and John were beginning to make love.  His foreplay was intense, and unbelievably pleasurable.  Every place he touched her felt warm and good.  As he touched her limbs they seemed to fill with energy and power.  She wasn&#39;t sure how, but it felt like John was touching her whole body at once.  She felt herself building to orgasm several times, but she held back, afraid that if she came these wonderful feelings would end, and she never wanted it to stop.  She was rudely awoken from her dream when the power was restored, and bright fluorescent lights snapped on.  She was still blinking awake when the room turned red, and she heard the familiar Klaxon alarm.  She shook her head, trying to clear away the haze, and began to look around the room.  For some strange reason, her body still felt really good, just like it had in the dream.  For a just a second she wondered if it wasn&#39;t a dream.  But the loud blaring Klaxon alarm quickly brought her back to reality.  Something was wrong. <br />
<br />
Kim looked at the terrace and was surprised to find it empty of guards.  Usually there was at least one there, watching over them.  Shortly, several men in large khaki overalls and masks entered and began to stare at her.  They were talking loudly, but she couldn&#39;t understand what they were saying.  Their voices sounded tiny, like the squeaks of little mice.  Several guards now stormed into the room and ran onto the platform, with their tranquilizer guns raised.  Some of the guards lowered their guns,  and pointed at her body.  Kim looked down, and didn&#39;t see anything wrong.  Suddenly she realized that the guards were not looking at her, but rather beside her, at Heather&#39;s side of the body. <br />
<br />
Of course it would be Heather, thought Kim. What kind of trouble has she gotten us into today?<br />
<br />
Kim craned her neck to look at Heather, and was shocked by what she saw.  They had a new addition to their body, a new head that was rapidly growing to match their size.  With a shock, she realized that it was John.<br />
<br />
&quot;John, John, are you okay? &quot; asked Kim.  John only grunted, overwhelmed by the sensations assaulting him as he changed.  &quot;Heather, you bitch!  What have you done?&quot;<br />
<br />
Heather just laughed.  She knew it was too late for Kim to stop her.  Soon she would be free.  Her collar lit up, and two lights turned blue.  The collar was tight on her neck, pinching it painfully.  <br />
<br />
Heather knew that the addition of John&#39;s body to her own had caused her to grow.  Their breastbone was now even with the terrace the guards used, a position she used to need to stretch her long neck to reach.  The third light went off, and a shock was discharged from the necklace.  She felt an irritating buzz, like a child&#39;s joy buzzer, but nothing more.  It was nothing like the previous shocks, which were powerful enough to leave her unconscious and drooling.  Heather realized that her skin was now thicker, and tougher.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Guess I am changing in other ways, too, thought Heather gleefully.  I am not just getting bigger, I am getting stronger, too.<br />
<br />
She felt a second shock discharge from the collar.  It felt even weaker this time, like a little tingle.<br />
<br />
&quot;You are too late, &quot; she shouted as she taunted the guards, her voice a loud boom in the now small room.  &quot;You can&#39;t stop me now.  I have become too powerful!&quot;<br />
<br />
The collar snapped off her neck, as it grew too thick for it to contain.  Heather smiled and turned to the terrace, incinerating it with a large jet of flame.  The guards retreated into the control room, fleeing from her fiery wrath.<br />
<br />
Kim was horrified by Heather&#39;s actions.  She felt like she had gotten to know the girl well over their two-year long confinement together.  The girl was odd, but she was also nice and funny.  True, she had a weird obsession with dragons, and endlessly talked about escape.  But she had never been this cruel and vicious.  Now she had not only attempted to kill people, she had actually involved John in this, someone she deeply cared for.  This had gone on long enough, and she decided it was time she put a stop to it.<br />
<br />
Kim focused and tried to move her side of the body, the right side.  With a shock, she found it completely unresponsive.  She couldn&#39;t even muster a twitch in a digit of her paw.  She could feel everything in her limbs, but nothing below her neck responded to her mental commands. It was like the sensory nerves were intact, but the muscular nerves had been burned away.<br />
<br />
Heather could feel Kim attempting to gain control of their body again.  Some of Kim&#39;s muscular nerves were still intact, although woefully outmatched by the sheer number and size of Heather&#39;s own.  Heather turned her attention away from the guards and back to her own body.  She frowned and concentrated, willing her own nerves to become even bigger and more numerous.<br />
<br />
&quot;You are too late now, too, Kim, &quot; said Heather.  &quot;I would have gladly shared control with you, but you just had to betray me.  Now I can&#39;t trust you anymore.  There is only room for one master here, and that master is me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Heather, what you have done?&quot;  said Kim softly.<br />
<br />
&quot;I did what you were too cowardly to do.  What was best for the both of us ... I have set us free!&quot; said Heather, as she stretched her still growing body.  Their back was pushing against the roof, and Kim had to curl her growing neck around the room.  She was looking at the side of Heather&#39;s face.  It looked even bigger than hers, and her teeth seemed longer and more monstrous.  To her left was John&#39;s head.  It was now bald, and covered in the same thick green scales.  Two large horns curled out of his head, growing longer and more twisted as she watched.  His neck was long and curled in front of their body, laying in their front claws.  His eyes were closed, and he was lost in the throes of their transformation.<br />
<br />
&quot;But, Heather, how could you do this to John?  He was always so nice to you.  He was your friend!&quot; said Kim sadly.  She desperately wanted to comfort him, but she could not move her hands.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Fool!  You still do not understand, &quot; said Heather, as she continued to stretch and move around the room, trying to get her growing body comfortable as the room rapidly continued to get smaller.  &quot;This is a gift!  A gift you rejected, but nonetheless still a wonderful gift.  He will thank me for this power!   You should thank me, too.  Now you will have your lover at your side forever.  And be closer and more intimate than any two lovers could ever imagine.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Heather, please.  You have to stop. This isn&#39;t right, &quot; said Kim.  &quot;This isn&#39;t like you.  Not the Heather I know, and have grown to love like a sister.  Heather......&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Enough, &quot; boomed Heather.  &quot;Stop calling me that.  The &#39;Heather&#39; you knew is dead.  I....We are better, we are stronger, we are more.  We are the beast that men fear, we are the fire that burns cities, we are the terror that destroys armies.  WE ARE BEHEMOTH!&quot;,  said Heather, as she stood up to her full height on her hind legs and tore through roof of the building.</p>
