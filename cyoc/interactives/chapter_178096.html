<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You don’t know how long you’ve been here. Perhaps it&#39;s only been a few minutes, but it feels like you’ve been at this forever. Heaving and heaving egg after egg… until it all just… stops.<br />
<br />
You roll over on your back, surrounded by frog eggs, desperately trying to fill your lungs again. If nothing else, at least you can be rest assured that you still have those. It doesn’t really feel good to breathe though, your latex belly rises and falls a lot more extremely than it did normally. In fact, as you close your eyes out of quiet dread, you realize that despite the fact that your throat is clear of eggs right now that it’s just harder to breathe in general. <br />
<br />
You feel extremely light-headed. Your innards feel like putty. Is this really how you go out? Once more you reach a hand down to your latex belly, feeling yourself up and down. Somehow you just know that there are more eggs in there, you haven’t thrown up more in a while now but you’re extremely sure that more are coming soon. The thought disturbs you as you begin to prod at the latex as if to check that you’re not crazy, however you soon come to realize something rather disturbing as you do so. Not only does your belly feel almost entirely empty, at least in regards to your bones or stomach and such which is all bad enough, but as you continue to move your arm down your belly you start to notice that the latex was going a lot further down your body than you remember it going. You sit up, only to realize that you’ve already gone down enough south for your hand to slip through the top of your pants, towards a large bulge that definitely wasn’t there before.<br />
<br />
Your hand quickly moves to touch it, as if just to see if it’s real, and sure enough your stomach isn’t the only latex bulge you have now, it’s just that the one pushing out from your nethers appears to be in a bit of a wider shape, going from where your dick should be all the way around to your ass. You can’t believe you somehow never noticed it until just now, considering how tightly it’s swelling against the constricting force of your clothes, but as you pathetically grope at it more in a pathetic attempt to push it back down you eventually just realize that you can’t feel… almost anything down there anymore. It’s not just as if your lower body fell asleep, it’s like most of your nerves have completely disappeared around your waist and upper legs. You think you can still feel… SOME things down there, but the sensation is indescribable. Even still, you struggle to move, the force exerting from the ever-enlarging protrusion pushing your legs further apart as if you’re doing the splits and eventually causing so much strain on your pants that they start to rip.<br />
<br />
You fall back to the floor and shudder involuntarily as the latex breaks free from its confines, the bulge itself even seeming to twitch and wiggle in ways that you don’t think it should. A loud POP echoes through the night as your pants finally tear in half, your legs still spreading further apart than you think is actually possible. The bulge moves itself from side to side, growing, inflating, and you let out a loud shriek as you finally come eye-to-eye with what has become of your crotch… literally. What you are met with are the protruding latex eyes of the frog you encountered earlier, emerging from a still-forming head sticking out from between your now-green legs.<br />
<br />
Can now see what the last little parts of your crotch that you still felt were. The pathetic remnants of your cock and balls as they are slowly consumed by the latex and absorbed into the front of the frog’s cartoonish face, or rather it’s mouth. In fact, you know now why the feeling was ‘indescribable’, your cock head IS the mouth, widening out in the front of the frog’s face as your hole twitches and moves as the frog attempts to open it. You can only assume that from the weird angle your crotch contorted as it was inflating that your ass served a similar fate as you can’t think of where else the small nose holes could have come from. Perhaps worse than all of that, somehow, is what’s happening to your legs. The now greenish-blue color slowly moves down your calves, the remnants of your pants still straining against what’s left of your flesh as your lower legs begin to inflate bigger and bigger the closer it gets to your feet. <br />
<br />
You try to stand back up, or if nothing else just kick the frog head is if doing that would make it go away, but you just can’t. Your legs won’t respond to you, even though the frog’s cheeks have presumably gotten as big as they are going to get your legs are still splitting further and further to the sides. You have no clue how you aren’t in excruciating pain right now, your legs are practically in a straight horizontal line at your sides by this point. Almost as if by magic, they eventually do start to move, though not by your own will. The frog head emits a small noise of what you think is a grunt as your legs bounce about, as if they grew a mind of their own. Your knees buckle and straighten out as you are rocked about by the forces shaking you, not even noticing how your chest is beginning to inflate with latex as well. Your right leg eventually stops, as your left reaches over towards it and rolls you onto your side. It kicks at the last remnants of your pants, kicking them further and further down while squishing in the latex over and over as if to constantly demonstrate to you how hollow it is. It struggles to get it all down as your lower legs continue to thicken, your thigh nowhere close to comparable in thickness… in fact you think your thighs might even be a little thinner than before. It presses your pant scraps up against your shoe and kicks down, trying to shake off all of your clothes. Your shoe pops off right away, your pants take a little more time to kick off from your sock slowing it down, and as for your sock… well, it has a hard time with that. <br />
<br />
The frog makes a noise almost as if in annoyance as it seems to give up and rolls back over to your other leg to work off all your clothes there, but by now your lower legs have thickened so much that your upper pant leg is left stuck on your now-smaller upper leg. You shudder with a final pang of the strange feeling in your cock as the latex finally overcomes it and the frog gains full control over its new mouth. Your attention is quickly stolen away from it however, as it appears to take in a deep breath before letting out a loud croak-like whine. With every breath, your chest’s growth finally catches your attention, rising and falling with every call. Unlike your belly when you were first caught, your chest didn’t inflate nearly as much, becoming about as wide as your belly was when the eggs were finished coming out. Specifically when they finished coming out, because when you make the comparison in your head you notice that your belly isn’t entirely the same size in all places. Although very subtle, the sides of your belly seem to be pushing out slightly, which you confirm by moving your hand down there. If you were to view yourself from above, you would have probably been able to recognize them as pseudo-breasts, but you’re a bit too preoccupied to come to that conclusion right now.<br />
<br />
Your exploration into your new fake cartoon-frog boobs is short-lived, as the latex from your chest starts to wrap around to your back. As if a switch was flipped, your spine suddenly straightens back out against your will, slamming your head back onto the ground, The frog continues to whine as the rubber starts to affect your foot, which is now further straightening out as an extremely harsh and uncomfortable pressure starts to press down on your still-human forefoot. It’s like the skin between your toes is being shoved backwards, while your toes remain somehow stagnant. Your socks and remaining shoe start to feel a bit looser, but your pant legs are still stuck on your thickening latex leg. The whines seem to double in speed, as if the frog was in pain. You sure hope it is, how the hell does it think YOU feel about this bullshit? You move your hands to your ears, praying the latex doesn’t take away your shoulders as you try to block out the annoying squeaks of the latex and the croaking whines from the monster invading your body. You wish the noises would just fucking stop already! Alas, you get your wish, alright, but you find yourself coming to immediately regret making that wish as you catch a glimpse at just what the frog was calling for.<br />
<br />
It’s the other frog from before, the one that did this to you. It emerges from the bushes and comes ever closer towards you as your right leg stretches towards it, almost as if it was reaching for him. Your voice gets caught in your throat when you try to scream as it reaches you and bends down towards your ‘other half. Although you can’t sit up to look at it better, you can barely catch a glimpse of its face from over your belly-protrusions and could almost swear that you catch sight of a shit-eating grin directed squarely at you as it flicks off your right sock. It moves to the other leg and promptly tosses off your footwear, and begins to tug on the pant leg in an attempt to get it unstuck. The frog-head whines again as it pulls, but it doesn’t seem to come undone. You couldn’t really care less about their pant-escapade, as you’re more concerned about whatever the hell is happening to your feet! Your right leg is back to it’s split-position from before, but you swear to god that it’s getting closer towards you, as if the bone within was completely gone allowing the leg to bend all the way to your sides. Judging from the way the toes are thinning out and extending, their tips turning a yellow whade and plumping up slightly; looking significantly more like fingers as your big toe is forced down the side of your shrinking foot.<br />
<br />
There’s a loud RIIIIP as the frog-man decides to tear apart the pant leg to free the new arm that has become of your left leg. The frog-head makes a soft noise of appreciation, as the frog-man helps it to… sit up. You’ve had your suspicions for a while, hell you’ve known precisely what was happening ever since you saw the head, but you were so desperate to deny that it was happening that you blocked out the possibility from your mind. Now, however, as your former crotch gains full control over her new ‘hands’  and moves them up in ways your legs could have never moved as it explores it’s new feminine body you can’t deny that you know damn well what’s happening to you. <br />
<br />
The frogs are lost in one another’s eyes; and with another sickening SQUEEEEAAAK you lose control of your shoulders and you involuntarily raise your arms above your head as you are barely able to eye the man-frog’s tongue slither out of its mouth. It’s happening again. It’s gonna happen over and over again. You want to cry, but you find your tear ducts unresponsive as the two’s tongues slither down one another’s throats.<br />
<br />
You try to scream as your arms begin to puff up, possibly quicker due to the presence of the gas within your body becoming apparent in the frog’s belly starting to swell once more, but to no avail as you can only release a bit of air. Have you even been breathing this whole time? You have no idea how you’re still alive, especially now. Your lower arms, thickening into thighs, have grown so thick that you can feel them squeezing the sides of your head. That isn’t even mentioning the belly, swelling more and more to the point of blocking out your vision. It becomes so big that the latex pushes against your face; you can feel the cold squishy material, and it feels empty. Your hands fold forwards, the backside of your hands inflating into the soles of a rubbery pair of feet, your digits merging together and stretching out as a thin layer of latex pulls out further from between them to form webbing.<br />
<br />
It’s at your neck now, the belly beginning to stretch big enough to where your head is beginning to lift off of the ground. It  doesn’t last for very long, however, the belly only reaches up to about half of your neck as you feel a tugging sensation from behind pulling you back down to the ground. However, the ground never comes, as your head squeezes through the frog’s enormous new thighs to jut out of the frog’s rear. She must have been helped up by the man-frog after her legs formed. You clench your jaw as you can feel the latex moving up the back of your head, the skin seeming to mow off clumps of your hair like a pair of scissors as the tugging centers entirely on the tip of the back of  your head. A small nub begins to grow out, wiggling slightly as air begins to inflate it up and the hair surrounding it is cut off from the lack of pores. With two small puffs, a small tail nub is formed with nothing but 3/4ths of a human head on the underside.<br />
<br />
You feel even more light-headed than usual. Your vision is blurred, sounds are muffled, you try to make a sound but nothing will come out. You are only barely aware of the frog man’s presence as it squats down and stares at you with another cartoonish smirk. It’s tongue slithers out towards you, taking its time as it is very clearly enjoying something about what’s happening to you. It caresses your cheek when it reaches you, almost like a taunt, and it’s very effective, as you deeply fear what is going to happen next.</p>
