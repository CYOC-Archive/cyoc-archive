<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Looking into her many options, she knew what she needed to be.  See, Janet has always been pushed around by kids stronger then her, that she would never fight back.  She’s sick of it all.  She decided she was tired of being a spineless weakling. She was tired of lacking true confidence. The toughest kind of girl though...would be an army girl! She thought of her ideal army girl: strong, confident, but disciplined and courageous. That she would defend her country and sacrifice everything to protect it.  Knowing what she would do, she focused on her idea soldier girl.  That’s when the Amulet shined, and her transformation began!<br />
<br />
Janet felt herself begin to change! Her body seemed to slim down a little, but also felt more...tough? Looking into the mirror, she doesn’t look tough, but the changes were evident.  She also became a little bit taller. Her hair got a little darker, and shorter as well. Her skirt became shorter as well, embarrassing the young woman. Still, at least the necklace was working!<br />
<br />
Suddenly, almost all of Janet&#39;s clothes disappeared! Her skirt, stockings and shoes were all gone. Her cute girly panties had been replaced by more conservative green ones. Her shirt partially remained, though it only barely covered her still small breasts. Her hair got a little darker as well. While she was embarrassed, she felt something else now...anger? “How dare this stupid amulet get rid of my clothing!” she said with a bit of tone in her voice, “Hope this works though.  I feel like I want to take my frustration on someone.”  Though she could feel her rage building, she was confident enough to not let it bother her much...<br />
<br />
Janet&#39;s changes continued. Her tiny shirt was now completely gone, replaced with a green sports bra. She felt far stronger than before, as muscles developed all over body, though they were most visible with her abs. Her hair got even shorter, and changed colors to be a darker brown. It was also looked a little more organized. Her eyes changed, looking green and much stronger. She felt a little bit uncomfortable, but she also felt strong, and braver than before.  Almost like all the weakness in her old life is slowly diminishing away as a new sense to courage rose into her.  “You know, this isn’t so bad actually.” Janet said with a bit of confidence, “I’ve been through far harder situations than being in my underwear!  Just going to need some clothes to cover myself up and I’m ready to go out in the field.”<br />
<br />
Janet felt far more comfortable now because after she said that, clothes appeared on her, covering herself up. Black shorts appeared on her legs. They looked strange, like they were part of a uniform. A white dress shirt appeared as well, even though it was only partially buttoned up. Her hair became shorter, and tied in a bun at the back. It also became a lighter shade of black. Her breasts grew much larger as well. New memories flowed into her. She&#39;s been working very hard at the academy. Her skills are sharp, and her mind is sharper. She&#39;ll make a fantastic officer, especially with her previous active field duty. She was not confident not only in her body, but in her skills as well. Nothing could stop her!  A smile crept to her face as she could feel herself getting more confident, more cunning, and more skilled then what happened with her previous life.  It almost felt like she’s ready to take on the world!<br />
<br />
Janet felt a lot more battle ready now. She was nearly fully dressed in her Class As (dress uniform). She was ready for class at the military academy. Despite going there, she had actual combat experience as well. She served two tours before deciding to go to the academy and become an officer. She was also carrying a pistol in her hand and felt fearless holding on to it.  She was a précised marksman and during her training, she was an excellent shooter.  Her valuable experience in the field makes her tough and very well respected among the other students, as well as with her friends and family. She felt proud to serve her country. She just had to grab a few more things, button up her coat and she would be ready...<br />
<br />
Janet&#39;s transformation was now complete. She closed up her coat and put on her hat. She had to look her best today...after all, today was her graduation. She would cease being a cadet at the academy, and move on to become an officer. It had always been her dream, and now it was going to be fulfilled. In the future, she would move up through the ranks, her confident attitude and sharp mind always serving her well. Janet was truly happy, not only to serve her country, but with her life as well. She made a quick salute to the mirror, ready to get into battle and defend her country.<br />
<br />
As her body finished changing, the world around her changed as well.  Her old house shifted around and was looking less like where she used to live.  Once the changes were finished, she could tell that she was in her private quarters and it was well organized from her military like bed to her closet of the exact same uniform.  Looking out at the window, Janet could see the view of the military academy as her memories were finished arranging.  Her name wasn’t Janet anymore, it was June, a private graduating to the academy.  She was born in a family of soldiers and although she was born a girl, she had that fighting spirit in her genes.  And all that training and discipline has finally paid off.  Once she graduates, she will go overseas to protect her country, and her family.  Putting the pistol in her holster, she left her room and headed to the graduation ceremony, ready for what the future has in store for her.</p>
