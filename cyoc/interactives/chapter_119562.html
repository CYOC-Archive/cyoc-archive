<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">He led Ty into the house give him a tour.  They grabbed some water from the fridge.  Ty then asked if he could see Luca&#39;s awards.  Luca led him to his room, a place none of the other guys had seen.  On the walls next to his bed were sketches and drawings of all the places he had competed at.  There was a bookcase with a variety of books from manga to maintaining a healthy diet to some fiction books Ty loved.  On the opposite wall was a desk  and some shelves on the wall that Luca&#39;s dad had put up for his trophies.  As Luca showed him around, he hurried by by the trophies.  Luca was very humble and almost felt like he was bragging when he talked about them.  Ty thought this was adorable.<br />
&quot;So um yeah, these are sketches of all the places Ive been.&quot;  Luca said pointing the wall by his bed.  He then stepped back, about to turn around and he bumped into Ty&#39;s chest.  &quot;Oh sorry&quot; he said as he turned around.  Ty hadn&#39;t moved an inch, smiled and looked down into Luca&#39;s eyes &quot;Sugah this is all amazing...you are amazing!&quot; <br />
<br />
Luca stepped back and slowly made his way to his bed and sat down.  Even though he had a full size bed, he hadn&#39;t realized how small his room was until Ty was in it.  Ty sat down next to him.  Luca, feeling brave, looked over at Ty and stole a quick kiss...or at least that&#39;s what he intended but Ty pulled him close into a much more passionate kiss.  Ty took the initiative and pulled Luca on top of him so he straddled him as the kissed.  Ty&#39;s hands slowly made their way under Luca&#39;s sweatshirt and the spandex like material of the shirt he wore beneath that.  Luca, in the meantime, feeling emboldened he worked his way down Ty&#39;s bull like neck, then his ears causing Ty to let out a deep moan of pleasure.  <br />
<br />
Because both wore baggy clothes, most people were unaware of how built both were.  Luca made his way back to Ty&#39;s mouth, as he did this he reached down pulled Ty&#39;s shirt off.  Taking the cue from Luca and removed Luca&#39;s sweatshirt and the shirt underneath.  Ty knew gymnasts had to be in shape, but he wasn&#39;t expecting this.  He was as in shape as Ty , maybe not as big, but still for a 16 year old , he was stacked.  &quot;God damn!&quot; he exclaimed.  Ty then laid on the bed, pulling Luca on top of him.  <br />
&quot;I can&#39;t believe this is happening.&quot;  Luca said with a smile on his face and a dreamy look in his eyes.<br />
&quot;What do you mean?&quot; Ty said, as he stopped nibbling on Luca&#39;s ear.<br />
&quot;It&#39;s just...I dunno.  I&#39;ve had a crush on you since the day we met, but I wasn&#39;t sure what to do because I was trying to get over something.&quot; Luca blushed<br />
&quot;Ohh so you like all this?&quot;  Ty said cheekily as he gestured up and down his body.<br />
&quot;No.  I mean yes but its not the reason.  What I like about you is how nice you have always been to me.   When I&#39;m gone at a competition, you genuinely act like you miss me.  If I need help, you&#39;re always right there to help.  Of course you have an amazing body and are hot, but to me that&#39;s just a bonus.&quot;  Luca said looking into Ty&#39;s eyes.  <br />
&quot;Good answer sugah.&quot; Ty said pulling in close and kissing him.<br />
<br />
Both were completely hard.  Luca made his way down Ty&#39;s mountainous pecs.   He teased Ty&#39;s nipples with his tongue causing Ty to moan as he ground his rock hard cock against Ty&#39;s.  Much to Ty&#39;s surprise as Luca kissed each of Ty&#39;s abs, Luca whispered, &quot;I want you inside of me!&quot;  Ty had intended to take things slow.  He really liked Luca but how could he say no to that face?  He whispered ok.  Luca motioned to 2nd desk drawer.  Ty opened it and pulled out a condom.  As he handed it to Luca, he asked &quot;Are you sure you want to do this sugar?&quot;  Luca responded by unbuttoning Ty&#39;s pants and pulling the pants and underwear down.  Before putting the condom on, Luca took all but 3 inches of Ty&#39;s cock in his mouth.  Ty moaned, arching his back.  He then stopped Luca saying &quot;I want to try something.&quot;  Ty removed Luca&#39;s pants and tossed them aside.  He then positioned himself so that he could take Luca&#39;s 8 inch cock in his mouth.  Luca took Ty&#39;s cock back into his mouth.  Both bobbing up and down, both feeling up the other&#39;s muscular and legs.  Ty was amazed how awesome Luca was, he had never gotten a blowjob quite like this.  It was the same for Luca.  He and his ex only did this once and it was a struggle.  But Ty...Ty seemed to be enjoying sucking his dick and much receiving it.  As he was about to cum, he grabbed Ty&#39;s ass and squeezed. Ty also grabbed Luca&#39;s ass and squeezed.  This sent Luca over the edge, causing Luca to let out a loud moan as he came, which caused Ty to cum.  Each amazed the other by being able to swallow it all.  Luca then turned around to face Ty and devoured his mouth in a passionate kiss.  <br />
<br />
Luca then opened the condom and slowly unrolled it over Ty big, still throbbing brown cock.  The only he had seem once that big was in porn.  Ty whispered again &quot;Are you sure?&quot;  Luca responded by positioning himself over Ty&#39;s penis and slowly guiding it in.  Ty was thoroughly amazed, not only could this boy take his cock in his mouth and do wonderful things with it, but he could also take it in his ass without so much as a wince.  Even some of the guys at competitions would complain and make him pull out, but Luca was somehow different.  He pulled the 16 year old olive skinned beauty on top of him and kissed him with more passion than he had ever done with anyone.  He ran his hands all over Luca&#39;s body.  Though a little smaller, he ran his hands over Luca&#39;s muscular pecs.  He the went down his shoulders.  As Luca tensed as Ty&#39;s cock went in and out, Ty noticed how developed his arms were.  His biceps looked like they had softballs underneath.  He ran his hands down Luca&#39;s muscular forearms and then over to his abs.  His abs were ripped.  He had never realized how built Luca was because he usually wore baggy clothing.  It not like he didn&#39;t know gymnasts were fit, but didn&#39;t expect anything like Luca.  Another thing that made Luca different, was how the were having sex.  All the guys he had been with in the past preferred doggy style but this boy was different.  He looked up at the sexy boy with the angelic face, and in that instant realized he was falling for him.  Jae had told him that the boy was special when they first met him and to be gentle.  Ty said he would judge for himself.  <br />
<br />
They both felt the other&#39;s muscles tense at the same time.  Luca let out a low grunt  while Ty let out a deep gutteral moan, Ty came in Luca&#39;s ass causing Luca to shoot onto Ty&#39;s chest.  Luca then collapsed into Ty&#39;s waiting arms.  Both boys were spent.  Luca rested his head on Ty&#39;s massive chest as he listened to his heartbeat.  They laid like this for what seemed like hours, periodically kissing.  Nothing needed to be said.  They fell asleep like this, Luca laying on top of Ty, arms wrapped around his shoulders, Ty with his massive arms holding Luca, keeping him close, their legs intertwined.  <br />
<br />
They woke up around 10.  Luca kissing Ty on the mouth.  Without saying a word, he got up from the bed and grabbed Ty&#39;s hand pulling him up from his bed.  He slowly guided Ty from the bedroom to the bathroom.  Thankfully his parents had a walk in shower that they both could fit in.  After testing the water, Luca turned on the shower and let Ty in.  Ty barely fit until he stood sideways ensuring neither would be cold.  They continued to kiss.  Luca grabbed the soap and started to wash Ty, first starting on his left pec and then over to the right.  After he washed both arms, he guided the soap down each of Ty&#39;s abs.  He looked up at Ty who smiled and then kissed him.  He ran the bar of soap down each of Ty&#39;s muscular thighs and calves.  Then he went up with the bar of soap and began to wash Ty&#39;s cock, building up a nice lather while causing Ty to get erect again.  Then with a smile, Luca turned around and again guided Ty&#39;s cock into his waiting ass.  As Ty gently pushed, Luca let out a low grunt. As Ty began thrusting in earnest, he was amazed at how flexible Luca was.  Then much to Luca&#39;s surprise, Ty picked him up and gently spun he around, and Luca&#39;s cock didn&#39;t fall out once.  Ty kissed Luca as Luca wrapped his legs around Ty&#39;s torso.  This really demonstrated how both were.  Luca was able to keep up with the rhythm of Ty&#39;s thrusts and Ty was able to hold Luca while he thrust and kissed.  Then hold Luca with one arm, Ty reached down and grabbed Luca&#39;s dick and started pulling.  Luca moaned and it was long until both men came.  The continued to kiss as they finished washing each other.<br />
<br />
They both dried off and returned to Luca&#39;s bedroom where they laid in each other&#39;s arms.  Luca looked up into Ty&#39;s brown eyes and said &quot;I don&#39;t want to seem needy or anything...but...&quot;  Luca turned red and became slightly bashful...&quot;well...I mean...I guess...well If you wanted, you could stay over..&quot;  Ty grabbed his phone and typed on it and then set it down.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh sugah you aren&#39;t needy at all, you&#39;re sweet.  I guess since you&#39;re all alone, especially after that horror movie, you shouldn&#39;t be alone.&quot;<br />
Luca smiled &quot;You sure your parents wont mind?&quot;<br />
&quot;I just texted my mom, she won&#39;t have a problem with me staying over.  Although&quot; he said feigning concern.. &quot;I hope my parents won&#39;t have a problem with me havin a white boy as my boyfriend&quot; he said trying to keep a straight face but failing.<br />
&quot;That&#39;s what you&#39;re worried about?  What they will think dating a white boy...not that I&#39;m a boy??&quot;  Luca said concerned.  &quot;Wait...&quot;<br />
&quot;He&#39;s almost caught on! &quot; Ty said<br />
&quot;Hang on a sec..&quot;<br />
&quot;Almost there...&quot; Ty&#39;s smile getting bigger.<br />
&quot;Did you just say...I&#39;m your boyfriend???&quot; Luca said, eyes as wide as dinner plates.<br />
&quot;Sweetheart my parents have known since I was like 10 or 11.  And yeah I called you my boyfriend.  I took my time tryin to get to know you before I did anything.  Plus Jae told me about what happened with your ex and you needed time to heal.  Between getting to know you spending time with you, I realized what an amazing person you are.  You are always so positive!  You are smart!  You have a heart bigger then everyone know!  You&#39;ve got the face of an angel.  And I didn&#39;t realize how ripped you are.  And to be honest - that was just the most amazing sex Ive ever had.  A person like you doesnt come into people&#39;s lives often.  Knowing all this, except the last two, I realized I had to make you mine before someone else realized all this and stole you.  But I never anticipated tonight.  I think we are made for each other.  So I guess I shouldn&#39;t be so presumptuous.&quot;  Ty paused.  &quot;Will you be mine Luca?&quot;<br />
A few tears started to stream down his face as he said &quot;YES!!!&quot;  and before Ty could respond, he kissed him with such passion.  <br />
Ty stopped and said &quot;Shit...How the hell am I ever going to top our first date?&quot; <br />
Luca responded &quot;Oh shut up&quot; and they continued to kiss.  Eventually falling asleep, naked in each other&#39;s arms.</p>
