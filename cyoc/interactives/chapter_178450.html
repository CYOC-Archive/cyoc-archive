<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Urial stirred from consciousness again. His eyes shot open and looked around at his surroundings. Where was he? Urial looked at the unfamiliar scene around him. It was wooden, and small even for him. There was a pad that he was laying on, and looked beg enough to lay flat on. He could sit up on his hands and knees but not stand, perhaps if he sat in certain angles he could kneel. There was a window, it was bright outside. He could see grass and another familiar building much bigger than the one he was in. This window was strange, however, it had no pane and why was it on the floor of the little hut? Urial realized he was actually INSIDE the doghouse they built when they first arrived. Ashton was practically begging for a dog by the end of the car ride and built it first and foremost.<br />
<br />
Urial looked down at himself, realizing he was still naked and very sore. His ass throbbed in pain and pleasure, having had three rough fuckings from his own father. Around his neck he found a heavy collar connected to a chain that led outside the door. <br />
<br />
&quot;They took me outside and collared me, putting me in the dog house? Why would Dad do this to punish me?&quot; Urial wondered to himself. &quot;Does he want me to be a dog? I&#39;m stuck outside naked now, I bet the chain won&#39;t go inside the actual house either.&quot; This thought began to feel arousing for Urial, enslaved and naked in the yard. Urial&#39;s penis began to get very hard, throbbing even. Urial peered at the house from his dog door, safely protected from being seen from inside by strangers. He knew he couldn&#39;t dare come up to them naked, it was probably best to wait for his Dad to come to him. He didn&#39;t see anyone nearby, and the old door creaks when opened. With that, he gripped his cock and began to pump. He laid back on his pad, Urial began to wonder if he would be made to sleep out here. That thought only made him pre more.<br />
<br />
He began to think of his Dad now, who most certainly put him out here after fucking him last time. His nice body, how warm he felt through the night next to him, dick buried deep into his ass. urial prodded a finger to his sloppy butt, it made him whimper involuntarily. His father certainly did some damage he will need to recover from. He pre&#39;d more at the thought. Urial thought of his Dad&#39;s cock more, how filthy of him to have these thoughts of the man who helped birth him. As if thinking about him, summoned his father, the door creaks and Urial stops masturbating. He huffs, looking cautiously outside his doorway to see who it was.<br />
<br />
Sure enough, it was his father. Urial watched as he forced the door closed behind him with some force. Urial suddenly gasped, realizing what he had done to himself. His Dad is definitely going to see his boner! How could he hide this while naked and chained? Urial&#39;s Dad now walked towards the dog house, very intentionally. He was also carrying a duffel bag. There was no doubt he was there to speak with Urial. Urial stuck his head out, trying to hide his lower body. <br />
<br />
Urial&#39;s Dad stopped a couple of feet away from the small dog house. His arms were folded and from Urial&#39;s point of view looked massive and domineering. The bag sat next to his feet. &quot;Crawl on out, Urial,&quot; his Dad commanded. <br />
<br />
&quot;But Da-&quot; Urial was interrupted mid-sentance.<br />
<br />
&quot;No But&#39;s, no one else even lives close to us, come on out,&quot; his Dad said sternly. <br />
<br />
Begrudgingly, Urial stepped out slowly. At first he kept his back half inside the doghouse, hopefully that would suffice. His Dad reached down and grabbed the chain on his collar, pulling it. &quot;All the way now,&quot; He grunted. Urial followed the pull and blushed red. Urial&#39;s Dad noticed the boner, only because he had to reach down and grab the chain. His son was a total pervert, sure enough. His Dad dropped the chain and resumed his arm fold. <br />
<br />
&quot;Alright boy, as you probably suspect this is all apart of your punishment for being a horn dog and violating me in my sleep. Even IF I did enjoy it. Now sit&quot;  His Dad made sure to emphasize IF scathingly. Urial sat obediently on his butt, still half erect. He blushed even redder now. &quot;It seems like you&#39;ve been acting out even more since we moved. Now you&#39;re putting your sexual frustration out on me. We both have needs, but I can&#39;t trust you. If you want that kind of treatment to continue, there&#39;s going to be some new rules around here. Do you understand?&quot;<br />
<br />
Urial looked down at his Dad&#39;s boots, embarrassed. It wasn&#39;t actually his actions that brought him into his father&#39;s bed, it was his brother&#39;s. He already admitted to being a pervert, would his Dad believe him? Obviously, he also enjoyed the treatment. &quot;Yes, Dad,&quot; Urial stated. Urial didn&#39;t know why he was still lying, other than that he wanted more of his father&#39;s cock.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good,&quot; He gave Urial a pet on the head, it made him feel happy. &quot;Now then, there are quite a few rules you&#39;re going to follow. We will go over them as they come up. They can also be subject to change based on your own behavior. But for now, you should know that you are going to be playing the role of Dog. Not just for me, but for Matt and Ashton as well. You know how much they wanted a dog after all. It&#39;s also not Dad anymore, it&#39;s Master or sir to you. This will take time to get used to, but there will be punishments if you call me Dad again. Bark once if you understand.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why can&#39;t I just say yes?&quot; Urial questioned. <br />
<br />
&quot;Why can&#39;t I just say yes.....&quot; His Father parroted at him, expecting something else from him.<br />
<br />
Urial added, &quot;Sir?&quot; questioningly<br />
<br />
&quot;From now on you will only speak when commanded to speak. You can only make dog noises like barks, whimpers, and growls. Now Bark, puppy, if you agree to this.&quot;<br />
<br />
Urial blushed some more, he glanced at the house to see Ashton and Matt peeking out from their bedroom window. It made him gasp. They probably knew all about what was in store for him, he wondered if they helped come up with this punishment. Was his father&#39;s cock really worth that? He did lose trust with his Dad, but it&#39;s not like his words were what got him in trouble in this situation. He looked down again, finding that his boner was back full force. Urial let out a soft bark for his father.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good boy.&quot; He got another pet on the head. Urial let out another bark almost involuntarily. It felt really good to have his father&#39;s affection. &quot;Now then, we have a few things for you to use as the new family dog. But, we have ordered more that will come in time....&quot; His Dad picked up the duffel bag, unzipping it. Urial peered inside with his dad. At a glance he saw some colorful tapes, a dog bowl, a blank dog tag, a few dog toys, and one of the old blankets in the house. <br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ll sleep outside in the summers and sleep inside your crate in the winters. Dinner will be with the family, but I expect you to use this dog bowl.&quot; He pulled out a toy and squeeked it in front of Urial. It was one that he remembered picking out with Ashton when they went in town for supplies once. It was a soft plush duck that was shaped just like a rubber duck. He never imagined it would be for him. The toy was then pressed against his mouth. Urial opened it and bit down on the toy softly. This rewarded him with a few more pets. His Dad pulled out another item he hadn&#39;t seen in the bag, a headband with soft brown puppy ears on it. It was from an old Halloween costume Urial had worn once as a kid. <br />
<br />
Urial then tried to stand up as his dad rummaged through the bag, but his father&#39;s foot was sitting on the leash. It tugged under his father who looked up, &quot;ah ah, bad puppy. Puppies stay on all fours.&quot; Urial whined unhappily which got him a gentle tap to the nose. Urial dropped the toy in shock. &quot;Puppies follow rules, remember?&quot; His Dad reminded him. It looks like his Dad really did want him to live the role as dog through and through. <br />
<br />
Urial&#39;s Dad finally pulled out one of the colorful tapes, it was red- one of Urial&#39;s favorite colors. &quot;This is bondage tape, and we&#39;re going to use it as a reminder to stay on all fours&quot;. Urial&#39;s back legs were grabbed, which forced him from his kneeling position to on his hands and knees. His Dad pushed on something around his legs and up to his knees one at a time. Urial looked down to realize they were the knee pads with soft padding. There was velcro on the outside where it touched the floor. His Dad pulled out two plastic shells that went under his knees, &quot;for outside on harder surfaces&quot; he explained. Urial&#39;s feet where then pulled up to be next to his buttock, the tape was unfurled and he was promptly taped around him. Weaving him to be stuck on his padded knees. &quot;Be a good boy, and we won&#39;t have to do the same to your hands.&quot; His father now threatened. <br />
<br />
&quot;Now for the last part of today.&quot; He grabbed the bag and patted Urial&#39;s rear end, inspecting his handiwork before commanding, &quot;Turn around and face me, pup,&quot; He holds the dog tag out, it doesn&#39;t have a name on the front. Urial&#39;s Dad turns it around and shows the back with his Dad&#39;s name and contact info: Keith Inderson 33089 Cherry St. &quot;Now, Urial isn&#39;t a fitting name for a pup such as yourself anymore. That was your human name, after all. We&#39;ll figure out a name in time. For now, it&#39;s just &#39;puppy&#39; just like how I am master&quot; Keith explained. This made Urial whine again, this wasn&#39;t met with another tap on the nose, but some soft pets and a short hug. This made Puppy blush more. &quot;I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll love your new name, I promise.&quot;</p>
