<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You pant harshly, still trying to wrap your head around what just happened. The -- surely compelled -- enjoyment of sucking your &quot;mistress&quot; off, and the resulting transformation. You gag at the memory of her cock in your mouth, while at the same time your traitorous tongue is licking your lips to get more of those delicious juices.<br />
<br />
Your disgust and humiliation clash against that lingering sense of fulfillment from having pleased your owner -- never mind the afterglow. More than anything, perhaps, you feel <i>vulnerable</i> -- your now effeminate body exposed to Junia and your fellow slaves, unable to hide anything from them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hm, look at you, Coral; fur, breasts, hips -- you&#39;ve changed so much from just one load of my cum! A good beginning to embracing your true self.&quot; You flinch from Mistress&#39; words -- she has to be just saying that, triyng to mess with you. She laughs.<br />
<br />
&quot;In denial? Well, that&#39;s why I bought you, after all -- for that rush of power of breaking down your defenses, <i>forcing</i> you to embrace the lustful, furry slut you humans were meant to be.&quot;<br />
<br />
You can see her half-flaccid shaft jerk and swell a little at this, and you bite your lip. The fluttering is back -- mostly in your lower stomach. Fear and degradation, mixing into an alien arousal at the thought of being this beast&#39;s plaything.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know,&quot; she continues, feigning unawareness, though her smirk says otherwise, &quot;which body parts change indicate your acceptance of what you are -- genitals and your head are often the first or last things to change, depending on your level of resistance.&quot;<br />
<br />
She nods to the human-headed girl. &quot;As you can see. Agate has clung tenaciously both to her manhood and her humanity, refusing to submit in her heart. But she can&#39;t deny herself forever -- she <i>is</i> a submissive, needy pet; and soon that truth will claim her utterly, with her cock and human brain going the way of her balls.&quot; The witch turns back to you as Agate clenches her fists and hangs her incongrous head. &quot;So I wonder, how long will it be before you break and accept your destiny?&quot;<br />
<br />
You also curl your fingers together, though you&#39;re currently too exhausted -- and dispirited -- to make true fists. There&#39;s no way that this is your destiny, your &quot;true self.&quot; Is there? Damn it, you can&#39;t think right now!<br />
<br />
&quot;No answer? That&#39;s fine -- your body will answer for you.&quot; She runs a hand down her stomach, her erection swelling ever larger, even the knot beginning to engorge. &quot;It looks like you left your job unfinished -- come clean me up.&quot;<br />
<br />
Your mouth opens, but before you can protest, you&#39;re already moving back into position, stepping forward and kneeling down between her spread legs. And, true to her words, your penis is also stiffening despite the ache in it. Entering the cloud of her musk is too much for you to resist getting hard -- at least when you&#39;re under her compulsion.<br />
<br />
You determine to do this as swiftly as possible, but that intention skews slightly once your tongue meets her cock again. She just tastes <i>so good.</i> You do move quickly, but it&#39;s because you&#39;re anxious to lap up that wonderful seed as fast as possible. You hesitate when it comes to licking off the drying cum on her fur. But it&#39;s only her ballsack that is matted, and the satin there isn&#39;t <i>too</i> bad, just a really odd texture on your tongue, and fortunately no hair comes lose.<br />
<br />
You finish by licking her shaft <i>again</i> -- cleaning off the pre that&#39;s leaked out in response to your tongue bath. You even find yourself suckling a bit on the tip again, hating yourself, but justifying it as wanting to preempt another overflow. Finally you look up, flushed and sick to your stomach. And yearning for her approval.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is that good... Mistress?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It will do.&quot; She pets your head, and you grit your teeth, not wanting to admit how good it feels. &quot;Considering you still have a human tongue. Oh, yes; I should set a few rules for you. You are not to leave the grounds unless accompanied by me. No masturbation. No playing with yourself or others. And, of course, no clothes.&quot;<br />
<br />
A chill pierces you. She just ordered you not to leave. With her obedience spell in place... that seriously impedes your escape plans. Ends them, in fact -- unless you can bring yourself to resist the magic. With her dominant cock and peerless balls in your face, that seems <i>very</i> unlikely.<br />
<br />
&quot;And now you are dismissed. All of you.&quot;<br />
<br />
With a grunt, you get back on your feet, your gaze lingering on her large, erect member. <i>Don&#39;t look at it!</i> you chide yourself. It&#39;s a struggle; a wave of desire sweeps through you, together with a delicious tingling. For a moment you&#39;re afraid that you&#39;re changing again -- after all, you have ingested more of her fluids. But, apparently, it isn&#39;t enough to actually change you. Just... get you high.<br />
<br />
You shake your head, trying to push the feeling and the memories of the past fifteen minutes away; and turn to the other two slaves. Immediately you are assaulted by Moonstone, who bounces up and takes your hands, her eyes alight (and her cock half-hard -- you&#39;re certain you smell the remains of sex on her, though with Junia&#39;s smell still clogging your senses it&#39;s hard to tell).<br />
<br />
&quot;That was your first blowjob?&quot; You nod, not at all feeling her smile or her happy tone. &quot;You did a good job! You should be proud! And you already look so cute.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ugh.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh Coral.&quot; She pulls you into a hug, making you gasp a bit as her ample bosom pushes up against your own newly-formed mammaries. Yet another thing you&#39;d rather forget. Even if the feel of her softly-furred tits, the subtle grinding of her hard nipples on your own... is too good to ignore. But you stand there, hands balled, and refuse to return the hug. She sighs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on, let&#39;s go to our room and play or something.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But Mistress said I couldn&#39;t --&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A board game, silly!&quot; She giggles as she takes your hand and begins pulling you along again. &quot;For someone who doesn&#39;t want to be a sex pet, you sure have a one-track mind.&quot;~<br />
<br />
You say nothing to that, just following her up the stairs. Agate falls in behind you. She&#39;s silent until you&#39;re out of earshot of Junia, then she says, bitterly,<br />
<br />
&quot;You know, Moon, you&#39;re really oblivious.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And you&#39;re in denial, like Mistress said!&quot; Moonstone shoots back. You blink, not expecting such sharpness from the hitherto happy vixen. Although it&#39;s more like exasperation than anger, her ears are tilted back and her fur bristles a little. &quot;Why are you still resisting? It&#39;s been nearly a year, and you&#39;re still not complete! You love having Mistress&#39; cock shoved in you! Why are you so sulky all the time?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I...&quot; Agate also seems taken slightly aback by the outburst, but then she snaps, &quot;I don&#39;t <i>want</i> to be a vixen!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well why not!?&quot;<br />
<br />
Again, the human-headed fox seems at a loss for words. The three of you stop at the doorway to the pets&#39; room.<br />
<br />
&quot;It... it&#39;s not who I&#39;m meant to be.&quot; She sighs, frustrated. &quot;Look, Moon --&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes it is!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No it&#39;s not! LOOK.&quot; She pauses, trying to compose herself. &quot;This conversation always goes the same way. I&#39;ve accepted that you&#39;re happy like this. Good for you. I still want my life back, damn it! I don&#39;t --&quot; She chokes, blushing, her ears drooping. &quot;No matter how good it feels,&quot; she resumes in a much more subdued voice. &quot;I don&#39;t want this. I want <i>more</i> than just to be someone&#39;s toy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There <i>isn&#39;t</i> anything more than being happy,&quot; Moonstone insists, though in a more sympathetic tone. &quot;Seriously Agate, if you just gave in and enjoy it --&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d lose myself.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;More like find yourself!&quot; And the exasperation is back. Moonstone huffs. &quot;But whatever. Be miserable if you want. But don&#39;t try to drag Coral down too! I&#39;m trying to help her adjust!&quot;<br />
<br />
You look between them, something clicking in your brain. Moonstone is standing stiff, her tail arched, her mouth hanging open, her ears even flatter. Agate has shrunk back, her tail pressed to her leg, tip dragging on the floor; her vulpine ears folded down along her human head. You recognise the postures, and you find it both fascinating and horrifying to see people -- former humans -- display the body language of foxes. The transformation is obviously more than skin-deep.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, okay,&quot; Agate mutters. &quot;I&#39;m just saying... don&#39;t push him too hard.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;<i>Her,</i>&quot; Moonstone corrects firmly. &quot;Regardless of that silliness between her legs <i>now,</i> Coral&#39;s a vixen. Just like you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Agate sighs in surrender. &quot;Sure, Moon. I&#39;ll try and remember.&quot;<br />
<br />
~ ~ ~ ~ ~<br />
<br />
The rest of the day passes by with you settling into a kind of numbness. Agate joins Moonstone in a board game as if nothing happened; but you just sit against the wall, watching listlessly. After about an hour Moonstone announces that it&#39;s time to prepare dinner. As promised, you help her in the kitchen; cutting vegetables like an automaton.<br />
<br />
You help her serve Junia at the dining room table, then eat your own meal in the kitchen, Agate coming down to join you. You eat off a cloth spread on the floor -- &quot;like a picnic,&quot; Moonstone points out, though you don&#39;t appreciate the similarly. You have plates and silverware like normal, but have to drink out of bowls (Moonstone and Agate have their own special bowls, enamelled with their names). Watching Moonstone lap up her water renews your sick fascination, and the vague dread of your future that you don&#39;t want to acknowledge.<br />
<br />
Afterwards, you return to the pet room. Lost in running from your thoughts, you lose track of time and what the others are doing. You&#39;re barely aware of the fading day, of Moonstone lighting lamps. She offers to bring you up &quot;a bit of supper,&quot; but you shake your head, having had barely any appetite at dinner.<br />
<br />
You do perk up though when your stomach flutters in anticipation. &quot;Huh?&quot; The reason why, to your dismay, seems to be the approach of your Mistress. The witch vixen steps into the pet room, where the three of you are gathered -- you slumped against the wall, Agate reading in her pet bed and Moon... masturbating in hers. You stare for a moment, wondering how you missed that.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good evening, girls,&quot; she greets, rather sincerely. Your eyes fix on her, and you feel yourself heating up. She&#39;s got her robe on, but it&#39;s open at the front, showing off her mountainous breasts and an inch of her cock thrusting from her sheath.<br />
<br />
&quot;Evening, Mistress!&quot; Moon chirps back. Her hand pauses on her cock, but she doesn&#39;t remove it.<br />
<br />
&quot;How are you doing?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine! Well...&quot; She looks at you. &quot;As fine as can be expected?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mmhm.&quot; Junia seems to be amused. &quot;Moonstone, I want you to warm my bed tonight. Coral, you can sleep in Moon&#39;s bed.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yeah!&quot; Moonstone jumps out of the bed like she&#39;s propelled by a spring, tail wagging furiously, self-pleasure forgotten. She bounces over to Junia, rubbing herself eagerly against the witch. Junia strokes down her back and looks over her shoulder.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good night, you two.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, good night!&quot; Moonstone chimes in.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good night... Mistress,&quot; Agate responds. You bite your lip, and manage to restrain the urge to join in. Junia gives you a knowing smirk, then picks up the giggling Moonstone and carries her away.<br />
<br />
Agate goes back to reading for a bit, but then she sets the book aside and stands up. &quot;I&#39;m putting out the lamps. I suggest you come curl up in the bed; it&#39;ll be more comfortable. Even if the smell does drive you a bit crazy.&quot; She sighs, and stretches. &quot;That&#39;s the point of forbidding us to masturbate -- to break us. The more wound up we are, the less we can resist <i>her</i>. It works too.&quot;<br />
<br />
You grunt, but do as she suggests. Despite looking like a pet bed, it actually seems to have a proper mattress. Although it is too small -- especially since, despite your loss of height and mass, you&#39;re still bigger than Moonstone. But it&#39;s obviously designed to &quot;curl up&quot; in, encouraging a more animalistic sleeping posture. Which your body has not quite adjusted to yet, though you are comfortable sleeping on your side with your legs pulled up as the shape of the bed demands.<br />
<br />
However, in a small act of rebellion, you just stretch out, letting your legs dangle over the edge of the bed. Soon the room goes dark, save for moonlight coming in the windows. Agate returns to her bed, noticing your position.<br />
<br />
&quot;Heh.&quot;<br />
<br />
She does not say anything else for several minutes, occupied with following her own advice, curling up and getting comfortable. Then, &quot;What&#39;s your name? Your <i>real</i> name.&quot;<br />
<br />
You turn your head so that you&#39;re facing her in the darkness. &quot;Kenneth. Kenneth Bryan. My friends call me Ken; you might as well too. What about you?&quot;<br />
<br />
There&#39;s a minute of silence. &quot;Frank. I think. Nobody&#39;s called me that in months, and even if my head hasn&#39;t transformed yet, Mistress&#39; magic is messing with my brain. Honestly I barely even remember that I was a man any more.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Urgh.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah...&quot; Another few minutes of silence. Then a defeated sigh. &quot;Moonstone is right, you know. Resisting this is pointless. I don&#39;t even have the willpower to disobey her rules, and if I can&#39;t leave the property, how the fuck can I escape? At this point, what would I do if I did? I&#39;m a freak. I may as well let her finish me off.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t say that.&quot; Your response is automatic, hating to hear someone give up. And not wanting to think that perhaps she <i>is</i> right. &quot;Maybe... maybe there&#39;s a way to change back?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe there is.&quot; You&#39;re actually surprised at this agreement, but she quickly snuffs out the hope she&#39;s sparked. &quot;We&#39;re addicted to her cum, which fuels the transformation. If we got away from it, maybe we&#39;d go back to our old selves. But... I&#39;m too far gone, Ken. How would I survive while turning back? How would I cope with the withdrawal? I&#39;m not kidding -- it&#39;s either a chemical or a magical addiction to their fluids, maybe both.&quot;<br />
<br />
The questions hang in the air. After a minute she resumes. &quot;And at the end of the day... I no longer really <I>want</i> to escape. I do... <i>enjoy</i> it when Mistress takes me. Orally, mostly, though she has some things that simulate vaginal penetration to help &#39;train&#39; me. And, God damn it Kenneth, I <i>love</i> it.&quot; Her voice breaks a bit. &quot;I&#39;ve even come to love this damn slut body she&#39;s given me. I... I just <i>can&#39;t</i> leave now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But, but earlier! You said you wanted --&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know what I said! And I do want to go back to my old life. But it&#39;s not <i>possible,</i> Ken! And even if it were...&quot; She whimpers. &quot;I want Mistress&#39; cock <i>more</i>. God Ken, it&#39;s so <i>thick...</i> sorry.&quot; She clears her throat. &quot;See? I&#39;ve lost. I may as well stop struggling and let her claim me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You can&#39;t give up hope,&quot; you argue. &quot;I&#39;m a hunter, I know my way around a forest. Now that I&#39;m aware of the danger, I&#39;m sure I can slip past their patrols. And I can take you with me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There <i>is</i> no hope. Not for me, anyway.&quot; A pause. &quot;But... maybe there is for you. You could still pass for human, even if you don&#39;t change back. So maybe, with the devil&#39;s luck, you could evade the guards and get through the barrier. None of us knows how <i>that</i> works; humans come in, they don&#39;t go out. So who knows? But... if you want to think you can escape, I&#39;m not going to tell you that you can&#39;t. But...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But?&quot; you prompt as the silence begins to stretch into minutes.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re going to have to be strong. To break Mistress&#39; slave enchantment, for starters. And you&#39;ve already tasted her cum, so you&#39;re already hooked on that too. Then you&#39;ll have to ignore Moonstone&#39;s attempts to get you to &#39;enjoy yourself.&#39; And...&quot; You can practically hear her grimace. &quot;I&#39;m not going to be myself much longer, Ken. Mistress will fuck me again in a day or two, and then I&#39;ll be... well, fucked.&quot;<br />
<br />
Her laugh is short and bittersweet. &quot;I&#39;m kind of looking forward to it, you know? To finally stop torturing myself, to just let go and be a good slut who only thinks about sex and pleasing Mistress. But I&#39;m sorry to... leave you. Once I break, I suppose I&#39;ll be just like Moon, and try to get you to give in too. You&#39;ll be on your own in a house of horny foxes.&quot;<br />
<br />
<i>Foxes...</i> &quot;What about the horse lady? Chestnut...?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, she&#39;s as bad as Moonstone. She&#39;s fucking <i>proud</i> to trot around naked with a carriage behind her, sticking out her breasts to be admired. And she&#39;s as cock-hungry as any of us. You know that she gets her daily dose of cum, right? When Moon doesn&#39;t have a dick -- and sometimes when she does -- Mistress gives her a &#39;treat&#39; herself. Plus her weekly rutting by a stallion. God... I watched her take that big horse dick once. Mistress had to restrain me from presenting myself to him.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;...Oh...&quot; You shiver. And wonder what it was like.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah... Sorry for being such a downer. I guess. I&#39;ve never been one to sugarcoat things. And if you&#39;re thinking of escaping, you need to know what you&#39;re up against. Otherwise, you may as well submit like Moon and me, and get comfortable with being Mistress&#39; plaything.&quot; She huffs out another bitter laugh. &quot;Good night, Ken.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good night... Frank?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just... call me Agate, Ken. She&#39;s all that&#39;s going to be left, soon.&quot;<br />
<br />
Well, that&#39;s encouraging. Not. Frank -- or Agate -- says nothing more; you&#39;re not sure if she&#39;s fallen asleep, or lying awake like you. The thoughts you&#39;ve been keeping away since you... serviced... Junia now come circling in, settling on you like buzzards. Everything starts to replay, from your auction, to the taste of Junia&#39;s cock, to finding you have breasts, to the various things Moonstone, Agate and Chestnut have told you.<br />
<br />
Eventually everything jumbles together, and your recollections of the horrible day begin to shift into nightmares as exhaustion wins out.</p>
