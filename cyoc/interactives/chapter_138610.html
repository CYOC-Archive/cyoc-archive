<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;...an elegant warrioress, and a wife if I do say so myself.&quot; The large lizard said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Warrioress? Wait.... wife?! What does he mean by...&quot; You thought to yourself then looked down again and your cheeks blushed a bright red.<br />
<br />
You had wide womanly hips, a plump and juicy rear, two large breasts that were in the D cup range, and finally a moist slit between your legs. &quot;H-How the hell didn’t I noticed this before?!&quot; You screamed at yourself mentally.<br />
<br />
The large lizard chuckled and said,&quot;Aw, I love it when you women get all flustered from flattery.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What n-no I...&quot; You began then listened to your voice and blushed even deeper and thought,&quot;Oh fuck, I really am female aren’t I?&quot;<br />
<br />
The large lizard then placed his hand on your shoulder and said,&quot;And as leader of the tribe, I am happy to say that you’re all mine, beautiful.&quot;<br />
<br />
You felt like something in your snapped at this moment, and you ended up  jabbing the lizard right in the stomach and he stumbled back, and dropped to his knees to catch his breath.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the hell do you think I am?! You can’t just claim me like some bitch in the wild!&quot; You growled <br />
<br />
The lizard coughed then stood up, and laughed as he held his stomach. &quot;Heh, so you have a settlement then? Tell me then, where is it at?&quot; He asked<br />
<br />
You paused and blinked twice then blushed awkwardly and muttered,&quot;I-I.... ummm....&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So you are wild then, just as you described, and with little to no knowledge on tribal code it seems,&quot; The large lizard said.<br />
<br />
A few other male warrior looked to each other and chuckled a bit at this. You looked back at them, covered your breasts, and gave them a slight hiss in disgust as you heard this. The large male then walked up to you again and said,&quot;So tell me, would one as brave and strong as you are not have any pride of her own? Would you journey across the lands completely nude only to get killed or raped by someone, or maybe something else?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I-I...&quot; You stammered again then growled,&quot;I am not some damsel your asshole!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know, and you know what? I like women who play hard-to-get like you do.&quot; The lizard exclaimed <br />
<br />
Your jaw dropped, no matter how many times you shot this asshole down he seems to get back up no matter what. You wanted to castrate him the second that you could, but for some reason a part of you refused. You didn’t know why this was or what this man’s words were doing to you, but you almost felt... passionate? You weren’t sure what this was, but as much as you hated to admit it he had a point.<br />
<br />
You clenched your fist about to give this guy another taste of your fist, but you for some reason couldn’t. You just growled and  crossed your arms over your breasts. &quot;Fine! But if you try anything with me without my consent then you’re dead.&quot; You hissed<br />
<br />
The lizard gave you a wide toothy grin and replied,&quot;It wouldn’t be a thrill any other way. For future reference, my name is Zarsh, but you may call me your husband.&quot;<br />
<br />
You rolled your eyes at this and walked past him, and as you did you replied,&quot;I don’t much have a name, okay? But frankly I don’t care, Zarsh.&quot;<br />
<br />
You glared at Zarsh and his dark brown scales as you walked by, and he smiled and said,&quot;Guess I can call you whatever I want then. Talk to one of our... other women if you don’t like being so nude. Us guys certainly don’t mind seeing a couple of bouncing bloomers all exposed like that.&quot;<br />
<br />
You looked down at yourself and blushed then growled at yourself and facepalmed. &quot;Great, now I&#39;m going to be living in a shit hole with a bunch of perverted assholes too.&quot; You thought to yourself as you looked down at the water and saw yourself.<br />
<br />
You passed the few males who  were watching the fight and their eyes were staring right at your tits. You growled at one of them who chuckled a bit, and he stumbled over onto his rear. You paused, but smiled a bit knowing that you scared one of the dominant males here shitless as you walked by.<br />
<br />
You then approached one of the tents, and a female with a scale tint slightly lighter than yours. She had a nervous look on her face and she let out a small whine as you approached her. You could just tell she was expecting you to flip your shit, but instead you took a deep breath and sighed in order to regain a bit of your composure.<br />
<br />
&quot;H-Hey, Uh.... you wouldn’t happen to have anything to cover my uh.... private areas, would you?&quot; You asked the woman in the calmest tone that you could.<br />
<br />
She blinked twice then noticed the stressed out look on your face, and nodded to you. &quot;I should have enough, I think. At least to cover your breasts, Uh... Mrs. Zarsh,&quot; She exclaimed. You let out a slight hiss of disgust as you heard this, and the woman seemed to let out a small whine of fear at this as you entered into, what you assumed was her home. <br />
<br />
Once you were inside and saw more than the woman’s head, you noticed she had a very noticeable bulge in her stomach, and a pair of swollen breasts one cup size smaller than yours. &quot;A-Are you pregnant?&quot; You asked her as she began digging through a wooden chest. <br />
<br />
The woman placed a hand on her stomach, and she gave you a small nod and continued scrounging. You could hear the voices of the men outside.<br />
<br />
&quot;Zarsh, you finally found one huh? Her tits are huge!&quot; One exclaimed <br />
<br />
&quot;I wouldn’t stare for too long,&quot; Another one whimpered,&quot;She’s got a lot of fight in her.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Coward,&quot; A third hissed then you heard a smack, and the second lizard hissed. &quot;You honestly fell back to a woman? A woman?! Pull yourself together, your eggs need a capable father!&quot; The third one growled.<br />
<br />
It was obvious who the second lizard was from the context, but then a fourth voice appeared and said,&quot;I wouldn’t blame him, seriously until I saw those knockers and that eggmaker I thought we were getting another male, but no. I’m actually surprised she fought!&quot;<br />
<br />
You then heard Zarsh&#39;s voice enter the scene. &quot;Heh, she punched hard, harder than most of you when I tested you. That woman ain’t no pawn, if she’s this strong she&#39;s gonna climb up to the top real fast.&quot; Zarsh exclaimed <br />
<br />
&quot;Just think of your offspring too! If this is how she is then the females will at least he like her, and imagine just how powerful the males will be!&quot; The fourth added<br />
<br />
&quot;If she lets me,&quot; Zarsh added, and then there was a pause.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean?&quot; The third voice asked<br />
<br />
&quot;I mean that she isn’t like any other woman I&#39;ve seen. If she’s like this in the tent well... heh, I&#39;m not so sure I&#39;ll be on top if ever, unless she goes into heat that is.&quot; Zarsh commented<br />
<br />
Your focus was then suddenly interrupted by the woman you were with as she wrapped a large hide around your waist. &quot;Whoa, warn me before you do something like that?!&quot; You shouted then the woman paused and whined,&quot;Sorry sorry, I-I didn’t mean to... I-I....&quot;<br />
<br />
You noticed the worried look in her eyes and you sighed and said,&quot;It’s okay.... I won’t hurt you. I&#39;m not exactly like them as one could guess.&quot;<br />
<br />
The woman paused then she nodded to you slowly and said,&quot;O-Oh, okay then...Mrs. Zarsh.&quot;<br />
<br />
You looked around now and noticed one large tanned hide on the ground and another on top that acted as a blanket. However besides that there really wasn’t much in the tent aside from the chest the woman was digging through.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, Uh.... you got a name?&quot; You asked <br />
<br />
The woman nodded to you and replied,&quot;Voila, my husband is Culnix.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Who’s he?&quot; You replied <br />
<br />
&quot;The one who..... you s-scared,&quot; Voila replied in a rather timid manner.<br />
<br />
You blushed, feeling embarrassed and a bit awkward now that you knew this. &quot;O-Oh,&quot; You began,&quot;Sorry, I didn’t know, you can continue if you feel like you can.&quot;<br />
<br />
Voila nodded to you then she produced a bone needle and thread from the chest and started weaving a thick bear hide around your waist like a skirt almost. &quot;I can’t believe anything that just happened a few minutes ago.&quot; You commented<br />
<br />
&quot;W-Well... I... don’t really know what to say to help you. B-But at least a v-valiant husband,&quot; Voila said.<br />
<br />
You crossed your arms and scowled,&quot;Before this I wasn’t planning on having a husband in the first place.&quot; You then paused and thought,&quot;I also wasn’t planning to be able to get pregnant, feel gravid, and these breasts are weighing me down.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It’s not so bad, you should be happy that you have a home, and food and someone to hunt for it. Plus, you can have kids now, and enjoy every night you mate with...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Please... just.... stop, okay? I don’t want to hear anymore.&quot; You interrupted, and Voila paused and just nodded to you as she now wrapped a cloth around your chest, and over your breasts.<br />
<br />
You could feel the padding and warm fur of the two hides. You&#39;d be lying if you didn’t at least enjoy something that held your breasts and made them feel comfortable on your body. <br />
<br />
Voila continued sewing the hide together in the back, and tied tied it off in the end. &quot;Is that good?&quot; She asked you and you paused and looked down at yourself.<br />
<br />
Both hides were black in color with course fur, and they felt thick. You were a bit humiliated as your tail lifted up the rear of your skirt too, but you couldn’t do much about that, nor could you do anything about the soft breeze that caressed your thighs and ass.<br />
<br />
You gave Voila a nod of approval and said,&quot;Voila, thank you, and try to gain some confidence, alright? Oh, and uh.... for what it’s worth, congrats on the eggs.&quot; Voila nodded to you at this and you gave her a warm smile as you left the tent.<br />
<br />
Once you were outside you looked around and saw the men all huddled around the a bonfire. You rolled your eyes at this then turned to walk away when you bumped right into your &quot;lovely&quot; new husband, Zarsh.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why hello again, my lovely wife.&quot; He said grinning at you with all of his teeth.<br />
<br />
You groaned and facepalmed at this and replied,&quot;What do you want? If it’s what I think you’re going to say then forget it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Aww, can’t a man just take his own wife around the tribe, and show her everything there is to offer?&quot; He exclaimed <br />
<br />
&quot;There’s six tents, a large fire, and water all around us. Seriously what more is there to see?&quot; You replied then looked up into his eyes and your guard dropped. Something about this guy was definitely getting to you, but you couldn’t quite put your talon on it.<br />
<br />
Zarsh chuckled and said,&quot;Well, I was just going to go out and put you through a test. Think of it as an initiation, but you’re really the first woman to ever participate in it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, let me guess, if I lose then you&#39;ll kick me out or kill me?&quot; You replied <br />
<br />
Zarsh shook his head and said,&quot;Usually we&#39;d go to a sacred ground, where all men who failed became female and wives at the mercy of their new husbands. However, since you’re already my wife I have something better to wager.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And what would that be?&quot; You asked<br />
<br />
&quot;If I win then you&#39;ll open yourself up to me, both figuratively,&quot; Zarsh began then suddenly two large cocks, each roughy 8 inches in length exploded out from a sheath underneath his loincloth,&quot;and literally.&quot; Zarsh licked his lips at this, and you felt a rush of feelings enter your body all at once as a musk invaded your nostrils and mouth as you stared shocked. You felt a warm tingling sensation from between your legs, and your nipples felt erect. &quot;Is this.... am I getting turned on?&quot; You thought to yourself and gulped at the realization that you were actually coming onto this guy.<br />
<br />
Zarsh then chuckled and said,&quot;Perfect, your opponent is me, and for our challenge....&quot;</p>
