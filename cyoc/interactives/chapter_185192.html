<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">He opened the door to see the barmaid herself. She slipped into the room without saying anything. She held something out to Matthew. He saw it was a blue drink. “Drink this” <br />
<br />
Matthew accepted the drink. For a moment he thought about what the girl had said earlier, about needing to trust whoever swapped with you. He had been offered a blue drink that meant that he would have no say in what got swapped. He would have no say with whom he swapped with either. <br />
<br />
Hell! He had come here wanting to do a swap. Now was his opportunity. Without thinking further he downed the contents of the glass. It actually tasted nice. A bit sweet but very drinkable. It was like a fruit juice.<br />
<br />
“So who do I swap with?”<br />
<br />
“Me of course” The barmaid replied. Almost instantly her hand came across the space between them and covered his face. Her hands wrapped around his head and fondled his hair, his ears and his chin. She then released him. He looked at her. Already she was changing. Her hair was shrinking into her head. “Don’t you want to watch?” <br />
<br />
Matthew had forgotten about the full-length mirror. He turned around to watch the final moments of his face changing. Looking back at him was the goth girl on top of his body and shoulders. He now had jet black hair with a very straight fringe that came down to his shoulders. He also now had a heavily made up face with very dark eye shadow, bright red lips and a nose ring. Funny how he had barely noticed the girls nose ring earlier. He also had large hoop earrings in his ears.<br />
<br />
“Oh Wow!. This is amazing”<br />
<br />
He noticed the girl was undressing. She had no hesitation pulling off her dress and the bra she had been wearing. She had a big tattoo of a skull within a wreath of roses on her flat stomach. She also had a rather intricate belly button ring which coincided with the mouth of the skull. <br />
<br />
“Well don’t just stand there! Get those clothes off!” she commanded<br />
<br />
Matthew began undressing. The girl had by now sat down on the bench and was unstrapping the long boots she had been wearing. Matthew hadn’t noticed earlier but they had large platform heels which partially explained why the girl was so tall.<br />
<br />
Matthew was soon down to his boxer shorts and fully displaying his body. He worked out regularly and was proud of his flat stomach.<br />
<br />
“Hmm. Not bad” the girl uttered. By now she had removed the boots and was clad only in fishnet stockings and black panties. “Let’s make this complete” Once more she reached for Matthew. She caressed his throat. Then her hands fluttered down his arms gently following his contours. She brushed down one side of each arm then up the other. Her hands then moved to Matthews torso she rubbed him gently all over. Matthew turned to the mirror and watched as his arms changed and became covered in tattoos. The girl seemed to like a mix of roses and skulls. As soon as his arms had changed his torso began to alter. Breasts began to bud out of his chest as he lost muscle definition. He watched as the big tattoo developed on his tummy. Soon his chest was sporting a copy of the girls C-cups. No - he looked at her. They were not a copy. She now had a flat muscular torso.<br />
<br />
By this time the girl was rubbing his legs. Like his arms she worked her way down the front of his right leg then up the back before moving across to his left leg. She had few tattoos on her legs just a small rose on each shin. Matthew went to comment on this “Not so many tattoos on your legs” he was very aware but not surprised by the feminine voice that came out of his mouth. <br />
<br />
“I have plans” the girl replied. She now had Matthew&#39;s voice. It sounded so deep coming from someone else.<br />
<br />
She had left his crotch for last but now after his legs had changed she began to fondle his backside. Matthew could literally feel his bottom ballooning out. <br />
<br />
“Ready for the grand finale” the deep voice said as her hands reached inside his boxer shorts and she began to fondle his very erect penis. It was amazing the feeling as it stayed turgid as it quickly shrank. Soon she had nothing left to fondle. Of course by then the barmaid was no longer a she. He had stood up and appeared to tower over Matthew. “Your name is Sabrina by the way. Sabrina Lockwood. I just need to check for anywhere I missed”<br />
<br />
“My hands” Mathew told him in her sweet high voice. He held out his/her still masculine hands. The former girl took them and caressed them thoroughly. Soon they were 100% the hands of a goth girl. He made Matthew turn around inspecting him all over, touching Matthew in areas he had missed. <br />
<br />
“Hurry and get dressed. You need to get back to the bar” he told Matthew. By now he had removed the designer torn fishnet stockings and black panties and held them out to Matthew. Matthew accepted them and slid them onto his legs. He had noticed he now had a shaved pussy with yet another rose tattoo surrounding it. Where as all her other tattoos were just black ink on her pale skin, on her groin tattoo the rose was vivid red. Matthew couldn’t help but think it must have hurt.<br />
<br />
The real Sabrina (Was that her real name?) helped Matthew dress. It took forever to lace up the platform boots. Getting the bra put on was actually a relief. Matthew’s new breasts had felt very heavy. When he was satisfied Sabrina told Matthew. “Head back to the bar and relieve Jake. Remember he doesn&#39;t know about this swap. Don&#39;t let on, I can&#39;t afford to loose my job. I’ll join you once he has gone and show you what to do” He literally pushed Matthew out the door. Matthew felt very unsteady as she surveyed the room, never having worn platform boots before.</p>
