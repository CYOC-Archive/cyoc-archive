<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Elsewhere on that eventful night, while Kenzia and Alisariah were busy in the dreams of the glamoured  humans who started too close to the elven glade, Maraya was up late into the night, the moon rose full and high above the canopies. The sea elf queen sat in her meditation pool, her legs folded as the placid water gently rippled with each breath, each slow rise and fall of her chest. She cooed blissfully as she felt two hands cradling her bosom from behind her. <br />
<br />
“Still awake, my lady?” Hannasil purred in her fin-shaped ear. “The rest of our kin are fast asleep already.”<br />
<br />
“Don’t I know it!” Maraya chirped. “It seems like our reporter is one hell of a night owl. It’s nearly the middle of the night and she’s still awake. I’m just holding out until she dreams, so I can say hello.” <br />
<br />
“But of course my lady, it won’t be much longer I bet. If I may, I can’t wait to meet my fellow handmaiden!” As they conversed, she sensually massaged her queen’s body from the shoulders and working lower. “Is there anything else I can do to ease your stress while you wait, my liege?”<br />
<br />
“A kiss would do…” Maraya purred as she reclined her head back and let her maiden coax her into a state of complete relaxation.<br />
<br />
———————<br />
Charlotte wiped her tired and bloodshot eyes as she sat hunched at her kitchen counter over her laptop’s keyboard. On her screen was the complete draught of tomorrow night’s top story on the local evening news. At her channel’s tiny newsroom and shoestring budget, she had to wear a lot of hats. Reporter, storywriter, occasional editor, and even part time tech support line, all were tasks she had to juggle on the weekly, sometimes even daily when things were out of hand.<br />
<br />
It was clearly getting to her, especially this late into the night, or morning as the case may be. She yawned loud and drawn out as she hit the enter key, sending an email off to her boss scheduled to reach his desk in the morning. She rose to her weary feet and wiped her bleary eyes, tucking her brunette hair behind her ear as she trudged to a quick cold shower and toothbrushing, all so she could make ready to crash into her bed and get up on a rare late weekend.<br />
<br />
————<br />
Then, she woke up to unexpectedly serene surroundings. She stared up at the moon and stars on a cloudless, beautiful spring night. She felt weightless, floating on a mirror-reflective plane of water with nothing else visible in any direction. <br />
<br />
Accepting that this was just a welcome dream, she craned her head side by side before allowing herself to drift and float just above the surface, her sweatpants and sleeping shirts getting drenched was something she hardly even registered.<br />
<br />
“That hits the spot, eh? Long week?” Maraya’s voice echoed through the night air, seemingly sourceless, but seemingly rising impossibly up out of the water itself.<br />
<br />
“A long couple of years, more like it. Mom dying…” she choked up. “And work and rent all on top of that too.” Charlotte sighed as she started to pour her heart out to the still sourceless voice.<br />
<br />
“My condolences friend, human society can be cruelest to those already on the back foot.”<br />
<br />
“Tell me about it, the things that show up on the news sometimes….” She trailed off. “Wait, ‘human society’? That sounds mighty… distant of you, weird voice.”<br />
<br />
“Fair, that did come off a bit haughty, but it’s not untrue. I’ve seen another way to live, apart from how the humans do things. I’m living and loving every minute of it, and I never want to go back.” <br />
<br />
Just then, Charlotte gasped as the most beautiful woman she’d seen, sporting azure skin and crimson hair, wearing nothing but a pearl circlet on her brow rose out of the water beside her. <br />
<br />
“Ta-dah!” Maraya cheered with a flourishing show-business bow and a flirtatious wink to the dreaming human. <br />
<br />
Charlotte gulped. She’d been certain all her life she was nothing but straight as an arrow, but this tall, shiny, regal looking fish-elf was something else entirely. She felt a powerful heat flush through her body as her pale cheeks went bright red. “W-who are you?”<br />
<br />
<br />
“Queen Maraya, sovereign of the five seas of Micara stands before you. Oh, you call those the Great Lakes by the way.” She smiled radiantly as she rattled off her extended title. “I’m here to give you an offer, miss Callier. I see how your current life is just sucking the life out of you. I’m here to offer you something better, more adventurous, magical, sensuous, etcetera, etcetera, etcetera. Apologies, my lovers are much better than me at speaking all grand and such.”<br />
<br />
Charlotte couldn’t help but giggle at the elf queen’s unconventional way of pontificating. “I mean, I get it, I want to get away from it all a lot of the time. But I can’t just run away forever, I mean I became a journalist because I thought I could make a difference that way.”<br />
<br />
“My dear, making a difference is exactly what my elven love-buddies and I are trying to do, for everyone! We’re spreading this gift to everyone we can. For our own sakes and the good of the world, if you follow me?” Maraya sat down in the water, meeting Charlotte at eye level.<br />
<br />
Charlotte was suddenly bombarded by magical visions playing out before her eyes. What had happened to the elves transforming all over the world so far, and what was to come as more and more of them made the change. What she saw didn’t help cover her obvious arousal. <br />
<br />
“That… that looks pretty great actually- alright, your majesty, how can I get started?” <br />
<br />
“Just keep doing what you’re doing, and enjoy the ride…” Maraya grinned as she grazed her slender fingers down Charlotte’s midriff. As she did, her shirt melted away into the water, and Charlotte squeaked as her bare chest was exposed to the night air. The breeze then brushed over her exposed womanhood as her pants shortly met with the exact same fate. <br />
<br />
The reporter’s lips curled into a smile as the sea elf perched over her nude body, waiting for her invitation. “Do it.” Charlotte all but begged.<br />
<br />
She moaned deeply as at once Maraya’s fingers teased her slit at first gently, before shifting to feverishly lavishing ministrations on the human’s walls. Her dark blue lips wrapped around one of Charlotte’s breasts as she began to kiss and lavish her hardened nipples with her tongue all the while.<br />
<br />
As pleasure and magic surged through her body, the woman’s pale skin began to become stark white like newly fallen snow. Her breath hitched, and as she exhaled her breath parted her lips as condensation, like she was outside in the depths of winter. Her body temperature as a whole suddenly plummeted as she fondled  her other breast, both of which were growing with each pulse of magic, also causing her waist to taper in and her hips and rear to gain mass. She was already a very pretty woman, she now easily outclassed most of the well known human celebrities.<br />
<br />
She cooed as she caressed her right ear while they both lengthened into their signature elven points. She began to pinch and rub the length of them as she found they sent even more erogenous satisfaction through her body. Her long brunette hair was not untouched either as it began to turn a pale, icy blue from the roots out. Before long, Charlotte was being pleasured by Maraya atop a bed of ice floating on the water as her true powers as a snow elf began to manifest.<br />
<br />
Carlindra’s icy blue eyes opened as her transformation concluded to the tempo of Maraya moving from pleasuring her with fingers to eating her out with her dexterous tongue, her fingers plying her entrance all the while until Maraya hit upon the new elf’s sweet spot. <br />
<br />
The fifth queen of the elven council, Carlindra of the snow elves, slowly sat up on her ice floe platform. She explored her new body with diving hands as Maraya curled up to her fellow monarch.<br />
<br />
“Well well well! Kenzia and Astania are gonna be thrilled with you!” She placed a slow, passionate kiss onto Carlindra’s lips, tasting the cool rush inside her mouth. “Welcome to the council, your majesty.” She gently cradled her down to rest. “I’ve kept you up too long though, get some sleep love, big things are coming tomorrow.”</p>
