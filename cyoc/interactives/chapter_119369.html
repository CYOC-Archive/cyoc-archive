<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You approach the machine turned off, and without doing it on purpose you press the button with a large &quot;forbidden&quot; beside it. The machine starts, and you are struck by a laser beam that runs through your whole body. An electronic voice announces:<br />
<br />
  &quot;You are the first subject in the world to test our invention, and now that is what you can do : when you touch someone or an object that belongs to them, you get their best physical appearance. Currently it doesn&#39;t work if you try to improve your body with body parts of somebody of the same gender. You can not get another man&#39;s muscles, but you can pick up a woman&#39;s breasts, if you&#39;re a man. Be aware that you can change your body only for something better.You can not regress.No one will know what is happening. If you have already received a body part of someone, and you touch that person again, his second best aspect will be given to you. Because of instability it will not go further than two assets per person. &quot;<br />
<br />
  Intrigued by what the voice has just announced, you tell yourself that it is impossible that something like this exists. Then you tell the girl &quot;We&#39;re going, there&#39;s nothing interesting here.&quot; But when she leaves, she forgets her bag behind a machine, and you intend to bring her back. But she&#39;s already gone. The next day you are back at your university. You don&#39;t know why this is happening but apparently a small group of girls has formed at the entrance. Surely the last gossip. Oh, one of the girls dropped something. You pick it up, and give it back. She thanks you, and you enter. But then you feel something that tickles your shoulders. You realize that you hair has grown and become chestnut! These remind you of something ... These are the hair of the girl you just helped !<br />
<br />
  This is disturbing, especially as no one seems to notice it around you. You readjust your glasses, and then you meet the girl of yesterday. She does not say anything special, and you stop her by coming out of your &quot;suitcase&quot; her bag. She smiled and said, &quot;Thank you, I was afraid I would not find him again.&quot; &quot;No problem !&quot; You plunge your eyes one last time in his blue eyes, and continue your way. You take a look at the toilet, and when you look in the mirror, something is wrong. You have the same eyes and eyebrows as the girl! His beautiful eyes seem a little displaced on your face, but your features have also softened. This whole story is starting to get weird. But in the end, is it not rather exciting? Especially that nobody realizes, or at least scares them. You no longer need to have glasses, so you put them in your bag.<br />
<br />
  You think about what happened yesterday, and you have an idea. What if we tried some tricks? You spot off a pretty sexy girl you never really touched. You walk quickly towards her, and suddenly you kiss her passionately on the lips. At the same time, you feel your lips become as luscious as hers. It&#39;s as if she was kissing herself! Now you have all your face which is consituted of several characters of girls that you have met, and clearly this face is that of the perfect girl! This power really works ... The girl you just kissed is a bit disoriented by your act but she makes no comment on the fact that you have a woman face.<br />
<br />
  Now we have to find a way to make more experience, and more easily. You have an idea. The locker room where everybody arranges their belongings which they doesn&#39;t need in class. It&#39;s on the other end of the building, but in the end in 5 minutes it&#39;s done. You enter carefully, and open the door of the girls. Nobody is there. So much the better, there will be no questions. You close behind you and block the door to not be disturbed. It is an intimate place you have never had access to, and for the first time you can see that it is indeed tidy. The bags each have their place, and the name of the person just above. Other cases litter the ground, but you can not see what it is because the room is plunged into the dark. You do not know where to start. You stumble on a bag. This is the one of the girl of a little while ago! You are wondering what is going to change. Then as you remember what the voice said, you feel something reorganize within you. That&#39;s right, your hips widen and become like those of the girl of the lab. You stand up, it is a little difficult because you stand in the way of a girl now. And then an idea appears in your mind. One can modify its parts of the body, but can we add some?<br />
<br />
  You collect without touching them a lot of bags, in order to do tests. You have the one of the girl you helped at the college entrance, that of a very tall girl, one of a girl whose only thing you know is that &quot;for her size, she has big breasts &quot;, and quite a few others.<br />
Just to start small, you take that one of the latter. The sensation comes back, and you feel your chest getting heavier. You have breasts! So far for you these are B cup, but you plan to arrange it. Still, it&#39;s strange to see these two globes on your chest! You are half woman now. A bra appeared out of nowhere to support your newly acquired breasts. Is it also the same as that of the girl ...? At the point where we are at it, we must go as far as we can. You take all the bags in your arms. You feel your legs lenghten, looking more and more like the long gorgeous legs of the tall girl. The most incredible is how your new &quot;assets&quot; blend with your body. Now you see your arms and hands become like those of the girl at the entrance. At the same time, your butts grow and become round like the ass of the girl you kissed just before. Finally, your dick shrunk, and you get a pretty crotch of a girl you do not know.<br />
<br />
  Now that your total transformation is woman is over, let&#39;s have a little fun. With a whole new body, certainly lovely, but not yet exactly as you want, you go out of the room, and obviously nobody notices what has just happened. Hmpfff, it&#39;s time to &quot;upgrade&quot; a little this chest. You notice a very well-stocked girl, and you know it will be enough. You brush against her discreetly, and see your breasts grow to become enormous. Certainly D cup! A last modification that allows you to have an even bigger ass, and voila, it&#39;s perfect. What do you intend to do now?</p>
