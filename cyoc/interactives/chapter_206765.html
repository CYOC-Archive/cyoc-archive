<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">‘Remember the mission.’<br />
<br />
The journey to the garden felt like a blur. I didn’t care enough to study the path we took. I was completely entranced by my new physique. I don’t think my hands ever left my thighs, as with each step I revelled in the new muscles that tensed and flexed. I had never been hornier. I thought maybe life at the manor wouldn’t be so bad, if this was part of it. Maybe I should just give in to the temptations... <br />
<br />
Every time my mind wondered to such thoughts I had to forcefully steer it back on course.<br />
<br />
‘Remember the mission.’<br />
<br />
It was like a war in my head. You see, not only did my body change but my mind as well. Not hugely, but enough for me to notice whenever I tried to snap out of my hormone-driven spiral. I still had free will, but it was like a part of me wanted more. To be bigger. Stronger. Sexier. Maybe if I was big enough Jimbo and I could finish what we started…<br />
<br />
‘No!’ I thought, ‘remember the mission!’<br />
<br />
“We’re here.”<br />
<br />
We were surrounded by a field of flowers. I was so pre-occupied I didn’t even know we were outside; my eyes adjusted to the sunlight. I turned back to see Jimbo with the manor far behind him. The dirt path we stood on that was enclosed by a low cobblestone wall must’ve lead us to the garden. The early morning sheen glossed over the landscape, to the tight cluster of trees and the hills beyond. It was really quite breathtaking.<br />
<br />
There was one thing, however, which colour and light didn’t dare to touch. A sulking structure of metal loomed over behind the trees. It was simply ginormous, made with patches of rusted copper metal hastily fused together. On the front of it was a tall, circular window of white-stained glass. Some pattern was on it but I was too far to make it out. The building was so unnerving it looked like it was either going to fall, or grow legs and chase us.<br />
<br />
“There,” said Jimbo.<br />
<br />
He placed a hand on my shoulder and pointed to two shapes that bobbed in and out of view from the other side of the field. They were a man and a boy diligently working on the flowers. The man stood up to wave at me. Jimbo pushed me to go to them. As we drew nearer I could see they were wearing the same uniform as me, and also had thick, strong legs with toned arms. The man’s bulge was rather snug in the dungarees, which was stained with soil. The boy however was rock hard, his member snaking up to his stomach. He kept his gaze fixed on the flowers he was picking.<br />
<br />
The man, who looked to be in his late 50s, greeted me with a warm smile underneath a brilliantly thick moustache. He held his hand out to me, glancing at my boner only for a second.<br />
<br />
“G’morning. The name’s Dallan.”<br />
“Billy.”<br />
<br />
We shook hands. The boy didn’t say anything, and had a worried look. <br />
<br />
“Where is your guard?” Jimbo said sternly.<br />
“He’s checking the last batch,” replied Dallan, pointing to the trees by the metal building.<br />
<br />
Leaning against one of the tree trunks was a man of similar size and stature to Jimbo closely inspecting the contents of a wicker basket. His uniform jacket was neatly hanging on one of the branches, and his shirt had been unbuttoned. His thick torso was on full display, and it glistened in the morning sun with his sweat. My cock throbbed at the sight of him. Remember the mission.<br />
<br />
Jimbo scowled.<br />
<br />
“Get to work.”<br />
<br />
I watched, almost hypnotised, as he strode across the field towards the man. The tip of my cock was wet with pre. Remember the mission. <br />
<br />
“So what do I do?” I asked Dallan.<br />
<br />
*** <br />
<br />
The morning went by faster than I thought. By noon Dallan had showed me the basic roles of a Locksteed Manor Gardener, and I was quite enjoying it. All we needed to do was pick and replant the flowers that grew in the field. Their petals shone all sorts of colours, and no two were the same. It was like a sea of prismatic waves in the wind. <br />
<br />
My favourite thing to do was hauling the plough across the field. Every tool we used felt centuries old; nothing later than the late 1800s. I strapped the plough around my shoulders and pulled it as if dragging a train behind me. Finally testing out my new strength was almost orgasmic. I pulled that rusted heap of farming equipment with ease, and the tight dungarees only accentuated my frame. The fabric was practically jerking me off as it rubbed my manhood. A thick patch of pre had formed, but I couldn’t find the right time to fully let loose. My sweat didn’t help things either. It smelt different. It smelt manly. With each huff of my own musk I became more lost in my lustful thoughts.<br />
<br />
Dallan and I enjoyed a nice conversation. He was the village’s only librarian before he was taken to the manor a few weeks back. I asked him about the boy but he knew nothing, simply saying, “it’s the lad’s first week here. He’ll settle in I’m sure. Dunno his name.”<br />
<br />
The boy didn’t speak at all. He looked around constantly, as if watching out for our two guards who watched us mercilessly. I often caught him tugging at his hardon and we’d lock eyes. He had a boyish face but I pinned him to be 18, maybe 19 years old. His dick was bigger than mine by a few inches. I wondered what was troubling him. Perhaps he needed to release like me.<br />
<br />
By lunchtime we were worn out. The guards had their eyes peeled on us until that moment when a steam whistle blared from the manor. They split off from us and talked amongst themselves. Jimbo acts like he doesn’t remember at all what happened; our kiss. I felt a sting of heartbreak.<br />
<br />
We found an overturned log by the path that was neatly in the shade. Dallan dropped his shovel and sat on it with a huff.<br />
<br />
“We get 20 minutes, then it’s back to it.”<br />
<br />
He caught me staring longingly at Jimbo.<br />
<br />
<br />
“You’re making a mistake lad.”<br />
<br />
I turned to face him, “how so?” I asked.<br />
<br />
“You don’t wanna be fooling out with that lot. Those aren’t men anymore. They’re just the Lord’s puppets.”<br />
<br />
“But…but we—“<br />
“Kissed?”<br />
<br />
I felt my face go red.<br />
<br />
“Yes. How do you—“<br />
“He kissed me when I first joined.”<br />
<br />
He pointed at the other guard and sighed.<br />
<br />
“It’s how they activate the…thing they give you. Make you believe you’re the best-looking horse in the stable. Then when it’s made the changes, they leave you alone without a second’s thought.”<br />
<br />
I didn’t respond, and just looked over to Jimbo. Jimbo, and his perfect body. That perfect face. I had the urge to run up to him and kiss him right then and there. I couldn’t believe how little self-control I had.<br />
<br />
“I’d use that 20 minutes wisely lad. Maybe you could take care of, well…yourself,” Dallan suggested as he pointed at my crotch, “maybe you both could!”<br />
<br />
He let out a heart chuckle as the boy suddenly appeared into my view. He was looking at his hand in his pocket. He was fiddling with something, and I could hear his breathing become erratic. He looked nervous, no, terrified. <br />
<br />
Out of his pocket he pulled a small, thin glass tube with a cork. Inside the tube was a thick, white liquid. It looked more like white paint than cum, and it almost flowed in his palm. Dallan’s smile quickly faded when he noticed the tube.<br />
<br />
“Where did you get that, boy?”<br />
“Just there.”<br />
<br />
The boy’s voice was quiet and timid, like a whisper. He pointed directly at the metal building. His hand was trembling. Dallan looked worried.<br />
<br />
“What were you doing skulking around there?”<br />
“It was near the door I…I didn’t think I…I couldn’t leave it.”<br />
“You don’t know what it is, lad.”<br />
“I might have an idea…”<br />
<br />
He looked at the two guards to see if the coast was clear. They were just out of earshot. Then, he popped the cork off the tube. As he did, a small curtain of white gas began seeping out from the opening. Dallan got to his feet and held his hand out to the boy.<br />
<br />
“Give it here, lad. You’re being foolish.”<br />
“What is it?” I asked.<br />
“Look at me. Look at you! Look at him! This is the best I have ever looked in my entire life. I was this scrawniest little piece of shit, but I’m sexy as fuck!”<br />
<br />
His voice was still quiet but more assertive. He slowly spun, allowing my eyes to wander over every part of his physique, especially his ass. A spurt of precum stained my dungarees even further.<br />
<br />
“But I…” he continued, transfixed on the liquid in the tube, “I need more. I need to be bigger.”<br />
<br />
“But that could kill you!” Dallan yelled, causing the two guards to look over at us. <br />
<br />
“We both know it won’t,” replied the boy who, upon hearing the guards’ approaching footsteps, took a deep breath in. Then, he quickly gulped the liquid, swallowing all of it and frantically stuffed the tube back into his pocket. Dallan looked at the boy fearfully, who only looked back with great anticipation.<br />
<br />
“What’s going on?” Jimbo said with an especially deep tone.<br />
<br />
Suddenly the boy lurched forward, reaching out for someone to catch him. Jimbo grabbed his arms and held him up in confusion. Dallan and I were shocked.<br />
<br />
It was unlike anything I had ever seen. His cock had almost doubled in size, and his balls were so big they were beginning to form two separate bulges by his thighs. The boy had his eyes closed and appeared to be in complete ecstasy. He spoke in between his moans like a swimmer breaths between strokes.<br />
<br />
“Oh God I can feel it…I can feel it…COMING!!”<br />
<br />
He grunted and tensed his entire body as we watched his cock explode in size. It grew another foot, slithering further up his chest. It was huge! And much thicker than before too. His balls swelled, pushing the fabric of his dungarees to its limits. Jimbo’s eyes widened as he stared at the boy’s growing member.<br />
<br />
“A Producer?!? Quick, grab his legs!” Jimbo yelled to the other guard. The two men lifted the boy up off the ground, but not before he let out a tremendous groan.<br />
<br />
“Don’t stop—OHHHH!”<br />
<br />
His cock grew another foot, sliding up to his shirt and through the opening, resting just below his mouth. It was leaking a constant stream of precum, which trickled down his body. His balls were pulsing, full with his seed. He was trying to fit his cock in his mouth, but it was just too big.<br />
<br />
Jimbo and the other guard started running straight to the metal building with the boy in their grasp. The increasing weight of the boy’s manhood was testing even their strength. When they were far enough away, Dallan looked at the thick woods just by the path.<br />
<br />
“Let’s go”<br />
<br />
And he sprinted towards it, only to stop after a few seconds. He turned back to see I was standing completely still, in shock and awe. <br />
<br />
“Quick! We might not get another chance to escape! We could get help, call the police, fire brigade, ANYONE!”<br />
<br />
I didn’t answer. I didn’t want to escape, to leave Arthur alone. I needed to find out what the hell was going on. And Jimbo…my cock was practically begging for release.<br />
<br />
“Remember the mission,” I said aloud.<br />
<br />
“What?” Dallan looked more frustrated than genuinely confused.<br />
<br />
“I can’t leave, I’m sorry.”<br />
<br />
And so I ran after the boy and the guards. Dallan called after me but gave up. I watched him leap over the wall and quickly disappear in the woods. <br />
<br />
Remember the mission.</p>
