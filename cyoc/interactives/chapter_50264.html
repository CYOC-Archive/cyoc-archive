<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;How much do you know?&quot; Tina asked Jeff.<br />
<br />
'Well I've been aware of everything and was able to understand everything until you put me on the first time,' Jeff thought to Tina. 'After that my mind started getting foggy. I know you came to my house but I couldn't understand anything.'<br />
<br />
&quot;Well Sarah had answered the door when I came and told me you were out with friends,&quot; Tina said. &quot;Then your mom said that you had gone to bed early and were still sleeping. I came up to your room and saw that you weren't here. Shortly after your mom and Sarah came in Sarah confessed to what she had done and has been grounded for a month. Though I think she'll be grounded for much longer now.&quot;<br />
<br />
'I bet' Jeff thought. 'Mom is livid. So what happened after that?'<br />
<br />
&quot;Well we went to the store to find you,&quot; Tina said sighing. &quot;We looked for you there but we couldn't find you. We were about to give up hope of finding you figuring that someone had brought you. We came back to see if there was something with this Chronivac that could help find you. Just as we got back I remembered that I had bought a bra just a bit ago. I suggested that maybe my bra might be you. We came up and your mom was able to use the Chronivac to confirm that you were my bra. I took you off and your mom restored your mind and tried to transform you back. She couldn't though.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;MAYBE YOUR PUNISHMENT SHOULD BE TO BECOME TINA'S PANTIES PERMANENTLY,&quot; Mrs. Johnson yelled. Sarah shouted something in reply but it was muffled. &quot;YOU SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT OF THAT BEFORE YOU DELETED YOUR BROTHER,&quot; Mrs. Johnson yelled her voice starting to crack. &quot;NOW HE'S A BRA PERMANENTLY. IT'S LIKE YOU MURDERED HIM.&quot;<br />
<br />
'I have an idea Tina,' Jeff thought. 'I heard Lisa Gray telling Mrs. Voorheis that she was happy with her new body. They began talking in hushed tones but I did hear Chronivac and TransDerm Labs. Maybe she can help if she's had a Chronivac for awhile.'<br />
<br />
&quot;Mrs. Johnson Jeff just had an idea,&quot; Tina called from the door.<br />
<br />
Soon Mrs. Johnson and Sarah came running both looking hopeful but for obviously different reasons. &quot;How do you know Jeff had an idea?&quot; Mrs. Johnson asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I made it so when someone wears him they can hear his thoughts,&quot; Tina said blushing a bit.<br />
<br />
&quot;So what's Jeff's idea?&quot; Sarah asked her voice a mixture of hope and loathing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jeff thinks Lisa Gray could help,&quot; Tina said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll go call her right now,&quot; Mrs. Johnson said leaving Jeff's room.<br />
<br />
A few minutes later Lisa was standing in Jeff's room listening to their story. After she sighed and said, &quot;I really hate those inanimate packages. I keep telling them that something was going to happen if they didn't crack down on them. Well let me see what happened. Has anyone else been transformed since Jeff?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; Sarah said being truthful. &quot;I was going to transform Kelly into a... well into something to give me pleasure and delete her original form like I did with Jeff.&quot;<br />
<br />
Everyone appeared to be stunned by that. Finally Mrs. Johnson asked, &quot;How could you Sarah?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm tired of being one of three children,&quot; Sarah said with a scowl. &quot;I had thought about killing them but the Chronivac gave me a way to get rid of them without having to go to jail. I was going to use it on you and Dad so you wouldn't remember them and I'd get everything.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mrs. Johnson placed a hand on her chest and sat down heavily on Jeff's bed. She was obviously distraught over her eldest daughter's confession. All this time Lisa had been working on the computer. She sighed as she said, &quot;She managed to delete the safety back-ups. I'm sorry Mrs. Johnson but I can't transform Jeff back. There is something I can do though. I'm sure you'll approve of my solution.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What is it?&quot; Mrs. Johnson asked hope in her voice.<br />
<br />
Lisa took something out of her purse and poked Sarah with it. Sarah went down to the floor and Lisa quickly bound her hands and feet with plastic ties. After she was done she looked up and said, &quot;I can switch Jeff's mind/soul with Sarah's. Sarah will be Jeff and Jeff will be Sarah. I'm going to lock Sarah's mind/soul in Jeff's body so she can't do any harm.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You can't do that,&quot; Sarah said struggling to get free.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yes I can,&quot; Lisa said going back to the computer. &quot;We can't have someone like you running around. You wanted to get rid of your brother and sister. You even considered murdering them.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sarah giggled nervously and said, &quot;I was only kidding about that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You deleted every single profile for your brother's original form,&quot; Lisa said in an angry tone. &quot;I don't know how you found them all but you did. That isn't the actions of someone who didn't want someone to disappear. You're a selfish brat and you deserve this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom please stop her,&quot; Sarah pleaded tears in her eyes. &quot;I won't do it again. I promise.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I wish I could believe you,&quot; Mrs. Johnson said. &quot;I don't want to lose you but I think this is for the best.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How can you sit there and let her do that to me?&quot; Sarah asked in a quiet panicked voice.<br />
<br />
In answer Mrs. Johnson closed her eyes and turned away crying. Lisa looked at Tina and said, &quot;I need you to take Jeff off Tina. I don't want your mind/soul accidentally switched too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright,&quot; Tina said taking Jeff off. &quot;What about after the switch?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well it would be best if Jeff stays as Sarah to make things simple,&quot; Lisa said pointing the emitter at Jeff when Tina had put him down.<br />
<br />
&quot;But he wouldn't be my boyfriend anymore,&quot; Tina said crying a bit.<br />
<br />
&quot;That's true but he could be your girlfriend,&quot; Lisa said pointing the emitter at Sarah. &quot;There are settings that give Sarah's body a dick.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sarah paled and said, &quot;This is my body not Jeff's. I like it the way it is.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Too bad,&quot; Lisa said hovering her thumb over the save button on the emitter. &quot;You didn't want to be one of three children and now you won't be. Now say good bye to your old life and hello to your new one as a bra.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nooooo!&quot; Sarah exclaimed as Lisa hit the save button.<br />
<br />
Jeff's vision went black and he couldn't feel his body anymore. It only lasted a second and then he was able to feel and see again. What he saw however was Lisa pointing the emitter at him and he felt his hands and feet bound. He could also feel the unfamiliar weight of breasts on his chest and the lack of a familiar appendage. &quot;I'm Sarah now,&quot; he said in wonder.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes you are,&quot; Lisa said putting the emitter down. &quot;Now to undo the telepathic communication for the bra so it doesn't annoy whoever where's it.&quot; A couple clicks later and that was done. &quot;Now I'm sure you have a couple of questions.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How is it possible for someone to become inanimate?&quot; Mrs. Johnson asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well the Chronivac can't transform someone into an inanimate object,&quot; Lisa started explaining. &quot;How the makers of the inanimate packages have done is heavy body modification to make it appear someone becomes inanimate. They're very much alive.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then why couldn't we transform Jeff into someone else?&quot; Tina asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;It has to do with Sarah deleting Jeff's original profile,&quot; Lisa said. &quot;Once she did that the no time limit changed to permanent.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You said there were back-up copies of my profile,&quot; Jeff said. &quot;Could you have returned me to normal if there was a back-up of my original profile?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I could have,&quot; Lisa said hanging her head. &quot;We haven't ran into this problem before as most people can't access the deep recovery files. How she did it I don't know. I hope this is just a fluke with her.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Can we transform Sarah's body into a boy?&quot; Jeff asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's your body now and you can do that if you want,&quot; Lisa said cutting the bindings on Jeff's legs. She helped him up to a sitting position and cut the bindings on his wrists while saying, &quot;I would suggest that you at least try staying with this body as it is for a bit. It will make it simpler to have to only change memories and records for one person.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How do you know so much about the Chronivac?&quot; Tina asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I work for TransDem Labs,&quot; Lisa said shrugging like it should be obvious.<br />
<br />
&quot;But you can't be more than sixteen,&quot; Mrs. Johnson said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I was one of the first test subjects for the Chronivac,&quot; Lisa said. &quot;I was a forty year old man before.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh gross,&quot; Tina said making a disgusted face, &quot;and I've had to shower and change my clothes in front of you. You're a pervert.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I didn't become a fifteen year old girl to see girls nude,&quot; Lisa said in an indignant tone. &quot;I became a fifteen year old girl because I felt that I should have been born a girl.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you happy?&quot; Jeff asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm happier than any time in my life,&quot; Lisa said smiling. &quot;It's so freeing to be what you were suppose to be. Now I would appreciate it if you didn't tell anyone what I was. They wouldn't believe you if you told them anyway. I have to go and start on changing memories and records so Jeff never existed.&quot;<br />
<br />
Once Lisa had left Tina asked Jeff, &quot;So what are you going to do?&quot;</p>
