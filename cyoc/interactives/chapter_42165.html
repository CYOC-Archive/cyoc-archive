<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff looked at the emitter and started to wonder what it would be like to be ten again but as a girl. His dad would then have triplet girls to take care of. It might be going overboard but Jeff was curious. He pointed the emitter at himself and then looked at the settings. He changed his age to ten and his gender to female. He noticed that the other values changed automatically though he wanted a few of them to be different. His weight would be the same sixty-five pounds that Emily had been naturally. He knew that this was overweight for a ten year old girl. Emily's weight in this new reality was thirty-seven pounds which was a more average weight. Jeff decided to make his weight thirty-six. Emily's height was four foot eight inches so Jeff decided his should be four foot seven inches.<br />
<br />
Satisfied with the settings he made sure that he would be aware and that reality would be changed when he transformed. He double checked everything on last time then pointed the emitter at himself and pressed save. He felt a tingling sensation as he started transforming. He started shrinking while what little pubic and body hair he had receded into his body. His hair grew until it was a little past his shoulders. A funny feeling came from his groin as his balls and penis sucked up into his body and reformed into their female counterparts.<br />
<br />
As soon the transformation finished Jeff felt that funny feeling again. When he could think clearly again he noticed that he was wearing a denim skirt, sandals, and a light blue shirt. He smiled at this. He had gone from a five foot five inch fifty-one pound fourteen year old boy to a four foot seven inch thirty-six pound ten year old girl.<br />
<br />
&quot;Janet, have you seen Kathy?&quot; a female voice said from the kitchen doorway.<br />
<br />
Jeff, or Janet now, was startled momentarily. She didn't know this woman but then a memory clicked. She was Monique, their live-in nanny. She had been hired when their dad had found out that he couldn't be there with his daughters all the time though he had tried. &quot;She went over to Janie's&quot; she answered. &quot;She'll be back by supper.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright&quot; Monique said. &quot;Your father called. He said that he has to work late and won't be home in time for supper. He's going to grab something after work and he said we should go out to eat. I figured that since Emily is going to the movies with Angie we might as well eat at the food court. After that we can go shopping or see a movie too. How does that sound?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sounds great&quot; Janet said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good&quot; Monique said. &quot;Did you get your homework done?&quot;<br />
<br />
Janet didn't know right away then another memory clicked into place. &quot;I have one problem left&quot; she said. &quot;I helped Karen with her homework.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You're such a good sister&quot; Monique said smiling. &quot;Hurry up and finish that problem. I'll call over to Janie's to tell Karen what we're doing. We'll leave in about a half hour.&quot;<br />
<br />
Monique left and Janet sat back down to finish her homework. It dealt with adding fractions and was a word problem. Janet had always had problems with word problems but she was able to solve it. At least she thought she did. She then headed up to her room. She was about to enter what was her room from when she was Jeff when another memory clicked into place. This was Monique's room now. Janet shared a room with her sisters now.<br />
<br />
Going into the right room Janet located a special box that she had been a present from her dad at Christmas. Each girl had their own special box. The boxes had a voice activated lock so each girl could keep their diaries secret if they wanted to and keep some things that they didn't want the others to borrow. She opened it with her password and put the emitter inside.<br />
<br />
She looked at the picture that was in the lid. It showed her dad with an unfamiliar woman and three five year old girls. Another memory clicked into place and she knew who the woman was. It was her mom and the picture was taken just two days before Christmas. That was the last Christmas they had had with their mom. Two weeks later she was killed during a bank robbery. They weren't there when it had happened which was lucky for them. There were two gunmen and it was the second gunman that had shot their mother. He also shot a four year old girl and a three year old boy for crying. There was another child that was crying and the second gunman had turned to shoot that child also. The first gunman killed the second gunman before he could kill the third child. The first gunman then gave himself up saying that he never meant anyone to get hurt, least of all little kids. Their dad had told them that their mom had gone away and wouldn't be back. It wasn't until last year that he had told them what had really happened.<br />
<br />
Janet closed the lid and heard the lock catch. The emitter would be safe in there. She looked at the computer the girls shared and figured that the program wouldn't work without the emitter. She went to her dresser and pulled out a pink sweater in case they went to the movies too. After all, it was usually chilly in the theaters.</p>
