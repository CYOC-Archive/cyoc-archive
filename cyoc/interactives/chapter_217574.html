<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Just as the two of you were in a loving embrace with each other, You then heard a furious knocking on the door. Masaru rushed downstairs to see who it was, and out of curiosity, you decided to follow him down to see who it was. The door was then opened to reveal a middle-aged human couple with a very displeased look on their faces.<br />
<br />
“Where is Mason?” the blonde woman asked in an angry tone, her husband standing there with his arms crossed. “He’s been over here, and we haven’t heard from him since Tuesday.”<br />
<br />
Masaru looked at them with a confused look, unsure of who this &quot;Mason&quot; was. He turned to you and whispered, “I don&#39;t know who they&#39;re talking about, but they seem pretty upset.”<br />
<br />
You whispered back, “What are we going to say to them?”<br />
<br />
“Relax, Benji,” he answered as an idea floated into his head.<br />
<br />
As the man’s body began to transform, you watched in awe as his face started to elongate, taking on the shape of a tiger&#39;s muzzle. His skin started to change, with a thick coat of fur sprouting all over his body, while his hair filled out and took on a white color. The fur was striped, with thick black stripes against a background of white fur. The stripes on his face were thinner, tracing intricate patterns around his eyes and across his cheeks, different from the markings you had as a European badger, as the furry pattern continued to travel down his body. His ears migrated upwards on his head, becoming pointed and covered in the same striped fur as the rest of his body. They twitched as he took in his new surroundings, and he let out a soft growl as he felt his tail grow out from the base of his spine. The tail was long and thick, also covered in the same striped fur, and it swished back and forth behind him as he continued to change.<br />
<br />
“Honey, w-what&#39;s happening to you?!” the woman began to shriek.<br />
<br />
“I don’t know, ma-mom” The changing human finally spoke, shocking his wife as he called her his “Mom” rather than his wife.  “No wait-” he tried to correct himself before his mind began to shift, his voice changing to something more fitting for a young man rather than the forty-something he was.<br />
<br />
“I don’t see anything wrong, ma’am. Your son is right next to you,” Masaru answered as the tanuki continued working his magic on the changing human, and his spouse also began to experience changes of her own, seeing her ears change similarly to her new son, with a striped tail slinking out from under her.<br />
<br />
Todd, now the new Mason, saw his changes continue. Years seemingly melted away from his body, his shoulders becoming broader as he took on a more masculine shape than the human body he once had as his body grew taller and muscular. As striped fur continued to march down his arms, increasing in tone, his hands began to develop paw pads and razor-sharp claws on each new paw.<br />
<br />
“Such a strong tiger,” Masaru said, as Mason’s dress shirt gave way for a T-shirt and shorts that revealed more new fur on his body, as he grew in size to tower over you and your tanuki boyfriend. Finally, his tail grew out from under him, and his shoes seemed to disintegrate, given Mason’s new size.<br />
<br />
His former wife-turned-mom saw her changes continue as well as she too developed a tigrine appearance along her face, with a coating of white fur with black stripes covering the woman. Her hair turned white and grew out, blending in with the fur that was now sprouting all over her body. The fur was thick and lustrous, with the same striped pattern as Mason&#39;s. Her face elongated into a tigrine muzzle, with sharp teeth poking out from her lips, with a face more narrow than her new son’s, as her body saw more black and white feline fur covering her as she too began to grow in size. She kicked off her shoes as her feet began to change, growing white fur and taking a more feline shape, becoming paw-like. Lastly, her hands began to change as black paw pads took shape on the palms of her hands and fingertips, and her nails began to reshape into claws, before her hands were filled in.<br />
<br />
The two of them stood before you and Masaru as fully transformed anthros, with Mason towering over you all, his size and muscles making him an impressive sight. His mother, meanwhile, was slightly shorter than him but no less imposing, her appearance giving the newly-minted tigress an air of authority. Memories began to reshape the minds of the husband and wife-turned-mother and son. You also developed some new memories of Mason as well, as you remembered him as a teammate from your soccer team back in high school. You were both able to relate, having both been raised by single mothers, and the two of you, as well as Masaru, were close lads. You may have had a lot of differences, in terms of size and personality, him being the highly extroverted Tiger, and you being the more mellowed out British Badger, but as your mate would say “A good anthro looks out for one another,&quot; and the two of you did just that.<br />
<br />
“I’m so sorry about all of that,” Mason’s mom said. “He likes to hang out with friends a lot and sometimes I still get a bit worried if he’s away for a while. Sometimes I forget that he is an adult now and he has his own friends.”<br />
<br />
“Don’t worry about that ma’am. A mother protective of her cubs is a good mother.” Masaru replies. <br />
<br />
You then look over to Mason with a broad grin, and offer him an invite to hang out with you and Masaru...</p>
