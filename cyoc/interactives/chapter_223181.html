<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">If you had told Jacob Moreland a year ago he would find himself not only working but enjoying his employment with the federal government, he would have thought you insane. It was amazing though how much could change in so little time.<br />
<br />
Jacob&#39;s time with S.P.E.A.R was proving to be rewarding. The retired hunter was able to lend his expertise and found Sarah to be open to most of his suggestions. The latest suggestion had proven to help the fledgling agency immensely. A prisoner escaping in Pennsylvania had stymied local law enforcement, after two weeks they were at their wits end, fearful an escaped murderer would not only avoid detection but kill again. That was when Jacob had suggested a very unorthodox idea. Why not use S.P.E.A.Rs own resources to assist.<br />
<br />
It only took a couple of days before S.P.E.A.R was able to prove itself. The escaped killer was captured and a cover story was developed. While S.P.E.A.R wouldn&#39;t get the headlines, they put in just enough for the agency to hold their heads up with pride. The world may think a DEA plane spotted a heat signature, which led to a canine unit taking the murderer down. What the world wouldn&#39;t know is that it was in fact two former DEA agents who had apprehended the convict. Two agents who just so happened to be a werewolves.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jacob can I see you for a moment?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jacob glanced up from the files he was viewing, making his way towards Sarah&#39;s office. All around him, he could see the staff smiling. The operation to capture the escaped inmate had sent morale through the roof. Everyone understood that for reasons of national security the exact nature of how the operation transpired couldn&#39;t be revealed. These men and women were professionals, they understood their missions were highly classified and couldn&#39;t be discussed outside the agency. Inside the agency though, there was an almost festive attitude. &quot;You wanted to see me Sarah?&quot;<br />
<br />
Sarah looked up from her computer, a warm smile on her face as she invited the retired hunter inside. S.P.E.A.Rs mission in Pennsylvania had greatly impressed her superiors. For a fledgling agency, an operation such as this greatly enhanced their reputation, leading to future funding. Still, she understood that as quickly as her agency was commended, they could just as quickly become a scapegoat. &quot;Yeah cmon in Jacob. There&#39;s a few things I wanted to run by you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So I take it your bosses are happy,&quot; he said as he eased himself into a chair. &quot;Beyond happy,&quot; Sarah grinned. &quot;Mitchell and Rosario went above and beyond in Pennsylvania. Sure they had to change the story a bit but they wouldn&#39;t have caught that guy without them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;For the best Sarah,&quot; Jacob replied. &quot;A DEA plane and a canine is alot more palatable to folks than two werewolves working for the government. Speaking of which, they didn&#39;t bite that guy did they?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; Sarah chuckled. &quot;The blood was from Rosario grabbing his head. She&#39;s still doesn&#39;t quite know her own strength. That and well, the claws. You can&#39;t get lycanthropy from claw marks can you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nah gotta be a bite,&quot; Jacob stated. &quot;Still, I sent some vaccine down just in case. Mitchell said they injected the guy during his medical exam.&quot; Sarah nodded, a smile spreading across her face as she thought of Henry Mitchell and Anna Rosario. If Jacob hadn&#39;t spotted their profiles, the two former DEA agents would still be dealing with their lycanthropy alone. Now the pair worked for her and had succeeded in the most high profile operation in S.P.E.A.Rs young history.<br />
<br />
&quot;So do those two still want the cure?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t think so Jacob,&quot; Sarah said softly. &quot;I think they&#39;ve come to terms with it. Besides, we have other matters we have to take care of.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Back to business then,&quot; Jacob sighed. &quot;You don&#39;t even want to enjoy this a little bit?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh trust me I&#39;m enjoying it,&quot; Sarah chuckled. &quot;I&#39;m a Lions fan so when I do win I enjoy it. But, I also realize one victory doesn&#39;t guarantee success. We have a few other issues on our plate.&quot; Jacob nodded, leaning in as Sarah explained her concerns.<br />
<br />
The failure of Michelle&#39;s bracelet was of course first. Jacob had been puzzled by that, the amount of magic needed to break a hunters rune was tremendous. That an untrained shaman was able to generate that type of power was concerning. &quot;I&#39;ve never heard of something like that happening before,&quot; he stated. &quot;I&#39;m gonna swing by the Magic Shop this afternoon. See if I can find something that could hold up better.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sarah thanked him, knowing the retired hunter would do his best to make sure Michelle would be safe.  The other two issues that had come across her desk would require Jacob&#39;s assistance. She already knew though trying to convince him of one would be a fruitless endeavor. &quot;I received word from a couple of recently turned vampires,&quot; she said. &quot;They&#39;re looking for help.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Unless you&#39;re looking for help disposing of them I&#39;ll pass.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Figured you&#39;d say that,&quot; she smirked. &quot;That&#39;s why I saved this one for you. I received a call from that kitsune Akira. He&#39;s looking for help establishing a security force.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Security force? For what?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Apparently he&#39;s been put in charge of security for a high school,&quot; she said. &quot;I know it seems a bit odd but apparently there&#39;s quite a few supernatural children that go there. I told him you could give him a hand.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I suppose,&quot; Jacob shrugged. &quot;Beats helping a pair of vampires. Tell him I&#39;ll meet up with him and go over any security concerns.&quot; <br />
<br />
Sarah thanked him, watching the old hunter leave as she now glanced over several case files. The agency she was in charge of had already proven its worth. Hopefully her time as Director could turn S.P.E.A.R into something the government and the supernatural would respect.</p>
