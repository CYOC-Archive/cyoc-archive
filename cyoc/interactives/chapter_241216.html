<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">James ran back to his room as fast as he could, terrified of interacting with anyone at the thought of what might happen next. He quietly closes his door to better hide away as he panics about what he could do, he opened the magic book again, asking it again to show the current list of human instincts.<br />
<br />
He tried to steady his heartbeats as he mulled about how he could turn everything back to normal. His parents are so angry at each other. And it seemed their emotions stemmed from greed and sexual frustration. He couldn&#39;t believe his father built their marriage on a lie! If only love made him more happy than money. And his mom is just like him in a way, just need some sexual relief, especially with his kinks. James notes that he has to be careful, otherwise it&#39;ll just make things more weird.<br />
<br />
And then some flick switched on in his brain. Well......why not make it weird? He just ruined his family life, so maybe making things unrecognizable will somehow fix it. What if humans had an instinct to just have sex all the time? That would fix his problems, his mom&#39;s problems, and probably his dad&#39;s too. James grabbed a nearby notebook and pen and wrote down exactly what he wanted so he didn&#39;t mess up the changes. When he was satisfied, he thought out the new rules.<br />
<br />
&quot;Humans instincts are as followed:<br />
1. The Primary instinct is the need to survive as long as possible<br />
2. The secondary instinct is to be as happy as possible indefinitely. Humans achieve this by constantly having sex, and will do everything to accomplish this instinct&quot;<br />
<br />
And then in the same thought, at the last moment before turning the page, he added &quot;James Wilder will re-live their existence in this new world, and always have access to this book&quot;<br />
<br />
James had a split second after he turned the page to realize how weirdly phrased he made that second part, before society was completely thrown into a new reality. Unlike last time when he caused the new human instinct to occur in the present, the universal book of rules applied this new instinct to the very first human. And such a specific and strongly worded instinct caused a hivemind among humans, of achieving a society that experienced sex from birth to death, and sunrise and on to throughout the night. Humans are now a mostly peaceful species, as they learned pretty early that if everyone gets along and consents, everyone could have their instinct satisfied. There&#39;s still many conflicts, although most are petty quarrels at worst now. Crime still exists, including situations that result in death, but the vast majority of society has assimilated into this new sexual heaven.<br />
<br />
Humans have a &quot;one hour, one day, one week&quot; phrase when it comes to sex. Humans need to have sex with a living being in order to feel fully satisfied, but they can use substitutes for a short amount of time. Humans will constantly masturbate if they&#39;re not having sex, which ideally will only happen in brief moments (like switching to another sex partner that&#39;s just across the building). Humans can masturbate vigorously for an hour until they start to feel sex starved, unless they have a dildo in their ass (male or female) or pussy. The feeling of a stimulating enough dildo is enough that keep a human satisfied for a bit longer, about a day, until they start feeling sex starved. To help with this, every single seat will now have dildos attached strategically to let humans impale themselves on it. And if a human is sex starved for a week, that could lead to serious and threatening injuries both external and mentally as their need for sex makes them horribly irrational. Most crimes are committed because humans feel other emotions besides happiness when sex starved, which leads to other emotions, usually accumulating  in strength and becomes anger. Because of this, intentionally sex starving maliciously is a fairly serious offense. And there&#39;s many government programs to help individuals that are unable to have sex for a variety of reasons.<br />
<br />
96% of humans identify themselves as bisexual as a technicality, and practice it, but sexuality depends more on your lifestyle. 77% of the population participates in the &quot;straight&quot; lifestyle, the other being the &quot;queer&quot; lifestyle. A straight lifestyle is when a human&#39;s primary family dynamic consists of two humans, usually cisgender, have kids with each other. On an average day, a straight family will wake up for work and school from their orgy from the night before. Any kids of the family that wasn&#39;t fucked directly before bed needs a fresh one in the morning, which is an important detail of parenthood to ensure their kids behave in school. Getting ready, while fucking each other more, the kids go to school, and the mother and father part ways. This section of the day is called the &quot;social&quot; time. The kids go to sexual education school for 8 hours, while the parents work for any 4 hours, and then the other 4 is free time. <br />
<br />
The males usually work hard, demanding jobs that builds up lots of sexual steam, especially since most of those jobs don&#39;t include having direct sex with another living being. During free time, males will usually go to male-centric businesses and spots, bars and gyms especially, and have hard, rough sex with other males. Even &quot;straight&quot; males have at least once best guy friend who turns into a lifelong lover. Sometimes males will form secondary families with other males, and advance their family circles mostly during these free times. Although, oddly enough, males rarely have secondary family dynamics with females, this is due to females&#39; political hold. But some females still seek out males who are seeking out to start out a secondary dynamic. These other families are not frowned upon as long as primary families don&#39;t become sex starved.<br />
<br />
Females have much easier work, if any at all, allowing for more freedom of thought instead of constant fucking. Females tend to be very sensual with each other, creating emotions that are inspiration for most of human art and culture. Sex takes slightly less importance in females than males, not enough where they can ignore their instinct, but enough where they end up flourishing and shaping all of humankind. Males think they&#39;re in charge, but because of a female&#39;s slight resistant to the instinct, males will cave into a female&#39;s desire and instinct faster than a female would. This makes females the actual controllers of society as males realize that in order to keep their wonderful sex filled life, they have to listen to females always.<br />
<br />
After these 8 hours, every family goes back home, and proceed to fuck each other all evening and night, only to restart this process all over again the next day! Anyone who doesn&#39;t follow the majority of the &quot;straight&quot; lifestyle is labeled as the &quot;queer&quot; lifestyle. The queers are treated equally as straights, they just have different ways of life. Some of those ways of life might be weird to straights, but if they&#39;re happy and having sex, what does it matter? Queers generally have sexualities that don&#39;t fit into the straight lifestyle. For example, if a human has a primary family dynamic that is gay and can&#39;t produce kids between them, those humans are considered queer. The queers have their own functionalities that vary greatly from inner communities and circles. They also usually fill in holes and gaps in the straight society, such as teachers. Gay, lesbian, and transgender related families can adopt children from straight families, which sometimes have so many children, they can&#39;t keep them from being sex starved efficiently enough. Because of this, they can participate in some parts of the straight society, just not all of it. Certain humans that could be considered queer can also live perfectly normal straight lifestyles, ie, two trans humans of opposite types can participate in the majority of the straight society. Intersex humans are guided into the society that fits them the best starting early on in school.<br />
<br />
Speaking of school, kids will go to sexual education school and they will learn everything about sex, every single detail you can even think of. Eight hours of sexual instruction and video watching a day while big, vibrating dildos pound them in their seats so they can pay attention well without their parents. When kids enter puberty, they will be allowed to use social media, which is now used for kids to find other kids to make sexual partners, both major and minor. Most result in straight lifestyle marriages, where the boy knocks up the girl. At their first pregnancy, the teens will read a revolutionary book called &quot;Preparing Their First 30 Days&quot; which is a prep guide for mostly the father to help his future babies be able to hand this sexual society. It&#39;s good for the parents to practice these while they&#39;re still young, because as the male grows older, it&#39;ll be harder to fit into his newborn kids.<br />
<br />
James had no time to even react or think as his world instantly shifted into the new reality, but because of his weird rule to relive this world, he had no idea to expect when he did realize what was happening.</p>
