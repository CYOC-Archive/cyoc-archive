<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ashley looked at the waiting room filled with people to see the first person that wishes to become a hovercar.  That’s when she spotted a woman around her thirties waiting patiently, reading a car magazine.  She has light mocha like skin with a pair of B to C cup breasts and a curvy hourglass figure.  Her arms and legs were long and toned up while she show case it well with her short latex like jacket with her zipper down, revealing her assets and lack of bra and sleeve like straps exposing her shoulders, a tight black latex skirt with strings tied to it to expose her waist skin, and a pair of black high heel shoes with black socks over them.  Her face looked to be pretty with medium blue eyes, oval like structure, long petite nose, and her ears here poking out of her long black hair that goes down to her shoulders and a ponytail.  And the one thing that caught her attention is a black dragon tattoo with the wing spread out to the side located on the left side of her shoulder.  It was obvious that it was Vera, the first patient that wishes to become a car.<br />
<br />
Ashley looked to her and called out her name.  “Vera…  Vera is it?”<br />
<br />
Vera looked up to Ashley and smiled in delight.  “Yes, that’s me.” she said in a sultry and sweet voice.<br />
<br />
Ashley looked to her and smiled back.  “We’ve been expecting you.’ she said to the patient, “Please, follow me.”<br />
<br />
She soon walked away and headed back to the lab while Vera stood up and followed her in.  As they entered the hall, Ashley looked to Vera’s profile and asks her a few questions.<br />
<br />
“Now it says here that you signed up to take part of becoming a car is that you like to be fast.  Is that true?” she asked her.<br />
<br />
Vera nodded and explained her answer.  “Oh, yes it’s true.  Growing up, I always love to go fast.  Whether it be on a hover board, galactic skiing, solar surfing, or even warp biking, I was born for speed.  Then I heard of your program that can turn people into hovercars and I didn’t hesitate in signing up for that.”<br />
<br />
Ashley heard her and finds it strange.  “Yes…  So I heard.  It says here that you have a very stable livelihood.  Graduated in NYU III, you gained degrees in mechanical engineering, maintenance, and manufacturing.  You soon have a job working for a bodywork company, designing, upgrading, and fine-tuning hovercars.  You even got a decent salary and live in a high-rise apartment in New York City III.  Yet of all that, you be throwing your whole entire life away just to become a hovercar and it’s all because you wish to go fast.”<br />
<br />
Vera looked to her curiously and asked, “Is that a problem?”<br />
<br />
Ashley shook her head and continued, “No, no problem at all.  Normally, we would have many people with different reasons on why they want to become hovercars.  Some of those were that they were in debt and cannot recover.  Other times there is a couple what wanted to get divorced, but not wanting to separate.  There will be those that wanted to commit suicide as a quick way without the trouble.  We even had a couple of prisoners that sentenced to life or death penalties.  So we tend to get these bizarre cases here and there.  You are the first that have the weirdest of reasons.  Yet it is understandable like the rest of our patients.”<br />
<br />
Vera heard that and got the message.  “Oh…  I see…”<br />
<br />
Ashley then explained to Vera of the terms and conditions when partaking in a procedure that will permanently change her life.  “Now before we could begin with your change, I need to discuss on the terms and conditions.  By taking part of Innolabs and Souls program, you are hereby obliged in being part of Souls Corporation for the rest of your lives.  When the changes are complete your records will state that you passed away on this day and reborn as a new car in the production line.  While your body and mind will be turned into a car and holo computer, you will retain your memories of your human life before the procedure and your soul will be turned into a hologram to speak to the driver or the passengers and provide them with directions and guidance.  This is one of the reasons why the hovercar dealership motto is a car with a soul.  And if you are damaged and destroyed, Souls and Innolabs is not responsible for any liability you might endure.  Do you understand any of it?”<br />
<br />
Vera heard about the terms and nodded, saying, “If it means that I have to sacrifice to be a vehicle for the rest of my life, then so be it.”<br />
<br />
Ashley heard this and could tell that she was brave in taking part of this procedure.  “You got so much enthusiasm, Vera.” she told her, “Some of our patients would have second thoughts in turning into hovercars.  You are a very brave young woman.”<br />
<br />
The two were silent as they approached the main lab where they will begin the transition from human to car.  By the time they reached the double doors, they opened automatically.  By the time they got in, Vera watched and was in complete awe.  It was a huge warehouse like room filled with multiple domes like structures meant to put people in so they have the room to turn them into hovercars.  One the other side, looked like garage doors with hover trucks on standby as newly created hover cars transferring into the beds to ready their destination.  Up above is a huge canister covering the entire ceiling filled with the liquid nanobots that can turn people into cars.<br />
<br />
Vera looked at all of this and couldn’t believe the lab looks like something she saw during her bodywork job.  Ashley turned to her and told her, “Please, follow me to your designated dome so we could begin the procedure.  This way.”<br />
<br />
By then, Ashley continued to walk to where the procedure would begin.  Vera followed her while looking around to see what she is to expect.  Looking on, she could see the multiple scientists on stand by as they were looking at the small glass on the door where people would come in to begin the change.  By then, she could see one of the people that are changing from midway through.  She could see what looked like a man in his twenties and was enjoying the change so much.  His body was twisting and forming as his face was disfigured, but have a smile signifying that he’s enjoying it.  She could even see the color of his skin darkening to a polish red finish.  Seeing this, it is obvious that the color of the car is going to be what the patient’s favorite color is.  After all, Vera’s favorite color is blue, the same blue as her eyes.  So it is clear that the car she’s going to turn into would be blue.  She just couldn’t wait to experience what the guy is experiencing.<br />
<br />
After a bit of walking, Ashley stopped and turned to her, showing her pod with the door opened for her.  “Here is your pod.  Please step inside so we can begin.”<br />
<br />
Vera looked at the opened pod and wasn’t hesitated in going in.  Once inside, the door closed and sealed behind her as she looked back at it completely locked.  She soon sighed and knew that it was too late to go back.  “No turning back now…” she said to herself.<br />
<br />
She soon heard the sound of noises coming from the speakers before the voice of Ashley on the loud speaker.<br />
<br />
“Please step into the center so we can begin.”<br />
<br />
Vera heard that and obeyed, approaching the center of the room.  Walking towards the center, she could see that the room was plain white and had nothing special about it.  Of course, this is just a dome for her to remain comfortable.  The one thing that is different is the drainage system in the middle, obvious disposing the organs once liquefy and above it is a syringe like arm beginning to fill with nanobots from the canister on the ceiling.  As soon as she approached the center, Ashley’s voice came out again through the intercom.<br />
<br />
“Now please remove your clothes and toss them into the incinerator next to you.  We can’t have your clothes get torn off during the change.”<br />
<br />
Vera heard that and knew that it was inevitable.  A small compartment opened up and a tube like trash can stick up with an opening on the top.  Slowly, she unzipped her jackets and slipped her skirt down, removing her shoes and socks and taking out any then that’s left on her skin.  Gathering them together in a ball, she tossed them into the tube as the clothes went into the incinerator, burning away to nothing.   She now stood completely naked as the tube descended downward.  Once that was taken care of, Ashley was at the observation window and would watch the changes to see if there are any set backs or anomalies that would be an issue.<br />
<br />
“I’m going to begin administering the namnites into your body.  There might be some slight discomfort after the injection.  Remember that it is normal as they will be liquefying your organs before changing your body.  You will remain alive after the first stage of the process, so try to relax.”<br />
<br />
Vera nodded and said, “Sacrificing my organs to become the one thing I like the most?  I can get use to that.  Start the injection already!  I can’t wait any longer!”<br />
<br />
Ashley smiled and could tell that she’s anxious in removing her humanity to be a hovercraft vehicle.  So with a push of the button, the syringe started to lower to Vera’s arm and slowly thrust forward.  She could feel the sting as the nanobots started to inject right into the bloodstream and quickly spreading across, her body.  Vera felt tingly from the shot and was a little woozy after it.  Ashley looked to this and told her to stay still.<br />
<br />
“Please remain on the drainage pipe.  Once your organs liquefy, it will all come out of her vagina.  The last thing I want is the janitor wiping up the remains of your body parts.”<br />
<br />
Vera heard that and tries to remain still over the drain.  As she was doing that, she started to feel quizy as the nanites spread all over her body.  In her body, her organs were melting away like ice cream on a warm day and were turning into water.  Even her heart slowly beats until it dies off once it melted away and her lungs filled with water.  She can no longer breathe or produce blood, yet she was still alive and was aware with what’s going on.  Rubbing her now melted stomach, she was on the verge of pissing and pissing she did.  Bending down in a squat position, her pussy spewed out multi color goo that was once her organs and poured like a waterfall in the drain.  She soon emptied out a part of her and it became nothing more then a tinkle.  Once it was all gone, her vagina lips sealed up like a zipper and vanished away, leaving her privates literally bare.  Vera looked down to see and rub her blank privates and looked to the see-through window were Ashley was observing.  She looked to this to and told her it was nothing.<br />
<br />
“Don’t worry, that’s normal.  Once all of her organs have liquefied and poured into the drainage system, your privates, by that a boy or a girl, will zip or flatten to be completely bare.  It is a known fact that you don’t need your pussy when becoming a car.”<br />
<br />
Vera heard her and knew she had a point.  She’s going to be permanently a hovercar and cars don’t need privates after all.  She start to feel slightly bloated and looked to herself to see that her breasts and hips started to widen, while her arms and legs started to loose tone and became skinning.  The nails on her toes popped off and lay on the floor they each digit of her feet merged together and became one appendage.  Her fingernails popped off as well and grew long and spindly.  She flexed each finger and marveled at how long they were.  Looking down at her breasts, they kept on expanding and grew beyond D cups.  But then, she noticed the strangest thing out there.  Her expanding nipples started to cave in and went inward while her breasts kept growing.  Looking down, she could see that fence like lines on the former nipples.  The same can be said with the sides of her front hips as they bloated a little and small holes opened up and the same fence like diamonds appeared there.  Rubbing her expanding breasts, she knew what they are.  They were over jets that every hover car has to flying around the cityscape.<br />
<br />
“It’s really happening!” Vera said as her voice started to sound metallic, “I’m going to become a hovercar!”<br />
<br />
Looking at herself, she could see that she’s loosing more and more of her humanity.  Small lines started to appear on her stomach, on four sides of the hover jets, and below her eyes.  Her face started to look cartoonish with her eyes enlarging and shows a glowing tint to it.  Her ears started to get pointy and were sticking out to the side of her head.  Her skin started to darken slightly and was showing a shiny tint to it.  Even her hair, which was growing down her back, merge together strand by strand while a bang came down between her eyes and was smoothing over her back, almost taking the resemblance of glass.  Vera marveled herself as the changes and was getting hard to stand with her weaker legs.  She quickly went down to her knees and marveled at the changes.<br />
<br />
Ashley observed her enjoyment to and was amazed that she’s easily accepting her fate as a hovercar for life.  But looking on, she can tell that it was getting impossible for her to stand.  So getting on the telecom, she told her…<br />
<br />
“You’re coming along really nicely, Vera.  Might I suggest that you start laying on your front?  You knees are weakening and it will be a matter of time before you fall.”<br />
<br />
Vera heard her and decided to lie down on her front, to prevent from falling down.  Lying down, she soon realized that it felt natural being on this position.  She still has the time in looking at herself to see what else has changed.  The lines were spreading more as her skin took a metallic gray hue with little resemblance of her human skin.  Her body expanded and shifted around, widening and growing into the proper vehicle height.  Her former nipples were enlarging to cover her former breasts, which were flattening to oval like spheres along with the front sides of her hips.  She could see her legs rising up and her feet connecting together, merging into something, but she doesn’t know what.  Still, she’ll wait and see what happens next.  Her arms and hands started to thin to the extreme, making them look paper thin, yet she still flexed them as they moved natural.  She could see a few growths coming from her lower back, forming archways with an opening close to her butt.  That led to growing hair coming through the arch and the end opening, slowly slipping in with a few strands sticking out.  The rest of her hair on the top smoothes over as those strands merged into four wide ones and was smoothing into glass.  Her face was nearly inhuman with wider cartoonish brighter eyes and her nose shrank away and flattened in the middle of her face.  The ears on the side of her head extended to the sides and shaped into what looked like review mirrors as reflected glass grew around the borders of the ears and sealed up completely.<br />
<br />
As that happened, her sense of sound started to fade until she can barely hear at all.  “Ashley…” she said as her voice was half female and human and the half metallic and robotic, “I can barely hear anything.  Is that normal?”<br />
<br />
Ashley chuckled a little and said back, “Yes, that’s normal.  I choosing to become part of the Soul line, you have to loose any and all human qualities and senses, that include your sense of hearing.  Besides, you won’t be needing it when you’re a hovercar.  Trust me, it will all be worth it.”<br />
<br />
Vera nodded, even if she rarely hear her, and let the changes flow through her body.  Her arms weakened as she fell on her chin, but the arms held for support, but they were shifting and folding, with her thin fingers curling into blocky stubs and four little holes opened on the elbow areas.  She peeked up to her body and could see it moving and shaping, stretching out jutting up in the middle like a camel hump.  The hover jets merged within the car body as her breasts were completely flat and non-existent.  Her legs and feet were completely merge and melded into each other, shaping into what looks like the car’s tail that should be built for aerodynamics.  Her skin darkened more of a blue like hint while her human skin color faded more and more.  All of her hair reached the end of the opening near her but and smoothed over, with little lines of what was her hair left.  Two blue stubs came out of the archway the sides of the front and slowly spread close to each other.  Her face is widening to match her car body with the eyes getting wider and thinner and the review mirror ears pulling back.<br />
<br />
Vera kept on watching the changes and marveled at how alien she looked.  But she wanted to become a hovercar as a way speed around.  As she was looking, her vision started to get a little blurry and that nearly startled her.  “Hey!  What gives?” she asked in a more robotic and less human voice, “I’m having trouble seeing my body.”<br />
<br />
Ashley could see that and told her through the comm. speaker, “Relax…  You are just loosing your sight from the change.  It’s natural, as hovercars don’t need to see.  It is one of the many things that need to be sacrificed when joining our program.  Rest assure, that when the changes are complete, you mind will turn into an onboard computer and that you will be able to see and hear things when your soul is transferred into a holographic AI.  Once you are turned on of course.  You just need to wait until the buyer picks you so you can see the end results.”<br />
<br />
Vera rarely heard her, but could guess that she is loosing her sight, as her irises were getting smaller and flatter.  Still, she will savor every moment of it as the last of her humanity stripped away to give her a chance to be a hover car forever.  The bodywork was almost finished widening and expanding, as she was nearly finished in being a vehicle form.  The remainder of her human skin color was gone and in its place is metal blue, Vera’s favorite color.  Already, she had no breasts, just stubs that contains wide hover jets along with the sides of her hips as the jet parts dominated the bottom end.  The legs and feet finished forming, as they become a tail end of the vehicle.  Even her arms were widening and flattening to form a front bumper with four lines spreading and deepening into air vents with her fingers were nothing but stub squares as a way in connecting.  The lines on the side of her former hair connected and what’s left of her hair smoothed away and was now a shapely dome like glass.  Her face was nearly complete as the glowing eyes thinning and widening with a sharp curve on both ends forming.  Her pupils were getting smaller and her sight was diminishing.  Her mouth was getting smaller as she uttered her final words.<br />
<br />
“I don’t care what you said!” she said as her voice was completely robotic, “This is what I truly wanted!  I don’t want to live a boring human life!  I feel the need, the need for spee1110010010001001001”<br />
<br />
Her English language was replaced with binary, as her mouth grew too small.  At the same time, the square stubs that where once her fingers connected together and sealed up completely, finally forming into a bumper.  The pupils in her eyes popped out of existence, blinding her completely as the eyes themselves thinned into a pair of slick designed headlights.<br />
<br />
After minutes of changes, Vera, the human, was no more.  In her place is a sleek feminine like sports hovercar.  Her body type was sexy looking based on her former human persona and a large glass like dome from the front to back with a sharp point at the front side with the inside containing seats and a digital console.  The only thing resembled her human side was her tattoo on the now left side of the hover jet, acting now as a decal for the ride.<br />
<br />
Ashley watched it all go down from the safety of her observation and felt a little turned on by the change.  But she needed to act professional, as she was satisfied at the end result.  “Yet ‘nother satisfying customer.” She said as she moved to the next subject for the change.  But what will become of the new Soul’s Vera?</p>
