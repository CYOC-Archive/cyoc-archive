<br />
The twins had split up as soon as entering the foyer under the gaze of the giant entryway <br />
statue. Gissele and Gretchen had gone off to the Omega's chambers (right next to the cub's <br />
joint room) in search of their father, while their half-sisters Laura and Zulema went with <br />
Mary where their noses told them their mother and auntie would be. <br />
<br />
As the golden pair ran back to where their mother was, the pair chatted among <br />
themselves. Gretchen being on her pedestal as Gissele was her chain in reality.  <br />
<br />
The pair was honestly confused at how passive their mother had been with them before <br />
going outside, barely able to understand how tired and worn out she had been. <br />
<br />
While none of the twins born from the omegas had the extra limbs they should have, <br />
Zulema had often wondered if that was because they were twins and had started out with <br />
an extra of everything but then had split in half. This theory was actually a little comforting <br />
to the twins. Like any children, being so radically different from their parents was as <br />
discomforting as it was awkward. Laura and Zulema wondered if they had a triplet <br />
somewhere their mother had never told them about to explain why there was only two of <br />
them but their mother had three of everything. In spite of addressing their mother in <br />
singular, many had concluded that Joy and Ingrid's three heads were three servers <br />
connected to the same network... unlike the heads of the other Shiva wolves whom were <br />
two terminals connected to a singular server. <br />
<br />
Gretchen looked at all the letters next to the names on the name plaque of the various <br />
rooms. <br />
<br />
Gretchen said, &quot;If I'm ever Alpha Female, the first thing I'm doing to putting the rank <br />
system back in... if this keeps up we'll be no different from humans.&quot; That Bart had used <br />
her father as a puppet had done nothing to not discouraged Gretchen's dream of usurping <br />
Jenny throne as 'Princess of the Pack.' <br />
<br />
Gissele asked her sister, &quot;That's a bad thing? Being more similar to humans?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's good to be unique isn't it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We're twins.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Never mind.&quot; <br />
<br />
That was when the two golden pups came in on their restored father, mother, and their <br />
two step-fathers, in the middle of hot passionate love making... <br />
<br />
++++++++<br />
<br />
Alice and Abbey stood back as they watched the quadruplets use the power was that so <br />
much like their own, only it worked in the outside world and not just in the reality inside <br />
mirrors.  Surprising everyone except the glass pups, the cubs proved to not agitated the <br />
fawn or does...  After all, cubs didn't hunt, and there was no smell of their mother... and <br />
cubs who did not use even a fraction of stealth while hunting were likely too stupid to be <br />
much of a threat. <br />
<br />
The seven and a half year old Alice, and the five year old Abbey watched carefully as the <br />
eight and three month year olds made their way to the does. Of course Marcine and the <br />
others had seen their mates got into the water and not come out, though they also knew <br />
they had been taken by the glass pups into a mirror and had come out the water before. <br />
They weren't stupid after all.  Golden Deer looked at white-tails and their other 'cousins' <br />
the way lupmens did wolves, leomens did lions and humans did apes... Leomens and <br />
Lupmens could have a basic dialogue with their non-sapient 'cousins' and humans could <br />
teach a chimp a few basic words and a gorilla sign language, but that didn't mean they saw <br />
those creatures as people. <br />
<br />
The average Golden Deer option of a white-tail was likewise 'stupid, greedy, cowardly, and <br />
did I mention stupid?' <br />
<br />
But while a few lupmens and leomens were vegetarians, (and seen as completely bonkers <br />
and living an unhealthy lifestyle) the Golden Deer both as individuals and as a unified whole <br />
could not comprehend even the idea, let alone the concept of not being prey. It was <br />
completely alien and for them a sign of insanity. Dying of old age was incomprehensible, <br />
death by claws and fangs a fact of life. And like humans who advocated death in of itself as <br />
part of life (or at least something to keep species from stopping reproduction to insure <br />
genes were always being shuffled and enable natural selection to allow a species to adapt <br />
to a forever changing environment), Golden Deer likewise had death by the hands of <br />
predators integrated into the the foundation of their very social structure!  <br />
<br />
The gargoyles stood ready, their duty was to protect the pack after all, and by extension <br />
their guests and immediate allies, thus Frontdoor and the other grotesques were ready to <br />
swoop down in a moment's notice to sweep up the cubs if the Golden Deer decided to <br />
crack in their skulls (the use of the words 'gargoyles' and 'grotesques' had been one of the <br />
many divergences in the Colonial and British English languages).   They were to follow with <br />
Alice and Abbey once the Herd had gone through to where the majority of the Pack waited. <br />
<br />
The purple Ulysses didn't like this, he felt it was his responcibility to do this, sacred or not <br />
and being the second youngest of the teen wolves or not, (with only Amber being younger, <br />
a fact she absolutely hated, in particular due to her short hight being mistaken for a cub by <br />
people who didn't know her).  Robyn and Maxine didn't mind not having to work, but did <br />
feel having the cubs do this was crazy. Caroline/Cobalt herself was worried for the cubs <br />
but she and Opal stood back.  The rest of the teen wolves of course obeyed Robert and the <br />
other gallery wolves orders to merely be on stand by as the cubs now tried their hands at <br />
peacefully helping the does back to the manor. <br />
<br />
While Nane didn't show it, she wanted -off- of this island as soon as people, the images of <br />
seeing her mother's lifeless body sharp in her memory.  Moja, still remembering the <br />
original timeline somewhat, wondered if when their mothers' souls were divided up, if they <br />
had been sent back in time to the quadruplets' conceptions, 'Then again, life is <br />
complicated enough, no need to add time travel to the whole mess, and these memories <br />
that are appearing in place of Mama-Elise's don't have me or my sisters acting like soulless <br />
sociopaths...' <br />
<br />
Nane approached a gold deer named Midge (as all first females of her line had been named <br />
for three hundred years), who was mated to a buck named Dick... Nane had a -very- <br />
surprising amount of self control when she chose to use it...  She came, her claws seethed, <br />
in the most non-theatening non-offenseive manner imaginable, she slowly, -very- slowly, <br />
came up the doe, making soothing, peaceful noises reaching out with the palm of her <br />
forepaw... This was not hunting behavior in the least. Brushing against the doe's side, <br />
(feeling something kick within) she began to walk along side it still touching it take one <br />
step at a time, &quot;One, two, three...&quot; And both were gone. Nane, doe, and fawn. <br />
<br />
This sent some shock-waves through the does as the other cubs took some steps back. <br />
<br />
&quot;Midge is perfectly fine!&quot; Alice said, &quot;Midge is perfectly fine! Miss Midge is by now back at <br />
Wolf Estate with Dick and the rest of the Herd's bucks! There is no reason for you to panic.&quot; <br />
Alice said. <br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, yeah, it's okay.&quot; Said the teenage Robyn having no clue if the walking venison knew <br />
what Robyn was saying or not. <br />
<br />
Tom's mate, Nancy, with Saba was next. The dirty red cub inched towards the due, with her <br />
paws exposed and her belly out to show she trusted Nancy. Thankfully culture clash didn't <br />
result in anything bloody. &quot;Okay Madam, okay, it's all right, now just trust me just for a <br />
moment, just this moment, an you'll be back with Tom in no time, okay? One, two, three.&quot; <br />
<br />
Veronica and Betty were taken at the same time now that a slight level of trust was being <br />
established by Sita and Tano at the same time... honestly the pair wouldn't have minded <br />
going into the mirror verse via the ocean, but they had promised to help speed up the <br />
process and they did just that. This process continued until each of the cubs had taken a <br />
doe with them. <br />
<br />
A minute later the cubs returned ready for more. The cycle repeated, also taking the <br />
occasional fawn, being double sure they weren't separated from their mother... parental <br />
abandonment being another alien concept to the Golden Deer like dying of old age or living <br />
without predators, but at the same time there was a deep seated fear of it, of parent and <br />
child being torn apart by forces they couldn't control, almost like a genetic memory.  <br />
Biologists pointed out the sheer illogic of this, better to breed another day then to lose <br />
one's life for a child who would die anyway after the predator had their way with the <br />
parent... but like mating for life and accepting into their family a fawn that wasn't theirs, <br />
the Golden Deer did many things that contradicted the supreme goal of survival (much like <br />
man). <br />
<br />
Finally all that remained on the island was Marcine, the Prime Doe, the one to whom all <br />
females turned to just as all the bucked turned to her mate Jack. It hadn't felt the same <br />
with Jack gone without Eve to speak to. <br />
<br />
Marcine didn't trust these wolves that walked upright at all, and she didn't trust these lions <br />
that walked upright either, anymore than she trusted the naked Sasquatch. And most of <br />
all, she didn't forgive them for killing Eve and Eve Jr ... that all parties involved had been <br />
entranced by Kurse at the time didn't really register in her brain. <br />
<br />
Alice however was a very observative girl, it was only proper to go hand in hand with being <br />
curious. And she knew the English Language better than seemingly anyone... most put it on <br />
how she didn't need to sleep while in the outside world and could spend entire nights <br />
reading when she snuck out past Marthy's security (which wasn't all that hard for a girl who <br />
could pass through any smooth, flat, reflective surface).   Ironically packmates and pride <br />
members were less uncomfortable around this living piece of glass and her half-sisters <br />
than they were of a pair of twins who had no such ability to cheat sleep and yet at age nine <br />
were geniuses in regards to economics and law... <br />
<br />
And Alice, knowing enough about the deer to even KNOW THEIR NAMES, could see in <br />
Marcine's body language what the Prime Doe intended.  She put a clear glass paw on <br />
Mbili's shoulder. <br />
<br />
&quot;Mbili, do not try to take like Marcine like you did the other does. She will hurt you, <br />
because she wants to hurt back right now, I can see it. Please allow myself and my sister to <br />
take her like we did Jack and the other bucks.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mbili stared at her, &quot;How... how can you tell that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hurting the next cub that comes close to her is what she is saying.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She's not saying anything, she's a deer.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes she is. Not all words are formed from sound and letters. And Marcine can not use <br />
letters or our sounds, so she uses other ways to speak.&quot; Alice said simply. <br />
<br />
Mbili had to ask, &quot;How can you talk about her kindly like that? Last month you invited us <br />
into the mirror world and we ate the hind leg of her sister... &quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Predators is what we are. Prey is what they are. Neither of us judge each other for being <br />
what we are. Or at least, I do not judge them, and Jack does not judge us. We are both just <br />
doing what comes natural, doing our hardest to survive.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mbili stared at the girl who was nine months her minor. &quot;Alice.. you scared me sometimes.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alice hugged her. It never stopped being a unique feeling, that smooth, room temperature, <br />
moving glass against her body. &quot;Thank you Mbili for being honest. One has to say what <br />
they mean if they are to mean what they say.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alice and Abbey together came up to Marcine, who knew better than to try and harm these <br />
glass wolves, the last deer that had had ended up with a broken leg. <br />
<br />
&quot;It's okay Miss Marcine, you're going to be with Jack in a bit.&quot; Abbey promised. <br />
<br />
The two led Marcine into the even reflective water and she entered the universe within all <br />
mirrors and was dressed up like a horse with a hitch for pulling along a carriage. Marcine <br />
remembered this from last time and did her best to ignore it, these were things of <br />
civilization, something the Golden Deer as a point of pride never ever sought to be part of. <br />
<br />
After taking three steps, the were in what somewhat resembled the giant backyard of the <br />
mansion but with trees looking much younger and some trees with square-roots and a <br />
number of Epileptic Trees discussing various conspiracy theories (mostly concerning <br />
squirrels and the US postal service), and finally some trees looking to have been imported <br />
from Mexico wearing boxing gloves ready to sock it to it anyone who came at them with an <br />
axe or to do their business.  Marcine did not even try to comprehend the Mexican Fighting <br />
Trees.  The way the grass was two different shades of green like a chess board wasn't even <br />
something she noticed or would have understood. <br />
<br />
A minute later Alice and Abbey led Marcine out of the mirror and back out into the other <br />
universe that all others called home. She instantly smell and saw her Herd and mate. Jack <br />
and Marcine instantly nuzzled each other. It was very very good to be home!  The island <br />
didn't really look that bad when they arrived even if it was totally alien, and under Kurse it <br />
became an aimless, chaotic warped parody... but afterwards it still looked very strange... <br />
but not all that awful either... but at the end... this was there home, and they wouldn't have <br />
it any other way. <br />
<br />
Alice and Abbey looked at each other satisfied promised themselves to remember to thank <br />
Tano, Moja and their sisters for all their hard work, and went back into the mirror world <br />
that was their home to travel back to Big Bad Island. <br />
<br />
The gray and black Iota-Robert called out to his fellow gallery wolves and the teen wolves <br />
and the gargoyles, &quot;Okay! That's it packmates! Let's back it in and go home as soon as he <br />
girls are back!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;FINALLY!&quot; Declared Maxine, having used all her will power along with Robyn to hold onto <br />
remembering their adult selves long enough that they could tease Millie about. &quot;That girl <br />
better still remember her old, adult, whatever version of her when we get there...&quot; Said <br />
Maxine, &quot;It would be too much fun lost if she's already forgotten.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We ain't gonna really rememba' dis here fun eitha after ar' memories fade ya know sistah.&quot; <br />
Robyn pointed out causing the other teen wolves to look at them oddly. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah but it'll be a great last hurray for the big guy upstairs or whoever remembers <br />
everything that's never happened girfriend!&quot; <br />
<br />
Ulysses was looking foreword to a long nap, and his best friend Mary and and his 'not <br />
everything is about blood' sister Sarah.   <br />
<br />
Coral, Tourmaline, Ruby &amp; Emerald, Amber were also looking foreword to some well earned <br />
sleep.  Opal with Caroline/Colbalt likewise were glade to just get through this okay. Garnet <br />
was actually tempted to stay on the island, but the duty to the pack came first... <br />
<br />
The gargoyles didn't care one way or another, weather at the island or the estate their <br />
purpose remained the same... protect the pack. <br />
<br />
The gallery wolves wondered how their artistic companions were doing. Rose just hoped <br />
everyone would be awake enough for 'pink wolves-only game night' she had been told <br />
about. Of course Maxine had to promise Pearl repeatedly that they didn't do anything to <br />
Zelipe... <br />
<br />
++++++<br />
<br />
No one gave Amy, Penny, or Kirk much attention as the four adopted siblings were <br />
distracted by their seemingly futile game to score a bull's eye with their squirt gun on the <br />
fountain heads while Amethyst watched them, Whitney kept one eye but not really listening <br />
in on Amy and the two lions, and Mr. P of course watching over the lot of them. <br />
<br />
Amy told Jenny all Amy knew, about the changes in reality, about the bloody fight, no, war, <br />
at Big Bad Island, some of it was recap, some of it was not. The mutation of the yacht <br />
passengers including their children. Fox and Elise's self sacrifice. The birth of Moja, Tano, <br />
and their sisters when Fox and Elise realized they couldn't go back to being individuals. <br />
The destruction of the witches' combined shade Kurse by Trevor, Father Paul, and Amy. <br />
And in the aftermath of that much chaos, reality itself coming down hard to ensure that <br />
the laws of cause and effect were obeyed along with one basic law, if something existed, it <br />
therefore had to have existed. <br />
<br />
Amy showed Jenny the scroll Amy was writing, in her own blood, the only medium she <br />
could trust. <br />
<br />
Kirk didn't look so good.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sorry, but I sensed you wanted to know the truth before who you were faded <br />
completely.&quot; Amy said. <br />
<br />
Kirk looking a little green said, &quot;Thank you and all but... but -children- were mutated by <br />
some witch's ghost?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ghost implies spirit or soul, this thing was even less than that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's not the point!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know, I am sorry, I think I've been hanging along side Alice too long.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Children, dammit, -children-!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Unlike the movies, children are not immune to the zombie plague or spontaneously vanish <br />
as soon as the vampire invade... all the chaos used by Kurse is now being filtered through <br />
Marie into Big Bad Island...&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;So...&quot; Penny asked, &quot;Reality itself, is fixing itself up so all of us were -born- as what we are <br />
and for there to be a logical reason behind it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;As far as magic itself can be logical yes. Your power and mine is from our families <br />
spending generations in a town so deeply saturated with magic it's been absorbed into <br />
some families' genomes. The power of Martha-San's dance under a full moon, and that of <br />
her fellow Omegas, and Alice and her sisters' forms. I'm not sure what logic reality has <br />
created for Marie being the way she is.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;What's to keep her from becoming just another wicked witch? From what I understand you <br />
remember being you-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You are always you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Point is that you remember being, okay the old you, but you've got to know you can't trust <br />
that kind of power in an adult's hands let alone a child.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I agree. And so does Marie, I don't know how to explain it better than, she got a look into <br />
the eye of truth.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That makes no sense.&quot;<br />
<br />
Amy bowed, &quot;Gomennasai. I did not say it would Penny-San.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Then why say it at all?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Because it needed to be said.&quot; <br />
<br />
 &quot;So how long?&quot; Penny asked. &quot;Before I forget being me? And don't start the 'self is self' <br />
shtick again.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Gomennasai. You were delayed in the changing of your memories because of how far <br />
away you were from the rest of the pride... now that you've come this close, the process <br />
will be significantly sped up... I'm not sure if I shall remember anymore than you, since <br />
both our powers effect existence... which means using them now while things are in flux <br />
could cause existence to simply reject us as a lost cause and we'd all have never been <br />
born.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kirk had to ask, &quot;What about me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;.... you'll forget before Penny does, since you don't have the power she does...&quot; <br />
<br />
Penny cringed, as did Kirk, if they were going to forget, she was hoping they could at least <br />
forget together. <br />
<br />
Kirk smelled it first, &quot;I smell deer.... lots of them... they're... gold deer? ... How do I know <br />
what those are?&quot;<br />
<br />
Amy sighed, &quot;Those would be originally two of the yard workers employed by the smiths <br />
before Jensen and Kaylee began mutating the staff... they were to create an independent <br />
food source for the pack, now they provide for the Pride and Pack with their numbers.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait... so if reality is making it all the same... all as 'ever was then'...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, those two people, Jack and Marcine are their names... have always been nothing more <br />
than food animals...&quot;<br />
<br />
 Penny just stared out into the void in her wheel chair for half a minute, no expression, on <br />
he face, then she began to whisper, &quot;It's not fair, it's not fair! IT'S NOT FAIR! <br />
ITSNOTFAIR~!!!&quot; Penny roared.<br />
<br />
That got EVERYONE'S attention! A grown woman even when she was on the mend from a <br />
crippling injury, didn't begin roaring 'it's not fair' at the top of her lungs out of the blue. <br />
<br />
Amy quickly turned around to her fellow naked wolf people, &quot;Gomennasai. I told her about <br />
Elise and Fox...&quot; Not technically a lie, as she had, just not in the discussion that had led to <br />
Penny's outrage. <br />
<br />
Amy looked back at the crippled but still growling lioness, Kirk looking a bit scared of <br />
Penny for a moment. <br />
<br />
&quot;Your absolutely positively right,&quot; Amy said daring to put a paw on her side, &quot;It's not fair. <br />
Not in the least. But the world has never been fair, take it from someone whose lived three <br />
life times....&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You don't think I don't know that brat-?! I'm a cop!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I apologize Penny-San.&quot; Amy bowed, &quot;I meant no dishonor. And I didn't meant to <br />
downplay the wrongness of this, but this is the only life any of the Golden Deer have ever <br />
known.. and neither of our power will work on them... reality won't let us! It would be like <br />
rejecting a transfusion... I am sorry if that barely makes sense. Reality is too injured as it is <br />
to accept any more radical changes... Jack and Marcine's lines of Golden Deer have already <br />
been hardwired into the curse's own origin...And the Herd itself wired into the existence of <br />
the pride and pack... as the pride's existence reaches backwards slowly through time. I am <br />
sorry Penny-San, I am truly sorry. But, as a cop, I know you know, there are wrongs you <br />
can't right... and when you try to, you often create seven wrongs for the right you undid... <br />
making the Golden Deer mindless animals now would be wrong, but making them have <br />
hands and speak would fatally injure reality around Glendale destroying it... I am greatly <br />
sorry.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Every intentional revision to reality I've made has spawned an equal and opposite <br />
reaction.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It undoes itself?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, what I am saying Penny-San is that any changes to existence have a ripple effect! To <br />
sum it up, EVERYTHING has it's prince Penny-San. I used my power to restore Bart and <br />
Jenny's shadows, and reality made sure to assimilate them into the wolf pack's existence in <br />
the most effective, most direct way possible, using them nearly as raw material to cover up <br />
any 'plots holes' by the reality warping of the game.&quot; <br />
<br />
Penny turned away from Amy, she then looked at the male leoman next to her. <br />
<br />
Penny said to her fiancee, &quot;Kirk, Tell me about when we first met...&quot; <br />
<br />
Kirk opened his mouth, then looked confused, hesitated, then spoke, &quot;I think I came to see <br />
a Rodeo with my family, I remember being bored out of my skull, wishing I was at home <br />
watching My Little Pony... and a little boy was next to us jumping and cheering at the horse <br />
back riding...  Or... was I the little boy sulking thinking how horses weren't interesting <br />
unless you were eating them?... &quot; <br />
<br />
Penny realized to her dismay that Kirk was having trouble remembering being Katy... or <br />
human. Penny ran though her own memories... she remembered the bloody fight with the <br />
wolves clear enough (if it could be called that) ... But also she now had a memory of <br />
crawling streaking blood across the floor managing to touch shaking finger tips to five <br />
statues of her pack mates whispering, &quot;You are  leomen, always and forever.&quot; Her extended <br />
claws just barely able to touch the toe of the lioness statue of Mal'akh before passing out. <br />
She remembered the doctor doing scans to make sure she had not suffered internal <br />
bleeding that was going to kill her in two day after her release from the hospital (it had <br />
happened to a toddler Penny had read about once). <br />
<br />
She also remembered a chat between MJ and Wanda Alpha-Kaylee developing a fetish for <br />
souled statues, apparently Alpha-Kaylee was entranced by the idea of art that could think <br />
about the audience as much as the audience could think about the art. One had one white <br />
and red male wolf and four positively absurdly breasted Hokkaido she-wolves, in to <br />
demonstrate their loyalty to their Alpha Female used the game to turn themselves into solid <br />
gold statues. Since they had willingly and knowingly done to it themselves, were legally <br />
sane, and their souls were still there (Penny couldn't remember who or how THAT had been <br />
determined) it couldn't be precisely called suicide and actually was labeled under <br />
'performance art.' <br />
<br />
Amy remembered herself and Zelipe being told of their power by Moja and Amy convincing <br />
Zelipe (that boy needed more backbone) to undo their 'lifetime performance art' ...  and <br />
getting an ear full from Yamato about not respecting their wishes... but this was all quickly <br />
push aside when it was realized Amy and Zelipe's power could be used on UNWILLING <br />
victims of the curse just as easily! <br />
<br />
And the same day, Penny remembered Tano sensing and telling Penny about a power <br />
similar to Amy and Zelipe that Penny had picked up from her family's long stay in this <br />
magic saturated town much like Zack, Pearl and June's lines.  And what shocked Penny <br />
more than anything, was that KNEW who Tano was! She remembered being so proud of <br />
Fox. <br />
<br />
&quot;Kirk, take me over there and let's lay down.&quot; Penny said simply. Kirk complied and lifted <br />
her up.  Amy knew when to back off. <br />
<br />
Carrying her own wheel chair as Kirk carried her in his arms by her own instruction, Kirk <br />
laid down in the shade beneath one of the crab apple trees, Penny in his lab her wheel <br />
chair close by. <br />
<br />
&quot;Kirk... hug me, feel the base of my tail, feel my lionesshood, feel my breasts, stay close to <br />
me... and keep telling me your name from before you were a statue and then things about <br />
your life until I tell you to stop.&quot; <br />
<br />
Deep down somewhere Kirk understood, when the last trace of Kathy ever having existed <br />
was gone and only the male lion Kirk remained, Penny would ask him to stop.<br />
<br />

<br />
Casandra and Lilly had no idea their mother was now free of being Bart and Jenny's <br />
puppets along with the other omegas... or that she hadn't BEEN their mother until time <br />
space and shuffled the deck to allow the twins to have an existence to accommodate the <br />
inescapable truth that they DID exist, let alone the fact that until a few days before <br />
yesterday they had been one person and had been a male day worker... <br />
<br />
Lawrence asked, &quot;So they were still under the concept everything they were doing was for <br />
the better? And that they were saving children from being adults, and adults from being <br />
adults?&quot; <br />
<br />
The black and red dressed Marie looked the muscular white wolf in the eyes saying, &quot;They <br />
always were. Up until they were hung and spat the game out at Marie Cruz and her four <br />
teammates, the three of them and their familiars all believed they were saving children and <br />
grown up children from the world of adults.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Being adults isn't THAT bad is it?&quot; Casandra asked sounding concerned.<br />
<br />
&quot;No.&quot; Betty said, &quot;I won't say being a child isn't nice... this world is still pure to you, you <br />
don't see things in this world yet that aren't so beautiful... that's how nostalgia works, <br />
people think back to the good old days because being children meant they see the world <br />
as a kinder, simpler place.&quot;  Betty put a paw on both the twins shoulders, being an adult <br />
being taking responsibility, it means giving back to the world that's given to you. It means <br />
accepting the consequences of your own actions,  it also means getting to shape the world <br />
for the next generation.&quot; Casandra and Lilly looked at each other, barely getting anything <br />
of what Betty said. <br />
<br />
Marie said, &quot;Marie Cruz said something very similar to Gaal when the witch gave her <br />
justification for what she did when the two faced each other for the final time not counting <br />
the witches' trial and execution. But like I said, we're a whiles off from that.&quot; <br />
<br />
Lawrence asked, &quot;So next the changed the Wises? The people who gave their grandmother <br />
a job and them a home?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They were prejudice to the native American, same as many, but deep down they were <br />
decent people, and the witchlings say their actions purely as an act of kindness.&quot; <br />
<br />
Betty asked darkly, &quot;Like the innocent children they made into deer and statues?&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Marie shrugged, &quot;They're better off than most living art victims who aren't killed when their <br />
bodies are turned to stone or another medium. Most wallow in agony or go mad. They're at <br />
least happy and content with their existence opposed to most who know what's been <br />
robbed from them.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Not that they know any better.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not that they know any better.&quot; Marie echoed back simply offering no retort. &quot;The witches <br />
only real regret was that they hadn't figure out a way to permanently remain children <br />
themselves while keeping their power...&quot; <br />
<br />
+++++++<br />
<br />
They small coven of three waited till Mr. Running-Bear took the girls into town on one of <br />
their routine trips. In spite of being with three European girls, no one questioned him, those <br />
that tried to didn't get far enough to ask and instead walked away with a glassy look in <br />
their eyes finding it all normal, yes, finding it all normal, yes, finding it all normal, yes, <br />
finding it all normal, etc. <br />
<br />
It was now the year of our lord 1673 and Gita was now nine years old closing in on ten. <br />
Their mother was gone. Their grandmother was gone. Sickness having taken their father <br />
and grandfather.  It was like the &quot;Great Mortality&quot; itself carried something with it that was <br />
not natural, (it would not be called the Black Death for another two hundred years).  The <br />
combined power the girls had from doing precisely what their mother had warmed them <br />
not to was staggering. Of course they had princess filtering the chaos for them still... but <br />
there was much to be done... &quot;Yes, much to be done.&quot; Goldwyn said. <br />
<br />
Goldwyn let Princess loose, of course this meant the girls would be plain as day to notice <br />
with anyone with working eyeballs... but Princess had to keep Mr. Running-Bear busy while <br />
the girl gave the gift to the Wises that the girls had given their sons. <br />
<br />
Princess let herself be sensed by Joseph Running-Bear after letting herself be a bit of <br />
distance between herself and her master. <br />
<br />
When Mr. Running-Bear sensed what he did from the winds he frowned. This didn't feel <br />
right, nor did it feel good.  He looked at his foster daughters and said, &quot;Gita, stay here with <br />
Grisele and Goldwyn... there's something I need to do, stay right here.&quot;<br />
<br />
The three girls smiled and nodded. Running-Bear didn't inquire further as he ran after the <br />
wrongness he felt from the winds as Princess skipped along ahead of him.  He have <br />
wondered at the girls' smiling considering the news their grandmother's killer had <br />
vanished off the face of the earth from his cell... but this wasn't something that could wait.  <br />
He trusted in the girls being able to defend themselves at least, and the winds sense didn't <br />
feel any danger... to them. <br />
<br />
The three girls stood quite until the native was out of sight and then they looked at each <br />
other and giggled and skipped along to the Wises' household, knowing that Princess would <br />
give their guardian a long merry chase, giving them plenty of time to do what needed to be <br />
done. <br />
<br />
They arrived at the place that had been their home easily without incident, and not finding <br />
anyone to help along the way either. <br />
<br />
They knew their way around the house like the back of their hands, they had lived here for <br />
years after all. They didn't run into anyone else until they wandered to the study, where <br />
they found the Wises speaking. <br />
<br />
Ronald spoke harshly to his wife, &quot;Marcine, you have to give up these fantasizes! Just <br />
because you've failed to have children doesn't mean you should create fictional ones!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They AREN'T fantasizes Ronald! Jack, Tom, Harry, Adam, Roland! Can't at least -you- <br />
remember them? They're you're SONS! How can the Devil's Work make you forget them so <br />
easily-?!&quot;<br />
<br />
The girls all looked at each other from their spot in the doorway in absolute surprised and <br />
confusion. Mrs. Wise shouldn't have been able to remember her sons at all... it make less <br />
trouble that way... but... she did anyway? To where she could remember their -names-? <br />
<br />
Gita herself blinked in blank confusion, 'Does Mrs. Wise have the gift?' <br />
<br />
But that was absurd... how could prudes like this have the gift? That was supposed to be <br />
impossible... wasn't it? 'Only good people like our family can have the gift... it's not <br />
possible.' Goldwyn thought. <br />
<br />
Little Grisele meanwhile, just hoped they changed the adults soon so they'd stop yelling. <br />
That was the worst part of adults... the yelling. The endless yelling. She remembered that <br />
from her own parents well enough. That was the first thing she thought about the day <br />
when her parents were found dying from the Great Mortality... the yelling had stopped, she <br />
remembered smiling so brightly that morning. <br />
<br />
That was when they spotted one of the ladies hired to replace their grandmother at the <br />
house hold after her death ( Balthilde in spite of her age had been very very good at her <br />
job and was very hard to replace with just one person). It was a dark haired maid named <br />
Joella who had come to the town with nothing, and had been accepted with christian <br />
charity, and did her absolute best to hide her Jewish heritage from her benefactors. <br />
Weather this was just plain paranoia or a precaution was up for debate. <br />
<br />
&quot;Grisele? Gita? Goldwyn?&quot; She whispered seeing the girls ease-dropping, &quot;You shouldn't be <br />
here, the Wises are... having a discussion and Mrs. Wise is.. not feeling well, you should go <br />
before she sees you, it might, upset her.&quot;  <br />
<br />
&quot;You don't want us here?&quot; The youngest asked. <br />
<br />
She kelt down and looked Grisele in the eye, &quot;I DO want you here, you girls are the most <br />
wonderful girls in the world... and ... &quot; She didn't want to say anything about her <br />
grandmother and agitate wounds that might not have had time to close on a child, &quot;I really <br />
like you, but it would disrupt things if you were caught here right now...&quot;<br />
<br />
Grisele asked, &quot;Joella, would you play with us right now if you could?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes I would Grisele but right now-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And you'd play with us later if you could-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes you know I will and soon as I get a chance and-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And you would have played with us before?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I did, remember that one time-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you like being here?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't have a choice, this is my responsibility now...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then if you didn't have that responsibility-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I have to have it, adults can't just do whatever they want like you can.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then if you were a child you'd play with us?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If I had known you as a little girl of course I would have.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then it not fair that we didn't, and when something isn't fair, it should be fixed.&quot; Goldwyn <br />
said entering the little chat. <br />
<br />
A few minutes later the three stepped into the room. A black haired girl exactly Grisele's <br />
age lay in the hallway against a wall with a traumatized look in her eyes as she lay limply <br />
in a dress much too large for her. She was breathing, but her mind in shock from the three <br />
witch's clumsy age regression without Princess to help them focus leaving her mind with <br />
countless conflicting and self contradictory messages. They promised to come back for her <br />
later, the little girl barely gave a nod the rest of her body limp.  The three girls already <br />
thinking how the rest of the staff would be happy to be their new friends' dolls and be able <br />
to play forever. <br />
<br />
It took a moment for the two adults to realize the three children were there. <br />
<br />
&quot;What... what are you three doing here? Please-please leave, my wife is ill-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I am not sick Roland! Our sons-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't exist!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes they do.&quot; All three girls said together. <br />
<br />
the two adults turned. <br />
<br />
&quot;Their names are Jack, Roland, Harry, Tom, and Adam.&quot; Said Gita, &quot;Jack always takes <br />
change. Adam is always nice. Roland is always shy. Harry, and Tom are always getting dirty <br />
even for boys which gets you upset.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You.. you remember? OH thank the Lord!&quot; Marcine said hugging the three girls at once. <br />
<br />
&quot;You shouldn't give into my wife's fantasy children.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh it isn't a fantasy!&quot; Gita promised. &quot;In fact we're here to help you be with them again.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Where are they? Please please tell me!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You want to be with them?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;More than anything!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;MARCINE THIS HAS GONE ON LONG ENOUGH!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't worry, you'll be with them too Mr. Wise...&quot;<br />
<br />
The three girls tapped into the magic. <br />
<br />
++++++++++<br />
<br />
Glass Marie said, &quot;The methods Marie's god father used to train his god daughter in self <br />
defense could sometimes be ... eccentric.&quot; <br />
<br />
The first time Marie screamed as she fell, thankfully at her age her nature hadn't betrayed <br />
her yet. She stopped falling when the rope ran out of length, not far enough to cause any <br />
damage, just enough to give the girl a fright. Good thing she hadn't been wearing wearing <br />
a dress (her god father didn't want to think what would happened to her if THAT was found <br />
out). <br />
<br />
Now however the eight going on nine year old lass fell off the rafter herself without <br />
needing a kindly push and threw the knifes hitting the targets easily. Mutt barked at his <br />
master's expertise. The common sense of having an animal below someone throwing <br />
weapons at targets is best left not thought about. <br />
<br />
The dog, given the simple name 'Mutt' by Marie when caught off guard asking what the <br />
animal's name was to be.  The poor animal had seemed terrified of humans when her god <br />
father had first brought it home... but not so much around children like Marie...  Godfather <br />
didn't have the heart to tell Marie he had taken the dog from a repeat zoophile he had <br />
killed after the convict had bribed for his escape and had caught the man before he could <br />
flee the country, no one so much as spoke to the plague doctor with the sword hidden <br />
inside his cane as he left the scene with the animal. <br />
<br />
<br />
Marie Cruz's god father felt the chest pains once again... knowing his time would come to <br />
it's end soon enough.  If the winged skeleton in the white robe waving at him that Marie <br />
couldn't see was any indication.   His only regret was that he would not be likely able to tell <br />
her good-bye whenever the hourglass ran out... &quot;I plan to hold you off as long as I can.&quot;<br />
<br />
The figure grinned, &quot;Heh, good luck with that.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Pst. I know this isn't the one that kills me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh no it isn't... but sooner or later it will be... Maybe I'll take a consolation prize until <br />
then.&quot;<br />
<br />
The rope from three years of training for the young girl into being able to defend herself <br />
from the worst the adult world had to offer rotted and broke off... Marie for the first time <br />
in two years screamed as she fell... she saw the ground coming up fast to meet her.... <br />
<br />
&quot;MARIE!&quot; Her godfather raced knowing he wouldn't make it in time. <br />
<br />
&quot;Wanna trade?&quot; Death whispered. <br />
<br />
That was when a stone figure that looked like a mix between a winged lion and a man <br />
swooped down and caught the girl before she hit the ground. <br />
<br />
&quot;F!&quot; Death cursed. <br />
<br />
+++++++++<br />
<br />
Kathy finished writing her letter to the mysterious lion boy who had given her her ears and <br />
tail... that had apparently been the end result of her becoming a pink full anthro feline... it <br />
contained her feelings, her thoughts, her opinion, her forgiveness, and her thanks... <br />
<br />
Now she just needed to figure the lad's name and home address...</p>
