<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The next day Colleen was sitting at her dinner table looking down-cast.  She was tired and not feeling well.  She certainly did not want to talk about what had happened last night at the prom.  But she expected her mother would drag it out of her soon enough.<br />
<br />
Colleen did not remember how she got home last night or even when she got home.  After she had faded into the background of the chaos that Loki caused she could not remember what had happened next.  She woke up in her bed still in her prom dress, now ruined around the bust.  That was the first reminder of the horrible night.  The weight of her new breasts were almost unreal.  Sitting up had been a major challenge.  Every movement she made had to be carefully thought out or Colleen would loose control.  She had found that out the hard way.  She had hopped out of bed and her breasts had hauled her across the room before pulled everything to a stop.  Dizzy and tired she had stood in front of her mirror trying to let it all sink in.<br />
<br />
At the table, changed and fresh for the day she could not take her eyes of her breasts.  Her largest t-shirt was stretched across the expanse more tightly then she would have liked.  It was all still so unreal.  They were heavy but not sagging.  They were very round and seemed to defy gravity but they did not pull at her back and she did not have to slouch.  She did that anyway out of fatigue.  Her breasts just filled the entire space between her arms.  Where was her lap?<br />
<br />
After removing her stretched and splitting dress Colleen had wrapped her robe around her and gone into the shower.  There she had found new surprises.  Loki had said something about no more hair below the neck and Colleen had found that to be true.  Smooth, tanned, skin had greeted her eyes and searching fingers.  The curly red fuzz patch above her crotch was gone.  She did not know if she would miss it.  The bareness was too new and accompanied by so much else.  Carefully raising her leg, Colleen examined it.  If Loki was to be believed, it would be tanned and hairless for the rest of her life.  She would be fit and toned for good.  Her razor and new bottle of shaving cream caught her eye.  That is one expense she could do without now.  The cold economic fact washed over her like the water from the shower.<br />
<br />
That was something that Colleen did not have to tell her mother if she could help it, she thought.  One of her hands found her warm thigh just past her shorts cuff and started to caress it.  Delicate finger tips moved over sensitive skin.  She felt goose-bumps race around her body as her heart beat quicker.  Stop, she thought, it is still early but someone might be up.  But still her fingers continued to trace the outline of her frying jean-shorts.  Another of Loki's tricks, she wondered, that I cannot control myself.  She was not willing to admit that it was not magic but herself that was trying to let go.<br />
<br />
Earlier in the bathroom she had re-discovered her lips.  After a shower she would have exfoliated then done her hair, made-up her eyes, then brushed her teeth.  She no longer needed to do the first thing and she had left her hair and make-up alone in the shower from last night, that only left the teeth.  Her teeth, which were hiding behind her lips.  She must have  purposefully looked at everything but her lips before, now she had no choice.  She looked, she stared, she got to know them up close.<br />
<br />
They were massive lips.  Pinkish-red and glossy.  The gloss she had put on last night must have worn off by now so the wet shine they had must be inherent.  Her lips glistened.  They were full also.  The top lip over-flowed it's cupid's-bow line and bulged far out.  The two sides were symmetrical and tapered to the corners of her mouth which was the only place her lip did not cast a shadow on the lower one.  The lower lip was thick and round.  Jutting sharply down from the corners, the lines then curved gracefully inward to meet.  Her lip was round and long.  The quivered heavily, leaving a tiny gap in the middle of her mouth and cast a shadow on her chin below.  They were as thick as thumbs or they were a pair of hot-dogs cut provocatively then glued to her mouth.  But they were sexy.  And they were sensitive.  Colleen's brush handle glided and rubbed all over her lips in a way that she had never noticed before but which left her hot.<br />
<br />
The sun found its way through the blinds and fell across Colleen at that moment.  It lit up her white cotton top allowing her to see through it to the shadowy bulges that were her breasts.  Her free hand moved to rest on top of her chest and began to caress it.  Her shirt was pulled so tight that the light movement of her hand caused the whole of her front to jiggle.  Her other hand left her thigh for the moment and tried to steady her quaking breasts from the other side.  Both hands together moved about trying to stop her breasts from bouncing only to cause them to continue.  Soon she found that they were more the cause than the solution.  Then one hand found a nipple, erect and tingling and the other moved back to her short's cuff.  Up and down the thigh, one hand went getting ever higher.  The other moved around and around the nipple getting ever faster.  Her tongue was now licking her lips and there were new sensations to enjoy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, my,&quot; she squeaked breaking the silence.  Her lips tingled and there was a pulse like a muscle flexing behind her lips.  A surge and they felt a little more swollen.  It was a certainty that was a product of everything else that was new.  All thanks to Loki.<br />
<br />
Loki had named her Colleen and that was her name now.  There had been a diary in her room with the name of Heather on the cover.  That must have been her name before, but Colleen could not remember that, only that her name was Colleen and that it had not always been.  Would she be able to tell her mother about last night?  Would she be able to explain all that Loki had done to her?<br />
<br />
There was a noise in the kitchen.  Colleen's hands snapped to her sides as her mother entered the room.  &quot;Morning, Colleen,&quot; her mother said.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; Colleen asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I said: good morning.&quot;  Her mother yawned then looked carefully at her daughter.  &quot;The music must have been loud last night if you can't hear.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Um, yeah.&quot;  Colleen was at a lost did her mother not see a difference.  She had called her Colleen.  Had reality changed here as well?<br />
<br />
&quot;What time did you get in last night?  Aren't you tired?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I got in late and I couldn't sleep,&quot;  Colleen said.  Her head was buzzing.  Some how she was speaking normally through her massive lips.<br />
<br />
&quot;Anything interesting happen?&quot;  Her mother asked moving off to make some tea.  Colleen followed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Somethings,&quot; Colleen said.  Her lips were not expanding.  &quot;Mom, do I look different to you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Her mother regarded Colleen carefully.  &quot;Your hair is nice.  How long are you going to keep it in?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just for today.  I will take it out before I take a nap.&quot;  Colleen was confused; Loki had said that her lips would grow whenever she spoke.  Or it had something to do with speaking unnecessarily.  &quot;Yoo, shood haf sseen wha somn of da girls wer war rung, Mahm.&quot;<br />
<br />
Colleen stopped.  There was a surge and a swelling in her lips.<br />
<br />
&quot;Colleen, please, don't babble,&quot; her mother said.  &quot;I can't understand you when you do.  Would you like some tea?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, please,&quot;  Colleen said clearly.  &quot;Ih's gonna bee wahrum ooday.  Buh neez arr fwuffy,&quot;  she mumbled with accompanied swelling.  Babbling, that was what made them grow.  But how did were they supposed to go down?</p>
