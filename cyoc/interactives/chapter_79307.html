<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jim was remembering one day at the office where he visited the office a couple of months earlier as Jen, and where he first met Zane, who was <br />
Susan Baxter back then, though Jim doesn’t know Susan has transformed into being Zane.  As the story becomes more sexual, with the sex <br />
scene with Zane, who was Susan, but they had sex as gay male, pre-op ftms, Jim starts to rub one out as he goes to a stall in the men's <br />
bathroom.<br />
<br />
TWO MONTHS AGO<br />
<br />
Bob said to Jen, “Hello, Jen.  Welcome to the office building.  Let me show you around if you haven’t been here already.”<br />
<br />
On the tour that Jen had already been on, as her mom showed him once, and Bob had already shown him a couple of times, as he’s prone to <br />
being forgetful, Bob decided to have another tour.  Maybe because he likes giving tours, but also to tell Jen minor updates on what the <br />
company added or subtracted.<br />
<br />
There, Jen meets the secretary, Zane (or rather Susan) Baxter.<br />
<br />
Susan Baxter was Bob’s mistress, and while she no longer is presently as she had changed into being Zane, she was definitely quite the looker <br />
back in the day.<br />
<br />
She would always saunter in wearing a low cut blouse, a skin tight miniskirt, and had her long, jet black hair tied back in a ponytail that swayed <br />
whenever she walked.  She also left a part of her ass showing, and always wore a skimpybra.<br />
<br />
Susan said to Jen, “Hello, Jen.  Welcome to the office.  Can I show you around?”<br />
<br />
Her face bright red with embarrassment, Jen muttered, “No thanks.”<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, the HR guy, Brad said to Jen, “Hello ma’am.  Name’s Brad Thompson.  I do the hiring.  I also help the team do sales as a just in case.  <br />
How can I help you?”<br />
<br />
Jen smiled at him, as she said, “Just looking around.  Hope you stick around.”<br />
<br />
Brad smiled back, “Thanks.”<br />
<br />
Susan, the secretary went back to kiss Bob, as she done so passionately as always before going back to work.<br />
<br />
Furious, Jen looked on with anguish.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Brad had already left, as he told them, “I’ve gotta make a run to Kinko’s.  I’ll be back.”<br />
<br />
Susan said to Brad demandingly, “Come back quick.”<br />
<br />
Unbeknownst to them, Brad had decided to go home, as he was on his way to visit another girlfriend that they had not known about.<br />
<br />
Jen was fed with Susan’s behavior.  It was unprofessional to her.  She looked slutty, like a hobag, and she was making all kinds of sexual <br />
advances to her father right in front of her.<br />
<br />
Furious, Jen stormed into her dad’s office, hoping Susan wasn’t there.  She didn’t see Susan, but Susan wasn’t in her office.  She was hiding in <br />
the back watching them.<br />
<br />
Jen told her dad, “Why do you employ Susan?  She is such a slut!  All she does is wear skimpy outfits, make sexual advances to you, and tries to <br />
sleep with every guy in the office!”<br />
<br />
Her dad said, “Jen, she is not a slut.  She’s not…a slut bag.  That is a mean and an awfully rude thing, to say.  You know she is proficient in <br />
typing.  She gets her work done quickly.  She is respectful of her colleagues.  She is a good girl.  I just want you to see things my way.”<br />
<br />
Upset, Jen said, “Well, I would never do half the things she does in the office.  And I disagree with her behavior here.”<br />
<br />
Her dad said, “You don’t have to agree with what she does, but please, just be respectful of her.  She’s worked really hard to get to where she <br />
has gotten to.”<br />
<br />
Flustered, Jen then said, “Oh.  I’ll bet.”<br />
<br />
Her dad said to her, “Jen, I won’t fire her!  It’s not company etiquette, nothing you do or say will change my mind!”<br />
<br />
Jen then tells him angrily, “Good, then don’t.  She has ‘til the end of the day to convince my mind that she can stay.”<br />
<br />
Equally upset, her dad mutters to himself, “Damn it.  Jen always has to have her way.  How will Susan convince Jen before the end of the day? I <br />
only hope Jen will come to her senses.”<br />
<br />
Jen storms out of the room, with Susan following her.<br />
<br />
Susan say to Jen, “Hey, I heard you bitch me out in front of your dad.  What was that all about?  That was not cool.”<br />
<br />
Jen said, “I’m sorry, but I just don’t like how you’ve acted around the office.  I know you’re sleeping with my dad, you slut!  I don’t even know <br />
how you’re not pregnant by now!”<br />
<br />
Upset, Susan says, “Take that back!  I’m not a whore!  Let me show you how good I am.”<br />
<br />
Jen then said, “Fine.  I don’t like girls, Susan.”<br />
<br />
Susan then yelled back, “Well, I don’t like girls, either!  So there!”<br />
<br />
For most of the afternoon, they spend it being mad at each other, struggling to comprehend the other’s ways.  Susan then pondered another <br />
idea.  To dress Jen as a boy.<br />
<br />
In a small room hidden underneath the office, Susan grabs the key to go down to the empty, but warm warehouse down below.<br />
<br />
She draws a mustache on Jen’s face, while she rips off Jen’s tanktop, leaving Jen in her bra.<br />
<br />
Confused, Jen asks demandingly, “What are you doing, Susan?”<br />
<br />
Susan says, “Well, I gotta keep my job, so this is my way of convincing you, damn it.  I’ll stop sleeping with your dad, if you promise to sleep <br />
with me.”<br />
<br />
Jen says as she reiterates, “Whoa.  But I don’t like girls.” <br />
<br />
Susan says, “Well, try.”<br />
<br />
Jen then grabs her bag that has been sitting in an empty bathroom downstairs.<br />
<br />
She tells Jen, “Take off your pants.  Put this on.”<br />
<br />
Jen asks, “Why?”<br />
<br />
Susan says, “Don’t ask any questions, damn it!”<br />
<br />
She straps the dildo on Jen, and unhooks Jen’s bra. Then, she pulls out two short haired wigs, and throws one on Jen.<br />
<br />
She then tells Jen, “tell yourself you have pecks. Now!”<br />
<br />
Jen says meekly, “I have pecks?”<br />
<br />
Susan says, “That’s right?”<br />
<br />
Susan then commands, “Now fuck me!”<br />
<br />
Jen shakes her head.  <br />
<br />
She cries, “No!  All you’re doing is humiliating me.  But you can’t make me like girls.”<br />
<br />
It’s 4:20, and Susan starts to grow desperate.  So she starts dressing up as a boy.<br />
<br />
She uses the scissors to cut her hair, and unhooks her own bra to show her chest.  Susan uses a mirror to outline a realistic, looking dark <br />
brown goatee on her face.  Then she throws on a strap-on dildo for herself.  As Susan looks in the mirror, she sees a reflection of a young man <br />
with a painted on goatee, with breasts, and a strap-on dick in his pants!!!!<br />
<br />
Susan commands to Jen, “I’m a boy now.  So are you!  Let’s hump each other!  I’m Stu!  Or Zane.”<br />
<br />
Jen cried to Susan happily, “Fuck me, Zane!!!!  My male name is Jim.”<br />
<br />
Zane then bends Jim over to spank him on his ass.<br />
 <br />
Zane stands up to fuck Jim in his ass from behind, as he thrusts his hips back and forth.  <br />
<br />
Jim says, “Fuck yes!!!! Fuck yes!!!!!!”<br />
<br />
Zane slaps Jim’s ass, as he says to him naughtily in a nasal voice, “Who’s your master, who’s your boyfriend?”<br />
<br />
Jim replies, “You are Zane.”<br />
<br />
Zane growls as he says happily, “That’s right!”<br />
<br />
This goes on for ten minutes, until Zane pulls out, cumming through his penis packer onto Jim’s stomach.<br />
<br />
But Zane was growing needy himself in his groin area, as he starts rubbing his red vagina underneath his strap-on dick.<br />
<br />
He when he pulls out, he cries out, “Holy fuck.”<br />
<br />
They then pull out a double-dildo to hook up to each other’s swollen vaginas, while calling their front holes their ass holes, as they grab their <br />
own prosthetic dicks to masturbate.<br />
<br />
Zane yells, “I’m manly!  I’m manly!  So are you, Jim!”<br />
<br />
Jim yells back, “Fuck yeah!  Fuck yeah!  We’re boys, now!”<br />
<br />
They stare at each other dreamily, while humping on the double dildo, while they were grabbing their cocks.<br />
<br />
They shake back and forth, laying on the ground, until they were about to cum.<br />
<br />
Jim yells, “Holy shit!  My ass is about to blow!  I’m stroking my (prosthetic) dick now!”<br />
<br />
Wincing, Zane yells back, “Fuck yeah!  My ass is about to blow, too!  I’m stroking my (prosthetic) dick as well!”<br />
<br />
Later, they both came on the double-dildo, as they were both satisfied.  For Jen, or Jim rather, s/he was satisfied at fucking the secretary, with <br />
the secretary doing hir as a man.<br />
<br />
As they were about to finish cumming, they stop and pull out the double dildo from each other, and get up to cum on each other through their <br />
penis packers like gay men.  Meanwhile, they start rubbing their clitorises inside their prosthetic dicks, and both cum lightly through the <br />
packer.<br />
<br />
Jim asks if he can put his prosthetic dick inside Zane’s asshole once, as Zane obliges, with Jim gently putting it in once, before taking it out.<br />
<br />
They hug and kiss each other, as they hold hands and start to put on their clothes, though Zane decides to stay in men’s clothing for the night.  <br />
<br />
Zane kisses Jim, as he says, “Thanks for the session.”<br />
<br />
Jim kisses Zane back, as he says, “No, thank you, my man!”<br />
<br />
Zane says as he puts a hand on his chest, and says breathily, “Holy shit, I love being a man! Let’s do this again sometime!”<br />
<br />
Jim replies, kissing Zane as Zane starts to walk out, “Yeah!  Goodbye my sweet man!”<br />
<br />
He watches Zane sway back and forth ladylike, but still dressed as a man on the way out.<br />
<br />
For Zane, it was an awakening of a secret love and willingness to be a man.  Zane left out the backdoor to explore his male self for the night, <br />
and Jim/Jen took off hir wig to go back to being her female self that day.<br />
<br />
Jen told her dad, “The secretary stays.  I love Baxter.”<br />
<br />
Her dad said, “ Good.  I’m glad you see it my way. “<br />
<br />
PRESENT DAY<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, as Jim and Zane now have fully transformed into being men, with fully erect penises and all, they start lusting after each other, even <br />
if Zane may have forgotten that he has fucked Jim before.  But the attraction and the lust is still there, and may be stronger than ever.<br />
<br />
As full on cisboys, Jim and Zane both wonder separately to have a good hard fucking, that it would be better than ever, but decide to put it off <br />
until the time is right.  For now, both dream about gay sex with each other, though they try to remain as professional as possible.<br />
<br />
For Jim, he decides that now would be a good time to tell Katie and Tiffany about his body swap into being an 18-year old gay boy, and his new <br />
crush on the new male secretary, Zane Baxter.  Meanwhile in the bathroom, his crush Zane, is also in the men's room, as there is a chance <br />
those two may bump into each other again.</p>
