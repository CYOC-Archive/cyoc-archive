<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As the two groups now began to mingle, Kumi looked over at her doppelgänger. The 40 year old woman was smiling as she and her husband now carried the almost 2 year old Tommy inside one of the cabins. Taking a deep breath she now approached them, giving them a timid wave.<br />
<br />
“Hey Kumi,” Kumiko said warmly. “Good to see you.”<br />
<br />
“I was going to say the same thing,” Kumi smiled. “I see Tommy’s starting to get big.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah he’s definitely a growing boy,” Kumiko chuckled. “And he’s funny too. The other day he was asking why his daddy had no hair. Poor kid got so upset when Cole told he lost it. He insisted on searching the backyard to find out where it went.”<br />
<br />
Kumi laughed softly as the two adults entered the cabin with Kumi training behind. “So is it true,” Kumi said softly. “Your pregnant again?” Kumiko smiled, placing a hand on her stomach as Cole placed a massive hand on his wives shoulder. “Yeah it’s true,” she smiled. “Early next year, Timmy is going to have a baby sister.”<br />
<br />
Kumi smiled hugging the two tightly, as she pulled away she could see a look of concern of Kumiko and Coles face. “What’s wrong,” she asked. “I thought you two would be thrilled.”<br />
<br />
“Oh we are,” Cole said quickly. “We excited it’s just.”<br />
<br />
“What Cole is trying to say,” Kumiko interrupted. “Is that, this is not going to be an easy pregnancy. Technically I’m high risk, mostly because of my age.”<br />
<br />
“I’ve told you before honey your age doesn’t mean a thing to me,” Cole said. Kumiko smiled sadly, placing a soft kiss on her husbands cheek. “I know Cole,” she said softly. “But we got to face facts. I’m a 40 year old woman. You heard what the doctor said, we got lucky with Tommy. This time we could have a lot of problems.”<br />
<br />
“What kind of problems,” Kumi asked.<br />
<br />
Kumiko sighed as she now gazed down at her stomach. “Well the baby could have a lot of health issues,” she said. “Down syndrome and other genetic defects are common. Then there’s me, a pregnancy could affect my health as well. We’re talking high blood pressure or complications at birth.”<br />
<br />
“Could it kill you or the baby,” Kumi whispered fearfully.<br />
<br />
Kumiko shrugged sadly as Cole hugged her tightly. “It’s a possibility,” Cole said. “Kumiko hasn’t wanted to say anything but yeah, her chances of having complications have increased dramatically. We just didn’t want to say anything to anyone. It’s supposed to be a happy occasion after all. Besides, I know my wife, she’s tougher than she looks.”<br />
<br />
Kumi smiled as she watched her doppelgänger chuckle before hugging Cole. Although they were trying their best to put on a brave face the teen could see the look of fear and concern in their eyes. Both parents were worried, not only about the baby but about Kumikos health as well. “No,” Kumi thought. “I won’t let anything happen to my...her daughter. I have to help.”<br />
<br />
“Kumiko,” Kumi said slowly. “What if I told you I can help.”<br />
<br />
“What do you mean,” Kumiko asked, raising an eyebrow. Kumi sighed as she now held her pendent out for Kumiko and Cole to see. “I’ve been training,” she said. “In magic, I’ve actually gotten pretty good. Please I think I have an idea. I just need your permission before I do anything.”<br />
<br />
Kumiko and Cole looked at eachother before turning towards the teen and nodding. Both adults, while surprised Kumi had magic, were willing to ask the girl for help. For both though they knew what it meant. Kumi was going to cast a spell and make Kumiko younger. While Kumiko wasn’t as thrilled to relive her youth as much as Lisa was, in the case of ensuring the health of her unborn daughter, she would gladly sacrifice a few years.<br />
<br />
“Alright Kumi,” Kumiko said. “Just, try not to get too carried away Okay? Rather not be a pregnant teenager.”<br />
<br />
“I promise Kumiko,” Kumi said. As Kumi was about to cast the spell Cole approached her the girl, whispering in her ear. Kumi nodded as she now began to cast her spell.<br />
<br />
Kumiko felt a tingle spread of her body as her doppelgänger began to cast the spell. Anxiously she now glanced down at her stomach. The woman was now only beginning to show and was worried that if any age magic was used on her she could lose the pregnancy. Glancing in her compact mirror Kumiko breathed a sigh of relief. The 40 year woman’s face was begging to look fresher, the small lines around her eyes vanishing while the few stray grey hairs began to vanish one by one. Judging herself to be 35 again Kumiko looked down to notice her pregnancy seemed unaffected by the spell. In fact, she almost looked more pregnant.<br />
<br />
“You doing okay,” Kumi asked as she continued to concentrate. Kumiko nodded as she looked herself over. She was now back in her early 30s, perhaps no older than 32. Kumikos body seemed to firm as her hair lost all of its grey and began to glow once more. “Yeah I’m doing great,” a now 30 year old Kumiko said. “But one question. How do I look more pregnant.”<br />
<br />
“Well,” Kumi said. “Making you younger is the easy part. But keeping the baby healthy is a bit trickier. I’ve had to age her up a bit. Right now your due date has moved up to early February or late January.”<br />
<br />
“Wow,” Kumiko exhaled as she gazed at her slowly expanding stomach. As the woman glanced in her mirror once more she couldn’t help but marvel at the mature young woman in her mirror. Carefully studying the mirror though she began to frown. Kumiko certainly didn’t look like she was in her 30s anymore. The woman&#39;s face appeared slightly softer than before. Gazing at her face she could see it appeared unlined while her chestnut haired glowed with renewed youth.<br />
<br />
“Kumi how young am I going to get?”<br />
<br />
“Don’t be mad,” Kumi blushed. “But, um, I made you 26.”<br />
<br />
“26,” Kumiko exclaimed. “Why so young?”<br />
<br />
“Um that’s my fault babe,” Cole blushed. “I, um, wanted to be the older one in the relationship, even it’s just for a little while.”<br />
<br />
Kumiko frowned as she gazed at her youthful reflection before chuckling softly and punching Cole playfully in his thigh sized bicep. “Your a dick sometimes you know that,” She chuckled. Turning towards the teen Kumiko smiled, hugging the teen tightly. “Thank you Kumi,” she said warmly.<br />
<br />
Kumi could only grin as she gazed at the couple. It felt good to do something nice for her doppelgänger and her husband. Hopefully one day Kumi would be able to share a moment like this with the Cole from her timeline.</p>
