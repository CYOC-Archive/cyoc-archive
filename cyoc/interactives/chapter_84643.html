<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The hotel owners had thought that the curse only takes 5 minutes to complete its work, aging its victim 10 years for every chime, they’d be wrong. In actuality, the curse is flexible, fluid and unpredictable. One person may age 10 years for every chime heard, but it could take weeks, months, or it could be instant. No one, not even the maker of the clock knew how or why it was different each time. Magic tends to be finicky like that.<br />
<br />
	In Brad’s case, the curse was going to use his young body’s natural energy and the rejuvenating effects of deep sleep to complete its task. Tossing and turning, Brad lay in bed in a nearly restless sleep due to the subtle growing pains starting to wrack his body. Usually a boy growing up would get dull aches and pains gradually as his bones and musculature grow and reshape, but poor Brad was getting ten times that in a matter of hours! His dreams where chaotic, scenes of young childhood games and laughter warped and twisted faster than he could focus as his mind tried to tip him off to the changes being forced on his slumbering body.<br />
<br />
	Already he’d grown nearly 5 inches in height, his feet and hands cracking and reshaping to those of a lanky prepubescent. Baby fat started to melt away as muscle and bone reformed and grew far beyond that of his years. Already now on the cusp of puberty his back arched and his shoulders widened, giving him the look of a boy who’d clearly been active and fit, while retaining that boyish youth of most twelve year olds. Small faint hairs started to break the surface of his skin along his ankles and arms, a few thicker ones twirled out from under his arms and his face, which had already started to take on a more angular shape, grew the fine nearly invisible peach fuzz that would soon darken while under his tightening briefs a small grouping of hair formed over his maturing boyhood.<br />
<br />
	He was now sweating profusely; his body producing new scents he’d only known to come from his less than hygienic older brother, yet even in deep sleep, his mind picked up on them, associating them with his rapidly changing dreams. In his dream, he was clearly in a room with a few older boys all playing videogames and laughing, and all in different states of undress. The whole room, which looked oddly similar to his older brothers, smelled musky and dank. All of them had their shirts off as it was quite warm, and most where barefoot, having ditched their sneakers and socks to cool off. Soon, they were all talking about girls at their school and bragging about how far they’d gotten, but it was obvious that none of them had gone past a kiss or two. Brad found this extremely odd. These were the types of activities and conversations he’d overheard his brother’s friends talking about, not his! But he could feel an unfamiliar tingle in his loins as one of the boys pulled a playboy from his backpack.<br />
<br />
	To the waking world, Brad, now in his mid teens, a rather muscular body soaked in sweat and moaning softly as his already quite developed cock throbbed in underwear that was ready to burst. He was gently humping into the air as larger than average balls worked overtime to dump hormones into the ageing boy. For a 15 year old, he’d been quite blessed. Already a 7 inch boner and robin egg sized balls dangled under a smattering of thick public hair, a soft trail lead up to his naval, but ended there. Under his arms was a dark mass of hair, nearly dripping in sweat from the heat of the growth. His legs were covered from ankle to calf, and the hair fanned out and stopped mid thigh, while on his arms it was dark around the forearm but lighter towards the elbow and wrist. There were no signs of any other growth, which Brad would be thankful for when he wakes.<br />
<br />
	Brad gave a sudden lurch as he came for the first time, and a sudden growth spurt tore his briefs and tank top for good. Soaking down his tight rigid abs with cum his body thrust forward one final leap, stopping at 18. Where once a boy of 8 lay sleeping, there was now a man of 18, snoring in a deep voice while in his dreams, he had just finished a rather intense fuck session with the only girl of that age he’d ever paid any attention to, his brother’s girlfriend. Apparently he was now attracted to his brother’s type of girl. Somehow the curse took into account that at some point, in his normal aging he’d have some bonding time with his older brother and they’d be closer, sharing interests and such instead of tormenting each other.<br />
<br />
	In the dream he was now lying in a room littered with dirty laundry, smelling slightly like boy musk and Febreeze, next to a gorgeous teenage beauty whom he’d just had a wild night of passionate sex. Somehow he could remember every feeling, every detail, even though in reality, he’d never even so much as thought about girls, much less had sex with one. But the mind of a horny teenage boy is a wondrous thing, able to fabricate these sorts of scenes from thin air.<br />
	To anyone looking into the hotel room, they’d see two teenage boys, one in PJs, the other nude sleeping like rocks in separate beds. Brad was now taller, more toned, and older than his older brother by two years! The curse had used its knowledge of the future to accurately predict that Brad would be a star Baseball player in High School. Toning and shaping his body to have the muscle definition, shape with wide shoulders and a thin waist, and long toned legs. His hands where slightly callused from his refusal to wear gloves while batting. His feet where now a massive size 13 up from his youth size 9s and he’d now need to wear at least a large in most shirts unless of course he wanted to display every rigid cut and shape of his hard earned Adonis body. <br />
<br />
	If one were to look below the belt as they say, you’d see something not a lot of teenagers get to see. His “bat and balls” where well above average, hanging limp at 6 inches and would grow to 9 easily while underneath his balls dangled heavy and low, the size of small chicken eggs. His body hair had thickened up nicely, not overly so, but definitely enough to showcase the tone and shape of his muscles. Even his chest had gained a very light smattering in the center than spread out a bit, encircling the quarter sized nipples that pointed slightly downward because of the massive pecs underneath. Under his arms the damp bush was poking out in a jungle consistency, he’d have to trim up a bit unless he wanted to flaunt massive pit stains all the time. His whole body gave off a slightly musky scent that wasn’t unpleasant, but definitely showed his outward masculinity. He’d never have any issue asserting dominance over most other guys.<br />
<br />
	The sun started to shine in through the two widows on the other side of the room, but neither boy stirred. Obviously they both slept like most teenage boys, dead to the world until something loud and obnoxious broke them from their fantasy world. Who would wake up first? Would Brad wake and see his new form, or would His Brother Alex wake to a naked stranger in the second bed?</p>
