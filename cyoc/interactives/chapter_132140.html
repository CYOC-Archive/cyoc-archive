<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After arriving home half an hour later, Tommy decided to test his ability to change the clothes with his mind. <br />
He changed the shoes, who had been Mike and Mark, into more comfortable slippers and his jeans, the formerly Tim, into shorts. It took only seconds for the clothes to adjust to his wishes.<br />
Smiling, he went to the kitchen to make himslef something to eat. He didn´t need to make more because his mother was at work and wouldn´t be home for the next few hours. The only other person in the house was his younger brother George, but he was away, probably with some of his friends. <br />
<br />
Two hours later his brother came home with his two best friends, Jim and Tanner. Tommy had been experimenting with his clothes by then, changing them in material, lengh, form and color just to laugh at how funny he looks with some combinations. The moment he heard the door, he changed them back to what they looked like after arriving home before starting to read something on his laptop.<br />
Just then his brother entered the room with his friends, all looking exhaust and dirty. <br />
At first, they let Tommy be while talking about the game they had played. But after about ten minutes the asked if he could make them something to eat. They annoyed him so long that he said yes to just shut them up. By the time he had made them some sandwiches they had completely taken over the couch he had been sitting on before, not even bothering how the couch would look because of all the dirt the had on them and started to play something on the tv. Tommy just sighed about their antics before he went to put the plate on the table and planning to grab his laptop and get over to an armchair a bit away from them. When he came near them, however, he noticed the smell coming from them. <br />
&quot;Can you do me a favor and go shower? You all are smelling like you have been in the sewers and by the look of how dirty you are, you probably were.&quot; They only laughed but didn´t show any interest in showering. Irritated Tommy went over to the armchair and started reading again. Only for them to annoy him further a couple of minutes later with how loud they turned the tv while playing and how they must comment everything. <br />
After half an hour Tommy had enough. He started the chronivac to look what he could do with them. <br />
&quot;Do you like how you smell?&quot; he asked them. Again they only laughed, thinking it is funny that it bothered him.<br />
From their reaction he decided what to do with them. He starts to put on the changes for the three of them.<br />
The moment he hit enter, all three of them felt something was wrong. They noticed how everything around them started to grow before jumping to their feet. The moment their feet hit the ground, however, was the moment the froze and the speed of their shrinking increased, leaving them after just a couple of seconds at the size of ants, floating unmoveable midair. Their clothes, not having shrunken with them, fall down in a pile under them.<br />
Tommy could make out how they screamed, but he waited for the next change to happen. Slowly their clothes vanished completely with the exception of the left shoe from George and his socks. The sock outside a shoe slowly floated up to them before separating  into many pieces. Each piece then changed form from simple shreds to various small clothing pieces. This clothes then started to float to the three shrunken boys and dress them all by itself. They all now wore simple grey socks, shorts and shirts made out of the old sock from George.<br />
While that happened, the other sock changed inside the remaining shoe. While the shoe itself became transparent and slightly deformed so it looked more symmetric then an ordinary left shoe, the sock separated into pieces and formed furniture inside the shoe. A couple of armchairs, beds and tables and an empty bookshelf rearranged themself in it, hardening when necessary to keep the form. In the shelf then appeared a couple of books, the only thing not made out of the sock.<br />
After the shoe room was ready, the three boys slowly float down into it. When they touched the ground the opening of the shoe closed, leaving them trapped inside. A second later they could move again and they tryed to get the still stinking sock-clothes off of them, but the didn´t budge. Panic was with them when they saw the gigantic Tommy walk over to grab the shoe they are in now.<br />
He then moved them over to a shelf in his own room before he explained.<br />
&quot;I think you must learn what it is to others when you stink that way and how you should not annoy everyone around you. The sock-clothes will remain on as if they are glued to you. The smell of the socks and the shoe will remain the same for as long as you stay in there. You will never adjust to the smell, so you will notice it the whole time. You will not need to eat, drink or go to an toilet while you are in there. And if you grow while getting older, your clothes will grow with you. Should I let you in there for that long, you will stop getting older if you turn twenty. And nobody besides me will remember who you are. Also I´m the only one who can hear and see you outside the shoe, the others will only see an empty glass shoe.&quot; With them looking horrified at their situation, Tommy went back to reading on his laptop on the couch. It had cleaned itself because to the world, George, Jim and Tanner where never there to make it dirty.</p>
