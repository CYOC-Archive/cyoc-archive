<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dave resists the feeling even though the harem outfit magically tried to make him loose will power. <br />
<br />
Dave drew in a deep breath, leaped away from Darrel and to the window behind Brian who still lay there moaning even though the sex had stopped.<br />
<br />
“Back off!” Dave said and picked up one of the two lamps at the head of the bad and began swinging it at the guys. “I mean it! Let me and my friend go or I am going to scream rape out this window!”<br />
<br />
The nerds just laughed and one said to the other “Spunky, I like that!” then the other said, “Yes, this is going to be more fun than the last.”<br />
<br />
Dave knew he was no match for even these little nerds so he stuck his head out the window and screamed “Rape, rape, these nerds are trying to rape me!” <br />
<br />
The nerds just giggled as Brian said “Come on Dave, be nice and lay down, it feels soooo good!”<br />
<br />
Dave looked at Brian with disgust and screamed again.<br />
<br />
This time though a voice called back from outside “Campus police! Is this really an emergency?” <br />
<br />
The nerds backed away when Dave screamed out. ”It is if they don’t let us leave!” <br />
<br />
Then the policeman said “Come out now or I’m coming in!”<br />
<br />
Dave glared at the nerds and took Brian by the hand almost dragging the slut out of the room and to the cop.<br />
<br />
“It was a slight misunderstanding, we were on out way to a costume party and…..” Dave explained. <br />
<br />
It was dark and the cop didn’t see how wet and stained Brian was and he cut Dave off right there and said, “You two should know better than to be around in a place like this!” <br />
<br />
Then the cop instructed them to get out of there immediately and not come back. <br />
Of course Dave agreed and didn’t hesitate to leave.<br />
<br />
The two of them managed two walk two blocks then hitch a ride with an elderly couple back to Dave’s apartment, totally unaware that two of the nerds had been following them.<br />
<br />
One nerd being the one that screwed Brian and was sure he was in love with her. The other was Darrel who swore on a stack of American online discs that he wouldn’t rest until he had taken that harem girl (Dave).<br />
<br />
Once inside Dave’s apartment Dave took off the harem costume and put on some shorts and T-shirt.<br />
Within minutes his breasts began to shrink and things turned back to normal.<br />
<br />
“Thank god!” he exclaimed and tossed a second pair of shorts and T-shirt to Brian. “Hurry and take that ridiculous negligee’ off “  Then he went to the fridge and grabbed a beer while Brian reluctantly undressed and then put on the clothes Dave had provided.<br />
<br />
Dave gulped the beer down then started on another. <br />
<br />
After a few Dave returned to the living room expecting to see Brian. But to his surprise Brian hadn’t changed back.<br />
<br />
“Oh no!” he said and went over to her lying on the couch, legs spread and touching herself.<br />
The sight of this large breasted slutty looking girl made Dave hard but he would never admit to it.<br />
“I don’t get it, did you take all of it off?” Dave said and Brian nodded, with a pouting look and bit his lip in frustration. <br />
<br />
Dave paced back and forth, trying to figure out why Brian didn’t change back when he himself did.<br />
Dave swallowed the last of the third can of beer and went for a fourth. He cracked it open, took a sip, and then ran back into the living room pointing his finger at Brian. “You had sex and I didn’t!” he said. <br />
Brian still pouting just nodded.<br />
“But that doesn’t seem it would prevent……..” Dave said then snapped his finger “I got it! Did you let any of them cum inside you, your pussy I mean?” <br />
Brian slipped his hand down on his supple tummy and said almost in tears “Yes, just one, Ben, but he was so nice to me and..”<br />
“Then that’s it!” Dave interrupted “You’re pregnant!”<br />
<br />
Brian started crying, babbling on that it felt so good and all. That he thinks Ben really cared and he thinks he loves Ben.<br />
<br />
“No you stupid bitch! They just wanted to bang you and toss you!” Dave yelled and gulped the rest of that beer.<br />
<br />
Brian started to sob, burring his face in a pillow.<br />
<br />
“We gotta fix this, and now!” Dave said and picked up Brian’s neglig&eacute;e’ and then his harem costume, put them in a paper sack. <br />
“We’re going back to the mall and that shop and set things straight!” he exclaimed as he put on his shoes, grabbed his second set of truck keys and some money.<br />
<br />
“Comon!” he demanded, but Brian refused “You’re mean to me, you go!” <br />
<br />
Dave shook his head and decided it best to leave her here especially since there were no shoes to fit and they would be walking.<br />
<br />
So he grabbed the paper bag and went to the bus stop.<br />
<br />
His first stop was to get his truck from behind the shop, then drive around front to enter the mall.<br />
<br />
It was going on eleven o-clock and the mall was closed.<br />
<br />
“Damn!” He said as he rattled the locked doors then walked back to his truck.<br />
<br />
He then drove around back, hoping to find a way in, but found none.<br />
<br />
He sat there in his parked truck in the back of the mall trying to decide what to do. <br />
<br />
He could go see his Buddy Steve, the one that they were supposed to jump out of the cake for, he might know what to do. Or maybe one of the guys that was at Steve’s bachelor party. Or maybe go back home for more beer and screw the hell out of Brian, she’d like that he thought.<br />
<br />
Just then one of the large sliding doors opens up, not too far from where his was. <br />
This might be a chance he thought.<br />
<br />
Then two men came out to unload a cargo truck parked outside. In the truck were mannequins, woman’s lingerie and boxes of other Victoria secrets things.<br />
<br />
<br />
Dave had the worst of ideas yet if successful would allow him access to the mall and possible the magic shop.<br />
So he carried out his plan by undressing and put on the  magic neglig&eacute;e Brian had wore. <br />
<br />
This time the changes happened twice as fast as before. He also felt a lot more buzzed from all the beer he drank not that his body had gotten smaller.<br />
<br />
Stealthfully he managed to get in past the two men and into the Victoria Secrets store where he waited for the men to leave while posing as a mannequin lying on a bed in the front display.</p>
