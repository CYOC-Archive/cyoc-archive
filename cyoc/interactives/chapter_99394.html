<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><i>Since it was December 24th when I posted this, <b>MERRY CHRISTMAS EVERYBODY!</b>—tmw2015</i><br />
<br />
Harry Jenkins held his fiance close as Jenny Harper felt the hardened shaft of her bonded life/mate enter her anxious body. The gray fox gently pushed his werevixen back a couple of steps to lay her across her bed in the dorm room. There was no hurry or rush. Jenny took great comfort from feeling his weight upon her, the way his chest fur felt against the hardened nipples of her breasts even as Harry continued kissing her and caressing every part of her curvy body that his paws could reach.<br />
The conjoined couple just continued to lay there, relishing in every moment of pleasure their intimate togetherness brought them; until romance slowly yielded to passion, and that was quickly consumed by rapidly building sexual lust.<br />
The werevixen wrapped furry legs around her fox as Harry started thrusting into Jenny faster. Soon fox tails wagged together in an erotic tempo as orgasmic bliss overcame them in unison.<br />
<br />
When it was all over, Jenny pressed her muzzle against Harry&#39;s shoulder and began to cry, but they were not tears of joy she expressed.<br />
&quot;Oh Harry. I don&#39;t know what to do,&quot; sobbed Jenny. &quot;They&#39;re gonna freak when they see my new body, even without the fur. I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if my folks really do try to stop the wedding and drag me back to Alabama.&quot;<br />
&quot;Over my dead body!&quot; swore Harry.<br />
&quot;Please don&#39;t give any of them that option. My dad might try to take you up on it! I&#39;ll consider it a minor miracle if he doesn&#39;t bring Dieter Wilhelm with them.&quot;<br />
&quot;Is that guy as bad as you said on the phone?&quot; asked Harry, trying to console his fiance.<br />
&quot;Drank like a fish and was a legend in his own mind, the last time I saw him. His family is the richest in our small town. His father got lucky in the state lottery back when I was in junior high, so technically none of them have to work, but they all certainly laud it over everyone else.&quot;<br />
&quot;Money isn&#39;t everything,&quot; pointed out Harry, as he gently started wiping Jenny&#39;s tears off her fur.<br />
<br />
&quot;True. When I marry, it <b>will be</b> for love, and you&#39;re the only one in my heart. Now and forever,&quot; said Jenny, before she kissed Harry.<br />
Fox muzzle pressed against muzzle as tongues danced together. When they finally broke the kiss, Jenny smiled at Harry and asked in a quiet voice, &quot;Do you want to know a secret?&quot;<br />
&quot;What?&quot; whispered Harry in return, glad that she was smiling, however briefly.<br />
&quot;My folks wouldn&#39;t let me go out on a date until the Spring semester of my senior year, and even then only if it was with Dieter. They don&#39;t know I was always having to fight him off. If they ever found out, they would have just said I was being a good religious girl and saving myself for marriage, but he always thought I was playing hard to get.&quot;<br />
Harry started issuing a low growl as Jenny added, &quot;The night of our high school graduation, Dieter thought I was finally going to let him have his way with me. Instead, I kicked him as hard in the nuts as I could.&quot;<br />
&quot;No,&quot; said Harry in a teasing voice, but thinking he would have done far worse if he was there.<br />
&quot;True. Why he never said anything to anyone, I don&#39;t know. Dieter certainly kept his distance from me until I left to come here. I just told my folks he was too busy at the power plant, and they never knew otherwise.&quot;<br />
&quot;You little vixen,&quot; Harry said with a smile before kissing Jenny again.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m <i>your</i> vixen Mister Jenkins,&quot; replied Jenny, before she started to nuzzle his neck. &quot;But as smart as you are, I&#39;m surprised you haven&#39;t figured the rest out yet,&quot; she admitted, before rolling them together on the bed until Harry&#39;s back was against the mattress.<br />
As her increased were libido took over, Jenny looked down and smiled at Harry as she began riding his re-stiffening member, driving it deeper into her than before.<br />
Harry smiled and licked his muzzle before he started massaging one breast and tweaking the nipple of the other with his tongue. Jenny bent down a little more to allow her finance to suckle at her teat.<br />
The Fennec fox started riding her gray mate faster as he switched his actions between breasts, but soon had to settle for simply massaging Jenny&#39;s breasts as Harry felt his penis penetrate her even further.<br />
Jenny started moaning &quot;yes... my... love...&quot; even as Harry struggled to last just a little longer, but it was a losing battle as the happy couple shuddered in mutual pleasure.<br />
<br />
Spent, Jenny laid against Harry. She wrapped her arms around him the best she could as she snuggled on his left shoulder, and then fell asleep with a smile on her muzzle.<br />
He let her lay there, content in listening to the steady rhythm of her breathing, when it finally dawned on him what she meant earlier.<br />
<i>I <b>was</b> her first! And giving herself to me was an act of <b>true</b> love!</i> Harry realized, which (to his great surprise) suddenly made the life/mate bond between them even stronger than it was before.<br />
Harry Jenkins started shedding a few tears of his own as he kissed his fiance, but his were tears of joy. <i>She means so much to me, and I to her.</i><br />
Before he fell asleep, Harry silently renewed his personal vow that nothing and no one was ever going to hurt Jenny Harper ever again. Not even her own family. First thing in the morning, he would call Tachibana no Akane and warn the Skulk leader of the impending storm on the horizon.<br />
<br />
