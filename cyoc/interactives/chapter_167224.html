<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dion stared at his girl parts with shock.  How could this happen?  Then he realized that he fell before any tingling happened there.  He was so close too.  He felt the tingling in his thighs and butt and chest before he fell.  He must not have finished the transformation back! He promised himself that he would always clean his room from now on.    <br />
Frustrated that he still had to do it, he sat on the toilet to pee.  When he was done, he wiped from front to back instinctively.  Looking closely at the opening between his legs, he noted a little bit of hair.   Must come with the couple years he had aged.  He wondered if he would have the same hair on his boy parts when he got them back.  While he was thinking, he didn&#39;t notice that his hips changed every so slightly and changed how he sat on the toilet seat.  He stood up and shimmied into his boxers and jeans without any second thoughts.  Dion got up and washed his hands.  Looking in the mirror, at least he look like himself while he decided on his next move.<br />
He walked down the hall to his bedroom.  He went back to his desk to contemplate his next move.  He couldn&#39;t use the medallion for another 12 hours, but he wanted to be ready when the time came.   The jeans he now wore didn&#39;t finish the job, so he may need something more masculine that has not been warn before.   He was writing down a list of options. He shifted a little in his chair, rocking his bum back and forth, enjoying the cushion on his seat.   <br />
&quot;Wait a minute, there is no cushion on my desk chair...&quot; thought Dion.<br />
He stood up and his chair looked the same.  He reached to his butt<br />
&quot;Is there something on my pants?&quot; he thought while he put his hand on his butt<br />
It felt a little bit...curvier...than he remembered.  Maybe that was something else that didn&#39;t finish.  It had only tingled for a short time before he tripped.   Was it that way before he went to the bathroom?  Dion realized he hadn&#39;t given his butt any thought before his bathroom break.  He made a mental note of this change, and got back to his list.<br />
&quot;Jock strap,  football jersey, boxers.&quot; Dion continued to write.  He also started to make a list of where to get the stuff.  The easiest way was to invite a friend over for a sleep over.  Maybe he could invite Henry and Davis to be safe.  They could each bring a couple things.  He could then let them in on his secret and help them with the medallion.<br />
While Dion was in his world for a couple hours, this world was changing.   It was only little things for now, like the knobs on his dresser, the Carpet turning from white to off while and his headboard changing from a black to a grey, but there were changes.  His jeans started to fit his thighs a little differently and his waist became slightly concave.<br />
Finally, Dion stood up with his plan. He walked to his mom&#39;s room and knocked on the door.<br />
&quot;Yes Dion?&quot;<br />
&quot;Mom, can I invite over Henry and Davis?  We haven&#39;t had a sleepover in a while, so I was hoping to have them here.&quot;<br />
&quot;Honey, I&#39;ll ask their parents about doing it tomorrow night.  You&#39;ve had a busy week this week with boy scout, picture day and I want you to get some sleep tonight.&quot;<br />
&quot;Ok mom, but can I call them?&quot;<br />
&quot;Sure dear.  You can call your friends tonight, and I&#39;ll call their parents after you go to sleep.&quot;<br />
Dion went to the phone in the kitchen and dialed up his friends.  Henry was the first one he called.  He asked if he was free for a sleepover with him and Davis, and Henry said he would do his homework tomorrow so he can watch movies with Dion tomorrow.  He seemed really excited.  Dion then asked him to bring a new football jersey, since his was torn.  Henry said he could do that, but Dion owed him.    While he was talking to Henry, he started to twirl his fingers in the phone cord.  He also noted that his jeans felt loose in the thighs and calves, but not his butt. <br />
Davis, however, couldn&#39;t come because he was visiting his relatives out of state, but he wanted to hang out Sunday when he got back.    So much for the jock strap. At least he would have a couple options with Henry coming.  <br />
Hanging up the phone, he went upstairs and went back to his room.  His plan was coming together.  He put the medallion back into the bag and hid it in a new places that Holly would never find.<br />
Now that he wasn&#39;t focused on his plan, and hiding the medallion, he noted some changes in the room.   He saw the headboard and the carpet.  Worried, Dion closed and locked his door.  He note the time was 5pm, so dinner would probably be in about an hour.  He pulled down his pants and saw his legs where longer, but thinner.  There was no hair on his legs.  He also saw his hips flared out a bit, pushing is tighty whities.  He started to panic, because he knew he had boxers on earlier today in the bathroom.  He pulled off the underwear and noticed something, there was no opening in the front.  They were white panties!<br />
Dion started to panic.  He was changing back.  Taking deep breaths, he realized that he wasn&#39;t getting younger.  He was changing back into a girl, but one a couple years older.</p>
