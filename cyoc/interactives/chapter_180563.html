<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Species,&quot; June stammered. Ty grinned, as he gazed at the willowy teenage girl in front of him. The girl before him was so much different from the woman he had come to know. June, as a late bloomer, was meek, lacking confidence. It amazed him that 15 year old June was in many ways, him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey,&quot; Ty said softly. &quot;Come here.&quot; June obliged, scooting close to Ty as he now held her close, the girl trembling in his arms. &quot;Your shaking.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I..I was really shy as a kid,&quot; June replied meekly, pulling her legs to her chest. &quot;I was tall, well for a girl. Couple that with the fact I was um...a late bloomer and well, not exactly a recipe for confidence.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty nodded, stroking June&#39;s hair as the girls breathing became rapid. He had to admit he like this vulnerable side of June. Now though a new thought crossed his mind. If 15 year old June was this shy, what was an even younger June like?<br />
<br />
June gasped as she felt Ty&#39;s transformative powers wash over her yet again. Looking at herself, she watched her body diminish ever so slightly. &quot;Hey,&quot; she exclaimed, noting her pitch rise in tenor. &quot;What&#39;s the big idea?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What,&quot; Ty grinned.<br />
<br />
&quot;You made me even younger,&quot; June exclaimed, leaping to her feet June now stood before Ty. &quot;I&#39;m only 14.&quot; Waves of embarrassment now flashes through June&#39;s mind. The teens body was boyish, lean, with breasts that wouldnt even fill a B cup. Quickky she now grabbed one of Tys discarded tshirts, throwing it over her nude body. Unfortunately for her she was still taller than Ty, meaning she now tried pulling it down to cover herself.<br />
<br />
Ty chuckled softly, he didnt think it was possible but June appeared even shyer with just the loss of a year. Focusing his power he watched as June shrank back another year. The now 13 year old letting out a childish gasp as she relived a growth spurt in reverse, her breasts reducing to a pair of puffy nipples as her face rounded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Cut it out,&quot; June whined, throwing her hands over her mouth. Had that been her voice? She sounded so childish, her voice high and shrill, lacking almost no maturity. <br />
<br />
&quot;What,&quot; Ty said coyly. &quot;Dont tell me you weren&#39;t into boys yet?&quot;<br />
<br />
June felt her throat go dry, her face blushing hot and crimson. &quot;N..no,&quot; she stammered, shocked to find herself feeling so flustered despite her adult mind. &quot;I, I like boys but..um...well, boys thought I was ugly. They called me Giganta and the girls called me Bee sting because I didnt have boobs.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty now stood slowly, June&#39;s wide eyes growing larger as Ty seemed to loom over her. June was tall for 13 but still shorter than the Ty. &quot;You dont look so tall to me,&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
June simply gaped at Ty, she felt so vulnerable in front of the now older teen. The adult part of her mind trying to remain rational while her young 13 year old persona was flabbergasted to be nearly naked in front of a high school boy.<br />
<br />
It now wished June even younger, the girl gasping as shrank back into a preteen of 12. &quot;Hey,&quot; she whined, her voice rising in octave as she grew younger. &quot;Stop it! I&#39;m. I&#39;m getting even younger!&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty simply nodded, rubbing his chin as he gazed at a 12 year old June. June had relived yet another growth spurt in reverse, the tshirt now covering her more comfortably. &quot;I&#39;m not even a teenager anymore,&quot; she whispered as she gazed at her dainty hands.<br />
<br />
Ty smirked, June was becoming more sheepish by the moment as he slowly reversed puberty on June. The girl was incredibly shy, awkward, withdrawing more and more into herself. &quot;So had you had your first kiss yet at this age June?&quot;<br />
<br />
June began to stammer, feeling as if she would die of embarrassment. &quot;N..no,&quot; she whimpered, averting her eyes. &quot;I..I didnt have my first kiss until I was 14. That&#39;s a ways off now.&quot; June tried to focus, she wasnt this awkward preteen girl anymore.<br />
<br />
As June was about to say something, she felt the transformative powers wash over her again. &quot;Nooooo,&quot; she whined, her voice becoming childish as she shrank in height once again. &quot;Stop it,&quot; she cried as she became 11. &quot;I&#39;m turning into a little girl.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well your still tall for 11,&quot; Ty countered.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know what I mean,&quot; June replied, craning her neck upwards. &quot;I&#39;m feeling more and more like a kid.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty nodded, wat hung as June shrank once more becoming 10, his shirt now resting mid though on the tall child. June let out a squeak, as she now shifted nervously in place. &quot;Take a seat June,&quot; Ty said, patting the bed.<br />
<br />
Despite June&#39;s misgivings, she now lacked the confidence to say no. She was a child, a shy, awkward child. Lowering her head, she now sat next to the teen, amazed at how young she had become. &quot;I&#39;m so small,&quot; she whispered, noting her tiny feet were barely able to stay on the floor.<br />
<br />
&quot;And shy,&quot; Ty added. &quot;Do you still feel anything, from before?&quot;<br />
<br />
June blushed again, she remembered what her and Ty did but now it frightened her. Did people do that with each other? Being naked like that? It was really weird and scary. Looking at Ty, her young heart fluttered, like a child looking at Prince Charming. &quot;No,&quot; she whispered. &quot;But, I think I have a school girl crush.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So you still like me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ew not like that,&quot; June said quickly, cursing under her breath as she realized the childishness of her answer. &quot;Wow this is just so weird,&quot; she said. &quot;I know I&#39;m supposed to be a grown up but the younger I get the more I feel like a kid.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty simply nodded, noting that June did indeed seem to be reverting back to the shy child she used to be. Would June begin to forget being an adult if she got any younger?<br />
<br />
June shuddered, feeling the transformative powers of Ty wash over her. Instead of arousing her, it felt more like a tickle now. Looking at her feet she could see them grow smaller, her heels rising from the floor. &quot;Stop it,&quot; she giggled. &quot;That tickles and I&#39;m getting really small now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty didnt listen, June squealing as she shrank down to 8. &quot;Cut it out,&quot; she whined, her toes now just brushing the floor from her seated position. Ty smiled, noting June&#39;s face rounding, her body becoming even skinnier as the neck hole of his tshirt seemed to widen around the girl.<br />
<br />
June jumped off the bed as she shrank down to 7. The girls eyes went wide as her feet floated off the floor. It frightened her that she was so young now. June&#39;s adult mind was becoming foggier, Ty seemed so big and intimidating now. Trying to adjust the tshirt, she noted one of her shoulders was poking out. &quot;Your being mean,&quot; the girl pouted. &quot;I&#39;m leaving.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty chuckled at June&#39;s childish outburst. The girls persona was more child than adult now. Ty noted how his tshirt now rested just above her knees, June certainly had been tall even as a child. Still, he couldnt let her leave.<br />
<br />
As June now walked towards the door, she felt Ty&#39;s power wash over her. Gasping in fright, she realized she was growing smaller, younger. The hem of the tshirt descending down her skinny legs. &quot;Nooo,&quot; she whined as she hit 6 and raced towards 5. June now tried to hurry forward, each step sending her further into childhood.<br />
<br />
By the time June reached the door, she was a girl of 3. The girl transitioning from child to toddler. The shirt puddling around her tiny feet and barely clinging to her pudgy body. Hitting 2, June now found herself reaching upwards, her tiny toddler hands having difficulty turning the handle. June was frightened, her mind racing. The big boy was doing something but her young mind was having trouble remembering what that was. <br />
<br />
The changes from 2 to 1 astonished Ty. June was shrinking rapidly, her face rounding with baby fat. The toddler wobbled, her shirt falling away as she grew too young. Finally hitting 1 June fell onto her tiny butt, the naked baby was now too young to walk. <br />
<br />
June began to whimper, her mouth hurt. She had felt her teeth receding into her gums as she grew younger. She felt herself weaken, her body losing strength as her mind blanked. The adult part of her that still resided inside her was shocked at her predicament. Now she watched as Ty reached down, frightening the girl as she felt herself scooped into her arms.<br />
<br />
&quot;Its okay baby girlc Ty cooed, trying to soothe the infant June. &quot;I&#39;ll never let anything bad happen to you.&quot;<br />
<br />
June tried to respond, shocked to her infantile banter exit her mouth. As Ty now lay the stunned infant back on the bed. Ty would return June back to 15, and decide what else to transform her into.</p>
