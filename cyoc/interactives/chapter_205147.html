<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Days before Troy arrived…<br />
<br />
Danny felt like he was in a dream, surpassing his limits every day he ventured to Yuyaku&#39;s room for training. It was a job…but it was a surprisingly fun and interesting job. Learning the ins and outs of working on a stage and how to conceal things from the audience was really interesting. Real magic didn’t need it, but with stagecraft, it was enhanced.<br />
<br />
The first day he came he was terrified that Yuyaku would notice that he was missing his Chips. He was sweating when he knocked on the door but Yuyaku just smiled and let him in. It was profoundly reliving to know he was going to get away with it, but Danny found he had a second problem: He had a guilty conscious.<br />
<br />
“Okay,” Yuyaku clapped his paws together, “Are you ready for your first day of training, Dmitri?”<br />
<br />
“Dmitri?”<br />
<br />
“It’s your stage name.” Yuyaku shrugged. “You’re a Siberian tiger, Ivan is a Siberian tiger. You are sexy twins from Russia. The audience gobbles this stuff up. Or are you seriously going to call yourself Danny?”<br />
<br />
“...I guess not.”<br />
<br />
“It’s a lot like wearing a mask. You aren’t on stage, your character is.” Yuyaku smiled. “Helps with stage fright.”<br />
<br />
Danny grumbled to himself, but he really couldn’t complain. It did fit, and Yuyaku was an expert showman.<br />
<br />
Yuyaku turned away from Danny and waved his paws. <br />
<br />
The room began to shift from an elaborate ballroom into a stage with a back room and a row of audience seats. Scoot entered from stage left, carrying most of the heavy stuff into place, using a rope tied against his bare chest. Ivan was laying in the corner, still dressed in his shorts, stretching. He’d lift his muscular legs high up against his firm belly, bring them almost all the way down to the floor, and back again. Danny stared at Ivan’s firm ass, his own shorts tenting.<br />
<br />
Scoot hurried past, carrying hoops and hurdles, blocking Danny’s view of the tiger’s well-muscled ass, and Danny blinked. <br />
<br />
He was really into that tiger. Danny hoped they weren’t actually going to be twins and Yuyaku was just embellishing things to be more exotic. He really wanted to feel his own furry cock as he penetrated that firm ass-<br />
<br />
Sounds interrupted his thoughts. <br />
<br />
Danny turned.<br />
<br />
Behind him, a group of people-twenty-walked into the room, Yuyaku leading them. Some of the people walking in stared at him critically, others looked bored, while some appeared excited. Danny’s stomach did little flips as he realized what Yuyaku was bringing: a live audience. <br />
<br />
If he fucked up, it wouldn’t just be Yuyaku and Ivan and Scoot who knew, but these twenty strangers as well.<br />
<br />
“Who are those people?” Dmitri hissed at Yuyaku.<br />
<br />
“Oh, these guys?” Yuyaku frowned. “They’re Blanks I gave a few chips to, obviously. Is there something wrong?”<br />
<br />
“On my first day? I’m gonna mess up!”<br />
<br />
“Well, yes, that’s the point.” Yuyaku blinked and handed Dmitri a bottle of water. “Training stage fright out of you is important. Screwing up in front of an audience, getting laughed at, they’re all things you need to get over. Now get ready and stand over there.”<br />
<br />
Training lasted a full 8 hours of having to perform tricks, jump through hoops with Ivan, learning choreography. It was all rather exhausting. At first he was self-conscious of doing anything on stage half-naked, but it turned out Yuyaku was right. Performing as Dmitri made the embarrassment seem distant. By the time they were done, Dan was covered in sweat and very happy he’d saved that water bottle Yuyaku had handed to him hours ago.<br />
<br />
Dan..no, Dmitri now, took the bottle of water and drank. Sweat glistened on his light treasure trail of fur that ran down his chest. He found himself having a hard time drinking for some reason. His whole face was pushing out, teeth growing, and it was extremely sore, though the process went wholly unnoticed by Dmitri. <br />
<br />
Feeling overheated and exhausted, Dmitri poured the rest of the water over his head. The cool water rushed down his hair, acting like a hair styling product, the messy white hair slicking itself back like Ivan’s. Wherever the water dripped, his light fur seemed to blossom, becoming thicker, and spreading.<br />
<br />
The fur on the back of his neck prickled, and Dmitri realized the audience was watching him.<br />
<br />
So let them watch, a voice whispered in the back of his head.<br />
<br />
Dmitri flexed, muscles bulging and-unnoticed-swelling larger. His lengthening tail twitched behind him as he walked towards a mirror on the wall, wanting to observe the audience’s reaction. His body was feeling strangely stiff, so he rolled his thickening shoulders and stretched, spine popping as he grew an inch taller.<br />
<br />
A strong pair of paws grasped his shoulders, and Dmitri saw Ivan behind him. The other tiger massaged Dmitri’s shoulders and Dmitri leaned back into the larger tiger’s embrace. He felt his swelling backside bump gently against a growing bulge in Ivan’s shorts, his own shorts bulging in response. Dmitri realized he wanted this-he wanted to be fucked in the ass right here on stage by his brother-<br />
<br />
-Dmitri shook his head. <br />
<br />
What an odd fucking thought. Ivan sensed his sudden discomfort and released his grip tossing a towel at Dmitri and made his way to a snack table Yuyaku or Scoot must have set up while they were training. It was full of all kinds of chips and pizzas and bottles of water and soda. Everyone was there-Scoot, Yuyaku-even the Blanks were helping themselves, talking and laughing and complimenting Dmitri on his hard work.<br />
<br />
Dmitri smiled and blushed at their compliments, but he wasn’t sure if he’d trust the opinions of slaves.<br />
<br />
“I didn’t order them to do that.” Yuyaku said, sidling up next to Dmitri as he chowed down on a piece of pizza. “The Blanks. I didn’t order them to compliment you. Those are their real feelings.”<br />
<br />
“Huh.” Dmitri nodded. “I was kind of surprised at how much work you’re having me put into this. Do you really need a second assistant that bad?”<br />
<br />
“Absolutely!” Yuyaku stared at Dmitri as though he were an idiot. “A magic show is a team effort, even if it’s centered on the magician himself.”<br />
<br />
“So is this a party for our future victory, or…” Dmitri gestured at the table.<br />
<br />
“No, my poor ignorant boy, that’s simply the craft services table.” Yuyaku grinned. “Though I shouldn’t be too hard on a Russian country bumpkin for not knowing what that is.”<br />
<br />
Dmitri rolled his eyes. “Yeah, yeah…”<br />
<br />
“Besides, celebrating too soon just leads to later disappointment. Besides, win or lose, we still celebrate as long as the audience enjoys the show this time.”<br />
<br />
“Why are you so concerned with what the audience thinks?”<br />
<br />
“Why am I…!?” Yuyaku sputtered. “Stage magic is a performance! Haven’t I told you that? I perform my craft to be a beacon of inspiration to others, a stepping stone for future magicians to cross into legend!”<br />
<br />
“How so?” Dmitri shrugged. “It just magic show, no?” <br />
<br />
“Sorry, your accent is a bit strong, can you repeat that?” Yuyaku smiled. <br />
<br />
“Erm, I mean, it’s just a magic show, right?” Dmitri blinked, wondering why he’d spoken so oddly. <br />
<br />
“Think of it like this: athletes in the Olympics train to be the best at what they excel at. For them, it means winning a gold medal, but to future athletes, they’ve created a mark that needs to be passed. Even art and cooking games will change over time as new methods of cooking and preparation are developed. Molecular gastronomy wasn’t a thing until, like, the eighties.” Yuyaku smiled and leaned against the wall. “What I’m saying is, I wasn’t angry that my tricks were leaked. I was angry that those tricks are now ruined because the mysticism behind them is gone. Trying to guess how another magician does a trick is, like, the funnest part of learning to become a master magician. The testing involved is what develops someone into a great magician, not just copying.”<br />
<br />
“The attempt at duplication can create new avenues for innovation, yadda yadda?”<br />
<br />
“Precisely!”” Yuyaku nodded.<br />
<br />
“But aren’t you concerned about losing your perfect win streak. I mean, paving the way to the future is noble and all, but it sounds like cope.”<br />
<br />
“Cope.” Yuyaku scoffed. “Yes, I admit it perturbed me to lose so unfairly. But I’m bound to lose at some point in my career. It would be much more embarrassing to lose in twenty years after maintaining a perfect score. They’d say the old man was losing his touch.”<br />
<br />
“And the chips play zero role in any of this?” Dmitri raised a brow.<br />
<br />
“Don’t be a fool, of course they do.” Yuyaku said. “But I could never simply do a job for money.”<br />
<br />
“When I was flipping burgers, I wasn’t wanking off about paving the way to the future with my spatula.” Dmitri said. “I was just trying to keep up with my rent.”<br />
<br />
“Fine, let me show you something.” Yuyaku gestured for Dmitri to follow him.<br />
<br />
They left the room and made their way to the Floor of Body.<br />
<br />
Below them, many contests were happening. It was difficult to see what, exactly, Yuyaku wanted to show him. The tug-of-war? The wrestling that made Dmitri adjust his shorts? Dmitri turned, a questioning look on his face.<br />
<br />
“There.” Yuyaku pointed at the arm wrestling table. “Watch.”<br />
<br />
Dmitri directed his gaze towards the table. A strong-looking but rather flabby orc was arm wrestling a thin, athletic man. The orc was laughing, not taking the game seriously. The human, on the other hand, was clearly straining to keep his arm up. <br />
<br />
Suddenly, the human began to change, bulking, growing hairier, his features swelling into a muzzle. Soon, the orc was arm wrestling an anthro-bear. The tables had turned, and now it was the orc who was straining, desperate to keep his arm off the table.<br />
<br />
“How did he turn into a bear so suddenly? Is he a werebear?”<br />
<br />
“Haven’t you been paying attention?” Yuyaku smiled. “He used a Body chip after fooling his opponent into taking the match. You can’t transform your opponent mid-match, but nothing in the rules say you can’t transform yourself.”<br />
<br />
The orc’s arm hit the table and the bear roared in triumph.<br />
<br />
“The kid won because he used his brains in a body competition.” Yuyaku said. “That orc was destined to lose the moment he targeted the kid as an easy mark.”<br />
<br />
The bear shifted back into a human, holding the orc’s chips in the air. The orc seemed angry at first, and then began to laugh.<br />
<br />
“See? Even though he lost, the orc still respects the human. It was a good trick, turning the tables on him.” Yuyaku said. “I’ll bet he never forgets what happened . He’ll begin to take things seriously.”<br />
<br />
“Da.” Dmitri nodded<br />
<br />
“And that, my Siberian friend, is why I do magic as a competitive performance art.” Yuyaku nodded. “That right there is a story in and of itself. I’m not just telling my story, I’m fighting someone else’s. It’s high speed improv.”<br />
<br />
“It is a fun sport then, da?”<br />
<br />
“Da.” Yuyaku smiled. “I’ll see you tomorrow. The real performance is in three days.”<br />
<br />
Dmitri smiled vacantly, still watching the human and orc talk at the table. His mind was preoccupied with his life in Siberia, learning tricks, performing with his brother. It had been fun. The two of them looked over in his direction. He blushed and left the Floor, walking towards his hotel, realizing his shorts were tented. If he were back home in Russia-<br />
<br />
-Dmitri shook his head. <br />
<br />
What was getting into him? Russia? He’d never even been to Russia! <br />
<br />
Memories-possibly real memories-of living together and learning tricks to impress audiences were filtering into his mind. Noticing them didn’t make them suddenly go away, it made his mind seem foreign and untrustworthy. Still, even knowing his memories were false, he felt his bond with Ivan was growing faster than it should. He literally felt like a brother, that was the weird thing. It was going to make betraying Yuyaku and Ivan even harder…<br />
<br />
He rounded the corner to his hallway, lost in thought, trying to sort real memories from false, when his nose caught a very familiar scent that had his mouth watering and cock hardening. Dmitri looked up just in time to get a face full of ogre gut. <br />
<br />
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=<br />
<br />
Dmitri hit the ground and stared up at the grinning face of Deng-Long’s ogre friend.<br />
<br />
“Making you a copy of Ivan, eh Danny boy?” the Ogre leered.<br />
<br />
“It’s Dmitri.” Dmitri said, eyeing the ogre’s arm pit.<br />
<br />
“Wow, he sure worked fast on you.” The Ogre shook his head, “Poor bastard. Fighting with memories of growing up in Russia like loyal Ivan? I sold him out for even trying that on me.”<br />
<br />
“He took in a nobody like me,” Dmitri managed to object despite his straining erection. “I have to admit I’m…terrified of being erased, but look at me!”<br />
<br />
The ogre picked up Dmitri with one hand and inspected him. Dmitri squirmed as the ogre prodded his body with one finger, giving his boner a thumb rub. The ogre chuckled as Dmitri whined needily.<br />
<br />
“I prefer goblinoids, honestly.” The ogre mumbled, thumb pressing on the tiger’s bulge. “This furry shit is weird. I wonder what you’ll be when I’m done with you.”<br />
<br />
“W-what’s your name?” Dmitri whimpered. “And why would you wanna change me?”<br />
<br />
“Mothar.” The ogre wasn’t even looking at Dmitri, his thumb idly stroking Dmitri’s hefty meat stick, completely lost in thought. “Tiger is fine for now, but you need a form to hide from Yuyaku. Probably an orc with some meat on his bones. Into leather and cigars and whiskey.”<br />
<br />
“What?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah,” The ogre rummaged in his belt-pouch and pulled out two chips. Both Mind. “You’re gonna be hot when I’m done with you.”<br />
<br />
“Wait, don’t!” Dmitri squealed, terrified of any more memories he’d have to contend with.<br />
<br />
The ogre ignored him and pressed the chips into the back of Dmitri’s skull.<br />
<br />
Dmitri shivered, tasting copper, but nothing seemed to happen.<br />
<br />
“Mind chips, stupid, not Body.” Mothar chuckled, seeing the confused look on Dmitri’s face. “I only adjusted your tastes. No reality bending until after the magic show.”<br />
<br />
“Oh.” Dmitri frowned. “Is that what you wanted from me?”<br />
<br />
“What was I doing here…” Mothar blinked. “Oh, right! The boss wants you to come to the pre-victory party!”<br />
<br />
“If Yuyaku or any of his crew sees me there, then…”<br />
<br />
“Nah, don’t worry, the boss has it handled. Follow me.” The ogre dumped Dmitri on the ground and walked off.<br />
<br />
Dmitri scrambled to his feet and ran after him.<br />
<br />
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=--=<br />
<br />
Mothar stopped in front of a room at the end of Dmitri’s hall. A privacy curtain-not a door-was all that kept Dmitri from seeing in. Mothar pulled the curtain aside and stepped in, grabbing Dmitri as he did and pulling him with.<br />
<br />
Inside the room, which was as big as Yuyaku&#39;s dressing room, was a nightclub. Music blared and lights flashed. Dancers swung on chain, elevated pulls, high up in cages strung from the ceiling. A small crowd was dancing on the club’s floor. The smell of sex and smoke filled the air.<br />
<br />
Deng-Long himself sat in a VIP booth, thrusting into the ass of a kobold in leather gear. Next to the Kirin was a stegosaurus, stuffing his face with expensive steaks and caviar. A fuckbot and Drider sat in the corner of the booth, looking aloof and annoyed.<br />
<br />
Deng-Long smiled when he saw Dmitri and waved the two of them over, shucking the kobold off his cock and kicking him across the room. <br />
<br />
“Heeey! Danny Boy! Come in, have a seat.” Deng-Long grinned, indicating his throbbing cock. “You deserve a treat for that acting job you pulled today! Foxy don’t suspect a thing!”<br />
<br />
“What’s wrong with him?” Dmitri whispered to Mothar.<br />
<br />
Mothar smirked and pointed at lines of cocaine on the table in front of Deng-Long.<br />
<br />
“Ah.” Dmitri cleared his throat, plastering a smile on his face. “Call me Dmitri, I’m trying to keep in character. And uh, are you sure these people are trustworthy?”<br />
<br />
“Pfft.” Deng-Long, flicked his claws dismissively. “He’s calling you Dmitri? How cliche. And, uh, as far as these ‘people’.” Deng-Long made quote marks in the air. “They’re just Blanks, Dmitri. If they don’t wanna end up featureless dolls, they won’t say a peep.”<br />
<br />
“Oh.” Dmitri went to sit and found himself stumbling and dropping into Deng-Long’s lap.<br />
<br />
“There we go!” Deng-Long chuckled and nestled Dmitri so the dragon-horse&#39;s cock was on his furry back. “Nice and comfy! I presume that you didn’t get caught, then?”<br />
<br />
“Nope.” Dmitri felt something pressing against the back of his head and shivered, tasting copper on his tongue. He wondered what that was, but nothing about him seemed different. He wriggled himself into a comfortable position on the sexy dragon-horse’s lap. “He trained me, Sir. Agility, speed, and techniques.”<br />
<br />
“Good!” Deng-Long clapped. “As long as he doesn’t suspect a thing, we can make sure the rewards are all ours.”<br />
<br />
“If we beat him, we’ll be a major contender for a Book!” Mothar said eagerly. “I’ve gotten a bunch of newbies and gullible idiots to bet on Akita.”<br />
<br />
“What if people bet on you? You’re clearly no slouch, Sir.” Dmitri pointed out.<br />
<br />
“Because I purposefully take dives every couple of rounds.” Deng-Long smirked. “I purposefully lose to fledgling magicians. Then I demand a rematch and bet everything I have. They think I’m an easy win, so they go all in…and then I have a new Blank to play with.”<br />
<br />
“What’s the goal of all of this?” Dmitri asked, confused. “It just doesn’t seem like having Blanks is an advantage.”<br />
<br />
“The more Blanks he has, the more he can use them to make bets in his place.” Mothar said. “Even newbies are worth something when they’re basically slaves.”<br />
<br />
“Yup.” Deng-Long smiled confidently. “And when we win and they all lose, I reckon maybe half of them are going to end up my personal Blanks. We’ll be so freaking rich in Chips and Blanks, we’ll get invited to the Back Table.”<br />
<br />
“Back Table?”<br />
<br />
“It’s a bet with the owners. If you beat them, you get a Book.”<br />
<br />
“What so special about a book?” Dmitri asked. <br />
<br />
The entire table, save the Drider, laughed.<br />
<br />
“It’s the Book of Time. The owner used it to create the Mag Mell and all the impossible things here.” The stegosaurus burped. “In my universe a guy used a Book and made an elephant and a whale appear out of nowhere.<br />
<br />
“That sounds incredible.”<br />
<br />
“It is!” said the stegosaurus.<br />
<br />
“I mean I don’t believe it.” Dmitri said. <br />
<br />
“I would concur.” Deng-long said slowly. “Most of the stories seem far-fetched. But simply compare it to the casino and it is tame and limited in comparison.”<br />
<br />
“Yes,” The stegosaurus said. “And the only way to get to that Back Table is to win enough and have them notice that you might pose a real challenge to them.”<br />
<br />
“And once we win the Book, there’s nothing that can stop me.” Deng-Long snorted.<br />
<br />
“But what about fighting fairly?” Dmitri asked.<br />
<br />
The table went silent.<br />
<br />
“Are you backing out?” Deng-Long asked. <br />
<br />
“No. I mean, you should be able to win regardless.”<br />
<br />
“Listen, kid, the time for that is long past.” Deng-Long shook his head. “Fair is all good and shit, but playing the long game is just tedious and annoying. We can’t beat them unless we do something unpredictable.”<br />
 <br />
“But why go this far? Even if the Book is super powerful, is it worth the lives of hundreds of people?”<br />
<br />
“How many Kirins have you seen?” Deng-Long asked, suddenly serious. “Or an eight-tailed kitsune for that matter. I <I>appeared</I>, Dmitri, I have no family that I can remember. So when I realized what the Book was, what it could do, I had to wonder: was I changed? If So, who was I? Once I get that Book, I’ll have some answers.”<br />
<br />
“The Book might get you the answers you want, but turning hundreds of people into Blanks just to have that answer is essentially kill them.”<br />
<br />
“Killing them? Are you serious?” Deng-Long laughed. “They’re Blanks!”<br />
<br />
Dimitri shook his head but stayed silent.<br />
<br />
“Hey, they chose to bet their Chips. That’s on them.” the Kirin shrugged.<br />
<br />
“You’re fine with it, but I’m not. The deal is off.” Dimitri replied.<br />
<br />
Dmitri stood and tried to storm off, but his legs refused to budge. Something compelled him to stay, mentally. He gasped and glanced down at Deng-Long, who smirked.<br />
<br />
“I didn’t tell you that you you could leave, did I?” Deng-Long gestured at the table. “Sit down.”<br />
<br />
Dimitri felt his legs moved on his own as he find himself sitting back to the table. <br />
<br />
“What the hell did you do to me!?” Dimitri grunted in frustration.<br />
<br />
“I just give you a command.” Deng-Long shrugged.<br />
<br />
“But I’m not a blank!”<br />
<br />
“But you are <I>chipless</I>.” Deng-Long pointed out. “Even if you’re not a blank, whoever holds your chips controls you”<br />
<br />
“But you aren’t holding them!” Dmitri shouted. “You bid them! That was the deal!”<br />
<br />
“Ah, you should have paid more attention. The handshake was to give up your ownership of your chips. I never agreed to anything beyond that, except that you would win chips. And you will.” Deng-Long smirked. “You can win all the chips you want as my property”<br />
<br />
Dmitri’s eyes widened. <br />
<br />
He’d been tricked! He couldn’t believe he’d given himself up so easily. He glanced behind him at the ogre, who just chuckled and pressed his belly against Dmitri’s head. The smell of Mothar’s musk sent Dmitri’s head spinning.<br />
<br />
“Mothar’s musk is very useful at breaking down the inhibitions of anyone who gets a good whiff of him.” Deng-Long smirked. “Perfect for getting morons to agree to bad deals.”<br />
<br />
Dimitri growled and tried to lounge forward, but Mothar wrapped his arms around Dmitri’s thick neck.<br />
<br />
Mothar flexed. <br />
<br />
Dmitri choked, forced to take a gulp of air, and inhaled a heavy dose of Mothar’s musk.<br />
<br />
Mothar wrapped his arms around Dmitri’s neck, forcing Dmitri to breathe in.<br />
<br />
Dmitri tried to struggle, but the combination of mouth-watering musk from the dragon-horse’s juicy cock and the ogre’s scent were too much for him to handle. Overwhelmed, he sagged in the ogre’s grip, mouth lolling open.  <br />
<br />
Deng-Long brought his hot, throbbing bone in front of Dmitri’s face. <br />
<br />
Dmitri gulped, eyes transfixed.<br />
<br />
The red spire was glistening with precum, a dollop of which swelled at the tip. Mothar pulled down the only article of clothing Dmitri wore-his silvery shorts, revealing Dmitri’s own throbbing maleness. The ogre’s other hand slipped down to Dmitri’s ass, squeezing it.<br />
<br />
Dimitri wanted to stop the ogre, object, but he needed that dragon’s throbbing cock! His blackening nose glistened in the club’s lights as he sniffed the meat in front of him, panting in desperation. Drool slipped down the side of his mouth. <br />
<br />
“But I-I was promised I would have chips!” Dmitri gasped in a last, vain effort to ignore his growing lust.<br />
<br />
“Of course!” Deng-Long smiled. “I’ll let you use my chips when I claim you as mine. Akita will never find you after I change your form, so you won’t have to worry about all that drama. Now suck!” <br />
<br />
Dimitri tried to clench his mouth shut, but as the cock loomed ever closer, he felt it opening against his will. Boss’s orders, after all.<br />
<br />
“There we go.” Deng-Long smiled sinisterly.<br />
<br />
The tip of the dragon-horse’s cock gently slid into Dmitri’s mouth. The taste was…odd. Savory flesh and sweet precum melded together into a rather alluring flavor. Dmitri blackened nose sniffed, the kirin’s tantalizing musk wafting into his nostrils. <br />
<br />
Dmitri lapped the cock, smacking his lips and chuffing.<br />
<br />
“There we go kitty, you like that, dontcha?” Deng-Long grinned sly and bucked his hips, shoving his cock down the tiger’s throat.<br />
<br />
Dmitri choked at the abrupt intrusion, eyes watering. He tried to back off the lengthy spire but Mothar’s hand pressed him lower, forcing more cock down Dmitri’s throat, until his nostrils were flush against the kirin’s sheathe.<br />
<br />
He flailed, gagging, and then something was pressed against the back of his head and his throat relaxed. Dmitri took a deep breath through his nose, enjoying the Kirin’s scent, and began to bob eagerly. The foot long dick was going to take some work, but Dmitri was an expert cock sucker.<br />
<br />
Dmitri’s hand lowered to his shorts, but Deng-long slapped his paws away.<br />
<br />
“Mothar, help our poor, needy kitty out.” the Kirin smirked. “Put your paws to good use, kitty-cat.”<br />
<br />
Dmitri bobbed faster, rolling the dragon-horse’s balls in his hand, using his other hand to probe the kirin’s ass.<br />
<br />
The ogre behind him adjusted the tiger’s stance, raising Dmitri’s ass into the air. A cool gel was slathered between the tiger’s hole, making Dmitri shiver in delight. Mothar hot dogged his thick cock between the tiger’s slick furry cheeks.<br />
<br />
“Boss, ya promised…” Mothar begged.<br />
<br />
“Oh, alright.” Deng-Long sighed and tossed Mothar a three Body chips.<br />
<br />
Dmitri wondered which Body chips they were, then felt something press against the back of his head. He shivered, tasting copper and started feeling…bloated.<br />
<br />
Dmitri felt cold as his fur began to shed, leaving his increasingly green skin exposed. Muscles pulsed and bulged thicker and heavier, pecs ballooning with strength, then softening slightly, becoming pillow-like. The growing orc burped, a layer of chub covering his muscles and his stomach bloating with fat.<br />
<br />
His muzzle receded, leaving only a pig-like snout and two thick yellow tusks that stuck up from his lower lip. Deng-long’s meat was sandwiched between them, slick with saliva. The Orc savored the kirin’s flavor.<br />
<br />
The Kirin placed a scaled hand on the orc’s head and the hair fell out, leaving the orc with a smooth, shiny dome. A short, thick goatee grew around his mouth and piercings dotted his ears and nipples.<br />
<br />
“Aw, boss,” Mothar groaned, cock finally slipping into the needy orc’s thick ass. “He’s everything I wanted! Can I still keep him?”<br />
<br />
Dmitri moaned around the kirin’s schlong as the ogre’s massive cock stretched his asshole wide, forcing the air out of him. There was a little pain, but the fullness was so enjoyable, he could feel goosebumps prickle his arms. The orc pushed back against the ogre’s mighty dark grey-green pillar.<br />
<br />
“Of course. Upon our win, I’ll transfer ownership of our newly Blank friend to you.” Deng-Long hissed in pleasure as Dmitri bobbed faster. “Fuuu-! Perfect Dmitri, just like that!”<br />
<br />
The orc expertly twirled his tongue around the kirin’s shaft, moaning around the meat. His ass was so full, so nicely stretched. The ogre behind him was hitting his g-spot with every thrust, like his ass was molded perfectly to it.<br />
<br />
“His ass is great! Not too loose, nice stretch to it….” Mothar blinked. “”Did ya…ya know…?”<br />
<br />
“Oh, I gave him a copy of the Body chip from that old fuckbot you had.” DL smiled. “What better way to reward my loyal assistant?”<br />
<br />
“Boss….” Mothar moaned happily, thrusting his cock into Dmitri’s perfect hole.<br />
<br />
“Ah, shit I might have outdone myself with this one.” Deng-Long huffed. “Fuck, I’m gonna…!”<br />
<br />
The kirin’s clawed hand forced the orc’s head onto his shaft. Dmitri flexed his throat muscles and felt the balls in his hand tense.<br />
<br />
“Oh gods!” The Kirin bucked his hips.”Make sure you swallow every drop!”<br />
<br />
The cock in Dmitri&#39;s throat bucked and flexed as a flood of hot dragon-horse spooge rushed down the orc’s throat.distending his belly.<br />
<br />
“Clean me. Worship me, your master.” The Kirin intoned.<br />
<br />
The orc dutifully licked and lapped every trace of cum off the kirin’s beautiful cock. The Kirin rubbed the orc’s bald head and sagged happily back in his seat. The orc followed, licking the kirin’s scales clean of sweat. <br />
<br />
The ogre’s cock continued to slip in and out of his hole.<br />
<br />
Dmitri whined, face flushed purple as he realized how close he was to having a hands-free orgasm.<br />
<br />
“Ngh! M-master, I-” Dmitri groaned. “Ngh! I’m gonna-!”<br />
<br />
“No you aren’t.” the Kirin said. “You don’t cum until Mothar does.”<br />
<br />
Dmitri groaned as his orgasm abated only slightly, but the need to cum hadn’t. He could feel his balls tense and churn, feel the overwhelming need to cum, but it was like he couldn’t cross the threshold into full-blown orgasm. Stuck at the edge. <br />
<br />
The ogre’s thrusts hadn’t ceased, and he felt it rise again, his whole body tingling. Dimitri groaned as he hit the wall again. He wanted to cum, needed to give his balls some relief, but he couldn’t! His need feel and rose with every thrust, leaving him in an agonizing but oh-so-pleasurable limbo.<br />
<br />
Deng-Long studied the orc’s agonized expression, smirking.<br />
<br />
“Alright, that’s enough. You two can finish up in your room, Mothar.” Deng-Long said languidly. “You have his chips. Make sure he’s back to normal when you send him on his way.”<br />
<br />
The ogre nodded, picked up his new orc sex slave, still hilted up to the ogre’s balls, and hauled him back to Mothar’s room.<br />
<br />
Dmitri moaned, each of the ogre’s heavy footsteps jostling his prostate. <br />
<br />
There had to be something he could do. He could-he could run after he ejaculated! The Kirin had been really vague with his order. “Finish up in his room’ could technically mean anything!<br />
<br />
“Thinkin’ about runnin’, huh?” The ogre chuckled, and Dmitri realized he’d been staring down at him the whole time. “I know how to fix that.”<br />
<br />
The ogre began to bounce the orc on his cock. <br />
<br />
Combined with the jostling, the orc had a hard time thinking. He could fight it, he just-<br />
<br />
He was picked up and dropped, cock smacking his prostate, sending a jolt of disruptive pleasure to his brain. Then jostled, as the ogre took another heavy step forward, smacking his prostate again.<br />
<br />
Dmitri shuddered through the pleasure. He could win, he just needed to-<br />
<br />
Pick up, drop. Pleasure. Jostle. Pleasure.<br />
<br />
He needed to-<br />
<br />
Pick up, drop. Pleasure. Jostle. Pleasure.<br />
<br />
“I-I need to-!” Dmitri gasped.<br />
<br />
“I know what ya need ta do.” The ogre grinned and picked him up and dropped him, taking another step forward. “Ya need ta relax and enjoy it. Let go.”<br />
<br />
No! He would run-<br />
<br />
Pick up, drop. Pleasure. Jostle. Pleasure.<br />
<br />
He-<br />
<br />
Pick up, drop. Pleasure. Jostle. Pleasure.<br />
<br />
“Just feel the sensations.” The ogre whispered.<br />
<br />
“I-!”<br />
<br />
Pick up, drop. Pleasure. Jostle. Pleasure.<br />
<br />
Stars filled the orc’s eyes.<br />
<br />
Pick up, drop. Pleasure. Jostle. Pleasure.<br />
<br />
Dmitri felt the slickness of the ogre’s cock as he slid up and dropped, the fullness as he hit the base of the shaft, his balls bouncing against the ogre’s.  That extra little burst of pleasure as the ogre stepped forward. The musk, the soft pillowy belly he could just lean on and enjoy the ride…<br />
<br />
The orc sagged against the ogre’s belly halfway to the ogre’s room, eyes glazed.<br />
<br />
“There ya go.” The ogre grinned.<br />
<br />
By the time they made it into the bedroom, Dmitri was lost in a haze of pleasure. The ogre fucked him hard and fast, already close.<br />
<br />
Dmitri moaned, eyes rolling up in his head. His arms gripped the ogre’s back, barely reaching around the huge stomach. Mothar kissed him deeply, thrusting.<br />
<br />
“I’m cumming!” The ogre gave one last thrust.<br />
<br />
As the ogre’s cock bucked inside Dmitri’s asshole, the orc gave a quiet moan and his own load pulsed weakly onto his own chubby gut, prostate too battered to do much but ooze.<br />
<br />
The ogre sighed happily and pulled out of the orc with a squelch. He rolled over and pulled the orc into him. The orc snuggled up against the ogre’s armpit and licked it gently.<br />
<br />
They fell asleep.<br />
<br />
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br />
<br />
Dmitri woke, confused, in a lovely tangle of limbs. He yawned, snuffling at the ogre’s armpit. His hand snuck down to feel the ogre’s substantial morning wood.<br />
<br />
The ogre awoke with a snort.<br />
<br />
He blinked, looking at the clock, then jumped out of bed. Dmitri stared as he watched the ogre rush around the room, searching for something. The ogre pulled out some chips and sauntered back to the bed.<br />
<br />
Dmitri smiled at his lover.<br />
<br />
“Come on the, gotta get you cleaned up.” Mothar smiled back and picked up the orc and carried him to the bathroom.<br />
<br />
Dmitri was too exhausted to object. The ogre erection smacked him in the ass with every step, and Dmitri felt his own rod begin to swell. He was still smitten with the overfed hombre.<br />
<br />
“Raring to go for another round, huh.” Mothar grinned down at Dmitri as he stepped into the bathroom and turned on the shower. “I’m gonna love you. I mean it.”<br />
<br />
“Love me?” Dmitri stared up at the ogre, confused.<br />
<br />
“Yeah.” The ogre said softly, moss green eyes staring at Dmitri tenderly. “You think I need another sex slave? I’m looking for a partner.”<br />
<br />
Mothar drew Dmitri to his mouth and kissed him, stepping into the warm shower.<br />
<br />
They embraced, hands exploring every nook and cranny of each other’s bodies. Water ran over their bodies, each touch slicker. Mothar reached to a soap dispenser and suddenly everything was slippery. The ogre tweaked Dmitri’s nipples and Dmitri in turn nibbled on the ogre’s.<br />
<br />
More soap, and a finger found itself in Dmitri’s slick hole.<br />
<br />
“Mothar…” Dmitri moaned as the finger deftly slipped in, rubbing his prostate.<br />
<br />
Another finger stretched Dmitri’s hole, the orc groaning as the thick digits slid around his insides.<br />
<br />
“What do ya want?” Mothar asked huskily.<br />
<br />
“I want you inside me.” Dmitri moaned.<br />
<br />
“Are you sure?” Mothar whispered. “My musk’s gone.”<br />
<br />
“I…” Dmitri stared up into Mothar’s beautiful eyes and gasped as another finger slipped into his hole, stretching it taut. “Gah! F-fuck me, please!”<br />
<br />
The ogre licked his lips and then his gaze shifted to a clock on the wall outside the bathroom.<br />
<br />
“I can’t, I gotta get you outta here in five minutes or yer gonna be late.” The ogre sighed and backed away from the lusty orc. “Besides, you’ll hate me when I remove all the chips we put in ya.”<br />
<br />
“I won’t,” Dmitri said adamantly, “I really do have a crush on you. That’s not a chip you gave me.”<br />
<br />
“Ya talk pretty now, but when I remove these chips, yer just gonna be disgusted with me.” The ogre’s pointed ears fell. “I know ya ain’t real.”<br />
<br />
Dmitri wanted to object, but Mothar reached behind his head and Dmitri’s vision jumped.<br />
<br />
And he recoiled in disgust.<br />
<br />
The smelly, overfed ogre, Mothar, loomed over him, chips in hand. Okay, so he smelled more like soap right now, so not so smelly, but still gross! His dirty green eyes  peered down at him sadly. Dmitri realized they were standing naked together, the corpulent monster’s oversized cock erect.<br />
<br />
“What the fuck!?” Dmitri gasped, soaking wet tiger tail lashing wildly, sending water everywhere. “Am I…did we?”<br />
<br />
“Calm down.” Mothar tried to placate the angry tiger. “And yes. Your memories might take a few seconds to come back, but just…”<br />
<br />
Dimitri stumbled out of the shower in disgust and terror. <br />
<br />
They fucked last night? Was he that hard-up for sex to fuck that tub of lard?<br />
<br />
“D-don’t slip! The floor’s wet!” The ogre called from the shower.<br />
<br />
“Stop talking!” He fumbled at the lock on the ogre’s door and flung it open. <br />
<br />
Dmitri staggered down the hall to his room  as memories of last night struck him. He’d been entrapped by Deng-Long and there was nothing he could do about it. Then they’d raped him. <br />
<br />
But if Mothar had raped him, why his cock was so hard? Why did he want to run back again, apologize, and go to breakfast with that ugly ogre? Was it because he remembered how nicely that thick green cock had stretched his needs hole?<br />
<br />
He shook his head and adjusted his shorts so his erection wasn’t so noticeable. If he did go back to Mothar, he’d be late for training. But…was training so important if he was throwing the show anyways?<br />
<br />
Dmitri found himself turning around and knocking on the ogre’s door. A few seconds later, he heard heavy footsteps, and then the massive ogre was glowering down at him.<br />
<br />
“Forget something, cat?” Mothar spat.<br />
<br />
“Mothar…I…” The ogre stared down at him and Dmitri was suddenly self conscious.<br />
<br />
“What?” The ogre snarled.<br />
<br />
“I just wanted to ask…” Dmitri swallowed, then look up into the ogre’s muddy green eyes. “Wanna get breakfast?”<br />
<br />
The ogre’s expression softened. He stared down at the tiger, throat bobbing.<br />
<br />
“Really?”<br />
<br />
Dmitri nodded.<br />
<br />
“I, uh, need to put on some deodorant.” The ogre turned to his dresser.<br />
<br />
“No!” Dmitri grabbed the ogre’s meaty arm. “I-I don’t mind.”<br />
<br />
The ogre stared at the tiger, momentarily perplexed. Then he grinned and slung his arm around Dmitri, who blushed. The ogre was clean, but there was a hint of musk just beneath the soapy smell that had his cock drooling.<br />
<br />
“If you don’t mind,” Mothar’s hand rubbed Dmitri’s back and then settled on his ass. “Then that’s okay then.”<br />
<br />
Dmitri nodded shyly, wriggling his ass.<br />
<br />
The ogre leaned over and kissed the tiger.<br />
<br />
“Let’s go eat. Continental breakfast is over in half an hour.” Mothar said.</p>
