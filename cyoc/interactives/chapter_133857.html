<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Author&#39;s note: I messed up when I uploaded the previous chapter. Didn&#39;t mean to have it where it is.<br />
<br />
Jordan suddenly heard a knock on the front door. “It’s open,” he called out. It was Toby, his neighbor, who opened the door. “What’s up, dude,” he asked after closing the door behind him.<br />
<br />
“Nothing much,” said Jordan, hiding his eagerness to play with his power some more. “You?”<br />
<br />
“Same. Just bored is all.” Toby looked around Jordan’s living room. “Want to play a game or something?”<br />
<br />
“Sure thing,” Jordan said. The two walked over to the couch in front of the television and gaming console. They grabbed some controllers, and Jordan inserted the game disc. It was a fighting game, and one with an expansive roster of characters. As they selected their fighters, Jordan had an idea. “How about we make this interesting?”<br />
<br />
“Oh?” Toby was intrigued.<br />
<br />
Thinking carefully, Jordan spoke with confidence, “We do best two out of three, and the winner changes the loser.”<br />
There was a moment where Toby would have found this statement to be the strangest thing ever said aloud, but it passed quickly. He then responded with, “You’re on.”<br />
<br />
Jordan and Toby were ready. The game loaded their characters—a toned, buxom woman with long red hair and a shirtless, burly man, respectively—and the countdown started. Soon as the announcer sounded off the fight, they two boys’ controllers clicked loudly as they proceeded to give it their all against each other. After a few minutes of back and forth, Jordan came out as the winner. The second round began, and, following another minute of clicks, Jordan won again.<br />
<br />
Toby put his controller down in defeat, and said, “Alright. Hit me.”<br />
<br />
Jordan thought for a moment before coming up with, “You will change to look like the character I used to beat you with.”<br />
<br />
Without hesitation, Toby closed his eyes as the transformation began. The first thing Jordan noticed wat that Toby’s blonde hair darkened to become a deep red before it grew out from his scalp. His facial features reshaped to become slightly longer as his face slimmed down. Jordan’s eyes were then drawn toward his friend’s chest as two mounds formed and grew outward until they were the size of melons. Their perkiness became enhanced due to Toby’s musculature strengthening to match the video game character’s. Apart from Toby’s thickening thighs, his legs also stretched longer. Jordan was able to discover that Toby’s waist sank inward while his hips did the opposite. Soon as the changes ended, Toby opened her eyes, which turned from brown to blue, and looked to see what she had become.<br />
“Not bad, not bad,” Toby said in his newly feminine voice. “Now, let’s get on with round two.”<br />
<br />
Jordan only nodded as he picked up his controller. They each picked new characters to fight with: Toby chose a petite young blonde woman with cat ears and a tail, while Jordan picked out a thin man in a karategi. This time, their matches were an even split with each winning a round before Toby one the third. Feeling satisfied, Toby said to Jordan, “You will change to look like the character that I used to win with.”<br />
<br />
Jordan was more surprised with his oncoming transformation than the fact he had lost. The first thing he noticed was he felt his human ears disappear and then reappear as large cat’s ears atop his head. He then had to readjust his seat to allow his new tail to grow. It had yellow fur, which led him to see that the hair on his head was brightening to a blonde color. Jordan then felt a sinking sensation as his whole body shrunk in height to match that of Toby’s character. He felt his body morph and reshape into that of a female’s. The last of the changes came in the form of two modestly sized breasts growing from his chest, and his male genitalia disappearing into a vagina.<br />
<br />
Jordan reached up to feel the ears on her head before accepting what happened. “Now that that’s done,” she said with a higher pitched voice than Toby’s, “let’s get this over with.”<br />
<br />
The two newly transformed women grasped their controllers and began preparing for round three. This time, however, they chose to play as characters they were transformed into. After several minutes of careful offense and defense, Jordan ultimate one the match after another tie-breaker. Toby did not react too harshly to losing, again, and instead awaited another set of changes.<br />
<br />
After another brief minute of thinking, Jordan said to Toby, “You will grow another head, a second set of arms and breasts, and lactate milk from them.”<br />
<br />
Toby could only roll her eyes before the sensation of some unseen force pushing her head to the side could be felt. It was not painful in any way as a mound formed next to Toby’s neck, growing and forming into an exact copy of her original head. Before she could take time to adjust this new development, Toby felt similar sensations underneath her arms and on her torso. Just as with her head, two arms painlessly grew out along with two breasts expanding beneath her initial pair. Once fully grown, Toby felt her breasts slightly increase in size as they became full of milk. The shirt she wore was stretched beyond capacity around four melon-sized breasts and four arms sharing the same sleeves.<br />
Jordan stared in astonishment at how amazing Toby looked. The two-headed red-head brought all four hands to her breasts to inspect them, while causing a small amount of milk to excrete from her nipples, damping her shirt.<br />
“Well this,” one head started. “Is interesting,” finished the other.<br />
<br />
“I’ll say,” Jordan said, licking her lips. “What’s more is how you managed to fit breasts larger than your heads into that shirt, Tina.”<br />
<br />
While Tina was still groping her breasts, she let out a low moan as they expanded further out on her chest, stretching the shirt she wore to its breaking point. Thick nipples could be see through the fabric as more milk leaked from them. The growth did not last for long as they slowed to a stop. While Tina’s bottom breasts sagged due to their weight, they provided support for the upper breasts.<br />
<br />
“I mean…” “It is weird…” “How I’m…” Able to…” “Wear such a shirt…” “With these udders…” “On my chest.”<br />
<br />
Tina slowly stood up so as not to fall over and made her way toward the bathroom. “Now…” “If you’ll…” “Excuse us…” “We need to…” “Let some of…” “This milk out.”<br />
<br />
Jordan smiled with glee with the results of his creativity, her tail swaying next to her.</p>
