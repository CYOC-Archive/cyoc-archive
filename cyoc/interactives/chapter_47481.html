<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I couldn't believe it. After history, and English, was Shop Class, and I was enjoying the simple pleasure of hanging and supporting Vinnie's junk without him walking or being scrunched between his thighs as he sat in a desk. His class was going to build a box today. Whoop dee doo, I thought.  I didn't care what he did as long as he was standing, and since they were all wearing aprons (Vinnie wore his a bit loose), Vinnie didn't care if he popped a boner. So I was all stretched out and enjoying myself as much as I could, when I got all tight and tense at what the shop instructor was saying.<br />
<br />
&quot;What's a jock box, Vincent?&quot; Mr. Oak asked as he looked at Vinnie's sketch design for his box.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, the coach is such a stickler for us wearing jockstraps, I figured I'd make a box to keep mine in.  Is there a problem with that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, Vincent, no problem. Just curious. I thought you might have meant jack in the box, and with that compact design, I was going to say it wouldn't fit right, but for a jockstrap - that box will be the perfect size. Go to work.&quot;<br />
<br />
Oh, no. This cannot be. Vinnie's making a box to keep me in forever? Listen Vinnie, if you can hear me, please don't do this. I've learned my lesson. Please turn me back.  Heck, wear me all weekend, just turn me back, don't keep me as your jockstrap permanently.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure if Vinnie heard or understood me, I know I tightened up considerably from fear. Vinnie's cock was now rock hard under his apron, and oozing precum into me.  I was hoping this was all my own fault and that Vinnie wasn't getting his rocks off based on my pleading. I absorbed, I smelled, I tasted, I relaxed.  This wasn't so bad. Least ways Vinnie kept himself pretty clean, and wasn't masturbating three or five or however many times a day Carter did it. I remember last year, Carter wore his jockstrap all year without washing it. He only replaced it when the pouch was half torn off, the elastic was unraveling and one of the straps had broken and been tied into place.  Now that bastard wanted to wear me. As a friend, Carter had been the best, but as his clothing, I shudder to think.<br />
<br />
Lunch was fairly normal. I'd feared that Vinnie was going to go to the restroom take me off and store me in his new little box.  I knew he finished it, and had gotten an A for it, and that it was now in his backpack, but I was uncertain about what his plans were for me. Maybe he was uncertain too.<br />
<br />
Horst and Carter sat down across from Vinnie with their lunch trays. <br />
<br />
&quot;Mind if we join you?&quot; Carter asked after sitting down, &quot;You know, Vinnie, this is a long weekend.  Well, we and Ryan were going down to my folks condo for the weekend.  It's in Florida.  Anyway, our bags are packed, the car's gassed up, and we got three beds. There are pools and beaches, and sunshine. It'll be a great trip. So?&quot;<br />
<br />
I thought, good ol' Carter, he's going to give Vinnie another try to get him to change me back today.<br />
<br />
&quot;I told you, Carter, I'm not changing Ryan back today.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, dude, you misunderstand. I thought you - Vinnie - could join us in Ryan's place. We'll drive you over to your house after school, get your folks' permission, pack a bag, and we'll be there before midnight.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You're kidding, you're inviting me to go on a Roadtrip with you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, why not? We got room for one more? And it'll be fun.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You never invited me to do anything like this before? Why now?&quot; Vinnie asked suspiciously.<br />
<br />
Horst answered, &quot;Two words: Ryan Standish. You stood up to Standish, that makes you cool in our book. We only hang with cool people. Maybe you were cool before, but Standish was the boss. Now he's an article of clothing, and I have a date with Vicky Winters to the dance next week.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Cool!&quot; said Carter, &quot;Vicky Winters is hot. I didn't know you two.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We weren't. I mean I wanted to, but Ryan said he'd dated Vicky a couple years ago, so friends couldn't date friends' exes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, I thought you dated Stacy a few years ago?&quot; Carter added.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ryan said that didn't count. He said Stacy only dated me so she could get close to him, so she wasn't a &quot;real ex&quot;.&quot; Horst rolled his eyes.<br />
<br />
Ryan had a sinking feeling, and Vinnie's junk which had shrunk when Ryan's two friends had sat down was starting to expand again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Florida sounds fun. Drive me home after school, and I'll see if I can spend the weekend sleeping in Ryan's bed,&quot; Vinnie said taking a bite of food.<br />
<br />
&quot;Heh, heh, not unless you want to spend it in bed with me,&quot; Carter joked, &quot;Ryan always insisted on sleeping in the King Size bed in my parents' room. So Horst and I would bunk in the two full-size beds. This time I plan to sleep in the king, but you still can have your own bedroom and bed if you don't mind a full-size bed.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, full-size would be fine.  I didn't realize Ryan bullied his friends too.&quot;<br />
<br />
Bullied. Did I bully people? <br />
<br />
The rest of the day, Vinnie did the minimal.  He was excited about a trip to a Florida beach condo.  The final bell rang, and Vinnie piled into the front seat of Carter's convertible. Horst was already  in the back seat. <br />
<br />
Vinnie ran into his house. It took all of ten minutes to get permission to go.  It had taken me over a day to get my parents' to consent. I just realized, they aren't going to miss me this weekend.  They think I'll be in Florida.  Oh, crap, I guess I really will be in Florida strapped to Vinnie's waist. Or maybe Carter's? I swallow hard as Vinnie stands half naked in his bedroom packing for the trip. He looks down at me - his jockstrap - and pets my tented pouch. <br />
<br />
&quot;You're excited about the trip too, aren't you Ryan?  I'd better pack your box to make sure I don't lose you. Wonder what happens to underwear left at hotels? Do they have a lost in found or just throw it out?&quot;<br />
<br />
Landfill was the sullen thought that filled my mind.  He was actually toying with the idea of leaving me there. Wait. It isn't a hotel it's Carter's condo. Oh, crap, he's talking about losing me to Carter. At least Carter's not a fag, like Vinnie.  I guess I wouldn't mind so much being his jockstrap inspite of the hygiene issues. What am I thinking?  I'm Vinnie's jockstrap until Tuesday, and then I'll be Ryan Standish again.<br />
<br />
The world went dark again as Vinnie pulled on some clean jeans.  A few minutes later, I felt myself scrunched as Vinnie sat in the bucket seat and strapped himself in.<br />
<br />
&quot;Florida, here we come!&quot; said Carter and the engine roared to life.</p>
