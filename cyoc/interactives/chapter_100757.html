<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Being my little brother of course! I&#39;ll take care good care of you.&quot; Jack claimed, &quot;Mommy said we could get a bunk-bed and even take baths together!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
Brian was incredulous, &quot;Jack you&#39;re a nice kid but you&#39;re being ridiculous. I&#39;&#39;m way too old to be your brother, much less a little brother.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nuh uh!&quot; Jack countered, &quot;I was older than you when I was a grownup, so you should be younger than me as a kid.&quot; <br />
<br />
Before Brian could demand answers Micheal Sunderland entered the bathroom, &quot;Jack it&#39;s time for bed. Sorry he&#39;s bugging you Brian, have a good night.&quot;<br />
<br />
While Brian was left alone once again, he didn&#39;t feel at peace with himself. <i>Was the 2nd grader referring to Agetripping?</i> he asked himself.  <br />
<br />
While the implications raced through his head the most surprising thing about the encounter was how incredibly aroused it left Brian. Having some cute kid talk down to him like a little boy gave Brian&#39;s dick the biggest hard on he had ever seen. After relieving himself of that pressure, he went to bed determined to leave for good the next day.<br />
<br />
Brian woke up well past noon the next day. Coming downstairs to scout out his hosts, he found Mary Ann feeding Charlotte her lunch. Baby Charlotte was dressed in a beautiful green and pink toddler dressed that not so subtly hid the pull-up underneath. The mother and daughter seemed to be playing some sort of game with Charlotte&#39;s food, and the 2 year old girl was far more interactive and spatially aware than a baby should be. <br />
<br />
Mary Ann disengaged from her daughter once she saw him, &quot;Good morning Brian. How did you sleep?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Too well, I haven&#39;t slept in a bed in far too long.&quot; Brain replied, &quot;Where is Micheal and Jack?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s a Monday Brian, Jack&#39;s at school and Micheal is at work.&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Where does Micheal work? He never said last night.&quot; Brian pressed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh he works at AgeCorp, he&#39;s pretty private about his job but he&#39;s an Adjuster for them.&quot; she explained. <br />
<br />
Brian was beginning to get some much needed context. In all likelihood, little Jack was just trying to mimic his adopted father.  He almost outed Jack&#39;s ramblings last night, but decided to hold his thoughts on the matter. Instead he said, &quot;It must be nice to have a husband making enough money for you to go back to being a housewife.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh I was a corporate lawyer before we got the kids not too long ago. Working moms often say that motherhood is a full blown job, but to me....it&#39;s a hobby.&quot; Mary Ann said.<br />
<br />
&#39;Well, I want to sincerely thank you for everything ma&#39;am but I think it&#39;s time I get out of town...&quot; he started.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh Brian I&#39;m actually in desperate need of your help,&quot; Mary Ann interjected. &quot;You see, Micheal and I are adopting another little boy soon and we want to set up a bunk-bed for him and Jack to bond over. Would you mind carrying it for me?&quot;<br />
<br />
Brian didn&#39;t like the idea, but his car was in town and that would be the fastest way of getting to it so he agreed. Brian, Mary Ann, and Charlotte all got into the Sunderland&#39;s second car and drove into town. The ride was peaceful and they soon arrived at the furniture store. Brian was easily able to carry the bunk-bed set the Sunderland&#39;s wanted while Mary Ann pushed Charlotte in a stroller, the toddler girl contently sucking away on a pacifier.<br />
<br />
With the bunk-bed loaded into the back of the car, Brian was looking for the best excuse he could to bail. He thought he had one when he saw his car in the distant, but the worst had happened. <br />
<br />
It was being towed.<br />
<br />
Brian instinctively went to open the door only to find it locked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Brian if you don&#39;t mind me asking, what would you be willingly to do to get your arm back? Your real flesh and blood arm back?&quot;<br />
<br />
The question paralyzed Brian despite all his intentions to save his car. In the entirety of his ex-military life he had never once been asked this question.<br />
<br />
Brian knew tactics, he was solider after all. Against all odds a kindly, soccer mom entering her middle age had Brian outflanked on all possible sides. There was only one real answer to Mary Ann&#39;s question and both of them knew it. Brian hated surrendering.<br />
<br />
&quot;Anything.&quot; he said simply, carrying the tone of defeatism in his answer.<br />
<br />
&quot;Contrary to popular belief the Agetripper is an inter-dimensional device.&quot; Mary Ann explained, &quot;People don&#39;t really become younger or older through it but are rather merged with their past or future selves. That means you can have your arm back Brian! We can zap all those horrible feelings and experiences from the Wars right out of you!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So Jack wasn&#39;t kidding.&quot; Brian admitted, more to himself than to Mary Ann, &quot;You&#39;re going to turn me into a little kid against my will. Don&#39;t you realize how messed up that is?&quot;<br />
<br />
Mary Ann placed her hand on Brian&#39;s back and gently rubbed it. &quot;You don&#39;t have to look at it that way Brian, it could be so much more joyous to you.&quot; Mary Ann offered.<br />
<br />
&quot;How?&quot; Brian asked, &quot;You&#39;re kidnapping me!&#39;<br />
<br />
&quot;Look at it like an exchange Brian. Micheal and I give you your arm back through the Agetripper and in return you become our son. Everything else: the values we&#39;ll raise you with, the money you&#39;ll inherit, the gifts you receive from us, and all the snuggles and kisses are all just a mutual love shared between us. Does that sound so bad?&quot; Mary Ann asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;So Jack was...&quot; Brian started to say,<br />
<br />
&quot;He was a debtor when he was an adult, we gave him the same offer to escape his crushing debt that we&#39;re giving you.&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
&quot;And Charlotte...&quot; Brian said as he turned and faced the toddler strapped into the car-seat behind them. Despite all logic, the baby girl gave a curt nod of her head. Seemingly aware of the seriousness of the conversation.<br />
<br />
&quot;We wanted to give her a new life.&quot; Mary Ann simply said. <br />
<br />
&quot;Why are you doing all of this? What&#39;s the point in turning adults into your children?&quot; Brian asked, desperate for an answer.<br />
<br />
&quot;My husband and I are unable to have children of our own.&quot; Mary Ann answered with honesty in her voice. &quot;We could have just adopted any of the many millions of orphaned children of the world and raised them as our own. But there&#39;s just....some drive for us to take adults with problems and fix them as children.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;So I&#39;m just something for you to mend into something else?&quot; Brian asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;Unlike Jack and Charlotte, we want to fix you physically rather then mentally. You&#39;re a good person Brian, better than most adults in the world. But you&#39;re on a dark path that will only end poorly for you. Why not just restart your life with our family? You&#39;ll be so much better off in the long run.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s humiliating Mary Ann that&#39;s why.&quot; Brian retorted, &quot;You&#39;re demanding that I give up my pride, my masculinity, my independence, my knowledge, and my adulthood just so you can play at being a mom!&quot;  <br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s true Brian.&quot; Mary Ann replied. &quot;But you won&#39;t forgot this life if that makes you feel better. Even Charlotte back there still remembers being a grownup before she became my baby girl. You don&#39;t need to feel so sorry for yourself Brian, you should just embrace this moment for the second chance that it is.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mary Ann seemed have usurped complete control over him at that point and began talking down to him, &quot;In fact sweetheart, if you just fall in line with this we can go to another store and pick out all the new things you&#39;ll need for your second childhood. Would you like that Brian?&quot;<br />
<br />
Brian&#39;s dick rose at the sickeningly sweetness of her voice and he complied in turn, &quot;Sure.&quot;<br />
<br />
Not too long after Brian found himself walking behind Mary Ann as she pushed a shopping cart that housed Charlotte in its baby-seat, sucking away at her pacifier like it was nothing. Brian wondered if she was enjoying her sucking just as much as he was enjoying the large bulge rising in his pants. The trio stopped in front of a section of superhero themed clothing in the boys department of the store, specifically for young boys. <br />
<br />
&quot;How young am I going to be?&quot; he found himself asking the woman he towered over.<br />
<br />
&quot;Micheal and I haven&#39;t finalized your age just yet, but you definitely won&#39;t be older than kindergarten age.&quot; She answered in a tone knowing that she would soon dwarf him in size. &quot;Probably preschool age so you and Jack have a nice 3 year age difference between each other as you two grow up all over again.&quot; <br />
<br />
<i>God I&#39;ll be barely older than Charlotte</i>, Brian thought to himself. <br />
<br />
&quot;So Brian,&quot; Mary Ann interrupted his thoughts, &quot;Who&#39;s your favorite superhero?&quot;<br />
<br />
That was all too easy for Brian to answer, &quot;Captain America.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Ohhhhhhhh. Of course it is honey.&quot; Mary Ann cooed as she gave Brian a plucky kiss on his check, which only further hardened his dick. The woman that was to become his new mom proceeded to pick out several dozens of Captain America themed clothes that he would be proudly wearing in his return to boyhood. After that they stopped in the toys section, and Brian found himself picking out the toys that he knew would be playing with in his immediate future.<br />
<br />
&quot;What would little Brian want to play with?&quot; He asked himself out loud.<br />
<br />
&quot;Try not to consider what you liked in the past.&quot; Mary Ann suggested, &quot;Memories have a way of hiding what you truly felt about things back then. Just pick the toys you&#39;re genuinely interested in owning.&quot;<br />
<br />
Brian was on the edge of an orgasm and he didn&#39;t know if he could stop himself. The public embarrassment and his mother to be&#39;s sweet words were turning his masculine nature into one of purity. The fact that he was complacent in his own childhood transformation made his erection all the more climatic. In the end he picked out several Avengers themed toys along with a puzzle maze that seemed enchanting to him.<br />
<br />
When they finally went to pay for everything the teenage cashier couldn&#39;t help but comment on the goods, &quot;If I was 10 years younger I would be insanely jealous of the lucky little boy about to get all of this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There&#39;s no greater pleasure in the world than to spoil a little kid into pure joy and happiness.&quot; Mary Ann commented.<br />
<br />
Brian&#39;s dick gave way at last and he climaxed. He unload his sticky juice all over his boxers underneath his pants and to his horror the cum stain revealed itself just below his crotch on his right leg. Brian did his best to play dumb and soon the trio escaped the store before Brian was called out by anyone else. <br />
<br />
Mary Ann gently grasped his hand, &quot;You&#39;re just going to be the cutest little boy in the world aren&#39;t you?&quot; Mary Ann said as she looked down on his cum stained pants.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes ma&#39;am.&quot; he coed back at her. Brian was madly falling in love with this woman. The dread and humiliation were utterly washed away, replaced now with just the anticipation of his inevitable regression back into childhood.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s get you back home so I can get you all nice and clean before your Agetrip tonight.&quot; Mary Ann said. <br />
<br />
Brian got into the front seat of the Sunderland&#39;s car to ride shotgun for presumably the last time for many years to come.</p>
