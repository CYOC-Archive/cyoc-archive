<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">By the time Brook was back home she had decided that her shoes were the best purchase she had ever made. They looked fantastic on her and they were oh so comfortable. She was going to have to show them off. She sat on her couch took off her shoes placed them on her coffee table and addressed them; &#39;Well shoes, you are the most comfortable and stylish footwear I have ever had. I would never have believed that I would actually get pleasure out of wearing 4 inch heels but I have&#39;<br />
<br />
She loved the current look of the shoes but even better was that she knew she only had to wish for it and she could change them into any style she wanted. Her mind began to tick over as to how to best celebrate her new purchase. She wanted to show these shoes off. Then an inspiration hit her. She would ring up some of her girlfriends and organise a night out clubbing. She knew the girls would be envious of her new purchase. She addressed the shoes once more; &#39;Such a gorgeous pair of heels needs to be matched by a good outfit. You stay here while I shower then find something nice to wear you with. I think we might go out dancing tonight. I just know you are going to prove wonderful to dance in&#39;<br />
<br />
She was being truthful - her new shoes were just so comfortable.<br />
<br />
Brooke literally skipped to the shower. She was feeling over the moon. She was thinking who she would go out with tonight. Tracey was her best friend and would be the first person she rang. Tracey&#39;s flatmate Maryanne was the other friend who immediately came to mind. Maryanne was a just as much a shoe nut as Brooke was. She would recognise the shoes immediately as Jimmy Choo&#39;s and wonder where Brooke had found them. Brooke would keep Maryanne guessing.<br />
<br />
After her shower Brooke was immediately on the phone. She told a white lie and said that she had just &quot;Broken up&quot; and needed a night out with the girls. Tracey was very consoling and offered to pick her up and take her out for dinner before going clubbing. Both Tracey and Maryanne were single. <br />
<br />
Next task for Brooke was to go through her wardrobe looking for something to best show off her shoes. Here she was disappointed. None of her favourite outfits did her shoes justice. Then inspiration hit her - she had a gorgeous gold dress she had worn to a cousins wedding several months ago. Neither Tracey or Maryanne had seen that dress. All she needed to do was change the colour of her new shoes to match.<br />
<br />
So with her outfit sorted Brooke spent the rest of the afternoon, doing her nails, curling her hair and perfecting her make-up. By the time Tracey was due to pick her up she was in her gold dress and had changed the shoe colour to be a perfect match. They were still recognisably Jimmy Choo shoes but were now gold and for good measure had added an extra inch to the heels. The combination of shoes and midi dress with a split showed off her legs perfectly. And they were still the most comfortable pair of shoes Brooke had ever owned.  <br />
<br />
Brooke wasn&#39;t disappointed. Maryanne immediately recognised her shoes as &quot;Jimmy&#39;s&#39; and appeared suitably envious. Brooke told the girls she had splurged out as she was &quot;Now single once more&quot; but she refused to tell Maryanne what she had paid for the shoes. She took off one of the heels and handed it to Maryanne who appeared to fondle it. Indeed Maryanne was checking out whether the shoes were genuine. As far as she could tell they were. She wondered where Brooke, who was always broke, had found the money.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile the former boyfriend now turned designer heels was once more in ecstasy as he enveloped Brooke&#39;s feet. He was vaguely aware that he had changed colour and that Brooke was dressed up and her two friends Tracey and the hot minx Maryanne were taking Brooke out somewhere. When he found himself being fondled by Maryanne he tried to communicate with her but found he was still voiceless. His desire to be worn apparently extended to all women. He was trying to tell Maryanne to put him on. He knew he could change size to accommodate her feet. However he wasn&#39;t disappointed to be given back to Brooke who immediately wore him. Once more he found himself in a state of orgasmic bliss.<br />
<br />
The evening could not have gone better for Brooke. Tracey insisted on shouting her dinner then they went clubbing where the three single girls had no trouble finding men willing to buy them drinks. Brooke spent most of her time out on the dance floor with multiple partners. The shoes were just so comfortable and she had confidence that no matter what she did she could not possible slip.<br />
<br />
Her shoes meantime found the dancing equally fulfilling. To be honest they were still just orgasmic over being worn by Brooke. Had Brooke un-muted her shoes she would have experienced hours of orgasmic moaning. The shoe was not aware of how feminine its moans now were.<br />
<br />
Despite many offers Brooke declined the opportunity to go home with one of her dance partners. She was feeling just a bit guilty about what had happened to her ex. It wasn&#39;t her fault that he had turned into shoes. And what could she do about it anyway? She certainly didn&#39;t have a spare $5000 sitting in her bank account. Anyway she convinced herself that she should abstain from sex for a week to honour him. <br />
<br />
However she did give out her phone number to a particularly good looking man who claimed to be a footballer. If he was genuine he could well be a step up on the now departed ex.<br />
<br />
Maryanne on the other hand wasn&#39;t heading home with Tracey and Brooke. She was last seen leaving with a tall blonde guy. Maryanne with her own gorgeous long blonde locks had never found any trouble sourcing bed partners.<br />
<br />
Back in her flat, Brooke took her new shoes to bed with her. They occupied the space where her former boyfriend had once slept. Brooke fondled the shoes and gave them a kiss telling them &#39;I love you shoes&#39;. They even smelt nice despite being on her feet all evening.<br />
<br />
The former boyfriend turned shoes was also satisfied with the evening. He adored Brooke and if he couldn&#39;t be on her feet then lying in bed beside her was the next best thing.</p>
