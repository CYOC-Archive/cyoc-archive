<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It wasn’t long until multiple things went viral across the globe. The obvious being the ‘Christian Pride’ going about in the USA, which seemed to receive little to no backlash from the LGBT community, more specifically the ones who have seen it.<br />
<br />
Next were the increasing amount of heterosexual celebrities, who continuously posted hateful remarks on social media and consistently getting loves and re blogs on them like it was ‘normal’. <br />
<br />
Finally was the tightening of familial bonds who, surprise surprise, were all homophobes as well! With one of the most infamous ones slowly overtaking the world!<br />
<br />
Well...actually, Britain.<br />
<br />
—————<br />
“See you in the mornin’ boo”<br />
“See ya...”<br />
<br />
Conan Chance kissed his boyfriend Avery goodnight, his lovely boyfriend and him finally managed to score a gateway out of the states. The budding Film Actor kissed him, Pressing gently against his lover’s cheeks. He was glad that their producer friend in Britain managed to get them two tickets for the latest film festival.<br />
<br />
And what better day than on his birthday!<br />
<br />
He always envisioned England to be a more accepting place than the USA. Don’t get me wrong, he loved the US, and he fought hard to even live there much less make a sizable stand in Hollywood. But to be honest..., he was getting slightly sick of it, and had even felt a little homesick...all the delicious food from the Philippines Gah! He wished he could taste them again.<br />
<br />
Not to mention the fact that after recent events on the news...its evident that USA started to get a little, homophobic. Not that their respective parents made it any better with their cutthroat remarks. Though to be honest...if they think that was bad. Wait till they find out the porno vids he has done on the sidelines...YIKES!<br />
<br />
Never letting them find out hun-nny!<br />
<br />
‘ZzZz’<br />
<br />
Conan glanced over at his naked boyfriend, snoring as usual...gosh its gonna keep him up all night! Not helping at all cause he had an insomnia issue....what’s a gay film actor gotta do to other than have huger eye bags at night than his Emo boyfriend!<br />
<br />
Avery was a goth, and a music composer. He had long, black Emo hair, and his lean body similarly was encased in dark garments, a tee shirt and boxers. He preferred to Jam to tunes when he was sleeping, as his head was encased with a set of headphones as it played a mellowed soundtrack from his latest album.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Conan had cub build, a semi thick torso and toughened arms, as well as those slick thighs. He was tanned and had gentle, yet passionate brown eyes. Bilingual as heck as he had managed to score awards in many worldwide film festivals, including mandarin and english as well as his home language-Tagalog. <br />
<br />
Not bad for a 5ft 8 huh? Was always jealous of his 6ft boyfriend though, but hey-at least he tops and tames the sheets~<br />
<br />
Dressed in an extravagant a floral buttoned tee and white khakis shorts, he intended on do ing a midnight hosting to all his fans, of a tour of the five star hotel and its facilities. He loved it here and it was so relaxing, wanting to start a livestream...when a notification popped up.<br />
<br />
Similarly to certain lady from another room.<br />
—————<br />
“Unbelievable! How this school encourages homosexuals in their unruly behavior!”<br />
<br />
In another room, Ms Hailey Neary was fuming mad at how this post went viral. Sent by a certain...Jessica Bling, who she was now made aware of her homophobia after researching the headlines on social media about her.<br />
<br />
Though the biggest puzzle was how they followed one another on social media, no matter, she will simply use this to exploit it.<br />
<br />
Furiously typing about this in her social media page, her short brunette hair over her auburn eyes and firm features. She was moderately fit, and behaved more manly than several men with a determination to win. Dressed in a typical business clothing, a black jacket and a grey buttoned down with a fancy top collar, alongside a pair of matching black slacks as she was having a meeting with a few clientele about a couple of homophobes.<br />
<br />
This Jessica Bling should definitely seal the deal.<br />
<br />
She glanced quickly over to her loving wife, Marcy, who was wearing a dark red and white flannel covering her body from the cold air conditioning, as well as black leggings as she was a Yoga instructor. Her curly red haired locks surrounded her face as she slept soundly next to her wife-with a couple of ear muffs over her ears so she could reach namaste in her dreams without interruption. <br />
<br />
Also the fact that she knew Hailey can be really loud sometimes.<br />
<br />
Her gentle features contrasted with her own, coincidentally, like a couple of gays in another room, tomorrow was their 10th anniversary. Clasped her partners soft fingers as she smiled at the loving thoughts when she had proposed to her and-<br />
<br />
‘URK!’<br />
—————<br />
“When I studied back in Britain, it was a much cleaner and conducive place for studying...unlike these Americans.” <br />
<br />
Conan was appalled at the fact someone by the name of...RRamesh, had messaged him this kind of thing! A few minutes before his birthday even! Wasn’t this pride month? And also since when did he accept his friend request.<br />
<br />
Though...as he was intending to unfollow that man. He noticed it was an incredibly hot, and famous actor with a great following...if he unfollowed him...that could leave a dent on his career.<br />
<br />
“Maybe...I’ll just put it on hold right now.”<br />
<br />
And...Conan he had to admit, the professor was kinda hot despite his slow...homophobic speech he delivered with his wife. Those rippling muscles...gawd..but he was faithful to Avery, he was faithful to-<br />
<br />
‘GH!’</p>
