<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">No wonder Jeff was so aggressive. He was in heat and that was why we <br />
were in the park.<br />
<br />
There was a big burly man holding back his male dog raring to get at <br />
Jeff.<br />
<br />
Well it looks like white fang likes your bitch.<br />
<br />
I would say so.<br />
<br />
Bob just looked at that big bear of a man in his leather jacket that <br />
wouldn't close at his chest but was so tapered at his waist. He was <br />
wearing a dingy t-shirt that showed black hair sticking out of the top <br />
and if allowed to do so would have joined up with his full beard but <br />
his neck and chest were trimmed to show a bit of definition between <br />
his head and his massive pecs. He had black curly hair neatly trimmed <br />
as was his beard and mustache and piercing blue eyes. There was a <br />
leather flag nicely concealed on the lapel of his jacket as if the <br />
daisy duke length leather shorts that laced up the sides didn't reveal <br />
his orientation.<br />
<br />
Well that answers that question. I think they will do well together. <br />
He said in a gruff voice. I am over there, He pointed to a nice little <br />
townhouse on the boarder of the green space and Bob followed him over <br />
there at a distance so that the dogs wouldn't connect till they got <br />
inside.<br />
<br />
Bob had to just about drag Jeff since his mind was still telling him <br />
he was a person and he knew he was going to get raped by this big dog.<br />
<br />
As Bob pulled Jeff inside he un-clicked the leash and let him to <br />
wander the house closely followed by white fang. Jeff finally finding <br />
himself in the living room in front of Bob, who was sitting on the <br />
sofa watching TV as the Bear, Jim, was getting him a beer.<br />
<br />
White fang found Jeff and Jeff looked up at Bob pleading with him not <br />
to do this.<br />
<br />
Jim returned with a couple beers and put his arm around him. I like <br />
you fatboys. Bob never considered himself fat but he was a bit jiggly. <br />
That big arm just pulled Bob into Jim's muscled torso as Bob giggled <br />
at the fur tickling him.<br />
<br />
I'm not that fat just a bit over 235.<br />
<br />
Naw but at what 5'3 you got potential.<br />
<br />
Damn Bob thought I have heard of it but never met up with one. This <br />
guy was an encourager and he wanted me to get fatter.<br />
<br />
Jeff and Fang were going at it with yelps from Jeff's dog voice but <br />
having given himself up to the situation he realized that this was <br />
going to happen.<br />
<br />
Give you any ideas? Jim asked Bob.<br />
<br />
Bob just giggled. He was like a school girl with the big football <br />
player making a play for her.<br />
<br />
Jim took that as a yes and picked Bob up as if he were a sack of <br />
potatoes and brought him upstairs. Not allowing Bob to undress himself <br />
Jim removed Bob's clothes and sat him on the bed completely naked. <br />
Eying Bob's body he said yea nice and smooth I like that.<br />
<br />
Bob couldn't believe his luck. He had figured that he would be alone <br />
forever. He would look in the mirror and see his pudgy body and then <br />
look at men like Jim and figure he would never attract such a hansom <br />
man. And he tried to diet and work out but that never worked. He just <br />
found himself putting on more and more after he would stop the diet du <br />
jour.<br />
<br />
Jim stood there still clothed with his hands on his hips eying Bob <br />
when Bob started to move over to Jim and try to undress him. <br />
<br />
Oh no you don't I'm the one in charge here.<br />
<br />
Bob just sat there as Jim did a strip tease just for Bob. Come to find <br />
out weekends he did the same show at the gay bars making quite a <br />
healthy living but it was always the twinks or muscle boys that were <br />
at the bars his heart would leap if he spied a chub in the room but <br />
they tended to stay to the back.<br />
<br />
When unclothed Bob noticed that he was furry front and back with the <br />
exception of his back being shaved it was all quite full. Allowed to <br />
grow he would have been as furry as his dog.<br />
<br />
Jim grabbed hold of Bob and tossed him on the bed face up and lifted <br />
Bob's legs entering him without lube and quickly sinking balls deep.<br />
<br />
Bob heard Jeff wander into the bedroom followed quickly by Fang.<br />
<br />
Jeff watched as Bob was pounded over and over by Jim and Bob could <br />
hear Jeff being mated by Fang over and over. Bob was in love and he <br />
never thought he would be in love at first sight but it happened.<br />
<br />
As the year went on and Jeff got heavy with his litter of babies Bob <br />
had moved in with Jim and gained weight as a straight man might when <br />
his wife was pregnant pushed on by his new boyfriend Jim.<br />
<br />
Closer to the end of the year and after Jeff had his first litter of <br />
babies Jim confided a deep secret to Bob.<br />
<br />
At one time I was a dog. Just like Fang but Fang found this computer <br />
program and we switched. He became a dog and I became his master. He <br />
tried to make it so that he would change back within a year but <br />
fortunately I had sat by him faithfully through the squiring of the <br />
computer and the program and when I became human all that knowledge <br />
seeped into my human form. You may or may not realize that most of the <br />
canine species go for the big girls. Means they are healthy but when I <br />
changed I became gay just as my master was and having been controlled <br />
all my life I became very dominant.<br />
<br />
Damn Bob said. I know about the computer program. That is what <br />
happened to Jeff here. he changed himself into a bitch and made me his <br />
master but I have always been this form.<br />
<br />
So are you ok with this? Jim asked. The most submissive he had ever <br />
been in their relationship.<br />
<br />
I got a god for a husband that doesn't mind me being fat. Hell yea I <br />
am ok with this.<br />
<br />
Can we keep Jeff a dog so she can keep breeding with Fang?<br />
<br />
That is an easy change now that I know Genie (Jeff) was changed too.<br />
 <br />
Bob had added almost a hundred pounds in the past year and now he knew <br />
that Jim wanted more.Jeff would make him a good living being bred with <br />
Fang and selling off the dogs.<br />
<br />
How could Bob have known he would get his hearts desire with this <br />
change in Jeff.</p>
