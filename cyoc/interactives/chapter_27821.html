<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;I have an idea. We each pick some packets, and we try it on the other person,&quot; Ben said. He pulled some water bottles off of the shelves. &quot;We can mix them in these.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's such a cool idea! So it'll be a surprise what we turn into?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, it'll be awesome. Just don't look at which ones I choose!&quot;<br />
<br />
Ben chose first. He looked at Tony closely. While admittedly, Tony looked pretty good now, Ben wanted Tony to be as big as he was. He had a real craving for muscle now. So Ben picked football player. But he was concerned that Ben wouldn't be very cut, so he picked Abercrombie model too. That would accentuate Tony's new charming features. But he didn't want Tony leaving him for some cheerleader so he picked a gay packet at random, not noticing that it said &quot;Dominant-Top&quot;. Last he mixed in a bimbo packet because Tony wasn't as horny as he wanted him to be--and Ben wanted Tony to be horny all the time.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, finished man!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait a sec... me too,&quot; Tony said, and turned around. They exchanged water bottles. Tony chugged his down while Ben drank his more slowly, eyeing Tony.<br />
<br />
The changes began right away. Tony heard his bones cracking as he shot up a couple of inches, topping off at 6'4&quot;. He felt himself start to get... well, thicker, as he gained the size and muscle needed to play... football? Yeah, of course, he was a football player... and a damn good one. Hell, he was fucking awesome, because he was so... cut, yeah, and tight, his body was tight... he felt his developing eight pack and flexed his huge biceps, strong for throwing footballs and perfect for a QB. His body was long, lean and tight for running, not to mention modeling--he was too hot not to be a model. His face was beautiful, his hair was fully blonde now, and his amazing looks would make him one of the top models at AandF, the brand of clothing he was suddenly wearing. His tight jeans and shirt only served to accentuate that he was now designed, basically, to have sex and to attract everyone. <br />
<br />
He dropped the water bottle and looked at his former best friend Ben, who had finished his and begun to change as well. Ben grew taller as well, finishing at 6'2&quot;, but lost a lot of his muscle (though none of his tone). He ended up having the body of a swimmer or a gymnast, big but not nearly as big as Tony, the body of an underwear model. His clothing changed too. His pants got tight and he was wearing a skinny t-shirt, and his arms were covered in bracelets. A hoodie than formed over him and his hair turned jet black (it was dyed, he realized, he was a natural blonde), almost blue, and fell over his face, nearly concealing his mesmerizing green eyes. His face became angular and pretty, almost girly, but menacing. It had depth and shades, and you found yourself wanting to just stare at him. One look from the new Ben could either melt your heart or make you run for the hills. His voice changed, becomign a little higher and more musical--he wanted to get on a stage and start rocking out, or just sit inside and play his guitar.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dude, what did you do to me?&quot; Ben asked, amazed.<br />
<br />
Tony sneered. &quot;I turned you into some lame skater I guess. I mixed the rock star packet with the actor packet, maybe that's why you're so fucking good looking, but I put in a jock packet for good measure because I wanted you to keep some muscle. Then I threw in a slut packet so you wouldn't get a big head and lose interest in me. I can't believe I wanted you to be some lame skater! Dude, let's turn you into a jock like me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ben was feeling so turned on, he felt like the king of the world. He was the shit. Everyone would want a piece of him. The mind altering powders must be kicking in. But he couldn't stop thinking about sex, about Tony's new body. This new Tony repulsed him--skaters and jocks were notorious enemies--but at the same time, he just wanted to feel those biceps... Ben got a gleam in his eye and came up close to Tony and got in his face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck you, asshole. Like I'd ever want to be some lameass jock who's only good for running into things and only thinks with his cock.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tony tried to think of something to say but for some reason he felt stupider, slower. He actually didn't really want to fight with this guy... he wanted to do something else, it was on the edge of his mind.<br />
<br />
&quot;That body looks pretty jock-like to me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I used to be a jock until I discovered that it's really about skating and music.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck you!&quot; Tony grabbed Ben and wrestled him to the ground. They rolled around until Tony was on top of Ben, staring him in the eye. Ben was daring him to do something, but the powder was having the last of its effects on the both of them. Ben smiled devilishly at Tony and Tony pinned him to the ground, and leaned in and started kissing him forcefully...</p>
